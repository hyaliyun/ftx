Sanderson was a linguist and a Kannada scholar. He is credited with co-authoring the first Kannada-English dictionary, published in 1858 by the Wesleyan Mission Press with the financial support by Sir Mark Cubbon. He also translated Lakshmisa's magnum opus, the Jaimini Bharata, into English. On return to England, he was appointed as the director of the Richmond Theological College. Sarah Sanderson Wesleyan Village Chapel and School Near Bangalore by Thomas Hodson (1859) The Little Hindoo School Girl (p.81, June 1866, Sarah Sanderson) Sarah Sanderson was the wife of Rev. Daniel Sanderson, who writing for the Wesleyan Juvenile Offering describes life in the Bangalore Pete in the 19th Century. Writing on 24 November 1858, Sarah describes the Wesleyan Mission School and Chapel in a Pariah village near the Bangalore Petah. The article also carried a sketch of the same, by Thomas Hodson. This school had some 30 children, 22 boys and 8 girls. They were taught by John a native catechist. Divine services were held on Sundays in Canarese at 7:30AM. The congregation consisted of 8-10 men and 25-30 children, and many others listening from outside the door. However, most seemed to attend out of curiosity of seeing the European ladies and men. The church services commenced by ringing the bell. Further, she describes the social scorn and humiliation suffered by the Pariah community, such as not being allowed to even walk in the street of the high caste people, untouchability practiced for the fear of pollution by lower castes. However, the Europeans readily employed servants from the Pariah communities and their children sent to Mission schools, brightening their employment prospects. Further, Sarah Sanderson, writing on 24 September 1859, describes the pettah as the native town of Bangalore with a population of about 60,000. The petah had nearly 200-300 temples or shrines, whose deities were anointed with oil making them greasy and black, and offered flowers and fruit. The petah now had 2 Christian churches, one was the London Mission Canarese Chapel (now Rice Memorial Church on Avenue Road) and the other was the Canarese Wesleyan Chapel opened a few months before September 1859. To the left of the Wesleyan Chapel was a low building, which had been altered and white-washed to serve as a school. The chapel did not have pews or a gallery. The floor was covered with bamboo matting, and there were rows of benches with seats of fancy cane-work (or rattan). 8 oil lamps using coconut oil were suspended from the ceiling to be used to lighting in the evenings. The windows which were generally kept open had iron bars to keep out the monkeys. Further, she says that her children liked walking the busy streets of the petah to reach the chapel along with their father, observing its noise, local people, shops and the monkeys. Monkeys were numerous in the Petah, and created nuisance by stealing food and other things from people. Sarah describes some events such as a postman walking up to the pulpit to deliver a letter to the preacher in the middle of his sermon on a Sunday. Another, when the Muslim mourning of 'Moharrum' was being observed when she attended church one evening. The people used to walk in and out of the chapel as they pleased. All so different from the quiet atmosphere of any Wesleyan Chapel in England.

It is currently under development by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in partnership with Indian defence contractor VEM Technologies Private Limited. Design The MPATGM is a low weight, long cylindrical missile with a group of four fins around its mid-section. It is fitted with high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead. The missile has a length of about 1,300 mm and a diameter of about 120 mm with aluminum and carbon fiber launch tube and collapsible tripod to save on weight. It has a weight of 14.5 kg, with its command launch unit (CLU) weighing 14.25 kg which combines a laser designator with digital all-weather sight. It has a range of about 2.5 km. The MPATGM is equipped with an advanced imaging infrared (IIR) sensor and integrated avionics. The missile has top attack capability. It reportedly share many similarities with systems such as FGM-148 Javelin, and Spike (ATGM). Development DRDO started work on a man-portable version of the Nag missile in 2005. On 20 December 2017, India cancelled a major deal for acquiring the Israeli Spike (ATGM) in favour of the DRDO MPATGM, after deciding that no transfer of technology was needed for the development of MPATGM. However, India reauthorized the deal in January 2018 during a visit of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to India. This deal was cancelled again in June 2019 after DRDO promised to deliver the MPATGM by 2021. However, the Indian Army bought a limited number of Spike (ATGM) to cater for their immediate requirement until the MPATGM is ready for induction. MPATGM user trials will be completed by 2020. =Production facility= The MPATGM will be manufactured by Bharat Dynamics Limited at a facility located in Bhanoor, Telangana.

He wrote the first undergraduate textbooks in mathematics, algebra, geometry, trigonometry in the Serbian language.He was also employed by the Serbian Ministry of Construction and Public Works as an architect in the then capital city of Kragujevac and later Belgrade. Biography Atanasije Nikoliƒá was a prolific writer and the most active leader of educational reform in his day. While studying philosophy in Gy≈ër, Nikoliƒá showed great affinity to mathematics but did not have the means to continue his further studies. A father of one of his pupils who he tutored privately advised him to enroll at the Great Artillery School in Vienna, where some of the best professors in mathematics in the Habsburg Empire were tenured at the time. 210x210px This eventually led him to successfully complete the course of studies in mathematics and consequently finish the engineering program at the University of Pest in 1829. Nikoliƒá had undertaken a number of engineering projects in Vojvodina and successfully completed them. In 1838 he was given the first chair of mathematics at the Lyceum. His first task was to write a textbook for the students, which he ardently set about doing, trying to translate mathematical terminology from Latin into vernacular Serbian. Nikoliƒá‚Äôs books became the first textbooks for teaching undergraduate mathematics in Serbia. The first one was Algebra published in 1839, and the second Elementary geometry, published in 1841. Atanasije Nikoliƒá left a vivid trace in the Principality of Serbia in all areas of life, including in the field of civil engineering and geodesy at university level back in 1846. He was appointed the first rector of the Lyceum in Kragujevac by the Ministry of Education. He opened an Art School, Mechanical Engineering and Economics Faculty. A Court Military Band was organized in 1831 in Kragujevac which was then the capital of Serbia. The founder and first bandmaster of the Court Military Band was Josif Schlesinger (1794-1870), a native of the Vojvodina, a part of the Habsburg Empire with a high population of ethnic Serbs. Schlesinger had noticed that Serbian choral societies which had become popular in the Vojvodina had helped to preserve Serbian identity there when it came to be threatened by Magyarization after the fall of the Bach regime in the 1850s. He suggested that the formation of choral societies in Serbia proper should be encouraged too. He himself helped to raise national pride through the music he composed for the Court Band and the Serbian theatres. At the Lyceum, Nikoliƒá wrote melodramas for the stage, some were turned into musicals by Schlesinger.The main people behind the establishment of the Theatre on ƒêumruk in Belgrade were Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá, Josif Schlesinger, Atanasije Nikoliƒá, and others who happily volunteered their time to make the theatrical productions a success.

Nativism and immigrant invasion According to the 2004 book entitled Migration Between States and Markets, the phrases \\"immigrant invasion\\" or \\"illegal alien invasion\\" and similar iterations, are used by nativists to describe what they believe are unassimilated and unassimilable immigrants. Louis Dow Scisco (1868-) coined the term nativism in his 1901 PhD thesis in reference to anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic sentiments in the 1850s in the United States. In his 1955 seminal and most influential academic study of the history of American nativism, Strangers in the Land: Patterns of American Nativism, 1860-1925‚Äîwhich has been reprinted numerous times‚ÄîJohn Higham, then a history professor in the University of Michigan, described nativism as \\"an inflamed and nationalistic type of ethnocentrism.\\"Higham was writing against the backdrop of the 1954 McCarthy hearings, in which for 36 days, investigative hearings into the alleged infiltration of the federal government agencies‚Äîincluding the CIA‚Äîby communists, led by then-Senator Joseph McCarthy, were televised. McCarthy had claimed in February 9, 1950 that he had a list of names and carried out investigations until he was censored in 1957 by the Senate. The televised hearings caused a national upheaval in which the concept of nationalism was revisited. Australia In a Guardian article, La Trobe University's fellow and emeritus professor, Robert Manne wrote that four tabloids owned by the Murdoch family, the Daily Telegraph, the Herald Sun, The Courier-Mail and the Adelaide Advertiser, had published a disturbing opinion piece by Andrew Bolt‚ÄîAustralia's \\"most influential columnist.\\" Bolt said that Australia was \\"being destroyed by waves of immigrants ‚Äì Chinese, Jews, Vietnamese, Indians, Muslims etc ‚Äì who refused to assimilate and who, as colonists, treated Australia not as a home but as a hotel.\\" Manne wrote that the publication of Bolt's article, entitled \\"The Foreign Invasion\\", in the mainstream media, is a \\"consequence of the steady and sinister and perilous drift of Australia's national conversation towards a permissible racism. In his article, which was also published in the Gladstone Observer, Bolt blamed the \\"massive immigration\\" on \\"activists, academics and politicians\\" who promote multiculturalism, which he described as \\"a policy to emphasise what divides us rather than celebrate what unites.\\" Canada There was a backlash against multiculturalism in the 1980s following an influx of refugees from Somalia. News commentators began to refer to \\"immigrants as \\"hordes\\" who stage \\"floods\\" and \\"invasions\\". ProQuest Dissertations Publishing. Journalist Diane Francis cited a teacher as saying that schools \\"has been totally disrupted by these invading hordes\\" of Somalian refugees. It was reported that these new arrivals were \\"damag[ing] Canadian society and caus[ing] inconvenience for native-born Canadians.\\" Francis predicted that the Somalis would contribute \\"very little, if anything to Canada in the future.\\" France In the spring of 2011, with the European Union deeply divided over immigration, thousands of Tunisian refugees arrived in Lampedusa, Italy fleeing unrest in North Africa. An April 6, 2011 article in L'Express, linked the arrival of the destitute immigrants, with the unexpected success of Jean Raspail's 1973 dystopian novel Le camp des saints, which was on the list of top five bestsellers in France in mid-March. The Camp of the Saints, which described a fictional invasion of France and destruction of Western civilization by a million immigrants from India, was translated into English and first published in New York in 1975. Then President Ronald Reagan received it as a gift in the early 1980s, and according to L'Express, both Reagan and Fran√ßois Mitterrand, were fascinated by the book. Samuel P. Huntington praised it in his 1996 non-fiction Clash of Civilizations. In 2004, William F. Buckley, Jr. called in a \\"great\\" novel and compared the fictional invasion in Raspail's novel as a cautionary tale regarding the controversial June 2004 rescue by the crew of the ship Cap Anamur, of \\"37 freezing and sick African refugees\\" in the Mediterranean. praised the book in 2004 as \\"a great novel\\" that raised questions on how to respond to massive illegal immigration, The Southern Poverty Law Center has condemned it for its anti-immigrant rhetoric. Sweden Chloe Colliver, a researcher for the London-based nonprofit, Institute for Strategic Dialogue that \\"tracks the online spread of far-right extremism\\", said that Sweden had become, an \\"enduring centerpiece of the far-right conversation.\\" The August 10 Times article linked the rise of the far-right party Sweden Democrats, which won about 18% of the electorate in the 2018 elections, to a backlash against the rapid increase in the number of immigrants in Sweden since 2015. The message the party spread was that immigrants who had not assimilated were \\"eviscerating\\" Sweden's generous social welfare, which is based on the \\"egalitarian idea of the folkhemmet, the concept that Sweden is a family with citizens that \\"take care of one another.\\"According to the August 10 Times article, the Sweden Democrats were established in 1988 by \\"several Nazi ideologues\\". Working together, Mattias Karlsson and Jimmie Akesson, transformed the party by purging Neo-Nazis, and announcing a \\"\\"zero tolerance\\" policy toward extreme xenophobia and racism.\\" United States The inventor Samuel Morse (1791‚Äì1872) used imagery of an invading army of immigrants in a series of articles he wrote under the pen name \\"Brutus\\" that were first published in the New York Observer‚Äîthen owned by his brother. In 1835, the articles were compiled and published in the book Foreign Conspiracy against the Liberties of the United States.Text Morse said that immigration had undermined the American character. In 1834 Samuel Morse had joined his fellow New Yorkers and many other Americans, in the growing anti-immigration, anti- Catholic nativist movement. He wrote that the impoverished and illiterate Catholic immigrants from Germany, Ireland, and Italy, who, he said, gave their full allegiance to the Pope, posed a threat to American Protestantism and the \\"American way of life.\\" Morse ran and lost in a bid to become mayor of the New York Nativist Party. Morse called on \\"every citizen who values his birthright\\" to repel \\"this insidious invasion of the country\\" by the Catholics. Morse wrote that, \\"Must we wait for a formal declaration of war? The serpent has already commenced his coil about our limbs, and the lethargy of his poison is creeping over us. ...The house is on fire .\\" To Morse, \\"monarchy and Catholicism were inseparable and unacceptable, if democracy was to survive.\\" The title of the August 27, 1873 San Francisco Chronicle article, \\"The Chinese Invasion! They Are Coming, 900,000 Strong\\", was traced by The Atlantic as one of the root causes of the spread in the late 2010s of \\"immigration invasion\\" rhetoric. The United States federal law, the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, was the first law that excluded a specific ethnic or national group from immigrating to the United States. Through a series of legislation over many decades‚Äîthe Magnuson Act, Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965‚Äîwhich overturned the National Origins Formula, it was completely repealed. Frank Julian Warne's his 1912 book entitled The Immigrant Invasion about the arrival in 2010 to the U.S. of one million new immigrants‚Äî\\"oppressed populations of Europe without land or access to it\\". Warne began with excerpts from recent works about conquering invaders by Arthur Conan Doyle and H. G. Wells. In Arthur Conan Doyle's 1910 series of essays, Through the Mist, he described the \\"three great invasions of history\\", the coming of the Huns to the Roman world, the Saxons to Britain, and the Muslim conquest of the Levant. In his 1906 book The Future in America: A Search After Realities, H. G. Wells warned Americans that they were not sufficiently aware of the threat of the invasion by newly arrived immigrants who were not assimilating and were living in \\"foreign cities within an American city\\". In the 1920s there was a convergence of \\"rising economic inequality\\", \\"new currents of scientific racism, xenophobia, and conservative ideology\\" that led to new immigration policies in the United States. The national origin quota acts‚Äîthe 1921 Emergency Quota Act and the 1924 Immigration Act‚Äîwere intended to reduce the number of immigrants in general, and to limit the number of immigrants who were considered to be \\"unassimilable.\\" This included immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, Russian Jews, and Polish and Italian Catholics. From 1907 through 1930, about 150,000 Filipinos who were responding to the American need for inexpensive labor in the agricultural industry, made the 7,000 mile journey to the United States, according to a 2019 NPR article. In the early 20th century, it was relatively easy for Filipinos to immigrate, because the Philippine Islands‚Äîwhich had been a Spanish colony for centuries‚Äîbecame a territory of the United States and was put under American military control from the end of the 1898 Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War until 1946, when the U.S. declared the independence of the republic of the Philippines. The arrival of so many immigrants at once‚Äîmainly \\"single young men\\"‚Äîraised some concerns of an \\"invasion\\" which was reflected in the title of a 1920 article in the Los Angeles Times entitled \\"The Filipino Invasion\\". The author of the article described the young Filipino men as \\"good boys, most of them trained on battleships or as houseboys to neatness, cleanliness and quiet courtesy.\\" In response to white workers, angered that Filipinos were taking their jobs, the 1934 law Tydings-McDuffie Act was passed, which \\"capped Filipino immigration at 50 people per year\\" and reclassified Filipinos in the U.S., who had been \\"considered to be \\"noncitizen nationals\\", as \\"aliens.\\" In 1935 President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a 1935 law in an effort to repatriate Filipinos already in the United States. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which was intended to \\"purge immigration law of its racist legacy,\\" created a \\"shift in the composition of immigration away from Europe toward Asia and Latin America\\" and resulted in a \\"substantial increase in the number of immigrants\\", according to 2012 article in the journal Population and Development Review.The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 repealed the 1920s national origins quotas. The Quota Acts of 1921 and 1924 were intended to reduce the number of immigrants in general and more specifically to limit the number of immigrants who were considered to be \\"unassimilable.\\" This included immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, Russian Jews, and Polish and Italian Catholics. The \\"rise of the Latino threat narrative\\" in the 1970s, and the use of both marine and martial metaphors by immigration agencies, officials, mass media and writers to describe the arrival of Latino immigrants, coincided with the termination of the Bracero program, which had operated as a farm laborer program from 1942 until 1964, the 2012 study also reported. With the increase in the number of illegal Latino immigrants coming to the United States from 1965 through the late 1970s, \\"political activists and bureaucratic entrepreneurs\\" began to \\"frame Latino immigration as a grave threat to the nation.\\" This led to a \\"steady rise of negative portrayals\\" throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s in the four major newspapers in the United States, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and the Los Angeles Times. According to the 2012 study, at first, the metaphors used to describe this immigration \\"crisis\\" were \\"marine metaphors\\", such as a \\"rising tide\\", a \\"tidal wave\\" that would \\"\\"inundate\\" the United States and \\"drown\\" its culture while \\"flooding\\" American society with unwanted foreigners. Increasingly, the media began to use \\"martial imagery\\" to describe illegal immigration as an \\"invasion\\". Border Patrol agents were described as being \\"outgunned\\" while attempting to \\"hold the line\\" and \\"defend\\" the US/Mexico border against \\"attacks\\" from \\"alien invaders\\"' \\"attacks\\". Immigrants were described as launching \\"banzai charges\\" to overwhelm American defenses.\\"The 2012 study, used Proquest Historical Newspaper Files, to search for paired words \\"undocumented,\\" \\"illegal,\\" or \\"unauthorized\\" with \\"Mexico\\", \\"Mexican immigrants\\", \\"crisis,\\" \\"flood,\\" and \\"invasion.\\" The New York Times reported that Cordelia Scaife May (1928 ‚Äì 2005), who inherited the Mellon family fortune, was \\"the most important donor to the modern anti-immigration movement\\". She funded anti-immigration groups such as the Center for Immigration Studies,https://splinternews.com/the-eugenicist-doctor-and-the- vast-fortune-behind-trump-1827322435https://www.splcenter.org/fighting- hate/extremist-files/group/center-immigration-studies the American Immigration Control Foundation, the Center for Immigration Studies, Californians for Population Stabilization, the California Center for Immigration Reform, Numbers USA, and ProEnglish. Through her Colcom Foundation, even after her death, \\"her money still funds the leading organizations fighting to reduce migration.\\" The Times discovered in her letters and correspondence how the \\"language she used ‚Äî about the threat of an \\"immigrant invasion,\\" for instance, and environmental strain ‚Äî echoes in [the] anti-immigration rhetoric\\" of the late 2010s. While, the act of entering the United States without documentation is a misdemeanor not a crime, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) Border Patrol agents began to use the term \\"illegal alien\\" early in the 1970s. Undocumented immigrants were thereby criminalized giving the INS, through its agencies and agents, the right to apprehend and deport people for being \\"illegal\\". A December 19, 1972 New York Times used the phrase \\"illegal Mexican alien in an article that described the complex socio-economic reality of life on the Texas/Mexico border where many Texans had depended on inexpensive Mexican workforce for decades. By 1972, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) Border Patrol agents were allegedly allowing thousands of illegal aliens from Mexico to enter Texas to work on \\"ranches and businesses operated\\" by their \\"hunting and drinking friends\\" according to the Times. The Times article said that illegal Mexican aliens were \\"commonly known as \\"wetbacks\\" or more simply as \\"wets\\". Leonard F. Chapman, then Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) published a 1976 article entitled \\"Illegal aliens: Time to call a halt!\\" in Reader's Digest. Chapman wrote that, in 1973, when he became the INS commissioner, \\"we were out-manned, under-budgeted, and confronted by a growing, silent invasion of illegal aliens. Despite our best efforts, the problem‚Äîcritical then‚Äînow threatens to become a national disaster.\\" According to political scientist Cas Mudde, Patrick Buchanan, whose nativist books are bestsellers, is the most prominent writer on \\"alien invasions\\" of the United States. Buchanan ran in the presidential campaign in 2000 on a platform of immigration restriction. In his 2006 book, State of Emergency: The Third World Invasion and Conquest of America, he wrote that Mexico was \\"slowly but steadily taking back the American Southwest\\". American nativists call this the \\"Aztlan Plot\\" in reference to the Mexican efforts to recapture \\"la reconquista\\" territory they lot lands during the (1846‚Äî1848) Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War campaigns. In State of Emergency, Buchanan wrote that, \\"If racism means a belief in the superiority of the white race and its inherent right to rule other peoples, American history is full of such men...Indeed, few great men could be found in America or Europe before World War II who did not accept white supremacy as natural.\\" He compares the immigrant invasion by those coming through the Mexico/United States border \\"to the barbarian invasions that ended the Roman Empire\\". He said that unless Americans stop the invasion, by 2050, the United States would be \\"a country unrecognizable to our parents\\". It would become \\"the Third World dystopia that Theodore Roosevelt warned against when he said we must never let America become a \\"polyglot boardinghouse\\" for the world.\\" A 1977 the Washington Post article traced the current anti-immigration campaign to the rise of the zero population growth (ZPG) movement in the 1960s‚Äìa movement co-founded by three men, including Stanford University Professor Paul Ehrlich, who co-wrote the influential 1968 best-selling book The Population Bomb with his wife Anne Ehrlich, who was uncredited.

They said that their publication continued to be relevant in terms of the \\"environmental, energy, and food crisis\\" in 2009.The Post reported that Paul R. Ehrlich, who was ZPG's honorary president, had signed the ZPG foundation's 1977 nationwide fund- raising appeal, a campaign in the United States that was intended to \\"generate public support for sharp cuts on both legal and illegal immigration to the United States.\\" The appeal said that \\"illegal immigration\\" was a \\"human tidal wave\\". It said these \\"illegal aliens\\" were \\"depressing our economy and costing American taxpayers an estimated $10 billion to $13 billion a year in lost earnings and taxes, in welfare benefits and public services.\\" John Tanton who served as president of Zero Population Growth for several years, co-authored the book The Immigrant Invasion with Wayne Lutton, published by the Social Contract Press in 1994. Central American migrant caravans‚Äîwhich refer to groups of migrants travelling together from the Northern Triangle of Central America (NTCA) to the Guatemala‚ÄìMexico border hoping to cross the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border‚Äîbecame a major Republican issue in 2018 mid-term elections. The day before the November 6 election, Fox News and Fox Business mentioned the term \\"caravan\\" 86 times compared to several days after the election, when they mentioned it only 23 times. The caravan they referred to was the largest so far. It had begun in Honduras with migrants starting to walk on October 13 hoping to escape poverty and violence in their own countries, by immigrating to the United States. By October 18 there were about 3000 migrants in the caravan. By October 16, Fox & Friends were focusing on the caravan as an election issue. On Twitter early on the morning of October 18, President Trump threatened to close the border and to use military force to prevent the caravan from entering the United States. He called on Mexico to \\"stop this onslaught.\\" The CBC reported that Trump had \\"seized on the migrant caravan to make border security a political issue and energize his Republican base\\" just 3 weeks before the elections. On the October 18, 2018 Tucker Carlson Tonight show group of panelists panel discussed the use of military troops to prevent the caravan from crossing the border. Tucker Carlson said that, \\"I guess I'm not hesitant to acknowledge the human cost. I'm struck by your hesitance to acknowledge the over 50,000 Americans who died last year of drug ODs. Where do they figure into this moral equation of yours where we deserve to be invaded because we take their drugs? What about the families of the 50,000 who died? How much time do you spend thinking about them?\\" From then onwards, during the month of October alone, Fox News used the term \\"invasion\\"‚Äîin reference to this caravan‚Äîover 60 times and Fox Business used it over 75 times. Newt Gingrich October 19 Fox News article said that the \\"caravan of about 4,000 migrants\\" was \\"attempting to invade and attack the U.S.\\" The man accused of the October 27, 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, who killed eleven people and injured six, had repeating the immigrant invasion rhetoric used by President Trump, other Republicans, Fox News and Fox Business, to describe this caravan‚Äîwhich at that time was \\"still hundreds of miles south of the U.S. border\\" according to David Folkenflik in his October 30 NPR article. Laura Ingraham on The Ingraham Angle criticized other media outlets for their \\"sympathetic overwrought coverage of this invading horde.\\" Steve Doocy said on Fox & Friends said that he was receiving email from people who said it was not a \\"caravan\\" but and \\"invasion.\\" Conservative pundit Michelle Malkin said that, \\"It is a full-scale invasion by a hostile force, and it requires our president and our commander in chief to use any means necessary to protect our sovereignty.\\" In 2018, there was a spike in the use of terms that demonized immigrants on CNN and MSNBC \\"almost exclusively in the context of reporting how leading conservatives had been using such language\\", according to an analysis undertaken by the New York Times and reported in an August 11, 2019 article. The Times examined the last five years of Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC transcripts, to quantify the number of times terms, such as \\"invasion\\" and \\"replacement\\",See also replacement rhetoric, remigration, Go back where you came from were used and to establish whether \\"hosts and guests spoke in their own words or reported on the language of others\\". An August 4, 2019 article in The Washington Post said that, after the 2019 El Paso shooting, there has been much debate over whether the use of immigrant invasion rhetoric by the current President of the United States, had influenced the shooter, whose alleged manifesto was entitled the \\"Hispanic invasion of Texas\\". The Times reported that American media outlets had \\"rarely used\\" immigrant invasion rhetoric prior to 2018. However, the use of words like \\"invaders\\" or \\"invasion\\" has surged in 2018 following the heavy news coverage of the 2018 arrival at the United States/Mexico border of the first groups of migrants from Central American. There were references to an immigrant \\"invasion\\" on over 300 Fox News broadcasts.\\" In \\"prominent conservative media\\", including Fox News programs and Rush Limbaugh shows, invasion rhetoric became \\"increasingly\\" a regular part of broadcasts. Three books Fast Food Nation, published in 2001, The Chain: Farm, Factory, and the Fate of our Food, published in 2014, and Scratching Out a Living: Latinos, Race, and Work in the Deep South published in 2016, concluded that what \\"Trump has described as an immigrant \\"invasion\\" was actually a corporate recruitment drive for poor, vulnerable, undocumented, often desperate workers,\\" according to The Atlantic.

The origin of Batman depicts the events that cause a young Bruce Wayne to become Batman. The core event (the murder of Thomas and Martha Wayne by Joe Chill) has remained fairly unchanged, but the aftermath and Bruce's journey to become Batman were not detailed until later years. The story first appeared in Detective Comics #33 (November, 1939), and was retold in graphic novels such as Batman: Year One. Story Thomas and Martha Wayne are shot by Joe Chill in Detective Comics #33 (Nov. 1939). Art by Bob Kane. The character's origin was first depicted in Detective Comics #33 (Nov. 1939), unfolding in a two-page story that establishes the brooding persona of Batman, a character driven by the murder of his parents. Written by Batman co-creator Bill Finger, it depicts a young Bruce Wayne witnessing his parents' murder at the hands of a mugger. Days later, at their grave, the child vows that \\"by the spirits of my parents [I will] avenge their deaths by spending the rest of my life warring on all criminals\\". Batman's origin is later expanded upon in Batman #47. Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable Gotham City socialites. Bruce is brought up in Wayne Manor, and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill while on their way home from a movie theater. That night, Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his life fighting crime. He engages in intense intellectual and physical training; however, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \\"Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot\\", Wayne remarks, \\"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible ...\\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to craft the Batman persona. Batman‚Äôs origin is expanded upon once again in Detective Comics #235 (June 1956), which recasts the Waynes‚Äô murder not as a random mugging, but an assassination. In this story, Batman learns that mob boss Lew Moxon hired Chill to kill the Waynes as revenge for Thomas testifying against him 10 years before. Analysis Media scholars Roberta Pearson and William Uricchio, in their 1991 work The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and his Media, also noted beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of Robin, \\"Until recently, the fixed and accruing and hence, canonized, events have been few in number\\",Pearson and Uricchio. \\"'I'm Not Fooled By That Cheap Disguise.'\\" p. 186. a situation altered by an increased effort by later Batman editors such as Dennis O'Neil to ensure consistency and continuity between stories.Pearson and Uriccio, p. 191. After witnessing the murder of his parents Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne as a child, he swore vengeance against criminals, an oath tempered by a sense of justice. Bruce Wayne trains himself physically and intellectually and crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight crime.Biography by Joe Desris, in Batman Archives, Volume 3 (DC Comics, 1994), p. 223. The driving force behind Bruce Wayne's character is his parents' murder and their absence. Bob Kane and Bill Finger discussed Batman's background and decided that \\"there's nothing more traumatic than having your parents murdered before your eyes\\".Daniels (1999), p. 31. Despite his trauma, he sets his mind on studying to become a scientist and to train his body into physical perfection to fight crime in Gotham City as Batman, an inspired idea from Wayne's insight into the criminal mind.Detective Comics #33 (Nov. 1939), Bill Finger, Bob KaneBatman #1 Spring 1940, Bill Finger, Bob Kane Another of Batman's characterizations is that of a vigilante; in order to stop the evil that started with the death of his parents, he must sometimes break the law himself. Although manifested differently by being re-told by different artists, it is nevertheless that the details and the prime components of Batman's origin have never varied at all in the comic books, the \\"reiteration of the basic origin events holds together otherwise divergent expressions\\". The origin is the source of the character's traits and attributes, which play out in many of the character's adventures. Alterations Due to the many writers who have worked on Batman stories, and constant references due to the central importance of the murder to the Batman mythos, many of the factors concerning the event have been altered. * The murderer is consistently identified as Joe Chill, although the mythos alternates between versions where Batman learns the killer's identity, and ones in which he never finds out. Chill has also alternated between being a mugger who randomly selected the wealthy Waynes, and a hitman who murdered them intentionally (the former is the most common interpretation). * The reason given for Chill leaving Bruce alive has varied. Sometimes it was because Chill could not bring himself to kill a child, and sometimes because Chill heard a policeman's whistle, police siren, or a rapidly approaching policeman. Often, it is because of the cold, frightening look that Bruce gave Chill as he kneels beside his dead parents; Chill panics and runs away. In the version presented in The Untold Legend of the Batman, Batman theorizes that Chill, a hitman hired by gangster Lew Moxon, deliberately left Bruce alive to report that his parents were killed by a robber. * The movie that the Waynes went to see has fluctuated between the 1920 version of The Mark of Zorro starring Douglas Fairbanks and the 1940 version starring Tyrone Power and Basil Rathbone. A third version has starred \\"Tyrone Fairbanks\\". Tim Burton's Batman has the Waynes leaving The Monarch Theatre having seen Footlight Frenzy. Batman Begins has the Waynes leaving an opera house showing Mefistofele at the time of the murder, which they leave early due to Bruce being frightened by the bat-like costumes, giving Bruce the additional guilt of leading his parents to Chill. In The Dark Knight's Visual Guide it says that Bruce would rather have seen The Mark of Zorro at a movie house. Thomas and Martha Wayne are notable as two comic book characters who have remained dead. Since his death, Thomas has only appeared in the Batman series in flashback and in the occasional out-of-body experience or hallucination. His most significant appearance in this latter category is in the miniseries Batman: Death and the Maidens by Greg Rucka. In this story, Batman ingests an elixir given to him by Ra's al Ghul, and believes he is having a conversation with his dead parents. In Bruce's hallucination, his parents disapprove of his costumed crusade, wishing that he would put their deaths behind him and move on with his life. As she and Thomas depart, they assure Bruce that just because the passing of time has lessened his grief does not mean that he no longer loves them. As a result, Bruce is able to accept that he is Batman because he chooses to be, not because he has to be. Consistent elements have included Thomas Wayne being murdered by a pistol, and Martha Wayne's pearl necklace being torn, with the pearls falling into the gutter. The murder takes place at 10:47 p.m. (Batman accesses the Batcave through Wayne Manor by turning the hands of a grandfather clock to this time.) In comic book continuity, the date of the murder has varied, although the 26th of JuneBatman Special #1 (June 1984)Batman Confidential #14 (April 2008) and September,Batman: Death and the Maidens #1 (October 2003) the current canonical date,Batman and Robin #1 (November 2011) are the most significant examples varied. Batman: Dark Victory asserts that the Wayne murders were the main cause of much of the corruption and crime in Gotham City; once it became clear that even wealthy, important people could be murdered so easily, citizens began to lose faith in the police, and the police themselves started to lose faith in their importance, leading to corruption within the force. Batman #430 includes a scene in which, on the day of his and Martha‚Äôs murder, Thomas Wayne is having trouble with some investments, and is going to sell short. Bruce thinks that he needs some exercise to take his mind off of it and so offers to play catch with him, but Thomas angrily says no, striking him across the face. A hurt and resentful Bruce declares to his mother that he wishes Thomas were dead. Thomas takes the family to a movie to make it up to his son, and in an ironic twist of fate, Thomas and Martha are murdered that night. Bruce feels guilty for years afterward. Alternative versions In the crossover story arc Flashpoint, which creates an alternate reality, Bruce Wayne is the only victim of Joe Chill's mugging. Thomas Wayne appears as this reality's Batman and Martha Wayne as the incarnation's Joker. Flashpoint #1 (May 2011) In other media In Tim Burton's Batman, a criminal named Jack Napier kills Bruce Wayne's parents. Later in the film, Napier becomes the Joker after his first encounter with Batman; the two foes later realize that they ‚Äúmade each other‚Äù. An original draft of the film's script had Rupert Thorne hire Chill to assassinate Thomas and Martha Wayne, because he was running for mayor against Thomas Wayne. In the 2018 film Teen Titans Go! To the Movies, Robin seeks to create a world without heroes. He does this by forcing the Wayne family to go down a different alley, thus saving their lives and removing Batman from the future. In the end, they must undo their meddling and push the Waynes back into Crime Alley, where Bruce witnesses his parents' murder. In the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Chill of the Night!\\", a dying Lew Moxon says that he only intended for Thomas to die, and even expresses regret over the death of Martha, especially as it left Bruce an orphan. In the 2019 film Joker, the Wayne family exits the theatre (which is showing Blow Out and Zorro, The Gay Blade) and are caught in the middle of a riot spurred by the Joker‚Äôs actions. Thomas Wayne takes Martha and Bruce through an alley for safety, where a rioter shoots him and Martha dead as a way of striking back against the powerful in Gotham. Thomas is depicted in the film as being indifferent and hostile to those protesting the dismal living conditions in Gotham City. Reception Newsarama places Batman's origin as number two of the greatest origin story in comic books describing it as \\"one of the most tragic in all of comic books, [setting] the stage for countless copycats using the trope of a hero who suffers a great injustice, and spends the rest of his life seeking vengeance.\\" Matthew Byrd of Screen Rant placed Batman's origin in the number one spot of greatest comic book origins.

He was especially known for his lively and sensitive depictions of young women. Biography He studied painting at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna, and was originally active in that city. He then moved to Paris, where he participated in the Salon from 1840 to 1889 and received two medals. During a visit to Istanbul in 1837, he was commissioned to do several official paintings of Sultan Mahmud II, including a large equestrian portrait and one of the Sultan wearing Western-style clothing, which is now on display at the Topkapi Palace Museum. One was donated to King Louis-Philippe by Mustafa Re≈üid Pasha, who was then serving as Ambassador to France, and may now be seen at Versailles. His painting \\"The Five Senses\\" was purchased by Empress Eug√©nie in 1865. The following year, he was named a Chevalier in the Legion of HonorDossier @ the Base Leonore and became a French citizen in 1870, just before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. During the war and the subsequent Commune, he lived in London. In addition to oil paintings, he was a watercolorist and painted miniatures on ivory.

Taking place in a fantasy world, players assume the role of two magicians as they travel to multiple locations fighting against demonic enemies and ultimately scale to the top of a tower in order to face Satan, who must be vanquished for good. Mystic Wand was previewed across a few video game magazines and trade shows to the public for testing, however, it was ultimately shelved for unknown reasons.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Mystic Wand is an action-platform puzzle game reminiscent of Solomon's Key, where players assume the role of two magicians on their journey through a fantasy world, fighting enemies along the way in order to reach a tower where Satan resides and ultimately defeat him as the main objective while facing challenging level designs, a countdown timer, instant death from any physical contact with enemies and limited ways to dispatch enemies, among other obstacles. Both player characters can run, jump, create or destroy blocks adjacent to them on any direction as well with the purpose of destroying demons or climb higher platforms. Along the way, players can also acquire items by opening treasure chests scattered on the playfield. Once the players loses all of their lives, the game is over as a result unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing.  History  Mystic Wand was first showcased publicly in a playable state to attendees of the Summer Consumer Electronics Show on June 1991 at SNK's booth alongside other then-upcoming titles for the Neo Geo platform such as Blue's Journey and Legend of Success Joe by Wave Corporation, among others displayed at the showfloor. The game was also showcased at the Amusement & Music Operators Association Show (AMOA) held on September during the same year as well. Though its production number during development remains unknown, it is generally believed to be assigned with the number 35, although there are conflicting reports online stating its assigned production number was 91. Despite being previewed in magazines and showcased across various trade shows, it was ultimately shelved for unknown reasons, however several possible factors have been given as to why the title was never released in recent years. The only known gameplay footage of the project was featured on a 1996 VHS tape sent to subscribers of the Neo Geo DHP mailing list called Neo Geo Collector's Tape. To date, no ROM image of Mystic Wand has surfaced online.

They each grew up in suburban St. Louis and met in high school before starting to collaborate in 2015. They released their debut studio album 1000 Gecs in 2019 to critical acclaim, followed by a \\"companion\\" remix album, 1000 Gecs and the Tree of Clues, in July 2020. Their music has been noted for its often chaotic mixture of various genres and styles. History =2015‚Äì2018: Formation and early years= Les and Brady, who lived just miles apart in St. Louis (Brady in Kirkwood, Les in Webster Groves), first met during high school at a rodeo. However, they first had the idea to collaborate after meeting again at a house party in 2012, which Les left early. In the winter of 2015, Les and Brady first produced music together, recording in Chicago (Brady \\"thought it would be really cool if we did it somewhere really cold\\") and eventually self-releasing their first EP 100 Gecs on July 12, 2016. The origin of the name \\"100 Gecs\\" is disputed, as Brady and Les have given varying and contradictory explanations in interviews. =2019‚Äì2020: 1000 Gecs= Despite plans to record more music, they were unable to find enough time until they performed a \\"breakout\\" DJ set together for the 2019 Minecraft Fire Festival; following that collaboration, they continued to work on songs and released their debut album 1000 Gecs on May 31, 2019 to positive reviews. In September 2019, it was announced that 100 Gecs and slowthai would support BROCKHAMPTON on their Heaven Belongs to You Tour later that year; 100 Gecs also headlined six additional shows of their own in various cities along the tour. In November 2019, the duo appeared on the Adult Swim web series FishCenter Live and performed the songs \\"800db Cloud\\" and \\"Stupid Horse\\" in front of a green screen backdrop of an aquarium. 100 Gecs were named an \\"Artist You Need to Know\\" by Rolling Stone in 2019. New York Times music critic Jon Caramanica called 1000 Gecs the best album of 2019, and it was rated among the best albums of the year by Crack Magazine, Noisey, Paper, Pitchfork, and Stereogum. Towards the end of 2019, Brady announced a remix album by the duo tentatively titled 1000 Gecs & th3 phant0m m3nac3 and set to feature artists including A. G. Cook and Injury Reserve. The album was later retitled 1000 Gecs and the Tree of Clues, which Les referred to as \\"a companion to the original\\". Tree of Clues was released on July 10, 2020. Several singles were released prior to the album. A.G. Cook's remix of \\"Money Machine\\" was released in October 2019, followed by Injury Reserve's remix of \\"745 Sticky\\" in November 2019. \\"Ringtone (Remix)\\", featuring Charli XCX, Rico Nasty, and Kero Kero Bonito, was released in February 2020. 100 Gecs signed with Atlantic Records in 2020; Brady told NME they are \\"trying to be really big‚Äîtrying to be as big as Ed Sheeran\\", while Les said that Atlantic was a \\"good fit... [t]here's so many things that they could help us accomplish\\". Before the COVID-19 pandemic, they were scheduled to perform at Coachella in April 2020. In June 2020, they stated in an interview with The Forty Five that they hoped to provide the soundtrack to a Disney movie, and headlined another Minecraft festival, Square Garden, featuring guests such as Charli XCX. In August 2020, it was announced that 100 Gecs would perform at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2021. =Fandom= Following the group's success, the pine tree depicted on the album covers of 1000 Gecs and remix album Tree of Clues became famous among fans. Soon the \\"1000 Gecs tree\\" was found, revealed to be located in an Acuity Brands-owned office park in Des Plaines near O'Hare International Airport. Fans of 100 Gecs began making \\"pilgrimages\\" to the tree and leaving items behind. In the Chicago Tribune, the tree and its fame were compared to the house on the cover of American Football's American Football(1999), located in Urbana. The music video for \\"Money Machine\\" was filmed in the same office park just before the photo was taken. Production style and influences The duo works on tracks by sending Logic Pro project files between the two, iterating songs each time‚ÄîLes called the process \\"sort of an exquisite corpse type thing\\". Their music has been called an \\"anarchic assault on the ears\\" that \\"[pulls] conventional pop tropes in every direction possible\\", as well as \\"abrasive, maximalist pop\\" with \\"elements of pop punk, nightcore, ska, dubstep, deconstructed club, trance, metal, and happy hardcore all thrown into one big internet blender\\", resulting in \\"[s]ongs [that] shift gears dozens of times, in a way that recalls... Kid606, or Venetian Snares\\", also earning comparisons with label PC Music and band Sleigh Bells. Les explained that the \\"merging of genres\\" is \\"more natural than people think\\", adding that the group \\"didn't expect that [1000 Gecs] would resonate with people so much\\". Brady has said 100 Gecs' style is influenced by Breathe Carolina, John Zorn, and I See Stars, among others. Les calls their musical process \\"[v]ery much almost an improv mentality\\" and has said that they \\"try to have fun and write songs that we would want to listen to\\", adding that \\"the whole idea of labeling genres is not super important to us\\". Les became interested in making music as a teenager when she got her first guitar; she has said that she \\"kind of always just wanted to be a songwriter\\" and \\"love[s] anything with a catchy melody\\". She has cited Naked City, Playboi Carti, 3OH!3, Cannibal Corpse, and various PC Music artists as influences. Both of them were heavily inspired by Skrillex's song \\"Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites\\". Band members and solo work =Dylan Brady= Brady became interested in music after being part of his high school choir and studied audio engineering in college for three years before moving to Los Angeles' Fashion District. He additionally produces and records music under his own name. In 2019, Brady co-produced the song \\"Click\\" from Charli XCX's album Charli (2019)‚ÄîCharli XCX explained that she heard about Brady via her fans and \\"listen[s] to [100 Gecs] constantly now\\".

It borders Langlaagte to the north and Homestead Park to the northeast. The name comes from the village of Paarlshoop, the oldest private township on the Witwatersrand.  History  Paarlshoop's name comes indirectly from the city of Paarl in the Boland but more directly from Paarlkamp, which along with Ferreiraskamp (on Turffontein Farm) and Meyerskamp (later called Natalkamp, on Doornfontein Farm) was one of the three first miners' camps on the Rand. Paarlkamp was also called Afrikanerkamp due to the large number of Afrikaners in the Paarl area, home to the organization known as the Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners. Paarlkamp was built on Langlaagte farm, where the main gold vein was found in June 1886. During the resulting Witwatersrand Gold Rush, several people from Paarl, including Stephanus Jacobus du Toit, formed the Paarl- Pretoria Gold Mining Association. On October 23, 1886, D.F. du Toit and H.J. Schoeman got the Association's permission to build a town on Langlaagte, which had been purchased by G.C. Oosthuizen for 5,000 on September 26 of that year. Since the land was part of the agriculturally zoned area - under article 20 of Law no. 8, 1885 - it was not earmarked for mining. The application letter made it clear that the sites were already in use before W.H. Auret Pritchard surveyed them on October 23. The State Secretary of the South African Republic confirmed that this was not the government's concern, since the land was private. On January 16, 1887, the auction house of H.J. Morkel and W.M. du Toit put the homesteads for sale. Paarlshoop - literally \\"Paarl's hope\\" - thus became a heavily Afrikaner town, the first city built on the Rand, since the sites were surveyed in front of Randjeslaagte. By the end of September 1886, the camp had already swollen to a population of 100, and in October it housed a butcher, bakery, smithy, and a general store. Most citizens lived in tents and wagons. The Rev. Abraham Kriel built the Langlaagte orphanage on a campus alongside today's church to house war orphans immediately after the Second Boer War. Today it is known as the Abraham Kriel Kinderhuis in his honor. The area was officially proclaimed a suburb on October 5, 1938, when it represented No. 38 on Langlaagte.  Sources  * Potgieter, D.J.

It is unique in its adherence to hosting art of a diverse range of artists from the Artists' Quarter of Safed with a special focus on the golden age of art in Safed.  History  Beit Castel used to be the home of the renowned Israeli artist: Moshe Castel. The house that overtime decayed was sold by Moshe Castel to his friend Yakov Hadad. Yakov Hadad as a boy was the court boy of Israeli giants such as Yitzhak Frenkel Frenel and Moshe Castel and used to assist others such as Nahum Gutman in order to make a bit of money for his family. Yakov Hadad has since rebuilt the gallery, turning the house itself into a fascinating work of art. In fact, the house (now gallery) itself is located in incredible proximity to the houses of artists such as Shimshon Holzman and Yitzhak Frenkel Frenel in Yitzhak Frenkel Frenel/Moshe Castel streets (Tet'Vav/Tet'Zain street).  Art  The art in the gallery was overwhelmingly produced by the great artists of the quarter such as Yitzhak Frenkel Frenel, Shimshon Holzman, Rolly Sheffer, Moshe Castel, Aaron Yaackobson and others. The art in the gallery is a fine mixture of modern art from the early 20th century up into the modern day, representing the breadth of modern Jewish art in pre-state Israel and the modern state of Israel.  Ambience  The gallery has a unique middle-eastern ambience thanks to its beautiful ornate gardens, trees and little courtyards. It contains a wide variety of ancient tools and stone works collected in part by Moshe Castel, Yakov Hadad and other Israeli artists who found those stoneworks among rubble, in the fields or in other locations.

They were the largest 2-8-2 steam locomotives ever built for narrow- gauge railways. Description After the completion of the Ryesong River bridge in 1932, Ch≈çtetsu's Hwanghae Line network took on greater significance as a direct route between Gyeongseong and Haeju, capital of Hwanghae Province, was opened. As a result, the increased production of rice, iron ore, and limestone, coupled with the development of Haeju Port, led to a dramatic increase in traffic volumes. This led to many proposals to convert the line to standard gauge. Since this would entail enormous costs and years of work, it was decided to further increase the transportation capacity of the narrow- gauge line. To this end, studies were conducted to determine the largest possible size a 762mm narrow-gauge locomotive could be, result in the design of what would become the world's largest 2-8-2 tender locomotive for narrow gauge. In charge of the design team assigned to the project was Takao Takada, for whom this was his maiden project, and who had numerous challenges to address. To allow for the use of low-quality lignite with a calorific value of , the firegrate area was made - a size comparable to that of the Japanese Government Railways' Class 9600 engines; naturally, this made the firebox wider than on other narrow-gauge locomotives. Because of the narrow gauge, the position of the boiler could not be raised. Since the space between the main frame is also narrow, cast-steel cross beams were inserted between the main frame and the rear frame, which gave more space to install the firebox. This was the first time this technique was used by a Japanese manufacturer. Despite having a very long wheelbase, the Class 900 could pass through curves of radius. To accomplish this, the leading truck was given a movement range of to each side, the first set of drivers had a lateral movement range of , and the flanges of the third set of drivers were narrower than the others. To ensure that this would allow the locomotive to clear a curve of such small diameter, at the suggestion of Kisha Seiz≈ç chairman Yasujir≈ç Nagashima, a full-size wooden mockup of the locomotive was built and tested on a curved track. The first seven engines, numbered 900 through 906 (works numbers 1441-1447), entered service in March 1937, and the results were found to be very good - water and coal consumption was low, and it could smoothly haul a train over at . These were joined by three more built in the same year by Nippon Shary≈ç, numbers 907 through 909. In 1944, a further four were added, two from Kisha Seiz≈ç (numbers 910-911, works numbers 2353-2354) and three from Hitachi (numbers 912-914). Locomotives of this design were later built by Nippon Shary≈ç for the Taiwan Railway Bureau for use on the Taitung Line. Postwar After the Liberation and partition of Korea, these locomotives were divided between the Korean State Railway of North Korea and the Korean National Railroad of South Korea. The three Hitachi-built units are known to have operated with the KNR, which designated them ÌòÄÍ∏∞11 (Hyeogi11) class and numbered ÌòÄÍ∏∞11-12 through ÌòÄÍ∏∞11-14; all three are preserved.

History  Heritage Walk Trivandrum (HWT) was conceived and founded in October 2013 by Bina Thomas Tharakan, with assistance from archaeologists, conservation architects, historians, and resource persons from various fields. HWT focuses primarily on history as people's history, and heritage as the common treasured past, both tangible and intangible, existing in every by-lane of the city and not necessarily in the majestic or grand only. In October 2017, Tharakan gave a TEDx Talk on HWT in Thiruvananthapuram.  Founder and prominent members  Bina Thomas Tharakan (aka Elizabeth Thomas Tharakan), archaeologist, children's author, is the founder member and coordinator of HWT. At the time of HWT's launch, Bina was a Special Officer with the Ministry of Culture and in-charge of coordinating activities for nominating two monuments of Kerala into UNESCO's World Heritage List, a project that ended in 2017. Since 2013, Bina has been organising the heritage walks to discover and showcase interesting facts, location, and monuments that have previously not been documented. Prominent members of HWT include Prof Achuthsankar Nair (Bioinformatics), MG Radhakrishnan (Asianet News), Gouridasan Nair (The Hindu, now retired), and Malayinkil Gopalakrishnan (Mathrubhumi). The pool of subject experts include Sharat Sundar Rajeev (Conservation Architect), Dr Hemachandran Pillai (Archaeologist), and others who support, contribute time, and share their knowledge.  Programme  HWT at Barton Hill, Thiruvananthapuram HWT conducts its events on last Sunday of every month. HWT events are free for all and are open to all interested to see, hear, and learn from scholars and researchers on Trivandrum's history and heritage. HWT has consistently conducted walks, excursions, and discussions on different aspects and phases of the Thiruvananthapuram city's establishment, growth, and its progress from ancient times to the recent past. The heritage walks try to discover the historical significance that are concealed or forgotten in its bylanes, crowded bazaars, places of worship, and public infrastructural development including schools, hospitals, institutes and offices. Each walk has yielded a wealth of information and has revealed many insights that have not been documented until now. HWT also conducts heritage home visits, keeping in mind the changing cityscapes and demolition of old private home structures. Many local residents share the oral heritage with the diverse group consisting of students, scientists, medical practitioners, engineers, teachers, writers, media persons, homemakers etc. It is a multi-disciplinary approach wherein interest is generated with anecdotes from locals, along with historical facts and figures from subject experts.

The conference was disrupted by groups described as Polish nationalists.  Background  The conference titled The New Polish School of Holocaust Scholarship () devoted to the work of the Polish Center for Holocaust Research was scheduled for 21‚Äì22 February 2019 at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS) in Paris. The conference was organized by the Fondation pour la M√©moire de la Shoah, EHESS, Centre national de la recherche scientifique, Polish Center for Holocaust Research, Polish Academy of Sciences (Paris branch), Strasbourg University, and the L'Histoire journal.Un colloque international √† Paris sur la Shoah perturb√© par des militants polonais, Political, 26 February 2019 The Polish Center for Holocaust Research published a two-volume study titled \\"Dalej jest noc\\" which covered the role played by Poles in killing Jews as well as turning them over to German authorities. The nationalist party governing Poland pushed back against such research, preferring to focus on German war crimes rather than any Polish complicity in them. The 2018 Polish Holocaust law, which made \\"undermin[ing] the image of Poland\\" a crime, was prompted in part by the publications of the new school. After international pressure, the criminal provisions of the law were vacated, but it remains in effect in civil law. Polonia groups wrote in a latter that they viewed the conference as xenophobic and anti-Polish.Konferencja \\"Nowa polska szko≈Ça historii Holokaustu\\" w Pary≈ºu. Polonia protestuje, Do Rzeczy, 16 February 2019 According to Holocaust scholar Yehuda Bauer some 28 Polish researchers can be classified as belonging to this school, which Haaretz called groundbreaking. According to University of Warsaw sociology professor Dr. Izabela Wagner, Polish scholars face two dangers: first the possibility of injury by groups present at their public appearances, and second being accused of \\"damaging the good name of Poland\\". These dangers are present in fields such as Marxism and gender studies, however Holocaust scholars face the highest risks. Protesters at Holocaust conferences take note of statements by Polish Holocaust researches with the aim of initiating judicial proceedings for harming \\"the good name of Poland\\". According to Wagner, the best organized Polish emigre group is Roman Catholics who enjoy institutional support from the Church that reinforces Polish national identity. Wagner states that the Catholicism practiced in Poland and diaspora often differentiates between \\"us\\" and \\"them\\", with antisemitism being a feature of cultural identity in recent years. Protesters indicated in interviews to public Polish TV and right-wing media that a Polish Catholic Mission priest was a central figure in organizing the disruption.  Program  Speakers at the conference included: * Jan Grabowski: Why did so few Jews survive? Results of a comparative study * Alina Skibinska: Jews' chances of survival in the occupied territories 1942-1944 * Karolina Panz: The case of Nowy Targ * Sidi N'Diaye: Reflections on hate imagery (Poland, Rwanda) * Agnieszka Haska: The fate of Jews as seen by foreigners in Warsaw * Barbara Engelking: Communists and Jews in Warsaw 1941-1943 * Jakub Petelewicz: Databasing and mapping the Holocaust ‚Äì Warsaw ghetto and ‚Äòaryanside‚Äô database and map project * Jan T. Gross: Journey of a Holocaust historian in Poland * Barbara Lambauer: O≈õwiƒôcim before the war * Tal Bruttmann: Polish Jews in Auschwitz * Anna Bikont: Irena Sendler revisited * Karolina Szymaniak: Rachela Auerbach: Chronicle and Archive of the Catastrophe * Fleur Kuhn: The literary and the political in the writing of Lily Berger * Jean-Yves Potel: Re-hearing the voices of the witnesses * Audrey Kichelewski: 1968 in Poland * Ewa Tartakowsky: Teaching Holocaust History in Poland since the 2017 Education Reform * Valentin Behr: The Institute of National Remembrance * Krzysztof Persak: From Jedwabne to Jedwabne * Elzbieta Janicka: Participatory observers of the Shoah: a new descriptive category * Andrzej Leder: The past and present of Polish society  Criticism prior to the conference  Polish right-wing groups, including the Coalition of Polish Americans, the World Union of Polish Patriots, Polish Media Issues, and the Polonia Institute demanded the cancellation of the conference. In a joint protest letter they wrote: \\"As descendants of Poles who fought and died en masse in the fight against Nazi Germany on all fronts ... we cannot accept the fact that the prestigious EHESS lends its scientific authority to anti-Polish, unreliable characters from the world of science\\" and further described the speakers as bearing \\"a clear xenophobic and anti-Polish character\\".Right-wing groups in Poland say Holocaust conference anti-Polish, Times of Israel, 18 February 2019 The letter specifically named Jan Grabowski, Jan Gross, Barbara Engelking, Jacek Leociak, Joanna Tokarska-Bakir, Agnieszka Haska as \\"dishonest\\" in their research, and complained that speakers from the Auschwitz Museuem, Pilecki Institute, IPN and the Polish Historical Society were not invited.\\"Antypolska, nierzetelna postaƒá\\". Polonia protestuje przeciwko konferencji z udzia≈Çem Grossa, Polskie Radio 24, 17 February 2019 These groups are opposed to research finding by historians which show some Polish participation in the murder of Jews in the Holocaust.Polish Holocaust researchers verbally attacked at Paris Shoah research conference, JTA, 24 February 2019 According to Times Higher Education, the protest \\"is a further sign that Polish nationalists are seeking to intimidate historians whose work argues that Poles were complicit in the Holocaust.\\" The Polish Institute of National Remembrance criticized the conference on social media prior to its opening. The messages were repeated on Twitter by the Embassy of Poland, Paris and by the Polish ambassador to Switzerland Jakub Kumoch. Polish public TV, Telewizja Polska, labelled the conference as \\"a festival of anti-Polish lies\\". Prior to the conference beginning, agitators attempted to intimidate the organizers with e-mails demanding cancellation. According to EHESS, they received numerous e-mails and phone calls demanding the cancellation of the conference. These messages often included extensive quotations of an essay by IPN house historian Tomasz Domanski titled \\"Correction of the (historical) image\\" which the IPN addressed at EHESS and co-organizers via Twitter. Historian Claire Zalc, who presided over a session, said she was intimidated by an insult laced telephone call to her home as well as several e-mails. According to EHESS researcher Olga Byrska an individual showed at EHESS demanding to speak with the organizers.  Disruption at conference  The conference was disrupted by shouting Polish nationalists based in France, or who had traveled from London or Poland.Holocaust historians suffer antisemitic abuse at conference, Times Higher Education, 5 March 2019, David Matthews French higher education minister Fr√©d√©rique Vidal wrote to her Polish counterpart to complain about the disruption of the conference by a group of 30 nationalists associated with the right-wing Gazeta Polska. Historian Jacek Leociak received death threats in online messages and was insulted as he left the conference. Leociak's speech at the conference was disrupted with shouting. According to Leociak during the conference a large Polish group, \\"under the spiritual protection of a Catholic priest\\", was present. Polish ambassador Jakub Kumoch and consul Markus Blechner said they requested recordings from the conference but were met with rejection. They did receive a private recording of the conference lasting 4 hours and 37 minutes in which no antisemitic slogans or shouting were audible, the only shouts audible being those directed at representative of Institute of National Remembrance. They further state that the recording shows organizers of the conference trying to stop the filming. Polish nationalists shouted \\"shame on you, you dirty Jew!\\" at historian Jan Grabowski as he left EHESS. The Warsaw-based Pilecki Institute tweeted that Grabowski made \\"controversial and outrageous statements\\". Grabowski said that such disruption would have been unthinkable in the past, but with \\"the support of the Polish state, they are ready to show their faces and to confront scholars on their own ground\\". Jan T. Gross said protesters with \\"no scholarly qualifications or intent\\" handed him leaflets describing \\"lies\\" in his research and accused him of making up an uncle. EHESS director of studies Judith Lyon-Caen reported that heavily edited recordings from the event on YouTube radically deformed what the speakers had actually said by stripping away the context, adding that Gazeta Polska had misquoted speakers entirely. According to Audrey Kichelewski, a member of the organizing committee, the first day was particularly violent with protesters regularly booing and shouting interjections. Kichelewski reported the distribution of a French language leaflet describing the position of the Polish protesters, which while not incorrect about historical facts was notable in what it chose to omit. Valentin Behr said his colleagues recognized some of the Polish protesters from a previous event with Jan Gross in 2016. He added that the protesters would heckle each time the Catholic church or antisemitism was mentioned in the conference. Clippings from the conference were posted online, accompanied by antisemitic comments. A far-right television station interviewed Polish individuals outside of the EHESS conference. More mainstream Polish media also covered the events, with Polish public TV broadcasting pictures of four Polish participants on their 23 February newscast. According to Izabela Wagner, Polish public TV labelled the conference as a \\"Sabbath of Witches\\". According to literary historian El≈ºbieta Janicka the protesters inside the conference itself were mostly women gathered around a Polish Catholic Mission priest. She said they were yelling things like \\"learn Polish before giving lessons to Poles\\", \\"Liars\\", and making antisemitic remarks about the Talmud, while surrounding, and harassing participants with questions outside the conference in a pogrom-like atmosphere. Inside, she said the protesters distributed antisemitisc propaganda and a pseudo-scientific booklet authored by the IPN. Janicka said that while she was giving her presentation, one of the protesters simulated cutting her throat in a manner similar to that in the Shoah documentary film directed by Claude Lanzmann. Historian Antoine Mar√®s observed multiple women using a thumb's down signal as if they were spectators in gladiatorial games voting for the death of the orators. Izabela Wagner wrote that after hoots and howls by protesters led to a request for silence, protesters turned to these violent non-verbal gestures.  Aftermath  EHESS management condemned the disruption during the conference. EHSSS president Christophe Prochasson said he could not recall such a violent disturbance at any scientific conference.A colloquium on the history of the Holocaust disturbed by Polish nationalists, Le Monde, 1 March 2019 Prochasson protested with the Polish ambassador to France, and EHESS submitted a report to the Paris public prosecutor on the antisemitic discourse during the conference. The Fondation pour la M√©moire de la Shoah issued a statement on 25 February 2019 indicating its supports for conference participants. Human rights ambassador, Fran√ßois Croquette, also indicated his support for academic freedom. The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance also released a statement condemning the disruption.Statement on Disruption of International Symposium on Polish Research on the Holocaust, IHRA, 7 March 2019 The Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) which had made social media postings during the conference and sent a delegate, was criticized by French higher education minister Fr√©d√©rique Vidal, who said the disturbances were \\"highly regrettable\\" and \\"anti-Semitic\\". Vidal further stated the disturbances organized by Gazeta Polska activists, appeared to have been condoned by the IPN whose representative did not condemn the disruption and which criticized the conference on social media that were further re-tweeted by the Embassy of Poland, Paris. In response to Vidal, Polish Minister of General and Higher Education Jaros≈Çaw Gowin condemned any acts of antisemitism, whether in France or Poland, and issued a statement saying that he could not identify in the transcripts provided any antisemitic attacks, while pointing out that conference organizers had deviated from the original topic of the conference and had attacked Polish authorities.Minister replies to French counterpart's letter over Holocaust conference, The First news, 4 March 2019 IPN President Jaros≈Çaw Szarek requested full transcripts of the event and promised to take any necessary actions. Polish ambassador to Switzerland Jakub Kumoch rejected the incident was antisemitic. ‚ÄûRydzyk jest za≈ºartym antysemitƒÖ‚Äù.

The article described \\"disinformation activities\\" as well as \\"names, anthropological features, expressions, appearances, character traits, methods of operation\\" which could be used to identify Jewish individuals. After a complaint by Michal Kaminski, the far-right paper was removed from sale at the Sejm (lower house of Parliament) information center.

He is known for his ethnographic studies of Tibetan and other Indic religions, investigating topics such as yoga, tantra, and the subtle body. Life Geoffrey Brian Samuel was educated at Leeds Grammar School and University College, Oxford, graduating with a bachelor's degree in physics in 1967. Moving to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, he took Part III of the Mathematical Tripos (theoretical physics) in 1968, switching to gain a certificate in Social Anthropology in 1969. He carried out ethnographic fieldwork in India and Nepal in 1971-2, and completed his PhD on Tibetan religion and society at Cambridge in 1975. He then gained a Postgraduate Diploma in Computer Science at the University of Newcastle, New South Wales, in 1985. He has carried out fieldwork in India, Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan, and other Asian countries, studying religion and health practices. He became a Professorial Fellow at the University of Cardiff in 2007, and then a full Professor, a post he held until his retirement in 2014. He then moved to Australia, where he researches and supervises postgraduates. Reception A Tibetan illustration of the subtle body showing the central nadi (channel) and two side channels connecting five chakras Stuart Ray Sarbacker, reviewing The Origins of Yoga and Tantra for the International Journal of Hindu Studies, writes that in the book Samuel brings together his own Indian and Tibetan work with wider scholarship, creating \\"a coherent and lucid narrative of the development of Yoga and Tantra within a richly contextualized social history of Indic religion\\", including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Sarbacker contrasts the book with Mircea Eliade's 1958 Yoga: Immortality and Freedom which gave little in the way of social context. Loriliai Biernacki, reviewing Religion and the Subtle Body for Asian Medicine, called it an ambitious endeavour to describe the subtle body in different geographic and philosophical traditions, from Daoist energy flow to the \\"transmigratory\\" Tibetan and Indian body of chakras and nadis and modern theosophy and new age shamanic astral bodies. Georgios T. Halkias, reviewing Introducing Tibetan Buddhism, called it a knowledgeable and instructive introduction to the topic, providing an \\"innovative and refreshing\\" approach covering aspects omitted in other introductions to Tibetan Buddhism. Halkias found the book admirably balanced between simplification and expertise, though he regretted the poor quality of Routledge's images throughout their book series, and the absence of a \\"comprehensive bibliography\\".

Administratively it lies in the Sermersooq Municipality. History This fjord was named \\"Fleming Inlet\\" by British explorer William Scoresby (1789 ‚Äì 1857) after Scottish scholar John Fleming (1785‚Äì1857). Scoresby assumed that this fjord connected with \\"Hall Inlet\\" (Hall Bredning) to the south. After more than a century, this fjord was finally properly explored and mapped by Danish Arctic explorer Georg Carl Amdrup during the Three-year Expedition to East Greenland (Tre√•rsekspeditionen) (1931‚Äì1934). Although Amdrup's survey proved that it was a fjord, the name \\"Fleming Inlet\\" continued to be used on maps for many years. A small wintering station was built in 1934 on the east side of Fleming Fjord near Cape Brown at the mouth of the Vimmelskaftet Valley during the time of the Three-year Expedition to East Greenland.Spencer Apollonio, Lands That Hold One Spellbound: A Story of East Greenland, 2008, p. 192 A Norwegian hunting hut was built in 1954 on the north side of the fjord SW of Kap Biot, at the time of Hermann Andresen‚Äôs expedition. Another one was built nearby in 1955 by Otto Lapstun, who had moved it from nearby Nathorst Fjord. Geography Fleming Fjord is located SE of the mouth of Davy Sound, cutting into Jameson Land, extending roughly southwestwards for about . The NW side of its mouth lies at the limit of Sermersooq Municipality, the Northeast Greenland National Park lying beyond Cape Biot. To the east lies the Wegener Peninsula and Cape Brown, beyond which lies Nathorst Fjord. On most stretches of the shore mountains rise very steeply on both sides of the fjord culminating in sharp peaks.

It is made in a Dutch oven with potatoes and onions, and is often served with bacon or smoked sausage. The dish was originally flavoured by rubbing the Dutch oven with bacon before cooking, but was not served with meat, hence the term \\"nu\\" (). The terms () or () are often included to indicate that the dish contains meat.  History  There have not been any documents found that describe the exact place and date of origin of the dish, but it likely comes from the Meuse valley. It was a dish linked to a self-sufficient economy, where the villagers lived off their own agricultural resources. The dish is mentioned in the work of G√©rard Gayot, La R√©volution en Ardenne, de l'Argonne au Namurois, during the years 1789‚Äì1792. In his work on the Ardennaise countryside in the 19th and 20th century, Jacques Lambert discusses \\"pot√©e roussie\\", \\"roussade\\", or \\"pot√©e √† cul nu\\", also called \\"cacasse\\" or \\"frigousse\\": potatoes cooked with onions and lard. Agn√®s Paris discusses the \\"cacasse\\" of the habitants of Bogny-sur- Meuse, reserved for days of opulence during the German occupation of France during the Second World War. Fran√ßoise Branget also mentions the dish in her book La Cuisine de la R√©publique.  Description  The dish is a symbol of Ardennaise cuisine. It was originally a fricassee of potatoes and a roux, cooked in a cast-iron Dutch oven, that the most modest people consumed when meat was unaffordable. \\"√Ä cul nu\\" indicates the absence of meat, with bacon fat traditionally only being used to add flavour, while the bacon itself was not added to the dish.

The station owner and his brother were prosecuted for flogging to death three Aboriginal workers who had fled the station.  The incident  In September 1897 six Aboriginal workers ran away from Bendhu station, apparently because sheep had run away and they were afraid of being punished. Having walked for over 25 miles without water, they were recaptured by Ernest and Alexander Anderson, who proceeded to severely flog them. One elderly man (Pringamurra, also called Spider) and two women (Warradamngenmia, also called Biddy; and Narilung, also called Polly) died later that day. Another man (Jabramurra, also called Kandy) and two girls (Haberine, also called Louie, aged about twelve; and Wireroo, also called Minnie, aged about eight) were also flogged and left for dead, but survived. A post-mortem examination concluded that Pringamurra, Warradamngenmia and Narilung had died of shock from injuries sustained from the flogging (which included broken bones), possibly exacerbated by dehydration and exhaustion.  Prosecution and aftermath  Ernest and Alexander Anderson were initially fined ¬£2 and issued with a warning about their behaviour. After public outrage, the police upgraded the charge against them to one of murder. Alexander Anderson died of typhoid fever in Fremantle Prison whilst awaiting trial. Ernest Anderson was tried for murder but found guilty on the lesser charge of manslaughter. The Chief Justice, Alexander Onslow, was dismayed at the jury's verdict, and considered Anderson to be guilty of a \\"particularly hideous and atrocious murder\\". He sentenced Anderson to life imprisonment, a uniquely severe sentence for a manslaughter case at this time. Anderson was thought to be the first white man to be convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of an Aboriginal person under Western Australia's legal system of self-government. He was ultimately released from prison after serving only six years of his sentence. The case was reported widely in the Australian press (and in some British newspapers), many of which condemned the verdict of manslaughter as excessively lenient.

He did not kill again until 2005, when he raped and killed 4 girls and women. The first two occurred on January 2 and 7, and the third on February 24. At the same time, local authorities were seriously worried about the serial killings, offering a reward of 2,000 yuan for information about the killer's identity and whereabouts.Êèê‰æõ‚Äú2¬∑25‚ÄùÁ≥ªÂàóÊ°à‰æ¶Á†¥Á∫øÁ¥¢Â•ñ20‰∏áÂÜÖËíôÂè§Ë≠¶ÊñπÂÖëÁé∞ÊâøËØ∫ In July 2005, Zhao killed his last victim.

However, she did not know his name and place of residence. While looking for the offender with the police, she identified Zhao Zhihong at his workplace, and on October 23, 2005, he was arrested. Zhao immediately confessed, admitting to having committed more than 20 crimes between 1996 and 2005, including 6 murders and 10 rapes, two of which were against minors. In addition, he was also responsible for several cases of robberies, theft and misappropriation of property. Most controversially, he admitted to killing the mill worker Yang in 1996, a crime for which the 18-year-old Huugjilt was executed. Due to the constantly opening up of new circumstances of Zhao's crimes, the trial of the killer was adjourned all the time. At the same time, on December 15, 2014, the Hohhot District Court posthumously acquitted Huugjilt, publicly apologizing to his relatives and paying them 330,000 yuan in compensation.Executed man given justice after 18 years Zhao's trial began on January 5, 2015, and was held behind closed doors.

Nevertheless, on February 9, 2015, the District Court of Hohhot found the 42-year-old guilty of 6 murders, 10 rapes and at least one case of robbery.

The duo's first full-length studio album for the label, the album is a return to Sun Electric's more beat- oriented material and incorporates styles of dub, jungle, IDM, breakbeat and downtempo. The album artwork by The Designer's Republic features a manipulated image similar to artworks of Madonna, reflecting the melancholic, fractured sound of the album. Music critics greeted Present favourably, praising its inventive style, and some have since recognised the record as overlooked. Background and composition Sun Electric, consisting of Mac Loderbauer and Tom Thiel, formed in Berlin at the advice of their manager Thomas Fehlmann, and were hailed as pioneers of ambient house upon their emergence in 1990, according to a 2013 piece in Fact, and were greeted with praise from fellow producers Alex Paterson and Jimmy Cauty of The Orb. After releasing their debut single on \\"O Locco\\" on Paterson's Wau! Mr. Lodo label, and a failed contract with ZTT, Sun Electric signed to Apollo Records, a subsidiary of R&S; Records, and released their debut album Kitchen (1993). This was soon followed by the mini-album Aaah! CD (1994) and the live album 30.7.94 (1995), which featured co-production and \\"mentoring\\" from Fehlmann. Sun Electric produced Present in Berlin, with Fehlmann again acting as a musical consultant. He is credited in the liner notes as \\"Global Energy Consultant.\\" Present is a sophisticated, downtempo-styled techno album infused with dub music, featuring heavy synthesised stings and elements of ambient music. Fragmented and melancholy in style, the record also features hints of jungle and serial music, and is more beat-oriented than the more relaxed 30.7.94, with most songs eschewing the trance-style rhythms of Kitchen and Aaah! CD in favour of a breakbeat-based IDM approach, according to writer Sean Cooper. Regardless of the jungle influences, few of the album's rhythms are reducible to drum and bass, with subtler beat layering and \\"rhythmic eruptions\\" comparable to experimental ambient techno acts like Tournesol and The Black Dog. Critical reception Present was released by Apollo on 25 November 1996. The Designer's Republic provided the album photography and artwork, with the album cover \\"constructed of ribbons of the same image bitmapped with various digital texture.\\" Insomniac ranked the cover at number 75 on their list of \\"100 Best Electronic Music Album Covers\\", with writer Dennis Kane writing: \\"Almost like a Madonna painting, but with the head horizontal not vertical, the art is fragmented and melancholy, like the music.\\" In a contemporary review, Sean Cooper of AllMusic named Present an \\"Album Pick\\", writing that while some listeners would criticise the perceived \\"jungle trendiness\\" of the album's \\"breakbeat, IDM tip\\", he found the album's rhythms more inventive than in that \\"few of the rhythms on the album are reducible to drum'n'bass\\" Gert van Veen of de Volkskrant wrote that with the album, the duo \\"leaves its own mark in ambient and dance.\\" He found the album to build on the styles of Kitchen and Aaah! CD, despite the passing musical climate, and wrote that the music is \\"subtle and adventurous,\\" hailing how \\"even though the listener is regularly confronted with surprises, the album never ends up in endless experiments.\\" He also felt the title was ironic as the album contained \\"hardly any echoes\\" of contemporary genres like trip hop and drum and bass, and that by \\"precisely by drawing their own line so clearly, Sun Electric has conquered its own place, which the group consolidates with this beautiful album.\\" Zitty magazine described Present as a beautiful album \\"in a class of its own.\\" In a 2013, Tim Purdon of Fact included Present in the magazine's list \\"The 15 greatest techno albums you've never heard: Part 1\\", commenting that he finds the \\"classy\\" album to have \\"stood the test of the time much better than, say, UFOrb or Chill Out.\\" In 2015, Pitchfork included \\"Stimpak\\" in the list \\"Emotional Intelligence: A Guide to Melodic IDM\\", with writer Philip Sherburne saying that by the mid-1990s, Sun Electric had become \\"masters of elastic rhythms and silvery leads.\\" He hailed Present and its follow-up Via Nostra as \\"underrated masterpieces of late-'90s electronica.\\" Dennis Kane of Insomniac reflected that the album has been \\"slept-on.\\" Project Revolver named it one of the 22 best techno albums between 1989 and 1999.

Mercy Apartments is an apartment complex for retirees, located at 1425 Bridge Street NW in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It was formerly a Catholic convent and private school known as the Mt. Mercy Academy and Convent. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. History In 1872, Father Patrick J. McManus of St. Andrew's parish invited a small group from the Sisters of Mercy Convent in Brooklyn, New York to Grand Rapids to teach at the newly opened St. Andrew's School. Four sisters arrived, and established an independent religious community, called the Sisters of Mercy of the Grand Rapids Diocese. The co-educational St. Andrew's School was well received by the community, but Mother Joseph Lynch, the head of the Mercy Sisters, wished to open an all-girl school in its place. Father McManus disagreed, and the two parted way. The sisters opened the Academy of Our Lady of Mercy for girls in 1877, but it soon closed due to financial pressures. The sisters, feeling the same financial pressures, turned to medicine and opened a hospital in Big Rapids, Michigan in 1879 to tend to lumberjacks. The move was successful, and the order spent the rest of the 1800s in Big Rapids. By the 1910s, lumbering in Michigan had almost disappeared, and the order decided to return to Grand Rapids. In 1914, they purchased the Harrison House on Bridge Street, and commissioned local architect Joseph F. Smith to remodel the house and build a two-story annex to house the order. The new mother house opened in 1915, but soon proved too small to provide for retiring sisters or the ongoing education of active sisters. The order hired the Milwaukee form of Brielmaier & Son, of Milwaukee to draw up plans for a new building. Due to financial constraints, the order decided to construct the building in stages. They hired local contractor John McNabb & Sons to build the structure, and began construction in 1917. The first section was one the following year, and a chapel in 1919. With the move back to Grand Rapids, the order again became involved in teaching. They opened a K-12 school in 1918, which by 1920 had grown to 65 students and was accredited by the University of Michigan. The academy steadily grew during the 1920s, and in 1924 the order hired local architect Harry L. Mead to design a laundry/power plant building. In 1927 the original Harrison House burned down. The school continued to grow through the Great Depression and on into the World War II years. In 1944, anticipating a greater need, the sisters built a five-level classroom and residence building, designed by Charles Sullivan of Detroit. However, even this was not enough to meet the baby boom demand, and in 1955 the school discontinued grades 1-6. In 1961, grades 7-8 were discontinued, as well as the boarding school, with only room for the day high school. With the closure of the boarding school, plans were drawn up to convert the 1944 building into only classrooms; before that could be accomplished, though, new living quarters for the sisters need to be constructed. The order hired local architect Roger Allen & Associates to design a two-story addition to the 1944 building. However, 1963 marked peak enrollment in the school. Enrollemnt declined through the remainder of the 1960s, and in In 1972, the order made the decision to phase out the school. Grades 9-10 were eliminated that summer, and the last two graduating classes left in 1973 and 1974. The campus was still used to house retired and invalid sisters. In the 1980s, the order decided to centralize services, and the remaining sisters were moved to new housing in Farmington Hills, Michigan. The complex was vacant for some time, but in 1991, the Grand Rapids Housing Commission purchased the Mt. Mercy complex to provide low-income housing. It was decided that renovating the 1962 wing would be infeasible, and that portion of the complex was razed, and replaced with a anew wing in keeping with the original and the 1940s addition. Another addition was completed in 2001, and the complex continues to provide housing for low-income seniors. Description The Mt. Mercy Apartments consists of three buildings. The main building is a five-story lower-case-h-shaped, five-level, Tudor Revival structure. constructed in multiple stages. The original building (dating from 1918) and chapel wing (1920) have structural steel frames and are faced with dark brown-red brick. The west wing (completed in 1944) is constructed of cast-in-place concrete, and is faced with brick that is slightly lighter than the original. The east wing addition (from 1991) is a reinforced concrete structure, and reflects the size, massing and roof line of the west wing. The east wing is faced with brick of a lighter hue than either of the earlier sections. A 2005 rear addition completes the building. The main building is a five-story Tudor Revival style structure with a squared tower in the front containing the main entrance. Projecting pinnacles and stone tracery are set around the entrance; some of the windows in the tower above contain similar stone tracery. A stone niche with a statue of the Madonna is set above the entrance; above that is the order's blazon. The facade is topped with battlements. The battlements, buttresses, and piers are capped with stone. A gabled roof covered with clay tile covers the building. The foundation is of rough cut stone. The other two buildings are a two-story laundry/power house (built in 1924) clad with brick located just to the north of the chapel wing, and a single-story, frame, brick clad, two-bedroom ranch style house from 1962 located north of main building.

Ghilarov laid emphasis on the soil as a peculiar medium that consisted of a mix of liquid, solid, and gas phases and therefore suggested that it was the zone of evolutionary transition between aquatic and terrestrial life forms. Ghilarov (also spelt Giliarov in English) was born in Kiev and studied entomology at the State University of Kiev from 1929 to 1933 after which he worked for the Ukrainian Plant Protection Station. He later moved to Moscow to work on rubber-bearing plants and then began to study soil insects. He obtained a Ph.D. in 1938 and in 1944 he moved to the Institute of Evolutionary Morphology where he proposed the idea of soil as a transitional environment between aquatic and terrestrial life. He wrote an influential monograph on ‚ÄúThe specificity of soil as insect habitat and its role in insect evolution‚Äù (1949) and in 1956 he founded the first laboratory for soil zoology.

A member of the Left Opposition, he was a defendant at the first Moscow show trials.  Biography  Bakayev was born into a poor peasant family in Saratov province, Russia, and joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party as an 18-year-old, during the 1905 revolution, in Kamyshin - where the local RSDLP branch had not split between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, as it had in other cities, and where he was one of the organisers of an armed uprising. He joined the Bolsheviks in 1906, and worked for them illegally in Baku, Astrakhan, and, from 1910, in St-Petersburg. He was arrested several times, and spent six years in prison altogether. At the time of the February Revolution, in 1917, he was working as a lathe operator in a factory in Petrograd (St Petersburg). During the October Revolution, he was deputy secretary, and later secretary of the Petrograd Soviet. During the Russian civil war, he was a political commissar with the Red Army on the Ural and Petrograd fronts. In September 1919-August 1920, he chairman of the Petrograd Cheka, then, after the Red Army conquest of Siberia, he headed Cheka in the South-East territory.  Persecution of the church  Bakayev returned to Petrograd in 1922. He took charge of the attempt to force the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Veniaman (Benjamin) to recognise the pro-Soviet 'Renovationist' church. He supervised the seizure of church property, and ordered the Metropolitan to rescind the excommunication of renovationist priests. When he refused, the Metropolitan was arrested, tried with 10 others, and executed. (In 1992, he was declared a saint.)  Opposition to Stalin  In 1924-26, Bakayev was chairman of the Communist Party Control Commission for the Leningrad provinceIn December 1925, when a rift between the Leningrad party organisation, headed by Grigory Zinoviev, and supported by Lev Kamenev and the centre, controlled by Josif Stalin, Bakayev backed the opposition. He was expelled from the executive of Cheka on 14 November 1927, and from the Communist Party in December 1927. He then capitulated, along with Zinoviev, Kamenev and the other leaders of the Leningrad opposition, and was readmitted to the communist party in 1928, and held various economic posts.  Arrest and execution  Bakayev was arrested in December 1934, in the wake of the assassination of Sergey Kirov, with other former members of the Leningrad opposition, but where it was announced that there was not enough evidence to bring Zinoviev and others before a court, Bakayev was reported to be under 'further investigation'. He was tried in secret, along with Zinoviev and others, on 16 January 1935, and sentenced to eight years in prison. According to one survivor from the Gulag, Bakayev had co-operated with the NKVD, giving evidence against the other accused, for which he was attacked by old comrades after they had been removed to prison in Chelyabinsk. He was brought back to Moscow to be a defendant at the first Moscow show trial, in August 1936, at which Bakayev 'confessed' to being implicated in the Kirov murder, describing himself as \\"an obedient tool in the hands of Zinoviev and Kamenev (and) an agent of the counter-revolution.\\". Sentenced to death on 24 August, he was shot the following day. Along with his co-defendants, Bakayev was 'rehabilitated' by the USSR Supreme Court on 13 July 1988.  Personality  The writer Victor Serge knew Bakayev in 1919, and wrote that \\"Bakayev was a handsome fellow of about thirty, with the careless appearance of a Russian village accordion player; indeed he liked to wear a smock with an embroidered collar and a coloured border, just like such a player.

An adaptation of John Tatum‚Äôs 1660 Tory farce The Rump, it is set shortly before the Restoration of the Monarchy.  Plot  The play follows important members of the Committee of Safety (a Puritan body that governed England in 1659 before the restoration of Charles II), who Behn portrays as variously inept, greedy or lecherous. Two of the most conniving members, Lord Lambert and Lord Fleetwood, plot against each other to seize the crown. Behn also has two romantic subplots, each involving an unhappily married aristocratic woman and a dashing Cavalier. Lady Lambert (Lambert's wife and the former mistress of Oliver Cromwell. whose widow confronts her in an early scene) is initially a Roundhead but embraces the Royalist cause after falling in love with Loveless. The second woman, Lady Desbro, is a secret Royalist who loves John Freeman. At the end of the play, the King's forces conquer the City of London. Lambert is imprisoned in the Tower of London and Lady Desbro's older husband dies of fright, freeing both women to reunite with their lovers.  Reception  Critics have often interpreted The Roundheads as 'straightforward Tory romp', but some scholars suggest that Behn's portrayal of the warring political factions is more nuanced than it first seems. Melissa Mowry notes that Behn sometimes \\"allows characters associated with republicanism more dignity than we might expect, or at least fails to condemn them as stridently as a royalist might\\". For example, Behn portrayed Elizabeth Cromwell far more sympathetically than John Tatum had in his earlier play. Kimberley Latta argues that Behn's version of Cromwell's widow \\"stands as a rational, intellectually autonomous woman speaking the truth about current affairs in an effort to bring the world in tune with her own understanding of providence\\".

It ended with the Belisarius‚Äô Byzantine force victorious. The Gothic garrison surrendered the town and joined the Byzantines after negotiations. The siege lasted 7 months. Prelude First five years of campaigns in Italy, under Belisarius In 535 the Byzantine Eastern Romans had invaded the Ostrogothic Kingdom. The commanders Belisarius, Mundus and Constantinianus had made swift gains, conquering southern Italy, Sicily, Dalmatia and Illyria. The Goths, having paid the Franks for assistance, then moved against the Byzantine force in Rome with superior numbers. The siege was a Byzantine victory. While the Goths with the help of Burgundian personnel send by the Franks were able to somewhat stabilise the situation the Byzantines were still gaining territory. The Franks were not able to send any actually Frankish personnel as they were also allied to the Byzantines. When the commander Narses was sent to Belisarius assistance with reinforcements political intrigue began taking hold of the campaign. Eventually Narses was sent back and Belisarius prepared to move against Ravenna. A mosaic possibly depicting Belisarius Guarding the way to Ravenna was Auximus, a strongly fortified town atop a hill with a 10,000 strong garrison consisting of some of the most effective Gothic troops. The garrison had been reduced in the summer of 538, when Vacimus borrowed troops from it for his attack on Ancona, defended by the Byzantine general Konon. Although victorious in battle, he failed to take the city. It is unknown if he subsequently returned to Auximum., p. 432. The king of the Ostrogoths, Witigis, had seen the importance of the town and sent them there to delay the attack on Ravenna which was why it had such a strong garrison. Belisarius had prepared a large force of 11,000 troops to overwhelm the garrison. Just before the siege started the garrison sent out a foraging party to gather supplies. At the same time Belisarius sent his subordinates Cyprian and Justinus to besiege Fisula. Siege Somewhere in May or April of 539 Belisarius arrived at the city. The Byzantines began encircling the city by building camps around it. Seeing them in disorder the Goths sallied out somewhere in the late afternoon but after heavy fighting they were forced back into the city. By now the foraging Goths who had been sent out of the city the previous day returned, some managed to sneak through the Byzantine lines but most were killed. Seeing the strength of the fortifications Belisarius decided not to take the city by storm but instead starve the defenders out. =Tightening the Siege= Every day the Goths would leave the safety or the city to get grass for the horses from a patch of lush grass just in front of the wall. Noticing this the Byzantines tried to prevent this from happening. Consequently, a daily battle took place between the Goths trying to forage for grass and the Byzantines trying to prevent them from foraging. Noticing ravines in that area the Goths deployed troops in an ambush. Sending out the foraging party out as usually they charged the Byzantines from the rear when they moved to attack the party. This worked multiple times and allowed the Goths to forage in peace after the Byzantines were repulsed. The sound the Goths made during the fighting was so loud that the Byzantines in the camp could not hear their comrade's calls for help. Procopius suggested to Belisarius that the cavalry trumpets could be used to sound the attack band the infantry trumpets to sound the retreat as they sound very differently. When the Goths tried to ambush the Byzantines again the infantry trumpets sounded and the Byzantines retreated before the ambushing Goths could inflict major losses. This allowed the Byzantines to keep skirmishing with the foraging parties without being annihilated. With the city starving the defenders sent desperate pleas to Witigis who promised to move to their assistance but failed to do so for the time being, probably due to a supply shortage due to widespread crop failure due to the war. =External situation= A coin depicting Theudebert I, the Frankish king who invaded ItalyAt this point the Franks invaded Italy and attack both the Goths and the Byzantines who both thought they moved to their assistance. The Goths suffered far worse from these attacks than the Byzantines. Eventually the Franks retreated because of threats from the Byzantines, a supply shortage and disease which killed up to one third of their force. Around the same time the Huns invaded the empire reaching Constantinople before retreating. A second invasion occurred shortly afterwards, bypassing Byzantine resistance and plundering all of Greece except the Peloponnese. The Persian shah, Khosrow, began intentionally deteriorating Byzantine-Sassanian relations in order to start war. Diplomats sent by the Ostrogoths also arrived in Persia to request the shah to start hostilities with the empire. Recognising these treats the Byzantines tried to make peace with the Goths, their military position in Italy lost priority. =Secret correspondence with Witigis= Witiges depicted on a coinThe Frankish invasion made it impossible for Witigis to support Auximus. The garrison, not having heard of the invasion sent a bribed Byzantine from Narses‚Äô (not the eunuch, another commander named Narses) command to set up correspondence with Witigis. Witigis informed the garrison that he would move as soon as the Franks had fully retreated from Italian soil. Shortly after the garrison sent another message saipying they would have to surrender in 5 days, Witigis again replied that he would some move to their aid. Belisarius did not understand how the Goths resisted that long without surrendering and ordered a Goth to be captured and questioned. Discovering the identity of the messenger Belisarius handed him over to his comrades for punishment who burned him alive. =Attack on the water supply= battle Growing impatient, Belisarius sent an attack to the nearby spring. The spring was located outside of the city but through an underground entrance it supplied the city with water. A wall of shields was used to bring 5 Isaurians to the spring. The Goths thought the Byzantines wanted to storm the wall so they held their fire to let the Byzantines get closer but when they noticed the actual goal they rained down projectiles onto the Byzantines. In a desperate move the Goths launched a sortie, Belisarius ordered his men to attack them. The Byzantines attack uphill and suffered gigantic losses until 7 men from Narses‚Äô command broke through the Gothic lines, possibly fighting harder as to repair their image after the messaging affair. The Byzantines advanced through the gap and drove the Goths back into the city but also retreated themselves afterwards. The Isaurians also retreated, because of superior building techniques used in ancient times the cistern leading water into the city remained intact. In the end the attack was a failure with heavy casualties on the Byzantine side. Belisarius now saw the importance of the spring and ordered it to be poisoned with carcasses and lime. The defenders now only got water from a small well inside the city but despite a water shortage they held out.  Negotiations and Surrender  Now the Byzantine commanders Cyprian and Justinus were victorious in the Siege of Fisula and moved to reinforce Belisarius at Auximus. The leaders of the Fisula garrison were paraded outside the city and the garrison began to negotiate with Belisarius. Initially they demanded to be set free and allowed to leave for Ravenna with all their belongings. Belisarius rejected this as he wanted to move of Ravenna next and he did not want to face these troops who had fought so valiantly again. However Belisarius also wanted to take the city with speed as he could not move of Ravenna with a secure rear without taking the city and wanted to attack Ravenna before the Goths could make a new alliance with the Franks and it was near to the end of the campaigning season. The Byzantine troops demanded plunder so both of the Gothic demands were impossible. Belisarius was unsure of what action to take but eventually a compromise was reached whereby half of the garrison's property would be rewarded to the Byzantine troops, the Goths keeping the rest, and the Goths would join the Byzantine army instead of returning to Witigis. After 7 months the siege was finally over.  Aftermath  Either in late 539 or 540 Belisarius moved against Ravenna, with a secure rear. By chance Byzantine forces under Vitalius approaching the city from north via the Balkan's ran into the grain shipment for the city. Belisarius eventually took the city with a diplomatic deception. By 540 the invasion was over but a plague in the empire and Persian invasion would weaken imperial power and reignite Gothic resistance.

The Karen National Liberation Army and the Mon National Liberation Army have clashed sporadically since 1988, mostly around the Myanmar‚ÄìThailand border at Three Pagodas Pass.  Background  In recent times, the main area of contention involved the alleged illegal lumbering activities conducted by the KNU in areas controlled by the NMSP. The NMSP had announced a ban on lumbering activities to prevent deforestation. Another issue is the control of the area surrounding the Three Pagodas Pass, which allows for the control of trade between Myanmar and Thailand.  Development of the conflict  = First clash in 1988 = The KNLA and the MNLA first clashed in June 1988, in the vicinity of Ye Township and Kyain Seikgyi Township. Despite the formation of a commission of inquiry by the National Democratic Front, an alliance of ethnic armies, to investigate the clashes, tensions between both parties continued to escalate. The KNU had also attacked an outpost of the NMSP within the vicinity of Kyaikmawraw Township. On 23 July 1988, on the eve of supposed peace talks between the KNU and the NMSP, serious fighting took place at Three Pagodas Pass. The battle lasted for 27 days, resulting in serious casualties for both parties, as well as forcing locals to flee from their homes. The NDF once again intervened to end the conflict, which resulted in a ceasefire between both parties and an agreement to split taxation revenue generated from the Three Pagodas Pass. = Resumption of conflict in 2016 = Almost twenty eight years after the initial ceasefire, the two armies once again clashed in Yebyu Township, Tanintharyi Region on 8 September over a land dispute. A local village head reported that the fighting had occurred after soldiers from the KNLA went close to an outpost belonging to the MNLA without prior authorization. The brief fighting resulted in a KNLA soldier being injured. The two parties had entered negotiations to resolve the conflict. Sporadic clashes continued for the next few months over the lack of demarcation between areas controlled by both armies, with both sides accusing the other of territorial invasion. In January 2017, both parties entered talks to settle the dispute, which was mediated by officials from the Tanintharyi Region government. On 24 February 2018, a skirmish broke out between the two armies near Ye Township, Mon State. On 4 March 2018, skirmishes between the two parties were reported in Yebyu Township. The next day, the two parties once again clashed in Mudon Township. On 14 March 2018, the two parties officially agreed to a temporary truce after a meeting at Payathonzu Township to discuss the clashes earlier that month. = Clashes with the DKBA = On 17 and 18 September 2019, the MNLA launched two attacks on a splinter group of the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA). The incident came about after the MNLA issued a deadline for the DKBA splinter group to cease their attempts at setting up a base near the Myanmar‚ÄìThailand border at Three Pagodas Pass, which was controlled by the NMSP. No casualties were reported, and the MNLA seized weapons belonging to the DKBA and detained some of its soldiers. The soldiers were later released by the MNLA on 20 September 2019.

While a number of German units had worn cuff titles as part of their regimental or corps insignia, this was the first World War II operation where a cuff title was awarded as a campaign award.  Eligibility As part of Germany's Balkan campaign, the Wehrmacht invaded the island of Crete on 20 May 1941. About 22,000 paratroopers and mountain troops took part, delivered by transport aircraft, gliders and naval vessels and supported by bomber and fighter aircraft. After two weeks of fierce fighting, the defending Greek and British Commonwealth troops had either surrendered or been evacuated. The cuff title was instituted separately by each of Germany's armed services: * Navy: 14 August 1942; * Luftwaffe: 29 September 1942; * Army: 16 October 1942. While the conditions of eligibility differed between the three services, the broad qualifying criteria were that, between 20 ‚Äì 27 May 1941, a member of the German armed forces would have to: * land on Crete, either by ship, parachute or glider; or * take part in air operations over Crete, including transporting troops; or * be on active service at sea in the Crete theatre of operations. The cuff title was distributed for wear from mid-1943. The deadline for applications was 31 October 1944. Design and wear The cuff title is 32mm wide and consists of a yellow-edged white cloth band, embroidered in yellow silk or cotton thread with the word KRETA flanked on both sides by a spray of acanthus leaves. The design was the same for all three armed services. The band was worn on the lower left sleeve of the uniform, including on greatcoats. Where two or more campaign cuff titles were awarded, the earliest qualified for was correctly worn above later awards, although this regulation was not always followed. Nazi era decorations were banned after the war. The Crete Cuff Title was among those re-authorised for wear by the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957. While many awards were re-designed to remove the swastika, the original cuff title could be worn unaltered as it did not bear this symbol.

Background  In February 1941, the German Africa Corps (DAK) was formed to support Italian forces in the North African campaign against British and Commonwealth forces. Under Erwin Rommel the DAK, supported by Luftwaffe and Naval units, occupied large parts of Libya and Egypt until finally defeated at El Alamein in October 1942. Forced to retreat, and faced with allied landings in Morocco and Algeria, DAK forces either evacuated North Africa or surrendered, with the last German units in Africa capitulating on 13 May 1943. In July 1941 a dark- green cuff title with a white and khaki border inscribed AFRIKAKORPS was authorised, to be worn on the right cuff by members of the DAK who had served a minimum of two months in Africa. This was a corps designation badge, not a campaign award, and personnel who permanently transferred out of the North African theatre no longer had the right to wear it.Cimilitaria.com. Afrikakorps Cuff Title The Luftwaffe later introduced a cuff title of a different design for airmen based in North Africa. As with the Army, this was not intended for wear by those no longer posted to North Africa. There was also a Navy version, that may have been a privately made unofficial item.  Eligibility  On 15 January 1943 the Africa cuff title was instituted by Adolf Hitler as a formal campaign decoration. The final terms of this award required at least six months service in the North African theatre of operations, or any lesser period if the recipient was decorated for bravery, was wounded or if killed ‚Äì in which case a posthumous award was made. Those who contracted a debilitating illness which required evacuation required three months active service prior to illness. After 6 May 1943 the qualifying period of service was reduced from six to four months. The deadline for applications for the cuff title was 31 October 1944. Design and wear The cuff title is a 32mm wide mid-brown camel hair band, bearing the word AFRIKA flanked on both sides by an image of a palm tree and edged top and bottom with a 3mm strip, all embroidered in silver-grey braid or cotton. The design was the same for all three armed services.Note: While Williamson states the Luftwaffe and Navy introduced their own campaign bands, Littlejohn, Cimilitaria.com, Wehrmacht- awards.com and contemporary photos confirm all 3 services used one design, with the distinct Luftwaffe and Navy bands being earlier corps designation badges.

Eligibility  After the allied breakout from Normandy, the U.S. Third Army's advance towards Germany met with heavy resistance at Metz from a hastily assembled Battle Group Siegroth, consisting of miscellaneous Waffen-SS and Army units, with staff and students from the Metz officer cadet school. This resistance helped delay the allied advance towards Germany.Metz 1944. Wehrmacht-awards.com. The cuff title was established on 24 October 1944 by Adolf Hitler. Eligibility was open to all members of Battle Group Siegroth, including soldiers and officials, who had taken part in the fighting at Metz from 27 August to 25 September 1944 for at least seven days, or a lesser time if wounded.Williamson gives 27 July ‚Äì 25 September 1944 as qualifying dates, which conflicts with the dates of the Metz battle which only commenced in September. Although the fighting around Metz continued until December 1944, service after 25 September did not qualify. This later fighting was after the involvement of Battle Group Siegroth, which had borne the brunt of the initial fighting that successfully repulsed the US Army. The cuff title was also intended as a tradition badge (Traditionsabzeichen) to be worn by all future staff and officer cadets of the Metz Cadet School, (Fahnenjunkerschule VI), all the time they were serving there. The school closed before this was implemented. Design and wear The cuff title was a 32mm wide black fabric band, silver-edged, with the embroidered inscription Metz 1944 in silver braid, similar in style to Waffen- SS divisional and regimental cuff titles. It was worn on the lower left sleeve of the uniform, including by members of Nazi party organisations. Where two or more campaign cuff titles were awarded, the earliest qualified for was correctly worn above later awards, although this regulation was not always followed.

Creation and eligibility During the German retreat on the Eastern Front Wehrmacht forces were cut off on the Courland Peninsula in Latvia from July 1944. Renamed Army Group Courland on 25 January 1945, it held out until the end of the war in May 1945. The cuff title was approved on 12 March 1945 by Adolf Hitler, on the recommendation of the commander of the Army Group Courland. It was the last German award to be instituted in World War II. Distribution began in late April 1945. To qualify, a member of Army Group Courland would have to, between 1 September 1944 and 8 May 1945: * participate in at least three combat actions; or * serve a minimum of three months in the pocket; * if wounded, the cuff title could be awarded without fulfilling these criteria. Those qualifying included personnel serving with rear services, including Organisation Todt, provided they served in the pocket for at least three months. Design and wear The regulation design of the cuff title was a 40mm wide silver-grey fabric band with a decorative black border, embroidered in black cotton thread with the word KURLAND between two shields. The left-hand shield bore a cross ending in fleurs de lys ‚Äì the arms of the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights ‚Äì while the shield to the right showed the moose head coat of arms of Mitau, the Courland capital. Due to difficulties in transporting supplies to the Courland Pocket, the award was manufactured locally, initially on hand looms and later by machine. This led to variations in the detail of the design. Printed versions also exist. The band was worn on the lower left sleeve of the uniform jacket. Where two or more campaign cuff titles were awarded, the earliest qualified for was correctly worn above later awards, although this regulation was not always followed.

It was released for Microsoft Windows and OS X in 2015, and for Xbox One in 2017. The story revolves around the minds of people who have suppressed memories of horrible events.  Plot  The players will take over the role of an expert, that was recently hired by the Neurostalgia Institute to treat their patients in a mind jacking process known as neuroprobing. Every patient there suffers from a form of repressed mental trauma. In order to help them resolve their issues, neuroprobing will show the recollections of the repressed memories so that the trauma can be cured. By advancing through and being nearer to the goal, things around will change in hostile ways as their minds are fighting back.  Gameplay Nevermind was designed to be played with devices that support biometric feedback (their usage is optional), because the more the player is under stress, the harder the game becomes. If the player gets scared, certain events will occur (for example, the game screen will become foggy and unsteady, making navigation more difficult). The difficulty decreases by calming down. It uses Intel RealSense for the sensors that can track player's pulse in real-time, and Affectiva's Affdex to recognize emotions and translate that into the game's events. While being inside of a patient's mind, the objective is to find ten photos per client, each representing the parts of their memories. Resembling Myst, Nevermind has some puzzle adventure elements, which consist of navigating environments and solving the puzzles before any progress can be made.  Development Erin Reynolds started with the game's development at the media program for graduate studies at the University of Southern California. For a thesis, Reynolds had a year to develop any kind of game of her choice, which became Nevermind. A team that worked on it created one level, and disbanded after graduation. The following year, Reynolds started a company to build a full version of Nevermind. The aim of the project was to recognize and to help solve the player's anxieties. In early 2014, the developers launched a Kickstarter campaign, asking for $250,000. It ended being unsuccessful, earning $129,615. In October 2014, Nevermind was back for another campaign on Kickstarter, being set at a lower goal of $75,000. The funding was successful with $76,525 being pledged by the backers.

Biography  Born in Oyaya, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, Nala dug her clay locally and created ceramics in the ukhamba (nearly spherical) and uphiso (necked) forms. These ceramic vessels are most well known as beer pots, used for drinking and serving sorghum beer. Nala was taught ceramics by her mother's and grandmother's generations, including from her mother Siphiwe MaS'Khakhane Nala. Nesta Nala's daughters continue her legacy and create ceramics. These daughters include Bongikile, Jabulile, Thembile, Zanele (d. 2006), and Nonhlanhla (d. 2006). Nala influenced many contemporary ceramic artists who have been inspired by the Zulu-speaking ceramic style of creating burnished beer pots. Clive Sithole, a contemporary artist who was born in Soweto and traces his family to the KwaZulu-Natal region, worked with Nesta Nala during his early years and considers her to be a major influence in his career. Ian Garrett, a ceramist living in the Western Cape region, wrote his Master's of Fine Art thesis on Nala and documented Nala's emergence as an artist selling ceramics in urban South Africa, particularly during the 1980s. = Awards = Nesta Nala was included in the Cairo Ceramics Biennale in 1994, the winner of an FNB (First National Bank) Vita Craft Award in 1995, and won first prize at the South African National Ceramics Biennale in 1996.

Initially he worked as a builder, but had to change his occupation when a building designed by architect Gustaf Estlander collapsed in Kaivopuisto in 1907, even though Tanner was not responsible for the disaster. Instead, Tanner became an entertainer and started to perform at the cinematograph Helikon at Kluuvinkatu in Helsinki. There he became good friend with Rafael Ramstedt and Theodor Weissman, with whom he also performed at the capital's restaurants and cafes. Between 1911 and 1926, Tanner recorded 70 songs in Finland, Sweden and Germany. The 1924 recording session was made in Camden, New Jersey. Tanner made a visit in the US in 1922, but the socialistic Finnish American settlers boycotted his performances, because for them Tanner was a symbol for the white Finland. In the 1920s, Tanner was diagnosed with tuberculosis and died at his summer place Nujula in Rautalampi. Some of Tanner's most popular songs are Kulkurin valssi, Orpopopjan valssi, Laulu on iloni ja ty√∂ni and Kalle Aaltonen.

Early life Senko was born on 15 October 1921 to a Ukrainian peasant family in Semenivka. There he completed his tenth grade of school in 1938 before moving on to the Novozybkov State Pedagogical Institute, which he graduated from in 1940; then from September to December that year he worked as a science teacher at a school in the Bryansk oblast, with his short tenure being due to entering the military at the end of the year. He became a member of the Communist Party in 1942. World War II Shortly after the start of Operation Barbarossa, Senko graduated from the Olsufev Military Aviation School of Bombardier-gunners; then he trained at the Taganrog Military Aviation School of Pilots, where he studied until being sent to the front in November. Upon arrival to the warfront as part of the 667th Night Bomber Aviation Regiment, he began flying combat missions on the R-5 bomber, accumulating 80 sorties by September 1942. He then transferred to the 752nd Long-range Aviation Regiment as a navigator; the unit later received the guards designation and was renamed the 10th Guards Long-range Aviation Regiment in March 1943. Soon upon arrival to the unit he flew 3-4 sorties per day on the Stalingrad front. During one mission he successfully led his crew to a large Axis airfield that contained up to 200 enemy bombers, which they then bombed. Later that day he flew in a mission that resulted in the destruction of a railway station. Bad weather and night-flying conditions did not stop Senko from leading the bomber; on one mission his crew was unable to fly above a thunderstorm, yet he still was able to help them reach the target. In his nomination for the title Hero of the Soviet Union, which was filed in January 1943, it was noted that he flew in 154 sorties, with all but ten of them being at night. For much of his time he flew under pilot Dmitry Barashev, who later died in a plane crash in summer 1943; Senko was not in the crash because he stopped flying as part of Barashev's crew in the spring. After the Battle of Stalingrad he continued flying in combat, in not just bombing missions but also in supply deliveries to partisans and reconnaissance flights. That summer he began finding targets for other crews of the 2nd Guards Long-Range aviation corps that were not part of his regiment. Within his regiment, he was tasked with photographing the aftermath of bombing flights. After the reformation of long-range aviation regiments into bomber regiments in December 1944, the 10th Guards Long-range Aviation Regiment became the 226th Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment. As a flight navigator in that unit, he participated in the battles for Warsaw, Koenigsberg, and Berlin. He was praised by his superiors for never becoming disoriented and finding the precise location of targets. At the time of his second nomination for a gold star he had flown 402 sorties, with 392 of them being at night, and by the end of the war he totaled 430 sorties, of which 83 were on the R-5 and the remaining 347 on the Il-4. Postwar Senko remained a squadron navigator in his wartime regiment until August 1947, and in 1952 he graduated from the Air Force Academy, after which he was posted to the 84th Separate Heavy Bomber Aviation Corps where he continued to work as a navigator.

It is believed that the artworks were made by the Khoikhoi or the San people between 1100 AD and 1700 AD. The paintings are found on five cliff areas around the rocky hill. Today, the site is fenced and protected as a National Monument.  Geography  The paintings cover 5 separate rock surfaces, along approximately 750 meters of the base of the Kolobeng hills, 1.2 km above sea level. The site is close to the village of Manyana, Southern district but lies within the borders of the Kweneng district.  Artworks  The paintings include designs of mammals, plants and abstract shapes. All of the mammals were portrayed sideways with only two legs, except human figures, most of which seem to face forward. It is believed that the paintings were created by witch doctors as part of religious activities. These rituals also incorporate dancing as an attempt to connect with the spirits of ancestors. The ink used for the paintings were created by mixing soft rocks like bauxite and animal body fluids like blood. Due to natural weathering, a lot of the paintings have faded. As a result, the number of tourists visiting the site have declined. Archaeology Rock paintings are scarce in southeast Botswana and the Manyana Rock Paintings are the only ones that have been excavated. Artifacts recovered from excavations suggest that the earliest occupation of this area took place between the 1st century and the 8th century, during the Later Stone Age. The Iron Age pottery uncovered suggests that the locals made their first contact with Iron Age herders between the 10th century and the 13th century. Excavations uncovered more than 7000 Later Stone Age artifacts, more than 95% are debitage. The remaining 5% is made up of scrapers, grindstones, hammerstones and crescents. Other unearthed items include quartz slivers, specularite, bones, glass, Iron Age potshreds and 19th century porcelain. = Mmasechele Cave = Mmasechele Cave In 1852, a group of four Batswana tribes, led by Sechele I, Kgosi (chief) of the Bakwena tribe, fought against the Boers in the Battle of Dimawe. There was an attempt to refuge and relocate the women and children in the area. The third wife of Sechele fled and hid in the Mmasechele cave. There are no historical records regarding how long the women took shelter for but she managed to survive until the war ended in 1853.

Taxonomy The description as a new species was published in 2014, separating a population previously assigned to the species Miniopterus schreibersii. The cryptic species within the M. schreibersii population was distinguished by characteristics of the cranium and dentition and molecular evidence of a distinct phylogeny. Description A species of Miniopterus, known as bent or long winged bats, closely resembling M. schreibersii in its superficial characteristics of morphology and acoustic signals. The species enters a state of torpor in winter months, allowed by the fat reserves stored in the body during the preceding months. Distribution and habitat Miniopterus maghrebensis occurs in North Africa, associated in the name to the Maghreb region. The distribution range extends from Tunisia to the west, south of the Atlas Mountains, through Algeria and Morocco. They have been found in dry forest and shrubland associated with a Mediterranean climate, and known to inhabit caves. The number of locations within this range is limited to a few known sites, perhaps extending to suitable habit in other Mediterranean regions. The species is sympatric with M. schreibersii at near coastal regions of the African continent. The IUCN Red List classifies this species as near threatened by extinction, and trajectory of the population as unknown. Primary threatening factors are loss of the extent and quality of natural habitat. The use of caves and other subterranean habitats for daytime roosts and extended periods of hibernation has exposed the species to interruption by human activity. The use of pesticides for agriculture and forestry may also be a threatening factor to the species population.

It runs roughly from Kinburn Side Road southeast to the village of Carp and the South March Highlands at March Road. The hills cover roughly and are mostly undeveloped. The ridge is an extension of the Canadian Shield, with a landscape that is characterized by a mix of rocky outcrops, grassland, marshes, numerous shallow ponds, and patches of mature forest. Its pristine rugged nature has been compared to the nearby Gatineau Park and is regarded as an \\"ecological jewel\\". The Carp Ridge is used for hiking, hunting, cross- country skiing, and snowmobiling. Among the few walking and hiking trails on the ridge are the Crazy Horse trail, a loop trail starting at March Road, and pathways at Hidden Lake Park in the village of Carp. Geology The hills are an outcrop of Precambrian bedrock, unique in the city of Ottawa, which otherwise is relatively flat. Its geology is complex, consisting of gneiss, granite, and marble substrates, and it supports a number of vegetation- landform ecologies, such as mature deciduous and mixed highland forest and mixed and coniferous lowland forest, which are rare in the area and southeastern Ontario. Typical to Canadian Shield, it has rolling terrain with highly irregular drainage and a thin soil cover with barren vegetation. A section of the hills, the Carp Barrens, spread along both sides of Thomas Dolan Parkway, is characterized by the \\"most extensive, best-expressed complex of granite bedrock barrens\\", not only on the Carp Ridge, but also in southern Ontario east of the Thousand Islands ‚Äì Frontenac Arch. The western side of the hills are an exposed fault, creating a ridge that provides good views of the surrounding rural countryside. The gneiss at the Carp Barrens contains mica, and 2 small mines once operated there. Carp Ridge as seen from the east Environment The hills have a high biodiversity of more than 600 species of plants and animals, including species at risk. Its wetlands contribute clean water year round to the Carp River through surface streams and underground aquifers, which in turn provide the water supply to local wells. =Flora= The diversity of vegetation is exceptional. Almost 180 taxa can be found, including several populations of provincially rare and regionally rare taxa. Among the tree species present are white pine, white spruce, red maple, sugar maple, trembling aspen, white birch, large-toothed aspen, red oak, bur oak, and common juniper. Other vegetation found in the hills are orchids (including the regionally significant showy orchid (Galearis spectabilis), downy rattlesnake plantain, (Goodyera pubescens), checkered rattlesnake plantain (Goodyera tesselata), and spotted coralroot (Corallorhiza maculata), ricegrass (Oryzopsis racemosa), bottlebrush grass (Elymus hystrix), tick-trefoil (Desmodium glutinosum), blueberry (Vaccinium spp.) and staghorn sumac (Rhus typhina), as well as 13 species of liverworts, 69 species of mosses, and 25 species of lichens. Heron rookery in the Carp Hills =Fauna= Wildlife include coyote, white-tailed deer, black bear, beaver, porcupine, Blanding's turtle, midland painted turtle, chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and squirrels. Bird species include songbirds, waterfowl, and birds of prey, such as herons, red- tailed hawk, common nighthawk, chestnut-sided warbler, eastern whip-poor-will, field sparrow, golden-winged warbler, indigo bunting, northern shrike, pileated woodpecker, great horned owl, and eastern towhee. Conservation The environmental importance of the ridge has been recognized since at least 1971 when it was mapped as a \\"proposed conservation area\\" with a similar area as the Mer Bleue Conservation Area on the east side of Ottawa. But under pressure by landowners, the designation was withdrawn. In 2012, the updated NCC Master Plan identified the Carp Hills as a significant natural area, and recommended a natural corridor to connect the ridge to the Ottawa Greenbelt via the South March Highlands. While the hills, as well as the barrens separately, have been designated as a candidate Area of Natural and Scientific Interest (ANSI) by the provincial government and has many Provincially Significant Wetlands (PSW), it was not until 2018 that an area was protected. That year Ducks Unlimited purchased a parcel of land near the village of Carp for conservation. The city of Ottawa owns several pieces of non-contiguous land totalling , designated as Natural Environment Area, but the rest of the ridge is privately owned and unprotected, although zoning bylaws place some limitations on development.

It was primarily known for its work as a major contractor for the Keating National Space Program that took place between 1986 and 1996. In 2007 Auspace was acquired by the Nova Group, and was absorbed completely into the two10degrees subsidiary in 2019.  History  Even before the National Space Program, Auspace was a large player in the Australian space industry, managing parts of the multi-million dollar UV-optical space telescope Starlab project. The working relationship formed with the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce under the project would be beneficial when the National Space Program commenced a few years later in 1986. Under the National Space Program, Auspace received 28% of all funds distributed, the most of any company besides British Aerospace Australia. Under the program Auspace developed instruments for CSIRO, Hispasat, Locstar, and multiple other major projects. In December 1988 Auspace was sold to Plessey Australia. After the bankruptcy of Plessy later that year, Auspace was bought by Matra Marconi Space. In 1992 the Auspace built Endeavour satellite made its inaugural launch, but failed to fulfill the mission requirements. In 1995 the satellite was successfully relaunched. In 2007 Auspace was purchased by the Nova Group. In 2019 it was merged with two10degrees.

Taimi is available in 45 countries including the United States, Canada, Australia Singapore and Brazil.  History  Taimi was launched in 2017 by Social Impact Inc. in Las Vegas. According to several publications, that is where a group of developers, including Taimi's founder Alex Pasykov came up with a name for the dating app ‚ÄúTame Me‚Äù which gradually morphed into Taimi. Although Taimi was founded in the United States, the application started to grow in popularity elsewhere, especially in Europe. On October 31, 2018, Taimi announced the launch in the United Kingdom. On July 20, 2019, Taimi launched in the Netherlands, Spain and Spanish-speaking countries in Central and South America followed.  Social Responsibility  Taimi founder and team expressed the desire to fight state-sponsored homophobia around the world. According to the Alex Pasykov, Taimi plans to partner up with several NGOs to fight state-sponsored homophobia. Some studies have mentioned that Taimi is one of the safest dating apps for LGBTQI+ people. Recently, Taimi partnered up with UNAIDS and LGBT Foundation in support of a ground breaking LGBTI survey. The company has been a partner of several Pride marches and parades including Los Angeles Pride, New York City Pride, Las Vegas Pride.

Taimi also has a digest available to everyone as well as video calls and stories. = Paid subscription = Taimi XL is a premium paid version of Taimi. It has been met with controversy with several users claiming the charges were too high. The paid version allows users to hide their identity, and send unlimited chat requests and rollbacks.  Reception  The paid subscription is one of the crucial issues for the app. Many users have called to lower the cost of Taimi XL or eliminate it altogether. Taimi refuses to eliminate the feature and states that the basic version of the app is free. Overall the response to the app is positive. However, most reviewers choose to focus on the dating aspect rather than the social network part.  Controversy  In 2018 the app was met with a negative response from LGBTQI+ activists after an article published and shared by several other media outlets focused on a filter that allowed Taimi users to block each other based on HIV status. Taimi swiftly removed the filter and that option is no longer available. Taimi also encountered controversy on social media with some complaining about its pushy advertising strategies.

Early life McAdam was born in Ayr, Scotland around 1725. He was a son of James McAdam and Margaret (n√©e Reid) McAdam. His brother James McAdam, Baron of Waterhead, was one of the founders of the first bank in Ayr in 1763. He was a direct descendant of Gilbert McAdam, \\"a zealous covenantor\\" who was killed by the Royalists in 1685 while \\"attending a prayer- meeting at Kirkmichael in Ayrshire.\\" Career Early in his life, he came to America and established a trading and merchant business. By 1766, he had a warehouse on Smith Street, near the New Dutch Church, where he sold \\"Iron- bound Butts & Puncheons, genuine Batavia Arrack in Bottles, Frontinjack, Priniack & Madeira, etc.\\" During the height of his career, he brought his nephew John Loudon McAdam (son of brother James) over to New York to work as a merchant and prize agent in his counting house. His nephew later returned to Scotland and became a well-known civil engineer and road-builder who invented the process known as \\"macadamisation\\", an economical method of constructing roads. During the American Revolution, McAdam was one of fifty-one committee of correspondence members that met in May 1774 at the Fraunces Tavern \\"in order to consult on measures proper to be pursued on the present critical and important situation\\" due to the British announcement that the port of Boston would be closed under the Boston Port Act. However, McAdam, who was in \\"sympathy with the Crown,\\" took steps to regulate the revival of trade in the Port of New York in 1779. After the Patriots defeated the British, his property was confiscated and he lost practically all of his fortune. Personal life On December 12, 1764, McAdam was married to Ann Dey, daughter of Dirck Dey and Jane Dey. Her father was a Dutch born planter, purchased 600 acres of land in Preakness Valley, now Wayne Township, and her brother, Col. Theunis Dey, built the Dey Mansion there in the 1770s. McAdam was a founder and original member of the New York Chamber of Commerce, serving as its treasurer and vice president. He was also elected a member of the Saint Andrew's Society of the State of New York in 1761 and served as Assistant from 1765 to 1766, vice-president from 1771 to 1772 and president from 1772 to 1773. McAdam died on October 1, 1779 in New York City.

Siverson, and James D. Morrow, published by MIT Press. It discusses the selectorate theory of politics. Paul Warwick of Simon Fraser University wrote that the book is \\"an extraordinary attempt to answer some very big questions\\" and \\"much more than its title suggests\\" due to its incorporation of other elements related to war, economics, and nation-building.Warwick, p. 1035.

Background Each author is in the political science profession. Contents The authors discuss Hume's Discourses from Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary and Leviathan and decide that the philosophy in Discourses results in better governance. The book includes three parts, with each consecutive one discussing theories of governance, an analysis of how the selectorate model can determine in advance a result, and possible impacts regarding politics and international relations, respectively.Choice reviews.

In regards to the latter, due to the potential further research questions posed, Mineshima described it as a \\"work still in progress\\". He stated that the usage of mathematical models may intimidate people not with a background in that topic, and that references to other chapters may reducing \\"clarity\\" while also \\"providing continuity\\"; he argued the latter was therefore \\"both a strength and a weakness\\".Mineshima, p. 1158‚Äì1159.

He was the eldest son of Duncan Grant (d. 1582) and Margaret Mackintosh. John Grant became head of the family when his grandfather died in 1592. Feud Freuchie joined in a feud between the Earl of Huntly and the Earl of Moray, over the marriage of John Gordon, son of the laird of Cluny, to the widow of the Grant of Ballindalloch. One of Gordon's servants was killed by John Grant, former Tutor of Ballindaloch, the administrator of the estate. The Earl of Huntly went to Ballindalloch in November 1590 to arrest the Tutor. John Grant of Freuchie promised to deliver the Tutor and his accomplices, accused of murder and other crimes, to Huntly Castle. However, Freuchie joined with the Tutor's men and the Earl of Moray, and came to Forres and Darnaway Castle, and there shot pistols at Huntly's officers and cannon from the castle, and killed John Gordon of Birsmoir, brother of the Laird of Cluny.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1585-1592, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), pp. 569-71.

Thus, Akbar had a claim to the province. Baz Bahadur had been the governor of Malwa in the Sur Empire but broke away after the death of Sher Shah. The conquest was led by Akbar's foster brother Adham Khan and the general Pir Muhammad Khan. They defeated Baz Bahadur at the Battle of Sarangpur in 1561, when his Afghan forces deserted him. The Mughals occupied the capital Mandu, perpetrating massacres on the populace, according to the historian Badauni, and appropriating the wealth and harem of the Sultan. Akbar himself intervened, riding to Malwa and removing Adham Khan from governorship of the province, seizing his spoils. He sent Pir Muhammad Khan south to give chase to Baz Bahadur. Adham Khan is said to have desired the Sultan of Malwa's wife Roopmati, who committed suicide by consuming poison rather than be taken by the Mughal military commander. After the conquest, Baz Bahadur fled Malwa to Khandesh, and was there pursued by Mughal military commander Pir Muhammad Khan who occupied Burhanpur, the capital of the area. However, Khan was defeated and killed by a coalition of Baz Bahadur, Khandesh Sultanate, and Berar Sultanate, leading to Baz Bahadur regaining Malwa for a brief period in 1562 before renewed Mughal attacks. Akbar sent Abdullah Khan Uzbeg to recover Malwa. Baz Bahadur again escaped, first to the hills of Gondwara to conduct guerilla warfare, then seeking shelter with Udai Singh II in 1568. Meanwhile, Abdullah Khan became governor of Malwa. Baz Bahadur finally surrendered to the Mughals in 1570 and was awarded a mansabdari of 2,000 by Akbar, becoming a part of the Mughal nobility. The conquered areas were later organized into the Malwa Subah. Additional images Baz Bahadur fleeing Mandu after losing to the Mughals in 1561.

Formed in 2015 by mostly Kurdish mujahideen from Syria, Turkey, Iran, and Iraq, the group mostly operates in northwestern Syria.  History  The Movement of Salah al-Din the Kurd was founded by Kurdish militants who had been involved in the Syrian Civil War since 2012, many of whom had taken part in notable battles such as the Battle of Aleppo (2012‚Äì2016), Battle of Raqqa (March 2013), Battle of Idlib (2015), Northwestern Syria offensive (April‚ÄìJune 2015), and the battles for Latakia Governorate. On 21 September 2015, these veterans officially unified with the aim of ending the suppression of the Kurdish people and to return them to their perceived Islamic roots; on this basis, the Movement of Salah al-Din the Kurd takes inspiration from Jaban al- Kurdi, a Kurdish companion of Muhammad, and Saladin, founder of the Ayyubid dynasty. Following its foundation, the group specialised in sniper and infiltration tactics, while continuing to participate in combat operations in Latakia. By 2019, the group primarily operated in Jabal al-Akrad, and the al- Ghab Plain. It has fought alongside other rebel groups against the Syrian government's Northwestern Syria offensive from April 2019.  Ideology  The militia espouses a Sunni Salafi jihadist ideology and attaches great value to the unity of the ummah (Islamic community). It consequently has implored the Syrian rebels to stay united in the face of the government. Members of the group have been taught by jihadist cleric Abdul Razzaq al-Mahdi. The Movement of Salah al-Din the Kurd also regards itself as a Kurdish movement, and the protection of the rights of Kurds is one its main goals. The group has admitted that it is not supported by the majority of Kurds in Syria (who mainly back the secular Syrian Democratic Forces) and attributes this to its low profile. The militia has also voiced support for the Syrian opposition's civil councils, the spread of education (including non-Sharia education), and relief for orphans, widows, as well as IDPs.

Early life Johnston was born on January 22, 1781 at Barnboard Mill in the Parish of Balmaghie, Gallowayshire, Scotland. He was a son of John Johnston and Dorothea (n√©e Proudfoot) Johnston, who married in 1780. After his mother's death in June 1794, his father remarried to Margaret Rae in 1795, and Johnston, an only child of his parents' marriage, became the elder brother to ten half-siblings, including brothers William, Robert, Samuel, and sisters Agnes and Margaret, as well as uncle to John Taylor Sherman. His paternal grandparents were William Johnston and Janet (n√©e McCreedy) Johnston and he was educated in the neighboring village of Laurieston, and also at Boreland. Career In 1804, at twenty-two years old, he came to New York and became a bookkeeper in Robert Lenox's counting house. After nine years with Lenox and Maitland, Johnston and partner James Boorman established the merchant house known as Boorman, Johnston, & Co. in 1813. The new firm, based at 57 South Street, sold Scotch goods and, later, tobacco from Virginia and wines from Madeira and Italy. They also owned an iron warehouse at 119 Greenwich Street and in 1828, admitted Adam Norrie as a partner. Johnston was elected a member of the Saint Andrew's Society of New York in 1811 and served as manager from 1819 to 1823, second vice-president from 1823 to 1827, first vice-president from 1827 to 1828 and as president from 1831 to 1832. In 1839, Johnston and several other civic-minded New Yorkers founded University of the City of New York (today known as New York University). He was also a co-founder of Washington Square North. Personal life On September 2, 1817, Johnston was married to Margaret (n√©e Taylor) Howard (1784‚Äì1879), a widow of Rhesa Howard Jr. (himself a nephew of William Few, Signer of the U.S. Constitution from Georgia whose brother-in-law was U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin).Museum of the City of New York His wife Margaret, the daughter of John Taylor and Margaret (n√©e Scott) Taylor, had four siblings who, likewise, married two grandchildren, a great-granddaughter, and a nephew of founding father Roger Sherman, Signer of the U.S. Constitution and the U.S. Declaration of Independence from Connecticut. Together, John and Margaret were the parents of: * John Taylor Johnston (1820‚Äì1893), who married Frances Colles (1826‚Äì1888), the daughter of Harriet (n√©e Wetmore) Colles and James Colles, a prominent merchant in New York and New Orleans.Finding aid for the Colles Family Papers (1801-1957), MssCol 17772, New York Public Library, Humanities and Social Sciences Library, Manuscripts and Archives Division. * Andrew Taylor Johnston (1821‚Äì1821), who died in infancy. * James Boorman Johnston (1822‚Äì1887), who commissioned the Tenth Street Studio Building at 51 West 10th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. * Margaret Taylor Johnson (1825‚Äì1875), who married John Bard (a grandson of Dr. Samuel Bard) in 1849 and became founders of Bard College. * Emily Proudfoot Johnston (1827‚Äì1831), who died in infancy.

Taxonomy It was first described by Francis Jeffrey Bell in 1881 from a collection made before 1873 in Japanese waters. A synonym, Allasterias forficulosa, was described by Addison Emery Verrill in 1914 from a collection made in Japan in 1913 (see image).Gall L (2019). Invertebrate Zoology Division, Yale Peabody Museum. Yale University Peabody Museum. Occurrence dataset https://doi.org/10.15468/0lkr3w accessed via GBIF.org on 2019-11-18. https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1269525403 In 1930 Walter Kenrick Fisher subsumed it as a forma of Asterias amurensis, and further stated that A. rollestoni might well intergrade with A. versicolor to the south of its range. He synonymised Verrill's Allasterias forficulosa with his A. amurensis f. rollestoni and stated Sladen's specimens of A. amurensis also belonged to this form. In 1936, and subsequently in 1940, Ryori Hayashi followed Fisher's interpretation, in 1940 even subsuming Asterias versicolor as a form of A. amurensis. In 1950, however, Alexander Michailovitsch Djakonov recognized it as a full species again. Subsequent authors such as Djakonov (1958), Baranova & Wu (1962), Chang & Liao (1964), Baranova (1971) and Jangoux & Lawrence (2001) upheld this interpretation. Description It has five arms and a moderately-sized central disc. The arm length is up to 12 cm; the ratio between the length of the arm and the radius of its disc is usually 4:1 to 4.5:1. It has planktonic larvae. In 1914 Verrill found it most resembling A. rathbuni, from which it differs by virtue of less dense spines near the mouth, but longer and larger spines dorsally and marginally, and larger and more numerous pedicellaria. He states it is to a lesser degree similar to A. versicolor, differing from this species by having more spines and longer and sharper pedicellaria, but at the same time also considered Allasterias forficulosa, a taxon he created in 1914 but now considered a synonym of Asterias rollestoni, closer resembling to A. versicolor. In 1930 Fisher stated that Asterias rollestoni might well intergrade with A. versicolor to the south of its range, and in 1940 Hayashi also found it to be most closely related to A. versicolor. Distribution and habitat According to Djakonov it has been collected at depths of 5-96m. It is found in the littoral zone from the east in the seas around Japan, west to the Sea of Japan and further to the Yellow Sea, and north through the Peter the Great Gulf (Primorsky Krai) to off the coast of De-Kastri in Khabarovsk Krai. It is among the most common starfish of Chinese seawaters. Behaviour Asterias rollestoni can grow back its limbs should it lose them. This begins four days after amputation, when cells near the end of the stump de-differentiate and migrate to the wound where they form a thickened skin which gradually re-differentiates into mature tissue. Uses It is considered useful in traditional medicine in China and is in the 2015 Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China.

Early life He studied the German language and literature in Vienna and French in Paris. He earned his first doctorate in ViennaDissertation: Darstellungsweisen der Unmenschlichkeit und Grausamkeit in der Literatur zum Ersten und Zweiten Weltkrieg. He worked for three years as a German teacher at the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture at Kolkata. He secured his second Ph D from Visva Bharati University. It was a dissertation on comparative religious study of Sri Ramakrishna, the 19th century Indian mystic-saint and Saint Francis of Assisi, the 11-12th century Italian saint. That brought him to Santiniketan in 1980. He took an instant liking to the place and has never since left it for a long period at a stretch. At Santiniketan At Santiniketan, he has learnt Bengali, and has been translating Rabindranath Tagore and Sri Ramakrishna directly from Bengali to German, and Swami Vivekananda from English to German. He lives in Purba Palli but spends a lot of time at Ghosaldanga, a tribal village, 8 km from the town. There he has facilitated the establishment of a Santali medium school for the village children. He regularly cycles to Ghoshaldanga and back to Purba Palli. Translating Tagore into German In his correspondence with William Rothenstein, ‚ÄúRabindranath later revealed his anxiety about having achieved the Nobel Prize, and with it world fame, with poetic products which were quite inferior to his original Bengali poetry‚Äù. K√§mpchen was also adequately aware of the different mental back-drop of the Bengali and European readers. While the nuances of Tagore's poetry were natural for the Bengali readers, it was much more complex for the European readers. However, what buoyed him was the interest some German publishers, engaged in publishing religious books, had shown in Tagore because in Europe he still feeds on the reputation of being a ‚Äúmystic‚Äù and ‚Äúsage‚Äù. After Tagore was awarded the Nobel Prize, the English version of Gitanjali was swiftly translated into several European languages. The German version was published in 1914. K√§mpchen had contributed a piece Rabindranath Tagore and Germany: An Overview in the compilation Tagore ‚Äì At Home in the World edited by Sanjukta Dasgupta and Chinmoy Guha. The Introduction mentions that the article traced the journey of remembering Tagore in Germany through translations. K√§mpchen's translations started with what appeared to be easier poems, but that included some from Gitanjali, which were not easy at all. Santiniketan offered an advantage ‚Äì there were people ready to assist and support. He studied the translations of Helene Meyer- Franck and Alokeranjan Dasgupta, both of whom had translated Tagore from Bengali to German. There was Ketaki Kushari Dyson, poet, novelist and translator (Bengali to English), whose comment that nobody who is not a poet is able to translate Rabindranath's poems competently had somewhat disturbed K√§mpchen. The publication of Selected Poems of Rabindranath Tagore, translated from Bengali to English by William Radice inspired him. K√§mpchen's first publication in German translation was a collection of one hundred poems from Tagore's Sphulinga, Lekhan and Konika. It was followed by a selection of fifty poems, published as a paper-back. The book sold 7,000 copies and created a lot of interest in literary circles and the media. The third volume contained mostly translations from Gitanjali and Sisu. These books were published by publishing houses engaged in publishing religious books. He then came out with a selection of Tagore's love poems, from Insel Verlag, a publishing house well known in the literary field. A volume of Selected Works of Rabindranath Tagore was published as part of a well-established series, Winkler World Literature. The compilation had poems, short stories, essays, a bunch of letters and conversations with Albert Einstein. The translations were by several persons and all of K√§mpchen's poetry translations were included. K√§mpchen says, ‚ÄúThe poet (Rabindranath Tagore) I felt had, finally, arrived in Germany! At long last he was regarded as a figure of world literature on a par with Shakespeare, Tolstoy and Dante.‚Äù Work on Tagore‚Äôs visits to Germany Along with his efforts to translate Tagore into German, K√§mpchen started working on Tagore's visits to Germany. Tagore had visited Germany thrice and met many people there with whom he carried on correspondence later in life. Rabindra Bhavana archives had material in German, which probably no one had paid any serious heed. Then there were materials scattered across Germany. He spent many years in going through them. When he was working on these, the 50th year of Tagore's death anniversary (1991) was drawing close. Max M√ºller Bhavan, Kolkata, planned a series of events to mark it. After discussions, they got interested in launching a book on the occasion. A hurriedly produced book Rabindranath Tagore and Germany: A Documentary, edited by Martin K√§mpchen was the result. He was awarded the Rabindra Puraskar by the Government of West Bengal in 1992. He later wrote Rabindranath Tagore in Germany ‚Äì Four Responses to a Cultural Icon, which was more mature and complete. Amongst the many interesting persons K√§mpchen met during the period was Alex Aronson, a teacher and author who had written Rabindranath through Western Eyes. Other activities K√§mpchen is a prolific writer. He has produced critical items on Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Rabindranath Tagore, Herman Hesse, G√ºnter Grass and others. He has produced a collection of short stories woven around his travels across India, a novel based on his experience in Ghoshaldanga, written a book for children based in the Himalaya and other creative pieces. He has been a free lance contributor to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a German daily, and other newspapers. Martin K√§mpchen was awarded the first Merck Tagore Award in 2012 in recognition of his contribution to Indo-German cultural understanding.

It aims at creating loosely coupled application components that can be easily connected to their software environment by means of ports and adapters. This makes components exchangeable at any level and facilitates test automation.  Origin  The hexagonal architecture was invented by Alistair Cockburn in an attempt to avoid known structural pitfalls in object-oriented software design, such as undesired dependencies between layers and contamination of user interface code with business logic, and published in 2005. The term \\"hexagonal\\" comes from the graphical conventions that shows the application component like a hexagonal cell. The purpose was not to suggest that there would be six borders/ports, but to leave enough space to represent the different interfaces needed between the component and the external world.  Principle  Example of hexagonal architecture The hexagonal architecture divides a system into several loosely- coupled interchangeable components, such as the application core, the database, the user interface, test scripts and interfaces with other systems. This approach is an alternative to the traditional layered architecture. Each component is connected to the others through a number of exposed \\"ports\\". Communication through these ports follow a given protocol depending on their purpose. Ports and protocols define an abstract API that can be implemented by any suitable technical means (e.g. method invocation in an object-oriented language, remote procedure calls, or Web services). The granularity of the ports and their number is not constrained: * a single port could in some case be sufficient (e.g. in the case of a simple service consumer) ; * typically, there are ports for event sources (user interface, automatic feeding), notifications (outgoing notifications), database (in order to interface the component with any suitable DBMS), and administration (for controlling the component); * in an extreme case, there could be a different port for every use case, if needed. Adapters are the glue between components and the outside world. They tailor the exchanges between the external world and the ports that represent the requirements of the inside of the application component. There can be several adapters for one port, for example if data can be provided by a user through a GUI or a command-line interface, by an automated data source, or by test scripts.  Usage, criticism and evolution  According to Martin Fowler, the hexagonal architecture has the benefit of using similarities between presentation layer and data source layer to create symmetric components made of a core surrounded by interfaces, but with the drawback of hiding the inherent asymmetry between a service provider and a service consumer that would better be represented as layers. According to some authors, the hexagonal architecture is at the origin of the microservices architecture.  Variants  The onion architecture proposed by Jeffrey Palermo in 2008 is similar to the hexagonal architecture: it also externalizes the infrastructure with proper interfaces to ensure loose coupling between the application and the database. It decomposes further the application core into several concentric rings using inversion of control. The clean architecture proposed by Robert C. Martin in 2012 combines the principles of the hexagonal architecture, the onion architecture and several other variants; It provides additional levels of detail of the component, which are presented as concentric rings. It isolates adapters and interfaces (user interface, databases, external systems, devices) in the outer rings of the architecture and leaves the inner rings for use cases and entities,. The clean architecture uses the principle of dependency inversion with the strict rule that dependencies shall only exist between an outer ring to an inner ring and never the contrary.

He became one of the most powerful men in Andalusia, but after the death of Queen Isabella I of Castile (1451‚Äì1504) supported her daughter Joanna of Castile (1479‚Äì1555)) against King Ferdinand II of Aragon (1452‚Äì1516), who was regent of Castile. After serious disturbances in C√≥rdoba in 1508 he was forced to throw himself on the king's mercy, and was arrested and exiled. Later he was pardoned and allowed to return. Origins The House of C√≥rdoba, or of Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, originated with the T√©mez and Mu√±oz houses, two Castilian-Leon noble houses of the second order who moved up the social ladder during the reconquest and repopulation of the Guadalquivir valley in Andalusia. The T√©mez family originated in Galicia, and included Nu√±o Fern√°ndez, lord of T√©mez and Chantada during the reigns of Ferdinand II of Le√≥n, Alfonso IX of Le√≥n and Ferdinand III of Castile. Nu√±o accompanied Ferdinand III in the reconquest of Andalusia and gained distinction in the battles of Baeza, Ja√©n, C√≥rdoba and Seville. Nu√±o's second son Fern√°n N√∫√±ez (died 1283) participated in the capture of C√≥rdoba, and was rewarded with extensive lands in Seville and C√≥rdoba. He may be considered founder of the House of C√≥rdoba. Fern√°n N√∫√±ez married Ora Mu√±oz, daughter of Domingo Mu√±oz, alcaide of And√∫jar, first alguacil mayor of Seville and first alcaide of the town of Dos Hermanas. Domingo Mu√±oz had also played an outstanding role in the reconquest of Andalusia in the battles of And√∫jar, √öbeda, Baeza, C√≥rdoba and Seville. The son of Fern√°n N√∫√±ez and Ora Mu√±oz was Alfonso Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba (died 1327), 2nd lord of the House of C√≥rdoba, and the first to use the city's name as his family name. His first son, Fernando Alfonso de C√≥rdoba (died 1343), 1st lord of Ca√±ete de las Torres, was the king's Alcaide de los donceles, a hereditary position that was soon passed to another branch of the family. His second son, Mart√≠n Alfonso de C√≥rdoba, founded the branch of Lords of Montemayor, the origin of the Counts of Alcaudete. The first son of Fernando Alfonso de C√≥rdoba was Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba (died 1384) obtained Aguilar de la Frontera from Henry II of Castile. He was succeeded by Alfonso Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba II (died 1424), who served in military actions on the border. Priego's uncle, Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba (the Gran Capit√°n) Alfonso Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba IV (1447‚Äì1501), head of the House of C√≥rdoba, was better known as Alonso de Aguilar and was called \\"El Grande\\" (the Great). He played a major role in the final stages of the conquest of the Emirate of Granada from the Nasrid dynasty. He was granted the town of Carcabuey and the village of Santa Cruz. Alonso's brother, Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, earned the title of Duke of Terranova and the nickname of \\"Gran Capit√°n\\" (Great Captain) for his servive in battle, and for his great ability in organizing and modernizing the army of the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile. Family Pedro Fernandez de Cordoba y Aguilar Pacheco was born in 1470 in Aguilar de la Frontera, C√≥rdoba, Spain. His father was Alfonso Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba IV and his mother was Catalina Pacheco, daughter of Juan Pacheco, 1st Marquis of Villena. He was educated by Peter Martyr d'Anghiera (1457‚Äì1526), the humanist. Pedro married Elvira Enriquez, daughter of Enrique Enriquez, lord of Orce, and great granddaughter of Admiral Alonso Enr√≠quez, (1354‚Äì1429). His wife's aunt was Juana Enr√≠quez, mother of Ferdinand II. His first child was a boy who died during childbirth. The others were girls. *Catalina (1495‚Äì1569), who inherited the title, married Lorenzo Suarez de Figueroa Garcia de Toledo (1505‚Äì1528). *Mar√≠a (1497‚Äì1560) married Pedro D√°vila y Z√∫√±iga, 3rd Count of Risco and 1st Marquis of las Navas (1492‚Äì1567). *Elvira (died 1539) married Pedro Fern√°ndez Manrique, 4th Count of Osorno (died 1569). Five of the girls became nuns: Teresa (died 1575), Isabel, Abbess of Santa Clara in Montilla, Mar√≠a, nun of Santa Clara, √Ångela and Juana. Career =Early prosperity= Ferdinand II of Aragon, first cousin of Pedro's wife Pedro accompanied his father during the fighting in Granada, and saw him die in 1501 during the uprising by the Moriscos in the Alpujarras. He succeeded his father as 9th Lord of Ca√±ete, 7th Lord of Priego, Aguilar de la Frontera, Puente de Don Gonzalo, Monturque, Castillo Anzur and Montilla, and 2nd Lord of Carcabuey and Santa Cruz. In December 1501, in posthumous tribute to his father, the Catholic Monarchs raised the rank of these domains to the Marquisate of Priego. They gave him the title of 1st Marquis of Priego and a grant of 300,000 maravedis. He was Alcalde mayor (Chief Justice) and Alguacil mayor (Chief of Police) of C√≥rdoba, Alcalde mayor of Antequera, Alcaide (Governor) of the Alc√°zar de los Reyes Cristianos, of Antequera and of Alcal√° la Real. One of Priego's first acts was to sign a defensive alliance with Diego Deza, Archbishop of Seville, the Duke of Medina Sidonia, the Count of Cabra and the Count of Urue√±a. The threats were not named, but it is clear that the pact was to defend their privileges against two new instruments created by the Catholic Kings, the corregimientos and the inquisition. In 1500 Montalb√°n was the property of Do√±a Beatriz de Montemayor and her husband Fern√°n Y√°√±ez de Badajoz (Alcaide Mayor of √âcija). The estate was depopulated, and they decided to convert the land to pasture. The new Marquis of Priego felt that Montalb√°n was within his jurisdiction and was strategically important to his Se√±or√≠o of Aguilar in the disputed region bordering La Rambla. Priego and his cousins of Montemayor were on bad terms at the time, so he arranged for another relative, the Alcaide de los Donceles, to buy the castle and town of Montalb√°n. The sale was made at the huge price of three million maravedis, and the rights to Montalb√°n were transferred to Priego in 1503. He commissioned his servant Luis Alv√°rez to distribute the farmland and vineyards to newcomers, and within forty years the population was over 500 families. =Resistance to the king= The death of Queen Isabella in 1504 caused growing support in Castile for the faction of Philip the Handsome (1478‚Äì1506), her son-in-law, which wanted to stop Ferdinand II of Aragon from proclaiming himself king at the expense of his daughter Joanna of Castile and her husband Philip. Priego joined the faction opposed to Ferdinand and became its leader in C√≥rdoba. He was opposed by the Alcaide de los Donceles, Diego Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba y Mendoza, 3rd Count of Cabra. Priego allied with Juan Alfonso P√©rez de Guzm√°n, 3rd Duke of Medina Sidonia, Juan T√©llez-Gir√≥n, 2nd Count of Ure√±a and the Marquis of C√°diz to maintain peace throughout Andalusia and to keep the region on the side of Queen Juana. The situation was unstable, and the occupation of offices by the rival supporters of Priego and the Count of Cabra almost caused a serious confrontation in the city in 1506. With the support of Philip the Handsome, Priego's faction gained the ascendancy. In 1507 the people rose up against the brutal inquisitor Diego Rodr√≠guez de Lucero, supposedly encouraged by Priego. In 1507 Ferdinand appointed corregidores to investigate and resolve the dispute between the people of Cordoba and the inquisition. Priego was deposed from his office as Alguacil mayor by one of the corregidores, but had been reinstated by June 1508. The king sent Fernando L√≥pez de C√≥rdoba to investigate, and Priego imprisoned him at Montilla on the basis that he had not been appointed by Queen Juana. Several senior members of the Castilian aristocracy had to defend Priego to the king. =Trial and aftermath= Montilla in 2008. The large building on the hill to the left is the Alhor√≠ de Montilla, built on the ruins of the castle. When Priego's uncle, Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba (the Gran Capit√°n), explained how angry the king was, Priego went to plead his case before the king. He reached Toledo in September 1508.

The group aims to empower entrepreneurs running startups in and around Cardiff, or those that work at them. It is Wales‚Äôs largest startup community.  History  Cardiff Start was launched in April 2013 by Neil Cocker, a Cardiff and Sofia, Bulgaria-based businessman who has started a number of tech businesses in the city, and Stephen Millburn, an app developer behind TradeBox Media. The organisation was founded as a community interest company. = The early startup sector = The Cardiff startup scene has been aided by early interventions by the Cardiff Bay-based devolved Government, particularly through the Development Bank of Wales. The early efforts were however still not deemed to be sufficient by the founders of Cardiff Start to compete with the burgeoning tech scene at East London Tech City or with other regional centres for technology such as Edinburgh. = Higher education prospects = Cocker has described the city as particularly lucrative as a centre for start up businesses and technology companies, with Cardiff University, Cardiff Metropolitan University, and University of South Wales all providing talented young computer-literate graduates who can fill demand for programmers and developers. The city lacked a particular conduit for networking and business advice, however, which is a focus for Cardiff Start's efforts. = Sector developments = In 2017, the BBC covered the sector and the development of Cardiff Start, aided by interviews from Milburn and Cocker. In the report, Cardiff Start described how nearly 80 tech start-up companies had received ¬£60m from Development Bank of Wales in the past 10 years, but that its network of 2,500 members found that Government backed support was \\"often not fit for purpose\\". In 2019 Cardiff Start hosted, along with marketing firm Yard Digital, a \\"Startup Residency\\", attracting applications from a range of entrepreneurs in the city. The organisation frequently engages with media companies and journalists to promote the city's potential. In 2019 the group were cited by Small Business magazine in its Essential Guide to Starting a Business in Cardiff.

He has overseen the day-to-day operations of the company since its founding in 1992. Phil has been named Entrepreneur of the Year for New York City by Ernst & Young and named to Crain‚Äôs New York prestigious ‚Äú40 Under 40 list‚Äù as one of the top young executives in New York. Biography Born in 1969 to Shirley and Irvin Shawe in Kentucky, he attended New York University, and it was in the NYU dorm room that he and Elizabeth Elting founded TransPerfect. Career Shawe began his career after graduating NYU with a position at Chemical Bank in New York; he did not see a future in it. When Chemical Banking Corp. merged with Manufacturers Hanover Corp. in 1991, Shawe quit to join Elting in a new business, a translation service. They were \\"betting..., on the globalization of business\\". From 1992 until 2018, Shawe had been the co-CEO of TransPerfect., and it has grown every quarter since its founding. Since May of 2018, he has been the sole CEO. In 2019, Shawe announced that TransPerfect will move the company's Manhattan headquarters from the iconic 3 Park Avenue, to Eyal Ofer's NoMad Tower, with a 15 year lease. =TransPerfect Legal Challenge= Beginning in 2014, TransPerfect's two co-founders became entangled in a legal fight for control of the company. At issue was their partnership‚Äôs lack of an Exit Strategy. Instead of choosing to sell the shares directly, or to a third party buyer, the case ended up in New York State Supreme Court to force a complete sale of the company. The theory behind it was that with 50% ownership, no one had a company control. With that, there was a concern that the value of one's 50% ownership share would yield less than half the value of the actual shares. Elting's legal approach for relief from the legal system was viewed by Shawe as an attempt to use the courts to negotiate an exit policy. In 2014, Elting sought to remove Shawe as an officer of TransPerfect Translations International, Inc. (TPI), and an injunction barring Shawe from conducting any managerial activity related to the business, and sought the dissolution of TransPerfect. Elting alleged that Shawe had created deadlock. New York State Supreme Court Justice Melvin Schweitzer dismissed the case, suggesting the two needed to work it out privately and not seek remedy from a court. The suit was then taken to the Delaware Chancery where Elting made a similar complaint. Shawe alleged that Elting had breached her fiduciary duties by not moving ahead with certain business-related opportunities, such as leases, acquisitions, and suggested that Elting was seeking to divert funds necessary for growth for personal use. In August 2015, The Chancellor of the Delaware Chancery Court, Andre Bouchard, decided that the company should be forced to sell 100% of its shares in a public auction. Shortly after the case was begun, Shawe offered Elting more than $300 Million to buy her shares. Elting had suggested that perhaps she would buy Shawe's shares and alleged that Shawe was undervaluing the company and that her 50% stake was more valuable. Shawe alleged that Elting was never a buyer, and made a Texas Buy Sell offer, to which Elting rejected and continued to seek the court-ordered remedy. The auction was an attempt to ascertain the real market valuation of the company. In 2016, Chancellor Bouchard sanctioned Shawe for destroying evidence in the case. Bouchard, in his decision noted that no evidence was actually lost, but what he believed to be the attempt is what drove the $7.1 million dollar fine. Elting's attorneys at the firm Kramer Levin were also sanctioned for obstruction during a deposition during the case. The result was that Shawe bought Elting‚Äôs shares for $385m USD, which is estimated to be $287m in after-tax net proceeds. Shawe contended that after both parties paid their legal bills, Elting's share came to less than she would have made initially. In February 2018, after a lengthy and expensive legal process, Robert Pincus, the court-appointed custodian, determined that Shawe was the viable buyer in the auction and he became sole owner. Shawe has been outspoken on what he considers to be corruption in the Chancery Court, and has been committed to exposing the issues and effecting changes. Once he completed the purchase of Elting's shares and took ownership in the company, Shawe moved all of his corporate holdings from Delaware to Nevada. Affiliations and Philanthropy Shawe has guest lectured on Entrepreneurship at New York University and Columbia University and is a member of the Association for a Better New York (ABNY). He had been a member of the board of directors of The Joyful Heart Foundation, a non-profit that worked in support of survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence, and child abuse. His philanthropic efforts include supporting over 25 causes by donating time or financial support, and he was recently named to The V Foundation for Cancer Research‚Äôs Circle of Honor. In 2018, Shawe sponsored ultramarathon runner Michele Graglia to run the Atacama Desert, for which Graglia was accepted into the Guinness Book.

Downloaded from http://www.birds.cornell.edu/clementschecklist/download/ Retrieved 14 August 2018 The following tags have been used to highlight some categories of occurrence. The notes of population status, such as \\"endangered\\", apply to the worldwide population, not that only in Vatican City. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Vatican City *(I) Introduced - a species introduced by humans directly or indirectly to Vatican City Swans, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating. *Mallard, Anas platyrhynchos Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. *Little grebe, Tachybaptus ruficollis *Great crested grebe, Podiceps cristatus Pigeons and doves Order: ColumbiformesFamily: Columbidae Pigeons and doves are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy cere. *Rock pigeon, Columba livia *Stock dove, Columba oenas *Common wood-pigeon, Columba palumbus *European turtle-dove, Streptopelia turtur *Eurasian collared-dove, Streptopelia decaocto Swifts Order: CaprimulgiformesFamily: Apodidae Swifts are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang. *Alpine swift, Apus melba *Common swift, Apus apus *Pallid swift, Apus pallidus Rails, gallinules, and coots Order: GruiformesFamily: Rallidae Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots and gallinules. Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers. *Eurasian moorhen, Gallinula chloropus Plovers and lapwings Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Charadriidae The family Charadriidae includes the plovers, dotterels and lapwings. They are small to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short, thick necks and long, usually pointed, wings. They are found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water. *Little ringed plover, Charadrius dubius Sandpipers and allies Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Scolopacidae Scolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the sandpipers, curlews, godwits, shanks, tattlers, woodcocks, snipes, dowitchers and phalaropes. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Variation in length of legs and bills enables multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food. *Dunlin, Calidris alpina *Common sandpiper, Actitis hypoleucos *Green sandpiper, Tringa ochropus Gulls, terns, and skimmers Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Laridae Laridae is a family of medium to large seabirds, the gulls, terns, and skimmers. Gulls are typically grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. Skimmers are a small family of tropical tern-like birds. They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for small fish. *Black-headed gull, Chroicocephalus ridibundus *Mediterranean gull, Ichthyaetus melanocephalus *Yellow-legged gull, Larus michahellis *Lesser black-backed gull, Larus fuscus Storks Order: CiconiiformesFamily: Ciconiidae Storks are large, long-legged, long-necked, wading birds with long, stout bills. Storks are mute, but bill-clattering is an important mode of communication at the nest. Their nests can be large and may be reused for many years. Many species are migratory. *White stork, Ciconia ciconia Cormorants and shags Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage colouration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colourful. *Great cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo Herons, egrets, and bitterns Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae The family Ardeidae contains the bitterns, herons, and egrets. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills. *Great bittern, Botaurus stellaris *Gray heron, Ardea cinerea *Purple heron, Ardea purpurea Osprey Order: AccipitriformesFamily: Pandionidae The family Pandionidae contains only one species, the osprey.

Never ruling as an independent monarch, Rustam Mirza is primarily associated with his governance over the city of Isfahan, which he gained and lost multiple times in the power struggles following Timur's death. Early life and background Rustam was born in 1381 and was the only son of Umar Shaikh Mirza I by his wife, Qutlugh Tarkhan Agha. His father, the eldest of the four sons of Timur, died in 1394 when Rustam was about thirteen years old. Rustam later became involved in the military, being active during the final decade of his grandfather's life. When his half-brother Pir Muhammad earned Timur's ire, Rustam was given the former's position as governor of Fars. After his brother returned to their grandfather's good graces in 1402, Rustam was transferred to the rule of Isfahan. Timurid wars Following Timur's death in 1405, a power struggle erupted amongst his descendants, though the sons of Umar Shaikh were at least nominally now under the suzerainty of their uncle Shah Rukh. Rustam, still governor of Isfahan, allied himself with his cousin Umar, son of Miran Shah. The two princes launched a campaign against Umar's brother Abu Bakr, successfully raiding his baggage train. In April 1406, they allied themselves with Rustam's brothers Pir Muhammad and Iskandar and launched a combined assault against Abu Bakr. However, the latter emerged victorious and pursued his relations, laying siege to Isfahan in June/July. Rustam, despite being in the city at the time, does not appear to have been involved in its defence, possibly due to being incapacitated as a result of illness. Instead, the resistance was led by one of the prince's close advisers, Qadi Ahmad Sa'idi, who managed to forestall Abu Bakr, resulting in the siege being abandoned. In 1406/07, Rustam gave refuge to a fugitive Iskandar, who had recently escaped incarceration by Pir Muhammad. Pir Muhammad attacked Isfahan, though upon failing to capture it, ravaged the surrounding lands by destroying crops, burning houses and breaking dams. In retribution for this assault, Rustam and Iskandar laid siege to Pir Muhammad's capital of Shiraz, though they were similarly unsuccessful. Instead, they resolved to plunder eastern Fars, from Niriz to Darabjirdb, an act in which they were aided by some of their brother's renegade followers, including several governors. Angered, Pir Muhammad pursued the two princes, with the goal of launching another assault on Isfahan. However, Rustam and Iskandar had previously been forced to leave the city due to a plague epidemic. The two armies instead met near the meadow of Gandoman and in the ensuing battle, Rustam and Iskandar were defeated. The two fled east, with Rustam seeking refuge with Shah Rukh in Herat. Later life and death By 1412, Pir Muhammad had died and much of his former lands were now under the control of Iskandar. Rustam was invited to retake Isfahan by Qadi Ahmad Sa'idi, who had been governing the city for some years. However, as a result of intrigues among his amirs, Rustam was soon convinced to have Sa'idi killed. The latter, along with his son, was invited to a feast celebrating Eid al-Adha, where both were assassinated. The city's population was angered by the murder and swiftly turned against the prince, inviting Iskandar to take control of the city. Though Rustam attempted to fight his brother, without the city's support he was unable to resist and was forced to flee once more. He first headed to Tabriz to seek the aid of Qara Yusuf of the Qara Qoyunlu, though when this proved fruitless, he again returned to Shah Rukh in Herat. When Shah Rukh marched against Iskandar in 1414/15 after the latter revolted, Rustam and their other brother Bayqara accompanied their uncle in his baggage train. Upon Iskandar's defeat, control of Isfahan was returned to Rustam, as well as custody of his renegade brother, whom he subsequently had blinded. Rustam, more cautious than his brothers, proved himself to be faithful to Shah Rukh. When Iskandar once more rose in rebellion, now alongside Bayqara, in 1415, Rustam aided in its suppression by having the former executed. Later, he led his troops into modern-day Azerbaijan in support of his uncle against Qara Yusuf's son Jahan Shah. Rustam died in 1424/25 and was followed in quick succession by two sons. However, Firuz Shah, Shah Rukh's supreme army commander, later had Rustam's followers expelled and instead transferred the rule of Isfahan to his own brother.

History  The first accounts of the castle of Nalda date from 1299. However its origin may be prior to that date, given its strategic location the defensive system of the Iregua valley, against the muslim ruling. In the 14th century its destiny was linked to the family Ram√≠rez de Arellano becoming the center of power of a vast territory, the Lordship of Cameros, in an area that stretched from the north of the modern province of Soria to the Ebro valley. When the military and strategic needs changed, it was used as administrative building. It disappeared with the abolition of the dominions at the beginning of the 19th century; it was used as a quarry, its materials were plundered and rubble ended up covering the old fortress. The hill was finally conditioned as threshing floor and small family stone wine cellars were excavated. In the year 2012 the Town Hall of Nalda and Islallana proposed conditioning the hilltop of the castle as a viewpoint. Its toponym and the limited remains of visible structures of it made an archeological intervention necessary, where several remains were found, and it became a starting point for the excavation, study and restoration of the former fortress.

Jack Juggler (full title: A New Interlude for Children to Play named Jack Juggler, both Witty, Very Pleasant, and Merry) is an anonymous sixteenth-century comic interlude, considered to be one of the earliest examples of comedy in English alongside Ralph Roister Doister and Gammer Gurton's Needle. The play is believed to have been written sometime between 1553 and 1561 and was first published in 1562. The author of the play is uncertain, however it has been proposed to be the work of the London schoolmaster, Nicholas Udall. As the full title indicates, the play was most likely performed by a troupe of child-actors possibly at court during the Christmas season. The plot was inspired by Amphitryon from the Roman comic playwright Plautus.  Characters  * Jack Juggler - A vice * Jenkin Careaway - A lackey to Jack Juggler * Master Bongrace - A gallant. * Dame Coy - A gentlewoman * Alice Trip and Go - A maid.  Summary  = Prologue = The prologue begins with a Latin quotation from the Distichs of Cato which it translates as, \\"Among thy careful business, use sometimes mirth and joy [so] that no bodily work, thy wits break or annoy.\\" The speaker of the prologue goes on explain the importance of recreation and mirth as being restorative to the mind and introduces the following work as being based on a comedy of Plautus which will not present any serious matter, but rather be light-hearted and humorous. = Play = Jenkin Careaway is a lazy servant who tells lies to create discord between the couple he works for, Master Bongrace and Dame Coy. Jack Juggler decides to prank Careaway by dressing in Careaway's clothes and pretending to be him. When Careaway tries to complain about the prank to his master and mistress, they do not believe him because they know he is a liar.  Date and text  Jack Juggler was entered into the Register of the Stationers' Company ca. Nov. 1562 by the printer William Coplande. The play survives in three editions: ca. 1562, ca. 1565, and 1570, the final edition was printed by John Allde after Coplande's death in 1569.

Fikr wa Talash was sponsored by USAID, Roshan telecommunication (the country's leading mobile operator) and Bank e Milli (Afghan National Bank). The host is Ramiz Baktiar. Like the Egyptian version, it was created by Anna Elliot, the founder of the NGO Bamyan Media.  Seasons  = Season 1 = The first series ended in August 2008, with the final contestant, Faizulhaq Moshkani, winning $20,000 towards his plastic recycling business. At the time of the show, he owned a plastic recycling plant in Qandahar in southern Afghanistan. After winning, Moshkani shut the factory due to the high cost of fuel to power generators. Instead, he used the $20,000 prize money to move the business to Kabul, where he planned to build a mini hydroelectric plant to power the new recycling factory. Mariam Al Ahmadi, collected the runner-up prize of $10,000. = Season 2 = In the second season, a follow-up episode was introduced with the top contestants tracking their progress in their businesses.

After prison guards performed CPR, he was transported in cardiac arrest to the New York Downtown Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 6:39 a.m. The New York City medical examiner ruled Epstein's death a suicide by hanging. Epstein's lawyers challenged that conclusion and opened their own investigation, hiring pathologist Michael Baden. After initially expressing suspicion, Attorney General William Barr described Epstein's death as \\"a perfect storm of screw- ups\\". Both the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice's Inspector General are conducting investigations into the circumstances of his death. The guards on duty were later charged with multiple counts of conspiracy and record falsification. Many public figures accused the Federal Bureau of Prisons of negligence. Consequently, Barr removed the Bureau's director and several lawmakers called for reforms to the federal prison system. As a result of Epstein's death, all charges against him were dismissed, and ongoing sex- trafficking investigations shifted attention to his alleged associates, notably Ghislaine Maxwell, who was arrested and indicted in July 2020. Due to violations of normal jail procedures on the night of Epstein's death, the alleged malfunction of two cameras in front of his cell, and his claims to have compromising information about powerful figures, his death generated speculation and conspiracy theories about the possibility that he was murdered. In November 2019, the contested nature of his death spawned the \\"Epstein didn't kill himself\\" meme. According to public opinion polls, a majority of Americans believe Epstein was murdered. Arrest and imprisonment =Apprehension and indictment= The Metropolitan Correctional Center, where Epstein was held after his 2019 arrest On July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested in New York on multiple charges, including sex trafficking, and placed at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan. He pleaded not guilty. He had faced similar charges in Florida in 2008, but escaped federal charges in a plea deal. Under its provisions, he pleaded guilty to two state felony charges, paid restitution to three dozen victims identified by the FBI, and registered as a sex offender in both Florida and New York. On July 18, 2019, Epstein was denied bail after offering $600,000 to be able to wear an ankle tracker at his New York City townhouse. He was viewed as a potential flight risk due to his 20 international flights in the prior 18 months. Epstein appealed the bail denial decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and at the time of his death, the appeal was still pending. =Initial incident and final weeks= At 1:27a.m. on July 23, 2019, Epstein was found semiconscious in his cell with injuries to his neck. He told his lawyers that he had been assaulted by his cellmate. His cellmate, multiple murder and drug conspiracy suspect Nicholas Tartaglione, was questioned by prison officials but denied harming Epstein. Tartaglione claimed that he had actually saved Epstein. An internal prison investigation cleared Tartaglione of connection with the event. After Epstein's death, Tartaglione was reportedly threatened by jail guards and told to \\"stop talking\\" after describing Epstein's death and conditions in the jail to the media. An unnamed source claimed that Epstein staged the incident in order to be transferred. Spencer Kuvin, a lawyer who represented three alleged victims of Epstein, said in July 2019, after Epstein's first apparent suicide attempt, that he believed it was an attack on his life, and that there was a high probability that he would be murdered in prison. As a result of the incident, Epstein was placed on suicide watch. He was placed in an observation cell, surrounded by windows, where lights were left on and any devices that he could use to to kill himself were not permitted. After six days, psychological staff dismissed Epstein from suicide watch following a psychiatric examination. Sources reported that Epstein was removed from suicide watch after claiming that it was Tartaglione who \\"roughed him up.\\" Epstein then returned to the special housing unit (SHU), where he was supposed to have a cellmate and be checked on every 30 minutes. Epstein was reportedly depositing funds into other prisoners' accounts to gain their favor or buy protection. A paper note by Epstein was found in his cell after his death. In it, he complained about large bugs crawling on his body, guard Tova Noel giving him burnt food, and a guard intentionally locking him in a shower cell without clothes for an hour. On August 8, Epstein signed his last will and testament, witnessed by two attorneys who knew him. The will named two longtime employees as executors, and immediately gifted all his assets, and any assets remaining in his estate, to a trust. Death When Epstein was placed in the SHU, the jail informed the Justice Department that he would have a cellmate and that a guard would look into the cell every 30 minutes. These procedures were not followed on the night he died. On August 9, Epstein's cellmate was transferred, and no replacement was brought in. The evening of his death, Epstein met with his lawyers, who described him as \\"upbeat\\" before being escorted back to the SHU at 7:49p.m. by guard Tova Noel. CCTV footage shows that the two guards failed to perform the required institutional count at 10:00p.m. and recorded Noel briefly walking by Epstein's cell at 10:30p.m., the last time the guards entered the tier where his cell was. Through the night, in violation of the jail's normal procedure, Epstein was not checked every 30 minutes. The two guards who were assigned to check his cell overnight, Noel and Michael Thomas, fell asleep at their desk for about three hours and later falsified related records. Two cameras in front of Epstein's cell also malfunctioned that night. Another camera had footage that was \\"unusable\\". =Discovery= Epstein's body being moved to the medical examiner's office As the guards were distributing breakfast shortly after 6:30a.m. on the morning of August 10, Epstein was found unresponsive in cardiac arrest in his cell. He was found in a kneeling position with a strip of bedsheet wrapped around his neck. The sheet was tied to the top of his bunk. He is believed to have been dead for about two hours. The guards performed CPR on Epstein, and other prisoners heard them yell \\"Breathe, Epstein, breathe.\\" At 6:33a.m., the guards pulled an alarm, notifying their supervisor, to whom Noel said, \\"Epstein hung himself.\\" He was rushed to the New York Downtown Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 6:39a.m.. His body was transported to the medical examiner's office soon after. The news of the death was posted on 4chan about 38 minutes before ABC News reported it. If this 4chan post was by a first responder, as it has been speculated, it would likely be a violation of privacy law. The removal of Epstein's body from his cell was a violation of protocol, as the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) mandates that a suicide scene be treated with the \\"same level of protection as any crime scene in which a death has occurred.\\" Consequently, prison personnel also failed to photograph Epstein's body as it was found. =Discrepancies= Epstein's death was the first death ruled a suicide at the MCC in 14 years. Michael Baden and 60 Minutes questioned whether Epstein, who was almost tall and weighed , could have been able to hang himself from the lower bunk. Photos taken after the death also show bottles and medicine standing upright on the top bunk. Moreover, a former MCC inmate described the prison's sheets as \\"paper level, not strong enough\\" to support Epstein's body. Baden also questioned why Epstein did not use other materials available in his cell as a ligature, such as wires and tubing from a sleep apnea machine, which were stronger and longer. Autopsy and medical evidence =Autopsy= A four- hour autopsy on Epstein's body was conducted on August 11 by New York City's Chief Medical Examiner Barbara Sampson. Epstein's lawyers sent pathologist Michael Baden to observe the city's autopsy. Following the autopsy, the medical examiner's office reported that Epstein had hanged himself with a sheet from his bed. On August 14, unofficial sources reported that broken bones were found in Epstein's neck, although this can occur in the suicide of the elderly. According to forensic experts and studies, these broken bones are \\"more common in victims of homicide by strangulation\\", though multiple studies have found different percentages for both manners of death. The last death ruled a suicide at the MCC was in 1998. Epstein's lawyers released a joint statement after the medical examiner's report expressing that they were not satisfied, challenging its conclusions and saying that a more complete response was forthcoming. They also indicated that the defense team fully intended to continue its own investigation into the circumstances and cause of Epstein's death, including taking legal action, if necessary, to view the camera footage near his cell during the night of his death. They later said that the evidence concerning Epstein's death was \\"far more consistent\\" with murder than suicide. =Autopsy report and criticism= Epstein's hyoid bone, among others, was broken. It is disputed whether this is more indicative of hanging or strangulation. On August 16, Sampson announced that Epstein's death had been ruled a suicide by hanging. Later, conflicting reports stated that the injuries Epstein sustained were as consistent, if not more so, with strangulation or homicide as with suicide. Sampson's report found that there was no foul play in his death. Three of Epstein's lawyers expressed their dissatisfaction with Sampson's conclusion, having hired forensic pathologist Michael Baden to observe the autopsy; they said they would initiate their own investigation and provide a more detailed statement in the future. Baden observed Sampson's autopsy when it was conducted; after the autopsy he said that he was unable to comment because of gag orders filed by Sampson's office and Epstein's estate. On October 30, 2019, Baden issued a report stating that Epstein's neck injuries were much more consistent with \\"homicidal strangulation\\" than suicide. He stated that Epstein \\"had two fractures on the left and right sides of his larynx, specifically the thyroid cartilage or Adam's apple, as well as one fracture on the left hyoid bone above the Adam's apple.\\" In particular, Baden claimed that Epstein's hyoid bone was broken in a way indicative of strangulation from behind. Later that day, Sampson refuted Baden's claims, saying, \\"I stand firmly behind our determination of the cause and manner of death for Mr. Epstein. The cause is hanging, the manner is suicide.\\" Baden later said, \\"Going over a thousand jail hangings, suicides in the New York City state prisons over the past 40-50 years, no one had three fractures.\\" Neurosurgeon and CNN medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta asserted that Epstein could have easily broken his hyoid bone in a hanging because of the bone's weakening and loss of flexibility with age. Gupta also suggested that the presence of multiple broken neck bones was more characteristic of hanging. Gerald Rodts, chief of spinal surgery at Emory University Hospital, also stated that the presence of multiple broken neck bones is consistent with hanging. Marks on Epstein's neck According to Baden, the neck wound was in the center of Epstein's neck, not under his mandibles as in a typical hanging. Baden said this is more common when a victim is strangled by a wire or cord. Baden also said that the wound was much thinner than the strip of bedsheet, and although there was blood on Epstein's neck, it was absent on the bed-sheet ligature. According to the autopsy files, Epstein also had contusions on both of his wrists, an abrasion on his left forearm, and deep muscle hemorrhaging of his left deltoid or shoulder. His brother, Mark, later suggested that he was \\"handcuffed and struggled.\\" Epstein also had hemorrhages in his eyes, which, although not unheard of in hangings, are more common in strangulations. Baden also said that Epstein's lower legs lacked lividity, suggesting that he did not die in the upright position in which he was found. =Burial= Following the autopsy, Epstein's body was claimed by an \\"unidentified associate\\", later revealed to be his brother, Mark. On September 5, the body was buried in an unmarked tomb next to those of his parents at the IJ Morris Star of David mausoleum in Palm Beach, Florida. His parents' names were removed from their tombstone to prevent vandalism. Aftermath =Reaction= A few hours after Epstein's death was announced, President Donald Trump responded by retweeting a post related to the \\"Clinton Body Count\\", a conspiracy theory purporting to link Epstein's death to former president Bill Clinton and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. At a speech in Pennsylvania three days later, Trump told reporters he wanted \\"a full investigation.\\" Attorney General William Barr said he was \\"appalled\\" by Epstein's death in federal custody and that it \\"raises serious questions that must be answered.\\" He ordered an investigation by the Justice Department's Inspector General in addition to the FBI investigation. Senator Ben Sasse, chairman of the United States Senate Judiciary oversight subcommittee, later wrote Barr a letter saying, \\"The Department of Justice failed.\\" He added, \\"Given Epstein's previous attempted suicide, he should have been locked in a padded room under unbroken, 24/7, constant surveillance. Obviously, heads must roll.\\" Representative Matt Gaetz, who sits on the United States House Judiciary Committee, called on chairman Jerry Nadler to prioritize investigating the circumstances around Epstein's death over other probes the committee was carrying out. Representative Lois Frankel called for a congressional investigation into Epstein's 2008 plea deal. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Rick Scott called for an investigation and expressed their dissatisfaction that Epstein's victims would not find closure in a trial. On August 11, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, then campaigning for president in Iowa, said, \\"I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but something's way too convenient here, and we need to get down to the bottom of what happened.\\" The next day, the leaders of the House Judiciary Committee, Chairman Jerry Nadler and ranking member Doug Collins, sent the BOP 23 questions about Epstein's death. \\"The apparent suicide of this high-profile and‚Äîif allegations are proven to be accurate‚Äîparticularly reprehensible individual while in the federal government's custody demonstrates severe miscarriages of or deficiencies in inmate protocol and has allowed the deceased to ultimately evade facing justice,\\" they wrote. \\"Any victims of Mr. Epstein's actions will forever be denied proper recourse and the scintilla of recompense our justice system can provide in the face of such alleged atrocities; the competency and rigor of our criminal justice system has been marred by this apparent oversight.\\" On August 13, Nebraska senator Ben Sasse, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote a letter to Attorney General Barr urging him to \\"rip up\\" the 2008 non-prosecution deal for Epstein and his co-conspirators. Sasse argued that the Justice Department must bring Epstein's co-conspirators to justice despite his death, and added, \\"This crooked deal cannot stand.\\" On August 19, Barr replaced the BOP director with former director Kathleen Hawk Sawyer. The move was praised by Sasse. \\"For them to pull him off suicide watch is shocking,\\" Cameron Lindsay, a former warden at three federal facilities, told NBC News. \\"For someone this high-profile, with these allegations and this many victims, who has had a suicide attempt in the last few weeks, you can take absolutely no chances. You leave him on suicide watch until he's out of there.\\" Federal prosecutors in the case called Epstein's death \\"disturbing\\" and emphasized that they would continue to seek justice for his accusers even after the financier's death. Geoffrey Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement, \\"To those brave young women who have already come forward and to the many others who have yet to do so, let me reiterate that we remain committed to standing for you, and our investigation of the conduct charged in the indictment‚Äîwhich included a conspiracy count‚Äîremains ongoing.\\" =Investigations= Attorney General William Barr described Epstein's death as \\"a perfect storm of screw-ups.\\" The BOP subsequently launched an investigation of the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death, with Attorney General Barr saying that Justice Department officials would thoroughly investigate \\"serious irregularities\\" at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. As Barr received more information surrounding Epstein's death, however, he came to believe that it was only \\"a perfect storm of screw-ups.\\" In November 2019, BOP director Sawyer told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the FBI was investigating whether a \\"criminal enterprise\\" was involved in Epstein's death. She added that there is \\"no indication, from anything I know\\" that his death \\"was anything other than a suicide.\\" A spokesperson later explained that she had used the phrase \\"criminal enterprise\\" because that was what Senator Lindsey Graham has asked her about, and that \\"she was referring to looking into possible criminal conduct by staff.\\" On August 13, Attorney General Barr ordered the BOP to temporarily reassign the warden of the MCC, Lamine N'Diaye, while the FBI and Justice Department inspector general investigate the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death. James Petrucci, the warden of FCI Otisville, was named acting warden. Two staff members assigned to Epstein's unit were also placed on administrative leave. On August 14, Manhattan federal court judge Richard Berman, who was overseeing Epstein's criminal case, wrote to the N'Diaye inquiring as to whether an investigation into Epstein's death would include a probe into his prior (July 23) injuries. Judge Berman wrote that to his knowledge it has never been definitely explained what they concluded about the incident. In November 2019, Berman called for widespread prison reforms in an open letter to Barr in the New York Times. Two French Cabinet officials Marl√®ne Schiappa and Adrien Taquet subsequently called for an investigation into the \\"many unanswered questions\\" about Epstein's ties to France, calling for the French government to launch its own probe. \\"The US investigation has highlighted links with France,\\" Schiappa and Taquet said in the statement, according to ABC. \\"It thus seems to us fundamental for the victims that an investigation be opened in France so that all is brought to light,\\" a spokesperson for the office told ABC News, \\"The elements received at the Paris prosecutor's office are being analyzed and cross-referenced.\\" In August, an investigation was launched into alleged Epstein associate Jean-Luc Brunel, who was reported to be hiding in South America. All charges against Epstein were officially dismissed on August 29. As a result, the sex-trafficking investigations and media attention shifted attention towards his alleged associates, such as Brunel, Prince Andrew, and Ghislaine Maxwell. =Subsequent criminal trials and developments= On November 19, 2019, federal prosecutors in New York indicted MCC guards Michael Thomas and Tova Noel, charging them with multiple counts of falsifying records and conspiracy. The charges were based on video footage obtained by prosecutors, indicating that Epstein was not observed by them for eight hours, while the two guards made personal searches on their computers and slept. According to Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, during that time they repeatedly signed records affirming that they had performed the required checks. Their bail was set at $100,000. They claimed that they were \\"scapegoats\\" for larger issues within the federal prison system. In a December 2019 court proceeding against Epstein's cellmate Nick Tartaglione, federal prosecutors reported that the surveillance footage from outside Epstein's cell during the July 23 incident had disappeared. Tartaglione's defense, who claimed that the footage showed Tartaglione saving Epstein's life, hoped that it would illustrate Tartaglione's character. His lawyer had requested that the footage be retained on July 25, two days after the incident. Judge Kenneth Karas requested that the government determine what had happened to the footage. Several days later, federal prosecutors reversed their statement, claiming that they had found the missing footage. But in January 2020, they admitted that the footage had been permanently deleted due to a \\"clerical error\\". On July 2, 2020, almost a year after Epstein was arrested, the FBI arrested and charged Maxwell in Bradford, New Hampshire. The charges included \\"enticement and conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, transportation and conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, and two counts of perjury.\\" Federal authorities have expressed concerns that she could also die in custody and have reportedly implemented additional safety protocols. In an August 2020 interview, President Trump said that he \\"wish[ed] her well,\\" and again questioned whether Epstein's death was a suicide or homicide. Homicide suspicions and conspiracy theories A partisan protestor alleging outside involvement five days after Epstein's death Because of violations of standard prison procedures, and Epstein's knowledge of compromising information about famous individuals, his death spawned skepticism, as well as multiple conspiracy theories. Epstein conspiracy theorists have been pejoratively labeled \\"Epstein Truthers\\", similar to those who dispute the accepted account of the 9/11 attacks. A Rasmussen poll conducted shortly after his death in August 2019 found that only 29% of U.S. adults believed Epstein actually committed suicide, while 42% thought he was murdered to prevent him from testifying against powerful people with whom he associated, and 29% of people were undecided. By November 2019, a Business Insider poll found that those who believed Epstein was murdered outnumbered suicide proponents three to one. In a 2020 poll, Rasmussen found that a majority of Americans believed Epstein was murdered, with just 21% believing that he committed suicide. University of Chicago professor Eric Oliver, a conspiracy theory expert, labeled populist sentiment and a mistrust of the political system as major contributors to the widespread rejection of the official narrative. Because of his connections to many wealthy and powerful people, there was speculation that one or more co- conspirators or participants in his sex crimes might have arranged for him to be silenced. In the hours after the death, the hashtag #ClintonBodyCount and the countering #TrumpBodyCount were trending on Twitter as users accused Bill and Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump of being involved in Epstein's death. Several hours after Epstein was found dead, Trump retweeted a conspiracy theory by Terrence K. Williams, a comedian and conservative commentator, suggesting that there was a connection between the Clintons and Epstein's death‚Äîfurthering a perennial conspiracy theory dating to the early 1990s that the Clintons have had numerous people killed to silence them. At an August 27 hearing, Epstein defense attorney Reid Weingarten expressed \\"significant doubts\\" that Epstein's death was due to suicide. According to Weingarten, when attorneys met with their client shortly before his death, \\"we did not see a despairing, despondent, suicidal person\\". Epstein's brother, Mark, has rejected the possibility of Jeffrey's suicide, claiming, ‚ÄúI could see if he got a life sentence, I could then see him taking himself out, but he had a bail hearing coming up.\\" He also claimed that his \\"life may also be in danger,\\" if Epstein was indeed murdered. In a press conference about two months after Epstein's death, de Blasio declined to endorse chief medical examiner Sampson's conclusions, saying, \\"Something doesn't fit here. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense that the highest-profile prisoner in America‚Äîyou know, someone forgot to guard him.\\" Podcast host Joe Rogan also expressed doubts that Epstein's death was a suicide. Former US Attorney and Senate Judiciary Committee counsel Brett Tolman said the death was \\"more than coincidental\\" considering Epstein's \\"many connections to powerful people\\". Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said, \\"American billionaire Jeffrey Epstein was killed several weeks ago‚Äîthey said he had committed suicide in jail. However, he was killed because he knew a lot of vital secrets connected with very important people in the British and American regimes, and possibly in other countries as well.\\" In popular culture As more information surrounding Epstein's death became public in November 2019, his death and the possibility of murder became a popular meme, particularly in the form of the phrase \\"Epstein didn't kill himself\\". The meme gained prominence as it was interjected at the end of live interviews, such as by a Navy SEAL on FOX News, or later a University of Alabama student on MSNBC. The meme often appears as a non sequitur after a body of text or within an image. NPR's Scott Simon likened the bait-and-switch aspect of the meme to Rickrolling. Simon also worried that media attention to the meme could spread misinformation. The Associated Press noted, \\"[t]he phrase 'Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself' has taken on a life of its own‚Äîsometimes more as a pop culture catchphrase than an actual belief.\\" Celebrities have comedically referenced Epstein's death. Ricky Gervais remarked at the 77th Golden Globe Awards that Epstein didn't commit suicide, and Adam Driver played a murdered Epstein in hell on Saturday Night Live. U.S. Representative Paul Gosar posted 23 tweets in which the first letter of each tweet spelled out the meme's phrase. Holiday-themed merchandise (such as Christmas sweaters) that prominently featured the phrase also became available for sale through several online retailers. In an interview with Slate, independent merchandisers indicated that the Christmas/Epstein product lines were selling comparatively well, citing the mashup's dark humor as the reason for their popularity. According to Variety, the Christmas-themed paraphernalia was outselling Game of Thrones merchandise. in the Season 2 finale of The Boys, it was revealed that Stormfront secretly killed Jeffery Epstein in its alternate timeline. Several television documentaries were created due to increased public interest after his death. In May 2020, Netflix released Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich. HBO, SonyTV, and Lifetime also have similar works in progress.

He served as the vice-president and managing director of National Basketball Association (NBA) Canada from 2014 to 2019, and previously worked for The Sports Network. During his tenure with NBA Canada, he implemented marketing strategies targeted to younger demographics to grow the game in Canada, and he increased the NBA presence using television, advertising, social media and community involvement. He oversaw events which included managing the development NBA Global Games in Europe, 3x3 basketball tournaments in Canada, the NBA Canada Series, and the 2016 NBA All-Star Game. Early life and education MacKenzie was born and raised in Guelph, Ontario, and is a former school teacher. He played ice hockey as a youth in Guelph, and attended Guelph Platers games. He completed a Bachelor of Commerce degree in marketing at McMaster University in 1992, a Bachelor of Education degree at Brock University in 1995, the sport and event marketing program at George Brown College in 1997, and a Master of Management in sport at Ohio University in 2019. Canadian basketball MacKenzie began working for National Basketball Association (NBA) Canada in 1998, managing events and development of basketball in Canada. From December 2002 to October 2003, he led an NBA project to host exhibition games in Europe as part of NBA Global Games. He worked for The Sports Network as the senior marketing manager from October 2003 to October 2004. He returned to NBA Canada in October 2004 as its director of marketing until September 2006. He was promoted to be NBA Canada's general manager in October 2006, and its managing director in January 2011. He was named vice-president and managing director of NBA Canada in January 2014, and serves in the same capacity as of August 2019. MacKenzie brought in corporate partners to sponsor NBA events which included 3x3 basketball tournaments in Canada. By 2008, he had working relationships with partners Parmalat Canada, Speed Stick and the Wrigley Company, and aimed to promote basketball in Canada specifically to a young and diverse demographic. In 2013, Financial Post Business noted that NBA revenue in Canada grew 224% since 2008, and MacKenzie attributed the growth to marketing strategy combined with the sport's appeal to the young Asian Canadians demographic. He noted that recent trends of immigration to Canada showed people were coming from countries where basketball was already a popular sport. He also noted there was significant support from Filipino Canadians and Chinese Canadians, and felt it was related to the former Philippine Basketball League and NBA efforts in China including exhibition games, skills programs, and coaching programs. He also targeted first-generation Canadians as a market for basketball. From 2010 to 2013, the growth rate for Canadians participating in basketball increased 16%. As of 2010, basketball was the most popular team sport in Canada from the ages of 12 and 17. MacKenzie attributed this to basketball being \\"easy and inexpensive to play, and a safe sport\\". He also noted that since the Toronto Raptors began play in 1995, \\"what you are seeing now with the growth of the sport, is the first generation of kids who have grown up with the NBA being a strong element in their lives\\". MacKenzie aimed to increase apparel sales, social media presence and broadcasts for basketball in Canada. He stated that in 2013, Adidas basketball apparel sales had increased 103% in one year, and that the NBA was recognized by Mashable as one of the top-engaged brands on Twitter in 2013. He wanted to increase accessibility of NBA basketball games in Canada through cable television packages which included NBA League Pass to see Toronto Raptors and other out-of-town games. He stated that broadcast ratings grew approximately 19% in one year. As of 2013, fans could view up to 300 games per year on television. He used local events to engage new fans, which coincided with the NBA Canada Series beginning in 2012. He also wanted to ensure leaving a legacy in those communities, which including upgrades to local recreational and basketball facilities. In 2013, the NBA added a \\"Play Ball\\" section to its web site in English and French, to facilitate increased player registrations in youth clubs across Canada. In 2013, MacKenzie was part of Toronto's successful bid to host the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, and stated that \\"the time was right\\" to bring the event outside of the United States for the first time. He estimated that it would bring $80 million to $100 million into Toronto's economy. He also announced contracts with Air Miles and Bank of Montreal, and said that Canadian-based sponsors were coming onboard due to the growing fan base in Canada, highlighting that the NBA had 650,000 Canadian followers on Twitter by 2016. In May 2019, MacKenzie stated the NBA had reached a peak in Canadian sponsorship to date, with 32 partners including Bell Canada, Molson Coors Brewing Company and the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation. He also noted the increasing number of Canadians playing in the NBA in recent years. He said that during the playoff run leading Toronto's victory in the 2019 NBA Finals, the Canadian audience from outside of Ontario grew, viewership increased 163% and sales of NBA merchandise rose 26% from the previous season, and that basketball's popularity in Canada was at an all-time high. In June 2019, he announced a partnership with Canada Basketball to create a Junior NBA Leadership Council to promote programs offered to local youth community groups, and expanded television coverage of the Women's National Basketball Association to be available via Sportsnet, TSN and NBA TV Canada. MacKenzie resigned effective August 15, 2019, and was succeeded by Leah MacNab. Canadian Hockey League On July 30, 2019, the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) announced MacKenzie was hired as its first full-time president. CHL president David Branch said that, \\"Dan has a unique combination of league operations, sports marketing and business experience along with being a former school teacher. His experience will help the CHL continue to grow and expand our programs and player experience\\". MacKenzie has stated he looks forward to building on the relationships that CHL teams have with their communities. He took over in September 2019 from Branch, who had served as president since 1996. In October 2019, MacKenzie stated it was a priority to grow the CHL's brand and build upon the experience for players and spectators, and to bring national events such as the Memorial Cup to smaller communities. He also stated the need to promote the CHL's scholarship program, which exceeds a $10-million investment each year for the future of players who have careers outside of hockey. On October 16, 2019, MacKenzie announced Kubota as the title sponsor of the CHL/NHL Top Prospects Game beginning with the 2020 event. In November 2019, he announced that Wawanesa Insurance had partnered with the CHL for a Christmas Toy drive. In March 2020, the CHL and its constituent leagues cancelled the remainder of the 2019‚Äì20 regular seasons, playoffs and the 2020 Memorial Cup, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in North America. MacKenzie stated a desire to begin the 2020‚Äì21 on its normal schedule, but would wait until public health authorities deem it is safe to play. He also stated no decision has been made to restart play without fans in attendance as proposed in some professional leagues. Personal life MacKenzie resides in Guelph, Ontario, and is married with two children as of 2019. He became a volunteer board member for the Sponsorship Marketing Council of Canada (SMCC) in 2010, and was elected its new chairman in January 2013. He stepped down from the SMCC in 2015. He later volunteered for the board of directors of Licensing Industry Merchandiser's Association Canada, and has been a committee member for the sports celebrity festival hosted by Special Olympics Canada. Awards MacKenzie was named one of the George Brown College alumni Five to Watch, and received the college's Alumni Achievement Award. He served as co- chairman of the Five to Watch event in 2013.

Myxozoans are microscopic metazoans, with an obligate parasitic life-style. The parasite stages of this species live in the paracelullar space between fish enterocytes. It is the causative agent of enteromyxosis, or emaciative disease, also known as ‚Äúrazor blade syndrome‚Äù in sparid fish. E. leei has a wide host and geographical range within marine fish (at least 60 species from 22 different families, mainly Perciforms), and even freshwater fish have been infected experimentally. E. leei initially emerged in the Mediterranean in the late 1980s and it is believed to have been unintentionally introduced into the Red SeaDiamant, A. (1992) A new pathogenic histozoic Myxidium (Myxosporea) in cultured gilt-head sea bream Sparus aurataL. Bulletin of the European Association of Fish Pathology 12, 64-66.Diamant, A. (1997). Fish-to-fish transmission of a marine myxosporean. Diseases of Aquatic Organisms 30, 99-105.. Its pathogenicity and economic impact depend on the host species. In the gilt-head seabream, it is manifested as a chronic disease that provokes anorexia, delayed growth with weight loss, cachexia, reduced marketability and increased mortality. In other species, it has no clinical signs. In sharpsnout seabream, infection results in very high mortality rates, which have pushed fish farmers to abandon the culture of this fish species.  Taxonomy  Enteromyxum leei was formerly described as Myxidium leeiDiamant, A., Lom, J., Dykov√°, I. (1994) Myxidium leei n. sp., a pathogenic myxosporean of cultured sea bream Sparus aurata. Diseases of Aquatic Organisms, 20, 137-141., and initially reported in cultured gilthead sea bream (GSB) (Sparus aurata) from southern Cyprus. The morpholology of the myxospores of this parasite differ slightly from others of the family Myxiidae: the polar capsules are located terminally and are elongated rather than subspherical (as in Myxidium), but they open to one side and their foramina are not located in the sutural plane (as in Zschokkella); the sutural line does not bisect the spore but is quite wavy, and does not reach the spore extremities (as in many Zschokkella). Subsequently, a new combination was formed when the genus Enteromyxum was erected based on molecular biology data as well as morphologyPalenzuela, O., Redondo M.J., Alvarez-Pellitero, P. (2002). Description of Enteromyxum scophthalmi gen. nov., sp. nov. (Myxozoa), an intestinal parasite of turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.) using morphological and ribosomal RNA sequence data. Parasitology 124, 369-79.. Today, the genus consists of only three intestinal species from marine fish hosts: E. leei, E. scopththalmi and E. fugu.  Life cycle  The life cycle of myxosporeans generally involves two alternating hosts: fish and annelids. Myxospores are ingested by annelids, in which actinospores are produced. The actinospores released from the annelid to the water reach a fish, penetrate and the developmental stages migrate until they reach the final site of infection and develop into myxospores. In contrast to this complex life cycle, spontaneous, direct fish-to-fish transmission has been demonstrated for E. leei and other species belonging to the genus Enteromyxum in various marine fishSitj√†-Bobadilla, A., Palenzuela, O.

Diseases of Aquatic Organims 92, 51-58.. All these trials depend on a source of infected fish, since continuous in vitro culture of this parasite, as with any other Myxozoa, has not been achieved. Although it is possible that this myxosporean parasite also has an indirect life cycle involving an invertebrate host in the wild, such putative intermediate has never been found. Rangel et al.Rangel, L.F., Cech, G., Szekely, C. et al. (2011). A new actinospore type Unicapsulactinomyxon (Myxozoa), infecting the marine polychaete, Diopatra neapolitana (Polychaeta: Onuphidae) in the Aveiro Estuary (Portugal). Parasitology 138, 698-712. found an actinospore infecting the marine polychaete Diopatra neapolitana in the Aveiro Estuary (Portugal) with an 81% similarity with E. leei, but no gilthead sea bream has been found with E. leei in Portuguese waters thus far.  Pathology and clinical signs  Common field observations include loss of appetite, poor food conversion rates and difficulties to reach commercial size. Clinical signs of enteromyxosis usually consist of severe emaciation with epiaxial muscle atrophy. This emaciation can be noticed externally as a knife or razor-like aspect. The emaciation is best noticed in subchronic infections at mild temperatures, with dead fish usually appearing wasted (caquexic). Emaciation can be imperceptible in very susceptible species and/or at high temperatures (e.g. D. puntazzo infections with E. leei), because fish die before reaching a caquexic condition. At dissection, macroscopical signs include intestinal focal congestion and haemorrhages, and it can appear fragile and semi-transparent, often filled with mucous liquid with reduced perivisceral fat deposits, pale internal organs and occasionally green liver. Enlarged or abnormally coloured gall bladders are common in some hosts (e.g. D. puntazzo). The histopathology shows the presence of myxozoan stages located between the enterocytes, or free in the lumen with debris in severe infections. Ribbons of epithelium containing parasite stages are detached. In advanced GSB infections with E. leei, the intestine displays hypertrophy of the lamina propria-submucosa and loss of the epithelial palisade structure, together with an intense local inflammatory responseCuadrado, M., Marques, A., Diamant, A., Sitj√†-Bobadilla, A., Palenzuela, O., √Ålvarez-Pellitero, P., Padr√≥s, F., Crespo, S.

Enteromyxum species. in: Woo, P.T.K, Buchmann K. (eds.), Parasites: Pathobiology and Protection. CAB Int., Oxfordshire, pp 163-176.. These intestinal changes heavily impair nutrient absorption. The inflammatory response varies depending on the host. In general, more susceptible species present more marked inflammatory response and detachment of epithelium occurs earlier in the infection.  Impact  The impact of enteromyxosis depends on the fish species, water temperature and the type of facilities involved in the aquaculture settings.

However, the economic impact on a global scale is unknown. Water temperature is a critical risk factor in the transmission and onset of enteromyxosis.

Water temperature, time of exposure and population density are key parameters in Enteromyxum leei fish-to-fish experimental transmission. Journal of Fish Diseases (in press).. The onset of the disease is largely delayed or even suppressed at low temperatures (below 15¬∞C). However, the infection can remain latent during the cooler period within the fish and re-emerge when water temperature increases. This has important epizootiological consequences, since false negatives (during winter) are a source of the parasite when water temperatures rise. The enteromyxosis has been described in all types of farming facilities (concrete/PVC tanks, earth ponds, sea cages). In gilthead sea bream land-based facilities other risk or aggravating factors include: (i) poor water exchange and/or re-intake of contaminated effluent water; (ii) recirculation systems; (iii) a prolonged culture period necessary for production of large fishJublanc, E., Toubiana, M., Sri Widada, J., et al.

Enteromyxum leei infection in parrotfish, Sparisoma cretense: Histopathological, morphological and molecular study. Veterinary Parasitology 199, 136-143.. In all the cases, the unique mode of horizontal transmission favours the spread of enteromyxoses in cultured fish stocks.  Diagnosis  Enteromyxosis cannot be diagnosed directly from the clinical signs, since these are nonspecific. Confirmatory diagnosis usually consists of the detection of Enteromyxum spores or other proliferative stages in smears of the intestine, either fresh or stained with diff-quick or May-Grunwald Giemsa. Detection of developmental stages in fresh smears is difficult and requires considerable experience. The examination of histological sections of intestine is the standard procedure, with the help of some stainings, such as periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Giemsa or toluidine blue, or some lectins. However, when the parasite is in in low numbers or with a patchy distribution, the infection may be missed. More recently, oligonucleotide probes have been used for the diagnosis of enteromyxosis using PCRShin, S.P., Sohn, H.C., Jin, C.N., Kang, B.J., Lee, J. (2018).

(2007). An unidentified epi-epithelial myxosporean in the intestine of gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata L. Parasitology Research 101, 403-411.. A non-lethal sampling procedure has been developed for PCR detection of E. leei by probing the rectum with a cotton swab. This procedure has been validated against a gold standard (histological observation of the whole digestive tract), with a high sensitivity (0.96) and specificity (Palenzuela, unpublished data).  Treatments  There are currently no approved therapies for E. leei.  Other control strategies  Prevention is the main focus for managing E. leei. Once the parasite becomes established, they are generally eradicated only with aggressive actions that include eliminating infected fish, disinfecting tanks, sea cages, drying ponds, etc. As this parasite cannot survive in freshwater, hyposalinity treatment has been suggested to control the infection in anemone fishYokohama, H., Shirakashi, S.

Research  Most of the research conducted on this parasite has been focused on gilthead sea bream and, more recently, in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). Recent efforts in the framework of the EU funded Horizon2020 Project ParaFishControl have been focused on obtaining transcriptomic data to find vaccine candidates and therapeutic targets, deciphering the host immune response and finding possible nutraceutical solutions. In addition, epidemiological studies are being conducted in the Mediterranean basin to determine the true impact of enteromyxosis and the host/farm factors that enhance or mitigate its extension. A protocol for the standard procedure to transmit this enteromyxosis under experimental conditions will be part of a guide to be published by 5M Publishing.

Life =Provenance and early years= Johanna Maria Katharina \\"Hanna\\" Decker was born in Nuremberg where Ignaz Decker (1876‚Äì1947), her father, worked as a tax and customs official. Her mother, born Maria-Anna J√§ger, came originally from Tirschenreuth in the extreme east of Bavaria. In 1922 Ignaz Decker was transferred to nearby Amberg. It was here that Johanna attended the junior school and the Lyceum of the Poor School Sisters (\\"Lyzeum der Armen Schulschwestern \\") between 1928 and 1934. The school has subsequently been renamed to celebrate its notable former pupil as the \\"Dr. Johanna Decker School\\". She was an exceptionally capable student, good at drawing and able to play the piano. It was still unusual for girls to attend a university, but after a further three years at the \\"Oberrealschule\\" (senior school) in Amberg she passed her Abitur (school final exams) in 1937, which opened the way to university-level education.

W√ºrzburger medizinhistorische Mitteilungen 21 (2002), pp. 490‚Äì518; p. 499 She embarked on her medical studies at Munich in October 1937. =Career choice and training= Decker engaged actively in the church's youth work, and by 1939 the idea of joining the missionary medical service had matured in her mind. It was in 1939 that she signed up with the Missionary Medical Institute (\\"Missions√§rztliches Institut W√ºrzburg\\") in W√ºrzburg, while continuing to pursue her medical studies at Munich. After her father's retirement the family moved to Heimstetten on the edge of Munich. As a student, for financial reasons, Hanna Decker continued to live with her parents. In 1942, at the height of the war, she passed her national medical exams and received her doctorate. She was then conscripted for work in a succession of hospitals and clinics, not necessarily working in her chosen disciplines. There was a year working in Obstetrics at a midwife training institution. In 1944 she moved to the main municipal hospital Mainz where initially she was assigned to the department for internal medicine. She was then transferred to a little 35-bed psychiatric section, set up with support from then local university, which in 1946 became a fully-fledged Psychiatric Clinic. In 1948 Decker qualified in Neuromedicine. (Neurology and Psychiatry were not, at that time, treated as separate disciplines.) In 1949 she set herself up as a psychiatric practitioner in Mainz (Stephanstra√üe 1). On the Feast of the Epiphany in 1946 Hanna Decker had taken a solemn vow that once her medical studies were completed she would dedicate at least ten years to missionary work. In 1950 she was sent by the Missionary Medical Institute to Bulawayo, then part of the British colony of Southern Rhodesia. After arranging for a successor at her little surgery in the Stephanstra√üe, she left Mainz on 15 August. She stayed a couple of weeks in W√ºrzburg and then took the train from Munich to Rome on 1 September 1950. With 24 other missionaries, on the morning of 6 September 1950 she enjoyed a private group audience with the pope. That afternoon she set off in a plane chartered by the missionary service. Stops along the way included (but were not limited to) Malta, Khartoum, Entebbe, Ndola and Johannesburg. They arrived in Bulawayo on 15 September 1950. Decker immediately joined the recently established (1948) Fatima Mission Hospital in a rural part of northern Matabeleland, roughly 130 miles / 200 km to the north-west of the city of Bulawayo. This is where her work was based till 1960. =Matabeleland: Fatima Mission Hospital= Throughout her time in Africa, she provided reports in letters to the Missionary Medical Institute in W√ºrzburg about her activities and experiences. In her very first letter (which is undated) she reports that the most frequently encountered diseases are \\"Tropical Malaria\\", Biharzia, (unspecified) venereal diseases and deep Muscle abscesses (\\"tiefe Muskelabszesse\\"). There are case descriptions and glimpses of patients' attitudes. \\"Natives\\" did not appreciate the true worth of free drug/medicine- based treatment. Friends and relatives accompanying patients would sometimes report that a patient \\"spoke a different language\\" in cases of \\"exogenous psychosis\\" (possibly intoxication through Pneumonia/Sepsis). From the outset she reported good cooperation with the Mariannhill Missionaries from South Africa, and this was a recurring theme throughout her time at the Fatima Mission Hospital. Early on there are references to tensions with Roman Catholic Missionaries from Spain operating in the area, however. Decker herself divides her twenty-eight years as a missionary doctor into two phases. The first consists of building up the medical provision, involving pioneering work and plenty of \\"start-up difficulties\\": that is followed by a second phase of operating under the \\"more or less normal circumstances of a rural hospital\\". (She would never need to concern herself with a third phase of letting go after a lifetime's commitment.) The pioneering build-up phase started with getting to know the local population, challenges of mutual understanding, the need for constant improvisation with regard to diagnoses and treatments, and above all shortages Addressing the shortages would involve adventurous and exhausting bus trips lasting several days, clutching the vital \\"medicines box\\", and often leaving her with the feeling of being \\"not so much a doctor as a salesman or woman, hawking goods and services from door to door\\". After those set-up phases, the second phase she identified in her medical-missionary career was no less strenuous or demanding. On her letters to her family and her newsletters she provides a good picture of her daily life. Writing in 1972, Father Odilo Weeger of the CMM, who worked alongside her, recalled that \\"Ninety approved beds, hundreds and hundreds of outpatients and visits to the outlying clinics at regular intervals kept the energetic Dr.Decker very busy.\\" Alongside the daily routines, in the evenings there were reports to be written and the accounts to be mainstained. There was virtually no free time. Nevertheless, writing to her parents in 1968 she was able to reassure them that \\"in the church we do indeed get a few hours to catch up with ourselves and also to think about the others\\". Occasional holidays, each lasting several weeks, took place every few years and were used to organise support, hold presentations or attend training courses. So these were not exactly holidays, and they also placed additional pressures on the colleague- doctor she left behind, unless a temporary locum doctor could be arranged. =Matabeleland: St. Paul's Mission Hospital= In 1960, Dekker moved to the St. Paul's mission station, still in northern Matabeleland, but on the other side of Lupane and approximately 40 miles / 75 km to the east of the Fatima Mission Hospital. There had been a \\"one teacher missionary school\\" at St. Paul's since 1952, staffed initially by an itinerant missionary, and during the subsequent eight years a certain amount of development had been undertaken. In 1953 a small dispensary was established, visited once a month (later once a week) by a doctor from the Fatima mission. In 1957/58 the dispensary became a clinic. The authorities now began insisting on a \\"European\\" nurse, but none was available. By 1960 a reliable water supply had been created with the digging of a borehole, and in 1959/60 Johanna Decker moved permanently to St.Paul's. Teaming up with CMM missionaries, she was mandated with turning the clinic into a 24-bed hospital. An x-ray machine was purchased in 1965. More buildings were added, with a dedicated maternity block opening in 1968 and new nurses accommodation in 1972/73, reflecting continuing expansion of facilities for inpatients, outpatients, and discharged inpatients still needing somewhere to convalesce safely before they could be fully discharged. The total cost of the building and the extensive surrounding infrastructure involved amounted to the equivalent of roughly 640,000 Marks, of which the West German government agreed to pay 75%, leaving Misereor, the charitable wing of the Roan Catholic church in Germany, to pay the balance. Although the area was a rural one, there was a relatively large population to be looked after. According to one source Hanna Decker sometimes found herself as the only fully qualified medical doctor within a 100 kilometer radius. Nevertheless, from her correspondence it is clear that much of Dr. Decker's own workload was administrative rather than medical. Much of what she writes concerns personnel matters, building construction management and the permanently pressing problems of finance. There was also much preoccupation with transport challenges. There was a long wheelbase Land Rover which, especially in wet weather, was indispensable, but it also broke down frequently. Between 1964 and 1971 they had the use of a Volkswagen Beetle which cold be used for shopping and deliveries. That was replaced by a Peugeot 204 \\"multi purpose vehicle\\" (station wagon?) which could also be used for local ambulance work, but not in \\"the bush\\". Once the initial start-up phase was completed, records show a local hospital staff comprising 10 nurses, 6‚Äì8 midwifery trainees and 15 care assistants. Sources refer to estimates that within the catchment area covered by the St. Paul's Mission Hospital there were between 40,000 and 60,000 people living. Statistics for 1972 show that the number of \\"approved beds\\" had by that time risen to 90, while the number of \\"actual\\" hospital beds was 122. That year records indicated there were 3,500 inpatients and 20,000 outpatients. In addition, extensive staff training programmes were operated in partnership with the Fatima Mission Hospital. Following all the investments, St. Paul's had by this time become the most \\"technically advanced\\" of all the hospitals. On the early afternoon of 9 August 1977 two heavily armed \\"drunken terrorists\\" / \\"nationalist guerillas\\" forced their way through the hospital main door. On their way, they had already killed a senior worker, put out someone's eyes and beaten patients outside the hospital building. They found Dr. Decker and her Austrian-born colleague, Sister Ferdinanda Ploner, a recently arrived South African passport holder, examining and treating patients in the dispensary. They demanded money. Decker gave them the contents of the cash till, but this was insufficient so she told the attackers that she had more money in her house which she would go and collect. While Decker and Ploner were walking to the house the attackers shot them dead using Kalashnikovs. Later it was established that Johanna Decker had been killed by a single shot, Ploner's death involved eight shots. As the war intensified, the murder of Hanna Decker resonated widely in southern Africa and western Europe, putting an abrupt end to the history of the St. Paul's Mission Hospital.

It is an intestinal parasite of the turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) and can cause outbreaks of disease in farmed fish. It causes a cachectic syndrome characterised by loss of weight, muscle atrophy, weakness and fatigue. Taxonomy This parasite was first described in 2002 by Palenzuela, Redondo & Alvarez-Pellitero using material obtained from the gut of a turbot (Scophthalmus maximus). The fish were obtained from a farm in northwestern Spain. After examination with light and electron microscopy, and by comparing its ribosomal DNA with that of similar myxozoan species, it was established that this species was closely related to Myxidium leei, another enteric parasite of marine fish, but not to other members of the genus Myxidium. A combination of morphological data and data from molecular analysis resulted in the new genus Enteromyxum being created to include both the new species, E. scophthalmi, and the former species M. leei, which thus became Enteromyxum leei. Life cycle The host fish becomes infected after swallowing the pathogen. In newly infected fish, the parasites quickly penetrate the gut epithelium and spread to other parts of the digestive tract, both through the lumen of the gut, whence they can be voided as infective agents into the open water, and through the connective tissue and small capillaries surrounding the gut. The parasites can also be found in the heart, muscular tissue and other organs, suggesting that there are other means of transmission through the body, including transport via the vascular system. The life cycle of the pathogen is not known; spores seldom develop inside the turbot, and it is possible that the fish is an accidental host, or that the parasite has a two- host life cycle. The condition causes wasting, with muscle atrophy and fatigue; it is very virulent, there is no known treatment and the mortality rate is high.

Running for over eight years, Jake and Amir was CollegeHumor's longest-running series and has amassed approximately one billion views as of April 2017. The series served as the debut of the comedy duo Jake and Amir, who would go on collaborate on other comedy projects.  Concept  Some episodes have a common theme or MacGuffin that the episode revolves around, for instance buying a guitar or discussing the 2008 financial crisis. The series generally takes place at Jake and Amir's desks, but some episodes are filmed in other parts of the office or different locations entirely. Dan Frommer of Business Insider explains how \\"a trip to Florida became a four-part miniseries...broken-arm casts become props...[and] girlfriends become actresses\\". Amir is obsessed with Jake, and often says or does annoying things to try to spend time with him. Amir is also obsessed with fast food chain McDonald's, especially Chicken McNuggets. He is unhealthy, doesn't do any work, and lacks common sense and basic knowledge about the world. He can also be very aggressive or physically abusive towards his co- workers, who generally hate him. In later episodes, Jake has sometimes been portrayed as comically insecure, with Amir taking on the straight man role. Rapper Hoodie Allen appeared in three episodes as Amir's rap teacher. NBA player Rick Fox featured in the series as Amir's bookie, who causes Amir to lose significant amounts of money. Comedian Thomas Middleditch was frequently featured in the series as Doobs, Amir's childhood frenemy. Comedian Ben Schwartz appeared in 22 episodes of the show. Actress Allison Williams appeared as Cheryl in two episodes. Competitive eater Takeru Kobayashi appears briefly in the episode Jake and Amir: Kobayashi, where Amir feeds him hot- dogs. Three of The Gregory Brothers appeared in an episode and released an accompanying song featuring Amir on their own YouTube channel. Actor Kumail Nanjiani was featured in four episodes as Jake's brother. Actor Ed Helms appeared in one of the last Jake and Amir episodes, Finale part 5, as Amir's friend Mickey.  History  The series began in May 2007 when Jake and Amir began making sketch comedy videos starring the two of them. Originally sixty- second videos edited in iMovie and uploaded to Vimeo, the first episodes of Jake and Amir were just something that Jake and Amir did to make each-other laugh. Eventually, however, the videos gained such popularity that CollegeHumor began paying them to make the videos for their website. Jake explains that Jake and Amir was never intended to be a series: On October 12, 2011, CollegeHumor released Jake and Amir: Fired, a thirty-minute episode of Jake and Amir that the pair made in the previous months while continuing to release short episodes. Available for purchase on CollegeHumor's website, Facebook, and available on DVD, the special was the company's first paid content. Its plot involves the fictitious new CEO of CollegeHumor, Alan Avery ‚Äì played by Matt Walton ‚Äì promoting Jake and firing Amir. Jake and Amir work together to get Amir's job back. Jake and Amir: Fired was directed by Sam Reich. While working at CollegeHumor, Jake and Amir hosted live events as their characters from Jake and Amir, including CollegeHumor Live at locations such as the UCB Theatre in New York and the University of California, Berkeley. They have also performed in Toronto and London's Soho Theatre with Streeter Seidell in 2013. Though the latter show was sold out and extra dates were added, the performance was poorly received by local media: The Guardian Brian Logan said Jake and Amir \\"cackle a lot, as they find various ways to repackage tales of puerile behaviour as comedy.\\" In June 2012, at the International Student Film Festival in Tel Aviv, Israel, the pair gave a lecture at the New Media Conference. The duo started thinking about leaving CollegeHumor when their new podcast If I Were You began to take-off in 2015. After deciding to leave the website, CollegeHumor announced in January 2015 that the series would air its last eight episodes beginning on February 17, 2015. On October 27, 2016, the pair returned to CollegeHumor for a single episode of Jake and Amir, titled Jake and Amir: Donald Trump, to comment on the 2016 United States presidential election. In 2018, the duo released a new web series hosted on Patreon entitled Jake and Amir Watch Jake and Amir. In the series, the titular comedians watch and review episodes of their Jake and Amir series while providing behind-the-scenes information. Jake and Amir have expressed interest in producing a new scripted series if their Patreon page reaches 10,000 subscribers. On March 31, 2020, a new episode titled Jake and Amir: Social Distance Scroll was uploaded to the HeadGum YouTube channel.  Reception  Jake and Amir has received praise as its style and viewership has evolved and expanded, particularly within the field of free online content. Jake and Amir won the People's Voice award for Best Comedy: Long Running Form or Series in the 2010 Webby Awards, with Amir also capturing the People's Voice award for Best Individual Performance that year. Amir was nominated for Best Male Actor in a Comedy Web Series in the first, second, and third Streamy Awards for his role in Jake and Amir. In 2008, PC Magazine listed the series among its \\"Top 100 Undiscovered Web Sites\\", saying: \\"Considering it's mainly a hobby they do after work, the webisodes at JakeAndAmir.com are better than some of the stuff they get paid to do for CollegeHumor.\\" PC Magazine featured Jake and Amir again in 2011, when it listed the series as one of its \\"15 Best Web-Only Shows\\", commenting that, \\"they show no sign of running out of very bizarre situations for this sometimes disturbing comedy.\\"  List of episodes  = 2007 = = 2008 = = 2009 = = 2010 = = 2011 = = 2012 = = 2013 = = 2014 = = 2015 = = 2016 = = 2020 =  References   External links  * Jake and Amir's official website * Jake and Amir section on CollegeHumor.com Category:CollegeHumor Category:2000s YouTube series Category:2007 web series debuts Category:2016 web series endings Category:American comedy web series Category:2010s YouTube series ","title":"Jake and Amir (web series)"},{"id":"61499989","text":"The 1931 Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association Men's Basketball Tournament took place from February 25‚ÄìFebruary 28, 1931, at Jackson, MS.

Biography =Background= Qawali is from the Tuz Khurmato region of Iraq's Saladin Governorate, is in his fifties and from a poor background, and lived by a river which he would draw water from and transport with his tractor to other areas to earn an income. He was described as a calm individual, and reportedly held ties to Mullah Krekar an Islamist cleric and founder of Ansar al-Islam, and is also alleged to have had ties to ISIL. Qawali was also a member the Kurdistan Democratic Party and a supporter of Masoud Barzani as well as a volunteer of its armed branch Peshmerga, and carried out attacks with his supporters against Iraqi government forces and allied paramilitary groups by riding horses, motorcycles and 4-wheel drive vehicles and launching the attacks from the Hamrin Mountains. Between 2015 and 2016 he participated in riots in Tuz Khurmato and allegedly burned down houses belonging to Iraqi Turkmen. =Militant activity= In April 2016 he took part in clashes against Iraqi Security Forces, and Kurdish media outlets showed photos of him removing the flag of Kata'ib Hezbollah afterwards. Qawali was quoted by Rudaw about the event, \\"There was an Iraqi flag in the place but I did not approach it, and I just threw the Popular Mobilization Forces flag,\\" adding \\"The president of the Kurdistan region Massoud Barzani can only repair the situation, so I invite him to intervene.\\" During the break out of fighting between Iraq's government and Kurdish forces in October 2017, he attacked the Popular Mobilization Forces headquarters in Tuz Khurmato after the arrival of the Iraqi Army in the town.

After emigrating with her family from the Russian Empire to escape persecution because of their Jewish heritage, the family toured Europe and then looked for work in Argentina and Paraguay, before moving to Magallanes, now known as Punta Arenas, in 1874. Educated in the public school system, Braun soon joined her father to help administer the naval warehouse of the Portuguese shipping magnate Jos√© Nogueira, whom she married in 1887. The two worked together to build a business empire. When Nogueira died in 1893, Braun took over his leases to land in Tierra del Fuego and took control of his commercial, industrial and shipping interests. She also established an import trading house and group of warehouses, becoming one of the first women to run a business in the area. With the help of her brother, Mauricio Braun, she established the Sociedad Explotadora de Tierra del Fuego (Society for the Exploitation of Tierra del Fuego) in August 1893 to engage in sheep farming. Through family ties and astute trading, they created a monopolistic company which controlled sheep production in the region and significantly influenced the development of southern Chile. Involved in many charitable endeavors, Braun was celebrated for her benevolence. Later scholarship has uncovered the history of the Braun family and their business partners in the Men√©ndez family in the genocide of the Selk'nam people. Her mansion is preserved as a museum in Punta Arenas, and the Sara Braun Foundation, established at her death, provides scholarship funds to students for higher education. Early life Sara Braun was born on 17 December 1862 in Talsi, in Courland (now Latvia) in the Russian Empire to Sof√≠a Hamburger and El√≠as Braun. She was the oldest of seven siblings: Mauricio, Oscar, Ana, Fanny, Mayer, and Juan. Her father was a tinsmith and the family was of Jewish heritage. Threatened by the persecution of Jews in the Pale of Settlement, the family moved abroad, first touring Europe and then settling in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1872. Unable to find stable employment, they traveled back and forth between Paraguay and Argentina looking for work. At the time, Guillermo Blest Gana, a Chilean diplomat, was seeking recruits to relocate to the Magallanes Region of his country. The Braun family agreed to travel to Magallanes, now known as Punta Arenas, in 1874. Joining 46 other immigrants, they arrived in February of that year, when Braun was 12. Career =Early career= Educated in the public school in Magallanes, Braun helped her parents raise her younger siblings. As the family integrated into the town's society, they met Jos√© Nogueira, a Portuguese shipping magnate. Braun's father gained Nogueira's trust and was hired to oversee his naval warehouse, and Sara helped her father with the administration of the depot. By the middle of the 1880s, Nogueira had become one of the wealthiest businessmen of the area and proposed to Braun. The couple married in 1887, when Noguiera was 42 and Sara was 24. With his wife and her family, Noguiera intended to create businesses in the southern zones to capitalize on the farming opportunities, but died before that was fully accomplished. Braun was actively engaged in the Braun Nogueira businesses, offering her advice and vision to her husband. In April 1889, Nogueira was able to secure a lease from the government of of Fuegian land, and seven months later, his brother-in-law Mauricio Braun leased another . The following year Nogueira acquired, along with Braun, a 20-year lease for of additional land from President Jos√© Manuel Balmaceda's administration, with the proviso that he establish a Chilean business association to implement the project. Altogether, the leases gave Nogueira and his relatives control over one third of the of land available in Tierra del Fuego. In order to meet the requirement for the enterprise to be Chilean (as neither Nogueira or Braun were, at the time) Nogueira agreed to sell one third of his lease rights to Ram√≥n Serrano Montaner. Before he could complete the incorporation of the Sociedad Explotadora de Tierra del Fuego (Society for the Exploitation of Tierra del Fuego), Nogueira died in 1893. Braun began assuming management of all of his enterprises, with the \\"permanent help of her brothers Mauricio and Oscar\\", \\"becoming the first businesswoman in the history of Magallanes\\". =Society for the Exploitation of Tierra del Fuego= Having inherited all but Serrano's interest in her husband's estate, Braun approached her brother Mauricio for advice on how best to settle the debt with Serrano. After a difficult negotiation between the two men, Serrano agreed to accept one hundred shares of the company stock, instead of the lease. The company was incorporated on . The major shareholders were Braun, her brother Mauricio, and the rest of their family; Juan Blanchard, a partner in the firm Braun & Blanchard; and Peter H. McClelland, the head of the firm Duncan, Fox & Co Ltd. This group controlled almost half of the company shares; the balance of shares, in order to ensure that a majority of investors were Chilean, belonged to sundry business people from Magallanes and Valpara√≠so. Initially the company engaged in sheep farming, and the auctioning of livestock and land. Besides the land leases in Patagonia, Braun inherited Nogueira's other commercial, industrial and shipping interests, and established an import trading house and group of warehouses. She formed a livestock company with McClelland and began importing sheep. Initially, the business also brought in foreign administrators and sheep tenders, as well as industrial technology to equip the farm for shearing and wool processing. As the company grew, local laborers were trained to take on many of the positions in the company. The Exploitation Society's reputation for providing for workers, which included allowing laborers to buy food on credit until the next seasonal hiring, made the business a popular employer. Palacio Sara Braun, exterior Palacio Sara Braun, interior The Society's development of the sheep industry in Patagonia displaced the original inhabitants of those lands. The building of fences created obstacles for the nomadic life of the Selk'nam people and introduction of sheep herds displaced their main food source, the guanaco. Facing starvation, they began to steal livestock. The Exploitation Society asked and received permission from the Chilean government to remove the indigenous population from the area. Jos√© Men√©ndez, one of the shareholders of the company, and Mauricio's father-in- law, gave orders for the extermination of the Selk'nam. In 1895, Braun hired Numa Mayer, a French architect, to construct a mansion for her at 716 Mu√±oz Gamero Plaza, in Magallanes. The French neoclassical building took more than 10 years to complete and featured a large winter garden conservatory and a columned portico. The interior featured European furnishings and ornamentation throughout. In 1901, Braun married Leoncio Valenzuela Crespo, a rear admiral in the Chilean Navy and a member of the Board of the Exploitation Society. The marriage was not successful and was annulled in 1929. By 1905, the Exploitation Society had expanded into neighboring territory in Argentine Patagonia. Through a series of negotiations and purchases of smaller investors in the region, by 1910, Braun and her partners controlled some of land. The expansion into Argentina led Braun to found the Sociedad An√≥nima Ganadera y Comercial Sara Braun (Sara Braun Livestock and Commercial Company) in 1914. This association was dedicated to managing the Estancia Pecket Harbour (Pecket Harbour Station). In the 21st century, the Historical Truth Commission of 2008 and related scholarship uncovered the involvement of the Braun and Men√©ndez families in the genocide of the Selk'nam people, calling into question their laudable reputation. =Humanitarian and charitable work= With the events of the Russian Revolution and World War I, a new international progressive movement led to less focus on business expansion and more attention to social issues, including the quality of life of workers. The Exploitation Society began to supply housing, which in some cases allowed workers to live with their families and provided food and wood allowances to ensure the health of the workforce and the heating of their homes. Braun became involved with various charitable endeavors, including the Asilo de Hu√©rfanos de Punta Arenas (the Orphan Asylum of Punta Arenas), the Chilean Red Cross, the Gota de Leche (Drop of Milk), Liga de las Damas Cat√≥licas, (League of Catholic Ladies), and the Sociedad de dolores de beneficencia (Charitable Society of Sorrows). She was also the patron of the Sixth Firemen's Company, donated land for building several schools, and was the donor for the portico at the entrance of the Punta Arenas Cemetery. On , Braun became a naturalized citizen of Chile and moved to Vi√±a del Mar, where she lived at 490 √Ålvarez Street. In recognition of Braun's philanthropy, in 1936 the Ministry of Public Education renamed the Liceo de Ni√±as de Punta Arenas (Girls' Lyceum of Punta Arenas) in her honor. The government had already renamed the trade school attached to the Colegio Mar√≠a Auxiliadora after her in 1919. She was honored by the City of Punta Arenas as their Benefactora P√∫blica (Public Benefactor) in 1945. Her last public appearance in Punta Arenas was in 1948, when she donated a building for the Red Cross to the city. At the time, she was ill and her brother Mauricio had to deliver her speech. In her last years, Braun was cared for by her niece, Fanny Gazit√∫a, daughter of Fanny Braun and Abraham Gazit√∫a Brieba. Pedro Poklepovic, a liberal politician who was married to Braun's niece Doris, managed her finances in the last years of her life. Death Braun died at her home in Vi√±a del Mar on 22 April 1955 and was buried in the Cemetery of Punta Arenas, officially known as the Cementerio Municipal Sara Braun. Because she had no children, she bequeathed her estate to her brother Juan Braun and her nieces and nephews. Her niece, Fanny Gazit√∫a, who had cared for her at the end of her life, was made an executor of the estate, inherited the home on √Ålvarez Street with all its contents, and was charged with establishing a Foundation bearing her name to provide higher education scholarships to students. Legacy At the time of her death, Braun was mourned as a prominent citizen and philanthropist of Patagonia. Flags flew at half mast, businesses closed in her honor, and speeches were made by dignitaries. In addition to family members, Braun left over 15,000 shares of stock in the Exploitation Society to friends, servants, and acquaintances, who were involved in helping mitigate poverty, provide for underprivileged children or elders in need of care or were widows. She left outright stock donations to the various charities she had contributed to during her lifetime, as well as the San Juan de Dios Sanatorium of Vi√±a del Mar; the Children's Hospital of Valpara√≠so; and the Sacred Family Asylum in Punta Arenas. In 1981, Braun's mansion, which had been purchased intact with furnishings upon her death by the Union Club of Punta Arenas, was declared a Historic Monument, known as the .

He served as President of South China Agricultural University from 1983 to 1995, and was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1993. He was named China's second most generous philanthropist in 2017 after donating his entire life savings to his university.  Early life and education  Lu was born on 2 December 1930 in British Hong Kong, into a middle-class family that hailed from Hua County (now Huadu), Guangdong province. When the Japanese attacked Hong Kong in 1941, his father sent him to Hua County for safety, where he became familiarized with agricultural practices. He returned to Hong Kong two years later for middle school. This experience with Japanese invasion made him sympathetic to the Communist cause, and in 1947 he joined the New Democratic Youth Association of Hong Kong, which was secretly led by the Communist Party of China, and the Party itself in August 1949. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Lu moved to Guangzhou to study agriculture at Lingnan University. In 1952, the agricultural schools of Lingnan University and Sun Yat-sen University were merged to form South China Agricultural College (now South China Agricultural University), and Lu became one of the first students of the new college.  Career  Upon graduation in August 1953, Lu was hired by South China Agricultural College as an assistant professor and later lecturer. He formed a close relationship with Ding Ying, the first president of the college, and served as the latter's research assistant and secretary from 1962 to 1964. Ding had collected more than 7,000 seeds of wild rice for research and conservation. After Ding's death in 1964, Lu took over the collection and further expanded it to more than 10,000 seeds. Lu made significant contributions to the research of rice genetics, especially the \\"specific compatibility gene\\".

Philanthropy  Lu lived a frugal life and regularly ate at the school cafeteria with students, but made annual donations to education and poverty relief. In 2014, he donated two ancestral houses in his hometown Huadu to the local primary school. In 2017, Lu and his wife, Professor Xu Xuebin (), donated their entire lifetime savings of 8.8 million yuan (US$1.34 million) to South China Agricultural University. It was the largest single donation ever received by the university. They left no inheritance to their only daughter, who Lu said was capable of supporting herself. The Ash Center of Harvard Kennedy School ranked him at No. 2 in its list of most generous Chinese philanthropists for 2017, and he was selected as one of the ten people featured on China Central Television's annual program People Who Moved China.

He was the son of cousins, Mary (n√©e Bard) Bard and Samuel Bard, a prominent doctor who was a founder of Columbia University's medical school and physician to George Washington. His younger sister, Eliza, was the wife of John McVickar, the First Rector of St. James Church in Hyde Park and professor at Columbia University. His paternal grandparents were Suzanne (n√©e Valleau) Bard, a granddaughter and heiress of Pierre Fauconnier, and John Bard, a friend of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin who had invested in Hyde Park, then a 3,600 acre plantation.

There he built a large house in West New Brighton, located on the north shore of the island, at Bard Ave. (which was named for him) and Delafield Place. He was offered the position of president of Columbia College, but declined the offer. He later founded the New York Life Insurance and Trust Company, which was the first insurance company in New York, and served as its first president.

As a result of this, on May 12 a tremendous disorder was carried out that attested to the disagreement that still existed among the population, since while some shouted through the streets the return of Iturbide others supported the republic .

Of the 50 mainland Chinese on board, 29 were rescued by Taiwan's Navy. It was the second tragedy in repatriation of mainland Chinese illegal immigrants in less than a month after Min Ping Yu No. 5540 incident. Background Fujian fishermen numbering in thousands each year sneaked across the strait into Taiwan after the lifting of martial law in Taiwan in 1987, as the economy of Taiwan was much better than that of mainland China at the time. Since the ROC government refused any contact with the PRC government, the ROC government repatriated them by seized mainland Chinese fishing boats. Taiwanese authorities ordered that deportees be locked in sealed holds to prevent them from forcing the ship to return to Taiwan. On July 21, 1990, 25 mainland Chinese illegal immigrants died from suffocation on fishing boat Min Ping Yu No. 5540 in a repatriation operation, which had caused indignation in mainland China and Taiwan. In response to criticisms from the Taiwanese public, on August 13, a high-profile repatriation was arranged by the Taiwanese authorities. Legislators and the media were invited to witness the repatriation of mainland Chinese illegal immigrants. Before the repatriation operation, legislators including Jaw Shaw-kong, Lin Cheng-chieh and Stella Chou visited \\"Jinglu\\" detention center and talked to the mainland Chinese illegal immigrants to be repatriated in this operation. The boat departed from Nanfang'ao Port, Su'ao Town, Yilan County, Taiwan Province carrying 50 mainland Chinese illegal immigrants and was accompanied by Taiwan naval vessels. Incident At 10:08 pm on August 13, at 13 nautical miles to the north of Keelung, the fishing boat was hit by the accompanying frigate ROCS Wen Shan PF-834 and broke into two pieces. The rear part of the boat sank. A rescue operation by the Taiwan's Navy followed and saved 29 people. They were taken back to Keelung military port at 4pm the next day and a press conference was held. According to the captain of the frigate, the boat accelerated and veered to the left in front of the frigate, so the frigate hit the boat, while survivors said that the frigate hit the boat while swerving to avoid a Taiwanese fishing boat. The survivors also accused the Taiwan's Navy of delaying rescue operation which had caused more deaths, which the Navy captain denied. The survivors also said that people had been kept in sealed holds, but they had opened the covers before the incident, otherwise there would have been more victims. Later, the Taiwan military did not allow the survivors to speak out to the media while being held again in the detention center. Aftermath The Taiwan government was under heavy criticisms for the two repatriation operations which caused a total of 46 deaths in less than a month. ROC Premier Hau Pei-tsun said that the repatriation was a matter of national security and the public should support the military. The Red Cross organizations of Taiwan and mainland China signed the Kinmen Agreement and took over the repatriation mission on September 12, 1990. The shipwreck had caused a public outrage in Pingtan, Fujian, as it was the second incident claiming many lives of people from there. The deputy director of Taiwan Affairs Office of Pingtan County Xue Laijin said that it was not an accident, but a result of Taiwan government's constant maltreatment of mainland Chinese illegal immigrants. An investigation by the Control Yuan found that the frigate had failed to keep distance with the fishing boat, and the Navy had not actively carried out the rescue operation after the shipwreck, and had not made full effort to salvage the boat to preserve evidence, so the Navy was responsible for the shipwreck.

Background  90% of Oaxacans were indigenous, most of the Spaniards and mestizos lived in Oaxaca City. For the great merchants who supported the independence of Oaxaca from the town hall, it was the economic nature, because in 1822, due to the precarious national economy, the imperial government demanded a contribution of more than 200,000 thousand pesos. That is, the main actors during the independence movement were army officers, militias and representatives of the town hall based in Antequera . = Call for unity = In Oaxaca, despite the fact that the executive branch and the Congress called for the formation of a new Congress with more broad powers that constituted the nation under the indirect election system, assigning a deputy to every 50 000 inhabitants or to the fractions that After 40,000, the latter was not well received. During the War Board in Oaxaca, 72 people participated, of which few were from the Army and militias, predominantly General Antonio de Le√≥n.  Rebellion  With this measure most of the provinces returned to calm, however, the Oaxaca government returned the call decreed in accordance with general opinion and decreed a provincial government, the people rose in arms and proclaimed their independence from Mexico as \\"Free and Federal State of Oaxaca\\". For this reason, the provisional government decided to resort to military force to quell the uprising as was done with the Guadalajara Rebellion, achieving calm after its taking.  Aftermath  The draft declaration of independence supported by merchants was not distinguished by its liberal characteristics, but the struggle to achieve what they had been seeking since the introduction of the intendancies in 1786. Independence would mean the return to the powerful position they held before senior Crown officials came to control the Oaxaca province.  References  * RIVA PALACIO, Vicente (1940).

Design and development The BRO-16 was a single-seat training glider, unusual for being both a biplane and a seaplane. It was a development of the BRO-11 land monoplane produced some twenty years earlier and first flew in August 1973. Its wings were rectangular in plan out to rounded tips. The lower wing was 25% shorter in span than the upper but with about the same chord and ply-covered in contrast to the fabric covered upper wing. Both wings had single-spar structures and were braced together with wide spread, transverse, streamlined and distorted V-struts between the spars. There was no stagger, 3¬∞ of dihedral and a large interplane gap. The BRO-16's push-rod activated, fabric-covered ailerons, which could also serve as flaps, were suspended from the upper wing and filled 87% of the span. The BRO-19's fuselage had a forward nacelle attached to a flat girder fuselage supporting the tail. The largely wooden nacelle was long and flat-bottomed. The cockpit, close to the nose, was open and placed the pilot over the leading edge of the lower wing which was mounted on the side of the nacelle, about halfway back. The rear of the fuselage was formed by a horizontal girder member, just under the upper wing, attached to the nacelle with a pair of vertical struts between the wings and an oblique strut from the rear of the nacelle to the top of the aft vertical strut. Wires braced the rear fuselage to the wing struts and to the nacelle. Parts of the girder were canvas-covered. The tail was conventional. Though the triangular fin was very small, the rudder was large, nearly rectangular in profile apart from a blunted top and a slightly angled underside. The tailplane was triangular in plan and carried rectangular elevators. All the tail surfaces were fabric-covered wooden structures.

She has served as editor of Lilith since 1995. Schnur was ordained as a rabbi by the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in 1982, making her among the first 12 female Reconstructionist rabbis and among the first 61 female rabbis altogether in the world. She has described herself as a \\"recovering rabbi,\\" and views Lilith as her \\"paper pulpit\\" from which she preaches Jewish feminism. Through Lilith, she has said, she and her co-editors \\"helped to transform Judaism into something beautiful and plausible for thousands of Jewish women.\\" After becoming a rabbi, Schnur later became a clinical psychologist. Schnur has been widely noted for her writings on forgiveness, which show how gender matters in discussions of forgiveness and which break down rigid distinctions between forgiving and not forgiving. Schnur has written for many publications, and formerly wrote a weekly column for the New York Times.

After the 64-metre Urnerloch in the Gotthard Pass (Switzerland) and the eastern bore of the Ilzdurchbruch in Passau (Bavaria) it is the oldest known road tunnel in Europe. In earlier times it was also one of the city gates of the historic Altstadt. From 1916 to 1940 a tramline ran through it, and since then it has formed part of a route of the trolleybuses in Salzburg.  Earlier projects  Street map of Salzburg showing the Sigmundstor cutting through the M√∂nschberg Ferdinand Olivier - View of Salzburg and the Hohensalzburg Fortress from the M√∂nschberg In 1675 the court commissioner of buildings Michael Springrueber approached Hofkriegsrat Guidobald Franz Freiherr von Hegi with a proposal to improve the fortifications protecting the central areas of Salzburg city, cutting the M√∂nschberg ridge in two, and connecting the parts with a drawbridge. This would prevent any enemy that had succeeded in taking the Monika and Augustiner forts from making its way along the M√∂nschberg right up to the outer works of the castle and from bombarding the old town from the heights. In 1676 Hegi made the same proposal to the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg, Max Gandolph von K√ºenburg and set out to see whether the M√∂nchsberg could indeed be cut at its narrowest point. In this proposal he mentioned for the first time the utility of the project for allowing the expansion of the city. The valley lowlands of Riedenburg could be made accessible by means of the cut and could allow room for settlers from the old town; the new district would also be militarily easy to secure. From 1676 until Max Galdolf‚Äôs death in 1687 excavations proceeded and a 35m wide cut was made in the mountain before work was abandoned as uneconomical. Traces of this work can still be seen today near the concert hall and in the lookout terrace cut into the rock above the Sigmundstor.  Construction  memorial plaque in the Sigmundstor In 1759 the commissioner of buildings Elias Edler von Geyer again suggested a cut through the M√∂nchsberg to the then Prince-Archbishop Sigismund von Schrattenbach. After delays caused by concerns about its feasibility the project began on 14 May 1764. Digging started on both sides of the mountain and on 2 September 1765 the dividing rock between the two excavations was broken. The work cost 19, 820 Gulden, including 11, 538 Gulden on the gateways alone. The excavation of the 135m long tunnel, 5.5m wide and 7m high produced around 4,500 m¬≥ of waste stone which was used for roadbuilding. The tunnel is dug at an 8% inclination, which helps natural light illuminate it.  Decorative features  The facades at both ends of the tunnel were from an architectural design by :de:Wolfgang Hagenauer with the sculptures by :de:Johann Baptist Hagenauer. = the eastern entrance = Relief at the eastern entrance of the Sigmundstor At the tunnel entrance on the old town side an inscription was carved over a bas-relief of the Prince-Archbishop with the words Te saxa loquuntur (‚ÄúThe stones will speak of you.‚Äù). Originally the structure of the baroque horsepond with its frescoes extended in front of the current eastern gate, giving the square a symmetrical form. A decorative gate within that structure led under cover to the present gate at the head of the tunnel. Thus structure was demolished around 1860. Western entrance of the Sigmundstor = The western entrance = St. Sigismund over the western entrance The western entrance on the Riedenburg side has a statue of the martyr Sigismund of Burgundy (‚Ä†524) above war trophies and the Schrattenbach crest. The inscription there reads: ‚ÄúD(eo) O(ptimo) M(aximo) - D(ivino) Sigismundo M(artyri) publico bono, commodo decori. SIgIsMVnDI ArChIepIsCopI SaLzVrgensIs P(rincepis) S(acri) R(omani imperii) comitib(us) de Schrattenbach aeternae memoriae W(olfgangus) Hagenauer archit(ectus)‚Äú The capital letters in the inscription, added together, come to 1767. The plinth of the statue carries the inscription ‚ÄúJoan(nnae) Hagenauer inv(enit) exc(ussit) et eff(ecit)‚Äú (‚ÄúJohann (Baptist) Hagenauer discovered, hewed it out and completed (this statue)‚Äú). = Proposed defensive ruin = The original plan included the construction of a military outer structure on the Riedenburg side in the form of a park of ‚Äòruins‚Äô, then fashionable. These constructed ruins were to vote the memory of the Roman settlement of Juvavum and symbolise the long history of the city of Salzburg. Because of the death of Prince-Archbishop Sigismund in 1772 nothing more than a pair of obelisks as ever completed. Johann Baptist von Hagenauer was sacked after a quarrel with the thrifty new Archbishop Colloredo, although his brother continued to serve as the court director of buildings.  The former Zwinger in front of the west gate  Until around 1860 the Sigmundstor was defended on its western side by a fortified defensive Zwinger, including a defensive wall, guardhouse and tollbooth, surrounded in three sides by a moat with drawbridges. The tunnel itself could be defended with a palisade in the event of attack.  Contemporary significance  Today the Sigmundstor with two narrow lanes of traffic is an important transport route, often full of vehicles during the Salzburg Festival when the city is busy. To the north of the main tunnel is a small parallel tunnel for pedestrians and cyclists, built in 1968/9. From this an access tunnel extends to the northern old town garage under the M√∂nchsberg. On the southern side a similar tunnel extends to the southern garage and to the concert hall itself. The original name of the tunnel was never popular among the townspeople. Only in 1990 was the designation ‚ÄúSigmundstor‚Äù more widely adopted, when the square on the old town side, Sigmundsplatz, (named after Sigismundus Christoph von Schrattenbach) was renamed in honour of the recently deceased conductor Herbert von Karajan. More commonly however the people of Salzburg refer to it as the ‚ÄúNeutor‚Äù (‚ÄúNew Gate‚Äù) and indeed the street that leads to it is known as the ‚ÄúNeutorstra√üe‚Äú. The tunnel underwent major restoration works in 1985/6 and 2009. Before the 2019 city council and mayoral elections the SP√ñ, NEOS and the Gr√ºne proposed to ban private cars from the Sigmundstor. However after losing the first round of voting the SP√ñ distanced itself from this proposal.  Bibliography  * Adolf Hahnl: Das Neutor (Schriftenreihe des Stadtvereins Salzburg. Kulturgut der Heimat.

They are led by head coach Kevin Donley, who serves in his 22nd year as the first and only head coach in the history of Saint Francis football. The Cougars play their home games at Bishop John M. D'Arcy Stadium as members of the Mid-States Football Association (MSFA) Mideast League (MEL). Schedule Game summaries =St. Francis (IL)= The Saint Francis Cougars traveled to Joliet, Illinois to take on the other St. Francis in a non-conference contest. After the Fighting Saints won the opening toss and deferred possession of the ball, the Cougars returned the opening kickoff to the Fighting Saints' 26-yard line. The first play from scrimmage resulted in a touchdown pass, the first of 7 TD passes thrown in the game by Cougar quarterbacks to 5 different receivers. The outcome was never in doubt as the Cougars built a lead of 56-0 before the Fighting Saints tallied the last touchdown of the game. For his 6 touchdown passes, Cougar starting quarterback Matt Crable was named the Mid-States Football Association's Mideast League Offensive Player of the Week. =Robert Morris= The Cougars traveled to the Chicago area for another non-conference MSFA cross-over game. This week's opponent was the Robert Morris Eagles. The weather was another force to be dealt with as it rained steadily and harshly for almost the entire game. The Eagles were the first to score, taking a 3-0 lead on a first quarter field goal. That lead was short-lived, however, as Saint Francis scored on their following possession. After a failed pass on first down, the Cougars' PJ Dean took a handoff and raced 78 yards down the sidelines for a touchdown. After the extra point was converted, the Cougars led 7-3. On the following kickoff, USF recovered an Eagles' fumble at the 18 yard line, and they scored 4 plays later on a 6-yard pass to Dan Ricksy. A failed extra point kick left USF leading 13-3. Still in the first quarter, Robert Morris ran 3 plays after they received the kick-off, and they punted the ball on 4th down. USF punt returner Matt Kominkiewicz caught the ball and returned it 83 yards for another USF touchdown, finishing the first quarter with a 20-3 lead. The TD punt return by Matt K. made him the first returner in the history of Saint Francis football to have returned both a kickoff and a punt for a touchdown. The return was also the longest TD return ever recorded by a USF player. The Cougars added 9 points in the second quarter to take a 29-3 lead into the half. The third quarter was scoreless, but Robert Morris made the end of the game exciting when they scored a touchdown, recovered an onside kick, scored another touchdown, and then recovered a second onside kick. But the USF defense stopped further efforts by the Eagles to advance the ball, and the game ended with the final score of 29-16. =St. Ambrose= It wasn't always pretty, but the #3-ranked Cougars walked away with a Homecoming Game victory over the St. Ambrose Fighting Bees. The final score was 31-13. The Cougars scored a pair of first quarter touchdowns, and they added a field goal in the second quarter to take a 17-0 lead into halftime. After receiving the opening kickoff, USF's opening drive was halted. The Cougars punted the ball, but the team got the ball back after three St. Ambrose plays failed to gain a first down. The Cougars returned the subsequent punt to the St. Ambrose 41-yard line. Three plays and a first down moved the ball to the 30-yard line, and the 4th play was a 30-yard scoring pass from Matt Crable to Matt Kominkiewicz. Later in the quarter, another USF drive started at the St. Ambrose 41-yard line. A 17-yard pass moved the ball to the 24-yard line. Two plays later, Crable handed the ball to Martel Williams who then dashed 24 yards to the end zone and another USF score. A second quarter field goal of 24 yards by Gavin Gardner completed the first half scoring. The Cougar offense continued to sputter after the half, being held scoreless in the third quarter. The Fighting Bees took the third quarter opening kickoff and marched 79 yards for the only score of the quarter. Some much-welcomed life was produced in the 4th quarter when Crable threw a pass to the sidelines that was caught by Casey Coll. Coll then sped 64 yards for a Cougar touchdown that extended the lead to 24-7. Later in the quarter, Crable completed another touchdown pass to Kominkiewicz, this one going for 28 yards to widen the lead to 31-7. The score remained that way for most of the rest of the quarter. With time expiring and the game coming to an end, the Fighting Bees scored a touchdown pass on the last play of the game. The point-after kick was no good, bringing the final score to 31-13. The Cougars offense hurt itself multiple times, losing the ball four times during the game. Benefiting from the two fumble recoveries and two interceptions, the Fighting Bees won the time of possession battle 31:56 to 28:04. Next week, unbeaten #3 USF travels to unbeaten #6 Marian University to begin conference play in a rival game that awards the Franciscan Bowl trophy to the victor. =Marian= For Saint Francis, the playoffs began this week. With 3 games in October against ranked teams, and a fourth game against a respected local rival, the month's game outcomes will have a big impact on the seeding USF receives if it gets invited to play in the post-season tournament. The game began well for Saint Francis. They kicked the ball to Marian, and the defense eventually forced a punt. The USF offense took over at that point. They drove the ball to midfield, but a fumble was recovered by Marian to halt the progress. Marian took over and proceeded to march downfield for a touchdown and a 7-0 lead. USF never recovered. They remained behind for the entire rest of the game, and they lost by a final score of 28-7. This was the first time in 35 games that Saint Francis had not led or been tied for the lead at some point in a game. In the second quarter, the Cougars tried a 4th down play. They failed to convert it into a first down, and the ball returned to Marian. The Marian drive produced a score for the first of three consecutive drives, with the middle one being scored on a 1-yard plunge by the Cougars' Martel Williams. After Marian answered with another touchdown of their own, the score was 21-7. Saint Francis kicked a field goal as time expired in the first half to cut the deficit to 21-10. The third quarter was scoreless as both team provided a strong defensive effort. USF controlled the ball for over 10 minutes of the quarter, but Marian's defense stiffened when key plays were attempted by the Cougars. The possession game then ended any hopes of a USF rally. The USF defense could not get the ball out of the hands of the Marian offense. USF completed a scoreless second half as Marian possessed the ball for over 13 minutes of the final 15-minute quarter. Marian scored the only points in the quarter, an insurance touchdown to bring the score to the final margin. =Concordia= For the first time since 2016, the Cougars entered a regular season game as the underdog. The #4 Concordia team beat the Cougars last season 7-3 on the Cardinals' home field, so the Cougars were also looking to avoid a second consecutive loss to the visiting team. USF set the early pace, scoring two first quarter touchdowns to take a 13-0 lead. The first score came on a one-yard run by Matt Crable, and the second occurred after USF's River Walsh blocked a punt that was then scooped up by Nick Lucas and returned for the score. That's the way the first quarter ended. USF scored first in the second quarter to extend their lead. The score came on a 5-yard pass completion from Crable to Dylan Hunley. Concordia took the following kickoff and returned the ball 42 yards. That good field position was leveraged by Concordia when they scored a 3-yard touchdown after a 27-yard pass completion. After a failed extra point try, the score was USF 20, Concordia 6. Each team added another touchdown before the halftime break to bring the halfway score USF 27, Concordia 13. The USF score came on a 4-yard touchdown pass from Crable to Zenden Dellinger to extend their lead to the largest of the game, a 21-point margin at 27-6. After a scoreless third quarter, things got interesting and rewarded those fans who stayed to watch the entire game. On a play when Crable's pass was intercepted, Crable himself was injured and had to leave the game. He did not return; the quarterback duties were taken over by backup Heath Simmons. Concordia was moving the ball at the end of the third quarter, and they completed a touchdown pass a mere four seconds into the final quarter. They converted the extra point to close within one score, now trailing 27-20. Concordia kicked the ball to the Cougars. After a fourth down try failed, the ball was turned over on downs to the Cardinals at the Concordia 38-yard line. Concordia then methodically completed a 62-yard march to the end zone. The extra point try was good, and the score was now tied, 27-27. On the following drive, USF was moving the ball, and it looked like it would result in a score and a return to the lead for the Cougars. But a Simmons' pass was intercepted at the Concordia goal line, and ball control returned to the Cardinals with 4:48 left in regulation. The Cardinals took advantage of the turnover. Starting at their own 20-yard line, Concordia moved downfield to the Saint Francis 22-yard line. With 17 seconds left on the clock, they set up for a 29-yard field goal that would put them in the lead for the first time in the ball game. But Concordia never got the lead. USF defender Matt Swartz blocked the kick, the Cougars' second blocked kick in the game. The ball was retrieved by USF's Jack Givens at the 35-yard line, and he raced 65 yards for the unexpected USF lead. A likely loss was turned into the ultimate victory with 7 seconds left on the clock. The time expired, and USF walked off the field with a 34-27 upset victory. =Indiana Wesleyan= =Siena Heights= =Lawrence Tech= =Taylor= =Lindsey Wilson= Ranking movements References Saint Francis Category:Saint Francis Cougars football seasons Saint Francis Cougars football ","title":"2019 Saint Francis Cougars football team"},{"id":"61500816","text":"The 1941‚Äì42 St. Francis Terriers men's basketball team represented St. Francis College during the 1941‚Äì42 NCAA men's basketball season.

The La Salle game was at Madison Square Garden and the Explorers were the favorites to win, but the Terriers won 50‚Äì34. Their first loss of the season came against N.Y.U. at Madison Square Garden. The Terriers riding a 9-game win streak were the favorites to win but they lost a close game 37‚Äì40. The Terriers were leading 23‚Äì14 at the half. Coming off their first loss of the season the Terriers defeated Saint Peter's, and set a record in the Metropolitan area for their 85‚Äì29 victory. The Terriers then beat Brooklyn College and Manhattan College and were in the running for a National Invitation Tournament spot. The Terriers then lost to CCNY and were out of the running. After the CCNY loss, the Terriers defeated Hofstra and upset St. John's to finish the season at 16‚Äì2. Brooklyn sports writers were of the opinion that St. Francis should still qualify for the NIT considering the 16-2 record.

Ingalls (1885‚Äì1940) was an American politician who served as mayor of Marlborough, Massachusetts from 1938 to 1940. Early life Ingalls was born in Marlborough in 1885. He graduated from Marlborough High School in 1902 and went on to work for the Rice & Hudson Shoe Company and the Frye-Corbin Box Manufacturing Company. He married Marion Searles, also of Marlborough, and they had one daughter. Political career Ingalls served on the Marlborough school committee from 1922 to 1938. In 1937 he challenged incumbent Mayor Charles Lyons. He easily defeated Lyons, who conceded after the votes of three of the city's seven wards were tabulated. During his first term as mayor, Ingalls dealt with a controversy surrounding copies of Apollo Belvedere and Venus de Milo that the school committee voted to remove from the high school auditorium because of their lack of clothing. The committee eventually decided to move the statues to a small room used for drawing. He also led the city during the 1938 New England hurricane. Due to power outages, Ingalls ordered that all stores close at dark. However, he requested that restaurants remain open to feed the members of the Massachusetts National Guard who were on patrol in the city. The city employed 1,000 men to clear debris and spent $10,000 to repair public buildings. In 1939, Ingalls defeated Lyons in a rematch to win a second term. On November 8, 1940, Ingalls and city solicitor John J. Ginnetti were indicted on bribery charges for allegedly selling two jobs in the Marlborough Fire Department. Their trial was scheduled to begin on December 5. However, on December 3, Ingalls left a suicide note for his wife stating \\"I will sleep at Fort Meadow tonight near the old causeway\\". He then drove to Fort Meadow Reservoir, walked out onto the ice, cut a hole with an ax, and plunged into the water. His body was found several hours later by the fire department. A private funeral was held at the Ingalls home on December 6. City Hall was draped in mourning, schools were closed, and factories did not run that day. He was buried in Maplewood Cemetery. On December 10, Ginnetti pled guilty and resigned from the bar. He was sentenced to six months in jail.

It is Hillary Clinton's eighth book with her publisher, Simon & Schuster. It was released on October 1, 2019, and includes portraits of \\"gutsy women\\" including Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Mary Ritter Beard, Harriet Tubman, Edith Windsor, and Malala Yousafzai. In many cases the authors describe how the subjects influenced their lives and in some cases how they met them. In explaining their motivation to write the book, the authors say, \\"If history shows one thing, it's that the world needs gutsy women. So in the moments when the long haul seems awfully long, we hope you will draw strength from these stories. We do.\\" Hillary Clinton added, \\"This book is a continuation of a conversation Chelsea and I have been having since she was a little girl, and we are excited to welcome others into that conversation.\\" The book received mixed-to-positive critical notices from those media outlets that reviewed it. It spent ten weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list. Background The first book co- authored by the mother and daughter, it has sections labeled as \\"Hillary\\", \\"Chelsea\\", and \\"Hillary and Chelsea\\" to clarify who wrote what. The former wrote in longhand while the latter sought to use collaborative software, making the writing process somewhat frustrating. The book was also written with the assistance of Lauren Peterson, a former speechwriter for the unsuccessful Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016. There are no footnotes or other indications in the book of where the research for the profiles comes from. Financial terms of the book were not disclosed when the project was announced in August 2019. Contents More than one hundred women are featured in the volume, selected from more than two hundred essays the pair wrote. Entries range from 17th-century nun and self-taught scholar Juana In√©s de la Cruz to contemporary teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, and include women who are little known to the general public. Some of the less familiar subjects include astronomer Caroline Herschel, doctor Mary Edwards Walker, pediatrician and professor Mona Hanna-Attisha, and women's rights advocate Manal al-Sharif. Some family members of the Clintons are also included as subjects. The cover image shows, as the authors state, a group of women firefighters in a training exercise at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard sometime after U.S. entry into World War II.

They also staged a book tour around the country, with some appearances being held under the title \\"An Evening and Conversation with Hillary Rodham Clinton and Chelsea Clinton\\". Sales were brisk in some locations, with tickets for an appearance at the Trinity United Methodist Church in Denver being gone within an hour. Additional attention came to Hillary Clinton during interviews for the book, as publication of it happened to coincide with the filing on an official impeachment inquiry against the man who had defeated her in the 2016 election. At a book tour appearance at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, which drew some 650 people, she said, \\"How appropriate that we would talk about a constitutional crisis such as the one we are in, right here at the Constitution Center.\\" She asked whether anyone in the president's party was willing to act like the pioneering U.S. senator Margaret Chase Smith, who was one of the profiles in the book. Reception The book received a positive notice from Viv Groskop, writing for the British newspaper i, who praised the \\"beautifully written stories of women's lives\\" and characterized it as \\"possibly a first: a cultural artefact inspired by a mother and a daughter which is neither cringeworthily sentimental nor frighteningly bitchy.\\" Groskop concluded by saying, \\"The whole thing feels like a restrained statement of rebellion and also a sort of consolation.\\" Feminist author Jo Freeman, writing for SeniorWomenWeb, said \\"This is a book that every young woman needs to read.\\" Nancy Gilson in The Columbus Dispatch wrote that \\"a sense of female camaraderie permeates the book. ... It is a pleasure to read about favorite female heroines and an even greater pleasure to discover new ones.\\" Others were more critical, like The Daily Telegraph's Madeline Grant, who criticized the book for failing to include Margaret Thatcher ‚Äì \\"the ultimate gutsy woman\\" in her words. Keziah Featherstone, writing for TES, said that for educators the book was \\"a great introduction for those dedicated to a diverse and representative curriculum ... the range included is undoubtedly terrific.\\" But she noted that the work \\"is framed as a long (long) conversation between mother and daughter\\" and said that was a detriment to readers who did not care that much about the Clintons. The Book of Gutsy Women sold almost 30,000 print copies in its first week of availability, good for second place in the Publishers Weekly ranking of adult nonfiction.

Early life Prime was born on December 10, 1801 at 54 Wall Street in New York City. He was the eldest son of Nathaniel Prime (1768‚Äì1840) and Cornelia (n√©e Sands) Prime (1773‚Äì1852), who married in 1797. Among his sisters was Cornelia Prime (wife of Robert Ray, a brother-in-law of New York Gov. John Alsop King), Emily Prime (wife of U.S. Navy Capt. William Seton and son of Elizabeth Ann Seton), Matilda Prime (wife of Gerard Holsman Coster), and Laura Prime (wife of John Clarkson Jay, a son of Peter A. Jay and grandson of John Jay). His maternal grandparents were Comfort Sands, the merchant, banker and Continental Congressman, and Elizabeth (n√©e Cornell) Sands. His paternal grandparents were Joshua Prime and Bridget (n√©e Hammond) Prime. Prime was educated at McCulluck's boarding school in Morristown, New Jersey where his father and other family members were educated. Career Five years before his birth, his father organized \\"Nathaniel Prime, Stock and Commission Broker\\" which made money buying and selling bank stocks before he opened his own private bank where he allowed customers to deposit money and then loaned it out. In 1808, his father brought Samuel Ward III in as a partner and the firm was renamed Prime & Ward, followed by his uncle Joseph Sands in 1816 when the firm became Prime, Ward & Sands. In 1824, the firm was again reorganized as Prime, Ward, Sands & King when James Gore King became a partner upon his return from England. After Sand's death in 1826, the firm became Prime, Ward & King. In 1826, still a young man, Prime entered the firm and was made a partner of Prime, Ward & Co. upon his father's retirement in 1832. His father, in ill health, committed suicide on November 26, 1840, by cutting his throat. The firm collapsed in 1847, and Prime established the firm of Prime & Co., which consisted of him and his four sons, where he worked until his retirement in 1867, at which point his sons also retired. =Philanthropy= Prime was one of the founders of the New York Eye and Ear Dispensary. He was also a vestryman in St. Philip's Church in Manhattan and a warden of Christ Church in Riverdale. Personal life On September 18, 1827, he was married to Anne Bard (1804‚Äì1834). Anne was the daughter of William Bard, a lawyer who founded the New York Life Insurance and Trust Company. Anne's younger sister, Susan Bard, was the wife of Edward's first cousin, Ferdinand Sands, both being grandsons of Comfort Sands. Before his first wife's death in 1834, they were the parents of four children: * Cornelia Prime (1829‚Äì1869), who married German-born August Ahrens (1818‚Äì1869) in 1850. * Nathaniel Prime (1830‚Äì1885), a Brevet Lieutenant Colonel who died unmarried. * William Bard Prime (1832‚Äì1836), who died in infancy. * Edward Prime (b. 1833), who married Annie Rhodes Gilbert (1856‚Äì1941), the widow of his younger half-brother in 1889. After the death of his first wife in New York City on October 27, 1834, he married Charlotte Wilkins Hoffman (1808‚Äì1892) in 1836. * William Hoffman Prime (1837‚Äì1881), who married Anne Rhodes Gilbert in 1879. *Charlotte Prime (1838-1923), who married Leonard J.

History  Silicon power transistor SDT9402, showing the \\"Œ≤\\" logo of I.P.R.S. In 1960 the government of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej decided to build an electronics plant in the forest of BƒÉneasa which in 1962 was named Baneasa Radio and Semiconductor Parts Company ( or I.P.R.S.). The production of integrated circuits started in 1970 with technology from Thomson-CSF. The plant developed steadily and grew to 6000 employees by the early 1980s. By 1990 the product range included bipolar digital and linear integrated circuits (including 7400 series integrated circuits), silicon transistors and diodes, microwave devices, thyristors, triacs, and capacitors. I.P.R.S. manufactured with the designation Œ≤P14500 a clone of the 1-bit-microprocessor Motorola MC14500B in I2L technology. In 1969 the Research Center for the Design of Electronic Components ( or CCPCE) was established on the grounds of I.P.R.S. but independent from it. The research center developed semiconductor products from initial experiments to pilot production, at which point the mass manufacturing was handed over to I.P.R.S. By 1974 the center moved to a new headquarter adjacent to I.P.R.S. and changed its name to Research Institute for Electronic Components ( or ICCE). With new production facilities opened in 1979 the institute started to manufacture transistors, diodes, integrated circuits, optoelectronics, and microwave devices for end customers, in particular products that were needed only in small quantities (a few thousand per month) and could therefore not be manufactured economically at I.P.R.S. Microprocessor MMN80CPU, showing the \\"ME\\" logo of Microelectronica A third entity, Microelectronica was set up in 1981 close to I.P.R.S. and ICCE with the goal of manufacturing PMOS, NMOS, and CMOS integrated circuits (including 4000-series integrated circuits) as well as optoelectronics, complementing the production profile of I.P.R.S. Microelectronica manufactured a clone of the Intel 8080 with the designation MMN8080 and a clone of the Zilog Z80 with the designation MMN80CPU. The MMN80CPU entered production in 1988. For comparison, the original Z80 was launched in 1976 and the East German clone U880 in 1980. = After 1990 = I.P.R.S. remained in government hands until 2003. After a factory upgrade in 1992 a steady decline set in. The number of employees dropped to 5000 in 1991 and 2000 at the end of the 1990s. Amid allegations of corruption the plant was sold in 2003 to Syrian businessman Omar Hayssam (who was in 2013 sentenced to a 20-year prison term for organizing the kidnapping of three Romanian journalists in Baghdad). By 2008, I.P.R.S. was declared bankrupt. The equipment had been stolen or sold for scrap at that point. ICCE was first split into four sections but largely re-united in 1996 as the Institute for Microtechnology ( or IMT). While IMT still exists in 2020, it has lost its own commercial manufacturing capabilities as well as its industry partners I.P.R.S. and Microelectronica. Microelectronica ceased commercial operation in 1997 and many of its specialists transferred to IMT. As of 2020, Microelectronica still exists as a \\"technology showcase\\", albeit without any products and few employees.  Semiconductor designation  Unlike the Soviet integrated circuit designation or the East German semiconductor designation, the Romanian government did not set standards for the labelling of semiconductors. Devices licensed from Western manufacturers were often named according to the Pro Electron standard. Microelectronica assigned integrated circuit designations according to the underlying technology: MMP for PMOS (e.g. MMP106), MMN for NMOS (e.g. MMN8080), and MMC for CMOS (e.g. MMC4001).

Proton is developed by Valve and based on a fork of Wine. It includes several patches and libraries to improve performance and compatibility with Windows games. Proton is designed for integration into the Steam client as \\"Steam Play\\".  Overview  Proton was initially released on 21 August 2018. Upon release, Valve announced a whitelist of 27 games that were tested and certified to perform like their native Windows counterparts without requiring end-user tweaking. These include Doom (2016), Quake, and Final Fantasy VI. Proton incorporates several libraries that improve 3D performance. These include Direct3D-to-Vulkan translation layers, namely D9VK for Direct3D 9, DXVK for Direct3D 10 and 11, and VKD3D for Direct3D 12. As of December 2019, D9VK has been merged into DXVK, which it was originally forked from.  Compatibility  Being a fork of Wine, Proton maintains very similar compatibility with Windows applications as its upstream counterpart. In addition to the official whitelist, a large portion of the Windows catalog is reportedly compatible, albeit unofficially, with Proton. The user can optionally force use of Proton for a specific title, even if a Linux version already exists. = ProtonDB = ProtonDB is an unofficial community website that collects and displays crowdsourced data describing the compatibility of a given title with Proton, on a rating scale from \\"Borked\\" to \\"Platinum\\". The site is inspired by the WineHQ AppDB, which also collects and displays crowdsourced compatibility reports and uses a similar rating system.  Release history  Valve has released five major versions of Proton. The versioning scheme refers to the upstream Wine version it's based on, with an appended patch number. Proton generally lags behind its upstream Wine base by several releases. Unofficial forks, such as Proton GE, have been created to re-base Proton on recent Wine versions, which may improve compatibility with games over the official release, and sometimes hurt it.

In 1958, after the Vaynakh people returned and the Chechen- Ingush ASSR was restored, the village regained its old Chechen name, Verkhatoy.  Population  * 2002 Census: 465 * 2010 Census: 971 * 2019 estimate: ? According to the 2010 Census, the majority of residents of Verkhatoy were ethnic Chechens.

He was defeated by Constantinianus at the Battle of Scardon. Uligisalus retreated to the city of Burnum, where he waited for Asinarius. The army, however, failed and this loss marked the end of the Goth's domination over the region while Savia fell to the Lombards and Noricum to the Franks. Dalmatia, on the other hand, became a Byzantine stronghold, serving as a staging ground for its campaigns in Italy. Uligisalus was later employed as the commander of the 400 men garrison of Tudera.

He is the grandson of Karaikudi Subbarama Iyer and adoptive son of Karaikudi Sambasiva Iyer. Karaikudi Subramanian has been designated the title \\"Top-Grade artist\\" by All India Radio and has performed numerous radio concerts as well as live concerts at various venues around the world. He has performed with fellow veena player Ranganayaki Rajagopalan and his sister Rajeswari Padmanabhan, both disciples of Karaikudi Sambasiva Iyer. He has also accompanied artists such as flutist T. Viswanathan and vocalist K. V. Narayanaswamy. Furthermore, he has engaged in cross cultural performances with prominent musicians of other genres such as the Irish fiddler Martin Hayes and the Finnish composer Eero H√§meenniemi. Subramanian later turned his focus to education, exploring ways to make music accessible to everyone regardless of their background. In 1989, he founded the institute 'Brhaddhvani ‚Äì Research and Training Centre for Musics of the World' in Chennai. A few years later, as a result of his vigorous training with Karaikudi Sambasiva Iyer and his own research at Wesleyan University and later at Brhaddhvani, he developed a pedagogic system of music learning called 'Correlated Objective Music Education and Training' (COMET).

Through the ritualistic devasam (also called ≈örƒÅddha), it is known that before the first recorded members of the Karaikudi family, the lineage goes back two generations further. However, there is only an oral record of the first two generations without any knowledge of names or details. Malayappa belonged to the third generation and Venkateswara to the fourth. Other than their names, not much is known about these two generations either. Subbaraya ‚Äì the grandfather of the Karaikudi Brothers ‚Äì belonged to the fifth generation. He was the court musician in Sivaganga and later in Thirugokarnam, Pudukkottai. Subbaraya's son Subbaya was born in Thirugokarnam. Like his father, Subbayya was also patronised by the court of Pudukkottai under rule of Ramachandra Tondaiman. The Kanakabhisekam (gold shower) was bestowed on Subbaraya and Subbayya by the royalty of Pudukottai court to honor their musicianship. Subbayya married Subbammal and had two children Subbarama Iyer (1883‚Äì1938) and Sambasiva Iyer (1888‚Äì1957). Subbarama Iyer began learning veena from his father at the age of seven and began playing concerts at the age of 12. He was later joined by his younger brother Sambasiva Iyer. Subbarama Iyer was known for his unique way of holding the veena vertically (urdhva posture) while playing. With the expansion and increasing control of the British empire during the first half of the 20th century, the royal courts in the small states of India could no longer afford to patronise arts. The political changes affected artists all over India due to the absence of royal patronage. Leaving Thirugokarnam was inevitable for Subbarama Iyer and Sambasiva Iyer who were now left to fend for themselves. After moving to Madurai, where they continued to struggle financially, they moved to Karaikudi. The Nattukkottai Chettiyars (merchant community) in Karaikudi were interested in bringing them to their village and offered the brothers accommodation. Subbarama Iyer and Sambasiva Iyer gradually established themselves with the support and patronage of other interested merchants and soon became known as the famous \\"Karaikudi Veena Brothers\\". They were mostly accompanied by Dakshinamurthy Pillai, the legendary mridangam player, who became their closest friend and was often referred to as \\"the third veena\\".  Early life and education  Karaikudi Sambasiva Iyer adopting Subramanian in 1957 to pass on the family legacy Karaikudi S. Subramanian was born on 23 October 1944, in Madurai, Tamil Nadu to Narayanan Iyer and Lakshmi Ammal ‚Äì the daughter of Subbarama Iyer. His exposure to music began from his early childhood from his mother. Lakshmi Ammal was an 8th generation veena player and taught veena throughout her life. In 1957, Subramanian was adopted by Lakshmi Ammal's paternal uncle Karaikudi Sambasiva Iyer ‚Äì the younger of the Karaikudi brothers. Sambasiva Iyer had no children of his own, and, to pass on the family legacy through a male member of the family, Subramanian became the adopted son of Sambasiva Iyer. After the adoption, Subramanian moved to Chennai and lived at the original Kalakshetra, Theosophical Society with Sambasiva Iyer, who worked as a principal there. He was undergoing vigorous training in the foundations of Carnatic music for one year until the death of his adoptive father in 1958. The students and faculty of Kalakshetra (1957). Second row: Rukmini Arundale in the middle, Sankara Menon (to her left), Mysore Vasudevachar and Karaikudi Sambasiva Iyer (to her right). Karaikudi Subramanian is sitting to the far right in the first row At Kalakshetra, Subramanian had the opportunity to closely observe notable musicians and dancers, such as composer Mysore Vasudevachar, composer and vocalist M. D. Ramanathan and dancer Rukmini Devi Arundale. Subramanian then returned to Madurai to pursue his academic studies. He completed his B.Sc in Chemistry at Madura College, Madras University and afterwards pursued a M.A in English literature at Madura College, Madras University. In 1975, he moved to the U.S. for doctoral studies in Ethnomusicology at Wesleyan University.  Career  From 1965 to 1967 Subramanian worked as a demonstrator in Chemistry at Madura College. He then returned to Chennai to work as an English lecturer at Vivekananda College from 1970 to 1975. After completing his M.A. in Ethnomusicology at Wesleyan University, he moved back to Chennai for a short period and worked as an assistant professor of Music at SSSS College of Music, Madurai. Before commencing his doctoral studies at Wesleyan University, he worked at the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society. After completing his doctoral studies in 1986, he worked at University of Madras from 1986 to 2002, first as reader and later as Professor of Music. In 1989, Subramanian and Dr. S. Seetha ‚Äì the former head of the department of Music at University of Madras, founded Brhaddhvani ‚Äì Research and Training Centre for Musics of the World. Subramanian has made academic visits to numerous universities around the world. He has had visiting positions at Amherst College (Valentine Professor of Music), Leeds College of Music, York University, University of Michigan, University of Limerick, University College Cork. In 1975, Subramanian, along with his sister Rajeswari Padmanabhan, were invited by Museum f√ºr V√∂lkerkunde Berlin-Dahlem (now Ethnologisches Museum) to document their family tradition going back 9 generations. They recorded the album Musik F√ºr Vƒ´·πáƒÅ ‚Äì S√ºdindien. They were accompanied by Tanjore Upendran on the mridangam. The album won the German Record Critics' Award (Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik) in 1980.  COMET  Inspired by his training with Sambasiva Iyer and his research at Wesleyan University and Brhaddhvani, Subramanian developed the pedagogy COMET (Correlated Objective Music Education and Training). COMET is a holistic system of learning music with the purpose of providing a fuller understanding of music. COMET seeks to preserve the traditional content of Carnatic music, while being contemporary and global in its reach. As an open and inclusive system, COMET seeks to enable anyone to progress regardless of their musical skills and background. Furthermore, COMET explores cross-cultural musical interactions for a better understanding of one's own tradition through comparison and contrast. Numerous western musicians of various genres have undergone training in COMET. COMET is also applicable for cross-disciplinary interactions, and artists from disciplines such as south Indian classical dance, theatre and poetry have received training in COMET.  Brhaddhvani  Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer at the inauguration of Brhaddhvani Subramanian and Dr. S. Seetha founded the research institute 'Brhaddhvani ‚Äì Research and Training Centre for Musics of the World' in 1989 with the main purpose of making music and music education accessible to everyone regardless of their background. Brhaddhvani has been considered an alternative to the traditional gurukula way of learning. Subramanian's work is aimed towards bridging the gap between tradition and modernity, global and local, and thus finding meaning for tradition in a modern world. He has developed novel techniques intended to make the music learning process effective and holistic. To facilitate and accelerate the quality music education, Subramanian's teaching is greatly supported by technology and technological aids, mainly the app Tala Keeper and the online learning platform Patantara. Dr. Subramanian's contributions in music are multi- dimensional, and his work has been considered pioneering by many. Through Brhaddhvani, he has developed programs that benefit learners ranging from novice to expert. Brhaddhvani offers music training for different levels of knowledge and purposes, and musicians and other artists from various backgrounds, students as well as performing artists, have received training in COMET at Brhaddhvani. Brhaddhvani has received grants from the Ford Foundation, Impact Partners, India Foundation for Arts & the Government of India. = Learning from the Maestros = Lalgudi Jayaraman teaching at Brhaddhvani Prominent Carnatic musicians have been associated with Brhaddhvani, among these are Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, Sripada Pinakapani, T. M. Thyagarajan, K. V. Narayanaswamy, Lalgudi G. Jayaraman, T. Viswanathan, S. Kalyanaraman, Trichy Sankaran, S. R. Janakiraman, S. Rajam. In the early nineties Brhaddhvani brought the Carnatic maestros to teach the students and teachers of the institute. Each one brought an approach to communicating the intricacies of Carnatic music. In 1993, Brhaddhvani organized a voice culture seminar with musicians such as Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, Lalgudi G. Jayaraman, K. V. Narayanaswamy, Sandhyavandanam Srinivasa Rao, T.K. Govinda Rao and S. Kalyanaraman. This was the first time that Carnatic musicians of this stature interacted with one another to discuss voice culture. In 2003, Brhaddhvani celebrated Lalgudi Year in honour of the violinist Lalgudi G. Jayaraman. Students learned the repertoire of Lalgudi directly from the Lalgudi G. Jayaraman himself. Furthermore, a number of concerts and events were organised by Brhaddhvani to honor the violinist. = Reviving traditions = Veena and veena crafting Karaikudi Subramanian accompanying K.V. Narayanaswamy Throughout his career, Subramanian has worked towards preserving the veena and its crafting. Brhaddhvani has organised a number of events for the revival and documentation of the veena tradition, including festivals of veena as a solo instrument and festivals of veena as an accompanying instrument as a revival of an older tradition. Patronisation of veena crafting has become greatly reduced throughout the last half a century, and veena craftsmen suffer on account of lack of patronage. This is intensified by the increasing popularity of the electronic veenas. At Brhaddhvani, veena craftsmen have been patronised since the early 90s. Subramanian has initiated projects to support and preserve the art of veena crafting and veena craftsmen. He has collaborated with the German instrument maker Norbert Beyer to bring about an elaborate illustrative book in German on veena craftsmanship. Sopanam ‚Äì Temple music of Kerala With the support from India Foundation for the Arts, Brhaddhvani in collaboration with Dharani ‚Äì a school of performing arts in Kochi ‚Äì documented the temple music of Kerala called Sopanam. The Sopanam tradition is older longer than Carnatic music but the former is now almost extinct. It is only performed in a few temples and as an accompaniment to the Indian classical dance form Kathakali. The focus of the project was on identification, documentation and notation of the ragas and talas in Sopanam music and hereby make it more accessible to people, in particular musicians and dancers. Apart from the audio and video documentations of the music, the music was documented through notations. For the notation of the music, Subramanian made use of his own notational system svarasthana notation. As a result of the project, Sopanam music has become more accessible than it would have been otherwise. The music tradition is now documented on 5 DV tapes, 75 audio tapes, 5 mini discs and 1 VHS tape and over 100 slides and almost 500 photographs. = Music for therapeutic purposes = Subramanian teaching music to the Chennai Corporation School Children who were affected by the Tsunami disaster in 2004. Music as therapy at Brhaddhvani is a natural evolution and has been practiced since the 90s. The fundamental elements in COMET in building the tonal and rhythmic aspects in the ‚Äòmind and body‚Äô brought an insight into music therapy as a discipline leading to original therapeutic music practices at Brhaddhvani. The three-note practice with Vedic chants is being practiced at Brhaddhvani as mediation to anchor the tones in the body. Furthermore, Brhaddhvani has conducted classes in music and yoga as another element in connecting ‚Äòmind and body‚Äô. Subramanian's experiments show that the exercises of COMET have therapeutic benefits.

Long time before then, Subramanian has formed the concept Isai Vazhi Kalvi (\\"education through music\\") as part of Brhaddhvani's outreach activities with the purpose of imparting primary education through music to make Carnatic music accessible to all. The programme Isai Vazhi Kalvi made use of audio-visual presentations which proved to be beneficial for the children by visualising what they were taught. Apart from receiving COMET training from the Brhaddhvani team for three months, Thirupathi was also guided by Subramanian on how to bring music to the village children. The students learned the basic exercises of Carnatic music, basic arithmetic through rhythms, Folk music and aphorisms from Thirukkural and Aathichoodi through which they also learned correct pronunciation and tonal modulations. The programme resulted in enhanced memory, comprehension and concentration skills of the children. Students with mental disabilities participated in the classes which turned out to improve their communication skills.
