An alumnus of the Bauhaus, Schawinsky belonged to the circle around Bauhaus founder and architect Walter Gropius. Early life Shawinsky was born March 25, 1904 in Basel, the second child of Benjamin Schawinsky and Regina Bielawska, both of Polish-Jewish descent. Schawinsky attended school in Basel from 1910 to 1914, and then high school in Zurich from 1915 to 1921. He apprenticed at the architecture office of Theodor Merill in Cologne until 1923. After visiting the Berlin School of Applied Arts for a short time in 1923, Schawinsky enrolled in the Bauhaus in Weimar in 1924. Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, Adolf Meyer and L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy were among his teachers. In the stage department led by Oskar Schlemmer Schawinsky developed skits and pantomimes, and created his first stage work. After Bauhaus With the closure of the Weimar Bauhaus in 1925, Schawinsky moved to Bauhaus Dessau, focusing on experimental photography. At the Bauhaus he played saxophone in the student band. From 1926 to 1927 he designed stage sets in Zwickau, and taught as an assistant to Schlemmer in stage design at Bauhaus. Schawinsky also began to devote himself to painting. In 1927 he exhibited at Deutsche Theaterausstellung in Magdeburg. Schawinsky was close friends with Herbert Bayer and Marcel Breuer and was godfather of Julia Bayer, the 1929-born daughter of Herbert and Irene Bayer. In 1929 Schawinsky went to Magdeburg, hired by Johannes G√∂deritz to head the graphic department of the municipal building authority. During this time he became picture editor of the theatre newspaper Das Stichwort. Due to political and Antisemitic hostility, Schawinsky left Magdeburg at the end of 1931 and moved to Berlin as a freelance artist. With the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party, Schawinsky emigrated to Italy, where he resumed painting in Rapallo. Working at Olivetti he co-designed a new semi-professional typewriter, the Olivetti Studio 42. Schawinsky also consulted for architects Fingini & Pollini on the design, who at the time built the new headquarters for Olivetti. Move to the US Schawinsky was invited to Black Mountain College in the US in 1936 by Josef Albers and the Museum of Modern Art in New York exhibited his work. Schawinsky designed the North Carolina Pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair and, with Breuer and Gropius, the Pennsylvania Pavilion. In 1941 he moved to New York, teaching at the City College of New York from 1943 to 1946 and at New York University from 1950 to 1954. From 1961 Schawinsky travelled for longer periods to Europe, building a second home in Oggebbio on Lake Maggiore and also exhibited in Germany. In 1971, the Museum of Modern Art presented a film about Schawinsky and his work in New York. In 1981, Hans Heinz Holz published a monograph. In 1936, Schawinsky married Irene von Debschitz (1903-1990), the daughter of Wanda von Debschitz-Kunowski, and their son Ben was born in 1939. In 1963 he married Gisela Hatzky, and their son Daniel was born in 1973. Schawinsky died on September 11, 1979 in Locarno, Switzerland.

It is anchored by JCPenney. History The land Shenango Valley Mall sits on is owned by the McConnell family. JCPenney opened at the mall in January 1969, after being previously located in Sharon, Pennsylvania. Shenango Valley Mall was renovated in 1997, costing $3.5 million. It was the malls first major renovation since opening in the 1960s and Kaufmann's also expanded its store. Crown American Realty Trust, the mall's owner, was sold to PREIT in 2003. The mall was then sold by PREIT, along with five others to The Lightstone Group in 2004. Kaufmann's was re-branded as Macy's in August 2006. Shenango Valley Mall and three other malls entered receivership in January 2009, with Jones Lang LaSalle taking over management. Jones Lang LaSalle offered the mall, along with three others, for sale in May 2009. An attempted sale with two other malls failed in 2010. Shenango Valley Mall made national news due to the closure of both its Macy's and Sears in March 2017. Sears Auto Center was not part of the closure. Firestone and Sears Auto Center were both damaged in the same month by a storm. In 2017, Hermitage City and School District challenged the mall's tax reassessment that significantly reduced its value due to the loss of two anchors. JSMN Shenango Valley Mall defaulted on the mall's $3.430 million loan in February 2018, with courts assigning Metro Commercial as the malls operator. The malls lender, Iowa Square Realty LLC, won it at sheriff's sale for $50,000 in July 2018. Sears Auto Center closed in October 2018. Court hearings occurred in December 2018 over Iowa Square Realty's ownership of the mall due to issues with maintenance, unpaid rent, and taxes. The mall in December was $243,000 in debt due to unpaid rent and taxes. Ownership of the mall was given to GFM 23 (McConnell family) by the court in January 2019 due to Iowa Square Realty not paying a court ordered $25,000 bond. Issues in early 2019 include the parking lot and a leaky roof. The mall's tax assessment issues were resolved in June 2019.  Future  On August 1, 2019, LRC Realty of Akron, Ohio announced that they will acquire the mall. The company is looking to create a \\"first-class shopping facility\\" with \\"best in-class restaurants and retailers\\". The company plans on creating an open-air design with public places that will be attractive to the area. The president of LRC Realty says the community should expect a project similar to The Block Northway on McKnight Road in Ross Township, Pennsylvania, which was a former mall turned into a lifestyle center by LRC. The company also designed the nearby Hermitage Plaza. Specific dates or plans have yet to be announced.

Orebaugh (March 19, 1910 ‚Äì June 12, 2001) was an American Foreign Service Officer, intelligence officer and university director. For the Foreign Service he served posts in Wellington, Trieste, Venice, Nice, Monte Carlo, Florence and Bridgetown. For his service in France and Italy during World War II, Orebaugh was awarded the Medal of Freedom. Orebaugh is a native of Wichita, Kansas and is a graduate of University of Wichita. Service during World War II In November, 1942, Orebaugh was consul at the American Consulate in Nice, Vichy France. At the order of American Charg√© d‚ÄôAffaires Pinkney Tuck, he quickly set up a consulate in Monaco. The reason for setting up a diplomatic mission in Monaco came to light a few days later with the Allied invasion of French North Africa and the quick closing of US diplomatic missions in Vichy France. The US had hoped to have a listening station in independent Monaco for which the consulate would serve. However, shortly after Orenbaugh set up the consulate Monaco was occupied by Italian forces and he and his small staff were taken into Italian custody. He was then shipped to Italy where he was to be eventually traded for Allied prisoners. But after the Armistice of Cassibile and the subsequent German occupation of northern Italy and the disarming of non-Fascist Italian forces he found himself in the hostile Italian Social Republic with risk of becoming a German prisoner as the German army was approaching his detainment location in Perugia. He elected to escape with the help of a local Italian family who hid him in their house. As he was trapped in Italy he decided to assist the Italian resistance movement and became a leader in a resistance group called the San Faustino Partisan band. He participated in many actions in the mountains of central Italy and sometimes leading daring raids on German and Italian Fascist supply and ammunition depots. He and another Italian partisan escaped to a hideout with other Allied personnel and he eventually sailed in a boat with some British and Americans to Allied lines on May 10, 1944. To the Allies he was able to give detailed intelligence of Italian resistance and German forces and helped facilitate supply lines to the resistance groups behind Axis lines. After briefly returning to the United States, he returned to Italy before the war's end and served as consul in Florence. Orebaugh wrote a book about his service during the war entitled Guerilla in Striped Pants: A U.S. Diplomat Joins the Italian Resistance.

The Gai-As Formation represents the second-oldest sedimentary unit of the Huab Basin, overlying the Huab Formation. The formation was deposited in a fluvial to lacustrine setting. The Gai-As Formation is correlated with a series of formations in the Pelotas and Paran√° Basins in southeastern Brazil, deposited in a larger basinal area, 150 million years before the break-up of Pangea. The abundance of Glossopteris and Mesosaurus fossils in the underlying Huab Formation are characteristic of the Gondwanan correlation across present-day South America, Africa, Antarctica and Australia. The Gai-As Formation has provided fossil bivalves and an indeterminate stereospondylid.  Description  The Gai-As Formation is named after the ruins of a colonial German police station located at a spring in the central Huab area.Wanke, 2000, p.11 The formation is a lithological unit with an approximate maximum thickness of , deposited in the Huab Basin where it overlies the Huab Formation, separated by a significant hiatus,Wanke, 2000, p.25 and is unconformably overlain by the Etjo Sandstone,Horsthemke et al, 1990, p.68 while later authors assign a separate formation to the upper of the Gai-As Formation, named Doros Formation. The formation comprises sandstones, siltstones and mudstones deposited in a lacustrine environment. U/Pb SHRIMP dating of zircons from two of several fallout tuff beds in the Gai-As Formation above the stereospondyl find gave weighted mean values of 272 ¬± 1.8 Ma and 265 ¬± 2.5 Ma. The Gai-As Formation is the most widespread depositional unit within the Huab Basin. The approximately thick succession is easily distinguished from all the other units by its characteristic reddish to violet color. The Gai-As Formation gradationally overlies the lacustrine deposits of the Huab Formation in the western part of the basin, but in the east succeeds the fluvial deposits of the Huab Formation with a sharp contact. The basal beds of the formation are ubiquitously represented by fine-grained distal deposits and imply a much larger extent of the formation due to the absence of sediments from marginal environments.Horsthemke et al, 1990, p.73 The lower part of the succession is formed by approximately of thick reddish-violet, slightly calcareous shales. In the lower half of this mainly pelitic succession, intercalations of dark brown, very often concretionary calcareous layers up to thick, occur. These layers contain siltstone beds which locally exhibit flaser bedding, oscillation ripples and hummocky cross-bedding. The calcareous layers also contain small fossiliferous lenses with fishbones. The upper half of the basal shaly section contains a few layers, thick, which are whitish and analcime-rich and occasionally thin layers of green chert. The basal beds grade into a thick succession of silty to fine-grained, and eventually medium- to coarse grained, sandstone. Sections of the uppermost part show various types of intercalations: silt- and sandstone layers grade laterally into sequences of interbedded shale and sandstone with occasional intercalations of stromatolitic layers, carbonate horizons with molluscs, bone beds of fish scales and white layers rich in authigenic feldspar. The shale frequently exhibits desiccation cracks, whereas root marks are abundant in sandstone. Halite crystal moulds have been found locally. The white tuff layers within the Gai-As Formation contain very well-preserved former glass shards, now mainly replaced by barite, are rich in potassium feldspar and have a porcelain-like appearance.Werner, 2006, p.14 = Depositional environment = The Gai-As Formation as a whole displays an upward coarsening sequence which starts with distal shallow lacustrine shales. The occurrence of flaser bedding, oscillation ripples and hummocky cross-stratification in silty intercalations indicates that the sediment, surface must have been above the storm wave base. The remarkably high content of analcime (30 volume percent) in some layers may be indicative of contemporaneous volcanic activity. Early diagenetic formation of analcime from volcanic glass in an alkaline environment has been described. High alkalinity of the lake water may also have been the reason for the almost complete lack of fossils in this part of the section. The overlying succession of sandstones, siltstones, stromatolites and emerged horizons reflects the upward shallowing of the formation. Besides extensive sand flats, large playas, several square kilometres in size, must have existed during the final stages of deposition. The playa deposits are represented by shaly sediments with intercalated feldspar-rich layers (), stromatolite horizons () and fish scale bone beds (). Fossiliferous stratiform carbonates ( thick) with molluscs of the Terraia altissima type are transitional to the sand-flat facies which is characterised by sandy, flat and lenticular deposits and occasionally contain abundant root marks. The lowermost part of the formation indicates a fluvio-lacustrine environment.Holzf√∂rster et al, 2000, p.286 = Fossil content = Reconstruction of a stereospondylid The following fossils have been reported from the formation:Huab Basin amphibian locality at Fossilworks.orgKlein Gai- As, lower Gai-As Formation, Huab Basin at Fossilworks.orgKlein Gai-As, upper Gai-As Formation, Huab Basin at Fossilworks.org ;Amphibians * Stereospondyli indet. ;Bivalves * Cowperesia emerita * Huabiella compressa * Terraia cf. altissima, T. cf. curvata = Correlations = The lower part of the formation is correlated with the Serra Alta Formation and the upper part with the Teresina Formation of the Paran√° and Pelotas Basins in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.Horsthemke et al, 1990, p.74 Due to increased subsidence in the central Paran√° Basin, thicknesses of the correlative units are considerably greater than that of the Gai-As Formation, attaining a maximum of .Horsthemke et al, 1990, p.75 In the Karoo Basin of southern Namibia and the Eastern, Northern and Western Cape, South Africa, the formation is time-equivalent with the Collingham, Ripon and Fort Brown Formations.

She served as General Secretary of the Young Woman's Branch of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). Early years and education Frances Julia Allis was born in Skaneateles, Onondaga County, New York, April 14, 1846. Her parents and ancestors were members of the orthodox society of Friends, of which she was a member. She was a friend of Frances E. Willard and Anna Adams Gordon. She received her early education in the schools of her native village and was finally graduated at the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn, New York. After her graduation, her family resided in Brooklyn, during which time she became interested in church and Sunday-school and mission work. Career On September 21, 1871, she married Willis A. Barnes, a lawyer of New York City, and made her home for a time in that location. In the fall of 1875, professional business called Mr. Barnes to Chicago, Illinois. Mrs. Barnes accompanied him, and they remained there five years. Barnes' Quaker training taught her the value of woman's voice and opinion and had prepared her, when the Women's Crusade came, to step into the temperance ranks and \\"lend her influence\\" to that cause. Her first public work, however, commenced a few years later when she was living in Chicago. There she became associated with Frances E. Willard in conducting gospel temperance meetings in lower Harwell Hall and meetings in church parlors in the Newsboy's Home, and in visiting jails, hospitals, printing offices and other places. It was while the temperance movement was confined to the object of \\"rescuing the perishing\\" the attention of Barnes and her co-workers was drawn to the necessity of not merely seeking to reform the fallen, but also of directing efforts to implant principles of total abstinence among young men and women, and enlisting their cooperation while they were yet young. In 1878, in the national convention held in Baltimore, Barnes was made a member of the committee on young women's work, and in the next convention, held in Indianapolis, in 1879, she made a verbal report, and was at that time made chairman of the committee for the following year, and at its expiration, made the first report on young women's work, which appeared in the National Minutes. In 1879 and 1880, twenty Young WCTUs were organised in the State of New York, and of the twenty-five unions in Illinois, with a membership of 700, two-thirds had been formed during the year. In 1880, young women's work was made a department of the National WCTU, and Barnes was appointed General Secretary. In 1890, she was appointed fraternal delegate to the annual meeting of the British Women's Temperance Association (BWTA), held in London, 21 and 22 May, at which time she so acceptably-presented the subject that the department of young women's work was immediately organized, and Lady Henry Somerset accepted the superintendency. As an outgrowth of that interest, sixteen branches were organised in Great Britain the first year. In 1891, Barnes was made the superintendent for the World's Young WCTU work. Under her care, it so grew that there was a membership of 30,000 in the United Suites alone. The members distributed literature, formed hygienic and physical culture clubs, had courses of reading, flower missions, loan-libraries, jail visiting, Sunday-school work, in all covering forty different departments of philanthropic and religious labor. During the year, she traveled extensively through the country, delivering addresses at public and parlor meetings and organizing new local unions. She spent several months traveling in Great Britain and on the continent, and in 1893, again went to England where she was the guest of Lady Henry Somerset at Reigate for some weeks. In 1895, she made a trip to the Mediterranean and the Orient as chaperon to a party of five young ladies, and spoke on temperance in the many countries visited. Not only was her voice heard in the cause of temperance, but she also was a writer. Barnes edited a manual on young women's temperance work and was a regular contributor both of prose and poetry to the Oak and Ivy Leaf, the organ of the National Young Women's Christian Temperance Union. She served president of the Loyal Legion Temperance Society of New York City for ten years, under whose care a free reading-room for working boys was maintained during that length of time, the attendance aggregating over 200,000 boys. Barnes died in 1920.

The organization was co-founded in 1997 by Paula Fasseas and her daughter Alexis Fasseas. The duo aspired to create an organization that focused on discovering solutions to end the euthanasia of homeless pets.  History  In 1998, Fasseas launched PAWS Chicago with an adoption event titled \\"Angels with Tails\\" aiming to save the lives of stray or homeless animals. The event facilitated animal adoptions, and was intended to raise awareness around the issue of pet overpopulation and the euthanasia of homeless animals. The event was held on Michigan Ave in Chicago, where the organization partnered with local businesses and boutiques who agreed to showcase animals in their storefronts. In 2000, PAWS opened the Lurie Spay and Neuter Clinic. The clinic offers free and low cost services in the Chicago area, performing over 17,000 spray and neuter surgeries each year. On September 7, 2007, PAWS opened its Lincoln Park adoption center located at 1997 N. Clybourn Ave. The new adoption center cost $9 million and is 13,000 square feet. It was the first cage-free shelter in the Midwest. PAWS works with shelters across the U.S., particularly in times of crisis and natural disaster. During Hurricane Katrina in 2005, PAWS volunteers drove from Chicago to Louisiana to rescue 200 pets caught in the floods. PAWS also assisted in rescuing animals in the 2008 flooding in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Quincy, Illinois, as well as the 2013 floods in Oklahoma. In August 2016, PAWS assisted in rescuing animals from floodings in Louisiana. PAWS also assisted in rescue efforts for Hurricane Irma in Florida, Hurricane Harvey in Texas in 2017, as well as Hurricane Michael in Florida in 2018. On December 1, 2013 Merrick Pet Care and PAWS teamed up to provide meals for the cats and dogs of PAWS. Merrick Pet Care provides food for all of PAWS pets as well as giving each pet that is newly adopted and their owner a supply of food. Since its inception, PAWS Chicago has reduced the number of animals euthanized in the city by 80 percent, becoming an active participant in the No Kill Movement.  Awards and recognition  In 2018, PAWS Chicago received a 4-star rating from Charity Navigator for the 16th consecutive year. Charity Navigator assesses non-profit organizations by rating their performances based on Financial Health and their Accountability and Transparency. The assessment found that charity‚Äôs total revenue sums up to $16,427,736 while 89.4 percent of the organizations total expenses are spent on the programs and services it delivers. In November 2012, Chicago Magazine named PAWS Chicago as one of their ‚Äúgold standard charities‚Äù under their Guide to Charitable Giving in Chicago. The guide is a means of navigating which charities readers should donate to when considering charitable gifting during the holiday season. The charities were ranked by a group philanthropic consultants, professors, and Charity Navigator, a non-profit website that rates the practicality of non- profit organizations on a four-scale rating. In January 2007, Paula Fasseas was labeled a \\"Transformer\\" by Chicago Magazine and honored as Chicago Magazine‚Äôs Chicagoan of the Year. The award is set out to honor a handful of people that have changed Chicago for the better. In 2003, PAWS Chicago won the Chicago Innovation Award by the Chicago Sun-Times. The award goes out to ten businesses in Chicago that have presented successful business developments and innovative marketing techniques. In 2008, Oprah Winfrey visited PAWS Chicago during the filming of a three-part series she was producing on puppy mills. The feature showcased good living environments and lifesaving work, which aided in putting PAWS name on the map across the country. Winfrey featured her self-funded suite for PAWS in loving memory of her cocker spaniel, Sophie, whom is featured on the 2009 cover of O, The Oprah Magazine. After the issue was released, there has been about a 50 percent decrease in the number of pets being euthanized in Chicago per year.  Events  The annual 'PAWS Beach Party' is organized to raise money for the organization. PAWS' 16th annual Beach Party in 2018 attracted over 500 guests and 125 dogs, raising over $300,000 for the organization. The money raised went towards funding PAWS' lifesaving program for homeless cats and dogs in addition to a renovation and an expansion of the medical center. The Fur Ball is an annual fundraising gala that showcases rescue cats and dogs for adoption. The gala includes a number of activities for the pets to participate in, such as buffets and paw-dicures while the humans engage in live auctions and raffles. In 2017, 800 people and 200 dogs attended the ball, collectively raising $1.3 million for the organization. In 2013, Smashing Pumpkins co-founder William Corgan and Michelin Guide-awarded star-chef, Curtis Duffy, made appearances at the Fur Ball, curating an event of their own to be auctioned off during the gala. Northwestern College in Bridgeview, IL hosted a 5K Run/Walk in September 2018 to benefit PAWS Chicago. Dubbed \\"PAWS for a Cause\\", the family-friendly event is open to the public and is designed to bring students, alumni, staff, and the Bridgeview/Burbank/Bedford Park communities together to raise funds for helpless animals in need. PAWS Chicago's 5K Walk/Run was named one of Chicago's Top 100 Events in 2016 and 2017, and Top 10 Athletic Events in 2017 by BizBash. In this event, owners and their pets are allowed to participate in a 5K. In addition to the race, there is also food and games for the participants. The Holiday Adopt-A-Thon is a two-day adoption marathon intended to help homeless pets find a home in time for the holidays. The event takes place during the holiday season to reduce the risk of the euthanasia of homeless pets in animal shelters during a time of the year when the shelters are short-staffed.

In the absence of a semantically better English word, scholars have translated the wide-ranging meaning of zhi as \\"excrescences\\", \\"exudations\\", and \\"cryptogams\\". Terminology Translating Chinese zhi (Ëäù) is problematic. For instance, a recent Chinese-English dictionary says: #mushroom, in general ‚Ä¶ an object shaped like a mushroom, e.g., a chariot canopy. #[singular] and in [compounds] Èùà~ l√≠ngzhƒ´, \\"numinous mushroom\\" and Á¥´~ z«êzhƒ´, \\"purple mushroom\\" (Ganoderma lucidum, G. japonicum), a type of polypore mushroom that grows on wood, especially rotting logs; particularly striking examples sometimes regarded as auspicious celestial omens for having qualities conducing to long life > an entheogenic plant, wondergrowth. #fragrant plan often equated with ÁôΩËä∑ b√°izh«ê, Chinese angelica; in combination with Ëò≠ l√°n [orchid] represents a person of high morality and integrity. #~È∫ª zhƒ´ma, sesame (Sesamum indicum) or sesame seeds. (Kroll 2017: 604-605) Zhi has synonyms of lingzhi (ÈùàËäù, numinous zhi), yinzhi (Èô∞Ëçâ, concealed zhi), and zhicao (ËäùËçâ, zhi plants), and is often associated with jade (Pregadio 2008: 1273). Several scholars have described the semantic range of zhi. *It certainly had a reference wider than anything we should call a fungus today, for it could include mineral excrescences recalling the shape of mushrooms, all kinds of cryptogams, and doubtless some fictitious plants. (Needham et al. 1976: 9, translating \\"magic mushrooms\\") *The term zhi, which has no equivalent in Western languages, refers to a variety of supermundane substances often described as plants, fungi, or \\"excrescences.\\" (Pregadio 2008: 1271) *Other translations that preserve the inflection of hidden or asexual reproduction include \\"excrescence\\" or \\"exudation\\", but \\"cryptogam\\" is perhaps the most fitting as it applies not only to mushrooms but also to algae, lichens, mosses, liverworts, and ferns. (Steavu 2018: 358) Early Chinese dictionaries provide insight into the semantics of zhi. The c. 4th or 3rd century BCE Erya (Shidi ÈáãËçâ, Explaining Plant[name]s) defines zh√≠gu√†n (Ê∑îÁÅå) as xi√∫zhƒ´ (Ëã¨Ëäù), \\"Zhiguan is a numinous mushroom\\" (tr. Steavu 2018: 359). Guo Pu's c. 310 commentary says he was unfamiliar with the zh√≠gu√†n, and glosses, \\"The zhi flowers three times in one year, it is a felicitous plant\\" (Ëäù‰∏ÄÊ≠≤‰∏âËèØËã¨ÁëûËçâ). The c. 1822 Erya subcommentary of Hao Yixing (ÈÉùÊáøË°å) says xi√∫zhƒ´ (Ëã¨Ëäù) is a copyist's error for junzhi (ËèåËäù, \\"mushrooms\\", see Baopuzi below), which is another synonym of lingzhi. The 121 CE Shuowen jiezi (Plant Radical section Ëâ∏ÈÉ®) defines zhi (Ëäù) as \\"divine plants\\" (Á•ûËâ∏‰πü) (tr. Steavu 2018: 357). The Chinese character for zhi is classified as a typical radical-phonetic compound character combining the \\"plant\\" radical Ëâπ and a zhƒ´ ( \\"to go; grammatical particle\\") phonetic element. In ancient oracle bone script and bronze inscription script, zh«ê < Old Chinese *t…ô î (Ê≠¢, \\"to stop; stop in\\", originally a \\"foot\\" pictograph) was used as a phonetic loan character for zhƒ´ < OC *t…ô (‰πã) (Karlgren 1957: 253-254). The zh«ê (Ëä∑ with the \\"plant radical\\", also written Ëäù) refers to the fragrant \\"Chinese angelica\\". Classical texts Daoist holding Ganoderma by Chen Hongshou The Chinese classics first recorded zhi (Ëäù) during the Warring States period (475‚Äì221 BCE) and the Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE). Occurrences in early Chinese histories, such as the (91 BCE) Shiji \\"Records of the Grand Historian\\" and (82 CE) Hanshu \\"Book of Han\\", predominantly refers to the \\"Mushroom of Immortality; elixir of life\\". They record that fangshi \\"masters of esoterica; alchemists; magicians\\", supposedly followers of Zou Yan (305‚Äì240 BCE), claimed to know secret locations like Mount Penglai where the magic Zhi mushroom grew. Some sinologists propose that the mythical zhi derived from Indian legends about soma that reached China around the 3rd century BCE (Unschuld 1985: 112). Fangshi courtiers convinced Qin and Han emperors, most notably Qin Shi Huang (r. 221‚Äì210 BCE) and Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141‚Äì87 BCE), to dispatch large expeditions (e.g., Xu Fu in 219 BCE) seeking the Zhi Plant of Immortality, but none produced tangible results. Zhi occurrences in other classical texts often refer to an edible fungus. The Liji \\"Record of Ritual\\" lists zhi \\"lichens\\" as a type of condiment (Legge 1885, 1: 461). The Chuci (Song of the South) metaphorically mentions, \\"The holy herb is weeded out\\" (tr. Hawkes 1985: 258). The Huainanzi (Philosophers of Huainan) records a zizhi (Á¥´Ëäù, \\"purple mushroom\\") aphorism, \\"The zhi fungus grows on mountains, but it cannot grow on barren boulders\\" (tr. Major et al. 2010: 634) Baopuzi The Jin Dynasty Daoist scholar Ge Hong's c. 320 CE Baopuzi (Master Who Embraces Simplicity) is the earliest surviving source of information about zhi excrescences. Based upon no longer extant texts and illustrations, Chapter 11 (Xianyao ‰ªôËó•, Medicines of Immortality) outlines folklore and knowledge about zhi, and elucidates the wuzhi (‰∫îËäù, Five Zhi) classification system. The chapter begins with quoting from the lost Shennong sijing (Á•ûËæ≤ÂõõÁ∂ì, Shennong's Four Classics) that rates zhi among \\"medicines of highest type\\", \\"The various (five) excrescences [mushrooms, lichens, etc.] may be nibbled, and cinnabar, jade flakes, laminar malachite, realgar, orpiment, mica, and brown hematite may be taken singly, and any of them can enable a man to fly and to enjoy Fullness of Life.\\" (tr. Ware 1966: 177). Ge Hong then explains the five numinous zhi classes based on their appearance and habitat, each said to have over 100 varieties: shizhi (Áü≥Ëäù), muzhi (Êú®Ëäù), caozhi (ËçâËäù), rouzhi (ËÇâËäù), and junzhi (ËèåËäù, see Erya above), which are translated as: *\\"stone, wood, grass, flesh, and champignon chih\\" (Feifel 1946: 4) *\\"rock, wood, herb, flesh, and tiny excrescences\\" (Ware 1966:179) *\\"stone, tree, plant, meat, and mushroom zhi (Pregadio 2008: 1273) Shizhi look like rocks, and grow from craggy cliffs or at the foot of lofty peaks. Muzhi grow from the roots or congealed sap of ancient trees, usually evergreens. Caozhi grow either among vegetation or in complete isolation from it, and appear morphologically identical to conventional plants, complete with stems, leaves, flowers, and fruit. Rouzhi include some exceedingly rare creatures, such as a 10,000-year-old horned toad, a 1,000-year-old white bat (which when eaten will extend one's lifespan to 40,000 or 1,000 years, respectively), and a 7-inch tall humanoid figure riding in a miniature horse-drawn carriage (which grants immediate xian-hood when consumed). Junzhi flourish where standard fungal growths proliferate, and can look like dragons, tigers, human beings, palaces, or flying birds (Steavu 2018: 362-363). Based upon later accounts of the Five Zhi, Lu tentatively identifies the three natural types. Shizhi is described as a shapeless and colorless thing, sometimes looking like a mass of fat, perhaps some underground stem species, such as Tuber sinense and Rhizopogon piceus. Muzhi is compared \\"tiny trees\\" on fuling (ËåØËãì, Wolfiporia extensa), which may refer to the fruiting bodies that grow out of the sclerotia. Caozhi can refer to the orchid tianma (Â§©È∫ª, lit. \\"heavenly cannabis\\", Gastrodia elata), the \\"root\\" of which is actually a stem tuber (2013: 54). Ge Hong also gives detailed Daoist purification and ritual instructions for gathering zhi excrescences, such as an adept walking with Yu's Pace when approaching, and using a bone knife to harvest them. Anyone who wants to gather zhi must wait for a calendrically auspicious day and can only enter the sacred mountains on the third or ninth lunar month, when the mountains are open to access and the zhi with miraculous curative power come forth. The Daoist adept is advised to have a Lingbao amulet, a white dog, and a white chicken before making sacrificial offerings to the mountain gods. Ultimately, whether or not adepts can find zhi depends upon their character and intelligence. Mediocre practitioners \\"do not know the art of entering mountains. One may have pictures, but if the shapes are not known it is utterly impossible to find the excrescences. All mountains, whether large or small, contain ghosts and gods which withhold these things from people, so it would be possible to be walking right over them without seeing them.\\" (tr. Ware 1966: 186) Another Baopuzi chapter uses ordinary and numinous zhijun (ËäùËèå, mushrooms) as an analogy for natural and alchemical gold. \\"Mushrooms grow naturally, but some genii classics speak of five sorts of \\"stone\\" and five sorts of \\"wood\\" excrescences [‰∫îÁü≥‰∫îÊú®Á®ÆËäù], which are gathered and taken after they appear, and are no different from the mushrooms which occur in nature [Ëá™ÁÑ∂Ëäù], for all of them will bring a man to Fullness of Life.\\" (16, tr. Ware 1966: 268). From this statement, Pregadio says although there may be no better zhi translation than \\"mushrooms\\" or \\"excrescences\\", they \\"pertain to an intermediate dimension between mundane and transcendent reality\\" (2008: 1273). Kristofer Schipper says that for Ge Hong, zhi mushrooms had \\"immortalizing properties\\" because they are produced from the sublimation of waidan alchemical minerals lying under the ground, notably gold and the divine cinnabar (cf. Mingjian yaojing below). Mushrooms are, so to speak \\"natural alchemical products, comparable to the great elixir, the quintessence derived from the transmutation of these very minerals\\" (1993: 174). Two of Ge Hong's descriptions are found in the Jiuzhuan huandan jing yaojue below. Taishang lingbao wufu xu The 3rd or 4th century Taishang lingbao wufu xu (Â§™‰∏äÈùàÂØ≥‰∫îÁ¨¶Â∫è, The Array of the Five Numinous Treasure Talismans) is sometimes cited as another early source that mentions zhi numinous mushrooms‚Äîa misunderstanding that is owing to the usage of wuzhi (‰∫îËäù) to mean \\"five plants\\" rather than \\"five excrescences\\". The text has a section titled Fushi wuzhi zhj jing (ÊúçÈ£ü‰∫îËäù‰πãÁ≤æ, Ingesting the Essences of the Five Plants), meaning \\"plants\\" since they are pine-resin (weixi Â®ÅÂÉñ), sesame (huma ËÉ°È∫ª), fagara (jiao Ê§í), ginger (jiang Ëñë), and calamus (changpu ËèñËí≤), Steavu translates Five Plants and notes this as one of the unambiguous and relatively rare occasions when the term zhi should be taken more generically as \\"plant\\" rather than \\"(numinous) mushroom\\" (2018: 363). However, the Taishang lingbao wufu xu mentions an otherwise unattested text named Shenxian zhi tu (Á•û‰ªôËäùÂúñ, Illustrations of the Mushrooms of Divine Immortality), which scholars associate with the five lost texts listed in the Baopuzi bibliographic chapter: Muzhi tu (Êú®ËäùÂúñ, Illustrations of Wood Mushrooms), Junzhi tu (ËèåËäùÂúñ, Illustrations of Fungus Mushrooms), Rouzhi tu (ËÇâËäùÂúñ, Illustrations of Flesh Mushrooms), Shizhi tu (Áü≥ËäùÂúñ, Illustrations of Stone Mushrooms), and Dapo zazhi tu (Â§ßÈ≠ÑÈõúËäùÂúñ, Illustrations of the Sundry Mushrooms of the Great Whitesoul) (Lu 2013: 54, tr. Steavu 2018: 363). Jiuzhuan huandan jing yaojue Queen Mother of the West holding a mushroom, Qing dynasty porcelain plate The second earliest reliable source of zhi information is the Maojun wuzhong zhirong fang (ËåÖÂêõ‰∫îÁ®ÆËäùËå∏Êñπ, The Method of Lord Mao's Five Kinds of Mushroom Growths) section of the 4th or 5th century Daoist Shangqing School waidan classic Taiji zhenren jiuzhuan huandan jing yaojue (Â§™Ê•µÁúü‰∫∫‰πùËΩâÈÇÑ‰∏πÁ∂ìË¶ÅË®£, Essential Instructions on the Scripture of the Reverted Elixir in Nine Cycles, by the Perfected of the Great Ultimate) (Steavu 2018: 364). The text's three sections comprise an alchemical recipe for the famous Elixir of the Nine Cycles, two methods for compounding minor drugs, and a brief account of the Shangqing saint Mao Ying (ËåÖÁõà) planting five sacred varieties of zhi (Ëäù, \\"'fungus'; supernatural plants that only adepts can recognize as such\\") (tr. Pregadio 2000: 174). These sections were first appended to Lord Mao's revealed biography from earlier sources, and then separated from it to form the present text (Pregadio 2008: 1273). According to Shangqing traditions, the Queen Mother of the West gave zhi numinous mushrooms to Lord Mao, who planted five kinds on the Shangqing center Maoshan (ËåÖÂ±±, Mt. Mao) in Jiangsu, which is the site of Jintan (ÈáëÂ£á, Golden Altar), one of the ten greater Grotto-Heavens, and Jinling (ÈáëÈôµ, Golden Mound), one of the seventy-two Blissful Lands (or Paradises, Á¶èÂú∞) (Miura 2008: 368-369). The Daoist scholar and alchemist Tao Hongjing (456-536), who compiled the Shangqing canon, recorded that the hidden mushrooms Lord Mao planted on Maoshan were still found during his lifetime (Strickmann 1979: 176). The Maojun wuzhong zhirong fang describes Lord Mao's five types of zhi fungi, recommends searching for them in the third or ninth month, gives instructions for consumption, and accounts their expected benefits. Two of these five descriptions closely correspond, almost verbatim, to passages from the caozhi \\"plant mushrooms\\" and muzhi \\"wood mushrooms\\" sub-headings in the Baopuzi, underscoring the text's \\"status as a locus classicus of all things at once Daoist and fungal\\" (Steavu 2018: 365). Concerning the Jiuzhuan huandan jing yaojue uniting two sections about waidan alchemical elixirs with one about zhi excrescences, Strickmann says the \\"juxtaposition of alchemy and occult horticulture is very suggestive\\", and provides two other parallels for the Daoist fusion of plants and minerals (1979: 170). The waidan alchemical langgan huadan (ÁêÖÁéïËèØ‰∏π, Elixir Efflorescence of Langgan), which is prepared through an \\"extraordinary amalgam\\" of vegetable and mineral processes, may have come into being through a conscious fusion of the two types of instructions, originally discretely mineral and vegetable, in the life of Lord Mao (1979: 136, 170). Tao Hongjing's disciple Zhou Ziliang (Âë®Â≠êËâØ, 497‚Äì516) was commanded by Shangqing deities to commit ritual suicide with an elixir of poisonous mushrooms and cinnabar, which in one sense, indicated the \\"mortal- immortal's comprehensive power over the elements\\" (1979: 176). The lethal ingredients in Zhou's jiuzhen yuli dan (‰πùÁúüÁéâÁÄù‰∏π, Ninefold Perfected Jade-liquor Elixir) were langgezhi (ÁêÖËëõËäù, \\"the nine-stalked purple fungus\\") and jade- infused vermillion (1979: 159). Mingjian yaojing The third earliest source is the c. 7th or 8th century Laozi yuxia zhongzhi jing shenxian bishi (ËÄÅÂ≠êÁéâÂå£‰∏≠Á®ÆËäùÁ∂ìÁ•û‰ªôÁßò‰∫ã, Scripture on Growing Mushrooms from Laozi's Jade Casket: The Secret of Divine Immortals) is the last section of the Mingjian yaojing (ÊòéÈëíË¶ÅÁ∂ì, Scripture on the Essentials of the Bright Mirror [Method]), and shares passages with another Shangqing text, the Zhong zhicao fa (Á®ÆËäùËçâÊ≥ï, Methods for Planting the Zhi Plants), probably dating from the late Six Dynasties (222-589) or Southern dynasties (420-589) periods (Pregadio 2008: 1273, Lu 2013: 52). The Shenxian bishi is the only text in the Daoist Canon that precisely explains the fungiculture for numinous zhi, in contrast, other canonical texts simply guide mushroom hunters in identifying and locating zhi in the wild. It contains instructions attributed to Laozi that the best zhi are those that grow above deposits of cinnabar (dansha ‰∏πÁ†Ç), gold (huangjin ÈªÉÈáë), laminar malachite (cengqing ÊõæÈùí), and realgar (xionghuang ÈõÑÈªÉ), and teaches how to bury these minerals in the four seasons and the four directions of a mountain in order to generate the four zhi excrescences. This Daoist text has an unusually detailed description of only four zhi, rivaling the Baopuzi in terms of \\"the amount of information provided per specimen\\" (Steavu 2018: 366, 368). The text begins with a passage contrasting three kinds of plant-based medicinal and spiritual substances: longevity drugs, naturally growing zhi excrescences, and artificially cultivated ones. Traditional Chinese medicines, such as asparagus root (tianmen dong Â§©ÈñÄÂÜ¨), or atractylis (shanji Â±±Ëìü), can be effective in improving health and extending lifespan, but only if properly consumed every day. The varieties of numinous zhi mushrooms that grow on trees or mountains can bestow full immortality, however most need to be ingested gradually over many years before the adept achieves transcendence. Only zhi that are cultivated above four special soil conditioning minerals, which are highly-valued in Chinese alchemy, can grant immortality almost instantly upon ingestion (Steavu 2018: 368). The esoteric basis for these mushrooms' exceptional potency is explained, > Indeed, accretions on top of cinnabar, accretions on top of gold, accretions > on top of laminar malachite, and accretions on top of realgar, all of them > generate [numinous] mushrooms. These mushrooms are not those of utmost > virtue that respond to divinity, for one can encounter them yet not see them > and not be able to eat them. The reason why these mushrooms can immediately > make people become immortals is because, by receiving the perfect essence > [zhijing Ëá≥Á≤æ] of those four substances, they incorporate the harmonious > breath [heqi ÂíåÊ∞£] of Heaven and Earth and Yin and Yang along with its > fragrant fluids; and by means of this they accomplish generative > transformation. These [four] medicines are in fact divine on account of the > basic nature of those four substances. (tr. Steavu 2018: 369) Take laminar malachite (cengqing ÊõæÈùí, lit. \\"layered blue\\"), the first of the four alchemical minerals, as an example of the Laozi yuxia zhongzhi jing shenxian bishi's detailed instructions for cultivating supernatural zhi. > On a day at the beginning of spring, dig up the ground at the [shaded] East- > northeast area of a household. Whether it is on the inside or the outside of > the dwelling does not matter; it is only necessary to obtain [a site with] > good soil that is not too ashen. Dig and make hole that is three feet deep > and three feet across. Take one catty [1.3 pounds] of laminar malachite > mineral and process it into grounds. Wrap the grounds in a sheep's [skin] to > keep them together. Sprinkle with half a liter of blue cockscomb (Celosia > cristata) [and place them in the hole]. Cover with soil and pound on top. > After seven days, there should be blue clouds that come and cover the site, > and after seventy days, it will generate blue breath that [rises and] > connects with the blue clouds above. After a hundred days, a [blue] mushroom > will sprout atop the site, as shown in the following image [the image is > missing]. On a yinmao day following sunset, make an offering of three feet > of blue silk, while grasping a bone knife, perform the Pace of Yu and cut > out the mushroom. [Depart] and be careful not to look back [after completing > the harvest]. Then, return to dry the mushroom in the shade for one hundred > clays and process it into grounds. Ingest one spatula full and take it > thrice daily by means of fragrant well water. When the mushroom is entirely > consumed, you will immediately be able to lightly float about. Gods will > arrive to welcome you. You will ascend to heaven in broad daylight and be as > limitless as Heaven and Earth. (tr. Steavu 2018: 369-370) Several of these particular ritual elements for cultivating a malachite zhi are found in the Baopuzi passage on mushroom junzhi, including the exorcistic Pace of Yu, the bone knife, and the specifics of drying and processing. These instructions are essentially a more intricate version of what is found in the Baopuzi, a source that \\"set the standard for texts on numinous mushrooms and was still used as a template over five hundred years after it was written\\" (Steavu 2018: 370). Directives for the three remaining types of zhi mushrooms follow the same sacramental blueprint as well. The adept follows a precise practice of planting, harvesting, and consuming zhi fungi that sprout upon a divine class of minerals identified with four of the Wuxing (Five Agents, Five Phases), corresponding to the spring/east/blue malachite zhi in seasons, cardinal directions, cloud and mist colors, and supernatural results. Summer/south/red cinnabar zhi: will transform all internal illnesses into turbid blood that flows out through the mouth and nose, and adepts will \\"immediately be able to pace on water, [pass through] flames and fire without getting burned, and cut out grains and not eat [without being hungry]\\" (Steavu 2018: 371). Autumn/west/yellow gold zhi: ensures that \\"the old will be young anew, the young will develop a beautiful countenance, white hair will all turn black, and lost teeth will grow back\\" (Steavu 2018: 372). Winter/north/purple zhi realgar zhi: they will \\"enjoy longevity coterminous with Heaven. Stabbing and slicing will not pierce them, nor will fire burn them, and submerging them in water will not [even] wet them. The five poisons will keep away from them, evil spirits will be dispelled, and they will not know hunger or thirst\\" (Steavu 2018: 373). Sanhuang neibi wen The c. 10th- or 11th-century Bianshi sanshiliu zhong zhicao bianxing zhang (ËæØË≠ò‰∏âÂçÅÂÖ≠Á®ÆËäùËçâËÆäÂΩ¢Á´†, Chapter on the Explanation and Discernment of the Thirty-Six Varieties of Mushroom Plants' Transformations of Form) is part of a larger section on mountain survival in the Sanhuang neibi wen (‰∏âÁöáÂÖßÁ•ïÊñá, Esoteric Secret Writ of the Three Sovereigns). This source is a compilation of methods traditionally associated with the Sanhuang (‰∏âÁöá, Three Sovereigns) tradition, which was an integral part of the southern Jiangnan esoteric lore, including the mycological path to immortality, that Ge Hong documented in his Baopuzi. This chapter on mushrooms lists the names of four sets of nine numinous zhi mushrooms, divided according to where they grow (on sacred mountains, along riverbanks, in caves, or on withered trees) along with details of their respective appearances and benefits (Steavu 2018: 367). The two subsequent chapters in the Sanhuang neibi wen describe a list of thirty-six medicinal xianyao (‰ªôËó•, herbs of immortality) and jingcao (Á≤æËçâ, essence-plants) (ËæØË≠ò‰∏âÂçÅÂÖ≠Á®Æ‰ªôËó•ÂΩ¢ÂÉèÁ´†), and a talismanic seal of the dihuang (Âú∞Áöá, Earthly Sovereign) by means of which practitioners can cause numinous herbs and mushrooms to manifest before them (Âú∞ÁöáÂêõÊúçÈ§å‰ªôÊúÆÊòá‰ªôÂæóÈÅìÁ´†) (Steavu 2018: 368). Taishang lingbao zhicao pin The early 11th-century Song dynasty Taishang lingbao zhicao pin (Â§™‰∏äÈùàÂØ∂ËäùËçâÂìÅ, Numinous Treasure Catalogue of Mushroom Plants), contained in the 1444 Ming Dynasty edition Daozang \\"Daoist canon\\", contains brief descriptions and illustrations of 127 types of numinous zhi. A 1598 Ming dynasty reprint includes woodblock pictures (see below), whose aesthetic appeal typifies the pu (Ë≠ú, \\"catalogs; manuals\\") of uncommon objects compiled by Song and later literati (Pregadio 2008: 1274). The text uses botanical terms to describe the appearance of zhi (stalk, branch, leaf, root), depicts the habitats and the seasons suitable for growth, and reports zhi tastes, as well as methods of picking, preparing, and eating. Some illustrations even show the gills (Lu 2013: 54). Not all the 127 kinds of zhi have a unique name: twelve terms are used to name twenty-eight kinds of zhi, for example, five are named zizhi (Á¥´Ëäù, purple mushroom). Twenty-five of these zhi terms correspond with the Five Phases theory of jin (Èáë, Metal), mu (Êú®, Wood), shui (Ê∞¥, Water), huo (ÁÅ´, Fire), and tu (Âúü, Earth). For instance, each phase name is compounded with -jingzhi (Á≤æËäù, -spirit zhi), see jinjingzhi (ÈáëÁ≤æËäù, metal spirit zhi) and mujingzhi (Êú®Á≤æËäù, wood spirit zhi) below. One scholar divided the 127 types of zhi into six groups: single umbrella-shaped macrofungi (34 kinds), umbrella-shaped macrofungi in clusters (8), umbrella- shaped and cup-shaped macrofungi with branches on a stalk (12 kinds), umbrella-shaped macrofungi in layers (18 kinds), strange umbrella-shaped and cup-shaped macrofungi (29), and non-macrofungi (26 kinds) (Lu 2013: 53). For example, the gui junzhi (È¨ºËèåËäù, ghost mushroom) entry says, \\"The ghost mushroom grows on the shady [north] side of famous mountains, and has a white lid shaped like cooking pot. Two ghosts who guard it will disappear if seen by a human. One should gather it at night, dry it in the shade for 100 days, and directly consume it in a single dose like a medicinal powder. The legendary Weaver Girl took one dose and became a xian transcendent who rose right up into heaven\\" (È¨ºËèåËäùÁîüÊñºÂêçÂ±±‰πãÈô∞ÁôΩËìãÁãÄÂ¶ÇÁîë‰∫åÈ¨ºÂÆà‰πãË¶ã‰∫∫Âç≥ÊªÖ‰ª•Â§úÊé°‰πãÈô∞‰πæÁôæÊó•È£üÂ¶ÇÂàÄÂú≠ÊâÄÂêëÁõ°ÊúçÁπîÂ•≥Êúç‰πã‰ªôÊòáÂ§©Áü£). Despite the epigrammatic nature of its entries, the Taishang lingbao zhicao pin is exceptional on account of its \\"exhaustive scope and its vivid iconography\\". It was likely compiled as a throwback to the lost illustrated mycological inventories mentioned in the Baopuzi, and in faithfully emulating these early sources, the text \\"established itself an enduring paragon of the genre\\" (Steavu 2018: 336).

Some pharmacopoeias that incorporated the zhi may have played a role in this process, as the term zhi became identified with common mushrooms, resulting in an emphasis on their healing properties (Pregadio 2008: 1274). The (ca. 1st or 2nd century CE) Shennong bencao jing (Divine Farmer's Classic of Pharmaceutics) classifies zhi into six color types, each of which is believed to benefit the qi \\"Life Force\\" in a different part of the body: qingzhi (ÈùíËäù, Green Mushroom) for Liver, chizhi (Ëµ§Ëäù, Red Mushroom) for Heart, huangzhi (ÈªÉËäù, Yellow Mushroom) for Spleen, baizhi (ÁôΩËäù, White Mushroom) for Lungs, heizhi (ÈªëËäù, Black Mushroom) for Kidneys, and zizhi (Á¥´Ëäù, Purple Mushroom\\" for Essence. According to the Chinese mycologist Zhao Jiding (Ë∂ôÁπºÈºé), Green zhi refers to Coriolus versicolor, Red zhi to Ganoderma lucidum, Yellow zhi to Laetiporus sulphureus, White zhi to Fomitopsis officinalis, Black zhi to Amauroderma rugosum or Polyporus melanopus, and Purple zhi to Ganoderma sinense (Lu 2013: 43). The (1596) Bencao Gangmu (Compendium of Materia Medica) has a zhi (Ëäù) category that includes the same green, red, yellow, white, black, and purple liuzhi (ÂÖ≠Ëäù Six Mushrooms) and sixteen other fungi, mushrooms, and lichens, such as the mu'er (Êú®ËÄ≥, lit. \\"wood ear\\", Auricularia polytricha). The Bencao Gangmu author Li Shizhen classified these six differently colored Zhi as Xiancao (‰ªôËçâ, \\"immortality herbs\\"), and described the effects of chizhi \\"red mushroom\\": \\"It positively affects the life-energy, or Qi of the heart, repairing the chest area and benefiting those with a knotted and tight chest. Taken over a long period of time, the agility of the body will not cease, and the years are lengthened to those of the Immortal Fairies\\" (tr. Halpern 2007: 59). The Bencao Gangmu does not list lingzhi as a variety of zhi, but as an alternate name for the shi'er (Áü≥ËÄ≥, \\"stone ear\\", Umbilicaria esculenta lichen). According to Stuart and Smith, \\"[The Áü≥ËÄ≥] is edible, and has all of the good qualities of the Ëäù ([Zhi]), it is also being used in the treatment of gravel, and said to benefit virility. It is specially used in hemorrhage from the bowels and prolapse of the rectum\\" (1911: 274). Chinese pharmaceutical handbooks on Zhi mushrooms were the first illustrated publications in the history of mycology. The historian of Chinese science Joseph Needham discussed a lost Liang Dynasty (502‚Äì587) illustrated text called Zhong Shenzhi (Á®ÆÁ•ûËäù, \\"On the Planting and Cultivation of Magic Mushrooms\\"). \\"The pictures of mushrooms, in particular, must have been an extremely early landmark in the history of mycology, which was a late- developing science in the West. The title of [this book] shows that fungi of some kind were being regularly cultivated ‚Äì hardly as food, with that special designation, more probably medicinal, conceivably hallucinogenic.\\" (Needham and Lu 1986: 261).

History  After World War I the French Army had large numbers of artillery pieces that could trace their origins back to the turn of the century. In the years between the two world wars a number of factors conspired to hinder the modernization of French artillery such as limited budgets, competing priorities (fortifications, tanks, navy, and aircraft), large stocks of ammunition, large stocks of spare guns and complacency about the effectiveness of existing weaponry. These factors meant that France went into World War II with large numbers of old artillery and modernization efforts mainly focused on converting older guns to use motor traction (sprung suspension and pneumatic tires) instead of horse traction. In the aftermath of World War II, the French Army was equipped with a variety of weaponry. There were French, British, German and US weapons in use. In 1946 DEFA (Direction des √âtudes et Fabrications d'Armement) began a design study to build a new 105 mm howitzer for the French Army to replace its assortment of weapons. It would be the first 105 mm gun designed and built in Western Europe after World War II.  Design  The mle 1950 would be a departure from previous designs because it would feature a three outrigger tripod carriage which was more common for anti-aircraft guns than howitzers. For travel, the gun was towed by one rearward facing outrigger which had a towing eye and two outriggers folded forward for the barrel to rest on. The carriage also had a two-wheeled torsion bar suspension and a curved three- piece gun shield for the crew. Once in firing position, the wheels were raised and the outriggers were spread to form a Y. This allowed a wide range of elevation -7¬∞ to +70¬∞ as well as 360¬∞ traverse similar to the Soviet D30 howitzer. However, unlike the D30 the mle 1950 had a gun shield, its hydro- pneumatic recoil system was mounted below the barrel, it had a double-baffle muzzle brake, and there wasn't a towing eye on the barrel.  Self-propelled artillery  In addition to its towed version the mle 1950 was the primary armament of the Mk 61 105mm self-propelled howitzer. This consisted of a mle 1950 mounted in a large non-traversing armored casemate on an AMX-13 light tank chassis.

Young, , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld Virginia and all states' right to restrict Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to citizens. The court rejected claims that this restriction is in violation of Privileges or Immunities Clause because FOIA requests are not a \\"fundamental\\" privilege or immunity of citizenship. The court also upheld that Virginia FOIA does not violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. The \\"common thread\\" among this Court's dormant Commerce Clause cases is that the State interfered with the natural functioning of the interstate market either through prohibition or thorough burdensome regulation. Virginia's FOIA, by contrast, neither prohibits access to an interstate market nor imposes burdensome regulation on that market.  Background  Petitioners Mark J. McBurney and Roger W. Hurlbert are citizens of Rhode Island and California respectively. McBurney and Hurlbert each requested documents under the Virginia FOIA, but their requests were denied because of their citizenship. McBurney is a former resident of Virginia whose ex-wife is a Virginia citizen. After his ex-wife defaulted on her child support obligations, McBurney asked the Commonwealth's Division of Child Support Enforcement to file a petition for child support on his behalf. The agency complied, but only after a 9-month delay. McBurney attributes that delay to agency error and says that it cost him nine months of child support. To ascertain the reason for the agency's delay, McBurney filed a Virginia FOIA request seeking ‚Äúall emails, notes, files, memos, reports, letters, policies, opinions‚Äù pertaining to his family, along with all documents ‚Äúregarding [his] application for child support‚Äù and all documents pertaining to the handling of child support claims like his. The agency denied McBurney's request on the ground that he was not a Virginia citizen. McBurney later requested the same documents under Virginia's Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act, and through that request he received most of the information he had sought that pertained specifically to his own case. He did not, however, receive any general policy information about how the agency handled claims like his.. Hurlbert is the sole proprietor of Sage Information Services, a business that requests real estate tax records on clients‚Äô behalf from state and local governments across the United States. In 2008, Hurlbert was hired by a land/title company to obtain real estate tax records for properties in Henrico County, Virginia. He filed a Virginia FOIA request for the documents with the Henrico County Real Estate Assessor's Office, but his request was denied because he was not a Virginia citizen.  Opinion of the Court  Justice Alito delivered the majority opinion of the unanimous Court. Justice Thomas additionally submitted a concurring opinion. Alito examines whether Virginia Freedom of Information Act violates either the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Constitution or the dormant Commerce Clause. The Virginia Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), provides that \\"all public records shall be open to inspection and copying by any citizens of the Commonwealth,\\" but it grants no such right to non-Virginians. Petitioners, who are citizens of other States, unsuccessfully sought information under the Act and then brought this constitutional challenge. We hold, however, that petitioners‚Äô constitutional rights were not violated. By means other than the state FOIA, Virginia made available to petitioners most of the information that they sought, and the Commonwealth's refusal to furnish the additional information did not abridge any constitutionally protected privilege or immunity. Nor did Virginia violate the dormant Commerce Clause. The state Freedom of Information Act does not regulate commerce in any meaningful sense, but instead provides a service that is related to state citizenship. For these reasons, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals rejecting petitioners‚Äô constitutional claims. Justice Thomas while concurring with the opinion of the court, specifically criticizes the relevance of the dormant Commerce Clause in the US Constitution stating ‚ÄúThe negative Commerce Clause has no basis in the text of the Constitution, makes little sense, and has proved virtually unworkable in application, and, consequently, cannot serve as a basis for striking down a state statute.‚Äù References  External links  * United States Supreme Court cases United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court 2013 in United States case law ","title":"McBurney v.

He was a key member of the theoretical team which developed and tested Soviet thermonuclear weapons from 1952 and he led a theoretical department at the Soviet nuclear research facility at Arzamas-16 from 1967 to 2004. Early life and education Goncharov was born in Kalinin [reverted to Tver in 1991], 160 km northwest of Moscow. From 1941 to 1943, he was evacuated with his family to the Kuybyshev region [reverted to Samara in 1991]. In 1946 he graduated from high school in Kalinin, winning a gold medal. He enrolled at the Moscow State University in the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics ‚Äì without taking any entrance exams ‚Äì and in 1947 transferred to the Physics and Technical Faculty, from which he graduated in 1952. The Faculty was at Laboratory No. 3 of the USSR Academy of Sciences (now the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics), under the direction of Abraham Alikhanov. While here, he trained in mountaineering in the Caucasus. Career In June 1952, Goncharov was assigned to work in the department of experimental nuclear reactors at KB-11, usually referred to as Arzamas-16 and now known as All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics (VNIIEhF), in Sarov, Nizhny Novgorod region. It was a closed entity, constructed by slave labour from a gulag next to the nuclear facility. In his first year, he was deeply affected by the fact he was not allowed to leave, even to visit his parents, but kept himself distracted by the work. He worked as a senior laboratory assistant and from September 1952 as an engineer. In the same year, Goncharov was sent to work in the theoretical department of KB-11 (where Andrei Sakharov was departmental head) in Theoretical Sector 1 under Igor Tamm; there he took part in work on the first Soviet thermonuclear weapon, RDS-6s, tested at the Semipalatinsk Test Site on August 12, 1953. In September 1953, Goncharov transferred to the post of staff member of the theoretical department. He was a co-author of a detailed feasibility study undertaken by a team in 1954 and 1955, involving the theory, design and calculations of the next-generation RDS-37 device, an air-delivered two-stage thermonuclear bomb which was detonated in 1956: in the first stage, x-ray radiation was produced from a primary nuclear charge; in the second stage the radiation compressed a thermonuclear core resulting in a fusion reaction. The development of this more-efficient and more-powerful Soviet thermonuclear weapon was galvanized by reports of American success with a high-yield device on 1 March 1954, the first of the Castle Bravo tests. The design was what Sakharov referred to as \\"the third idea\\" which he'd originally mulled over in 1949 (the two-stage model was initiated by Stanislaw Ulam; an original patent application for the invention was submitted by Klaus Fuchs and John von Neumann who were employed at Los Alamos in May 1946). For this work, Goncharov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour in 1956. In 1958, his co- design of a further improved device was tested and then put into production. Between 1959 and 1961, he developed original technical ideas, later credited to him as inventions, which were included in all further Soviet nuclear devices, and he co-designed and was involved in the testing several new bombs. He was involved in the design of the principal physical scheme of the RDS-220 bomb, 'Tsar Bomba', the largest-ever nuclear device. For his creative efforts in the work from 1959, he received the Lenin Prize in 1962. Goncharov proposed methods of measuring the power of underground nuclear tests in 1963. In 1965, using his theoretical results, he suggested a new direction for the design of Soviet thermonuclear weapons of megatonne yields. The first successful test of these improved weapons was conducted in 1966, using his measurement scheme, in tunnels at Novaya Zemlya. This generation of weapons went into mass production and was put into service with the USSR on land and sea-based missiles. Goncharov was appointed to the post of head of the theoretical department of KB-11 in 1967, a position he held until 2004. He officially became a doctor of physical and mathematical sciences in 1973 and a professor in 1995. In the period from 1955 to 1983, Goncharov participated in ten aerial and underground nuclear tests at Semipalatinsk, Novaya Zemlya and Azgir, during most of which time he was deputy head of scientific research or a member of the State Commission. In his later years, he studied and wrote about the history of the Soviet nuclear industry and the development of the nuclear arms race: he compiled the multivolume collection of archival documents \\"The Atomic Project of the USSR. Documents and materials.\\" He was the principal figure in the declassification of Soviet archives on nuclear weapons under Boris Yeltsin. Goncharov worked as chief research officer of the Institute of Theoretical and Mathematical Physics of VNIIEhF from 2002. He died on September 7, 2009 in Moscow and was buried at the Troekurov cemetery.

It was located at the junction of the Lehigh Valley's Flemington Branch and Main Line, although the name predated the opening of the branch by eight years. The Lehigh Valley Railroad, via its Easton and Amboy Railroad subsidiary, extended its main line east from Easton, Pennsylvania, to Jersey City, New Jersey, between 1872‚Äì1875. The extension officially opened on June 28, 1875. The location, which had passenger service but no passenger building, was then called Barton's Bridge. A stagecoach line carried passengers into Flemington, New Jersey proper. The company adopted the name \\"Flemington Junction\\" on April 16, 1876. A freight house opened later that year. A separate passenger building was not constructed until 1879‚Äì1882. The Flemington Branch, a line into Flemington, opened on August 4, 1884. As late as 1948 a gas-electric motor car made eleven round-trips per day between Flemington Junction and Flemington, but change was coming. Buses replaced the train over the branch in 1952; the buses themselves were withdrawn in 1957. The freight house was torn down in 1955 as business declined.

Academic career  Meshkov received his undergraduate A.B. degree in physics (1947) and his Ph.D. in physics (1954) from the University of Pennsylvania, as well as his M.S. (1949) from the University of Illinois. He held positions at many institutions, most notably at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS, now known as NIST) as a member of the Senior Executive Service (1962‚Äì1990), and at Caltech, where he was a Visiting Associate and a Visiting Professor of Theoretical Physics in the 1970s and 1980s. He was a LIGO staff member from 1994 to 2020. Before joining LIGO, Meshkov left NIST to spend four years at the Superconducting Super Collider (1990‚Äì1994). He also held positions at Princeton University, the Weizmann Institute, the University of Texas at Arlington, the University of Pittsburgh, the Center for Theoretical Studies, University of Miami, UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, UC Irvine, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Delaware. Meshkov was one of the original organizers for a series of conferences on physics (the \\"Coral Gables conferences\\"), taking place at or near the University of Miami, which began in 1964 and continue to the present.32nd Coral Gables ConferenceMiami ConferencesMiami 2020 He also played an important role in the development of the Aspen Center for Physics (1968‚Äì2020) as Secretary and Trustee, and finally as an Honorary Trustee. When he started working at LIGO, he and Gary Sanders started the first winter conference on gravitational wave detection at Aspen. He continued as a chair of the Gravitational Wave Advanced Detector Workshop (GWADW) series of LIGO conferences until his death in 2020.GWADW 2017  Research  Meshkov worked and published research in four fields of physics: Atomic, Nuclear, Elementary Particle, and Gravitational Wave Detection. In his Ph.D. Thesis, on the Theory of Complex Spectra, he developed new techniques for calculating N body matrix elements from 2 and 3 body matrix elements. He applied these techniques, successfully, to Nuclear Spectroscopy and became proficient in shell model calculations. While on an extended visit at Princeton University in 1960, working together with Carl Levinson and Manoj Banerjee, Meshkov learned about and then used the group SU(3) to do dynamical calculations in Nuclear Spectroscopy. Meshkov continued the work on SU(3), collaborating with Levinson, at the Weizmann Institute in 1961‚Äì62. In the fall of 1961 Yuval Ne'eman returned to Israel, following completion of his Ph.D. with Abdus Salam at Imperial College London, in which he had developed the Eightfold Way (physics) in work similar to research done independently by Murray Gell-Mann. Since SU(3) was an integral part of this work, Levinson and Meshkov, later joined by Harry Lipkin, used their knowledge of SU(3) to explore this new field. a.k.a. I spin, U spin, Vee all spin! Together with Salam, they showed that the Eightfold Way was correct (instead of the older Sakata model), invented the U-spin and V-spin subgroups of SU(3), and showed that the photon was a U-spin scalar. Meshkov also produced a set of useful SU(3) 8x8 Clebsch‚ÄìGordan coefficients. In the meantime, Meshkov, Snow, and Yodh demonstrated the validity of SU(3) flavor symmetry in reaction analyses. Lipkin and Meshkov invented W-spin and SU(6)W, which allowed the combination of external and internal symmetries, for co-linear processes. Peter Kaus and Meshkov collaborated in a series of papers exploring quark structure, and extended this work to neutrinos., Erratum: A4 (1989) 603 Meshkov's subsequent innovations include influential contributions to hadronic physics. Meshkov started working on LIGO, in 1994; this is the detector that ultimately observed cosmic gravitational waves. At the time, he was chair of the Aspen Center for Physics Winter Conferences. Together with Gary Sanders, he started the first Gravitational Wave Detection Conference in Aspen in 1995. This has evolved into a three-year cycle of GWADW conferences, rotating between the United States, Europe (in particular, the island of Elba), and Japan or Australia. Until 2020, Meshkov was either Chair or Co-chair of these conferences to explore upgrades and possible new facilities and techniques for gravitational wave detection.

The heritage listing also includes three related memorials, two at Queens Wharf Reserve in Parramatta and one at Garden Island in Sydney. The original HMAS Parramatta was commissioned in 1910, paid off in 1928, and wrecked in 1934. The bow and stern sections were subsequently converted into memorials, while the third memorial relates to the second HMAS Parramatta, sunk in service at Tobruk in World War II. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 December 2006.  History  =HMAS Parramatta Shipwreck= The wreck of the former HMAS Parramatta (I) is remarkable for its early associations with the establishment of Commonwealth Naval forces. A torpedo boat destroyer (TBD), Parramatta (I) was the first of six built to serve as fast hunters of the \\"River\\" Class, a modification of the British \\"I\\" Class destroyer. This class was the last British warship designed with an external rudder system. With Pennant Number \\"55\\" painted on the bow, Parramatta was the first of the Australian group built by the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company at Govan, Scotland in 1910. It was also the first to arrive in Australian waters. The wreck of the former HMAS Parramatta in 2016 The class was noted for its length of 250 feet (76.2 metres) and displacement of 700 tons, a range of 2, 400 miles (3,862) at a speed of fifteen knots. They were equipped with one four-inch gun, three twelve pounders and three eighteen inch torpedo tubes. Sister ship HMAS Yarra (1910) was built by the famous firm of William Denny and Brothers at Dumbarton, Scotland; HMAS Warrego (1911) in the same yard as Parramatta and re-erected at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, Sydney; with HMAS Swan (1915), HMAS Huon (1914) and HMAS Torrens (1915) built solely at Cockatoo. HMAS Parramatta (I) was one of a number of vessels ordered for the Commonwealth's new naval forces in 1909, following the assimilation of the various colonial fleets post-Federation. Various proposals were forwarded for the modernisation and expansion of the navy which lead to the construction of Parramatta between 1909 and 1910. The keel of the flagship, the elegant battle-cruiser HMAS Australia (I) was also laid in 1910, followed by the Chattam-Class cruisers HMAS Melbourne and HMAS Sydney in 1912. Parramatta found itself the first completed vessel of the Royal Australian Navy when King George V proclaimed the establishment of the navy on 10 July 1911. With the outbreak of war in 1914, Parramatta (I) immediately saw active service in German New Guinea serving with the Australian fleet led by HMAS Australia (I). This powerful force included the light cruisers Sydney, Melbourne, Encounter and Pioneer; the two newly arrived E-Class submarines AE1 and AE2; and Parramatta's sisters Yarra and Warrego. Their duty was to flush out the feared German Pacific cruiser squadron under Admiral Maximilian von Spee (which had in fact already fled). The fleet first assisted the allied landings at key installations in German New Guinea, capturing the important naval base at Rabaul, the capital of the German colony. After taking Rabaul and on patrol duties with the submarine AE1, HMAS Parramatta (I) was the last vessel to see the submarine which sank mysteriously with all hands on 14 September 1914. During 1914, Parramatta (I) steamed 193 miles (310.6 kilometres) up the dangerous Sepik River in New Guinea in search of enemy vessels. Parramatta spent much of 1915 and 1916 enforcing shipping movements in the western Pacific. In mid-1917 the whole destroyer flotilla was sent to the Mediterranean Sea and based at Brindisi, Italy, on Adriatic Sea patrols to seek out enemy submarines. On 12 November 1918, Parramatta (I) was part of the Allied fleet that entered the Dardanelles after Turkey agreed to an armistice. After the war, the destroyers sailed to England for leave, then returned to Australia. Here they were individually decommissioned between 1919 and 1928. Parramatta (I) ended up in the Hawkesbury River as a proposed hulk for the New South Wales Prisons Department, following its decommissioning in 1929. Parramatta was sold soon after to George Rhodes of Cowan and used as a blue-metal storage barge. It was sold again to local marine engineer Norman Murphie who was the stepson of the esteemed Edward Windybank and finally used to store water for local residents during the Depression. Here in 1934, Parramatta blew ashore on a mud flat in Cascade Gully, adjacent to Milson Island and became a total wreck. Squatters allegedly lived on the remains during this time. In 1972, the Naval Historical Society of Australia began a project to recover the bow and stern for a memorial to the vessel and its later namesakes (Parramatta (2) and Parramatta (3), and Australian naval history generally. However, funding and other constraints delayed the project with the stern finally being mounted in Queens Wharf Reserve, Parramatta in 1981 and the bow at Garden Island in 1986. = HMAS Parramatta (II) = HMAS Parramatta (II) was constructed at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, Sydney, for the Royal Australian Navy as ship number 131. Construction was started on 9 November 1938, the vessel launched on 10 June 1939, and completed on 4 April 1940. The overall length was 266 feet (81 metres) and displacement 1,080 tons. HMAS Parramatta (II) was active during World War II in the East Indies and the Mediterranean Sea. Parramatta (II), a Grimsby class escort sloop, was sunk by the German U-boat U-559 on 27 November 1941. The action occurred in the Mediterranean Sea off Tobruk, North Africa. 138 lives were lost with only 24 survivors. The incident stands as the fourth worst loss of RAN lives during armed conflict, with HMAS Yarra (also 138 lives), after HMAS Sydney (645 lives), HMAS Perth (353 lives) and HMAS Canberra (84 lives). The Parramatta (II) memorial was established in Queens Wharf Reserve in 1986 by the Naval Association of Australia (NSW sub-branch) and Parramatta Council to commemorate the loss of Parramatta (II).  Description  Part of the wreck of the former HMAS Parramatta in 2016 The wreck site of the former HMAS Parramatta (I) lies in shallow water within Cascade Gully in the Hawkesbury River, near its northern bank. With the bow and stern sections removed in the 1970s, the remainder of the wreck retains significant form. The centrally preserved section is retained to original main deck level with six strakes (runs) of external hull plating visible above the waterline, and two internal deck levels. All of the metal fabric shows evidence of extensive corrosion with the majority of fittings and fixtures (e.g. portholes) removed over the years. The internal spaces of the wreck are littered with miscellaneous plating, piping and introduced rubbish. The Parramatta (I) Stern memorial comprises the aft (stern) end of the former vessel, as removed from the shipwreck site. The stern was cut from the once intact hull by oxyacetylene torches. Originally mounted on a brick support structure, the memorial saw extensive restoration by Parramatta City Council in 2003‚Äì4. This included a conservation program to limit water ingress into the memorial, stabilise rust activity, and to replace damaged sections of external plating. Major damage had been witnessed to the external rudder and bottom section of hull. The stern was repainted to an original World War One colour scheme, whilst the memorials brick support was cement rendered and painted. Modern interpretative plaques were installed into the interior recess of the memorial. The Parramatta (I) Bow memorial is located on the Sydney Harbour foreshore of Garden Island Naval base. The striking sheer bow section retains a naval grey colour scheme and is set onto a low brick support base. The memorial has not seen recent conservation assessment. The Parramatta (II) Memorial is located in Queens Wharf Reserve, Parramatta beside the Parramatta River's southern bank and comprises a stone block (granite) with attached plaques, and four white-painted stockless anchors at each corner, within a black square fenced area. The memorial is situated 112 metres east of the Parramatta (I) Stern Memorial. = Condition = The former HMAS Parramatta (I) shipwreck, as at 15 July 2003, has retained significant integrity despite the removal of the bow and stern sections. This is testimony to the strength of the original design and construction materials used. Much of the all-steel hull, framing and decking shows signs of advanced corrosion however, due to its external location, and particularly due to the lower hull's partial burial in the mud substrate of the river and within the inter-tidal water zone. Such a setting increases the likelihood of more aggressive corrosion immediately above the nominal waterline. This is evidenced by increased metal pitting in this zone. With limited historic building plans and photographs of Parramatta (I), the archaeological remains hold the potential to document state-of-the- art destroyer design and construction pre World War One. The Parramatta (I) stern memorial has been the focus of extensive conservation works in 2003‚Äì4. This work has resulted in limiting water ingress into the structure, repairing visible rust and corrosion damage, and through repainting, providing a durable outer finish to prolong survival. The Parramatta (I) bow memorial appears structurally sound although minor corrosion activity is identified. The Royal Australian Navy maintains the structure which is included in its heritage collection and maintenance programs. The Parramatta (II) memorial does not include any historic fabric related to either the Parramatta (I) or (II) vessels. The monument essentially comprises a block of basalt, attached metal plaques and a metallic railing fence. The HMAS Parramatta (I) Historic Shipwreck retains moderate structural integrity. While the hull was reduced by the removal of the bow and stern sections for later dedication as public memorials, the central section of the original hull is retained to main deck level. Scattered within the remainder of the wreck site are sections of miscellaneous plating, piping, and degraded original fabric. = Modifications and dates = Shipwreck * 1910: HMAS Parramatta (I) was completed in 1910 and saw immediate service throughout the world during World War One. The vessel returned to Australia after the war and was finally placed in reserve untril decommissioned in 1929. * 1929: HMAS Parramatta (I) ended up in the Hawkesbury River as a proposed hulk for the New South Wales Prisons Department. Unknown stripping of the vessel's machinery and fittings occurred at this time. Parramatta (I) was sold soon after to George Rhodes of Cowan and used as a blue-metal storage barge. The hulk was sold again and finally used to store water for local residents in the Hawkesbury during the Depression. * 1934: Parramatta (I) blew ashore on a mud flat in Cascade Gully, adjacent to Milson Island, in the Hawkesbury River in 1934 and became a total wreck. The hull retained its form despite gradual deterioration. * 1972: In 1972, the Naval Historical Society of Australia began a project to recover the bow and stern for proposed memorials to commemorate the history and significance of the vessel and its later namesakes (Parramatta (II) and Parramatta (II), and Australian naval history generally. This involved the cutting off of both the bow and stern sections, leaving the remaining hull further exposed, particularly to the ingress of water and sand. Today the site retains significant structural integrity, although is encroached upon by mangroves. Parramatta II Memorial 1973: The memorial to HMAS Parramatta (II), sunk in combat in the Mediterranean in World War Two, originally comprised a metal plaque established in the grounds of the Parramatta Bowling Club in 1973. 1986: The present memorial at Queens Wharf Reserve was constructed in 1986 and re-dedicated at that time. An additional interpretative plaque was added in 1995. 1941: HMAS Parramatta (II) sunk by German U-boat off the coast of Libya (Tobruk), in the Mediterranean Sea.  Heritage listing  The HMAS Parramatta (I) Historic Shipwreck site is of State heritage significance as the only readily accessible survivor of the torpedo boat destroyers ordered in 1909 and built for the developing Commonwealth Naval Forces (CNF). The Parramatta (I) remains represent pre-Great War technology and materials for warship construction. Of principal significance is the vessel's status as the first completed and commissioned (1910) of the wholly Australian naval fleet ordered initially from British dockyards post federation. Parramatta (I) was a River Class Torpedo Boat Destroyer design, the last British type to accommodate an external rudder. Parramatta (I) had a successful military service during World War One, participating in the 1914 naval engagements in German New Guinea, successful tours in the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas, and toured the famous Gallipoli battlefields at war's end. The wreck site is unique in NSW for being located in three distinct places, following the removal of the bow and stern sections for public education and display in 1972. The historic wreck site, and both the stern and bow sections removed from the wreck, form the core of the current 2003 SHR listing. The Parramatta (II) Memorial is located in close proximity to the Parramatta (I) Stern Memorial within Queens Wharf Reserve, Parramatta. The memorial is the focus of annual naval commemorations to the 138 crew of the vessel lost in combat in 1941. HMAS Parramatta shipwreck and memorials was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 December 2006 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The wreck of the former HMAS Parramatta (I) is of State significance for its early associations with the establishment of wholly owned and administered Australian naval forces. A torpedo boat destroyer (TBD), Parramatta was the first of six built to serve as fast hunters of the British \\"River\\" Class\\" design, the last British warship designed with an external rudder system. Parramatta was the first of the Australian group built, in its case by Fairfield Shipbuilding & Engineering at Govan, Scotland. The vessel was launched on 9 February 1910 by Mrs Margot Asquith, wife of the British Prime Minister, who dedicated the vessel at \\"the First Born of the Commonwealth Navy\\". Parramatta was the first completed of the newly ordered fleet of twelve warships by the Commonwealth. It was also the first, with Yarra, to arrive in Australian waters. The wreck demonstrates the pattern of commissioning British-built vessels for the new Australian navy into the early twentieth century, and in the subsequent disposal of such vessels when obsolete. Being the first built and commissioned of the new Commonwealth Naval Forces (CNF), Parramatta signalled the departure from total British naval control of Australian waters. The new Australian owned and operated fleet was greeted with celebration by an enthusiastic nation when the formal entry of the fleet occurred at Sydney on 4 October 1913. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. HMAS Parramatta (I) is of State significance for its associations with the nationwide establishment of the Naval Historical Society of Australia, formed in 1970 as the Garden Island Naval Historical Society. The society's first project proposal that year was the removal of the bow and stern section of the Parramatta (I) wreck site, and was used to galvanize support for the formation of the society and to attract wide membership. This was a seminal period and resulted in the official establishment of the society under its current name with full Royal Australian Navy approval. The society today includes notable ex-military and serving members of the naval forces of Australia and is a key naval historical body nationally. The society received significant patronage in its early years from distinguished people within and without the service. These have included His Royal Highness, Prince Philip, who opened the bow memorial in 1986, the Admiral of the Fleet Earl Mountbatten of Burma KG, PC, CCB, GCSI, GCIE, GCVO, DSO, FRS who was provided with life membership in 1970, and Admiral Victor Smith KBE, CB, DSC, then Chairman of the Chief of Staffs (Defence), who opened the stern memorial in 1982. The Parramatta (II) memorial is the focal point for veteran remembrance services to the 138 crew lost when the vessel was torpedoed in action off Tobruk, North Africa, in World War Two. The memorial attracts significant patronage from veterans and associated family members, with RAN involvement each year. The vessel retains a historic association to Parramatta and Parramatta City Council due to the historic legacy of Parramatta (I), its associated memorials, and to the historic links of the City of Parramatta to all vessels and crew that bear its name. Parramatta (II)'s loss in 1941 stands as one of the most significant naval tragedies in RAN military and peacetime history. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The bow and stern memorials constructed from major elements of the Parramatta (I) shipwreck site demonstrate particular aesthetic values in their use of salvaged wreck materials. They are notably different to memorials erected to commemorate other defence personnel and events. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The social significance of the vessel is demonstrated by the recovery operations in 1972 and the volunteer efforts to have the bow and stern sections available for wide public visitation as public memorials to the vessel and the development of the nation's independent defence capability. In 1972, the Naval Historical Society of Australia began a project to recover the bow and stern for a memorial to the vessel and its later namesakes (Parramatta (2) and Parramatta (3), and Australian naval history generally. However, funding and other constraints delayed the project with the stern finally being mounted in Queens Wharf Reserve, Parramatta in 1981 and the bow at Garden Island in 1986. The Parramatta (II) memorial was re-dedicated nearby the stern memorial in 1986 and is a significant site of respect and remembrance to the Royal Australian Navy, veterans, and family of the 138 crew killed in the vessel's World War Two loss in action. A symbol of the community's esteem for the memorial and for the need to preserve key naval heritage remembrance sites, is the petition of signatories obtained by the Parramatta II Memorial sub-section of the Naval Association of Australia for its nomination to the State Heritage Register. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The former HMAS Parramatta (I) wreck site is rare as the most intact and only exposed example of the original six vessels built of this class. HMAS Swan lies submerged and partly buried by silt in dangerous water within the Hawkesbury but has been damaged by explosives. The limited remains of the former HMAS Warrego are thought to have partially survived underwater near Cockatoo Island, with only a small section of the bow saved and preserved in the Naval Historical Collection at Spectacle Island, Sydney. The bow and stern memorials, constructed from sections of the Parramatta (I) shipwreck are rare in New South Wales, being the only identified memorials, apart from the HMAS Sydney (1) mast and SMS Emden gun memorial, to incorporate significant historic fabric. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The former HMAS Parramatta (I) wreck site is the only accessible vessel that has survived from the first fleet units ordered from Great Britain for the newly formed Commonwealth Naval Forces (CNF) - later the proclaimed Royal Australian Navy. It is representative of the type of small naval attack vessel then built for the British Navy that saw active and useful service in World War One. It retains elements of naval design and construction employed immediately prior to the Great War. Both Parramatta (I) memorials are representative of a type of class of naval memorial that makes use of materials recovered from a wreck to convey a tangible association or connection with the actual vessel and its embodied history.

Together, these poems constitute one of the 17 sections of the poetry anthology which was published under the title of the Chuci (also known as the Songs of Chu or as the Songs of the South). Despite the \\"Nine\\" in the title (Jiu ge literally means Nine Songs), the number of these poetic pieces actually consists of eleven separate songs, or elegies.Murck 2000, 11 This set of verses seems to represent some shamanistic dramatic practices of the Yangzi River valley area (as well as a northern tradition or traditions) involving the invocation of divine beings and seeking their blessings by means of a process of courtship.Davis 1970, xlvii The poetry consists of lyrics written for performance as part of a religious drama, however the lack of stage directions or indications of who is supposed to be singing at any one time or whether some of the lines represent lines for a chorus makes an accurate reconstruction of how such a shamanic drama would actually have been performed quite uncertain; although, there are internal textual clues, for example indicating the use of spectacular costumes for the performers, and an extensive orchestra.Hawkes 1985, 95-96 Although not precisely dated, \\"Hymn to the Fallen\\" dates from the end of the late the Warring States period, ended 221 BCE, with possible revisions in the Han dynasty, particularly during the reign of Han Wudi, during 141 to 87 BCE . The poem has been translated into English by David Hawkes as \\"Hymn to the Fallen\\". \\"Guo shang\\" is a hymn to soldiers killed in war. Gu√≥ (Âúã) means the \\"state\\", \\"kingdom\\", or \\"nation\\". ShƒÅng (ÊÆ§) means to \\"die young\\". Put together, the title refers to those who meet death in the course of fighting for their country. David Hawkes describes it as \\"surely one of the most beautiful laments for fallen soldiers in any language\\".Hawkes 1985, 116-117 Meter The meter is a regular seven- character verse, with three characters separated by the exclamatory particle \\"ÂÖÆ\\" followed by three more characters, each composing a half line, for a total of nine double lines totaling 126 characters.(ÂúãÊÆ§https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E4%B9%9D%E6%AD%8C#ÂúãÊÆ§) Background The historical background of the \\"Hymn to the Fallen\\" poem involves the ancient type of warfare practiced in ancient China. Included are references to arms and weapons, ancient states or areas, and the mixed use of chariots in warfare. A good historical example of this type of contest is the \\"Battle of Yanling\\", which features similar characteristics and problems experienced by participants in this type of fighting, such as greatly elevated mortality rates for both horses and humans. As is generally the in the case of Chu ci poems, it is concerned with events or matters relating to Chu, whether considered as a political state or as or pertaining to the area in which that state was located. Thus \\"Hymn to the Fallen\\" refers to a battle (whether real or imaginary) involving Chu warriors, although the characteristic warfare described would similar to that of the early Han dynasty. Chu and the Warring States Map of Warring States, 260BCE, showing Chu (Ê•ö), having incorporated Wu (Âê≥), bordered by Qin (Áß¶) The state of Chu was a kingdom dating back to early 8th century BCE. During its existence there was frequent armed violence; indeed, the latter part of its existence is known for that reason as Warring States period (beginning early Fifth Century BCE). This was a period characterized by struggles between the different kingdoms for supremacy until their final political consolidation by Qin in 221 BCE. (Chu was annexed in 223 BCE.) During the Warring States era, warfare developed in ways characteristic to what is depicted in \\"Hymn to the Fallen\\". There was also often factional violence within the states, often related. The Confucian philosopher Xun Zi (Shun Kuang) comments on this in his early Third Century BCE book known eponymously as the Xunzi or Works of Xun Zi: > The soldiers of Chu were equipped with armour made of sharkskin and > rhinoceros hide hard as metal or stone, and pikes of Nanyang steel that > could sting a man like a wasp or scorpion. They were so light and mobile > that they seemed to move about like the wind. Yet at Chui-sha the Chu army > was all but destroyed and its commander Tang Mie [...] was killed. Zhuang > Jiao led a rising in the capital and the country split in several parts. > This was not because they lacked strong armour and sharp weapons but because > they did not know how to use them.Hawkes 1985, 122 n. to l.1 Weapons, armor, and equipment \\"Hymn to the Fallen\\" specifically mentions several types of weapon and other characteristics of early Chinese warfare and culture. Specific understanding of this type of warfare and the cultural background enhances specific understanding of the poem; this includes specific weapons, armor, vehicles, and methodology of war. =Ge= Head of ge (Êàà) from the Warring states period. Typically the wood pole did not survive. Nor did the tassels affixed to the slot seen here. One weapon specifically-mentioned in \\"Hymn to the Fallen\\" is the variously-translated ge (. (Note that the two Chinese words and characters for ge -- weapon and song -- are distinct.) Translations include dagger-axe, pike, halberd, and others (dagger-axe is descriptive, the others tend to be the names of European relatives. This long, polearm weapon generally consists of a metal blade or blades and sometimes a metal point hafted at the end of a long pole, generally of wood. Eventually these ge were mass-produced, the spear tip on the end became more common and the ji became commonly used (). The ge was known in China from earliest history through the time period when \\"Hymn to the Fallen\\" was written. Ge made in Wu (Âê≥Êàà) or produced from steel made there were especially renowned, and specifically mentioned in \\"Hymn to the Fallen\\". =Bow and Arrow/Bolt= Qin crossbow Another weapon which specified is the bow, which is a ranged weapon which launches a projectile, usually referred to as an arrow in the case of a long bow and as a quarrel or bolt in the case of a cross bow, in both cases possessed of a deadly metal tip. In either case, the relevance to the poem is the way in which these weapon is used in ancient Chinese warfare: shot by an archer from the ground or from chariots generally in large numbers, battles frequently began with massed archery as soon as the armies were in range of each other. Often shot ballistically, the arrows/bolts would come down from on high, accelerated by the force of gravity into a deadly rain from above. However, at close quarters the archer was no match for the wielder of the ge, so a typical battle would begin with volleys of arrows/bolts, followed by hand-to-hand fighting. Both the longbow and crossbow were known to the author of \\"Hymn to the Fallen\\" and the only specification made is to \\"Qin bows (Áß¶Âºì)\\". The state of Qin was noted for its bows. =Armor= Drawing of rhinoceros hide and buffalo hide armour (ÁäÄÁî≤) Rhinoceros hide armor (ÁäÄÁî≤) is specifically mentioned in \\"Hymn to the Fallen\\". Rhinoceroses in ancient China were relatively common at the time of the composition of \\"Hymn to the Fallen\\", and Chu is noted for historical use of rhino skin armor for war. \\"[t]he soldiers of Chu were equipped with armour made of sharkskin and rhinoceros hide as hard as metal or stone, and with pikes of Nanyang steel that could sting a man like a wasp or a scorpion\\".Hawkes 1985, 122 The lamellar armour favoured by Chu was generally constructed of many small pieces intricately sewn together, resulting in a type of armor providing a certain amount of defensive protection, while at the same time being reasonably light and flexible. =Chariots= Schematic of typical chariot (Ëªä) Chariot wheel hub/cap (ËΩÇ), China, Warring States period, 475-221 BC, bronze inlaid with silver and gold The horse and chariot were key components of the type of warfare described in this verse, and had been for a long time.Beckwith 2009, 43; according to which archeological evidence shows that in China the small scale use in war of the chariot began around 1200 BCE in the late Shang dynasty Chariots in ancient China were generally light, two-wheeled vehicles pulled by two to four horses (or ponies), yoked together by one or two poles, to which the outside horses were attached by traces. Typically, on the left side of the chariot rode the charioteer who controlled the horses, generally armed only with a short sword. Beside him would be one (or more) archers armed with bows and a short sword. The short swords were in case an enemy jumped on the chariot or the personnel were forced into melee combat; however, yet of such construction as they be not so bulky that they might interfere with main duties onboard. Typically, protecting the right side was a soldier armed with the ge, a lengthy and lethal hand weapon. In battle, the tactical aim for chariots was generally to avoid direct contact with the enemy, and instead inflict damage at a relatively safe distance, charging towards the enemy ranks, discharging a volley of arrows/bolts, and wheeling away to a safe distance. Then, repeat. If the chariots got stuck in mud, hemmed in, or the wheels damaged or otherwise disabled they were likely to be quite at a disadvantage if attacked by foot soldiers armed with ge, swords, axes, or other melee weapons, especially if the foot soldiers maintained disciplined formations. =Military organization= Military discipline was key component in the warfare depicted in \\"Hymn to the Fallen\\"; that is, the ordering of the army so as to be most effective in tactics and responsive to command. Coordination of chariot forces and infantry was generally critical to success. The chariots were vulnerable to infantry attack at close quarters and so generally would be provided with infantry support. Infantry was also vulnerable to chariots if they were able to maintain a distance allowing ranged attacks but avoiding melee, so generally chariot accompaniment was required. Communications, including rallying points and identifying forces was often done through the use of banners, sometimes adorned with feathers (jƒ´ng, Êóå), as is mentioned in \\"Hymn to the Fallen\\". Also mentioned is the use of musical instruments to lead on the troops and to coordinate their actions. The use of musical instruments to control movements of the army was an old practice. Attack (charge), regroup, retreat, and similar maneuvers could all be sounded. Spiritual and Religious Phenomena Various spiritual and religious cultural phenomena are encountered in the \\"Hymn to the Fallen\\" poem. This includes belief in an after life, with survival of soul or spirit beyond the death of the body and the presence of various supernal or earthly powers, particularly a Heavenly Lord (Tian) and a Martial Deity (Wu). =Vital Soul (Hunpo)= In ancient China, there was a belief that some part of a person would survive the death of the body, a belief continued and developed over time. There is some uncertainty in the beliefs around the time that the \\"Hymn to the Fallen\\" was written, in late Warring States/early Han dynasty. =Tian and Wu= In ancient China, there was a belief in supernal and earthly powers of deities and spirits. This includes a belief in Tian, a celestial deity with great influence on Earth and a belief in a spiritual being named Wu as a personified spirit of warfare, comparable to Ares or Mars.

The fallen horses block our wheels: they impede the yoke-horses!‚Äù They grasp their jade drum-sticks: they beat the sounding drums. Heaven decrees their fall: the dread Powers are angry.

It includes the jetty, boatshed, well, and all foreshore land associated with Mulholland's Farm. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 9 June 2000.  History  In October 1881, Carl Ludwig Sahl and John Nobbs purchased a 640-acre land grant in the vicinity of modern-day Green Point, and subdivided it as the Green Point Estate. They retained some of the land, however, including a waterfront section (Lot 1) in the south-west corner of the original grant, and amounted to area of 3 acres 6 roods 1/2 perch. In October 1890, Sahl and Nobbs successfully lobbied the government for rescission of the usual 100' high-water mark reservation between some of their land and Brisbane Water, allowing them to purchase the foreshore land. It was sold to Charles Thomas Sandon in November 1891, to Eliza Sophia Winton in July 1892, and to local farmer Herbert Henry Thompson in 1907. Thompson already owned the adjacent property, and his combined holdings formed what was to become a successful farming operation. He then sold the combined land to George James Mulholland in May 1909. Mulholland subsequently constructed a boat shed, wharf, well, road and water pipeline along the foreshore land, supporting both his farming interests on land and a successful oyster farming venture offshore. Mulholland's Farm was subdivided in 1961, and in 1975, the high-water reservation of 100' depth was resumed by Gosford City Council and dedicated, together with other areas on Brisbane Water, as a public reserve. This reduced the land area associated with the house to 3154m2, and divorced the wharf and boatshed from the same land title as the house. A sign on the wharf stating \\"oyster lease\\" remained on the wharf until the 1980s.  Description  The boatshed is a simple timber framed and weatherboard structure, with a skillion form roof. Located adjacent to the shed are the hardwood planks of the former wharf structure. The concrete piles of the wharf survive. Both of these items appear to be pre-World War II constructions as they appear in the aerial photograph of 1941. The boat shed has doors to its land and watersides, indicating is use for boats. In it there is a filer pump which is part of an integral irrigation system comprising well (at the foreshore) pipe to the holding tank, and a distribution pump under the house (electric billabong) of pre-World War II vintage.Clive Lucas Stapleton, 1999  Heritage listing  The jetty, boatshed, well and foreshore land was owned and managed as an integral part of Mulholland's Farm between 1891 and 1975. The boatshed and remnants of the hardwood framed jetty are a tangible association between the house and the use of brisbane Water as a means of either transport, and/or an economic activity such as oyster farming. Furthermore, its significance as the most intact surviving farm on the Brisbane Water (from the farm subdivision era of the 1880s to 1945) derives from the fact that it retains the physical and visual evidence of Mulholland's Farm's association with the waterway.

Lake George is in the far northwest corner of Indiana, part of the Chicago metropolitan area. It sits between Wolf Lake to the west and Lake Michigan to the east. Lake George has a north and south basin divided by the Lake George Trail, a greenway. Calumet College of St. Joseph sits on the eastern shore of the lake. Before development of the greater region, the area around Lake George was covered with wetlands, slow-moving rivers, and shallow lakes. In the 1900s, some of these areas were filled in with slag wastes from steel production and materials dredged from the Calumet River system. As a result, the lake has lost about half of its surface area and has become extremely shallow with a maximum depth of about . Studies in the 1990s demonstrated that phragmites and other non-native invasive plants had choked out native species in the lake. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources began a project in the 2010s to counteract the invasion of invasive plants and restore the larger Grand Calumet River area as a nesting and foraging habitat for birds. The restoration involves a combination of herbicide applications to kill the invasive species followed by re-seeding with native plants. In addition, working through the Hammond port Authority, the city has added beaches, hiking and biking trails, improved fishing and boating facilities, and other entertainment venues, in an attempt to make Hammond a tourist destination.

The siege was successful and the Almoravid garrison surrendered. The besieging force was under the overall command of King Alfonso VII. He was supported by forces from Navarre under their king, Catalonia under the count of Barcelona and Genoa, which provided most of the naval force. The city of Almer√≠a, known in Arabic as al-Mariyya, reached its zenith under the Almoravids in the latter half of the eleventh century and the first half of the twelfth. This period of commercial and cultural richness was cut short by the conquest of 1147. Large sections of the city were physically destroyed and most prominent residents emigrated to North Africa. Sources There are two major Latin narrative sources of the campaign of Almer√≠a: Caffaro di Rustico's De captione Almerie et Tortuose from the Genoese perspective and the anonymous Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris from the Castilian perspective. There is also a Latin epic poem, the Prefatio de Almaria, which is incomplete in its surviving form and mostly just a list of the names of participants. Important information can also be gleaned from the numerous Castilian diplomas issued by Alfonso VII during the progress of his army and the siege. Preparations Bernard Reilly estimates that Alfonso VII's army numbered about 5,000. The Prefatio and Alfonso's diplomas show fifteen magnates (noblemen of the highest rank) and nine prelates (archbishops and bishops) were part of the army. It is likely that each of these men was responsible for providing one squadron of heavy cavalry, which typically contained 40‚Äì60 horsemen, plus a squire and groom for each. To this must be added the infantry and the support personnel (drovers, carters, blacksmiths, cooks)‚Äîprobably a further 3,500 men. The Genoese contributed a fleet of 63 galleys and 163 other vessels under the command of the consuls Oberto Torre, Filippo di Platealonga, Balduino, Ansario Doria, Ingo Piso and Ansaldo Piso. For its help, Alfonso VII promised the city a third of all conquests, the right to commerce and exemption from tolls. Siege In the spring of 1147, an advance force of fifteen galleys under the consul Balduino arrived off Cabo de Gata expecting to rendezvous with Alfonso. Not finding Alfonso, Balduino waited with his fleet outside the harbour of Almer√≠a for a month before Count Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona arrived with one ship and fifty-three knights. Ansaldo Doria arrived at the same time with sixteen galleys. The Genoese‚ÄìCatalan force decided to make an initial assault before the arrival of the main army. Ramon Berenguer and his men went ashore while Balduino feigned a seaborne assault on the mosque. Ansaldo took one galley up the river Andarax to scout and to provide an advance warning of any relieving force. The rest of the fleet waited outside the river mouth. Expecting a surprise attack from the land, Almer√≠a sent out two scouts, but they failed to locate the count of Barcelona's troops. Balduino's initial assault met stiff resistance from a force of 1,040 men, according to Caffaro. The Genoese lost eight in the fighting. After the first clash, the fleet that had been waiting in the river mouth joined Balduino at the docks. According to Caffaro, the defenders lost 5,000 men in the ensuing battle and were forced to retreat. The ships were then beached to allow the unloading of the siege equipment‚Äîrams, towers and catapults. By the time Alfonso arrived with a force of 400 knights and 1,000 infantry, the Genoese had assembled their siege engines. They were strategically placed and, despite constant counterattacks by the defenders, managed to destroy of wall. In the fall, Alfonso VII opened negotiations with the defenders. He sent King Garc√≠a Ram√≠rez of Navarre and Count Ermengol VI of Urgell as his representatives. The city offered to pay 100,000 maraved√≠es and give hostages if Alfonso would abandon the siege (and his Genoese allies, who were not privy to the negotiations). The final attack on the city was spearheaded by the Genoese contingent, having received word that Alfonso VII was prepared to make peace. On 17 October, without a battle cry, twelve thousand Genoese attacked the city. The Catalans refused to join the attack, but Alfonso eventually sent his men into the battle. After three hours, the city was captured save for the citadel. According to Caffaro, 20,000 Muslims were killed and 10,000 women and children captured. Four days later (21 October), the citadel surrendered. The garrison paid 30 million maraved√≠es to spare their lives. Aftermath The Genoese left behind a garrison of 1,000 men. Almer√≠a was re-captured by the Almohads in 1157.

By age 19, he had joined the army but soon sought scholarships to study art. Unsuccessful, he emigrated to Paris, where he frequented the √âcole des Beaux-Arts as a student of the sculptors Thomas and Injalbert. Funding his study as a laborer and handyman, he encountered the painters Picasso, Matisse, and Modigliani; yet his style would remain more classic and academic. In 1909, he first exhibited with the Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais; he would continue exhibiting in this forum, including works such as The Poverty (1911); Victory of David and Napoleon on Horseback (1912); The Heroes of the Sea (1913); The Last Effort (1914); The Pain, Solitude, and Love Disarmed (1920); portraits (1923); a bust (1924); Faunesse enviree (1927); and La baccante (1930). In 1914, he traveled to London, but his studio failed and he returned to Paris, becoming a sketch artist during the war, drawing under the pseudonym Lemoine. In 1921, he traveled to United States, where he met some success, and returned to Europe, opening a studio again in London, where he also found success. He exhibited at the Fine Art Gallery a series of 34 bronze and marble statuary busts of prominent men including George Bernard Shaw and the Archbishop of Canterbury. He became much in demand for portraits and traveled through the continent. In 1930 he depicted the journalist Emilia Cardona, in Signora in Pelliccia di Lontra. Widowed two years later at the age of 32, Emilia married Francesco. That year he opened a studio in Rome. In 1933 he completed a Portrait of Pope Pius XI, displayed in the Vatican. In 1935 he completed a monument to Leonardo da Vinci for his tomb at the Ch√¢teau d'Amboise. He died in Washington, D.C., where he had traveled to create a portrait of President Franklin D.

Early life Philips was born to a Jewish family in Duisburg, Germany, the youngest of five children. Philips' father died while she was young, and by the early 1920s she was living at home to support her mother. Her parents died shortly after World War I, and Philips left Germany in 1935 to live in London, before travelling in 1958 to New Zealand to follow her brother Kurt Philips and his wife Trude, who opened Hamilton's first restaurant, Vienna Cafe. The restaurant was known for its potato salad, eel, goulash and good coffee. The family faced discrimination when World War II broke out, as they were classified as \\"enemy aliens\\" and required to report weekly to the police. Philips worked in the restaurant upon her arrival in New Zealand, and through waiting tables Philips became friends with Te Puea Herangi (Princess Te Puea). Career Philips took drawing classes at Hamilton's Technical School and the Workers' Educational Association, and then took summer school art courses at Ardmore Teachers' Training College. She also took classes at Auckland Art Gallery's summer school, where Colin McCahon mentored and taught her. Philips' works focused mostly on her visualisation of the Waikato landscape. Philips exhibited widely in New Zealand, including: * Contemporary New Zealand Painting and Sculpture 1962 at the Auckland Art Gallery (1962).

Plan 1 was designed for activation in the event of a war, while Plan 2 was designed for activation in the event of a peacetime exigency. The groundwork for Plan 1 and Plan 2 was jointly formulated by the Navy and the Coast Guard beginning in 1915, following the merger of the Revenue Cutter Service with the United States Life-Saving Service. These preparations were formalized with the classified document Mobilization of the Coast Guard when Required to Operate as a Part of the Navy, containing the procedures by which the combining of the two maritime services into a unified naval force would be accomplished. The plan was finalized in March 1917. While the mobilization plans generally envisaged the transfer of the whole of the Coast Guard to the Navy, some exceptions were prescribed. The United States Coast Guard Academy, for instance, would not be transferred to Navy control, nor would Coast Guard stations 276 and 305 (lifesaving stations located in Kentucky and Alaska, respectively). Mobilization Plan 1 was activated on April 6, 1917 ‚Äì following the United States declaration of war against Germany ‚Äì when the United States Navy communications center in Arlington, Virginia transmitted the activation phrase \\"Plan One, Acknowledge\\" to Coast Guard headquarters.

At the age of 19, she became a reporter at the Philadelphia Press and reported on labor conditions in Pennsylvania fabric mills and campaigned for the rights of children laborers. She traveled the world as a reporter, having been to Europe and Asia as well as the American West. After contracting Tuberculosis, she moved to Denver Colorado, studying law at the University of Denver and receiving her LL.B. summa cum laude in 1896. Her score for the Colorado Bar would stand as a record until 1941.  Time as a Lawyer  Mary was not only one of the first female members of the American Bar Association, but also the first female member of the Colorado Bar Association and the Denver Bar Association. She went on to specialize in probate law. She faced a great gender barrier as an early female lawyer, having been turned down twice before being admitted to practice in front of the U.S. District Court in Colorado. Mary was the first woman to try a case in front of the Colorado Supreme Court, the first woman admitted to the U.S. Supreme Court, and was the first woman to join the Denver Bar Association. Her contributions included redrafting Colorado probate statues, aiding in the development of the Small Guardianship Law, and most famously argued in Clayton v. Hallett, a case which established the law of charitable bequests in Colorado. She got an honorary doctorate of law from the University of Denver.  Death and Legacy  Mary died on October 18, 1951 in Denver, Colorado. She not only helped to pave the way for female lawyers who followed in her steps, but received numerous awards. She spent her life helping students with their education and left the bulk of her estate to establish a student loan fund at the University of Denver.

Before he was of grade-school age his parents moved to the adjacent town of Bradford, Vermont, where he spent much of his childhood. He attended school there and upon graduation entered Harvard Law School in 1846. Graduating in the class of 1849 with a Bachelor of Laws (L.L.B.), he moved to Holyoke, Massachusetts to open a practice and spent the entirety of his legal career operating out of that city. In the city's founding days in 1849, Pearsons was involved in local politics as a member of fourth estate, serving as the very first editorial writer for the Hampden Freeman, wherein his first editorial he described Holyoke, then known as Ireland Parish, as‚Äì \\"the infant giant of western Massachusetts, in the midst of a beautiful and fertile region noted far and wide for the industry of its inhabitants, its salubrious climate, and its enchanting scenery\\".Furcolo, Foster.

From 1987 to 1996 Ramsay was a professor at Immaculate Conception Seminary at Seton Hall University. Life From 1987 to 1996 Ramsay was a professor at Immaculate Conception Seminary (which serves the archdiocese of Newark). Ramsay was a member of the \\"voting faculty\\" that could express a formal opinion as to whether a student should be promoted to the next year. According to Ramsey, in the early 1990s, Theodore McCarrick, then Archbishop of Newark, removed Ramsay's voting prerogative because Ramsay was instrumental in the expulsion of one of the seminarians.Desmond, Joan. \\"Whistleblower Father Boniface Ramsey Reacts to Archbishop Vigan√≤‚Äôs Letter\\", National Catholic Register, August 28, 2018 In November 2000, Ramsey wrote the Apostolic Nuncio in Washington, D.C., Archbishop Gabriel Montalvo, regarding rumors of inappropriate conduct on the part of McCarrick's with seminarians. (As a Dominican, rather than a diocesan priest, Ramsay was not under McCarrick's immediate supervision.) Ramsay had heard reports that the Archbishop was in the practice of inviting five seminarians to his beach house, which only had five beds, and sharing a bed with one of the seminarians. \\" I never heard that McCarrick touched anyone\\", said Ramsay.Ramsay, Boniface. \\"The Case of Theodore McCarrick\\", Commonweal, February 16, 2019 He said that \\"McCarrick‚Äôs behavior was viewed by many as ‚Äúodd‚Äù or even ‚Äúcrazy,‚Äù but not necessarily immoral...The term, ‚Äòsexual harassment,‚Äô‚Äù had not gained currency, and the seminary administrators didn‚Äôt know how to react\\".Desmond, Joan. \\"Fr.

Ramsay believes that between 2006 and 2015, there were those in the Vatican attempting to build a case against McCarrick. In 2004 he joined the Archdiocese of New York. A further letter to Cardinal Sean O'Malley of Boston, written in June 2015, was never passed on to O'Malley. When the news broke in the summer of 2018 that McCarrick's behavior with his seminarians was known to church authorities, not only in the Vatican but apparently also by many American bishops and others, serious questions were raised as to how he could have been named archbishop of Washington (2000) and then been elevated to the cardinalate (2001). Ramsey is the author or translator of several books on the Fathers of the Church, notably Beginning to Read the Fathers, and of numerous articles on various theological topics. He is the general editor of The Works of Saint Augustine: A Translation for the 21st Century. Ramsey currently serves as the administrator of the parish of Saint Joseph-Yorkville in Manhattan.

It was organised by a coalition of 260 non-profit organisations at Pune's Shaniwarwada Fort, and had approximately 35,000 people in attendance. The program consisted of a number of cultural performances, speeches and slogans. \\"Elgaar\\" means loud invitation or loud declaration.  Background  The event was organised at the Shaniwarwada Fort in Pune on the eve of the bicentennial anniversary of the Battle of Bhima Koregaon. The Shaniwarwada Fort was the seat of power of the Peshwas, the de facto rulers of the Maratha Empire. The Peshwas belonged to the 'Chitpavan Brahmin' community. In the Battle of Bhima Koregaon, a regiment of Mahar Dalits, serving in the British Army had defeated the Peshwa's army. This victory is held as very important by the Mahar Dalits, who see it as a victory over the Brahmin Peshwas. Organising the Parishad at the Shaniwarwada Fort was thus seen as a symbol of Dalit assertion. However Anand Teltumbde has argued that painting the Battle of Bhima Koregaon as the battle of Mahars against their caste oppression in Peshwa rule, is a \\"pure myth\\". The Myth of Bhima Koregaon Reinforces the Identities It Seeks to Transcend, Anand Teltumbde, The Wire, 02/JAN/2018 He states that the majority of those died in the battle (27 out of 49) were not Mahars, and the Peshwa army retreated, fearing the arrival of a larger British force. Thus he regards portrayal of the battle as Mahars‚Äô against the Peshwas‚Äô Brahmanic rule as misleading. Before the event, two marches were organised through several districts of Maharashtra and culminating in Pune with artists, activists, theatre performers and musicians among others. These marches held public meetings to rally support for Dalit victims of atrocities and collect donations for the Elgar Parishad.  Event  The event began at 2 PM under six tents pitched in front of the Shaniwarwada Fort. After the tents filled up at 2.30, police refused to let more people in, fearing stampede. The stage seated the organisers and speakers of the event, including Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani, Dalit activist Radhika Vemula, Adivasi activist Soni Sori, Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar, Bhim Army President Vinay Ratan Singh, retired Bombay High Court Justice BG Kholse-Patil, and student leader Umar Khalid. A number of cultural performances with anti-caste themes were staged. Shahirs performed songs in tribute of Tukaram, Mahatma Jyotirao Phule, Shivaji and Shahu. A dance troupe performed acrobatics and hip-hop groups also performed. Before Radhika Vemula made her speech, she was invited to smash a stack of pots signifying the varna system in a symbolic gesture of annihilating caste.  Aftermath  On 1 January 2018, violence broke out at Bhima Koregaon, where lakhs of Dalits had converged to commemorate the battle. One person was killed, and three others injured. In the months following the event, a number of people present at the event were arrested under laws such as the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). This included Surendra Gadling, Rona Wilson, Mahesh Raut, Sudhir Dhawale, Shoma Sen and Stan Swamy. Pune Police alleged that the event was sponsored by Maoists. An FIR was filed against Jignesh Mevani for promoting enmity on grounds of religion. It was alleged by the Pune Police that the event was organised by members of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist). They said that it instigated violence at Bhima Koregaon. However, Justices BG Kolse-Patil and PB Sawant refuted their claims. The Justices said that it was the two of them who were the main organisers and sole funders of the event, and that they had held a similar event against communalism and Hindutva in October 2015 at the same venue.

The theory of desecularization is reactionary to the older theory known as The Secularization Thesis, which posits a gradual decline of religion to a point of extinction. In the last few decades, scholars have pointed to continued church attendance in Western countries, the rise in religious fundamentalism, and the prevalence of religious conflict as evidence of the continued relevance of religion in the modern world. A former proponent of the earlier secularization thesis, Peter L. Berger, has now expressed his support for the newer theory, stating that the world today \\"is as furiously religious as it ever was\\".  Background  Max Weber Many scholars of the 19th century posited that the world was undergoing a process of secularization. Individuals such as Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, Karl Marx, and Sigmund Freud believed that this trend would continue until religion became essentially insignificant in the public sphere. At the least it was believed that religion would become \\"privatized.\\" The secularization thesis was underscored by rationalism, an argument born from the Enlightenment Era. According to Norris and Inglehart, the traditional view of 19th century secularization can be divided into two perspectives (1) 'Demand-Side theories' and (2) 'Supply Side Theories.' = Demand Side theories = Demand Side theories of secularization insist that the phenomenon occurs \\"bottom up,\\" such that as a whole, the general population will become increasingly rational independent of any influence from the secular government or religious leadership body. Examples of Demand Side theories can be found in the accounts given by Weber and Durkheim. Whilst Weber rarely used the term \\"secularization,\\" he is generally given credit for alluding to the idea that religion was gradually losing its prominence in society. According to Weber, the world was initially seen as unified, with religion, politics and economics all existing on the same social plane. Thus the term \\"religion\\" was not necessary nor was it widely used because religion was included in all aspects of life. According to Weber, when different aspects of society such as politics and economics were severed from religion, the demise of religion in the public sphere became inevitable. = 'Supply Side' theories = Supply Side theories of secularization argue that the demand for religion exerted by the general population remains constant. This means that any change in the religious landscape occurs as a result of the manipulation of the \\"supply market\\" by religious leaders. The construction therefore views the phenomenon as 'top down' development. Steve Bruce argues that the \\"supply\\" of religion is greatest when there is a \\"free\\" and \\"competitive\\" market for \\"providers\\" of religion, as in most Western nations, as opposed to states where one religion predominates.  In sociology literature  = Terminology and definition = The term \\"Desecularization\\" appears in the title of Peter L. Berger's seminal work The Desecularization of the World: Resurgent Religion and World Politics. According to Karpov, the term has received little analysis in the field of sociology, however this section will refer to at least one significant development in the term's definition since its first use. Berger explains that the assumption that the modern world is secular has been ‚Äúfalsified.\\" In another article online, he acknowledges that his original use of the term simply referred to ‚Äúthe continuing strong presence of religion in the modern world.‚Äù Karpov has since developed the definition of the term, which Berger subsequently affirmed. Karpov defines the term as referring to a phenomenon that is counter-secularization and thus is reactionary to a prior period of secularism. He states that Desecularization can be defined as \\"the growth of religion's societal influence,\\" but only if it develops in response to \\"previously secularizing trends.\\" Therefore, Karpov's development of the term essentially limited the definition to instances where religion was actively re-established as opposed to simply a state of continuity. = Methodological concerns = Some scholars raise the issue of evidence. Karpov for example, mounts a discussion on the different analytics that can be used in providing evidence for desecularizing trends. He divides these analytics into two different types of evidence, (1) societal-level data or \\"macro-data\\" and (2) non-societal data, named in Karpov's article as ‚Äúmega data.\\" Macro-data deals with evidence obtained from individual societal ‚Äúunits.‚Äù These units cannot exclusively be referred to as countries or nation-states because sometimes they can represent smaller sections, i.e. racial groups. Other data (\\"mega- data\\") is less objective according to Karpov, because it often refers to trends in more abstract terms such as in ‚Äúmodern society‚Äù or civilization generally. Essentially, mega-date data attempts to identify patterns on a more cosmic or global scale, whereas macro data can be very specific to nations, cities and racial groups such as church attendance and census results. Because the term Desecularization has been used to describe a global trend, the question raised by Karpov is whether macro-data analytics can be considered as valid when they indicate specific trends in ‚Äúsocietal units,‚Äù rather than global trends. There are two primary critiques of macro analytics: (1) that it leads to ‚Äúmethodological nationalism,‚Äù causing a fixation on nation-states rather than broader civilization. The next argument is that of (2) temporal limitation ‚Äì the concern that because our current concept of ‚Äúsociety‚Äù is relatively recent, a focus on societal-level analytics (macro data) restricts sociological analysis to modernity and no other time period. According to Karpov this poses an issue when considering religions with ancient historical trajectories. Karpov also cites several implications that result from using ‚Äúmega‚Äù analytics, overall suggesting that it can allow for an understanding of desecularization that is rooted both in its historical trajectory, and its presence in modernity. He concludes that whilst ‚Äúmacro‚Äù data can limit the analysis of desecularization, it can be compounded and used in conjunction with ‚Äúmega‚Äù analytics to give sociologists a clear overall picture of a religious trend.  Examples  = Percentage of the irreligious in the world is in decline = According to Pew Research's article The Future of World Religions: Population Growth Projections, 2010-2050: \\"Atheists, agnostics and other people who do not affiliate with any religion ‚Äì though increasing in countries such as the United States and France ‚Äì will make up a declining share of the world's total population.\\"The Future of World Religions: Population Growth Projections, 2010-2050, Pew research Professor Eric Kaufmann, whose academic specialization is how demography affects irreligion/religion/politics, wrote in 2012: Phil Zuckerman Sociologist Phil Zuckerman's global studies on atheism have indicated that global atheism may be in decline due to irreligious countries having the lowest birth rates in the world and religious countries having higher birth rates in general.Zuckerman, Phil (2006). \\"3 - Atheism: Contemporary Numbers and Patterns\\".

They argue that the religious landscape in the 20th and 21st centuries only appear to be fading in significance because traditional routes of religious worship are being replaced by new wave religiosity. Finally, they claim that populations in the modern world are moving away from traditional or established denominations such as Catholicism and participating in religious affairs in a more individualized sense. For example, Finke and Stark argue that the colonial period in America was not as religious as once thought, using church attendance as an indicator of religiosity. Instead they suggest that the onset of globalization and religious pluralism is responsible for a higher proportion of church involvement when compared with the monolithic, traditional histories of the mainstream churches. = Orthodox Christianity in Russia = Christopher Marsh explains the secularization in Russia before the collapse of the Soviet Union, stating that the regime was underscored by ‚Äúscientific atheism,‚Äù which was ultimately manifested in the persecution of religious clergy in Russia throughout the duration of the regime. This secularization was indicated in the surveys conducted between 1981 and 1990, that showed a sharp decline in religious and supernatural beliefs, particularly in young people. In Lambert's study, 12 variables were used in the survey to denote religiosity, which included propensity to pray, belief in an afterlife etc. Furthermore, in a study conducted by Evans and Northmore- Ball, 80 percent of individuals claimed to be Russian Orthodox in 2007, with only half of the population doing the same in 1993, immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Both Berger and Karpov use this evidence to bolster their accounts of Desecularization in the present. = Evangelicalism in Russia = A large number of missionaries operating presently operating in Russia are from Protestant denominations. According to a survey conducted at the end of 2013, 2% of surveyed Russians identify as Protestants or another branch of Christianity. = Religious resurgence in France = Catholic Church attendance has seen a rise in recent years, especially in the larger cities. France has Europe's second largest Immigrant Muslim population. = Desecularization in Germany = On March 17, 2014, the news website Deutsche Well reported that evangelical Christianity has doubled in Germany in the last 10 years. Germany has the largest immigrant community of Muslims in Europe. = Desecularization in East Asia = Zeng discusses the increasingly religious paradigm within civil service entrance examinations - tests which are intended to sort applicants for civil service and \\"justify social hierarchy,\\" as well as academic examinations for school and university. The study uses ethnographic evidence and interviews with civil servants to provide evidence for this phenomenon. Zeng highlights the systemic use of emas - prayer symbols that are used in Shintoism and other East-Asian religions, to invoke positive outcomes in entrance exams. According to Zeng, these are sufficiently prevalent in some parts of Japan such that individual universities such as Keio University in Tokyo, offer their own prayer templates for prospective students. Zeng also found that in two separate non- academic shrines in Japan, more than half of the emas were directed toward such exams. The number of Chinese Christians has increased significantly; from 4 million before 1949 to 67 million in 2010. Christianity has grown in South Korea, from 2.0% in 1945 to 29.3% in 2010.  Responses to the desecularization thesis  The conflicting secularization and desecularization theses and their application to modernity have occasioned much debate. Some 20th and 21st century scholars have argued that the Secularization Thesis is not nullified and that the term 'desecularization' can only be applied in isolated, societal circumstances. Bryan R. Wilson has suggested that commercialism continues to undermine religion in relation to religious bodies such as the Church, and non-religious bodies such as the family unit and economic institutions. Critics of the contemporary theory of desecularization such as Wilson still concede that religiosity is not trending towards extinction because of continued religious piety across the globe. However, they do argue that its relationship with political and economic institutions is indeed declining because of the increased pressure from the scientific and technological spheres. They argue that this proposition is both plausible in modernity and compatible with 19th century conceptions of Secularization that foreshadowed religion's \\"privatization,\\" if not extinction. Hence, critics of Desecularization suggest that whilst it can account for some instances of continued and revised religiosity, it does not adequately describe the relationship between religion and privatized inquisitions and governments. Mouzelis suggests that this case is \\"strong,\\" however it only refers to \\"inter-institutional\\" secularization (i.e. the relationship between religion and other institutions). He offers the opinion that the argument against Desecularization becomes weakened when one considers \\"developments within the religious sphere proper,\\" or what he calls \\"intra-institutional\\" secularization. Similarly, Martin uses evidence of increased Pentecostalism in both developed and non-developed countries (particularly the U.S) to bolster the argument for Desecularization. Bruce offers a rebuttal to this point, claiming that The United States is simply slower to become secular due to certain structural predispositions, namely the steady rate of migration. Bruce also suggests that the dramatic changes to religiosity in the modern world such as increased liberalism, represent evidence of its decline. According to Bruce, this trajectory could have begun with the transition from medieval Catholicism to the Protestant reformation under Martin Luther. Mouzelis describes this as a potentially weak argument in that most proponents of Desecularization would simply view events such as the Reformation as a religious development or the birth of a new type of Christianity, which could have the potential to further globalize its consumption. Among these dramatic changes in religion, according to Bruce, is the deterioration of supernatural elements of religiosity, leaving behind a belief system that its more morally grounded a development which represents a \\"retardation\\" of religion. Again, Mouzelis takes a more objective stance, suggesting that this development can be seen as both evidence for and against Desecularization because such movements can still capitulate the globalization of certain faiths. Overall, critics of desecularization tend to argue that whilst religious enthusiasm is not necessarily in decline, the significance of religion in the public sphere, and as a limb of political and economic institutions, is indeed continually diminished by modernity. This can be described as the \\"privatization\\" of religion. However, desecularization proponents tend to suggest that these aforementioned changes represent religious developments rather than religious declines, and therefore cannot be used as evidence of general secularizing trend.

Murray (13 October 1837 - 3 July 1910) was a senior officer in both the paramilitary Native Police and civilian Queensland Police Force. Early life G.P.M. Murray was born on 13 October 1837 at his family's Georgefield estate near Langholm in southern Scotland. His grandfather was Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Murray of the East India Company who married a Malayali woman from Kerala while in India. The offspring of this marriage, including George's father James Murray, were collectively dubbed the \\"Black Murrays\\" on account of their darker skin colour. G.P.M. Murray arrived in New South Wales to live with his parents and siblings in the year 1843. George's father was a pastoralist, his family residing at the Warrawang property at Mt Lambie near Bathurst. In May 1854 he moved into the northern areas of the colony near the town of Maryborough. He assisted his brother-in-law, H. C. Corfield, in forming Stanton Harcourt, a sheep station taken up by Mr. Corfield in the Wide Bay-Burnett district. Native Police career G.P.M. Murray was appointed to the Native Police in December 1857 as a 2nd Lieutenant. His older brother, John Murray, had been in this paramilitary force since 1852. George was posted to the Dawson River region to assist in the reprisals following the Hornet Bank massacre where he maintained an effective control without exercising unnecessary severity. In 1860, he was the officer-in-charge of the barracks at Robinson's Creek near Taroom. In 1861 he was transferred to the Rockhampton barracks and became a senior Lieutenant in the force. In October of that year, the Cullin-la-ringo massacre occurred near the Nogoa River and Murray mobilised his section to that region. He arrived with his troops at the police camp at Rainworth on 26 October. His force \\"shot a large number of aboriginals and recovered firearms and other property which had been stolen from Cullin- la-Ringo\\". Native Police, Rockhampton, 1864 (G.P.M. Murray standing second from left) With the reorganisation of the Queensland Police Service in 1864 under Commissioner David Thompson Seymour, Murray became more involved in the local administration of the Native Police rather than the more brutal field work. After Lieutenant Brown of the Native Police had assisted in the capture of the famous bushranger, Frank Gardiner, to the north of Rockhampton, Murray was selected as a magistrate in Gardiner's initial trial. In 1865, Murray was publicly condemned by social identity Gideon Lang for his sanctioning of a sequence of massacres of Aboriginal people conducted by sub-Inspector Otto Paschen and his troopers in the Expedition Range. These \\"dispersals\\" were in response to the killing of Native Police officer Cecil Hill by Aboriginals near Duaringa. In spite of these accusations, Murray was promoted in 1866 to Chief Inspector of the Police for the Northern Districts of Queensland, responsible for both civilian and Native Police forces in these regions. The following year, Murray headed an investigation into complaints against sub- Inspector Myrtil Aubin of the Native Police for the killing of eight Aboriginals in the township of Morinish. Murray controversially concluded that it was clearly the duty of Aubin and his troopers to kill these people (which included old men and children) and \\"it is very much to be regretted that they did not do so quietly\\". In 1866, Murray was posted to Springsure and retained his title of Chief Inspector until 1872. Police Magistrate In 1872, G.P.M. Murray became Police Magistrate and Gold Warden for Clermont and in 1877, Murray became Police Magistrate in Warwick and in 1882 transferred to Toowoomba. After a brief period in Cooktown, he relocated to Brisbane where he became senior state magistrate in 1898. Murray retired from public service in 1904 and moved to the Brisbane suburb of Wilston where he died in 1910. Murray Street in Wilston is named after him.

Written by industry veteran Mark Farmer, it identified key failings in the British construction industry. Farmer stated that research and development was almost non-existent, productivity was low and cost inflation high. He also noted a lack of skilled workers required to deliver the government's infrastructure and housebuilding targets. Farmer made ten key recommendations for the industry to follow which included reform of the Construction Industry Training Board, greater use of off-site construction techniques, greater promotion of the industry to school children, reform of tax and planning processes and for implementation of a 0.5% tax on clients in projects that do not follow the recommendations. The government later agreed to implement all of the recommendations except for the additional taxation.  Report  The report was written by Mark Farmer, the founding director and CEO of Cast Consultancy and an expert with 25 years' experience in the construction industry. It had been commissioned through the UK Construction Leadership Council at the request of the departments for Communities and Local Government (CLG) and for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). The government were keen to reform the industry which had a reputation for poor productivity, poor reputation as a good career with young people, a reliance on casual labour, poor investment in training and a fragmented supply chain. Repeated government reviews since the early 1990s has done little to transform it. Farmer produced an 80-page report in October 2016 and subtitled it \\"Modernise or Die - Time to decide the industry's future.\\" Farmer stated that he had found that the arrangements for training in the industry were dysfunctional and that investment in research and development was almost non-existent. As a result the sector's productivity was low, levels of innovation were poor and cost inflation was high. He also found a shortage of skilled workers exacerbated by a larger number of people leaving the industry each year than were joining it. On the latter issue Farmer stated that the available workforce would decrease by 25% over the following ten years, a scenario that would be significantly worsened by the impact of Brexit. This shortage could jeopardise the industry's ability to meet the infrastructure and housebuilding targets set by the government. He was particularly critical of the housebuilding side of the industry. Farmer's review made ten key recommendations: #For the Construction Leadership Council (CLC) to co-ordinate the implementation of the recommendations and to itself be reformed to better represent the make-up of the industry. #For the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) to be fundamentally reformed and a review undertaken of its current training levy to make it more efficient. #For contractors, consultants, clients and the government to work within the framework provided by the CLC to improve relationships and collaboration across the supply chain and to increase investment in research and development. #For contractors, consultants, clients and the government to work within the framework provided by the CLC to investigate innovative solutions to the housing shortage, for example through the sharing of off-site construction facilities with small and medium enterprises. #For the CITB to change its grant funding process to focus on those skills relevant to the future of the industry and for industry bodies and professional institutions to become more involved in the way talent is developed. #For the CITB or a new body to take charge of improving the public image of the industry particularly through school outreach programmes aimed at those aged 11 and over. #For the government to take a more interventionist stance on the industry with new policies on education, planning, tax and employment. For the government to implement reform of the way section 106 agreements are made to streamline the planning process. For the treasury to reform the Construction Industry Scheme to disincentivise false declarations of self employment. #For the government to encourage use of pre-fabricated components in construction (off-site construction methods) by providing tax incentives for research and development funding, by encouraging housing authorities to specify such techniques and by introducing advantages in the planning system for schemes using these methods. #For the government to implement a new housebuilding pipeline, similar to the national infrastructure pipeline already in place, to give private sector companies greater visibility of the predicted future demand for housing. #For the government to introduce a 0.5% tax of the total project value on every client that does not implement the other recommendations. For this tax to be introduced within the next five years and for all money raised to be reinvested into technological development. Farmer warned that the British government should not simply cherry pick the ideas that it liked or that were easiest to implement but should take the review as a whole. He wanted change to be driven primarily by private sector clients - who make up around 75% by value of all construction work commissioned in the UK. Farmer said at the time of his report's release that \\"we're entering a phase in construction where productivity's going to make or break the industry\\" and that \\"the only way we're going to [deliver the government's infrastructure and commercial targets] is by getting more productive\\". He was keen to see the industry make greater use of robotics, machine learning and automated planning decisions by use of digital design.  Impact  The official government response to the report was issued in July 2017 and written by Baron Prior, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the BEIS; Alok Sharma, Housing and Planning minister at the CLG and Anne Milton, Minister of State for Skills and Apprenticeships at the Department for Education and Minister for Women. They agreed to implement all of Farmer's recommendations except the last - the 0.5% project value tax - saying they feared it would reduce the number of construction projects carried out. They committed to a reform of the CITB and its levy and stated that there was support for greater use of off-site manufacturing in an existing housing white paper. Farmer commented that he was happy that the government had agreed to implement the vast majority of his recommendations and that it was working to bring about a \\"modern and fit for purpose construction industry\\". The review was described in the press at the time of its release as a \\"damning report\\" that warned that the industry faced \\"inexorable decline\\" unless it reforms. Other commentators stated that to help contractors to achieve the recommendations there would need to be more major, long-term projects and larger frameworks brought forward to provide certainty that the contractor would be able to achieve a return on their investment. In July 2018 the Farmer Review was cited as an example of the reforms needed for the construction industry in New Zealand. The CLC's July 2018 report Procuring for Value built on the Farmer Review and advocated serious reform for the procurement and tender process with a shift away from the \\"lowest cost bid\\" mentality towards an approach that takes into account quality and risk.

She was treasurer and a financial supporter of the Women's Freedom League which was a non-violent and anti-war suffrage group. Life Knight was born in 1869. Her father left her a substantial inheritance. After studying at Newnham College, Cambridge and then training at the London School of Medicine for Women she became a general practitioner from 1904. She joined the British Medical Association in 1907. A member of the Women's Freedom League, she was imprisoned in 1908 after attempting to interview Prime Minister H. H. Asquith at 10 Downing Street. There she wrote ‚ÄúSocial and Sanitary Conditions of Prison Life‚Äù. She served further prison sentences for her part in the Women's Tax Resistance League. Knight was a source of funds for the Women's Freedom League. She took over as treasurer from Constance Tite in 1912 where she brought more calm to the financial situation. Before she was appointed the league had suffered from occasions when it had to appeal to its members for loans. Knight devoted a lot of her time and introduced new fundraising schemes for the league although finances were also helped by large donations by an \\"anonymous\\" person. It is suspected that this person was Knight. Knight was one of the leaseholders of their premises in Holborn together with Charlotte Despard, Octavia Lewin and Alice and Edward Green. Within the building was the Minerva Cafe. This cafe should not be confused with the Minerva Club which was at 28a Brunswick Square and was paid for by Alice Green and Knight. The club was used for meetings but also acted as a hostel for suffrage activists from 1920. Knight died in 1933 following a car accident in Brighton.

It stars Anna Mouglalis, Niels Schneider, Eric Godon, Sissi Duparc, Andr√© Wilms, Michel Fau. The leading lady of Grand Guignol Theatre in Paris, Paula Max (Anna Mouglalis), is known for being murdered in every show on stage. Someone starts to notice that there's a link between these murders and a series of murders in real-life. The film is the first Belgian movie made for Netflix. It was shot in a 1.85 : 1 screen ratio through Spherical lens. It is loosely inspired by the work and life of actual French actress . Filmed over the course of a month and a half on an estimated budget of ‚Ç¨4,500,000, the film was released straight to Netflix after a premiere at the Brussels International Fantasy Film Festival in April 2018.  Plot  In the early 1930s, Paula Maxa is one of the leading actresses at the Grand Guignol Theatre in Paris. Maxa is self- defined as the \\"most assassinated woman in the world\\" having become famous for being violently murdered on stage more than 10,000 times. The theater director at the Grand Guignol is known for his gruesome stories and realistic gory special effects that often leave audience members shocked and disgusted. Journalist \\"Jean\\" from Le Petit Journal is tasked with writing a critique of Maxa's performances. He arrives at the theater one night and seeks Maxa after her performance. On the way to her dressing room, he is given a bouquet of flowers by one of her costars to deliver to Maxa, apparently on behalf of one of her admirers. When he arrives in her dressing room, Maxa notices the flowers and asks him to throw them away. The two are intrigued by one another, both noting they are not what either expected of a typical journalist or actress. After Maxa leaves for her next performance, Jean begins to look around her dressing room, and notices the note attached to the flowers he brought her, which expresses her admirers love for her performances on stage, notably her deaths, and how they cannot wait to murder her in real life. Jean reads that the note is from a J. After Jean leaves, an unknown man is seen entering Paula's dressing room, and stealing the postcard on her mirror. The next morning, Paula awakes with a scream from a nightmare in which a man wearing a mask and using a cane has followed her to a caf√© and killed her. She then has a vision of a girl in her bathtub, playing with dolls. The girl looks visibly deceased, with pale skin and blue lips. Paula takes medication, and the girl disappears. Jean is seen next at work with a stab wound on his hip. When a coworker tells Jean to have it checked by a doctor, Jean ignores him. He goes to see his boss, who asks him how his story is coming along. Although Jean wants to focus his story on the people of the theater, his boss reveals that he has been sent to investigate the link between numerous murders that have occurred in town recently and those portrayed on stage. He believes killers have been drawing inspiration from the fictitious murders for their real-life killings. Later that day, Jean goes to see Paula and asks her on a date. Paula arrives at work the next day and continues to have visions of the same girl from the bathtub, who is now on a beach, calling out to her by the name Marie-Ther√®se. Paula receives a package that night containing the new dress she is to wear for her performance, with a note that reads \\"This is the end, I am going to kill you one final time!\\" from the same sender. Her date with Jean arrives and she is visibly distraught. At the same time, the unknown man from her dressing room is seen there again, this time smelling her perfume and trying on her wigs and makeup. The special effects director Paul finds the man there and asks him to leave. The man explains that he and Paul have a deal in which he delivers him dead bodies to use for the special effects in his plays, and in return he is allowed to admire Paula. He explains that he has come to finally kill her. After their date, Paula and Jean go back to her apartment. She asks him how he got the wound on his hip, and he explains that he was caught in an affair with a married woman, and her husband delivered the stab wound to him when he caught them in the bathroom. Now that he has told her his secret, he asks her what secrets she has been keeping from him. Paula reveals that her sister Aimee ran away from home when she was younger to become an actress, and they would meet in secret as to not alert their parents of her whereabouts. She tells him that during this time she began courting with a man named Jean, who had a limp and used a cane, due to a case of polio when he was younger. One day, Jean offered to take her and her sister to the beach. When they arrived at the dunes, he became violent and tried to rape Paula. As she tried to fight him, he beat her unconscious, with the last thing she remembers being him turning to rape her sister Aimee. When she awoke, Aimee's throat was slit and the man was gone. Paula reveals that she blames herself for not being able to save her sister or catch her killer, as she explains the man allegedly committed suicide before the police could arrest him. She tells Jean that she still hears the click of his cane when she is walking home at night, as though he is there. The two kiss and it is assumed that Jean spends the night at Paula's apartment. A woman named Violette is seen at a bar, flirting with the same man from Paula's dressing room, in hopes of having sex. The man accepts her advances and the two go back to his apartment. Once there, the man tries to kill her and Violette desperately tries to escape. The man slices her throat and Violette dies. The special effects director, Paul, is seen the next morning reluctantly picking up Violette's body from the man. At Le Petit Journal, Jean's coworker tells him that Marie-Therese Beau, who is best known under her stage name Paula Maxa, was raped by a man named Jean De Lancry, who also killed her sister. Jean remembers a fan of Paula's that he met the first at the theater, named Eugene De Lancry, and connects him to the murders and the threats that Paula has received. He tells his boss that he is finished his story and uncovered the identity of the man behind the murders, but in exchange, wishes for three months salary, and two tickets to Los Angeles. Jean then rushes to the theater in an attempt to save Paula, but is confronted by the theater director Andre, who tells him that no one can save Paula, as she is his property and the property of the theater, revealing that those working in the theater are complicit in the murders. Jean is forced out into a cab by the jealous husband who swore to kill him in revenge, and he watches as Paula enters the theater, unknowingly to her death. Paula finds Paul, who has created a special effects piece for her, that will make it appear as though her throat has been sliced for tonight's appearance. During the performance, the real Jean De Lancry steps in just as Paula is to be murdered on scene, and slices her throat with a real knife. The audience at first erupts in applause, but later realize it is real blood that has spattered onto them and begin to panic. Before the paramedics find Paula's body, Paul switches the body of dead Violette with \\"supposedly dead\\" Paula's. He is arrested for the murder of Paula Maxa, and the theater closes. Paula, alive and well, is seen at the cemetery where her tomb lies with the body of Violette inside. Still at grips with visions, she calls out for Jean in between the tombs, to join her in a car. He appears to her only, pale and smiling, obviously dead. Paula leaves in the car driven by Paul. Jean De Lancry now roams the streets missing Paula, who he believes to have finally killed, and continues to murder women who resemble the actress.

When he received the script, Ribi√®re was intrigued by the character of Paula, who is based on real-life French actress Paula Maxa. Ribi√®re also expressed his excitement to bring the arrival of color cinema and the first American horror films to screen. Ribi√®re began looking for ways to create a French film to cinema through his work on his last project, Alex de la Iglesia, in which a majority of Spanish actors were cast for an authentically Spanish film. He sought out Netflix due to their success as a \\"new wave in film\\" by bringing modern stories to large audiences, and the autonomy they give to creators to tell their stories as they choose.https://cineuropa.org/fr/interview/352178/ = Casting = The film cast mostly Belgian actors for the film, of which most had backgrounds in theater and dramatic arts. Anna Mouglalis was specifically chosen for the role because of her deep voice and appearance, which Ribi√®re said emulated the French Star Paula Maxa perfectly and helped bring the story to life. = Filming = The Most Assassinated Woman in the World was filmed over a one-month period in 2017. Most of the scenes were shot in Li√®ge, Belgium. The film was notably praised for casting multiple Belgian actors as main characters.  Release  The film was released by Netflix internationally and by Fontana in Belgium. Fontana, in partnership with Wallimage funded the project through a tax shelter, a government-approved tax incentive designed to encourage the production of audiovisual works in Belgium. The budget for the film is estimated to be ‚Ç¨4,500,000. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 83% based on six reviews.

It is positioned on the crest of the North Cascades Range, and is set at the northern end of the Ptarmigan Traverse. Hurry-up Peak is situated southeast of Cascade Pass on the shared border of North Cascades National Park and Glacier Peak Wilderness. The nearest higher peak is Spider Mountain, to the south, with Magic Mountain to the north, and Trapper Mountain to the east. Ess Mountain and S Mountain are variant names for Hurry-up Peak. The S Glacier rests on the eastern flank of the peak and meltwater from it drains into Trapper Lake. Precipitation runoff on the east side the mountain drains into tributaries of the Stehekin River, while precipitation drains into the Cascade River from the west side. Climate Hurry-up Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

In May 2018, Bayliss led a multidisciplinary expedition to scale the sheer walls of Mount Lico and begin the study of its unique habitat. Although it had been considered unlikely that humans would have entered the mountain's forest prior to this expedition, evidence of some limited human visitation was discovered in the form of several pots which had been placed, possibly for religious reasons, at the source of a stream on the mountain top.

She was the target of a wide scale investigation in Kiev during the 1980s.  Biography  Tamara Maslenko was born in a large family as one of six children, in which her parents always told her that material security is the main thing in life. Although forensic psychiatric examination recognized Ivanyutina as sane, she was noted as self-centered, vindictive and resentful. During the investigations into the poisonings, it turned out that Ivanyutina had been convicted of speculation, and had been employed by fake labor in her school. Chemistry teacher Viktor Stadnik, who suffered from Ivanyutina's actions, noted such traits of her character as \\"perseverance and arrogance\\", as well as rudeness and lack of discipline.  Murders  Between March 17 and 18, 1987, several pupils and employees of School #16 in the Podilskyi District in Kiev were hospitalized with signs of food poisoning. Two children - Sergei Panibrat and Andrei Kuzmenko - and two adults died almost immediately, while the remaining 9 people were in intensive care. Doctors initially suspected influenza or an intestinal infection, but some timer later, the hair began to fall out from the victims, which is not typical for such diseases. Poisoning was suspected, and a criminal investigation and an investigative team was established. The investigators, after interviewing the survivors, found out that they all felt unwell by having lunch the day before in the school cafeteria, after eating kasha and liver. When the question arose if there was quality control in the school canteen, it was found that a dietitian named Natalia Kukharenko (according to other sources - Kukarenko) had died two weeks before the events, according to official data - from a heart disease. However, the circumstances of Kukharenko's death caused doubts in the investigators, and due to this her body was exhumed. As a result of corresponding studies, traces of thallium were found in corpse tissues. After that, searches were carried out for all persons who have access to the kitchen, including in the house Tamara Ivanyutina lived, who worked as a dishwasher in the dining room of School N#16. During the search, Ivanyutina found some \\"small but very heavy jar\\" that interested operatives and investigators, which was given for examination. A laboratory study showed that the can contained \\"Clerici solution\\" - a highly toxic solution based on thallium used in some branches of geology. Ivanyutina was arrested and initially wrote a confession, confessing to the poisoning in the school canteen on March 16, 1987. The reason for the crime, according to Ivanyutina, was that the sixth graders who dined in the dining room refused to set up tables and chairs, and \\"she decided to punish them\\". However, she later stated that the confessions were made up from investigators who pressured her, and refused to give further testimony.  Investigation  Further investigation of the \\"Ivanyutina-Maslenko-Matzobory case\\" showed that Ivanyutina and her family (sister and parents) used thallium for poisoning for 11 years (since 1976); and did not poison as a mercenary goal, but simply cause of personal dislikes. The family members purchased the substance from a friend who worked at the geological institute, explaining to her that the poison was for killing rats. The acquaintance admitted that for 15 years she had not less than nine times given Ivanyutina, her sister and parents a portion of the substance. At the beginning of her criminal activities, Ivanyutina poisoned her first husband to get his apartment. After his death, she married a second time, but then poisoned her father-in-law and mother-in-law (died at intervals of two days), later poisoning her second husband in small portions (the purpose was to take possession of her husband parents' house with a plot of land). In September 1986, Ivanyutina got a job as a dishwasher for the school. According to investigators, she needed this work in order to gain access to food and food waste, since she kept a large farm with pigs and chickens. During her time in the dining room, Ivanyutina poisoned (in addition to the previous poisonings) the school party organizer Ekaterina Arsentyevna Scherban (died) and the chemistry teacher (survived) who prevented her from stealing food from the canteen, and two first and fifth grade students (both survived), who had asked her for the remnants of cutlets for their pets. The investigation proved that Tamara's elder sister, Nina Matzobory, using the same solution, had poisoned her husband and taken possession of their Kiev apartment. Numerous poisonings were committed by their parents as well: in particular, they killed a neighbor in a communal apartment and a cousin, who made remarks about them. While detained, Maria Maslenko explained her life position to her cellmates: \\"To achieve what you want, you do not need to write complaints, but to treat everybody as friends. But for especially harmful ones, just add poison to food\\". The geography of the criminal activities of the family was not limited to Ukraine; it was proven that some of the crimes committed by them in the RSFSR; in particular, her father Anton, while in Tula, poisoned his cousin by mixing poison in her moonshine. Also, members of the family also poisoned neighbors' pets.  Trial and sentence  45-year-old Tamara Ivanyutina, her older sister Nina Matzobory, as well as their parents - Anton Mitrofanovich and Maria Fedorovna Maslenko, appeared before the court on charges of committing numerous poisonings, including fatalities. The investigators and the court found that the family for 11, in selfish interests, and also personal hostility, committed numerous murders and attempted murders to kill various persons by poisoning them. According to the current deputy chairman of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, S.M. Vinokurov, who worked during the investigation as a senior investigator for particularly important cases in the city prosecutor's office in Kiev, proving that this was the largest case of thallium poisonings fixed in the USSR. In total, 40 cases of poisonings committed by the family were proven, 13 of which were fatal. At the same time, the largest number of poisonings (9) and assassination attempts (20) was committed personally by Tamara Ivanyutina. The trial lasted about a year, Ivanyutina did not admit her guilt and refused to apologise to the victims' families. All defendants were found guilty of murder and attempted assassination committed through poisoning.  Execution  Ivanyutina was sentenced to death and executed. Her accomplices were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment: Nina was sentenced to 15 years (her further fate is unknown) and their parents to 10 and 13 years, both dying in custody. During the investigation, Ivanyutina admitted that her dream was to buy a GAZ car. She also tried to bribe an investigator, promising him \\"a lot of gold\\". Refusing to admit her guilt, she explained at her trial that she did not have \\"a good upbringing\\". This unusual case was one of only three confirmed instances of a woman executed in the post-Stalin Soviet Union - the others were the 1979 execution of Antonina Makarova for her activities on the WWII Eastern Front, and the 1983 execution of Bertha Borodkin for embezzlement and bribery. Ivanyutina's case is still included in Ukraine's training materials for criminal procedures.

A 44-minute four-part episode, it is counted as the 13th to 16th episodes of the series' tenth season and as the 280th to 283rd episodes of the series overall. The episode first aired on September 3, 2018 on Cartoon Network. The series follows the adventures of Finn the Human (voiced by Jeremy Shada) and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake the Dog (voiced by John DiMaggio), who has magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In the special, the duo must help their friend Princess Bubblegum battle Gumbald, her vengeful creation. When the antagonists realize that violent conflict is unnecessary, they team up to keep the malevolent deity GOLB from destroying the Land of Ooo. The episode is named after the opening line of the series' ending theme, \\"The Island Song\\"; former crew members Ghostshrimp and Rebecca Sugar returned for the episode. \\"Come Along with Me\\" was watched by 0.92 million viewers during its premiere, and was acclaimed by critics, who praised its emotional weight, scale, writing, animation, and message, as well as the conclusion of the show's storylines, themes, and character arcs; most called it a perfect ending to the series. It was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program, a first for the series which, due to its usually shorter episode length, previously competed for Short Form Animated Program. Plot A thousand years in the future, a cat-like being named Shermy and his friend Beth‚Äîa descendant of Jake and Lady Rainicorn‚Äîdiscover Finn's robotic arm in the ground. Wanting to know its origin, they seek out the \\"King of Ooo\\", who is actually BMO. BMO recognizes the arm and proceeds to relate to Shermy and Beth the story of the \\"Great Gum War\\" and of how the world almost ended. In the series' present, Finn, Jake, and Bubblegum are preparing to go to war with Gumbald. Finn asks to parley with Gumbald, and they go to meet him and Fern. Jake activates a vial of \\"Nightmare Juice\\", incapacitating the five, who awaken in a nightmare world. Bubblegum and Gumbald are forced to experience each other's misery, with Bubblegum as a regular Candy Person and Gumbald as the Candy Kingdom's unhappy ruler. Finn helps Fern kill the Grass Demon in his psyche, freeing Fern from its negative influence but causing him to slowly disintegrate over the course of the episode. When they awaken, Bubblegum offers peace to Gumbald, but Aunt Lolly reveals his concealed \\"dum-dum juice\\", reverting him to a Candy Person. Lolly agrees to peace in Gumbald's stead, and Bubblegum declares \\"two Candy Kingdoms\\". Everyone is about to leave when GOLB appears. Ice King recognizes the deity, having studied it as Simon Petrikov. Normal Man sends Ice King to talk to Betty, who is communicating with GOLB, but Betty shouts at Ice King that she is trying to save him. GOLB consumes her and Ice King along with Finn when he tries to intervene, causing Finn's robotic arm to be chomped off. Using some of Gumbald's soldiers and one of Princess Bubblegum's guardians, GOLB attacks by raising two horrendous creatures. Bubblegum and her allies fight the creatures, but they are too powerful, with one destroying Finn and Jake's treehouse and nearly crushing Bubblegum. Marceline sees this and smashes the creature in a rage, but Bubblegum recovers and the two embrace and kiss. Jake is despondent at the loss of his home, but BMO sings to him in order to calm him. The harmony of BMO's song weakens GOLB, whose power is derived from chaos; Bubblegum encourages everyone to sing along, further weakening GOLB. In GOLB's stomach, Ice King is digested to his prior form as Simon, and Betty is returned to her normal state. She confesses that she summoned GOLB to save him from the ice crown. Meanwhile, Finn resigns himself to death as the walls close in, but BMO's song opens a hole leading outside, through which he and Simon escape. Betty stays behind and uses the crown to merge with GOLB, thereby saving Simon. As the merged being departs from Ooo, the crown falls onto Gunter, who wishes to be like Ice King and becomes a duplicate of him. Before Fern dies, he asks Finn and Jake to plant him at the treehouse, leaving them a seed resembling a hilt. Finn and Jake do so, sprouting a tree with a sword (The Finn Sword) embedded in the highest branch. Shermy and Beth ask what happened afterward, and BMO replies that everyone \\"kept on living their lives\\". In a flashback, Finn and Jake discuss how powerful music can be, and the Music Hole sings a new song it has been working on: Come Along With Me. As Music Hole sings, a montage shows a series of epilogues for all the characters, including Jake's son T.V. opening up his own detective agency similar to his grandparents, Gunther/Ice King marrying Turtle Princess, Simon going to Prismo's Time Room to wish Betty back, Bubblegum and Marceline cuddling on the sofa in Marceline's house, and the humans (including Finn's mother) returning to Ooo and greeting Finn and Jake by the beach side. After leaving, Shermy and Beth decide to find the tree that Fern sprouted, which is now gigantic. Shermy pulls the sword out and holds it high with Beth at his feet, assuming a pose similar to Finn and Jake in the series' title sequence. Production =Background= During the last seasons of Adventure Time, there was talk at Cartoon Network about concluding the series. Olivia Olson, who provided the voice of Marceline, said that since this discussion wore on for a while \\"the ending of the show was getting stretched and stretched and stretched\\". Chief content officer Rob Sorcher told the Los Angeles Times of the network's decision to end the series, saying: > Adventure Time was playing less and less on Cartoon Network, yet we were > moving towards a large volume of episodes. And I really began thinking \\"[The > end] can't come quickly as a sudden company decision, it needs to be a > conversation over a period of time.\\" And it did also strike me that if we > don't wind this up soon, we're going to have a generation of fans graduate > through the [television] demo[graphic that Cartoon Network targets] and we > won't have completed a thought for them. Consequently, on September 29, 2016, Cartoon Network confirmed that the series would conclude after its tenth season. =Development= Former storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar returned to write the song \\"Time Adventure\\". The special was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich, Steve Wolfhard, Seo Kim, Somvilay Xayaphone, Hanna K. Nystr√∂m, Aleks Sennwald, and Sam Alden, and Graham Falk. The story was developed by Herpich, Wolfhard, Ashly Burch, showrunner Adam Muto, head writer Kent Osborne, Jack Pendarvis, Julia Pott, and series creator Pendleton Ward. Former head background designer Ghostshrimp returned after having officially left the series during the fourth season. According to Osborne, Cartoon Network provided the writers with \\"an opportunity to spend a lot of time thinking about the finale\\" before production ended. In an interview with TV Guide, Muto explained that the show's writers used many of the episodes preceding the finale to conclude minor character story arcs \\"so we wouldn't have to cram too much in at the very end here.\\" This allowed the finale itself to be \\"less dense\\" by simply \\"hitting the big [beats] and then finding vignettes for all the characters ... so we could get snapshots of where they could end up.\\" Princess Bubblegum and Marceline kiss in one scene and are shown developing a romantic relationship in the special's epilogue. Muto said that the relationship was \\"an ongoing conversation... It certainly wasn‚Äôt in the show‚Äôs original pitch. It was a relationship that evolved over time.\\" The outline of the episode merely called for the two characters to \\"have a moment\\"; Nystr√∂m, being responsible for the scene, was given creative control as to the nature of the \\"moment\\". Muto noted, \\"When Hanna boarded that, there was a little note in the margin that said 'Come on!' with a big exclamation point. That was the only note. I can‚Äôt argue with that.\\" According to Pendarvis, storyline writing for the series ended in mid-November 2016, with the last storyline meeting being held on November 21. A tweet by Osborne revealed that the series' final script was pitched to storyboarders, with Alden and Nystr√∂m in attendance, on November 28. This episode was then pitched to the show's producers during the third week of December 2016. Voice recording for the episode ended on January 31, 2017 as confirmed by a number of cast members, including Maria Bamford and Andy Milonakis. Like miniseries Stakes, Islands, and Elements, \\"Come Along with Me\\" features a unique title sequence. The sequence was animated specifically for the episode by Masaaki Yuasa's company Science Saru and storyboarded by Wolfhard. =Music= Former storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar returned to compose the song \\"Time Adventure\\", which BMO sings to Jake in order to calm him. Sugar said of the song: > I wanted to write about how even if something ends, it continues to exist in > the past, nothing ever really goes away, you only feel like it does because > our mind has to process information one moment at a time in order for us to > function as humans. I'm so nostalgic for the time that I spent working on > Adventure Time and I find it comforting to think that I still exist in that > office with Adam [Muto], working on those stories. I would be so happy to > come to work and brainstorm with him and sit down and draw on paper and > pitch these stories with Post-its tacked up to the wall, just like they did > in the 1930s with the stick and the song and the dance, the most traditional > way of doing cartoons. When Sugar debuted the song at the 2018 San Diego Comic-Con, she joked that she wrote it \\"Because she can't stay away [from Adventure Time].\\" DiMaggio said that \\"The last day we recorded we had to do the final song that Rebecca Sugar wrote. I was a wreck when I first had to sing [... it was] like, 'Thank you, Rebecca Sugar, for your beautiful music.'\\" Willow Smith guest stars in the special, providing the voice of Beth. She also recorded a cover version of the show's opening theme for the episode. Smith, a fan of the series, previously wrote the song \\"Marceline\\" based on the character for her 2015 debut album, Ardipithecus. Reception The final moment of the series (bottom image) depicts two new characters, a thousand years in the future, mirroring the final pose of Finn and Jake in the show's opening (top); the ending was acclaimed by critics for its thematic implications. In its initial airing, \\"Come Along with Me\\" was viewed by 0.92 million viewers and scored a 0.25 Nielsen rating in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. The special was the twenty-fifth most-watched cable program on the day of its airing. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club gave the special an \\"A\\" letter rating, saying that it was \\"a celebration of what makes [the series] so special\\". Eric Thurm of Polygon wrote, \\"By focusing on this payoff‚Äîyears of communicating that what's important isn't the adventure itself, but the people you're with and the feeling it gives you‚ÄîAdventure Time put itself in a position to open up the future of Ooo to all of those other moods, other tones, other perspectives...\\" Daniel Schindel of IGN gave the episode a 10 out of 10, saying \\"[it] easily ranks with the best of Adventure Times episodes, but more importantly, it acts as a perfect capper for the series. It‚Äôs a thrilling exclamation point, an intriguing question mark, and a poignant, quiet period all at once.\\" Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an A rating and the series overall an A+, titling his review \\"One of the greatest TV shows ever had a soulful, mind-expanding conclusion\\". Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave \\"Come Along with Me\\" a B+ rating, calling it \\"a 45-minute assemblage of showdowns and confrontations designed to bring together every facet of its fantastical universe [that] salutes the best and worst of the Adventure Time journey\\". Kohn praised Bubblegum and Marceline's relationship, writing: \\"It's unfortunate that Adventure Time has to play catch-up with these characters so late in the game, but it nevertheless illustrates the extent to which the show has pushed beyond the conservative boundaries of mainstream entertainment\\". Dylan Hysen of Overly Animated called the episode \\"one of the best series finales in television history\\" and \\"beyond what I could have imagined for its conclusion\\", because it managed to \\"conclude so many aspects of an entire series ... in such a satisfying way\\". Hysen wrote of the ending that \\"[T]he vision of the entire ending depicted is just poetic and I think thematically resonant for the entire series\\". Dave Trumbore of Collider.com wrote that the finale \\"is the kind of finale you always hope for with animated series\\" and was \\"perfectly handled... both in keeping with the style the show has become known for while also delivering a satisfying conclusion to the mythology that's been a driving force behind the fandom\\". Trumbore applauded the open- ended nature of the ending and its emotional value, concluding: \\"'Come Along with Me' is expertly crafted and worth watching again and again in years to come, which is just what you‚Äôd expect from Adventure Time\\". In 2019, the episode was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program at the 71st Emmy Awards Ceremony, but lost to The Simpsonss \\"Mad About the Toy\\".

The union was founded in 1858, as the Harwood Branch of the East Lancashire Power Loom Weavers' Association, the association being the early name of the North East Lancashire Amalgamated Weavers' Association, or \\"First Amalgamation\\". Initially, it met in secrecy, in a delph, and its members were locked out, but thanks a donation of ¬£846 from the Blackburn Weavers' Friendly Society, it survived. By 1863 it was operating on a firmer footing, and affiliated in its own right, as the Great Harwood and Billington Power Loom Weavers' Association, covering not only Harwood, but also Billington, Rishton, Whalley and York. The Rishton Weavers' Association split away from the Harwood union in 1878. In 1884, the Amalgamated Weavers' Association was formed, and the union was a founder member, although it remained active in the First Amalgamation until 1900. By then, it had a membership of 4,123, roughly evenly split between men and women. Although membership dropped to only 3,800 in 1910, it then grew again, peaking at 5,382 in 1920. From the 1930s, the cotton industry in Lancashire began to decline, and the union lost members. This was partially offset in 1932, when the Sabden Weavers' Association merged in, and in 1962 remaining members of the dissolved Clayton Weavers' Association. Despite this, by 1964, membership was down to 1,080. The following year, the Rishton Weavers' Association finally rejoined. At some date after this, the Harwood union appears to have merged into the Blackburn and District Weavers', Winders' and Warpers' Association. General Secretaries :F. Nuttall :1900s: W.

Background The book is a collection of Holt's previous 25 essays on such diverse themes as science, philosophy, the nature of time, eugenics, quantum physics, string theory, relativity, the future of the universe, and the foundation of mathematics; Holt also explores the works of such scientists as Alan Turing, Benoit Mandelbrot, Emmy Noether, and others. Reception Parul Sehgal of The New York Times stated \\"In these pieces, plucked from the last 20 years, Holt takes on infinity and the infinitesimal, the illusion of time, the birth of eugenics, the so-called new atheism, smartphones and distraction. It is an elegant history of recent ideas. There are a few historical correctives ‚Äî he dismantles the notion that Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, was the first computer programmer. But he generally prefers to perch in the middle of a muddle ‚Äî say, the string theory wars ‚Äî and hear evidence from both sides without rushing to adjudication. The essays orbit around three chief concerns: How do we conceive of the world (metaphysics), how do we know what we know (epistemology) and how do we conduct ourselves (ethics)\\".

It was released on March 10, 1919. Plot Hugh Overton has been falsely convicted of the murder of Matthew Latrone and sent to prison. In order to clear his name, he escapes and heads back to the scene of the crime, traveling under the name of Philip Eaton. While on the train he runs into Basil Santoine, a blind attorney who he knows has the evidence to prove his innocence. Latrone has also learned of Overton's trip and has sent his henchman, Donald Avery, to dispose of Eaton. Unfortunately, Avery mistakes Santoine for Eaton and attempts to kill him, but simply leaves him unconscious. When he awakes, Santoine suspects Eaton, due to his voice, who he had heard earlier in the evening, and which he remembered as he was one of the witnesses at Overton's trial. Santoine invite him back to his home, in order to figure out what his role is in everything. While under Santoine's roof, Eaton/Overton falls in love with Harriet, Basil's daughter, who refers to her as his \\"eyes\\", hence she is the \\"blind man's eyes\\". Overton knows that Santoine has evidence in his safe which will prove his innocence. Latrone, who everyone thinks is dead, also knows this. Both men attempt to break into Santoine's safe on the same night. Overton and Latrone struggle, but Latrone is shot and killed by Avery, who had come as backup to his employer. The evidence comes to light, and Overton is declared innocent, after which he and Harriet become a couple. Cast * Bert Lytell as Hugh Overton, aka Philip D.

The first scenes of the picture were filmed at a newly constructed courtroom set on the Metro lot. It was revealed in mid-January that William Ince would direct the film, and Naomi Childers would be the female lead opposite Lytell. It was reported that by January 25 the film was approximately half-way completed. Some of the interiors had been filmed in a Pullman car located on the Metro lot. The Pullman car was specially built on the Metro lot, in their new large studio, and was built to standard Pullman specifications. Later Metro chartered a special train which traveled over 110 miles outside Los Angeles, the train consisted of an engine, a Pullman, and an obvservation car. Several scenes were shot inside the train, but many exterior shots were also filmed. In early February it was reported that other actors attached to the project included Joseph Kilgour, Frank Currier, Richard Morris, Morris Foster, Gertrude Claire, and Mignon Anderson. By the end of April, filming on the picture was almost completed, and a release date of March 10 was announced. The production was completed by March 1. Reception Exhibitors Herald gave the picture a positive review. They felt that the film had a unique twist in its plot, and the only downside they saw to the film was the unrelenting suspense. They felt the cast as a whole did a good job, and highlighted the performances of Lytell, Currier, and Childers. Moving Picture World also gave the film a positive review, calling it a \\"strong mystery story\\", and calling Bert Lytell's performance \\"excellent\\". They also applauded Ince's direction, as well as Childer's performance. Picture-Play Magazine gave Lytell's performance high marks, saying that his characterization \\"is appealing from the very outset and which grows more appealing with each successive scene.

Accessed 29 August 2018.  Origins and development  It is thought that the iatrosophia genre arose in Byzantine hospitals, as compendia of recipes and therapeutic advice. The earliest known examples date from perhaps as early as the tenth century CE, but they survive in large numbers only from the fifteenth century onwards. After the fall of Byzantium, the iatrosophist tradition was maintained by Greek Orthodox monasteries and in secular, Greek- speaking parts of the Ottoman Empire into the early twentieth century. The texts drew on earlier Greek and Latin medical writing by Hippocratic writers such as Dioscorides and Galen, and, more importantly, later Byzantine authors (writing around the fourth to seventh centuries CE) such as Oribasius, Aetios of Amida, Alexander of Tralles and Paulus Aegineta. From the tenth century, influence from Arabic medicine (itself previously influenced by Greek medical writing) is also possible. Yet it is also clear that writers in this genre continually updated and adapted their texts on the basis of new information and experience.Andreas Lardos, Jos√© Prieto-Garcia, and Michael Heinrich, 'Resins and Gums in Historical _Iatrosophia_ Texts from Cyprus: A Botanical and Medico-pharmacological Approach', Frontiers in Pharmacology (1 July 2011), .  Modern research  Although nineteenth- and twentieth-century historians of medicine viewed iatrosophia texts as corrupt and degraded forms of more prestigious Classical medicine, recent work has emphasised that in their historical context they were intellectually valid works. Some researchers have even argued that some of the recipes in iatrosophia texts reflect clinically effective pharmocology.Andreas Lardos, Jos√© Prieto-Garcia, and Michael Heinrich, 'Resins and Gums in Historical _Iatrosophia_ Texts from Cyprus: A Botanical and Medico-pharmacological Approach', Frontiers in Pharmacology (1 July 2011), . Few texts in this genre have so far been edited or translated, surviving only in manuscript form. One survey of 700 Ottoman-era Greek medical manuscripts found that 45% were iatrosophia.Andreas Lardos, Jos√© Prieto- Garcia, and Michael Heinrich, 'Resins and Gums in Historical _Iatrosophia_ Texts from Cyprus: A Botanical and Medico-pharmacological Approach', Frontiers in Pharmacology (1 July 2011), .

Both were later sentenced to life imprisonment. The two men are considered the first spree killers in the history of the post-communist Czech Republic. Interestingly, three of these killings were committed just as the death penalty was abolished in the country on May 2, 1990.  Lives before the murders  Josef Kott was born in Rakovn√≠k. He worked as a professional soldier, later working for the Federal Interior Ministry. This is where his troubles began. He returned to the army, gained the rank of lieutenant, but also started stealing, losing his rank soon afterwards. Michael Kut√≠lek was born in Prague. As early as pre-school age, he played the piano and tennis. He was intelligent, but also robbed his classmates, later being diagnosed as a polymorphic psychopath. Kott and Kut√≠lek met in 1988 at the Minsk Prison. Kott promised Kut√≠lek that he would show him how to make money through murder. Both men left prison in 1990 on the basis of amnesties by President V√°clav Havel - Kut√≠lek being released on January 6, and Kott on March 1. Krimiseri√°l: Dva krut√≠ ces≈•√°ci s vra≈ædou - Chrudimsk√Ω den√≠k  Murders  On the night of May 2, 1990, both arrived in N√Ω≈ôany in a Tatra 613 limousine. Disguised as police officers, they visited a guard named Frantisek Korbel, claiming that they wanted to perform a routine check on his weapon. When he handed them the weapon and they tried to seize it on the basis of a document controversy, he accused them of not being real police officers. So Kott shot him in the head. A witness described the two men: one in civilian and the other in a public security uniform. Kott and Kut√≠lek left after the murder towards Zbiroh, where they noticed two 16-year- old trackers named Dita Dubsk√° and Sylvia Landov√°. They took them to a remote place where they tied their hands behind their backs and murdered them. Kut√≠lek admitted that both were murdered in a \\"satanic\\" ritual, in which more than 57 knives had to be used. On May 3, Kott and Kut√≠lek drove to Prague, where they shot and robbed a taxi driver. Then, at a bar called \\"The Three Barrels\\" in Ka≈ôez, they shot a British truck driver. The man survived, and identified the attackers. Kott and Kut√≠lek were soon detained.Kott a Kut√≠lek, ≈°ance na svobodu  Trial  Kott never admitted his guilt. Kut√≠lek claimed that at the time of their capture, the highest possible punishment was 25 years, in addition, trying to confuse the court experts with Kott. The request failed, and both men were sentenced to life in 1995. In 2006, Kut√≠lek claimed he was the sole perpetrator and that Kott had nothing to do with the murders. The court dismissed his proposal, with no new evidence to re-establish the case.Vrahov√© Kott a Kut√≠lek s ≈æ√°dost√≠ neuspƒõli In 2008, Kut√≠lek confessed to a fifth murder he committed in the spring 1990, without Kott.

He was an academic at Lincoln College (now Lincoln University) for over 25 years, and served as its acting principal from 1984 to 1985. Early life, family, and education Born in Upper Silesia (at that time part of Germany, now in Poland) on 17 January 1921, Langer grew up in Berlin where he moved with his mother and two siblings after the death of his father, a judge, when Reinhart was aged three years. In 1939, Langer fled to England with his sister. He worked as a veterinary assistant in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, for a year, before spending the remainder of World War II working on a mixed cropping dairy farm. Langer won a scholarship to the University of Durham, and began studying agricultural science there in late 1945. After graduating Bachelor of Science with honours, he continued on to doctoral studies, completing his PhD in 1951. He was then appointed to a research position at the Grassland Research Institute (GRI), where he had spent time as a research assistant during his university studies. It was at GRI that Langer met his future wife, Hilary Joan Wilton, a biometrician, and they wed in September 1951. The couple went on to have three children. Academic career In late 1958, Langer was appointed to the faculty of Lincoln College, near Christchurch, in New Zealand, where his research in the plant science department centred on increasing yields from crop and pasture plants. He was particularly interested in plants suited to Canterbury's dry summers, including white clover, subterranean clover, and lucerne. He also conducted research into wheat, and served as a member and chair of the national Wheat Research Committee. Langer was the foundation professor in plant science at Lincoln, and authored more than 60 books and scientific papers. With George Hill he wrote the book Agricultural Plants, published in 1982, that became a standard text for the teaching of plant science. He was also active in the administration of Lincoln College, serving as vice- principal, and as acting principal for 15 months in 1984 and 1985 between the tenures of Sir James Stewart and Bruce Ross. Langer served on the University Grants Committee, and was appointed Lincoln's public orator in 1978. When he retired from Lincoln in March 1985, Langer was conferred the title of professor emeritus. Later life and death Following his retirement, Langer acted as a consultant for the establishment of forestry and agricultural polytechnic institutes in Indonesia. He died in Christchurch on 3 August 2018. Honours and awards In 1972, Langer was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand, and in 1978, he received the Leonard Cockayne Lecture Award from the Royal Society of New Zealand. Following his retirement from Lincoln, Langer was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1985 Queen's Birthday Honours, for services to agricultural education. In 2005, Langer was conferred an honorary DSc by Lincoln University. He was also a fellow of both the New Zealand Institute of Agricultural and Horticultural Science, and the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science.

The maneuver entails cutting the main pulmonary artery and moving it anterior to the aorta before reattaching the pulmonary artery during the following reconstruction of the great vessels. It allows the surgeon to reconstruct the right ventricular outflow tract without needing to connect the proximal and distal sections with a graft. It also enables the surgeon to avoid compressing the coronary arteries and relieves compression of the bronchi in cases where the pulmonary artery is severely dilated or aneurysmal. If both pulmonary arteries are not mobilized adequately, they can become stretched, leading to pulmonic stenosis. Commonly, the maneuver is used during an arterial switch procedure (in which the pulmonary artery and aorta switch positions) or in surgery to correct absent pulmonary valve syndrome. It is also used in corrective surgeries for Tetralogy of Fallot where the pulmonary valve is anomalous, persistent truncus arteriosus with aortopulmonary window that affects the aortic arch, left-to-right shunts, anomalous right pulmonary artery, and ALCAPA (anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery). Other surgeries that regularly employ the LeCompte maneuver include the Yasui procedure, REV procedure, and Nikaidoh operation, all of which are used to reconstruct hearts with an anomalous left ventricular outflow tract.

Company History The designer Neville Trickett and Nick Jenke set up a company called Neville Tricket (Design) Ltd in April 1967 based in Blandford Forum, Dorset. At the suggestion of Michael Saunders, who ran a company called Siva Engineering in Bournemouth, the pair set out to design a series of Edwardian-looking cars. A sales company, Siva Motor Car Co. Ltd was based in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. Production ended in 1976. In total, about 185 cars were made. Vehicles The Edwardian series had bodies largely made of glass fibre that could be fitted to a chassis supplied by the customer. The first in 1969, pre-dating the founding of the Siva company, was the two seat Roadster and four seat Tourer on a Ford Popular chassis. For GBP125 the builder received a body, scuttle and bonnet, four wings, wheel covers and a basic instruction sheet. Extras included a windscreen, weather equipment and upholstery. Complete cars were also available at GBP355. The last cars were made in 1974 after around 80 Tourers and 25 Roadsters had been made. A Tourer named Bessie first appeared in Doctor Who and the Silurians (1970). She provided a transport solution throughout the era of the Third Doctor, but was also used by the Fourth, and by the Seventh. The first Edwardians were followed by the Raceabout and San Remo on a VW Beetle frame and Parisienne on a Citroen 2CV. 126 Edwardian kits were produced. A more successful model was the Mini Buggy similar to VW beach buggies, but based on the Mini. The kit with chassis and body cost GBP 195. By 1976, 95 had been made. The project was sold to Euromotor in Amsterdam who continued production until 1976 when a fire destroyed their factory. The Mule was similar to the Mini Moke. A steel tube frame with Mini subframes formed the basis. Between 1970 and 1975 Siva made 12 of them. The S160 coup√© was based on a still born Hillman Imp powered car exhibited at the 1969 Racing Car Show. At the 1971 show an incomplete and now Volkswagen powered S160 was displayed. The closed body has gullwing doors and rectangular pop-up headlamps and a fully trimmed bodyshell was priced at GBP895 rising later to GBP1,225. A bare bodyshell was however also availbale at GBP525. At least one open version was made. The similar S530 was produced for the 1971 London Motor Show and sponsored by the Daily Telegraph newspaper. It was a larger car; longer and wider and used a 3 Litre Ford V6 engine. An Aston Martin V8 engined version did not get beyond the prototype stage and was replaced in 1974 by the Siva V8 with a Chrysler 7.2 litre engine. Twelve of the coup√©s were made. Following on from the coup√©s, the Siva Saluki was launched at the 1973 Racing Car Show. The VW base was retained, but both the front and headlights and the windscreen were changed from the S160 and in front of the doors additional windows were fitted. The kits were priced at GBP450 and included the glass fibre body tub, gullwing doors, nose and tail sections, seats and dashboard. The car is long, wide and high. Produced from 1973 and 1976 around 20 were made. The Saluki was later built by another company, Embeesea Kit Cars. The Llama was the successor to the Mule and was based on the rear-engined Hillman Imp. It could be made as a two or four-seater, open or closed or as a van and came in a standard colour of ivory. The dimensions are: length , width and height . Between 1974 and 1976 around 50 were made. Less successful was the 1976 Jeep-like Sierra based on the Ford Escort; only three were made.

She is an Italian scientist born in Rome, on April 24, 1955. Her research encompasses natural language processing, machine learning, business intelligence and semantic web, web information extraction in particular. Velardi is one of the hundred female scientists included in the database \\"100esperte.it\\" (translated from Italian with \\"100 female experts\\"). This online, open database champions the recognition of top-rated female scientists in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) area.  Research  Velardi's research aims at using algorithms to analyse natural language on social networks and in general in natural language existing in any written documentation. Her current interest encompasses the study of social media for epidemiological surveillance, for the analysis of the leadership role of women working in enterprise social networks and for the design of recommender systems. Velardi also maintains a strong interest in the area of ontology learning and knowledge bases. A well-known example of application of Velardi's research is the extraction of trending topics on social media. The fundamental concepts of her research within the area of natural language are knowledge learning, graph mining and semantics. Velardi and her team developed a suit of web-based tools based on machine learning techniques that classify natural language for several purposes of analysis, whose applications stem from e-health to female leadership. The key purpose of these web-based tools is the extraction of taxonomies, ontologies and semantics from a pool of written natural-language data, including human crafted knowledge bases such as Wikipedia and from social, semantic and biological networks. The web-based tools that Velardi and her team developed are: * SSI - a state of art knowledge-based word sense disambiguation algorithm. * TermExtractor - a web application that helps a web community extract and validate relevant domains established a priori and submitted to the software program through documents in any format. * Valido ‚Äì a tool to help human annotators in the task of semantically tagging texts. It is based on the SSI algorithm. * OntoLearn ‚Äì an algorithm-based tool to acquire a full lexical ontology from scratch. According to Google Scholar bibliometrics updated until August 2018, Velardi's scientific publications have been cited more than 5472 times. Furthermore, Velardi's h-index was 36. Velardi published more than 150 papers on international journals and conference proceedings. Some of her publications have been published in top rated journals such as Artificial Intelligence, Computational Linguistics, Knowledge Bases Systems, IEEE Transactions (TDKE, PAMI, TOC, TSE), Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, and Journal of Web Semantics.  Education and previous employments  Velardi graduated in electronic engineering at Sapienza University in 1978. From 1978 to 1983, she worked for the Ugo Bordoni Foundation, a research Institution focusing on ICT and working under the supervision of the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. The aim of the foundation is fostering the research transfer from academia to practice in the domains of energy, health and mobility. In the course of 1983, she was a visiting scholar at Stanford University. Then, from 1984 to 1986, she came back to her natal city and worked as researcher for IBM. From 1986 to 1996 she was an associate professor in the engineering faculty of Universit√† Politecnica delle Marche in Italy. From November 1996, she taught in and did research for the department of computer science at the Sapienza University. Velardi has been the head of Bachelor and Master Programs in Computer Science at Sapienza University from 2010 to 2013 and from 2015 to 2016.  Current employment  Velardi became full professor in November 2001 in the department of computer science (\\"dipartimento di informatica\\" in Italian) at the Sapienza University in Rome, Italy. Since 2013, she is the coordinator of the Distance Learning Degree in Computer Science in Sapienza University. Velardi has been employed as full professor at the Sapienza University until today.  Recognition  Velardi is one of the hundred female scientists included in the database \\"100esperte.it\\" (translated from Italian with \\"100 female experts\\"). This database lists Italian female STEM scientists of which. Six out of one hundred scientists in the 100esperte's database are computer scientists like Velardi. Velardi is in the list of the top Italian scientists. A top scientist appearing in the Top- Italian-Scientists database is a scientist whose h-index is greater than 30. In March 2017, Velardi obtained an IBM Faculty Award for her research on social recommender systems. In December 2018, Velardi was included in the list of the 50 most influential Italian women in science and technology by Inspiring Fifty, a non-profit that aims to increase diversity in STEM by making female role models in tech more visible. In September 2019 Velardi has been local co-organizer and Program Chair of the 6th ACM Celebration of Women in Computing . In November 2019 Velardi received the Standout Woman Award International at the seat of the Italian Parliament in Montecitorio.  Causes  Velardi aims at debunking the myth of computer science as a man- oriented and \\"inflexible\\" discipline. She is the founder of the project \\"NERD? Non e' roba per donne?\\" (translated from Italian: \\"NERD? Is it not stuff for women?\\"). This project results from the partnership championed by Velardi in 2012 between IBM Italy and the department of computer science at the Sapienza University. The goal of the project is two-fold: (1) conveying computer science as creative, interdisciplinary and problem-solving oriented science, and (2) encouraging young female students in studying computer science by, for instance, developing apps for smartphones.

It was fought at the site of Fort Namutoni in northern Namibia. The fort was held by four regular soldiers of the German Schutztruppe and three colonial reservists: Fritz Grossman NCO, Jakob Basendowski (NCO), Health Sergeant Bruno Lassmann and soldiers 1st Class Richard Lemke, Albert Lier, Franz Becker and Karl Hartmann. The fort was stocked with 1,500 rounds of ammunition. Chief Nehale Mpingana of the Ondonga people led the attack on the fort. Mpingana was noted for his strongly anti- colonial stance having successfully attacked the Dorsland Trek-Boers in 1886. Continuous attacks on the fort by 500 Ondonga warriors lasted all day until slowing down in frequency as the day went on and eventually stopped in the afternoon. With only 150 rounds of ammunition remaining the defending Germans decided to retreat to the farm Sandhup 40 kilometres to the south on horseback during the night having incurred no casualties. The following morning the fort was sacked and destroyed by Ondonga forces claiming a number of cattle from the fort. Following the battle the fort was rebuilt and greatly expanded by the Germans.

The voivodes from the Odoyevsky family participated in many battles of the 16th century, and were especially notable in the battles with the Tatars and in the 1552 Kazanian Campaign of Ivan the Terrible.

However, despite their illustrious background, the members of the family occupied relatively mediocre ranks and offices, becoming (for example) as colonels, ministerial officials and junior generals, while many family members held regular junior officers' ranks. Prince Alexander Ivanovich Odoyevsky (1802‚Äì1839), a cornet in the Imperial guards, was a member of the and took part in the revolt of 1825. He was sentenced to katorga, but in 1837 he was trasferred to the Caucasus with the rank of private. The last member of the Odoyevsky family, Vladimir Fyodorovich Odoyevsky (1803‚Äì1869) was a writer, philosopher and a musical critic; he served as an employee at a series of institutions; from 1846 he was the assistant to the head of the Russian Imperial Public Library and the curator of the Rumyantsev Museum. In 1861 he was appointed a Senator. He died childless. Alexander Odoyevsky, 1833. In 1878 the Emperor Alexander II allowed staff-rotmister of the Imperial guards, Nikolay Maslov (1849-1919), the son of Sofia Ivanovna Odoyevskaya, to name himself Odoyevsky-Maslov, and to merge his own coat-of-arms with that of his mother's family to pass it down to his senior male descendants. Later became a General of the Cavalry (1914) and the appointed ataman (1905-1907) of the Don Cossack troops; however, he also died childless.

Early life Shiv Verma was born on February 9, 1904 in Khateli village, Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh. At the age of 17, he participated in the Non- Cooperation Movement. He was a student of the DAV College, Kanpur. Revolutionary activities Kanpur (then Cawnpore) was the place where the Hindustan Republican Association was formed by Sachindranath Sanyal, Suresh Chandra Bhattacharya and others. People like Vijay Kumar Sinha, Shiv Verma, Jaidev Kapoor, and Surendra Nath Pandey joined the party. Verma's party name was 'Prabhat' (Hindi: ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§≠‡§æ‡§§). Verma was inclined towards socialism. Vijay Kumar Sinha introduced Verma to the journalist and writer, Radha Mohan Gokul, who became an ideological mentor and inspiration for Verma. Radha Mohan had an extensive collection of books and he encouraged Verma to read and discuss socialism. In 1925, after the Kakori incident, Azad was staying in Jhansi, in seclusion. He came to Kanpur with Kundan Lal Gupt and stayed with Radha Mohan Gokul. This was when Verma and Azad met for the first time. While studying in DAV College, Kanpur, Verma met Bhagat Singh for the first time in January 1927 when the latter had come to Kanpur for a week to meet all the other revolutionaries of HSRA. Ram Prasad Bismil was going to be hanged on August 19, 1927. A day before, his mother, Moolrani (Hindi: ‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§≤‡§∞‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä) came to visit him for the last time in Gorakhpur jail. Verma had already reached there. He approached Bismil's mother and requested her to help him meet Bismil to discuss some party matters. Bismil's mother instantly agreed and asked him to pose as Bismil's cousin, Shankar Prasad, and refer to her as 'mausi' (Hindi: ‡§Æ‡•å‡§∏‡•Ä). Since it was the final meeting between mother and son, they were left alone for some time. Bismil's mother then asked him to talk to Verma, referring to him as an HSRA member. It was Verma who recruited Mahavir Singh in June 1928 for HSRA activities. Verma regrouped with Sukhdev and others in Lahore. In November 1928, Verma underwent training in the manufacturing of bombs while staying in Agra near Noori Gate where he rented a house under the fake name - Amir Chand. In the final verdict of the Kakori conspiracy, Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment. While he was kept in the Fatehgarh jail from 1928-29, Verma and Sinha were entrusted with the job of getting Chatterjee's approval for getting him released from jail. On March 3, 1928, after the duo left Fatehgarh jail, the secret police were on their trail. The duo sensed this and decided to leave immediately. They bought train tickets for Kanpur but the ticket details were soon available to the police. When the train started, two policemen seated themselves in the same compartment where the duo had reserved their seats. They were looking for an opportunity to abscond during the journey. Later, when the train was leaving the Jalalabad station, they jumped out of the train cautiously. The constables hurt themselves in their attempt to follow them and could not give a chase. The duo again evaded arrest at the Kanpur station but now had accepted the fact that, henceforth, they would have to lead the life of fugitives. Verma was a member of the Central Committee which was formed by the revolutionaries in the ruins of the Feroze Shah Kotla fort of Delhi on September 8 & 9, 1928. He was the organizer of the United Provinces branch. Verma wrote several articles for the paper 'Chand' (Hindi: ‡§ö‡§æ‡§Å‡§¶). By the beginning of 1929, it was clear that Viceroy Irwin would use his veto power to pass the Public Safety Bill and the Trade Dispute Bills, despite being rejected in the assembly. Verma was assigned as the leader of a team that would assess the possibility of assassinating Viceroy Irwin. They decided to attempt it when the Viceroy was going to attend a banquet and dinner party held by some I.C.S officers in Delhi. Rajguru was the spotter, Kapoor was supposed to hurl a bomb on Irwin's car and Verma was the backup - in case Kapoor missed. Rajguru noticed that the Viceroy's car was containing three ladies, hence, he didn't give any signal and was later praised by Azad and the other compatriots for avoiding indiscriminate assassinations. They later learned that the Viceroy had proceeded to some other venue and reached the banquet venue later via a different route. Azad had ordered that after Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt hurled bombs in the assembly, everyone except Shiv Verma and Jaidev Kapoor must leave Delhi while Azad himself will head to Jhansi. Verma went to drop Azad at the station. Azad instructed Verma to take good care of Singh and Dutt as these two were headed on a path of no return. Shiv Verma and Jaidev Kapoor spent a sleepless and dejected night in their Delhi hideout, wondering about the future of their arrested compatriots. =Arrest= Dr Gaya Prasad, Jaidev Kapoor, and Shiv Verma were given the task of setting up a bomb factory in Sahranpur. The modus operandi was simple - Dr Gaya Prasad would rent a place to start a dispensary, Verma and Kapoor would be his compounder and dresser, respectively. This plan had worked out successfully previously e.g.: Ferozepur factory-cum-hideout (where Verma pretended to be 'Ram Narayan Kapoor'). This time, they couldn't secure any funds as their primary source, Kashiram (another HSRA revolutionary) failed to turn up with the money. Dr Gaya Prasad then left for Kanpur to arrange some funds while Verma and Kapoor stayed back. Soon, the locals and the police grew suspicious as these two were idle, the doctor was missing and there was no activity resembling a dispensary. This was during May 1929. Every night, Verma and Kapoor went to the terrace and observed the surrounding area. One of their observations was that the police conducted search raids and arrests around 0400 hours, therefore, they took turns and stood guard during the night. After sunrise, they would come down and sleep without any anxiety. On May 13, 1929, they were fast asleep in the courtyard when there was a knock on the door. Shiv Verma woke up and opened the door thinking that it was Dr Gaya Prasad but it turned out to be armed police constables. The DSP, Mathura Dutt Joshi, and the Chief Police Officer marched in while the constables held Verma. Upon being asked about his whereabouts, Verma said that he was Dr Gaya Prasad's relative, he was studying in the Banaras University and was here on a vacation. He denied any knowledge about the gunpowder lying in one of the cupboards. In the adjoining room, they found Jaidev Kapoor along with bombshells and other material. The DSP compelled Verma to open a trunk. Verma opened the trunk, put his hand inside it, produced a bomb and pretended to hurl it towards the DSP. The DSP and most of the constables ran outside the house while the Chief Police Officer hid behind the door and started to observe Verma's moves. To prevent accidents, the bombs and the pins required to trigger them were kept separately. Verma wanted the pins and two revolvers placed in another cupboard, hence, he placed the bomb on the floor and proceeded towards the cupboard. The Chief Officer seized this opportunity, overpowered Verma and called for support. The constables stormed in again and finally, both Kapoor and Verma were handcuffed. Two days later, Dr Gaya Prasad was arrested at the same location when he returned from Kanpur, late in the night. Both were taken to the police headquarters, imprisoned but treated well to create an impression that the arrested revolutionaries were treated generously. One of the constables confided in Verma that the DSP had told them they were going to raid and arrest opium traders, had the constables any idea about the revolutionaries, they would have allowed them to escape. Verma and Kapoor also learned that the tip-off was given by their HSRA compatriot, Phanindranath Ghosh, who had turned into a witness for the police. =Hunger strike= Shiv Verma, Jaidev Kapoor, and Dr Gaya Prasad were sent to Lahore jail. Over a short period of time, the HSRA revolutionaries arrested at different locations were together in the Lahore jail. Shiv Verma, Jaidev Kapoor, Kishori Lal and all the other HSRA revolutionaries begun hunger strike on July 13, 1929, to express solidarity with Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt, who had already been on a hunger strike for a month. Being lean and thin, Shiv Verma received less beating and thrashing from the police while Bhagat Singh, Mahavir Singh, Rajguru, Sukhdev and other more sturdy men bore most of the brunt. In the hunger strike, Jatin Das succumbed to the ill-effects of forced feeding while Shiv Verma's condition turned critical. =Lahore conspiracy verdict= The Lahore Conspiracy Case ruling came on October 7, 1930. Shiv Verma was among the revolutionaries who were sentenced to life imprisonment. One day, a senior police inspector ordered Shiv Verma and his associates to vacate their cells. The inspector compassionately allowed Shiv Verma and others to meet Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru for one last time. Shiv Verma's eyes brimmed with tears when leaving. This is when Bhagat Singh remarked \\"Shiv, it is not the time to be emotional. I will be relieved of all difficulties in a few days; but you all have to undertake a long, difficult journey. I am confident that despite the heavy burden of responsibility, you will not be fatigued in this long campaign and you will not be disheartened enough to give up\\". =Imprisonment= Shiv Verma was then sent to Rajahmundry Jail of Andhra Pradesh where he learned about the deaths of first, Azad and later, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru. He was later deported to the Cellular Jail in Andaman. In 1933, he participated in the hunger strike to protest against the inhuman and unfair treatment meted out to the inmates, especially, the political prisoners. During this hunger strike, his HSRA compatriot, Mahavir Singh, died. The others who lost their lives were Mohit Maitra and Manakrishna Nabadas. The British authorities finally relented and agreed to the following demands: * Soap provided to clean with * Beds to sleep in * Edible food For political prisoners * Allow studying and provide books * Allow communicating amongst themselves Gradually, an academic environment grew within the premises of the jail. Prisoners studied political science and history under Satish Pakrashi, Shiv Verma and Bhupal Bose. In 1937, he again participated in a 36-day final hunger strike before the cellular jail was shut down permanently in January 1938. He was repatriated to India in September 1937 but was finally released in 1946. Later life In 1948, Verma was elected secretary of the Uttar Pradesh state committee of the then united, Communist Party of India. He was imprisoned several times during the years 1948, 1962 and 1965 when the ruling Indian National Congress took actions against the communist parties. Verma sided with the CPI(M) but gradually faced opposition and humiliation during the internal rift for election tickets. He incessantly tried to factually portray the Indian revolutionaries and counter the polarized opinions about them. He became the editor of ‚Äò‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï‡§≤‡§π‡§∞‚Äô (Loklahar) and ‚ÄòNaya Savera‚Äô, the mouthpiece of the then Communist Party of India. He was also the editor of a Hindi journal Naya Path. He was a lifelong trustee of the Lucknow Montessori Society started by 'Durga bhabhi'. He also founded the Martyrs Memorial and Freedom Struggle Research Centre, Lucknow. He traveled all over the country to collect articles, photographs, etc., of the revolutionaries. He even went to the British Museum, London, in this very connection. Death Shiv Verma passed away on January 10, 1997. Legacy The municipal council of Hardoi has passed a resolution to erect statues of Shiv Verma, Jaidev Kapoor, and Hari Bahadur Shrivastav in the garden (Hindi: ‡§∂‡§π‡•Ä‡§¶ ‡§â‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®) dedicated to Indian revolutionaries.

Roe was a landmark child custody case in Virginia that denied the father custody due to his sexual orientation. The 1985 case was brought to the Virginia Supreme Court and the father's custody was removed due to ‚Äúcontinuous exposure of his nine-year-old daughter to his immoral and illicit homosexual relationship rendered him an unfit and improper custodian.‚Äù Because homosexuality violated the Virginia sodomy laws, and was considered a class 6 felony, custody was granted to the mother.  Background  The trial case used fictitious surnames for both parties. Catherine Roe (biological mother) and David Roe (biological father) were married in 1971. Their daughter was born in 1974. The couple separated in 1975. Catherine Roe served as the primary caregiver until December 1978 when she was diagnosed with cancer. David Roe became a more active caregiver at that time, and subsequently petitioned for custody in the fall of 1979. From then until 1983, the child stayed within the custody of David Roe and the child's mother was unable to care for her.  Verdict  In 1983 the mother filed a temporary restraining order claiming David Roe was living with a man. She reported that the saw the two men \\"hugging and kissing and sleeping in bed together.\\" The mother's petition for custody was also based on the fact that she was now recovered and in remission and thus able to care for her daughter. Initially, the trial court found that each parent should get joint custody. The court did condition this arrangement on the fact that the father was required to not share the same bed with his lover. The court cited the ruling on Brown v. Brown (which removed custody from the mother of two young children due to her living with another man while in the process of trying to divorce her husband/the father of the children). Following this ruling, the Supreme Court of Virginia ceased joint custody and all visitation rights and the mother was granted sole custody.  Precedent  The case was used as the precedent for the Bottoms v. Bottoms case in which a lesbian mother was denied custody of her son due to her sexuality. Specifically, the case has been used to prevent homosexual people from having custody of their natural children.  References  Virginia state case law Child custody ","title":"Roe v.

He took his law degree at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He was one of the editors of the University Gazette and class Valedictorian. He articled with the firm of Hannington and Wilson of Saint John before moving into private practice. He lectured at Kings College Law School in Fredericton.

(The latter would marry Inez Geneva Trueman.) In 1908, he moved to Winnipeg where he continued to practice law. In 1915, he drafted the Referendum and Initiative Act, which would have made popular plebiscites legal. The act would be referred to the Court of King's Bench for a ruling on whether the Government of Manitoba had jurisdiction to enact such an act. It was subsequently decided that the government had such authority. However, the Manitoba Court of Appeal would subsequently overrule the lower court's decision. The matter was taken directly to the Privy Council on special leave, bypassing the Supreme Court, where it was held in 1919 that the Manitoba government had no such right. In 1916, he was made King's Counsel. Following the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919, he defended William Ivens and John Queen, two leading figures in the strike who were accused of seditious libel and conspiracy. In his jury address, he is reported to have said \\"you cannot indict ideas\\". Both men would be convicted in 1920.

Lowe is also executive producer and stars in the film, alongside Mckenna Grace, Sarah Dugdale, Marci T. House, Lorne Cardinal, Chris Shields, Cara Buono, and a special appearance by Patty McCormack. The horror thriller is based on the 1954 novel by William March, the 1954 play, and the 1956 film. The Bad Seed originally aired on Lifetime on September 9, 2018. This is the second remake of the film, the first being a 1985 film. On September 16, 2018, a \\"special edition\\" of the TV movie was released that features behind the scenes interviews with Lowe, Grace, and McCormack. Plot Widowed father David Grossman (Lowe) helps his daughter Emma (Grace) cope with a tragedy when a classmate drowns at her school. Emma initially seems like an ordinary child. However, David begins to wonder if she played a role in the incident, due to the fact that her classmate had won a citizenship medal she coveted. Further deaths occur, such as Emma's teacher and nanny, and David is forced to accept the fact that his daughter is a cold-blooded killer. After he confronts her, she admits committing the murders, justifying each murder and claiming it wasn't her fault. In desperation, David takes her to an isolated cabin, trying to figure out what to do. After she attempts to kill him, he tries to shoot her to spare her from being institutionalized. At that moment, however, the lake house's caretaker Brian enters the cabin and, believing David has lost his mind, shoots him dead. As the police take Brian's statement, Emma is taken in by David's sister Angela. As the film closes, Emma embraces her aunt, a cold, predatory look on her face. Cast * Mckenna Grace as Emma Grossman * Rob Lowe as David Grossman, Emma's father * Sarah Dugdale as Chloe, Emma's new nanny. * Marci T. House as Mrs. Ellis, Emma's teacher. * Lorne Cardinal as Brian, the caretaker of the Grossmans' lake house. * Chris Shields as Sheriff Peterson * Cara Buono as Angela Grossman, David's sister and Emma's aunt. * Luke Roessler as Milo, a Emma's classmate and victim. * Shauna Johannesen as Milo's mother. * Patty McCormack as Dr. March, Emma's psychiatrist. McCormack received an Oscar nomination for playing the daughter in the 1956 film. Production A conventional remake of The Bad Seed, written by Barbara Marshall, had been in development hell between Lifetime and executive producer Mark Wolper. However, it never survived script stage, until late 2017, when Lifetime gave the green-light on production. Warner Bros. Television owns the rights to the title. Actor-director Rob Lowe was also named as director and star of the 2018 release, with additional casting to follow. In February 2018, Mckenna Grace and Patty McCormack were announced as being cast. Reception =Critical reception= The Bad Seed received mixed reviews upon its release. David Feinberg of The Hollywood Reporter said: \\"Call it The Bad Seed and you tap into a surface-glaze legitimacy that's probably unwarranted, because the movie, notable as co-star Rob Lowe's directing debut, achieves only a baseline amount of trashy fun, nothing more or less.\\" Andrea Reiher from the website Collider said the film \\"suffers from being neither dark enough nor campy enough‚Äîeither choice would have been a lot more enjoyable. But it is stuck in a middle area that is devoid of over-the-top absurdity or any real darkness.\\" =Ratings= Upon its initial broadcast on September 9, 2018, The Bad Seed was watched by 1.87 million viewers, placing it in the top ten most-watched cable programs on that date.

The lower part of the segment includes gneiss, biotite, muscovite, magmatized and augen gneiss, metagabbro, eclogite, amphibolite, amphibolite shale and micaceous marble. In the upper segment are different types of mica schist, granite, kyanite and staurolite. The upper Precambrian of Pelagon Horst Anticlinorium include mixed series of gneiss, mica schist, barite, cipolem, marble and metarhyolite together with calcite and dolomite up to three kilometers thick. Other parts of the Precambrian complex have widely distributed granitoids which in some cases have merged with surrounding gneiss. There are pegmatite and aplite bodies and veins. Granitoids have been dated as one billion to 800 million years old by potassium-argon dating methods and appear to date to the Grenville orogeny period. The Precambrian complex in the Serbo-Macedonian Massif is made up of gneiss, mica schist and gabbro amphibolite with small masses of marble and metarhyolite. Gneiss is connected to the lower part of the massif and includes minerals such as muscovite, biotite and augen. Mica schist tends to occur in thin bands while gabbro amphibolites represent the metamorphosed magma intrusions and basic rocks with meta-tuff sometimes interspersed with gneiss and mica schist in bands and lenses. In the Pelagon, rocks have Barrovian-type regional metamorphism up to greenschist grade on the sequence of metamorphic facies. In the Serbo-Macedonian Massif, rocks also reach greenschist facies and exhibit Barrovian-type metamorphism. =Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)= Paleozoic rocks are widespread in North Macedonia, particularly in the west, including phyllite, volcanic formations and evidence of Riphean through Cambrian, Ordovician, Devonian and Silurian formations based on fossil cephalopods, corals, brachiopods, trilobites and goniatites. Riphean-Cambrian rocks are particularly common in the Serbo-Macedonian Massif, representing sedimentary-volcanic sequences of albite, epidote and chlorite shales, albite- quartz-sericite shales, amphibole metagabbro, and metadiabase, such as the Vlasina Complex in Serbia. Metarhyolites also dominate in the Riphean-Cambrian segment of the Vardar Zone, including phyllite, spilite and keratophyre, epidote-chlorite, spilite-mica schist and low-grade metamorphic shales. Ordovician rocks are represented by metasediments such as phyllite, sandy phyllite, quartzite sandstone and some shales. The Silurian also has phyllite- like rocks but has a greater proportion of volcanic and quartz porphyry rocks. The Devonian is western North Macedonia is also defined by phyllites, together with graphite shale, conglomerate, quartzite and carbonaceous shales, along with marble containing crinoid fossils. Paleozoic formations in different zones indicate that the lower units are most complex in eastern North Macedonia, while the Ordovician and Devonian formations tend to be less numerous in the Vardar Zone and are generally more present in the west. The Kraistides, a volcanic complex spanning into neighboring Bulgaria dominates some parts of the country, with greenschist, metadiabase and spilite in its lower levels, and phyllite schists in its upper levels. Paleozoic magma formations include granitoid intrusions in both the west and the east, such as the Pelister Massif, in the west, which is well known to geologists because it breaks through Caledonian orogeny age Paleozoic formations, forming 456 million years ago. It includes biotite, alkali granites and adamellite. The Kruschevo granodiorite is associated with the Hercynian orogeny 289 million years ago representing biotite granite that was impacted by intense metamorphism. The granite here tends to be cataclastic while biotite has largely been transformed into secondary minerals. The Kraistide area in the east has some additional intrusions, including laminated granites and rose- colored granites, together with aplite and quartz porphyry. Regional metamorphism of Paleozoic rocks in western North Macedonia is characterized by low temperatures and high pressures, particularly Paleozoic rocks during the Alpine orogeny period went through a single period of intense cataclastic metamorphism. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= Triassic rocks are mostly found in western North Macedonia, although less in the Vardar Zone, covering only a small area in the Delchevo border zone near Bulgaria. They are mainly volcanic rocks in the lower units overlain by carbonaceous dolomite. Jurassic rocks are particularly common in the Vardar Zone, particularly in the west. In this area, rocks are extremely varied due to ophiolite formations and massifs. The ophiolites are found in serpentinized ultra-mafic masses or sometimes as more complete ophiolite complexes. Apart from ultrabasic rocks, there is also diabase, gabbro, peridotite and basalt. In the Vardar Zone, a series of faults and diapirs are laminated and highly serpentinized. The Radusha Massif is the most significant ophiolite massif, covering an area of 60 square kilometers northwest of Skopje. Chromium ore was extracted from the massif for decades and it also hosts dunite, harzburgite, veins and lenses of gabbro and rodingite. Gabbro-diorites of the ophiolite suite include the Demir Kapija-Gevgelija, Klepa and Skopska Crna Gora massifs in the central part of the Vardar Zone. The Demir Kapija-Gevgelija Massif extends over an area of 400 square kilometers. Basal conglomerate in the Demir Kapija area are overlain by massive limestones from the Tithonian. Ophiolite-gabbro cumulates are identified as oceanic-type gabbros and basalts are believed to have formed from up to 20 percent pre-existing crustal rock. Among the acidic magmatic intrusive bodies in the area are granites and granodiorites. In the west, in the vicinity of Korab Mountain, is a limestone formation with layers of chert and a flysch formation dominating the sub-soil, made up of claystone, limestone and siltstone. Toward the south is an additional ophiolite complex with similar rocks to the Vardar Zone. Cretaceous rocks include examples from the Turonian and Senonian. Albian rocks are only found around the southeastern city of Shtip. Flysch is the most common remnant of the Senonian, particularly in the western Vardar Zone (up to three kilometers of alternating conglomerates, sandstones, arkose, marl, limestone and rudist fossils‚Äîshifting more toward siltstone in the east). Along the Radika River and Drim River in western North Macedonia, flysch, a carbonaceous sandbar limestone and olistolith limestone blocks outcrop. Cretaceous intrusive bodies include small granite bodies along the Pelagon fault zone, dating to 118 million years ago. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)= The Cenozoic is represented by Eocene continental and marine deposits, along with volcanic formations from the Neogene and the last 2.5 million years of the Quaternary. Eocene rocks are mainly found in the Vardar Zone, especially close to Delchevo along the Bulgarian border and Debar. Red or violet conglomerate and sandstone make up the lower layers along with molasse formations. They are overlain by alternating sequences of sand and clay flysch with limestone layers rich in Eocene fossils. The Oligocene along the Bulgarian border has quartz latite and dacite rocks. Continental molasse deposited during the Miocene and Pliocene with sand, clay, tuff, volcanic ash, although there are some layers of diatomaceous earth and limestone in the Pelagon area. Marl, 1.5 kilometers thick fills the Skopje valley. Pliocene sands are covered by limestone and travertine which resulted from lake beds and hydrothermal waters. The Zletovo- Kratovo volcanic formation is also from the same period. Small basalt eruptions at the edge of the Vardar Zone in the early Quaternary produced some of the youngest rocks in the country. Natural resource geology In the past, iron, chromium, diatomite, marble, perlite and other resources have been mined in North Macedonia. Lead, zinc, copper, decorative stone and quartzite were mined on a small scale in the 1990s.

Early life and education  Ant√≥nio Carrilho was born in Loul√©, in Algarve, Alexandre Bento Carrilho and de Isabel de Jesus Cavaco. He joined the Faro Seminary in October 1953, and then moved to Lisbon to pursue philosophical and theological courses at the Olivais Seminary. In October 1977 he joined the Catholic University in Lisbon, where he graduated with a degree in theology.  Priesthood  On July 28, 1965, he was ordained priest by Bishop Fra Francisco Rendeiro at the Cathedral of Faro. He celebrated his New Mass in the Mother Church of his parish of St. Clement in Loul√©. After graduating from university he began to work at the Portuguese Episcopal Conference, where he held various functions over the years.  Episcopate  On 22 February 1999, he was appointed Titular Bishop of Tamalluma and Auxiliary Bishop Porto by Pope John Paul II. On 8 March 2007 he was appointed Bishop of Funchal, a post he held until his successor was appointed by Pope Francis on January 12, 2019. = Portugal's Conference of Catholic Bishops = Bishop Carrilho has held several posts within Portugal's Conference of Catholic Bishops over the years: * Member of the Episcopal Commission of the Apostolate of the Laity for the 1999-2002 triennium and President for 2002/2005 * Member of the Episcopal Commission of Cultural Assets of the Church for the triennium 2002/2005 * President of the Episcopal Commission of the Laity and Family for two three-year periods, 2005-2011, and member since 2011 Currently he is a member the Conference's Commission for Missions and New Evangelization. = Priest Giselo Andrade Case = In November 2017, Madeiran newspapers reported that Priest Giselo Andrade, canon of the Catholic parish of Monte in Funchal, then 37 years old, had assumed the paternity of a girl on August 18 of the same year. The girl was born to a former high school colleague of the priest. At the time of the news reports Father Giselo was a member of the Permanent Secretariat of the Presbyteral Council and the director of the Diocese's newspaper Jornal da Madeira. Carilho was forced to intervene after he had commented to the press that \\"Everything is forgiven, as long as there is true repenting and a change in lifestyle\\" to justify the permanence in office of Priest Giselo and his wish to remain in functions within the parish. On January 27, at 9 o'clock in the evening, Bishop Carrilho stated, through his personal secretary, Priest Carlos Almada, in a press release, that Priest Giselo was to be removed from office in the parish of Monte and to be substituted by the canon V√≠tor Gomes. Despite being the removed from the parish, Bishop Carrilho stated in his press release that Father Giselo would to \\"...continue to exercise the pastoral ministry through some of the activities already entrusted to him in the area of communications [as director of Jornal da Madeira], and others that may be assigned to him\\".Bishop Carillho's decision and its timing polarized the public opinion in Madeira, specially in Monte where the vast majority of parishioners wished that Priest Giselo remain as their priest even after he had assumed the paternity of the child. Parishioners criticized and repudiated Bishop Carrilho's decision, calling it an inhumane decision. = Sexual Abuse Policies = In September 2018, Carilho decided to remove from office Father Anast√°cio Alves, who had ecclesiastical functions on the Portuguese Parish of Gentilly, near Paris, after Madeira's Public Prosecution Service announced investigations on an alleged child abuse case. Bishop Carrilho stated that the Diocese of Funchal has zero tolerance policy regarding child abuse cases and is in \\"full communion with Pope Francis's\\" views on how to handle the said cases. In light of this case, Bishop Carrilho also stated that he would be conducting an investigation on Father Alves's case and submit all the conclusions to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, as required by Canon law.  Public Support for Pope Francis  Following the McCarrick case and Vigan√≤ allegations, happening at about the same time as the conclusion of the Grand jury investigation of Catholic Church sexual abuse in Pennsylvania, Bishop Carrilho, together with his peers of the Portuguese Episcopal Conference was co-signer of a public support letter addressed to Pope Francis. The Portuguese bishops criticized all \\"attempts to call into question the [Pope's] credibility\\" and expressed \\"fraternal support\\" to the leader of the Catholic Church, stressing that they are in \\"full communion\\" with the Pope. In the same letter, Bishop Carrilho and his peers also took the opportunity to support and condemn the \\"drama of child abuse by responsible members of the Church,\\" under a commitment to \\"root out the causes.\\"  Honours  * 80x80px Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry, 2019  Coat of Arms   References  Portuguese Roman Catholic bishops 1942 births Living people ","title":"Ant√≥nio Jos√© Cavaco Carrilho"},{"id":"58319355","text":"April Salome Forest Management Area also known as April Salumei Rainforest April Salumei Rainforest Conservation project is a forest management area in April ‚Äî Salumei tropical forest covering about 521,500 hectares in Ambunti- Dreikikir District of East Sepik Province, of Papua New Guinea.Map GA 7489 Publisher: Geoscience Australia (Australian Government) The forest is located in the basins of two rivers: AprilApril River: Papua New Guinea National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Bethesda, MD, USA and Salumei.Salumei River: Papua New Guinea National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Bethesda, MD, USA The town of Ambunti serves as a gateway to the April Salome Forest Management Area.April Salome Forest Management Area PlacesMap.net  Population  It is estimated that about 20,000 people are living in this areaApril Salome in 164 forest-dependent communities.

He had dissipated a considerable fortune and was deeply in debt when he took office, and used his power in wartime conditions to establish lucrative illegal arrangements to trade with France's enemies the English and the Dutch. A young nobleman arrived in Martinique in 1748, and for several months used revenues from his family estates on the island to give meals and dances for the elite. After he left it was found that he had been an impostor. Family Charles de Tubi√®res de Caylus was born in 1698. He was seigneur of Thubi√®res, L√©vis, Postels and Grimoard. His parents were Jean Anne de Tubi√®res-Grimoard de Pestels de L√©vis, compte de Caylus (), and Marthe Marguerite Hippolyte Le Valois de Villette (1671‚Äì1729). He was the nephew of Daniel-Charles-Gabriel de Caylus, bishop of Auxerre. In 1686 his uncle, the marquis de Caylus, married Marie-Marguerite de Vill√®te, niece of Madame de Maintenon. The famous antiquary Anne-Claude-Philippe de Caylus (1692‚Äì1765) was his brother. Naval career Caylus became a knight of the Order of Malta and infantry colonel. In July 1741 Caylus was capitaine de vaisseau of the Bor√©e (66) and commander of a small French squadron that included the Aquilon (46) and the Flore (26). They were coming from Martinique. On 25 July 1741 off Cap Spartel they met a British force under Captain Curtis Barnett of the Dragon (60) with the Feversham (44) and Folkestone (44). The British asked to be allowed to board to confirm they were not Spanish, and opened fire when they refused. After the ships on both sides had suffered some damage and loss of men, the British sent a boat to the Bor√©e under a flag of truce and discovered the truth. The French did not know whether France and Britain were still at peace, since there had been a risk of war when they left the West Indies, and demanded that Barnet's lieutenant swear that this was the case. On 16 December 1744 the chevalier de Caylus led a squadron of six vessels into the harbour of Malta during a festival that the French were holding on that island to celebrate the convalescence of the king. Caylus had all the vices of a fashionable man and had dissipated a considerable fortune. His money had gone on gambling, women and food, and he had borrowed heavily from a Marseille merchant named Roux and other creditors. To recover his fortunes he requested and obtained the governorship general of the Windward Islands. The minister wrongly complained of his predecessor Jacques-Charles Bochart de Champigny(fr), who perhaps by 1744 no longer had the same energy he had displayed at Saint Lucia against the English when he was only the governor of Martinique, but who was popular with the inhabitants of the islands. Before leaving to take up his governorship Caylus managed to gain a stay in proceedings against him by his creditors due to the state of war. Martinique During the War of the Austrian Succession (1740‚Äì1748) the marquis de Caylus was made governor and lieutenant-general of the Windward Islands in 1745. He replaced the marquis de Champigny. At the start of 1745 the English attacked Dominica twice, and in the absence of any French naval presence in the Antilles captured all merchant ships. The balance changed when two of the kings frigates, the Amphytrite and the M√©g√®re, came as escort of a convoy of 10-12 merchant ships. Two days later they were followed by the Esp√©rance, Northumberland, S√©rieux, Trident, Diamant and Aquilon, which anchored at Fort-Royal, Martinique. Caylus was on the Esp√©rance, and had given passage to a Spanish party including the archbishop of Santo Domingo. Caylus had left Toulon around the start of 1745, touched at Cadiz and anchored at Fort-Royal on 30 April 1745. He was received by de Champigny, who took passage on one of the ship of the squadron. Caylus was formally recognized as governor general by the troops and the sovereign council in Martinique on 9 and 10 May 1745. Later he was named chef d'escadre. Caylus made his home in Saint-Pierre, Martinique. He was there in 1747 when, to everyone's surprise, Bertrand- Fran√ßois Mah√© de La Bourdonnais, governor of the French possessions in India, arrived at Fort-Royal on his way back to France. Once in office, Caylus looked for ways to profit from his ability to define the rules of privateering and foreign trade. He invested in armaments, which he supplied to corsairs who worked for him and scoured the seas around the island for booty. Through secret agents he established relations with the governors of English islands, and arranged for goods imported from these islands to be sold as booty, and for goods bought in Saint-Pierre by his agents to be sold to the English. Through these means, he profited from the scarcity of goods in Martinique. After France declared war on Holland, Caylus established relations with Heliger, governor of Sint Eustatius, and severed ties with the English. The two governors arranged to make huge profits supplying the English, allies of the Dutch, with products supposedly from the Dutch colonies. They also arranged for French ships to sail under Dutch passports. By 1748 the islanders were suffering from an increasingly tight blockade by the English. Supplies could only be obtained from Curacao and Sint Eustatius. Caylus was blamed for the extortionate prices. In 1748 a small ship arrived in Martinique from La Rochelle, the Coureur, carrying a passenger who called himself the \\"comte de Tarnaud\\" and put on very distinguished airs. The rumour spread that he was Ercole Rinaldo of Este, hereditary prince of Modena, grandson of the Duke of Orl√©ans and brother of the duchess of Penthi√®vre. Caylus sent a letter asking him to come to Saint Pierre. The young man refused, proclaimed that he was Hercule-Renaud d'Est, and wrote that if the governor wanted to meet him he should come to Fort Royal. The governor started out then changed his mind and returned to Saint Pierre. Soon after the supposed prince came to Saint Pierre and found accommodation with the Jesuits. Later the young man moved to the Dominicans, where he entertained in style. The news of the Treaty of Aix-la- Chapelle arrived at this time, and the blockade was lifted. The duke of Penthi√®vre had considerable property on the island, and his agent was persuaded to supply funds to the young man. He was neither extravagant or miserly, but lived very much as a person of his rank would be expected to live, although the islanders began to tire of the expense. Message were sent to Europe to confirm his identity, but the prince left for Portugal before a reply was received. Shortly after, a courier arrived instructing the governor to arrest the stranger. The impostor was at first accepted when he arrived in Portugal, then in Seville, when orders again came for his arrest. He escaped and disappeared forever. In August 1749 Caylus was deputy for the nobility for the province of Languedoc. The governor of Martinique, Andr√© Martin de Pointesable, who had been in France recovering from an illness, returned in 1750. Caylus died on 12 May 1750 in Saint-Pierre, Martinique, aged about 52. He died alone and unexpectedly in the small house named Tricolor he rented on the heights of Saint-Pierre, and was buried with little ceremony. The governor of the island died a few days later.

She is associated with the origin of some diseases, as well as unpleasant (or useless) creatures such as the snake, lizard, or wolf. In some folktales she takes the role of wicked mother. Description :NB english transliterations, except where noted, are from Sy√∂j√§t√§r appears in some of the \\"Magic Songs\\" (spells) catalogued by in the Suomen kansan muinaisia loitsurunoja - these were later translated into English by Abercromby. =Origin= A possible origin story is given in a song describing the \\"Origin of Injuries caused by Spells\\", which contains some post-Christian elements: Louhiatar wife of Pohja becomes pregnant whilst sleeping with her back to the wind, impregnated by a blast of wind... After more than nine months the woman seeks to give birth but can find no good place to do so - then god (Ukko) speaks to her from a cloud indicating that a \\"three cornered shed is on the swamp, on the shore facing the sea in gloomy Pohjola [...] go thither to be confined, to lighten thy womb...\\" - she gives birth to nine sons, and one girl. God (the Christian \\"Maker\\") refuses to baptise them, as does \\"Juhannes, the holy knight\\" (John the Baptist) - Louhitar then baptises them herself, giving them names (they become disease principles) - one of her boys, who lacks a mouth or eyes remains unnamed, and she sends him away to the Rutja rapids, from him were said to originate sharp frosts, sorcerers and wizards, jealous persons, and the creatures called Sy√∂j√§t√§rs. =In other origin myths= As with other mythic entities in the \\"songs\\" Sy√∂j√§t√§r's name is used in allusions or figurative reference to creatures, objects, and concepts - she is generally imbued with negative connotations: In a spell against syphilis the disease is called the progeny of Sy√∂j√§t√§r; in a spell against \\"tooth worm\\" (Hammasmato, gnawer of teeth and bones, was believed to be the cause of tooth decay and infections) the creature's origin is given as coming indirectly from the work of Sy√∂j√§t√§r: Together with Hiisi she is a key element in the creation myth of Snakes - in the story Hiisi's sleep drool is swallowed by Sy√∂j√§t√§r, but it burns her and she spits it out.. after being blown by the wind, it lands and dries, Hiisi then brings it to life. In other variants it is Sy√∂j√§t√§r's spit, but Hiisi still brings it to life. She is also involved in the creation of the Lizard - she spits on the sea that forms a bubble - the bubble is swallowed by the girl Kasaritar (or Kasarikki) who becomes pregnant for three years, then gives birth to a Lizard. A similar creation story for the Wolf again involves Sy√∂j√§t√§r spitting on the sea - then Kuolatar appears from the sea on a bare island - this creature rubs its palms to create some land whereon the wolf was reared. In a song describing the origin of stone, it is described as the heart's core of Sy√∂j√§t√§r, amongst several other allusions; she is also the originator of the Fir tree (in one version), together with Maajatar, Pellervoinen, and Naservainen who develop it. In a song for the purpose \\"To Still Violence\\" Sy√∂j√§t√§r is referenced as the \\"Ogress\\", and is given as an element in the consumption of persons consumed by violence or anger: =In the Kalevala= Sy√∂j√§t√§r is mentioned in passing in the Finnish epic, the Kalevala, but does not appear herself - in Rune XV a reference to the creation of the snake from her spit is found; and in Rune XXVI a similar (and longer) description of the formation of a snake from her spit is given. =In other folk tales= Sy√∂j√§t√§r appears in a several folk tales, recorded in the Suomen kansan Satuja ja Tarinoita (4 parts) edited by Eero Salmelainen (:fi:Eero Salmelainen). In Saaressa el√§j√§t, a tale about three sisters who seek to marry the King, she appears as a wicked mother who replaces newborn children with animals so that her own daughter can marry the king. ::From a German translation in : :... The youngest sister says she will bear three times three sons, and is chosen - she becomes pregnant and when the time comes for her to give birth she sends her husband to fetch a midwife. On the way he is met by a woman (unbeknown to him it is Sy√∂j√§t√§r) - when left along with the woman and her three children she swaps them for three dogs... the same happens the next time the woman becomes pregnant, this time Sy√∂j√§t√§r swaps the three children for pigs... a third time she becomes pregnant, and again the Sy√∂j√§t√§r comes - this time she recognizes her and hides one child in her breast, the other two are swapped for lap dogs. The husband's (king's) patience expires and he puts them in an iron case with one of the lap dogs and throws it in the sea - eventually the cask washes ashore. Deserted on an island surrounded by salt water the boy prays to god, and god provides a fabulous house, food from a magic tree, and a bridge to the mainland. Eventually tales of the place reach the prince, and he plans to set out to see it. :However he has since married a daughter of Syojatar, who tries to prevent him going, telling of marvels she has - first three pigs, then six stallions - each time the boy drives the creatures off. Finally the prince's new wife says she has eight golden boys sleeping on a smooth lawn by a large stone covered with red cloth. The boy says he would like to fetch those too - his mother tells him first she must make him food - she makes eight cakes from flour and her breast milk, and tells her son to give one to each boy. He does this and the boys wake up - they are his eight brothers - he returns with them. The king visits the stone but finds nothing and returns to his new wife disappointed, telling her he now intends to visit the island. There he is warmly welcomed by his nine sons and former wife - they are reunited and tell him their story. :The king returns to his castle and orders hot stones put in pit in the bath house, and covered with a cloth - then his new wife, daughter of Sy√∂j√§t√§r is taken to bathe - she hops into the bath-house and falls into the pit, and is burnt. The king as his former wife and sons are reunited and return to live in the king's castle. Sy√∂j√§t√§r also appears in other stories in the same collection of tales. In Part 1: Mikko Miehel√§inen; Ihmeellinen koiwu; Kummallinen tammi; Merest√§- nousija neito; Welji√§ns√§ etsij√§t ja joutsenina lent√§j√§t; Neitonen kuninkaan sadussa; and Welji√§ns√§-etsij√§ tytt√∂,, and in Part 2: Lepp√§p√∂lkky; and Awannolla kehr√§√§j√§t. Similar folklorish figures Together with akka (old woman), Sy√∂j√§t√§r fills similar roles in Finnish folklore as does Baba Yaga in Russian lore. There are also some similarities between Sy√∂j√§t√§r and Russian folklore depiction of the devil ‚Äì such as both being the origin of creatures like snakes and toads. Sy√∂j√§t√§r lacks the positive side of the ambiguous Baba Yaga ‚Äì this role is fulfilled by akka in Finnish myth.

Extensive sedimentary formations from the Eocene through recent times cover much of the island. Stratigraphy and geologic history Most rocks that outcrop on the surface on Bahrain Island and the Huwar Islands date to the Eocene in the Cenozoic. The rimrock of Eocene limestone forms a ring around the main island, with cliffs up to 30.5 meters (100 feet) tall and wind erosion features are common. An angular unconformity separates middle Eocene rocks from sandier Miocene rocks. The Rus Formation is 56.1 meters thick, encompassing the Ad Damman area in Saudi Arabia and is exposed in central Bahrain as limestone with chert and chalk layers along with quartz geodes. Boreholes indicate that the Rus Formation lies atop the Umm er Radhuma Formation. Due in part to anhydrite beds, the Rus Formation has salty brines at its base overlain by the freshwater Zone C aquifer. Limestone from the formation is widely used for concrete production. The Sharks Tooth Shale of the Dammam Formation from the middle Eocene overlies the Rus Formation with gray-yellow shale, marl and dolomite. The lowest clay-shale bed contains shark teeth fossils, giving the unit its name (it is believed to correspond with the Midra Shale in Saudi Arabia). A brown crystalline dolomite limestone layer 33 meters thick, correlated with the Khobar Member in Saudi Arabia sits atop the Sharks Tooth Shale capped by an impervious orange marl unit that separates the Zone A and Zone B aquifers. The white limestone of the Zone A aquifer ranges widely in thickness from as little as six meters to more than 62 meters. This unit is part of the broader Alat Limestone, common in Arabian Peninsula and is a major source of fresh water for the island. Miocene rocks include clay, marl, shale and sandy limestone that reaches up to 61 meters thick in the flank of the Bahrain anticline. Geologists have correlated the formation with the Dam Formation and Hadrukh Formation in Saudi Arabia as well as the Lower Fars in Iran. Recent Quaternary beach sands and salt marshes dominated large areas on several islands in the archipelago. Structural and tectonic geology Anhydrite indicates that the Eocene was marked by shallow marine conditions. Bahrain has few compressional tectonic features aside from the anticline. Uplift and regional tilting spurred erosion, resulting in the missing late Eocene and Oligocene sediments.

Third place was taken by the party Fatherland - All Russia headed by former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov. In mid-1999, Primakov and Luzhkov were considered the frontrunners for the presidency.Myers, S. L. (2015). The new Tsar: The rise and reign of Vladimir Putin.

In December 1999 Yury Luzhkov was re- elected as Mayor of Moscow, and announced that he would not compete for the presidency; Primakov pulled out two weeks after the legislative elections.

In accordance with article 92 of the Russian Constitution, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin became the Acting President, and early presidential elections were scheduled for March 2000. Strategy Putin's campaign strategy concentrated on image over policy. Rather than taking bold positions, he instead focused on cultivating the electorate's positive perception of him. Putin, who enjoyed favorable coverage on two of the three major Russian television networks, was disparaging towards the notion of running traditional televised campaign adverts. Campaign Vladimir Putin arrived in Grozny on a SU-27 fighter jet On 12 January 2000, in Moscow \\"President-hotel\\" took place the meeting of the initiative group to nominate Vladimir Putin as a presidential candidate. It included about 200 people, in particular President of Tatarstan Mintimer Shaimiev, Sergey Mironov, head of tax police Viktor Zubkov, etc. On 13 January, Vladimir Putin visited St. Petersburg State University, where he received a mantle and a diploma of honorary doctor of law. During his speech, he said that the day before\\"learned about the creation in Moscow initiative group.\\" According to Putin, he has not yet planned to announce his readiness to run for President but \\"in this solemn atmosphere I would like to say that I am pleased to accept the proposal\\".–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –¥–æ—Å—Ä–æ—á–Ω—ã—Ö –≤—ã–±–æ—Ä–æ–≤ –ø—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –†–§ –≤ 2000 –≥–æ–¥—É On 7 February, representatives of the initiative group to nominate Vladimir Putin submitted 574,128 signatures to the Central Election Commission. After a random inspection, 1.48% of them were found to be unreliable (with a maximum of 15% established by law). On 15 February, Vladimir Putin was registered as a presidential candidate, he was the third after Gennady Zyuganov and Alexey Podberezkin. On the same day, has been shaped by his campaign headquarters. Headquarters was headed by Dmitry Medvedev, who at that time held the position of Kremlin Deputy Chief of Staff. Among the leaders of the election campaign was also the FSB Deputy Director Viktor Cherkesov, chiefs of managements of Presidential Administration Alexander Abramov and Vladislav Surkov. The program and election strategy of the candidate was developed by the head of the strategic development fund Herman Gref and one of the heads of the effective policy fund Gleb Pavlovsky. One of Putin's proxies was the former Mayor of St. Petersburg Anatoly Sobchak, who died on the night of 19‚Äì20 February during a trip to Kaliningrad Oblast, undertaken as part of the election campaign. A public reception of presidential candidate Vladimir Putin was opened to organize communication with voters.Putin 2000 website archive On 25 February, Putin's election program \\"Open letter of Vladimir Putin to Russian voters\\" was published in three Federal Newspapers. In it, he stated three priorities of his policy: the fight against poverty, \\"protecting the market from illegal invasion, both official and criminal\\", the formation of foreign policy, \\"based on the national interests of their own country.\\" According to Vladimir Putin, the slogan of his election campaign \\"it is a decent life,<...> in the sense that it is wanted and believed by the majority of my fellow citizens\\". On 29 February, a draw was held for the distribution of free airtime on television and radio channels. During the election campaign, Vladimir Putin was the only presidential candidate who refused to participate in TV debates with other candidates. Putin benefited from strong approval for the Second Chechen War, which aroused strong support from Russians stinging from a loss in national prestige following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. However, some observers believed a dip in public support for the conflict at the end of the election period may have contributed to Putin carrying a smaller portion of the vote than polls had predicted him to. In the month of March, Putin saw a decline in support. Some speculation attributed this to the waning of Putin's \\"honeymoon period\\" as a new leader. Other speculation attributed this to voters paying more attention to the election at the end of the campaign period, and thus discovering aspects that the liked about Putin's opponents. Leonid Sedov, the director of the Moscow- based polling firm Public Opinion Foundation (FOM), declared that from his analysis, \\"The decline is among those people who like Putin, but do not vote for him. They have nothing against him; they think his policies are quite all right. But they were going to vote for other persons anyway.\\" In the final week before the election, Putin's campaign began an intense effort to recuperate some of the support he had lost. This partially entailed issuing attacks against the challengers that the campaign believed had captured voters away from Putin. Foremost among the candidates which the campaign focused this effort on was Grigory Yavlinsky. On the morning of 20 March, a week before the election, Vladimir Putin flew from Krasnodar to Grozny on the su-27 combat training fighter, which increased his rating.–í–∞–ª–µ—Ä–∏–π –ü–ï–¢–†–û–í (–ë–æ—Å—Ç–æ–Ω) –í–´–°–®–ò–ô –ü–ò–õ–û–¢–ê–ñ –ü–£–¢–ò–ù–ê While Putin made ample use of his advantage of incumbency to bolster his image directly through the use of the Russian military, his government opened an investigation against Yavlinsky which placed him under suspicion of illegally campaigning on a military base. On March 21, ORT (a media outlet controlled by Putin-aligned businessman Boris Berezovsky) aired numerous broadcasts which alleged that Jews, gays, and foreigners were the primary groups supporting Yavlinsky's campaign, thus painting Yavlinsky's candidacy with associations that would repulse voters who held antisemitic, homophobic or xenophobic sentiments. With the Russian populace having a strong level of animosity towards minority groups, these reports were intended to harm Yavlinsky's appeal. Putin's campaign strategist Gleb Pavlovsky denied the campaign's involvement in coordinating these reports and refuted the notion that Putin benefited from it, declaring, \\"Many mysterious and silly things happen during the campaign. I know nothing about Mr. Yavlinsky's sexual orientation, and I know nothing about events that take place in the gay community. If it was staged, it did Putin nothing but harm.\\" Platform and positions Putin opted to largely avoid taking many consequential and specific policy stances during the campaign. He instead laid out a rather vague agenda. Putin characterized Russia's military involvement in Chechnya to be both an ‚Äúanti-terrorist operation‚Äù and ‚Äúthe place where Russia's fate is being decided.‚Äù He stated, ‚ÄúUnfortunately, not everyone in Western nations understands this, but we will not tolerate any humiliation to the national pride of Russian or any threat to the territorial integrity of the country.‚Äù This indicated that Putin was in favor of reversing the 1996 agreement which had granted Chechnya de facto independence. Putin voiced support for the establishment of a ‚Äústrong state‚Äù in Russia. Putin stated, ‚ÄúRussia will not soon become, if it ever becomes, a second copy of, say, the U.S. or England, where liberal values have deep historic roots. A strong state for Russians is not an anomaly, not something that must be fought against, but on the contrary is the source and guarantor of order, the initiator and main driving force of all change‚ÄùWall Street Journal 1/3/00 Putin clarified that a strong state can mean ‚Äúa streamlined structure of the bodies of state authority and management, higher professionalism, more discipline and responsibility of civil servants, keener struggle against corruption; a restructuring of state personnel policy on the basis of a selection of the best staffs; creating conditions beneficial for the rise in the country of a full-blooded civil society to balance out and monitor the authorities; a larger role and higher authority for the judiciary; improved federative relations, including in the sphere of budgets and finances; and an active offensive on crime.‚Äù Putin advocated for the state to take a commanding role in coordinating a measured transition of the Russian economy to a free market. Putin declared that this, ‚Äúnaturally exceeds the common-place formula which limits the state's role in the economy to devising rules of the game and controlling their observance. With time, we are likely to evolve to this formula. But today's situation necessitates deeper state involvement in the social and economic processes.‚Äù Putin particularly called for the creation of an ‚Äúenergetic industrial policy‚Äù to stimulate the economy. Putin took a stance in favor of foreign investment, which he declared was integral Russian economic recovery (and without which he believed recovery would be \\"long and painful\\"). Putin took several stances on trade issues. He was in favor of Russia joining the World Trade Organization. In addition, he also advocated for counteracting discrimination other nations had adopted against Russian exports. He also called for the introduction of anti-dumping legislation to prevent other nations from exporting their toxic waste to Russia. Putin declared concern for Russia's place in the world, having stated in December 1999, ‚ÄúFor the first time in the past 200-300 years, Russia is facing a real threat of sliding to the second, and possibly even the third, echelon of world states. We must strain all intellectual physical and moral forces of the nation. Nobody will do it for us. Everything depends on us, and us alone.‚Äù Two months prior he had similarly declared, ‚ÄúWe must stop the process of our being left behind by the economically developed nations of the world, and find the path which will allow us to take up a suitable place in the ranks of leading nations in the 21st century.‚Äùhttps://pages.uoregon.edu/kimball/Putin.htmReuters 11/6/99 Putin also had written, \\"It will take us approximately fifteen years and an annual growth of our Gross Domestic Product by 8 percent a year to reach the per capita GDP level of present-day Portugal or Spain, which are not among the world's industrialized leaders.‚Äù Putin took a stance against criminal enterprise and the black market. Result Vladimir Putin won the elections in the first round, gaining more than 52% of the vote.Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation Putin under performed compared to polls, which had projected him to carry around 57% of the vote. In his acceptance address, Putin seemed to acknowledge that (despite having carried a double digit margin above any other competitor) he had only won a narrow-majority of the overall vote. Putin framed his gratitude to the Russian voters by declaring, \\"even a half-percentage point is a huge credit from the population.\\" Putin's carried a plurality in nearly every part of the country. However, he was largely able to compile a majority (and avoid a runoff) due to the strength of his performance in European Russia. Putin's showing in the Russian Far East was regarded to be disappointingly weak.

In 1661, the Biltius family moved to Amsterdam, where it settled until 1666. Between 1666 and 1670 the family resided in Maastricht. In 1671 the family returned for a few months to Amsterdam, but then moved to Flanders and settled in Antwerp.

He signed 'C. bilcius', sometimes the first name in full 'Cornelius' or in short 'Corn:' His dated works are from the period 1672 to 1686. His large-scale canvases were used as wall decorations for castles in Germany such as the Br√ºhl Palaces. Biltius created mainly trompe l'oeil compositions which are clearly influenced by similar works of his father.

Reign  He was a firstborn son of Mirza Muhammad and daughter of Husein khan Rudbar. He was later a son-in-law of Fatali khan. He was already ruling in his father's name since 1765 and was practically a vassal of Quba khanate. When Fatali khan invaded Derbent khanate in 1766, captured it's khan Muhammad Husein Khan, blinded him and sent with his son Ali to Baku and ordered Malik Muhammad to keep them as hostages. He was described as an extremely cruel ruler by Samuel Gmelin.Iskenderova M.S. The Baku Khanate, Baku: √áa≈üƒ±oƒülu, 1999, p.76 (in Russian) Although according to Azerbaijani historian Marziya Isgandarova, this could be due to the fact that khan was suspicious of him and once told him \\"Would they allow an outsider to do that in Russia?\\" when Samuel was examining oil fields in 1770. Samuel was even denied to stay inside city walls and drink water from city wells. According to Samuel, a Quba army contingent was garrisoned in Saray. After Fatali khan's invasion of Shamakhy and forcibly deposing Aghasi Khan, Avar khan (nutsal) Muhammed IV and Shaki khan Mahammadhuseyn Khan combined their forces and attacked Fatali khan. Battle was a disaster for allied forces, where Avar khan lost his brother and nephew.Leviatov V.N. Essays from the history of Azerbaijan in the XVIII century. - B .: AN ASSR, 1948. pp. 132-133 (in Russian) However, in 1774, Muhammed restored Aghasi Khan to Shirvan throne and challenged Quba khanate forces. Malik Muhammad headed his own forces to join battle where they defeated nutsal, forced him to negotiate and murdered him. This treacherous act enraged Caucasian rulers who allied their forces against Fatali Khan - new energetic Avar nutsal Umma V and Kaitag utsmi Amir Hamza rallied different Dagestani rulers to invade Quba with reinforcements from Karabakh khanate (Ibrahim Khalil khan was a son-in-law to Umma V). Battle of Gavdushan plains near Khudat in 1774 was a heavy blow to Fatali Khan's ambitions. Amir Hamza raided Baku environs and returned to Kaitag within a year. He was sent to Karabakh negotiate peace with by Fatali in 1779, where he was detained by Ibrahimkhalil khan. However, after Fatali's punitive raids, he was freed in 1781.  Death  After his release, he appointed his 11-year-old son Mirza Muhammad to be in charge of Baku during his pilgrimage to Mecca. However he died in 1784 en route near Najaf according to Bakikhanov, meanwhile other sources say he was buried in Karbala.  Family  He had two wives, one of whom was Khadija Bika (b. 1739, d. 1803), sister of Fatali Khan.

History  The Citizen was first published on November 14, 1961, having been purchased months earlier by M. Virginia Rosenbaum, a local county surveyor and Maryland's first female professional surveyor. Rosenbaum purchased The Allegany Citizen, a local weekly newspaper that had been founded in 1948, and published it under a new name, The Allegany Garrett Citizen, on August 4, 1961. Later that same year, she changed its name again to The Citizen, and the paper continued publication under this name until 1983, when the paper fell under the ownership of Mr. and Mrs. Harry M. Fox. During the years of its publication, The Citizen gave an independent view of local economic and political happenings. Though the coal industry was no longer a major employer in the region, the legacy of the industry remained part of the local identity. Major corporations such as tire manufacturer Kelly Springfield and textile manufacturer American Celanese replaced the hole in the economy left by the disappearing coal industry; later, The Citizen would document the decline and eventual demise of both companies in the 1980s.

Erosion has played a major role in Yemen's geologic history and eliminated many rock units over time. Stratigraphy, tectonics and geological history Schist formations cut by intrusions of Precambrian granite outcrop in the center, north and northwest. These formations show evidence of intense folding and regional metamorphism. Much of Yemen was converted to a peneplain during a long period of erosion in the Precambrian. =Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)= Dark shales show some signs of folding and the presence of marine rocks indicates a marine transgression in the Cambrian through the Silurian. However, little is known about the Paleozoic due to widespread erosion which eliminated almost all rocks from the time. Leached, quartz soil developed. The Wajid Sandstone is the redeposited remains of the peneplain ground surface, which formed a delta and dunes in the Permian. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= Basins formed in Yemen during a warm period in the Mesozoic, depositing dark-gray and gray-black shales of the Kohlan Series at the bottom of large lakes. Gypsum lenses formed in isolated bays around the same period. During the Malm, a major marine transgression flooded much of the region depositing the calcareous Amran Series. Northwest of San'a Bathonian and Callovian carbonates lie atop the Kohlan Series in a depression. To the north, a higher proportion of chalk suggests a later transgression in the Callovian and Oxfordian along with stromatoporoid fossils. Subsidence zones formed in the Ramlat as Sab'atayn desert area in the southwest. In southwest Yemen, Jurassic sedimentary rocks lie directly atop Precambrian basement rock. Continental conditions returned for much of the Jurassic and Cretaceous, except in lagoons where gypsum and salt deposited. The Tawilah Group is an example of Cretaceous sandy conglomerate protected from subsequent erosion by the overlying Trap Series. Shallow basins continued to fill with sand as formations became tilted. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)= A shallow sea filled much of central Yemen forming units such as the Medj-zir Series during the Paleocene. Faulted beds formed while terrestrial erosion stripped away many Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks. Intense volcanism had started in the Cretaceous and continued into the Cenozoic. Lava flows and tuff is up to thick in the Trap Series in the southwest, while laccolith intrusions are common to the north. The Trap Series became intercalated with the river and lake sediments during a quiet period in the Oligocene and Miocene. In the west, the Trap Series is penetrated by granite intrusions from renewed tectonic activity. Basalt flow and craters from the last 2.5 million years of the Quaternary are common near San'a, Dhamar and Ma'rib along with large loess deposits. Mountains In the west, particularly near the border with Saudi Arabia, are the Sarat Mountains. This ranges includes the Haraz Mountains to the west of the capital city, Sanaa. The Haraz include Jabal An-Nabi Shu'ayb, the highest mountain in the Arabian Peninsula. In the east, particularly near the border with Oman, are the Hadhramaut Mountains.

The election was presided by Peter of Aspelt, Archbishop of Mainz and member of the pro-Luxembourg party. Like the past election, of seven electors only four attended the meeting: * Peter of Aspelt, Archbishop-Elector of Mainz * Baldwin of Luxembourg, brother of Henry VII and Archbishop-Elector of Mainz * John, son of Henry VII and King-Elector of Bohemia * Waldemar of Stendal, Elector of Brandenburg * John II of Lauenburg, claimant Elector of Saxony against Rudolf I of Wittenberg As a result of the election, Louis IV, Duke of Bavaria was elected Holy Roman Emperor. However, due to the unrecognized claim of John II of Lauenburg, the election was considered invalid by the electors who supported Frederick the Fair. The two contested elections caused the eruption of a civil war inside the Holy Roman Empire, fought between pro-Luxembourg and pro-Habsburg parties. Louis was successfully crowned at Aachen - the customary site of coronations - by Archbishop of Mainz, while the Archbishop of Cologne, who by custom had the right to crown the new king, crowned Frederick at Bonn. In the following conflict between the kings, Louis recognized in 1316 the independence of Switzerland from the Habsburg dynasty. After several years of bloody war, victory finally seemed within the grasp of Frederick, who was strongly supported by his brother Leopold. However, Frederick's army was decisively defeated in the Battle of M√ºhldorf on 28 September 1322 on the Ampfing Heath, where Frederick and 1300 nobles from Austria and Salzburg were captured.

Initially, the asylum hosted four inmates, increasing to nine by 1824. Neave joined Fry's British Ladies' Society for Promoting the Reformation of Female Prisoners after members of the group were impressed by the asylum. In 1825, Neave headed a subcommittee to establish and run Royal Manor Hall Asylum in Chelsea, an asylum for 'vicious female children' such as shoplifters that would later be taken over by Neave's Royal Female Philanthropic Society. The asylum used solitary confinement instead of corporal punishment, and prepared the children for marriage or domestic service. Queen Victoria contributed fifty pounds to the running of Royal Manor Hall Asylum. By 1848, the Royal Manor Hall Asylum had hosted more than six hundred inmate. In 1853, Neave gave evidence to the Select Committee on Criminal and Destitute Children. Through her career, she also worked in prisons, refuges and convict-ships.

She is an internationally recognised Human Geneticist who has focused on the application of cutting edge genomic technologies to study the spectrum of human genetic variation associated with cardio-metabolic and immune diseases. She has led many large-scale discovery efforts including more than 1,000 novel genetic variants associated with cardio-metabolic diseases and their risk factors as well as establishing the HaemGen consortium, which is a worldwide effort to discover genetic determinants of blood cell formation and also interpretation of the downstream consequences of sequence variation through a host of integrative analyses and functional approaches. Soranzo has co-authored over 180 papers (>46,000 citations; H-index 98)., delivered over 100 lectures to national and international meetings and has had numerous scientific advisory roles.  Education  Soranzo graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Milan in Italy, and completed her PhD at the University of Dundee on genetic variation in native European populations of Scots pine.  Career and research  After her postdoctoral training in quantitative population and statistical genetics at University College London (UK), Soranzo worked for the pharmaceutical company, Johnson and Johnson in the US, where she used human genetics to assist drug discovery and pharmacogenomics. In 2007, she returned to the UK to work at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and in 2009 started her own group there. She became a Principal of Research at the University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine in 2013, and a Professor of Human Genetics in 2015. Soranzo's group's research efforts aim at understanding how genetic factors interact with other non-genetic and epigenetic factors to influence phenotypic variation. They use large-scale genome sequencing data, epigenetic profiling and molecular traits such as gene expression and metabolomics. Prof. Soranzo and her team have generated rich genomic data resources for the scientific community, such as whole-genome sequence and phenotype data for population cohorts in the UK10K project, and a large genetic and epigenetic database for different blood cell types in the Blueprint project. The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Blood and Transplant Research Units (BTRU) Genetics Theme, led by Soranzo, was motivated by a need of the National Health Service (NHS) Blood and Transplant Unit to move towards a more personalised service. Results are expected to contribute to understanding of how individual genetic profiles affect disease risk and treatment in the population at large, informing the implementation of personalised medicine strategies in the UK. Soranzo chaired the UK10K Cohorts project, one of the first to use whole-genome sequencing to investigate the role of rare genetic variants and the Human Variation working group of the EU FP7 Blueprint project, an international effort to characterise the interplay of genetic and epigenetic factors on gene expression in three main immune cell types. Soranzo is currently the leader of the Genetics Theme of the NIHR Blood & Transplant Research Unit (BTRU) in Population Health and Genomics, focusing on determinants of blood donation related biomarkers. = Awards and honours= * 2019 Elected Fellow of the European Molecular Biology Organisation(EMBO) * 2018 Elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) * 2016 Italian Female Researcher and Scientist of Impact, National Observatory for Women's Health, Italy * 2016 Highly Cited Researcher, Thomson Reuters * 2015 Highly Cited Researcher, Thomson Reuters * 2014 Movers and Shakers in BioBusiness, BioBeats, UK * 2014 Top Italian Scientist, Virtual Italian Academy, Italy * 2014 Highly Cited Researcher, Thomson Reuters * 2012 Suffrage Science Heirloom Award (by Dame Sally Davies), Medical Research Council (MRC) CSC, UK * 2010 Paula und Richard von Hertwig-Preis for International Cooperation, Germany References Fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences 21st-century Italian scientists Italian women scientists Italian geneticists Year of birth missing (living people) Living people ","title":"Nicole Soranzo"},{"id":"58319957","title":"2018 Cassis Open Provence"},{"id":"58319961","text":"Bought to Rot is the debut solo full-length album by Laura Jane Grace, best known as founder and leader of Against Me!. The record was released under the pseudonym Laura Jane Grace & The Devouring Mothers, referring to the group's members: Grace herself, Atom Willard (current drummer of Against Me!) and Marc Hudson (long-time sound engineer and collaborator with Against Me!). The album was released on November 9, 2018, on Bloodshot Records, a Chicago label that Grace approached when she discovered the label's headquarters was a few blocks from her residence. The album's title refers to the difficulty of Grace having written the album's songs, but feeling that they were not suitable for an Against Me! record, which was expected to be the album Grace would release in 2018. Background and recording Laura Jane Grace announced in July 2018 that the band she had performed previous solo tours with since 2016, The Devouring Mothers, had recently completed Grace's second solo record together, to be released on Bloodshot Records in Autumn 2018. The band's members since its inception have been Grace and Willard from Against Me!, as well as long- time producer and collaborator Marc Hudson. The album is said to be heavily influenced by the works of Rowland S. Howard and Tom Petty, and includes collaborations with other artists. Despite Bought to Rot being announced and released as the first record with The Devouring Mothers, it is in fact the second album the trio have recorded together. The first album recorded by the three was done so in 2017, and was entirely made up of the Mountain Goats covers, which approached record labels refused to release due to its lack of originality.https://youtube.com/11GZjbaVrQI&t;=660 Following a period of turbulence in Against Me!, the songs were recorded quickly in order to have them finalised before Grace underwent surgery shortly after the record's release, so as not to have the songs \\"rot\\" like surplus groceries bought. Grace later confirmed in January 2019 that she had undergone facial feminisation surgery as part of her transition.

Both officers reported to Colonel Montague James, the leader of Trelawny Town.  Second Maroon War  In 1795, when the Second Maroon War broke out between the Jamaican Maroons of Trelawny Town and the British colonial authorities in Jamaica, Charles Samuels fought on the side of the maroons. A year later, Colonel George Walpole persuaded them to lay down arms on a promise that they would not be deported from the island. The governor, Alexander Lindsay, 6th Earl of Balcarres, reversed that promise on a technicality, and deported Samuels and just under 600 Trelawny Maroons to Nova Scotia.Mavis Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 209-249. On the ship's voyage to Nova Scotia, 17 maroons died, and another 19 perished in the harsh Nova Scotian winter of 1796-7.Michael Siva, After the Treaties: A Social, Economic and Demographic History of Maroon Society in Jamaica, 1739-1842, PhD Dissertation (Southampton: Southampton University, 2018), p. 145.  Exile in Nova Scotia  Montague James sent a number of petitions to the British government in London, as well as the colonial authorities in Jamaica, complaining about the cold and unfriendly conditions they encountered in Canada.R.C. Dallas,The History of the Maroons (1803), Vol. 2, p. 256. Many of the petitions were sent to Walpole, who had become a Whig member of parliament, where he complained about the deportation of the maroons from Jamaica. Montague James sent Charles Samuels from Nova Scotia to London, where he became a paid servant of Walpole, and provided him with information about the poor conditions being endured by the maroons in Nova Scotia.Grant, John N. (2002). The Maroons in Nova Scotia. Halifax: Formac. pp. 126‚Äì9.Robin Winks, The Blacks in Canada (Montreal: McGill University, 1997), pp. 86-7. On his return trip from London to Nova Scotia, the ship Samuels was on was captured by the French. Imprisoned for several months, Samuels willingly told the French all he knew about Nova Scotia. Eventually freed, he returned to Nova Scotia, where the governor, Sir John Wentworth, tried in vain to find out what Samuels told the French.Grant, Maroons in Nova Scotia, p. 130.  Relocation to Sierra Leone  The information provided by Samuels to Walpole contributed to the success of James in getting the Trelawny Maroons removed from Nova Scotia. In 1800, about 550 Maroons left Nova Scotia for Sierra Leone. In Sierra Leone, the Jamaican Maroons helped the British to put down a revolt by the Black Nova Scotians, after which the Jamaican Maroons in Sierra Leone received the best land and houses.Dallas, History of the Maroons, Vol. 2, p. 287.Simon Schama, Rough Crossings (London: BBC Books, 2002), p. 382.

Since 2 November 2006, it has been a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank and since 27 July 2012 purely a direct bank. History The roots of Norisbank date back to the year 1954. Starting that year, the mail-order company Quelle offered to finance its products via the Noris purchase aid. On 4 June 1965, the Noris Kreditbank GmbH was founded in Nuremberg. The business objective was to expand the financing of the entire supply of Quelle and its subsidiaries in the mail order and in the stationary sector. In the year 1969 the Noris purchase aid changed its name to Noris Bank GmbH. The name change was accompanied by an expansion of the product range to include banking services such as checking and savings accounts. In 1984, the Norisbank GmbH merged with the Hamburg Verbraucherbank GmbH. The reason for the takeover of the previously independent Verbraucherbank GmbH was the acquisition of the first German customer self-service system. The Verbraucherbank had introduced the customer self-service in 1975 as the first financial institution in Germany, 1977 one of the first ATMs worldwide followed as well as the first online banking offer in Germany in 1980. The Noris Verbraucherbank GmbH was part of the Quelle Group until the end of 1997 and was sold to Bayerische Vereinsbank on 19 June 1997. It merged the Noris Verbraucherbank GmbH with the Franken WKV Bank GmbH (founded in 1950). In January 1999, the Hypo Service Bank (HSB), founded in 1991, was integrated into Norisbank AG. In 2000, Norisbank AG was the first bank on the Internet to offer loans with an online instant pledge. After uncertainties in 2002, when the HypoVereinsbank was considering integrating the Norisbank into its own branch network, it was decided in December 2002 to sell the Norisbank. On 1 October 2003, DZ Bank became the new owner of Norisbank AG for a purchase price of EUR 180 million. On August 3, 2006, the DZ Bank sold the 98 branches and the brand name Norisbank for 420 million Euros to the Deutsche Bank, which also took over the customer base. The Norisbank AG based in Nuremberg then renamed to Teambank AG Nuremberg, while the sold branches were continued by the newly founded Norisbank GmbH based in Frankfurt am Main. Corporate Development In July 2005, the Norisbank AG entered a new business field: the sale of its consumer credit easy credit, which was completely detached from other banking services, via installment credit stores in city centers, shopping malls and arterial roads in the city. Over the years, this market strategy has attracted 500,000 new customers. However, not all credit customers could be won as regular customers. In August 2006, the bank had around 650,000 customers. In the course of the sale to the Deutsche Bank some services were limited: Thus, the number of self-service terminals in the branches was reduced, there were no online foreign transfers possible and the cash counter no longer accepted coins. On January 1, 2008, the classic counter traffic was completely ended. Since then, the branches have only been advisory offices with self-service zones. By the sale of Norisbank to the Deutsche Bank Group the Norisbank resigned from the ATM network CashPool on October 31, 2006 and returned to the Cash Group. Because of its former affiliation with Hypovereinsbank, the Norisbank was already a member of the Cash Group until 2003. The new business model saw itself as a direct bank with branches. In the 90 branches, customers were able to receive advice on issues such as investments and pension plans. Despite the advice in the branch, branch customers received the same conditions as through direct sales. On 1 October 2008, the headquarter was moved to Berlin. As part of the restructuring, all branches were closed on 27 July 2012 and the Norisbank converted into a direct bank. Since then, banking transactions have been conducted by customers primarily via the Internet, via telephone banking and via the self-service terminals in Deutsche Bank's branches. The 400 former branch employees were transferred without notice to Postbank, also a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. Today, the Norisbank employs around fifty people (mainly in management), and a large part of its banking services are provided by other employees within the Deutsche Bank Group. Since December 2014, Bonn is the seat of the Norisbank.

She was a founder in 2000/2001 of the \\"Garden of Women\\" (\\"Garten der Frauen\\") at the vast Ohlsdorf Cemetery on the edge of Hamburg.  Biography  Rita Bake was born in Bremerhaven. She studied for a degree in librarianship at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences. After that she moved on to the University of Hamburg where she studied Social and Economic History and Folklore along with Early and Pre-History. She concluded this phase of her education with a doctorate. The work for her dissertation concerned women's employment in the manufacturing sector in pre-industrial Germany.Bake, Rita (Verfasser): Vorindustrielle Frauenerwerbsarbeit : Arbeits- u.

The agency publishes detailed information on social and regional history of Hamburg, also covering politics and political institutions. There has, during Bake's time at the agency, been an increased focus on women's history. The agency also designs and implements historically based city tours and exhibitions. In 2000, with the active help of the historian-politician Silke Urbanski and of the journalist-politician Helga Diercks-Norden, Rita Bake founded the \\"Garden of Women\\" (\\"Garten der Frauen\\") at Hamburg's Ohlsdorf Cemetery. It is claimed to be only place of its kind in the world. All three women were feminist activists. The \\"Garden\\" is a memorial location for significant women, to which historical grave stones can be transferred after heirs and representatives of the deceased are no longer able (or willing) to pay for the upkeep of the grave in its original location. It is also available as a last resting place for significant women who had died since its inception. Since 2000 Rita Bake has served as chair of the (exclusively voluntary) \\"Garden of Women Association\\".Rita Bake: Der Garten der Frauen.

At the time of the project launch Bake was asked about the gender separation implicit in the whole idea: \\"Are not all people equal, at least in death?\\". The question was one which Bake had evidently considered already: \\"Sadly, no. Because the achievements of women are often not adequately valued while they are alive, they will be forgotten even more quickly after death than in the case of men\\". Since 2007 she has teamed up with fellow historian Beate Meyer of the \\"Institute for the History of German Jewry in Hamburg\\" to head up and work as compiler-editor for the series, \\"Stolpersteine in the districts of Hamburg\\". 17 volumes had already appeared by September 2016.

Function microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein- coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA.

Background  Following the death in 1313 of Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor, two rival factions elected both Frederick and Louis King of the Romans at separate elections on October 19 and October 20, 1314. A war ensued between their partisans in the Empire. On September 18, 1322, at the Battle of M√ºhldorf, Louis decisively defeated Frederick and took him captive to be imprisoned at Trausnitz Castle. This did not end the resistance of Frederick's brother Leopold I, Duke of Austria, who ruled Austria and Styria in his absence, or earn the support of the pope, Pope John XXII, for his claim. In fact, John excommunicated Louis in 1324.  The treaty  In response to the military pressure from Leopold and the political pressure from John, Louis released Frederick from captivity. In exchange, Frederick agreed to recognize Louis as King of the Romans and to convince his brother Leopold to end his resistance. If he could not do the latter, he agreed to return to captivity.  Aftermath  Frederick failed to convince Leopold to accept Louis as King of the Romans to make peace. True to his word, he submitted to captivity in Munich later that year.

She entered the Royal Academy of Music and on leaving she demonstrated her abilities as a soprano singer at Covent Garden, although her acting abilities were unimpressive. She was known as Miss Grant and she appeared in a play about Rob Roy MacGregor, Guy Mannering and Isidore de Merida with the tenor John Braham. She retired and married an older landowner, Temple West, in 1831. When he died in 1839 she moved in from the provinces and took a house at 29 Half Moon Street in London. Pencarrow House She married Sir William Molesworth, 8th Baronet after a one-month engagement on 9 July 1844. His family were not keen given her lack of background and that she was maybe too old to deliver an heir. Sir William had enjoyed the support of Harriet Grote and her husband, but Harriet broke with him over his marriage. An ambitions and scheming character in Dickens' Bleak House was said to be based on Molesworth. She became known as a hostess inviting notable people to stay at Pencarrow House in Cornwall including Charles Dickens, Sir Arthur Sullivan and Emperor Napoleon III. George Byng, 7th Viscount Torrington was her companion after she became a widow. When she died she left her fortune to Byng's nephew and heir as she was estranged from her dead husband's family. However she still remembered her last husband and in 1869 she had the Molesworth Mausoleum constructed at Kensal Green Cemetery.

In practice, almost all those formally admitted to the office of Evangelist are members of the Anglican mission and outreach agency, the Church Army. Evangelist is one of the commonly acknowledged lay ministries of the Anglican Communion internationally, along with the ministries of Lay reader, and Deaconess. Christian evangelism Evangelism is a universal Christian practice, and all baptised Christians have a role in the work of propagating the Christian Gospel. In this sense, all Christians are evangelists. The Bible makes reference to certain individuals having a specific ministry under the title evangelist, for example, Ephesians 4:11, \\"The gifts he gave were that some would be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers.\\" It is possible that certain early Christians bore the title evangelist within the Christian community, for which Acts 21:8 is often cited: \\"The next day we left and came to Caesarea; and we went into the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the seven, and stayed with him.\\" In the contemporary Anglican Church, many lay people carry out specific ministries of evangelism, and some have formed support groups or formal associations to promote their work together, such as the Fellowship for Parish Evangelism. On 11 October 1999 the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York formally inaugurated the \\"College of Evangelists\\" which \\"exists to recognise and affirm evangelists whose ministry is nationwide or at least beyond the confines of any diocese\\", and is supported by the Church Army. The College of Evangelists provides a central forum for those formally admitted to the office of evangelist, and those who have undergone local training and admission to a particular ministry on a more informal basis. Office of Evangelist In 1882 the Revd Wilson Carlile founded the Church Army, commissioning a number of officers to work in outreach projects. A number of similar organisations were also being founded within the Church of England, and Carlile advanced the case for the formal recognition of an office of Evangelist within the ministry of the Anglican Church. In 1883 the office was acknowledged. Candidates for the office of evangelist are selected through the Church Army, in a process of profiling, interviewing, and practical placements, usually lasting from 18 to 24 months. Those selected then receive formal training, which was previously residential training at the Church Army College, originally in Oxford, then in Blackheath (from the 1960s), and finally in Sheffield (from the 1990s). Today most candidates in Britain and Ireland train part-time over several years, with the training including residential courses at the Sheffield headquarters of Church Army Britain & Ireland. Church Army organisations in other parts of the world (Church Army Africa, Church Army Australia, Church Army Barbados, Church Army Jamaica, Church Army New Zealand, Church Army United States; and Threshold Ministries, previously Church Army Canada) have similar training courses for evangelists within their jurisdictions. Although Church Army officers are selected and trained by the Church Army, most are deployed for subsequent work by local parishes and dioceses. When training is complete, the candidate is formally commissioned to the office of evangelist by a bishop. In the Church of England, where the office originated, all commissioned evangelists receive their licence directly from the Archbishop of the Province in which they are commissioned (the Archbishop of York in northern England, or the Archbishop of Canterbury in southern England), even though their ministry will be approved and supervised by the bishop of the local diocese in which they are posted. The commissioning of evangelists sometimes takes place at the Archbishops' official residences of Bishopthorpe Palace and Lambeth Palace. Liturgical role The ministry of an evangelist is primarily a pastoral one. Nonetheless, most commissioned evangelists are attached to a parish church, and may have a liturgical role, particularly in preaching. Commissioned evangelists who are robed for a formal liturgy are entitled to wear a cherry red tippet, traditionally of the short \\"collar\\" type. In some parts of the Anglican Communion, including Africa and the Caribbean, these traditional collar tippets are still commonly worn. In other parts, including the British Isles, there is an increasing tendency for a full length tippet (also known as a \\"preaching scarf\\") in cherry red to be worn by commissioned evangelists. In other areas, including North America, commissioned evangelists rarely wear any liturgical clothing.

His brother, Charles Samuels, was also an officer from Trelawny Town, and both officers reported to Colonel Montague James. Second Maroon War As the population of Trelawny Town grew in the second half of the eighteenth century, Andrew Smith set up a satellite village of his own in the rural Westmoreland Parish.Michael Siva, After the Treaties: A Social, Economic and Demographic History of Maroon Society in Jamaica, 1739-1842, PhD Dissertation (Southampton: Southampton University, 2018), p. 46. When the Second Maroon War broke out between Trelawny Town and the colonial authorities, the militias destroyed Smith's village. As a result, Smith joined the Trelawny Maroons as they fought against the forces of Governor Alexander Lindsay, 6th Earl of Balcarres. When General George Walpole eventually persuaded the Trelawny Maroons to lay down their arms on a promise that they would not be deported, Smith was one of the first to surrender. However, Balcarres exploited a clause in the treaty to claim that most of the maroons did not surrender in time, and ordered their deportation.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 150-1. https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/423482/1/LIBRARY_COPY_After_The_Treaties_Final.pdf Smith was one of a handful of maroons to have met the deadline, and he was offered the opportunity to remain in Jamaica. However, he was so outraged by the governor's duplicity that he chose to go with the rest of the Trelawny maroons into exile.Mavis Campbell, Back to Africa: George Ross and the Maroons (Trenton: Africa World Press, 1993), pp. 5-7. While they were in detention, Smith curried favour with the colonial authorities by identifying a number of runaway slaves who had fought on the side of Trelawny Town. When they reached Nova Scotia, Smith was regarded by his fellow maroons as a traitor. In a letter to his half-brother Samuels from Nova Scotia in 1797, Smith complained that the maroons hated him and that they wanted to kill him. Walpole reported that Smith did not get on with other maroon officers such as Leonard Parkinson and James Palmer. John Grant, The Maroons in Nova Scotia (Halifax: Formac, 2002), p. 116.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 179-180. However, most maroon officers remained loyal to the runaways who fought on their side, and hundreds of them gained their freedom as a result of the conflict.Michael Sivapragasam (2019) \\"The Second Maroon War: Runaway Slaves fighting on the side of Trelawny Town\\", Slavery & Abolition, DOI: 10.1080/0144039X.2019.1662683 https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/PEX47HQYJUGEEZRJY6DE/full?target=10.1080/0144039X.2019.1662683 Retrieved 10 September 2019. Sierra Leone and England On the journey to Sierra Leone, Smith joined James in complaining about corruption in the distribution of provisions by another maroon officer, Major Jarrett. On investigating the proceedings, superintendent George Ross found that James and Smith were correct, and he dismissed John Jarrett from his post.Mavis Campbell, Back to Africa, pp. 5-7. It appears that Smith was unhappy with his position among the Jamaican Maroons in Sierra Leone, and he shortly afterwards migrated to England. In 1805, two Maroons from Sierra Leone, John Thorp or Thorpe and Andrew Smith, were recorded as living in Clapham in London, and they had their teenaged sons baptised there.Baptisms in the Parish of Clapham 1805, P95/TRI 1/092 (London Metropolitan Archives). Thorpe became a lawyer, but there is no evidence what happened to Smith, who probably died in England shortly afterwards.West, Richard, Back to Africa: A History of Sierra Leone and Liberia (London: Jonathan Cape Ltd, 1970), p. 163.

It was a turning point in the Operativo Independencia, a domestic Argentine military intervention aimed at eradicating Communist presence in Tucum√°n province, as well as eliminating so-called subversive elements. This action received nationwide media coverage due to the presence of two journalists from the Gente magazine at the time.  Background  The PRT-ERP learned of a daily military supply transport between Acheral and Taf√≠ del Valle and decided to carry out an ambush on 7 October. On that day, the guerrillas detected a nearby Army task force and opted to attack it. A guerrilla and a soldier perished in the subsequent fighting. In the early hours of 8 October, a conscript and Jorge Carlos Molina (nom de guerre \\"captain Pablo\\") were killed in another Army ambush. During the next 48 hours, another two skirmishes near the Santa Luc√≠a sugar mill resulted in the deaths of Oscar Asdr√∫bal Santucho (nom de guerre \\"captain An√≠bal\\") and Manuel Negr√≠n (nom de guerre \\"lieutenant Roberto\\").  Battle  Santucho had ordered the supply of armament to a thirteen-man National Logistics team in the San Gabriel stream, along National Route 38. At 06:00, the guerrillas were detected hiding in a reedbed. This information reached a task force at 10:30, which in turn relayed it to its superior officers, who ordered three Bell UH-1 Iroquois attack helicopters to be sent to the area. At 11:38, during the third reconnaissance flight over the area, one of the helicopters detected one or two ERP fighters and opened fire. The guerrillas responded with concentrating fire, killing its door gunner and damaging its electrical system. The pilot, who was also wounded, made an emergency landing 80 meters from the site. Meanwhile, ground troops opened fire at the guerrillas. At noon, another helicopter fired two 70mm air-to-ground rockets, setting the reedbed on fire. General Vilas arrived an hour later in a third helicopter along with two journalists. The strafing and rocket attacks carried on until after 17:00. A mopping-up operation began after another two reconnaissance flights and the arrival of reinforcements. By 19:00, all thirteen guerrillas had been killed. Their bodies were later transported in Unimog trucks to be shown to the press.  Aftermath  The Mountain Company held a meeting between 15 and 16 October in which demobilization and retreat towards the cities of C√≥rdoba and Buenos Aires was decided. Author Juan Bautista Yofre claims that this action marked the ERP rural front's \\"near definitive\\" defeat.

Following the First World War, the Ministry of Defense of Czechoslovakia decided to create a medium sized music band. After a number of reorganizations, the band began to serve as the band of the 4th Infantry Regiment in 1945. Just 5 years later on 1 December 1950, the Central Music Service of the Czechoslovak People's Army was founded with close to 160 musicians in its ranks. Its first commander was Colonel Hynek Sluka, with his deputy being Major Karel Stastny. At the time, the Bands of the ƒåSLA was made up of three smaller groups of musicians (the other two groups being based in Hradec Kr√°lov√© and Olomouc). The new band became an independent unit within the 80th Infantry Battalion \\"The Prague Uprising\\".http://www.ustrednihudba.army.cz/z-historie-orchestru Repertoire and musical training The Fanfare of President of the Czech Republic Besides classical music for the wind orchestra and marching music for the brass band,https://www.rundel.de/de/brass_ensemble_of_the_czech_army_central_band/p-3/1586 the army band performs melodies from popular films and songs from musical groups such as Queen and the Beatles.

Most musicians are graduates of the Jan√°ƒçek Academy of Music and Performing Arts (JAMU) or Prague Academy of Performing Arts (AMU). The training the band receives from JAMU and AMU is often reflected in the artistic quality of the band and the complexity of their performances. Collaborations The band often cooperates with many national organizations that provide musical accompaniment during its events. The most notable Czech organizations the band has worked with includes Czech Radio (ƒåRo), where the band often plays Kde domov m≈Øj during newshours, as well as the Moravian Philharmonic Orchestra, of whom the band usually performs in joint concerts. As a NATO member, and a member of the European Union, the band also frequently tours Europe to be participants in many international festivals and performances that are held in countries like Denmark, Poland, Austria, Scotland,http://www.army.cz/en/ministry-of-defence/newsroom/news/central-band- and-ondras-ensemble-excel-at-the-edinburgh-tattoo-festival-202196/ Germany, Norway,https://www.mzv.cz/static/146550-1-MZV/en/current_news/norwegian_military_tattoo_2012.html and Italy.

The estate traces its history back to the 13th century but the current asymmetrical complex of single-storey, white-washed buildings surrounding a central courtyard was constructed for Hans Didrik Brinck- Seidelin in 1747 with the exception of the remains of a tower built by Johan Friis in 1555. The estate has been owned by members of the Castenskiold family since 1769. History =Middle Ages= Johan Friis Hagestedg√•rd is first mentioned in the Danish Census Book from 1230 when it was owned by the Crown and known as \\"Hakast√¶the\\", It is only mentioned sporadically during the following centuries but the estate probably served as a fief. Vassals included Peder Jensen Pilegrim in 1347, Markvard Tiinhuus in 1502 and Otte Tiinhuus in 1521 and 1540. In 1540, Hagestedgaard was granted to chancellor Johan Friis in exchange for property in Odsherred and the estate was at the same time expanded with land from the shut-down village of Orderup. Friis was for many years one of the most influential men in the country. Through marriage, the estate was transferred from the Friis family to the Huitfeldts. It was later passed on to Henrik Thott through his marriage to a daughter of Henrik Huitfeldt. The ravages and looting of Swedish troops during the Dano-Swedish War economically ruined Thott. Thomas Bartholin =1658‚Äì1704: Thomas and Caspar Bartholin= In 1663, Thott had to sell Hagestedg√•rd to Thomas Bartholin. Bartholin, who was just 44 years old at the time, retired from the university and settled on the estate. The main building, rectory and eight farmhouses were destroyed by fire in 1670. Bartholin's vast library and many of his works were lost. As compensation, Christian V granted him tax exemption, contributed with building materials for the rebuilding of the house and appointed him as court physician. Bartholin's son Caspar Bartholin took over the estate after his father's death. He sold the estate to Laurits Jacobsen in 1575 but reacquired it in 1695. =1704‚Äì1740: Changing owners= Bartholin then sold Hagestedgaard, for a second time, to Ursula von Putbus in 1704. She had become a widow after just one and a half years of marriage to the nobleman Knud Thott in October 1702. Ole Bornamann (1673-1725), a district judge of Zealand and M√∏n and the owner of N√∏rager at Kalundborg, purchased the estate in 1709. Peder Benzon, another district judge, acquired the estate in 1712. He purchased Gjeddesdal from his brother Lars Benzon in 1714 and sold Hagestedgaard to him in 1715. Willum Worm (1698-1737), a civil servant and poet, purchased Hagestedgaard from Lars Bentzon in 1725. He sold the estate to Rachel Sophie Marschalk Fletscher in 1727. =1740‚Äì1769: The Seidelin family= Hans Didrik Brinck-Seidelin Hans Seidelin purchased Hagestedg√•rd in 1730. A favourite of the new king Christian VI, he had just been appointed to Post Master-General of the Royal Danish Mail, Director of the Royal Vajsen House and judge at the Hofretten. The purchase of Hagestedg√•rd emphasized his new position in society and he was ennobled the following year. Seidelin's son, Hans Hansen Seidelin, who inherited Hagestedg√•rd in 1740, had no male heirs. After his death, Hagestedg√•rd was therefore endowed to his nephew, Hans Diderik Brinck-Seidelin, with the intention to turn it into a stamhus (family trust) for future generations of the family. This happened when Brinck- Seidelin, in 1752, founded Stamhuset Hagested from the estates of Hagestedgaard, Holb√¶k Ladeg√•rd and Eriksholm. Hagestedgaards was, however, with royal approbation, already sold in 1769. =1769‚Äìpresent: The Castenschiold family= The new owner was Carl Adolph von Castenschiold. His son, Christian Ludvig Castenschiold sold Hagestedgaard to his cousin Casper Holten Grevencop-Castenschiold in 1825, due to economic difficulties. His son of the same name (1809-1882), who inherited the estate in 1854, sold the tenant farms to the tenants on favourable conditions. He had one son and three daughters. One of the daughters, Severine Jacobine Grevencop-Castenschiold, married the prominent archaeologist Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae. The couple did not own the estate but lived there for extended periods of time. Worsaae died there in 1885. Hagestedgaard in c. 1900 Grevencop-Castenschiold's widow, Cathrine Marie Louise Grevencop-Castenschiold, n√©e Jensen, kept Hagestedgaard until 1901. The estate was then passed on to their son, Casper Holten Jens Peter Grevenkop-Castenskiold (1845-1937). His only child, Addie Grevenkop- Castenskiold (1878-1963), married Baron Wilhelm Lerche (1857-1916), a son of Count Vilhelm Cornelius Magnus Lerche of Birkendegaard, on 19 may 1908. She inherited Hagestedgaard in 1937. Her only child, Esther, Baroness Lerche, who had been born on the estate in 1909 (died 1986), married Frants Hvass (1896-1982), a diplomat, on 17 September 1949. She bought the Hagestedgaard estate from her mother in 1953. She passed the estate on to their son Anders Michael Hvass om 1975. He was a chamberlain and Master of the Hunt (Hofj√¶germester). Architecture Most of the buildings seen today were built for Hans Didrik Brinck-Seidelin in 1748. It is an asymmetrical complex of single-storey, white-washed buildings surrounding a central courtyard. The buildings are built with timber framing on foundations of fieldstone and have roofs clad with winged, red tile. The main wing is located on the west side of the courtyard and incorporates the remains of a tower and a barrel-vaulted cellar built by Johan Friis in 1555. The tower has a pyramid roof. To the east of the central courtyard are two L-shaped residential wings surrounding an extra courtyard. Two small pavilions with half-hip roofs are located on the north side of the central courtyard. Today The current owner is Henning Hvass. The estate covers 555 hectares of land of which 336 hectares are farmland, eng 84 hectares are pastures and 89 hectares are Forest.

Biography  Guido Maria Casullo was born on May 27, 1909, in Monteleone di Puglia, then a municipality in the Province of Avellino, but nowadays in the Apulian Province of Foggia. He was baptized on June 2 of that year. On November 4, 1920, he entered the Diocesan Seminary of Ariano di Puglia (now Ariano Irpino) and was ordained a deacon on January 6, 1932. He was then ordained a priest on July 16, 1932. On May 27, 1951, Casullo was appointed the Bishop of Nusco and was ordained to the episcopate on July 15, 1951, in the Ariano Irpino Cathedral. Archbishop Agostino Mancinelli acted as principal consecrator, while Bishops Gioacchino Pedicini and Pasquale Venezia acted as co-consecrators. As a bishop, he took as his Latin episcopal motto \\",\\" which translates as \\"For all the hope of life.\\" Casullo served as a Conciliar Father in all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council, where he insisted on the role of missionary work. On February 11, 1963, given a choice between being assigned to Africa or Brazil, he was appointed as an auxiliary bishop in the Diocese of Pinheiro in Brazil. At the same time, he was appointed the Titular Bishop of Utica. Casullo left Italy for Brazil on May 12 of that year, stopping at the Sanctuary of F√°tima in Portugal along the way, and arriving in Rio de Janeiro on May 17. Upon arriving, he began an intensive Portuguese language course. He finally arrived in Pinheiro on June 7, 1963. On December 20, 1965, he was appointed the territorial prelate of the Prelature of C√¢ndido Mendes. Casullo resigned as Titular Bishop of Utica on May 26, 1978. With the elevation of the Prelature of C√¢ndido Mendes to a diocese, he was appointed the first Bishop of C√¢ndido Mendes on October 13, 1983. Having reached the retirement age of 75, Casullo submitted his resignation to the Pope on November 5, 1985, and assumed emeritus status in the diocese. He had the choice of retiring to either Luanda, S√£o Luiz, or Fortaleza and, upon the advice of the Cardinal Prefect for the Congregation of Bishops, chose Fortaleza, where he moved to the Montese neighborhood on August 19, 1986. On January 10, 2004, Casullo died at the Hospital Gastrocl√≠nica in Fortaleza, Brazil, of a heart attack at the age of 94. A funeral was held on January 12, and he was buried in the crypt of the Fortaleza Cathedral.

Early life  Mirza Muhammad Khan II was born in 1770 to Malik Muhammad Khan and Khadija Bika, sister of Fatali Khan of Quba. He was named after his grandfather, Mirza Muhammad Khan I, the founding Khan of the Baku Khanate. He ascended to the throne when his father went for pilgrimage and regency was assumed by his mother. His reign saw the Khanate's complete incorporation to Quba, to the point that Fatali Khan invited a Russian garrison to be stationed in Baku in 1785 in place of Mirza Muhammad.Iskenderova M.S. The Baku Khanate, Baku: √áa≈üƒ±oƒülu, 1999, p.80-91 (in Russian) However, Fatali Khan died on 22 March 1789 in Baku, before further military campaigns.  Abdication  Relations were strained between Ahmed Khan of Quba and Mirza Muhammad after 1791. Following the death of Fatali Khan, Muhammadquli Agha ‚Äì the uncle of Mirza Muhammad ‚Äì tried to usurp Baku khanate using the inexperience of both Ahmed Khan and Mirza Muhammad as justification. He assured Ahmed Khan of his loyalty if he were to be awarded the khanate. Ahmed Khan sent an army contingent to Baku to enthrone Muhammadquli agha. Since Baku's army only consisted of about 500 men, he abdicated in favor of his uncle.  Later life  Mirza Muhammad fled to Quba with his family, including his wife and his mother. Muhammadquli betrayed treaties and claimed independence. In response, Ahmed khan mobilized troops and marched on Baku to restore Mirza Muhammad. However he was defeated by Muhammadquli.Ahmed Khan died in March 1791 and was succeeded by his 13-year-old brother - Shaykhali Khan. Mirza Muhammad again was given army to march on Baku. Shaykali further asked Count Ivan Gudovich to besiege Baku. Muhammadquli quickly sent his letter of submission to Russia, asking for help. Confused, Gudovich ordered counter-admiral Pyotr Shishkin to resolve the problem to Russia's benefit. However the order was delayed because for unknown reasons and Baku was bombarded. Muhammadquli khan made peace with Shaykhali and soon fell ill and died.  Struggle for throne  He was appointed as Khan again in 1792 by Shaykhali Khan. However, city nobles headed by Qasim beg Selimkhanov declared Mirza Muhammad's cousin Huseyngulu khan as their new khan. Defeated, Mirza Muhammad fled again to Quba. He then besieged Baku and forced Huseyngulu to divide the khanate's revenues. Huseyngulu made a night attack on Balakhani with reinforcements from Shirvan in 1795 and forced Mirza Muhammad to take refuge in Quba yet again. Mirza Muhammad took forces from Shaykhali and positioned on Absheron, blocking trade and supply routes. Huseyngulu sent Manaf to beg Selimkhanov to ask Gudovich for help. He ambushed Mirza Muhammad and captured him with his family. His younger brother Husein agha was the only one to escape battle, go to Quba and tell the story. Soon through Mostafa khan's help, the cousins made peace and Mirza Muhammad went back to Quba, while retaining his income from Baku oil fields. Huseyngulu khan was detained by Agha Mohammad shah in Karabakh in 1797. Hearing developments, Mirza Muhammad rushed to seize Baku. However, Agha Mohammad's assassination and Huseyngulu khan's fast arrival ruined his plans. After a new treaty, he positioned himself in Mashtaga, acting as vice-khan. In 1803, he was attacked by Huseyngulu again in Mashtaga, this time with Mostafa khan's help. He fled to Quba and started to look for a way to gather troops. He joined army of Russian general Sergei Bulgakov in July 1806. Together they captured Baku on 6 October 1806.  Governor of Quba  He was made provisional governor of Quba in 1809.

This bill proposes solutions to gender violence, with solutions being specific to each certain type of violence. The first three chapters have been summarized to illustrate the thoroughness that this bill expresses. Title I, Chapter I: General Dispositions The first and foremost section of this law begins with the multiple definitions used throughout the bill and with establishing the focus and goal of eradicating gender violence in it its various, defined forms. Female empowerment, Progressive Prospectives on Gender, and Misogyny are all terms that this chapter defines. Articles 1-3 explicitly state that all levels of government are to work together to ‚Äúprevent, sanction, and eradicate‚Äù the violence against women using the means and the reach that they do. These articles state that the ‚Äúcommon sensical‚Äù preventative measures will be enacted to eradicate all types of violence against women. However, this measures that are to be taken aren‚Äôt specified. In this chapter, the Mexican government claims that the woman has inalienable human rights and that it will act to protect these rights. Title II: Models of Violence Chapter I: Violence in the Familial Environment In this section, Articles 7-9 discuss the course of action to be taken in the case of domestic gender violence. It emphasizes that the state is responsible for providing free shelter, counseling, and any other services a survivor of domestic violence will need for free. It also explicitly denounces couples‚Äô counseling as an acceptable approach. Also, familial violence and/or the failure for the aggressor to meet their obligations to feed and support children are grounds for losing custody of the children, should the victim seek separation. Furthermore, re-educating the aggressor with non-misogynist views is encouraged. Chapter II: On Labor and Faculty Violence This following chapter focuses on the importance of classifying gender violence outside of the family environment. It addresses hierarchical roots and emphasizes sexual violence committed due to the nature of these workplace hierarchies. The law here holds the Mexican government accountable for helping implement educational activities to curb violence in the workplace and in educational settings. This section promotes the societal stigmatization of sexual violence to stop its normalization. Chapter III: On Violence in the Community This short, two-article section establishes the eradication of violence within communities (i.e. public places) as a task for the Mexican government. A brief outline of the steps necessary is included, one where the government is to: i. Re-education of the public sans stereotypes and the expectation to keep the public informed about current risk levels for women in the area. ii. The implementation of a monitoring system towards violent individuals and states of perceived societal violence. iii. The establishment of a data bank on restraining orders and those they're placed on to facilitate the exchange of information between different governmental offices This short summarized excerpt depicts the current foundation in the legislation against gender violence in Mexico.

Kenan, Jr., Professor of Physics at Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York, United States. Manning's research focuses on the behavior of glassy materials, using simulations and theory to model the emergent properties of biological tissues. Background Manning grew up in a suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio. She attended the University of Virginia as a Jefferson Scholar, graduating in 2002 with bachelor's degrees in physics and mathematics. She earned a Ph.D. in physics from the University of California at Santa Barbara in 2008, followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at the Princeton University Center for Theoretical Science. In 2011, Manning accepted a faculty position at Syracuse University. In 2020, Manning was named the William R. Kenan, Jr., Professor of Physics at the same university. Manning is married to William Wylie and has two children. Research As a graduate student, Manning studied the behaviors and properties of disordered solids and glasses under the mentorship of Jean Carlson. Among other findings, she described how effective temperature is an important determinant of material failure and strain localization, with potential applications for a wide range of amorphous materials. After earning her Ph.D., Manning expanded her research on amorphous and granular solids to include biological cells, noting that many types of tissues behave as though they were glassy solids. Manning has developed a model describing the relationship between cell adhesion and cortical tension as a determinant for embryonic surface tension. Her ongoing research modeling the relationship between cell shape and jamming leading to tissue rigidity has implications for cell migration in metastatic cancer, wound healing, embryogenesis, and asthma. In addition, Manning has continued to explore the dynamics of conventional disordered solids. In 2018, Manning was named by Science News as one of 2018's 10 scientists to watch.

Background  Founded in 1972, the Brown Berets Chapter of Austin focused on issues similar to the original chapter of Los Angeles that plagued the Chicano community. A quote from Gilberto Rivera, a prominent East Austin activist states, \\"the formation was due to a ‚Äòcall‚Äô from the community & out of their own direct experiences of police violence which followed a persistent pattern in Austin & nearby communities\\". In addition, the Brown Berets \\"formulated the ‚ÄòBrown Beret Manifesto‚Äô which sought short & long term goals on community matters like: police oppression, economics, immigration, education, housing, prison reform, medicine, communication (news/media channels)\\". The Austin Brown Beret chapter was considered a grassroots organization with the intentions of protecting youth and the rights of citizens. During its active years it worked closely with other grassroots organization and other local chapters when necessary. The chapter ultimately dissolved in 1983. Despite this, the legacy it left continued through the efforts of several other organizations such as PODER, CAMILA ‚Äì Chicanos Against Military Intervention in Latin America, Youth Advocacy (formally known as CARNALES Inc.), and East Austin Economic Development Corporation.  Activism  =Santos Rodriguez Case= On July 24, 1973, in Dallas, Texas, a 12-year old boy was killed while in the custody of a police officer who interrogated him over a soda machine burglary investigation. The news ensued violent protests in the city, drawing crowds of enraged citizens and Brown Berets from local Texas chapters. The event sparked demands of civil rights and police reform, uniting the Mexican-American communities in Texas cities over such issues. Furthermore, the Austin Brown Berets were noted in supporting the Dallas chapter during the protests. This incident is a reflection of the struggles that Chicanos faced within the American political system and when dealing with law enforcements . = Aqua Fest Boat Fest = Beginning in 1963, the Austin Aqua Festival began hosting boat drag racing on Lady Bird Lake (formerly Town Lake) with festival goers occupying Festival Beach. However, the trash and noise produced by the attendees upset the inhabitants of the surrounding neighborhoods, which were predominantly Mexican-American. With their complaints being ignored by the city, protests were led and organized by the Brown Berets and their leader and Chicano political activist, Paul Hernandez. Other groups participated, including El Centro Chicano and the East Town Lake Citizens. The 1978 April protest resulted in charges of police brutality, but it was the last year the boat races were held. An interview with East Austin resident, Pete Martinez, revealed that the boat races caused parking problems, issues with attendees stepping on residents' lawns, difficulty getting in and out of streets because of traffic, and noise pollution. Furthermore, Paul Hernandez explained that the underlying issues of the boat races were the degradation property value and forcing out of people. He goes on to assert that these activities block neighborhood efforts of revitalization, and instead help developers in deteriorating the residential area to redevelop it as a commercial area. In these comments, Hernandez touches on the concept of \\"land grabbing\\" or gentrification, which has been and still is an issue that East Austin faces.

Gonnus is shown in the upper centre along the Tempe. Gonnus or Gonnos () or Gonni (ŒìœåŒΩŒΩŒøŒπ) was a town and polis (city-state) of the Perrhaebi in ancient Thessaly, which derived its name, according to the later Greek critics, from Gonneus, mentioned in the Iliad. Its position made it one of the most important places in the north of Thessaly. It stood on the northern side of the Peneius, near the entrance of the only two passes by which an enemy can penetrate into Thessaly from the north. The celebrated vale of Tempe begins to narrow at Gonnus; and the pass across Mount Olympus a little to the west of Tempe leads into Thessaly at Gonnus. It was by the latter route that the army of Xerxes I entered Thessaly. The position of Gonnus with respect to Tempe is clearly shown by the numerous passages in which it is mentioned by Livy. After the Battle of Cynoscephalae (197 BCE), Philip V of Macedon fled in haste to Tempe, but halted a day at Gonnus, to receive such of his troops as might have survived the battle. In the war against Antiochus III, in 191 BCE, when the king, having marched from Demetrias, had advanced as far north as Larissa, a portion of the Roman army under the command of Appius Claudius marched through the pass across Mount Olympus, and thus arrived at Gonnus. On this occasion Livy says that Gonnus was from Larissa, and describes it as situated \\"in ipsis faucibus saltus qu√¶ Tempe appellantur.\\" In 171 BCE it was strongly fortified by Perseus of Macedon; and when this monarch retired into Macedonia, the Roman consul Licinius advanced against the town, but found it impregnable. Gonnus does not occur in history after the wars of the Romans in Greece, but it is mentioned by Strabo and Ptolemy. The editors of the Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World locate Gonnus at the modern town of Gonnoi. A site, called Gonoussa (ŒìŒøŒΩŒøœçœÉœÉŒ±), about southeast of the modern town has been excavated extensively.

Gonnus is shown in the upper centre north of Larissa. Gyrton () or Gyrtona or Gyrtone (ŒìœÖœÅœÑœéŒΩŒ∑) was a town and polis (city- state) of Perrhaebia in ancient Thessaly, situated in a fertile plain between the rivers Titaresius and Peneius. Strabo connects Gyrton with the mouth of the Peneius; but it is evident from the description of Livy, whose account has been derived from Polybius, that it stood in some part of those plains in which Phalanna, Atrax, and Larissa were situated. It was only one day's march from Phalanna to Gyrton. It was an ancient town even in Classical times, mentioned by Homer, and continued to be a place of importance till later times, when it is called opulent by Apollonius Rhodius. It was said to have been the original abode of the Phlegyae, and to have been founded by Gyrton, the brother of Phlegyas. The Gyrtonians are mentioned among the Thessalians who sent aid to the Athenians at the commencement of the Peloponnesian War. The name of the city frequently occurs at a later period, by Livy, Polybius, Pomponius Mela/ Pliny the Elder, and Ptolemy. Gryton also minted coins. The location of Gyrton is a site called Mourlari, southeast of the modern town of Evangelismos. Archaeology The acropolis and the lower city were fortified, possibly already in the Archaic Period. The walls were built with slate.St√§hlin, F. (1924). Das hellenische Thessalien, pp. 88-89. Gyrton minted silver and bronze coins in the 4th century BCE.

Originally released as a standalone single on 7 September 2017, the song is included in the band's eighth studio album Holy Hell, released on 9 November 2018. It was the first new material recorded by the group since the death of their original lead guitarist and primary songwriter Tom Searle in 2016. The track was written and self-produced by the band, with additional production from Bring Me the Horizon keyboardist Jordan Fish. \\"Doomsday\\" charted at number 17 on the UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart. Composition and lyrics \\"Doomsday\\" evolved from a song that was originally part-written by former Architects lead guitarist Tom Searle during sessions for the band's seventh album All Our Gods Have Abandoned Us. Following the guitarist's death on 20 August 2016, his brother Dan (the group's drummer) completed the song's lyrics in preparation for its release. The track was ultimately credited to Architects as a collective. Searle commented upon its release that \\"Completing it for him was a massive responsibility\\". The lyrical themes within \\"Doomsday\\" have been related to Searle's death by critics, especially lines such as \\"they say the good die young\\". Writing for Noisey, Tom Connick explained that the song \\"is about [Dan's] conflicted feelings regarding the loss, and is a marker of Architects' poise in the face of extreme sadness\\". Promotion and release \\"Doomsday\\" was released on 6 September 2017 as the first new Architects material since Tom Searle's death. It was made available as a digital download the following day. The song was not specifically recorded for a new studio album, although Dan Searle did suggest upon its release that it would feature on their next record. The track charted at number 17 on the UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart. The band played the song live for the first time for BBC Radio 1's \\"Radio 1 Rocks\\" show on 31 October. Three months after the song's digital release, \\"Doomsday\\" was issued as a 7\\" vinyl on 8 December 2017, limited to 1,000 copies. In July 2018, the band released an alternate version of \\"Doomsday\\", featuring James Beckwith on piano. Speaking about the \\"acoustic piano ballad\\", Searle suggested that the song \\"needed a rendition that exposed the sadness behind the lyrics\\", which he claimed vocalist Sam Carter delivered \\"beautifully\\". In December of 2018, the WWE announced that the song would be featured as one of the themes of their NXT UK TakeOver: Blackpool event. Music video The music video for \\"Doomsday\\" was directed by Stuart Birchall, who had previously worked on a number of other videos for the band, most recently for All Our Gods Have Abandoned Us lead single \\"A Match Made in Heaven\\" in 2016. According to Zoe Camp of Revolver magazine, it \\"finds the band members tearing through the song against a starry backdrop, performing so intensely that, at times, they appear to break apart themselves\\". Metal Hammer columnist Eleanor Goodman described it as \\"a moving video featuring Tom's twin brother, drummer Dan, suspended in the expanse of the universe\\". Critical reception Critical response to \\"Doomsday\\" was positive. Kerrang Radio described the song as \\"a goosebump-inducing anthem of the highest calibre\\". Scott Munro of Metal Hammer called it \\"blistering\\", while Eleanor Goodman of the same publication dubbed it \\"honest\\" and \\"beautiful\\". Brii Jamieson of music magazine Rock Sound described the song's piano reprise as \\"an emotional rollercoaster\\".

During the 1890s she studied in London at the Westminster School of Art and at the Slade School of Art before completing her studies in Paris. Engelbach had works shown at the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle and at the Paris Salon. In 1901 she had a picture shown, under her maiden name, at the Royal Academy in London. She was awarded a bronze medal at a Women's International Art Club exhibition held in London. In 1902 she married a C.F.R Engelbach and withdrew from a full-time art and exhibition career to raise a family. Engelbach returned to painting in the late 1920s and had a solo show at the Beaux Arts Gallery in 1931. She went on to resume exhibiting at both the Royal Academy and the Paris Salon and also with the Royal Institute of Oil Painters and the National Society of Painters, Sculptors and Gravers/ Printmakers and became a member of the latter two societies. The Goupil, Tooths and Lefevre galleries were among the commercial concerns that showed her work. Originally Engelbach was a portrait painter but later became a specialist flower painter who also painted landscapes. Her painting Roses, from the 1930s, is held in the Tate collection.

Thymus, as a primary lymphoid organ, mediates T cell development and maturation. Thymic microenvironment is established by TEC network filled with thymocytes in different developing stages. TECs and thymocytes are the most important components in the thymus, that are necessary for production functionally competent T lymphocytes and self tolerance. Dysfunction of TECs causes several immunodeficiencies and autoimmune diseases.  Groups  The final anatomical location of the thymic gland is reached at 6 weeks in the fetus. TECs originate from nonhematopoetic cells that are characterized by negative expression of CD45 and positive expression of EpCAM. Then TECs are divided into two phenotypically and functionally different groups that have distinct location, cytokeratin expression, surface markers, maturation factors, proteases and function in a T cell selection. Cortical TECs (cTECs) are presented in the outer cortex region, in comparison with medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) located in the inner medulla. Both cTEC and mTEC participate in impose central and peripheral tolerance. cTECs play a key role in the positive selection and mTECs eliminate auto-reactive thymocytes during the negative selection. Both of these types of cells can be defined and reciprocally distinguished by their expression of cytokines, chemokines, costimulatory molecules and transcription factors, that have an effect on thymocyte development. TECs, situated in the corticomedullary junction, express two types of cytokeratines K5 and K8. From these immature progenitors K5+K8+ TECs are derived mTECs with typical expression of K5, K14 and also cTECs, characterized by K8, K18 expression.  Maturation  = Medullary thymic epithelial cells' maturation = During the mTEC maturation are expressed high levels of MHCII, CD80, autoimmune regulator Aire and tissue restricted antigens (TRAs). Expression of Cathepsin L and Cathepsin S is also typical for mTEC, because of participation of these proteases in the negative selection of T cells. Representative surface markers are UEA-1 and CD80. After maturation continue mTEC to the terminal differentiation stage, which is accompanied by loss of specific maturation factors (MHCII, Aire, CD80, TRA) and initiation of involucrin expression, marker of terminally differentiated epithelium. Remaining MHCIIhi CD80hi,Aire+ mTEC subset will die by apoptosis. = Cortical thymic epithelial cells' maturation = Maturation of cTEC is also mediated by high expression of MHCII molecules but it is combined with proteases Œ≤5t, Cathepsin L and TSSP. These factors partake in positive selection of T cells. Specific markers on the surface of cTEC are Ly51 and CD 205 and even group of TECs expressing marker CD205 represent one of immature progenitors cells - cTEC committed progenitors. These cells are also called thymic epithelial progenitors cells (TEPCs) and they provide that cortical and medullary epithelial thymocytes share an origin in the postnatal thymus. cTEC-committed progenitor could generate both cTEC and mTEC, in comparison with mTEC-committed progenitor, which is able to produce just mTEC. mTEC-committed progenitors are described by expression of Clandin 3 and Clandin 4 that are not components of cTEC progeny.  TECs development  The first steps of TEC development are regulated by the transcription factors (Hoxa3, Pax1/9, Eya1, Six1/4, Tbx1), most of which are in postnatal cTEC and immature TECs. The most important transcription factor for all stages of TEC development in embryonic and postnatal thymus is a Foxn1. Foxn1 controls the whole process by the activation of its target genes with binding to specific DNA sequence via its forkhead box domain. There are highlighted over 400 Foxn1 targeted genes, included critical loci for TEC differentiation and function. TEC development require activity of other molecules and transcriptional regulators, such as protein 63 (p63) that is involved in homeostasis of various epithelial lineages, chromobox homolog 4 (Cbx4) which regulates cell proliferation and differentiation, fibroblast growth factors Fgf7 and Fgf10 that initiate TEC expansion, TNFT, CD40, lymfotoxin Œ≤ receptor (LTŒ≤R) and Hedgehog signaling pathway, which could reduce TEC cells in fetal and postnatal thymus. These typical molecules for TEC progenitors development are mostly similar and shared with cTEC. The early stages of cTEC also require high expression of Pax 1/9,Six1/4,Hixa3 but they could be established in the absence of NFŒ∫B. In contrast, mTEC development is dependent on the presence of Relb, NFŒ∫B signals and the TNFR superfamily but it could be performed in the absence of Foxn1.  Positive and negative selection  = Positive selection = Double negative (DN) T cells, as a progenitors with CD44 and CD25 expression but lack of CD4 and CD8 coreceptor expression, are proliferated and differentiated to the double positive (DP) stages. These CD4+ and CD8+ double positive T lymphocytes already express completely recombined TCRs that are tested for recognizing self and non-self molecules by MHCI and MHCII presentation of self antigens on the cTEC. Thymocytes that make adequate interaction with MHC complex, are survived and diverted to either CD4+ or CD8+ single positive (SP) T lymphocytes. These single positive cells migrate out of the cortex to the medulla, where the process continues as a negative selection. = Negative selection = Without negative selection thymocytes are unable to respond to TCR triggering by proliferation, because of a chance of presence auto-reactive T-cell clones. During the negative selection T-lymphocytes acquire competence for elimination of potentially self reactive cells by apoptosis. So if TCR exhibit high or inappropriate affinity for the self antigen expressed on mTEC, the thymocyte will be destroyed. mTEC expressed wide repertoire of self peptides presented on the MHC molecules. Medulla is also important for implementation of self tolerance, which is mediated by CD4+CD25+Foxp3 nTreg cells. Foxp3 Treg development is supported by mTECs during negative selection, when thymocytes have TCR specificities with intermediate affinity for self antigens.  Diseases  TECs, as a component of the thymus, play a key role in thymocyte development and self-tolerance, so their dysfunction causes many autoimmune diseases, tumors of immunodeficiencies. Most frequently are occurred epithelial tumors established from TEC and thymocytes - thymomas and thymic carcinoma. Maturation abnormalities of TECs induce chronic inflammatory diseases and decreased count of mTEC and cTEC leads to chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Autoimmune disease development is result of a break down of the self-tolerance by Aire-mediated TRAs' expression on mTEC or the negative regulatory system formed by CD4+CD25+Foxp3 nTreg cells. Aire mediates negative selection of auto-reactive T-cells and organ-specific antigens' expression on mTECs. The outcome of a single gene mutation in the autoimmune regulator Aire is systematic disease APECED (APS-1), which is manifested by mucocutaneous candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism and adrenal insufficiency. There are many autoimmune diseases, caused by failure of self-tolerance by TRAs on mTEC, for example autoimmune thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis. Type 1 diabetes is a result of the absence of self-tolerance, which is characterized by a decreased expression of Insulin 1 and Insulin 2 (TRAs) on mTEC. mTEC and cTEC damage is observed during Graves' disease, Myasthenia gravis or HIV.

She also worked on the cardiovascular response to mental stress. In 1986 she was appointed technical manager of The Bionetics Corporation at Kennedy Space Center. She served as a NASA visiting scientist with the Universities Space Research Association between 1987 and 1990. Frey was made professor in the Aerospace Medicine Residency Program. The 1990s were designated the Decade of the Brain, and NASA decided that it was important to understand the nervous system in space. She identified that the health symptoms astronauts experience in space are similar to ageing, but occur more rapidly and appear to be reversible. She studied the impact of lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) on men and identified that neither aerobic or strength fitness impacted responses to LBNP stress. Neurolab included measurements from sympathetic nerves before and after spaceflight, as well as monitoring the central nervous system in rats during spaceflight. She identified the correct dose of saline astronauts could take to countermeasure postflight orthostatic intolerance. In 1993 Frey won the Aerospace Medical Association Louis H. Bauer Founders Award. She was assigned to the NASA Life Sciences Division in 1994 and studied the impact of space on the nervous system. Frey identified the cardiovascular and physiological responses of astronauts. She created a series of educational activities with NASA and the Morehouse School of Medicine. She studied the impact of aging on the cardiovascular response to postural change. In 1995 Frey won the Hubertus Strughold Award of the Space Medicine Association for her \\"significant contributions to space medicine\\". STS-90 launched on April 16, 1998. Frey served on the board of editors of the Aerospace Medical Association journal.

The whole family was musical and everyone played an instrument. Stefania played piano, harp, and harmonium. Later, the composer remembered her childhood and her love of music:  Studies  Irena, brother Lev (with racket), Stefania, circa 1915 Stefania began her music studies with Vasyl Barvinsky. From 1914 to 1916, she studied in Vienna as pianist with Vil√©m Kurz. After World War I, she studied with Adolf Chybi≈Ñski at the University of Lviv, and also attended his lectures on music theory at the Lviv Conservatory. In 1919 she wrote her first musical work ‚Äì the Liturgy (–õ—ñ—Ç—É—Ä–≥—ñ—é), which was performed several times in St. George's Cathedral in Lviv. In 1921 she studied with Guido Adler at the University of Vienna and Joseph Marx at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna, from which she graduated in 1923 with a Teacher's Diploma. In 1925 she married Robert Lisovskyi and travelled with him to Berlin where she lived from 1927 to 1930 and studied with Arnold Schoenberg and Franz Schreker. During this period, in 1927, her daughter Zoya (–ó–æ—è) was born. In 1930 she travelled to Prague in Czechoslovakia, studied with Zdenƒõk Nejedl√Ω at Charles University, and with Otakar ≈†√≠n at the Prague Conservatory. She also studied composition with V√≠tƒõzslav Nov√°k at the music academy. In autumn 1933 she taught piano and became an accompanist at the Prague Conservatory. In 1934 she defended her doctoral dissertation on the topic of Ukrainian folklore in Russian operas. She received her doctorate in musicology in 1934 from the Ukrainian Free University in Prague. She became the first woman from Galicia (which was then part of Poland) to receive a Ph.D. Returning to Lviv, from 1934 until the beginning of the Second World War she worked as a teacher of musical theory and piano at the Lviv Conservatory, and became a member of the Union of Ukrainian Professional Musicians.  World War II  In autumn 1939, after the Soviet occupation of Western Ukraine, Stefania worked as a tutor and a concertmaster at the Lviv Opera House, and from 1940 to 1941 was Associate Professor at the Lviv Conservatory. After the closure of the Conservatory, with the German occupation, she continued teaching at the State Musical School. In spring 1944 she left Lviv for Vienna. Fleeing from the Soviets, in 1946, she moved to southern Austria, and from there to Italy, where her second husband, Nartsiz Lukyanovich, was a physician under the British command.  England  In autumn 1946, Stefania moved to the United Kingdom, and lived in Brighton (1947‚Äì1951), London (1951‚Äì1952), Barrow Gurney (near Bristol) (1952‚Äì1962), Belfast (Northern Ireland) (1962‚Äì1973), and Cambridge (from 1973). In the late 1940s, she returned to composing. From time to time she acted again as a pianist, in particular in 1957 in a series of concerts in Ukrainian communities in England, and in 1959 at a concert of piano music in Bristol. She was a member of the British Society of Women-Composers and Musicians (which existed until 1972). Her opera Oksana's Heart was performed in Winnipeg (Canada) in 1970 in the Centennial Concert Hall, under the artistic direction of her sister Irena Turkevycz-Martynec.

It was designed to teach students about the realities of 19th-century pioneer life on the Oregon Trail. In the game, the player assumes the role of a wagon leader guiding a party of settlers from Independence, Missouri, to Oregon's Willamette Valley via a covered wagon in 1848. The game was designed and created by a team at MECC, led by R. Philip Bouchard, who also served as the principal designer. It was loosely based on an earlier text-based game also named The Oregon Trail, originally developed by Don Rawitsch, Bill Heinemann, and Paul Dillenberger in 1971 and released on the MECC timeshare system in 1975, followed by similar versions for Apple, Atari, Commodore, and Radio Shack computers (from 1978 to 1984). The 1985 version is the first graphical and the most well known entry in the Oregon Trail series, and it was released in multiple editions between 1985 and 1993 for several platforms, including Apple II, DOS, and Macintosh computers. Games in the series have since been released in many editions by various developers and publishers, many titled The Oregon Trail. The multiple games in the series are often considered to be iterations on the same title, and they have collectively sold over 65 million copies and have been inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame. The series has also inspired a number of spinoffs such as The Yukon Trail and The Amazon Trail. Gameplay =Travel= Screenshot from the Apple II version The player can choose to be a banker from Boston, a carpenter from Ohio, or a farmer from Illinois. Each profile starts with a specified amount of money to spend at the supply store (the banker has the most, the farmer the least), before beginning their journey. After the player sets off from Independence, Missouri, there are several landmarks along the trail where players can make decisions, shop for supplies or rest. Players can purchase supplies such as oxen to pull the wagon, food to feed their party, clothing to keep their party warm, ammunition for hunting, and spare parts for the wagon. These landmarks include: Kansas River, Big Blue River, Fort Kearney, Chimney Rock, Fort Laramie, Independence Rock, South Pass, Fort Bridger, Green River, Soda Springs, Fort Hall, Snake River, Fort Boise, Grande Ronde Valley in the Blue Mountains, Fort Walla Walla, and The Dalles. When approaching Oregon's Willamette Valley, travelers can either float a raft through the Columbia River Gorge or take the Barlow Road. =Hunting= An important aspect of the game was the ability to hunt. Using guns and bullets bought over the course of play, players select the hunt option (#8) and hunt wild animals to add to their food reserves. In the original version, players controlled the wagon leader who could aim a rifle in one of eight directions and fire single shots at animals. In later versions, players hunted with a cross-hair controlled by the mouse or touchscreen. While the player can shoot as many wild games as they have bullets, only 100 pounds of meat can be carried back to the wagon at once in early versions of the game. In later versions, as long as there were at least two living members of the wagon party, 200 pounds could be carried back. Also in later versions, players could hunt in different environments (hunting during winter showing snow-covered grass, for example), and the over- hunting of animals would result in \\"scarcity\\" that reduced the number of animals appearing later in the game. Some versions also allow the player to go fishing. =Death= Throughout the course of the game, members of the player's party can fall ill and not rest, which causes further harm to the victim. The party can die from various causes and diseases, such as measles, snakebite, exhaustion, typhoid, cholera, and dysentery, as well as from drowning or accidental gunshot wounds. The player's oxen are also subject to injury and death. =Scoring= At the conclusion of the journey, a player's score is determined in two stages. In the first stage, the program awards a \\"raw\\" or the unscaled number of points for each remaining family member (weighted by party health), each remaining possession (weighted by type), and remaining cash on hand (one point per dollar). In the second stage, the program multiplies this raw score depending on the party's initial level of resources determined by the profession of the party's leader; for example, in the Apple II game, a banker starting with $1600 receives no bonus, the score of a carpenter starting with $800 is doubled, and the score of a farmer starting with $400 is tripled. The player's score is added to a high-score list. Development =Original version= In 1971, Don Rawitsch, a history major and senior at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, taught an 8th grade history class at Bryant Junior High as a student teacher. His supervising teacher assigned him to prepare a unit on the westward movement of people in the United States, and Rawitch, along with his roommates and fellow Carleton students Bill Heinemann and Paul Dillenberger decided to create a game for the school's computer instead. They implemented the basics of the game in two weeks and, after they presented the game, students would line up outside the door for their turn and stay after school for another chance. When the school year ended, Rawitsch deleted the program from the computer, after printing out a copy of the source code. In 1974, Rawitch was hired by the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium (MECC), a state-funded organization that developed educational software for the classroom, and he began to rebuild the game, still using text-based output, for the organization. He decided to research the events of the Oregon Trail that he had not had time for with the original game, and changed the random events, such as bad weather or wagons breaking down, to be based on the actual historical probabilities for what happened to travelers on the trail at each location in the game. Rawitsch calculated the probabilities himself, basing them on historical diaries and narratives of people on the trail that he read. Rawitsch uploaded The Oregon Trail into the organization's time-sharing network, where it could be accessed by schools across Minnesota. The game became one of the network's most popular programs, with thousands of players monthly. After Rawitsch published the BASIC language program code for the game in Creative Computing magazine in 1978, volunteers adapted the source code to run on various timeshare computers and newly invented personal computers. In 1980, MECC included one of the Apple II versions of Oregon in a product called Elementary Volume 6, a collection of five social studies simulation games. Although the game structure and random events in Oregon were identical to the timeshare version, the text-based hunting feature was replaced with a graphical version of the activity. In 1983 and 1984, this early Apple II version was ported to the Atari, Commodore, and Radio Shack computers, published by MECC in a product called Expeditions, a collection of three of the activities from Elementary Volume 6. =Graphical version= The Oregon Trail continued to be a popular title and, in October 1984, MECC commissioned programmer R. Philip Bouchard and a small team to make a graphical version for the Apple II computer. The new version was to be released as a standalone game and appealed to the home market instead of the school market. The team consisted of lead designer Philip Bouchard, lead programmer John Krenz, lead artist Charolyn Kapplinger, Shirley Kieran on research, and Bob Granvin for additional programming. Bouchard was told the new version had to be an expansion on the original game, not only an update to the graphics. The new version was designed to be more accurate to the real Oregon Trail and for the game to have better \\"replayability\\". Over the course of the development, 21 innovations were made from the original: * More detailed and accurate geographic locations to real life. * A landmark-based travel cycle, where players can visit famous landmarks. * Continuous daily cycles, so that players can encounter a new event every in-game day and keep track of their supplies every day. * The addition of branches in the path. Allows the player to make a decision of which way to go. * The addition of river crossings. * Improved hunting option. * A point system. * Family members that accompany the player. * The ability to talk to human characters at landmarks and shops. * River rafting game. * Tombstone scenes when a family member dies. * A health model that tracks the condition of the family members. * A weather system that allows for different weather every in-game day. * Detailed resource management. * A travel screen which appears when the player is traveling on the trail. * The inclusion of a General Store, where players can purchase in-game supplies. * Diseases the family members caught were more specific. * The inclusion of difficulty levels. * The ability to trade with other characters at landmarks. * Options to rest or change pace. * Music that accurately represents what songs were popular at the time of The Oregon Trail. The development time of the new version lasted 10 months, from October 1984 to the end of July 1985. The game was released in autumn 1985. =GUI versions= In 1991 through 1993, MECC released an updated version of the game for three different platforms ‚Äì Macintosh (in monochrome, 1991), DOS (with ‚ÄúDeluxe‚Äù added to the title in 1992), and Windows (1993). The GUI-based version includes redesigned interfaces, improved graphics featuring 256-color elements. The DOS version supports Adlib music and 256-color support via VESA BIOS extensions, while the Windows version uses MIDI music files. Other changes include: *Additional character classes, such as Blacksmith, Doctor, Merchant.

Reception and legacy The Oregon Trail was extremely successful, selling over 65 million copies through ten iterations over forty years. It was a hallmark in American elementary schools in the 1980s, 1990s, and early-mid 2000s as many school computers, including the Apple II, came bundled with the game. The game's popularity in school computer labs led to the terminology Oregon Trail Generation to describe people born during the Millennial and Generation X cusp years. The video game has been described as an identifying experience for these cuspers, typically described as those born during the late 1970s to early 1980s. Smithsonian magazine observed, \\"The Oregon Trail is still a cultural landmark for any school kid who came of age in the 1980s or after. Even now, there remains a constant pressure to revive the series, so that nostalgic Generation Xers and Millennials can amble westward with a dysentery- riddled party once again.\\" In 2014 it inspired a parody musical, The Trail to Oregon! Polygon described it as one of the most successful games of all time, calling it a cultural icon. IGN (in 2009) described the game as a \\"fond memory that will not let you down\\". Due to its widespread popularity, The Oregon Trail was inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame in 2016. Out of the 12 games currently in the Hall, The Oregon Trail is the only educational game. In 2012, The Oregon Trail was listed on Time's All-TIME 100 greatest video games list. In 2016, Time placed the game 9th on its \\"The 50 Best Video Games of All Time\\" list. It was also included in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die.

Tom Thomson (1877‚Äì1917) was a Canadian painter from the beginning of the 20th century. Beginning from humble roots, his development as a career painter was meteoric, only pursuing it seriously in the final years of his life. He became one of the foremost figures in Canadian art, leaving behind around 400 small oil sketches and around fifty larger works on canvas. Beginning his career in 1902 as a graphic designer, he only began to paint seriously in 1912 at the age of 35. His skills developed as he ventured through Algonquin Park, sketching scenes that interested him. His creative peak came from 1914 until his untimely death in 1917. His art style progressed from sombre, grey scenes into brilliantly coloured expos√©s, characterized by rapid and thickly applied brushstrokes. His later works presage the advances seen by the Abstract Expressionist movement. Materials and working method =Sketch to canvas= The artwork of Thomson is typically divided into two bodies: the first is made up of the small oil sketches on wood panels, of which there are around 400, and the second is of around fifty larger works on canvas. The smaller sketches were typically done in the style of en plein air in \\"the North,\\" primarily Algonquin Park, in the spring, summer and fall. The larger canvases were instead completed over the winter in Thomson's studio‚Äîan old utility shack with a wood-burning stove on the grounds of the Studio Building, an artist's enclave in Rosedale, Toronto. Although he sold few of the larger paintings during his lifetime, they formed the basis of posthumous exhibitions, including one at Wembley in London, that eventually brought international attention to his work, though the more plentiful sketches have typically been thought of as the core of his work. He considered most of his sketches to be complete works in themselves and not studies for larger works, since in the transition to a larger canvas the works lose their characteristic intimacy. Still, a dozen or so of the major canvases were directly derived from smaller sketches. Indeed, paintings like Northern River, Spring Ice, The Jack Pine and The West Wind were only later expanded into larger oil paintings. While the sketches were produced quickly, the canvases were developed over weeks or even months. Because of this, they display an \\"inherent formality,\\" with the transition from small to large requiring a reinvention or elaboration of the original details. In this transition he often exaggerated hillsides or other landscape features to give the final picture greater depth. Comparing sketches with their respective canvases allows one to see the changes Thomson made in colour, detail and background textural patterns. =Materials= In 1914 Thomson made himself a sketch box to hold 8¬Ω √ó 10¬Ω inch (21.6 √ó 26.7 cm) panels. The lower half of the box served as a palette, while the upper half served as a support for canvas or wood panels. Slots made room for three paintings to be carried at any given time, keeping them apart so wet paint did not smear or flatten. Thomson utilized different materials throughout his career, providing a method for dating paintings. For example, the wood panels he used in 1914 developed vertical cracks. He had only occasionally used hard wood-pulp board in 1914, but consistently began using it in 1915. In the spring and fall of 1915 he used terra cotta-coloured and carnation-coloured paint as sealers, but by 1916 he had switched to ochre paint. In the spring of 1917 he disassembled and cut up wood crates to make into 5 √ó 7 inch (12.7 √ó 17.8 cm) panels for sketching, smaller than those he normally painted on and requiring tighter handling. Fragments of brand names (e.g. Gold Medal Purity Flour, California Oranges) are stamped on the back of some, such as Birches and An Ice Covered Lake. During the same spring he reused around one-third of his sketches, either because he was not satisfied with them or because he was short on painting materials. In 2000, a study was conducted to understand the materials and working method of Thomson. In 2002‚Äì03, before a travelling exhibition organized by the National Gallery of Canada and the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Canadian Conservation Institute utilized infrared and X-ray photography, spectroscopy and micro-sampling of pigments to further analyze many of Thomson's paintings. Sandra Webster-Cook and Anne Ruggles described in their research how Thomson applied differently coloured primers in various parts of his paintings to give them subtle yet important qualities. =Photography= A northern mill-yard, II, 1913-14. Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa. Probably a view of the mill-yard of the abandoned Gilmour Lumber Company at Canoe Lake. The man seated on the stump is thought to be Tom Wattie, an Algonquin Park ranger. Thomson occasionally used photography to capture things that gained his interest, such as fish he caught, images of his friends or the landscape. He does not seem to have used any of his photographs for producing art, with none of the extant photos corresponding to any of his paintings. He instead preferred to capture images with small oil sketches, and nearly all of the works he produced are among these small sketches. David Silcox however has speculated that Drowned Land (and perhaps other paintings) may have been painted with a photograph as a memory aid given their \\"uncanny precision.\\" In 1912 while travelling up the Spanish River in the Mississagi area with William Broadhead, Thomson lost at least a dozen rolls of film (claiming in a letter that he lost 14 dozen) along with many more sketches after their canoe experienced several spills. He had intended to bring the images back to Grip Limited and use them in his commercial work. E002712902-v6.jpgA lake in Southern Ontario, III, .

She is holding a string of fish in her right hand and a fly fishing rod in her left hand. Developments =Commercial art= Tom Thomson's first foray into art came in 1901 with his education at Canada Business College in Chatham, Ontario. It was there that he developed rudimentary penmanship abilities. By 1902, he had been hired in Seattle at the design firm Maring & Ladd, working as a pen artist, draftsman and etcher. His main work there consisted in producing business cards, brochures and posters, as well as three-colour printing. Having previously learned calligraphy, he specialized in lettering, drawing and painting. Thomson may have also worked as a freelance commercial designer, but there are no extant examples of such work to confirm these suspicions. He was greatly influenced by the black and white illustrations he saw in magazines, something especially apparent in his sketch, Study of a Woman's Head, which draws inspiration from the \\"Gibson Girl\\" of American illustrator Charles Dana Gibson. Thomson's younger brother Ralph wrote about Thomson during this period: After returning to Toronto, Thomson joined the artistic design firm Grip Ltd. in either 1908 or 1909. The firm specialized in design and lettering work. Grip was the leading graphic design company in the country and introduced Art Nouveau, metal engraving and the four-colour process to Canada. Albert Robson, then the art director at Grip, recalled that when he first hired Thomson, \\"his samples consisted mostly of lettering and decorative designs applied to booklet covers and some labels.\\" Advertising or calendar drawing, Fall-winter 1912. Location unknown The techniques he learned regarding Art Nouveau became apparent in many of his later works, including paintings like Northern River; Decorative Landscape, Birches; Spring Ice and The West Wind. Of particular note are the sinuous forms typical within the art style, seen in the \\"S-curves\\" of the trees which have their origins in Thomson's work as a draughtsman. Fellow artist A. Y. Jackson affirmed the Group of Seven's tendency towards using Art Nouveau styles within their work, writing that, \\"We (the Group of Seven and Tom Thomson) treated our subjects with the freedom of designers. We tried to emphasize colour, line and pattern.\\" The senior artist at Grip, J. E. H. MacDonald, encouraged his staff to paint outside in their spare time to better hone their skills. MacDonald had perhaps the largest influence on Thomson's career as a painter; he enticed Thomson away from the commercial field and brought him towards painting through not only the encouraged weekend outdoor sketching, but through painting trips on holidays and introducing him to his fellow artists. MacDonald himself credited William Broadhead with Thomson's emergence as a painter, writing in a letter to Arthur Lismer that \\"My memories in connection with Tom seem to begin with B[roadhead].\\" In a draft of an article, Harold Mortimer-Lamb similarly credited Broadhead with Thomson's emergence. Lismer took exception to their claims, instead crediting MacDonald. A. Y. Jackson also expressed that Thomson's major development came after his ventures to Algonquin Park, rather than his time as a graphic designer. Lismer later wrote, File:Tom Thomson Business Card.jpgTom Thomson's business card, .

National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa =Painting career= First ventures to Algonquin Park (1912‚Äì13) Drowned Land, Fall 1912. Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto It was in 1912 that Thomson's transition from commercial art towards his original style of painting became apparent. This transition appears to have been instigated by his first visit to Algonquin Park in May 1912. He acquired his first sketching equipment, but spent most of his trip fishing, save for \\"a few notes, skylines and colour effects.\\" Dating sketches to this trip has sometimes proved difficult. One exception is the sketch Smoke Lake, Algonquin Park, easily dated because Thomson gave it to Bud Callighen around the time of their first meeting. Charles Hill has also included the \\"somewhat awkward\\" Old Lumber Dam, Algonquin Park as likely being made during the trip. Robson identified Drowned Land as being painted on the Mississagi Forest Reserve canoe trip. Also dated to this time are The Canoe and A Northern Lake (1912).

Camp Tanamakoon, Algonquin Park In fall 1912 Thomson left Grip Ltd. to join another design firm, Rous & Mann. Leonard Rossell went on to write, \\"Those who worked there were all allowed time off to pursue their studies... Tom Thomson, so far as a I know, never took definite lessons from anyone, yet he progressed quicker than any of us. But what he did was probably of more advantage to him. He took several months off in the summer and spent them in Algonquin Park.\\" In October 1912 Thomson was first introduced to Dr. James MacCallum, a frequent visitor of the Ontario Society of Artists' (OSA) exhibitions and The Arts and Letters Club of Toronto. MacCallum convinced Thomson to leave his position at Rous and Mann and commit to a career in painting. Lawren Harris later recalled Thomson's major developments around this time: MacCallum offered to cover Thomson's expenses for a year on the promise that he fully committed himself to painting, an offer Thomson eventually accepted after some initial hesitance. MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their \\"truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.\\" He further wrote that Thomson's paintings were \\"dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects.\\" Hart House, University of Toronto, Toronto Thomson's ventures to the wilderness of Ontario were major sources of inspiration in his art, writing in a letter to MacCallum that the beauty of Algonquin Park was indescribable. His early works, such as Northern Lake (1912‚Äì13) and Evening were not outstanding technically, yet they illustrate a particular talent for composition and colour handling. The sale of the former to the Ontario Government in March 1913 for $250 () allowed him to spend more time in the summer and fall of 1913 sketching. MacCallum described the painting as a \\"picture [of] one of the small northern lakes swept by a north west wind; a squall just passing from the far shore, the water crisp, sparkingly blue & broken into short, white-caps‚Äîa picture full of light, life and vigour.\\" Thomson's sketches from 1913 are often grey, but display greater colour handling than that seen in the earlier sketch of Northern Lake. Most of these sketches are simple with a far off shore. Canvases like Morning Cloud and Moonlight use broken brushwork, a technique he likely learned from MacDonald and Jackson.

National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa Colour and experimentation (1914‚Äì15) The Tent, November 1915. McMichael Canadian Art Collection Thomson often experienced self-doubt, with A. Y. Jackson recalling that in the fall of 1914, Thomson threw his sketch box into the woods out of frustration, and was \\"so shy he could hardly be induced to show his sketches.\\" While his work from this period still displays \\"a certain awkwardness,\\" Thomson surpassed his colleagues Jackson and Lismer in his brilliance of colour. In a letter to MacCallum, Jackson wrote, The sketches produced in 1915 display his increasing tendency towards experimentation and his sensitivity to colour, experimenting with texture and colour in ways that his earlier subdued and precise work had avoided. Beyond his work as a colourist, he developed a technique of presenting contradictory ideas that were simultaneously resolved within the same image. Typically he accomplished this by using the techniques of both Tonalism and Post-Impressionism, later achieving it by joining decorative patterns with bold handling. Jackson wrote regarding this period of Thomson's work, \\"No longer handicapped by literal representation, he was transposing, eliminating, designing, experimenting, finding happy colour motives amid tangle and confusion and [reveling] in paint. The amount of work he did was incredible.\\" Over the 1915‚Äì16 winter in Toronto, Thomson produced several canvases, including In the Northland; The Birch Grove, Autumn; Autumn's Garland; Opulent October and Spring Ice. The sketches of his work display a two-dimensionality. Thomson's work from this period‚Äîlike the works of Harris, Lismer and MacDonald‚Äîbecame more decorative. The colour is heightened, with spaces flattened and forms arranged into vertical bands. The branches and trunks of trees are more stylized in nature.

McMichael Canadian Art Collection, Kleinburg In 1916, Thomson left for Algonquin Park earlier than any previous year, evidenced by the large number of snow studies he produced at this time. He produced many sketches which varied in composition, though they all had vivid colour and were applied thickly. Over the following winter, encouragement from Harris, MacDonald and MacCallum saw Thomson move into the most productive portion of his career, writing in a letter that he \\"got quite a lot done.\\" It was during this time that he produced many of what became his most famous works, including The Jack Pine and The West Wind. In the last two years of his life especially, Thomson was particularly skilled in observing atmospheric phenomena, such as temperature, humidity, wind and light. Work from this period‚Äîsuch as The Rapids‚Äîdemonstrate his adeptness at controlling colour and are painted with a particular \\"crispness and freshness.\\" Other paintings‚Äîsuch as Path Behind Mowat Lodge and Tea Lake Dam‚Äîillustrate his bold and expressive brushstrokes. The scale of Thomson's later canvases foreshadow the Algoma canvases the members of the Group of Seven painted after the war. Art historians David Silcox and Harold Town have described this period of Thomson's art as moving in the direction of abstraction.

Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto =Approaching abstraction= Thomson was prolific in the number of sketches he produced‚Äîover four hundred across his entire career‚Äîproviding an opportunity to observe the trends and progression of his style. Starting as a landscape painter, he drew away from typical landscape convention and began to experiment with more excited brushstrokes, clashing paint and more vibrant colours. For artist and Thomson biographer Harold Town, the brevity of Thomson's career hinted at an artistic evolution never fully realized. He cites the 1916 oil painting Unfinished Sketch as \\"the first completely abstract work in Canadian art,\\" a painting that, whether or not it was intended as a purely non-objective work, presages the innovations of abstract expressionism. Town describes the contents of the painting as being a sky that expresses the frustration Thompson must have experienced in adding paint to the small areas between trees, rocks and thickets. He similarly describes Late Autumn as being another \\"impatient study\\" that led to abstract experiment. Of particular importance are the areas between the branches, which are \\"brusquely smacked into place,\\" as well as a similar foreground to that of Unfinished Sketch. Unfinished Sketch, Fall 1916. Private collection David Silcox has pointed to Cranberry Marsh as indicating Thomson's move towards abstraction. He has also viewed After the Storm, likely one of Thomson's last paintings, as an indication that Thomson was already responding to the changes happening in Western art, even if he didn't exactly know where it would lead. Examining the painting more closely, the landscape itself dissolves into bare strokes and pure abstraction. Art historian Joan Murray has expressed reluctance to describe Thomson's sketches as \\"abstract,\\" given that some of them may have likely been intended as \\"colour notes for use in the studio,\\" and because some of the sketches were unfinished.

Design and development Sergiuz Czerwi≈Ñski, no relation of the better known glider designer Wac≈Çaw Czerwi≈Ñski, had designed, built and flown his first glider, a biplane, in 1917. In 1927 he, like several other Polish aircraft enthusiasts, saw that gliding offered a cheap route to flying for the young and produced a suitable aircraft, developed in an aeromodelling group he formed at the S≈Çowacki school in Kowel. The 1927 Czerwi≈Ñski monoplane glider had a rectangular plan, two part wing, built around a single spar and fabric covered. Instead of conventional ailerons and elevators, the pilot was able to alter the angle of incidence of each half-wing separately. This control system, used by several Polish gliders between about 1924 and 1927, was underpinned by the idea that gliders could obtain lift by capturing the energy of gusts, the pilot increasing the angle of incidence of the whole wing as soon as the upward motion of the glider indicated a horizontal gust. Differential incidence movement controlled roll, like ailerons, and collective operation controlled pitch, removing the need for an elevator. The Czerwi≈Ñsk had an open frame fuselage, a flat truss built from ash with I-form chords and cross-members. The pilot sat on the lower chord behind the first cross-member. At the rear the empennage was fabric covered, with a tailplane without elevators and a conventional fin and rudder. Czerwi≈Ñski made some dozen successful flights in the Kowel area but felt limited by the generally flat terrain there and presented his glider to ZASPL, the aviation students association of Lviv Polytechnic, who seem to have made no use of it.

Iverson graduated from the University of Michigan with her Medical Doctorate degree. After a few years of medical work, she became a medical missionary at the Arabian Mission. Marrying Dr. Arthur King Bennett in 191, they relocated to Busrah, Arabia where the couple continued missionary work at the Lansing Memorial Hospital. She was known for her impact on treating large numbers of patients, both at the Lansing Hospital and in the surrounding area. Additionally, when World War I limited her travel, Iverson began using the hospital specifically to treat wounded soldiers. In 1916, an outbreak of typhoid fever occurred and, while treating infected individuals, she contracted typhoid fever, resulting in her death at age 35 in 1916.  Early life  Anna Christine Iverson was born on January 4, 1881 in Denmark. In 1893, at the age of 12, she immigrated to the United States with her family, settling in South Dakota near a Sioux Indian Reservation. While in primary school, Iverson wrote of herself reading The Post of Honor. According to self- proclamation, the story about missionary life in Madagascar portrayed in the book motivated her to pursue missionary work.  Education  Iverson attended primary school in Chamberlain, South Dakota. Due to familial relocation to a town near Yankton, South Dakota, she received her high school education at Yankton. Following the completion of high school, she enrolled at Yankton College for one year before dedicating two years to teaching in efforts to raise funds for medical school. In 1907, Iverson received her Medical Doctorate from the Department of Medicine and Surgery at the University of Michigan, where she was Assistant Demonstrator of Anatomy and Secretary of the Medical School class of 1907.  Personal life  After setting out to Bahrein with the intention of providing care to women, Dr. Iverson connected with Arthur King Bennett, an individual she knew from the University of Michigan. On September 25, 1911, Iverson and her husband were married in Simla, Bengal, India. The two then moved to Busrah, Arabia to pursue medical missionary work. On July 9, 1912, while in Busrah, she gave birth to her only son, Matthew Cole Bennett.  Career  = Pre-Missionary Work = While still attending medical school at the University of Michigan, Iverson worked as a nurse simultaneously to raise money for her education at various medical facilities in Ann Arbor. She excelled in pathology and was sworn into Phi Beta Kappa. Upon graduation, Iverson worked at the Michigan Asylum for the Insane as both an attendant and medical intern. She received a $16.00 monthly salary and oversaw most laboratory work with the help of her future successor, Dr. Maud M Rees. After two years, Iverson applied for missionary work through the Arabian Mission, resulting in her departure from the asylum on September 1, 1909. = The Arabian Mission = After her marriage to Arthur King Bennett in 1911, Iverson and her husband went to Busrah, Arabia to conduct missionary work at the Lansing Memorial Hospital. While at Lansing, Iverson focused primarily on the medical treatment of women, however, she did not hesitate to collaborate with her husband on difficult cases. Despite primarily treating adult female patients, she also dedicated some of her time towards conducting bacteriological work. With her husband she took on collective tasks including the vaccination of all willing individuals against the bubonic plague and the creation of a community for leper patients, consisting of huts that were erected around the hospital for patients to live in as they received treatment. The various aspects of Lansing Memorial Hospital, combined with the success of both doctors, resulted in the hospital becoming self-sufficient while simultaneously being the only hospital within a 300-mile radius. Due to the isolated nature of the hospital Iverson would often use her afternoons to conduct home visits but stopped doing so at the beginning of World War I. = Wartime Missionary = In November 1914, Turkey began its engagement in World War I. As Turkish involvement in the war began, Iverson and her husband treated wounded soldiers at the Lansing Memorial Hospital under supervision of the Turkish Red Crescent. Due to the influx of patients, only serious cases received treatment at the hospital, all other patients were sent to various churches and school buildings among the missions. On 21, 1914, the British arrived in Busrah. Iverson and her husband, again, provided care for the wounded soldiers. As the war progressed, the hospital maintained elevated numbers of patients to the point where British forces supplied additional hospital staff and doctors and Iverson worked under the auspices of the Red Cross and the British treating war-related injuries until 1916.  Death  In 1916, a group of Turkish soldiers, sick with malaria, were sent from a prisoner's camp to the hospital where Dr. Christine Iverson Bennett had worked. Illness, in the form of a fever, quickly spread from the Turkish soldiers to members of the hospital staff. Iverson's husband soon fell sick and was relocated to the central military hospital for treatment. While treating the sick and wounded, Iverson contracted typhoid fever. She died in the central military hospital on March 29, 1916 at age 35, after completing four years of service at Busrah. Her funeral service took place a few miles from Busrah at a European cemetery at Marghill. Mr. Van Ess, an individual from the mission, conducted Dr. Christine Iverson Bennett's funeral service and many important individuals, including the military governors of Busrah and Ashar and Sir Percy Cox, were in attendance.

In both universes, Alpha is the leader of a group of survivors called the Whisperers, a mysterious group that wears the skins of walkers to mask their presence. In the television series, she first appeared in the ninth mid- season premiere. Appearances =Comic book series= Alpha is the leader of the Whisperers, a mysterious group of survivors who disguise themselves with roamer skin to blend in with them and not get noticed, and Lydia's mother. She and several of her people approach the gates of the Hilltop Colony, and exchange Ken and Dante for Lydia. When Carl chases the Whisperers, he is taken prisoner. Alpha decides to infiltrate the Alexandria Safe-Zone and buys a sword at the fair. After meeting Rick, she allows Carl and Lydia to leave the Whisperers, on the condition that nobody will cross a new border she marked. On their way back, Rick and the group discover that Alpha has decapitated twelve residents of Alexandria, the Hilltop, the Kingdom and the Sanctuary, and that she used their heads placed on pikes to mark the border. After Negan appears to have joined her group, he fatally slashes Alpha across the neck and decapitates her.The Walking Dead #156 =Television series= Alpha is the leader of the Whisperers, a mysterious group of hostile survivors who disguise themselves with the skin of the undead in order to blend in with them and not get noticed, and the mother of Lydia. She also served as the primary antagonist of the second half of season nine and whole of season ten. Alpha's dark past is shown in flashbacks; it is revealed that she killed her husband Frank and their group of survivors during the initial stages of the outbreak, believing them to be \\"weak\\". In the present, she shows up at the Hilltop Colony with some members of her group, demanding that the community return her daughter Lydia, whom the community is holding as their prisoner; Lydia is eventually returned. It is later revealed that the Whisperers murdered and beheaded several key members from each community to warn the communities not to cross into their territory. The beheaded members' heads were placed on spikes, marking the boundary of the new border. Alpha is eventually murdered and beheaded herself by Negan, who had formed an intimate relationship with her. He subsequently delivers her head to Carol with whom he had been working with the whole time. Season 9 In the mid-season premiere, \\"Adaptation\\", Alpha leads a group of Whisperers who captured Alden and Luke, luring them into a trap by setting up a trail of arrows for them to follow. She brandishes a sawed-off shotgun at them and proclaims: \\"Trail ends here.\\" In the episode \\"Omega\\", Lydia, who has been captured and held in a cell at the Hilltop Colony, tells her story (shown through flashbacks) to Daryl and Henry, bonding with the latter in the process. At the end of the episode, at the Hilltop's front gate, the Whisperers' leader, Lydia's mother, now known as Alpha, appears unmasked and introduces herself. Alpha announces to the Hilltop residents that she wants only one thing from them: her daughter. In the episode \\"Bounty\\", Alpha demands that the Hilltop residents turn over her daughter Lydia. She explains that she has removed her walker mask to show them that she comes in peace and that she is willing to overlook their trespassing on her lands. Daryl decides to walk outside to talk to Alpha face to face; the two meet. He is initially dismissive of Alpha's demands as she and her human allies are few compared to the Hilltop forces. However, there are several more of Alpha's allies in wait beyond the tree line, as well as a horde of walkers. Daryl tells Alpha that she can't have Lydia and informs her that he's ready to fight her people to ensure she doesn't get Lydia back, until he spots one of the Whisperers with a baby. Suddenly, a couple of Whisperers bring forward a tied up Alden and Luke. Alpha then offers to trade both of them for her daughter; Daryl accepts. As the standoff continues, a baby belonging to one of the disguised women starts to cry, drawing the walkers. Alpha shrugs at the mother, indicating that she should leave the baby to die. Fearing for her life and not having any other choice, the baby's mother decides to abandon him as he continues to cry. Alden and Luke beg Alpha to spare the baby, but Alpha refuses; Connie rushes to save the child. Lydia ultimately opts to leave on her own accord and is traded for Alden and Luke. Reunited, Lydia apologizes to her mother, but is smacked by Alpha across the face, ordering her to address her as \\"Alpha\\" like everyone else. She then smiles at Daryl as they leave. In the episode \\"Guardians\\", as Alpha leads her group back to camp, she questions Lydia about her time at the Hilltop and to reveal any intel she learned while being held captive, but her daughter claims that there was little of interest. Henry eventually catches up with Lydia and the Whisperers, and watches them from a close distance as they rest, but is found and grabbed by Beta, Alpha's second-in-command. Beta tosses Henry in front of Alpha, who questions the boy. Henry reveals that he came alone to get Lydia; Alpha decides that Henry is coming with them. On their way back to camp, Alpha asks Lydia why she didn't mention Henry. Lydia explains that he wasn't worth mentioning, but Alpha reminds her that he just risked his life to save her, so she must be lying. The Whisperers soon arrive back at their camp. There, Alpha taunts a secured Henry and explains to him why they disguise themselves as walkers, as the strong adapt while the weak die. Seconds later, two of her own, Sean and Helen, approach her. The couple questions Alpha about why they went to the Hilltop to give up two strangers up for her daughter. Alpha then reminds them that she did it to get information, but Sean issues a challenge for her leadership role. In response, Alpha confirms that he has the right to challenge her position, but that she also has the right to defend it. Knowing that it was Helen that has been sowing seeds of discontent within the group, Alpha grabs Helen and decapitates her with a piece of wire. She then hands the head over to a sobbing Sean before fatally stabbing him in the stomach, as Henry looks on in horror. Privately, Alpha tells Beta a story about Lydia when she was three-years-old. They both then agree that Henry can be useful and that they need to find out if Lydia truly has feelings for him. At night, Beta brings Henry to Alpha. Unmasked, Alpha drops her knife and makes Lydia pick it up, commanding her to kill Henry with it so that she can prove who's side she's on; Lydia picks up the knife and begins to cry. Her mother warns her not to be weak and that Beta will kill them both if she doesn't kill Henry. Suddenly, a small horde of walkers show up and begin eating the unmasked Whisperers, creating mass confusion. Alpha and the others quickly put on their masks so that they can try to lure the herd away. Moments later, Daryl and Connie arrive disguised as Whisperers to free and rescue Henry, who will not leave without Lydia, and together the four escape. In the episode \\"The Calm Before\\", as the fair at the Kingdom begins, Alpha leads an attack on one caravan from the Hilltop going to the Kingdom. Alpha has snuck into the fair, posing as one of the Alexandria fairgoers from the caravan and gathers intel. That night, as most of the fairgoers gather for the film, Lydia is saving a seat for Henry when Alpha quietly sits next to her and gestures for her to stay quiet. Outside the theater, Alpha tries to convince Lydia to come with her, but Lydia rejects her. Alpha tells her she is not strong and no longer part of her group, and departs. Later, at the Whisperers' new camp, Alpha, now out of disguise, joins her people, and approaches Daryl, Michonne, Carol, and Yumiko, who were captured by Beta and are now tied to a tree. After announcing that her daughter is no longer a concern, Alpha takes out a shotgun and tells Daryl to come with her alone. At dawn, Alpha leads Daryl to the top of a cliff where a gargantuan horde of walkers and Whisperers walk beneath them. She tells him that his friends at the camp are fine and that she has marked off a line which is the extent of their lands, but the next time his people cross into her land she'll release the horde into theirs. Daryl asks if she killed Lydia, and Alpha tells him that she didn't kill her and doubts that Daryl can protect her. He tells her that she's wrong and leaves, and reunites with his friends. Back in her camp, Alpha, in private, begins to tear up over the loss of her daughter. However, a Whisperer accidentally witnesses her crying. In response, Alpha winds up killing the Whisperer by stabbing him in the neck, making sure no one ever sees her being weak. Daryl's group finds a line of ten decapitated heads on pikes made up of Ozzy, Alek, D.J., Frankie, Tammy Rose, Rodney, Addy, Enid, Tara, and Henry, meant to signify Alpha's territory boundary. In the season finale, \\"The Storm\\", in their camp, Alpha reminds Beta that she'll need to be strong for what comes next and Beta assures her she will be. Per Alpha's request, Beta flogs her arm with a branch to make her stronger, leaving several lashes on her arm, as she used to do to Lydia. Season 10 In the episode \\"We Are the End of the World\\", flashbacks reveal Alpha's first encounter with Beta. In the present, Alpha orders Beta to collect more walkers from a nearby parking garage, having him take two sisters with him. At the garage, Beta successfully lures the walkers to follow, but one of the sisters, Frances, who Alpha had forced to leave her baby behind at the Hilltop Colony (shown in \\"Bounty\\"), believes she hears a baby crying nearby and panics, causing the walkers to turn on them. Beta rescues Frances and they return to their camp without the walkers. There, Beta is ready to kill Frances, but Alpha takes Frances for a talk, and Frances cries and repents. Beta becomes concerned that Alpha did not punish Frances for showing weakness, and wonders why they have not attacked the other groups. He follows her to their old camp and discovers Alpha has set up a small shrine to Lydia, including her old bunny doll. Alpha admits Lydia is still alive and has shown weakness in not attacking the communities. Beta assures her that she was made for this world. Alpha destroys the shrine, and together with Beta, repeat the Whisperers' code: \\"We Are the End of the World\\". Alpha asserts they will soon attack the communities. Just then, they see the fire trail of the fallen satellite overhead and crash nearby, drawing walkers to them. Amidst the chaos, Frances sees one walker with a baby carrier and again panics and Alpha rushes in to try to save her but is overwhelmed. Frances' sister rushes in, dragging Alpha to safety after pushing Frances away from her and into the mob of walkers, who then kill Frances. As the Whisperers find shelter, Alpha is impressed with Frances' sister's sacrifice and dubs her Gamma. The Whisperers go to investigate the fallen satellite, and Alpha, pulling her mask off, eyes Carol from across a ravine. In the episode \\"Ghosts\\", Alpha sends Gamma to Alexandria to inform Michonne, Daryl and Carol to meet with Alpha at the border. There, Alpha threatens them to not cross her borders again, but proceeds to take more of their land after Carol failed to shoot her. In the episode \\"What It Always Is\\", Alpha devises a plan to attack her enemies slowly. She ordered Gamma to use guardians to pollute the river that the communities used to supply themselves with water, and when her apprentice returned to the camp to ask for another walker, Alpha ended up with one of her subjects who had challenged her attack strategies and handed it to him for use in his mission once he converted. When Gamma showed Alpha her injured hand covered by bandages that one of her enemies had given her, the deranged woman confessed that she understood her actions assuming that it was a necessary sacrifice and commented that the man who had helped her could be useful to them. In the episode \\"Bonds\\", when Negan was discovered prowling within her territory, Alpha decided to perform some tests to determine if he was strong enough to speak to her and put him in charge of his right hand. Although Beta expressed her discontent at having the newcomer within the group, Alpha asked him if he had finally decided to challenge her to take command of the Whisperers but he flatly refused and knelt before her promising that he would never again question her decisions. However, Alpha was completely disappointed when Beta informed her that Negan had died in her final test, but it was more her surprise when Negan appeared in the camp and knelt before her swearing his full loyalty; Alpha accepted him as a member of the group. In the episode \\"Open Your Eyes\\", after finding Gamma in the middle of the forest, Alpha quickly asked her about the information she had gotten from Aaron about his community, but was disappointed when Gamma only managed to find out his name and that he has a daughter. Noticing signs of weakness in her apprentice, Alpha ordered Gamma to remove her mask and eventually proceeded to strike her arm so that she could stay strong; Alpha reminds Gamma that the enemy was using her and that she should not allow herself to fall into Aaron's charms. In the mid-season finale, \\"The World Before\\", after questioning Gamma's loyalty to the group, Alpha decided to move her gigantic horde of walkers away from their former hideout to lock them inside a nearby cave. After witnessing how her enemies once again entered her territory in search of her horde, Alpha came into view of Carol to attract her attention and proceeded to run towards the forest to enter the cave. Thus, the group followed her to the place and eventually they fell into their trap of being locked in the depths of the site at the mercy of hundreds of walkers. In the mid-season premiere, \\"Squeeze\\", seeking that her enemies did not escape from the cave, Alpha watched them from a satisfied distance and ordered her men to make sure they don't escape. After returning to the camp, Alpha revealed to Beta and Gamma what had happened, assuming that their enemies were spying on them at all times, and entrusted the latter to go to the border to leave a message for their Alexandria spy. While relieving herself in an impromptu latrine, Alpha received a visit from Negan who suggested that the traitor she was looking for might be inside the camp and listed Gamma as solely responsible for playing for two sides due to the trust that Gamma had in her. Despite distrusting the theory of the man claiming that he only wanted to cause paranoia among his followers, Alpha began to consider that Negan's words made sense and corroborated this when Beta informed him that the guards had not seen Gamma reach the border. Knowing that she had to pay for everything she had done, Alpha ordered her right hand to track down the girl and bring her before her so that he could punish her in front of the entire pack. As a way of compensating for his great contribution, Alpha escorted Negan to the far reaches of his camp and, aware of vulgar behavior that the man transmitted during his stay in the group, decided to pay him in the same way. Ordering Negan to undress, Alpha approached him also without clothes and only keeping her walker mask; they proceed to kiss. In the episode \\"Stalker\\", Alpha together with her men prepare a walker horde to attack the Hilltop, when suddenly Daryl appears and ambushes them, killing her henchmen. Alpha and Daryl then begin a hand-to-hand fight where the two both end up being seriously injured. However, her attempt to get rid of Daryl was in vain and unable to do it on her own. Alpha remained lying on the ground while bleeding to death and thanked the badly injured Daryl for helping her to become stronger, but was offended when he accused her of getting away from her daughter for the simple fact that she did not love her. When Lydia appeared at the scene, Alpha was more than happy to see that she was safe and urged her to finish her off in order to take the leadership of the Whisperers, but she felt nothing but disappointment when her daughter assured that the only reason for the one who had approached her was so that she could save Daryl. Later, after being found by her retinues, Alpha promised them that they would take revenge on the communities with her horde and recited the group's motto thus declaring the imminent war that was coming. In the episode \\"Morning Star\\", as she led her horde of walkers straight to the Hilltop, her plan to finish off her enemies was corrected by Negan, who proposed to Alpha that instead of destroying all of them she should force them to surrender so that they could join her troops. However, the deranged woman once arriving at the Hilltop allowed her people to attack the community as planned. When Negan expressed confusion regarding the way he understood her proposal, Alpha assured him that her enemies would soon join her as part of her horde. In the episode \\"Walk with Us\\", Alpha is not satisfied with the aftermath of the Hilltop fire as she still does not have everything she wants‚ÄîLydia. Negan later captures Lydia and brings Alpha to her supposed location where Alpha intends to kill her daughter so that Lydia will always be with her as part of Alpha's horde. However, this proves to be a trap and Negan slits Alpha's throat, killing her. Negan then delivers Alpha's severed zombified head to Carol with whom he had been working with the whole time. In the episode \\"Look at the Flowers\\", Carol places Alpha's zombified head onto a pike at the border in the same manner Alpha did with the fair victims. She is subsequently haunted by hallucinations of Alpha, representing Carol's wish to die. Beta and two other Whisperers later discover Alpha's severed head. Enraged, Beta forces one of the men to allow Alpha to bite him after he mistakenly identifies Beta as the \\"new Alpha\\". He then carries Alpha's head to a hotel connected to Beta's past as a famous musician known as \\"Half Moon\\" and spends the night using his old music to draw in a massive herd. In the morning, Beta thanks Alpha before putting her down with a knife to the head. He then removes part of Alpha's face and uses it to repair his ripped walker mask. Development and reception Samantha Morton was chosen for the role to portray the leader of the Whisperers. Alpha is portrayed by Samantha Morton on The Walking Dead television series, beginning with the ninth season. The episode \\"Adaptation\\" marks the first appearance of Morton as the leader of the Whisperers. Her casting was first announced in July 2018. Morton joined the main cast as of the episode \\"Omega\\", as her name appears in the opening credits. For her role as Alpha, Morton cut and shaved her real hair for this episode. Morton said regarding doing it on camera, \\"Oh, I loved it. It just feels very real, and what the audience is seeing is real, you know? And there's emotions about that, but the practicalities for pre- Alpha is that the hair, she's turning herself into something. She's metamorphosing from a caterpillar to a butterfly, but not the nicest butterfly, you know? She's completely changing who she is, and whether that's trauma and something to do with the brain, or that she just found her true self that she's able to be because of what's happening to the world.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes, the critical consensus for \\"Omega\\" reads: \\"'Omega' utilizes an unreliable narrator to flesh out the zombie skin-clad fanatic Alpha and succeeds at making her all the more unnerving, but some viewers may find the episode's flashback structure and side plots to be more laborious than revelatory.\\" The critical consensus for the following episode \\"Guardians\\" reads: \\"'Guardians' presents dual stories of tested leadership with thematic resonance and provides the malevolent Alpha a plump opportunity to demonstrate her villainy -- although The Walking Dead is still withholding crucial context from viewers longing to understand the motivations of their heroes.\\" In his review for \\"The Calm Before\\", Erik Kain of Forbes wrote: \\"Alpha uses the woman's scalp and its long golden locks as a disguise. She enters the Kingdom and walks about Ezekiel's fair. She even has a (very creepy) conversation with the King, who doesn't seem to notice how weird this woman is.\\" Writing for Den of Geek, Ron Hogan in his review wrote: \\"The creative team is able to dial it back, sprinkling moments of hopefulness in front of Alpha. Unlike Lydia, who was taken in by it, she's repulsed, and while it doesn't show on her face, it shows in her actions, and her talk with Daryl at shotgun-point. The very same incidents strike two related people totally differently, and in the denouement of the episode, the very things that lend sweetness and happiness end up causing the greatest in bittersweet pain.\\" Commenting on the decapitation border, Jeff Stone of IndieWire wrote: \\"It is kind of funny how Alpha seemed to know how important each character was and ordered them accordingly.\\" Alex McLevy of The A.V. Club wrote: \\"Alpha showing the walker horde to Daryl is a strong narrative conceit, the equivalent of warning your enemy by holding up an ICBM and saying you're not afraid to use it.\\" References American female characters in television Characters created by Robert Kirkman Comics characters introduced in 2014 Fictional child abusers Fictional child killers Fictional cult leaders Fictional mariticides Fictional mass murderers Fictional women soldiers and warriors The Walking Dead characters ","title":"Alpha (The Walking Dead)"},{"id":"58323032","text":"Beta is a fictional character in the comic book series The Walking Dead and the television series of the same name, where he was portrayed by Ryan Hurst. In both universes, Beta is the second-in-command of the Whisperers, serving as Alpha's right-hand man and after her death, becomes de-facto leader of the Whisperers. Also in both universes, Beta is a famous celebrity before the apocalypse; in the comic books, he was a basketball player and an actor, and in the television series it was revealed in an episode of the companion series, Fear the Walking Dead (where Hurst made an uncredited cameo appearance), that he was a country musician as he was seen on the cover of an album that was released before the apocalypse, and it is later revealed in the main TV series that his stage name was \\"Half Moon\\". Appearances =Comic book series= Beta is Alpha's right-hand man who carries two knives. In an encounter with Michonne and Aaron, Beta stabs Aaron and attempts to kill Michonne until Dwight and several members of the Militia save them. Upon arriving at the Whisperers' camp, he confronts Negan for lying and attempts to kill him; however, Beta is thwarted by Alpha. In response to the untimely death of Alpha, Beta takes a leadership position and declares war on the communities. During the war, he kills Gabriel and several other members of the Militia. He eventually fights Negan in order to get revenge for Alpha's death, but is injured after Negan bashes \\"Lucille\\" on his back several times. Near the end of the war, he and few other Whisperers unleash a large herd of walkers on Alexandria. In a decisive fight, while Beta is fighting against Jesus, Aaron shoots him through the chest. He then blacks out as they pull off his mask and recognize him as a famous celebrity. =Television series= Season 9 Beta appears for the first time in the episode \\"Guardians\\" when he discovers Henry following the Whisperers in order to save Lydia; he grabs Henry and presents the boy to Alpha. That night, Alpha orders her daughter to execute Henry with a knife to prove which side she is on, but Lydia refuses and Alpha then orders Beta to execute them both. Suddenly, the appearance of several walkers in the camp puts the camp in chaos; Alpha and Beta went to help the others. Moments later, Daryl and Connie, who created the distraction, arrive unnoticed to rescue Henry. However, they also take Lydia at Henry's insistence. In the episode \\"Chokepoint\\", Beta comforts a dying Whisperer, and then takes a group of Whisperers and walkers with him to go find Lydia on Alpha's orders. The next morning, the group manages to spot them in an abandoned building. Beta and his team quickly break in, and discover a trap meant to separate them from the dead. Soon after, Daryl and Beta have a one-on-one duel in which Beta announces that all he wants is \\"the girl\\". However, Daryl manages to shove Beta down an elevator shaft. Shortly after, Beta rises in pain and peers up, enraged, and covered in blood, with his bottom front teeth having been knocked out from the more than two-story fall. In the episode \\"The Calm Before\\", a group of walkers ambush Daryl, Michonne, Carol and Yumiko during the night; they take them out one by one until a group of Whisperers surround them. Beta, who managed to find a way out of the elevator shaft, emerges from the trees and orders the group to drop their weapons. He then approaches and growls at Daryl, who is taken by surprise since he thought Beta was dead, and reminds Daryl that all he had to do was hand over Lydia and that this initial deal is now off. Back at the camp, after Alpha showed Daryl what her people are capable of doing if they ever crossed their borders again, Beta approached Alpha to ask her about what happened with Lydia. He is only told by Alpha that she wanted to be left alone so that she can endure her pain by herself; Beta obeys and leaves her alone. In the season finale \\"The Storm\\", a few months have passed since the massacre at the fair. After surviving a great storm that swept through the Whisperers' entire territory, the Whisperers proceed to reassemble their camp while Beta privately meets with a disconsolate Alpha; he informs her that the time away has been good for the pack. When this new information assures her, Alpha reminds Beta that she will need to be strong for what comes next; he assures her that she will be. Alpha then hands Beta a branch and stretches her left arm out. Beta, without hesitation, begins to wound her by whipping her arm with the branch to make her stronger. Season 10 In the episode \\"We Are the End of the World\\", it is discovered in flashbacks the origin and past of a then unstable Beta, and what happened before he formed the Whisperers with Alpha, who he meets in an abandoned sanatorium along with Lydia. However, they distrusted each other as they were getting to know each other, but after Alpha discovered Beta's face, both began to develop a mutual trust. In the present, Alpha orders Beta to collect more walkers from a nearby parking lot and take the two sisters (Mary and Frances) with him. In the garage, Beta attracts the walkers successfully, but Frances, whom Alpha had forced to leave her newborn at the Hilltop Colony, believes she hears a baby crying nearby and enters into a panic, causing the walkers to turn against them. Beta then rescues Frances and returns to camp without the walkers. There, Beta is ready to execute Frances, but Alpha instead takes Frances to talk privately where Frances cries and regrets her actions. Beta then begins worrying why Alpha chose not to punish Frances for showing weakness and wonders why they have not attacked the other communities yet. Later, Beta follows Alpha and discovers that she has made a small shrine for Lydia. Alpha then admits to an angered Beta that she lied about killing Lydia and that she is still alive, and breaks down telling Beta that she couldn't bring herself to kill her daughter. She then destroys the shrine and pleads with him to keep secret about Lydia being alive; Beta promises that he will. In the episode \\"What It Always Is\\", after a Whisperer defies Alpha's strategies, Beta tries to kill him but is stopped by Alpha. She then cuts the Whisperer on his arm and leg, and hands the knife to Beta, who approaches the injured Whisperer and slashes him on the back of his neck to finish the job. That night, Beta and a group of Whisperers arrive at one of their borders after hearing the yells of a man‚ÄîNegan. Beta confronts and throws Negan to the ground before he can keep killing their walkers. In the episode \\"Bonds\\", Beta and the Whisperers escort a blindfolded Negan, who is interested in joining the Whisperers, through the woods after capturing him. When Negan keeps talking and making jokes, Beta puts his knives to Negan's throat and demands him to be quiet as he told him that he is too loud. Negan apologizes and introduces himself, explaining that he has been a prisoner of their enemy for eight years and is willing to reveal their secrets. Upon arriving at their camp, Beta argues with Alpha that Negan should be killed because he could not be trusted and the he doesn't belong with them. Alpha notes that Beta has been questioning her rather often lately and asks if he is finally challenging her. Beta kneels in submission and vows that he will never challenge her; Alpha forgives him. Later that day, Beta forces Negan to do a series of tasks, including digging graves, skinning walkers and help hunt a wild boar to prove his worthiness. That night, Beta tells Negan that he has not earned the right to eat with them and throws him to the ground. He then notices in anger as another Whisperer shares some of his meal with Negan. A while later, Beta takes Negan to walk among one of their herds in the woods as his final task. However, after Beta unleashed anger again upon hearing more jokes from Negan, Beta assured Negan that he'll never be one of them because he's too loud and weak. Beta then kills the Whisperer that shared his meal with Negan in response and walks away, leaving Negan to fend for himself with only a pocket knife. The next morning, Beta returns to the camp and informs Alpha that Negan died because he was weak, but is suddenly left in shock when a blood-covered Negan arrives back and kneels in front of Alpha to introduce himself and offer his loyalty to her. He then watches Alpha as she accepts Negan. In the mid-season premiere \\"Squeeze\\", while he was guarding the camp, Beta was informed by Alpha that the enemy had crossed the border to go to the national park where the entire horde was and listened carefully as their leader instructed Gamma to go to the border to inform his spies about the situation. However, when the girl never reached her destination, Alpha began to suspect that the traitor was actually her and ordered Beta to track her down, who alleged that he would murder her for what he had done but her wishes were quickly refuted by Alpha, who assured that she would personally punish her in front of the entire herd. In the episode \\"Stalker\\", Beta enters Alexandria in the middle of the night through an underground tunnel that one of his spies had created, Beta proceeded to brutally murder several alexandrians who were in their homes and patiently waited for them to transform into walkers as a way to create a distraction to be able to search for Gamma without any problem. Locating the girl inside a cell, Beta ordered him to surrender ensuring that her death would be painless in case she did not fight him but before he could accomplish his task, Laura's arrival allowed Mary to escape and Beta was threatened by the woman with a spear. However, the whisperer managed to get rid of his adversary and quickly followed his prey to the Grimes' house, where he began to search for each room until he was shot down by Judith in the chest. Surviving the little girl's attack thanks to her bulletproof vest, Beta once again faced more of her enemies and while preparing to end Rosita's life, the man was interrupted when Mary threatened to commit suicide if she did not leave her opponent alone. and finally to avoid further slaughter, the girl accepted the fate that awaited her and surrendered to the big man. Despite having fulfilled his mission to capture the deserter, the trip back to thecamp was nevertheless frustrated with the arrival of a group of alexandrians, who without thinking twice opened fire on Beta and the whisperer had no choice but to leave Gamma back to save your life. In the episode \\"Morning Star\\", Beta has declared war on the communities, and was tasked with extracting sap from various trees and later commanded his men through the horde on their way to Hilltop. Once arrived at the community, Beta took full charge of her group's battle tactics, devising a clever plan that consisted of using the sap to spray her enemies with it and then firing flaming arrows to set fire to everything in its path. In the episode \\"Walk with Us\\", Beta observes the remnants of the battle and wiping out the remaining survivors, Beta realized that Alpha was not satisfied with all the destruction he had caused because he had not found his daughter and personally offered to search for her in the surroundings. In the process, Beta found Mary wiping out a few walkers and quickly stabbed her in the belly, but she futilely tried to attack the deranged man by removing part of his mask and eventually died in his hands. What happened was contemplated by a whisperer, who confessed to Beta to recognize him but before he could continue speaking, this ended the man. Waiting for the girl to revive as a walker, Beta did not have time to take her with his group when Alden finished her off from a distance, and noting that she was at a disadvantage, he escaped in terror from her reach. In the episode \\"Look at the Flowers\\", after finding Alpha's zombified head embedded in a pike, Beta flatly refused to occupy the woman's rank within The Whisperers and punished one of his companions who proclaimed him their leader. While walking through an abandoned town in search of new walkers for his horde, Beta entered a bar where several pieces of music were found and while inspecting him he found several memories of his time as a singer; destroying all traces that made him face his past. However, after reflecting on everything he had that made him remember his professional career, Beta agreed to listen to a recording of one of his concerts on the record player and, in turn, took the opportunity to attract all the walkers who were in the zone. After thanking the walker Alpha for all she had done for him, Beta ended his miserable existence and removed part of the woman's face to replace the part of her mask that had been damaged; subsequently guiding the gigantic horde of walkers towards their enemies. In the episode \\"The Tower\\", Beta and the Whisperers as a new leader, has finally brought the horde to Alexandria, but finds it apparently empty. Meanwhile, as the horde sweeps Alexandria, Beta watches from the base of the mill. As he discusses his next assault with the other Whisperers, Beta hears voices in his head. Inform the other Whisperers that they will head towards Oceanside. Unbeknownst to him, Alden is checking him out from the top floor of the mill, who is communicating information to Aaron through signs. Beta almost discovers Alden, but finally decides to take the retreat. Beta is seen leading the horde towards Oceanside, but suddenly stops when he feels something is wrong. He complains that the survivors are not stupid and begins to suspect that they are leading them into a trap. Another Whisperer tries to reassure Beta, but in doing so, he accidentally calls him \\"Alpha\\". Despite his remorse, Beta prepares to kill the Whisperer, but the voice in his head stops him. Beta asks the voice to show him the way, but urges him to be patient and have faith in his strength. With that, Beta continues on with the horde, at the leadership of the horde and The Whisperers, Beta talks to himself and continues to hear voices in his head. Just then, he sees a cat crossing the street. The voice is now manifested in a walker marching alongside Beta, who tells him that faith will be rewarded. Beta laughs tortuously. Beta has finally arrived at the Tower with the horde and its minions. He begins to sing and hallucinates the walkers too. In the season finale \\"A Certain Doom,\\" Beta continues to lead the herd and the Whisperers, but Daryl and several others infiltrate the horde using the walker guts trick and draw the horde away with a sound system hooked up to a wagon. The Whisperers eventually manage to destroy the wagon, forcing Daryl's group to infiltrate the horde once again and take out the Whisperers one by one. Spotting Lydia steering the herd away, Beta begins to follow her, but is confronted by Negan. Taking the former leader of the Saviors down, Beta prepares to kill him in revenge for the death of Alpha, but is attacked by Daryl who stabs Beta through both eyes. Beta flashes back on his life as a Whisperer before he is devoured by the horde, a fate he gladly accepts. As Beta is devoured, his mask is ripped off, shocking Negan who recognizes who Beta really is though Daryl simply calls him \\"nobody.\\" With Beta and the Whisperers gone, Carol and Lydia are able to lead the horde over a cliff, ending their threat once and for all. =Fear the Walking Dead= Season 5 In the episode \\"Today and Tomorrow\\", a photo of Beta, on his records, before the apocalypse is seen being carried by Daniel Salazar, but he is forced to abandon them after walkers attack. Development and reception Ryan Hurst portrays Beta Beta is portrayed by Ryan Hurst. The character entered the recurring cast of the credits beginning with the episode \\"Guardians\\" of the ninth season. However, Hurst was promoted to a series regular starting the tenth season. Erik Kain of Forbes praised the development of Hurst, writing: \\"Beta is pretty awesome. Ryan Hurst was a great casting choice and I have high hopes for his character. That zombie-skinning scene was pretty gross also.\\" In his review for \\"Chokepoint\\", Kain wrote that \\"Beta is terrifying\\" and \\"that whole fight scene was just phenomenal.\\" He went on to say that \\"'Chokepoint' was, for the most part, a fantastic episode. It's certainly the first episode of 9B that had me on the edge of my seat. Mostly that's because of Beta (Sons of Anarchys Ryan Hurst) who is just wonderfully scary and intimidating. The guy is huge, for one thing (at 6'4\\" he's got an inch on me) and in his trenchcoat and walker skin he's quite the striking figure, whether shambling slowly with his \\"guardians\\" or charging through a wall to attack Daryl.\\" In a review of the episode \\"Look at the Flowers\\" Kain praised the development of Hurst's character and wrote: \\"This was mostly a very good episode. Beta is a very scary guy, and the end suggests that the full force of his wrath and vengeance is about to be unleashed on our heroes\\". Ron Hogan writing for Den of Geek praised Hurst's work and wrote: \\"Ryan Hurst is an excellent goon for Alpha, because what she lacks in physical prowess, he more than makes up for. What he lacks in organizational management, she more than makes up for by being the face and voice of the organization.\\" He also positively commented on Ryan Hurst as Beta by the episode \\"Stalker\\", stating that he \\"does a brilliant job of simply lurking in the background of scenes like a true Michael Myers type.\\" Kirsten Acuna of Business Insider interviewed Hurst in which Hurst said: \\"Probably about a year ago, I had this premonition that I was going to be on the show. It was so strong that I actually called my agent and my manager, and I said, 'Hey, can you call over to The Walking Dead and tell them that I'd like to be on the show?'\\" Hurst said his agent and manager told him that's not exactly how it works, and that he needs to audition for the show, but Hurst was persistent. He then said: \\"'Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, but just cold call the producers and say,' 'Hey, Ryan Hurst would like to be on the show,' and they did. And the producers got back to them and they said, 'No, he can't be on the show right now. We'll let you know.'\\" References Characters created by Robert Kirkman Comics characters introduced in 2016 Drama television characters Fictional actors Fictional basketball players Fictional characters with psychiatric disorders Fictional mass murderers Fictional musicians Fictional serial killers Fictional torturers Male characters in television Male horror film villains The Walking Dead characters ","title":"Beta (The Walking Dead)"},{"id":"58323033","text":"Germ√°n Villegas Villegas (3 December 1943 ‚Äì 25 August 2018) was a Colombian politician.

Carl's lingering feelings for Sophia finally ends their relationship,The Walking Dead #187 although they remain close friends.The Walking Dead #193 =Television series= Lydia is a survivor who, along with her parents, \\"Alpha\\" and Frank, survived the initial stages of the zombie apocalypse. After 23 days of the initial outbreak, Lydia and her parents remained in a moldy basement with a group of survivors. After Frank dies, Alpha raises Lydia with cruelty, treating her more like her servant than her child, to the point of making Lydia call her \\"Alpha\\" instead of \\"momma\\". After being captured by Daryl Dixon and Michonne, and kept as a prisoner in a cell at the Hilltop, Lydia begins to form a bond with Henry. Lydia and Henry fall in love and begin a relationship, with her ultimately rejecting the Whisperers in favor of the other communities who agree to grant Lydia asylum. Lydia rejects the Whisperers completely and is disowned by her mother. However, her relationship with Henry is cut short when Alpha brutally murders him and several other residents of Hilltop. Season 9 In the mid-season premiere \\"Adaptation\\", as Daryl, Michonne, and the others return to the Hilltop, they spot six walkers following them and lure the group into a confrontation on a covered bridge. Three of the \\"walkers\\" turn out to be more humans in disguise. Daryl and Michonne kill two while the third, a young girl, surrenders and is taken prisoner back to the Hilltop. Eventually, Michonne's group returns to the Hilltop and the new threat of humans disguised as walkers is discussed. The girl is locked up and questioned, but she asserts all the others she knew died at the cemetery and the bridge. Daryl later rushes down to interrogate the girl again in earshot of Henry, who is also still locked up for past transgressions. Daryl finds that the girl's mother may still be out there, leading walkers against the various communities. After Daryl leaves, the girl introduces herself as Lydia to Henry and the two start to get to know each other; Daryl overhears this conversation. In the episode \\"Omega\\", Lydia describes her backstory to Henry while both are in the community prison, unaware Daryl is listening in. As Lydia explains, Henry starts to become more compassionate towards Lydia, his own family having gone through similar hardships. Daryl continues to talk to her as well, trying to scope out the size of her group as Lydia claims that they may be coming to save her. He finds her arm covered in marks, which she says came from her mom. Daryl, who had been similarly beaten as a child, displays sympathy for Lydia's abuse, but she proves to still be uncooperative. Lydia's stories are told in flashbacks throughout the episode to the months after the walker outbreak. She and her parents have taken refuge in a Baltimore shelter with others. Lydia's father's sanity starts to unravel and believes the shelter is no longer safe; however, her mother takes more command, willing to kill a survivor sheltering with them who is having a panic attack as she considers him too weak to survive. That night, the survivor turns while Lydia is watching and her father runs to save her, but ends up getting bit. This only serves to harden Lydia's mother, eventually leading them to don the masks made from walkers to survive. In the present, Henry decides to let Lydia out of her cell for a while and discreetly shows her the safety and facilities the Hilltop has to offer. While Lydia has an opportunity to take a hammer and strike Henry with it to escape, the cries of a baby cause her to panic and flashback to her past, and she begs to be returned to her cell. She asks Henry to stay with her through the night. When morning comes, Daryl returns and Lydia states that she doesn't think her mother will be coming, and she was only trying to scope out information for her. Lydia then tells them that her story was a lie, her mother having told her that story to blame her father's death on Lydia. In reality, when the survivor had turned, it wasn't Lydia's father that was bitten, but instead another survivor; her mother took the opportunity to try to make their escape from the shelter, killing Lydia's father when he refused to leave with them. Lydia mentions where her mother and her people may be camped, but notes that they frequently move about. In the episode \\"Bounty\\", Alpha demands that the Hilltop community residents turn over her daughter Lydia. Inside the Hilltop, Daryl discovers that Henry and Lydia escaped. Addy tells him that she knows where they went; she and Enid head out to find them while Daryl stalls. Soon after, Enid and Addy are able to track down Henry and Lydia to an abandoned house near the Hilltop, where Henry has provided Lydia a new set of clothes. Lydia opts to leave on her own accord and is traded for Alden and Luke. Reunited, Lydia apologizes to her mother, but is smacked by Alpha across the face, ordering her to address her as \\"Alpha\\" like everyone else. In the episode \\"Guardians\\", As Alpha leads her group back to camp, she questions Lydia about her time at the Hilltop and to reveal any intel she learned while held captive, but her daughter claims that there was little of interest. Henry eventually catches up with Lydia and the Whisperers, and watches them from a close distance as they rest, but is found and grabbed by Beta, Alpha's second-in-command. Henry reveals that he came alone to get Lydia; Alpha decides that Henry is coming with them. On their way back to camp, Alpha asks Lydia why she didn't mention Henry. Lydia explains that he wasn't worth mentioning, but Alpha reminds her that he just risked his life to save her, so she must be lying. The Whisperers soon arrive back at their camp. At night, Beta takes Henry to Alpha. Unmasked, Alpha drops her knife and makes Lydia pick it up, commanding her to kill Henry with it so that she can prove what side she's on; Lydia picks up the knife and begins to cry. Her mother warns her not to be weak and that Beta will kill them both if she doesn't kill Henry. Suddenly, a small horde of walkers show up and begin eating the unmasked Whisperers, creating mass confusion. Alpha and the others quickly put on their masks so that they can try to lure the herd away. Moments later, Daryl and Connie arrive disguised as Whisperers to free and rescue Henry; they prepare to retreat. Daryl grabs Henry, who grabs Lydia, and together the four escape. In the episode \\"Chokepoint\\", Daryl and Connie flee with Henry and Lydia from a group of Whisperers led by Beta within a horde of walkers. Connie directs them to an uncompleted high-rise that her group had taken shelter in before, where she shows to Daryl that they could isolate the Whisperers by laying an ambush on the upper floors. Unsure about Lydia's trustworthiness, Daryl locks her in a closet with Dog while they prepare for Beta's group to arrive. Lydia, fearing for Henry's safety, breaks out of the closet, in time for Dog to attack a Whisperer that was about to kill Henry, though Henry still ends up injuring his leg. With the Whisperers subdued, the group work to lure the walkers out of the ground floor so that they can escape, unaware that Beta is still alive at the bottom of the elevator shaft. In the episode \\"Scars\\", Aaron alerts Michonne of Daryl's presence at the Alexandria gates, including Connie, Henry and Lydia. Daryl vouches for Lydia to convince Michonne to let them take shelter. They stay long enough for Henry to get the medical care he needs, but Michonne refuses to provide them an escort to the Kingdom. That evening, Daryl, Connie, Henry and Lydia take off to return to the Kingdom, with Michonne seeing them off. In the episode \\"The Calm Before\\", as the fair at the Kingdom begins, Daryl and Michonne arrive with Judith, Henry, Lydia, and Connie, reuniting with Carol and Ezekiel. Michonne brings all the leaders from the communities to apologize for Alexandria forgoing its relationships, that Alexandria will give asylum to Lydia, and to establish a mutual protection pact knowing that Alpha will likely retaliate. As the fair continues, Alpha has snuck into the fair, posing as one of the Alexandria fairgoers from the caravan and gathers intel. That night, as most of the fairgoers gather for the film, Lydia is saving a seat for Henry when Alpha quietly sits next to her and gestures for her to stay quiet. Outside the theater, Alpha tries to convince Lydia to come with her, but Lydia rejects her. Alpha tells her she is not strong and no longer part of her group, and departs. Daryl's group finds a line of ten decapitated heads on pikes, one of which is Henry, meant to signify Alpha's territory boundary. Sometime later, Daryl and Lydia return to the border. Lydia leaves the necklace Henry made for her on the ground by the pike that once held Henry's head. As the two walk away, snow flurries begin to fall. In the season finale \\"The Storm\\", Ezekiel makes the decision to abandon the Kingdom, assembling a large caravan of the remaining survivors to seek out better shelter at the Hilltop; Daryl, Michonne, and Yumiko help to escort them. Lydia wanders into the forest and finds a walker half-buried in the snow. She takes off her glove while crying and offers her hand to the walker to commit suicide, but stops when Carol appears and follows her back to the group. Using the cover of the storm, the Kingdom's group passes the pikes into Alpha's territory, finding only frozen walkers along the way, and arrive at a river that has been frozen over. Carol goes looking for Lydia, who has disappeared, while the rest deal with rising walkers buried in the snow. She eventually catches up to Lydia, who realizes she's to blame for their situation and feels she can't stay with them. Since she can't go back to her mother, Lydia asks Carol to kill her, but Carol refuses Lydia's request and tells her that she is not weak. The group eventually make it to the waypoint and soon reach the Hilltop the next day. Daryl, Michonne, Carol, Lydia, and a few others prepare to depart and continue on to Alexandria. Development and reception Lydia is portrayed by Cassady McClincy on The Walking Dead television series, beginning with the ninth season. She makes her first appearance in the episode \\"Adaptation\\".https://ew.com/tv/2019/02/10/walking-dead-lydia-cassady-mcclincy- adaptation-909-midseason-premiere/ Matt Fowler of IGN reviewed the episode \\"Chokepoint\\" and commented that \\"with regards to how much we expect Henry to screw up because he loves Lydia, he at least is only dumb in a way that hurts himself - not others. His reluctance to kill Lydia's \\"family members\\" get him shanked in the leg.\\" Fowler added that \\"Henry and Lydia got all kissy this week. Blerf. Have your teen romance, nightmare kids.\\" Erik Kain of Forbes also reviewed the episode and commented on important parts of the story that have been hurried or glossed over, and that \\"Henry and Lydia's relationship, for instance, seems to have popped out of nowhere and blossomed much too quickly, with Henry falling head over heels for Lydia much too quickly. That's already gotten him in plenty of trouble, and it would have been more believable if their relationship had more time to grow and develop before Alpha came and took Lydia back.\\" Kain ended his review by saying that \\"I'm hoping they can start writing Henry better---his naivete is just ridiculous when you consider they've written the far younger Judith as little miss badass---but I have hope. And I like Lydia.\\" Erik Kain from Forbes, in his review of the episode \\"Scars\\", explained that if he could have done the second half of the season differently, he would have started with this episode, and then \\"The next few episodes, build up the mystery of the Whisperers and Alpha instead. Don't rush the Lydia/Henry thing, and let their relationship grow more organically. Have the Alpha/Lydia revelations come after a while rather than so fast.\\" Erik Kain of Forbes, in his review of \\"The Calm Before\\", commented on multiple characters including Tara, Enid, and Henry being \\"brutally murdered by Alpha and the Whisperers in retaliation for taking Lydia\\" by saying: \\"Henry was perhaps the biggest surprise of these three, having been built up as New Carl all season. I figured he'd be around for quite a lot longer. I was wrong. It makes sense, of course, for Alpha to kill her daughter's fling. One final act of vengeance and horribleness just to cement their break. I should have known better, of course.\\" Writing for Den of Geek!, Ron Hogan in his review of \\"The Calm Before\\" identified Henry and Lydia having a kiss as one of the episode's \\"sweet character moments\\", and said: \\"The Walking Dead rarely deals in taut emotions, preferring to manipulate with big pushes and pokes. The Calm Before has that in spades, but the creative team is able to dial it back, sprinkling moments of hopefulness in front of Alpha. Unlike Lydia, who was taken in by it, she's repulsed, and while it doesn't show on her face, it shows in her actions, and her talk with Daryl at shotgun-point. The very same incidents strike two related people totally differently, and in the denouement of the episode, the very things that lend sweetness and happiness end up causing the greatest in bittersweet pain.\\" Alex McLevy writing for The A.V. Club noted Lydia getting to go to the movies as one of the shots that \\"provided the right kind of simultaneous palate cleanser for what came before and preparation for the ending.\\" Aaron Neuwirth of We Live Entertainment reviewed the episode \\"The Storm\\", and after commenting on Ezekiel and Carol's relationship, he stated: \\"Lydia is not doing any better. She lost the boy who had a major crush on her, but beyond that, she is feeling real survivor‚Äôs guilt. I can‚Äôt blame her. It doesn‚Äôt hurt that Cassady McClincy has done a lot with a character who could have come off as the worst throughout these past few episodes that have heavily relied on her. With that in mind, I can understand her thoughts of putting herself out of her misery by letting her arm get bit by a frozen walker. Even as she begged Carol to kill her, it‚Äôs easy to see a version of this series that would let that happen. By the end of this episode, she‚Äôs a part of a happy snowball fight taking place. As this show tends to like having a teenager around for a different perspective, I can only wonder what type of role she‚Äôll have in the seasons going forward.\\" Alex McLevy of The A.V. Club, likewise commenting on Lydia after discussing Carol and Ezekiel, said: \\"Lydia, by contrast, is dealing with some serious survivor‚Äôs guilt, her feelings for Henry causing her to assume that she should‚Äôve died in his place, which leads her to do things like offer her exposed arm to a walker frozen in the ice, inches from its mouth. By the time she tries to run off, begging Carol to kill her (‚Äúno one has to know‚Äù) and spare her from the misery she's going through, it's clear the former Whisperer desperately needs some human connection to get her through this. It's sure not coming from Alden, who throws some blame her way before Daryl tells him to cut the shit.\\" McLevy also commented on the actress herself: \\"Alpha‚Äôs daughter has been a surprisingly strong presence during these last few episodes, and it has everything to do with Cassady McClincy‚Äôs performance. She has consistently located the raw-wound heart of the character, making even those groan-inducing moments of teenage romance between Henry and herself maintain a degree of appeal that would otherwise curdle into cloying nonsense.\\" References American female characters in television Comics characters introduced in 2014 Fictional victims of child abuse Teenage characters in comics Teenage characters in television The Walking Dead characters ","title":"Lydia (The Walking Dead)"},{"id":"58323037","text":"Perrhaebian Tripolis.

The brand has built a reputation among audio purists for their forward thinking effects and their high functionality. For this reason, musicians and producers have frequently applied Chase Bliss Audio effects not only to guitars but other electric instruments as well as audio from microphones. History Chase Bliss Audio was founded in 2013 by Joel Korte Anoka, Minnesota. The company is named after the founder's brother, Chase Korte, who died in 2007 after his car was struck by a drunk driver; and a favourite quote of Chase's, \\"Follow Your Bliss\\" by Joseph Campbell. Pedals Chase Bliss released the Warped Vinyl, its first pedal at the end of 2013. The company's pedals contain multiple circuit boards and are manufactured in Minnesota and California. Premiere Guitar wrote of the pedals that they, ‚Äúare notable for their kitchen-sink approach‚Äîanalog guts, digital brains, multiple knobs and toggles, and a bevy of DIP switches‚Äîwith no parameter left untweakable.‚Äù Each has an analog signal path, controlled by digital microprocessors. Bands that have used his pedals include Nine Inch Nails, A-ha, Soul Asylum, and Radiohead. In addition to the Warped Vinyl pedal and its predecessors, several other pedals have been produced by the company. In 2014 they released the Wombtone phaser pedal, in 2015 they released the Gravitas and the Spectre flanger pedal. In 2016 the company then released the Tonal Recall delay pedal. In 2017 the company released the Brothers pedal. Additionally, in 2018 they released the Thermae delay and harmonization pedal, and the Condor analog EQ pedal. = Stompboxes = Chase Bliss Audio Tonal Recall Most Chase Bliss Audio units are in the familiar stompbox format, playing off of the tradition of effect pedals being in a rectangular chassis designed to be toggled by the musician's feet. Similar to guitar pedal giant BOSS, Chase Bliss Audio tends to fit their different units into the same chassis, providing a format that is unique to their brand. This format consists of 6 knobs, 4 toggle switches, two foot- switchable buttons, an input, an output, CV/ expression pedal input, and MIDI input. Another feature unique to Chase Bliss are the DIP switches at the top of the stompbox. These are used to change, automate, or reverse the values of knobs. = Automatone Series = In January 2019, at the 2019 NAMM Show, Chase Bliss Audio revealed their plans on releasing the first of a new line of pedal format that they called the automatone.

In both universes, Magna is the feisty leader of a small group of roaming survivors and, as in the comic books, she is an LGBT character like Yumiko. Appearances =Comic book series= Magna is the leader of the survivors from Richmond who joins the Alexandria Safe-Zone two years after the fall of Negan and the Saviors. At the beginning of the apocalypse, Magna is one of many survivors who arrive at a nursing home near Washington D.C. As they moved through the east side of Washington, a massive herd of walkers that was being routed by Jesus and other residents of Alexandria took Magna's group by surprise, causing them to lose their trailer and other belongings, as well as one of its members. After being rescued and taken to Alexandria, Magna and her group were interviewed by Rick and Andrea in order to allow them to stay, and although at first they felt comfortable with the community they soon began to distrust the idyllic life they led. When Rick is absent in Alexandria, Magna and her group discover a prison. They find Negan, who tells them that Rick and his people are animals that torture him and begs them to release him, but she refused as she knew that Negan was lying. During the war against the Whisperers, Magna was a very important member of the militia, helping them win the war against the Whisperers and, after the death of Rick, Magna and her girlfriend Yumiko live together in the Commonwealth. =Television series= Season 9 Magna appears for the first time in \\"What Comes After\\" while escaping from a herd of walkers. Magna, like the rest of her group, defended themselves from the walkers while trying to escape, although they ended up being surrounded by them and subsequently rescued by an unknown person. Making their way through the wood, Magna and her group went into the forest and discovered a little girl who had rescued them; she later introduced herself as Judith Grimes. In \\"Who Are You Now?\\", after meeting the rest of Judith's group and being taken to her community, the arrival of Magna and her group was not well received by Michonne, who reminded Aaron that he did not have the right to allow other groups to enter Alexandria, but eventually he reluctantly agreed that the fate of the newcomers in the community would be decided by the council. Inside father Gabriel's church, Magna and his group were questioned about their profession before the outbreak began and the things they did to survive; and despite making good impressions to the council members, the story told by Magna questioned the trust of Michonne, who showed that the woman had spent a long time in prison for the tattoos she had on her hand and if it weren't enough, she forced her to deliver the knife she had hidden in her belt. Magna's suspicions of the community forced the council to allow them to spend the night in Alexandria and leave the next day. Her suspicious attitude was greatly criticized by the members of her group, who also forced her to hand over the other knife she had in store and strongly opposed her plan to steal Alexandria's supplies before leaving. Without giving up on her plan, Magna decided to break into Michonne's house to attack her while she was off guard but after seeing how she hugged her son, she stopped at the last moment and as an act of good faith she handed her the other knife that she had kept, confessing that she would have taken the same precautions that Michonne took with her group if she were the community leader. Magna's words eventually convinced Michonne not to send them back in the open, and decided to escort them to another community they knew. In \\"Stradivarius\\", on their way to the Hilltop, Magna protested Michonne's decision not to hand over their weapons after having repeatedly shown her that they were no danger to anyone, but her claims were ignored by her group. After arriving at the site where they were attacked by the herd of walkers while traveling and being informed by Michonne that they would also seize the weapons they found, Magna confronted her for her decision, although she ended up reluctantly accepting and she set off to find a safe place for the night. The next day, after realizing that several walkers were approaching their location, Magna demanded that Michonne give them their weapons to be able to defend themselves from the walkers, and while they made their way to the cart connected to the horses to escape the undead, Magna came face to face with the zombified Bernie and unable to end the misery of her friend, Michonne decided to put him out of mercy. Back on the road, Magna was completely shattered after witnessing her friend turned into a walker, and was comforted by Michonne, who confessed that she understood the pain of losing someone she considered part of the family. In \\"Evolution\\", after arriving to the Hilltop and reluctantly surrendering their weapons to enter, the fate of Magna and her group within the walls was put on hold by Tara, who informed the new arrivals that they could stay in the community while waiting for Jesus' arrival to make a final decision regarding if they could stay in the community. Despite the hospitality of her new home, Magna maintained her suspicions regarding the leader of the community, but accepted her partner's proposal to work hard on what the community would need to gain her place. With the news that Eugene had been hidden from a herd of walkers by Rosita, Magna along with Yumiko decided to go to search for the man and arrived just in time to help Michonne to rescue Jesus, Aaron and Eugene from walkers in an abandoned cemetery. When Jesus confronted the rest of the remaining walkers and prepared to return to the group to escape the walkers, Magna and the others watched in horror as he was stabbed in the heart by a walker and without time to lose she helped to retaliate against the armed walkers that were attacking them. After discovering that they were people disguised with walker skin, Magna and her group ended up being surrounded by group of \\"walkers\\", who whispers that they were going to die. In \\"Adaptation\\", Magna along with her group defended themselves from the group that was attacking them and before leaving, she helped take Jesus' body with them. As they set off to return to the Hilltop, Magna comforted Aaron over the loss, ensuring that he looked like a good person, and later they spotted a small herd of walkers on the bridge where some members of the group that had attacked them in the cemetery. After they killed most of the \\"walkers\\", the group was forced to take with them the only survivor of the skirmish in order to interrogate her about her group. After arriving to the Hilltop carrying the bad news of what happened in their mission, Magna helped lower the body of Jesus from one of the horses that transported him to be buried. Later, after being informed that Luke and Alden had gone out to look for them, Magna decided to accompany Enid in one of the guard posts waiting for the arrival of both of them and assured her that her boyfriend is in good hands. In \\"Omega\\", after discovering in the wood the horses that belonged to Luke and Alden who were missing, Magna, like the rest of her team, did not lose hope and decided to keep looking, but they were interrupted by Tara, who decided that it will be better to return to the Hilltop for their own safety. Later, when Yumiko proposed to look for Luke on her own despite Tara's orders, Magna was reluctant to think that they could lose the life they had within the community, but nevertheless ended up accepting their demands and subsequently, they left the place in the middle of the night. The large number of walkers forced Magna and her group reluctantly to leave the search behind and return to the Hilltop, only to witness the arrival of Alpha and her group at the gates of the community who demanded that they have to give her her daughter. In \\"Bounty\\", from the walls, Magna along with other residents of the community were deciding if they should take the fair offer by Alpha that involved two prisoners who had previously been captured by her group in exchange for her daughter who was in captivity within the community. Fortunately, when the exchange was successful, Magna along with her group received Luke at the entrance and subsequently decided to celebrate their reunion by drinking during the night. In \\"Chokepoint\\", Magna was part of a team who escorted the residents of the community to the fair and after noticing Kelly's concern about her sister's whereabouts, she assured her that she will be alright in the company of Daryl. When a small herd of walkers approached the survivors, Magna defended herself from the undead with the use of her bow until she was aided by a group of people called as the Highwaymen, who revealed themselves to be allies of the Kingdom and escorted the delegation directly to the fair. Once arrived at the community, Magna was in charge of lowering of the vehicle carrying the supplies that they had to offer as an exchange at the fair. In \\"The Calm Before\\", while enjoying the fair, Magna and her group watched the arrival of Daryl and his group to the community. Fearing that the Whisperers will retaliate against the Hilltop for having taken Lydia from them, Magna offered to travel to her home to defend the community from any attack and during the road she ran into one of the carts belonging to Hilltop completely destroyed after an unfortunate encounter with the Whisperers. With Yumiko's decision to accompany Daryl and others to find the missing people, Magna chose to follow the initial plan and said goodbye to her girlfriend. After being informed about the tragic fate of some people at the hands of Alpha, Magna was among the people who were listening to Siddiq's story about the courage the victims. In \\"The Storm\\", a few months after the massacre at the fair that marked the Whisperers' territory, a strong blizzard alerted the inhabitants of the Kingdom to leave their community due to the condition of the Kingdom was unable to live. With the help from Alexandria and the Hilltop, they escorted the Kingdommers safely to the Hilltop. Along the way, when the storm began to affect the survivors more, Magna and her group were forced to spend the night inside the abandoned Sanctuary and heard Michonne's plan to cross the frozen lake that belonged to Alpha's territory. Despite of the fear to cross the border, the group succeeded in carrying out the plan successfully and arrived safely to the Hilltop. Season 10 In \\"Lines We Cross\\", Magna became a member of the militia that would face the Whisperers. But after the harsh winter, the Whisperers had mysteriously disappeared from the area. She attended the training carried out on the coast in case they would face them in the future. When a walker mask was found, Magna accompanied Michonne and others to investigate the surroundings in search of any sign that Alpha and the Whisperers had returned and eventually their fears came true when they found a walker's skin a few meters from a camp that was totally destroyed. When a satellite crashed to the Whisperers' territory causing a forest fire, Magna and her group had no choice but to cross the border that divided them from the Whisperers. In \\"Silence the Whisperers\\", after being alerted to the mysterious fall of a tree against the walls of the Hilltop, Magna helped transport the injured from the fallen tree to the rooms of the mansion due to the lack of capacity of the infirmary. When the noise caught the attention of several herds of walkers, Magna and few residents of community were repelling the walkers and reluctantly was forced by Yumiko to fall back after the situation became critical; the Hilltop eventually received the help of Michonne and her group and together they stopped the invasion. Angry at the new role of her girlfriend occupied within the community, Magna confronted her about the fact that she was making decisions for others and reminded her that she is no longer her lawyer. In \\"What It Always Is\\", assuming that more attacks could come to the Hilltop, Magna along with Kelly decided to steal the supplies that the community had and hide them in a remote area of the forest in order to have reservations for her group in case the community will fall. When Kelly did not return to the Hilltop with the hunting team, Magna joined Daryl and Connie in search of her and after finding her lying under the tree, she was forced by Kelly to confess the place where they had hidden the supplies that they had stolen of Hilltop's pantry and thus confirm their guilt. Her actions were greatly criticized by Daryl and Connie, who instead of condemning them decided to hide the truth by changing it to a version that would protect their stay inside the walls and after returning to the Hilltop, Magna was confronted by Yumiko for what she had done. During the conversation, she confessed to her girlfriend that she was guilty of the crime she thought was innocent and left the room to avoid more tension between them. In \\"The World Before\\", when Gamma revealed the location of the herd of walkers that Alpha had, Magna was part of a small team that will destroy the herd but ended up being greatly disappointed to find the place completely empty. Assuming an act of treason by their informant, Magna and the rest of her team decided to change the plans and undertake the search for Lydia after having disappeared without any trace; but she was forced to chase after Carol after she glimpsed Alpha in the distance. The group ended up falling into her trap and were trapped inside a dark cave full of walkers. Development and reception Nadia Hilker portrays Magna Magna is portrayed by Nadia Hilker. The character entered the recurring cast beginning with the episode \\"What Comes After\\" of the ninth season. However, Nadia Hilker was promoted to a series regular starting the tenth season. Alex McLevy writing for The A.V. Club in the episode \\"Silence the Whisperers\\" praised the development of Magna's character: \\"Magna remains the most memorable, simply because Nadia Hilker is a magnetic actor, but even she is stuck doing little but sniping at Yumiko for making decisions Magna doesn't agree with, as though that's a huge problem when it involves saving their asses.\\" During an interview with Jon Maus writing for Fanfest News Nadia Hilker revealed that it feels great to work for Robert Kirkman and said: \\"Um, I still haven't realized how big it is yet. But, when I do, it's great. I'm so grateful. It's a family. We're all having each other's backs, and it's super brutal to shoot. Like, shooting the show itself is brutal, but it's so much fun. It feels like summer camp, and everybody is too good to be true.\\" Ryan DeVault of Monsters and Critics praised the work of Nadia Hilker and wrote: \\"Nadia Hilker is best-known for her recurring character of Luna on The 100. She is a German-born actress who has also appeared in the films Allegiant and Collide.

In both universes, Connie is part of a small group of roaming survivors which is led by Magna, and is the first deaf character in the entire universe of The Walking Dead, the actress who plays her, Lauren Ridloff is deaf in real life. Appearances =Comic book series= Connie is part of a group of survivors from Richmond who joins the Alexandria Safe-Zone two years after the fall of Negan and the Saviors. At the beginning of the apocalypse, Connie is one of many survivors who arrive at a nursing home near Washington D.C. As they moved through the east side of Washington, a massive herd of walkers that was being routed by Jesus and other residents of Alexandria took Magna's group by surprise, causing them to lose their trailer and other belongings, as well as one of its members. After being rescued and taken to Alexandria, Connie and her group were interviewed by Rick and Andrea in order to allow them to stay, and although at first they felt comfortable with the community they soon began to distrust the idyllic life they led. When Rick is absent in Alexandria, Connie and the group discover a prison. They find Negan, who tells them that Rick and his people are animals that torture him and begs them to release him, but Magna refused as she knew that Negan was lying. During the war against the Whisperers, like Magna, Connie was a very important member of the militia, helping them win the war against the Whisperers. =Television series= Season 9 Connie appears for the first time in the episode \\"What Comes After\\" while escaping from a herd of walkers. Connie, like the rest of her group, defended themselves from the walkers while trying to escape, although they ended up being surrounded by them and subsequently rescued by an unknown person. Making their way through the wood, Connie and her group went into the forest and discovered a little girl who had rescued them; she later introduced herself as Judith Grimes. In the episode \\"Who Are You Now?\\", after meeting the rest of Judith's group and being taken to her community, the arrival of Connie and her group was not well received by Michonne, who reminded Aaron that he did not have the right to allow other groups to enter Alexandria, but eventually she reluctantly agreed that the fate of newcomers in the community would be decided by the council. Inside Father Gabriel's church, Connie and her group were questioned with questions about their profession before the outbreak began and the things they did to survive; and despite making good impressions to the council members with their responses, the story told by Magna questioned Michonne, who showed that the woman had spent a long time in prison for the tattoos she had on her hand and if was not enough, she forced her to deliver the knife she had hidden in her belt. The council then decided that newcomers will be allowed to stay in the community for one night in order to rest and leave the next day; and while they settled in their temporary home, Connie criticized Magna's way of thinking about her guests and strongly opposed her plan to take all the supplies of the community before leaving. The next day, as they prepared to return to the weather, Connie thanked Judith between signs for everything she had done for her group, and before she could leave the community, Michonne arrived just in time to inform Connie and her group that would undertake the trip to another safe place where they would be allowed to live. In the episode \\"Stradivarius\\", as they made their way to the Hilltop, Connie and the rest of her group made a stop at the place where they were attacked by the herd of walkers and took advantage of the moment to collect all their stuff that they had left behind when they escaped from the herd - among them Bernie's belongings - with which Yumiko tried to convince Magna to take them as a souvenir to her late friend. When Michonne declared that all the weapons they found from Magna's group would be taken by their group, causing Magna to become hostile as she is against the woman's decision, Yumiko became the voice of reason in the middle of the discussion and proposed to her entire group to accept Michonne's terms instead of starting a fight. After spending the night in an abandoned factory and suddenly being ambushed by a pack of walkers, Connie claimed her weapons to defend herself and with the use of her bow, she ended up with several walkers that crossed her path; making their way to the horses to escape the undead and finding the zombified Bernie among them. Back on the highway, Connie along with Yumiko try to comfort Magna after witnessing their friend turned into a walker, and also were comforted by Michonne, who confessed that she understood the pain of losing someone she considered part of the family. In the episode \\"Evolution\\", after arriving at the Hilltop and reluctantly surrendering their weapons to enter, the fate of Connie and her group within the walls was put on hold by Tara, who informed the newcomers that they could settle in their facilities while they waited for the Jesus' arrival to make a final decision regarding if they could stay in the community. While discussing the strange nickname of the community's leader, Connie and her group met Carol, who personally introduced herself to her with sign language. In the episode \\"Omega\\", after discovering in the wood the horses that belonged to Luke and Alden who were missing, Connie and her friends were surprised by several walkers who emerged from the woods and without further choice were forced to return to Hilltop for their safety, except for Kelly, who in tears opposed the idea and remembering the time Luke rescued them in Coalport and was later comforted by his sister, who ordered Magna and Yumiko to move forward without them while helping Kelly to recover. Once arrived to the community, Connie separated from her sister when she was captured and escorted by the guards, Connie saw the arrival of Alpha and her group at the gates of the community who demanded that they have to give her her daughter. She then decided to hide herself in the cornfield as she didn't make it in time to get inside the Hilltop. In the episode \\"Bounty\\", hidden in the cornfield, Connie watches as Alpha signals for more Whisperers to show up and nearly gets spotted by a Whisperer until they walk away. Later, Connie watches as a herd arrives and Alpha instructs her people to draw them away. Luke spots Connie in the cornfields and signs behind his back for her to keep quiet. Suddenly, a Whisperer's baby starts crying, which attracts the walkers over. Alpha shrugs at the mother, indicating she should leave the baby to die. Alden and Luke scream for them not to but Alpha explains it's natural selection. Luke frantically signs Connie to grab the baby. Connie runs out of the cornfield, sling-shots a walker, and grabs it. The Whisperers around her unsheathe blades as Connie escapes back into the cornfield. Daryl runs in and kills the walkers around her while Kelly, Tammy, and Earl step in to rescue her. She is then escorted inside Hilltop. At night, Connie watches in thought as her companions drink and celebrate Luke's safety. A while later, she goes outside and sits by a table to write something. Suddenly, she notices Daryl getting ready to leave and stops him. He explains he is going in search of Henry and she writes him a note, claiming that she wants to tag along. Daryl reluctantly agrees and they set off. In the episode \\"Guardians\\", in the woods, Connie and Daryl look for Henry and realize that the Whisperers caught up with him. They kill some walkers and Daryl orders his dog to bring him the bolt back, but he refuses. Connie smiles as Daryl calls him a bad dog. Later, she and Daryl watch from some bushes as some Whisperers draw a herd to devour some corpses. At night, Connie and Daryl, dressed as Whisperers, lure the herd into the Whisperers' camp. In the middle of the chaos, Connie and Daryl grab Henry, who grabs Lydia, and together they escape. In the episode \\"Chokepoint\\", back in the woods, following their daring escape from the Whisperers, Daryl blames Lydia for getting them into this mess and says she can't go with them back to Hilltop. Connie and Henry refuse to leave her behind and run off with her in another direction. Daryl reluctantly follows them. At dawn, Connie and Daryl devise a plan to use an office building as a means of separating the Whisperers from the undead. Lydia warns Daryl that Alpha's going to send Beta, who's their best fighter. \\"We'll kill him first\\", Daryl promises. Inside the office building, Connie reveals to Daryl that her group used the building to hide supplies and they argue about how they should proceed afterwards, with Connie saying Lydia should come back with them because they have more to lose than her. Later, Lydia spots a group of walkers/whisperers emerge from the bushes. In the middle of the group is Beta, who quietly instructs his people to spread out as Daryl shoots one of them with his crossbow. Beta and his people break in and quickly discover a trap meant to separate them from the dead. Meanwhile, Daryl makes Lydia hide in a closet as the Whisperers creep upstairs. Henry knocks one of them out as Connie slingshots another, before going to hunt down the others. Suddenly, a Whisperer stabs Henry in the leg, but is then tackled by Daryl's dog. Connie finishes it off as Lydia breaks out and goes to help Henry. Afterward, Connie draws the herd away with her slingshot and Daryl tells the others they're headed to Alexandria to get Henry help because it's closer. However, he doesn't intend to stay and they will instead keep moving on. In the episode \\"Scars\\", Connie arrives at Alexandria with Daryl, Henry, and Lydia. From a guardpost, Michonne tells Daryl she's skeptical of Lydia but he assures her she's on their side. Inside, Connie tells Michonne that she's thankful to her for everything. At night, Connie, Daryl, Henry, and Lydia leave for the Kingdom. The next day, Connie, Daryl, Henry, and Lydia encounter Michonne and Judith in the woods and join them on their way towards the Kingdom. In the episode \\"The Calm Before\\", Connie and the group arrive at the Kingdom as the fair starts. She runs to her sister and hugs her, before embracing her whole group. Later, Connie says goodbye to Yumiko and Magna as they prepare to leave the Kingdom to go to Hilltop and leave some soldiers in case of a possible attack. She also says goodbye to Daryl and promises him to watch after his dog until he returns. In the fair, Connie apologizes to Kelly for leaving in a rush and confess she saved the baby because she still hasn't moved on from a past trauma. Later, Connie and Kelly try to help Earl look for Tammy around the fair. The next day, in the Kingdom, Connie is in the crowd as Siddiq delivers the tragic news, tells them how brave everyone was in their final moments and how he was intentionally kept alive to tell this very story. He encourages everyone to remember the fallen. Season 10 In the season premiere \\"Lines We Cross\\", some months after the blizzard, Connie and the Coalition form a militia in order to train the several residents of the communities to face any future threats. She takes part in a training exercise on Oceanside beach. As Ezekiel and Jerry methodically release walkers from a shipwrecked boat, Connie and the other militia work together as a unit to take out the walker threat. Later on, Connie helps the Oceanside residents pull some fishing nets from the sea. Kelly tells Connie she's worried her gradual hearing loss will prevent her from translating for her. Connie assures her that she'll be okay and they should see their deafness as a superpower. Suddenly, Dog runs over with Daryl following behind. Kelly gives Connie a look suggesting she and Daryl are into each other, but Connie just rolls her eyes. Connie then walks to the dock to deliver Dog to Daryl with a note saying, \\"Think you lost something.\\" He communicates with her in ASL. Connie is impressed and tells him that he signs with a southern accent. When Carol arrives on a boat, Connie greets her with a hug. That night, Connie and the others decide to cross Alpha's border to put out the fire and avoid it burning down Oceanside. They discover the remains of the satellite and start combating the fire. Some use water while others dig a means to prevent the fire from spreading until the morning arrives. The group runs out of water as a herd of walkers approaches the group. With their backs to the fire, the group prepares for a fight. Connie and the group take their formations and start fighting off the herd. As they keep killing the walkers, Daryl tosses an axe to cut a tree down and have it fall onto some walkers. Later, the fire is put out and everyone recovers. She then helps out Eugene scrap the fallen satellite for any valuable part. In the episode \\"Silence the Whisperers\\", Connie is alerted to the commotion of a tree falling onto a house and a portion of Hilltop's walls. Luke wonders if the Whisperers are responsible, and Connie is left thinking about that. She then helps the other residents rescue the trapped injured from the rubble. The next day, the residents realize that a small herd has arrived outside the community walls. Connie and a group head outside to fight them off. That night, Connie and the other residents kill the incoming walkers with the help of the Alexandria convoy when the herd invades the community. The following morning, Connie hugs Luke goodbye advising him to be safe as he rides with the parting group towards Oceanside and watches as they leave the community. In the episode \\"What It Always Is\\", Connie helps serve food to the residents as she notices Daryl and Siddiq arriving at the Hilltop. When the hunting group returns back, Connie expresses concern about Kelly's whereabouts. Oscar informs that she volunteered to stay back and she would return later. Connie looks concerned as Daryl listens nearby. Later that day, Connie and Daryl search for Kelly around the woods. As Connie grows worried for her sister, Daryl tells her a story about how he saved his brother Merle from drowning during a fishing trip but was chastised for not getting the beer off the lake. They laugh over the story and hold hands. Suddenly, Dog finds the remains of a boar. They hear a noise behind them and find Magna. Sometime later, the group manages to find an exhausted Kelly lying under a tree. As they give her water, Kelly insists to Magna they tell Daryl and Connie about the supplies they've been taking. Daryl is mad about them hiding the supplies and Connie suggests they lie and say they found it in the woods. When the group later arrives back at Hilltop, Connie informs Yumiko of the recent events. That night, Connie finds Daryl as he is preparing to head back to Alexandria and apologizes for involving him with Kelly and Magna's lie. He claims to understand because they are her family. She then says she considers him family too and smiles as he drives off, however, her smile quickly drops. In the episode \\"The World Before\\", Connie is part of the group from Hilltop to meet up with Daryl, Carol, and Aaron in the woods to go find the horde following Gamma's intel. When Daryl thanks her for helping, she smiles and pulls out a pre-written note saying \\"anything for us\\". That night, the group crosses one of the borders in the woods to continue their mission. The next day, the group arrives at the location of the horde in a clearing only to find it's empty, so they leave to go search for the missing Lydia. When Carol chases after Alpha into a dark building, Connie and the others follow her inside. The group then falls below a cave into a trap where they find themselves surrounded by most of the herd. In the episode \\"Squeeze,\\" Connie and Magna are trapped in the cave when a dynamite explosion collapses the exit.

Development and reception Lauren Ridloff portrays Connie Connie is portrayed by Lauren Ridloff. The character entered the recurring cast beginning with the episode \\"What Comes After\\" of the ninth season. However, Lauren Ridloff was promoted to a series regular starting the tenth season. Dalton Ross of Entertainment Weekly praised Connie's character and said: \\"Connie has been described as 'a seasoned survivor deft at using her senses to read people, situations, and trouble.' Her character is deaf and uses American Sign Language (ASL) to communicate.\\" Liam Mathews of TV Guide praised the development of Connie's character in the episode \\"Omega\\" and said: \\"Connie quickly proved her mettle during one of the season's best action sequences, rescuing an abandoned, crying baby from walkers and running into a zombie- infested cornfield. We experienced the scene from Connie's point of view, which added a thrilling dimension to the sequence, since we couldn't hear the zombies sneaking up on her. It was something that couldn't be done with a hearing character and opened up new possibilities for types of Walking Dead action scenes, an impressive feat for a show nine seasons in.\\" The current showrunner of the series Angela Kang also expressed her praise on the scene that rescued the newborn from the Whisperers' herd and said: \\"We just wanted to feel how scary that is and how capable she is, and how much she cares, in the moment, for saving this baby, that she would risk herself when she could have just stepped back.\\" Writing for Fan Fest News, Casey Perriccio praised Ridloff and said: \\"Ridloff quickly became a fan favorite on The Walking Dead when she joined the series in season 9. As the spunky, kind-hearted and brave Connie, Ridloff's performance has brought a softness to the show. She's the first deaf character audiences have been introduced to in The Walking Dead universe and has taken that role on with stride. Other projects for Ridloff include guest spots in series such as Legacies and New Amsterdam. She joins fellow Walking Dead star Danai Gurira in the MCU. Gurira first appeared in Black Panther and recently in Avengers: Endgame.\\" References The Walking Dead characters Comics characters introduced in 2014 Fictional African-American people Fictional deaf characters Female characters in comics Fictional murderers Fictional sole survivors Fictional women soldiers and warriors Fictional mute characters ","title":"Connie (The Walking Dead)"},{"id":"58323235","text":"Yumiko is a fictional character in the comic book series The Walking Dead and the television series of the same name, where she is portrayed by Eleanor Matsuura.

Although her injuries were healing and stabilized, Yumiko did not wake up from her deep sleep while being visited by the rest of her group and because she was the only one in the team not to be stripped of her weapons, Magna took her necklace with a sharp blade as a defense weapon against any threat that arises. Once she regained her consciousness the next morning with the news that they were leaving the community, Yumiko joked with her group stating that she could have hit her head harder to stay longer in the community. However, after a sudden change of mind, Michonne decided to escort Yumiko and the rest of her group to another community where they would be safe instead of sending them back in the open, and decided to escort them to another community they knew.

With the news that Eugene had been hidden from a herd of walkers by Rosita, Yumiko along with Magna decided to go to search for the man and arrived just in time to help Michonne to rescue Jesus, Aaron and Eugene from walkers in an abandoned cemetery. When Jesus confronted the rest of the remaining walkers and prepared to return to the group to escape the walkers, Yumiko and the others watched in horror as he was stabbed in the heart by a walker and without time to lose she helped to retaliate against the armed walkers that were attacking them. After discovering that they were people disguised with walker skin, Magna and her group ended up being surrounded by group of \\"walkers\\", who whispers that they were going to die.

As they set off to return to the Hilltop, they spotted a small herd of walkers on the bridge where some members of the group that had attacked them in the cemetery. After they killed most of the \\"walkers\\", the group was forced to take with them the only survivor of the skirmish in order to interrogate her about her group. After arriving to the Hilltop carrying the bad news of what happened in their mission, Yumiko along with Magna helped lower the body of Jesus from one of the horses that transported him to be buried. In \\"Omega\\", after discovering in the wood the horses that belonged to Luke and Alden who were missing, Yumiko, like the rest of her team, did not lose hope and decided to keep looking, but they were interrupted by Tara, who decided that it will be better to return to the Hilltop for their own safety. Later, when Yumiko proposed to look for Luke on her own despite Tara's orders, Magna was reluctant to think that they could lose the life they had within the community, but nevertheless ended up accepting their demands and subsequently, they left the place in the middle of the night. The large number of walkers forced Yumiko and her group reluctantly to leave the search behind and return to the Hilltop, only to witness the arrival of Alpha and her group at the gates of the community who demanded that they have to give her her daughter. In \\"Bounty\\", from the walls, Yumiko along with other residents of the community were deciding if they should take the fair offer by Alpha that involved two prisoners who had previously been captured by her group in exchange for her daughter who was in captivity within the community. Fortunately, when the exchange was successful, Yumiko along with her group received Luke at the entrance and subsequently decided to celebrate their reunion by drinking during the night. In \\"Chokepoint\\", Yumiko was part of a team who escorted the residents of the community to the fair and after noticing Kelly's concern about her sister's whereabouts, she assured her that she will be alright in the company of Daryl. When a small herd of walkers approached the survivors, Yumiko defended herself from the undead with the use of her bow until she was aided by a group of people called as the Highwaymen, who revealed themselves to be allies of the Kingdom and escorted the delegation directly to the fair. Once arrived at the community, Magna was in charge of lowering of the vehicle carrying the supplies that they had to offer as an exchange at the fair. In \\"The Calm Before\\", while enjoying the fair, Yumiko and her group watched the arrival of Daryl and his group to the community. Fearing that the Whisperers will retaliate against the Hilltop for having taken Lydia from them, Magna offered to travel to her home to defend the community from any attack and during the road she ran into one of the carts belonging to Hilltop completely destroyed after an unfortunate encounter with the Whisperers. With Yumiko's decision to accompany Daryl and others to find the missing people, Magna chose to follow the initial plan and said goodbye to her girlfriend. At night, Yumiko and the group gets attacked by walkers. They take them out one by one until the Whisperers surround them. Beta emerges from the trees and tells them to drop their weapons. After the group is tied up, Alpha approaches them and tells them she ran into trouble on the road as she wipes her bloody knife on her pants. Michonne warns her if she tries to get Lydia back they'll respond in force, but Alpha assures her Lydia isn't her concern anymore. She takes out a shotgun and orders Daryl to follow her. At dawn, Daryl returns to the group and they leave back to the Kingdom. On their way back to the Kingdom, they find a beaten and bloody Siddiq tied to a tree. He points them to a nearby hill, which has ten pikes in the ground. Each spike has a severed head stabbed through the top. The group walk devastated towards it and look in horror at the victims: Ozzy, Alek, D.J., Frankie, Tammy, Rodney, Addy, Enid, Tara, and Henry. Yumiko is horrified and falls to her knees. They then put down their friends and loved ones and head back to the Kingdom. Later that day, Yumiko listens from the crowd as Siddiq delivers the tragic news, tells them how brave everyone was in their final moments and how he was intentionally kept alive to tell this very story. He encourages everyone to remember the fallen as brave heroes and to honor them. In \\"The Storm\\", a few months after the massacre at the fair that marked the Whisperers' territory, a strong blizzard alerted the inhabitants of the Kingdom to leave their community due to the condition of the Kingdom was unable to live. With the help from Alexandria and the Hilltop, they escorted the Kingdommers safely to the Hilltop. Along the way, when the storm began to affect the survivors more, Yumiko and her group were forced to spend the night inside the abandoned Sanctuary and heard Michonne's plan to cross the frozen lake that belonged to Alpha's territory. Despite of the fear to cross the border, the group succeeded in carrying out the plan successfully and arrived safely to the Hilltop. Season 10 In \\"Lines We Cross\\", Yumiko became a member of the militia that would face the Whisperers. But after the harsh winter, the Whisperers had mysteriously disappeared from the area. She attended the training carried out on the coast in case they would face them in the future. When a walker mask was found, Yumiko accompanied Michonne and others to investigate the surroundings in search of any sign that Alpha and the Whisperers had returned and eventually their fears came true when they found a walker's skin a few meters from a camp that was totally destroyed. When a satellite crashed to the Whisperers' territory causing a forest fire, Yumiko and her group had no choice but to cross the border that divided them from the Whisperers. In \\"Silence the Whisperers\\", after being alerted to the mysterious fall of a tree against the walls of the Hilltop, Yumiko helped transport the injured from the fallen tree to the rooms of the mansion due to the lack of capacity of the infirmary. When the noise caught the attention of several herds of walkers, Magna and few residents of community were repelling the walkers and reluctantly was forced by Yumiko to fall back after the situation became critical; the Hilltop eventually received the help of Michonne and her group and together they stopped the invasion. Angry at the new role of her girlfriend occupied within the community, Magna confronted her about the fact that she was making decisions for others and reminded her that she is no longer her lawyer. In \\"What It Always Is\\", Yumiko checks around the community to make sure everyone is helping with their chores. She is informed by Alden that Eugene has come up with a plan to salvage the fallen tree and use it to fix the wall. He also suggests to her that they should build up their defenses but she says is not the time as Earl complains about their lack of retaliation against the Whisperers. Suddenly, Brianna tells Yumiko that someone stole the crate of fish from Oceanside during the night. Upon finding out it happened during Magna's shift, Magna was confronted by Yumiko for what she had done. During the conversation, she confessed to her girlfriend that she was guilty of the crime she thought was innocent and left the room to avoid more tension between them. Development and reception Eleanor Matsuura portrays Yumiko Yumiko is portrayed by Eleanor Matsuura. The character entered the recurring cast beginning with the episode \\"What Comes After\\" of the ninth season. However, Eleanor Matsuura was promoted to a series regular starting the tenth season. During an interview with Cynthia Vinney writing for CBR Eleanor Matsuura revealed that it feels happy to work for Robert Kirkman and said: \\"Oh my gosh, it was crazy and a real honor to join such an established show, a huge family that's been just like slaying it for nine years. I mean the fact that we're on our tenth season now is just an incredible achievement. I feel so proud to be a part of it.\\" Ryan DeVault of Monsters and Critics praised the work of Eleanor Matsuura and wrote: \\"Matsuura's character of Yumiko is already making an important impact on The Walking Dead cast. Though she has only been in a handful of episodes, there is a lot of foreshadowing that suggests she will have an important part in the coming conflict with the Whisperers.\\" During an interview with Emily Hannemann writing for TV Insider Eleanor Matsuura revealed the interest of Yumiko's character development and said: \\"Yes, it was! I had a conversation with Angela at the beginning of the season where she told me about where she sees Yumiko going and what's going to unfold in the season. One of the things that was mentioned was that Hilltop is going through this huge change with the attacks happening and losing Tara last season, and Maggie is currently not around. I don't think it was ever pre-planned, that Yumiko's like, 'I'm going to be the leader!' It's just an opportunity that presented itself when we were under attack from the Whisperers. I have this line, 'When the s**t hits the fan, someone has to step up.' And I think when that happened, when the tree falls through and the walkers overwhelm us, Yumiko naturally steps into that role because she can and because she‚Äôs good at it. It was never something where Angela was like, 'Yumiko's going to become the next leader of Hilltop.' But it was definitely an opportunity to show that Yumiko's incredibly capable and she's so passionate about her new community that she will fight for it.\\" References Comics characters introduced in 2014 Female characters in comics Fictional archers Fictional feminist characters Fictional Japanese people Fictional lesbians Fictional LGBT characters in television Fictional murderers Fictional sole survivors Fictional women soldiers and warriors LGBT characters in comics The Walking Dead characters ","title":"Yumiko (The Walking Dead)"},{"id":"58323239","text":"George Frederick Stooke (March 1867 ‚Äì September 12, 1907) was an English physician and medical missionary who carried out his work with the Church of Scotland's Mission in Yichang, China, along the Yangtze river.

Rankine, called for two doctors to replace him; in a dying message to the church he stated that a lone physician would again die due to the quantity of the work. The Church needed another doctor to volunteer to offer their service at the Mission and George Stooke quickly stepped forward. In March 1900 he arrived in Yichang and quickly began to learn the language. He wrote a short entry for the East of Asia Magazine entitled, ‚ÄúA Trip in Summer through the Yangtze Gorges‚Äù where he describes his travels from Shanghai to Yichang and includes several images of the landscapes he encountered.  Missionary service  He married his wife Jessie Graham, also a doctor, in 1901. In the same year, he began his hospital and dispensary work alongside his wife. Stooke was assisted in the hospital by the first missionary nurse, Minnie Bere. The expertise of Stooke and his colleagues attracted people throughout the whole city and district and as a result the amount of work in the hospital was increasing. The hospital constantly had full wards and each day there were around 100 patients. It was also common for Stooke to respond to calls to serve officials and other people in their homes. Stooke also took medical care of the community. He often preached on Sunday evenings at the English church services; he also often played the organ. After six years of service at Ichang he went home on furlough. He returned in the summer of 1907, and spent some time with his parents in Yantai.  Legacy  Stooke died from Cholera at Yichang in 1907. The medical missionary body lost a brilliant member in China who had a large impact on the people there and on the workings of the hospital. He wrote about ‚ÄúI-Ch'ang Fever,‚Äù providing information from his research about its etiology, symptoms, and treatment, as well as specific case studies for the use of other medical professionals to use as the basis of future studies. He brought his knowledge to help develop the surgical department there. He was known for his thoroughness not only in his medical profession but preaching and organ playing.

The Dominicans were established there in 1234; their community was suppressed during the French occupation of Belgium in 1796. The State Archives in Bruges are now housed on part of the former site of the friary. History Joan, Countess of Flanders, granted the Dominicans a foundation in Bruges in 1234, and they quickly built a cloister and church. In the 1280s the Dominicans began work on a new, larger church, which was consecrated in 1311 and completed in 1320. Around 1330 a chapter house was added. A serious fire in 1459 completely destroyed the library and one of the three dormitories, which were rebuilt. Between 1578 and 1584, during the Dutch Revolt, the friary suffered extensive damage. The church was reconsecrated in 1584, but rebuilding works continued to the mid-17th century. A brewery was added to the complex in 1641. In 1751 the city of Bruges extended a canal through the city centre, expropriating land from the Dominican friary in order to do so. The church was closed in 1794, and in 1796 the friary was suppressed and its members disbanded. The church was demolished in 1801. Later uses The new State Archives building in Bruges now occupies part of the site. Between 1796 and 1998 part of the complex was used as a barracks for the Gendarmerie. Another part of the complex was in use as a hotel between 1905 and 1940. The latter was sequestered as a billet by the German forces of occupation during the Second World War. This part of the complex was used by the Belgian Red Cross from 1947 to 1992. Such remnants of the friary buildings as survive have been listed as protected built heritage since 1980.

Balderic appears in a 943 charter made in his favour by his paternal uncle Balderic, which was studied by Joseph Daris in 1896 and L√©on Vanderkindere in 1900, leading to the following conclusions: *His mother who is not named in the charter was a sister of Reginar III, Count of Hainaut. *His mother's father was also named Reginar, and Reginar II, we know from this document, was already dead in 943. *His father was Count Nevelung, who was also already dead in 943. *His father's brother, also named Balderic, was bishop of Utrecht from 918 to 975. He was able to grant the use of lands near Sint-Odili√´nberg to the support of Nevelung's family. *He had a younger brother named Rudolf, who was to receive benefit from the grant after his mother and elder brother died. Against royal wishes he was made a bishop whilst still a child in place of his predecessor Rathier (bishop from 953 to 955). According to Rathier's own published complaints, Balderic gained the position thanks to the support of his father's brother Bishop Balderic, and two other uncles, Count Reginar and Ruduolt, who is normally equated to Rudolf the brother of Reginar who was named by Flodoard as a rebel in 944.
