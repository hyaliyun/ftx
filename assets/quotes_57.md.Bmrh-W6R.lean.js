He was a member of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, the first jazz band to record commercially. Background Shields was born into an Irish-American family in Uptown New Orleans, on the same block where jazz pioneer Buddy Bolden lived. Shields' family were musical; his brothers Harry, Pat (guitar), and Eddie (piano) all played music professionally. Shields started playing clarinet when he was 14 and played with Papa Jack Laine's bands. He was one of the early New Orleans musicians to go to Chicago, first heading north in the summer of 1915 to join Bert Kelly's band, then with Tom Brown's band, before joining the Original Dixieland Jass Band (ODJB) in November 1916. The following year that band made the first jazz phonograph records, propelling Shield's playing to national prominence. Around this time, he also played occasionally with King Watzke's band. After leaving the ODJB in 1921, he played with various bands in New York City (including briefly with Paul Whiteman) before moving to Los Angeles, California where he remained throughout the 1920s, leading his own band and appearing briefly in some Hollywood films. In the 1930s, Shields returned to Chicago and joined the reformed ODJB. He then worked for a while at \\"Nick's\\" in New York before returning to play in New Orleans and, later, in California. He died in Los Angeles. Influence His playing, especially on phonograph records, was an important influence on later jazz clarinetists, including Benny Goodman. Larry Shields inspired Dink Johnson to begin playing the clarinet, in a 1950 interview with Floyd Levin he stated: \\"I was actually a drummer, you know. I had always wanted to play the clarinet since hearing Larry Shields with the Original Dixieland Jazz Band.\\" He co-wrote the ODJB classics \\"Clarinet Marmalade\\" with Henry Ragas and \\"At the Jazz Band Ball\\", \\"Ostrich Walk\\", and \\"Fidgety Feet\\" with Nick LaRocca. These compositions became jazz classics and standards that were re-recorded by later jazz bands. Honors In 2006, his 1917 recording of \\"Darktown Strutters' Ball\\" with the Original Dixieland Jass Band was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

The 1569 quarto edition shows Elizabeth accompanied by female personifications of Justice, Mercy, Fortitude, and Prudence. The Bishops' Bible is an English translation of the Bible which was produced under the authority of the established Church of England in 1568. It was substantially revised in 1572, and the 1602 edition was prescribed as the base text for the King James Bible that was completed in 1611. History The Bishop's Bible succeeded the Great Bible of 1539, the first authorized bible in English, and the Geneva Bible of 1557‚Äì1560. The thorough Calvinism of the Geneva Bible (more evident in the marginal notes than in the translation itself) offended the high-church party of the Church of England, to which almost all of its bishops subscribed. Though most mainstream English clergy agreed with much of Calvin's theology, the majority did not approve of his prescribed church polity, Presbyterianism, which sought to replace government of the church by bishops (Episcopalian) with government by lay elders. However, they were aware that the Great Bible of 1539 ‚Äî which was the only version then legally authorized for use in Anglican worship ‚Äî differed, in that much of the Old Testament and Apocrypha was translated from the Latin Vulgate, rather than from the original Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek. In an attempt to replace the objectionable Geneva translation, they circulated one of their own, which became known as the \\"Bishops' Bible\\". The promoter of the exercise, and the leading figure in translating was Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury. It was at his instigation that the various sections translated by Parker and his fellow bishops were followed by their initials in the early editions. For instance, at the end of the book of Deuteronomy, we find the initials \\"W.E.\\", which, according to a letter Parker wrote to Sir William Cecil, stand for William Alley, Bishop of Exeter. Parker tells Cecil that this system was \\"to make [the translators] more diligent, as answerable for their doings.\\" Unhappily, Parker failed to commission anyone to act as supervisory editor for the work completed by the various translators, and was too busy to do so himself, and accordingly translation practice varies greatly from book to book. Hence, in most of the Old Testament (as is standard in English Versions) the tetragrammaton YHWH is represented by \\"the LORD\\", and the Hebrew \\"Elohim\\" is represented by \\"God\\". But in the Psalms the practice is the opposite way around. The books that Parker himself worked on are fairly sparingly edited from the text of the Great Bible, while those undertaken by Grindal of London emerged much closer to the Geneva text. In this edition, Elizabeth is flanked by allegorical virtues of Faith and Charity. Elizabeth therefore represents Hope.Beneath the portrait is a Latin text from Romans 1:16 The bishops deputed to revise the Apocrypha appear to have delivered very little, as the text in these books reproduce that of the Great Bible broadly the same. As the Apocrypha of the Great Bible was translated from the Latin Vulgate, the Bishops' Bible cannot strictly claim to have been entirely translated from the original tongues. The Bishops' Bible was first published in 1568, but was then re-issued in an extensively revised form in 1572. In the revision a number of switches were made to the New Testament in the direction of more \\"ecclesiastical\\" language (e.g. introducing the term \\"charity\\" into I Corinthians 13), but otherwise to bring the text more into line with that found in the Geneva Bible; and in the Old Testament, the Psalms from the Great Bible were printed alongside those in the new translation, which had proved impossible to sing. The new psalm translation was printed only once more (in 1585) and otherwise dropped altogether; while further incremental changes were made to the text of the New Testament in subsequent editions. The Bible had the authority of the royal warrant, and was the second version appointed to be read aloud in church services (cf. Great Bible, King James Bible). It failed to displace the Geneva Bible as a domestic Bible to be read at home, but that was not its intended purpose. The intention was for it to be used in church as what would today be termed a \\"pulpit Bible\\". The version was more grandiloquent than the Geneva Bible. The first edition was exceptionally large and included 124 full-page illustrations. The second and subsequent editions were rather smaller, around the same size as the first printing of the King James Bible, and mostly lacked illustrations other than frontispieces and maps. The text lacked most of the notes and cross-references in the Geneva Bible, which contained much controversial theology, but which were helpful to people among whom the Bible was just beginning to circulate in the vernacular. The last edition of the complete Bible was issued in 1602, but the New Testament was reissued until at least 1617. William Fulke published several parallel editions up to 1633, with the New Testament of the Bishops' Bible alongside the Rheims New Testament, specifically to controvert the latter's polemical annotations. The Bishops' Bible or its New Testament went through over 50 editions, whereas the Geneva Bible was reprinted more than 150 times. Legacy The translators of the King James Bible were instructed to take the 1602 edition of the Bishops' Bible as their basis, although several other existing translations were taken into account. After it was published in 1611, the King James Bible soon took the Bishops' Bible's place as the de facto standard of the Church of England. Later judgments of the Bishops' Bible have not been favorable; David Daniell, in his important edition of William Tyndale's New Testament, states that the Bishops' Bible \\"was, and is, not loved. Where it reprints Geneva it is acceptable, but most of the original work is incompetent, both in its scholarship and its verbosity\\". Jack P. Lewis, in his book The Day after Domesday: The Making of the Bishops' Bible, notes that unsympathetic reviews of this Bible have been done. However, \\"Granting all the shortcomings eighteenth to twenty-first-century scholarship can find in the Bishops' Bible, it was an important stage in moving English people from prohibited Bible reading to being a Bible-reading people. The revisers labored to give God's book to God's people in a language they could understand. The King James translators did not think they were making a bad translation into a good one, but were making a good one better.\\" Unlike Tyndale's translations and the Geneva Bible, the Bishops' Bible has rarely been reprinted; however, facsimiles are available. The most available reprinting of its New Testament portion (minus its marginal notes) can be found in the fourth column of the New Testament Octapla edited by Luther Weigle, chairman of the translation committee that produced the Revised Standard Version. The Bishops' Bible is also known as the \\"Treacle Bible\\", because of its translation of Jeremiah 8:22 which reads \\"Is there not treacle at Gilead?\\", a rendering also found in several earlier versions as well such as the Great Bible.Great Bible, Jeremiah ch. 8 In the Authorized Version of 1611, \\"treacle\\" was changed to \\"balm\\".

Biography =Early life= Yamamoto was born in Kagoshima in Satsuma Province (now Kagoshima Prefecture) as the sixth son of samurai who served the Shimazu clan. As a youth, he took part in the Anglo-Satsuma War. He later joined Satsuma's Eighth Rifle Troop in the Boshin War that ended the Tokugawa shogunate, fighting at the Battle of Toba‚ÄìFushimi and other locations; he was also aboard one of the ships that pursued Enomoto Takeaki and the remnants of the Tokugawa fleet to Hokkaid≈ç in 1869. After the success of the Meiji Restoration, Yamamoto attended preparatory schools in Tokyo and entered the 2nd class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1870. At the time of the Satsuma Rebellion, he briefly returned to Kagoshima, but at the urging of Saigo Takamori, he returned to the Naval Academy before the start of combat. =Naval career= Yamamoto Gonnohyoe After graduation in 1874, Yamamoto went on a training cruise to Europe and South America aboard Imperial German Navy vessels from 1877 to 1878, and as junior officer acquired much sea experience. He wrote a gunnery manual that became the standard for the Imperial Japanese Navy and served as executive officer of the cruiser on its shakedown voyage from Elswick to Japan (1885 to 1886). After serving as captain of the corvette , he accompanied Navy Minister Kabayama Sukenori on a trip to the United States and Europe that lasted over a year (1887 to 1888). As commander of the cruiser , he undertook a confidential mission to meet Qing General Yuan Shikai in Hanseong (Seoul), Korea (1890). Afterwards, he assumed command of the . Working under his patron, Navy Minister Saig≈ç Tsugumichi from 1893, Yamamoto became the real leader of the navy; initiating numerous reforms, attempting to end favoritism toward officers of his own Satsuma province, attempting to end officers from profiteering from military office, and attempting to attain roughly equal status with the Army in the Supreme War Council. He also pushed for an aggressive strategy towards the Chinese Empire in the First Sino- Japanese War (1894‚Äì95).Yamamoto was promoted to rear admiral in 1895 and to vice admiral in 1898. =As Minister of the Navy= Minister of the Navy, Admiral Baron Yamamoto visiting the captured city of Dalny, just north of Port Arthur in December 1904. Accompanying the Minister were several Western observers, including Italian naval attach√© Ernesto Burzagli who photographed the inspection tour. In November 1898, Yamamoto was appointed Navy Minister under the second Yamagata Aritomo administration. By this time, the Russian Empire was already perceived as the greatest threat to Japan, and Yamamoto advised the government that it was possible that Japan would win a conflict against Russia, albeit at the cost of more than half of the Imperial Japanese Navy. He sponsored promising junior officers s a \\"brain trust\\", including Akiyama Saneyuki and Hirose Takeo, whom he sent as naval attach√©s to the United States, United Kingdom and Russia to gather intelligence and to make strategic assessments of capabilities. Domestically, he pushed for increased capacity and modernisation of shipyards and steel mills, and for the increase import of higher quality coal from the United Kingdom to power his warships. Externally, he was a strong supporter of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. As an indication of the increased independence and prestige of the Navy, Emperor Meiji appeared in naval uniform during a public appearance for the first time. Yamamoto was made baron (danshaku) under the kazoku peerage system in 1902; and he was promoted to the rank of admiral in 1904. As Minister of the Navy during the Russo-Japanese War, Yamamoto showed strong leadership and was responsible for appointing T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç as commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet. He gave voice to T≈çg≈ç's reports when he read aloud his reports from the war to the assembled Diet. \\"Article 6 ‚Äì no title,\\" New York Times. 30 March 1904. Yamamoto was replaced as Navy Minister by Saito Makoto in January 1906. He was elevated to count (hakushaku) in 1907. As Prime Minister In February 1913, Yamamoto became Prime Minister of Japan in 1913, succeeding Katsura Taro as leader of then Rikken Seiyukai political party. During Yamamoto's first term as the prime minister, he abolished the rule that both the Navy Minister and Army Minister had to be active duty officers. This rule gave the military a stranglehold over the civilian government's the military could withdraw their minister and refuse to appoint a successor. Failure to fill the post would cause the existing cabinet to collapse. Thus, Yamamoto gained a reputation for being a liberal and a supporter of public claims for democracy and constitutional government. However, his administration was plagued by charges of corruption and he was forced to resign with his entire cabinet in April 1914 to take responsibility for the Siemens-Vickers Naval Armaments scandal, even though it was never proved that he was personally involved. Under the succeeded Okuma administration, Yamamoto was transferred to naval reserves. During World War I and the subsequent disarmament treaty negotiations, he remained sidelined. Yamamoto was recalled to government as Prime Minister again on 2 September 1923 in the emergency \\"earthquake cabinet\\" caused by the sudden death of Prime Minister Kat≈ç Tomosabur≈ç immediately following the Great Kant≈ç earthquake. He showed leadership in the restoration of Tokyo which had been heavily damaged by the earthquake. He also attempted to reform the electoral system to permit universal male suffrage. However, he and his cabinet were forced to resign again in January 1924, this time over the attempt by Namba Daisuke to assassinate Prince Regent Hirohito on 27 December 1923 (the Toranomon Incident). Subsequently, Yamamoto withdrew from political life completely. Suggestions that he be made one of the Genr≈ç were vehemently opposed by his life-long political enemy, Saionji Kinmochi, who also blocked all efforts for him to have a seat on the Privy Council. In December 1933, nine months after the death of his wife, Yamamoto died of complication due to Benign prostatic hyperplasia at his home in Takanawa, Tokyo at the age of 82. His grave is at the Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo.

Hara held several minor ambassadorial roles before rising through the ranks of the Rikken Seiy≈´kai and being elected to the House of Representatives. Hara served as Home Minister in several cabinets under Saionji Kinmochi and Yamamoto Gonnohy≈çe between 1906 and 1913. Hara was appointed Prime Minister following the Rice Riots of 1918 and positioned himself as a moderate, participating in the Paris Peace Conference, founding the League of Nations, and relaxing oppressive policies in Japanese Korea. Hara's premiership oversaw the Siberian intervention and the March 1st Movement. Hara was assassinated by Nakaoka Kon'ichi on 4 November 1921. Hara was the first commoner and first Christian appointed to be Prime Minister of Japan, informally known as Hara Kei, and given the moniker of . Early life Hara Takashi was born on 15 March 1856 in Motomiya, a village near Morioka, Mutsu Province, into a samurai family in service of the Nanbu Domain. Hara's family had resisted the Meiji Restoration in 1868 and fought against the establishment of the very government which Hara himself would one day lead. Hara was an outsider in Japanese politics due to his association with a former enemy clan of the new Imperial Government, which at the time was dominated by the former clans of Ch≈çsh≈´ and Satsuma domains. Hara left home at the age of 15 and moved to Tokyo by boat. Hara failed the entrance examination of the prestigious Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, and instead joined the Marin Seminary, a free parochial school established by the French. It was here that he learned to speak French language fluently. Soon after that, Hara joined the law school of the Ministry of Justice (later University of Tokyo), but left without graduating to take responsibility for a student protest against the school‚Äôs room and board policy. At the age of 17, Hara was baptized as a Catholic, taking on \\"David\\" as his baptismal name. Even though it was speculated that Hara became Christian for personal gain at the time, he remained a Christian in public life until the day he died. At the age of 19, Hara chose to classify himself as a rather than his family's status as shizoku (Â£´Êóè), a distinction for former samurai families who were not made into kazoku (ËèØÊóè, aristocratic peers). At various times later in his political career, offers were made to raise his rank, but Hara refused them every time on the basis that it would alienate himself from the common men and limit his ability to gain entrance to the House of Representatives. Beginning in 1879, Hara worked as a newspaper reporter for three years, but quit his job in protest over efforts of his editors to make the newspaper a mouthpiece for the Rikken Kaishint≈ç, a political party led by ≈åkuma Shigenobu. In 1882, Hara took a position in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the request of Inoue Kaoru, the Foreign Minister at the time. Based on discussions Hara had with him on his views for the future of Japanese politics during a trip both men took to Korea in 1884, Inoue appointed Hara to become consul-general in Tianjin, and the first secretary to the embassy of Japan in Paris. Hara served as Vice-minister of Foreign Affairs and as ambassador to Korea under Mutsu Munemitsu. He then left the Foreign Ministry to work as a journalist for several years, and became the manager of a newspaper company, the Mainichi Shimbun based in Osaka. Political career In 1900, Hara returned to politics and joined It≈ç Hirobumi's newly-founded Rikken Seiy≈´kai, becoming the first secretary-general of the party. Hara ran successfully for the House of Representatives as a representative from his native Iwate Prefecture and was appointed Minister of Communications in the Fourth Ito Administration. Hara later served as Home Minister in several cabinets between 1906 and 1913, a powerful position that made it able for him to effect many reforms. Hara realized that a fundamental political issue in Japan was the tension between the elected government and the appointed bureaucracy, and his career was dedicated to weakening the power of the non-elected bureaucrats. As Home Minister, Hara tried to implement meritocracy by systematically dismissing local bureaucrats in local governments in every capacity from governors down to high school principals. Any public employee who fell under his power would be replaced by someone in whom he saw real ability instead of a mere useful recipient of a favor or nepotism. Thus, Hara created a system in which people with talent could rise to the top of the bureaucracy, regardless of their background or rank. Hara also understood that maintenance of the supremacy of the elected leaders depended on the government‚Äôs ability to develop the Japanese national infrastructure and on a long-term economic plan that would address regional as well as national interests. In 1914, after heated debate, Hara was appointed the president of the Rikken Seiy≈´kai to replace the outgoing leader, Saionji Kinmochi. Under Hara's leadership, Rikken Seiy≈´kai first lost its majority control of the Diet in the 1915 general elections, but regained its majority in the 1917 general elections. =Prime Minister= In 1918, Prime Minister Terauchi Masatake fell from office due to the Rice Riots of 1918, and Hara was appointed as his successor on 28 September. It was the first cabinet headed by a commoner. Also, Hara was the first civilian in Japanese history to become the administrative chief of any of the armed services, when he temporarily took charge of the Navy Ministry, in absence of the Navy Minister, Admiral Kat≈ç Tomosabur≈ç, who was serving as the Japanese representative at the Washington Naval Conference. As prime minister, Hara suffered in terms of popularity, because he refused to use his majority in the lower house to force through universal suffrage legislation. Hara's cautious approach disappointed liberals and socialists, who accused him of delaying universal suffrage as it would endanger his position in power. As a party politician, Hara had never been the favorite of the conservatives, bureaucrats and military, and he was widely despised by the ultranationalists. During his term of office, Japan participated in the Paris Peace Conference, and joined the League of Nations as a founding member. In Korea, Japan used military force to suppress the Samil Rebellion, but later began more lenient policies aimed at reducing opposition to Japanese rule. Particularly following the Samil Uprising, Hara pursued a conciliatory policy towards colonies, particularly Korea. Hara arranged for his political ally, Sait≈ç Makoto, a political moderate, to take over as Governor-General of Korea; he instituted a colonial administration consisting mainly of civilians rather than military; and he permitted a degree of cultural freedom for Koreans, including (for the first time) a school curriculum that featured Korean language and history. Hara also sought to encourage a limited amount of self-rule in Korea - provided that, ultimately, Koreans remained under Japanese imperial control. His overtures, however, won few supporters either among Koreans or Japanese; the former considered them inadequate, the latter considered them excessive. Hara oversaw most of the Siberian intervention, which led to growing antagonism between the government and the military. Death Tokyo Station in 1914 On 4 November 1921, Hara was stabbed to death by Nakaoka Kon'ichi, a right-wing railroad switchman, at T≈çky≈ç Station while catching a train to Kyoto for a party conference. Nakaoka's motives for assassinating Hara were his beliefs that Hara was corrupt, involving the zaibatsu in Japanese politics, going to pass universal suffrage, and his handling of the Nikolayevsk incident during the Siberian intervention a year earlier. Nakaoka was also influenced by his boss, who was a vocal opponent of Hara. Nakaoka was initially sentenced to death before being re-sentenced to life imprisonment, but was released only 13 years after committing the murder. Hara was replaced by Uchida Kosai as acting Prime Minister until Uchida was replaced a week later by Takahashi Korekiyo. As opposed to many of his contemporaries, Hara lived a relatively simple lifestyle in a rented home near Shiba Park in downtown Tokyo. In his will, he left very few assets behind but among these was his diary, stating that \\"After a period of some years my diary must be made public. It is the most valuable of all my possessions, so it must be protected.\\" According to the will, Hara's diary was made public and what came to be called the turned out to be one of the most valuable first hand accounts of the political scene in that era. Most of his daily activities are written along with opinions and thoughts regarding the political figures of the time. Hara's diary itself is thousands of pages long but reveals, in depth, a broad range of information previously unknown to historians.

Takahashi made many contributions to Japan's development during the early 20th century, including introducing its first patent system and securing foreign financing for the Russo-Japanese War. Following the onset of the Great Depression, he introduced controversial financial policies which included abandoning the gold standard, lowering interest rates, and using the Bank of Japan to finance deficit spending by the central government. His decision to cut government spending in 1935 led to unrest within the Japanese military, who assassinated him in February 1936. Takahashi's policies are credited for pulling Japan out of the Depression, but led to soaring inflation following his assassination, as Takahashi's successors became highly reluctant to cut off funding to the government. Early life Takahashi was born in Edo (modern-day Tokyo), while Japan was still under the Tokugawa shogunate.Bank of Japan (BOJ), 7th Governor He was the illegitimate son of a court painter in residence at Edo Castle, and adopted as the son of Takahashi Kakuji, a low-ranking samurai in the service of the Date daimy≈ç of Sendai Domain. He studied English language and American culture in a private school run by the missionary James Hepburn (the forerunner of Meiji Gakuin University). On 25 July 1867, he set sail from Japan to Oakland, California, in the United States,Smethurst, p. 22 and found employment as a menial laborer. Another version of the story has it that he went to the United States to study, but was sold as a slave by his landlord and only with some difficulty was he able to return to Japan.http://www.minato-ala.net/details/guide2/e/0228.html Career Korekiyo Takahashi After his return to Japan in 1868, Takahashi taught English conversation. He later became the first master of the Ky≈çritsu Gakk≈ç high school in Tokyo, (currently Kaisei High School), and at the same time worked as a low-ranking bureaucrat in the Ministry of Education, and then in the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. He was appointed as the first chief of the Bureau of Patents, a department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, and helped organized the patent system in Japan. At one point, he resigned his government positions and went to Peru to start a silver mining enterprise, but failed. Takahashi became an employee of the Bank of Japan in 1892, and his talents were soon recognized, as he rose to become vice- president in 1898. During and after the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905, Takahashi raised foreign loans that were critical to Japan's war effort. He met personally with American financier Jacob Schiff, who floated half of Japan's loans in the U.S. He also raised loans from the Rothschild family in Britain. For this success, he was appointed to the House of Peers of the Diet of Japan in 1905. Takahashi was named president of the Yokohama Specie Bank in 1906. He was made a baron (danshaku) under the kazoku peerage system in 1907. Takahashi was Governor of the Bank of Japan from 1 June 1911, through 20 February 1913.BOJ, List of Governors. =Political offices= Takahashi Korekiyo, late 1920's In 1913, Takahashi was appointed Minister of Finance by Prime Minister Yamamoto Gonnohy≈çe and then joined the Rikken Seiy≈´kai political party. He was re-appointed by Prime Minister Hara Takashi in 1918. In 1920, Takahashi's title was elevated to viscount (shishaku). After Hara was assassinated in 1921, Takahashi was appointed both Prime Minister and the Rikken Seiy≈´kai party president. Takahashi was the second Christian Prime Minister in Japanese history. His term lasted less than seven months, primarily due to his inability as an outsider to control the factions in his party, and his lack of a power base in the party. After resigning as Prime Minister, Takahashi still retained the position of president of the Rikken Seiy≈´kai. He resigned his seat in the House of Peers in 1924, and was elected to a seat in the Lower House of the Diet of Japan in the 1924 General Election. When Kat≈ç Takaaki became the prime minister and set up a coalition cabinet in 1924, Takahashi accepted the post of Minister of Agriculture and Commerce. He divided the department into the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Takahashi resigned from the Rikken Seiy≈´kai in 1925. Takahashi served as Finance Minister under the administrations of Tanaka Giichi (1927‚Äì1929), Inukai Tsuyoshi (1931‚Äì1932), Sait≈ç Makoto (1932‚Äì1934) and Okada Keisuke (1934‚Äì1936). To bring Japan out of the Great Depression of 1929, he instituted dramatically expansionary monetary and fiscal policy, abandoning the gold standard in December 1931, and running deficits. Despite considerable success, his fiscal policies involving reduction of military expenditures created many enemies within the military; and he was among those assassinated by rebelling military officers in the February 26 Incident of 1936. His grave is at the Tama Reien Cemetery in Fuch≈´, Tokyo.

(2005). \\"Kiyoura Keigo\\" in . He was the Prime Minister of Japan in 1924, during the period which historians have called the \\"Taish≈ç Democracy\\".  Early life  Kiyoura was born with the name Fujaku in Kamoto-gun, Higo Province (part of present- day Yamaga, Kumamoto), as the fifth son of a Buddhist priest named ≈åkubo Ryoshi. He studied at the private school of Hirose Tanso from 1865 to 1871. During this time, he befriended Governor Nomura Morihide and took up the name \\"Kiyoura Keigo\\".  Political career  Nomura was appointed governor of Saitama Prefecture in 1873 and appointed Kiyoura to a junior-grade civil service position there. In 1876, at the age of twenty-six, Kiyoura joined the Ministry of Justice, and served as a prosecutor and helping draft Japan's first modern Criminal procedures laws. In 1884 he caught the attention of Yamagata Aritomo who appointed him head of the police forces in Japan, despite his relative youth of 34. Kiyoura went on to serve as Vice Minister of Justice, and Minister of Justice and while at the Ministry of Justice, he helped draft the Peace Preservation Law of 1887. In 1891, he was selected as a member of the House of Peers by Imperial nomination. A close ally of Yamagata Aritomo, he was rewarded with numerous cabinet positions, including that of Justice Minister in the second Matsukata and second Yamagata administrations, and Justice, Agriculture and Commerce ministers in the first Katsura administration. In 1902, Kiyoura was elevated to the title of baron (danshaku) in the kazoku peerage system. He received the 1st class of the Order of the Sacred Treasures the following year, and in 1906 was awarded with the 1st class of the Order of the Rising Sun. In September 1907, his title was elevated to viscount (shishaku). In 1914, while he was Chairman of the Privy Council, Kiyoura received an imperial order appointing him Prime Minister of Japan following Yamamoto Gonnohy≈çe. However, Kiyoura declined the post because of the controversy involving the ongoing Siemens scandal and ≈åkuma Shigenobu was chosen to become prime minister instead.  As prime minister  Kiyoura accepted a second imperial order in 1924 following the Toranomon Incident, and become 23rd Prime Minister of Japan. However, his cabinet was formed at a time when non-partisan, aristocratic cabinets were falling out of favor, and the Diet's lower house held up most of his initiatives for all six months of his administration. Perhaps the most important event during his term as prime minister was the royal wedding of Crown Prince Hirohito (the future Emperor Sh≈çwa) with Nagako Kuniyoshi (the future Empress K≈çjun) on 26 January 1924. In 1924, he dissolved the Lower House of the Diet of Japan when faced with the three party coalition of the Kenseikai, Rikken Seiy≈´kai and Kakushin Club which had formed a majority in Diet of more than 150 seats. As a result of his massive rout in the subsequent general election, his cabinet resigned en masse. In November 1928, Kiyoura was elevated to the title of Count (hakushaku). He was posthumously awarded the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum in 1942.

Early life and military career Tanaka was born as the third son of a low-ranking samurai family in the service of Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain in Hagi, Nagato Province (modern day Yamaguchi Prefecture), Japan. At the age of 13, he participated in the Hagi Rebellion. He had an interest in politics from an early age, serving on a village council and as an elementary school teacher. He only joined the Imperial Japanese Army at the age of 20. He graduated from the former 8th class of Imperial Japanese Army Academy and the 8th class of the Army War College in 1892, and served as a junior officer during the First Sino-Japanese War. After the end of the war, he was sent as a military attach√© to Moscow and Petrograd, and was in Russia at the same time as Takeo Hirose of the Imperial Japanese Navy, with whom he became close friends. Tanaka was fluent in the Russian language, which he learned while attending mass every Sunday at a Russian Orthodox church, which enabled him to practice his Russian at church social events, although it is uncertain if he ever actually converted to Christianity. As one of the few Russian experts within the military, he was an invaluable resource to Army planners during the Russo-Japanese War, and served as aide to General Kodama Gentar≈ç in Manchuria. Tanaka (left) walking with Generals ≈åshima Ken'ichi (center) and Uehara (right), 1918 In 1906, Tanaka helped draft a defense plan which was so highly regarded by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff and General Yamagata Aritomo that it was adopted as basic policy until World War I. He was also awarded the Order of the Golden Kite (3rd class) in April 1906. In 1910, he established a Veterans Association. Tanaka was promoted to major general in 1911, and was made director of the Military Affairs Bureau at the Ministry of the Army, where he recommended an increase in the strength of the standing army by two additional infantry divisions. He was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure (1st class) in September 1918. He joined the cabinet of Prime Ministers Hara Takashi as Army Minister from September 1918 to June 1921. He was promoted to full general in 1920 and was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (1st class). He was also elevated to the title of danshaku (baron) under the kazoku peerage system. However, the Hara cabinet came under unceasing criticism due to the Nishihara Loans, the disastrous Nikolayevsk incident and accusations of Army misappropriation of secret funds, and supporting unsavory figures such as White Movement general Roman von Ungern-Sternberg. After suffering from an attack of angina, Tanaka resigned all posts, and retired to his summer home in Oiso, Kanagawa. Politician and Prime Minister Tanaka, before 1929 Tanaka returned as Army Minister in the 2nd Yamamoto administration from September 1923 to January 1924. After retiring from the army, Tanaka was invited to accept the post of party president of the Rikken Seiy≈´kai political party in 1925, and was made a member of the House of Peers from January 1926. He had been scheduled to be promoted to the rank of Field Marshal at the time of his retirement. However, when news reached the ears of the Army Ministry of a 3 million Yen bonus that Tanaka received on agreeing to join the Rikken Seiyukai, the promotion was denied. Tanaka became Prime Minister of Japan on 20 April 1927, during the Sh≈çwa financial crisis, serving simultaneously as the Foreign Affairs Minister. He later added the posts of Home Minister (4 May 1928 to 23 May 1928), and Colonial Affairs Minister (10 June 1929 to 2 July 1929) to his portfolio. On the domestic front, Tanaka attempted to suppress leftists, Communists and suspected Communist sympathizers through widespread arrests (the 15 March incident of 1928, and the 19 April incident of 1929). On foreign policy, Tanaka differed from his predecessor Shidehara both tactically and strategically. Whereas Shidehara preferred to evacuate Japanese residents where conflicts occurred with local people, Tanaka preferred using military force. While Shidehara theoretically respected China's sovereignty, Tanaka openly pursued a to create a sense of difference between those areas and the rest of China. On three separate occasions in 1927 and 1928 he sent troops to intervene militarily in Shandong Province to block Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition to unify China under Kuomintang rule, in what became known as the Jinan Incident. Tanaka came into office even as forces were already beginning to converge that would draw Japan into World War II. In 1928, however, the machinations of the ultranationalist secret societies and the Kwantung Army resulted in a crisis: the assassination of the Manchurian warlord Zhang Zuolin and the failed attempt to seize Manchuria. Tanaka himself was taken by surprise by the assassination plot and argued that the officers responsible should be publicly court-martialed for homicide. The military establishment, from which Tanaka was by now estranged, insisted on covering up the facts of the incident, which remained an official secret. Bereft of support, and under mounting criticism in the Diet and even from Emperor Hirohito himself, Tanaka and his cabinet resigned en masse on 2 July 1929. Prime Ministers Korekiyo Takahashi (1854‚Äì1936, in office 1921‚Äì22, left) and Giichi Tanaka (1864‚Äì1929, in office 1927‚Äì29) Tanaka was succeeded by Hamaguchi Osachi, and died a few months after his resignation. He was awarded the Order of the Paulownia Flowers on his death. His grave is at the Tama Cemetery in Fuch≈´, Tokyo.Tama Cemetery The Tanaka Memorial In 1929, China accused Tanaka of having authored the \\"Tanaka Memorial Imperialist Conquest Plan\\", which advocated the conquest of Manchuria, Mongolia, and eventually the whole of China. He was alleged to have presented the plan to the Emperor in 1927. The plan was presented as fact in the wartime propaganda film series Why We Fight, which claimed that the plan envisaged the conquest of America after East Asia.Dower, John W (1987). War Without Mercy: Race and Power in the Pacific War. Pantheon. . p. 22. In a memoir published in the mid-1950s, a Japanese-born Taiwanese businessman, Tsai Chih-Kan, claimed that he had personally copied the \\"Plan\\" from the Imperial Library on the night of 20 June 1928, in a covert action assisted by several of Japan's leading pre-war politicians and officers who were opposed to Tanaka. Today, most historians regard the document as a forgery.Êó•Êú¨ÊâπÂà§„ÅÆÊ†πÊã†„ÄéÁî∞‰∏≠‰∏äÂ•èÊñá„Äè ‰∏≠ÂõΩÂÅ¥ „ÄéÂÅΩÁâ©„ÄèË™ç„ÇÅ„ÇãË¶ãËß£ , Tokyo Shimbun, 1 January 2008 Awards and Decorations From the corresponding article in the Japanese Wikipedia =Japanese= * 1906 ‚Äì link=Order of the Golden Kite Order of the Golden Kite, 3rd class‰∏≠ÈáéÊñáÂ∫´ Êóß„ÉªÈáëÈµÑÂã≤Á´†ÂèóÁ´†ËÄÖ‰∏ÄË¶ß * 1918 ‚Äì link=Order of the Sacred Treasure Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure„ÄéÂÆòÂ†±„ÄèÁ¨¨1850Âè∑„ÄåÂèô‰ªªÂèäËæû‰ª§„Äç2 October 1918 * 1920 ‚Äì link=Order of the Rising Sun Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun„ÄéÂÆòÂ†±„ÄèÁ¨¨2431Âè∑„ÄåÂèô‰ªªÂèäËæû‰ª§„Äç8 September 1920 * 1929 ‚Äì Order of the Rising Sun with Paulownia Flowers Order of the Paulownia Flowers„Äé„ÄéÂÆòÂ†±„ÄèÁ¨¨828Âè∑„ÄåÂèô‰ªªÂèäËæû‰ª§„Äç1 October 1929 =Foreign= * 1914 ‚Äì Order of Saint Alexander - Bulgaria, Order of Saint Alexander 2nd class„ÄéÂÆòÂ†±„ÄèÁ¨¨644Âè∑„ÄåÂèô‰ªªÂèäËæû‰ª§„Äç22 September 1914 * 1918 ‚Äì link=Order of the Striped Tiger - China, Order of the Striped Tiger, 2nd class„ÄéÂÆòÂ†±„ÄèÁ¨¨1695Âè∑„ÄåÂèô‰ªªÂèäËæû‰ª§„Äç30 March 1918 * 1927 ‚Äì link=Order of Polonia Restituta - Poland, Order of Polonia Restituta, Grand Cordon„ÄéÂÆòÂ†±„ÄèÁ¨¨828Âè∑„ÄåÂèô‰ªªÂèäËæû‰ª§„Äç9 October 1927 * 1929 ‚Äì link=Order of the Dannebrog - Denmark, Order of the Dannebrog, 1st class„ÄéÂÆòÂ†±„ÄèÁ¨¨777Âè∑„ÄåÂèô‰ªªÂèäËæû‰ª§„Äç1 August 1929 * 1929 ‚Äì link=Order of Saint Michael and Saint George - UK, Knight Commander of The Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George (KCMG)„ÄéÂÆòÂ†±„ÄèÁ¨¨828Âè∑„ÄåÂèô‰ªªÂèäËæû‰ª§„Äç1 October 1929 * 1929 ‚Äì link=Order of the British Empire - UK, Knight Grand Cross of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (GBE) Notes References * Gluck, Carol.

Early life and career Hamaguchi was born in Nagaoka District, Tosa Province (now part of K≈çchi city, K≈çchi Prefecture on the island of Shikoku). He was the third son of Minaguchi Tanehira, an official in the local forestry department, and took the Hamaguchi name on his marriage to Hamaguchi Natsuko in 1889. Hamaguchi graduated from the Law College of Tokyo Imperial University in 1895 and began his career as a bureaucrat in the Ministry of Finance.Jansen. The Making of Modern Japan.

Hamaguchi was elected to the lower house in the Japanese Diet in 1915 from the K≈çchi Second District, and was to hold onto this seat until his death in 1931. In June 1924, Hamaguchi served as Finance Minister under the first Kat≈ç administration, holding the same portfolio under the 1st Wakatsuki administration from January to June 1926. As Finance Minister, he pursued fiscal retrenchment, and proposed reducing government spending by 17 percent and laying off tens of thousands of government workers; however, his policies had to be scaled considerably back due to strenuous opposition from government bureaucrats.Lever of Empire, p. 155. Hamaguchi was subsequently Home Minister in the Wakatsuki cabinet from June 1926 to April 1927. In a continuation of his efforts while as Finance Minister, Hamaguchi promoted a moral campaign through sponsorship of movies which emphasized thrift and reduced public consumption, with the goal of helping reduce Japan's trade deficit.Metzler, page 155 In 1927, Hamaguchi became the chairman of the new Rikken Minseit≈ç political party formed by the merger of the Kenseikai and the Seiy≈´hont≈ç.  The 1st Hamaguchi administration  After the collapse of the administration of Tanaka Giichi in June 1929, Hamaguchi was selected to become Prime Minister of Japan and formed a cabinet based largely on Minseit≈ç party members, which supported domestic economic reforms over overseas military adventurism.Hirohito, p. 208-209. With a strong sense of his own rectitude and a tough, stubborn temperament, Hamaguchi inspired trust, promising that he was \\"ready to die if necessary\\" for the good of the country during his inaugural speech and promising an administration free of corruption. Hamaguchi's primary concern was the Japanese economy, which had been in an ever-increasing recession since the end of World War I, and had been greatly weakened by the devastation caused by the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake. Hamaguchi promoted retrenchment, deflation and the rationalization of industry. The 1929 Great Depression, starting soon after he took office, put further pressure on the economy. Initial public confidence and strong support from Emperor Hirohito and his entourage, including the genr≈ç Saionji Kinmochi allowed Hamaguchi to implement fiscal austerity measures, which included ratification of the London Naval Treaty of 1930, which curtailed military spending. However, his measures to help stimulate exports, such as maintaining the Japanese yen on the gold standard, proved disastrous. The failure of Hamaguchi's economic policies played into the hands of right-wing elements, already enraged by the government's conciliatory foreign policies and Japan‚Äôs increasing unemployment problems. The opposition Rikken Seiy≈´kai joined forces with the vocal anti-Treaty faction within the Imperial Japanese Navy to accuse Hamaguchi of infringing of the military's \\"right of supreme command\\" as guaranteed under the Meiji Constitution.Bix. Page 210 The spot at Tokyo Station where Osachi Hamaguchi was shot Plaque at Tokyo Station commemorating the shooting of Osachi Hamaguchi Hamaguchi's initial popularity quickly waned, and he fell victim to an assassination attempt on 14 November 1930 when he was shot inside Tokyo Station by Tomeo Sagoya, a member of the Aikokusha ultranationalist secret society. (Nine years earlier another Prime Minister, Hara Takashi, had been assassinated near the same place.) The head of the Aikoku-sha was Seiy≈´kai politician Ogawa Heikichi.Bix. Page 211-212 The wounds kept Hamaguchi hospitalized for several months.  The 2nd Hamaguchi administration  Hamaguchi was reelected to a second term as Prime Minister of Japan in March 1931. However, with his health continuing to deteriorate, he was unable to attend the 59th Session of the Imperial Diet, which opened with Foreign Minister Kij≈´r≈ç Shidehara as acting Prime Minister. The Seiy≈´kai immediately attacked the government on the grounds that the Prime Minister was not physically present, and that Shidehara was not even a member of the Minseit≈ç. When Shidehara further created an uproar with a comment concerning Emperor Hirohito's support of the London Naval Treaty, the Seiy≈´kai refused to participate in budget deliberations until Hamaguchi could attend. Despite his failing health, Hamaguchi was forced to attend the Diet, but resigned a month later to be replaced by Wakatsuki Reijir≈ç. He died on 26 August of the same year, and his grave is at the Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo. In 1931 Hamaguchi's cabinet sponsored a bill on women's suffrage. It would have granted women over the age of 25 the right to vote in local elections and stand for office given their husbands' approval. The bill passed the lower house, but it was defeated in the House of Peers in March 1931 by a vote of 184 to 62.Nolte, Sharon H. \\"Women's Rights and Society's Needs: Japan's 1931 Suffrage Bill,\\" Comparative Studies in Society and History, October 1986, Vol. 28, No. 4, p. 690-714.

Description The \\"crime of passion\\" defense challenges the mens rea element by suggesting that there was no malice aforethought, and instead the crime was committed in the \\"heat of passion.\\" In some jurisdictions, a successful \\"crime of passion\\" defense may result in a conviction for manslaughter or second degree murder instead of first degree murder, because a defendant cannot ordinarily be convicted of first degree murder unless the crime was premeditated. A classic example of a crime of passion involves a spouse who, upon finding his or her partner in bed with another, kills the romantic interloper. A love triangle featuring Paolo and Francesca da Rimini in The Divine Comedy (Dante Alighieri), depicted by Ingres. In the United States, claims of \\"crimes of passion\\" have been traditionally associated with the defenses of temporary insanity or provocation. This defense was first used by U.S. Congressman Daniel Sickles of New York in 1859; after he had killed his wife's lover, Philip Barton Key II. It was used as a defense in murder cases during the 1940s and 1950s. Historically, such defenses were used as complete defenses for various violent crimes, but gradually they became used primarily as a partial defense to a charge of murder; if the court accepts temporary insanity, a murder charge may be reduced to manslaughter. In some countries, notably France, crime passionnel (or crime of passion) was a valid defense to murder charges. During the 19th century, some such cases resulted in a custodial sentence for the murderer of two years. After the Napoleonic code was updated in the 1970s, paternal authority over the members of the family was ended, thus reducing the occasions for which crime passionnel could be claimed. The Canadian Department of Justice, has described crimes of passion as \\"abrupt, impulsive, and unpremeditated acts of violence committed by persons, who have come face to face with an incident unacceptable to them, and who are rendered, incapable of self-control for the duration of the act.\\" Advocacy In recent decades, feminists and women's rights organizations have worked to change laws and social norms which tolerate crimes of passion against women. UN Women has urged states to review legal defenses of passion and provocation, and other similar laws, to ensure that such laws do not lead to impunity in regard to violence against women, stating that \\"laws should clearly state that these defenses do not include or apply to crimes of ‚Äúhonour‚Äù, adultery, or domestic assault or murder.\\" There are differences between crimes of passion (which are generally impulsive and committed by and against both genders) and honour killings, as \\"while crimes of passion may be seen as somewhat premeditated to a certain extent, honour killings are usually deliberate, well planned and premeditated acts when a person kills a female relative ostensibly to uphold his honour.\\" However, Widney Brown, advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, argued that \\"crimes of passion have a similar dynamic in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived as excusable or understandable\\". Some human rights advocates say that the crimes of passion in Latin America are treated leniently. The Council of Europe Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence states that member states should \\"preclude adultery as an excuse for violence within the family\\". By country =Australia= In Australia, as in other common law jurisdictions, crimes of passion have traditionally been subjected to the partial defense of provocation, which converts what would have been murder into manslaughter. In recent years, the defense of provocation has come under increased criticism, and, as a result, legal changes have abolished or restricted its application: in 2003, Tasmania became the first state to abolish the partial defense of provocation; the next state to abolish it was Victoria, in 2005; followed by Western Australia in 2008. ACT and Northern Territory have amended the laws to exclude non-violent homosexual sexual advances, in 2004 and 2006, respectively. In Queensland the partial defense of provocation in section 304(1) of the Criminal Code was amended in 2011, in order to \\"reduce the scope of the defense being available to those who kill out of sexual possessiveness or jealousy\\". In 2014, the New South Wales law on provocation was amended to provide that the provocative conduct of the deceased must also have constituted a serious indictable offense. =Brazil= Killing of wives due to adultery has been traditionally treated very leniently in Brazil, in court cases where husbands claimed the \\"legitimate defense of their honor\\" (legitima defesa da honra) as justification for the killing. Although this defense was not explicitly stipulated in the 20th-century Criminal Code, it has been successfully pleaded by lawyers throughout the 20th century, in particular in the countryside, though less so in the coastal big cities. In 1991 Brazil‚Äôs Supreme Court explicitly rejected the \\"honor defense\\" as having no basis in Brazilian law. =France= Prior to 1975, the French Penal Code of 1810 allowed lighter sentences for crimes of passion. Article 324 permitted the murders of an unfaithful wife and her lover at the hand of her husband, though only \\"at the moment\\" when the wife and her lover were \\"[caught] in the fact\\" by the husband in the matrimonial home. On November 7, 1975, Law no. 617/75 Article 17 repealed Article 324. Many countries, including some western countries like Belgium, were legally influenced by the Article 324. Prior to 1997, Belgian law provided for mitigating circumstances in the case of a killing or assault against a spouse caught in the act of adultery.http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/bitstream/2268/36305/1/ULg- Liber%20amicorum%20Bosly%20-%20Masset.pdf. In Luxembourg, Article 413 (repealed in 2003) provided mitigating circumstances for murder, assault and injury of an adulterous spouse.https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/Review/responses/LUXEMBOURG- English.pdf Article 324 of the French penal code was copied by Middle Eastern Arab countries. According to the Honour Based Violence Awareness Network, the penal codes that were enacted under the Napoleonic Empire influenced the development of laws in North Africa and the Middle East. These laws permit reduced sentences for murders that are \\"related to honour\\". The French Article 324 inspired Jordan's Article 340 and Article 98.Stefanie Eileen Nanes, ‚ÄúFighting Honor Crimes: Evidence of Civil Society in Jordan,‚Äù Middle East Journal, vol. 57, no.1 (Winter 2003), p. 6. The 1858 Ottoman Penal Code's Article 188 was also inspired by Article 324. Both the French Article 324 and Ottoman article 188 were drawn on to create Jordan's Article 340, which was retained after a 1944 revision of laws, and still applies to this day. =Italy= As with other countries in Mediterranean Europe, Italy has a long tradition of treating crimes of passion with leniency. Until 1981, the law read: \\"Art. 587: He who causes the death of a spouse, daughter, or sister upon discovering her in illegitimate carnal relations and in the heat of passion caused by the offence to his honour or that of his family will be sentenced to three to seven years. The same sentence shall apply to whom, in the above circumstances, causes the death of the person involved in illegitimate carnal relations with his spouse, daughter, or sister.\\" =Roman Empire= In the Roman Empire the Roman law Lex Julia de adulteriis coercendis implemented by Augustus Caesar in 18 B.C.E. permitted the killing of daughters and their lovers who committed adultery at the hands of their fathers and also permitted the killing of the adulterous wife's lover at the hand of her husband. =United Kingdom= Killing due to adultery traditionally fell under the provocation defense. In 1707, English Lord Chief Justice John Holt described the act of a man having sexual relations with another man's wife as \\"the highest invasion of property\\" and claimed, in regard to the aggrieved husband, that \\"a man cannot receive a higher provocation\\".http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WG/BackgroundNoteAdultery2.doc Although provocation in English law was abolished on 4 October 2010The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (Commencement No. 4, Transitional and Saving Provisions) Order 2010 (S.I. 2010/816 (C. 56)), article 6(b); and see here by section 56(1) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, it was replaced by a relatively similar defence of \\"loss of control\\" created by section 54. There has been considerable controversy regarding the application by the courts of the new law; although section 55 states \\"(6) In determining whether a loss of self-control had a qualifying trigger (...) (c) the fact that a thing done or said constituted sexual infidelity is to be disregarded\\", in a controversial decision by Lord Judge in R v Clinton [2012] 1 Cr App R 26 in the Court of Appeal, Lord Judge interpreted the new offence as allowing for sexual infidelity to count under the third prong of the new defence (see Baker and Zhao 2012). This decision has received heavy criticism from academics (see Baker and Zhao, \\"Contributory Qualifying and Non-Qualifying Triggers in the Loss of Control Defence: A Wrong Turn on Sexual Infidelity,\\" Journal of Criminal Law, Vol. 76, pp. 254, 2012). Vera Baird has also been very critical of the decision, writing, \\"It seems that parliament says infidelity doesn't count and the court says it does.\\" in 2009 a man was cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter by reason of provocation for stabbing his partner and his best friend to death when he found them having sex. In another case, sexual infidelity leading to a \\"loss of control\\" was considered acceptable as a defence by Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge, potentially reducing a murder charge to manslaughter. =Uruguay= In Uruguay, crimes of passion continue to be legally tolerated; in certain circumstances, the law exonerates a perpetrator when a killing or a battery was committed due to \\"passion provoked by adultery\\". Article 36 of the Criminal Code provides for this: \\"Art√≠culo 36. (La pasi√≥n provocada por el adulterio) La pasi√≥n provocada por el adulterio faculta al Juez para exonerar de pena por los delitos de homicidio y de lesiones, siempre que concurran los requisitos siguientes: :1. Que el delito se cometa por el c√≥nyuge que sorprendiera infraganti al otro c√≥nyuge y que se efect√∫e o contra el amante. :2. Que el autor tuviera buenos antecedentes y que la oportunidad para cometer el delito no hubiera sido provocada o simplemente facilitada, mediando conocimiento anterior de la infidelidad conyugal.\\" Translation: \\"Article 36. (The passion provoked by adultery) The passion provoked by adultery empowers the court to exempt from punishment for the crimes of homicide and injury, provided that the following conditions are present: # The offense is committed by one spouse against the other spouse whom he or she has caught in the act, or against the lover. # The perpetrator has a good record and the opportunity to commit the crime was not provoked or facilitated by prior knowledge of the marital infidelity.\\" Since 2013, there have been ongoing political efforts to remove this provision from the Criminal Code.

Inukai is Japan's oldest prime minister while serving as he was aged 76 on the last day of his tenure. Early life Inukai was born to a samurai family of Niwase Domain, in Niwase village, Bizen Province (now part of Okayama city, Okayama Prefecture), where his father had been a local official and magistrate under the Tokugawa shogunate. In 1876, Inukai travelled to Tokyo and subsequently graduated from the Keio Gijuku (now Keio University) where he specialized in Chinese studies. In his early career, Inukai worked as a journalist for the Y≈´bin H≈çchi Shimbun (now a sports newspaper subsidiary of the Yomiuri Shimbun) and Akita Sakigake Shimp≈ç. He went with the Imperial Japanese Army to the front during the Satsuma Rebellion as a reporter. Political career ≈åkuma Shigenobu invited Inukai to help form the Rikken Kaishint≈ç political party in 1882, which supported liberal political causes, strongly opposed the domination of the government by members of the former Ch≈çsh≈´ and Satsuma domains, and called for a British-style constitutional monarchy within the framework of a parliamentary democracy. Inukai was first elected to the Lower House of the Imperial Diet in 1890, and was subsequently reelected 17 times, holding the same seat for 42 years until his death. Inukai's first cabinet post was as Minister of Education in the first ≈åkuma Shigenobu administration of 1898, succeeding Ozaki Yukio, who was forced to resign due to a speech that conservative elements in the Diet charged promoted republicanism. However, Ozaki's resignation did not end the crisis, which culminated with the fall of the ≈åkuma administration, so Inukai's term lasted only eleven days.Ozaki, Autobiography, pp. 177‚Äì184. Inukai was a leading figure in the successors to the Rikken Kaishint≈ç, the Shimpot≈ç, Kenseit≈ç and the Rikken Kokumint≈ç, which eventually toppled the government of Katsura Tar≈ç in 1913. During this time, his politics became increasing conservative and he was associated with both leading figures from the Pan-Asian movement and with nationalists such as T≈çyama Mitsuru. He was also a strong supporter of the Chinese republican movement, visiting China in 1907, and subsequently lending aid to Sun Yat-sen during the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 which overthrew the Qing dynasty. He later assisted Sun when Sun had to flee to Japan after his attempt to overthrow Yuan Shikai failed. Inukai had a deep respect for Chinese culture, and felt that Sino-Japanese cooperation was the cornerstone of Asian solidarity.Lee. Sun Yat Sen. Page 64 Although in later years his vision of Sino-Japanese cooperation diverged greatly from Sun's, Inukai maintained close personal ties with many leading Chinese politicians. Inukai likewise supported the Vietnamese independence leader, Prince C∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªÉ, and invited him to Japan in 1915.Tran, A. Vietnamese Royal Exile in Japan. Page 95 Inukai returned to the cabinet as Minister of Communications in the second Yamamoto Gonnohy≈çe administration from 1923 to 1924. He was concurrently Education Minister again for a four-day period in September 1923 In 1922 the Rikken Kokumint≈ç became the Kakushin Club, and joined forces with other minor parties to form the cabinet during the premiership of Kat≈ç Takaaki in 1924. During his time, Inukai served on the cabinet again as Minister of Communications. The Kakushin Club then merged with the Rikken Seiy≈´kai, and Inukai continued as a senior member. In July 1929, Inukai travelled to Nanjing, China, with several other Japanese delegates at the invitation of Chinese government to a memorial service for Sun Yat-sen. The delegates later travelled to numerous other cities, and noted with concern the growing anti-Japanese sentiment.Fogel, The Literature of Travel. Page 227 In 1929, after the sudden death of Tanaka Giichi, Inukai became president of the Rikken Seiy≈´kai. Inukai was an outspoken critic of Japan's signing of the London Naval Treaty, which reduced military spending, supported the actions of the Imperial Japanese Army in invading Manchuria in 1931, and rejected criticism from the League of Nations over the Mukden Incident.Hirohito, p. 246. As Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi as a Prime Minister Following the resignation of the Wakatsuki administration over its failure to control the military and the failure of its economic policies, Saionji Kinmochi, Japan's sole surviving genr≈ç, turned to Inukai to form a new government in 1931. Following his appointment, Inukai was instructed by Saionji to avoid drastic changes in either foreign policy or economics. Already disadvantaged by the fact that his Seiyukai was not the majority party in the Diet, he was also saddled with a cabinet composed of competing factions, ranging from his ultra-rightist Army Minister Sadao Araki to the liberal Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo. With a divided cabinet and a hostile Diet, Inukai governed with the assistance of the Privy Council, which passed emergency imperial edicts and budgetary measures to circumvent the normal Diet budgetary process.Bix. Page 247 Inukai immediately took steps to inflate the economy and to take Japan off the gold standard, implementing protectionist trade policies and attempting to stem Japan's trade deficit. These actions devaluated the yen, thus lowering the price of Japanese goods in world markets, and increasing exports. However, Inukai was forced to accede to a request by the Imperial Japanese Army to dispatch additional troops to Manchuria and to Tianjin, despite instructions as late as 23 December 1931 from Emperor Hirohito to maintain international trust per the Nine-Power Treaty in not attacking China, and on 27 December 1931 not to authorize any moves by the Kwantung Army to occupy Jinzhou. However, by now the Imperial Japanese Army was completely beyond any civilian control and from January to March 1932 the conflict had spread to Shanghai with the 1st Shanghai Incident.Bix. Page 249‚Äì252 During the 1932 General Election, buoyed by an upsurge in public opinion due to Japanese military successes in China, the Rikken Seiyukai won an overwhelming majority. On 8 January 1932, a Korean independence activist named Lee Bong Chang attempted to assassinate Emperor Hirohito in the Sakuradamon Incident. Inukai and his cabinet immediately offered their resignations; however, Hirohito wished to downplay the incident and refused. However, Inukai still came under strong criticism for his efforts to rein in the military, while reformists criticized him for not going far enough. Inukai's efforts to limit further troop deployments to China and to defuse the Shanghai Incident through negotiations with the Chinese government drew increasing ire from the general public as well as the militarists. This soon metamorphosed into terrorist activity with the League of Blood Incident in which extremists targeted wealthy businessmen and liberal politicians. The group chose twenty victims but succeeded in killing only two: former Finance Minister and head of the Rikken Minseit≈ç, Junnosuke Inoue, and Director- General of Mitsui Holding Company, Dan Takuma. On 1 March, the state of Manchukuo was formally proclaimed. Symbolically, Inukai withheld formal diplomatic recognition as a gesture of displeasure against the radical faction within the Imperial Japanese Army, and out of concern due to the rapidly worsening international relations with the United States, for which Japan depended on much of its raw materials and capital investment. Inukai's struggle against the military led to his assassination during the May 15 Incident of 1932, which effectively marked the end of civilian political control over government decisions until after World War II. Inukai was shot by eleven junior Navy officers (most were just turning twenty years of age) in the Prime Minister's residence in Tokyo. Inukai's last words were roughly to which his killers replied .Toland, The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire, 1936‚Äì1945 The insurgents also attacked the residence of Makino Nobuaki, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, the residence and office of Saionji Kinmochi, headquarters of the Rikken Seiyukai, and tossed hand grenades into Mitsubishi Bank headquarters in Tokyo, and several electrical transformer substations. The original assassination plan had included killing the English film star Charlie Chaplin ‚Äì who had arrived in Japan on 14 May and was Inukai's guest ‚Äì in the hopes that this would provoke a war with the United States. However, at the time, Chaplin was watching a sumo wrestling match with the prime minister's son, Inukai Takeru, and thus escaped. Inukai‚Äôs murderers received only light sentences for their actions. Inukai's third son was writer, politician and post-war Minister of Justice Inukai Takeru. His great-granddaughter was Sadako Ogata, who served as United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees from 1991 until 2001.

Upon distinguishing himself during his command of two cruisers in the First Sino-Japanese War, Sait≈ç rose rapidly to the rank of rear admiral by 1900. He was promoted to vice admiral during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. After serving as Minister of the Navy from 1906 to 1914, Sait≈ç held the position of Governor-General of Korea from 1919 to 1927 and again from 1929 to 1931. When Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated in May 1932, he took his place as Prime Minister and served one term in office.

Biography Sait≈ç Makoto visits his close friend, Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo at his official residence on 20 February 1936. Less than a week after this photograph was taken, both were assassinated by ultranationalistic Army officers in the February 26 Incident. =Early life= Sait≈ç was born in Mizusawa Domain, Mutsu Province (part of present-day ≈åsh≈´ City Iwate Prefecture), as the son of a samurai of the Mizusawa Clan. In 1879, he graduated from the 6th class Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, ranking third out of a class of 17 cadets.Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), \\"Graduates of Naval Academy class 6th,\\" Saito Makoto; retrieved 2012-10-18. He was commissioned an ensign on September 8, 1882, and promoted to sub-lieutenant on February 25, 1884. =Military career= In 1884, Sait≈ç went to the United States for four years to study as a military attach√©. Promoted to lieutenant on July 14, 1886; in 1888, after returning to Japan, he served as a member of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff. After his promotion to lieutenant commander on December 20, 1893, he served as executive officer on the cruiser and battleship . During the First Sino-Japanese War, Sait≈ç served as captain of the cruisers and . He received rapid promotions to commander on December 1, 1897 and to captain on December 27. On November 10, 1898, he became Vice Minister of the Navy, and was promoted to rear admiral on May 20, 1900Nishida, Imperial Japanese Navy. =Political career= Sait≈ç was again Vice Navy Minister at the start of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905. He was promoted to vice admiral on June 6, 1904. He was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (1st class) in 1906. After the end of the war, he served as Navy Minister for 8 years, from 1906 to 1914, during which time he continually strove for expansion of the navy. On September 21, 1907, Sait≈ç was ennobled with the title of danshaku (baron) under the kazoku peerage system. On October 16, 1912, he was promoted to full admiral. However, on April 16, 1914, Sait≈ç was forced to resign from his post as Navy Minister due implications of his involvement in the Siemens scandal, and officially entered the reserves. In September 1919, Sait≈ç was appointed as the third Japanese Governor-General of Korea. Rising to the post right after the culmination of the Korean independence movement, he was subject to an immediate assassination attempt by Kang Woo-kyu, a radical Korean nationalist. He served as governor-general of Korea twice‚Äîin 1919‚Äì1927, and again in 1929‚Äì1931,WorldStatesmen.org, Republic of Korea, Governors-General; ewreiwcws 2012-10-18. implementing a series of measures to moderate Japan's policies on Koreans. He was awarded the Order of the Paulownia Flowers in 1924. On April 29, 1925, his title was elevated to that of shishaku (viscount). In 1927, Sait≈ç was a member of the Japanese delegation at the Geneva Naval Conference on Disarmament, and he later became a privy councillor. =Prime Minister= Following the assassination of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi on May 15, 1932 by fanatical navy officers who thought Inukai far too conciliatory (the May 15 Incident), Prince Saionji Kinmochi, one of the Emperor's closest and strongest advisors, attempted to stop the slide towards a military take-over of the government. In a compromise move, Sait≈ç was chosen to be Inukai's successor. Sadao Araki remained as War Minister and immediately began making demands on the new government. During Sait≈ç's tenure, Japan recognized the independence of Manchukuo, and withdrew from the League of Nations. Sait≈ç's administration was one of the longer- serving ones of the inter-war period, and it continued until July 8, 1934, when the cabinet resigned en masse because of the Teijin Incident bribery scandal. Keisuke Okada succeeded as prime minister. Sait≈ç continued to be an important figure in politics as Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal from December 26, 1935, but was assassinated during the February 26 Incident of 1936 at his home in Yotsuya, Tokyo. Takahashi, his predecessor, was shot dead the same day, along with several other top-rank politicians targeted by the rebels. Sait≈ç was posthumously awarded the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum.

He was commissioned an ensign on 9 July 1890. He later served as lieutenant on the and as well as the corvette Hiei.Nishida, Imperial Japanese Navy In the First Sino-Japanese War, Okada served on the . After his graduation from the Naval Staff College, he subsequently served on the and as executive officer on the . He was promoted to lieutenant on 9 December 1894, to lieutenant-commander on 29 September 1899 and to commander on 13 July 1904. During the Russo-Japanese War, Okada served as executive officer on a successor of vessels, including the , and Asahi. He was promoted to captain on 25 September 1908 and given his own command, the Kasuga on 25 July 1910. He later transferred to the in 1912. Promoted to rear admiral on 1 December 1913, Okada served in a number of desk jobs thereafter, including that of the Naval Shipbuilding Command. He was promoted to vice admiral on 1 December 1917 and to full admiral on 11 June 1924. Okada assumed the post of Commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet in 1924. In 1927, he became Minister of Navy in the administration of Tanaka Giichi, but resigned in 1929 to assume the post of military councillor on the Supreme War Council. Okada was one of the few supporters (Treaty Faction) within the upper ranks of the Imperial Japanese Navy of the arms reduction treaty resulting from the London Naval Treaty of 1930, which he helped negotiate and worked hard for its ratification. He again served as Navy Minister in the Sait≈ç Makoto cabinet of 1932. Okada entered the reserves on 21 January 1933 and retired five years later. Okada (left) and Denz≈ç Matsuo =Political career= In July 1934, Okada was named Prime Minister of Japan holding simultaneously the portfolio of Minister of Colonial Affairs. In the month of September 1935, he also briefly held the portfolio of Minister of Post and Telecommunications. Okada was one of the democratic and moderate voices against the increasing strength of the militarists, and was therefore a major target for extremist forces pushing for a more totalitarian Japan. He narrowly escaped assassination in the February 26 Incident of 1936, largely because rebel troops killed Colonel Denz≈ç Matsuo, brother-in-law as well as personal secretary of Okada's, by misidentifying him as the prime minister. Okada emerged from hiding on 29 February 1936. However, he left office a few days later. Okada was adamant in his opposition to the war with the United States. During World War II, Okada formed a group of like-minded politicians and military officers seeking an early end to the hostilities. After the defeat of Japanese forces at the Battle of Midway and Battle of Guadalcanal, Okada pushed for negotiations with the Allies, and played a leading role in the overthrow of the Hideki T≈çj≈ç cabinet in 1944. Okada died in 1952, and his grave is at the Tama Reien Cemetery, in Fuch≈´, Tokyo.

A Covenanters Conventicle.Lawson, Rev. R. (1885). Maybole Past and Present. Pub. J. & R. Parlane. p. 49. This law was a part of the Clarendon Code, named after Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, which aimed to discourage nonconformism and to strengthen the position of the Established Church. But the Clarendon Code was not actually the work of Clarendon himself, who favoured a policy of greater tolerance towards dissenters.History Learning Site ‚Äì Clarendon Code These prohibitions led many, such as the Covenanters, to vacate their parishes rather than submit to the new Episcopal authorities. Just as the ministers left so too did the congregations, following their old pastors to sermons on the hillside. From small beginnings these field assemblies‚Äîor conventicles‚Äîwere to grow into major problems of public order for the government. The operation of the Clarendon Code at least as far as Protestants were concerned was mitigated somewhat by Charles II's Royal Declaration of Indulgence in 1672, which suspended the execution of the Penal Laws and allowed a certain number of non-conformist chapels to be staffed and constructed, with the pastors subject to royal approval. The Conventicle Act was repealed in 1689. Jewish reaction Although aimed at Nonconformists, when the Conventicle Act was passed, the Jews led by their new rabbi, Jacob Sasportas, took their anxieties to Charles II, who told them, \\"laughing and spitting\\", not to worry; later the Privy Council put it in writing that Jews could \\"promise themselves the effects of the same favour as formerly they have had, so long as they demean themselves peaceably and quietly, with due obedience to His Majesty's laws and without scandal to his government\\". Thus the English Jews, by an act of omission, as it were, became full citizens, subject to no more disabilities than those inherent in their own unwillingness, like Catholics and Nonconformists, to belong to the Church of England or, in their particular case, to swear Christian oaths.Paul Johnson, A History of the Jews, p. 278 References *\\"Charles II, 1664: An Act to prevent and suppresse seditious Conventicles\\", Statutes of the Realm: volume 5: 1628‚Äì80 (1819), pp. 516‚Äì20.

It is a traditional part of Lent in several Christian denominations, particularly in Catholic tradition. Many Passion Plays historically encouraged antisemitism by blaming Jews collectively for the death of Jesus and led to pogroms and other violent acts against Jewish communities, especially in Europe. Origin and history Texcoco, Mexico =The Easter play precedent= The development of the Passion Play was about the same as that of the Easter Drama. It originated in the ritual of the Church, which prescribes, among other things, that the Gospel on Good Friday should be sung in parts divided among various persons. Later, the Passion Play made its appearance, first in Latin, then in vernacular languages; contents and forms were adapted more and more to audience expectations, until, in the fifteenth century, the popular religious plays had developed. The Benedictbeurn Passion Play (thirteenth century) is still largely composed of Latin ritual sentences in prose and of church hymns, and, being designed to be sung, resembles an oratorio. =Addition of music and characters= Yet even this oldest of the Passion Plays already shows a tendency to break away from the ritual and to adopt a more dramatic form. This evolution is shown by the interpolation of free translations of church hymns and of German verses not pertaining to such hymns, as well as by the appearance of Mary (the Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus) and Mary Magdalene in the action. From these humble beginnings, the Passion Play developed very rapidly, since in the fourteenth century it was at a stage of development that could not have been reached except by repeated practice. From this second period, we have the Vienna Passion, the St. Gall Passion, the oldest Frankfort Passion, and the Maestricht Passion. All four Plays, as they are commonly called, are written in rhyme, principally in German. =Expansion= The Vienna Passion embraces the entire history of the Redemption, and begins with the revolt and fall of Lucifer; the play, as transmitted to us, ends with Jesus and his Twelve Apostles sitting at the Last Supper. The oldest Frankfort Passion play, that of Canon Baldemar von Peterwell (1350‚Äì1381), the production of which required two days, was more profusely elaborated than the other Passion Plays of this period. Of this play only the Ordo sive Registrum has come down to us, a long roll of parchment for the use of the director, containing stage directions and the first words of the dialogues. The plays based on this list of directions lead us to the period in which the Passion Play reached its highest development (1400‚Äì1515). During this period the later Frankfort Passion Play (1467), the Alsfelder, and the Friedberger (1514) originated. Connected with this group are the Eger, the Donaueschingen, Augsburg, Freising and Lucerne Passion Plays, in which the whole world drama, beginning with the creation of man and brought down to the coming of the Holy Ghost, is exhibited, and which was produced with great splendour as late as 1583. The Tyrolese Passion Play =Expansion and consolidation of previous plays= Nearly all these Passion Plays have some relation to those coming from the Tyrol, some contributing to, others taking from, that source. These, again, are founded upon the Tyrolese Passion play which originated during the transition period of the fourteenth to the fifteenth century. Historian J. E. Wackernell, with the aid of the plays that have reached us, has reconstructed this period. In Tyrol the Passion Plays received elaborate cultivation; at Bolzano they were presented with great splendour and, in 1514, lasted no less than seven days. Here, too, the innovation of placing the female roles in the hands of women was introduced, which innovation did not become general until during the seventeenth century. =Elaborate, public productions= The magnificent productions of the Passion Plays during the fifteenth century are closely connected with the growth and increasing self-confidence of the cities, which found its expression in noble buildings, ecclesiastical and municipal, and in gorgeous public festivals. The artistic sense and the love of art of the citizens had, in co-operation with the clergy, called these plays into being, and the wealth of the citizens provided for magnificent productions of them on the public squares, whither they migrated after expulsion from the churches. The citizens and civil authorities considered it a point of honour to render the production as rich and diversified as possible. Ordinarily, the preparations for the play were in the hands of a spiritual brotherhood, the play itself being considered a form of worship. People of the most varied classes took part in the production, and frequently the number of actors was as high as two hundred and even greater. If was undoubtedly no small task to drill the performers, particularly since the stage arrangements were still very primitive. =Staging and set design= The stage was a wooden structure, almost as broad as it was long, elevated but slightly above the ground and open on all sides. A house formed the background; a balcony attached to the house represented Heaven. Under the balcony three crosses were erected. Sometimes the stage was divided into three sections by doors. Along the sides of the stage, taken lengthwise, stood the houses required for the production; they were indicated by fenced-in spaces, or by four posts upon which a roof rested. The entrance into Hell was pictured by the mouth of a monster, through which the Devil and the souls captured or released during the plays passed back and forth. The actors entered in solemn procession, led by musicians or by a pr√¶cursor (herald), and took their stand at the places appointed them. They remained on the stage all through the performance; they sat on the barriers of their respective divisions, and were permitted to leave their places only to recite their lines. As each actor finished speaking, he returned to his place. The audience stood around the stage or looked on from the windows of neighbouring houses. Occasionally platforms, called \\"bridges\\", were erected around the stage in the form of an amphitheatre. =Simplicity of scenery, dialog, action, and costumes= The scenery was the background of old-time middle east. There were no side scenes, and consequently no stage perspective. Since an illusion of reality could not be had, indications were made to suffice. Thus a cask standing on end represents the mountain on which Christ is tempted by the Devil; thunder is imitated by the report of a gun; in order to signify that the Devil had entered into him, Judas holds a bird of black plumage before his mouth and makes it flutter. The suicide of Judas is an execution, in which Beelzebub performs the hangman's duty. He precedes the culprit up the ladder and draws Judas after him by a rope. Judas has a black bird and the intestines of an animal concealed in the front of his clothing, and when Satan tears open the garment the bird flies away, and the intestines fall out, whereupon Judas and his executioner slide down into Hell on a rope. A painted picture representing the soul, is hung from the mouth of each of the two thieves on the cross; an angel takes the soul of the penitent, the devil that of the impenitent thief. Everything is presented in the concrete, just as the imagination of the audience pictures it, and the scenic conditions, resembling those of the antique theatre demand. All costume, however, is contemporary, historical accuracy being ignored. =Secularization of the Passion Play= The Passion Plays of the 15th century, with their peculiar blending of religious, artistic, and increasingly secular elements, gave a true picture of German city life of those times. Serious thought and lively humour were highly developed in these plays. When, however, the patricians, in the sixteenth century, withdrew more and more from the plays, the plays, left to the lower classes, began to lose their serious and (in spite of the comic traits) dignified character. The influence of the Carnival plays (Fastnachtspiele) was felt more and more. Master Grobianus with his coarse and obscene jests was even introduced into some of the Passion Plays. In time the ecclesiastical authorities forbade the production of these secularized plays. Thus, the Bishop of Havelberg commanded his clergy, in 1471, to suppress the Passion Plays and legend plays in their parish districts because of the disgraceful and irrelevant farces interspersed through the productions. =Secularized Passion Plays banned= With the advent of the 16th-century European religious conflict the uneasiness with liturgical drama in general increased. The Synod of Strasburg of 1549 opposed the religious plays, and the year previous, in 1548, the Parliament of Paris forbade the production of The Mysteries of the Passion of our Redeemer and other Spiritual Mysteries. One consequence was that the secularized plays were separated from the religious, and, as Carnival plays, held the public favour. The Passion Plays came to be presented more rarely, particularly as the Reformation was inimical to them. Rediscovery of the Passion Play =Decline= School dramas now came into vogue in Catholic and Protestant schools, and frequently enough became the battle-ground of religious controversies. When, in the 17th century the Jesuit drama arose, the Passion Plays (still largely secularized) were relegated to out-of-the-way villages and to the monasteries, particularly in Bavaria and Austria. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, during the Age of Enlightenment, efforts were made in Catholic Germany, particularly in Bavaria and the Tyrol, to destroy even the remnants of the tradition of medieval plays. =Revival= Public interest in the Passion Play developed in the last decades of the 19th century, and the statistician Karl Pearson wrote a book about them. Since then, Brixlegg and Vorderthiersee in Tyrol and Horice na Sumave, near Cesky Krumlov in the Czech Republic, and above all, the Oberammergau in Upper Bavaria attract thousands to their plays. The text of the play of Vorderthiersee (Gespiel in der Vorderen Thiersee) dates from the second half of the seventeenth century, is entirely in verse, and comprises in five acts the events recorded in the Gospel, from the Last Supper to the Entombment. A prelude (Vorgespiel), on the Good Shepherd, precedes the play. After being repeatedly remodelled, the text received its present classical form from the Austrian Benedictine, P. Weissenhofer. Productions of the play, which came from Bavaria to the Tyrol in the second half of the eighteenth century, were arranged at irregular intervals during the first half of the nineteenth century; since 1855 they have taken place at regular intervals, at Brixlegg every ten years. The H√∂ritz Passion Play, the present text of which is from the pen of Provost Landsteiner, has been produced every five years, since 1893. Modern performances of the Passion Play =Australia= In Australia, several major productions of The Passion are staged annually during the lead up to Easter. * The Iona Passion Play was founded in 1958 in Queensland, and tours cities and towns around Australia. In each location the touring cast invites community members to join the production. * The Moogerah Passion Play, established in 1993, is produced annually, at Easter time, in Queensland. It is staged \\"realistically\\" at The Lake Theatre, a large, purpose built, lakeside theatre designed specifically for the Moogerah Passion Play. Contemporary versions of the play endeavour to use different Bibles to convey messages to the audience every year. The Lake Theatre, Moogerah Queensland Australia * In New South Wales, at Turramurra, The Turramurra Passion is a contemporary, character-driven interpretation, using multimedia elements and an original score. * In the Riverstage botanical gardens, in Brisbane, Queensland, a new group of enthusiastic people staged a version of the Passion Play, with an original score and script written by Roy Pires, that was staged for the first time in 2007. It \\"was very successful, touching the lives of many people\\". =Bavaria= Oberammergau Theatre (2013) The chief survivor of former times is the Oberammergau Passion Play, first performed in the Bavarian village of Oberammergau in 1634 and now performed every 10 years. The next Oberammergau Passion Play was to take place in 2020 but was delayed to 2022 amid COVID-19 concerns. In 2010, about half the inhabitants of Oberammergau took part in the once-a-decade Passion Play; over 2,000 villagers brought the story of Jesus of Nazareth to life for audiences that flocked in from around the world. In accordance with tradition, the play started with Jesus entering Jerusalem, continued with his death on the cross, and finished with the Resurrection. 2010 saw a new production directed by Christian St√ºckl, director at Munich's noted Volkstheater. He was supported by the artistic team that, along with him, staged the 2000 Passion Play: deputy director and dramatic adviser Otto Huber, set and costume designer Stefan Hageneier, music director Marxus Zwink, and conductor Michael Bocklet. All four of these collaborators are from Oberammergau. The play started at 14.30 and included a three-hour interval, ending at 22.30. Performances took place between mid-May and early October 2010. =Italy= Overall view of the theatre in 2015 in Sordevolo, Italy The Passion of Christ is performed in Sordevolo (Piedmont) every five years since 1816, from June to September, by all the inhabitants of the village in an open-air amphitheatre 4.000 squared meters wide, of 2.400 seats under cover. In front of the audience is rebuilt a corner of Jerusalem. Each actor involved (about 500 people) is a volunteer, as well as who works \\"behind the scenes\\"(about 300 people) for scenography, costumes, script, horses. It is one of the greatest shows about the Passion of Christ in Italy, sacred in the topic, popular in its realization. About 40 shows are performed for each season. The next edition was planned for 2020, but was postponed to summer 2021 due to the Coronavirus pandemic (from 12 June to 26 September). =Brazil= New Jerusalem The Passion of the Christ is performed every year during Easter, in a purpose-built theatre-city in the arid backlands of Pernambuco, in northeastern Brazil. It is considered to be the largest open- air theatre in the world. Thousands of visitors arrive every year to watch the performance; over 500 actors appear on the nine separate stages within the stone walls of the New Jerusalem city-theatre. =Canada= * The Canadian Badlands Passion Play is performed annually in Drumheller, Alberta. It is staged outdoors in a naturally occurring amphitheatre in the hills of the Drumheller valley. Performers are a mix of professionals and volunteers from across Alberta and Canada, with nearly 300 actors and musicians annually. * In Hamilton, Ontario, Cardinal Newman Catholic Secondary School puts on a Passion Play annually for all the students who attend it. * In Kingston, Ontario, a full-scale Passion Play production has been traditionally performed for decades at the Kingston Gospel Temple, a Pentecostal worship center. The production features local amateur and professional talent. * In Manitoba, located in the La Riviere Valley at Oak Valley's Outdoor theatre, located on the edge of the Pembina Valley. The cast and crew are volunteers from all over southern Manitoba. Rehearsals usually start in April or early May and are ready for mid-July performances. * In Thornhill, Ontario, in what has become an annual tradition at St. Joseph the Worker Parish, over 200 parish youth and young adults annually come together to present the LIfe and Passion of Christ, the decisive event in history that gave victory to hope, love, light, and life. Every year, the StJW Parish Passion Play increases in quality and number as the bar continues to be raised. Funds raised from the Passion Play go to subsidize the StJW Youth's annual trip to the Steubenville Youth Conference. * In Queensway Cathedral (Toronto, Ontario) a Passion Play takes place during the Easter Season. For more than 20 years, the Church on the Queensway (formally Queensway Cathedral) has presented different versions of the Passion Play in their 3200-seat venue, using hundreds of volunteers, live animals, singers and dancers. The play has become a favorite, and most shows experience capacity crowds. This presentation is known for its powerful portrayal of the life of Christ, dramatic resurrection, and ascension scenes. *There is also a well-known Passion Play in Vaughan, Ontario, organized by St. Peters Parish and performed at Holy Cross Catholic Academy. =Hungary= Buda√∂rs Passion Play 2018 K≈ëhegy (Stone Mountain) Chapel at Buda√∂rs was built by Franz Wendler to whom Virgin Mary had appeared in a dream. He supposedly dreamt of a dog rose on Stone Mountain, every flower of which bore the face of Mary. On the petals he read: \\"I am the Immaculate Conception\\". In spring 1855, Wendler started construction. On 15 October 1855, the chapel was consecrated to Mary's Immaculate Conception. Franz Wendler lived in a cave next to the chapel from 1878 until his death. The chapel is one of the most important pilgrimage places for Germans of Hungary in the area of Buda. Every three years, Buda√∂rs‚Äô inhabitants stage a passion play with Hungarian and German text. Alan Fenech interpreting Jesus Christ in Il-Mixja =Malta= The island nation of Malta features many Passion Plays, put on by provincial club, societies, and theatres in various localities. Each village and town often hosts several plays, and there is some competition among the troupes to put on the most moving or beautiful display. These are often combined with processions and wirjiet (\\"exhibitions\\") that feature models and renditions of the Passion. Since 2007, a Passion Play entitled Il-Mixja,Il-Mixja with Jesus being played by popular Maltese actor Alan Fenech and featuring some of the most highly acclaimed actors in Malta, has become one of the highlights of the genre on the island with the audience experiencing the passion of Jesus Christ as if they were present on the streets of Jerusalem during those historical two days. The play is held outdoors and has so far been held four times in the streets of Rabat, once at ƒ¶aƒ°ar Qim temples and four times (2013‚Äì2016) for charity on the grounds surrounding Mount Carmel Hospital. In 2017 the event was held at the presidential Verdala palace in aid of the Malta Community Chest Fund. In 2018 it was held both at Verdala Palace and on the grounds surrounding Mount Carmel Hospital whereas in 2019 the production once again changed location to the Romeo Gardens in Santa Venera with once again the Malta Community Chest Fund Foundation and the service users of Mount Carmel Hospital being the beneficiaries of this charity event.Official website =The Netherlands= *De Passiespelen is a re-enactment of the Passion of the Christ taking place every year that is divisible by 5, e.g., in 2005 and 2010. It is performed in the open air in Openluchttheater De Doolhof, in Tegelen. It originated in 1931 and has become an internationally acclaimed event drawing visitors from all over the world. *Since 2011, Nederland 3 has broadcast The Passion, a live television musical that features a rendition of the story set in the present day, accompanied by popular music. Serving as a Dutch adaptation of BBC Three's special, Manchester Passion (2006), it has since been held annually in different cities, with the 2015 edition seen by approximately 3.57 million viewers. The concept has also been sold as a television format to other countries, such as Belgium and the United States. =Philippines= Actor portraying Jesus on the cross during the Pagtaltal in Barotac Viejo, Iloilo, Philippines, April 2010 The predominantly Catholic Philippines has Passion Plays called Sen√°kulo, named after the Upper room, every Semana Santa (Holy Week). Theatre companies and community groups perform different versions of the Sen√°kulo, using their own scripts that present the dialogue in either poetic or prosaic form. These scripts are decades or even centuries-old, and draw from both the Bible and folk tradition. Costumes and scenery in traditional Sen√°kulo conform to Hispanic iconography instead of actual historical realism, which is more common with recent productions (particularly by professional companies). Some productions use ropes to hold actors on crosses while others use actual nails. One of the more popular Sen√°kulo is Ang Pagtaltal in Jordan, Guimaras, which began in 1975 and draws some 150,000 visitors annually. Some people perform crucifixions outside of Passion Plays to fulfill a panat√† (vow for a request or prayer granted), such as the famous penitents in Barangay San Pedro Cutud, San Fernando, Pampanga. =Poland= Tradition of Passion Plays in Poland has become popular again in the early 20th century. Today the best known plays take place in Ka≈Çk√≥w, Kalwaria Pac≈Çawska, the Pallotines' Seminary in O≈Çtarzew, and the most prominent in Sanctuary of Kalwaria Zebrzydowska. This Passion Play is one of the oldest. *Since 1998, there has been a yearly Passion Play in Poznan, performed on Palm Sunday in open air of Cytadela City Park. Now it is the biggest performance of this kind in Europe. In 2009, 100,000 pilgrims were expected to attend. =Slovenia= In the 17th and 18th century, Passion Plays were organised in the towns of the Slovene Lands, like Kranj, Ljubljana, and Novo Mesto. Their language was German, Slovene, or both. They were all based on the tradition of the Ljubljana Passion Play, which was organised by Capuchins and first performed from ca. 1608 until ca. 1613. The most distinguished of them has been the ≈†kofja Loka Passion Play. It was written by Father Romuald in 1715, with modifications until 1727, on the basis of an older tradition. It is the oldest preserved play in Slovene as well as the oldest preserved director's book in Europe and the only one extant from the Baroque period. The ≈†kofja Loka Passion Play was performed each year until 1767. The procession was revived in 1999, and reprised in 2000 and 2009, with further reprisals planned for 2015 and 2021. The play's reprisals are the largest open-air theatre production in Slovenia. =Spain= 'Drama de la Cruz', Monte Calvario, Alcorisa. Part of Ruta del Tambor y el Bombo. In Catalonia, it is common for villages to present different Passion Plays every Easter, like the ones in Esparreguera, Olesa de Montserrat, Ulldecona or Cervera, first documented in 1538. Olesa's 1996 production surpassed the world record for the most people acting on stage at the same time, with 726 persons. Balmaseda, in the Spanish Basque Country, holds the leading Passion Play in the region. =Sri Lanka= The earliest Passion Plays in Sri Lanka, at Vanny in Mannar, Pesalai, Pamanugama, Mutuwal, Pallansena, Kalamulla, Duwa and Pitipana in Negombo, used life-size statues instead of living actors.

They depict the events of Jesus Christ's trial, death and resurrection and may also extend to the events of his life, works and miracles. Today they are performed at Easter and often take place in public spaces such as city centres and town squares as free, community-led performances. Popular biblical dramas of the Middle Ages - including liturgical drama, Passion Plays and the Corpus Christi cycles or Mystery Play - are the originators of modern Passion Plays. The Mystery Plays were epic play cycles were large-scale productions financed and produced by medieval guilds for the glory of God and the honour of their city. The most well-known took place in York, Coventry and Chester. This dramatic heritage is acknowledged by modern Passion Plays. The similarities between these community-led, Bible focussed plays from the Middle Ages and contemporary Mystery Plays and Passion Plays are recognised by artists involved in the plays, journalists and academic. ;Aberdeen * The Aberdeen Passion is staged biennially in the North East of Scotland.

Its 2014 production attracted national attention because it was cancelled at the last moment. City Council Licensing officials refused to let it proceed without a fully debated decision, having presumed the motive for notifying that authority regarding the 'Passion Play' would be that the play must, supported by its title, be a sex-related production necessitating full permission under the 2003 Act rather than the producers enquiring if the council would share the widespread view it fell within the meaning of \\"The provision of any entertainment or entertainment facilities for the purposes of, or for purposes incidental to, a religious meeting or service\\" following licensing deregulation by the Licensing Act 2003. ;Poole * The town of Poole stages the play viewed Through the Eyes of a Child every two years known as Poole Community Passion Play (PCPP).

Antisemitism in Passion plays Many Passion Plays historically blamed the Jews for the death of Jesus in a polemical fashion, depicting a crowd of Jewish people condemning Jesus to crucifixion and a Jewish leader assuming eternal collective guilt for the crowd for the murder of Jesus, which, The Boston Globe explains, \\"for centuries prompted vicious attacks ‚Äì or pogroms ‚Äì on Europe's Jewish communities\\".Sennott, Charles M. \\"In Poland, new 'Passion' plays on old hatreds\\", The Boston Globe, 10 April 2004. Time magazine in its article, The Problem With Passion, explains that \\"such passages (are) highly subject to interpretation\\".Van Biema, David. \\"The Problem With Passion\\", Time Magazine, 25 August 2003. Although modern scholars interpret the \\"blood on our children\\" () as \\"a specific group's oath of responsibility\\" some audiences have historically interpreted it as \\"an assumption of eternal, racial guilt\\". This last interpretation has often incited violence against Jews; according to the Anti- Defamation League, \\"Passion plays historically unleashed the torrents of hatred aimed at the Jews, who always were depicted as being in partnership with the devil and the reason for Jesus' death\\".Foxman, Abraham H. \\"'Passion' Relies on Theme of antisemitism\\" , The Palm Beach Post, 25 January 2004. The Christian Science Monitor, in its article, Capturing the Passion, explains that \\"historically, productions have reflected negative images of Jews and the long-time church teaching that the Jewish people were collectively responsible for Jesus' death. Violence against Jews as 'Christ-killers' often flared in their wake.\\"Lampman, Jane. \\"Capturing the Passion\\", Christian Science Monitor, 10 July 2003. Christianity Today in Why some Jews fear The Passion (of the Christ) observed that \\"Outbreaks of Christian antisemitism related to the Passion narrative have been...numerous and destructive.\\"Hansen, Colin. \\"Why some Jews fear The Passion\\", Christianity Today, 2004. Some of the oldest currently-running passion plays have had to reckon with past polemic portrayals of Jews in the work. The Oberammergau Passion Play is an especially notable example. First performed in 1634, the play continues to run today. In its original incarnation, the play relied upon the Antisemitic canard that Jews bore greater responsibility than any other group in the killing of Christ. It utilizes juxtaposition between pure Christians and wicked Jews in order to portray a greater battle between fundamental good versus evil. Following the events of World War II and the explicit support of Adolf Hitler for the play, several reforms and modifications were made. While Oberammergau is perhaps the most famous example, this was not the only instance of Anti- Semitism or Anti-Semitic rhetoric in a Passion Play. The Towneley Mystery Plays, also known as the Wakefield Mystery Plays, also featured Anti-Semitic imagery, and ran from the late Middle Ages until 1578. It is believed to be one of the earliest and most explicit portrayals of Pontius Pilate as a king or a Jew (and sometimes as king of the Jews) in theater (although this tradition had already become well-established in paintings and other visual media by this point). Through these stylings, the Jews are further implicated in the killing of Christ as being both the judge and the jury. This consistent rendering was emulated throughout Christendom in the Middle Ages, and is perpetuated in subtler forms even today. The Religion Newswriters Association observed that > \\"in Easter 2001, three incidents made national headlines and renewed [Jewish > and Christian leaders'] fears. One was a column by Paul Weyrich, a > conservative Christian leader and head of the Free Congress Foundation, who > argued that \\"Christ was crucified by the Jews.\\" Another was sparked by > comments from the NBA point guard and born-again Christian Charlie Ward, who > said in an interview that Jews were persecuting Christians and that Jews > \\"had his [Jesus'] blood on their hands.\\" Finally, the evangelical Christian > comic strip artist Johnny Hart published a B.C. strip that showed a menorah > disintegrating until it became a cross, with each panel featuring the last > words of Jesus, including \\"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they > do\\".\\"'Passion' plays out locally\\" February 17, 2004 On 16 November 1998, Church Council of Evangelical Lutheran Church in America similarly adopted a resolution prepared by its Consultative Panel on Lutheran- Jewish Relations urging any Lutheran church presenting a Passion Play to adhere to their Guidelines for Lutheran-Jewish Relations, stating that \\"the New Testament . . . must not be used as justification for hostility towards present-day Jews,\\" and that \\"blame for the death of Jesus should not be attributed to Judaism or the Jewish people.\\"Evangelical Lutheran Church in America \\"Guidelines for Lutheran-Jewish Relations\\" 16 November 1998World Council of Churches \\"Guidelines for Lutheran-Jewish Relations\\" in Current Dialogue, Issue 33 July 1999 In 2003 and 2004 some people compared Mel Gibson's film The Passion of the Christ to these kinds of Passion Plays, but this characterization is hotly disputed; an analysis of that topic is in the article on The Passion of the Christ.

Established in 1982, this umbrella organisation draws together Passion Play communities from countries all over Europe, some of which have been performing their plays for hundreds of years. According to Mons. Fausto Panfili, the Chaplain of the Europassion: \\"The experience of the Europassion constantly lets us experience a so far unexplored pathway, so that we can continue to grow.

It also produces new work that tour nationally and internationally, in addition to presenting the discussion forum, First Thought Talks. GIAF is managed by John Crumlish, acting as Chief Executive, and Paul Fahy as Artistic Director. The festival maintains non-profit status and insists that at least 25% of the festival programme is free for the public.  About  The festival is one of Ireland's leading cultural enterprises, and has contributed significantly to putting Galway on the map, as both a key cultural centre for the arts and a cultural tourism destination. It has also founded and acted as a seedbed for a number of other arts organisations in Galway. Originally The Galway Arts Festival, the organisation was founded in 1978 by University College Galway's Arts Society in collaboration with community activists of Galway Arts Group. The first festival was described in local papers as \\"Galway Arts Society's Week of Craic\\". Their original budget was ‚Ç¨1000 of Arts Council Funding and most of the artistic events were staged in an arts centre that now homes Sheridan's Cheesemongers. The name was changed in 2014, to Galway International Arts Festival, to emphasize the diversity of contributors to the festival. \\"The festival presents and produces work in Galway which sits side by side with the work of artists and companies from around the world,\\" Artistic Director Paul Fahy explained. \\"Both are local and global; both are international.\\" The name change also facilitated the vision of the festival as a producing body, creating works that tour internationally.  Festival  The festival takes place in Galway, Ireland for two weeks in late July. It presents and produces programmes across theatre, music, visual arts, opera, street spectacle, dance, discussion and comedy. The 2018 festival set records for attendance, breaking a quarter million for the first time, representing a 20% increase over the participants in the 2017 festival. Over 600 artists created and took part in over 200 events across the festival. This 41st festival also featured a new Festival Garden in Eyre Square, offering pop-up performances and local food stands. The Festival Garden attracted more than 145,000 people. Visitors to the 2017 festival were estimated to be 45% from Galway, 18% around the rest of Ireland, and 37% outside of Ireland.  Touring  In the last seven years, the organization has produced or co-produced 23 productions and has toured to London, New York, Edinburgh, Chicago, Adelaide, Sydney, Hong Kong and Washington. These include 4 exhibition commissions. GIAF has also fostered a relationship with Landmark Productions, a Dublin-based production company. Together they have produced multiple works written by or directed by Irish playwright Enda Walsh that have toured internationally. Music View of the Big Top at night In recent years, GIAF has hosted musical guests in their Big Top tent, erected yearly in the Fisheries Field on the campus of NUI Galway. GIAF also partner with local music and comedy venue R√≥is√≠n Dubh for some of their programmed events. Performances in the music programme have included: Elvis Costello, Suede, The National, St. Vincent, Philip Glass, David Byrne, Blondie, Kronos Quartet, Brodsky Quartet and Bon Iver. Visual arts From inside Architects of Air's walk-in sculpture 'Miracoco Luminarium,' designed by Alan Parkinson and on display in Eyre Square during the 2018 festival. Visual artists who have exhibited have included David Hockney, Bill Viola, Henri Matisse, Patricia Piccinini, Hughie O'Donoghue, David Mach and John Gerrard. In 2018, GIAF announced a new Internship programme in the visual arts to train 25 participants to be able to engage with patrons in the galleries in an in-depth way. Theatre and dance Irish playwright Enda Walsh has featured in past GIAF line-ups. His first play, \\"Disco Pigs\\", which was also Cillian Murphy's first stage role, debuted in the 1997 festival. Walsh has since gone on to work with the festival to also produce works ranging from operas to experimental staged 'Rooms.' His 2014 Ballyturk won Best Production at the Irish Times Theatre Awards and his 2011 Misterman toured to New York City and was the New York Times Critics' Choice for eighteen days in a row. American actor John Mahoney was a frequent performer in the festival starting in 2000 and is said to have considered Galway one of his favorite places in the world. Visiting international theatre and dance companies have included the National Theatre, Propeller, The Royal Court, Steppenwolf, Fabulous Beast Dance Company, Hofesh Shechter Dance Company, Michael Clark Company, Druid Theatre Company and the Bristol Old Vic. First Thought Talks Starting in 2012, GIAF hosted a series of talks each festival that revolve around a theme. The 2018 festival's First Thought Talks about 'Home' was opened by President Michael D. Higgins and followed up by 43 other scholars, artists, scientists, and athletes, both Irish and International. The majority of these talks are recorded and can be accessed online. They are also live-streamed on Facebook.

Honour (British English) or honor (American English; see spelling differences) is the idea of a bond between an individual and a society as a quality of a person that is both of social teaching and of personal ethos, that manifests itself as a code of conduct, and has various elements such as valour, chivalry, honesty, and compassion. It is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or institution such as a family, school, regiment or nation. Accordingly, individuals (or institutions) are assigned worth and stature based on the harmony of their actions with a specific code of honour, and the moral code of the society at large. Samuel Johnson, in his A Dictionary of the English Language (1755), defined honour as having several senses, the first of which was \\"nobility of soul, magnanimity, and a scorn of meanness\\". This sort of honour derives from the perceived virtuous conduct and personal integrity of the person endowed with it. On the other hand, Johnson also defined honour in relationship to \\"reputation\\" and \\"fame\\"; to \\"privileges of rank or birth\\", and as \\"respect\\" of the kind which \\"places an individual socially and determines his right to precedence\\". This sort of honour is often not so much a function of moral or ethical excellence, as it is a consequence of power. Finally, with respect to sexuality, honour has traditionally been associated with (or identical to) \\"chastity\\" or \\"virginity\\", or in case of married men and women, \\"fidelity\\". Some have argued that honour should be seen more as a rhetoric, or set of possible actions, than as a code.  Social context  Wall of Honour, Royal Military College of Canada Honour as a code of behaviour defines the duties of an individual within a social group. Margaret Visser observes that in an honour-based society \\"a person is what he or she is in the eyes of other people\\". A code of honour differs from a legal code, also socially defined and concerned with justice, in that honour remains implicit rather than explicit and objectified. One can distinguish honour from dignity, which Wordsworth assessed as measured against an individual's conscience \\"...dignity abides with him alone / Who, in the silent hour of inward thought, / Can still suspect, and still revere himself....\\" William Wordsworth, \\"Yew Tree\\" http://www.bartleby.com/145/ww119.html. rather than against the judgement of a community. Compare also the sociological concept of \\"face\\". In the early medieval period, a lord's or lady's honour was the group of manors or lands he or she held. \\"The word was first used indicating an estate which gave its holder dignity and status.\\"A Dictionary of Medieval Terms and Phrases, Christopher Cor√©don, 2004, D.S. Brewer, Cambridge, For a person to say \\"on my honour\\" was not just an affirmation of his or her integrity and rank, but the veracity behind that phrase meant he or she was willing to offer up estates as pledge and guarantee. The concept of honour appears to have declined in importance in the modern West; conscience has replaced it in the individual context, and the rule of law (with the rights and duties defined therein) has taken over in a social context. Popular stereotypes would have it surviving more definitively in more tradition-bound cultures (e.g. Pashtun, Southern Italian, Polish, Persian, Turkish, Arab, Iberian, \\"Old South\\" or Dixie) in a perception akin to Orientalism. Feudal or other agrarian societies, which focus upon land use and land ownership, may tend to \\"honour\\" more than do contemporary industrial societies. Note that Saint Anselm of Canterbury (c. 1033 ‚Äì 1109) in Cur Deus Homo extended the concept of honour from his own feudal society to postulate God's honour. An emphasis on the importance of honour exists in such traditional institutions as the military (serving officers may conduct a court of honour) and in organisations with a military ethos, such as Scouting organisations (which also feature \\"Courts of Honour\\" ). Honour in the case of sexuality frequently relates, historically, to fidelity: preservation of \\"honour\\" equates primarily to maintenance of the virginity of singles and to the exclusive monogamy of the remainder of the population. Further conceptions of this type of honour vary widely between cultures; some cultures regard honour killings of (mostly female) members of one's own family as justified if the individuals have \\"defiled the family's honour\\" by marrying against the family's wishes, or even by becoming the victims of rape. Western observers generally see these honour killings as a way of men using the culture of honour to control female sexuality. Skinners, executioners, grave-diggers, shepherds, barber-surgeons, millers, linen-weavers, sow-gelders, latrine-cleaners, and bailiffs and their families were among the \\"dishonourable people\\" (unehrliche Leute) in early modern German society.Defiled Trades and Social Outcasts ‚Äì Honor and Ritual Pollution in Early Modern Germany , Cambridge University Press, 2000  Cultures of honour and cultures of law  Various sociologists and anthropologists have contrasted cultures of honour with cultures of law. A culture of law has a body of laws which all members of society must obey, with punishments for transgressors. This requires a society with the structures required to enact and enforce laws. A culture of law incorporates a social contract: members of society give up some aspects of their freedom to defend themselves and retaliate for injuries, on the understanding that society will apprehend and punish transgressors. An alternative to government enforcement of laws is community or individual enforcement of social norms. One way that honour functions is as a major factor of reputation. In a system where there is no court that will authorise the use of force to guarantee the execution of contracts, an honourable reputation is very valuable to promote trust among transaction partners. To dishonour an agreement could be economically ruinous, because all future potential transaction partners might stop trusting the party not to lie, steal their money or goods, not repay debts, mistreat the children they marry off, have children with other people, abandon their children, or fail to provide aid when needed. A dishonourable person might be shunned by the community as a way to punish bad behaviour and create an incentive for others to maintain their honour. If one's honour is questioned, it can thus be important to disprove any false accusations or slander. In some cultures, the practice of dueling has arisen as a means to settle such disputes firmly, though by physical dominance in force or skill rather than by objective consideration of evidence and facts. Honour can also imply duty to perform certain actions, such as providing for and disciplining one's children, serving in the military during war, contributing to local collective projects like building infrastructure, or exacting revenge in retaliation for acts one is directly harmed by. The concept of personal honour can be extended to family honour, which strengthens the incentives to follow social norms in two ways. First, the consequences of dishonourable actions (such as suicide or attempted robbery that results in death) outlive the perpetrator, and negatively affect family members they presumably care about. Second, when one member of the family misbehaves, other members of the family are in the position to and are incentivised to strongly enforce the community norms. In strong honour cultures, those who do not conform may be forced or pressured into conformance and transgressors punished physically or psychologically. The use of violence may be collective in its character, where many relatives act together. The most extreme form of punishment is honour killing. Dueling and vengeance at a family level can result in a sustained feud. Honour-based cultures are also known as honour-shame cultures and are contrasted with guilt cultures on the guilt-shame-fear spectrum of cultures. Cultures of honour are often conservative, encoding pre-modern traditional family values and duties. In some cases these values clash with those of post-sexual revolution and egalitarian societies. Add to this the prohibition against vigilante or individual justice-taking, cultures of law sometimes consider practices in honour cultures to be unethical or a violation of the legal concept of human rights. Examples around the world Historians have especially examined the culture of honour in the American South.Bertram. Wyatt-Brown, Southern honor: Ethics and behavior in the Old South (Oxford University Press, 2007)Kenneth S. Greenberg, Honor & Slavery: Lies, Duels, Noses, Masks, Dressing as a Woman, Gifts, Strangers, Humanitarianism, Death, Slave Rebellions, the Proslavery Argument, Baseball, Hunting, and Gambling in the Old South (Princeton University Press, 1996) Social scientists have looked at specialised subcultures such as South Asian Muslims in Britain.Pnina Werbner, \\"Honor, shame and the politics of sexual embodiment among South Asian Muslims in Britain and beyond: An analysis of debates in the public sphere.\\" International Social Science Review 6#1 (2005): 25‚Äì47. Others have compared multiple modern nations.Klaus Helkama, et al. \\"Honor as a value in Finland, Estonia, Italy, Russia, and Switzerland.\\" Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 16#3 (2013): 279‚Äì297. One paper finds that present-day Canadians born in communities that historically lay outside the reach of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Mounties) seem to inherit a violent code of honour that drives their behaviour. From the viewpoint of anthropologists, cultures of honour typically appear among nomadic peoples and among herdsmen who carry their most valuable property with them and risk having it stolen, without having recourse to law enforcement or to government. Due to the lack of strong institutions, cultivating a reputation for swift and disproportionate revenge increases the safety of one's person and property against aggressive actors. Thinkers ranging from Montesquieu to Steven Pinker have remarked upon the mindset needed for a culture of honour. According to Richard Nisbett, cultures of honour will often arise when three conditions Richard Nisbett. Culture of Honor. 1996. exist: # a scarcity of resources # situations in which the benefit of theft and crime outweighs the risks # a lack of sufficient law- enforcement (such as in geographically remote regions) Historically, cultures of honour exist in places where the herding of animals dominates an economy. In this situation the geography is usually extensive, since the soil cannot support extensive sustained farming and thus large populations; the benefit of stealing animals from other herds is high since it is the main form of wealth; and there is no central law-enforcement or rule of law. However cultures of honour can also appear in places like modern inner-city slums. The three conditions exist here as well: lack of resources (poverty); crime and theft have a high rewards compared to the alternatives (few); and law enforcement is generally lax or corrupt. Once a culture of honour exists in a society, its members find it difficult to make the transition to a culture of law; this requires that people become willing to back down and refuse to immediately retaliate, and from the viewpoint of the culture of honour, the feeling humiliation makes personal restraint extremely difficult as it reflects weakness and appeasement. Honour as a cause of war  =The War of 1812= Historian Norman Risjord has emphasised the central importance of honour as a cause of the War of 1812, which the United States launched in against Britain despite its much more powerful naval and military strength. Americans of every political stripe saw the need to uphold national honour, and to reject the treatment of the United States by Britain as a third class nonentity. Americans talked incessantly about the need for force in response. This quest for honour was a major cause of the war in the sense that most Americans who were not involved in mercantile interests or threatened by Indian attack strongly endorsed the preservation of national honour.Bradford Perkins, The causes of the War of 1812: National honor or national interest? (1962). The humiliating attack by HMS Leopard against USS Chesapeake in June 1807 was a decisive event.Spencer Tucker, Injured Honor: The Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, June 22, 1807 (Naval Institute Press, 1996) Historians have documented the importance of honour in shaping public opinion in a number of states, including Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania,Victor Sapio, Pennsylvania and the War of 1812 (University Press of Kentucky, 2015)Martin Kaufman, \\"War Sentiment in Western Pennsylvania: 1812.\\" Pennsylvania History (1964): 436‚Äì448. and Tennessee, as well as the territory of Michigan. The successful conclusion of the war, especially the spectacular defeat of the main British invasion army at New Orleans, did restore the American sense of honour. :National honor, the reputation of republican government, and the continuing supremacy of the Republican party had seemed to be at stake ... National honor had [now] been satisfied,\\" says historian Lance Banning, \\"Americans celebrated the end of the struggle with a brilliant burst of national pride. The British showed a respect for American honour. \\"Some of the strongest praise for America and swiftest recognition of what the young republic had achieved for American honor, prestige, and power came from within British naval circles.\\" Britain refrained from interfering with American maritime interests and ceased with the impressment of American citizens following the war. = U.S. Presidents raised in honour cultures = : leftThis section is a stub. You can help by [ adding to it]. A 2016 study suggests that honour culture increases the risk of war. The study found that international conflicts under U.S. presidents who were raised in the American South \\"are shown to be twice as likely to involve uses of force, last on average twice as long, and are three times more likely to end in victory for the United States than disputes under non-Southern presidents. Other characteristics of Southern presidencies do not seem able to account for this pattern of results.\\" Violence against women : leftThis section is a stub. You can help by [ adding to it]. Working towards eliminating violence against women in the name of honour was the aim of United Nations resolution 55/66 in 2001 which was adopted by the General Assembly.  Related concepts  General Akashi Gidayu preparing to commit seppuku after losing a battle for his master. He had just written his death poem. In contemporary international relations, the concept of \\"credibility\\" resembles that of honour, as when the credibility of a state or of an alliance appears to be at stake, and honour-bound politicians call for drastic measures. Compare the concepts of integrity and face in stereotyped East Asian cultures, or of mana in Polynesian society. The ancient Greek concepts of honour (timƒì) included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honour, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris. This concept of honour resembles a zero-sum game. In ancient China during the Warring States period, honour in battle was one of the many forms of virtue practised by the nobility. In one oft-cited example, Duke Xiang of the Song state chose not to take the enemy by surprise; instead, he and his forces waited for the enemy to go across the river. This marked conduct worthy of the accolade descriptor ren (‰ªÅ), worthy of the name of \\"gentleman\\". In response to this textbook example, Mao Zedong is quoted: \\"We are not Duke Xiang of Song and have no use for his idiotic virtue and morality.\\" Pre-modern Korean thought and society was largely dominated by the preservation of honour and was especially concerned with the ruling yangban elite in the Joseon dynasty. In particular, one of the most profound influences from the Joseon Dynasty is the figure of the Seonbi, or \\"virtuous scholar\\". The seonbi were ideal, exemplary noblemen of Confucian teachings who exhibited high competency in both academics and martial arts. Despite their obvious qualifications for important government posts, the seonbi eschewed titles and extravagance for the sake of personal development, often living in humble homes. They were expected to be fiercely loyal to the King of Joseon and lay down their lives in battle or in defence of their King, rather than choose treason. Inspired by the righteous nature of the seonbi, the modern Korean term of the \\"seonbi spirit\\" calls for maintaining personal honour and conduct, even in the face of certain death. According to Bushido, honour was always seen as a duty by Samurai. When one lost their honour or the situation made them lose it, the only way to save their dignity was by death. Seppuku (vulgarly called \\"harakiri\\", or \\"belly-cutting\\") was the most honourable death in that situation. The only way for a Samurai to die more honourably was to be killed in a battle by a sword. Honour belief is in the popular adage ‚ÄòTrue patience means bearing the unbearable.‚Äô  See also  * Chivalry * Code duello * Dignitas (Roman concept) * Ethos * Feud * Honorary degree * Honour system * Izzat (Honor) * Moka exchange * Omert√† * Order (distinction) * Pashtunwali * Personal rights * Personality rights * Potlatch * The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum * Youxia Notes  References  *Bowman, James.

He was convicted of war crimes and sentenced to life imprisonment.  Early life  Hiranuma was born in what is now Tsuyama City, Okayama Prefecture, as the son of a low-ranking samurai from the Tsuyama Domain of Mimasaka Province. He graduated with a degree in English law from Tokyo Imperial University in 1888. After graduation, he obtained a posting in the Ministry of Justice. In 1911 he was the prosecutor for the High Treason Incident, (the 1910 socialist-anarchist plot to assassinate the Japanese Emperor Meiji). This was a closed court trial of 25 men and 1 woman, including 4 Buddhist monks, which resulted in the execution of 12, including the feminist author, Kanno Suga.  At the Ministry of Justice  Hiranuma established a reputation during his time at the Ministry of Justice as a strong opponent of government corruption, successfully handling a number of high-profile cases. He served as the director of the Tokyo High Court, public prosecutor of the Supreme Court, and Director of the Civil and Criminal Affairs Bureau. In 1909, he secured the conviction of 25 former and serving members of the Diet of Japan for accepting bribes from the Japan Sugar Company. He rose to become Vice Minister of Justice in 1911, and Public Prosecutor-general in 1912. In 1915, he forced Home Minister ≈åura Kanetake in the cabinet of Prime Minister ≈åkuma Shigenobu to resign due to suspected bribery. Hiranuma was highly outspoken against the corruption and immorality in Japan's political parties, and this attitude soon expanded to include what he perceived to be threatening foreign influences, such as socialism and liberal democracy. With Sadao Araki, Hiranuma created the Kokuhonsha group, as well as participating in other nationalist groups. In 1921, Hiranuma became chief of the Supreme Court of Japan. Hiranuma became Minister of Justice under the second Yamamoto administration from September 1923 to January 1924. While Minister, he promoted the creation of the Tokk≈ç to combat communism, socialism, and the spread of what he considered subversive ideologies. In 1924, he became chairman of the House of Peers and was also appointed to the Privy Council. In 1926, he was elevated to the title of danshaku (baron) under the kazoku peerage system.  Privy Councilor  Hiranuma served on the Privy Council for over 10 years, exerting considerable behind-the-scenes influence. He was strongly opposed to Prime Minister Wakatsuki Reijir≈ç's efforts at economic reform. He was also strongly opposed to the ratification of the London Naval Treaty of 1930. In 1931, he rallied support within the government for the Imperial Japanese Army after the army seized control of Manchuria without prior authorization, and later helped in the creation of Manchukuo. He also pushed for Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. In 1934, he directed the prosecution during the Teijin Incident, bringing down the administration of Prime Minister Sait≈ç Makoto. In 1936, Hiranuma was appointed President of the Privy Council.  Prime minister  Hiranuma Cabinet Hiranuma was appointed Prime Minister of Japan from 5 January 1939 to 30 August 1939. As Prime Minister, his administration was dominated by the debate on whether or not Japan should ally itself with Germany in order to neutralize the threat posed to Japan by the Soviet Union. Hiranuma wanted an anti-communist pact, but feared that a military alliance would commit Japan to war against the United States and Great Britain at a time when the bulk of its armed forces were committed to the Second Sino-Japanese War. With the signing of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact in August 1939, Hiranuma's cabinet resigned over this foreign policy issue and over the massive defeat of the Japanese Army in Mongolia during the Nomonhan Incident against the Soviet Union.  Home Minister  Hiranuma returned to the government after his resignation as Prime Minister, accepting the post of Home Minister in the second Konoe Fumimaro administration from 21 December 1940 to 18 July 1941. As Home Minister, he was a staunch defender of State Shintoism. Hiranuma declared: \\"We should research the ancient rites in detail and consider their application in administrative affairs in general and the common life of the nation\\". However, Hiranuma was strongly opposed to the political and diplomatic actions of Foreign Minister Y≈çsuke Matsuoka, and the Tripartite Pact between Imperial Japan, Nazi Germany, and Fascist Italy in 1940. He withdrew from the government on the resignation of Prime Minister Konoe in October 1941. As jushin Hiranuma served as one of the jushin (ÈáçËá£), or unofficial senior advisors, to Emperor Hirohito during World War II. Hiranuma saw the jushin as the core of a new group of genr≈ç advisors, as the last surviving Meiji period genr≈ç, Prince Saionji Kinmochi, had died in November 1940. The new group included former Prime Ministers Mitsumasa Yonai, Nobuyuki Abe and Fumimaro Konoe, all of whom supported Japan's aggressive foreign policy and the right- socialist ideals of Kingoro Hashimoto on creation of a Military Shogunate that would manage the Imperial affairs directly. In April 1945, Hiranuma was again appointed President of the Privy Council. Prosecution and conviction After the war, he was arrested by the American Occupation Authorities and was convicted by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East as a Class A War Criminal, and given a life sentence. However, he was paroled in early 1952, and died shortly afterwards. His grave is at Tama Cemetery, outside of Tokyo.  References  * Bix, Herbert P. Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan.

He rose to the rank of captain in December 1920 and was subsequently sent as naval attach√© to Poland from 1921 to 1922. Commander as Chief of the Combined Fleet, 1936 On his return to Japan, he was captain of the cruisers (1922‚Äì1923) and (1923‚Äì1924), and battleships (in 1924) and (1924‚Äì1925). Yonai was promoted to rear admiral on December 1, 1925. He became Chief of the 3rd Section of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff in December 1926. Within the Navy General Staff, he served on the Technical Council of the Navy Technical Department. He was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the First Expeditionary Fleet, sent to the Yangtze River in China in December 1928. Following the success of this mission, he was promoted to vice-admiral in December 1930 and placed in command of the Chinkai Guard District, in Korea. Yonai was given command of the IJN 3rd Fleet in December 1932, following which he again commanded the Sasebo Naval District (November 1933), IJN 2nd Fleet (November 1934) and Yokosuka Naval District (December 1935) before receiving appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet and concurrently the IJN 1st Fleet in December 1936. While in command at Sasebo, the Japanese Navy was shaken by the Tomozuru Incident, when it was determined that the basic design of the s was flawed, thus calling into question the basic designs of many of the warships in the Japanese navy. While in command at Yokosuka, the February 26 Incident erupted in Tokyo. Yonai was visiting his mistress in Shinbashi the night the attempted coup d'√©tat began, only a couple of blocks away, but knew nothing of the situation until he returned to base the following morning. Naval Minister Yonai became full admiral in April 1937 and Navy Minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Senj≈´r≈ç Hayashi in 1937. He served in the same position under the subsequent first Fumimaro Konoe and Kiichir≈ç Hiranuma administrations, through August 1939. After Nobuyuki Abe became Prime Minister, Yonai remained on the Supreme War Council. While Navy Minister, Yonai was known as a man of few words. His speeches tended to be short, and were delivered in his almost indecipherable Nambu accent. Written records of his speeches are only about half the length of his contemporaries. As Navy Minister, Yonai was alarmed by the growing tension between Japan and Great Britain and the United States, at a time when the bulk of the Imperial Japanese Army was tied down in an apparently unending quagmire in China. His efforts to promote peace made him unpopular with ultranationalist extremists, and (as with Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto) he was the target of several assassination attempts. However, Yonai supported the construction of the s in an effort to maintain a military balance with the world's other two naval superpowers.  Prime Minister of Japan  House plenary session in February 1940. Yonai was appointed Prime Minister of Japan from January 6, 1940, largely with the backing of Emperor Hirohito. As Prime Minister, he continued the strong pro-British, pro-American stance he held as Navy Minister and continued his strong opposition to the Tripartite Pact with Nazi Germany and fascist Italy. Following the German occupation of the Low Countries and France in May‚ÄìJune 1940, the Imperial Japanese Army began to show dissatisfaction with Yonai's anti German policy. The disagreement became apparent in early July 1940, as Army Minister Shunroku Hata began to criticize the Prime Minister openly.The Ambassador in Japan (Grew) to the Secretary of State, July 17, 1940, Foreign Relations of the United States, 1940, vol. IV, p. 964 When Hata resigned, Yonai was subsequently forced to resign on July 21, 1940. The Japanese Constitution required the Army Minister to be an active-duty general and no other general would accept the position, due to the pro-Axis stance of the Imperial Japanese Army.\\"Japanese Destroyer Captain, Tameichi Hara, Naval Institute Press, Chapter 12 The Tripartite Pact was signed on September 27, 1940. Subsequent political activity Yonai served as Deputy Prime Minister and concurrently as Navy Minister again under the cabinet of Prime Minister Kuniaki Koiso from July 22, 1944, during which time he returned to the active duty roster from the reserve list. By this time, Saipan had fallen to the Allies. Yonai remained Navy Minister under the administration of Prime Minister Kantar≈ç Suzuki. In the last few weeks before Japan's surrender, he sided with Prime Minister Suzuki and Foreign Minister Shigenori T≈çg≈ç in support of acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration in opposition to Army Minister Korechika Anami, Chief of Naval General Staff Admiral Soemu Toyoda and Chief of the Army General Staff General Yoshijir≈ç Umezu. Yonai remained Navy Minister in the cabinets of Prime Minister HIH Higashikuni Naruhiko and Prime Minister Kij≈´r≈ç Shidehara from August 1945, during which time he presided over the final dissolution of the Imperial Japanese Navy. He played a major role during the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in working with the major defendants, such as Hideki T≈çj≈ç, to coordinate their testimonies so that Emperor Hirohito would be spared from indictment. According to his interpreter Suichi Mizota, in March 1946 Bonner Fellers asked him to make T≈çj≈ç bear all responsibility for the Greater East Asia War Herbert Bix, Hirohito and the making of modern Japan, Perennial, 2001, p.584. After the war, Yonai devoted the rest of his life to help to rebuild Japan. Yonai suffered from high blood pressure most of his life, but died of pneumonia in 1948 at the age of 68. His grave is located at the temple of Enko-ji in his hometown of Morioka. Characteristics = Minister of the Imperial Japanese Navy (1937‚Äì1939) = Yonai was a man of few words, but people listened when he spoke. Because of his work as a military attach√© in Russia and Poland and his travels around European countries, he had a broader perspective of world affairs than many other senior Japanese military officials. In the late 1930s Yonai already analyzed the naval capabilities of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Allied countries, versus those of Germany and Italy and he concluded that Japan should not ally itself with the Axis Powers. In addition to his experience as an attach√©, he had participated in the Battle of the Japan Sea (known in the West as the Battle of Tsushima) during the Russo-Japanese War as a lieutenant, so he understood the realities of naval warfare. Hence, on August 8, 1939, at the five-ministry commission that was intended to make a plan for war, the Minister of Finance, Ishiwata, asked Yonai, \\"Is it possible for the Imperial Japanese Navy to triumph over America and Britain?\\" (Agawa, n.d.). Yonai answered, \\"No. The Imperial Japanese Navy is not designed to open fire against them. The Third Reich and the Italian Navy are out of question.\\" (Agawa, n.d.). After the historical triumph of the Battle of the Japan Sea in 1905 during the Russo-Japanese War, the Imperial Japanese Navy was the world's third strongest. By the end of World War I Japan had a powerful battle fleet. In the 1930s, following the Washington Naval Treaty, Japan built a strong naval aviation arm with excellent aircraft and pilots. Even so, the Imperial Japanese Navy could not compete against the Royal Navy and the United States Navy, the top two navies in the world. Consequently, the much smaller Kriegsmarine (German Navy) and the Regia Marina (Italian Navy) could not defeat these two dominants. Furthermore, the Imperial Japanese Navy had been made overconfident by its victory and was not willing to acknowledge a position of inferiority. However, his unique experiences made him convinced of his view. Therefore, Yonai clearly announced his opinion: the Imperial Japanese Navy would lose if it attacked the Royal Navy and the United States Navy.Agawa, H. (n.d.), Yonai Mitsumasa, Koubunsha = Pre-prime minister = Before he was chosen as the Prime Minister, Yonai showed strong leadership particularly in crisis. On February 26, 1936, there was an attempted coup d'√©tat led by young officers of the Imperial Japanese Army. The generals of the Imperial Japanese Army struggled to decide the appellation of the rebel troops, whom the generals were hesitant to refer to as rebels because it was extremely shameful for them to admit internecine strife. Hence, the generals were hesitant. On the other hand, Yonai, the commander-in-chief of the Sasebo Naval District, instantaneously labeled them as \\"Insurrectional troops\\", (Agawa, n.d.) and let the chief of his staff, Admiral Inoue Shigeyoshi, publish his position to all the Sasebo Naval District. Because of this immediate announcement, navy officers in the Sasebo Naval District were compelled to stop participating with the rebellion troops. Yonai's prompt action as the supreme commander tranquilized the Sasebo Naval District. = Time as prime minister (January 16 to July 16, 1940) = Despite not being famous, Yonai made significant decisions that depict his strong moral character. At his appointment as Prime Minister, he retired from active service without being asked to. He intended not to control his cabinet ministers by naval influences. This verdict was momentous, as once a general or admiral retires, he loses influence, hence all the generals and admirals are reluctant to retire. Indeed, even Tojo Hideki, the 40th Prime Minister did not retire at his promotion to Prime Minister, but persisted in active service in the Imperial Japanese Army in order to uphold his control over it. Because of Yonai's retirement from the Imperial Japanese Navy, the Yonai Cabinet was cooperative. One prominent evidence of this was that: nevertheless his cabinet had continued just a half a year, his cabinet members and followers formed a friendly reunion right after his resignation in 1937, and it still lasting in the Heisei period (1989‚Äìpresent). This reunion is named Ichi-Roku Kai, which means sixteenth gathering, because Yonai's appointment and resignation as a Prime Minister both happened on the 16th day of their months. = Emperor's trust = Emperor Sh≈çwa trusted Yonai's strong moral character. By July 1944, the situation of World War II was apparently against Japan. As for this difficult circumstance, the Imperial Japanese Navy was in a confusion. Supreme commanders of the Imperial Japanese Navy decided to appoint Yonai as the Minister of Navy because he had popularity and charisma enough to unite the Imperial Japanese Navy, although Yonai had already retired. To assign Yonai as the Minister of Navy, the Emperor's consent was necessary. Meanwhile, Admiral Suetsugu was also a candidate. The Emperor selected Yonai because Suetsugu was famous for his ambition, and allowed Yonai to be the Minister of Navy even though he was no longer in active service. This appointment demonstrated Sh≈çwa's trust in Yonai because he is the only one person in the Imperial Japanese Navy's history to return from retirement and be posted to the supreme position as the Minister of Navy. After the Imperial Japanese Navy was defeated, the Emperor called Yonai to the palace. The Emperor amiably invited Yonai to have lunch together. After that, the Emperor said, \\"I really appreciated your duty and effort not to begin the war. I think we are not going to meet often like before\\". He put a pen and inkstone into a case and said, \\"These are the things that I have used. I would like to present this as a gift to you.\\"Agawa, n.d. This action is extremely rare because having presented the belongings of the Emperor is the supreme honor and the utmost expression of amiability.

He grew up in the city of Noda, Kazusa Province (present day Chiba Prefecture). =Naval career= Suzuki entered the 14th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1884, graduating 13th of 45 cadets in 1887. Suzuki served on the corvettes , and cruiser as a midshipman. On being commissioned as ensign, he served on the corvette , corvette , corvette Jingei, ironclad , and gunboat . After his promotion to lieutenant on 21 December 1892, he served as chief navigator on the corvettes , , and . Nishida, People of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Suzuki served in the First Sino-Japanese War, commanding a torpedo boat and participated in a night torpedo assault in the Battle of Weihaiwei in 1895. Afterwards, he was promoted to lieutenant commander on 28 June 1898 after graduation from the Naval Staff College and assigned to a number of staff positions including that of naval attach√© to Germany from 1901 to 1903. On his return, he was promoted to commander on 26 September 1903. He came to be known as the leading torpedo warfare expert in the Imperial Japanese Navy.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 363‚Äì365. During the Russo-Japanese War, Suzuki commanded Destroyer Division 2 in 1904, which picked up survivors of the Port Arthur Blockade Squadron during the Battle of Port Arthur. He was appointed executive officer of the cruiser on 26 February 1904, aboard which he participated in the Battle of the Yellow Sea. During the pivotal Battle of Tsushima, Suzuki was commander of Destroyer Division 4 under the IJN 2nd Fleet, which assisted in sinking the Russian battleship . After the war, Suzuki was promoted to captain on 28 September 1907 and commanded the destroyer Akashi (1908), followed by the cruiser (1909), battleship (1911) and cruiser (1912). Promoted to rear admiral on 23 May 1913 and assigned to command the Maizuru Naval District. Suzuki became Vice Minister of the Navy from 1914 to 1917, during World War I. Promoted to vice admiral on 1 June 1917, he brought the cruisers and to San Francisco in early 1918 with 1,000 cadets, and was received by U.S. Navy Rear Admiral William Fullam. The Japanese cruisers then proceeded to South America. After stints as Commandant of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, Commander of the IJN 2nd Fleet, then the IJN 3rd Fleet, then Kure Naval District, he became a full admiral on 3 August 1923. Suzuki became Commander in Chief of Combined Fleet in 1924. After serving as Chief of Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff from 15 April 1925 to 22 January 1929, he retired and accepted the position as Privy Councillor and Grand Chamberlain from 1929 to 1936. Suzuki narrowly escaped assassination in the February 26 Incident in 1936; the would-be assassin's bullet remained inside his body for the rest of his life, and was only revealed upon his cremation. Suzuki was opposed to Japan's war with the United States, before and throughout World War II. =Prime Minister= Suzuki as naval minister On 7 April 1945, Prime Minister Kuniaki Koiso resigned and Suzuki was appointed to take his place at the age of seventy-seven. He simultaneously held the portfolios for Minister for Foreign Affairs and for Greater East Asia. Prime Minister Suzuki contributed to the final peace negotiations with the Allied Powers in World War II. He was involved in calling two unprecedented imperial conferences which helped resolve the split within the Japanese Imperial Cabinet over the Potsdam Declaration. He outlined the terms to Emperor Hirohito who had already agreed to accept unconditional surrender. This went strongly against the military faction of the cabinet, who desired to continue the war in hopes of negotiating a more favorable peace agreement. Part of this faction attempted to assassinate Suzuki twice in the Ky≈´j≈ç Incident on the morning of 15 August 1945. After the surrender of Japan became public, Suzuki resigned and Prince Higashikuni became next prime minister. Suzuki was the Chairman of the Privy Council from 7 August 1944 to 7 June 1945 and again after the surrender of Japan from 15 December 1945 to 13 June 1946.

An uncle-in-law of Emperor Hirohito twice over, Prince Higashikuni was the only member of the Japanese imperial family to head a cabinet and was the last general officer of the Imperial Japanese military to become Prime Minister. He was the founder of the Chiba Institute of Technology. Early life Prince Naruhiko was born in Kyoto, the ninth son of Prince Kuni Asahiko (Kuni no miya Asahiko Shinn≈ç) and the court lady Terao Utako. His father, Prince Asahiko, was a son of Prince Fushimi Kuniie (Fushimi no miya Kuniie Shinn≈ç), the twentieth head of the Fushimi-no-miya, the oldest of the sesshu shinn≈çke or cadet branches of the imperial dynasty from whom an emperor might be chosen in default of a direct heir. Prince Naruhiko was a half-brother of Prince Kuni Kuniyoshi, the father of the future Empress K≈çjun, the wife of Emperor Hirohito. His other half-brothers, Prince Asaka Yasuhiko, Prince Nashimoto Morimasa, and Prince Kaya Kuninori, all formed new branches of the imperial family (≈çke) during the Meiji period. Marriage and family Emperor Meiji granted Prince Naruhiko the title Higashikuni-no-miya and permission to start a new branch of the imperial family on 3 November 1906. Prince Naruhiko married the ninth daughter of Emperor Meiji, Princess Toshiko (11 May 1896 ‚Äì 5 March 1978), on 18 May 1915. The couple had four sons. #; married Princess Shigeko, the eldest daughter of Emperor Hirohito and Empress K≈çjun. #; died in the Great Kant≈ç earthquake. #; renounced imperial title and created Marquis Awata Akitsune, 1940 #; renounced imperial title and created Count Tarama Toshihiko, 1943; relocated to Lins, S√£o Paulo, Brazil, 1950.  Military career  Prince Higashikuni Naruhiko was a career officer in the Imperial Japanese Army. In 1908, he graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy as a second lieutenant, was promoted to lieutenant in 1910 and to captain in 1913. In 1914, he graduated from the Army War College. He was commissioned a captain in the 29th Infantry Brigade, and promoted to major in the IJA 7th Division in 1915. Prince Higashikuni then studied military tactics at the √âcole Sp√©ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr and √âcole Polytechnique in Paris France, from 1920 to 1926, during which time he was promoted to lieutenant- colonel in 1920 and to colonel in 1926. Always somewhat of a rebel, Prince Higashikuni's behavior in Paris scandalized the Imperial Court. He had a French mistress, enjoyed fast cars and high living. He left his wife and children in Japan, and the death of his second son did not prompt his return. In 1926, the Imperial Household Ministry dispatched a chamberlain to Paris to collect him. Upon his return to Japan, he was assigned to the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Headquarters. Promoted to major-general in August 1930 and appointed commander of the 5th Infantry Brigade (1930‚Äì1934), he was promoted to lieutenant-general in August 1934 and given command of the IJA 4th Division (1934‚Äì1937). After the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, he headed the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service (1937‚Äì1938), and the IJA 2nd Army stationed in China from 1938‚Äì1939. He was promoted to general in August 1939. According to a memo discovered by historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi, Prince Higashikuni authorized the use of poison gas against the Chinese on 16 August 1938.Wakabayashi, Bob Tadashi (1991). \\"Emperor Hirohito on Localized Aggression in China \\". Sino-Japanese Studies 4 (1), p.7. On 13 May 1939 the Imperial General Headquarters authorized the use of poison gas to Japanese Northern China Area ArmyÔºàÂ§ßÈô∏ÊåáÁ¨¨ÂõõÁôæ‰∫îÂçÅ‰∫åÂè∑). Only riot control agents were used till then. Prince Higashikuni moved to the post at home dated 4 January 1939. Promoted to full general, The prince was awarded the Order of the Golden Kite, 1st Class in 1940. Before Japan entered the Second World War, on 15 October 1941, outgoing Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe proposed Prince Higashikuni to Emperor Hirohito as his successor for prime minister.Peter Wetzler, Hirohito and War, 1998, p.41 Konoe believed that only a member of the Imperial Family with a distinguished military background could restrain the pro-war faction led by Generals Hajime Sugiyama, Hideki T≈çj≈ç, and Akira Mut≈ç. Prince Higashikuni was also the choice of both Chief of Staffs of the Army and the Navy. However, both Emperor Hirohito and the Lord Privy Seal, Kido K≈çichi, believed that it would be inappropriate for a member of the Imperial Family to serve in that position, as he could be blamed for anything which went wrong in the war. Thus, two days later, Hirohito chose General Hideki T≈çj≈ç as Prime Minister. In 1946, he explained this decision: \\"I actually thought Prince Higashikuni suitable as Chief of Staff of the Army; but I think the appointment of a member of the Imperial house to a political office must be considered very carefully. Above all, in time of peace this is fine, but when there is a fear that there may even be a war, then more importantly, considering the welfare of the imperial house, I wonder about the wisdom of a member of the Imperial family serving [as prime minister].\\"Wetzler, ibid., p.44, Terasaki Hidenari, Sh≈çwa tenn≈ç dokuhakuroku, 1991, p.118 Six weeks later, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. During the early stages of the Pacific War, Prince Higashikuni served as commander of the General Defense Command from 1941 to 1944. Prince Higashikuni remained steadfast in his opposition to the war with the Allied powers, and was part of the conspiracy (with Prince Asaka, Prince Takamatsu, and former Prime Minister Konoe) which finally ousted T≈çj≈ç in July 1944 following the fall of Saipan to American forces. The American researchers with SCAP also found out that he had planned towards the end of the war to depose Hirohito, placing the minor Akihito on the throne instead, governing the country with himself as regent.vgl. Records of the Army Staff: The Investigative Records Repository (IRR) released under the Japanese Imperial Government Disclosure Act of 2000 Prime Minister Higashikuni's cabinet with thumb After the course of the war turned against Japan, and the decision was made to accept the Potsdam Declaration, Emperor Hirohito appointed Prince Higashikuni to the position of prime minister on 16 August 1945, replacing Admiral Kantar≈ç Suzuki. The mission of the Higashikuni cabinet was twofold: first, to ensure the orderly cessation of hostilities and demobilization of the Japanese armed forces; and second, to reassure the Japanese people that the imperial institution remained secure. Prince Higashikuni resigned in October over a dispute with the American occupation forces over the repeal of the 1925 Peace Preservation Law. Life after resignation On 27 February and 4 March 1946, Prince Higashikuni gave interviews to the Yomiuri-H≈çchi and The New York Times newspapers in which he claimed that many members of the imperial family had approved Emperor Hirohito's abdication, with Prince Takamatsu serving as regent until Crown Prince Akihito came of age. In the government, only Prime Minister Kij≈´r≈ç Shidehara and the Imperial Household Minister opposed this. In 1946, Prince Higashikuni asked the emperor for permission to renounce his membership in the Imperial Family and become a commoner. The emperor denied the request. However, along with other members of the Imperial branch families (shinn≈çke and ≈çke), Prince Higashikuni lost his title and most of his wealth as a result of the American occupation‚Äôs abolition of the princely houses on 17 October 1947. As a private citizen, Higashikuni operated several unsuccessful retail enterprises (including a provisions store, second-hand goods store, and dressmaker's shop). He even created his own new Zen Buddhism-based religious sect, the Higashikuni-kyo, which was subsequently banned by the American occupation authorities. The former prince became the honorary chairman of the International Martial Arts Federation (IMAF) in 1957, and honorary president of several other organizations. In 1958, Higashikuni published his wartime journals under the title, Ichi Kozoku no Senso Nikki (or The War Diary of a Member of the Imperial Family). He published his autobiographical memoirs, Higashikuni Nikki, in 1968. Higashikuni died of heart failure in Tokyo on 20 January 1990 at the age of , having outlived his wife, two of his sons, his siblings, and his nephew, Emperor Hirohito. Higashikuni is today mainly remembered as Japan's first postwar prime minister. He was one of the longest- lived prime ministers of all time, along with Antoine Pinay, Willem Drees and Christopher Hornsrud, and at his death was the last surviving full general of the Imperial Japanese Army. From 14 May 1988, when former Netherlands Prime Minister Willem Drees died until his own death, Higashikuni was the world's oldest living former head of government.

Kapisa was one of the western capitals of emperor Kaniska, who was a great supporter of SarvƒÅstivƒÅda. Sanghasen Singh (1994), SarvƒÅstivƒÅda and Its Traditions, p. 59. The SarvƒÅstivƒÅda (Sanskrit; ) was one of the early Buddhist schools established around the reign of Asoka (third century BCE).Westerhoff, The Golden Age of Indian Buddhist Philosophy in the First Millennium CE, 2018, p. 60. It was particularly known as an Abhidharma tradition, with a unique set of seven Abhidharma works.Westerhoff, 2018, p. 61. The SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins were one of the most influential Buddhist monastic groups, flourishing throughout North India (especially Kashmir) and Central Asia until the 7th century. The orthodox Kashmiri branch of the school composed the large and encyclopedic MahƒÅvibhƒÅ·π£a ≈öƒÅstra around the time of the reign of Kanishka (c. 127‚Äì150 CE). Because of this, orthodox SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins who upheld the doctrines in the MahƒÅvibhƒÅ·π£a were called VaibhƒÅ·π£ikas. The SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins are believed to have given rise to the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda sect as well as the SautrƒÅntika tradition, although the relationship between these groups has not yet been fully determined. Name SarvƒÅstivƒÅda is a Sanskrit term that can be glossed as: \\"the theory of all exists\\". The SarvƒÅstivƒÅda argued that all dharmas exist in the past, present and future, the \\"three times\\". Vasubandhu's Abhidharmako≈õakƒÅrikƒÅ states, \\"He who affirms the existence of the dharmas of the three time periods [past, present and future] is held to be a SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin.\\" Although there is some dispute over how the word \\"SarvƒÅstivƒÅda\\" is to be analyzed, the general consensus is that it is to be parsed into three parts: sarva \\"all\\" or \\"every\\" + asti \\"exist\\" + vada \\"speak\\", \\"say\\" or \\"theory\\". This equates perfectly with the Chinese term, Shu≈çyƒ´qi√®y«íu b√π (),Taisho 27, n1545 which is literally \\"the sect that speaks of the existence of everything,\\" as used by Xuanzang and other translators. The SarvƒÅstivƒÅda was also known by other names, particularly hetuvada and yuktivada. Hetuvada comes from hetu ‚Äì 'cause', which indicates their emphasis on causation and conditionality. Yuktivada comes from yukti ‚Äì 'reason' or even 'logic', which shows their use of rational argument and syllogism. Origination and history Kshatrapa lady\\" named Na·πÉda (70px Na·πÉdaye Kshatrapa), from the Art of Mathura.For a modern image see Figure 9 in The stele is dedicated to the Bodhisattva \\"for the welfare and happiness of all sentient beings for the acceptance of the Sarvastivadas\\". Northern Satraps period, 1st century CE. Copper-plate inscription mentioning the Sarvastivadas, in the year 134 of the Azes era, i.e. 84 CE, Kalawan, Taxila. = Early history = According to Charles Prebish, \\"there is a great deal of mystery surrounding the rise and early development of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin school.\\"Buddhism: A Modern Perspective. Charles S. Prebish. Penn State Press: 1975. pg 42-43 According to Dhammajoti, \\"its presence, as well as that of its rival ‚Äî the VibhajyavƒÅda lineage ‚Äî in the time of Emperor A≈õoka is beyond doubt. Since A≈õoka‚Äôs reign is around 268‚Äì232 B.C.E., this means that at least by the middle of the 3rd century B.C.E., it had already developed into a distinct school.\\"Dhammajoti (2009), p. 55. In Central Asia, several Buddhist monastic groups were historically prevalent. According to some accounts, the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins emerged from the Sthavira nikƒÅya, a small group of conservatives, who split from the reformist majority MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas at the Second Buddhist council. According to this account, they were expelled from Magadha, and moved to northwestern India where they developed into the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin school. A number of scholars have identified three distinct major phases of missionary activity seen in the history of Buddhism in Central Asia, which are associated with respectively the Dharmaguptaka, SarvƒÅstivƒÅda, and the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda,Willemen, Charles. Dessein, Bart. Cox, Collett. SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Buddhist Scholasticism. 1997. p. 126 and the origins of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda have also been related to Ashoka sending Majjhantika (Sanskrit: MadhyƒÅntika) on a mission to Gandhara, which had an early presence of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda. The SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins in turn are believed to have given rise to the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda sect, although the relationship between these two groups has not yet been fully determined. According to Prebish, \\"this episode corresponds well with one SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin tradition stating that Madhyantika converted the city of Kasmir, which seems to have close ties with Gandhara.\\" A third tradition says that a community of SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin monks was established at Mathura by the patriarch Upagupta. In the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin tradition Upagupta is said to have been the fifth patriarch after MahƒÅka≈õyapa, ƒÄnanda, MadhyƒÅntika, and ≈öƒÅ·πáakavƒÅsin, and in the Ch'an tradition he is regarded as the fourth. =Kushan era= A Kushan era votive stupa from Mohra Muradu, Taxila, where SarvƒÅstivƒÅda groups are known to have lived by the end of the first century BCE.Willemen, Charles. Dessein, Bart. Cox, Collett. SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Buddhist Scholasticism. 1997. p. 103 The SarvƒÅstivƒÅda enjoyed the patronage of Kanishka (c. 127‚Äì150 CE) emperor of the Kushan Empire, during which time they were greatly strengthened, and became one of the dominant sects of Buddhism in north India for centuries, flourishing throughout Northwest India, North India, and Central Asia. When the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda school held a synod in Kashmir during the reign of Kanishka II (c. 158-176), the most important SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Abhidharma text, the Astagrantha of Katyayaniputra was rewritten and revised in Sanskrit. This revised text was now known as J√±ƒÅnaprasthƒÅna (\\"Course of Knowledge\\"). Though the Gandharan Astagrantha had many vibha·π£as (commentaries), the new Kashmiri J√±ƒÅnaprasthƒÅna had a Sanskrit MahƒÅvibha·π£a, compiled by the Kashmir SarvƒÅstivƒÅda synod.Westerhoff, 2018, p. 61. The J√±ƒÅnaprasthƒÅna and its MahƒÅvibha·π£a, were then declared to be the new orthodoxy by Kashmiris, who called themselves VaibhƒÅ·π£ikas. The Dharmarajika Stupa and monastery ruins, a major Buddhist site in Taxila, one of the capitals of the Kushan empire. This new VaibhƒÅ·π£ika orthodoxy, however, was not readily accepted by all SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins. Some \\"Western masters\\" from Gandhara and Bactria had divergent views which disagreed with the new Kashmiri orthodoxy. These disagreements can be seen in post-MahƒÅvibha·π£a works, such as the *Tattvasiddhi-≈öƒÅstra (ÊàêÂØ¶Ë´ñ), the *Abhidharmah·πõdaya (T no. 1550) and its commentaries (T no. 1551, no. 1552), the Abhidharmako≈õakƒÅrikƒÅ of Vasubandhu and its commentaries (who critiqued some orthodox views), and the *NyƒÅyƒÅnusƒÅra (Ny) of master Sa·πÉghabhadra (ca fifth century CE) who formulated the most robust VaibhƒÅ·π£ika response to the new criticisms.Dhammajoti (2009), p. 57.  Sub-schools  SarvƒÅstivƒÅda was a widespread group, and there were different sub-schools or sects throughout its history, the most influential ones being the VaibhƒÅ·π£ika and the SautrƒÅntika schools. = VaibhƒÅ·π£ika = The VaibhƒÅ·π£ika was formed by adherents of the MahƒÅvibhƒÅ·π£a ≈öƒÅstra (MV≈ö) during the council of Kashmir. Since then, it comprised the orthodox or mainstream branch of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda school based in KƒÅ≈õmƒ´ra (though not exclusive to this region). The VaibhƒÅ≈õika-SarvƒÅstivƒÅda, which had by far the most \\"comprehensive edifice of doctrinal systematics\\" of the early Buddhist schools,\\"one does not find anywhere else a body of doctrine as organized or as complete as theirs\\" . . .\\"Indeed, no other competing schools have ever come close to building up such a comprehensive edifice of doctrinal systematics as the VaibhƒÅ≈õika.\\" The Sautrantika theory of seeds (bija ) revisited: With special reference to the ideological continuity between Vasubandhu's theory of seeds and its Srilata/Darstantika precedents by Park, Changhwan, PhD thesis, University of California, Berkeley, 2007 pg 2 was widely influential in India and beyond.A Study of the Abhidharmah·πõdaya: The Historical Development of the Concept of Karma in the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Thought. PhD thesis by Wataru S. Ryose. University of Wisconsin-Madison: 1987 pg 3 As noted by KL Dhammajoti, \\"It is important to realize that not all of them necessarily subscribed to each and every view sanctioned by the MV≈ö compilers. Moreover, the evolving nature of the VaibhƒÅ·π£ika views must be recognized as well.\\"Dhammajoti (2009), p. 76. The VaibhƒÅ≈õika-SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins are sometimes referred to in the MV≈ö as \\"the ƒÄbhidharmikas\\", \\"the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda theoreticians\\" and \\"the masters of KƒÅ≈õmƒ´ra.\\"Dhammajoti (2009), p. 73. In various texts, they also referred to their tradition as YuktavƒÅda (the doctrine of logic), as well as HetuvƒÅda (the doctrine of causes).Dhammajoti (2009), pp. 56, 164. The VaibhƒÅ·π£ika school saw itself as the orthodox SarvƒÅstivƒÅda tradition, and they were united in their doctrinal defense of the theory of \\"all exists\\" (sarvƒÅm asti). This is the doctrine which held that dharmas, past present and future, all exist. This doctrine has been described as an eternalist theory of time.Kalupahana, David; A history of Buddhist philosophy, continuities and discontinuities, page 128. While the VaibhƒÅ·π£ikas held that dharmas of the three times all exist, they held that only present dharmas have \\"efficacy\\" (karitra), thus they were able to explain how the present seems to function differently than the past or future.Westerhoff, 2018, p. 63. Among the different SarvƒÅstivƒÅda thinkers, there were different ideas on how this theory was to be understood.Poussin; Pruden, Abhidharmakosabhasyam of Vasubandhu, Vol 3, 1991, p. 808. These differences were accepted as long as they did not contradict the doctrine of \\"all exists\\" and can be seen in the MV≈ö, which outlines the four different interpretations of this doctrine by the ‚Äòfour great ƒÄbhidharmikas of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda‚Äô: DharmatrƒÅta, Buddhadeva, Vasumitra and Gho·π£aka.Dhammajoti (2009), p. 75. The doctrines of SarvƒÅstivƒÅda were not confined to 'all exists', but also include the theory of momentariness (ksanika), conjoining (samprayukta) and causal simultaneity (sahabhu), conditionality (hetu and pratyaya), a unique presentation of the spiritual path (marga), and others. These doctrines are all inter-connected and it is the principle of 'all exists' that is the axial doctrine holding the larger movement together when the precise details of other doctrines are at stake. In order to explain how it is possible for a dharma to remain the same and yet also undergo change as it moves through the three times, the VaibhƒÅ·π£ika held that dharmas have a constant essence (svabhƒÅva) which persists through the three times.Westerhoff, 2018, p. 70. The term was also identified as a unique mark or own characteristic (svalaksana) that differentiated a dharma and remained unchangeable throughout its existence. According to VaibhƒÅ·π£ikas, svabhavas are those things that exist substantially (dravyasat) as opposed to those things which are made up of aggregations of dharmas and thus only have a nominal existence (praj√±aptisat). = DƒÅr·π£·π≠ƒÅntikas and SautrƒÅntikas = The SautrƒÅntikas (\\"those who uphold the s≈´tras\\"), also known as DƒÅr·π£·π≠ƒÅntikas (who may or may not have been a separate but related group), did not uphold the MahƒÅvibhƒÅ·π£a ≈öƒÅstra, but rather emphasized the Buddhist s≈´tras as being authoritative.Westerhoff, Jan, The Golden Age of Indian Buddhist Philosophy, Oxford University Press, 2018, p. 73. Already by the time of the MV≈ö, the early DƒÅr·π£·π≠ƒÅntikas such as DharmatrƒÅta and Buddhadeva, existed as a school of thought within the fold of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda who disagreed with the orthodox views.Dhammajoti (2009), p. 74. These groups were also called \\"the western masters\\" (pƒÅ≈õcƒÅtya), the foreign masters (bahirde≈õaka; also called ‚Äòthe masters outside Ka≈õmƒ´ra‚Äô, and the ‚ÄòGƒÅndhƒÅrian masters‚Äô).Dhammajoti (2009), p. 75. They studied the same Abhidharma texts as other SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins, but in a more critical way. According to KL Dhammajoti, they eventually came to repudiate the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda doctrine of \\"all exists.\\"Dhammajoti (2009), p. 77. It is this group, i.e. those who rejected the most important SarvƒÅstivƒÅda doctrine (along with numerous other key VaibhƒÅ·π£ika views), which came to be called SautrƒÅntika (those who rely on sutras).Willemen, Charles; Dessein, Bart; Cox, Collett (1998). SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Buddhist Scholasticism, p. 109. Handbuch der Orientalistik. Zweite Abteilung. Indien. The SautrƒÅntikas did not reject abhidharma however, in fact they were the authors of several abhidharma manuals, like the *Abhidharmah·πõdaya. Kofukuji Temple, Nara, Japan The most important SautrƒÅntika was Vasubandhu (ca.350-430), a native from Purusapura in Gandhara. He is famous for his Abhidharmako≈õa, a very influential abhidharma work, with an auto commentary that defends SautrƒÅntika views. He famously later converted to the Yogacara school of Mahayana, a tradition that itself developed out of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Abhidharma. Vasubandhu's Ko≈õa led to a vigorous reaction from his contemporary, the brilliant VaibhƒÅ·π£ika master Sa·πÉghabhadra, who is said to have spent 12 years composing the *NyƒÅyƒÅnusƒÅra (a commentary to Vasubandhu's verses) to refute Vasubandhu and other SautrƒÅntikas such as Sthavira ≈örƒ´lƒÅta and his pupil RƒÅma.Dhammajoti (2009), p. 110. The Ko≈õa was so influential that it became the Abhidharma text par excellence in both East Asian Buddhism and Indo-Tibetan Buddhism. Even today, it remains the main text for the study of Abhidharma in these traditions. The later Buddhist tradition of pramƒÅ·πáa founded by DignƒÅga and Dharmakƒ´rti is also associated with the SautrƒÅntika school. =M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅdins= There is much uncertainty as to the relationship of the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda (meaning root or original SarvƒÅstivƒÅda) school and the others. They were certainly influential in spreading their M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda Vinaya, as it remains the monastic rule used in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism today. Also, they seem to have been influential in Indonesia by the 7th century, as noted by Yijing.Coedes, George. The Indianized States of South-East Asia. 1968. p. 84 A number of theories have been posited by academics as to how the two are related including: * Frauwallner holds that M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda was the community of Mathura, which was an independent group from the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins of Ka≈õmir. According to Bhikkhu Sujato, this theory has \\"stood the test of time.\\" * Lamotte thought that the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda Vinaya was a late compilation from Ka≈õmƒ´r. * Warder suggests that the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅdins was a late group who compiled a Vinaya and the Saddharmasm·πõtyupasthƒÅna S≈´tra. * Enomoto holds that the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin and M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅdin were the same. * Willemen, Dessein, and Cox hold that this group is really the SautrƒÅntika school who renamed themselves in the later years of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda school history.  Texts  =Vinaya= The Dharmaguptaka are known to have rejected the authority of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda pratimok·π£a rules on the grounds that the original teachings of the Buddha had been lost.Baruah, Bibhuti. Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism. 2008. p. 52 The complete SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Vinaya is extant in the Chinese Buddhist canon. In its early history, the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Vinaya was the most common vinaya tradition in China. However, Chinese Buddhism later settled on the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya. In the 7th century, Yijing wrote that in eastern China, most people followed the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, while the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya was used in earlier times in Guanzhong (the region around Chang'an), and that the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Vinaya was prominent in the Yangzi River area and further south.Mohr, Thea. Tsedroen, Jampa. Dignity and Discipline: Reviving Full Ordination for Buddhist Nuns. 2010. p. 187 In the 7th century, the existence of multiple Vinaya lineages throughout China was criticized by prominent Vinaya masters such as Yijing and Dao'an (654-717). In the early 8th century, Daoan gained the support of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang, and an imperial edict was issued that the sa·πÉgha in China should use only the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya for ordination.Heirman, Ann. Bumbacher, Stephan Peter. The Spread of Buddhism. 2007. pp. 194-195 =ƒÄgamas= Scholars at present have \\"a nearly complete collection of s≈´tras from the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda school\\" thanks to a recent discovery in Afghanistan of roughly two-thirds of the Dƒ´rgha ƒÄgama in Sanskrit. The Madhyama ƒÄgama (T26, Chinese trans. Gotama Sa·πÖghadeva) and Sa·πÉyukta ƒÄgama (T99, Chinese trans. Gu·πáabhadra) have long been available in Chinese translation. The SarvƒÅstivƒÅda is therefore the only early school besides the Theravada for which we have a roughly complete sutra collection, although unlike the Theravada it has not all been preserved in the original language. =Abhidharma= During the first century, the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda abhidharma primarily consisted of the Abhidharmahrdaya authored by Dharmashresthin, a native from Tokharistan, and the Ashtagrantha authored/compiled by Katyayaniputra. Both texts were translated by Samghadeva in 391 AD and in 183 AD. respectively, but they were not completed until 390 in Southern China. The SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Abhidharma consists of seven texts: *J√±ƒÅnaprasthƒÅna (\\"Foundation of Knowledge\\") (T. 1543-1544) *Prakara·πáapƒÅda (\\"Exposition\\") (T. 1541-1542) *Vij√±ƒÅnakƒÅya (\\"Body of Consciousness\\") (T. 1539) *Dharmaskandha (\\"Aggregation of Dharmas\\") (T. 1537) *Praj√±apti≈õƒÅstra (\\"Treatise on Designations\\") (T. 1538) *DhƒÅtukƒÅya (\\"Body of Elements\\") (T. 1540) *Sa·πÖgƒ´tiparyƒÅya (\\"Discourses on Gathering Together\\") (T. 1536) Following these, are the texts that became the authority of the VaibhƒÅ·π£ika: *MahƒÅvibhƒÅ·π£ƒÅ (\\"Great Commentary\\" on the J√±ƒÅnaprasthƒÅna) (T. 1545) All of these works have been translated into Chinese, and are now part of the Chinese Buddhist canon. In the Chinese context, the word abhidharma refers to the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda abhidharma, although at a minimum the Dharmaguptaka, Pudgalavada and Theravada also had abhidharmas. = Later Abhidharma manuals = Various other Abhidharma works were written by SarvƒÅstivƒÅda masters, some are more concise manuals of abhidharma, others critiqued the orthodox VaibhƒÅ·π£ika views or provided a defense of the orthodoxy. Dhammajoti provides the following list of such later abhidharma works that are extant in Chinese: 108 109 * *AbhidharmƒÅm·πõta(-rasa)-≈õƒÅstra (T no. 1553), by Gho·π£aka, 2 fasc., translator unknown. 2. * *Abhidharmah·πõdaya (T no. 1550) by Dharma≈õrƒ´, 4 fasc., tr. by Sa·πÖghadeva et. al. 3. * *Abhidharmah·πõdaya-s≈´tra (?

Appearance and language  = Appearance = Between 148 and 170 CE, the Parthian monk An Shigao came to China and translated a work which described the color of monastic robes (Skt. kƒÅ·π£ƒÅya) utitized in five major Indian Buddhist sects, called Da Biqiu Sanqian Weiyi (Â§ßÊØî‰∏ò‰∏âÂçÉÂ®ÅÂÑÄ).Hino, Shoun. Three Mountains and Seven Rivers. 2004. p. 55 Another text translated at a later date, the ≈öƒÅriputraparip·πõcchƒÅ, contains a very similar passage with nearly the same information. In the earlier source, the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda are described as wearing dark red robes, while the Dharmaguptas are described as wearing black robes.Hino, Shoun. Three Mountains and Seven Rivers. 2004. pp. 55-56 However, in the corresponding passage found in the later ≈öƒÅriputraparip·πõcchƒÅ, the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda are described as wearing black robes and the Dharmaguptas as wearing dark red robes. In traditions of Tibetan Buddhism, which follow the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda Vinaya, red robes are regarded as characteristic of their tradition.Mohr, Thea. Tsedroen, Jampa. Dignity and Discipline: Reviving Full Ordination for Buddhist Nuns. 2010. p. 266 = Language = During the first century BCE, in the Gandharan cultural area (consisting of Oddiyana, Gandhara and Bactria, Tokharistan, across the Khyber Pass), the Sthaviriyas used the GƒÅndhƒÅrƒ´ language to write their literature using the Kharosthi. The Tibetan historian Buton Rinchen Drub wrote that the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas used PrƒÅkrit, the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins used Sanskrit, the Sthavira nikƒÅya used Pai≈õƒÅcƒ´, and the Sa·πÉmitƒ´ya used Apabhra·πÉ≈õa. Influence The SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins of KƒÅ≈õmƒ´ra held the ' as authoritative, and thus were given the moniker of being VaibhƒÅ·π£ikas. The ' is thought to have been authored around 150 CE, around the time of Kani·π£ka (127‚Äì151 CE) of the Ku·π£ƒÅ·πáa Empire.Potter, Karl. Abhidharma Buddhism to 150 A.D. 1998. p. 112 This massive treatise of Abhidharma (200 fascicles in Chinese) contains a great deal of material with what appear to be strong affinities to MahƒÅyƒÅna doctrines.Potter, Karl. Abhidharma Buddhism to 150 A.D. 1998. p. 117 The ' is also said to illustrate the accommodations reached between the Hƒ´nayƒÅna and MahƒÅyƒÅna traditions, as well as the means by which MahƒÅyƒÅna doctrines would become accepted.Potter, Karl.

He bears the distinction of having been the first socialist to serve as Prime Minister of Japan, and the first Prime Minister of post-war Japan. Early life He was born in Tanabe, Wakayama Prefecture on 28 July 1887. He attended Tokyo Imperial University and received a bachelor's degree in law. Raised in the Christian faith, he was strongly influenced by the Christian socialism of Abe Isoo. After graduating, he opened a law office in a rented YMCA dormitory, and worked as an attorney. Early political life Katayama became secretary-general of the Social Democratic Party when it was established in 1926. He was elected to the House of Representatives, representing Kanagawa Prefecture, in 1930. Later in 1932, he joined the executive committee of the Socialist Masses Party. However, he was removed from the party, since he did not participate in the session of the House where Takao Saito was expelled from the House due to his antimilitary speech. After World War II, Katayama began to serve as secretary-general of the Japan Socialist Party when it was established in November 1945. Next in September 1946, he became the chairman of the party's executive committee. Prime Minister and later life Following the 1947 elections, in which the Socialist Party came in first, Katayama formed a coalition government with the Democratic Party and the National Cooperative Party. Despite leading a short- lived administration, Katayama's time in office saw the enactment of a wide range of progressive social reforms, such as the establishment of Japan's first Labour Ministry,Studies on Japan‚Äôs social democratic parties, Volume 2 by George Oakley Totten an Unemployment Compensation Act and an Unemployment Insurance Act, and the overhaul revision of the Civil Code, whose section on the family institution was completely rewritten (to provide, for instance, the eldest son with a greater inheritance share). The Labour Standards Act of September 1947 introduced maternity leave for a five weekly mandatory post- natal period, and prohibited dismissal of women during maternity leave and for thirty days after the end of the leave, although not all workers were covered.http://www.oecd.org/els/family/PF2.5%20Trends%20in%20leave%20entitlements%20around%20childbirth%20since%201970%20-%2010%20oct%202012%20-%20FINAL%20-%20Annex.pdf In addition, the law provided for equal pay for equal work. The Employment Security Law of November 1947 contained authority for the government to operate a system of free public employment exchanges on a broader and more democratic basis than under the former Employment Exchange Law. It also provided for public services to the handicapped in securing employment, and outlawed labor bosses and other undemocratic forms of labor recruitment. The Child Welfare Law of December 1947 extended special protection to abused, abandoned, and neglected children, guaranteed the privacy rights of children born out of wedlock, established health-care programmes for mothers and children, provided for prenatal care, outlawed the employment of minors in dangerous occupations, and abolished the practice of indentured labour. The legislation also laid the institutional foundation for a nationwide system of childcare centres, created standards for foster parentage, and made the state responsible for setting up and supervising orphanages and other juvenile institutions. The Law for the Elimination of Excessive Economic Concentration (passed in December 1947) provided for the dissolution of any company considered to be monopolistic,The economic emergence of modern Japan, Volume 1 by K≈çz≈ç Yamamura while the \\"law on the expulsion of Zaibatsu-affiliated controls\\" of January 1948 enforced the resignation of Zaibatsu board members who were related closely to Zaibatsu families, while a measure was taken to ban on holding the concurrent board posts of their affiliated companies. In addition, a government employees law was enacted, the first group of Japanese Supreme Court justices was appointed, local government and the police were reorganised, the Ministries of Home Affairs, Navy, and War were abolished,Socialist Parties in Postwar Japan, by Allan B. Cole, George O. Totten And Cecil H. Uyehara, with a Contributed Chapter by Ronald P. Dore extensive revisions were made to criminal law, and progress was made on land reform. At the end of the 1950s, Katayama was also the president of the Japan's Temperance Union. The influence of left-wing socialists such as Suzuki Mosabur≈ç forced Katayama to resign early in his term. After his resignation, Katayama became a member of the Democratic Socialist Party and advocated the maintenance of the pacifist constitution, election reform, and formation of a global commonwealth. In 1963, Katayama left politics after he lost his seat in the general elections.

He was a prominent figure in the immediate postwar political landscape, but was forced to resign his leadership responsibilities after a corruption scandal (Sh≈çwa Denk≈ç Jiken) targeting two of his cabinet ministers.  Early political life  Ashida was born in Fukuchiyama, Kyoto, and studied French civil law at Tokyo Imperial University. After graduation, he worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for twenty years. In 1932, Ashida ran his first successful campaign for a seat in the House of Representatives as a member of the Seiy≈´kai Party. He sided with Ichir≈ç Hatoyama's \\"orthodox\\" wing following the Seiyukai's split in 1939. After the war, Ashida won a seat in the new Diet as a member of the Liberal Party,from which he split to merge with Kij≈´r≈ç Shidehara's Progressive Party to form the Democratic Party. Ashida was elected president of the new party, and became Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1947 under Socialist prime minister Tetsu Katayama. He also chaired the Committee on the Bill for Revision of the Imperial Constitution, and served as the chairman of the Kenp≈ç Fuky≈´ Kai, a society created to promote the revised Constitution of Japan, from 1946‚Äì1948. During his term, he made a key amendment to Article Nine of the planned Japanese Constitution, which enabled the creation of the Japanese Self-Defense Force.  Prime Minister and later life  Ashida became prime minister in 1948, leading a coalition government of Democratic and Socialist members. His tenure ended just seven months after it began. Two of his cabinet ministers were accused of corruption in the Showa Electric scandal, which forced the cabinet to resign. Ten years later, in 1958, Ashida was cleared of all charges in relation to the incident. He died a year later at the age of seventy-one.

The English book struck a sympathetic chord in Ichir≈ç, and he began to advocate fraternity, also known as y≈´ai (ÂèãÊÑõ) in Japanese. On March 29, 1951, he was initiated as 1st degree of freemason, and on March 26, 1955, passed as 2nd degree mason, and raised as 3rd degree mason. Ichir≈ç Hatoyama, Yukio Hatoyama, and Kunio Hatoyama. His grandsons are advocates of fraternity. However, when a Japanese press asked Yukio Hatoyama's office and the masonic grand lodge of Japan whether Yukio Hatoyama was a freemason, his office denied it and the grand lodge of Japan didn't answer it. At least, on his grandson Kunio Hatoyama, the brother of Yukio, on a Japanese TV program Takajin no Money on August 25, 2012, his partner Emily's Australian father was a member of freemasonry. He said so, and said he had swum in a masonic pool with her at Tokyo when he had started to going steady with her. Although he didn't say he himself was a mason or not, he insisted that he had not been invited to freemasonry, and he guessed his brother Yukio as a freemason. Yukio and Kunio became the officers of a fraternal organization named Y≈´ai Ky≈çkai (or Y≈´ai Association) with their sister Kazuko, founded by their grandfather Ichir≈ç who became the first president of the former organization in 1953.

He was a member of the House of Representatives for more than 50 years. He was best known for pushing through the privatization of state-owned companies, and for helping to revitalize Japanese nationalism during and after his term as prime minister. Early life One-year-old Nakasone (1919) Nakasone was born in Takasaki in Gunma, a prefecture northwest of Tokyo, on 27 May 1918. He was the second son of Nakasone Matsugoro II, a lumber dealer, and Nakamura Yuku. He had five siblings: an elder brother named Kichitaro, an elder sister named Shoko, a younger brother named Ryosuke and another younger brother and younger sister who both died in childhood. The Nakasone family had been of the samurai class during the Edo period, and claimed direct descent from the Minamoto clan through the famous Minamoto no Yoshimitsu and through his son Minamoto no Yoshikiyo (d. 1149). According to family records, Tsunayoshi (k. 1417), a vassal of the Takeda clan and a tenth-generation descendant of Yoshikiyo, took the name of Nakasone Juro and was killed at the Battle of Sagamigawa. In about 1590, the samurai Nakasone S≈çemon Mitsunaga settled in the town of in K≈çzuke Province. His descendants became silk merchants and pawnbrokers. Nakasone's father, originally born Nakasone Kanichi, settled in Takasaki in 1912 and established a timber business and lumberyard which had success as a result of the post-First World War building boom. Nakasone described his early childhood and youth as a happy one, and himself as a \\"quiet, easy-going child\\" nicknamed \\"Yat-chan\\". He attended a local primary school in Takasaki and was a poor student until the fourth grade, after which he excelled and was at the top of his class. He entered Shizuoka High School in 1935, where he excelled in history and literature, and learned to speak fluent French. In the autumn of 1938, Nakasone entered Tokyo Imperial University. During World War II, he was a commissioned officer and paymaster in the Imperial Japanese Navy. As an officer in the town of Balikpapan in East Kalimantan, he ordered his men to hunt down and abduct Indonesian women for use as comfort women, and official records survive praising him for having abducted so many. (When asked about this in 2007, he claimed that the women were brought to a \\"recreation center\\" and made to play shogi and go with the male officers.) He later wrote of his return to Tokyo in August 1945 after Japan's surrender: \\"I stood vacantly amid the ruins of Tokyo, after discarding my officer's short sword and removing the epaulettes of my uniform. As I looked around me, I swore to resurrect my homeland from the ashes of defeat\\". Nakasone in the Imperial Japanese Navy In 1947, he gave up a promising career in an elite government ministry to run for Parliament with the belief that in its postwar remorse, Japan was in danger of discarding its traditional values. He campaigned on a nationalist platform, arguing for an enlarged Self-Defence Force, to amend Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution (which outlawed war as a means to settling international disputes), and to revive Japanese patriotism, especially in reverence for the Emperor.Harvey, p. 362. He entered the Diet of Japan as a member of the House of Representatives for the Democratic Party. \\"As a freshman lawmaker in 1951, he delivered a 28-page letter to General MacArthur criticising the occupation, a brazen move. The General angrily threw the letter in [the] bin, Yasuhiro was later told. This stand established [Yasuhiro Nakasone's] credentials as a right-wing politician.\\" He gained brief notoriety in 1952 for blaming Emperor Hirohito for Japan's defeat in the war.Bix, H.P. Hirohito, 2000. page 649. In 1955, at Nakasone's urging, the government granted the equivalent of $14,000,000 to the Agency for Industrial Science and Technology to begin nuclear power research.Daniel P. Aldrich, With a Mighty Hand, New Republic Nakasone rose through the LDP's ranks, becoming Minister of Science in 1959 under the government of Nobusuke Kishi, then Minister of Transport in 1967, Director General of the Japan Defense Agency from 1970 to 1971, Minister of International Trade and Industry in 1972 and Minister of Administration in 1981. As the head of the Self-Defence Force, Nakasone argued for an increase in defence spending from less than 1% GDP to 3% of GDP. He was also in favour of Japan having tactical nuclear weapons.Harvey, p. 363. He was labelled \\"the weathervane\\" in 1972 because he switched his support from Takeo Fukuda to Kakuei Tanaka in the leadership election, ensuring Tanaka's victory. In turn, Tanaka would give his powerful support to Nakasone against Fukuda a decade later in the fight for the premiership. Premiership In 1982, Nakasone became prime minister. Along with Minister of Foreign Affairs Shintaro Abe, Nakasone improved Japanese relations with the USSR and the People's Republic of China. Nakasone was best known for his close relationship with U.S. President Ronald Reagan, popularly called the \\"Ron-Yasu\\" friendship. Nakasone sought a more equal relationship with the United States, and said: \\"President Reagan is the pitcher and I'm the catcher. When the pitcher gives the signs, I'll co-operate unsparingly, but if he doesn't sometimes follow the catcher's signs, the game can't be won\\".Harvey, p. 365. Nakasone said Japan would be \\"America's unsinkable aircraft carrier\\" in the Pacific and that Japan would \\"keep complete control of the four straits that go through to Japanese islands, to prevent the passage of Soviet submarines\\". He was attacked by political opponents as a reactionary and a \\"dangerous militarist\\". Nakasone responded by saying: \\"A nation must shed any sense of ignominy and move forward seeking glory\\". However his attempt to amend Article 9 failed. In 1984, Nakasone visited China on the twelfth anniversary of Japan's diplomatic recognition of the People's Republic, for which the Chinese government arranged tours of China for 3,000 Japanese youths. On the trip, Nakasone's son was privately accompanied by the daughter of Hu Yaobang, the-then General Secretary of the Communist Party of China. After the event, Hu was criticised by other members of the Chinese Communist Party for the extravagance and warmth of the event. Nakasone also visited President Corazon Aquino in a series of talks between the Philippines and Japan during a special state visit from 1986‚Äì87, to provide good economic and trade relations. In economic affairs, Nakasone's most notable policy was his privatisation initiative, which led to the breakup of Japan National Railways into the modern Japan Railways Group. This led to 80,000 redundancies, unheard of in Japan until that point.Harvey, p. 369. Nakasone wrote of his economic reforms: > I was carrying out a kind of \\"improvement\\" of Japan's structure. For 110 > years, ever since the Meiji restoration, Japan had been striving to catch up > with America and Britain. In the 1970s we did catch up. Beyond that point > the [state's] regulations only stand in the way of the growth of the > economy. If government officials have too much power, the private sector of > the economy will not grow. We had to change the system.Harvey, p. 364. For the first time in Japan's post-war history, bureaucrats lost their leading role. In 1985, Nakasone appointed the former Governor of the Bank of Japan, Haruo Maekawa, to head a commission on Japan's economic future. In 1986, the Commission recommended that Japan should grow not through exports (which were angering Japan's trading partners) but from within. Nakasone advised the Japanese public to purchase foreign imports; in a well-publicised shopping trip, he bought an American tennis racket, an Italian tie and a French shirt. He said: \\"Japan is like a mah-jong player who always wins. Sooner or later the other players will decide that they do not want to play with him\\". The Japanese public were skeptical but the Commission created a good impression abroad, especially in America, where the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs W. Allen Wallis called it a watershed in Japan's post-war economic policy. Nakasone also became known for having a nationalist attitude and for wanting to stimulate ethnic pride amongst the Japanese.Wolferen, p. 267. He was an adherent to the nihonjinron theory that claims Japan is incomparably different from the rest of the world.Wolferen, p. 264. Influenced by Japanese philosopher Tetsuro Watsuji, Nakasone believed that Japan's \\"monsoon culture\\" inspired a special Japanese compassion, unlike the desert culture of the Middle East that produced the Judeo-Christian \\"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth\\". In a speech in 1986, Nakasone said it was Japan's international mission to spread the monsoon culture abroad. On 15 August 1985, the fortieth anniversary of Japan's surrender; Nakasone and his Cabinet visited the Yasukuni Shrine in full mourning dress. This had great symbolic significance as he visited the shrine in his official capacity and demonstrated that the Japanese government was reasserting its respect for the spirits of the ancestors killed in battle, including those who died in World War II.Harvey, p. 367. This was a controversial move and was criticised by the Chinese Communist Party newspaper, People's Daily. It was also attacked by opponents at home for violating the Constitution's separation of religion and state. Nakasone defended his actions by saying, \\"The true defence of Japan ... becomes possible only through the combination of liberty-loving peoples who are equal to each other ... The manner is desired to be based on self- determination of the race\\". He also said, \\"It is considered progressive to criticise pre-war Japan for its faults and defects, but I firmly oppose such a notion. A nation is still a nation whether it wins or loses a war\\".Harvey, p. 368. Nakasone also sought educational reform, setting up a commission. Its report recommended that \\"a spirit of patriotism\\" should be inculcated in children, along with respect for elders and authority. This was not fully implemented and came under attack from the teachers' trade union. The commission also recommended that the national anthem should be taught and that the Rising Sun Flag should also be raised during entrance and graduation ceremonies. History textbooks were also reformed. In 1986, Nakasone dismissed his Education Minister, Masayuki Fujio, after he justified Japan's annexation of Korea in 1910. Nakasone aroused controversy in September 1986 when he claimed that Americans were, on average, less intelligent than Japanese because: \\"the US has many immigrants, Puerto Ricans and Blacks, who bring the average level down\\". He then clarified his comments, stating that he meant to congratulate the U.S. on its economic success despite the presence of \\"problematic\\" minorities. In 1987, he was forced to resign after he attempted to introduce a value added tax to reduce the burden of direct taxes in a policy designed to cut the budget deficit.

Although he remained in the Diet for another decade and a half, his influence gradually waned. In 2003, despite a fight, Nakasone was not given a place on the LDP's electoral list as the party, by then led by Jun'ichir≈ç Koizumi, introduced an age limit of 73 years for candidates in the proportional representation blocks, ending his career as a member of the Diet. On 11 February 1945, Nakasone married Tsutako Nakasone (30 October 1921 ‚Äì 7 November 2012). Nakasone's son, Hirofumi Nakasone, is also a member of the Diet; he has served as Minister of Education and as Minister of Foreign Affairs. In 2010, \\"aware of his status as one of the few leaders revered across Japan's suddenly fractured political landscape\\" and the country's \\"most revered elder statesman\\", Nakasone launched a series of interviews to address the direction of prime minister Yukio Hatoyama's government. In a profile at that time, he saw Hatoyama's \\"inexperienced left-leaning\\" government as \\"challenging Japan's postwar political order and its close relationship with the United States\\". As well, the LDP was \\"crumbling into disarray\\" in the wake of Hatoyama's victory. In the profile, Nakasone described the moment \\"as a national opening on par with the wrenching social and political changes that followed defeat in the [world] war [and] praised the appearance of a strong second political party as a step toward true democracy\\". \\"Being knocked out of power is a good chance to study in the cram school of public opinion\\", he was quoted as saying of the LDP. He \\"faulted Mr. Hatoyama for giving Washington the impression that [Hatoyama] valued ties with China more than he did those with the United States. 'Because of the prime minister‚Äôs imprudent remarks, the current situation calls for Japan to make efforts to improve things,' he said. The [Japanese] relationship with the United States is different from that with China, he said, because 'it is built on a security alliance, and not just on the alliance, but on the shared values of liberal democracy, and on its shared ideals.'\\" And relative to another high-profile current source of friction between Japan and the United States, Nakasone said: \\"Problems like Okinawa [and the American military base there] can be solved by talking together.\\" Death Nakasone died in Tokyo on 29 November 2019, at the age of 101 years and 186 days. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former Japanese prime minister as well as the oldest living former state leader in the world, following the death of Sudan‚Äôs Babiker Awadalla on 17 January 2019.

The rhyme scheme of these lines is ABABBCBCC.Spenserian stanza, poetic form at Encyclopaedia Britannica.Spenserian stanza at Poetry Foundation.

Possible influences Spenser's invention may have been influenced by the Italian form ottava rima, which consists of eight lines of iambic pentameter with the rhyme scheme ABABABCC. This form was used by Spenser's Italian role models Ludovico Ariosto and Torquato Tasso. Another possible influence is rhyme royal, a traditional medieval form used by Geoffrey Chaucer and others, which has seven lines of iambic pentameter that rhyme ABABBCC. More likely, however, is the eight-line ballad stanza with the rhyme scheme ABABBCBC, which Chaucer used in his Monk's Tale. Spenser would have been familiar with this rhyme scheme and simply added a line to the stanza, forming ABABBCBCC.A Spenser Handbook, by H.S.V. Jones.

ISKCON was founded in 1966 in New York City by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. Its core beliefs are based on the Vedic scriptures, particularly the Bhagavad Gita and the Bhagavata Purana, and the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition, which has had adherents in India since the late 15th century and American and European devotees since the early 1900s.Bharati, Baba Premanand . Hinduism.enacademic.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-26. The organization was formed to spread the practice of Bhakti yoga, the practice of love of God in which those involved (bhaktas) dedicate their thoughts and actions towards pleasing Krishna, the Supreme Lord. Its most rapid expansions in membership as of 2007 have been within India and especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union, in Russia, Ukraine, and the rest of the ex-Soviet aligned states of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Today, it has around a million congregational members worldwide including 15,000 in the United Kingdom as of June 2019,Profile of ISKOC on Religion Media Centre and despite the \\"relatively small number of followers in the West (around a few thousand fulltime practitioners)\\", it has been described as influential.Malory Nye, Religion: The Basics, Routledge, 2008, chapter 2 History and belief Pancha-Tattva deities: Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Nityananda, Advaita Acharya, Gadadhara and Srivasa, installed in a Gaudiya Vaishnava temple ISKCON's Bhajan during Navratri Golu at Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India ISKCON devotees follow a disciplic line of Gaudiya Bhagavata Vaishnavas and are the largest branch of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. Vaishnavism means 'worship of Vishnu', and Gau·∏ça refers to the area where this particular branch of Vaishnavism originated, in the Gauda region of West Bengal. Gaudiya Vaishnavism has had a following in India, especially West Bengal and Odisha, for the past five hundred years. Gaudiya Vaishnavism was founded by the saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu who rapidly spread his form of ecstatic bhakti (devotion) throughout Bengal. He established Sankirtan, the practice of publicly expressing devotion to Lord Krishna, the Supreme God, through dance and song. This form of communal worship responded to rigid caste structures by engaging all people in worship regardless of caste and creed. Chaitanya emphasized chanting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra (the 'great mantra'). He is considered by Gaudiya Vaishnavas to be an incarnation of Krishna himself. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada brought Chaitanya's Gaudiya Vaishnavism to the West in 1965. At 69 years old, he landed in New York without any money. Instead of preaching to New York's elite, he tapped into the 1960s countercultural spirit by preaching and chanting in public parks and attracting hippies and the youth. His movement, then known as the \\"Hare Krishna Movement\\", grew even larger when he relocated to San Francisco a year later. When it spread to England, it gained publicity and financial backing from the Beatles' George Harrison. He recorded several tracks with the Hare Krishnas and included the Mahamantra in his hit track \\"My Sweet Lord\\". The first Hare Krishna commune, New Vrindavan (West Virginia), was established by Prabhupada in 1968. Since then, ISKCON has established more than 600 centers all over the world and has millions of followers. Key to the spread of Gaudiya Vaishnava theology in the Western world was Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada's extensive writings and translations,A Hinduism, Page 8, Lynne Gibson, 2002 including the Bhagavad Gita As It Is, Srimad Bhagavatam (Bhagavata Purana), Chaitanya Charitamrita, and other scriptures. These works are now available in more than seventy languages and serve as the scriptures of ISKCON. ISKCON describes Krishna as the source of all the avatars of God. Thus ISKCON devotees worship Krishna as the highest form of God, svayam bhagavan, and often refer to him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead in writing, which was a phrase coined by Prabhupada in his books on the subject. To devotees, Radha represents Krishna's divine female counterpart, the original spiritual potency, and the embodiment of divine love. The individual soul is an eternal personal identity which does not ultimately merge into a non-dual consciousness (Brahman) as believed by the monistic (Advaita) schools of Hinduism. Prabhupada most frequently offers Sanatana-dharma and Varnashrama dharma as more accurate names for the religious system which accepts Vedic authority. It is a monotheistic tradition which has its roots in the theistic Vedanta traditions.  Practices  Statue of Srila Prabhupada founder of ISKCON. Hare Krishna Ratha-Yatra through the streets of Boston, Massachusetts. The most famous and publicly recognizable ISKCON practice is kirtan, a congregational chanting or singing of the Hare Krishna mantra. It's both a way to express devotion to God and a way to attract newcomers to the movement. Devotees gather in public, in streets and parks, to sing the mantra accompanied by instruments like the mridanga, hand cymbals, and the harmonium. During the 1970s ISKCON entered the public eye because of this practice. Devotees would sing, distribute books, and proselytize in airports and other public areas, often obtrusively. Sankirtan continues throughout the world today, but in a less confrontational manner. Other important religious practice within ISKCON and Gaudiya Vaishnavism is japa, or the meditative practice of repeatedly chanting the names of Krishna on a rosary. It's considered the only way for salvation for people in the current age. Prabhupada established a standard for initiated devotees to chant sixteen rounds of the Hare Krishna a day.H√ºsken, Ute, and Christiane Brosius, eds. Ritual matters: dynamic dimensions in practice. Routledge, 2010. Each round requires chanting the mahamantra 108 times on prayer beads, with sixteen rounds being 1728 repetitions and taking around two hours. Another important practice in ISKCON is arati (also called puja). In arati, devotees offer water, incense, a fire lamp, and flowers to a murti, a sacred statue or image of Krishna. This is accompanied by prayers and devotional songs called bhajans. Practitioners may perform arati at their own home or congregate at a temple to join in the ceremony. Along with this worship, devotees will bathe the murti, dress it, offer it food, and even put it to sleep. By doing arati and serving the murti, devotees aim to deepen their relationship with Krishna. ISKCON devotees meet regularly (typically on Sunday at a program known as the Sunday Feast) to worship deities, listen to discourses by senior devotees, participate in kirtan and eat sanctified offered food. = Four Regulative Principles = During initiation (diksha) ISKCON devotees vow to follow four basic rules and regulations, They are- * to follow a lacto-vegetarian krishna prasadam diet * not to consume any intoxicants (alcohol, cigarettes or drugs) * not to gamble * not to engage in 'illicit sex'. = Festivals = Besides weekly gatherings, devotees within the ISKCON movement celebrate a diverse array of Hindu festivals, including Janmashtami, Radhashtami, Diwali, Gaura Purnima, Ekadasi, Holi, Rama Navami, and Gita Jayanti. The Ratha Yatra Festival of Chariots is an annual parade whereby devotees chant and dance on the street, pulling a chariot with the deities of Lord Jagannatha, Baladeva, and Subhadra behind them. This public procession is typically followed by performances and free vegetarian food. = Preaching = ISKCON advocates preaching.ISKON LAWBOOK, Section 4.3, International Society For Krishna Consciousness, http://krishna.ie/images/docs/2009-10-19-IskconLawBook.pdf, Publication October 19, 2009 Members try to spread Krishna consciousness primarily by singing the Hare Krishna mantra in public places and by selling books written by the founder.Krishna Consciousness in the West ‚Äì David G. Bromley, Prof. Larry D. Shinn, 1989, Page 149 A study conducted by E. Burke Rochford Jr. at the University of California found that there are four types of contact between those in ISKCON and prospective members. Those are individually motivated contact, contact made with members in public areas, contact made through personal connections, and contact with sympathizers of the movement who strongly encourage people to join.Rochford, E Burke, Jr.Recruitment Strategies, Ideology, and Organization in the Hare Krishna Movement _Social Problems Vol.29, No 4_ 1982 According to the doctrine of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, one does not need to be born in a Hindu family to take up the practice. There are ISKCON communities around the world with schools, restaurants, and farms.  Centers worldwide  A Russian Hare Krishna girl = India = India has the highest density of ISKCON centers in the world, with over 150 temples, 12 state-recognized educational institutions, 25 affiliated and non-affiliated restaurants, and a number of tourist and pilgrimage hotels. It is also home to Govardhan Eco-Village, an ayurvedic treatment and retreat center near Mumbai. ISKCON India has been known to espouse more traditional orthodox Vedic values than its Western counterparts. Shri Mayapur Chandroya Mandir Temple of the Vedic Planetarium, Mayapur Set to be completed in 2022, the Sri Mayapur Chandroya Mandir in West Bengal is built in the birthplace of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the founder of the Gaudiya-Vaishnava lineage of Hinduism. The temple itself currently sits at 425 000 square feet and is 340 feet tall, and is surrounded by accompanying lodges, shops, residences, educational centers, and gardens. The project cost an estimated $75 million, with its‚Äô major investor being Alfred B. Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford. The complex ‚Äòs main attraction is a planetarium based on Vedic cosmology as well as exhibitions about the Vedic arts, sciences, and culture as described in the Srimad Bhagavatam. After completion, the temple will be the biggest in the world, second to Angkor Wat in Cambodia. Sri Sri Krishna Balarama Mandir, Vrindavan Located in the Raman Reti area of Vrindavan, Uttar Pradesh, the temple was built in the original village where the spiritual figures Krishna and Balarama are said to have resided in the Vedic period of Indian history. It is built in close proximity to other holy sites such as the village of Gokul, Govardhana Hill, the Mathura palace, and various holy lakes. As a result, ISKCON Vrindavan is a common pilgrimage site for followers of the Krishna Conscious movement. The complex is home to a guesthouse, a museum, gift shops, a restaurant, a bakery, a broadcast studio as well as a marble temple hall. The temple is also affiliated with the Vrindavan Institute of Higher Education. Vrindavan Chandrodaya Mandir, Bangalore One of the ISKCON temples in Bengaluru, India. Overseen by ISKCON Bangalore, the VCM is currently under construction and slated to be the tallest religious monument in the world, featuring a helipad, theme park, museum, accommodation, wooded, and park area, and temple. Sri Sri Parthasarathi Mandir, New Delhi The temple complex houses the Glory of India Vedic Cultural center, which is a set of interactive educational exhibits, as well as the world‚Äôs largest printed religious book, known as the ‚ÄúAstounding Bhagavad Gita‚Äù. Sri Sri Radha Madhav Sundar Mandir, Siliguri This temple is located at Siliguri and known as Gupta Nabadweep Dham. = Europe = There are over 135 ISKCON-affiliated temples and cultural centers in Europe. The ISKCON movement in Europe is home to a number of rural and farming communities, including Nueva Vrajamandala in Spain, La Nouvelle Mayapura in France, and Villa Vrindavan in Italy. Radhadesh, Belgium The Radhadesh temple in Durbuy, Belgium, is home to Bhaktivedanta College, which opened in 2002 to provide ministerial and spiritual education for students, offering degrees and certificates online and on-campus in Vaishnava theology externally validated by the University of Chester.Bhaktivedanta College in BelgiumThe Radhadesh temple is also home to Radhadesh Mellows, an annual kirtan retreat. Bhaktivedanta Manor, Watford A landscaped property featuring gardens, lakes, a school, farm, numerous temple and housing buildings, accommodations, and a bakery, the property for Bhaktivedanta Manor was donated by George Harrison of the Beatles and is on the National Heritage List for England. The houses on the property, including the temple, are built in the mock-Tudor mansion style of the 1800s. Bhaktivedanta Manor is also home to the London College of Vedic Studies, and is the birthplace of the Avanti Schools Trust, a sponsor of state-funded primary and secondary schools that provides both non-denominational and Hindu- faith education throughout the UK. Demographically, devotees in Europe are majority of ethnic Europeans. An exception can be made with the demographics of devotees in the United Kingdom, which caters to the Indian immigrant population, mirroring the demographics of most North American centers. = North and South America = There are 56 formally affiliated ISKCON centers in the United States. Notable centers include New Raman Reti in Alachua, FL, and The Radha Kalachandji Temple in Dallas, TX. Hare Krishna-affiliated full-time communities include New Vrindaban in West Virginia, and Gita Nagari Eco Farm and Sanctuary in Pennsylvania. There are various other centers in the United States that promote Krishna Conscious culture without being formally affiliated with ISKCON, including The Bhakti Center in New York City. The ISKCON Dallas temple is affiliated with the nearby TKG Academy, which provides private school academic education with additional Vedic-based courses. There are 12 ISKCON centers in Canada, including the self-sustaining Saranagati Eco Village in BC. There are 5 formally affiliated ISKCON centers in Mexico. There are 60 affiliated ISKCON temples in South America, with most congregations located in Argentina and Brazil. There are also a number of devotee-run farming communities throughout Latin America. = Asia, Africa, and Australasia = Asia is home to over 80 ISKCON affiliated centers, with most being located in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. There are 31 additional centers in Russia, as Vaishnava Hinduism represents one of the largest denominations of faith in the country. There are 69 affiliated ISKCON centers in Africa, four of which are rural farming communities and three of which are educational centers. ISKCON Durban hosts the world's largest Ratha Yatra Chariot Festival outside of India. There are six ISKCON centers, including one farming village in Australia and four temple centers in New Zealand. The Hare Krishna Temple in Christchurch, New Zealand, distributed free meals to mourners and the local Muslim community after a mosque shooting in March 2019.  Kirtan and music influence  The practice of mantra meditation, also known as kirtan, is prominent in the ISKCON movement. Dedicated kirtan festivals are held annually around the world, such as the Sadhu Sanga Retreat in Boone, North Carolina, Kirtan 50 in Dallas, Texas, and Radhadesh Mellows, in Durbuy, Belgium. Notable kirtaneers include Jahnavi Harrison, Gaura Vani, and the Mayapuris, who have all released kirtan albums. Kirtan sessions are also held outside of temple settings, including at a local university ‚ÄúBhakti Clubs‚Äù, mantra lounges, and at a yoga and wellness festivals. Full theatrical performances have been produced based on the Vedic theologies. Prominent performance companies include Viva Kultura and Vande Arts.  Vegetarianism  Vegetarianism is one of the four tenets of ISKCON. With respect to AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada's focus on food distribution, many ISKCON devotees have opened vegan and vegetarian eateries based on the Vedic non-violent eating principles. These include the informal ‚ÄúGovindas‚Äô‚Äù food chain, Doughnut Plant, Divya‚Äôs Kitchen NYC and OmNom Enlightened Eating. Not all restaurants opened by ISKCON members are officially affiliated with ISKCON, although many Govindas‚Äô restaurants or catering businesses operate out of the main temple center. Charitable projects = Cow Protection and ISCOWP = ISCOWP (International Society for Cow Protection) was designed to ‚Äúpresent alternatives to agricultural and dietary practices that support and depend upon the meat and dairy industries‚Äô slaughter of innocent animals, specifically the cow‚Äù. Their philosophy of ‚Äúcompassionate cow protection‚Äù stems from the Hindu Vedic value of ahimsa, or non-violence, and the deity Krishna's affection for cows and butter. ISCOWP believes that ‚Äúthe tenets of cow protection are universal and non-sectarian, available to all regardless of race, creed, or nationality‚Äù. ISKCON has a number of cow protection farms and centers known as ‚Äúgoshalas‚Äù around the world in farming communities and temples. In 2018, Gita Nagari Eco Farm and Sanctuary was the only USDA-Certified slaughter-free dairy production facility in the United States. = ISKCON Tribal Care Trust = ISKCON Tribal Care Trust (ITCT) is an ISKCON affiliate which aims at providing socio-economic development to the tribal people. The trust has set up schools and potable water sources for the tribal people They also distribute blankets and study materials to the tribal communities. = Food For Life Global = Member of Food for Life Russia giving food. Managed by ISKCON devotees but ultimately unaffiliated with the ISKCON movement, Food For Life Global is a not-for- profit vegan food relief organization with 211 international affiliates. The organization predicts Food for Life volunteers distribute 2,000,000 free meals daily through outreach to the homeless, school lunch programs, orphanages and for victims of natural disasters. Notable missions include food distribution during the Chechen WarsNew York Times, December 12, 1995 and during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. There is internal debate as to whether food distribution efforts should be required to include religious preaching, prayer or book distribution, but as of 2020 this is not mandated by the organization. However, food distributed in these missions, as per customs of the ISKCON movement, is often offered to temple deities prior to distribution. Management structure Hare Krishna devotee. ISKCON Mayapur Main Gate Bhaktivedanta Swami spent much of the last decade of his life setting up the institution of ISKCON.Knot, Kim \\"Insider and Outsider Perceptions of Prabhupada\\" in ISKCON Communications Journal Vol. 5, No 1, June 1997: \\"In an evaluation of the nature of the guru, Larry Shinn, a scholar of religions, utilised Max Weber's analysis of charisma in order to understand Prabhupada and the issue of leadership in ISKCON. He noted that 'Prabhupada profited from two intertwined sources of authority' (1987:40), the traditional authority of the disciplic lineage, parampara, inherited from his own guru, and his own charismatic authority, derived from his spiritual attainment and presence ... (49) Shinn offered an analysis based on sociological rather than spiritual (Vaishnava) authority in order to make sense of the role of guru in ISKCON and the unique qualities of Prabhupada.\\" See also Larry D. Shinn (1987), The Dark Lord: Cult Images and the Hare Krishnas in America. Philadelphia: The Westview Press.available online The Governing Body Commission (or GBC) was created by him in 1970. In a document Direction of Management written on 28 July 1970 Prabhupada appointed twelve members to the commission, all of them non- sannyasi, including Satsvarupa dasa Goswami, Hansadutta Swami, and Tamala Krishna Goswami. The letter outlined the purposes of the commission: improving the standard of temple management, the spread of Krishna consciousness, the distribution of books and literature, the opening of new centers and the education of the devotees. GBC has since grown in size to include 48 senior members from the movement who make decisions based on consensus of opinion.A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. Letter of 28 July 1970. \\"As we have increased our volume of activities, now I think a Governing Body Commission (hereinafter referred to as the G.B.C.) should be established. I am getting old, 75 years old, therefore at any time I may be out of the scene, therefore I think it is necessary to give instruction to my disciples how they shall manage the whole institution. They are already managing individual centers represented by one president, one secretary and one treasurer, and in my opinion they are doing nice. But we want still more improvement in the standard of Temple management, propaganda for Krishna consciousness, distribution of books and literatures, opening of new centers and educating devotees to the right standard.\\" =Succession of teachings= tulasi wood given by an ISKCON Guru at the initiation to an ISKCON devotee of Krishna. ISKCON's founder A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada claimed to belong to the traditional system of paramparƒÅ, or disciplic succession, in which teachings upheld by scriptures are handed down from master to disciple, generation after generation.  Specialty programming  = Youth Ministry = Most ISKCON temples offer Sunday School services for children of devotees during the weekly program. The curriculum of these classes may vary by location. ISKCON Pandava Sena Based out of Bhaktivedanta Manor of Watford UK, ISKCON Pandava Sena is a youth organization that aims to ‚Äúconnect like-minded souls to the timeless philosophy of the Vedas‚Äù. The organization started in 1994 and is now composed of a variety of professionals and university students that host annual international mentorship and reunion retreats and weekly social gatherings. Pandava Sena has also established ‚ÄúKCSocs‚Äù or ‚ÄúKrishna Conscious Societies‚Äù across 30 universities in the UK, bringing spirituality-based programming to students and working professionals. Many universities have similar student groups featuring youth from local ISKCON temples congregating for yoga, vegan food, or mantra meditation based on the KCSoc model. The Sanga Initiative is a similar organization that is based in the United States and hosts an annual youth retreat and camping trip for ISKCON children called Camp Ignite. Youth Bus Tour Also known as the Krishna Culture Festival Tours, these tours occur multiple times a year and invite students and young professionals in the bhakti tradition to take cultural performances and services to various locations, including Puerto Rico, the Caribbean, Mexico, Australia, China, Scandinavia, and Canada. There are various age and gender-specific groups available for tour participation. = ISKCON Vaishnavi Ministry = Women's roles are a controversial issue within ISKCON, and its members have strongly divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of Srila Prabhupada's teachings on gender roles. While some of its leaders advocate that women should take public leadership roles, other leaders disagree, and maintain that \\"traditional\\" roles for women are more appropriate. They fear an undesirable influence of secular feminism within ISKCON. According to the essay \\"Women in ISKCON in Prabhupada's times\\" written by Jyotirmayi Devi Dasi, women are renowned within ISKCON and regarded as completely equal in regards to spirituality. Prabhupada in his original writings encouraged the complete equality of women in the eye of Krishna based on the teachings of Bhagavad Gita that soul does not have any gender and everybody is eligible for spiritual liberation. Since mother is the most respected position in Vedic culture, women within the Hare Krishna community are all viewed as mothers, especially by celibate male members brahmacharis. \\"Mother is a term of respect for women in the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), and is often prefixed to the Sanskrit name they receive in initiation. Even unmarried women are referred to as mothers\\".Malati Devi Dasi is the first woman appointed to the ISKCON Governing Body Commission (GBC) After years of discussion and reforms, a general consensus emerged to accept women as leaders and initiators in ISKCON. In 1998 Malati Devi Dasi became the first woman appointed to the GBC.Rochford (2007) p. 148 NYU Press The second woman leader, Dina Sharana, was selected in 2009.\\"Women in ISKCON \\" by Visakha Dasi and Sudharma Dasi An updated document was released by the GBC in 2019 stating that it was permissible for women to become initiating gurus within the ISKCON movement. The Ministry was developed to account for the growing interest of female devotees to partake in temple practices and ensure representation in decision making. = ISKCON Child Protection Office = A suit for $900 million was filed in Texas State Court by alleged victims of abuse in the temples' schools in the 1970s and 1980s. ISKCON had to later file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Known as the Turley Case, the eventual 2008 settlement was $15 million. In 1998, ISKCON published an expos√© of widespread physical, emotional and sexual abuse of children in the group's boarding schools in the United States and India. The Hare Krishna monks and young devotees caring for the children had no training in the task and often resented having to perform it, the report said. At a meeting in 1996, former Krishna pupils testified that they had been regularly beaten at school, denied medical care, and sexually molested and raped. The ISKCON Central Office of Child Protection was established by the GBC in 1997, and in 2005, released its first official Child Protection Policy and Procedure Guidelines. The CPO has provided Child Protection Information Training to over 500 child care providers within the organization internationally and continues to file and review reports on local Child Protection Teams. The Child Protection Policy and Procedure Guidelines was revised and ratified by the GBC in June 2018. = Significant Organizations = * The Grihastha Vision Team provides premarital, parenting and family counselling services to members of any Vaishnava community. The team is made up of volunteers who are mental health and/or educational professionals outside of the religious community. * The Bhaktivedanta Medical Associations‚Äô mission is to ‚Äùconnect and inspire all devotees within the medical profession; to improve our practice of Krishna consciousness; to assist one another to improve our service to Srila Prabhupada: and the expand Krishna consciousness among medical professionals.‚Äù Based in the US, the BMA hosts an annual medical conference for physicians and medical students with accredited North American hospitals and medical schools. Areas of interest include ayurvedic and natural health, mental health, physician burnout, meditation research, and dietary research. * Started in 2002, ISKCON Resolve is a ‚Äúneutral, confidential and informal‚Äù conflict- resolution service for ISKCON congregation members and leaders. Services provided include ombudsman services, conflict mediation services, and self- help tools. *The ISKCON Domestic Abuse Coalition's mission is \\"to raise awareness of [domestic abuse] within ISKCON and provide valuable resources for victims, leadership and the community at large.\\" The group formed in 2019 to release a statement denouncing all forms of domestic violence and mistreatment of women within the ISKCON movement.  Relationship with other Religions  ISKCON has a friendly relationship with other Religious societies seeing them as contributing in inculcating spiritual values in people. In a historic first, ISKCON brought together the four Vaishnava Sampradayas for a Sankirtan festival in the year 2015. It also has been organizing Vaishnava-Christian dialogues in the West for over 30 years to explore common ground between the two personalistic faiths. In India they have been organized from 2015 onwards.  Controversies  ISKCON has experienced a number of significant internal problems, the majority of which occurred from the late seventies onwards, and especially within the decade following Prabhupada's death. ISKCON has also been scrutinised by some anti-cult movements. * In a landmark 1976 case, People vs. Murphy, the Supreme Court of New York found that \\"'the Hare Krishna religion is a bona fide religion with roots in India that go back thousands of years.\\" Although the parents of two Hare Krishna members claimed ISKCON had brainwashed their children, the court found they had not and that their children had freely followed the tenets of their chosen faith. * A brainwashing lawsuit filed by an Orange County mother and daughter, Robin George, in 1977 led to numerous appeals reaching the Supreme Court. In a long- awaited ruling on religious liberty, the state appeals court dismissed a claim that the Hare Krishna sect brainwashed a 15-year-old girl. In addition to the brainwashing claim, the 4th District Court of Appeal dismissed claims that they intentionally caused Robin George emotional distress and libeled her. * Kirtanananda Swami, or Swami Bhaktipada, a leader of ISKCON, was expelled from the organisation in 1987 for various deviations; he pleaded guilty before his 1996 retrial to one count of racketeering and after serving 8 years of a 20-year prison sentence was subsequently released in 2004. Previously in 1991 the jury found him not guilty on charges of conspiracy to commit the murders- for-hire of two devotees, but found him guilty of racketeering and mail fraud. These convictions were later overturned on appeal, only to result in the later retrial. Kirtanananda is no longer considered a bonafide ISKCON initiating guru by the movement. The case placed a spotlight on New Vrindaban, which by then had nearly 500 members, making it the largest and most famous Hare Krishna community in the United States at that time. *In the 1990s ISKCON faced accusations of child abuse, and its leaders acknowledged physical, emotional and sexual abuse of children who were sent to live in the movement's boarding schools in the United States and India in the 1970s and 1980s. Several safety regulations and subcommittees, such as ISKCON Resolve and the ISKCON Child Protection Office, have been developed since these allegations to ensure that legal rights as well as the health and safety of devotees . It has also been called for banning in Bangladesh by the Hefazat-e-Islam organisation.

In popular culture The Hare Krishna mantra appears in some famous songs, such as former Beatle George Harrison's 1970 hit \\"My Sweet Lord\\".Graham M. Schweig, \\"Krishna: The Intimate Deity\\", in Bryant and Ekstrand, p. 14. John Lennon included the phrase \\"Hare Krishna\\" in his lyrics to \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" and the Beatles' 1967 track \\"I Am the Walrus\\". The backing vocalists also sing the phrase in Ringo Starr's 1971 hit \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", written with the help of Harrison, although the words were mixed low on the released version. Of the four Beatles, only Harrison fully embraced Krishna Consciousness. He also provided financial support for ISKCON's UK branch and in 1973 purchased Bhaktivedanta Manor as their training center.

The Latin Empire was intended to replace the Byzantine Empire as the recognized Roman Empire in the east, with a Western Catholic emperor enthroned in place of the Eastern Orthodox Roman emperors. The Fourth Crusade had originally been called to retake the Muslim- controlled city of Jerusalem but a sequence of economic and political events culminated in the Crusader army sacking the city of Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire. Originally, the plan had been to restore the deposed Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos, who had been usurped by Alexios III Angelos, to the throne. The crusaders had been promised financial and military aid by Isaac's son Alexios, with which they had planned to continue to Jerusalem. When the crusaders reached Constantinople the situation quickly turned volatile and while Isaac and Alexios briefly ruled, the crusaders did not receive the payment they had hoped for. In April 1204, they captured and plundered the city's enormous wealth. The crusaders selected their own emperor from among their own ranks, Baldwin of Flanders, and divided the territory of the Byzantine Empire into various new vassal crusader states. The Latin Empire's authority was immediately challenged by Byzantine rump states led by the Laskaris family (connected to the Angelos dynasty of 1185‚Äì1204) in Nicaea and the Komnenos family (which had ruled as Byzantine Emperors 1081‚Äì1185) in Trebizond. From 1224 to 1242 the Komnenos Doukas family, also connected to the Angeloi, challenged Latin authority from Thessalonica. The Latin Empire failed to attain political or economic dominance over the other Latin powers that had been established in former Byzantine territories in the wake of the Fourth Crusade, especially Venice, and after a short initial period of military successes it went into a steady decline due to constant war with Bulgaria to the north and the various Byzantine claimants. Eventually, the Nicaean Empire recovered Constantinople and restored the Byzantine Empire under Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261. The last Latin emperor, Baldwin II, went into exile, but the imperial title survived, with several pretenders to it, until the 14th century. Like the term \\"Byzantine Empire\\", \\"Latin Empire\\" was not a contemporary term used by the empire itself or the rest of the world. The Byzantines referred to the Latin Empire as the Frankokratia (Œ¶œÅŒ±Œ≥Œ∫ŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒØŒ±, lit. \\"rule of the Franks\\") or the Latinokratia (ŒõŒ±œÑŒπŒΩŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒØŒ±, lit. \\"rule of the Latins\\") and the Latin Emperors themselves referred to the empire by various names, commonly imperium Constantinopolitanum (lit. Empire of Constantinople), but also imperium Romaniae (lit. Empire of Romania) and imperium Romanorum (lit. Empire of the Romans). The term Romania (\\"Land of the Romans\\") had been used unofficially by the population of the Byzantine Empire for their country for centuries.  Etymology  Philip of Courtenay, Latin Emperor in exile 1273‚Äì1283. His title in the seal is Dei gratia imperator Romaniae et semper augustus (\\"By the Grace of God, Emperor of Romania, ever august\\"). Much like the term \\"Byzantine\\", which was invented in the 16th century, \\"Latin Empire\\" was not a contemporary name used by or for the regime set up by the crusaders of the Fourth Crusade in Constantinople. Instead, both terms were invented much later by historians seeking to differentiate between the classical period of the Roman Empire, the medieval period of the Byzantine Empire, and the late medieval Latin Empire, all of which called themselves \\"Roman\\". The term \\"Latin\\" has been used because the crusaders (Franks, Venetians, and other westerners) were Roman Catholic and used Latin as their liturgical and scholarly language. It is used in contrast to the Eastern Orthodox locals who used Greek in both liturgy and common speech. The Byzantines referred to the Latin Empire as the Frankokratia (Œ¶œÅŒ±Œ≥Œ∫ŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒØŒ±, lit. \\"rule of the Franks\\") or the Latinokratia (ŒõŒ±œÑŒπŒΩŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒØŒ±, lit. \\"rule of the Latins\\"). Founding treaties issued by the crusaders specifically refer to the empire as the imperium Constantinopolitanum (\\"Empire of Constantinople\\"). Although this is a marked departure from the standard Byzantine nomenclature and ideology (designating the empire as the Basile√≠a Rh≈çma√≠≈çn, \\"Empire of the Romans\\"), imperium Constantinopolitanum was the standard name used for the eastern empire in western sources, such as in papal correspondence, and suggests that the Latin leaders viewed themselves as ‚Äútaking over‚Äù the empire rather than ‚Äúreplacing‚Äù it. It would have been difficult for the crusaders to justify referring to the empire as \\"Roman\\" considering that Western Europe generally held the Germanic Holy Roman Empire to represent the legitimate Roman Empire. Baldwin I, the first Latin Emperor. The abbreviation Rom. leaves it open to interpretation if he refers to Romaniae (\\"Romania\\") or Romanorum (\\"the Romans\\").alt= Nevertheless, the crusaders were well aware of the fact that Constantinople was the capital of the Roman Empire and that the Greek- speaking inhabitants of the empire saw themselves as Romaioi (Romans). The full title actually used by the first Latin Emperor, Baldwin I, was Balduinus dei gratia fidelissimus in Christo imperator a Deo coronatus Romanorum moderator et semper augustus. His title is a near perfect replication of the title used by Byzantine Emperor Alexios IV Angelos, placed on the throne by the crusaders previously, in a letter (only known in its Latin version) to Pope Innocent III: fidelis in Christo imperator a Deo coronatus Romanorum moderator et semper augustus. Letters by Baldwin to Pope Innocent III give his title as imperator Constantinopolitanus, possibly altered by Papal scribes as the Pope recognized the Holy Roman Emperor as the imperator Romanorum. In his seals, Baldwin abbreviated Romanorum as Rom., conventiently leaving it open for interpretation whether he referred to Romaniae (\\"land of the Romans\\") or Romanorum (\\"the Romans\\"). It is probably more likely that he meant Romanorum. The term \\"Romania\\" had been used unofficially by the population of the Byzantine Empire for their country for centuries.On the long history of \\"Romania\\" as a territorial name for the Roman and (later) Byzantine empires, see R.L. Wolff, \\"Romania: The Latin Empire of Constantinople\\". In: Speculum, 23 (1948), pp. 1-34.Fossier, Robert; Sondheimer, Janet (1997). The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Middle Ages. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press. . p. 104 Baldwin's successor Henry used three different versions of his imperial title; Henricus Dei Gratia Imperator Romaniae (\\"Emperor of Romania\\"), Henricus Dei Gratia Imperator Romanorum (\\"Emperor of the Romans\\") and Henricus Dei Gratia Imperator Constantinopolitani (\\"Emperor of Constantinople\\"), possibly intended for different recipients. Usage of the title Emperor of Constantinople may not just have been to appease the Pope and Western Europe, but might also have been used to legitimize the rule of the Latin Emperors in regards to the Byzantines that they ruled. Possession of the city itself was a key legitimizing factor that set the Latin Emperors apart from Byzantine claimants in Nicaea, Trebizond and Thessalonica.  History  = Origins = A 19th century tomb marker of the probable location of the tomb of Enrico Dandolo, the leader of the Fourth Crusade and Doge of Venice, inside the Hagia Sophia After the fall of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade, the crusaders agreed to divide up Byzantine territory. In the Partitio terrarum imperii Romaniae, signed on 1 October 1204, three eighths of the empire ‚Äî including Crete and other islands ‚Äî went to the Republic of Venice. The Latin Empire claimed the remainder and exerted control over: * areas of Greece, divided into vassal fiefs: ** the Kingdom of Thessalonica ** the Principality of Achaea ** the Duchy of Athens ** the Duchy of the Archipelago * the short-lived Duchy of Philippopolis in north Thrace Further duchies were projected in Asia Minor, at Nicaea (for Louis of Blois), Nicomedia (Thierry de Loos), Philadelphia (Stephen du Perche), and Neokastra. These duchies remained theoretical, due to the establishment of the Empire of Nicaea in the area. Nicaea itself was never occupied and Louis of Blois was killed in 1205. Thierry de Loos was captured by the Nicaeans in 1207 and, although released, left the Latin Empire two years later. After a brief Nicaean reconquest, Nicomedia returned to Latin control, but the ducatus Nichomedie remained part of the Imperial domain. Philadelphia never came under actual Latin control, although the Latin emperor Henry of Flanders laid claim to the region after defeating the local strongman, Theodore Mangaphas, in 1205. The duchy of Neokastra (ducatus Novi Castri) on the other hand was never accorded to a single holder, but was divided among the Knights Hospitaller (one quarter) and other feudatories. The term \\"duchy\\" in this case reflects the earlier Byzantine use of the term thema, usually governed by a doux, to designate a province. The Doge of Venice did not rank as a vassal to the Latin Empire, but his position in control of three-eighths of its territory and of parts of Constantinople itself ensured Venice's influence in the Empire's affairs. However, much of the former Byzantine territory remained in the hands of rival successor states led by Byzantine Greek aristocrats, such as the Despotate of Epirus, the Empire of Nicaea, and the Empire of Trebizond, each bent on reconquest from the Latins. The crowning of Baldwin I (16 May 1204) and the establishment of the Latin Empire had the curious effect of creating five simultaneously existing entities claiming to be successors of the Roman Empire: the Latin Empire, the Holy Roman Empire, and the three remnants of the Byzantine Empire, the Despotate of Epirus, the Empire of Nicaea, and the Empire of Trebizond. None of these polities actually controlled the city of Rome, which remained under the temporal authority of the Pope. = In Asia Minor = Capture of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204. The initial campaigns of the crusaders in Asia Minor resulted in the capture of most of Bithynia by 1205, with the defeat of the forces of Theodore I Laskaris at Poemanenum and Prusa. Latin successes continued, and in 1207 a truce was signed with Theodore, newly proclaimed Emperor of Nicaea. The Latins inflicted a further defeat on Nicaean forces at the Rhyndakos river in October 1211, and three years later the Treaty of Nymphaeum (1214) recognized their control of most of Bithynia and Mysia. The peace was maintained until 1222, when the resurgent power of Nicaea felt sufficiently strong to challenge the Latin Empire, by that time weakened by constant warfare in its European provinces. At the battle of Poimanenon in 1224, the Latin army was defeated, and by the next year Emperor Robert of Courtenay was forced to cede all his Asian possessions to Nicaea, except for Nicomedia and the territories directly across from Constantinople. Nicaea turned also to the Aegean, capturing the islands awarded to the empire. In 1235, finally, the last Latin possessions fell to Nicaea. = In Europe = Unlike in Asia, where the Latin Empire faced only an initially weak Nicaea, in Europe it was immediately confronted with a powerful enemy: the Bulgarian tsar Kaloyan. When Baldwin campaigned against the Byzantine lords of Thrace, they called upon Kaloyan for help. At the Battle of Adrianople on 14 April 1205, the Latin heavy cavalry and knights were crushed by Kaloyan's troops and Cuman allies, and Emperor Baldwin was captured. He was imprisoned in the Bulgarian capital Tarnovo until his death later in 1205. Kaloyan was murdered a couple of years later (1207) during a siege of Thessalonica, and the Bulgarian threat conclusively defeated with a victory the following year, which allowed Baldwin's successor, Henry of Flanders, to reclaim most of the lost territories in Thrace until 1210, when peace was concluded with the marriage of Henry to Maria of Bulgaria, tsar Kaloyan's daughter. Europe in 1212 At the same time, another Greek successor state, the Despotate of Epirus, under Michael I Komnenos Doukas, posed a threat to the empire's vassals in Thessalonica and Athens. Henry demanded his submission, which Michael provided, giving off his daughter to Henry's brother Eustace in the summer of 1209. This alliance allowed Henry to launch a campaign in Macedonia, Thessaly and Central Greece against the rebellious Lombard lords of Thessalonica. However, Michael's attack on the Kingdom of Thessalonica in 1210 forced him to return north to relieve the city and to force Michael back into submission. In 1214 however, Michael died, and was succeeded by Theodore Komnenos Doukas, who was determined to capture Thessalonica. On 11 June 1216, while supervising repairs to the walls of Thessalonica, Henry died, and was succeeded by Peter of Courtenay, who himself was captured and executed by Theodore the following year. A regency was set up in Constantinople, headed by Peter's widow, Yolanda of Flanders, until her death in 1219. Her son Robert of Courtenay being absent in France, the regency passed first to Conon de B√©thune, and after his death shortly after, to Cardinal Giovanni Colonna, until 1221, when Robert of Courtenay arrived in Constantinople. Distracted by the renewed war with Nicaea, and waiting in vain for assistance from Pope Honorius III and the King of France Philip II, the Latin Empire was unable to prevent the final fall of Thessalonica to Epirus in 1224. Epirote armies then conquered Thrace in 1225‚Äì26, appearing before Constantinople itself. The Latin Empire was saved for a time by the threat posed to Theodore by the Bulgarian tsar Ivan II Asen, and a truce was concluded in 1228. = Decline and fall = After Robert of Courtenay died in 1228, a new regency under John of Brienne was set up. After the disastrous Epirote defeat by the Bulgarians at the Battle of Klokotnitsa, the Epirote threat to the Latin Empire was removed, only to be replaced by Nicaea, which started acquiring territories in Greece. Emperor John III Doukas Vatatzes of Nicaea concluded an alliance with Bulgaria, which in 1235 resulted in a joint campaign against the Latin Empire, and an unsuccessful siege of Constantinople the same year. In 1237, Baldwin II attained majority and took over the reins of a much-diminished state. The empire's precarious situation forced him to travel often to Western Europe seeking aid, but largely without success. In order to raise funds, he was forced to resort to desperate means, from removing the lead roofs of the Great Palace and selling them, to handing over his only son, Philip, to Venetian merchants as a guarantee for a loan. By 1247, the Nicaeans had effectively surrounded Constantinople, with only the city's strong walls holding them at bay, and the Battle of Pelagonia in 1258 signaled the beginning of the end of Latin predominance in Greece. Thus, on 25 July 1261, with most of the Latin troops away on campaign, the Nicaean general Alexios Strategopoulos found an unguarded entrance to the city, and entered it with 800 troops only, restoring the Byzantine Empire for his master, Michael VIII Palaiologos. The remaining Latin states ruled territories of present-day Greece, some of them until the 18th century, and are known as Latinokratia states. = Titular claimants = For about a century thereafter, the heirs of Baldwin II continued to use the title of Emperor of Constantinople, and were seen as the overlords of the various remaining Latin states in the Aegean. They exercised effective authority in Greece only when actually ruling as princes of Achaea, as in 1333‚Äì83.  Organization and society  = Administration = The empire was formed and administered on Western European feudal principles, incorporating some elements of the Byzantine bureaucracy. The emperor was assisted by a council, composed of the various barons, the Venetian Podest√† of Constantinople and his six-member council. This council had a major voice in the governance of the realm, especially in periods of regency, when the Regent (moderator imperii) was dependent on their consent to rule. The podest√†, likewise, was an extremely influential member, being practically independent of the emperor. He exercised authority over the Venetian quarters of Constantinople and Pera and the Venetian dominions within the empire, assisted by a separate set of officials. His role was more that of an ambassador and vicegerent of Venice than a vassal to the empire. The podest√† was granted the title of Governor of One-Fourth and One-Half of the Empire of Romania, and was entitled to wearing the imperial crimson buskins like the emperor.Hazlitt, William Carew. The Venetian Republic: Its Rise, Its Growth, and Its Fall 421-1797. Vol. 1, A. And C. Black, 1900. = Economy = The Latins did not trust the professional Greek bureaucracy, and in the immediate aftermath of the conquest completely dismantled the Greek economic administration of the areas they controlled. The result was disastrous, disrupting all forms of production and trade. Almost from its inception the Latin Empire was sending requests back to the papacy for aid. For a few years, the major commodities it exported from the surrounding region of Thrace were wheat and furs; it also profited from Constantinople's strategic location on major trade routes. While the empire showed some moderate vitality while Henry of Flanders was alive, after his death in 1216 there was a major deficit in leadership. By the 1230s, Constantinople - even with its drastically reduced population - was facing a major shortage of basic foodstuffs. In several senses, the only significant export on which the economy of the Latin Empire had any real basis was the sale of relics back to Western Europe which had been looted from Greek churches. For example, Emperor Baldwin II sold the relic of the Crown of Thorns while in France trying to raise new funds. = Society = The elite of the empire were the Frankish and Venetian lords, headed by the emperor, the barons and the lower-ranking vassals and liege lords, including many former Byzantine aristocrats. The bulk of the people were Orthodox Greeks, still divided according to the Byzantine system in income classes based on land ownership. = Church = As with all Latin states, the Orthodox hierarchy was replaced by Roman Catholic prelates, but not suppressed. An expansive Catholic hierarchy was established, under the dual supervision of the Latin archbishop of Constantinople and the Papal legate, until the two offices were merged in 1231. Western Catholic religious orders, such as the Cistercians, the Dominicans and the Franciscans were established in the empire. The Orthodox clergy retained its rites and customs, including its right to marriage, but was demoted to a subordinate position, subject to the local Latin bishops.

For much of its length, it is classified as a trunk road and therefore managed by Highways England. Almost all of the road has been built to dual carriageway standards or wider. Apart from bypass sections in London, the road travels in a southwest direction and, after Liss, south-southwest. Close to its southerly end, motorway traffic is routed via the A3(M), then either the east-west A27 or the Portsmouth-only M275 which has multiple lanes leading off the westbound A27 -- for non-motorway traffic, the A3 continues into Portsmouth alongside the A3(M), mostly as a single carriageway in each direction through Waterlooville and adjoining small towns. The other section of single carriageways is through the urban environs of Battersea, Clapham and Stockwell towards the northern end, which has to accommodate bus lanes and parking meter bays.The A3(M) at the Portsdown Hill Road Bridge nearing Junction 5 with the A27Northbound near the Wisley Interchange with the M25 History By the 17th century, the historic Portsmouth Road bore great strategic significance as the road link between the capital city and what became the settled main port of the Royal Navy, as well as a non-military port like nearby Chichester -- a petition was passed by Her Majesty for the expansion of the bench of justices of the town of Guildford along its route, in consideration of the importance of the Portsmouth Road, in 1603.'The borough of Guildford: Borough, manors, churches and charities' in A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 3, ed. H E Malden (London, 1911), pp. 560-570. British History Online, University of Portsmouth, the History of Parliament Trust and others accessed 20 November 2016.] Many of the other towns and villages that the road passed through gained income and, in the case of towns, a market advantage as a result ‚Äî principally in the history of Kingston upon Thames, Godalming and Petersfield. The modern A3 follows the general route of the Portsmouth Road, but it bypasses many of the towns and villages along the way, leaving the various stretches of the old route for local traffic ‚Äî for instance, the A307, its original course through Kingston- upon-Thames and Esher, retains its name, Portsmouth Road. A programme of road improvements, starting in the 1920s, transformed the road, so that it is now predominantly a two or three lane carriageway, bypassing the town centres; south of the South Downs National Park, it includes a section of motorway, the A3(M), just before the road reaches the A27 at Havant. The construction of the Kingston and Guildford bypasses in the 1920s and 1930s made use of temporary narrow gauge railways to move the construction materials. The Esher bypass, between Hook from the first mentioned bypass to the M25, is three lanes with a motorway-standard hard shoulder; from there to Guildford the road has three lanes. Lord Montagu of Beaulieu stressed the urgency of building a Kingston By-pass in 1911, but public funds were not secured before the onset of World War I and were not available in the aftermath. By the early 1920s, traffic in Kingston town centre had increased by over 160% in 10 years in the coaching town and the decision was taken in 1923 to revive the plans, with the contract worth ¬£503,000 (). Work started in 1924, and it was opened by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Stanley Baldwin MP, on 28 October 1927. It ran for from the Robin Hood Gate of Richmond Park near to the outskirts of Esher. The opening ceremony concluded with refreshments for 800 guests in marquees near to the northern start/end. Its construction immediately attracted developments of housing where access was easiest. The Restriction of Ribbon Development Act 1935 came too late to prevent this private housing, which is apparent where the A3 winds through Tolworth and New Malden, where the architecture includes concrete to art nouveau apartments, Mock-Tudor gabled houses and gabled Arts and Crafts movement-inspired houses. The road was once the haunt of highwaymen such as Jerry Abershawe, who terrorised the area around Kingston and led a gang based at the Bald Faced Stag Inn on the Portsmouth Road. Another particularly dangerous location was in the vicinity of the wooded crest skirting the Devil's Punch Bowl, Hindhead, about south-west of Guildford. The complexity of the double roundabout at the junction between the A309 Kingston by-pass and the A307 led to it being referred to colloquially as the Silly Isles, later the junction officially adopted the name The Scilly Isles. In 2011, the Hindhead Tunnel became the centrepiece of the Hindhead Bypass, away from the winding road of the small town, where the only urban set of traffic lights on the route outside London had created a bottleneck. Until 2011, the road through Hindhead was the last single carriageway section of the route, outside London and Portsmouth. Route The road follows a route roughly parallel to the Portsmouth Direct Line railway which goes through, rather than past, all of the towns which the road serves, with Havant and Woking and , respectively, off the road. =Greater London= The A3 starts at King William Street at its junction with Gracechurch Street in the City of London, crosses London Bridge while entering the London Borough of Southwark, and goes south- west along Borough High Street and Newington Causeway to the Elephant and Castle roundabout. It continues along Newington Butts, and bounds then enters the London Borough of Lambeth on Kennington Park Road which becomes Clapham Road and Clapham High Street. The A3 then turns west (leaving as its straight continuation the A24) as Clapham Common North Side. Along this road, it enters the London Borough of Wandsworth, after which it runs concurrently with the A205 'South Circular' along Battersea Rise, Wandsworth Common North Side and East Hill, and goes through Wandsworth, and then the A205 carries on west towards Richmond. On West Hill, just east of the Tibbets Corner junction with the A219 near Putney Heath, the road increases from one lane each way to a three-lanes-each-way dual-carriageway and the speed limit increases from 30 mph (48 km/h) to 40 mph (64 km/h). The A3 then continues south-west between Richmond Park and Wimbledon Common, as Kingston Road before beginning to bypass Kingston upon Thames while going through Roehampton Vale. The A3 enters The Royal Borough of Kingston Upon Thames just before Kingston Vale where there is a junction with the A308 for Kingston upon Thames and Richmond Park. The speed limit then increases to 50 mph (80 km/h) before going under the Coombe Flyover. The A3 then goes on a flyover by Shannon Corner in Raynes Park, before having junctions for New Malden, Tolworth and Hook along the Kingston By-pass. Brief features of a section of road contribute to a traffic pinch-point during peak hours around the Hook underpass. The road reduces from three lanes to two in the underpass. The speed limit at this point reduces from to , with the first of a handful of Gatso speed enforcement cameras. If returning to London, traffic from the A309 also joins just before the underpass. = Surrey = The A3's Kingston By-pass now ends sooner leaving a spur junction the A309 to the Scilly Isles junction near Sandown Park, Esher, its route instead becoming the Esher By-pass on the border of Hook, London and Long Ditton, Surrey. After passing Claygate, the motorway-standard section has junctions with the A244 between Esher and Oxshott, then the A245 between Cobham and Hersham. The road's Wisley Interchange with the M25 enables a flyover still with a 70 mph (112 km/h) speed limit. It bypasses Wisley, Ockham, Ripley (and Burpham which is a suburb of Guildford) before cutting through the major town itself as a dual carriageway and changing to a 50 mph (80 km/h) speed limit.\\"Signs to remind drivers to stick to the 50 mile an hour speed limit\\" . Surrey Herald and Surrey Advertiser (getsurrey.co.uk) 6 April 2010. Retrieved 6 January 2013. It returns to 70 mph (112 km/h) at the A31 and A246 junction before bypassing Godalming and Milford. It continues through a tunnel at Hindhead (constructed in 2011 to improve capacity and bypass the Devil's Punch Bowl) before leaving Surrey. =Hampshire= The A3 enters Hampshire just after exiting the Hindhead Tunnel, passes Liphook and Bramshott, turns SSW past Liss, then passes Petersfield. The A3's original route between Hindhead and Petersfield, passing through several villages, became the B2070. At Liss, there remains an at-grade roundabout, the only such junction on the route. Over the South Downs, it passes Clanfield and Horndean. From just north of Horndean, (still heading towards Portsmouth) the A3 separates from the A3(M) (below) and continues as London Road as far as Hilsea, south of which it is Northern Parade. It runs along the west side of Portsea Island which forms Portsmouth proper, roughly parallel with the M275, into the nearly waterfront centre of the city where, after passing the Catholic cathedral, it meets with the A2030. Here, it reaches Old Portsmouth, passing the Anglican cathedral and the 15th century harbour where it comes to an end at Portsmouth Point. Hindhead tunnel The A3 near Hindhead prior to the tunnel opening. The Hindhead Tunnel is a twin bore tunnel, which cost ¬£371 million to construct, and is the longest non-estuarial road tunnel in the UK. Transport Secretary Philip Hammond conducted the opening ceremony on 27 July 2011, though the northbound tunnel opened to traffic two days later than the southbound one, on 29 July. The new dual carriageway diverges from the original route where the old A3 began climbing sharply as it headed towards the scenic Devil's Punch Bowl. The old road now turns right and continues into Highfield Lane. From there, the remainder of the original road to Punch Bowl Common - a short distance north-east of the Hindhead traffic lights - has been completely ripped up and returned to nature. From the south, the short and largely built-up southern stretch of old A3 (now bypassed) runs up from the Grayshott exit into Hindhead and remains in use, but has been renumbered from A3 to A333. Proposed developments =Ham Barn roundabout, Liss= Since the 2013 opening of the Hindhead Tunnel, the modern route (or, in the case of the southernmost section, its associated motorway section) is at least dual- carriageway, but at Liss is the sole at-grade roundabout. Widely considered the main traffic pinch-point and an accident hotspot (due to its unusual egg- shape and camber angle which can cause lorries at excess speed to tip over), there have been wide calls for its removal,Selborne Civil Parish Council - campaign to replace or alter roundabout the projected increase in traffic with the completion of the tunnel supporting the proposal. In November 2010, the Highways Agency announced it would discuss three options for the roundabout's future, but in December it announced that none would be commenced before 2015.:'Ham Barn Options Outlined' 10 Nov 2010, Haslemre Messenger *full-time signalling, *removing the roundabout entirely (and thereby removing the A3/B3006 connection completely), *keeping the existing system. =Cathedral exit, Guildford= The slip road exiting the A3 leading to the Royal Surrey County Hospital and the Surrey Research Park regularly creates congestion on the main A3 during peak times, when the traffic queue reaches onto the main carriageway. In May 2011, it was announced that this is to be resolved with new improvements to the traffic system directly adjacent to the A3, with work funded jointly by the University of Surrey and Surrey County Council. =Related urban proposals and developments= Various schemes exist to manage urban traffic and economise land use, and include running park and ride services. The main such scheme along the route is in Guildford. In February 2015, the Mayor of London Boris Johnson announced plans to build over a short section at Tolworth, after visiting a similar site in Boston, Massachusetts; the Mayor said \\"rebuilding some of our complex and ageing road network underneath our city would not only provide additional capacity for traffic, but it would also unlock surface space and reduce the impact of noise and pollution.\\" Similar plans have been proposed for other areas of London but proven cost-prohibitive. A3(M) This section of the road was opened in 1979 and acts as an alternative to the A3 road in this part of Hampshire. =Junctions= { border=1 cellpadding=2 style=\\"margin-left:1em; margin- bottom: 1em; color: black; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" - style=\\"background:#0080d0; text-align:center; color:white; font-size:120%;\\"  colspan=\\"3\\"  A3(M) motorway - style=\\"background:#000; text-align:center; color:white;\\"  Northbound exits  Junction  Southbound exits - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  Road continues as the A3 to Petersfield and London  rowspan=\\"2\\" A3 Terminus (J1)  Horndean, Clanfield A3 Portsmouth, Hayling Island A3(M) - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  No exit  Start of motorway - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Horndean, Cowplain B2149  J2  Emsworth, Rowlands Castle B2149, Cowplain - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Waterlooville B2150  J3  Waterlooville, Purbrook, Leigh Park B2150 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Purbrook, Leigh Park  J4  No exit - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Start of motorway  rowspan=\\"2\\"J5 Terminus A27  Bedhampton, Farlington, Drayton - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Petersfield, London, Waterlooville, Leigh Park (A3(M)) Bedhampton B2177  Brighton, Chichester, Havant, Hayling Island A27(E) Portsmouth, Southampton (M27) A27(W) } Information above gathered from Advanced Direction Signs April/May 2012 Cycling There are several cycle routes which follow the route of the A3. = London = In London, Cycle Superhighway 7 (CS7) runs either side of the A3 from Elephant and Castle to Clapham Common. The route is signposted and marked using painted blue cycle logos, carrying cyclists through Kennington, Stockwell, and Clapham. North from Elephant and Castle, CS7 runs along the A300/Southwark Bridge Road towards the City. South of Clapham Common, CS7 runs along the A24 to Colliers Wood, via Balham and Tooting. Between Wandsworth and Kingston Vale, a shared- use path runs along side the A3 for cyclists and pedestrians. The path is segregated from other road traffic and links to cycle paths which run alongside the A308/Kingston Hill. This provides Norbiton with a traffic-free route to Wandsworth, which is also the terminus of Cycle Superhighway 8 (CS8 to Millbank). = Surrey and Hampshire = Shared-use paths and cycle lanes run alongside the A3 at points between the Greater London boundary and Portsmouth. Between Thursley and Milford in Surrey, cycle crossings of the slip roads exist for cyclists travelling along the cycle lanes. There is a cycle path between Liss and Petersfield which runs along the Portsmouth-bound (southbound) side of the A3. The route joins the A3 south of West Liss and leaves the dual-carriageway to the north of Petersfield (at Farnham Road). The route between Liss town centre and Farnham Road is part of National Cycle Route 22 (NCR 22). South of Petersfield, National Cycle Route 222 (NCR 222) follows the route of the A3 until the route reaches Waterlooville. The route passes through the Queen Elizabeth Country Park and passes along the eastern rim of Clanfield. The main cycle route between Petersfield and the Country Park follows NCR 22 through Buriton.

As one of the four most prestigious academies over the last 1000 years in China, Yuelu Academy has been a famous institution of higher learning as well as a centre of academic activities and cultures since it was formally set up during the Northern Song dynasty. The academy was converted into Hunan Institute of Higher Learning in 1903. It was later renamed Hunan Normal College, Hunan Public Polytechnic School, and finally Hunan University in 1926. Yuelu Academy was once the center for the pursuit of Chinese ancient learning and idealism in China's feudalist era. History The Academy was founded in 976, the 9th year of the Song dynasty (960-1279) under the reign of Emperor Taizu (960-976), and was one of four most renowned shuyuan (academies of higher learning). The renowned Confucian scholars Zhu Xi and Zhang Shi lectured at the academy. During the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), the Academy inculcated an ascetic philosophy of self-examination and dedication to rescuing the world from the decadence of recent times. The Academy remained loyal to the Neo-Confucian school of the Song dynasty which emphasized moral self-cultivation, community solidarity, and social hierarchy. Among the prominent alumni were the early Qing scholars Wang Fuzhi and Yan Ruyi. But by the early 19th century, Academy scholars saw no contradiction in devoting serious study also to practical subjects such as martial engineering, political economy, waterworks, and management of bureaucracy. They called these studies jingshi (statecraft), made up of the character jing (manage) and shi (things, or \\"the world\\"). Early 19th century graduates formed what one historian called a \\"network of messianic alumni.\\" These included Tao Zhu, who reformed the grain transportation system and salt monopoly; Wei Yuan, compiler of works on western geography, the exploits of the Qing expansionist campaigns, and the basic collection of statecraft essays; Bao Shichen; and most prominent, Zeng Guofan, architect of the Tongzhi Restoration.William T. Rowe. China's Last Empire: The Great Qing. (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, History of Imperial China, 2009; ), p. 162-163 Later 19th century alumni include Zuo Zongtang, a reformer official; Hu Linyi; Guo Songtao, China's first ambassador to a foreign country; Cai E, a major leader in defending the Republic of China.Daniel McMahon, \\"The Yuelu Academy and Hunan's Nineteenth-Century Turn toward Statecraft,\\" Late Imperial China 26.1 (2005): 72-109 Project MUSE. In 1903 the academy became a university, and in 1926 it was officially named Hunan University. The academy is the only one of the ancient Chinese academies of classical learning to have evolved into a modern institution of higher learning. The historical transformation from Yuelu Academy to Hunan University can be seen as emblematic of the development of China's higher education, a change which mirrors the vicissitudes of education system in mainland China. As a part of Hunan University, today the academy is a center of publication and research. In 1988, it was listed as a \\"Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Hunan\\" by the State Council of China.

Jubilees is considered one of the pseudepigrapha by Protestant, Roman Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox Churches.Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. It is also not considered canonical within Judaism outside of Beta Israel. It was well known to Early Christians, as evidenced by the writings of Epiphanius, Justin Martyr, Origen, Diodorus of Tarsus, Isidore of Alexandria, Isidore of Seville, Eutychius of Alexandria, John Malalas, George Syncellus, and George Kedrenos. The text was also utilized by the community that originally collected the Dead Sea Scrolls. No complete Greek or Latin version is known to have survived, but the Ge'ez version has been shown to be an accurate translation of the versions found in the Dead Sea Scrolls. The Book of Jubilees claims to present \\"the history of the division of the days of the Law, of the events of the years, the year-weeks, and the jubilees of the world\\" as revealed to Moses (in addition to the Torah or \\"Instruction\\") by angels while he was on Mount Sinai for forty days and forty nights.Book of Jubilees \\"Jublees 1:4\\" The chronology given in Jubilees is based on multiples of seven; the jubilees are periods of 49 years (seven \\"year-weeks\\"), into which all of time has been divided.  Manuscripts  Until the discovery of extensive fragments among the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS), the only surviving manuscripts of Jubilees were four complete Ge'ez texts dating to the 15th and 16th centuries, and several quotations by the Church fathers such as Epiphanius, Justin Martyr, Origen as well as Diodorus of Tarsus, Isidore of Alexandria, Isidore of Seville, Eutychius of Alexandria, John Malalas, George Syncellus, and George Kedrenos. There is also a preserved fragment of a Latin translation of the Greek that contains about a quarter of the whole work. The Ethiopic texts, now numbering twenty-seven, are the primary basis for translations into English. Passages in the texts of Jubilees that are directly parallel to verses in Genesis do not directly reproduce either of the two surviving manuscript traditions. Consequently, even before the Qumran discoveries, R.H. Charles had deduced that the Hebrew original had used an otherwise unrecorded text for Genesis and for the early chapters of Exodus, one independent either of the Masoretic text or of the Hebrew text that was the basis for the Septuagint. According to one historian, the variation among parallel manuscript traditions that are exhibited by the Septuagint compared with the Masoretic text, and which are embodied in the further variants among the Dead Sea Scrolls, demonstrates that even canonical Hebrew texts did not possess any single \\"authorized\\" manuscript tradition in the first centuries BC.Robin Lane Fox, a classicist and historian, discusses these multifarious sources of Old and New Testaments in layman's terms in Unauthorized Version (1992). Others write about the existence of three main textual manuscript traditions (namely the Babylonian, Samarian and Pre-Masoretic \\"proto\\" textual traditions). Although the Pre-Masoretic text may have indeed been authoritative back then, arguments can be made for and against this concept.Hershel Shanks, an historian and archaeological scholar, provides various articles that explore this issue in great depth, from various experts in the field of Dead Sea Scrolls research, in his book Understanding the Dead Sea Scrolls: A Reader from the Biblical Archaeology Review, June 29, 1993\\" Between 1947 and 1956, approximately 15 Jubilees scrolls were found in five caves at Qumran, all written in Hebrew. The large number of manuscripts (more than for any biblical books except for Psalms, Deuteronomy, Isaiah, Exodus, and Genesis, in descending order) indicates that Jubilees was widely used at Qumran. A comparison of the Qumran texts with the Ethiopic version, performed by James VanderKam, found that the Ethiopic was in most respects an accurate and literalistic translation.VanderKam, \\"The Book of Jubilees\\" in L. H. Schiffman and J. C. VanderKam (eds.), Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Oxford University Press (2000), Vol. I, p. 435.  Origins  Robert Henry Charles (1855‚Äì1931) became the first biblical scholar to propose an origin for Jubilees. Charles suggested that the author of Jubilees may have been a Pharisee and that Jubilees was the product of the midrash which had already been worked on in the Tanakh/Old Testament Books of Chronicles. With the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) at Qumran in 1947, Charles' Pharisaic hypothesis of the origin of Jubilees has been almost completely abandoned. The dating of Jubilees has been problematic for biblical scholars. While the oldest extant copies of Jubilees can be assigned on the basis of the handwriting to about 100 BC, there is much evidence to suggest Jubilees was written prior to this date.VanderKam (1989, 2001), p.18; , 86f. Jubilees could not have been written very long prior. Jubilees at 4:17-25 records that Enoch \\"saw in a vision what has happened and what will occur\\", and the book contains many points of information otherwise found earliest in the Enochian \\"Animal Apocalypse\\" (1 Enoch chapters 83-90), such as Enoch's wife being Edna., 156. The Animal Apocalypse claims to predict the Maccabean Revolt (which occurred 167-160 BC) and is commonly dated to that time.Boccaccini, 81f. . Independently of one another. The direction of dependence has been controversial,Kugel, 252, n.37; Hanneken, 143. but the consensus since 2008 has been that the Animal Apocalypse came first and Jubilees after. As a result, general reference works such as the Oxford Annotated Bible and the Mercer Bible Dictionary conclude the work can be dated to 160‚Äì150 BC.VanderKam (1989, 2001), pp. 17‚Äì21.  Subsequent use  The Hasmoneans adopted Jubilees immediately, and it became a source for the Aramaic Levi Document.Kugel, 167 Jubilees remained a point of reference for priestly circles (although they disputed its calendric proposal), and the Temple Scroll and \\"Epistle of Enoch\\" (1 Enoch 91:1‚Äì10, 92:3‚Äì93:10, 91:11‚Äì92:2, 93:11‚Äì105:3) are based on Jubilees.Boccacini 99‚Äì101, 104‚Äì113 respectively It is the source for certain of the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, for instance that of Reuben.Kugel, 110 There is no official record of it in Pharisaic or Rabbinic sources. It was among several books that the Sanhedrin left out when the Bible was canonized. Sub rosa, many of the traditions which Jubilees includes for the first time, are echoed in later Jewish sources, including some 12th-century midrashim which may have had access to a Hebrew copy. The sole exception within Judaism, the Beta Israel Jews formerly of Ethiopia, regard the Ge'ez text as canonical.Wolf Leslau, Falasha Anthology (Yale 1951), xxvii, xxxviii, xlii, 9 It appears that early Christian writers held the book of Jubilees in high regard, as many of them cited and alluded to Jubilees in their writing. Jan van Reeth argues that the Book of Jubilees had great influence on the formation of Islam. In the Book of Jubilees there is the very same concept of revelation as in Islam: God's words and commandments are eternally written on celestial tablets. An angel reveals their content to a prophet (2, 1; 32, 21 f.). Abraham's role in the Book of Jubilees corresponds to Abraham's role in the Quran in more than one way. The interpretation of biblical figures as prophets is also rooted in the Book of Jubilees. Also numerology, the emphasis on angels, and the symbolism of anniversaries found their way into Islam, such as the fact that many important events in the prophet's biography as presented by Ibn Ishaq happen on the same date. Etsuko Katsumata, comparing the Book of Jubilees and the Quran, notices significant differences, especially in Abraham's role in the quranic narrative, concluding that \\"the Book of Jubilees contains no passages in which Abraham disparages idols, as in the other texts, using tactics to make it look as if an idol has destroyed other idols (like in the Quran). The Book of Jubilees contains none of this kind of attitude; Abraham simply and directly destroys idols by setting fire to them.\\" The quranic Abraham-narrative, according to Katsumata, contains passages other than those in the Book of Jubilees in which Abraham is involved in disputes about idolatry. Abraham in the Quran acts as a perserverant prophet with an active and confronting missionary character, especially to his father, who is throughout the narrative hostile towards his son. Abraham tries to convince local people, leader and a king while not leaving his homeland. In the Book of Jubilees Abraham's role differs significantly; he has a favourable relationship to his father and leaves his home country after secretly burning down a temple.  Content  Jubilees covers much of the same ground as Genesis, but often with additional detail, and addressing Moses in the second person as the entire history of creation, and of Israel up to that point, is recounted in divisions of 49 years each, or \\"Jubilees\\". The elapsed time from the creation, up to Moses receiving the scriptures upon Sinai during the Exodus, is calculated as fifty Jubilees, less the 40 years still to be spent wandering in the desert before entering Canaan ‚Äì or 2,410 years. Four classes of angels are mentioned: angels of the presence, angels of sanctifications, guardian angels over individuals, and angels presiding over the phenomena of nature. Enoch was the first man initiated by the angels in the art of writing, and wrote down, accordingly, all the secrets of astronomy, of chronology, and of the world's epochs. As regards demonology, the writer's position is largely that of the deuterocanonical writings from both New and Old Testament times. The Book of Jubilees narrates the genesis of angels on the first day of Creation and the story of how a group of fallen angels mated with mortal females, giving rise to a race of giants known as the Nephilim, and then to their descendants, the Elioud. The Ethiopian version states that the \\"angels\\" were in fact the disobedient offspring of Seth (Deqiqa Set), while the \\"mortal females\\" were daughters of Cain.Ethiopian Orthodox Church's canonical Amharic version of Jubilees, 5:21 ‚Äì readable on p. 14 of this file. This is also the view held by Clementine literature, Sextus Julius Africanus, Ephrem the Syrian, Augustine of Hippo, and John Chrysostom among many early Christian authorities. Their hybrid children, the Nephilim in existence during the time of Noah, were wiped out by the great flood. Jubilees also states that God granted ten percent of the disembodied spirits of the Nephilim to try to lead mankind astray after the flood. Jubilees makes an incestuous reference regarding the son of Adam and Eve, Cain, and his wife. In chapter iv (1‚Äì12) (Cain and Abel), it mentions that Cain took his sister Awan to be his wife and Enoch was their child. It also mentions that Seth (the third son of Adam and Eve) married his sister Azura. According to this book, Hebrew is the language of Heaven, and was originally spoken by all creatures in the Garden, animals and man; however, the animals lost their power of speech when Adam and Eve were expelled. Following the Deluge, the earth was apportioned into three divisions for the three sons of Noah, and his sixteen grandsons. After the destruction of the Tower of Babel, their families were scattered to their respective allotments, and Hebrew was forgotten, until Abraham was taught it by the angels. Jubilees also contains a few scattered allusions to the Messianic kingdom. Robert Henry Charles wrote in 1913: Jubilees insists (in Chapter 6) on a 364 day yearly calendar, made up of four quarters of 13 weeks each, rather than a year of 12 lunar months, which it says is off by 10 days per year (the actual number being about 11¬º days). It also insists on a \\"Double Sabbath\\" each year being counted as only one day to arrive at this computation. Jubilees 7:20‚Äì29 is possibly an early reference to the Noahide laws.  Sources  Jubilees bases its take on Enoch on the \\"Book of Watchers\\", 1 Enoch 1‚Äì36.Gabriele Boccacini, Beyond the Essene Hypothesis (Eerdmans: 1998) Its sequence of events leading to the Flood match those of the \\"Dream Visions\\", 1 Enoch 83‚Äì90.

Definition  =Canada= Environment and Climate Change Canada defines brownfields as \\"abandoned, idle or underutilized commercial or industrial properties [typically located in urban areas] where past actions have caused environmental contamination, but which still have potential for redevelopment or other economic opportunities.\\" = United States = The US EPA has defined brownfield not simply as a potential improvement site which has been previously improved, but also one that has potential impediments to improvement, such as \\"the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant\\". This comports well with an available general definition of the term, which scopes to \\"industrial or commercial property\\". The term brownfields first came into use on June 28, 1992, at a U.S. congressional field hearing hosted by the Northeast Midwest Congressional Coalition. Also in 1992, the first detailed policy analysis of the issue was convened by the Cuyahoga County Planning Commission. The United States Environmental Protection Agency selected Cuyahoga County as its first brownfield pilot project in September 1993. The term applies more generally to previously used land or to sections of industrial or commercial facilities that are to be upgraded. In 2002, President George W. Bush signed the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act (the ‚ÄúBrownfields Law‚Äù) which provides grants and tools to local governments for the assessment, cleanup, and revitalization of brownfields. The motivation for this act was the success of the EPA‚Äôs brownfields program, which it started in the 1990s in response to several court cases that caused lenders to redline contaminated property for fear of liability under the Superfund. As of September 2015, the EPA estimates that the Brownfields program has resulted in 56,442 acres of land readied for reuse.Thomas Voltaggio and John Adams. ‚ÄúSuperfund: A Half Century of Progress.‚Äù EPA Alumni Association. March 2016. Mothballed brownfields are properties that the owners are not willing to transfer or put to productive reuse. Brownfield status is a legal designation which places restrictions, conditions or incentives on redevelopment and use on the site. = United Kingdom = In the United Kingdom, the term 'brownfield' has a colloquial meaning roughly equivalent to the American usage described above, i.e. vacant or derelict land or property, usually industrial in nature. In terms of British Town and Country Planning, however, the meaning of 'brownfield' is more complex, and is often conflated with the technical term 'previously developed land' (PDL). PDL was originally defined in planning policy for housing development in England and Wales, and was carefully distinguished in such policy from 'brownfield', which was undefined but considered to be different.Planning Policy Statement 3: Housing June 2000. 29pp, Department for Communities and Local Government, Crown Copyright . The definition from the 2012 National Planning Policy Guidance, which only applies to England, uses the terms 'brownfield' and 'previously developed land' interchangeably:National Planning Policy Framework 2012, 65 pp, Department for Communities and Local Government, , \\"Land which is or was occupied by a permanent structure, including the curtilage of the developed land (although it should not be assumed that the whole of the curtilage should be developed) and any associated fixed surface infrastructure. This excludes: * land that is or has been occupied by agricultural or forestry buildings; * land that has been developed for minerals extraction (mining) or waste disposal by landfill purposes where provision for restoration has been made through development control procedures; * land in built-up areas such as private residential gardens, parks, recreation grounds and allotments; and * land that was previously- developed but where the remains of the permanent structure or fixed surface structure have blended into the landscape in the process of time.\\" Locations and contaminants Generally, brownfield sites exist in a city's or town's industrial section, on locations with abandoned factories or commercial buildings, or other previously polluting operations like steel mills, refineries or landfills. Small brownfields also may be found in older residential neighborhoods, as for example dry cleaning establishments or gas stations produced high levels of subsurface contaminants. Typical contaminants found on contaminated brownfield land include hydrocarbon spillages, solvents, pesticides, heavy metals such as lead (e.g., paints), tributyl tins, and asbestos. Old maps may assist in identifying areas to be tested. Brownfield status by country The primary issue facing all nations involved in attracting and sustaining new uses to brownfield sites is globalization of industry. This directly affects brownfield reuse, such as limiting the effective economic life of the use on the revitalized sites. =Canada= Canada has an estimated 200,000 \\"contaminated sites\\" across the nation. Canada had about 23,078 federally contaminated sites, from abandoned mines, to airports, lighthouse stations, and military bases, which are classified into N 1,2,or 3, depending on a score of contamination, with 5,300 active contaminated sites, 2,300 suspected sites and 15,000 listed as closed because remediated or no action was necessary. The provincial governments have primary responsibility for brownfields. The provinces¬¥ legal mechanisms for managing risk are limited, as there are no tools such as \\"No Further Action\\" letters to give property owners finality and certainty in the cleanup and reuse process. Yet, Canada has cleaned up sites and attracted investment to contaminated lands such as the Moncton rail yards. A strip of the Texaco lands in Mississauga is slated to be part of the Waterfront Trail. However, Imperial Oil has no plans to sell the property which has been vacant since the 1980s. According to their 2014 report on federally contaminated sites, the Parliamentary Budget Officer estimated that the \\"total liability for remediating Canada‚Äôs contaminated sites reported in the public accounts [was] $4.9 billion.\\" The report listed significant sites called the Big Five with a liability of $1.8 billion: Faro mine, Colomac Mine, Giant Mine, Cape Dyer-DEW line and Goose Bay Air Base. The Port Hope, Ontario site has a liability of $1 billion. Port Hope has the largest volume of historic low-level radioactive wastes in Canada, resulting from \\"radium and uranium processing in Port Hope between 1933 and 1988 by the former Crown corporation Eldorado Nuclear Limited and its private sector predecessors. By 2010 it was projected that it would cost well over a billion dollars for the soil remediation project, it was the largest such cleanup in Canadian history. The effort is projected to be complete in 2022. In July 2015 the $86,847,474 contract \\"to relocate the historic low-level radioactive waste and marginally contaminated soils from an existing waste management facility on the shoreline of Lake Ontario to the new, state-of-the-art facility about a kilometre north of the current site.\\" was undertaken. There is also \\"$1.8 billion for general inventory sites\\" and \\"$200 million for other sites.\\" The same report claimed the inventory currently lists 24,990 contaminated sites.\\" The federal government exercises some control over environmental protection, the \\"provincial and territorial governments issue the bulk of legislation regarding contaminated sites.\\" Under the Shared-Responsibility Contaminated Sites Policy Framework (2005), the government may provide funding for the remediation of nonfederal sites, if the contamination is related to federal government activities or national security. See Natural Resources Canada (2012) =Denmark= While Denmark lacks the large land base which creates the magnitude of brownfield issues facing countries such as Germany and the U.S., brownfield sites in areas critical to the local economies of Denmark‚Äôs cities require sophisticated solutions and careful interaction with affected communities. Examples include the cleanup and redevelopment of former and current ship building facilities along Copenhagen‚Äôs historic waterfront. Laws in Denmark require a higher degree of coordination of planning and reuse than is found in many other countries. =France= In France, brownfields are called \\"friches industrielles\\" and the Minist√®re de l'√âcologie, du D√©veloppement Durable et de l'√ânergie (MEDDE) maintains a database of polluted sites named BASOL, with \\"more than 4000 sites\\". of about 300 000 to 400 000 potentially polluted sites total (around 100 000 ha), in a historical inventory named BASIAS, maintained by the Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie (ADEME). =Germany= Germany loses greenfields at a rate of about 1.2 square kilometres per day for settlement and transportation infrastructure. Each of the approximately 14,700 local municipalities is empowered to allocate lands for industrial and commercial use. Local control over reuse decisions of German brownfield sites (\\"Industriebrache\\") is a critical factor. Industrial sites tend to be remote due to zoning laws, and incur costly overhead for providing infrastructure such as utilities, disposal services and transportation. In 1989, a brownfield of the Ruhrgebiet became Emscher Park. =United Kingdom= In the UK centuries of industrial use of lands which once formed the birthplace of the industrial revolution have left entire regions in a brownfield status. New legislation in the UK may provide a needed incentive for brownfield cleanup and redevelopment. Cleanup laws are centered on the premise that the remediation should be \\"fit for the purpose\\". In 2018, the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) reported that the 17,656 sites (covering over 28,000 hectares of land) identified by local planning authorities at Brownfield Land Registers would provide enough land for a minimum of 1 million homes, which could rise to over 1.1 million once all registers are published. There is also brownfield capacity in areas in which the green belt is in danger, particularly in the Northwest, where local authorities have identified enough brownfield land to provide for 12 years of housing demand. =United States= United States estimates suggest there are over 500,000 brownfield sites contaminated at levels below the Superfund caliber (the most contaminated) in the country. While historic land use patterns created contaminated sites, the Superfund law has been criticized as creating the brownfield phenomenon where investment moves to greenfields for new development due to severe, no-fault liability schemes and other disincentives. The Clinton-Gore administration and US EPA launched a series of brownfield policies and programs in 1993 to tackle this problem.  Redevelopment  =Valuation and financing= Acquisition, adaptive re-use, and disposal of a brownfield site requires advanced and specialized appraisal analysis techniques. For example, the highest and best use of the brownfield site may be affected by the contamination, both before and after remediation. Additionally, the value should take into account residual stigma and potential for third-party liability. Normal appraisal techniques frequently fail, and appraisers must rely on more advanced techniques, such as contingent valuation, case studies, or statistical analyses. Article Author of \\"Valuation of Brownfields\\", Chapter 29 in Lexis-Nexis Matthew Bender's Brownfield Law and Practice, 2007. A 2011 University of Delaware study has suggested a 17.5:1 return on dollars invested on brownfield redevelopment. The first online page is archived; the page containing information related here is not in the archived version. A 2014 study of EPA brownfield cleanup grants from 2002 through 2008 found an average benefit value of almost $4 million per brownfield site (with a median of $2,117,982). To expedite the cleanup of brownfield sites in the US, some environmental firms have teamed up with insurance companies to underwrite the cleanup and provide a guaranteed cleanup cost to limit land developers' exposure to environmental remediation costs and pollution lawsuits. The environmental firm first performs an extensive investigation generally in the form of desk studies and potentially further intrusive investigation. = Remediation strategies = Innovative remediation techniques used at distressed brownfields in recent years include in situ thermal remediation, bioremediation and in situ oxidation. Often, these strategies are used in conjunction with each other or with other remedial strategies such as soil vapor extraction. In this process, vapor from the soil phase is extracted from soils and treated, which has the effect of removing contaminants from the soils and groundwater beneath a site. Binders can be added to contaminated soil to prevent chemical leaching. Some brownfields with heavy metal contamination have even been cleaned up through an innovative approach called phytoremediation, which uses deep-rooted plants to soak up metals in soils into the plant structure as the plant grows. After they reach maturity, the plants - which now contain the heavy metal contaminants in their tissues - are removed and disposed of as hazardous waste. Research is under way to see if some brownfields can be used to grow crops, specifically for the production of biofuels. Michigan State University, in collaboration with DaimlerChrysler and NextEnergy, has small plots of soybean, corn, canola, and switchgrass growing in a former industrial dump site in Oakland County, Michigan. The intent is to see if the plants can serve two purposes simultaneously: assist with phytoremediation, and contribute to the economical production of biodiesel and/or ethanol fuel. The regeneration of brownfields in the United Kingdom and in other European countries has gained prominence due to greenfield land restrictions as well as their potential to promote the urban renaissance. Development of brownfield sites also presents an opportunity to reduce the environmental impact on communities, and considerable assessments need to take place in order to evaluate the size of this opportunity. =Barriers= Examples of brownfields that were redeveloped into productive properties Many contaminated brownfield sites sit unused for decades because the cost of cleaning them to safe standards is more than the land would be worth after redevelopment, in the process becoming involuntary parks as they grow over. However, redevelopment has become more common in the first decade of the 21st century, as developable land has become less available in highly populated areas, and brownfields contribute to environmental stigma which can delay redevelopment.Coming Back from Economic Despair. Henry Mayer and Micheal Greenburg. Economic Development Quarterly, August 2001 Also, the methods of studying contaminated land have become more sophisticated and costly. Some states and localities have spent considerable money assessing the contamination on local brownfield sites, to quantify the cleanup costs in an effort to move the redevelopment process forward. Therefore, federal and state programs have been developed to help developers interested in cleaning up brownfield sites and restoring them to practical uses. In the process of cleaning contaminated brownfield sites, previously unknown underground storage tanks, buried drums or buried railroad tank cars containing wastes are sometimes encountered. Unexpected circumstances increase the cost for study and clean-up. As a result, the cleanup work may be delayed or stopped entirely. To avoid unexpected contamination and increased costs, many developers insist that a site be thoroughly investigated (via a Phase II Site Investigation or Remedial Investigation) prior to commencing remedial cleanup activities.  Post-redevelopment uses  Brownfield relic serves as monument in a new park in Atlantic Station area of Atlanta, Georgia, USA. Brownfield residential development in New Jersey Pedestrians walking along hillside path in Seonyudo Park = Commercial and residential = the Atlantic Station project in Atlanta, was the largest brownfield redevelopment in the United States. Dayton, like many other cities in the region, is developing Tech Town in order to attract technology-based firms to Dayton and revitalize the downtown area. In Homestead, Pennsylvania, the site once occupied by Carnegie Steel has been converted into a successful commercial center, The Waterfront. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has successfully converted numerous former steel mill sites into high-end residential, shopping, and offices. Examples of brownfield redevelopment in Pittsburgh include: * In Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood, a former slag dump for steel mills was turned into a $243 million residential development called Summerset at Frick Park. * In Pittsburgh's South Side neighborhood, a former LTV Steel mill site was transformed into Southside Works, a mixed-use development that includes high- end entertainment, retail, offices, and housing. * In the Hazelwood (Pittsburgh) neighborhood, a former Jones and Laughlin steel mill site was transformed into a $104 million office park called Pittsburgh Technology Center. * In Herr's Island, a island on the western bank of the Allegheny River, a former rail stop for livestock and meatpacking was transformed into Washington's Landing, a waterfront center for commerce, manufacturing, recreation and upscale housing  Regulation  =United States= In the United States, Brownfield regulation and development is largely governed by state environmental agencies in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In 1995, the EPA launched the Brownfields Program, which was expanded in 2002 with the Brownfields Law. The EPA, together with local and national government, can provide technical help and some funding for assessment and cleanup. From 2002 through 2013, the EPA awarded nearly 1,000 grants for clean up, for a total of almost $190 million. It can also provide tax incentives for cleanup that is not paid for outright; specifically, cleanup costs are fully tax-deductible in the year they are incurred. Many of the most important provisions on liability relief are contained in state codes that can differ significantly from state to state. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, regulation of contaminated land comes from Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990; responsibility falls on local authorities to create a \\"contaminated land register\\". For sites with dubious past and present uses the Local Planning Authority may ask for a desktop study, which is sometimes implemented as a condition in planning applications.

From . Shiga toxins are a family of related toxins with two major groups, Stx1 and Stx2, expressed by genes considered to be part of the genome of lambdoid prophages. The toxins are named after Kiyoshi Shiga, who first described the bacterial origin of dysentery caused by Shigella dysenteriae. Shiga-like toxin (SLT) is a historical term for similar or identical toxins produced by Escherichia coli. The most common sources for Shiga toxin are the bacteria S. dysenteriae and some serotypes of Escherichia coli (STEC), which includes serotypes O157:H7, and O104:H4.  Nomenclature  Microbiologists use many terms to describe Shiga toxin and differentiate more than one unique form. Many of these terms are used interchangeably. # Shiga toxin type 1 and type 2 (Stx-1 and 2) are the Shiga toxins produced by some E. coli strains. Stx-1 is identical to Stx of Shigella spp. or differs by only one amino acid. Stx-2 shares 56% sequence identity with Stx-1. # Cytotoxins ‚Äì an archaic denotation for Stx ‚Äì is used in a broad sense. # Verocytotoxins/verotoxins ‚Äì a seldom-used term for Stx ‚Äì is from the hypersensitivity of Vero cells to Stx. # The term Shiga-like toxins is another antiquated term which arose prior to the understanding that Shiga and Shiga-like toxins were identical. History The toxin is named after Kiyoshi Shiga, who discovered S. dysenteriae in 1897. In 1977, researchers in Ottawa, Ontario discovered the Shiga toxin normally produced by Shigella dysenteriae in a line of E. coli. The E. coli version of the toxin was named \\"verotoxin\\" because of its ability to kill Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cells) in culture. Shortly after, the verotoxin was referred to as Shiga-like toxin because of its similarities to Shiga toxin. It has been suggested by some researchers that the gene coding for Shiga-like toxin comes from a toxin-converting lambdoid bacteriophage, such as H-19B or 933W, inserted into the bacteria's chromosome via transduction. Phylogenetic studies of the diversity of E. coli suggest that it may have been relatively easy for Shiga toxin to transduce into certain strains of E. coli, because Shigella is itself a subgenus of Escherichia; in fact, some strains traditionally considered E. coli (including those that produce this toxin) in fact belong to this lineage. Being closer relatives of Shigella dysenteriae than of the typical E. coli, it is not at all unusual that toxins similar to that of S. dysenteriae are produced by these strains. As microbiology advances, the historical variation in nomenclature (which arose because of gradually advancing science in multiple places) is increasingly giving way to recognizing all of these molecules as \\"versions of the same toxin\\" rather than \\"different toxins\\". Transmission The toxin requires highly specific receptors on the cells' surface in order to attach and enter the cell; species such as cattle, swine, and deer which do not carry these receptors may harbor toxigenic bacteria without any ill effect, shedding them in their feces, from where they may be spread to humans. Clinical significance Symptoms of Shiga toxin ingestion include abdominal pain as well as watery diarrhea. Severe life-threatening cases are characterized by hemorrhagic colitis (HC). The toxin is associated with hemolytic-uremic syndrome. In contrast, Shigella species may also produce shigella enterotoxins, which are the cause of dysentery. The toxin is effective against small blood vessels, such as found in the digestive tract, the kidney, and lungs, but not against large vessels such as the arteries or major veins. A specific target for the toxin appears to be the vascular endothelium of the glomerulus. This is the filtering structure that is a key to the function of the kidney. Destroying these structures leads to kidney failure and the development of the often deadly and frequently debilitating hemolytic uremic syndrome. Food poisoning with Shiga toxin often also has effects on the lungs and the nervous system. Structure and mechanism Escherichia coli O157:H7. The A subunit is shown in red (top), and the B subunits, forming a pentamer, in different shades of blue (bottom). From . = Mechanism = The B subunits of the toxin bind to a component of the cell membrane known as glycolipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). Binding of the subunit B to Gb3 causes induction of narrow tubular membrane invaginations, which drives formation of inward membrane tubules for the bacterial uptake into the cell. These tubules are essential for uptake into the host cell. The Shiga toxin (a non-pore forming toxin) is transferred to the cytosol via Golgi network and ER. From the Golgi toxin is trafficked to the ER. Shiga toxins act to inhibit protein synthesis within target cells by a mechanism similar to that of ribosome-inactivating proteins from plants like ricin or stenodactylin. After entering a cell via a macropinosome, the protein (A subunit) cleaves a specific adenine nucleobase from the 28S RNA of the 60S subunit of the ribosome, thereby halting protein synthesis. As they mainly act on the lining of the blood vessels, the vascular endothelium, a breakdown of the lining and hemorrhage eventually occurs. The first response is commonly a bloody diarrhea. This is because Shiga toxin is usually taken in with contaminated food or water. The bacterial Shiga toxin can be used for targeted therapy of gastric cancer, because this tumor entity expresses the receptor of the Shiga toxin. For this purpose an unspecific chemotherapeutical is conjugated to the B-subunit to make it specific. In this way only the tumor cells, but not healthy cells, are destroyed during therapy.Gastric adenocarcinomas express the glycosphingolipid Gb3/CD77: Targeting of gastric cancer cells with Shiga toxin B-subunit = Structure = The toxin has two subunits‚Äîdesignated A (mol. wt. 32000 D) and B (mol. wt. 7700 D)‚Äîand is one of the AB5 toxins. The B subunit is a pentamer that binds to specific glycolipids on the host cell, specifically globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). Following this, the A subunit is internalised and cleaved into two parts. The A1 component then binds to the ribosome, disrupting protein synthesis. Stx-2 has been found to be about 400 times more toxic (as quantified by LD50 in mice) than Stx-1. Gb3 is, for unknown reasons, present in greater amounts in renal epithelial tissues, to which the renal toxicity of Shiga toxin may be attributed. Gb3 is also found in central nervous system neurons and endothelium, which may lead to neurotoxicity. Stx-2 is also known to increase the expression of its receptor GB3 and cause neuronal dysfunctions.

He represented Ohio in both houses of Congress and served as the Democratic nominee for Vice President of the United States in 1864. After studying at the University of Cincinnati and Heidelberg University, Pendleton practiced law in his home town of Cincinnati, Ohio. He was the son of Congressman Nathanael G. Pendleton and the son-in-law of poet Francis Scott Key. After serving in the Ohio Senate, Pendleton won election to the United States House of Representatives. During the Civil War, he emerged as a leader of the Copperheads, a group of Democrats who favored peace with the Confederacy. After the war, he opposed the Thirteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The 1864 Democratic National Convention nominated a ticket of George B. McClellan, who favored continuing the war, and Pendleton, who opposed it. The ticket was defeated by the Republican ticket of Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson, and Pendleton lost his Congressional re-election race that same year. Pendleton was a strong contender for the presidential nomination at the 1868 Democratic National Convention, but was defeated by Horatio Seymour. After Pendleton lost the 1869 Ohio gubernatorial election, he temporarily left politics. He served as the president of the Kentucky Central Railroad before returning to Congress. Pendleton won election to the U.S. Senate in 1879 and served a single term, becoming Chairman of the Senate Democratic Conference. After the assassination of President James A. Garfield, he wrote and helped pass the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883. The act required many civil service hires to be based on merit rather than political connections. Passage of the act lost him support in Ohio and he was not nominated for a second term in the Senate. President Grover Cleveland appointed him as the ambassador to the German Empire. He served in that position until 1889, dying later that same year. Early life Pendleton was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on July 19, 1825. He was the son of Jane Frances (n√©e Hunt) Pendleton (1802‚Äì1839) and U.S. Representative and Nathanael Greene Pendleton (1793‚Äì1861). He attended the local schools and Cincinnati College and the University of Heidelberg in Germany. Pendleton studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1847 and commenced practice in Cincinnati. Career Currier and Ives print of the Democratic presidential party ticket, 1864. Lithograph with watercolor. Pendleton was elected as a member of the Ohio Senate, serving from 1854 to 1856. His father had been a member of the Ohio Senate from 1825 until 1827. In 1854, he ran unsuccessfully for the Thirty- fourth United States Congress. Three years later, he was elected as a Democrat to the Thirty-fifth Congress and would be re-elected to the three following Congresses (March 4, 1857 ‚Äì March 3, 1865). During his time in the House of Representatives, he was one of the managers appointed by the House of Representatives in 1862 to conduct the impeachment proceedings against West H. Humphreys, a US judge for several districts of Tennessee. He was a leader of the peace faction of his party, with close ties to the Copperheads. He voted against the Thirteenth Amendment, which outlawed slavery and involuntary servitude. =National politics= Pendleton ran as an antiwar Democrat in the 1864 presidential elections for Vice President, together with George McClellan. Their opponents were Lincoln (President) and Andrew Johnson (nominee for Vice President). At 39, Pendleton was one of the youngest candidates for national office in US history. McClellan and Pendleton lost, receiving about 45% of the vote. In the same election, Pendleton also lost re- election to the Thirty-ninth Congress. =Out of office= Out of office for the first time in a decade, Pendleton ran for his old House seat in 1866 but lost. In 1868, he sought the Democratic Party's presidential nomination. He led for the first 15 ballots and was nearly the nominee, but his support disappeared and he lost to Horatio Seymour, primarily for his support of the \\"Ohio idea.\\" The following year, he was the Democratic nominee for Governor of Ohio and again lost, this time to Rutherford B. Hayes. Pendleton stepped away from politics, and in 1869, he became president of the Kentucky Central Railroad. =Political comeback= In 1879, he made his comeback when he was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate. During his only term, from 1881 to 1885, he served concurrently as the Chairman of the Democratic Conference. Following the 1881 assassination of James A. Garfield, he passed his most notable legislation, known as the Pendleton Act of 1883, requiring civil service exams for government positions. The Act helped put an end to the system of patronage in widespread use at the time, but it cost Pendleton politically, as many members of his own party preferred the spoils system. He was thus not renominated to the Senate. =Later life= Pendleton in his later years. Instead, President Grover Cleveland appointed him Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Germany the year that he left office, which he served until April 1889. Five months later, during his return trip to the United States, he died in Brussels, Belgium. =Beliefs= Pendleton had a very Jacksonian commitment to the Democratic Party as the best, perhaps the only, mechanism through which ordinary Americans could shape government policies. Mach (2007) argues that Pendleton's chief contribution was to demonstrate the Whig Party's willingness to use its power in government to achieve Jacksonian ideals. While his Jacksonian commitment to states' rights and limited government made him a dissenter during the Civil War, what Mach calls Pendleton's Jacksonian \\"ardor to expand opportunities for ordinary Americans\\" was the basis for his leadership in civil service reform and his controversial plan to use greenbacks to repay the federal debt. What appeared to be a substantive ideological shift, Mach argues, represented Pendleton's pragmatic willingness to use new means to achieve old ends. Personal life In 1846, Pendleton was married to Mary Alicia Key (1824‚Äì1886), the daughter of Francis Scott Key, the lawyer, author, and amateur poet who is best known today for writing a poem which later became the lyrics for the United States' national anthem, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner.\\" Together, George and Alicia were the parents of: * Sarah Pendleton (born in Ireland, about 1846) * Francis Key Pendleton (1850‚Äì1930), who was born in Cincinnati and became prominent in New York society during the Gilded Age. * Mary Lloyd Pendleton (1852‚Äì1929), who was born in Cincinnati. * Jane Francis Pendleton (1860‚Äì1950), who was born in the District of Columbia, April 22, 1860. * George Hunt Pendleton (1863‚Äì1868), who died young. At the end of his life, Pendleton suffered a stroke. Pendleton died in Brussels, Belgium on November 24, 1889. He is interred in Spring Grove Cemetery, Cincinnati, Ohio. =Memorials= The city of Pendleton, Oregon, is named after him. The George H. Pendleton House in Cincinnati is a National Historical Landmark and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. In popular culture In Steven Spielberg's 2012 film, Lincoln, Pendleton is played by Peter McRobbie and portrayed as one of the most notable opponents of the Thirteenth Amendment and of the Civil Rights Act of 1866.

These trilobites (Lloydolithus) were replaced by pyrite during a specific type of permineralization called pyritization. Diagenesis () is the process that describes physical and chemical changes in sediments caused by increasing temperature and pressure as they get buried in the Earth's crust.Marshak, Stephen, 2009, Essentials of Geology, W. W. Norton & Company, 3rd ed. In the early stages, this transformation of sediment into sedimentary rock (lithification) is accompanied simply by a reduction in porosity, while its component mineralogy remains unaltered. As the rock is carried deeper by further deposition above, its organic content is transformed into kerogens and bitumens. The process of diagenesis excludes surface alteration (weathering) and metamorphism. There is no sharp boundary between diagenesis and metamorphism, but the latter occurs at higher temperatures and pressures. Hydrothermal solutions, meteoric groundwater, porosity, permeability, solubility, and time are all influential factors. After deposition, sediments are compacted as they are buried beneath successive layers of sediment and cemented by minerals that precipitate from solution. Grains of sediment, rock fragments and fossils can be replaced by other minerals during diagenesis. Porosity usually decreases during diagenesis, except in rare cases such as dissolution of minerals and dolomitization. The study of diagenesis in rocks is used to understand the geologic history they have undergone and the nature and type of fluids that have circulated through them. From a commercial standpoint, such studies aid in assessing the likelihood of finding various economically viable mineral and hydrocarbon deposits. The process of diagenesis is also important in the decomposition of bone tissue.  Role in anthropology and paleontology  calcitic crinoid stem (in cross-section) diagenetically replaced by marcasite in a siderite concretion; Lower Carboniferous. The term diagenesis, literally meaning \\"across generation\\",Oxford English Dictionary. is extensively used in geology. However, this term has filtered into the field of anthropology, archaeology and paleontology to describe the changes and alterations that take place on skeletal (biological) material. Specifically, diagenesis \\"is the cumulative physical, chemical and biological environment; these processes will modify an organic object's original chemical and/or structural properties and will govern its ultimate fate, in terms of preservation or destruction\\".Wilson, L. and M. Pollard, \\"Here today, gone tomorrow? Integrated experimentation and geochemical modeling in studies of archaeological diagenetic change\\". Accounts of Chemical Research, 2002. 35(8): p. 644‚Äì651. In order to assess the potential impact of diagenesis on archaeological or fossil bones, many factors need to be assessed, beginning with elemental and mineralogical composition of bone and enveloping soil, as well as the local burial environment (geology, climatology, groundwater). The composite nature of bone, comprising one-third organic (mainly protein collagen) and two thirds mineral (calcium phosphate mostly in the form of hydroxyapatite) renders its diagenesis more complex. Alteration occurs at all scales from molecular loss and substitution, through crystallite reorganization, porosity and microstructural changes, and in many cases, to disintegration of the complete unit. Three general pathways of the diagenesis of bone have been identified: # Chemical deterioration of the organic phase. # Chemical deterioration of the mineral phase. # (Micro) biological attack of the composite. They are as follows: # The dissolution of collagen depends on time, temperature and environmental pH. At high temperatures, the rate of collagen loss will be accelerated and extreme pH can cause collagen swelling and accelerated hydrolysis. Due to the increase in porosity of bones through collagen loss, the bone becomes susceptible to hydrolytic infiltration where the hydroxyapatite, with its affinity for amino acids, permits charged species of endogenous and exogenous origin to take up residence. # The hydrolytic activity plays a key role in the mineral phase transformations that exposes the collagen to accelerated chemical- and bio- degradation. Chemical changes affect crystallinity. Mechanisms of chemical change, such as the uptake of F‚àí or CO3‚àí may cause recrystallization where hydroxyapatite is dissolved and re-precipitated allowing for the incorporation or substitution of exogenous material. # Once an individual has been interred, microbial attack, the most common mechanism of bone deterioration, occurs rapidly. During this phase, most bone collagen is lost and porosity is increased. The dissolution of the mineral phase caused by low pH permits access to the collagen by extracellular microbial enzymes thus microbial attack.  Role in hydrocarbon generation  When animal or plant matter is buried during sedimentation, the constituent organic molecules (lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and lignin-humic compounds) break down due to the increase in temperature and pressure. This transformation occurs in the first few hundred meters of burial and results in the creation of two primary products: kerogens and bitumens. It is generally accepted that hydrocarbons are formed by the thermal alteration of these kerogens (the biogenic theory). In this way, given certain conditions (which are largely temperature- dependent) kerogens will break down to form hydrocarbons through a chemical process known as cracking, or catagenesis. A kinetic model based on experimental data can capture most of the essential transformation in diagenesis, and a mathematical model in a compacting porous medium to model the dissolution-precipitation mechanism. These models have been intensively studied and applied in real geological applications. Diagenesis has been divided, based on hydrocarbon and coal genesis into: eodiagenesis (early), mesodiagenesis (middle) and telodiagenesis (late). During the early or eodiagenesis stage shales lose pore water, little to no hydrocarbons are formed and coal varies between lignite and sub-bituminous. During mesodiagenesis, dehydration of clay minerals occurs, the main development of oil genesis occurs and high to low volatile bituminous coals are formed. During telodiagenesis, organic matter undergoes cracking and dry gas is produced; semi-anthracite coals develop. Early diagenesis in newly formed aquatic sediments is mediated by microorganisms using different electron acceptors as part of their metabolism. Organic matter is mineralized, liberating gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) in the porewater, which, depending on the conditions, can diffuse into the water column. The various processes of mineralization in this phase are nitrification and denitrification, manganese oxide reduction, iron hydroxide reduction, sulfate reduction, and fermentation.  Role in bone decomposition  Diagenesis alters the proportions of organic collagen and inorganic components (hydroxyapatite, calcium, magnesium) of bone exposed to environmental conditions, especially moisture. This is accomplished by the exchange of natural bone constituents, deposition in voids or defects, adsorption onto the bone surface and leaching from the bone.\\"Beyond the grave: understanding human decomposition\\" A.

Retrieved 01 June 2014 and Herbert himself stated to Tim O'Reilly that The Santaroga Barrier was intended to describe a society that \\"half my readers would think was utopia, the other half would think was dystopia.\\" Plot summary A psychologist, Gilbert Dasein, is hired by corporate interests to investigate Santaroga, a southern California town in a valley where marketing seems totally ineffective: outside businesses are allowed in, but wither quickly for lack of business. Santarogans aren't hostile toward the enterprises, they just won't shop there. Nor are they xenophobic; they instead appear maddeningly self-satisfied with their quaint, local lifestyle. Adding an element of danger, the last few psychologists sent in have all died in accidents that are (seemingly) perfectly plausible. Complicating matters further still, the psychologist's college girlfriend, Jenny, has returned to Santaroga, her hometown. With this in mind, Dasein cautiously enters the town and quickly learns of 'Jaspers', an additive in the food and drink commonly ingested in Santaroga that seems to imbue the consumer with greater health and an expanded mind. Within the Santarogan community, Jaspers was described as \\"Consciousness Fuel\\" which opened a person's eyes and ears, and turned on their minds. Those who consume it don't become psychic; instead, they're simply far more lucid than the average citizen of the U.S, although there are numerous hints at a group mind operating at a subconscious level. Their newspapers are vaguely subversive with their folksy, enlightened commentary on world affairs; their dinner conversations knowledgeably reference great theories of psychology, politics, and cognitive science.

Knowing that Jaspers creates exceptionally perceptive, penetrating individual minds, Dasein realizes that he has offended a communal id that feels threatened by him. As Jenny tries to convince him to settle down with her there, he wonders whether he'll live long enough to decide. Allusions and references The novel was loosely based on the ideas of the philosopher Martin Heidegger, noticeably on his book Being and Time (1927). The main character's name is Gilbert Dasein. Dasein is one of Heidegger's terms which roughly translates to 'being'. It has also been suggested that the name may be a twist on 'Gilbert Gosseyn', a character in The World of Null-A (1948) by A. E. van Vogt. Jenny Sorge's surname refers to Heidegger's term Sorge, Heidegger's term for \\"caring\\", which Heidegger regarded as the fundamental concept of Intentionality. The character Dr. Piaget was named for the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Jaspers, the psychoactive substance in the book, is named for Karl Jaspers, a German psychiatrist and philosopher and contemporary of Heidegger who claimed that individual authenticity required a joining with the \\"transcendent other,\\" traditionally known as God.

Isotopic analysis can be used to understand the flow of energy through a food web, to reconstruct past environmental and climatic conditions, to investigate human and animal diets in the past, for food authentification, and a variety of other physical, geological, palaeontological and chemical processes. Stable isotope ratios are measured using mass spectrometry, which separates the different isotopes of an element on the basis of their mass-to-charge ratio. Tissue affected Isotopic oxygen is incorporated into the body primarily through ingestion at which point it is used in the formation of, for archaeological purposes, bones and teeth. The oxygen is incorporated into the hydroxylcarbonic apatite of bone and tooth enamel. Bone is continually remodelled throughout the lifetime of an individual. Although the rate of turnover of isotopic oxygen in hydroxyapatite is not fully known, it is assumed to be similar to that of collagen; approximately 10 years. Consequently, should an individual remain in a region for 10 years or longer, the isotopic oxygen ratios in the bone hydroxyapatite would reflect the oxygen ratios present in that region. Teeth are not subject to continual remodelling and so their isotopic oxygen ratios remain constant from the time of formation. The isotopic oxygen ratios, then, of teeth represent the ratios of the region in which the individual was born and raised. Where deciduous teeth are present, it is also possible to determine the age at which a child was weaned. Breast milk production draws upon the body water of the mother, which has higher levels of 18O due to the preferential loss of 16O through sweat, urine, and expired water vapour. While teeth are more resistant to chemical and physical changes over time, both are subject to post-depositional diagenesis. As such, isotopic analysis makes use of the more resistant phosphate groups, rather than the less abundant hydroxyl group or the more likely diagenetic carbonate groups present.  Applications  Isotope analysis has widespread applicability in the natural sciences. These include numerous applications in the biological, earth and environmental sciences. = Archaeology =  Reconstructing ancient diets  Archaeological materials, such as bone, organic residues, hair, or sea shells, can serve as substrates for isotopic analysis. Carbon, nitrogen and zinc isotope ratios are used to investigate the diets of past people; These isotopic systems can be used with others, such as strontium or oxygen, to answer questions about population movements and cultural interactions, such as trade. Carbon isotopes are analysed in archaeology to determine the source of carbon at the base of the foodchain. Examining the 12C/13C isotope ratio, it is possible to determine whether animals and humans ate predominantly C3 or C4 plants. Potential C3 food sources include wheat, rice, tubers, fruits, nuts and many vegetables, while C4 food sources include millet and sugar cane. Carbon isotope ratios can also be used to distinguish between marine, freshwater, and terrestrial food sources. Carbon isotope ratios can be measured in bone collagen or bone mineral (hydroxylapatite), and each of these fractions of bone can be analysed to shed light on different components of diet. The carbon in bone collagen is predominantly sourced from dietary protein, while the carbon found in bone mineral is sourced from all consumed dietary carbon, included carbohydrates, lipids, and protein. To obtain an accurate picture of palaeodiets, it is important to understand processes of diagenesis that may affect the original isotopic signal. It is also important for the researcher to know the variations of isotopes within individuals, between individuals, and over time.  Sourcing archaeological materials  Isotope analysis has been particularly useful in archaeology as a means of characterization. Characterization of artifacts involves determining the isotopic composition of possible source materials such as metal ore bodies and comparing these data to the isotopic composition of analyzed artifacts. A wide range of archaeological materials such as metals, glass and lead-based pigments have been sourced using isotopic characterization. Particularly in the Bronze Age Mediterranean, lead isotope analysis has been a useful tool for determining the sources of metals and an important indicator of trade patterns. Interpretation of lead isotope data is, however, often contentious and faces numerous instrumental and methodological challenges. Problems such as the mixing and re-using of metals from different sources, limited reliable data and contamination of samples can be difficult problems in interpretation. = Ecology = All biologically active elements exist in a number of different isotopic forms, of which two or more are stable. For example, most carbon is present as 12C, with approximately 1% being 13C. The ratio of the two isotopes may be altered by biological and geophysical processes, and these differences can be utilized in a number of ways by ecologists. The main elements used in isotope ecology are carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and sulfur, but also include silicon, iron, and strontium. Stable isotope analysis in aquatic ecosystems Stable isotopes have become a popular method for understanding aquatic ecosystems because they can help scientists in understanding source links and process information in marine food webs. These analyses can also be used to a certain degree in terrestrial systems. Certain isotopes can signify distinct primary producers forming the bases of food webs and trophic level positioning. The stable isotope compositions are expressed in terms of delta values (Œ¥) in permil (‚Ä∞), i.e. parts per thousand differences from a standard. They express the proportion of an isotope that is in a sample. The values are expressed as: : Œ¥X = [(Rsample / Rstandard) ‚Äì 1] √ó 103 where X represents the isotope of interest (e.g., 13C) and R represents the ratio of the isotope of interest and its natural form (e.g., 13C/12C). Higher (or less negative) delta values indicate increases in a sample's isotope of interest, relative to the standard, and lower (or more negative) values indicate decreases. The standard reference materials for carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur are Pee Dee Belamnite limestone, nitrogen gas in the atmosphere, and Ca√±on Diablo meteorite respectively. Analysis is usually done using a mass spectrometer, detecting small differences between gaseous elements. Analysis of a sample can cost anywhere from $30 to $100. Stable isotopes assist scientists in analyzing animal diets and food webs by examining the animal tissues that bear a fixed isotopic enrichment or depletion vs. the diet. Muscle or protein fractions have become the most common animal tissue used to examine the isotopes because they represent the assimilated nutrients in their diet. The main advantage to using stable isotope analysis as opposed to stomach content observations is that no matter what the status is of the animal's stomach (empty or not), the isotope tracers in the tissues will give us an understanding of its trophic position and food source. The three major isotopes used in aquatic ecosystem food web analysis are 13C, 15N and 34S. While all three indicate information on trophic dynamics, it is common to perform analysis on at least two of the previously mentioned 3 isotopes for better understanding of marine trophic interactions and for stronger results. =Carbon-13= Carbon isotopes aid us in determining the primary production source responsible for the energy flow in an ecosystem. The transfer of 13C through trophic levels remains relatively the same, except for a small increase (an enrichment < 1 ‚Ä∞). Large differences of Œ¥13C between animals indicate that they have different food sources or that their food webs are based on different primary producers (i.e. different species of phytoplankton, marsh grasses.) Because Œ¥13C indicates the original source of primary producers, the isotopes can also help us determine shifts in diets, both short term, long term or permanent. These shifts may even correlate to seasonal changes, reflecting phytoplankton abundance. Scientists have found that there can be wide ranges of Œ¥13C values in phytoplankton populations over a geographic region. While it is not quite certain as to why this may be, there are several hypotheses for this occurrence. These include isotopes within dissolved inorganic carbon pools (DIC) may vary with temperature and location and that growth rates of phytoplankton may affect their uptake of the isotopes. Œ¥13C has been used in determining migration of juvenile animals from sheltered inshore areas to offshore locations by examining the changes in their diets. A study by Fry (1983) studied the isotopic compositions in juvenile shrimp of south Texas grass flats. Fry found that at the beginning of the study the shrimp had isotopic values of Œ¥13C = -11 to -14‚Ä∞ and 6-8‚Ä∞ for Œ¥15N and Œ¥34S. As the shrimp matured and migrated offshore, the isotopic values changed to those resembling offshore organisms (Œ¥13C= -15‚Ä∞ and Œ¥15N = 11.5‚Ä∞ and Œ¥34S = 16‚Ä∞). =Sulfur-34= While there is no enrichment of 34S between trophic levels, the stable isotope can be useful in distinguishing benthic vs. pelagic producers and marsh vs. phytoplankton producers. Similar to 13C, it can also help distinguish between different phytoplankton as the key primary producers in food webs. The differences between seawater sulfates and sulfides (c. 21‚Ä∞ vs -10‚Ä∞) aid scientists in the discriminations. Sulfur tends to be more plentiful in less aerobic areas, such as benthic systems and marsh plants, than the pelagic and more aerobic systems. Thus, in the benthic systems, there are smaller Œ¥34S values. =Nitrogen-15= Nitrogen isotopes indicate the trophic level position of organisms (reflective of the time the tissue samples were taken). There is a larger enrichment component with Œ¥15N because its retention is higher than that of 14N. This can be seen by analyzing the waste of organisms. Cattle urine has shown that there is a depletion of 15N relative to the diet. As organisms eat each other, the 15N isotopes are transferred to the predators. Thus, organisms higher in the trophic pyramid have accumulated higher levels of 15N ( and higher Œ¥15N values) relative to their prey and others before them in the food web. Numerous studies on marine ecosystems have shown that on average there is a 3.2‚Ä∞ enrichment of 15N vs. diet between different trophic level species in ecosystems. In the Baltic sea, Hansson et al. (1997) found that when analyzing a variety of creatures (such as particulate organic matter (phytoplankton), zooplankton, mysids, sprat, smelt and herring,) there was an apparent fractionation of 2.4‚Ä∞ between consumers and their apparent prey. In addition to trophic positioning of organisms, Œ¥15N values have become commonly used in distinguishing between land derived and natural sources of nutrients. As water travels from septic tanks to aquifers, the nitrogen rich water is delivered into coastal areas. Waste-water nitrate has higher concentrations of 15N than the nitrate that is found in natural soils in near shore zones. For bacteria, it is more convenient for them to uptake 14N as opposed to 15N because it is a lighter element and easier to metabolize. Thus, due to bacteria's preference when performing biogeochemical processes such as denitrification and volatilization of ammonia, 14N is removed from the water at a faster rate than 15N, resulting in more 15N entering the aquifer. 15N is roughly 10-20‚Ä∞ as opposed to the natural 15N values of 2-8‚Ä∞. The inorganic nitrogen that is emitted from septic tanks and other human-derived sewage is usually in the form of NH4+. Once the nitrogen enters the estuaries via groundwater, it is thought that because there is more 15N entering, that there will also be more 15N in the inorganic nitrogen pool delivered and that it is picked up more by producers taking up N. Even though 14N is easier to take up, because there is much more 15N, there will still be higher amounts assimilated than normal. These levels of Œ¥15N can be examined in creatures that live in the area and are non migratory (such as macrophytes, clams and even some fish). This method of identifying high levels of nitrogen input is becoming a more and more popular method in attempting to monitor nutrient input into estuaries and coastal ecosystems. Environmental managers have become more and more concerned about measuring anthropogenic nutrient inputs into estuaries because excess in nutrients can lead to eutrophication and hypoxic events, eliminating organisms from an area entirely. =Oxygen-18= Analysis of the ratio of 18O to 16O in the shells of the Colorado Delta clam was used to assess the historical extent of the estuary in the Colorado River Delta prior to construction of upstream dams. =Hydrogen-2= The ratio of 2H, also known as deuterium, to 1H has been studied in both plant and animal tissue. Hydrogen isotopes in plant tissue are correlated with local water values but vary based on fractionation during photosynthesis, transpiration, and other processes in the formation of cellulose. A study on the isotope ratios of tissues from plants growing within a small area in Texas found tissues from CAM plants were enriched in deuterium relative to C4 plants. Hydrogen isotope ratios in animal tissue reflect diet, including drinking water, and have been used to study bird migration and aquatic food webs. = Forensic science = A recent development in forensic science is the isotopic analysis of hair strands. Hair has a recognisable growth rate of 9-11mm per month or 15 cm per year. Human hair growth is primarily a function of diet, especially drinking water intake. The stable isotopic ratios of drinking water are a function of location, and the geology that the water percolates through. 87Sr, 88Sr and oxygen isotope variations are different all over the world. These differences in isotopic ratio are then biologically 'set' in our hair as it grows and it has therefore become possible to identify recent geographic histories by the analysis of hair strands. For example, it could be possible to identify whether a terrorist suspect had recently been to a particular location from hair analysis. This hair analysis is a non-invasive method which is becoming very popular in cases that DNA or other traditional means are bringing no answers. Isotope analysis can be used by forensic investigators to determine whether two or more samples of explosives are of a common origin. Most high explosives contain carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen atoms and thus comparing their relative abundances of isotopes can reveal the existence of a common origin. Researchers have also shown that analysis of the 12C/13C ratios can locate the country of origin for a given explosive. Stable isotopic analysis has also been used in the identification of drug trafficking routes. Isotopic abundances are different in morphine grown from poppies in south-east Asia versus poppies grown in south-west Asia. The same is applied to cocaine that is derived from Bolivia and that from Colombia. = Traceability = Stable isotopic analysis has also been used for tracing the geographical origin of food and timber. = Geology = = Hydrology = In isotope hydrology, stable isotopes of water (2H and 18O) are used to estimate the source, age, and flow paths of water flowing through ecosystems. The main effects that change the stable isotope composition of water are evaporation and condensation. Variability in water isotopes is used to study sources of water to streams and rivers, evaporation rates, groundwater recharge, and other hydrological processes. = Paleoclimatology = The ratio of 18O to 16O in ice and deep sea cores is temperature dependent, and can be used as a proxy measure for reconstructing climate change. During colder periods of the Earth's history (glacials) such as during the ice ages, 16O is preferentially evaporated from the colder oceans, leaving the slightly heavier and more sluggish 18O behind. Organisms such as foraminifera which combine oxygen dissolved in the surrounding water with carbon and calcium to build their shells therefore incorporate the temperature-dependent 18O to 16O ratio. When these organisms die, they settle out on the sea bed, preserving a long and invaluable record of global climate change through much of the Quaternary. Similarly, ice cores on land are enriched in the heavier 18O relative to 16O during warmer climatic phases (interglacials) as more energy is available for the evaporation of the heavier 18O isotope. The oxygen isotope record preserved in the ice cores is therefore a \\"mirror\\" of the record contained in ocean sediments. Oxygen isotopes preserve a record of the effects of the Milankovitch cycles on climate change during the Quaternary, revealing an approximately 100,000-year cyclicity in the Earth's climate.

Production and properties An appropriate refined clay is formed to the desired shape. After drying it is placed in a kiln or atop combustible material in a pit, and then fired. The typical firing temperature is around , though it may be as low as in historic and archaeological examples.Grove, 1 The iron content, reacting with oxygen during firing, gives the fired body a reddish color, though the overall color varies widely across shades of yellow, orange, buff, red, \\"terracotta\\", pink, grey or brown.Grove, 1 Fired terracotta is not watertight, but surface-burnishing the body before firing can decrease its porousness and a layer of glaze can make it watertight. It is suitable for use below ground to carry pressurized water (an archaic use), for garden pots or building decoration in many environments, and for oil containers, oil lamps, or ovens. Most other uses, such as for tableware, sanitary piping, or building decoration in freezing environments, require the material to be glazed. Terracotta, if uncracked, will ring if lightly struck. Painted (polychrome) terracotta is typically first covered with a thin coat of gesso, then painted. It has been very widely used but the paint is only suitable for indoor positions and is much less durable than fired colors in or under a ceramic glaze. Terracotta sculpture was very rarely left in its \\"raw\\" fired state in the West until the 18th century.Grove, 2, i, a In art history Terracotta female figurines were uncovered by archaeologists in excavations of Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan (3000‚Äì1500 BC). Along with phallus-shaped stones, these suggest some sort of fertility cult. The Burney Relief is an outstanding terracotta plaque from Ancient Mesopotamia of about 1950 BC.

They were part of a wide range of Greek terracotta figurines, which included larger and higher-quality works such as the Aphrodite Heyl; the Romans too made great numbers of small figurines, often religious. Etruscan art often used terracotta in preference to stone even for larger statues, such as the near life-size Apollo of Veii and the Sarcophagus of the Spouses. Campana reliefs are Ancient Roman terracotta reliefs, originally mostly used to make friezes for the outside of buildings, as a cheaper substitute for stone. Indian sculpture made heavy use of terracotta from as early as the Indus Valley Civilization (with stone and metal sculpture being rather rare), and in more sophisticated areas had largely abandoned modeling for using molds by the 1st century BC. This allows relatively large figures, nearly up to life-size, to be made, especially in the Gupta period and the centuries immediately following it. Several vigorous local popular traditions of terracotta folk sculpture remain active today, such as the Bankura horses.Grove, 5 Precolonial West African sculpture also made extensive use of terracotta.H. Meyerowitz; V. Meyerowitz (1939). \\"Bronzes and Terra-Cottas from Ile-Ife\\". The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs 75 (439), 150‚Äì152; 154‚Äì155. The regions most recognized for producing terracotta art in that part of the world include the Nok culture of central and north- central Nigeria, the Ife/Benin cultural axis in western and southern Nigeria (also noted for its exceptionally naturalistic sculpture), and the Igbo culture area of eastern Nigeria, which excelled in terracotta pottery. These related, but separate, traditions also gave birth to elaborate schools of bronze and brass sculpture in the area.Grove, 3 Chinese sculpture made great use of terracotta, with and without glazing and colour, from a very early date. The famous Terracotta Army of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, 209‚Äì210 BC, was somewhat untypical, and two thousand years ago reliefs were more common, in tombs and elsewhere. Later Buddhist figures were often made in painted and glazed terracotta, with the Yixian glazed pottery luohans, probably of 1150‚Äì1250, now in various Western museums, among the finest examples.Rawson, 140-145; Grove, 4 Brick-built tombs from the Han dynasty were often finished on the interior wall with bricks decorated on one face; the techniques included molded reliefs. Later tombs contained many figures of protective spirits and animals and servants for the afterlife, including the famous horses of the T'ang dynasty; as an arbitrary matter of terminology these tend not to be referred to as terracottas.Rawson, 140-145,159-161 European medieval art made little use of terracotta sculpture, until the late 14th century, when it became used in advanced International Gothic workshops in parts of Germany.Schultz, 67-68 The Virgin illustrated at the start of the article from Bohemia is the unique example known from there.Bust of the Virgin, ca. 1390‚Äì95, In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000‚Äì. (October 2008) A few decades later there was a revival in the Italian Renaissance, inspired by excavated classical terracottas as well as the German examples, which gradually spread to the rest of Europe. In Florence Luca della Robbia (1399/1400‚Äì1482) was a sculptor who founded a family dynasty specializing in glazed and painted terracotta, especially large roundels which were used to decorate the exterior of churches and other buildings. These used the same techniques as contemporary maiolica and other tin-glazed pottery. Other sculptors included Pietro Torrigiano (1472‚Äì1528), who produced statues, and in England busts of the Tudor royal family. The unglazed busts of the Roman Emperors adorning Hampton Court Palace, by Giovanni da Maiano, 1521, were another example of Italian work in England.Grove, \\"Florence\\" They were originally painted but this has now been lost from weathering. The River Rhine Separating the Waters; by Claude Michel; 1765; terracotta; 27.9 √ó 45.7 √ó 30.5 cm; Kimbell Art Museum (Fort Worth, Texas, US) In the 18th-century unglazed terracotta, which had long been used for preliminary clay models or maquettes that were then fired, became fashionable as a material for small sculptures including portrait busts. It was much easier to work than carved materials, and allowed a more spontaneous approach by the artist.Draper and Scherf, 2-7 and throughout; Grove, 2, i, a and c Claude Michel (1738‚Äì1814), known as Clodion, was an influential pioneer in France.Well covered in Draper and Scherf, see index; Grove, 2, i, a and c John Michael Rysbrack (1694‚Äì1770), a Flemish portrait sculptor working in England, sold his terracotta modelli for larger works in stone, and produced busts only in terracotta.Grove, 2, i, c In the next century the French sculptor Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse made many terracotta pieces,Grove, 2, i, d but possibly the most famous is The Abduction of Hippodameia depicting the Greek mythological scene of a centaur kidnapping Hippodameia on her wedding day. =Architecture= Imperial roof decoration in the Forbidden City Terracotta tiles have a long history in many parts of the world. Many ancient and traditional roofing styles included more elaborate sculptural elements than the plain roof tiles, such as Chinese Imperial roof decoration and the antefix of western classical architecture. In India West Bengal made a speciality of terracotta temples, with the sculpted decoration from the same material as the main brick construction. In the 19th century the possibilities of terracotta decoration of buildings were again appreciated by architects, often using thicker pieces of terracotta, and surfaces that are not flat.Grove, 2, ii The American architect Louis Sullivan is well known for his elaborate glazed terracotta ornamentation, designs that would have been impossible to execute in any other medium. Terracotta and tile were used extensively in the town buildings of Victorian Birmingham, England. By about 1930 the widespread use of concrete and Modernist architecture largely ended the use of terracotta in architecture.Grove, 2, ii, c and d Along with serving decorative purposes, terracotta tile is also a flooring construct. In fact, terracotta floors are found worldwide with some being several hundred years old. The quality of terracotta tiles are directly impacted by factors including 1) source of the clay (Mexican Saltillo terracotta tile is known as a most durable regional clay tile, 2) manufacturing methods (sun-baked vs kiln fired (more durable method), and 3) unsealed terracotta tile vs sealed terracotta tile (known to be most fortified). Advantages in sculpture As compared to bronze sculpture, terracotta uses a far simpler and quicker process for creating the finished work with much lower material costs. The easier task of modelling, typically with a limited range of knives and wooden shaping tools, but mainly using the fingers,Grove, 2, i, a; Scultz, 167 allows the artist to take a more free and flexible approach. Small details that might be impractical to carve in stone, of hair or costume for example, can easily be accomplished in terracotta, and drapery can sometimes be made up of thin sheets of clay that make it much easier to achieve a realistic effect.Scultz, 67, 167 Reusable mold-making techniques may be used for production of many identical pieces. Compared to marble sculpture and other stonework the finished product is far lighter and may be further painted and glazed to produce objects with color or durable simulations of metal patina. Robust durable works for outdoor use require greater thickness and so will be heavier, with more care needed in the drying of the unfinished piece to prevent cracking as the material shrinks. Structural considerations are similar to those required for stone sculpture; there is a limit on the stress that can be imposed on terracotta, and terracotta statues of unsupported standing figures are limited to well under life-size unless extra structural support is added. This is also because large figures are extremely difficult to fire, and surviving examples often show sagging or cracks. The Yixian figures were fired in several pieces, and have iron rods inside to hold the structure together.Lecture by Derek Gillman at the Penn Museum, on their example and the group of Yixian figures. From YouTube India In India traditional terracotta sculptures, mainly religious, continue to be made. The demand for this craft is seasonal, mostly when new pottery and votive idols are required during harvest festival. During the rest of the year, the craftsmen take to agriculture or some other means of income. The designs have become redundant when the same kind of relief and same techniques are used for the different subjects. The subjects and the uses are suggested by the client. This craft requires a strong understanding of composition and subject matter as well as a skill to be able to give each plaque its distinct character with patience.https://gaatha.org/igaatha/details_craft/Techniques/Terracotta- work/Molela-terracota-detail-research Gallery See also * Cittacotte * John Marriott Blashfield, terracotta manufacturer * Kulhar ‚Äì traditional terracotta cups * Majapahit Terracotta * Redware * Structural clay tile * Tile Heritage Foundation * Saltillo Terracotta Tile Notes References * Draper, James David and Scherf, Guilhem (eds.), Playing with Fire: European Terracotta Models, 1740-1840, 2003, Metropolitan Museum of Art, , 9781588390998, fully available on Google books * \\"Grove\\" = C.

In some cases, it is interpreted as the ability to verify the history, location, or application of an item by means of documented recorded identification.\\"Glossary,\\" ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section III, Article NCA-9000 Other common definitions include the capability (and implementation) of keeping track of a given set or type of information to a given degree, or the ability to chronologically interrelate uniquely identifiable entities in a way that is verifiable. Traceability is applicable to measurement, supply chain, software development, healthcare and security. Measurement The term measurement traceability is used to refer to an unbroken chain of comparisons relating an instrument's measurements to a known standard. Calibration to a traceable standard can be used to determine an instrument's bias, precision, and accuracy. It may also be used to show a chain of custody - from current interpretation of evidence to the actual evidence in a legal context, or history of handling of any information. In many countries, national standards for weights and measures are maintained by a National Metrological Institute (NMI) which provides the highest level of standards for the calibration / measurement traceability infrastructure in that country. Examples of government agencies include the National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL) the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the USA, the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Germany, and the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRiM) in Italy. As defined by NIST, \\"Traceability of measurement requires the establishment of an unbroken chain of comparisons to stated references each with a stated uncertainty.\\" A clock providing ' is traceable to a time standard such as Coordinated Universal Time or International Atomic Time. The Global Positioning System is a source of traceable time. Supply chain In the supply chain, traceability may be both a regulatory and an ethical or environmental issue.Moyer-Lee, J. and M. Prowse (2015) ‚ÄòHow Traceability is Restructuring Malawi‚Äôs Tobacco Industry‚Äô Development Policy Review 33:2 http://web.unitn.it/files/download/34693/moyer- leeandprowse2012iobworkingpaper-traceabilityandtobaccoinmalawi.pdf Environmentally friendly retailers may choose to make information regarding their supply chain freely available to customers, illustrating the fact that the products they sell are manufactured in factories with safe working conditions, by workers that earn a fair wage, using methods that do not damage the environment. =Materials= In regard to materials, traceability refers to the capability to associate a finished part with destructive test results performed on material from the same ingot with the same heat treatment, or to associate a finished part with results of a test performed on a sample from the same melt identified by the unique lot number of the material. Destructive tests typically include chemical composition and mechanical strength tests. A heat number is usually marked on the part or raw material which identifies the ingot it came from, and a lot number may identify the group of parts that experienced the same heat treatment (i.e., were in the same oven at the same time). Material traceability is important to the aerospace, nuclear, and process industry because they frequently make use of high strength materials that look identical to commercial low strength versions. In these industries, a part made of the wrong material is called \\"counterfeit,\\" even if the substitution was accidental. This same practice extends throughout industries using military hardware, including the fastener industry. =Logistics= In logistics, traceability refers to the capability for tracing goods along the distribution chain on a batch number or series number basis. Traceability is an important aspect for example in the automotive industry, where it makes recalls possible, or in the food industry where it contributes to food safety. The international standards organization EPCglobal under GS1 has ratified the EPCglobal Network standards (especially the EPC Information Services EPCIS standard) which codify the syntax and semantics for supply chain events and the secure method for selectively sharing supply chain events with trading partners. These standards for traceability have been used in successful deployments in many industries and there are now a wide range of products that are certified as being compatible with these standards. =Food processing= In food processing (meat processing, fresh produce processing), the term traceability refers to the recording through means of barcodes or RFID tags & other tracking media, all movement of product and steps within the production process. One of the key reasons this is such a critical point is in instances where an issue of contamination arises, and a recall is required. Where traceability has been closely adhered to, it is possible to identify, by precise date/time & exact location which goods must be recalled, and which are safe, potentially saving millions of dollars in the recall process. Traceability within the food processing industry is also utilised to identify key high production & quality areas of a business, versus those of low return, and where points in the production process may be improved. In food processing software, traceability systems imply the use of a unique piece of data (e.g., order date/time or a serialized sequence number, generally through the use of a barcode / RFID) which can be traced through the entire production flow, linking all sections of the business, including suppliers & future sales through the supply chain. Messages and files at any point in the system can then be audited for correctness and completeness, using the traceability software to find the particular transaction and/or product within the supply chain. The European Union's General Food Law came into force in 2002, making traceability compulsory for food and feed operators and requiring those businesses to implement traceability systems. The EU introduced its Trade Control and Expert System, or TRACES, in April 2004. The system provides a central database to track movement of animals within the EU and from third countries.General Food Law  Food Safety Australia has its National Livestock Identification System to keep track of livestock from birth to slaughterhouse. India has started taking initiatives for setting up traceability systems at Government and Corporate levels. Grapenet,http://www.apeda.gov.in/apedawebsite/Grapenet/GrapeNet_new.htm an initiative by Agriculture and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), Ministry of Commerce, Government of India is an example in this direction. GrapeNet is an internet based traceability software system for monitoring fresh grapes exported from India to the European Union. GrapeNet is a first of its kind initiative in India that has put in place an end-to-end system for monitoring pesticide residue, achieve product standardization and facilitate tracing back from pallets to the farm of the Indian grower, through the various stages of sampling, testing, certification and packing. Grapenet won the National Award (Gold), in the winners announced for the best e-Governance initiatives undertaken in India in 2007. Grapenet was designed and developed by Logicsoft,Case Study - HortiNet ‚Äì Traceability System for Horticulture Products from India award-winning traceability solutions company, based in New Delhi, India. The Directorate Generate Foreign Trade (DGFT), Government of India, through its notification No.84(RE-2008)/2004-2009 dated 04.02.2009 relating to Amendment in Foreign Trade Policy (RE2008)has mandated that Export to the European Union is permitted subject to registration with APEDA, thereby making Grapenet mandatory for all exports of fresh grapes from India to Europe. Uruguay has also designed a system called Traceability & Electronic Information System of the Beef Industry.http://www.inac.gub.uy/innovanet/macros/TextContentWithMenu.jsp?contentid=4057&version;=1&site;=1&channel;=innova.net =Forest products= Within the context of supporting legal and sustainable forest supply chains, traceability has emerged in the last decade as a new tool to verify claims and assure buyers about the source of their materials. Mostly led out of Europe, and targeting countries where illegal logging has been a key problem (FLEGT countries), timber tracking is now part of daily business for many enterprises and jurisdictions. Full traceability offers advantages for multiple partners along the supply chain beyond certification systems, including: * Mechanism to comply with local and international policies and regulations. * Reducing the risk of illegal or non-compliant material entering the supply chains. * Providing coordination between authorities and relevant bodies. * Allowing automatic reconciliation of batches and volumes available. * Offering a method of stock control and monitoring. * Triggering real-time alerts of non-compliance. * Reducing likelihood of recording errors. * Improving effectiveness and efficiency. * Increasing transparency. * Promoting company integrity. A number of timber tracking companies are in operation to service global demand. Enhanced traceability ensures that the supply chain data is 100% accurate from the forest to the point of export. Nowadays, there are techniques to predict geographical provenance of wood and contribute to the fight against illegal logging. Systems and software development In systems and software development, the term traceability (or requirements traceability) refers to the ability to link product requirements back to stakeholders' rationales and forward to corresponding design artifacts, code, and test cases. Traceability supports numerous software engineering activities such as change impact analysis, compliance verification or traceback of code, regression test selection, and requirements validation. It is usually accomplished in the form of a matrix created for the verification and validation of the project. Unfortunately, the practice of constructing and maintaining a requirements trace matrix (RTM) can be very arduous and over time the traces tend to erode into an inaccurate state unless date/time stamped. Alternate automated approaches for generating traces using information retrieval methods have been developed. In transaction processing software, traceability implies use of a unique piece of data (e.g., order date/time or a serialized sequence number) which can be traced through the entire software flow of all relevant application programs. Messages and files at any point in the system can then be audited for correctness and completeness, using the traceability key to find the particular transaction. This is also sometimes referred to as the transaction footprint.  Health care  Patient safety during healthcare service plays an important role in preventing delayed recovery or even mortality, by increasing and improving the quality of life of citizens, and is considered an indicator of the quality status of health services Maintaining patient safety is a complex task and involves factors inherent to the environment and human actions. New technologies facilitate the traceability tools of patients and medications. This is particularly relevant for drugs that are considered high risk and cost. 50x50px This content is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

It was the first tonal method to be used, enabling half- tones to be produced without using line- or dot-based techniques like hatching, cross-hatching or stipple. Mezzotint achieves tonality by roughening a metal plate with thousands of little dots made by a metal tool with small teeth, called a \\"rocker\\". In printing, the tiny pits in the plate retain the ink when the face of the plate is wiped clean. This technique can achieve a high level of quality and richness in the print. Mezzotint is often combined with other intaglio techniques, usually etching and engraving. The process was especially widely used in England from the eighteenth century, to reproduce portraits and other paintings. It was somewhat in competition with the other main tonal technique of the day, aquatint. Since the mid-nineteenth century it has been relatively little used, as lithography and other techniques produced comparable results more easily. Robert Kipniss and Peter Ilsted are two notable 20th-century exponents of the technique; M. C. Escher also made eight mezzotints. History The first known mezzotint, by Ludwig von Siegen, 1642. Worked from light to dark. The mezzotint printmaking method was invented by the German amateur artist Ludwig von Siegen (1609‚Äì). His earliest mezzotint print dates to 1642 and is a portrait of Countess Amalie Elisabeth of Hanau- M√ºnzenberg. This was made by working from light to dark. The rocker seems to have been invented by Prince Rupert of the Rhine, a famous cavalry commander in the English Civil War, who was the next to use the process, and took it to England. Sir Peter Lely saw the potential for using it to publicise his portraits, and encouraged a number of Dutch printmakers to come to England. Godfrey Kneller worked closely with John Smith, who is said to have lived in his house for a period; he created about 500 mezzotints, some 300 copies of portrait paintings. British mezzotint collecting was a great craze from about 1760 to the Great Crash of 1929, also spreading to America. The main area of collecting was British portraits; hit oil paintings from the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition were routinely, and profitably, reproduced in mezzotint throughout this period, and other mezzotinters reproduced older portraits of historical figures, or if necessary, made them up. The favourite period to collect was roughly from 1750 to 1820, the great period of the British portrait. There were two basic styles of collection: some concentrated on making a complete collection of material within a certain scope, while others aimed at perfect condition and quality (which declines in mezzotints after a relatively small number of impressions are taken from a plate), and in collecting the many \\"proof states\\" which artists and printers had obligingly provided for them from early on. Leading collectors included William Eaton, 2nd Baron Cheylesmore and the Irishman John Chaloner Smith.Griffiths, 134‚Äì137 and 141‚Äì142 Light to dark method Early mezzotint by Wallerant Vaillant, Siegen's assistant or tutor. Young man reading, with statue of Cupid. Probably made using light to dark technique. The first mezzotints by Ludwig von Siegen were made using the light to dark method. The metal plate was tooled to create indentations and parts of the image that were to stay light in tone were kept smooth. This method was referred to as the ‚ÄòAdditive method‚Äô; that is, adding areas of indentations to the plate for the areas of the print that were to appear darker in tone. This technique meant that is was possible to create the image directly by only roughening a blank plate selectively, where the darker parts of the image are to be. By varying the degree of smoothing, mid-tones between black and white can be created, hence the name mezzo-tinto which is Italian for \\"half-tone\\" or \\"half-painted\\". Dark to light method This became the most common method. The whole surface (usually) of a metal, usually copper, plate is roughened evenly, manually with a rocker, or mechanically. If the plate were printed at this point it would show as solid black. The image is then created by selectively burnishing areas of the surface of the metal plate with metal tools; the smoothed parts will print lighter than those areas not smoothed by the burnishing tool. Areas smoothed completely flat will not hold ink at all; such areas will print \\"white,\\" that is, the color of the paper without ink. This is called working from \\"dark to light\\", or the \\"subtractive\\" method. Jacob Christoph Le Blon used the dark to light method and invented the three and four-color mezzotint printing technique by using a separate metal plate for each color. Le Blon's color printing method applied the [RYB color model] approach whereby red, yellow and blue were used to create a larger gamut of color nuances. In Coloritto, Le Blon refers to red, yellow and blue as 'Primitive' colors and that red and yellow make orange; red and blue, make purple/violet; and blue and yellow make green (Le Blon, 1725, p6). Printing Printing the finished plate is the same for either method, and follows the normal way for an intaglio plate; the whole surface is inked, the ink is then wiped off the surface to leave ink only in the pits of the still rough areas below the original surface of the plate. The plate is put through a high-pressure printing press next to a sheet of paper, and the process repeated. Because the pits in the plate are not deep, only a small number of top-quality impressions (copies) can be printed before the quality of the tone starts to degrade as the pressure of the press begins to smooth them out. Perhaps only one or two hundred really good impressions can be taken. Detailed technique Plates can be mechanically roughened; one way is to rub fine metal filings over the surface with a piece of glass; the finer the filings, the smaller the grain of the surface. Special roughening tools called 'rockers' have been in use since at least the eighteenth century. The method commonly in use today is to use a steel rocker approximately five inches wide, which has between 45 and 120 teeth per inch on the face of a blade in the shape of a shallow arc, with a wooden handle projecting upwards in a T-shape. Rocked steadily from side to side at the correct angle, the rocker will proceed forward creating burrs in the surface of the copper. The plate is then moved ‚Äì either rotated by a set number of degrees or through 90 degrees according to preference ‚Äì and then rocked in another pass. This is repeated until the plate is roughened evenly and will print a completely solid tone of black. Tone Mezzotint is known for the luxurious quality of its tones: first, because an evenly, finely roughened surface holds a lot of ink, allowing deep solid colors to be printed; secondly because the process of smoothing the plate with burin, burnisher and scraper allows fine gradations in tone to be developed. The scraper is a triangular ended tool, and the burnisher has a smooth round end ‚Äì not unlike many spoon handles.

A design is cut into the linoleum surface with a sharp knife, V-shaped chisel or gouge, with the raised (uncarved) areas representing a reversal (mirror image) of the parts to show printed. The linoleum sheet is inked with a roller (called a brayer), and then impressed onto paper or fabric. The actual printing can be done by hand or with a printing press. Origins Although linoleum is a floor covering that dates to the 1860s, the linocut printing technique was used first by the artists of Die Br√ºcke in Germany between 1905 and 1913, where it had been similarly used for wallpaper printing. Technique Using a handheld gouger to cut a design into linoleum for a linocut print Linocut printing; using a design cut into linoleum to make a print on paper Since the material being carved has no directional grain and does not tend to split, it is easier to obtain certain artistic effects with lino than with most woods, although the resultant prints lack the often angular grainy character of woodcuts and engravings. Lino is generally diced, much easier to cut than wood, especially when heated, but the pressure of the printing process degrades the plate faster and it is difficult to create larger works due to the material's fragility. Linocuts can also be achieved by the careful application of arts on the surface of the lino. This creates a surface similar to a soft ground etching and these caustic-lino plates can be printed in either a relief, intaglio or a viscosity printing manner. Colour linocuts can be made by using a different block for each colour as in a woodcut, as the artists of the Grosvenor School frequently did, but, as Pablo Picasso demonstrated, such prints can also be achieved using a single piece of linoleum in what is called the 'reductive' print method. Essentially, after each successive colour is imprinted onto the paper, the artist then cleans the lino plate and cuts away what will not be imprinted for the subsequently applied colour.Judging the Authenticity of Prints by The Masters by David Rudd Cycleback. Retrieved: 2011-12-17. Due to ease of use, linocut is widely used in schools to introduce children to the art of printmaking, using it to complete many tasks in the art lesson rather than going straight for the pencil and eraser; similarly, non-professional artists often cut lino rather than wood for printing. Nevertheless, in the contemporary art world the linocut is an established professional print medium, because of its extensive use by the artists of the Grosvenor School, followed by Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse.  Emergence of the technique in America  In 1911 ‚Äúlinoleum art‚Äù was first displayed in New York City by the Czech √©migr√© Vojtƒõch Preissig. In his publications on linocuts (1926-29) the respected American printmaker, Pedro Joseph de Lemos, simplified the methods for art schools and introduced new techniques for color linocuts, including the printing of the key block first. The first large-scale colour linocuts made by an American artist were created ca. 1943‚Äì45 by Walter Inglis Anderson, and exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum in 1949. Today, linocut is a popular technique among street artists and street art-related fine art. Selected artists \\"Born in the Soviet Union\\". Linocut by Peeter Allik. \\"Wet Afternoon\\".

One purpose is to allow the printmaker to print on a much more delicate surface, such as Japanese paper or linen, that pulls finer details off the plate. Another purpose is to provide a background colour behind the image that is different from the surrounding backing sheet. The final image will depend on the design and ink color of the printed image, the color and opacity of the paper to which the image is directly printed (plus any inclusions such as petals or fibers in that paper), and the color of the backing sheet. Etymology and history Chine-coll√© roughly translates from French chine = China, and coll√©, meaning glued or pasted. The word chine is used because the thin paper traditionally used in the process was imported to Europe from China, India and/or Japan. Chine-coll√© is sometimes mistakenly used to refer to any type of collage. Methods In the typical \\"direct print\\" method, the plate is inked; thin paper (such as rice paper) is dampened, placed on the inked plate and trimmed to size; paste is applied to the thin paper; and the ensemble (plate plus thin paper with paste) is placed on a dampened backing sheet. This is then run through a printing press.Grant, Steve. What is Chine-Coll√©? 15th Street Gallery, 08 May 2013. Retrieved on 03 October 2014. In the pressure of the press, the ink is transferred to the thin paper, and the thin paper is simultaneously adhered to the backing paper. An advantage of this method is that the thin paper will be exactly the desired size, since it is trimmed to size and then quickly affixed in place. Another way of printing the direct method is to have the thin paper already cut to size before preparing the plate to print. The heavier print paper has been put in the bath and dampened according to the printmaker's preference, then set aside. If the thin paper was painted on, it has been dried and is also set aside, ready. The plate is inked and wiped then placed on the press face up. Thin paste is brushed on the back of the rice paper and it is placed face down on the plate and registered. The paste is put on just enough to coat but not saturate, which dampens the thin paper appropriately. If one tries to brush paste on a damp piece of rice paper, it will tear. The print paper is then placed on top of the pasted side of the thin paper, a sheet of newsprint added on top of the stack, and the felts then covering the stack. It is then run through the press. This process is less tricky to maneuver than the first method, is cleaner, and more accurate in registration. In the typical \\"pre-pasted\\" method, the thin paper (dry) is trimmed to the size of the plate, then paste is applied and allowed to dry. When the printmaker is ready to print, the paper is dampened to activate the paste and placed, paste-side up, on an inked plate. Then, the ensemble (plate plus thin paper with paste) is placed on a dampened backing sheet and run through a press as described above. An advantage of the pre- pasted method is that once dried, the paste-applied papers can be stored indefinitely, just like a lick-and-stick postage stamp. A disadvantage of this method is that because the paper is trimmed dry, the artist must take into account how much in each direction the paper will expand when it is dampened prior to printing. Paper Some artists have moved away from precise trimming of a single sheet of paper to the size of the printing plate when using this method. For example, some experiment with pre-cut shapes for a collage effect, or simultaneously adhere multiple overlapping pieces of paper under the printed image. A more traditional paper choice would be a fine paper made from gampi fiber. Some artists experiment with non-traditional papers, using such things as newspaper, ephemera, dress patterns, and book pages as the sheet to be printed on. Glue There is some variation in adhesives used for Chine-coll√©. Some artists are reported to use a dusting of flour right before pressing rather than paste. Some have tried using no adhesive at all, simply relying on the high pressure of the printing press and properties of the paper (fibers, sizing) to fuse the papers together similar to paper- making; however, this method may be variable and unreliable. More recently, some artists have turned to adhesives such as PVA glue or gel medium, rather than paste. In traditional paste-making for Chine-coll√©, wheat or rice starch is separated from gluten and other elements of wheat or rice flour. Pure starch is then cooked with distilled water to form a congealed gel. Finally the gel is passed through a fine sieve such as a piece of silk to form the paste. Starch-based pastes are considered archival, and are sometimes used in other paper-based applications, such as book binding, book repair and collage. References *Shure, Brian (2000).

The surface, or matrix, was historically a copper etching plate, but in contemporary work it can vary from zinc or glass to acrylic glass. The image is then transferred onto a sheet of paper by pressing the two together, usually using a printing-press. Monotypes can also be created by inking an entire surface and then, using brushes or rags, removing ink to create a subtractive image, e.g. creating lights from a field of opaque colour. The inks used may be oil based or water based. With oil based inks, the paper may be dry, in which case the image has more contrast, or the paper may be damp, in which case the image has a 10 percent greater range of tones. Monotyping produces a unique print, or monotype; most of the ink is removed during the initial pressing. Although subsequent reprintings are sometimes possible, they differ greatly from the first print and are generally considered inferior. These prints from the original plate are called \\"ghost prints.\\" A print made by pressing a new print onto another surface, effectively making the print into a plate, is called a \\"cognate\\". Stencils, watercolor, solvents, brushes, and other tools are often used to embellish a monotype print. Monotypes can be spontaneously executed and with no previous sketch. History Monotype by Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, probably a second impression There is still no certainty as to who was the inventor of the monotype process. The Italian artist Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione (1609‚Äì64) is often credited as being the first artist to produce monotypes. He made brushed sketches intended as finished and final works of art.Prints and Printmaking, Antony Griffiths, British Museum Press (in UK), 2nd ed., 1996 He began to make monotypes in the mid 1640s, normally working from black to white, and produced over twenty surviving ones, over half of which are set at night. It is believed that the Flemish artist Antoon Sallaert created his first monotypes in the early 1640s and is therefore to be regarded as the inventor of this printing process. Both artists used the new technique in different ways. Castiglione created most of his monotypes as black-field images by wiping away ink on a prepared plate thus producing white and grey lines. Sallaert, on the other hand, brushed bold, tapering lines onto the printing surface with meticulous precision. It is likely that Sallaert's monotype style was influenced by the chiaroscuro woodcuts of the Dutch engraver Hendrik Goltzius. Sallaert found in the monotype a technique which was the closest to drawing and oil sketching. His monotypes and drawings are characterised by swelling lines and tapering ends. He often added by hand white highlights to his monotypes.Todd D. Weyman, Two Early Monotypes by Sallaert, in: Print Quarterly Vol. 12, No. 2 (JUNE 1995), p. 164-169M. Royalton Kisch, A Monotype by Sallaert, in: Print Quarterly, 1988, V, n. 1, p. 60-61 Sallaert clearly appreciated in the monotype technique the freedom to design on a plate before printing it on paper.Kelley Notaro, An Exhibition of the Finest Monotypes from the Cleveland Museum of Art's Collection at The Cleveland Museum of Art site Visions of the Daughters of Albion, a combination by Blake of relief etching for the lines and monotype for the colour William Blake developed a different technique, painting on millboard in egg tempera to produce both new works and coloured impressions of his prints and book illustrations, including his Pity. Each impression was usually then worked over by hand, using ink and watercolour. Few other artists used the technique until Degas, who made several, often working on them further after printing ( Beside the Sea, 1876-7); Pissarro also made several. Paul Gauguin used a variant technique involving tracing, later taken up by Paul Klee. In the twentieth century the technique became more popular; examples include the extraordinary colorful monotypes created by Marc Chagall in the 1960s.Marc Chagall Monotypes, Gerald Cramer, Editor, Geneva 1966 Twenty-first century examples include works by Nicole Eisenman, Christopher Wool, Karen LaMonte, April Flanders, and Scott Swezy. Comparing monotypes to monoprints Historically, the terms monotype and monoprint were often used interchangeably.Singular impressions: the monotype in America. Joann Moser. Smithsonian Institution Press, 1997. More recently, however, they have come to refer to two different, though similar, types of printmaking. Both involve the transfer of ink from a plate to the paper, canvas, or other surface that will ultimately hold the work of art. In the case of monotypes, the plate is a featureless plate. It contains no features that will impart any definition to successive prints. The most common feature would be the etched or engraved line on a metal plate. In the absence of any permanent features on the surface of the plate, all articulation of imagery is dependent on one unique inking, resulting in one unique print. Additionally, the term monotype is often used for an image made by inking a non-absorbent surface with a solid colour, laying over it a piece of paper and drawing onto the back of the paper. When the paper is pulled off the resulting print consists of the line surrounded by ink picked up from the inked plate. The result has a chance element, often random and irregular which gives the print a certain charm, a technique famously used by British artist Tracey Emin, a graduate of the Royal College of Art, where the practice of monoprinting in general was regarded as \\"fake painting\\". Monoprints, on the other hand, now refers to the results of plates that have permanent features on them. Monoprints can be thought of as variations on a theme, with the theme resulting from some permanent features being found on the plate‚Äîlines, textures‚Äîthat persist from print to print. Variations are confined to those resulting from how the plate is inked prior to each print. The variations are endless, but certain permanent features on the plate will tend to persist from one print to the next.

In principle, the method is practically identical to engraving. The difference is in the use of tools, and that the raised ridge along the furrow is not scraped or filed away as in engraving.Glossary of Printmaking Terms Traditionally the plate was copper, but now acetate, zinc, or plexiglas are also commonly used. Like etching, drypoint is easier to master than engraving for an artist trained in drawing because the technique of using the needle is closer to using a pencil than the engraver's burin. The term is also used for inkless scratched inscriptions, such as glosses in manuscripts. Lines and burrs Mary Cassatt, Woman Bathing, drypoint combined with aquatint, 1890‚Äì1. The lines produced by printing a drypoint are formed by the burr thrown up at the edge of the incised lines, in addition to the depressions formed in the surface of the plate. A larger burr, formed by a steep angle of the tool, will hold a lot of ink, producing a characteristically soft, dense line that differentiates drypoint from other intaglio methods such as etching or engraving which produce a smooth, hard- edged line. The size or characteristics of the burr usually depend not on how much pressure is applied, but on the angle of the needle. A perpendicular angle will leave little to no burr, while the smaller the angle gets to either side, the larger the burr pileup. The deepest drypoint lines leave enough burr on either side of them that they prevent the paper from pushing down into the center of the stroke, creating a feathery black line with a fine, white center. A lighter line may have no burr at all, creating a very fine line in the final print by holding very little ink. This technique is different from engraving, in which the incisions are made by removing metal to form depressions in the plate surface which hold ink, although the two methods can easily be combined, as Rembrandt often did. Because the pressure of printing quickly destroys the burr, drypoint is useful only for comparatively small editions; as few as ten or twenty impressions with burr can be made, and after the burr has gone, the comparatively shallow lines will wear out relatively quickly. Most impressions of Rembrandt prints on which drypoint was used show no burr, and often the drypoint lines are very weak, leaving the etched portions still strong. To counter this and allow for longer print runs, electroplating (called steelfacing by printmakers) can harden the surface of a plate and allow the same edition size as produced by etchings and engravings. History Stanis≈Çaw Mas≈Çowski, ca 1905, Portrait of Artist's Wife, drypoint, 11.5x7.7 cm, National Museum in Warsaw The technique appears to have been invented by the Housebook Master, a south German 15th-century artist, all of whose prints are in drypoint only. Among the most famous artists of the old master print Albrecht D√ºrer produced 3 drypoints before abandoning the technique; Rembrandt used it frequently, but usually in conjunction with etching and engraving. As intaglio techniques, they can all be used on the same plate. Alex Katz used this process to create several of his famous works, such as \\"Sunny\\" and \\"The Swimmer\\". In the 20th century many artists produced drypoints, including Max Beckmann, Milton Avery, and Hermann-Paul. By adding aquatint work on the plate and inking with various colours, artists such as Mary Cassatt have produced colour drypoints. Canadian artist David Brown Milne is credited as the first to produce coloured drypoints by the use of multiple plates, one for each colour.David Milne, The Canadian Encyclopedia On the West Coast of the United States the respected printmaker Pedro Joseph de Lemos simplified the methods for producing drypoints in art schools. Contemporary artists who have extensively used drypoint include Louise Bourgeois, Vija Celmins, William Kentridge and Richard Spare. Types of needles Any sharp object can theoretically be used to make a drypoint, as long as it can be used to carve lines into metal. Dentistry tools, nails, and metal files can all be used to produce drypoints. However, certain types of needles are created specifically for drypoints: *Diamond-tipped needles carve easily through any metal and never need sharpening, but they are expensive. *Carbide-tipped steel needles can also be used to great effect, and are cheaper than diamond-tipped needles, but they need frequent sharpening to maintain a sharp point. Steel needles were traditionally used. Printing processes Pablo Picasso, 1909, Two Nude Figures (Deux figures nues), steel-faced drypoint on Arches laid paper, 13 x 11 cm, printed by Del√¢tre, Paris, published by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler Printing is essentially the same as for the other intaglio techniques, but extra care is taken to preserve the burr. After the image is finished, or at least ready to proof, the artist applies ink to the plate with a dauber. Too much pressure will flatten the burrs and ruin the image. Once the plate is completely covered with a thin layer, a tarlatan cloth is used to wipe away excess ink, and paper (typically pages from old phone books) may be used for a final wipe of the lightest areas of the image. Some printmakers will use their bare hand instead to wipe these areas. Once the desired amount of ink is removed, the plate is run through an etching press along with a piece of dampened paper to produce a print. =Hand-wiping techniques= Drypoint wiping techniques vary slightly from other intaglio techniques. Less pressure is applied to achieve desirable lines, because the burrs forming the image are more fragile than etched or engraved lines, but also because the ink rests on the plate surface, instead of pressed down into indentations. Also, because of the characteristics of the way the burrs catch ink, the direction of the wiping matters. Ink tends to pile up in the lee of the burr during the application of the ink and wiping with the tarlatan, so if the printer wipes in the direction of the lines with his hand, he may remove most of the ink, leaving a light gray line. However, if he wipes perpendicularly to the line, he can actually increase the pile of ink on the other side of the line, darkening the printed line.

Samuel Bush was a railroad middle manager, then a steel company president and, during World War I, also a federal government official in charge of coordination of and assistance to major weapons contractors. Bush attended St. George's School in Middletown, Rhode Island, from 1908‚Äì1913. In 1913, he enrolled at Yale College, where his paternal grandfather, Rev. James Smith Bush (class of 1844), and his maternal uncle Robert E. Sheldon Jr. (class of 1904) had matriculated. Three subsequent generations of the Bush family have been Yale alumni. Prescott Bush was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity and Skull and Bones secret society. George H. W. Bush was also a member of the society, as is his son, George W. Bush. According to Skull and Bones lore, Prescott Bush was among a group of Bonesmen who dug up and removed the skull of Geronimo from his grave at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, in 1918. According to historian David L. Miller, the Bonesmen probably dug up somebody at Fort Sill, but not Geronimo. Prescott Bush was a cheerleader,Cheerleading of the '20s: Epitome of masculinity .

After graduation, Bush served as a field artillery captain with the American Expeditionary Forces (1917‚Äì1919) during World War I. He received intelligence training at Verdun, France, and was briefly assigned to a staff of French officers. Alternating between intelligence and artillery, he came under fire in the Meuse-Argonne offensive. Business career After his discharge in 1919, Prescott Bush went to work for the Simmons Hardware Company in St. Louis, Missouri. The Bush family moved to Columbus, Ohio, in 1923, where Prescott briefly worked for the Hupp Products Company. In November 1923, he became president of sales for Stedman Products in South Braintree, Massachusetts. During this time, he lived in a Victorian house at 173 Adams Street in Milton, Massachusetts, where his son, George H. W. Bush, was born. In 1924, Bush became vice-president of the investment bank A. Harriman & Co. where his father-in-law, George Herbert Walker was president. Bush's Yale classmates and fellow Bonesmen E. Roland Harriman and Knight Woolley also worked with the company. In 1925, he joined the United States Rubber Company of New York City as manager of the foreign division, and moved to Greenwich, Connecticut. In 1931, he became a partner of Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., which was created through the 1931 amalgamation of A. Harriman & Co with Brown Bros. & Co., (a merchant bank founded in Philadelphia in 1818) and with Harriman Brothers & Co. (established in New York City in 1927). He was an avid golfer, and in 1935 was named head of the USGA. From 1944‚Äì1956, Prescott Bush was a member of the Yale Corporation, the principal governing body of Yale University. He was on the board of directors of CBS, having been introduced to chairman William S. Paley around 1932 by his close friend and colleague W. Averell Harriman, who became a major Democratic Party power broker. =Union Banking Corporation = Bush was a founding and one of seven directors (including W. Averell Harriman) of the Union Banking Corporation (holding a single share out of 4,000 as a director), an investment bank that operated as a clearing house for many assets and enterprises held by German steel magnate Fritz Thyssen. In July 1942, the bank was suspected of holding gold on behalf of Nazi leaders. A subsequent government investigation disproved those allegations but confirmed the Thyssens' control, and in October 1942 the United States seized the bank under the Trading with the Enemy Act and held the assets for the duration of World War II. Journalist Duncan Campbell pointed out documents showing that Prescott Bush was a director and shareholder of a number of companies involved with Thyssen. Historian Herbert Parmet agrees with the assessment that Bush was not a Nazi sympathizer. Political life Prescott Bush was politically active on social issues. He was involved with the American Birth Control League as early as 1942, and served as the treasurer of the first nationwide campaign of Planned Parenthood in 1947. He was also an early supporter of the United Negro College Fund, serving as chairman of the Connecticut branch in 1951. From 1947‚Äì1950, he served as Connecticut Republican finance chairman, and was the Republican candidate for the United States Senate in 1950. A columnist in Boston said that Bush \\"is coming on to be known as President Truman's Harry Hopkins. Nobody knows Mr. Bush and he hasn't a Chinaman's chance.\\"\\"Fair Enough\\" by Westbrook Pegler, Burlington Daily News-Times (North Carolina), August 22, 1950 (Harry Hopkins had been one of Franklin D. Roosevelt's closest advisors.) Bush's ties with Planned Parenthood also hurt him in strongly-Catholic Connecticut, and were the basis of a last-minute campaign in churches by Bush's opponents; the family vigorously denied the connection, but Bush lost to Sen. William Burnett Benton by only 1,000 votes. Prescott Bush sought a rematch with Sen. Benton in 1952, but withdrew as the party turned to William Purtell. The death of Senator Brien McMahon later that year, however, created a vacancy and this time the Republicans He defeated the Democratic nominee, Abraham Ribicoff, and was elected to the Senate. A staunch supporter of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, he served until January 1963. He was re- elected in 1956 with 55% of the vote over Democrat Thomas J. Dodd (later U.S. Senator from Connecticut and father of Christopher J. Dodd), and decided not to run for another term in 1962. He was a key ally for the passage of Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System, and during his tenure supported the Polaris submarine project (built by Electric Boat Corporation in Groton, Connecticut), civil rights legislation, and the establishment of the Peace Corps. On December 2, 1954, Prescott Bush was part of the large (67‚Äì22) majority to censure Wisconsin Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy after McCarthy had taken on the U.S. Army and the Eisenhower administration. During the debate leading to the censure, Bush said that McCarthy has \\"caused dangerous divisions among the American people because of his attitude and the attitude he has encouraged among his followers: that there can be no honest differences of opinion with him. Either you must follow Senator McCarthy blindly, not daring to express any doubts or disagreements about any of his actions, or, in his eyes, you must be a Communist, a Communist sympathizer, or a fool who has been duped by the Communist line.\\" Eisenhower later included Prescott Bush on an undated handwritten list of prospective candidates he favored for the 1960 Republican presidential nomination. In terms of issues, Bush often agreed with New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. According to Theodore H. White's book about the 1964 presidential election, Bush and Rockefeller were longtime friends. Bush favored a Nixon-Rockefeller ticket for 1960, and was presumed to support Rockefeller's 1964 presidential candidacy until the latter's remarriage in 1963. He then publicly denounced Rockefeller for divorcing his first wife and marrying a woman with whom Rockefeller had been having an affair while married to his first wife. Bush then very publicly endorsed his former Senate colleague Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., who was also the older brother of one of Bush's proteges', former Connecticut Governor John Davis Lodge. Bush voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Another of Senator Bush's major legislative interests was flood and hurricane protection. He drafted Public Law 71, the Bush Hurricane Survey Act, enabling U.S. Army engineers to develop a new program of community protection against tidal flooding. Personal life The grave of Prescott Bush The headstone of Prescott Bush Prescott Bush married Dorothy Wear Walker (1901‚Äì1992) on August 6, 1921, in Kennebunkport, Maine. They had five children: George Nancy Jonathan and William \\"Bucky\\" Bush founded the Yale Glee Club Associates, an alumni group, in 1937. As was his father-in-law, he was a member of the United States Golf Association, serving successively as secretary, vice-president and president, 1928‚Äì1935. He was a multi-year club champion of the Round Hill Club in Greenwich, Connecticut, and was on the committee set up by New York City Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. to help create the New York Mets. He was a member of the American Legion and the 40 & 8 Society. Bush maintained homes in New York City Long Island and Greenwich, Connecticut; the family compound at Kennebunkport, Maine; and a secluded island off the Connecticut coast, Fishers Island. He died of cancer in 1972 at age 77 at Memorial Hospital in and was interred at Putnam Cemetery in Greenwich, Connecticut.

Note range of tones. Aquatint is an intaglio printmaking technique, a variant of etching that produces areas of tone rather than lines. For this reason it has mostly been used in conjunction with etching, to give outlines.Griffiths, 89‚Äì90 It has also been used historically to print in colour, both by printing with multiple plates in different colours, and by making monochrome prints that were then hand-coloured with watercolour. It has been in regular use since the later 18th century, and was most widely used between about 1770 and 1830, when it was used both for artistic prints and decorative ones. After about 1830 it lost ground to lithography and other techniques.Mayor, 612‚Äì614 There have been periodic revivals among artists since then.Gascoigne, 17d; Griffiths, 94‚Äì96 An aquatint plate wears out relatively quickly, and is less easily reworked than other intaglio plates. Many of Goya's plates were reprinted too often posthumously, giving very poor impressions.Griffiths, 150‚Äì151 Among the most famous prints using the aquatint technique are the major series by Goya, many of The Birds of America by John James Audubon (with the colour added by hand), and prints by Mary Cassatt printed in colour using several plates. Technique Goya, No. 32 of Los Caprichos (1799, Por que fue sensible). This is a fairly rare example of a print entirely in aquatint.Griffiths, 150 In intaglio printmaking techniques such as engraving and etching, the artist makes marks into the surface of the plate (in the case of aquatint, a copper or zinc plate) that are capable of holding ink. The plate is inked all over then wiped clean to leave ink only in the marks. The plate is passed through a printing press together with a sheet of paper, and strong pressure applied pushing the paper into the marks, so that a transfer of the ink to the paper occurs. This is repeated many times. Like etching, aquatint uses the application of a mordant (acid) to etch into the metal plate. Where etching uses a needle to scratch through an acid-proof resist and make lines, aquatint uses powdered rosin (resin) to create a tonal effect. The rosin is acid resistant and typically adhered to the plate by controlled heating; where the grains are will print white, with black areas around. The tonal variation is controlled by the level of mordant exposure over large areas, and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time. The rosin is then washed off the plate before printing.Griffiths, 89‚Äì90 Another tonal technique, mezzotint, begins with a plate surface that is evenly indented and roughened so that it will print as an even and fairly dark tone of ink. The mezzotint plate is then smoothed and polished to make areas carry less ink and thus print a lighter shade. Alternatively, beginning with a smooth plate, areas are roughened to make them darker. Occasionally the two techniques of aquatint and mezzotint are combined.  History  Philibert-Louis Debucourt, The Public Promenade, 1792. Printed in colour from various plates, using etching, engraving, and aquatint. One of the leading achievements of the French 18th-century colour- print. =To 1830= A variety of early experiments aimed to add tonal effects to etching included the first use of a resin dust ground by the painter and printmaker Jan van de Velde IV in Amsterdam, around 1650. However none of these developed a technique that caught on with other printmakers.Griffiths, 92; Hind, AM (1963) A History of Engraving and Etching. Dover Publications, New York. Experimentation by several artists with somewhat different techniques reached a peak after about 1750, and as they were initially very secretive, the history of the emergence of the standard technique remains unclear.Griffiths, 93‚Äì94 Various claimants include the Swede Per Floding working with the Frenchman Fran√ßois-Philippe Charpentier in 1761, J. B. Delafosse in 1766, working with the amateur Jean-Claude Richard (often rather misleadingly known as the Abb√© de Saint-Non) in 1766, and Jean-Baptiste Le Prince in 1768‚Äì69. Le Prince was more effective than the others in publicizing his technique, publishing D√©couverte du proc√©d√© de graver au lavis in 1780, though he failed to sell his secret in his lifetime. It was bought posthumously by the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture in 1782, who released it on an open basis.Griffiths, 94; Ives (MMA) left Though England was to become one of the countries using the technique most, the earliest English aquatints were not exhibited until 1772, by the cartographer Peter Perez Burdett. It was taken up by the watercolourist Paul Sandby, who also seems to have introduced technical refinements as well as inventing the name \\"aquatint\\".Griffiths, 94; Ives; Ann V. Gunn, \\"Sandby, Greville and Burdett, and the 'Secret' of Aquatint,\\" Print Quarterly, XXIX, no. 2, 2012, pp. 178‚Äì180. In England artists such as Sandby and Thomas Gainsborough were attracted by the suitability of etched outlines with aquatint for reproducing the popular English landscape watercolours, which at this period usually also had been given an initial outline drawing in ink. Publishers of prints and illustrations for expensive books, both important British markets at the time, also adopted the technique. In all these areas, a print with etching and aquatint gave very satisfactory results when watercolour was added by relatively low-skilled painters copying a model, with a flat wash of colour on top of the varied tones of the aquatint.Griffiths, 94 After the French Revolution, one of the most successful publishers in London, the German Rudolf Ackermann, had numbers of French refugees working on the floor above his shop in The Strand in London, each brushing a single colour and then passing the sheet down a long table.Mayor, 374‚Äì376 Over the same period in France there was sustained interest in techniques for true colour printing using multiple plates, which used multiple printmaking techniques which often included aquatint (or mezzotint) for tone. Artists included Jean-Fran√ßois Janinet and Philibert-Louis Debucourt, whose La Promenade Publique is often thought the masterpiece of the style.Griffiths, 119 Another branch of this French movement mostly used mezzotint for tone and came to specialize in illustrating medical textbooks. This was at first led by Jacob Christoph Le Blon (1667‚Äì1741), who very nearly anticipated modern CMYK colour separation and then carried on by his pupil Jacques Fabien Gautier d'Agoty and later members of the d'Agoty family until around 1800.Griffiths, 118‚Äì119 Goya, maker of incontestably the greatest prints using aquatint, probably learned of the technique though Giovanni David from Genoa, the first significant Italian to use it. Goya used it, normally with etching and often burnishing and other techniques, in his great print series Los Caprichos (1799), Los Desastres de la Guerra (1810‚Äì19), La Tauromaquia (1816) and Los disparates (ca. 1816‚Äì23).Ives (MMA); Griffiths, 94 =Revival= Mary Cassatt, Woman Bathing, drypoint and aquatint, from three plates, 1890‚Äì91 After a period of several decades in the central 19th century when the technique was little used, and definitively superseded for commercial uses,Mayor, 612‚Äì614 it was revived near the end of the century in France, by √âdouard Manet, F√©licien Rops, Degas, Pissarro, Jacques Villon and other artists.Griffiths, 94 In 1891, Mary Cassatt, based in Paris, exhibited a series of highly original coloured drypoint and aquatint prints, including Woman Bathing and The Coiffure, inspired by an exhibition of Japanese woodblock prints shown there the year before. These used multiple blocks for the different colours. Cassatt was attracted to the simplicity and clarity of Japanese design, and the skillful use of blocks of colour. In her interpretation, she used primarily light, delicate pastel colours and avoided black (a \\"forbidden\\" colour among the Impressionists). It continued to be used in the 20th century, with the Czech T. F. ≈†imon and the German Johnny Friedlaender notably frequent users. In the United States the printmaker Pedro Joseph de Lemos popularized aquatints in art schools with his publications (1919‚Äì40), which simplified the cumbersome techniques, and with traveling exhibitions of his award-winning prints.  Modern process  Demonstration sections of printed aquatint, magnified. aquatint box, used to apply resin powder on the plate. An aquatint requires a metal plate, an acid, and something to resist the acid. Traditionally copper or zinc plates were used. The artist applies a ground that will resist acid. Ground is applied by either dissolving powdered resin in spirits, applying the powder directly to the surface of the plate, or by using a liquid acrylic resist. In all forms of etching the acid resist is commonly referred to as \\"the ground.\\" An aquatint box is used to apply resin powder. The powder is at the bottom of the box, a crank or a bellows is used to blow the powder up into the air of the box. A window allows the engraver to see the density of flowing powder and to place his plate in the box using a drawer. When the powder covers the plate, it can be extracted from the box for the next operations. The plate is then heated; if the plate is covered with powder, the resin melts forming a fine and even coat; if it is in spirits, the spirits evaporate and the result is essentially the same. Now the plate is dipped in acid, producing an even and fine level of corrosion (the \\"bite\\") sufficient to hold ink. At this point, the plate is said to carry about a 50% halftone. This means that, were the plate printed with no further biting, the paper would display a gray color more or less directly in between white (no ink) and black (full ink). Zinc plate with powder resin. At some point the artist will then etch an outline of any aspects of the drawing they wish to establish with line; this provides the basis and guide for the later tone work. They may also have applied (at the very start, before any biting occurs) an acid-resistant \\"stop out\\" (also called an asphaltum or hard ground) if they intend to keep any areas totally white and free of ink, such as highlights. The artist then begins immersing the plate in the acid bath, progressively stopping out (protecting from acid) any areas that have achieved the designed tonality. These tones, combined with the limited line elements, give aquatints a distinctive, watery look. Also, aquatints, like mezzotints, provide ease in creating large areas of tone without laborious cross-hatching; but aquatint plates, it is noted, are generally more durable than mezzotint plates. The first etch should be for a short period (30 seconds to 1 minute, with a wide variation depending on how light the lightest tones are meant to be). A test piece may be made with etching times noted, as the strength of the etchant will vary. More than thirty minutes should produce a very dark area. Etching for many hours (up to 24) will be as dark as etching for one hour, but the deep etch would produce raised ink on the paper. Contemporary printmakers often use spraypaint instead of a powder, particularly when using the technique known as sugar-lift. To produce a printing surface using sugar-lift, the artist makes a solution of India ink and sugar by melting sugar into heated ink. This mixture is then applied to a prepared plate with a brush, allowing for a bold expression not possible with the most etching techniques. When the ink/sugar mixture is dry the plate is coated with asphaltum (liquid ground); the plate is then submerged in warm water which dissolves the sugar so that the image \\"lifts off\\" the plate. The exposed areas are then aquatinted to hold ink and the plate is ready to be printed from.

According to Ancient Greek historian Strabo, the Dardanians were Illyrians and he included them as part of the Illyrian world in his geography.

After Roman conquest of Illyria in 168 BC, Romans colonized and founded several cities in the region, such as Ulpiana, Theranda and Vicianum,Hauptst√§dte in S√ºdosteuropa: Geschichte, Funktion, nationale Symbolkraft by Harald Heppner, page 134 later incorporating it into the Roman province of Illyricum in 59 BC. Subsequently, it became part of Moesia Superior in AD 87. The region was exposed to an increasing number of 'barbarian' raids from the 4th century AD onwards, culminating with the Slavic migrations of the 6th and 7th centuries. Archaeologically, the early Middle Ages represent a hiatus in the material record., and whatever was left of the native provincial population fused into the Slavs. According to other sources, the plague of Justinian had killed millions of native Balkan people and as a result many regions had become depopulated and neglected by the government, this gave the Slavs a chance into raiding and settling in the Balkans. The plague pandemic and Slavic expansion in the 6th-8th centuries According to De Administrando Imperio, the original homeland of the Serbs was somewhere in Central-Eastern Europe in the White Serbia and from there they migrated down to the Balkans around the 7th century. Early and High Middle Ages The region had been part of the Roman and the Byzantium until the first major Slav raids took place in the middle of Justinian's reign. In 547 and 548 the Slavs invaded the territory of modern Kosovo, and then got as far as Durres on the Northern Albanian coast and reached all the way down to Greece. Although the Balkans had been raided by Slavic tribes, the early Slavic settlement and power in Kosovo was not big, until the region was later absorbed into the Bulgarian Empire in the 850s, where Christianity and a Byzantine-Slavic culture was cemented in the region. After the collapse of the Bulgarian Empire , the Region became later again part of the Byzantine Empire after the empire fully re-established itself and would stay under Byzantine rule for nearly two centuries after that until later Serbian Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja, who had expanded his empire south and into Kosovo conquered it by the end of the 12th century. Fine 1994, p. 7 According to Serbian scholars, although Albanians lived between Lake Skadar and the Devoll river in the 1100s, Albanian migration into the plains of Metohija () commenced at the end of the century. Some of the arriving Albanians were assimilated by Serbs and Montenegrins. According to other scholars, if Albanians had only lived within Albania up until the 1100's, this would fail to explain the Vlach-Albanian symbiosis and the inland Latin variety of the Albanian language which occurred more East of Albania in the Kosovo region. The Albanian-Vlach symbiosis developed in the Kosovo area, especially but not only in it's Western part (including part of the Montenegro area). What it suggests is that the Kosovo region, together with at least part of Northern Albania, was the crucial focus of two distinct but interlinked ethnic histories: the survival of the Albanians, and the emergence of the Romanians and Vlachs. Several Albanian personal names and placenames appear in various parts of Kosovo and North Macedonia in the 13th century, the first identifiably Albanian place name appearing in Kosovo, attested in a 1253 statement by Serbian knez Miroslav. By 1330, the frequency of identifiably Albanian names in a 1330 chrysobull describing estates in Decan is \\"many\\", although attempts to ascertain reliable percentages of the Albanian population relative to Serbs at this period or later are described by Madgearu as \\"difficult\\". The presence of Vlach villages in the vicinity of Prizren is attested in 1198‚Äì1199 by a charter of Stephan Nemanja.Madgearu. The Wars of the Balkan Peninsula. Page 33. According to Ducellier and Noel Malcolm, part of the Albanian population in Kosovo is from an old Albanian population within the Kosovo region itself that had expanded. This especially given that there is no evidence of any large Albanian migrations, especially in the early Ottoman period, and by the 17th century Albanians constituted a significant part of the population.Have the Albanians invaded Kosova? - Alain Ducellier page 33-34 The population of North and Central Albania was also smaller than the population of Kosovo and it's rate of growth larger. Most of the newly arrived settlers into Kosovo that were recorded in the early Ottoman period had Slavic names rather than Albanian. According to Noel Malcolm, except for migrations from Northern Albania, large parts of the Albanian demographic growth in Kosovo was the expansion of a native Albanian population within the Kosovo region itself. Bosnian historian Hanzic and Croatian scholar Milan Sufflay also concluded the same thing, that part of the Albanian population in Kosovo, such as the Western part of Kosovo, was from an old native population. A.Hanzic - Nekoliko vijesti o Arbanasima na Kosovu I Metohiji v sredinom XV vijeka pp.201-9 Milan Sufflay: Povijest Sjevernih Arbanasa pp. 61-2 9th-13 century =Bulgarian Rule= Between ca. 830 and ca, 1015 the region was Bulgarian. According to Richard J. Crampton, the development of Old Church Slavonic literacy during the 10th century had the effect of preventing the assimilation of the South Slavs into the Byzantine culture, which promoted the formation of a distinct Bulgarian identity in that area. Afterwards it was ceded to the Byzantine empire as a province called Byzantine Bulgaria. =Byzantine Rule= In 1072 an unsuccessful rebellion led by local Bulgarian landlord Georgi Voiteh arose in the area and in 1072 in Prizren he was crowned \\"Tsar of Bulgaria\\". At the end of the 11th century the Byzantine domains in the Balkans became an arena of fierce hostilities. At the end of the 12th century, formally Byzantium was still the sovereign. The disintegration of Byzantium was complete when in 1204 the Fourth Crusade captured Constantinople. 14th century =Serbian rule= The Deƒçani chrysobulls (1321‚Äì31) of Serbian king Stefan Deƒçanski contains a detailed list of landholdings and tax farming rights which the monastery of Visoki Deƒçani held over an area which spanned from southern Serbia (modern Sandzak), Kosovo, Montenegro and parts of northern Albania. The chrysobulls were signed by King Stefan Uro≈° III Deƒçanski of Serbia who confirmed existing rights and gave new ones to the monastery. The chrysobulls listed that Visoki Deƒçani held tax farming rights over 2,097 households of meropsi (dependent farmers-serfs), 266 Vlach households (pastoral communities) and 69 sokalniki (craftsmen). In the 14th century in two chrysobulls or decrees by Serbian rulers, in the villages of modern-day Kosovo area, find Serbs living alongside Albanians and Vlachs, who are cited in the first as being between the White Drin and Lim rivers (1330). In the second Serbian golden bull (1348) a total of nine Albanian villages are cited within the vicinity of Prizren. \\"The monastery at Deƒçani stands on a terrace commanding passes into High Albania. When Stefan Uros III founded it in 1330, he gave it many villages in the plain and catuns of Vlachs and Albanians between the Lim and the Beli Drim. Vlachs and Albanians had to carry salt for the monastery and provide it with serf labour.\\" During this period one can also witness a Serbianisation or Slavicization of the Albanian population in Kosovo, with some Albanians carrying Serbian names and converting to Orthodoxy. 15th century =1455= The Ottoman cadastral tax census (defter) of 1455 in the Brankoviƒá lands (covering most of present-day Kosovo) recorded: * 480 villages, * 13,693 adult males, * 12,985 dwellings, * 14,087 household heads (480 widows and 13,607 adult males). Yugoslav and Serbian scholars have researched the defter, concluding that:In 1972 the Sarajevo Institute of Middle Eastern Studies translated the original Turkish census and published an analysis of it Kovaƒçeviƒá Mr. E≈°ref, Hand≈æiƒá A., Had≈æibegoviƒá H.

Subsequently others have covered the subject as well such as Vukanoviƒá Tatomir, Srbi na Kosovu, Vranje, 1986. * 13,000 dwellings present in all 480 villages and towns * 75 dwellings in 34 villages * 46 dwellings in 23 villages * 17 dwellings in 10 villages * 5 in Lau≈°a, Vuƒçitrn * 1 dwelling in Vuƒçitrn Ottomans never conducted population censuses and tax defter on nationalities. Only according to religious beliefs. Therefore a valid source is required for verification. However, this interpretation of nationals living there is vague and unreliable to actually determine the Serb, Albanian, Bulgarian, Greek, Jews and Croats who lived in Kosovo in 1455 for the reason that the ottomans never conducted populations censuses based on nationality or language. The ottomans cadastral tax records only mention the religion of the dwellers in Kosovo not nationalities. Out of all names mentioned in this census, conducted by the Ottomans in 1455, covering areas of most of present-day Kosovo, 95.88% of all names were of Slavic origin, 1.90% of Roman origin, 1.56% of uncertain origin, 0.26% of Albanian origin, 0.25% of Greek origin, etc. However, while Serbian scholars may have come to the conclusion that the defter indicates an overwhelmingly Serbian local population, other scholars have other views. Madgearu instead argues that the series of defters from 1455 onward \\"shows that Kosovo... was a mosaic of Serbian and Albanian villages\\", while Prishtina and Prizren already had significant Albanian Muslim populations, and that the same defter of 1455 indicates the presence of Albanians in Tetovo (just across the border in North Macedonia). =1487= The defter of 1487 in the Brankoviƒá lands recorded: *Vuƒçitrn district: ** 16,729 Christian households (412 in Pristina and Vuƒçitrn) ** 117 Muslim households (94 in Pristina and 83 in rural areas) *Peƒá District: **Peƒá (town) ** 121 Christian households ** 33 Muslim households * Suho Grlo and Metohija: ** 131 Christian households * Donja Klina ‚Äì nationalities not clear according to ottoman records based on religion *De√ßan ‚Äì nationalities not clear according to ottoman records based on religion * Rural areas: ** 6,124 Christian households (99%) ** 55 Muslim households (1%) The above claims are considered bold since the ottomans never conducted population censuses based on nationality.. only religion and a source is required to validate those claims. Scholarship on Kosovo has encompassed Ottoman provincial surveys that have revealed the 15th century ethnic composition of some Kosovo settlements. However, both Serbian and Albanian historians using these records have made much of them while proving little. \\"While the ethnic roots of some settlements can be determined from the Ottoman records, Serbian and Albanian historians have at times read too much into them in their running dispute over the ethnic history of early Ottoman Kosovo. Their attempts to use early Ottoman provincial surveys (tahrir defterleri) to gauge the ethnic make-up of the population in the fifteenth century have proved little.\\" 16th century =1520‚Äì1535= *Vuƒçitrn: 19,614 households **Christians **700 Muslim households (3.5%) *Prizren **Christians **359 Muslim households (2%) =1582‚Äì83= The 1582‚Äì83 defter of the Sanjak of Scutari recorded the Peƒá nahiya as having 235 villages of which some 30 have families.

The International History Review. 28.(4): 767‚Äì774, 785‚Äì788. \\"While the ethnic roots of some settlements can be determined from the Ottoman records, Serbian and Albanian historians have at times read too much into them in their running dispute over the ethnic history of early Ottoman Kosovo. Their attempts to use early Ottoman provincial surveys (tahrir defterleri) to gauge the ethnic make‚Äîup of the population in the fifteenth century have proved little. Leaving aside questions arising from the dialects and pronunciation of the census scribes, interpreters, and even priests who baptized those recorded, no natural law binds ethnicity to name. Imitation, in which the customs, tastes, and even names of those in the public eye are copied by the less exalted, is a time‚Äîtested tradition and one followed in the Ottoman Empire. Some Christian sipahis in early Ottoman Albania took such Turkic names as Timurta≈ü, for example, in a kind of cultural conformity completed later by conversion to Islam. Such cultural mimicry makes onomastics an inappropriate tool for anyone wishing to use Ottoman records to prove claims so modern as to have been irrelevant to the pre‚Äîmodern state. The seventeenth‚Äîcentury Ottoman notable arid author Evliya √áelebi, who wrote a massive account of his travels around the empire and abroad, included in it details of local society that normally would not appear in official correspondence; for this reason his account of a visit to several towns in Kosovo in 1660 is extremely valuable. Evliya confirms that western and at least parts of central Kosovo were 'Arnavud'. He notes that the town of Vuƒçitrn had few speakers of 'Bo≈ünakca'; its inhabitants spoke Albanian or Turkish. He terms the highlands around Tetovo (in Macedonia), Peƒá, and Prizren the 'mountains of Arnavudluk'. Elsewhere, he states that 'the mountains of Peƒá' lay in Arnavudluk, from which issued one of the rivers converging at Mitrovica, just north-west of which he sites Kosovo‚Äôs border with Bosna. This river, the Ibar, flows from a source in the mountains of Montenegro north‚Äînorth‚Äîwest of Peƒá, in the region of Rozaje to which the K√´lmendi would later be moved. He names the other river running by Mitrovica as the Kƒ±lab and says that it, too, had its source in Aravudluk; by this he apparently meant the Lab, which today is the name of the river descending from mountains north‚Äîeast of Mitrovica to join the Sitnica north of Pri≈°tina. As Evliya travelled south, he appears to have named the entire stretch of river he was following the Kƒ±lab, not noting the change of name when he took the right fork at the confluence of the Lab and Sitnica. Thus, Evliya states that the tomb of Murad I, killed in the battle of Kosovo Polje, stood beside the Kƒ±lab, although it stands near the Sitnica outside Pri≈°tina. Despite the confusion of names, Evliya included in Arnavudluk not only the western fringe of Kosovo, but also the central mountains from which the Sitnica ('Kƒ±lab') and its first tributaries descend. Given that a large Albanian population lived in Kosovo, especially in the west and centre, both before and after the Habsburg invasion of 1689‚Äì90, it remains possible, in theory, that at that time in the Ottoman Empire, one people emigrated en masse and another immigrated to take its place. Due to the Ottoman-Habsburg wars and their aftermath, some Albanians from contemporary northern Albania and Western Kosovo settled within the wider Kosovo area in the second half of the 18th century, at times instigated by Ottoman authorities.Geni≈ü, ≈ûerife, and Kelly Lynne Maynard (2009). \\"Formation of a diasporic community: The history of migration and resettlement of Muslim Albanians in the Black Sea Region of Turkey.\\" Middle Eastern Studies. 45. (4): 556‚Äì557: Using secondary sources, we establish that there have been Albanians living in the area of Nish for at least 500 years, that the Ottoman Empire controlled the area from the fourteenth to nineteenth centuries which led to many Albanians converting to Islam, that the Muslim Albanians of Nish were forced to leave in 1878, and that at that time most of these Nishan Albanians migrated south into Kosovo, although some went to Skopje in Macedonia. ; pp. 557‚Äì558. In 1690 much of the population of the city and surrounding area was killed or fled, and there was an emigration of Albanians from the Mal√´sia e Madhe (North Central Albania/Eastern Montenegro) and Dukagjin Plateau (Western Kosovo) into Nish. Successive persecutions of Serbs by the Ottomans in the southern Balkans resulted in migrations to areas under the control of the Habsburg Monarchy, in particular during the Great Turkish War of 1683‚Äì1699. During that war between the Ottomans and the Habsburgs, it led to the flight of a substantial numbers of Serbs and Albanians who had sided with the Austrians, from within and outside Kosovo, to Austrian held Vojvodina and the Military Frontier ‚Äì Patriarch Arsenije III, one of the refugees, referred to 30,000 or 40,000 souls, but a much later monastic source referred to 37,000 families. Serbian historians have used this second source to talk of a Great Migration of Serbs. Wars in 1717‚Äì1738 led to a second exodus of refugees (both Serbian and Albanian) from inside and outside Kosovo, together with reprisals and the enslavement and deportation of a number of Serbs and Albanians by the victorious Ottomans. During the Great Austro-Turkish War, Albanian Catholic leaders Pjet√´r Bogdani and Toma Raspasani rallied Kosovo Albanian Catholics and Muslims to the pro-Austrian cause. After the war, when Kosovo did not end up part of the Habsburg empire, harsh reprisals followed. Large numbers of Catholics and Serbs fled north where many \\"died, some of hunger, others of disease\\" around Budapest. After the flight of Serbs, the ƒ∞pek Detachment forced Catholic Albanians in the north to move to the now depopulated plains of southern Serbia, and forced them to convert to Islam there.Pahumi, Nevila (2007). \\"The Consolidation of Albanian Nationalism\\". Page 18: \\"The pasha of Ipek forcibly removed Catholic inhabitants of northern Albania into the plains of southern Serbia after a failed Serb revolt in 1689 and the flight of many Serbs to the Habsburg Empire. The transferred villagers were forced to convert over to Islam.\\" According to Noel Malcolm, the Albanians that were forced and settled by the Ottomans were mainly the Catholic Kelmendi tribe from the mountains of Northern Albania that had rebelled and held raids against the Ottomans. As a result, the Ottomans forcibly settled them in the plains to control them better. Many of these families returned to Northern Albania while some stayed. Many Albanian Catholic families from the North Albanian mountains migrated after the 17th century into Kosovo and many of these families fled blood feuds or to find better land and make space for a bigger population, many of these families also converted to Islam in the Kosovo region. However, there is no evidence of any large Albanian migrations into Kosovo up until the 17th century. Many scholars have concluded therefore also that the growth of the Albanian population in Kosovo was also largely due to the expansion of an indigenous Albanian population within the Kosovo region itself. From the 18th century and on wards there was also a migration of Serbian families into the Kosovo region, many of these Serbian families came from Montenegro and neighboring Serb inhabited regions Kosovo: A Short History 19th century Ethnographic map of Balkans (detail), Atlas G√©n√©ral Vidal-Lablache, Paris, 1898. Kosovo was part of the Kosovo Vilayet, which included Kosovo, parts of northern and northwestern North Macedonia, parts of modern eastern Montenegro and much of the Sandzak region. 19th century data about the Kosovo Vilayet tend to be rather conflicting, giving sometimes numerical superiority to the Serbs and sometimes to the Albanians. The Ottoman statistics are regarded as unreliable, as the empire counted its citizens by religion rather than nationality, using birth records rather than surveys of individuals. A map published by French ethnographer G. LejeanH.R. Wilkinson, Maps and Politics; a review of the ethnographic cartography of Macedonia, Liverpool University Press, 1951 in 1861 shows that Albanians lived on around 57% of Kosovo Vilayet while a similar map, published by British travellers G. M. Mackenzie and A. P. Irby in 1867 shows slightly less; these maps don't show which population was larger overall. Nevethless, maps cannot be used to measure population as they leave out density. Ethnic distribution of Albanians, The Historical Atlas, New York, 1911 Maps published by German historian Kiepert in 1876, J. Hahn and Austrian consul K. Sax, show that Albanians live on most of the territory of what is now Kosovo, however they don't show which population is larger. According to these, the regions of Kosovska Mitrovica and Kosovo Polje were settled mostly by Serbs, whereas most of the territory of western and eastern parts of today's province was settled by Muslim Albanians.

(3): 470. Serbs from the Lab region moved to Serbia during and after the war of 1876 and incoming Albanian refugees (muhaxhir√´) repopulated their villages. Apart from the Lab region, sizeable numbers of Albanian refugees were resettled in other parts of northern Kosovo alongside the new Ottoman-Serbian border.. Most Albanian refugees were resettled in over 30 large rural settlements in central and southeastern Kosovo.. Many refugees were also spread out and resettled in urban centers that increased their populations substantially. para. 30. Western diplomats reporting in 1878 placed the number of refugee families at 60,000 families in Macedonia, with 60-70,000 refugees from Serbia spread out within the vilayet of Kosovo. The Ottoman governor of the Vilayet of Kosovo estimated in 1881 the refugees number to be around 65,000 with some resettled in the Sanjaks of √úsk√ºp and Yeni Pazar. \\"Precise figures are lacking, but one modern study concludes that the whole region contained more than 110,000 Albanians. By the end of 1878 Western officials were reporting that there were 60,000 families of Muslim refugees in Macedonia, 'in a state of extreme destitution', and 60‚Äì70,000 Albanian refugees from Serbia 'scattered' over the vilayet of Kosovo.... All these new arrivals were known as muhaxhirs (Trk.: muhacir Srb.: muhad≈æir), a general word for Muslim refugees. The total number of those who settled in Kosovo is not known with certainty: estimates ranged from 20,000 to 50,000 for Eastern Kosovo, while the governor of the vilayet gave a total of 65,000 in 1881, some of whom were in the sancaks of Skopje and Novi Pazar. At a rough estimate, 50,000 would seem a reasonable figure for those muhaxhirs of 1877‚Äì8 who settled in the territory of Kosovo itself. Apart from the Albanians, smaller numbers of Muslim Slavs came from Montenegro and Bosnia.\\" In the late Ottoman period, Kosovo vilayet contained a diverse population of Muslim Albanians and Orthodox Serbs that was split along religious and ethnic lines. Muslim Albanians formed the majority of the population in Kosovo vilayet that included an important part of the urban-professional and landowning classes of major towns. Western Kosovo was composed of 50,000 inhabitants and an area dominated by the Albanian tribal system with 600 Albanians dying per year from blood feuding. The Yakova (Gjakov√´) highlands contained 8 tribes that were mainly Muslim and in the Luma area near Prizren there were 5 tribes, mostly Muslim. The population of the tribal areas were composed of Kosovar Malisors (highlanders). The town of ƒ∞pek had crypto- Christians who were of the Catholic faith. Muslim Bosniaks whose native language was Slavic formed a sizable number of Kosovo vilayet's population and were concentrated mainly in Yenipazar sanjak. Circassian refugees who came from Russia were resettled by Ottoman authorities within Kosovo vilayet in 1864, numbering some 6,000 people by the 1890s. In the northern half of Kosovo vilayet Orthodox Serbs were the largest Christian group and formed a majority within the eastern areas. Several thousand Aromanians inhabited Kosovo vilayet. Bulgarians lived in the southern half of Kosovo vilayet. Ottoman provincial records for 1887 estimated that Albanians formed more than half of Kosovo vilayet's population concentrated in the sanjaks of ƒ∞pek, Prizren and Pri≈ütine. In the sanjaks of Yenipazar, Ta≈ülica and √úsk√ºp, Albanians formed a smaller proportion of the population. Note: Territory of Ottoman Kosovo Vilayet was quite different from modern-day Kosovo. Early 20th century Ethnic composition of Kosovo in 1911 German scholar Gustav Weigand gave the following statistical data about the population of Kosovo,Gustav Weigand, Ethnographie von Makedonien, Leipzig, 1924; –ì—É—Å—Ç–∞–≤ –í–∞–π–≥–∞–Ω–¥, –ï—Ç–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—è –Ω–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—è (Bulgarian translation) based on the pre-war situation in Kosovo in 1912: * Pristina District: 67% Albanians, 30% Serbs * Prizren District: 63% Albanians, 36% Serbs * Vuƒçitrn District: 90% Albanians, 10% Serbs * Ferizaj District: 70% Albanians, 30% Serbs * Gnjilane District: 75% Albanians, 23% Serbs * Mitrovica District: 60% Serbs, 40% Albanians Metohija with the town of Gjakova is furthermore defined as almost exclusively Albanian by Weigand. = Balkan Wars and First World War (Montenegro and Serbia) = Kosovo was part of the Ottoman Empire and following the Balkan Wars (1912‚Äì1913), the western part was included in Montenegro and the rest within Serbia. Citing Serbian sources, Noel Malcolm also states that in 1912 when Kosovo came under Serbian control, \\"the Orthodox Serb population [was] at less than 25%\\" of Kosovo's entire population. Beginning from 1912, Montenegro initiated its attempts at colonisation and enacted a law on the process during 1914 that aimed at expropriating 55,000 hectares of Albanian land and transferring it to 5,000 Montenegrin settlers. Some Serb colonisation of Kosovo took place during the Balkan Wars. Serbia undertook measures for colonisation by enacting a decree aimed at colonists within \\"newly liberated areas\\" that offered 9 hectares of land to families.  Yugoslav Interwar period  In the aftermath of the First World War Serbian control over Kosovo was restored and the Kingdom attempting to counteract Albanian separatism pursued a policy to alter the national and religious demographics of Kosovo and to Serbianise the area through colonisation. Kosovo was an area where Serbs were not a majority population and the state sought demographic change in those areas through land reform and a colonisation policy. A new decree issued in 1919 and later in 1920 restarted the colonisation process in places where Albanians lived in Kosovo and Vardar Macedonia. =1921 census= Ethnographic map of Europe in 1922, C.S. Hammond & Co. Distribution of Races in the Balkan Peninsula and Asia Minor in 1923, William R. Shepherd Atlas * The 1921 Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes population census for the territories comprising modern day Kosovo listed 439,010 inhabitants: :By religion: *Muslims: 329,502 (75.1%) *Eastern Orthodox Serbs: 93,203 (21.2%) *Roman Catholics: 15,785 (3.6%) *Jews: 427 *Greek Catholics: 26 :By native language: *Albanian: 288,907 (65.8%) *Serbian or Croatian: 114,095 (26.0%) *Turkish: 27,915 (6.4%) *Romanian-Cincarian: 402 *Slovene: 184 *German: 30 *Hungarian: 12 In the Yugoslav census of 1921, Albanians formed the majority population of Kosovo at around 64 percent with some 72 percent belonging to the Muslim faith. Government sponsored colonisation of Kosovo and Vardar Macedonia was initiated in 1920 when on 24 September the Assembly of the Yugoslav Kingdom passed the Decree on the Colonisation of the Southern Provinces of Yugoslavia.. The decrees were intended as a reward to former soldiers and chetniks for their service during the Balkan Wars and World War One with incentives offered to settle in Kosovo that allowed them to claim between 5 and 10 hectares of land. The military veterans that settled in Kosovo were known as dobrovoljac (volunteers) and were a politically reliable group for the state. The colonisation process also entailed the arrival of Serbian bureaucrats to Kosovo along with their families. During 1919‚Äì1928 some 13,000 to 15,914 Serbian families came to live in Kosovo as stipulated to the conditions of the decrees. Between 1918 and 1923, as a result of state policies 30,000 and 40,000 mainly Muslim Albanians migrated to the Turkish regions of Izmir and Anatolia. =1931 census= * According to the 1931 Kingdom of Yugoslavia population census, there were 552,064 inhabitants in today's Kosovo. :By religion: *Muslims: 379,981 (68.83%) *Orthodox Serbs: 150,745 (27.31%) * Roman Catholics: 20,568 (3.73%) *Evangelists: 114 (0.02%) * other: 656 (0.12%) Image:KiM_- _Verski_sastav_po_naseljima_1931.gifReligious structure of Kosovo by settlements 1931 (territorial organization from 1961) Serbian colonisation in Kosovo and Vardar Macedonia between 1920 and 1930.

Colonisation had managed to partially change the demographic situation in Kosovo and the share of Albanians had decreased from 65 percent (289,000) in 1921 to 61 percent (337,272) in 1931 and Serbs increased from 28 percent (114,000) to 32 percent (178,848). State authorities attempted to decrease the Albanian population through \\"forced migration\\", a process that grew during the decade. The second phase of Yugoslav colonisation began in 1931, when the Decree on the Colonisation of the Southern Regions was issued on 11 July. This phase of colonisation was considered unsuccessful because only 60 to 80 thousand people (some 17‚Äì20 thousand families) showed a willingness to become settlers and gained land, of whom many failed to follow through. Based in Ankara, the data gathered for 1919-1940 by the Yugoslav Legation shows 215,412 Albanians migrated to Turkey, whereas data collected by the Yugoslav army shows that until 1939, 4,046 Albanian families went to live in Albania. For 1918 to 1921, Sabrina Ramet cites the estimate that the expulsions of Albanians reduced their numbers from around 800,000 ‚Äì 1,000,000 within Kosovo down to some 439,500. Between 1923-1939, some 115,000 Yugoslav citizens migrated to Turkey and both Yugoslavian and Turkish sources state that Albanians composed most of that population group.. Albanian scholars from Albania and Kosovo place the number of Albanian refugees from 300,000 upward into the hundreds of thousands and state that they left Yugoslavia due to duress. Other estimates given by scholars outside the Balkans for Kosovan Albanians that emigrated during 1918‚Äì1941 are between 90,000‚Äì150,000 or 200,000‚Äì300,000. To date, access is unavailable to the Turkish Foreign Ministry archive regarding this issue and as such the total numbers of Albanians arriving to Turkey during the interwar period are difficult to determine.. World War II Kosovo in 1941 During World War II, a large area of Kosovo was attached to Italian controlled Albania. Kosovo Albanians sought to redress the past policies of colonisation and slavisation and power relations between Albanians and Serbs were overturned in the new administration. It resulted in local Serbs and other Serbs that had arrived previously as part of the colonisation plan to be targeted by groups of armed Albanians. Campaigns aimed toward Serbs followed and included the destruction of property, killings, murders and deportations. The majority of Montenegrin and Serb settlers consisting of bureaucrats and dobrovoljac fled from Kosovo to Axis occupied Serbia or Montenegro. One estimate places the number of Serbs that were forced to leave at 70,000-100,000. Serbian historiography estimates that some 100,000 Serbs left Kosovo during 1941‚Äì1945. Other Serb sources place the number at 250,000.Annexe I , by the Serbian Information Centre-London to a report of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. A three-dimensional conflict ensued, involving inter-ethnic, ideological, and international affiliations, with the first being most important. Nonetheless, these conflicts were relatively low- level compared with other areas of Yugoslavia during the war years, with one Serb historian estimating that 3,000 Albanians and 4,000 Serbs and Montenegrins were killed, and two others estimating war dead at 12,000 Albanians and 10,000 Serbs and Montenegrins. An official investigation conducted by the Yugoslav government in 1964 recorded nearly 8,000 war-related fatalities in Kosovo between 1941 and 1945, 5,489 of whom were Serb and Montenegrin and 2,177 of whom were Albanian. Communist Yugoslavia Following the Second World War and establishment of communist rule in Yugoslavia, the colonisation programme was discontinued, as President Tito wanted to avoid sectarian and ethnic conflicts. Tito enacted a temporary decree in March 1945 that banned the return of colonists, which included some Chetniks and the rest that left during the war seeking refuge. Two weeks later Tito issued another decree and followed it with a law in August 1945 that permitted a conditional return for a minority of the colonists. In total, cases of return numbered 11,168, with 4,829 cases confirmed, 5,744 cases partially confirmed alongside 595 cases being denied. A small proportion of the previous colonist population came back to Kosovo and repossessed land, with a greater part of their number (4,000 families) later leaving for other areas of Yugoslavia. After the Second World War and the Yugoslavia-Albania split, Yugoslav authorities attempted to downplay links between Albanians of Albania and Kosovo and to implement a policy of \\"Turkification\\" that encouraged Turkish language education and emigration to Turkey among Albanians. In 1953, an agreement was reached between Tito and Mehmet Fuat K√∂pr√ºl√º, the foreign minister of Turkey that promoted the emigration of Albanians to Anatolia. Forced migration to Turkey increased and numbers cited by Klejda Mulaj for 1953‚Äì1957 are 195,000 Albanians leaving Yugoslavia and for 1966, some 230,000 people. Historian Noel Malcolm placed the number of Albanians leaving for Turkey at 100,000 between 1953‚Äì1966. Factors involved in the upsurge of migration were intimidation and pressure toward the Albanian population to leave through a campaign headed by Yugoslav police chief Aleksandar Rankoviƒá that officially was stated as aimed at curbing Albanian nationalism. Kosovo under the control of Rankoviƒá was viewed by Turkey as the individual that would implement \\"the Gentleman's Agreement\\". At the same time, a new phase of colonisation occurred in the region as Montenegrin and Serb families were installed in Kosovo. The situation ended in 1966 with the removal of Rankoviƒá from his position. =Censuses= 1948 census In 1945, the decree temporarily banning the return of the colonists was published in the government periodical Slu≈æbeni list 727,820 total inhabitants * 498,242 Albanians (68.46%) * 171,911 Serbs (23.62%) * 28,050 Montenegrins (3.86%) * 11,230 Roma (1.54%) * 5,290 Croats (0.73%) * 1,315 Turks (0.18%) * 526 Macedonians (0.07%) * 362 Russians (0.05%) * 283 Slovenes (0.04%) * 197 Germans (0.03%) * 83 Hungarians (0.01%) * 77 Bulgarians (0.01%) * 39 Italians * 31 Rusyns * 29 Czechs * 18 Romanians * 2 Slovaks * 9,679 undecided Muslims (1.33%) * 456 other and unknown (0.06%) 1953 census 808,141 total inhabitants * 524,559 Albanians (64.91%) * 189,969 Serbs (23.51%) * 34,583 Turks (4.28%) * 31,343 Montenegrins (3.88%) * 6,201 Croat (0.77%) * 972 Macedonians (0.12%) * 411 Slovenes (0.05%) * 6,241 undecided Yugoslav (0.77%) * 401 other Slav (0.05%) * 13,561 others (1.68%) 1961 census 963,959 total inhabitants * 646,604 Albanians (67.08%) * 227,016 Serbs (23.55%) * 37,588 Montenegrins (3.9%) * 8,026 Ethnic Muslims (0.83%) * 7,251 Croat (0.75%) * 5,203 Yugoslavs (0.54%) * 3,202 Romani (0.33%) * 1,142 Macedonians (0.12%) * 510 Slovenes (0.05%) * 210 Hungarians (0.02%) Image:Kosovo ethnic 1961.pngEthnic structure of Kosovo and Metohija by settlements 1961.

The number of Albanians is sometimes regarded as being an underestimate. On the other hand, it is sometimes regarded as an overestimate, being derived from earlier censa which are believed to be overestimates. The Statistical Office of Kosovo states that the quality of the 1991 census is \\"questionable.\\" . In September 1993, the Bosniak parliament returned their historical name Bosniaks. Some Kosovar Muslims have started using this term to refer to themselves since.  Milo≈°eviƒá government (1990s)  By 1992, the situation in Kosovo deteriorated and politicians from both sides were at an impasse toward solutions for the future of the region. Concerns increased among Serbs and an organisation was created called the Serb Block for Colonizing Kosovo in Pristina that aimed to get state officials based in Belgrade to raise the Serb population within Kosovo. As such, the state made available loans for building apartments and homes along with employment opportunities for Montenegrins and Serbs that chose to relocate to the region. In March 1992, nearly 3,000 people from the Serb minority in Albania had emigrated to Kosovo after accepting the government offer. At the time, the government under President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá pursued colonisation amidst a situation of financial difficulties and limited resources. Laws were passed by the parliament of Serbia that sought to change the power balance in Kosovo relating to the economy, demography and politics. The parliament of Serbia on 11 January 1995 passed the Decree for Colonisation of Kosovo of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It outlined government benefits for Serbs who desired to go and live in Kosovo with loans to build homes or purchase other dwellings and offered free plots of land. \\"The Serbian parliament proceeded to pass a series of laws designed to reshape the demographic, economic and political balance of power in Kosovo. In an attempted 'Serbization' programme, tens of thousands of Kosovo Albanian doctors, municipal officials, teachers and industrial workers were sacked from their jobs, while ethnic Serbs were given economic incentives to live in Kosovo. The Serbian government replaced local Albanian police officers with special police units from the Serbian Ministry of the Interior.\\" Few Serbs took up the offer due to the worsening situation in Kosovo at the time. Around 10,000 Serb refugees from Krajina and over 2000 from Bosnia were resettled in Kosovo, due to the Yugoslav Wars. In 1995, the government attempted to alter the ethnic balance of the region through the planned resettlement of 100,000, later reduced to 20,000 Serbian refugees from Krajina in Croatia to Kosovo. Some of the Serb refugees opposed going to Kosovo. In 1996, official government statistics placed the number of refugees in Kosovo at 19,000. Most of the Serb refugees left thereafter and a few remained. In early 1997, the number of resettled Serb refugees in Kosovo was 4,000 and 6,000 in early 1999. As the sociopolitical situation deteriorated, Kosovo Albanians numbering some 300,000 fled during this period for Western Europe. After the outbreak of conflict between the Milo≈°eviƒá government and the Kosovo Liberation Army, in early 1997, an estimated 9,000 Serb refugees and 20,000 local Serbs left Kosovo. = Kosovo War (1999) = During the Kosovo war (March‚ÄìJune 1999), Serb forces expelled between 800,000 ‚Äì 1,000,000 Albanians from Kosovo employing tactics such as confiscating personal documents to make it difficult or prevent any future return. Kosovo Albanians later returned following NATO intervention and the end of the war. In 1999 more than 11,000 deaths were reported to the office of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia prosecutor Carla Del Ponte. Around 10,317 civilians in total were killed during the war, of whom 8,676 were Albanians, 1,196 Serbs and 445 Roma and others in addition to 3,218 killed members of armed formations. , some 3,000 people were still missing, of which 2,500 are Albanian, 400 Serbs and 100 Roma. In the days after the Yugoslav Army withdrew, over 80,000 (almost half of 200,000 estimated to live in Kosovo) Serb and other non-Albanians civilians were expelled from Kosovo. Estimates of the number of Serbs who left when Serbian forces departed from Kosovo vary from 65,000European Stability Initiative (ESI): The Lausanne Principle: Multiethnicity, Territory and the Future of Kosovo's Serbs (.pdf) , 7 June 2004. to 250,000.Coordinating Centre of Serbia for Kosovo-Metohija: Principles of the program for return of internally displaced persons from Kosovo and Metohija. In addition, less than one hundred of the Serb refugees from Croatia remained in Kosovo. para. 35. Contemporary  =2011 census= In the 2011 census there were 1,739,825 inhabitants.

Devotees consider him an incarnation of the god Krishna. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's mode of worshipping Krishna with ecstatic song and dance had a profound effect on Vaishnavism in Bengal. He was also the chief proponent of the Vedantic philosophy of Achintya Bheda Abheda. Mahaprabhu founded Gaudiya Vaishnavism ( Brahma-Madhva-Gaudiya Sampradaya). He expounded Bhakti yoga and popularized the chanting of the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra.Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu \\"He spread the Yuga-dharma as the practice for attainment of pure love for Radha-Krishna. That process is Harinam-Sankirtan, or the congregational chanting of the Holy Names of Krishna \\"Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare\\" He composed the Shikshashtakam (eight devotional prayers).Srimad Bhagavatam (Introduction) \\"Lord Caitanya not only preached the but propagated the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita as well in the most practical way.\\" He is sometimes called Gauranga or Gaura due to his molten gold like fair complexion.In the Name of the Lord (Deccan Herald) \\"He was also given the name of ‚ÄòGora‚Äô because of his extremely fair complexion.\\" His birthday is celebrated as Gaura-purnima.

Chaitanya () means '\\"consciousness\\"; Maha means \\"Great\\" and Prabhu means \\"Lord\\" or \\"Master\\". Chaitanya was born as the second son of Jagannath Mishra and his wife Sachi Devi. Devi was the daughter of Nilambara Chakravarti, a Brahmin of Sylhet. Jagannath's family lived in the village of Dhakadakshin in Srihatta. The ruins of his ancestral home still survive in present day Bangladesh.Nair, p. 87 According to Chaitanya Charitamrita, Chaitanya was born in Nabadwip (in present-day West Bengal) on the full moon night of 18 February 1486, at the time of a lunar eclipse. A number of stories also exist telling of Chaitanya's apparent attraction to the chanting and singing of Krishna's names from a very young age,CC Adi lila 14.22 but largely this was perceived as being secondary to his interest in acquiring knowledge and studying Sanskrit. When travelling to Gaya to perform the shraddha ceremony for his departed father, Chaitanya met his guru, the ascetic Ishvara Puri, from whom he received initiation with the Gopala Krishna mantra. This meeting was to mark a significant change in Chaitanya's outlookCC Adi lila 17.9 \\"In Gayla, Sri Chaitanya M√§haprabhu was initiated by Isvara Puri, and immediately afterwards He exhibited signs of love of Godhead. He again displayed such symptoms after returning home.\\" and upon his return to Bengal the local Vaishnavas, headed by Advaita Acharya, were stunned at his external sudden 'change of heart' (from 'scholar' to 'devotee') and soon Chaitanya became the eminent leader of their Vaishnava group within Nadia. After leaving Bengal and receiving entrance into the sannyasa order by Swami Kesava Bharati,Teachings of Lord Chaitanya \\"They were surprised to see Lord Chaitanya after He accepted his sannyasa order from Kesava Bharati\\" Chaitanya journeyed throughout the length and breadth of India for several years, chanting the divine Names of Krishna constantly. At that time He travelled on foot covering a lot of places like Baranagar, Mahinagar, Atisara and, at last, Chhatrabhog. Chhatrabhog is the place where Goddess Ganga and Lord Shiva met, then one hundred mouths of Ganga were visible from here. From the source of Vrindavana Dasa's Chaitanya Bhagavata, he bathed at Ambulinga Ghat of Chhatrabhog with intimate companions with great chorus- chanting (kirtan). After staying one night he set for Puri by boat with the help of Local Administrator Ram Chandra Khan. He spent the last 24 years of his life in Puri, Odisha,History of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. The first 6 years, he traveled extensively from Rameshavara in South India to Vrindavan in North India, sharing the message of bhakti. He is also said to have achieved major intellectual successes in converting intellectual giants of his times such as Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya and Prakashananda Saraswati to his devotional understanding of Vedanta. \\"Chaitanya spent the remainder of His life, another 24 years, in Jagann√§th Puri in the company of some of His intimate associates, such as Svar√ºpa D√§modara and R√§m√§nanda R√§ya\\" the great temple city of Jagannath in the Radhakanta Math. The Gajapati king, Prataprudra Dev, regarded Chaitanya as Krishna's avatar and was an enthusiastic patron and devotee of Chaitanya's recitation (sankeertan) gatherings.Gaudiya Vaishnavas \\"His magnetism attracted men of great learning such as S√§rvabhauma Bhatt√§ch√§rya, the greatest authority on logic, and Shree Advaita √Ñch√§rya, leader of the Vaishnavas in Bengal, and men of power and wealth like the King of Odisha, Pratap Rudra and his minister, R√§m√§nanda R√§ya...\\" It was during these years that Chaitanya is believed by his followers to have sunk deep into various Divine-Love (samƒÅdhi) and performed pastimes of divine ecstasy (bhakti).Srimad Bhagavatam, Introduction \\"At Puridhawm, when he [Chaitanya] entered the temple of Jagann√§tha, he became at once saturated with transcendental ecstasy\\" Vrindavan, the land of Radha Rani, the ‚ÄúCity of Temples‚Äù has more than 5000 temples to showcase the pastimes of Radha and Krishna. The essence of Vrindavan was lost over time until the 16th century, when it was rediscovered by Chaitanya. In the year 1515, Chaitanya visited Vrindavana, with the purpose of locating the lost holy places associated with Lord Sri Krishna's transcendent pastimes. He wandered through the different sacred forests of Vrindavana in a spiritual trance of divine love. It was believed that by His divine spiritual power, he was able to locate all the important places of Krishna's pastimes in and around Vrindavan including the seven main temples or sapta devalay, which are worshiped by Vaishnavas in the Chaitanya tradition to this day.Srimad Bhagavatam (Introduction) \\"Lord Caitanya not only preached the Srimad-Bhagavatam but propagated the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita as well in the most practical way.\\"  Biographies  There are numerous biographies available from the time giving details of Chaitanya's life, the most prominent ones being the Chaitanya Charitamrita of Krishnadasa Kaviraja, the earlier Chaitanya Bhagavata of Vrindavana DasaGaudiya Literature (both originally written in Bengali but now widely available in English and other languages), and the Chaitanya Mangala, written by \\"Lochana Dasa\\".Biography of Sri Locana Dasa Thakura (salagram.net) These works are in Bengali with some Sanskrit verses interspersed.

Identity According to the hagiographies of 16th-century authors, he exhibited his Universal Form same as had Lord Krishna on number of occasions, notably to Advaita ƒÄcƒÅrya and NityƒÅnanda Prabhu.CC Adi-lila 17.10Chaitanya Bhagavata ƒÄdi-kha·πá·∏ça 1.122Chaitanya Bhagavata, Madhya-kha·πá·∏ça 24 When Rupa Goswami first met the Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, he saw the divinity in him and composed the following verse: > \\"O most munificent incarnation! You are Krishna Himself appearing as Sri > Krishna Caitanya Mahaprabhu. You have assumed the golden colour of Srimati > Radharani, and You are widely distributing pure love of Krishna. We offer > our respectful obeisances unto You.\\" The evidence for the belief that the Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is an incarnation of Lord Krishna is found in the Srimad Bhagavatam: Also in some other Scriptures like Vishnu SahasranƒÅma, Bhavishya Purana, Padma Purana, Garuda Purana there are references of Chaitanaya Mahaprabhu being incarnation of Krishna. Gaudiya Vaishnavas consider Chaitanya to be Lord Krishna himself but appearing in the covered form (channa avatar) who appeared in the Kali Yuga as his own devotee to show the easiest way to achieve Krishna Consciousness.The Gaudiya Vaishnava acharya Bhaktivinoda Thakura had also found out the rare manuscript of Chaitanya Upanisad of the Atharvaveda section, which reveals the identity of Chaitanya. There are various evidences in the Hindu scriptures to show that, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was non-different from Krishna. Unlike the other avatars of Krishna he did not kill any demon. Mahaprabhu brought light to the chanting of Hare Krishna Mahamantra. According to Chaitanya Bhagavat, which gives a detailed description of Mahaprabhu's life, Mahaprabhu made a prediction that the holy name of Krishna will be sung in every town and village of the world and this is evident in the history. International Society of Krishna Consciousness was started by Srila Prabhupada in the USA, proved the prediction to be correct.

Lord Chaitanya's direct teachings are recorded in Sanskrit verses called Siksastakam (though, in Vaishnava Padavali it is said: \\"Chaitanya himself wrote many songs on the Radha-Krishna theme\\"). Chaitanya's epistemological, theological and ontological teachings are summarised as ten root principles called dasa mula.Thakura, B. (1993). Jaiva dharma: The universal religion (K. Das, Trans.). Los Angeles, CA: Krishna Institute. # The statements of amnaya (scripture) are the chief proof. By these statements the following nine topics are taught. # Krishna is the Supreme Absolute Truth. # Krishna is endowed with all energies. # Krishna is the source of all rasa- flavor, quality, or spiritual rapture/emotions. # The jivas (individual souls) are all separated parts of the Lord. # Inbound state the jivas are under the influence of matter, due to their tatastha (marginal) nature. # In the liberated state the jivas are free from the influence of matter. # The jivas and the material world are both different from and identical to the Lord. # Pure devotion is the only way to attain liberation. # Pure love of Krishna is the ultimate goal. ‡¶ö‡ßà‡¶§‡¶®‡ßç‡¶Ø ‡¶Æ‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶≠‡ßÅ.jpg60 feet Chaitanya Mahaprabhu statue in Nabadwip.

Philosophy and Tradition Despite having been initiated in the Madhvacharya tradition and taking sannyasa from Shankara's tradition, Chaitanya's philosophy is sometimes regarded as a tradition of his own within the Vaishnava framework ‚Äì having some marked differences with the practices and the theology of other followers of Madhvacharya. He took Mantra Upadesa from Isvara Puri and Sanyasa Diksha from Keshava Bharati. Chaitanya is not known to have written anything himself except for a series of verses known as the Siksastaka, or \\"eight verses of instruction\\",TLC: Lord Chaitanya's Mission \\"Although Lord Caitanya was widely renowned as a scholar in His youth, He left only eight verses, called Sikshashtaka\\" which he had spoken, and were recorded by one of his close colleagues. The eight verses created by Chaitanya are considered to contain the complete philosophy of Gaudiya Vaishnavism in condensed form. Chaitanya requested a select few among his followers (who later came to be known as the Six Gosvamis of Vrindavan) to systematically present the theology of bhakti he had taught to them in their own writings.History of Gaudiya Vaishnavism \\"He requested ... the Six Goswamis of Vrindavan, to systematically present ... the theology of bhakti he had taught\\" The six saints and theologians were Rupa Goswami, Sanatana Goswami, Gopala Bhatta Goswami, Raghunatha Bhatta Goswami, Raghunatha Dasa Goswami and Jiva Goswami, a nephew of brothers Rupa and Sanatana. These individuals were responsible for systematising Gaudiya Vaishnava theology. Narottama Dasa, Srinivasa Acarya and Syamananda Pandit were among the stalwarts of the second generation of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. Having studied under Jiva Goswami, they were instrumental in propagating the teachings of the Goswamis throughout Bengal, Odisha and other regions of Eastern India. Many among their associates, such as Ramacandra Kaviraja and Ganga Narayan Chakravarti, were also eminent teachers in their own right.Narottama Dasa Thakur: Biography In the early 17th century Kalachand Vidyalankar, a disciple of Chaitanya, made his preachings popular in Bengal. He travelled throughout India popularising the gospel of anti-untouchability, social justice and mass education. He probably initiated 'Pankti Bhojon' and Krishna Sankirtan in the eastern part of Bengal. Several schools (sampradaya) have been practising it for hundreds of years. Geetashree Chabi Bandyopadhyay and Radharani Devi are among many who achieved fame by singing kirtan. The Dalits in Bengal, at that time a neglected and underprivileged caste, readily accepted his libertarian outlook and embraced the doctrine of Mahaprabhu. His disciples were known as Kalachandi Sampraday, who inspired the people to eradicate illiteracy and casteism. Many consider Kalachand as the Father of Rationalism in East Bengal (Purba Banga). The festival of Kheturi, presided over by Jahnava Thakurani,Festival of Kheturi the wife of Nityananda, was the first time the leaders of the various branches of Chaitanya's followers assembled together. Through such festivals, members of the loosely organised tradition became acquainted with other branches along with their respective theological and practical nuances.Charismatic Renewal in Gaudiya Vaishnavism (pdf) Around these times, the disciples and descendants of Nityananda and Advaita Acharya, headed by Virabhadra and Krishna respectively, started their family lineages (vamsa) to maintain the tradition. The vamsa descending from Nityananda through his son Virabhadra forms the most prominent branch of the modern Gaudiya tradition, though descendants of Advaita, along with the descendants of many other associates of Chaitanya, maintain their following especially in the rural areas of Bengal. Gopala Guru Goswami, a young associate of Chaitanya and a follower of Vakresvara Pandit, founded another branch based in Odisha. The writings of Gopala, along with those of his disciple Dhyanacandra Goswami, have had a substantial influence on the methods of internal worship in the tradition. From the very beginning of Chaitanya's bhakti movement in Bengal, Haridasa Thakur and others, Muslim or Hindu by birth, were participants. Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, the great sage of Dakshineswar, who lived in the 19th century, emphasised the bhakti marga of Chaitanya, whom he referred to as \\"Gauranga.\\" (The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna). This openness received a boost from Bhaktivinoda Thakura's broad-minded vision in the late 19th century and was institutionalised by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati in his Gaudiya Matha in the 20th century. In the 20th century the teachings of Chaitanya were brought to the West by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (1896-1977), a representative of the Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati branch of Chaitanya's tradition. Prabhupada founded his movement known as The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) to spread Chaitanya's teachings throughout the world.History of the Hare Krishna Movement Saraswata gurus and acharyas, members of the Goswami lineages and several other Hindu sects which revere Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, including devotees from the major Vaishnava holy places in Mathura District, West Bengal and Odisha, also established temples dedicated to Krishna and Chaitanya outside India in the closing decades of the 20th century. In the 21st century, Vaishnava bhakti is now also being studied through the academic medium of Krishnology in a number of academic institutions.Krishnology (definition) Cultural legacy Chaitanya's influence on the cultural legacy in Bengal and Odisha has been significant, with many residents performing daily worship to him as an avatar of Krishna. Some attribute to him a Renaissance in Bengal,Bengal Studies Conference \\"History says that the Bengali people experienced the renaissance: not only once but also twice in the course of history. Bengalis witnessed the first renaissance in the 16th century when Hossain Shah and Sri Chaitanya‚Äôs idealism influenced a sect of the upper literal class of people\\" different from the more well-known 19th-century Bengal Renaissance. Salimullah Khan (b. 1958), a noted Bangladeshi linguist, maintains, \\"Sixteenth-century is the time of Chaitanya Dev, and it is the beginning of Modernism in Bengal. The concept of 'humanity' that came into fruition is contemporaneous with that of Europe\\". Noted Bengali biographical film on Chaitanya, Nilachaley Mahaprabhu (1957), was directed by Kartik Chattopadhyay (1912-1989).

The Oxford Dictionary of English defines a slogan as \\"a short and striking or memorable phrase used in advertising.\\" A slogan usually has the attributes of being memorable, very concise and appealing to the audience. Etymology The word slogan is derived from slogorn which was an Anglicisation of the Scottish Gaelic and Irish sluagh-ghairm (sluagh \\"army\\", \\"host\\" + gairm \\"cry\\").Merriam-Webster (2003), p. 1174. Irish Slogans vary from the written and the visual to the chanted and the vulgar. Their simple rhetorical nature usually leaves little room for detail and a chanted slogan may serve more as social expression of unified purpose than as communication to an intended audience. George E. Shankel's (1941, as cited in Denton Jr., 1980) research states that, \\"English-speaking people began using the term by 1704.\\" The term at that time meant \\"the distinctive note, phrase or cry of any person or body of persons.\\" Slogans were common throughout the European continent during the Middle Ages; they were used primarily as passwords to ensure proper recognition of individuals at night or in the confusion of battle. Likability Crimmins' (2000, as cited in Dass, Kumar, Kohli, & Thomas, 2014) research suggests that brands are an extremely valuable corporate asset, and can constitute much of a business's total value. With this in mind, if we take into consideration Keller's (1993, as cited in Dass, Kumar, Kohli, & Thomas, 2014) research, which suggests that a brand is made up of three different components. These include, name, logo and slogan. Brands names and logos both can be changed by the way the receiver interprets them. Therefore, the slogan has a large job in portraying the brand (Dass, Kumar, Kohli, & Thomas, 2014). Therefore, the slogan should create a sense of likability in order for the brand name to be likable and the slogan message very clear and concise. Dass, Kumar, Kohli, & Thomas' (2014) research suggests that there are certain factors that make up the likability of a slogan. The clarity of the message the brand is trying to encode within the slogan. The slogan emphasizes the benefit of the product or service it is portraying. The creativity of a slogan is another factor that had a positive effect on the likability of a slogan. Lastly, leaving the brand name out of the slogan will have a positive effect on the likability of the brand itself. Advertisers must keep into consideration these factors when creating a slogan for a brand, as it clearly shows a brand is a very valuable asset to a company, with the slogan being one of the three main components to a brands' image. Usage The original usage refers to the usage as a clan motto among Gaelic armies. Marketing slogans are often called taglines in the United States or straplines in the United Kingdom. Europeans use the terms baselines, signatures, claims or pay-offs. \\"Sloganeering\\" is a mostly derogatory term for activity which degrades discourse to the level of slogans. Slogans are used to convey a message about the product, service or cause that it is representing. It can have a musical tone to it or written as a song. Slogans are often used to capture the attention of the audience it is trying to reach. If the slogan is used for commercial purposes, often it is written to be memorable/catchy in order for a consumer to associate the slogan with the product it is representing.Ke. Wang 2013, p. 276. A slogan is part of the production aspect that helps create an image for the product, service or cause it is representing. A slogan can be a few simple words used to form a phrase that can be used in a repetitive manner. In commercial advertising, corporations will use a slogan as part of promotional activity. Slogans can become a global way of identifying good or service, for example Nike's slogan 'Just Do It' helped establish Nike as an identifiable brand worldwide. Slogans should catch the audience's attention and influence the consumer's thoughts on what to purchase.Ke. Wang 2013, p. 277. The slogan is used by companies to affect the way consumers view their product compared to others. Slogans can also provide information about the product, service or cause it is advertising. The language used in the slogans is essential to the message it wants to convey. Current words used can trigger different emotions that consumers will associate that product with. The use of good adjectives makes for an effective slogan; when adjectives are paired with describing nouns, they help bring the meaning of the message out through the words.Ke. Wang 2013, p. 278. When a slogan is used for advertising purposes its goal is to sell the product or service to as many consumers through the message and information a slogan provides.Ke. Wang 2013, p. 279. A slogan's message can include information about the quality of the product. Examples of words that can be used to direct the consumer preference towards a current product and its qualities are: good, beautiful, real, better, great, perfect, best, and pure.Ke. Wang 2013, pp. 278‚Äì280. Slogans can influence that way consumers behave when choosing what product to buy. Slogans offer information to consumers in an appealing and creative way. A slogan can be used for a powerful cause where the impact of the message is essential to the cause.Kohl F. David. (2011). Getting the Slogan Right. The Journal of Academic Librarianship, 37(3), 195‚Äì196Kohl 2011, p. 195. The slogan can be used to raise awareness about a current cause; one way is to do so is by showing the truth that the cause is supporting. A slogan should be clear with a supporting message. Slogans, when combined with action, can provide an influential foundation for a cause to be seen by its intended audience.Colla, E. (2014). The People Want. Middle East Research and Information Project. Retrieved from www.merip.org/mer/mer263/people-want. Slogans, whether used for advertising purpose or social causes, deliver a message to the public that shapes the audiences' opinion towards the subject of the slogan. \\"It is well known that the text a human hears or reads constitutes merely 7% of the received information. As a result, any slogan merely possesses a supportive task.\\" (Rum≈°ienƒó & Rum≈°as, 2014). Looking at a slogan as a supportive role to a brand's image and portrayal is helpful to understand why advertisers need to be careful in how they construct their slogan, as it needs to mold with the other components of the brand image, being logo and name. For example, if a slogan was pushing towards \\"environmentally friendly,\\" yet the logo and name seemed to show very little concern for the environment, it would be harder for the brand to integrate these components into a successful brand image, as they would not integrate together towards a common image.

Colonel Blimp is a British cartoon character by cartoonist David Low, first drawn for Lord Beaverbrook's London Evening Standard in April 1934.David Low Blimp is pompous, irascible, jingoistic, and stereotypically British, identifiable by his walrus moustache and the interjection \\"Gad, Sir!\\" Low claimed that he developed the character after overhearing two military men in a Turkish bath declare that cavalry officers should be entitled to wear their spurs inside tanks. The character was named after the barrage balloon, which was known as a blimp. Character Blimp issues proclamations from the Turkish bath, wrapped in his towel and brandishing some mundane weapon to emphasize his passion on some issue of current affairs. Red faced with rage and emotion, his pronouncements are often confused.. Blimp's phrasing often includes direct contradiction, as though upon starting the sentence he did not know how the sentence was to end. His initial words were always a part of an emotional catchphrase. For instance: \\"Gad, Sir! Mr Lansbury is right. The League of Nations should insist on peace -- except of course in the case of war.\\", or: \\"Gad, Sir! Lord Bunk is right. The government is marching over the edge of an abyss, and the nation must march solidly behind them.\\" Blimp is usually depicted speaking to a cartoon version of David Low, the cartoon's creator, and Blimp's comments are not infrequently directed at the opinions of Lord Beaverbrook, the owner of the newspaper in which the cartoon appeared. Blimp was a satire on the reactionary opinions of the British establishment of the 1930s and 1940s. The cartoon was intended to criticize attitudes of isolationism, impatience with the concerns of common people, and a lack of enthusiasm for democracy. These were attitudes which Low, a New Zealander, considered as being common in British politics. Although Low described his character Blimp as \\"a symbol of stupidity\\", he lessened the insult to the British upper class by adding that \\"stupid people are quite nice\\". Legacy The character has earned a legacy as a clich√©d phrase ‚Äì very reactionary opinions are characterised as \\"Colonel Blimp\\" statements.blimp, Oxford Living Dictionaries. Retrieved 28 May 2019. George Orwell and Tom Wintringham made especially extensive use of the term \\"Blimps\\" to refer to this type of military officer, Orwell in his articles and Wintringham in his books How to Reform the Army and People's War. In his 1941 essay \\"The Lion and the Unicorn\\", Orwell referred to two important sub- sections of the middle class, one of which was the military and imperialistic middle class, nicknamed the Blimps, and characterised by the \\"half-pay (i.e retired) colonel with his bull neck and diminutive brain\\". He added that they had been losing their vitality during the past thirty years, \\"writhing impotently under the changes that were happening\\".Orwell, Sonia and Angus, Ian (eds.) The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 2: My Country Right or Left, (London, Penguin) Herbert Read has also used the term to describe people who were strongly hostile to modern art.\\"It is when caricature is carried to the pitch and organization of a composition in oils, or a piece of sculpture, then the people begin to revolt. \\"I call it disgusting!\\" fumed the particular Colonel Blimp who passed me on the staircase at a Rouault exhibition.\\" Herbert Read, The Meaning of Art. London, Faber & Faber, 1951. (p.163) The term \\"Blimp\\" continues to be referenced from time to time. In a 1994 article published in The New York Review of Books, John Banville recalled a televised exchange between an elderly lady and Kingsley Amis as \\"an endearing moment, in which one glimpsed the warm and funny man that Amis used to be before he decided, some time in the 1960s, to turn himself into a literary Colonel Blimp\\". In a 2006 book, historian Christopher Clark used the term \\"blimpish\\" to characterise the Prussian Field Marshal Mollendorf (1724‚Äì1816), who distinguished himself as an officer in the Seven Years' War but whose conservatism and opposition to military reform were considered to have contributed to Prussia's defeat in the Battle of Jena in 1806.Christopher Clark, Iron Kingdom. The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600‚Äì1947, London: Penguin, 2006, pp. 124‚Äì25 In his review of Garner's Modern American Usage, David Foster Wallace referred to the \\"Colonel Blimp's rage\\" of prescriptivist journalists like William Safire. The graphic novel series The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which depicts numerous literary characters interacting with each other, includes Horatio Blimp as an overconfident major of the British army who commands the initial strike against the Martians of H.G. Wells' \\"War of the Worlds\\". Film During 1943 the team Powell and Pressburger wrote, produced, and directed a movie titled The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943). Filmed during wartime, the movie portrayed the life of an admirable British officer named Clive Candy. The story encouraged the audience to accept that though the officer was honorable, with time his opinions had become dated, and that winning a modern war required irregular means. The classic British movie featured Roger Livesey in the title role, Deborah Kerr, and Anton Walbrook.

Low was a self-taught cartoonist. Born in New Zealand, he worked in his native country before migrating to Sydney in 1911, and ultimately to London (1919), where he made his career and earned fame for his Colonel Blimp depictions and his merciless satirising of the personalities and policies of German dictator Adolf Hitler, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, and other leaders of his times. Low was born and educated in New Zealand. His first work was published when he was only 11 years old. His professional career began at The Canterbury Times in 1910. The following year he moved to Australia and worked for The Bulletin. His work attracted the attention of Henry Cadbury, the part owner of The Star, and Low moved to London in 1919, working for that paper until 1927, when he moved to the Evening Standard. There he produced his most famous work, chronicling the rise of fascism in the 1930s, the policy of Appeasement, and the conflict of World War II. His stinging depictions of Hitler and Mussolini led to his work being banned in Italy and Germany, and his being named in The Black Book. Biography =Early life= Ye Madde Designer, 1935 The son of chemist David Brown Low and Jane Caroline Flanagan, David Low was born in Dunedin on 7 April 1891, and attended primary school there. His family later moved to Christchurch, where Low briefly attended Christchurch Boys' High School. However following the death of his eldest brother, Low was taken out of school, as his parents believed that he had been weakened by over studying. Low's first cartoon was published in 1902, when he was 11 years old, a three- picture strip in the British comic Big Budget. =Early career= Low began his career as a professional cartoonist with the Canterbury Times in 1910. In 1911 he moved to Sydney, Australia to join The Bulletin. During his employment at The Bulletin, Low became well known for a 1916 cartoon satirising Billy Hughes, then the Prime Minister of Australia, entitled The Imperial Conference. After that success, Low published many cartoons depicting Hughes' forceful and eccentric personality. Hughes was not impressed and apparently called Low a \\"bastard\\" to his face. A collection of Low's cartoons of Hughes entitled The Billy Book, which he published in 1918, brought Low to the notice of Henry Cadbury, part-owner of the London Star. In 1919 Cadbury offered Low a job with the Star, which Low promptly accepted. =Move to England= In England, Low worked initially at the London Star from 1919 to 1927. The London Star sympathised with his own moderately left-wing views. In 1927, he accepted an invitation from Max Aitken to join the conservative Evening Standard on the strict understanding that there would be no editorial interference with his output. Low produced numerous cartoons about the Austrian Civil War, the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, the 1936 Summer Olympics, the Spanish Civil War, and other events of the interwar period. He also worked with Horace Thorogood to produce illustrated whimsical articles on the London scene, under the byline \\"Low & Terry\\". John Gunther called Low \\"the greatest caricaturist in the world\\". In 1937, Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels told British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax that British political cartoons, particularly those of Low's, were damaging Anglo-German relations. In 1937 Low had produced an occasional strip about \\"Hit and Muss\\" (Hitler and Mussolini), but after Germany made official complaints he substituted a composite dictator, \\"Muzzler\\".Oxford Dictionary of National Biography After the war, Low is said to have found his name in The Black Book, the list of those the Nazis planned to arrest in the aftermath of an invasion of Great Britain.Exhibition celebrates the 20th Century's greatest cartoonist, BBC Worldwide Press Releases. Retrieved on 14 October 2008. =World War II= Rendezvous, 20 September 1939. His works are featured in many British history textbooks. On 1 September, the Germans invaded Poland from the west and, on 17 September, the Soviets invaded from the east. Low depicted these events in one of his most famous cartoons, Rendezvous, first published in the Evening Standard on 20 September 1939. It satirises the cynicism which lay at the heart of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, showing Hitler and Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin bowing politely across the dead body of Poland, but nevertheless greeting each other respectively as \\"the scum of the earth, I believe?\\" and \\"the bloody assassin of the workers, I presume?\\". The words are based on those supposedly used by Henry Morton Stanley at his meeting with David Livingstone in 1871. The Harmony Boys of 2 May 1940 depicts Hitler, Stalin, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, and Spanish dictator Francisco Franco \\"harmonizing\\" and getting along quite well. When this cartoon was published, the German invasion of the Soviet Union was still more than a year in the future. His satirical works met much criticism in the British public eye. The British press called him a \\"war monger,\\" and many citizens felt disdain for his depictions of appeasement. =Remainder of career= Low remained in the United Kingdom for the rest of his career. He left the Evening Standard in 1950. That same year, he moved to the Daily Herald and stayed there until 1953. Finally, Low moved to the Manchester Guardian and was there from 1953. Low received a knighthood in the 1962 Birthday Honours and died at his home in London on 19 September 1963. His obituary in The Guardian described him as \\"the dominant cartoonist of the western world\\". A blue plaque commemorates Low at 33 Melbury Court, Kensington. =Personal life= Low married Madeline Grieve Kenning of Auckland on 7 June 1920 in St. Paul's Church, Covent Garden; they lived for many years in Golders Green, North London. The couple had two daughters: in 1939, Time described Low's breakfast as \\"a political meeting, with the cartoonist, his wife, and his two young daughters threshing out the news.\\" His wife and daughters survived him.

Etymology The most commonly cited etymology for this is that it comes from the notion common among nineteenth-century antiquarians, but based on only a single 1500 manuscript, that it was used to fill empty space at the foot of stained-glass windows in medieval churches. This etymology is often cited in modern dictionaries (such as the Collins English Dictionary and Merriam-Webster OnLine). Thomas Wilson (1896), suggested other etymologies, now considered untenable: # \\"In Great Britain the common name given to the Swastika from Anglo-Saxon times ... was Fylfot, said to have been derived from the Anglo- Saxon fower fot, meaning four-footed, or many-footed.\\"quoting from and # \\"The word [Fylfot] is Scandinavian and is compounded of Old Norse fi«´l-, equivalent to the Anglo-Saxon fela, German viel, \\"many\\", and f√≥tr, \\"foot\\", the many- footed figure.\\"quoting from The Germanic root fele is cognate with English full, which has the sense of \\"many\\". Both fele and full are in turn related to the Greek poly-, all of which stem from the proto-Indo-European root *ple-. A fylfot is thus a \\"poly-foot\\", to wit, a \\"many-footed\\" sigil. History The Fylfot, together with its sister figure the gammadion, has been found in a great variety of contexts over the centuries. It has occurred in both secular and sacred contexts in the British Isles, elsewhere in Europe, in Asia Minor and in Africa. While these two terms might be broadly interchangeable in some places, we can detect a certain degree of affinity between term and terrain. Thus we might usefully associate the Gammadion more with Byzantium, Rome and Graeco-Roman culture on the one hand, and the Fylfot more with Celtic and Anglo-Saxon culture on the other. Although the Gammadion is very similar to the Fylfot in appearance, it is thought to have originated from the conjunction of four capital 'Gammas', Gamma being the third letter of the Greek alphabet. Both of these swastika-like crosses may have been indigenous to the British Isles before the Roman invasion. Certainly they were in evidence a thousand years earlier but these may have been largely imports. They were certainly substantially in evidence during the Romano-British period with widespread examples of the duplicated Greek fret motif appearing on mosaics. After the withdrawal of the Romans in the early 5th century there followed the Anglo-Saxon and Jutish migrations. We know that the Fylfot was very popular amongst these incoming tribes from Northern Europe as we find it on artefacts such as brooches, sword hilts and funerary urns. Although the findings at Sutton Hoo are most instructive about the style of lordly Anglo- Saxon burials, the Fylfot or Gammadion on the silver dish unearthed there clearly had an Eastern provenance. The Fylfot was widely adopted in the early Christian centuries. It is found extensively in the Roman catacombs. A most unusual example of its usage is to be found in the porch of the parish church of Great Canfield, Essex, England. As the parish guide rightly states, the Fylfot or Gammadion can be traced back to the Roman catacombs where it appears in both Christian and pagan contexts. More recently it has been found on grave-slabs in Scotland and Ireland. A particularly interesting example was found in Barhobble, Wigtownshire in Scotland. (passim) Gospel books also contain examples of this form of the Christian cross. The most notable examples are probably the Book of Kells and the Lindisfarne Gospels. Mention must also be made of an intriguing example of this decoration that occurs on the Ardagh Chalice. From the early 14th Century on, the Fylfot was often used to adorn Eucharistic robes. During that period it appeared on the monumental brasses that preserved the memory of those priests thus attired. They are mostly to be found in East Anglia and the Home Counties. Probably its most conspicuous usage has been its incorporation in stained glass windows notably in Cambridge and Edinburgh. In Cambridge it is found in the baptismal window of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, together with other allied Christian symbols, originating in the 19th century. In Scotland, it is found in a window in the Scottish National War Memorial in Edinburgh. The work was undertaken by Douglas Strachan and installed during the 1920s. He was also responsible for a window in the chapel of Westminster College, Cambridge. A similar usage is to be found in the Central Congregational Church in Providence, Rhode Island, USA. It was not a little surprising to find the Fylfot on church bells in England. They were adopted by the Heathcote family in Derbyshire as part of their iconographic tradition in the 16th and 17th centuries. This is probably an example where pagan and Christian influence both have a part to play as the Fylfot was amongst other things the symbol of Thor, the Norse god of thunder and its use on bells suggests it was linked to the dispelling of thunder in popular mythology. In heraldry Arms of Leonard Chamberlayne: Argent a chevron between three fylfots gules‚Äîdrawn from the blazon given in MS. Harleian, 1394 In modern heraldry texts the fylfot is typically shown with truncated limbs, rather like a cross potent that's had one arm of each T cut off. It's also known as a cross cramponned, ~nn√©e, or ~nny, as each arm resembles a crampon or angle-iron (compare Winkelma√ükreuz in German). Examples of fylfots in heraldry are extremely rare, and the charge is not mentioned in Oswald Barron's article on \\"Heraldry\\" in most 20th-century editions of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. A twentieth-century example (with four heraldic roses) can be seen in the Lotta Sv√§rd emblem. Parker's Glossary of Heraldry (see below) gives the following example: : Argent, a chevron between three fylfots gules--Leonard CHAMBERLAYNE, Yorkshire [so drawn in MS. Harleian, 1394, pt. 129, fol. 9=fol. 349 of MS.] (In lieu of an image from this MS., a modern rendering of this blazon is shown on the right.) Even in the last few centuries the fylfot is conspicuous by its absence from grants of arms (understandably so since 1945; see: Swastika‚ÄîStigma). Modern use of the term Odinic Rite \\"fylfot\\" From its use in heraldry‚Äîor from its use by antiquaries‚Äîfylfot has become an established word for this symbol, in at least British English. However, it was only rarely used. Wilson, writing in 1896, says, \\"The use of Fylfot is confined to comparatively few persons in Great Britain and, possibly, Scandinavia. Outside of these countries it is scarcely known, used, or understood.\\" In more recent times, fylfot has gained greater currency within the areas of design history and collecting, where it is used to distinguish the swastika motif as used in designs and jewellery from that used in Nazi paraphernalia. Even though the swastika does not derive from Nazism, it has become associated with it, and fylfot functions as a more acceptable term for a \\"good\\" swastika. Hansard for 12 June 1996 reports a House of Commons discussion about the badge of No. 273 Fighter Squadron, Royal Air Force. In this, fylfot is used to describe the ancient symbol, and swastika used as if it refers only to the symbol used by the Nazis. Odinic Rite (OR), a Germanic pagan organization, use both \\"swastika\\" and \\"fylfot\\" for what they claim as a \\"holy symbol of Odinism\\". The OR fylfot is depicted with curved outer limbs, more like a \\"sunwheel swastika\\" than a traditional (square) swastika or heraldic fylfot.

He was the father of Iain Duncan Smith, Member of Parliament (MP) since 1992 and Leader of the Conservative Party from 2001 to 2003. Early life Duncan Smith was born in Madras, India (now Chennai) on 28 May 1914, the son of a Mysore Post Office Superintendent, Wilfrid Arthur Smith and Anna Cecilia Smith (n√©e Duncan). He was educated at Nairn and Morrison's Academy, Crieff, in Scotland, where he joined his school's Officers' Training Corps. Returning to India in 1933, he became a coffee and tea planter, but in 1936 returned to Britain to work as a mechanical engineer, and then was a salesman for Great Western Motors in Reading. With war looming, he joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR). Second World War A sergeant at the start of the Second World War, Duncan Smith was commissioned as a pilot officer (on probation) on 29 September 1940. Serving with No. 7 Operational Training Unit at the outbreak of war, Smith was posted to the Spitfire-equipped No. 611 Squadron RAF at RAF Hornchurch in October 1940. He was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) in June 1941, and went to No. 603 Squadron RAF in August 1941 as a Flight Commander. Smith was due for a rest but had to remain operational, leading his squadron while bringing their new squadron leader up to speed. He was promoted to flying officer (war-substantive) on 29 September. On 20 November he was taken ill, passing out after returning from a convoy patrol. Smith spent some time in hospital with double pneumonia, the symptoms of which he had assumed was only the result of exhaustion from a long operational tour. Upon recovery in January 1942, Duncan Smith rejoined the \\"Hornchurch Wing\\", now flying the improved Spitfire Mk.IX. In March 1942 he was promoted to acting squadron leader and given command of No. 64 Squadron RAF. He was promoted to flight lieutenant (war-substantive) on 27 June. During the ill- fated Dieppe Raid on 19 August, Duncan-Smith was shot down by enemy fighter but rescued from the English Channel with injuries and eardrum pain. In August he became an acting wing commander (flying) at RAF North Weald. In November he was rested from operations with a posting to take charge of the Tactics Branch at Fighter Command, his input leading to the formation of the Fighter Command School of Tactics at RAF Charmy Down. He was promoted to squadron leader (war- substantive) on 30 November. While Smith's non-operational tour was recognised as very productive, he began to seek a return to operations, and he was sent to Malta to command the 244th Fighter Wing. During this time his flew in support of the Allied landings on Sicily. On 12 July he was shot down for the second time, but this episode ended well when he landed at Safi airfield on Malta with his Mark IX Spitfire riddled with cannon shells in fuselage, elevator and rudder: \\"My Spitfire was in a mess. cannon shells had blasted a couple of large holes in the side. One had burst against the radio and armour behind my seat. another, having made a hole the size of a football, had torn the control wires to shreds. The elevator was hanging by one thread of frayed wire and my rigger neatly snapped this with a sharp blow from his fingers. 'You will not be needing that any more,' he grinned at me. 'It all looks very untidy - doesn't it?' Another cannon shell had torn big pieces out of the elevator and rudder surfaces.\\"Smith, Duncan W.G.G: Spitfire into Battle, p.151-152 Potential victors could be Experten Fw. Heinrich Steis from 4./JG 27 or Ofw. G√ºnther \\"Hupatz\\" Seeger of 7./JG 53. On 2 September 1943 just before invasion to Italy, a fuel shortage, when switching fuel tanks failed, forced him to bail out into the sea badly hitting his knee cap in the proces, being rescued after more than six hours adrift. He was very lucky for the second time, when dragged to Walrus by rope, plane was severely shot up by enemy fighter. \\"The Walrus was badly holed below the water and a cannon shell had pierced the wing tank, but luckily, though petrol spewed all over the place, the old bus did not catch fire. The blow I felt was from a bullet that tore through the collar of my Mae West grazing my neck before smacking into the Walrus. We got down at Milazzon safely, after a brilliant landing by the pilot, and I was whisked off to the American field hospital close by. There they were very kind and after fixing up my leg and dressing the neck wound tried to keep me for the night, but I managed to talk the doctor into letting me return to Lentini. The Walrus Air Sea Rescue aircraft was a total wreck having been damaged in too many vital parts.\\"Smith, Duncan W.G.G: Spitfire into Battle, p.164-169 The sad end to the story, except Duncan losing his footwear in the sea, was news, that his comrade Dick Charrington was shot down and killed during this rescue mission by enemy fighter. If we consider the time, area and date, Uffz. Alfred Scharl of 2./JG 53 could be the one, who killed him on 2 September 1940 at 17.20 15 km North of Tropea at no height. Who severely damaged the Walrus is not known. After all those sunburns, injuries, wounds and return of ear pain from 19 August 1942, he was considered not to be fit for action. As an acting group captain, he then took charge of 324 Wing, finally leaving in March 1945. Duncan Smith was credited with 17 enemy aircraft shot down, two shared destroyed, six probables, two shared probables and eight damaged in aerial combat.Price 1997, p. 25. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and Bar and the DFC and Bar in recognition of his bravery. He was the author of Spitfire into Battle (1981), an account of aerial combat in the Supermarine Spitfire. Post war On 3 December 1946, Duncan Smith was promoted to the temporary rank of squadron leader in the RAFVR (seniority from 1 November 1946), receiving promotion to the substantive rank of flight lieutenant in the RAFVR on 1 November 1947 (seniority from 1 December 1942). On 22 March 1948, he was appointed to a permanent RAF commission in the rank of squadron leader, with seniority from the same date. He received a second Bar to his DFC for service in the Malayan Emergency in 1952, and was promoted to wing commander on 1 January 1953. He retired on 24 November 1960, retaining the rank of group captain. Personal life Duncan Smith was given his mother's maiden name (Duncan) as a middle name‚Äîa fairly conventional practice of the Edwardian period‚Äîbut his father's name was \\"Smith\\", not \\"Duncan Smith\\" and, in Second World War RAF records, Duncan Smith himself is always listed as W. G. G. D. Smith, not W.G.G. Duncan Smith. It is not known precisely when he started using his mother's maiden name as part of his surname but he decided to pass the name to his children. Whether this makes the current family surname \\"Duncan Smith\\" or still \\"Smith\\" is a moot point. His wife, Pamela Summers (whom he married in 1946) was a ballet dancer who was born in Nanking, China where her father was a commissioner in the Chinese Postal Service. Her maternal grandmother was Ellen Oshey Matsumuro, a Japanese woman whose father was a Japanese artist. Their son Iain Duncan Smith is a politician who was leader of the Conservative Party from September 2001 to November 2003 and Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in the Coalition government of 2010. In his office hangs a portrait of Adam Duncan, the admiral who defeated the Dutch Navy at the Battle of Camperdown in 1797. It is, however, very unlikely that W. G. G. D.

She was regent of the county of Champagne in 1179‚Äì1181, and in 1190‚Äì1197. She was the elder daughter of King Louis VII of France and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine.  Early life  Marie's birth was hailed as a \\"miracle\\" by Bernard of Clairvaux, an answer to his prayer to bless the marriage between her mother Eleanor of Aquitaine and her father, Louis VII. She was just two years old when her parents led the Second Crusade to the Holy Land. Not long after their return in 1152, when Marie was seven, her parents' marriage was annulled. Custody of Marie and her younger sister, Alix, was awarded to their father, since they were at that time the only heirs to the French throne. Both Louis and Eleanor remarried quickly; Eleanor married King Henry II and became Queen of England. Louis remarried first Constance of Castile (d. 1160) and then Adele of Champagne on 13 November 1160. Marie had numerous half-siblings on both her mother's and father's side, including the eventual kings Philip II of France and John and Richard I of England.  Marriage  In 1153, well before Louis married Adele of Champagne, he betrothed Marie and Alix to Adele's brothers. These alliances were arranged based on the intervention of Bernard of Clairvaux, as reported in the contemporary chronicle of Radulfus Niger. After her betrothal, Marie was sent to live with the Viscountess Elizabeth of Mareuil-sy-A√ø and then to the abbey of Avenay in Champagne for her Latin-based education. In 1159, Marie married Henry I, Count of Champagne.:p. 522.  Regencies  Marie became regent for Champagne when her husband Henry I went on pilgrimage to the Holy Land from 1179 until 1181. While her husband was away, Marie's father died and her half- brother, Philip Augustus, became king of France. He confiscated his mother's dower lands and married Isabelle of Hainaut, who was previously betrothed to Marie's eldest son. This prompted Marie to join a party of disgruntled nobles‚Äîincluding the queen mother Adela of Champagne and the archbishop of Reims‚Äîin plotting unsuccessfully against Philip. Eventually, relations between Marie and her royal brother improved. Her husband died soon after his return from the Holy Land in 1181, leaving her again as regent for her young son Henry. Now a widow with four young children, Marie considered marrying Philip of Flanders in 1184, but the engagement was broken off suddenly for unknown reasons. In 1187, after Saladin won a significant victory over the West and recaptured Jerusalem, Marie served again as regent for Champagne as her son Henry II joined the Third Crusade, from 1190 to 1197. He remained in the Levant, marrying Isabelle of Jerusalem in 1192. Over the course of her regencies, Champagne was transformed from a patchwork of territories into a significant principality.  Death and legacy  Marie was able to retire only briefly to the nunnery of Ch√¢teau de Fontaines-les-Nonnes near Meaux (1187-1190), before being called back to govern Champagne. She died March 11, 1198 not long after hearing the tragic news of her son's death. She was buried in Meaux Cathedral. On 25 June 1562, rioting Huguenots devastated many edifices, including the Cathedral of Maux; it was on this occasion that the tomb of Marie de Champagne, located in the choir, was destroyed.  Literary patronage  160x160px As great-granddaughter of the first troubadour, William IX, Duke of Aquitaine, it is not surprising that Marie would be an avid supporter of the arts. Marie was a patron of literature and her court became a sphere of influence on authors and poets such as Andreas Capellanus, who served in her court and referred to her several times in his writing, Chr√©tien de Troyes, who credits her with the idea for his Lancelot: The Knight of the Cart, the troubadours Bertran de Born and Bernart de Ventadorn, Gautier d'Arras and Conon de B√©tune. She is credited with the widely held belief of fin'amors or Courtly Love, that love cannot exist within the bounds of marriage. Being literate in both French and Latin, she amassed and maintained her own extensive library. A deep affection existed between Marie and her half-brother King Richard, and a stanza from his celebrated poem J'a nuns hons pris, lamenting his captivity in Austria, was addressed to her.

Life Maine de Biran was born at Bergerac; died at Paris, 16 July, 1824. The name Maine he assumed (some time before 1787) from an estate called Le Maine, near Mouleydier. After studying with distinction at P√©rigueux, he entered the life guards of King Louis XVI of France, and was present at Versailles during the events of October 1789. He entered politics and was part of the Conseil des Cinq Cents in April, 1797; however, as he incurred the hostility of the Directory by his royalist sympathies he withdrew to his patrimonial inheritance of Grateloup, near Bergerac, where he avoided the excesses of the French Revolution and where he devoted himself to philosophy. It was at this period that, to use his own words, he \\"passed per saltum from frivolity to philosophy\\". He began with psychology, which he made the study of his life. After the Reign of Terror, Maine de Biran took part in politics and was elected to parliament in 1812, 1815, and 1820. Having been excluded from the Council of the Five Hundred on suspicion of royalism, he took part with his friend Joseph Lain√© in the commission of 1813, which first expressed direct opposition to the will of the emperor Napoleon. After the restoration of the monarchy, he became treasurer to the chamber of deputies, retiring during each autumn recess to study at home. His constitution was delicate and sensitive and his philosophic bent had already manifested itself by his observations on the influence of the physical state on the moral. As an ideologist he won the prize at the Institut with his essay \\"Sur l'habitude\\" (1802); but his \\"D√©composition de la pens√©e\\" (1805) shows him deviating from the theory of that school, and in \\"La perception imm√©diate\\" (1807), and \\"Rapports du physique et du morale de l'homme\\" (1811), he is an opponent of the eighteenth-century philosophy. In his latter days his tendency to mysticism gradually brought him back towards practical Christianity, and he died a faithful child of the Catholic Church.

Thought Only a few of Maine de Biran's writings appeared during his lifetime: the essay on habit (Influence de l'habitude sur la facult√© de penser, \\"The Influence of Habit on the Faculty of Thinking\\", 1802), a critical review of Pierre Laromigui√®re's lectures (1817), and the philosophical portion of the article \\"Leibnitz\\" in the Biographie universelle (1819). A treatise on the analysis of thought (Sur la d√©composition de la pens√©e, \\"On the Decomposition of Thought\\") was never printed. In 1834 these writings, together with the essay entitled Nouvelles consid√©rations sur les rapports du physique et du moral de l'homme, were published by Victor Cousin, who in 1841 added three volumes, under the title ≈íuvres philosophiques de Maine de Biran. But the publication (in 1859) by √âdouard Naville (from manuscripts placed at his father's disposal by Biran's son) of the ≈íuvres in√©dites de Maine de Biran, in three volumes, first rendered possible a connected view of his philosophical development. Portrait of Maine de Biran, by Jean Bernard Duvivier, 1798. At first a sensualist, like Condillac and John Locke, next an intellectualist, he finally became a mystical theosophist. The Essai sur les fondements de la psychologie represents the second stage of his philosophy, the fragments of the Nouveaux essais d'anthropologie the third. Maine de Biran's early essays in philosophy were written from the point of view of Locke and Condillac, but showed signs of his later interests. Dealing with the formation of habits, he is compelled to note that passive impressions do not furnish a complete or adequate explanation. With Laromigui√®re he distinguishes attention as an active effort, of no less importance than the passive receptivity of sense, and like Joseph Butler, he distinguishes passively formed customs from active habits. He concluded that Condillac's notion of passive receptivity as the one source of conscious experience was an error of method ‚Äì in short, that the mechanical mode of viewing consciousness as formed by external influence was fallacious and deceptive. For it he proposed to substitute the genetic method, whereby human conscious experience might be exhibited as growing or developing from its essential basis in connection with external conditions. The essential basis he finds in the real consciousness, of self as an active striving power, and the stages of its development, corresponding to what one may call the relative importance of the external conditions and the reflective clearness of self-consciousness he designates as the affective, the perceptive and the reflective. In connexion with this Biran treats most of the obscure problems which arise in dealing with conscious experience, such as the mode by which the organism is cognized, the mode by which the organism is distinguished from extra-organic things, and the nature of those general ideas by which the relations of things are known to us ‚Äì cause, power, force, etc. In the last stage of his philosophy, Biran distinguished the animal existence from the human, under which the three forms above noted are classed. And both from the life of the spirit, in which human thought is brought into relation with the supersensible, divine system of things. This stage is left imperfect. Altogether Biran's work presents a very remarkable specimen of deep metaphysical thinking directed by preference to the psychological aspect of experience. So, it has been said there are three stages marking the development of his philosophy. Up to 1804, a stage called by Naville \\"the philosophy of sensation\\", he was a follower of Condillac's sensism, as modified by de Tracy, which he soon abandoned in favour of a system based on an analysis of internal reflection. In the second stage ‚Äî the philosophy of will ‚Äî 1804-18, to avoid materialism and fatalism, he embraced the doctrine of immediate apperception, showing that man knows himself and exterior things by the resistance to his effort. On reflecting he remarks the voluntary effort which differentiates his internal from his external experience, thus learning to distinguish between the ego and the non-ego. In the third stage ‚Äî the philosophy of religion ‚Äî after 1818, we find de Biran advocating a mystical intuitional psychology. To man's two states of life: representation (common to animals), and volition (volition, sensation, and perception), he adds a third: love or life of union with God, in which the life of Divine grace absorbs representation and volition. Maine de Biran's style is laboured, but he is reckoned by Cousin as the greatest French metaphysician from the time of Malebranche. His genius was not fully recognized till after his death, as the essay \\"Sur l'habitude\\" (Paris, 1803) was the only book that appeared under his name during his lifetime; but his reputation was firmly established on the publication of his writings, partly by Cousin (\\"≈íuvres philosophiques de Maine de Biran\\", Paris, 1834-41), and partly by Naville (\\"≈íuvres in√©dites de Maine de Biran\\", Paris, 1859). Criticism =Equating \\"cause\\" with \\"force\\"= Schopenhauer, claimed that \\"No one has carried this confusion, or rather identification, of natural force with cause so far as Maine de Biran in his Nouvelles consid√©rations des rapports du physique au moral, since this is essential to his philosophy.\\"Schopenhauer, Arthur (1903). On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason. London: George Bell & Sons, p. 52. This confusion of force of nature and cause occurred often throughout the book. \\"[W]hen he speaks of causes, he hardly ever puts cause alone, but almost always says cause ou force‚Ä¶.\\"Schopenhauer (1903), p. 52. Schopenhauer believed that the confusion was intentional. Biran was \\"conscious of identifying two disparate concepts in order to be able to make use of either of them according to the circumstances.\\" Therefore, he purposely equated cause with force in order \\"to keep the identification present in the reader‚Äôs mind.\\"Schopenhauer (1903), p. 53.

Life He was born at Livinhac-le-Haut, Rouergue, and died in Paris. As professor of philosophy at the University of Toulouse, he was unsuccessful and incurred the displeasure of the French parliament by his thesis on the rights of property in connection with taxation. Subsequently, he came to Paris, where he was appointed professor of logic in the √âcole Normale and lectured in the Prytan√©e. In 1799 he was made a member of the Tribunate, and in 1833 of the Academy of Moral and Political Science. In 1793 he published Projet d'√©l√©ments de m√©taphysique, a work characterized by lucidity and excellence of style. He wrote also two M√©moires, read before the Institute, Les Paradoxes de Condillac (1805) and Le cours de philosophie (1815-1818). Laromigui√®re's philosophy is a revolt against the extreme physiological psychology of the natural scientists, such as Cabanis. He distinguished between those psychological phenomena which can be traced directly to purely physical causes, and the actions of the soul which originate from within itself. Psychology was not for him a branch of physiology, nor on the other hand did he give to his theory an abstruse metaphysical basis. A pupil of Condillac and indebted for much of his ideology to Antoine Destutt de Tracy, he attached a fuller importance to \\"attention\\" as a psychic faculty. Attention provides the facts, Comparison groups and combines them, while Reason systematizes and explains. The soul is active in its choice, i.e. is endowed with freewill, and is, therefore, immortal. For natural science as a method of discovery he had no respect. He held that its judgments are, at the best, statements of identity, and that its so-called discoveries are merely the reiteration, in a new form, of previous truisms. Laromigui√®re was not the first to develop these views; he owed much to Condillac, Destutt de Tracy and Cabanis. The accuracy of his language and the purity of his style gave his works great influence, especially over Armand Marrast, Louis Cardaillac and Victor Cousin. A lecture of his in the √âcole Normale impressed Cousin so strongly that he at once devoted himself to the study of philosophy. Jouffroy and Hippolyte Taine agree in describing him as one of the great thinkers of the 19th century.

Life Cabanis was born at Cosnac (Corr√®ze), the son of Jean Baptiste Cabanis (1723‚Äì1786), a lawyer and agronomist. At the age of ten, he attended the college of Brives, where he showed great aptitude for study, but his independence of spirit was so great that he was almost constantly in a state of rebellion against his teachers and was finally expelled. He was then taken to Paris by his father and left to carry on his studies at his own discretion for two years. From 1773 to 1775 he travelled in Poland and Germany, and on his return to Paris he devoted himself mainly to poetry. About this time he sent to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise a translation of the passage from Homer proposed for their prize, and, though he did not win, he received so much encouragement from his friends that he contemplated translating the whole of the Iliad. At his father's wish, he gave up writing and decided to engage in a more settled profession, selecting medicine. In 1789 his Observations sur les h√¥pitaux (Observations on hospitals, 1790) procured him an appointment as administrator of hospitals in Paris, and in 1795 he became professor of hygiene at the medical school of Paris, a post which he exchanged for the chair of legal medicine and the history of medicine in 1799. Partly because of his poor health, he tended not to practise as a physician, his interests lying in the deeper problems of medical and physiological science. During the last two years of Honor√© Mirabeau's life, Cabanis was intimately connected with him, and wrote the four papers on public education which were found among the Mirabeau's papers at his death, and were edited by the real author soon afterwards in 1791. During the illness which terminated his life Mirabeau trusted entirely to Cabanis' professional skills. Of the death of Mirabeau, Cabanis drew up a detailed narrative, intended as a justification of his treatment of the case. He was enthusiastic about the French Revolution and became a member of the Council of Five Hundred and then of the conservative senate, and the dissolution of the Directory was the result of a motion which he made to that effect. His political career was brief. He was one of the Council of Five Hundred and afterwards was a member of the Senate. Hostile to the policy of Napoleon Bonaparte, he rejected every offer of a place under his government. He died at Meulan. His body is buried in the Pantheon and his heart in Auteuil Cemetery in Paris. A complete edition of Cabanis's works was begun in 1825, and five volumes were published. His principal work, Rapports du physique et du moral de l'homme (On the relations between the physical and moral aspects of man, 1802), consists in part of memoirs, read in 1796 and 1797 to the Institute, and is a sketch of physiological psychology. Psychology is with Cabanis directly linked on to biology, for sensibility, the fundamental fact, is the highest grade of life and the lowest of intelligence. All the intellectual processes are evolved from sensibility, and sensibility itself is a property of the nervous system. The soul is not an entity, but a faculty; thought is the function of the brain. Just as the stomach and intestines receive food and digest it, so the brain receives impressions, digests them, and has as its organic secretion, thought. Alongside this materialism, Cabanis held another principle. He belonged in biology to the vitalistic school of GE Stahl, and in the posthumous work, Lettre sur les causes premi√®res (1824), the consequences of this opinion became clear. Life is something added to the organism: over and above the universally diffused sensibility there is some living and productive power to which we give the name of Nature. It is impossible to avoid ascribing both intelligence and will to this power. This living power constitutes the ego, which is truly immaterial and immortal. Cabanis did not think that these results were out of harmony with his earlier theory. His work was highly appreciated by the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, who called his work \\"excellent\\". He was a member of the masonic lodge Les Neuf S≈ìurs from 1778. Evolution Cabanis was an early proponent of evolution.Staum, Martin S. (1980).

Darwin and the Emergence of Evolutionary Theories of Mind and Behavior. University of Chicago Press. pp. 37-47. In the Encyclopedia of Philosophy it is stated that he \\"believed in spontaneous generation. Species have evolved through chance mutations (\\"fortuitous changes\\") and planned mutation (\\"man's experimental attempts\\") which change the structures of heredity.\\"Borchert, Donald M. (2006). Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Volume 2. Macmillan. p. 3. He influenced the work of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who referred to Cabanis in his Philosophie Zoologique.Ruse, Michael. (1996). Monad to Man: The Concept of Progress in Evolutionary Biology. Harvard University Press. pp. 53-54. Cabanis was an advocate of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, he also developed his own theory of instinct. Cabanis made a statement that recognized a basic understanding of natural selection. Historian Martin S. Staum has written that: > In a simple statement of adaptation and selection theory, Cabanis argued > that species that have escaped extinction \\"have had successively to bend and > conform to sequences of circumstances, from which apparently were born, in > each particular circumstance, other entirely new species, better adjusted to > the new order of things.\\" References * (This article has the mistake \\"Pierre Jean George Cabanis\\" instead of \\"Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis\\".)

It is claimed as a dependency of Norway, and along with Bouvet Island and Queen Maud Land comprises one of the three Norwegian dependent territories in the Antarctic and Subantarctic. Peter I Island is long and . The tallest peak is the ultra and tall Lars Christensen Peak. Nearly all of the island is covered by a glacier and it is surrounded most of the year by pack ice, making it inaccessible during these times. There is little vertebrate animal life on the island apart from some seabirds and seals. The island was first sighted by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen on 21 January 1821 and was named for Peter I of Russia. Not until 2 February 1929 did anyone set foot on the island, when Nils Larsen and Ola Olstad's Second Norvegia Expedition, financed by Lars Christensen, was successful. They claimed it for Norway, which annexed it in 1931 and made it a dependency in 1933. The next landing occurred in 1948 and the island has been subject to some scientific research and a limited amount of tourism. The island became subject to the Antarctic Treaty in 1961. Since 1987, there has been an automated meteorological station on the island. Three amateur radio DX- peditions have visited the island and there are sporadic landings by tourists.  History  The first sighting of Peter I Island was made on 21 October 1821 by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen's expedition,Rubin (2005): 180 who commanded the ships Vostok and Mirny under the Russian flag. He named the island for Tsar Peter I the Great of Russia. Drift ice made it impossible for Bellinghausen to come nearer than from the island. It was the first land to have been spotted south of the Antarctic Circle, and was thus also the southernmost sighted land at the time of its discovery.Barr (1987): 67 In January 1910, the French expedition led by Jean-Baptiste Charcot and his ship Pourquoi-Pas ? confirmed Bellingshausen's discovery, but they also did not land, being stopped from the island by pack ice. The first landing on the island (1929). In 1926 and 1927, Norwegian Eyvind Tofte circumnavigated and surveyed the island from Odd I. However, he was also prevented from landing. The Norwegian whale-ship owner Lars Christensen financed several expeditions to the Antarctic, in part for research and in part to claim land for Norway. The latter was motivated by the British taxation of whaling stations in the Antarctic, and Christensen hoped to be able to establish stations on Norwegian territory to gain better privileges and so at least the taxes went to his home country.Kyvik et.al (2008): 52 The first expedition to land on the island was the Christensen-financed second Norvegia expedition, led by Nils Larsen and Ola Olstad. They landed on 2 February 1929 and claimed the island for Norway. Larsen attempted to land again in 1931, but was hindered by pack ice. On 6 March 1931, a Norwegian royal proclamation declared the island under Norwegian sovereignty and on 23 March 1933 the island was declared a dependency. The next landing occurred on 10 February 1948 by Larsen's ship Brategg. Biological, geological and hydrographic surveys underwent for three days, before the pack ice forced the expedition to leave. The expedition built a hut and placed a copy of the document of occupation from 1929 inside. On 23 June 1961, Peter I Island became subject to the Antarctic Treaty, after Norway's signing of the treaty in 1959.Barr (1987): 79 Since then, there have been several landings on the island by various nations for scientific investigations, as well as a limited number of ships that have successfully landed tourists on the island. In 1987, the Norwegian Polar Institute sent five scientists to spend eleven days on the island. The main focuses were aerial photography and topographical measurements to allow an accurate map of the island to be produced. The second important area was marine biological investigations, although also geological, biological and other surveys were conducted. The team also built an automatic weather station.Barr (1987): 68 Three DX-peditions have been sent to the island, in 1987, 1994 and 2006.  Geography  RV Polarstern in 1994. Peter I Island is a volcanic island located off the coast of Ellsworth Land of continental Antarctica, and about to the south-west of Smith Island, the nearest of the South Shetland Islands. It has an area of . The island is almost entirely covered by glacier, with about 95% of the surface covered by ice.Barr (1987): 65 Surrounding the island is a tall ice front and vertical cliffs. The long stretches of ice caps are supplemented with rock outcrops. Landing is only possible at three points, and only during the short period of the year in which the island is not surrounded by pack ice. These landings take place on the west side at Kapp Ingrid Christensen, a peninsula which divides the bays Norvegiabukta and Sandefjordbukta. On the cape are some narrow strips of beach, which are suitable for landing. The beach in Norvegiabukta is just wide and is entered via the natural arch Tsarporten. On the west side is a plateau, while the north and south coasts feature ice shelves. The eastern side is the steepest and features two rock columns with flat tops in the sea. The island is a shield volcano, although it is not known if it is still active, and it has been categorized as either Holocene or historic, based on date samples ranging from years ago. The summit, Lars Christensen Peak, is a wide circular crater. An ultra prominent peak at elevation, it is named after Lars Christensen. It is not known whether this volcano is extinct or not, because the upper part is apparently unmodified by glaciation, indicating an eruption several centuries ago.LeMasurier (1990): 512  Environment  Map of the island. The island's vegetation consists exclusively of mosses and lichens which have adapted to the extreme Antarctic climate. The island has a very harsh climate with strong winds and freezing temperatures. The steady snowfall keeps vegetation to a minimum. The island is a breeding ground for a few seabirds, particularly southern fulmars, but also Wilson's storm petrels and Antarctic terns. Penguins, including Ad√©lie and chinstrap penguins, visit the island infrequently. There are numerous seals, particularly crabeater seals, leopard seals and smaller numbers of southern elephant seals.  Politics  Peter I Island is one of Norway's two territorial claims in Antarctica, the other being Queen Maud Land. Peter I Island is the only claim within 90¬∞W and 150¬∞W and is also the only claim which is not a sector.Kyvik et.al (2008): 57 Being south of 60¬∞S, the island is subject to the Antarctic Treaty. The treaty ensures free access to the island for any scientific investigation, and states that it can be used only for peaceful purposes. Norway, Australia, France, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have all mutually recognized each other's claims in Antarctica. Norwegian administration of the island is handled by the Polar Affairs Department of the Ministry of Justice and Public Security, located in Oslo. The annexation of the island is regulated by the Dependency Act of 24 March 1933. It establishes that Norwegian criminal law, private law and procedural law applies to the island, in addition to other laws that explicitly state they are valid on the island. It further establishes that all land belongs to the state, and prohibits the storage and detonation of nuclear products. Since 5 May 1995, Norwegian law has required all Norwegian activity in Antarctica, including Peter I Island, to follow international environmental law for Antarctica. All Norwegian citizens who plan activities on Peter I Island must therefore report to the Norwegian Polar Institute, who may deny any non-conforming activity. All people visiting the island must follow laws regarding protection of nature, treatment of waste, pollution and insurance for search and rescue operations.

OED Online. September 2013. Oxford University Press. (accessed 13 September 2013). First conceived in 1940, the plane was built in response to the arrival of modified Junkers Ju 86P bombers flying reconnaissance missions that suggested the Luftwaffe might attempt to re-open the bombing of England from high altitude. Construction was from 1942‚Äì43. The threat never materialised; consequently, Westland produced only a small number of Welkins and few of these flew. Design and development Westland put forward their P.14, essentially an adaptation of Westland's Whirlwind fighter layout (and a more experimental twin, the P.13) to meet Air Ministry Specification F.4 of 1940 for a high altitude fighter. The most obvious feature was the enormous high aspect ratio wing, with a span on the production aircraft of .For comparison, the Avro Lancaster four-engined heavy bomber had a span of and the de Havilland Mosquito twin-engined light bomber and fighter had a span. The compact but troublesome Rolls-Royce Peregrine engines of the Whirlwind were replaced by the more powerful two-stage Rolls Royce Merlin Mk.76/77. However, the most significant feature was a pressurised cockpit. The last item required the majority of the effort in designing what would become the Welkin. After extensive development a new cockpit was developed that was built out of heavy-gauge duraluminium bolted directly to the front of the main spar. The cockpit hood used an internal layer of thick perspex to hold the pressure, and an outer thin layer to form a smooth line. Heated air was blown between the two to keep the canopy clear of frost. In January 1941, the Ministry of Aircraft Production authorised the building of two P.14 prototypes DG558 & DG562. The F.4/40 specification was revised into F.7/41 that year. The Welkin design was now in competition with the Vickers Type 432 with Merlin 61 engines. The pressurisation system was driven by a Rotol supercharger attached to the left-hand engine (this was the difference between the Merlin 76 and 77), providing a constant pressure of over the exterior pressure. This resulted in an apparent cabin altitude of when the aircraft was operating at its design altitude of . This cabin altitude was still too high for normal breathing, so the pilot had to wear an oxygen mask during flight. A rubber gasket filled with the pressurized air sealed the canopy when the system was turned on, and a valve ensured the pressure was controlled automatically. Moreover, the pilot also had to wear a high altitude suit as he might have been required to bail out at altitude. The Welkin required a sophisticated electrical system. This was to minimise the number of seals and points of entry in the cockpit for the controls and instrumentation. It took an electrician experienced in the features of the Welkin four hours to undertake a pre-flight check of this system. The wings were so large that the high lift Fowler flaps of the Whirlwind were not needed, and were replaced by a simple split flap. The extra wing area also required more stability, so the tail was lengthened to provide a longer moment arm. The armament ‚àí four Hispano 20 mm cannon ‚àí was the same as the Whirlwind's, but the Welkin carried the guns in a tray in its belly, which facilitated loading. In that position, muzzle flash was also less likely to dazzle the pilot. The Welkin was seriously handicapped by compressibility problems caused by its long, high aspect-ratio wing which needed to be thick at the root (thickness-to-chord ratio of about 19%) for strength reasons.From Spitfire To Eurofighter 45 Years of Combat Aircraft Design, Roy Boot 1990, Airlife Publishing Ltd., , p.12 Compressibility caused the flight envelope (flyable speed range) between high-incidence stall and shock-stall to become very small at high altitudes ‚Äì any decrease in airspeed causing a \\"normal\\" stall, any increase causing a shock-stall due to the aircraft's limiting critical Mach number. This reduction of the speed envelope is a problem common to all subsonic, high altitude designs and also occurred with the later Lockheed U-2. When W.E.W. Petter came to design his next high- altitude aircraft, the English Electric Canberra jet bomber, the required wing area was distinguished by noticeably short wings, with thickness-to-chord ratio (t/c) at the root of 12%,Bombers of the West, Bill Gunston 1973, Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, SBN 684-13623-6, p.16 a t/c ratio which delays compressibility effects to an aircraft speed of about Mach 0.85.Flight Handbook The Theory and Practice of Powered Flight,edited by W.T.Gunston, Sixth Edition 1962, Iliffe Books Ltd., U.S. Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 39-30641, p.26 Information on the Welkin was only released at the end of the war. A two-seat, radar-equipped night fighter version known as the Welkin NF.Mk.II for specification F.9/43 was developed but only one was eventually produced as the variant was not ordered into production. Operational history Welkin Mk I, emphasising the 70 foot span of the high- aspect ratio wings. By the time the Welkin Mk.I was complete and in production, it was apparent that the Luftwaffe was no longer conducting high altitude missions, due largely to successful interceptions by specially modified Supermarine Spitfires. Only 77 complete Welkins were produced, plus a further 26 as engine-less airframes. Although two Welkins served with the Fighter Interception Unit based at RAF Wittering from May to November 1944, where they were used to gain experience and formulate tactics for high altitude fighter operations, the Welkin was never used operationally by the RAF.Aircraft Of The Royal Air Force Since 1918, Owen Thetford, Third Edition 1962, Putnam& Co.

It is the third largest town, after Constance and Singen, in the district of Konstanz, in Baden- W√ºrttemberg. Radolfzell is a well known health care city (Mettnau) and an important railway junction of the Upper Rhine Railway and the Hegau-Ablach Valley Railway (leading to the Bodenseeg√ºrtel Railway). In 1990 Radolfzell was named the Federal Environment Capital City of Germany. History This town developed out of a monastery founded in 826 AD as a \\"cell\\" under Bishop Radolf of Verona. The town belonged to the Abbey of Reichenau, then to the house of Habsburg for a long time, and for 40 years was a Free Imperial City. In the centre is the gothic Cathedral of our Dear Lady, dating from the 15th century and decorated in the baroque style in the 18th. One particularly beautiful feature is the Rosary altar by the Z√ºrn brothers and the Master of the House's Altar (1750) which contains the relics of the local Radolfzell saints Theopont, Senesius and Zeno. The \\"Hausherrenfest\\" is celebrated in their honour every year on the third Sunday in July, and the next day a famous Water Procession is held, as it has been every year since 1797. The citizens of the nearby village of Moos make a pilgrimage to Radolfzell in picturesquely decorated boats to fulfil an ancient oath.

The word is an abridgement of which literally means \\"All-Japan League of Student Self-Government Associations.\\" Notable for organizing protests and marches, Zengakuren has been involved in Japan's anti-Red Purge movement, the anti-military base movement, the anti-Security Treaty movement, and the struggle against the construction of Narita Airport.

A Zengakuren banner is visible in the middle of the image. Although the association was formally organized 1948, political movements among Japanese college students can be traced back to much earlier times.Shimbori, Michiya. Zengakuren: A Japanese Case Study of a Student Political Movement. Printed in: Sociology of Education, Vol. 37, No. 3, Spring, 1964 https://www.jstor.org/pss/2111956 While most writers recognize that the student political movement began hand in hand with the spreading labor movement after the First World War,E.g., T. Kikukawa, Gakusei Shakai Undo Shi (The History of Student Social Movements) Tokyo: Chuokoron-sha, 1931 some writers say that this movement is as old as Japanese higher institutions. Zengakuren emerged in the early postwar period as students at Japanese universities established self-governing associations (jichikai) in order to protest against perceived fascist remnants in the university system and to organize against proposed tuition hikes. All university students were automatically enrolled in these associations, and dues were automatically deducted from their tuition. In the wake of a failed general strike in 1947, the Japan Communist Party (JCP) stepped into organize the separate university associations into a single nationwide organization. As a result of this extensive organizing effort, the formation of Zengakuren was officially announced on September 18, 1948. Akio Iwai, a member of the Japanese Communist Party, was the organization's first president. Over the course of the 1950s, Zengakuren took part in a number of \\"struggles\\" (t≈çs≈ç) and protest movements, including the \\"Bloody May Day\\" protests against the San Francisco Peace Treaty on May 1, 1952, the struggle against the Anti-Subversive Activities Law from 1952-53, the movement against nuclear testing after the Lucky Dragon Incident of 1954, the \\"Sunagawa Struggle\\" against the expansion of the United States' Tachikawa Air Base in 1955-57, the 1958 movement against the Police Duties Bill, and the massive Anpo protests against the US-Japan Security Treaty in 1959-60. In the late 1950s, an \\"anti-Stalinist\\" (i.e. anti-JCP) faction within Zengakuren nicknamed the \\"Bund\\" (Bunto in Japanese) managed to secure control of Zengakuren, in part by rigging elections. Their control of the organization was strenuously opposed by the \\"anti-mainstream\\" pro-JCP faction. This began the process of numerous internal schisms within Zengakuren that would continue throughout the 1960s. Nevertheless, for the time being Zengakuren held together in order mobilize its full power to try to stop the 1960 revision of the US-Japan Security Treaty. At the apex of its organizing power during the anti-Treaty protests in 1960, Zengakuren was able to count on around 250 jichikai at 110 schools, representing a total strength of around 290,000 students. The first open splits within Zengakuren occurred in the immediate aftermath, as despondency at the failure of the anti-Treaty protests to stop the Treaty from being ratified led to numerous rounds of recriminations. Thereafter Zengakuren split up into a large number of warring \\"sects\\" (sekuto), who would battle against each other at least as much as they battled against the police. Arming themselves with construction helmets painted in the colors of their various factions and large wooden staves they called \\"violence sticks\\" (gebab≈ç, from the German Gewalt), the participated in a number of struggles throughout the 1960s and beyond, including the struggle against normalization of diplomatic relations with Korea in 1965, protests against the docking in Japan of US Navy nuclear-powered submarines and aircraft carriers, anti-Vietnam War protests, the university struggles of 1967-69, and the Sanrizuka Struggle against the construction of Narita Airport from 1968 into the mid-1980s. Zengakuren protestors in Tokyo, 1968 Although dozens of rival sects emerged over the course of the 1960s, three tendencies emerged: # Minsei: Groups affiliated with the JCP # Sampa Rengo: An alliance of three factions all critical of the JCP: Japan Revolutionary Communist League, the Japanese Socialist Students League and the Japan League of Socialist Youth # Marugaku: The Japanese League of Marxist Students consisting of a principle faction (Chukakuha) and a \\"Revolutionary Marxist\\" faction (Kakumaru) By the end of the 1960s, there were several different factions claiming the mantle of the name \\"Zengakuren.\\" Several different groups still claim this title today, and remain active, although their numbers have dwindled greatly since their heyday in the 1950s and 1960s.

Web. 01 Jul. 2014 . and inventor whose challenges to established physical theory were part of the 19th-century revolution in thermodynamics. He served as lieutenant-colonel of the King's American Dragoons, part of the British Loyalist forces, during the American Revolutionary War. After the end of the war he moved to London, where his administrative talents were recognized when he was appointed a full colonel, and in 1784 he received a knighthood from King George III. A prolific designer, Thompson also drew designs for warships. He later moved to Bavaria and entered government service there, being appointed Bavarian Army Minister and re-organizing the army, and, in 1791, was made a Count of the Holy Roman Empire. Early years Thompson was born in rural Woburn, Massachusetts, on March 26, 1753; his birthplace is preserved as a museum. He was educated mainly at the village school, although he sometimes walked almost ten miles to Cambridge with the older Loammi Baldwin to attend lectures by Professor John Winthrop of Harvard College. At the age of 13 he was apprenticed to John Appleton, a merchant of nearby Salem. Thompson excelled at his trade, and coming in contact with refined and well educated people for the first time, adopted many of their characteristics including an interest in science. While recuperating in Woburn in 1769 from an injury, Thompson conducted experiments concerning the nature of heat and began to correspond with Loammi Baldwin and others about them. Later that year he worked for a few months for a Boston shopkeeper and then apprenticed himself briefly, and unsuccessfully, to a doctor in Woburn. Thompson's prospects were dim in 1772 but in that year they changed abruptly. He met, charmed and married a rich and well-connected heiress named Sarah Rolfe (n√©e Walker). Her father was a minister, and her late husband left her property at Concord, New Hampshire, then called Rumford. They moved to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and through his wife's influence with the governor, he was appointed a major in the New Hampshire Militia. Their first child (also named Sarah) was born in 1774.Gribbin, John. The Scientists: A History of Science Told Through the Lives of Its Greatest Inventors. New York, Random House, 2002. p. 301. Painting by Thomas Gainsborough 1783 American Revolutionary War When the American Revolutionary War began Thompson was a man of property and standing in New England and was opposed to the uprising. He was active in recruiting loyalists to fight the rebels. This earned him the enmity of the popular party, and a mob attacked Thompson's house. He fled to the British lines, abandoning his wife, as it turned out, permanently. Thompson was welcomed by the British to whom he gave valuable information about the American forces, and became an advisor to both General Gage and Lord George Germain. While working with the British armies in America he conducted experiments to measure the force of gunpowder, the results of which were widely acclaimed when published in 1781 in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. On the strength of this he arrived in London at the end of the war with a reputation as a scientist.  Bavarian maturity  The beer garden \\"Am chinesischen Turm\\" in the Englischer Garten in Munich Bavarian uniforms designed by Benjamin Thompson, also known in Bavaria as Reichsgraf von Rumford In 1785, he moved to Bavaria where he became an aide-de-camp to the Prince-elector Charles Theodore. He spent eleven years in Bavaria, reorganizing the army and establishing workhouses for the poor. He also invented Rumford's Soup, a soup for the poor, and established the cultivation of the potato in Bavaria. He studied methods of cooking, heating, and lighting, including the relative costs and efficiencies of wax candles, tallow candles, and oil lamps. On Prince Charles' behalf he created the Englischer Garten in Munich in 1789; it remains today and is known as one of the largest urban public parks in the world. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1789. For his efforts, in 1791 Thompson was made a Count of the Holy Roman Empire; he took the name \\"Rumford\\" for Rumford, New Hampshire, which was an older name for the town of Concord where he had been married, becoming Reichsgraf von Rumford (English: Count Rumford). =Experiments on heat= His experiments on gunnery and explosives led to an interest in heat. He devised a method for measuring the specific heat of a solid substance but was disappointed when Johan Wilcke published his parallel discovery first. Thompson next investigated the insulating properties of various materials, including fur, wool and feathers. He correctly appreciated that the insulating properties of these natural materials arise from the fact that they inhibit the convection of air. He then made the somewhat reckless, and incorrect, inference that air and, in fact, all gases, were perfect non-conductors of heat.Rumford (1786) \\"New experiments upon heat\\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society p.273Rumford (1792) \\"Experiments upon heat\\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society p.48-80 He further saw this as evidence of the argument from design, contending that divine providence had arranged for fur on animals in such a way as to guarantee their comfort. In 1797, he extended his claim about non- conductivity to liquids.Rumford (1797) \\"On the propagation of heat in fluids\\" Nicholson's Journal 1 pp298-341 The idea raised considerable objections from the scientific establishment, John DaltonCardwell (1971) p.99 and John Leslie making particularly forthright attacks. Instrumentation far exceeding anything available in terms of accuracy and precision would have been needed to verify Thompson's claim. Again, he seems to have been influenced by his theological beliefsRumford (1804) \\"An enquiry concerning the nature of heat and the mode of its communication\\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society p.77 and it is likely that he wished to grant water a privileged and providential status in the regulation of human life.Cardwell (1971) p.102 He is considered the founder of the sous-vide food preparation method owing to his experiment with a mutton shoulder. He described this method in one of his essays. =Mechanical equivalent of heat= Rumford's most important scientific work took place in Munich, and centred on the nature of heat, which he contended in \\"An Experimental Enquiry Concerning the Source of the Heat which is Excited by Friction\\" (1798) was not the caloric of then-current scientific thinking but a form of motion. Rumford had observed the frictional heat generated by boring cannon at the arsenal in Munich. Rumford immersed a cannon barrel in water and arranged for a specially blunted boring tool. He showed that the water could be boiled within roughly two and a half hours and that the supply of frictional heat was seemingly inexhaustible. Rumford confirmed that no physical change had taken place in the material of the cannon by comparing the specific heats of the material machined away and that remaining. Rumford argued that the seemingly indefinite generation of heat was incompatible with the caloric theory. He contended that the only thing communicated to the barrel was motion. Rumford made no attempt to further quantify the heat generated or to measure the mechanical equivalent of heat. Though this work met with a hostile reception, it was subsequently important in establishing the laws of conservation of energy later in the 19th century. Rumford's calorific and frigorific radiation He explained Pictet's experiment, which demonstrates the reflection of cold, by supposing that all bodies emit invisible rays, undulations in the ethereal fluid. He did experiments to support his theories of calorific and frigorific radiation and said the communication of heat was the net effect of calorific (hot) rays and frigorific (cold) rays and the rays emitted by the object. When an object absorbs radiation from a warmer object (calorific rays) its temperature rises, and when it absorbs radiation from a colder object (frigorific rays) its temperature falls. See note 8, \\"An enquiry concerning the nature of heat and the mode of its communication\\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, starting at page 112. Inventions and design improvements Section of Rumford fireplace Thompson was an active and prolific inventor, developing improvements for chimneys, fireplaces and industrial furnaces, as well as inventing the double boiler, a kitchen range, and a drip coffeepot. He invented a percolating coffee pot following his pioneering work with the Bavarian Army, where he improved the diet of the soldiers as well as their clothes. The Rumford fireplace created a sensation in London when he introduced the idea of restricting the chimney opening to increase the updraught, which was a much more efficient way to heat a room than earlier fireplaces. He and his workers modified fireplaces by inserting bricks into the hearth to make the side walls angled, and added a choke to the chimney to increase the speed of air going up the flue. The effect was to produce a streamlined air flow, so all the smoke would go up into the chimney rather than lingering, entering the room, and often choking the residents. It also had the effect of increasing the efficiency of the fire, and gave extra control of the rate of combustion of the fuel, whether wood or coal. Many fashionable London houses were modified to his instructions, and became smoke- free. Thompson became a celebrity when news of his success spread. His work was also very profitable, and much imitated when he published his analysis of the way chimneys worked. In many ways, he was similar to Benjamin Franklin, who also invented a new kind of heating stove. The retention of heat was a recurring theme in his work, as he is also credited with the invention of thermal underwear.Prof. Michael Fowler of the University of Virginia, lecture notes, and Have I Got News For You, first transmitted December 16, 2005, BBC1. =Industrial furnaces= Cross section of a Rumford furnace, with the fuel chamber at the left Thompson also significantly improved the design of kilns used to produce quicklime, and Rumford furnaces were soon being constructed throughout Europe. The key innovation involved separating the burning fuel from the limestone, so that the lime produced by the heat of the furnace was not contaminated by ash from the fire. Light and photometry Rumford worked in photometry, the measurement of light. He made a photometer and introduced the standard candle, the predecessor of the candela, as a unit of luminous intensity. His standard candle was made from the oil of a sperm whale, to rigid specifications. He also published studies of \\"illusory\\" or subjective complementary colours, induced by the shadows created by two lights, one white and one coloured; these observations were cited and generalized by Michel- Eug√®ne Chevreul as his \\"law of simultaneous colour contrast\\" in 1839. Later life Satirical cartoon by James Gillray showing a Royal Institution lecture on pneumatics with Davy holding the bellows and Count Rumford looking on at extreme right. Dr Garnett is the lecturer holding the victim's nose. After 1799, he divided his time between France and England. With Sir Joseph Banks, he established the Royal Institution of Great Britain in 1799. The pair chose Sir Humphry Davy as the first lecturer. The institution flourished and became world-famous as a result of Davy's pioneering research. His assistant, Michael Faraday, established the Institution as a premier research laboratory, and also justly famous for its series of public lectures popularizing science. That tradition continues to the present, and the Royal Institution Christmas lectures attract large audiences through their TV broadcasts. A bust of Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, in Rumford, Rhode Island. Thompson endowed the Rumford medals of the Royal Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and endowed a professorship at Harvard University. In 1803, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1804, he married Marie-Anne Lavoisier, the widow of the great French chemist Antoine Lavoisier, his American wife‚Äîthe one he abandoned in America upon the outbreak of the American Revolution‚Äîhaving died since his emigration. Thompson separated from his second wife after 3 years, but he settled in Paris and continued his scientific work until his death on August 21, 1814. Thompson is buried in the small cemetery of Auteuil in Paris, just across from Adrien- Marie Legendre. Upon his death, his daughter from his first marriage, Sarah Thompson, inherited his title as Countess Rumford.

It spread rapidly, infecting most of its 75,000 victims within ten minutes. The program exploited a buffer overflow bug in Microsoft's SQL Server and Desktop Engine database products. Although the MS02-039 patch had been released six months earlier, many organizations had not yet applied it. Technical details The worm was based on proof of concept code demonstrated at the Black Hat Briefings by David Litchfield, who had initially discovered the buffer overflow vulnerability that the worm exploited. It is a small piece of code that does little other than generate random IP addresses and send itself out to those addresses. If a selected address happens to belong to a host that is running an unpatched copy of Microsoft SQL Server Resolution Service listening on UDP port 1434, the host immediately becomes infected and begins spraying the Internet with more copies of the worm program. Home PCs are generally not vulnerable to this worm unless they have MSDE installed. The worm is so small that it does not contain code to write itself to disk, so it only stays in memory, and it is easy to remove. For example, Symantec provides a free removal utility (see external link below), or it can even be removed by restarting SQL Server (although the machine would likely be reinfected immediately). The worm was made possible by a software security vulnerability in SQL Server first reported by Microsoft on 24 July 2002. A patch had been available from Microsoft for six months prior to the worm's launch, but many installations had not been patched ‚Äì including many at Microsoft. The worm began to be noticed early on 25 January 2003 as it slowed systems worldwide. The slowdown was caused by the collapse of numerous routers under the burden of extremely high bombardment traffic from infected servers. Normally, when traffic is too high for routers to handle, the routers are supposed to delay or temporarily stop network traffic. Instead, some routers crashed (became unusable), and the \\"neighbour\\" routers would notice that these routers had stopped and should not be contacted (aka \\"removed from the routing table\\"). Routers started sending notices to this effect to other routers they knew about. The flood of routing table update notices caused some additional routers to fail, compounding the problem. Eventually the crashed routers' maintainers restarted them, causing them to announce their status, leading to another wave of routing table updates. Soon a significant portion of Internet bandwidth was consumed by routers communicating with each other to update their routing tables, and ordinary data traffic slowed or in some cases stopped altogether. Because the SQL Slammer worm was so small in size, sometimes it was able to get through when legitimate traffic was not. Two key aspects contributed to SQL Slammer's rapid propagation. The worm infected new hosts over the sessionless UDP protocol, and the entire worm (only 376 bytes) fits inside a single packet. As a result, each infected host could simply \\"fire and forget\\" packets as rapidly as possible.

In 1941, he wrote the final draft of the MAUD Report, which inspired the U.S. government to begin serious atomic bomb research efforts. He was the head of the British team that worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II. He was knighted in Britain in 1945 for his achievements in physics. Chadwick graduated from the Victoria University of Manchester in 1911, where he studied under Ernest Rutherford (known as the \\"father of nuclear physics\\"). At Manchester, he continued to study under Rutherford until he was awarded his MSc in 1913. The same year, Chadwick was awarded an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851. He elected to study beta radiation under Hans Geiger in Berlin. Using Geiger's recently developed Geiger counter, Chadwick was able to demonstrate that beta radiation produced a continuous spectrum, and not discrete lines as had been thought. Still in Germany when World War I broke out in Europe, he spent the next four years in the Ruhleben internment camp. After the war, Chadwick followed Rutherford to the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where Chadwick earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree under Rutherford's supervision from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in June 1921. He was Rutherford's assistant director of research at the Cavendish Laboratory for over a decade at a time when it was one of the world's foremost centres for the study of physics, attracting students like John Cockcroft, Norman Feather, and Mark Oliphant. Chadwick followed his discovery of the neutron by measuring its mass. He anticipated that neutrons would become a major weapon in the fight against cancer. Chadwick left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1935 to become a professor of physics at the University of Liverpool, where he overhauled an antiquated laboratory and, by installing a cyclotron, made it an important centre for the study of nuclear physics. During the Second World War, Chadwick carried out research as part of the Tube Alloys project to build an atomic bomb, while his Manchester lab and environs were harassed by Luftwaffe bombing. When the Quebec Agreement merged his project with the American Manhattan Project, he became part of the British Mission, and worked at the Los Alamos Laboratory and in Washington, D.C. He surprised everyone by earning the almost-complete trust of project director Leslie R. Groves, Jr. For his efforts, Chadwick received a knighthood in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1945. In July 1945, he viewed the Trinity nuclear test. After this, he served as the British scientific advisor to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. Uncomfortable with the trend toward Big Science, Chadwick became the Master of Gonville and Caius College in 1948. He retired in 1959.  Education and early life  James Chadwick was born in Bollington, Cheshire, on 20 October 1891, the first child of John Joseph Chadwick, a cotton spinner, and Anne Mary Knowles, a domestic servant. He was named James after his paternal grandfather. In 1895, his parents moved to Manchester, leaving him in the care of his maternal grandparents. He went to Bollington Cross Primary School, and was offered a scholarship to Manchester Grammar School, which his family had to turn down as they could not afford the small fees that still had to be paid. Instead he attended the Central Grammar School for Boys in Manchester, rejoining his parents there. He now had two younger brothers, Harry and Hubert; a sister had died in infancy. At the age of 16, he sat two examinations for university scholarships, and won both of them. Chadwick chose to attend Victoria University of Manchester, which he entered in 1908. He meant to study mathematics, but enrolled in physics by mistake. Like most students, he lived at home, walking the to the university and back each day. At the end of his first year, he was awarded a Heginbottom Scholarship to study physics. The physics department was headed by Ernest Rutherford, who assigned research projects to final-year students, and he instructed Chadwick to devise a means of comparing the amount of radioactive energy of two different sources. The idea was that they could be measured in terms of the activity of of radium, a unit of measurement which would become known as the curie. Rutherford's suggested approach was unworkable‚Äîsomething Chadwick knew but was afraid to tell Rutherford‚Äîso Chadwick pressed on, and eventually devised the required method. The results became Chadwick's first paper, which, co-authored with Rutherford, was published in 1912. He graduated with first class honours in 1911. Having devised a means of measuring gamma radiation, Chadwick proceeded to measure the absorption of gamma rays by various gases and liquids. This time the resulting paper was published under his name alone. He was awarded his Master of Science (MSc) degree in 1912, and was appointed a Beyer Fellow. The following year he was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship, which allowed him to study and research at a university in continental Europe. He elected to go to the Physikalisch- Technische Reichsanstalt in Berlin in 1913, to study beta radiation under Hans Geiger. Using Geiger's recently developed Geiger counter, which provided more accuracy than the earlier photographic techniques, he was able to demonstrate that beta radiation did not produce discrete lines, as has been previously thought, but rather a continuous spectrum with peaks in certain regions. On a visit to Geiger's laboratory, Albert Einstein told Chadwick that: \\"I can explain either of these things, but I can't explain them both at the same time.\\" The continuous spectrum would remain an unexplained phenomenon for many years. Chadwick was still in Germany at the start of the First World War, and was interned in the Ruhleben internment camp near Berlin, where he was allowed to set up a laboratory in the stables and conduct scientific experiments using improvised materials such as radioactive toothpaste. With the help of Charles Drummond Ellis, he worked on the ionisation of phosphorus, and the photochemical reaction of carbon monoxide and chlorine. He was released after the Armistice with Germany came into effect in November 1918, and returned to his parents' home in Manchester, where he wrote up his findings over the previous four years for the 1851 Exhibition commissioners. Rutherford gave Chadwick a part-time teaching position at Manchester, allowing him to continue research. He looked at the nuclear charge of platinum, silver, and copper, and experimentally found that this was the same as the atomic number within an error of less than 1.5 per cent. In April 1919, Rutherford became director of the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, and Chadwick joined him there a few months later. Chadwick was awarded a Clerk-Maxwell studentship in 1920, and enrolled as a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) student at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. The first half of his thesis was his work with atomic numbers. In the second, he looked at the forces inside the nucleus. His degree was awarded in June 1921. In November, he became a Fellow of Gonville and Caius College.  Researcher  = Cambridge = Chadwick's Clerk-Maxwell studentship expired in 1923, and he was succeeded by the Russian physicist Pyotr Kapitza. The Chairman of the Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Sir William McCormick arranged for Chadwick to become Rutherford's assistant director of research. In this role, Chadwick helped Rutherford select PhD students. Over the next few years these would include John Cockcroft, Norman Feather and Mark Oliphant, who would become firm friends with Chadwick. As many students had no idea what they wanted to research, Rutherford and Chadwick would suggest topics. Chadwick edited all the papers produced by the laboratory. Duke of Devonshire (Cavendish was his family name), and its first professor was James Clerk Maxwell. In 1925, Chadwick met Aileen Stewart-Brown, the daughter of a Liverpool stockbroker. The two were married in August 1925, with Kapitza as Best Man. The couple had twin daughters, Joanna and Judith, who were born in February 1927. In his research, Chadwick continued to probe the nucleus. In 1925, the concept of spin had allowed physicists to explain the Zeeman effect, but it also created unexplained anomalies. At the time it was believed that the nucleus consisted of protons and electrons, so nitrogen's nucleus, for example, with a mass number of 14, was assumed to contain 14 protons and 7 electrons. This gave it the right mass and charge, but the wrong spin. At a conference at Cambridge on beta particles and gamma rays in 1928, Chadwick met Geiger again. Geiger had brought with him a new model of his Geiger counter, which had been improved by his post-doctoral student Walther M√ºller. Chadwick had not used one since the war, and the new Geiger‚ÄìM√ºller counter was potentially a major improvement over the scintillation techniques then in use at Cambridge, which relied on the human eye for observation. The major drawback with it was that it detected alpha, beta and gamma radiation, and radium, which the Cavendish laboratory normally used in its experiments, emitted all three, and was therefore unsuitable for what Chadwick had in mind. However, polonium is an alpha emitter, and Lise Meitner sent Chadwick about 2 millicuries (about ) from Germany. In Germany, Walther Bothe and his student Herbert Becker had used polonium to bombard beryllium with alpha particles, producing an unusual form of radiation. Chadwick had his Australian 1851 Exhibition scholar, Hugh Webster, duplicate their results. To Chadwick, this was evidence of something that he and Rutherford had been hypothesising for years: the neutron, a theoretical nuclear particle with no electric charge. Then in January 1932, Feather drew Chadwick's attention to another surprising result. Fr√©d√©ric and Ir√®ne Joliot-Curie had succeeded in knocking protons from paraffin wax using polonium and beryllium as a source for what they thought was gamma radiation. Rutherford and Chadwick disagreed; protons were too heavy for that. But neutrons would need only a small amount of energy to achieve the same effect. In Rome, Ettore Majorana came to the same conclusion: the Joliot- Curies had discovered the neutron but did not know it. Sir Ernest Rutherford's laboratory Chadwick dropped all his other responsibilities to concentrate on proving the existence of the neutron, assisted by Feather and frequently working late at night. He devised a simple apparatus that consisted of a cylinder containing a polonium source and beryllium target. The resulting radiation could then be directed at a material such as paraffin wax; the displaced particles, which were protons, would go into a small ionisation chamber where they could be detected with an oscilloscope. In February 1932, after only about two weeks of experimentation with neutrons, Chadwick sent a letter to Nature titled \\"Possible Existence of a Neutron\\". He communicated his findings in detail in an article sent to Proceedings of the Royal Society A titled \\"The Existence of a Neutron\\" in May. His discovery of the neutron was a milestone in understanding the nucleus. Reading Chadwick's paper, Robert Bacher and Edward Condon realised that anomalies in the then-current theory, like the spin of nitrogen, would be resolved if the neutron has a spin of 1/2 and that a nitrogen nucleus consisted of seven protons and seven neutrons. The theoretical physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg considered whether the neutron could be a fundamental nuclear particle like the proton and electron, rather than a proton‚Äìelectron pair. Heisenberg showed that the neutron was best described as a new nuclear particle, but its exact nature remained unclear. In his 1933 Bakerian Lecture, Chadwick estimated that a neutron had a mass of about . Since a proton and an electron had a combined mass of , this implied the neutron as a proton‚Äìelectron composite had a binding energy of about , which sounded reasonable, although it was hard to understand how a particle with so little binding energy could be stable. Estimating such a small mass difference required challenging precise measurements, however, and several conflicting results were obtained in 1933‚Äì4. By bombarding boron with alpha particles, Fr√©d√©ric and Ir√®ne Joliot-Curie obtained a large value for the mass of a neutron, but Ernest Lawrence's team at the University of California produced a small one. Then Maurice Goldhaber, a refugee from Nazi Germany and a graduate student at the Cavendish Laboratory, suggested to Chadwick that deuterons could be photodisintegrated by the 2.6 MeV gamma rays of 208Tl (then known as thorium C\\"): :{ border=\\"0\\" - style=\\"height:2em;\\"  +  ‚Üí  +  } An accurate value for the mass of the neutron could be determined from this process. Chadwick and Goldhaber tried this and found that it worked. They measured the kinetic energy of the proton produced as 1.05 MeV, leaving the mass of the neutron as the unknown in the equation. Chadwick and Goldhaber calculated that it was either 1.0084 or 1.0090 atomic units, depending on the values used for the masses of the proton and deuteron. (The modern accepted value for the mass of the neutron is .) The mass of the neutron was too large to be a proton‚Äìelectron pair. For his discovery of the neutron, Chadwick was awarded the Hughes Medal by the Royal Society in 1932, the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935, the Copley Medal in 1950 and the Franklin Medal in 1951. His discovery of the neutron made it possible to produce elements heavier than uranium in the laboratory by the capture of slow neutrons followed by beta decay. Unlike the positively charged alpha particles, which are repelled by the electrical forces present in the nuclei of other atoms, neutrons do not need to overcome any Coulomb barrier, and can therefore penetrate and enter the nuclei of even the heaviest elements such as uranium. This inspired Enrico Fermi to investigate the nuclear reactions brought about by collisions of nuclei with slow neutrons, work for which Fermi would receive the Nobel Prize in 1938. Wolfgang Pauli proposed another kind of particle on 4 December 1930 in order to explain the continuous spectrum of beta radiation that Chadwick had reported in 1914. Since not all of the energy of beta radiation could be accounted for, the law of conservation of energy appeared to be violated, but Pauli argued that this could be redressed if another, undiscovered, particle was involved. Pauli also called this particle a neutron, but it was clearly not the same particle as Chadwick's neutron. Fermi renamed it the neutrino, Italian for \\"little neutron\\". In 1934, Fermi proposed his theory of beta decay which explained that the electrons emitted from the nucleus were created by the decay of a neutron into a proton, an electron, and a neutrino. The neutrino could account for the missing energy, but a particle with little mass and no electric charge was difficult to observe. Rudolf Peierls and Hans Bethe calculated that neutrinos could easily pass through the Earth, so the chances of detecting them were slim. Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan would confirm the neutrino on 14 June 1956 by placing a detector within a large antineutrino flux from a nearby nuclear reactor. = Liverpool = With the onset of the Great Depression in the United Kingdom, the government became more parsimonious with funding for science. At the same time, Lawrence's recent invention, the cyclotron, promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics, and Chadwick felt that the Cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one. He therefore chafed under Rutherford, who clung to the belief that good nuclear physics could still be done without large, expensive equipment, and turned down the request for a cyclotron. Red brick\\" Victoria Building at the University of Liverpool Chadwick was himself a critic of Big Science in general, and Lawrence in particular, whose approach he considered careless and focused on technology at the expense of science. When Lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the Solvay Conference in 1933, Chadwick responded that the results were more likely attributable to contamination of the equipment. While Lawrence rechecked his results at Berkeley only to find that Chadwick was correct, Rutherford and Oliphant conducted an investigation at the Cavendish that found that deuterium fuses to form helium-3, thereby causing the effect that the Lawrence had observed. This was another major discovery, but the Oliphant-Rutherford particle accelerator was an expensive state-of-the-art piece of equipment. In March 1935, Chadwick received an offer of the Lyon Jones Chair of physics at the University of Liverpool, in his wife's home town, to succeed Lionel Wilberforce. The laboratory was so antiquated that it still ran on direct current electricity, but Chadwick seized the opportunity, assuming the chair on 1 October 1935. The university's prestige was soon bolstered by Chadwick's Nobel Prize, which was announced in November 1935. His medal was sold at auction in 2014 for $329,000. Chadwick set about acquiring a cyclotron for Liverpool. He started by spending ¬£700 to refurbish the antiquated laboratories at Liverpool, so some components could be made in- house. He was able to persuade the university to provide ¬£2,000 and obtained a grant for another ¬£2,000 from the Royal Society. To build his cyclotron, Chadwick brought in two young experts, Bernard Kinsey and Harold Walke, who had worked with Lawrence at the University of California. A local cable manufacturer donated the copper conductor for the coils. The cyclotron's 50-ton magnet was manufactured in Trafford Park by Metropolitan-Vickers, which also made the vacuum chamber. The cyclotron was completely installed and running in July 1939. The total cost of ¬£5,184 was more than Chadwick had received from the University and the Royal Society, so Chadwick paid the rest from his (¬£8,243) Nobel Prize money. At Liverpool the Medicine and Science faculties worked together closely. Chadwick was automatically a committee member of both faculties, and in 1938 he was appointed to a commission headed by Lord Derby to investigate the arrangements for cancer treatment in Liverpool. Chadwick anticipated that neutrons and radioactive isotopes produced with the 37-inch cyclotron could be used to study biochemical processes, and might become a weapon in the fight against cancer.  Second World War  = Tube Alloys and the MAUD Report = In Germany, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann bombarded uranium with neutrons, and noted that barium, a lighter element, was among the products produced. Hitherto, only the same or heavier elements had been produced by the process. In January 1939, Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch astounded the physics community with a paper that explained this result. They theorised that uranium atoms bombarded with neutrons can break into two roughly equal fragments, a process they called fission. They calculated that this would result in the release of about 200 MeV, implying an energy release orders of magnitude greater than chemical reactions, and Frisch confirmed their theory experimentally. It was soon noted by Hahn that if neutrons were released during fission, then a chain reaction was possible. French scientists, Pierre Joliot, Hans von Halban and Lew Kowarski, soon verified that more than one neutron was indeed emitted per fission. In a paper co-authored with the American physicist John Wheeler, Bohr theorised that fission was more likely to occur in the uranium-235 isotope, which made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. Key British physicists. Left to right: William Penney, Otto Frisch, Rudolf Peierls and John Cockcroft. They are wearing the Medal of Freedom. Chadwick did not believe that there was any likelihood of another war with Germany in 1939, and took his family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern Sweden. The news of the outbreak of the Second World War therefore came as a shock. Determined not to spend another war in an internment camp, Chadwick made his way to Stockholm as fast as he could, but when he arrived there with his family, he found that all air traffic between Stockholm and London had been suspended. They made their way back to England on a tramp steamer. When he reached Liverpool, Chadwick found Joseph Rotblat, a Polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron, was now destitute, as he was cut off from funds from Poland. Chadwick promptly hired Rotblat as a lecturer, despite his poor grasp of English. In October 1939, Chadwick received a letter from Sir Edward Appleton, the Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, asking for his opinion on the feasibility of an atomic bomb. Chadwick responded cautiously. He did not dismiss the possibility, but carefully went over the many theoretical and practical difficulties involved. Chadwick decided to investigate the properties of uranium oxide further with Rotblat. In March 1940, Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls at the University of Birmingham re- examined the theoretical issues involved in a paper that became known as the Frisch‚ÄìPeierls memorandum. Instead of looking at unenriched uranium oxide, they considered what would happen to a sphere of pure uranium-235, and found that not only could a chain reaction occur, but that it might require as little as of uranium-235, and unleash the energy of tons of dynamite. Blitz A special subcommittee of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare (CSSAW), known as the MAUD Committee, was created to investigate the matter further. It was chaired by Sir George Thomson and its original membership included Chadwick, along with Mark Oliphant, John Cockcroft and Philip Moon. While other teams investigated uranium enrichment techniques, Chadwick's team at Liverpool concentrated on determining the nuclear cross section of uranium-235. By April 1941, it had been experimentally confirmed that the critical mass of uranium-235 might be or less. His research into such matters was complicated by all-but-incessant Luftwaffe bombings of the environs of his Liverpool lab; the windows were blown out so often that they were replaced by cardboard. In July 1941, Chadwick was chosen to write the final draft of the MAUD Report, which, when presented by Vannevar Bush to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in October 1941, inspired the U.S. government to pour millions of dollars into the pursuit of an atomic bomb. When George B. Pegram and Harold Urey visited Britain to see how the project, now known as Tube Alloys, was going, Chadwick was able to tell them: \\"I wish I could tell you that the bomb is not going to work, but I am 90 per cent sure that it will.\\" In a recent book about the Bomb project, Graham Farmelo wrote that \\"Chadwick did more than any other scientist to give Churchill the Bomb. ... Chadwick was tested almost to the breaking point.\\" So worried that he could not sleep, Chadwick resorted to sleeping pills, which he continued to take for most of his remaining years. Chadwick later said that he realised that \\"a nuclear bomb was not only possible‚Äîit was inevitable. Sooner or later these ideas could not be peculiar to us. Everybody would think about them before long, and some country would put them into action\\". Sir Hermann Bondi suggested that it was fortunate that Chadwick, not Rutherford, was the doyen of UK physics at the time, as the latter's prestige might otherwise have overpowered Chadwick's interest in \\"looking forward\\" to the Bomb's prospects. = Manhattan Project = Mackenzie King, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill at the first Quebec Conference in 1943 Owing to the danger from aerial bombardment, the Chadwicks sent their twins to Canada as part of a government evacuation scheme. Chadwick was reluctant to move Tube Alloys there, believing that the United Kingdom was a better location for the isotope separation plant. The enormous scope of the effort became more apparent in 1942: even a pilot separation plant would cost over ¬£1 million and strain Britain's resources, to say nothing of a full-scale plant, which was estimated to cost somewhere in the vicinity of ¬£25 million. It would have to be built in America. At the same time that the British became convinced that a joint project was necessary, the progress of the American Manhattan Project was such that British cooperation seemed less essential, although the Americans were still eager to utilise Chadwick's talents. The matter of cooperation had to be taken up at the highest level. In September 1943, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and President Roosevelt negotiated the Quebec Agreement, which reinstated cooperation between Britain, the United States and Canada. Chadwick, Oliphant, Peierls and Simon were summoned to the United States by the director of Tube Alloys, Sir Wallace Akers, to work with the Manhattan Project. The Quebec Agreement established a new Combined Policy Committee to direct the joint project. The Americans disliked Akers, so Chadwick was appointed technical advisor to the Combined Policy Committee, and the head of the British Mission. Leaving Rotblat in charge in Liverpool, Chadwick began a tour of the Manhattan Project facilities in November 1943, except for the Hanford Site where plutonium was produced, which he was not allowed to see. He became the only man apart from Groves and his second in command to have access to all the American research and production facilities for the uranium bomb. Observing the work on the K-25 gaseous diffusion facility at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, Chadwick realised how wrong he had been about building the plant in wartime Britain. The enormous structure could never have been concealed from the Luftwaffe. In early 1944, he moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico, with his wife and their twins, who now spoke with Canadian accents. For security reasons, he was given the cover name of James Chaffee. Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the Manhattan Project Chadwick accepted that the Americans did not need British help, but that it could still be useful in bringing the project to an early and successful conclusion. Working closely with the director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., he attempted to do everything he could to support the effort. He also endeavoured to place British scientists in as many parts of the project as possible in order to facilitate a post-war British nuclear weapons project to which Chadwick was committed. Requests from Groves via Chadwick for particular scientists tended to be met with an immediate rejection by the company, ministry or university currently employing them, only to be overcome by the overriding priority accorded to Tube Alloys. As a result, the British team was critical to the Project's success. Although he had more knowledge of the project than anyone else from Britain, Chadwick had no access to the Hanford site. Lord Portal was offered a tour of Hanford in 1946. \\"This was the only plant to which Chadwick had been denied access in wartime, and now he asked Groves if he could accompany Portal. Groves replied that he could, but if he did then 'Portal will not see very much'.\\" For his efforts, Chadwick received a knighthood in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1945. Knight Bachelor He considered this to be a recognition of the work of the whole Tube Alloys project. By early 1945, Chadwick was spending most of his time in Washington, D.C., and his family relocated from Los Alamos to a house on Washington's Dupont Circle in April 1945. He was present at the meeting of the Combined Policy Committee on 4 July when Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson gave Britain's agreement to use the atomic bomb against Japan, and at the Trinity nuclear test on 16 July, when the first atomic bomb was detonated. Inside its pit was a polonium-beryllium modulated neutron initiator, a development of the technique that Chadwick had used to discover the neutron over a decade before. William L. Laurence, the New York Times reporter attached to the Manhattan Project, wrote that \\"never before in history had any man lived to see his own discovery materialize itself with such telling effect on the destiny of man.\\"  Later life  Shortly after the war ended, Chadwick was appointed to the Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy (ACAE). He was also appointed as the British scientific advisor to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. He clashed with fellow ACAE member Patrick Blackett, who disagreed with Chadwick's conviction that Britain needed to acquire its own nuclear weapons; but it was Chadwick's position that was ultimately adopted. He returned to Britain in 1946, to find a country still beset by wartime rationing and shortages. At this time, Sir James Mountford, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Liverpool, wrote in his diary \\"he had never seen a man 'so physically, mentally and spiritually tired\\" as Chadwick, for he \\"had plumbed such depths of moral decision as more fortunate men are never called upon even to peer into ... [and suffered] ... almost insupportable agonies of responsibility arising from his scientific work'.\\" In 1948, Chadwick accepted an offer to become the Master of Gonville and Caius College. The job was prestigious but ill-defined; the Master was the titular head of the College, but authority actually resided in a council of 13 fellows, of whom one was the Master. As Master, Chadwick strove to improve the academic reputation of the college. He increased the number of research fellowships from 31 to 49, and sought to bring talent into the college. This involved controversial decisions, such as hiring in 1951 the Chinese biochemist Tien-chin Tsao and the Hungarian-born economist Peter Bauer. In what became known as the Peasants' Revolt, fellows led by Patrick Hadley voted an old friend of Chadwick's off the council and replaced him with Bauer. More friends of Chadwick's were removed over the following years, and he retired in November 1958. It was during his mastership that Francis Crick, a PhD student at Gonville and Caius College, and James Watson discovered the structure of DNA. Over the years, Chadwick received many honours, including the Medal for Merit from the United States, and the Pour le M√©rite from Germany. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1927, and in 1946 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was made a Companion of Honour in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1970 for \\"services to science\\", Companion of Honour and went to Buckingham Palace for the investiture ceremony. He became more frail, and seldom left his flat, although he travelled to Liverpool for celebrations of his eightieth birthday. A lifelong atheist, he saw no reason to adopt religious faith in later life. He died in his sleep on 24 July 1974. His papers are held at the Churchill Archives Centre in Cambridge, and are accessible to the public. The Chadwick Laboratory at the University of Liverpool is named after him, as is its Sir James Chadwick Chair of Experimental Physics, which was named after him in 1991 as part of celebrations of the centenary of his birth. A crater on the moon is also named after him. The James Chadwick Building, which houses part of the School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Sciences, University of Manchester is named in his honour. He was described by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority official historian Lorna Arnold as \\"a physicist, a scientist-diplomat, and a good, wise, and humane man.\\"  Notes   References             *  Further reading   External links * 1891 births 1974 deaths 20th-century British physicists Academics of the Victoria University of Manchester Alumni of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge Alumni of the Victoria University of Manchester English atheists English nuclear physicists English physicists English Nobel laureates Experimental physicists Fellows of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge Fellows of the Royal Society Knights Bachelor Manhattan Project people Masters of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge Medal for Merit recipients Members of the Order of the Companions of Honour Members of the Royal Academy of Belgium Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences Nobel laureates in Physics Recipients of the Copley Medal Recipients of the Medal of Freedom Recipients of the Pour le M√©rite (civil class) Academics of the University of Liverpool People from Bollington World War I civilian detainees held by Germany People associated with the nuclear weapons programme of the United Kingdom 20th-century physicists People from Dupont Circle ","title":"James Chadwick"},{"id":"174317","text":"Antonio Junius \\"Tony\\" Jackson (October 25, 1882 - April 20, 1921) was an American pianist, singer, and composer.

While some sources claim birth dates back to 1876, and a June 5 date, this was likely an error made by his sister Louvina in a later interview, when she appears to have quoted her own birth information.

An image of this document is available on the Dr. Jazz website at http://www.doctorjazz.co.uk/tjjdraftf.jpg His parents were freed slaves. Jackson was epileptic from birth. Tony showed musical talents at a young age. At about the age of 10 he reportedly constructed a type of crude but working and properly tuned harpsichord out of junk in his back yard, since his family lacked the money to buy or rent a piano. On this contraption young Tony was able to reproduce hymns he heard in church; news of this accomplishment soon spread around the neighborhood and he was offered use of neighbors' pianos and reed organs to practice on. Jackson got his first musical job at age 13, when he began playing piano during off hours at a Tonk run by bandleader Adam Olivier. By age 15 was already considered by many musicians the best pianist in town. Career Jackson became the most popular and sought after entertainer in Storyville. He was said to be able to remember and play any tune he had heard once, and was hardly ever stumped by obscure requests. His repertory included ragtime, cakewalks (one of his show stopping tricks was to dance a high kicking cakewalk while playing the piano), popular songs of the day from the United States and various nations of Europe and Latin America, blues, and light classics. He was also \\"openly, almost defiantly homosexual.\\" After hours, he would go with friends to The Frenchman's saloon, which catered to musicians and cross-dressers. His singing voice was also exceptional, and he was said to be able to sing operatic parts from baritone to soprano range. Fellow musicians and singers were universal in their praise of Jackson, most calling him \\"the greatest\\", and even the far- from-modest Jelly Roll Morton ranked Jackson as the only musician better than Morton himself. Morton met Jackson in 1906. Jackson became a mentor to Morton. Jackson also wrote many original tunes, a number of which he sold rights to for a few dollars or were simply stolen from him; some of the old time New Orleans musicians said that some well known Tin Pan Alley pop tunes of the era were actually written by Jackson. Clarence Williams noted \\"He was great because he was original in all his improvisations . . . We all copied him.\\" More than Jackson's music was copied: he was always well dressed. Jackson dressed himself with a pearl gray derby, checkered vest, ascot tie with a diamond stickpin, with sleeve garters on his arms to hold up his cuffs as he played. This became a standard outfit for ragtime and barrelhouse pianists; as one commented \\"If you can't play like Tony Jackson, at least you can look like him\\".Rose, Al (1978) Storyville, New Orleans: Being an Authentic, Illustrated Account of the Notorious Red Light District, University of Alabama Press. Later career and death Jackson moved to Chicago hoping to have more of an influence on his career . He was also looking for more freedom in his personal life, since being gay was difficult in New Orleans. He lived in an apartment on Wabash Avenue with several members of his family and later they all moved to South State Street. One of the few tunes published with Jackson's name on it, \\"Pretty Baby\\" came out in 1916, although he was remembered performing the song before he left New Orleans and may have written it in 1911. The original lyrics of \\"Pretty Baby\\" were said to refer to his male lover of the time. The song inspired the 1978 eponymous film by Louis Malle. Jackson was resident performer at the De Luxe and Pekin Cafes in Chicago, although in his later years his voice and dexterity were impaired by disease. Although it has been cited by some as syphilis, the diagnosis at the time of his death was the more likely cirrhosis of the liver which had been progressing for years, in addition to chronic epilepsy.Chicago, Illinois, death records as available on FamilySearch.com His friends knew that his health was suffering and they held a benefit for him on February 17, 1921, calling it the \\"All Star Tony Jackson Testimonial\\" and raising $325 for Jackson. He died in Chicago on April 20, 1921.Carr, Ian, et al. (2004). The Rough Guide to Jazz, p. 396. Rough Guides. . Jackson's piano rolls can still be heard today and portions of his style are no doubt found in the recordings of younger musicians he influenced, like Jelly Roll Morton, Clarence Williams, and Steve Lewis. In 2011 the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame inducted Jackson into the hall. Jackson was honored for his musical contributions and for living \\"as an openly gay man when that was rare\\".  Fictional portrayals  The play Don't You Leave Me Here by Clare Brown, which premiered at West Yorkshire Playhouse in September 2008, deals with his relationship with Jelly Roll Morton.

It designs and builds light, medium and heavy commercial vehicles, quarry/construction site vehicles, city and intercity busses and special vehicles for applications such as firefighting, off-road missions, the military and civil defence. The name Iveco first appeared in 1975 after a merger of Italian, French and German brands.Bonfiglioli Consulting: Il Lean Thinking dalla produzione alla progettazione.

The worldwide output of the company amounts to around 150,000 commercial vehicles with a turnover of about . History IVECO was incorporated on 1 January 1975, with the merger of five different brands: FIAT Veicoli Industriali (with headquarters in Turin), OM (Brescia, Italy), Lancia Veicoli Speciali (Italy), Unic (France) and Magirus-Deutz (Germany). Following the merger, the newly founded Iveco began rationalizing its product range, manufacturing plants and sales network, while keeping the original brands. From 1975 to 1979, the Iveco range included 200 basic models and 600 versions spanning from 2.7 tons of GVW for a light vehicle to over 40 tons for heavy vehicles, as well as buses and engines. In 1977 the light to medium-weight Iveco Zeta range was introduced, replacing the twenty-year-old OM Lupetto. Integrating the FIAT-OM range with the Unic and Magirus lineups was completed by 1980. IVECO moved in to work on increasing productivity and engine development. In 1978 IVECO launched the first product in the range of Iveco-branded light vehicles, the Daily. In 1980 Iveco built a turbo diesel engine for heavy industrial vehicles.Condolo, pp. 28‚Äì29 In this decade the corporate strategy was heavily oriented towards brand promotion and led to the sponsorship of sports events, such as the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, the Davis Cup in 1982, multiple championship boxing matches, the Jacques Cousteau expeditions in the Amazon basin in 1983 and the Raid Pigafetta, during which the IVECO-FIAT 75 PC 4x4 was first to make a full circle of the globe.Sanguineti & Zampini Salazar, pp. 188-193 Two new divisions were also formed: bus diesel engines and firefighting vehicles.Sanguineti & Zampini Salazar, ppp. 204 In 1984 IVECO launched the TurboStar,John Carroll, Peter James Davies: Tractor & Trucks, 2007 Hermes House ‚Äì p. 7 a heavy on-road vehicle that became a best-seller in Italy and also successful in the European market, selling a total of 50,000 in seven years.Sanguineti & Zampini Salazar, pp. 202 In 1985 IVECO made the first light diesel engine with direct injection.

Ford plants took over production and sales of the major vehicles in the Iveco range and continued production of the Ford Cargo.John Carroll, Peter James Davies: The Complete Book of Tractor & Trucks, 2000 Lorenz Books ‚Äì p. 408 In the mid-1980s, Astra, which produces dumpers and construction site/quarry vehicles in Piacenza, became part of Iveco Group.Condolo, p. 11 In 1989 the first diesel engine with EGR to reduce polluting emissions compatible with commercial vehicles was produced and the new Daily launched that same year was fitted with it. In 1990, the group purchased 60% control of the Spanish industrial company ENASA, which owned the industrial vehicle builder Pegaso. In the 1990s, the EuroCargo, EuroTech, EuroTrakker and EuroStar vehicles represented a total facelift for the range. The EuroCargo and the EuroTech were named \\"Truck of the Year\\" in 1992 and 1993 respectively and, for the first time, this recognition was awarded to the same manufacturer for two years in a row.Condolo, pp. 146‚Äì147 The English company Seddon Atkinson was purchased in 1991 and brought its long heritage of special vehicles for the construction and refuse collection industries.Condolo, p. 10 That same year, the first TurboDaily assembly line was inaugurated at the Nanjing Motor Corporation in China.Sanguineti & Zampini Salazar, pp. 230 In 1991 Iveco announced that they were withdrawing from the North American market at the end of the calendar year; they had been selling the mid-range Iveco Euro there since 1978. In 1992, Iveco took over the primary constructor of industrial vehicles in Australia to form Ital, originally called International Trucks Australia.Iveco acqures Internatonal Aust Truck & Bus Transportation June 1992 page 9 In 2000 it was renamed Iveco Trucks Australia Limited. In 1996 firefighting activities in Germany were structured under the company Iveco Magirus Brandschutztechnik GmbH. The following year, these activities were boosted by the arrival of an Austrian company, L√∂hr, which then became L√∂hr Magirus. In 1998 Cursor 8 was launched, followed the next year by Cursor 10, the first diesel engine with a variable geometry turbine and the first common rail diesel engine for heavy industrial vehicles. The 125th anniversary of the presentation of the first Magirus ladderJohn Carroll, Peter James Davies: The Complete Book of Tractor & Trucks, 2000 Lorenz Books ‚Äì p. 430 was celebrated together with the delivery of the five-thousandth Magirus aerial ladder produced since the Second World War. In 2003 IVECO entirely bought out Irisbus, originally part of a joint venture with Renault. In 2004 the Iveco Motors brand was born, which became an umbrella for the production of engines, and the following year it was incorporated into the newly founded Fiat Powertrain Technologies. At the end of 2004, an agreement was reached between IVECO and the Chinese company SAIC (Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation). In 2006 IVECO sponsored the Winter Olympic Games in Turin with a fleet of 1,200 Irisbus buses. The year after, IVECO became sponsor of the All Blacks, New Zealand's rugby team. In 2009 Iveco became the trucks and commercial Vehicle supplier for the Moto GP, together with the historical sponsorship to the Ferrari Racing Team, for which it supplies the vehicles that transport the single-seaters at all the Formula 1 World Championship races. On 1 January 2011, Fiat Industrial was formed, incorporating CNH, Iveco and FPT Industrial. In September of the same year, the Fiat Industrial Village was inaugurated in Turin, a multipurpose centre belonging to Fiat Industrial and created for the sales, assistance and product presentation for the Iveco, New Holland and FPT Industrial brands. On 15 January 2012, Iveco won the 33rd edition of the Dakar rally with the Petronas De Rooy team and the Dutch driver Gerard De Rooy, behind the wheel of an Iveco Powerstar. De Rooy was followed by drivers Stacey and Biasion behind the wheel of two Iveco Trakker Evolution 2 vehicles, equipped with an FPT Industrial C13 engine with over 900 hp. Brands =Iveco trucks= Iveco is the brand under which the light, medium and heavy vehicles are sold. The range of light vehicles is made up of the New Daily in its versions from 2.8t to 6t and with 4x4 drive. The range of medium vehicles includes the EuroCargo, available from 6.5t to 18t and with 4x2 or 4x4 drive. Stralis and Trakker, from 19t to 72t, make up the heavy vehicle range in two, three, or four-axled versions with all-wheel drive or two-wheel drive.

On May 24, 2013, the brand was relaunched as Iveco Bus. =Heuliez Bus= Heuliez Bus is a French limited company, it was part of the Henri Heuliez Group. It was formed in 1980. It is wholly owned by IVECO through its subsidiary Iveco Bus, and specializes in the manufacture of buses and coaches. =Iveco Astra= Iveco Astra is a brand dedicated to off- road vehicles for construction and mining industry. It produces heavy on-road and off-road vehicles as well as heavy tractors for road transport and logistics vehicles, including armoured vehicles for the military. The company was founded in 1946, but has been part of Iveco since 1986. =Iveco Magirus= Iveco Magirus is the brand dedicated to firefighting vehicles and their fittings. Iveco Magirus also produces aerial ladders, an industry in which it is the world leader. It was founded in 1866 as \\"Magirus Kommanditist\\" by Conrad Dietrich Magirus, fire chief in Ulm, Germany, who also invented the ladders for the firefighting vehicles. =Defence Vehicles= Defence Vehicles specialises in military vehicles. Its headquarters are located in Bolzano, where the Iveco LMV is produced, one of the brand's most famous vehicles used by many armies in Europe and abroad. =Iveco Capital= Iveco Capital is Iveco's financial division which provides financing for customers to purchase vehicles. =Joint ventures= * Naveco, specialises in light and medium vehicles * SAIC Iveco Hongyan (SIH), specialised in heavy vehicles * Saic- Iveco FPT Hongyan (SFH), specialised in engines for heavy vehicles Facilities =Vehicles= * Suzzara (Lombardy, Italy), main production of the Iveco Daily * Brescia (Lombardy, Italy), former Officine Meccaniche, production of the Iveco Eurocargo * Madrid (Spain, production of the Iveco Stralis and Iveco Trakker * Valladolid (Spain), secondary production of the Iveco Daily * Ulm (Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany), production of fire engines, Iveco Magirus * Bolzano (Trentino-Alto Adige, Italy), main production of the Iveco LMV military vehicle; * Vittorio Veneto (Veneto, Italy), secondary production of military vehicles; * \\"Le Mose\\", Piacenza (Emilia-Romagna, Italy), production of Astra off-road vehicles * Iveco-AMT (Iveco- Automobile/Miass/Torino, Miass, Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia), former joint venture Iveco-UralAZ, production of Iveco Trakker (included all-terrain version), Iveco Stralis, fire engines * Sete Lagoas (Minas Gerais, Brazil), production of Iveco Daily, Iveco Vertis, Iveco CityClass minibus; * C√≥rdoba, Argentina, production of Iveco Daily (1993‚Äì1997), Iveco Cursor, Iveco Tector, Iveco Trakker, Iveco Stralis. * Dandenong, Victoria (Australia), former International Harvester/Navistar International Australia, production of Iveco ACCO, Iveco PowerStar, Iveco Stralis * Gwangsan District, Gwangju (South Korea), opened in 2015 production on Iveco Trakker, Iveco Stralis, Iveco Eurocargo For Iveco Bus (former Irisbus) facilities see Iveco Bus Joint ventures * Naveco, (Nanjing, China), production trucks by Naveco brand * SAIC-Iveco Hongyan, (Chongqing, China), production trucks by Hongyan brand =Engines= * \\"Sofim\\", Foggia (Apulia, southern Italy), main plant Iveco Motors engine production of 8100 e HPI series (S series) * \\"Comprensorio SPA\\", Turin (Piedmont, northern Italy), production of engine Vector (V), Tector-NEF (N) and FSC (F) * \\"8000\\", Turin (Piedmont), production of motors and generators series 8000 * Pregnana Milanese (Lombardy, Italy), production of industrial and marine engines (S, N e C) Financials In 2011 IVECO's net revenues were , a 15.1% increase over the previous year. The trading profit was . A total of 153,384 vehicles were delivered, an 18.3% increase over 2010. Emissions and alternative fuels =Euro VI engines with SCR technology= Iveco engines from the Cursor and Tector ranges observe the Euro VI standards by adopting High Efficiency SCR (HI-eSCR) technology. This technology optimises the processes of exhaust combustion and after-treatment, reducing consumption and enabling achievement of greater efficiency in the conversion of NOx emissions. =Electric drive= IVECO developed and built the first Daily with electric propulsion in 1986;Raffaele Sanguineti, Carlo Felice Zampini Salazar: IVECO Story. The world of Transport, 1994 Norden Publishing House Ltd. ‚Äì p. 330 Later, the range was broadened to include trucks and city buses.International Energy Agency, Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development: Hydrogen and Fuel Cells, 2004 OECD Publishing ‚Äì p. 143 IVECO introduced the New Daily with electric propulsion and zero exhaust emissions, in which a battery system powers an electric three-phase asynchronous motor ‚Äì through the aid of an inverter ‚Äì in charge of moving the vehicle directly, while recovering energy during braking. The vehicle runs on two to four batteries made with Na/NiCl2 (Sodium-nickel chlorine) technology at a nominal 278 Volts. The maximum velocity is electronically limited to 70km/h, while the vehicle's range is from 90 to 130km on a fully charged battery, depending on the number of batteries and the mission. =Diesel-electric parallel hybrid traction= The parallel hybrid solution incorporates both a Diesel engine and an electric engine that can be used individually or simultaneously, which makes for greater operating flexibility and allows the vehicle to work under both urban and non-urban conditions. In 2010 IVECO introduced this technology on the Eurocargo Ibrido, a commercial vehicle for the European market with electri-diesel parallel propulsion for distributing and collecting goods in city centres. The payload capacity decreases by 200kg in comparison to diesel- engine models, but it is possible to save up to 30% on the urban cycle. The Eurocargo hybrid range is made up of two versions: # the 7.5-ton version uses a Tector Diesel FPT Industrial engine with 16 valves and 4 Euro V cylinders, with a maximum power of 160hp (118 kW); this is paired with a drive system made of an electric motor-generator with 60hp (44kW), a 6-speed automated gearbox and a lithium ion battery pack (Li-Ion) of rated capacity 1.8kWh. # The 12-ton version uses the FPT Industrial Tector engine with 16 valves and 4 EEV cylinders with a maximum power of 180hp (132kW), paired with an electric motor-generator with 60hp (44kW), a 6-speed automated gear box and a lithium ion battery pack (Li-Ion) of rated capacity 1.8kWh. =Diesel-electric hybrid= IVECO has been active in this sector since 1990 with 6, 7, 4 and 12 metre buses for urban and suburban transportation. The series hybrid technology features a diesel engine ‚Äì smaller than that of a traditional vehicle ‚Äì that acts as a battery charger.Sanguineti & Zampini Salazar, pp. 216-217 =CNG ‚Äì compressed natural gas= IVECO's range of light, medium and heavy vehicles and buses can run on methane. Methane makes it possible to save on consumption by 38% per kg transported as compared to that consumed by diesel engines for the same payload and distance travelled. In addition, compared to EuroVI diesel engines, methane engines reduce NOx emissions by approximately 60% and particulates emissions by approximately 70%.Oecd: Can Cars come clean? Strategies for low emission vehicles?, 2004 OECD Publishing ‚Äì p. 166 =LNG ‚Äì liquefied natural gas= In April 2012 IVECO presented its first vehicle with this technology, the Stralis LNG. As opposed to vehicles with CNG technology, LNG technology takes the vehicle farther on a full tank (up to 750km) and reduces the vehicle's tare thus increasing the load. The main difference between the two technologies lies in the type of natural gas storage employed, which in this case is kept in a liquid state at ‚àí161¬∞C in cryogenic tanks; it is then heated in a heat exchanger so that once it reaches the engine it is a gas. Also, the noise emitted decreases by 3 to 6 decibels over an analogous diesel engine vehicle. =Iveco Trakker Bifuel ‚Äì diesel- ethanol prototype= IVECO created the first prototype of a bifuel, diesel and ethanol-run vehicle. The technology was developed by Iveco together with FPT Industrial and Bosch. The prototype uses a Trakker truck with Common Rail Cursor9 engine with 360HP that may be powered by a 40‚Äì60% ethanol-diesel blend. The prototype was tested by Ra√≠zen, a joint venture between the cane sugar producer Cosan and Shell. In 2011, this prototype earned Iveco the \\"Pr√™mio Top Etanol\\" ‚Äì for the alternative fuel technology. =Heating and air- conditioning systems= A prototype of a heat pump system for electric and hybrid vehicles was installed on the Iveco Daily vehicle. The system cools or heats the passenger compartment by transferring low temperature heat generated by the drive systems. At the same time, the control strategies minimise the energy demand in order to achieve a low impact on consumption.

Phrases with similar meanings include: \\"give and take\\", \\"tit for tat\\", \\"you scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours\\", and \\"one hand washes the other\\". Other languages use other phrases for the same purpose.  Origins  The Latin phrase quid pro quo originally implied that something had been substituted, as in this instead of that. Early usage by English speakers followed the original Latin meaning, with occurrences in the 1530s where the term referred to substituting one medicine for another, whether unintentionally or fraudulently. By the end of the same century, quid pro quo evolved into a more current use to describe equivalent exchanges. In 1654, the expression quid pro quo was used to generally refer to something done for personal gain or with the expectation of reciprocity in the text The Reign of King Charles: An History Disposed into Annalls, with a somewhat positive connotation. It refers to the covenant with Christ as something \\"that prove not a nudum pactum, a naked contract, without quid pro quo.\\" Believers in Christ have to do their part in return, namely \\"foresake the devil and all his works\\". Quid pro quo would go on to be used, by English speakers in legal and diplomatic contexts, as an exchange of equally valued goods or services and continues to be today. The Latin phrase corresponding to the usage of quid pro quo in English is do ut des (Latin for \\"I give, so that you may give\\"). Other languages continue to use do ut des for this purpose, while quid pro quo (or its equivalent qui pro quo, as widely used in Italian, French and Spanish) still keeps its original meaning of something being unwillingly mistaken, or erroneously told or understood, instead of something else.  Legal meanings  = Common law = In common law, quid pro quo indicates that an item or a service has been traded in return for something of value, usually when the propriety or equity of the transaction is in question. A contract must involve consideration: that is, the exchange of something of value for something else of value. For example, when buying an item of clothing or a gallon of milk, a pre-determined amount of money is exchanged for the product the customer is purchasing; therefore, they have received something but have given up something of equal value in return. = United Kingdom = In the United Kingdom, the one- sidedness of a contract is covered by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and various revisions and amendments to it; a clause can be held void or the entire contract void if it is deemed unfair (that is to say, one-sided and not a quid pro quo); however this is a civil law and not a common law matter. Political donors must be resident in the UK. There are fixed limits to how much they may donate (¬£5000 in any single donation), and it must be recorded in the House of Commons Register of Members' Interests or at the House of Commons Library; the quid pro quo is strictly not allowed, that a donor can by his donation have some personal gain. This is overseen by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. There are also prohibitions on donations being given in the six weeks before the election for which it is being campaigned. It is also illegal for donors to support party political broadcasts, which are tightly regulated, free to air, and scheduled and allotted to the various parties according to a formula agreed by Parliament and enacted with the Communications Act 2003. = United States = In the United States, if the exchange appears excessively one sided, courts in some jurisdictions may question whether a quid pro quo did actually exist and the contract may be held void. In cases of \\"Quid Pro Quo\\" business contracts, the term takes on a negative connotation because major corporations may cross ethical boundaries in order to enter into these very valuable, mutually beneficial, agreements with other major big businesses. In these deals, large sums of money are often at play and can consequently lead to promises of exclusive partnerships indefinitely or promises of distortion of economic reports, for example.For example, In the U.S., lobbyists are legally entitled to support candidates that hold positions with which the donors agree, or which will benefit the donors. Such conduct becomes bribery only when there is an identifiable exchange between the contribution and official acts, previous or subsequent, and the term quid pro quo denotes such an exchange.  Sexual harassment  In United States labor law, workplace sexual harassment can take two forms; either \\"Quid pro quo\\" harassment or hostile work environment harassment. \\"Quid pro quo\\" harassment takes place when a supervisor requires sex, sexual favors, or sexual contact from an employee/job candidate as a condition of their employment. Only supervisors who have the authority to make tangible employment actions (i.e. hire, fire, promote, etc.), can commit \\"Quid pro quo\\" harassment. The supervising harasser must have \\"immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee.‚Äù The power dynamic between a supervisor and subordinate/job candidate is such that a supervisor could use their position of authority to extract sexual relations based on the subordinate/job candidate's need for employment. Co-workers and non-decision making supervisors cannot engage in \\"Quid pro quo\\" harassment with other employees, but an employer could potentially be liable for the behavior of these employees under a hostile work environment claim. The harassing employee's status as a supervisor is significant because if the individual is found to be a supervisor then the employing company can be held vicariously liable for the actions of that supervisor. Under Agency law, the employer is held responsible for the actions of the supervisor because they were in a position of power within the company at the time of the harassment. To establish a prima facie case of \\"Quid pro quo\\" harassment, the plaintiff must prove that they were subjected to \\"unwelcome sexual conduct\\", that submission to such conduct was explicitly or implicitly a term of their employment, and submission to or rejection of this conduct was used as a basis for an employment decision, as follows: * Unwelcome Sexual Conduct: A court will look at the employee's conduct to determine whether the supervisor's sexual advances were unwelcome. In Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, the Court opined that voluntary sex between an employee and supervisor does not establish proof that a supervisor's sexual advances were welcome. The Court also stated that evidence of the subordinate employee's provocative dress and publicly expressed sexual fantasies can be introduced as evidence if relevant. * Term of Employment: A term or condition of employment means that the subordinate/job candidate must acquiesce to the sexual advances of the supervisor in order to maintain/be hired for the job. In essence, the sexual harassment becomes a part of their job. For example, a supervisor promises an employee a raise if she/he goes out on a date with the supervisor, or tells an employee he/she will be fired if the employee doesn't sleep with him/her. * Tangible Employment Action: A tangible employment action must take place as a result of the employee's submission or refusal of supervisor's advances. In Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, the Court stated that tangible employment action amounted to ‚Äúa significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.‚Äù It is important to note that only supervisors can make tangible employment actions, since they have the company's authority to do so. The Court also held that unfulfilled threats by a supervisor of an adverse employment decision are not sufficient to establish a \\"Quid pro quo,\\" but were relevant for the purposes of a Hostile work environment claim. Additionally, The Supreme Court has held that Constructive dismissal can count as a tangible employment action (thus allowing a quid pro quo sexual harassment claim) if the actions taken by a supervisor created a situation where a \\"reasonable person ... would have felt compelled to resign.\\" Once the plaintiff has established these three factors, the employer can not assert an affirmative defense (such as the employer had a sexual harassment policy in place to prevent and properly respond to issues of sexual harassment), but can only dispute whether the unwelcome conduct did not in fact take place, the employee was not a supervisor, and that there was no tangible employment action involved. Although these terms are popular among lawyers and scholars, neither \\"hostile work environment\\" nor \\"quid pro quo\\" are found in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of race, sex, color, national origin, and religion. The Supreme Court noted in Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth that these terms are useful in differentiating between cases where threats of harassment are \\"carried out and those where they are not or absent altogether,\\" but otherwise these terms serve a limited purpose. Therefore, it is important to remember that sexual harassment can take place by a supervisor, and an employer can be potentially liable, even if that supervisor's behavior does not fall within the criteria of a \\"Quid pro quo\\" harassment claim.  Donald Trump impeachment inquiry  Quid pro quo has been frequently mentioned during the impeachment inquiry into U.S. president Donald Trump, in reference to the charge that his request for an investigation of Hunter Biden was a precondition for the delivery of congressionally authorized military aid during a call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.  Other meanings  For languages that come from latin such as Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and French, Quid pro quo is used to define a misunderstanding or blunder made by the substituting of one thing for another. The Oxford English Dictionary describes this alternative definition in English as \\"now rare\\". The Vocabolario Treccani (an authoritative dictionary published by the Encyclopedia Treccani), under the entry \\"qui pro quo\\", states that the latter expression probably derives from the Latin used in late medieval pharmaceutical compilations. This can be clearly seen from the work appearing precisely under this title, \\"Tractatus quid pro quo,\\" (Treatise on what substitutes for what) in the medical collection headed up by Mesue cum expositione Mondini super Canones universales... (Venice: per Joannem & Gregorium de gregorijs fratres, 1497), folios 334r-335r. Some examples of what could be used in place of what in this list are: \\"Pro uva passa dactili\\" (in place of raisins, [use] dates); \\"Pro mirto sumac\\" (in place of myrtle, [use] sumac); \\"Pro fenugreco semen lini\\" (in place of fenugreek, [use] flaxseed), etc. This list was an essential resource in the medieval apothecary, especially for occasions when certain essential medicinal substances were not available. Satirist Ambrose Bierce defined political influence as \\"a visionary quo given in exchange for a substantial quid\\", making a pun on quid as a form of currency. Quid is slang for pounds, the British currency, originating on this expression as in: if you want the quo you'll need to give them some quid, which explains the plural without s, as in I gave them five hundred quid.

Biography  He was born at Les Pontets, Franche-Comt√©, d√©partement of Doubs. In his tenth year, his father, a tax-gatherer, sent him to an uncle at Pontarlier, under whom he began his classical studies. At Dijon his compositions attracted the attention of an inspector, who had him placed (1814) in the normal school, Paris. There he came under the influence of Victor Cousin, and in 1817 he was appointed assistant professor of philosophy at the normal and Bourbon schools. Three years later, being thrown upon his own resources, he began a course of lectures in his own house, and formed literary connexions with Le Courrier fran√ßais, Le Globe, L'Encyclop√©die moderne, and La Revue europ√©enne. The variety of his pursuits at this time carried him over the whole field of ancient and modern literature. But he was chiefly attracted to the philosophical system represented by Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart. The application of \\"common sense\\" to the problem of substance supplied a more satisfactory analytic for him than the scepticism of David Hume which reached him through a study of Kant. He thus threw in his lot with the Scottish philosophy, and his first dissertations are adaptations from Reid's Inquiry. In 1826 he wrote a preface to a translation of Stewart's Moral Philosophy, demonstrating the possibility of a scientific statement of the laws of consciousness; in 1828 he began a translation of the works of Reid, and in his preface estimated the influence of Scottish criticism upon philosophy, giving a biographical account of the movement from Francis Hutcheson onwards. In the following year he was returned to parlement by the arrondissement of Pontarlier; but the work of legislation was ill-suited to him. Yet he attended to his duties conscientiously, and ultimately broke his health in their discharge. In 1833 he was appointed professor of Greek and Roman philosophy at the college of France and a member of the Academy of Sciences; he then published the M√©langes philosophiques (4th ed. 1866; Eng. trans. G Ripley, Boston, 1835 and 1838), a collection of fugitive papers in criticism and philosophy and history. In them is foreshadowed all that he afterwards worked out in metaphysics, psychology, ethics and aesthetics. He had already demonstrated, in his prefaces, the possibility of a psychology apart from physiology, of a science of the phenomena of consciousness distinct from the perceptions of sense. He now classified the mental faculties, premising that they must not be confounded with capacities or properties of mind. They were, according to his analysis, personal will, primitive instincts, voluntary movement, natural and artificial signs, sensibility and the faculties of intellect; on this analytic he founded his scheme of the universe. In 1835 he published Cours de droit naturel (4th ed. 1866), one of his most important works. From the conception of a universal order in the universe he reasons to a Supreme Being, who has created it and who has conferred upon every man in harmony with it the aim of his existence, leading to his highest good. Good, he says, is the fulfilment of man's destiny, evil the thwarting of it. Every man being organized in a particular way has, of necessity, an aim, the fulfilment of which is good; and he has faculties for accomplishing it, directed by reason. The aim is good, however, only when reason guides it for the benefit of the majority, but that is not absolute good. When reason rises to the conception of universal order, when actions are submitted, by the exercise of a sympathy working necessarily and intuitively to the idea of the universal order, the good has been reached, the true good, good in itself, absolute good. But he does not follow his idea into the details of human duty, though he passes in review fatalism, mysticism, pantheism, scepticism, egotism, sentimentalism and rationalism. In 1835 Jouffroy's health failed and he went to Italy, where he continued to translate the Scottish philosophers. On his return he became librarian to the university, and took the chair of recent philosophy at the faculty of letters. He died in Paris. After his death were published Nouveaux m√©langes philosophiques (3rd ed. 1872) and Cours d'esthetique (3rd ed. 1875). The former contributed nothing new to the system except a more emphatic statement of the distinction between psychology and physiology. The latter formulated his theory of beauty. Jouffroy's claim to distinction rests mainly on his ability as an expositor of other men's ideas. His enthusiasm, and his command over the language of popular exposition, made him a great international medium for the transfusion of ideas. He stood between Scotland and France and Germany and France; and, though his expositions are vitiated by loose reading of the philosophers he interpreted, he did some memorable work.

The Tree of Knowledge is on the right. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil (  ø√™·π£ had-da øa·πØ ·π≠≈çw·∏á wƒÅ-rƒÅ ø ) is one of two specific trees in the story of the Garden of Eden in Genesis 2‚Äì3, along with the tree of life. In Genesis =Narrative= Genesis 2 narrates that Yahweh places the first man and woman in a garden with trees of whose fruits they may eat, but forbids them to eat from \\"the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\\" When, in Genesis 3, a serpent persuades the woman to eat from its forbidden fruit and she also lets the man taste it, God expels them from the garden. =Meaning of good and evil= The phrase in , literally translates as good and evil. This may be an example of the type of figure of speech known as merism, a literary device that pairs opposite terms together in order to create a general meaning, so that the phrase \\"good and evil\\" would simply imply \\"everything.\\" This is seen in the Egyptian expression evil-good, which is normally employed to mean \\"everything.\\" In Greek literature, Homer also uses the device when he lets Telemachus say, \\"I [wish to] know everything, the good and the evil.\\"; though the words used ‚Äì ·ºêœÉŒ∏ŒªœåœÇ for \\"good\\" and œáŒµœÅŒµŒØœâŒΩ for \\"evil\\" ‚Äì are better termed \\"superior\\" and \\"inferior\\".Homer, However, if tree of the knowledge of good and evil is to be understood to mean a tree whose fruit imparts knowledge of everything, this phrase does not necessarily denote a moral concept. This view is held by several scholars.Harry Orlinsky's notes to the NJPS Torah. Given the context of disobedience to God, other interpretations of the implications of this phrase also demand consideration. Robert Alter emphasizes the point that when God forbids the man to eat from that particular tree, he says that if he does so, he is \\"doomed to die.\\" The Hebrew behind this is in a form regularly used in the Hebrew Bible for issuing death sentences. Religious views =Judaism= In Jewish tradition, the Tree of Knowledge and the eating of its fruit represents the beginning of the mixture of good and evil together. Before that time, the two were separate, and evil had only a nebulous existence in potential. While free choice did exist before eating the fruit, evil existed as an entity separate from the human psyche, and it was not in human nature to desire it. Eating and internalizing the forbidden fruit changed this and thus was born the yetzer hara, the evil inclination.Rashi to Genesis 2:25Ramban to Genesis 3:6 In Rashi's notes on Genesis 3:3, the first sin came about because Eve added an additional clause to the Divine command: Neither shall you touch it. By saying this, Eve added to YHWH's command and thereby came to detract from it, as it is written: Do not add to His Words (Proverbs 30:6). However, In Legends of the Jews, it was Adam who had devoutly forbidden Eve to touch the tree even though God had only mentioned the eating of the fruit.Ginzberg, Louis, The Legends of the Jews, Vol. I: The Fall of Man, (Translated by Henrietta Szold), Johns Hopkins University Press: 1998, In Kabbalah, the sin of the Tree of Knowledge (called Cheit Eitz HaDa'at) brought about the great task of beirurim, sifting through the mixture of good and evil in the world to extract and liberate the sparks of holiness trapped therein.Epistle 26, Lessons in Tanya, Igeret HaKodesh Since evil no longer has independent existence, it henceforth depends on holiness to draw down the Divine life-force, on whose \\"leftovers\\" it then feeds and derives existence.ch. 22, Tanya, Likutei Amarim Once evil is separated from holiness through beirurim, its source of life is cut off, causing the evil to disappear. This is accomplished through observance of the 613 commandments in the Torah, which deal primarily with physical objects wherein good and evil are mixed together.ch. 37, Lessons in Tanya, Likutei AmarimTorah Ohr 3cTorat Chaim Bereishit 30a Thus, the task of beirurim rectifies the sin of the Tree and draws the Shechinah back down to earth, where the sin of the Tree had caused Her to depart.Bereishit Rabbah 19:7Ramban to Genesis 3:8 =Christianity= A marble bas relief by Lorenzo Maitani on the Orvieto Cathedral, Italy depicts Eve and the tree In Christian tradition, consuming the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil was the sin committed by Adam and Eve that led to the fall of man in Genesis 3. In Catholicism, Augustine of Hippo taught that the tree should be understood both symbolically and as a real tree ‚Äì similarly to Jerusalem being both a real city and a figure of Heavenly Jerusalem.Augustine, On the Literal Meaning of Genesis (De Genesi ad litteram), VIII, 4.8; Biblioth√®que Augustinniene 49, 20 Augustine underlined that the fruits of that tree were not evil by themselves, because everything that God created was good (Gen 1:12). It was disobedience of Adam and Eve, who had been told by God not to eat of the tree (Gen 2:17), that caused disorder in the creation,Augustine of Hippo, On the Literal Meaning of Genesis (De Genesi ad litteram), VIII, 6.12 and 13.28, Biblioth√®que Augustinniene 49,28 and 50‚Äì52; PL 34, 377; cf. idem, De Trinitate, XII, 12.17; CCL 50, 371‚Äì372 [v. 26‚Äì31;1‚Äì36]; De natura boni 34‚Äì35; CSEL 25, 872; PL 42, 551‚Äì572 thus humanity inherited sin and guilt from Adam and Eve's sin. In Western Christian art, the fruit of the tree is commonly depicted as the apple, which originated in central Asia. This depiction may have originated as a Latin pun: by eating the mƒÅlum (apple), Eve contracted malum (evil). =Islam= The Quran never refers to the tree as the \\"Tree of the knowledge of good and evil\\" but rather typically refers to it as \\"the tree\\" or (in the words of Iblis) as the \\"tree of immortality.\\"Qur'an 20:120 Muslims believe that when God created Adam and Eve, he told them that they could enjoy everything in the Garden except this tree ( a Normal tree ) and so, Satan appeared to them and told them that the only reason God forbade them to eat from that tree is that they would become Angels or Immortal ( demonic lie ). When they ate from this tree their nakedness appeared to them and they began to sew together, for their covering, leaves from the Garden. became the reason for the slip. The Quran mentions the sin as being a 'slip', and after this 'slip' they were sent to the destination they were intended to be on: Earth. Consequently, they repented to God and asked for his forgivenessQur'an 7:23 and were forgiven.Qur'an 2:37 It was decided that those who obey God and follow his path shall be rewarded with everlasting life in Jannah, and those who disobey God and stray away from his path shall be punished in Jahannam. God in Quran (Al-A'raf 27) states: :\\"[O] Children of Adam! Let not Satan tempt you as he brought your parents out of the Garden, stripping them of their garments to show them their shameful parts. Surely he [Satan] sees you, he and his tribe, from where you see them not. We have made the Satans the friends of those who do not believe.\\" =Gnosticism= Uniquely, the Gnostic religion held that the tree was entirely positive or even sacred. Per this saga, it was the archons who told Adam and Eve not to eat from its fruit then lied to them by claiming they would die after tasting it. But later in the story, an instructor is sent from the Pleroma by the aeons to save humanity and reveal gnosis. This savior does so by telling Adam and Eve that eating the fruit is the way into salvation. Examples of the narrative can be found within the Gnostic manuscripts On the Origin of the World and the Secret Book of John. Manichaeism, which has been considered a Gnostic sect, echoes these notions as well, presenting the primordial aspect of Jesus as the instructor. Other cultures A cylinder seal, known as the Adam and Eve cylinder seal, from post-Akkadian periods in Mesopotamia (c. 23rd ‚Äì 22nd century BCE), has been linked to the Adam and Eve story. Assyriologist George Smith (1840‚Äì1876) describes the seal as having two facing figures (male and female) seated on each side of a tree, holding out their hands to the fruit, while between their backs is a serpent, giving evidence that the fall of man account was known in early times of Babylonia. The British Museum disputes this interpretation and holds that it is a common image from the period depicting a male deity being worshiped by a woman, with no reason to connect the scene with the Book of Genesis.

A root name server is a name server for the root zone of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet. It directly answers requests for records in the root zone and answers other requests by returning a list of the authoritative name servers for the appropriate top-level domain (TLD). The root name servers are a critical part of the Internet infrastructure because they are the first step in translating (resolving) human readable host names into IP addresses that are used in communication between Internet hosts. A combination of limits in the DNS and certain protocols, namely the practical size of unfragmented User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets, resulted in a decision to limit the number of root servers to thirteen server addresses. The use of anycast addressing permits the actual number of root server instances to be much larger, and is 1,086 . Root domain The DNS is a hierarchical naming system for computers, services, or any resource participating in the Internet. The top of that hierarchy is the root domain. The root domain does not have a formal name and its label in the DNS hierarchy is an empty string. All fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) on the Internet can be regarded as ending with this empty string for the root domain, and therefore ending in a full stop character (the label delimiter), e.g., \\"\\". This is generally implied rather than explicit, as modern DNS software does not actually require that the terminating dot be included when attempting to translate a domain name to an IP address. The root domain contains all top-level domains of the Internet. , it contains 1058 TLDs, including 730 generic top-level domains (gTLDs) and 301 country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) in the root domain. In addition, the domain is used for technical name spaces in the management of Internet addressing and other resources. A domain is used for testing internationalized domain names. Resolver operation When a computer on the Internet needs to resolve a domain name, it uses resolver software to perform the lookup. A resolver breaks the name up into its labels from right to left. The first component (TLD) is queried using a root server to obtain the responsible authoritative server. Queries for each label return more specific name servers until a name server returns the answer of the original query. In practice, most of this information does not change very often over a period of hours and therefore it is cached by intermediate name servers or by a name cache built into the user's application. DNS lookups to the root name servers may therefore be relatively infrequent. A survey in 2003 reports that only 2% of all queries to the root servers were legitimate. Incorrect or non-existent caching was responsible for 75% of the queries, 12.5% were for unknown TLDs, 7% were for lookups using IP addresses as if they were domain names, etc. Some misconfigured desktop computers even tried to update the root server records for the TLDs. A similar list of observed problems and recommended fixes has been published in RFC 4697. Although any local implementation of DNS can implement its own private root name servers, the term \\"root name server\\" is generally used to describe the thirteen well-known root name servers that implement the root name space domain for the Internet's official global implementation of the Domain Name System. Resolvers use a small 3 KB root.hints file published by Internic to bootstrap this initial list of root server addresses. Root server addresses There are 13 logical root name servers specified, with logical names in the form , where ranges from a to m. The choice of thirteen name servers was made because of limitations in the original DNS specification, which specifies a maximum packet size of 512 bytes when using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).RFC 1035 Domain names ‚Äì implementation and specification Technically however, fourteen name servers fit into an IPv4 packet. The addition of IPv6 addresses for the root name servers requires more than 512 bytes, which is facilitated by the EDNS0 extension to the DNS standard.ICANN: Accommodating IP Version 6 Address Resource Records for the Root of the Domain Name System This does not mean that there are only 13 physical servers; each operator uses redundant computer equipment to provide reliable service even if failure of hardware or software occurs. Additionally, all operate in multiple geographical locations using a routing technique called anycast addressing, providing increased performance and even more fault tolerance. An informational homepage exists for every logical server (except G-Root) under the Root Server Technical Operations Association domain with web address in the form , where ranges from a to m. Ten servers were originally in the United States; some are now operated using anycast addressing. Three servers were originally located in Stockholm (I-Root), Amsterdam (K-Root), and Tokyo (M-Root) respectively. Older servers had their own name before the policy of using similar names was established. With anycast, most of the physical root servers are now outside the United States, allowing for high performance worldwide. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"font-size:85%;\\" - ! Letter !

There are also several alternative namespace systems with an alternative DNS root using their own set of root name servers that exist in parallel to the mainstream name servers. The first, AlterNIC, generated a substantial amount of press. The function of a root name server may also be implemented locally, or on a provider network. Such servers are synchronized with the official root zone file as published by ICANN, and do not constitute an alternate root. As the root name servers are an important part of the Internet, they have come under attack several times, although none of the attacks have ever been serious enough to severely affect the performance of the Internet. Root server supervision The DNS Root Server System Advisory Committee is an ICANN committee. ICANN's bylaws assign authority over the operation of the root name servers of the Domain Name System to the DNS Root Server System Advisory Committee. Root zone file The root zone file is a small (about 2 MB) data set whose publication is the primary purpose of root name servers. This is not to be confused with the root.hints file used to bootstrap a resolver. The root zone file is at the apex of a hierarchical distributed database called the Domain Name System (DNS). This database is used by almost all Internet applications to translate worldwide unique names such as www.wikipedia.org into other identifiers such as IP addresses. The contents of the root zone file is a list of names and numeric IP addresses of the authoritative DNS servers for all top-level domains (TLDs) such as com, org, edu, and the country code top-level domains. On 12 December 2004, 773 different authoritative servers for the TLDs were listed. Later the number of TLDs increased greatly. , the root zone consisted of 1511 TLDs (that does not include 55 domains that are not assigned, 8 that are retired and 11 test domains). Other name servers forward queries for which they do not have any information about authoritative servers to a root name server. The root name server, using its root zone file, answers with a referral to the authoritative servers for the appropriate TLD or with an indication that no such TLD exists.ISOC, DNS Root Name Servers explained for the non-expert, (Available online, accessed 19 March 2010.)

Since their formation, they have released fifteen studio albums, four DVDs and five live albums. In its history, the band has gone through many chaotic lineup changes and since 1995 there are no founding members of the band that remain. Currently, the longest standing member is singer Timo Kotipelto, who joined in 1994. Stratovarius was founded under the name Black Water in August 1984 by singer and drummer Tuomo Lassila, guitarist Staffan Str√•hlman, and bassist John Viherv√§. Line-up changes soon started to occur, including Timo Tolkki replacing Str√•hlman two months later and taking over singing duties as well, and the band expanding to a quartet with the arrival of keyboardist Antti Ikonen the following year. Under this line-up, the band released its first album Fright Night in 1989, with Tolkki as the only songwriter. While the band went through many bassists, the band released the albums Twilight Time in 1992 and Dreamspace in 1994. In 1994, Tolkki decided to stop acting as lead vocalist, with Kotipelto joining the band. After the release of Fourth Dimension in 1995, Ikonen and the last founding member, Lassila, left the band and were replaced by Jens Johansson and J√∂rg Michael respectively. This line- up consisting of Kotipelto, Tolkki, bassist Jari Kainulainen, Johansson and Michael, now recognized as the \\"classic line-up\\" of Stratovarius, became the longest line-up in its history (1995-2005). With this line-up, the band released eight albums including most of their popular works (releasing an album with the same line-up than its predecessor for the first time) until the release of a self-titled album in 2005, after which Kainulainen departed and was replaced by Lauri Porra. In 2008 guitarist, sole composer and main lyricist Timo Tolkki, being highly critical of their last album and tired of the tensions between the members, decided to disband Stratovarius. However, at the demand of the rest of the band, he agreed to let them continue as Stratovarius while leaving the band. He subsequently regretted his decision, stating that the current band had nothing to do with Stratovarius which he considered as mainly his own work. Despite the controversy of Tolkki's departure, the band's following albums Polaris (2009) and Elysium (2011) received positive reception, with various critics and fans considering them their best albums in the last decade. These were the first albums with Porra and new guitarist Matias Kupiainen, and all members except Michael were part of the songwriting process. After a small \\"Farewell J√∂rg\\" tour in Finland, J√∂rg Michael departed for personal reasons in 2012. With new drummer Rolf Pilve, the band released Nemesis in 2013 and Eternal in 2015. History =Early years and Fright Night (1984‚Äì1990)= Stratovarius was founded in August 1984 in Finland under the name Black Water. They went through a number of personnel, style and name changes before the band found its own voice. The founding members were Tuomo Lassila, Staffan Str√•hlman, and John Viherv√§. By 1985, the name had changed to Stratovarius (a portmanteau of Stratocaster and Stradivarius, which is also the name of an early Kraftwerk song), and guitarist/vocalist Timo Tolkki entered the band in December of that year, replacing Str√•hlman. In 1988 they released their first two singles, \\"Future Shock\\" and \\"Black Night\\". In 1989 their debut album Fright Night was released, which would be accompanied by a small tour of Europe. =Twilight Time, Dreamspace and Fourth Dimension (1991‚Äì1995)= In 1991 the group released their second album, which was initially released under the name Stratovarius II but was later re-released in 1992 with the name Twilight Time. On this album, Tolkki played bass as well as guitar on all tracks, despite Jari Behm receiving credit on the album. After Twilight Time was released, Behm was fired and replaced with Jari Kainulainen. In 1994 Dreamspace, their third album, was released. This album was the last album that followed the style of the initial releases because when Tolkki abandoned his position as lead singer the group adopted the more neo-classical/symphonic style which they became famous for. After releasing the album Dreamspace, Timo Tolkki decided to step down from the lead singer position of the band to concentrate on guitar and songwriting as well as to move Stratovarius in a new direction. The band started auditions for a new singer, eventually choosing Timo Kotipelto. In 1995, the band released their first album with Kotipelto on vocals Fourth Dimension, which was accompanied by a music video for the song \\"Against the Wind\\". This was the last album with a singing performance by Timo Tolkki, being featured as a backing vocalist on this album. This was the first album that showed signs of the new direction the band was heading, with tracks such as \\"Twilight Symphony\\" using an orchestra for the first time in their recordings. =Departures of Tuomo Lassila and Antti Ikonen, Episode, Visions and Destiny (1996‚Äì1999)= It was in this period that the last founding member left the band. Unhappy with the new direction the band was heading, Tuomo Lassila decided to leave the band along with Antti Ikonen, leaving Stratovarius searching for a new drummer and keyboardist to fill their places. J√∂rg Michael from Rage was hired as their drummer and soon after, Jens Johansson of Yngwie Malmsteen-fame was hired as keyboardist, a position he has held to this date. This new line-up released Episode, an album that showcased their new symphonic direction with a full orchestra and choir utilized on tracks such as \\"Season of Change\\" and \\"Forever\\". The line-up on this album proved to be their most stable, remaining the same until the release of Polaris in 2009. In 1997 the band released their sixth studio album titled Visions. This album was released to a very positive reception and featured notable songs \\"The Kiss of Judas\\", \\"Black Diamond\\" and the title track \\"Visions (Southern Cross)\\", a 10-minute epic that was their longest song at the time. \\"Black Diamond\\" has since become one of their most recognized songs, and has been included in almost all live setlists since its release. In the same year, the band recorded the album Destiny, which reached No. 1 on the Finnish charts. Destiny contained \\"S.O.S.\\" and \\"Rebel\\", as well as the 10-minute title track \\"Destiny\\". =Infinite, Intermission and Elements, Pts. 1 & 2 (2000‚Äì2003)= In 2000, the album Infinite was released. Just like its predecessor, Infinite reached No.1 in the Finnish chart, the last time one of their albums would do so until the release of Elysium in 2011. Continuing the trend of featuring lengthy symphonic pieces, the titular track \\"Infinity\\" is over 9 minutes long. Featured songs are \\"Hunting High and Low\\" and \\"A Million Light Years Away\\". The following year saw the release of Intermission a compilation album of B-Sides, bonus tracks from previous albums and unreleased material. During this time, the band decided to take a break from working on new material for Stratovarius. It was in this time that Timo Tolkki released his second solo album Hymn to Life and guest appeared on the Avantasia album The Metal Opera (Tolkki would later play guest guitar on the sequel album The Metal Opera Part II). Timo Kotipelto also began his side project Kotipelto, with the first album Waiting for the Dawn getting released in 2002. In 2002 the band started work on their next project titled Elements. Initially conceived as a double album, the project was eventually split into two different releases, with Elements Pt. 1 and Elements Pt. 2 both being released the same year in 2003. This would contain some of the group's most ambitious work yet, with the title track \\"Elements\\" on Elements Pt. 1 clocking in at 12 minutes, the longest song the band would write until the release of Elysium in 2011. Elements was also the first, and so far only attempt at recording a double-album, and showed the band experimenting with their musical style. =Hiatus, Stratovarius and Tolkki's departure (2004‚Äì2008)= During this period, tensions were increasing in the band, and in 2004 Stratovarius temporarily disbanded after Timo Tolkki suffered a nervous breakdown. A couple of months after the breakdown, Tolkki was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and went into rehabilitation for a period. During this time, Timo Kotipelto released his second album with his side project Kotipelto titled Coldness. It was also during this time that Stratovarius orchestrated a series of publicity stunts, including Kotipelto being fired and replaced by a female singer named \\"Katrina K\\", as well as Tolkki being stabbed at a concert. Eventually, the stunts were revealed to be a hoax, and Tolkki reunited the band to begin work on their next album. In 2005, the self-titled album Stratovarius was released to hostile reception by fans. Stratovarius featured a very different change in style compared to previous efforts, containing almost no symphonic or neo- classical elements in the music or soloing of Tolkki and Johansson that fans were used to, and did not feature any lengthy epics. Tolkki was highly critical of the album, and Stratovarius showed evidence of the band relationship at an all-time low. Seemingly against Tolkki's wishes, Jari Kainulainen was fired in 2005 following the release of the album for reasons Tolkki said were \\"so absurd that I am not even [going to] try and explain them here\\". Kainulainen was quickly replaced with Lauri Porra, and in 2006 the band began work on a new album that was tentatively titled R...R..., however, as internal issues increased, the project stalled. Eventually, the band reached a divide, with Johansson and Porra supporting Tolkki on one side, and Kotipelto and Michael on the other. Finally, on March 4, 2008, Tolkki officially declared that he was disbanding Stratovarius: \\"It is time to stop the silence and announce what some of you have already been speculating. Stratovarius is no more...\\" As Tolkki held the rights to the name Stratovarius and all its royalties, it was his initial intention to completely disband Stratovarius. However, on May 20, 2008 he agreed to sign over the rights to the name Stratovarius and all its royalties to Timo Kotipelto, Jens Johansson and J√∂rg Michael (though Michael was initially against using the name Stratovarius), allowing Stratovarius to continue on without him. Tolkki later took the songs he wrote for the R..R.. sessions and formed the band Revolution Renaissance, using the R...R... to form the name of the band, instead of the album. Stratovarius eventually found a replacement guitarist with Matias Kupiainen, and soon after began work on their next album. =First years without Tolkki: Polaris and Elysium (2009‚Äì2012)= Matias Kupiainen joined the band in 2008. In 2009 came the release of Polaris, which reached No. 2 in Finland. It was the first album after the departure of Timo Tolkki and Jari Kainulainen, and featured in their place new guitarist Matias Kupiainen and bassist Lauri Porra. The album yielded the two singles \\"Deep Unknown\\" and \\"Higher We Go\\". In 2010 the album was re-released along with different live material recorded during the Polaris Tour. In September 2010, Stratovarius announced the start of recording of their second album with Matias Kupiainen on guitar. Before officially launching the album, the Darkest Hours EP was released with the new songs \\"Darkest Hours\\" and \\"Infernal Maze\\", plus two live recordings of older songs. To promote the new album, Stratovarius toured as guests on Helloween's Seven Sinners Tour. As Stratovarius's drummer J√∂rg Michael was diagnosed with cancer, he was temporarily replaced by Alex Landenburg in the band. In 2011, the band released their new album titled Elysium that quickly reached No. 1 in Finland, the first of their albums to reach No.1 since Infinite. Notable songs on the album include the singles \\"Darkest Hours\\", \\"Under Flaming Skies\\", and the 18-minute epic \\"Elysium\\", the longest song that Stratovarius has ever recorded. J√∂rg Michael has announced his plans to leave the band for personal reasons. J√∂rg played all the remaining tour dates until January 31 in Guatemala City, and celebrated with a special Finnish \\"Farewell J√∂rg\\" tour from November 18 to November 26. In March 2012, the band announced a drummer search on their Facebook page. On June 20, 2012, the band announced that Rolf Pilve is their new drummer. On June 29, 2012, live album and DVD Under Flaming Winter Skies - Live In Tampere has been released. It was filmed in Tampere, Finland on 19 November 2011 and that is the last release with the drummer J√∂rg Michael. = Nemesis, Eternal and Enigma: Intermission 2 (2013‚Äìpresent)= Their new album, Nemesis, has been released on February 22, 2013. The first single, \\"Unbreakable\\", was released on January 25, 2013. They also released a DVD called Nemesis Days with some Nemesis World Tour recordings in this same year. In August 2014 the band announced they would play a few shows dedicated to their 1997 hit album Visions. During these shows, the whole album was played. The premiere of these concept shows was September 12, 2014: their headliner performance at Progpower USA in Atlanta. On December 5, 2014 Elements Pt. 1 and Elements Pt. 2 were reissued as a box set which included the high quality 3CD+DVD digi-pak, a cassette including previously unreleased demo songs which are only available on this format and are not made available anywhere else, an ‚ÄúElements‚Äù tour T-shirt as well as a reproduction of the original tour program. On April 24, 2015, Stratovarius announced that their sixteenth studio album, Eternal, would be released on September 11, 2015. On June 23, 2015, Stratovarius unveiled Eternal's cover, as well as the official track list of the album. On July 30, 2015, the band announced that the lead single from Eternal will be Shine in the Dark. An official lyric video featuring vocalist Timo Kotipelto was uploaded onto YouTube. In October 2015, Stratovarius embarked on a world tour to promote the new album. They began this with a European Tour of 16 countries including France, Germany, and the Netherlands. Gloryhammer and Divine Ascension were the support acts for the European leg of the tour. On May 20, 2016, the band released their Best Of compilation, which included one previously unreleased track called \\"Until the End of Days\\". On January 13, 2018, Kotipelto discussed recent anniversary shows and also commented that the band had hoped to record a new album during spring 2018. On August 10, 2018, Stratovarius released the new song \\"Oblivion\\" from the upcoming compilation album Enigma: Intermission 2, which came out September 28, 2018. It is the follow-up to 2001's Intermission. The band supported the new album with a European tour with Tarja Turunen on the A Nordic Symphony '18 tour. Musical style Stratovarius is described as primarily a power metal band and one of the most influential groups of the genre, and also encompassed other genres, such as neoclassical metal, progressive metal, symphonic metal and hard rock.

It began with an investigation into the real estate investments of Bill and Hillary Clinton and their associates, Jim McDougal and Susan McDougal, in the Whitewater Development Corporation. This failed business venture was incorporated in 1979 with the purpose of developing vacation properties on land along the White River near Flippin, Arkansas. A March 1992 New York Times article published during the 1992 U.S. presidential campaign reported that the Clintons, then governor and first lady of Arkansas, had invested and lost money in the Whitewater Development Corporation.Jeff Gerth, \\"Clintons Joined S.& L. Operator In an Ozark Real-Estate Venture\\", New York Times, March 8, 1992. Accessed April 30, 2007. The article stimulated the interest of L. Jean Lewis, a Resolution Trust Corporation investigator who was looking into the failure of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, also owned by Jim and Susan McDougal. Lewis looked for connections between the savings and loan company and the Clintons, and on September 2, 1992, she submitted a criminal referral to the FBI naming Bill and Hillary Clinton as witnesses in the Madison Guaranty case. Little Rock U.S. Attorney Charles A. Banks and the FBI determined that the referral lacked merit, but Lewis continued to pursue the case. From 1992 to 1994, Lewis issued several additional referrals against the Clintons and repeatedly called the U.S. Attorney's Office in Little Rock and the Justice Department regarding the case. Her referrals eventually became public knowledge, and she testified before the Senate Whitewater Committee in 1995. David Hale, the source of criminal allegations against the Clintons, claimed in November 1993 that Bill Clinton had pressured him into providing an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land deal.Jonathan Broder and Murray Waas, \\"The road to Hale\\", Salon.com, March 17, 1998. Accessed November 28, 2012. The allegations were regarded as questionable because Hale had not mentioned Clinton in reference to this loan during the original FBI investigation of Madison Guaranty in 1989; only after coming under indictment himself in 1993, did Hale make allegations against the Clintons.Murray Waas, \\"The story Starr did not want to hear\\", Salon.com, August 17, 1998. Accessed August 25, 2007. A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project. Jim Guy Tucker, Bill Clinton's successor as governor, was convicted of fraud and sentenced to four years of probation for his role in the matter.Haddigan, M. (1996). \\"Tucker Sentenced to 4 Years Probation\\", Washington Post. 1996. Susan McDougal served 18 months in prison for contempt of court for refusing to answer questions relating to Whitewater. Neither Bill Clinton nor Hillary Clinton were ever prosecuted, after three separate inquiries found insufficient evidence linking them with the criminal conduct of others related to the land deal. The matter was handled by the Whitewater Independent Counsel, Kenneth Starr. The last of these inquiries came from the final Independent Counsel, Robert Ray (who replaced Starr) in 2000.\\"Ray: Insufficient evidence to prosecute Clintons in Whitewater probe\\", CNN, September 20, 2000. Accessed April 30, 2007. Susan McDougal was granted a pardon by President Clinton before he left office.  Nomenclature  The term \\"Whitewater\\" is sometimes used to include other controversies from the Bill Clinton administration, especially Travelgate, Filegate, and the circumstances surrounding Vince Foster's death, that were also investigated by the Whitewater Independent Counsel. But Whitewater proper refers only to the matters stemming from the Whitewater Development Corporation and subsequent developments. History =Origins of Whitewater Development Corporation= Hillcrest neighborhood of Little Rock from 1977 to 1979 while he was Arkansas Attorney General. p. 244.

Simon & Schuster (2003). . pp. 86‚Äì88. The Clintons were seeking ways of supplementing their income: Bill Clinton's salary was $26,500 as Arkansas Attorney General (which would rise to $35,000 if his campaign for Governor of Arkansas succeeded) and Hillary Clinton's salary was $24,500 as a Rose Law Firm associate for a combined income in 1978 of $51,173, . In spring of 1978, McDougal proposed that the Clintons join him and his wife, Susan, in buying of undeveloped land along the south bank of the White River near Flippin, Arkansas, in the Ozark Mountains. The goal was to subdivide the site into lots for vacation homes, intended for the many people coming south from Chicago and Detroit who were interested in low property taxes, fishing, rafting, and mountain scenery. The plan was to hold the property for a few years and then sell the lots at a profit. The four borrowed $203,000 to buy land, and subsequently transferred ownership of the land to the newly created Whitewater Development Corporation, in which all four participants had equal shares. Susan McDougal chose the name \\"Whitewater Estates\\" and their sales pitch was, \\"One weekend here and you'll never want to live anywhere else.\\"\\"Arkansas Roots\\", CNN.com, July 4, 1997.

The business was incorporated on June 18, 1979. =Failure of Whitewater Development Corporation and Castle Grande= By the time the Whitewater lots were surveyed and available for sale at the end of 1979, interest rates had climbed to near 20%. Prospective buyers could no longer afford to buy vacation homes. Rather than take a loss on the venture, the four decided to build a model home and wait for better economic conditions. The White River, near Flippin, Arkansas, and the intended site of the Whitewater Development Corporation's vacation homes. Following the land purchase, Jim McDougal asked the Clintons for additional funds for interest payments on the loan and other expenses; the Clintons later claimed to have no knowledge of how these contributions were used.Gwen Ifill, \\"Hillary Clinton Takes Questions on Whitewater\\", The New York Times, April 23, 1994. Accessed July 15, 2007. When Bill Clinton failed to win re-election in 1980, Jim McDougal lost his job as the governor's economic aide and decided to go into banking. He acquired the Bank of Kingston in 1980 and the Woodruff Savings & Loan in 1982,\\"Once Upon a Time in Arkansas: chronology\\", PBS Frontline renaming them the Madison Bank & Trust and the Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, respectively. In spring 1985, McDougal held a fundraiser at Madison Guaranty's office in Little Rock that paid off Clinton's 1984 gubernatorial campaign debt of $50,000. McDougal raised $35,000; $12,000 of that was in Madison Guaranty cashier's checks. In 1985, Jim McDougal invested in a local construction project called Castle Grande. The 1,000 acres (400 ha), located south of Little Rock, were priced at about $1.75 million, more than McDougal could afford on his own. According to then current law, McDougal could borrow only $600,000 from his own savings and loan, Madison Guaranty. Therefore, McDougal involved others to raise the additional funds. Among these was Seth Ward, an employee of the bank, who helped funnel the additional $1.15 million required. To avoid potential investigations, the money was moved back and forth among several other investors and intermediaries. Hillary Clinton, then an attorney at Rose Law Firm (which is based in Little Rock) provided legal services to Castle Grande. In 1986, federal regulators realized that all of the necessary funds for this real estate venture had come from Madison Guaranty; regulators called Castle Grande a sham. In July of that year, McDougal resigned from Madison Guaranty. Seth Ward fell under investigation, along with the lawyer who helped him draft the agreement. Castle Grande earned $2 million in commissions and fees for McDougal's business associates, as well as an unknown amount in legal fees for Rose Law Firm, but in 1989, it collapsed, at a cost to the government of $4 million. This in turn helped trigger the 1989 collapse of Madison Guaranty, which federal regulators then had to take over. Taking place in the midst of the nationwide savings and loan crisis, the failure of Madison Guaranty cost the United States $73 million. The Clintons lost between $37,000 and $69,000 on their Whitewater investment; this was less than the McDougals lost.Michael Tomasky, \\"Can We Know Her?\\", The New York Review of Books, July 19, 2007. Accessed July 28, 2007. The reasons for the unequal capital contributions by the Clintons and McDougals are unknown but the President's critics cited the discrepancy as evidence that then-Governor Clinton was to contribute to the project in other ways. The White House and the President's supporters claimed that they were exonerated by the Pillsbury Report. This was a $3 million study done for the Resolution Trust Corporation by the Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro law firm at the time that Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan was dissolved. The report concluded that James McDougal, who had set up the deal, was the managing partner, and Bill Clinton was a passive investor in the venture; the Associated Press characterized it as \\"generally support[ing] the Clintons' description of their involvement in Whitewater.\\"Gene Lyons, \\"Time's Empty Whitewater Exclusive\\", Accessed July 28, 2007. However, Charles Patterson, the attorney who supervised the report, \\"refused ... to call it a vindication\\" of the Clintons, stating in testimony before the Senate Whitewater Committee that \\"it was not our purpose to vindicate, castigate, exculpate.\\" =Bill Clinton's first run for president= During Bill Clinton's first bid for the presidency in 1992, he was asked by New York Times reporters about the failure of the Whitewater development.Robert W.

The subsequent New York Times article, by reporter Jeff Gerth, appeared on March 8, 1992. =Removal of documents= Within hours of the death of Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster in July 1993, chief White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum removed documents, some of them concerning the Whitewater Development Corporation, from Foster's office and gave them to Maggie Williams, Chief of Staff to the First Lady. According to the New York Times, Williams placed the documents in a safe in the Clinton residence on the third floor of the White House for five days before turning them over to the Clinton family lawyer.Michael Wines, \\"New Misstatements Admitted In Handling of Foster's Files\\", New York Times, August 3, 1994.

Her billing records from the mid-1980s would become the subject of intrigue during the Whitewater controversy. As a result of the expos√© in the New York Times, the Justice Department opened an investigation into the failed Whitewater deal. Media pressure continued to build, and on April 22, 1994, Hillary Clinton gave an unusual press conference under a portrait of Abraham Lincoln in the State Dining Room of the White House, to address questions on both Whitewater and the cattle futures controversy; it was broadcast live on several networks. In it, she claimed that the Clintons had a passive role in the Whitewater venture and had committed no wrongdoing, but admitted that her explanations had been vague. She said that she no longer opposed appointing a special prosecutor to investigate the matter. Afterwards, she won media praise for the manner in which she conducted herself during the press conference; Time called her \\"open, candid, but above all unflappable...the real message was her attitude and her poise. The confiding tone and relaxed body language...immediately drew approving reviews\\".Michael Duffy, \\"Open and Unflappable\\", Time magazine, April 1994. Accessed July 16, 2007. By that time there was growing backlash from Democrats and other members of the political left against the press' investigations of Whitewater. The New York Times was criticized by Gene Lyons of Harper's Magazine, who felt its reporters were exaggerating the significance and possible impropriety of what they were uncovering.Gene Lyons, \\"Fool for Scandal: How the 'Times' got Whitewater wrong\\", Harper's Magazine, October 1994. Accessed August 27, 2007. At Clinton's request, Attorney General Janet Reno appointed a special prosecutor, Robert B. Fiske, to investigate the legality of the Whitewater transactions in 1994. Two allegations surfaced: 1) that Clinton had exerted pressure on an Arkansas businessman, David Hale, to make a loan that would benefit him and the owners of Madison Guaranty; and 2) that an Arkansas bank had concealed transactions involving Clinton's gubernatorial campaign in 1990. In May 1994, Fiske issued a grand jury subpoena to the President and his wife for all documents relating to Madison Guaranty, with a deadline of 30 days. They were reported as missing by the Clintons. Almost two years later, the subpoenaed billing records of the Rose Law Firm were discovered in the Clintons' private residence in the White House, with fingerprints of Hillary Clinton, among others. =The Kenneth Starr investigation= In August 1994, Republican Kenneth Starr was appointed by a three-judge panel to continue the Whitewater investigation, replacing Republican Robert B. Fiske, who had been specially appointed by US attorney general Janet Reno, prior to the re-enactment of the Independent Counsel law. Fiske was replaced because he had been chosen and appointed by Janet Reno, Clinton's attorney general, creating the appearance of a conflict of interest. David Hale The key witness against President Clinton in Starr's Whitewater investigation, was banker David Hale who alleged in November 1992 that Clinton, while governor of Arkansas, pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the partner of the Clintons in the Whitewater deal. Hale's defense strategy, as proposed by attorney Randy Coleman, was to present himself as the victim of high-powered politicians who forced him to give away all of the money. This self-caricature was undermined by testimony from November 1989, wherein FBI agents investigating the failure of Madison Guaranty had questioned Hale about his dealings with Jim and Susan McDougal, including the $300,000 loan. According to the agents' official memorandum of that interview, Hale described in some detail his dealings with Jim Guy Tucker (then an attorney in private practice, later Bill Clinton's lieutenant governor), both McDougals, and several others, but never mentioned Governor Bill Clinton. Clinton denied that he pressured Hale to approve the loan to Susan McDougal. By this time, Hale had already pleaded guilty to two felonies and secured a reduction in his sentence in exchange for his testimony against Bill Clinton. Charges were made by Clinton supporters that Hale had received numerous cash payments from representatives of the so-called Arkansas Project, a $2.4 million campaign established to assist in Hale's defense strategy, and to investigate Clinton and his associates between 1993 and 1997. These charges were the topic of a separate investigation by former Department of Justice investigator, Michael E. Shaheen, Jr. Shaheen filed his report in July 1999 to Starr, who stated that the allegations that Hale had been paid in hopes of influencing his testimony were \\"unsubstantiated or, in some cases, untrue\\". No further charges were brought against Hale or the Arkansas Project outlet, The American Spectator, though Hale later pled guilty in the Whitewater case to two felonies and served 21 months of a 28-month sentence. Writers from Salon have complained that the full, 168-page report had not been made public, a complaint still being reiterated by Salon as of 2001. State prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Hale in early July 1996, charging that Hale had misrepresented the solvency of his insurance company, National Savings Life, to the state insurance commission. The prosecutors also alleged in court papers that Hale had made those misrepresentations to conceal the fact that he had looted the insurance company. Hale said that any infraction was a technicality and that no one had lost any money. In March 1999, Hale was convicted of the first charge, with the jury recommending a 21-day jail sentence. Starr drafted an impeachment referral to the House of Representatives in the fall of 1997, alleging that there was \\"substantial and credible evidence\\" that Bill Clinton had committed perjury regarding Hale's allegations. Hale pleaded guilty in the Whitewater case to two felonies and served 21 months of a 28-month sentence. Webster Hubbell Theodore B. Olson, who with several associates, launched the plan that later became known as the \\"Arkansas Project\\", wrote several essays for The American Spectator, accusing Clinton and many of his associates of wrongdoing. The first of those pieces appeared in February 1994, alleging a wide variety of criminal offenses by the Clintons and others, including Webster Hubbell. These allegations led to the discovery that Hubbell, a friend and former Rose Law Firm partner of Hillary Clinton, had committed multiple frauds, mostly against his own firm. Hillary Clinton, instead of being complicit in Hubbell's crimes, had been among his victims. In December 1994, one week after Hubbell pleaded guilty to mail fraud and tax evasion, Associate White House Counsel, Jane C. Sherburne, created a \\"Task List\\" which included a reference to monitoring Hubbell's cooperation with Starr. Hubbell was later recorded in prison saying \\"I need to roll over one more time\\" regarding the Rose Law firm lawsuit. In his next court appearance, he pleaded the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination (see United States v. Hubbell). In February 1997, Starr announced he would leave the investigation to pursue a position at the Pepperdine University School of Law. However, he \\"flip flopped\\" in the face of \\"intense criticism\\" by conservatives, and new evidence of sexual misconduct, diverted to some degree by the burgeoning Lewinsky scandal, Starr's investigations in Arkansas were winding down, with his Little Rock grand jury about to expire. Susan McDougal Hubbell, Jim Guy Tucker, and Susan McDougal had all refused to cooperate with Starr. Tucker and McDougal were later pardoned by President Clinton. When the Arkansas grand jury did conclude its work in May 1998, after 30 months in panel, it came up with only a contempt indictment against Susan McDougal. Although she refused to testify under oath regarding the Clintons' involvement in Whitewater, Susan McDougal did make the case in the media that the Clintons had been truthful in their account of the loan, and had cast doubt on her former husband's motives for cooperating with Starr. She also claimed that James McDougal felt abandoned by Clinton, and told her \\"he was going to pay back the Clintons\\". She said to the press, again not under oath, that her husband had told her that Republican activist and Little Rock lawyer, Sheffield Nelson, was willing to \\"pay him some money\\" for talking to the New York Times about Bill Clinton, and in 1992, he told her that one of Clinton's political enemies was paying him to tell the New York Times about Whitewater. From the beginning, Susan McDougal charged that Starr offered her \\"global immunity\\" from other charges if she would cooperate with the Whitewater investigation. McDougal told the jury that refusing to answer questions about the Clintons and Whitewater wasn't easy for her, or her family. \\"It's been a long road, a very long road...and it was not an easy decision to make\\", McDougal told the court. McDougal refused to answer any questions while under oath, leading to her being imprisoned by the judge for civil contempt of court for the maximum 18 months, including eight months in isolation. Starr's subsequent indictment of McDougal for criminal contempt of court charges resulted in a jury hung 7-5, in favor of acquittal. President Clinton later pardoned her, shortly before leaving office (see list of people pardoned by Bill Clinton). Starr Whitewater Report In September 1998, Independent Counsel Starr released the Starr Report, concerning offenses alleged to have been committed by President Clinton, as part of the Lewinsky scandal. The report mentioned Whitewater only in passing; Clinton friend and advisor, Vernon Jordan, had tried to help Webster Hubbell financially with \\"no-show\\" consulting contracts while he was under pressure to cooperate with the Whitewater investigations. Indeed, it was on this basis that Starr took on the Lewinsky investigation, under the umbrella of the Whitewater Independent Counsel mandate. There was much acrimony from the most fervent critics of the Clintons, after the release of the Starr report on the Foster matter and after Starr's departure and return to the case. The death of Foster had been the source of many conspiracy theories. Christopher Ruddy, a reporter for Richard Mellon Scaife's Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, helped fuel much of this speculation with claims that Starr had not pursued this line of inquiry far enough. =Reaction of the Clintons= On January 26, 1996, Hillary Clinton testified before a grand jury concerning her investments in Whitewater. This was the first time in American history that a first lady had been subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury. She testified that they never borrowed any money from the bank, and denied having caused anyone to borrow money on their behalf. =Reaction of Congress= Parallel to the Independent Counsel track, both houses of the United States Congress had been investigating Whitewater and holding hearings on it. The House Committee on Financial Services had been scheduled to begin hearings in late March 1994, but they were postponed after an unusually angry, written communication from Democratic Banking Committee chair Henry B. Gonzalez to Republican Jim Leach. Gonzalez called Leach \\"obstinate\\", \\"obdurate\\", \\"in willful disregard\\" of House etiquette, and \\"premeditatedly\\" plotting a \\"judicial adventure\\". The House Banking Committee began its hearings in late July 1994. The Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee also began hearings on Whitewater in July 1994.\\"Timeline\\", CNN.com. Accessed June 30, 2007. These hearings intensified in May 1995, following the Republican gain of control, when the Republican Banking Committee chairman Al D'Amato also became chair of the newly formed Special Whitewater Committee. The Whitewater committee's hearings were much more extensive than those held previously by the Democrats, running for 300 hours over 60 sessions across 13 months, and taking over 10,000 pages of testimony and 35,000 pages of depositions from almost 250 people.David Maraniss, \\"The Hearings End Much as They Began\\", The Washington Post, June 19, 1996. Accessed June 30, 2007. The hearings' testimony and senatorial lines of investigation mostly followed partisan lines, with Republicans investigating the President and the Democrats defending him. The Senate Special Whitewater Committee issued an 800-page majority report on June 18, 1996, which only hinted at one possible improper action by President Clinton, but spoke of the Clinton Administration as \\"an American presidency [that] misused its power, circumvented the limits on its authority and attempted to manipulate the truth\\". The first lady came in for much stronger criticism, as she was \\"the central figure\\" in all aspects of the alleged wrongdoings.Brian Knowlton, \\"Republican Report Stokes the Partisan Fires : Whitewater Unchained\\", International Herald-Tribune, June 19, 1996. Accessed June 30, 2007. The Democratic minority on the Committee called these findings \\"a legislative travesty\\", \\"a witch hunt\\", and \\"a political game\\". On November 19, 1998, Independent Counsel Starr testified before the House Judiciary Committee in connection with the Impeachment of Bill Clinton over charges related to the Lewinsky scandal. Starr said that in late 1997, he had considered preparing an impeachment report regarding the fraudulent $300,000 loan to Susan McDougall and the question of whether the President had testified truthfully regarding the loan.Ruth Marcus, Peter Baker, \\"Clinton 'Thwarted' Probe, Starr to Say\\", The Washington Post, November 19, 1998. Accessed June 12, 2007. Starr said that he held back the charges because he was not sure that the two major witnesses had told the truth,Don Van Natta, Jr., \\"Democrats Challenge Starr on Delayed Exoneration\\", The New York Times, November 20, 1998. Accessed June 12, 2007. but that the investigation was still ongoing. Regarding the reappearance of Hillary Clinton's Rose Law Firm billing records in the White House residential section, Starr said the investigation had found no explanation for the disappearance or the reappearance. \\"After a thorough investigation, we have found no explanation how the billing records got where they were or why they were not discovered and produced earlier. It remains a mystery to this day.\\" Starr also chose this occasion to completely exonerate President Clinton of any wrongdoing in the Travelgate and Filegate matters; Democrats on the committee immediately criticized Starr for withholding these findings, as well as the Whitewater one, until after the 1998 Congressional elections. Convictions The Clintons were never charged with any crime. Fifteen other people were convicted of more than 40 crimes, including Jim Guy Tucker, who resigned from office.\\"Caught in the Whitewater Quagmire\\", Washington Post, August 28, 1995; Page A01] * Jim Guy Tucker: Governor of Arkansas at the time, resigned (fraud, 3 counts) * John Haley: attorney for Jim Guy Tucker (tax evasion) * William J.

Accessed April 30, 2007. Due to the age of the mistake, the Clintons were not obligated to make good the error, but Bill Clinton announced that they would nonetheless do so. Deputy White House counsel Vince Foster looked into this matter, but did not take any action before his death. On December 28, 1993, almost two years after the original announcement, the Clintons did make a reimbursement payment, for $4,900, to the Internal Revenue Service. This was done just before Justice Department investigators started seeking the Clintons' Whitewater files. The payment was made without filing an amended return (possibly because the three- year period for amended return filing had passed), but did include full interest on the amount of the error, including the additional two-year delay. The Whitewater files in question, publicly released in August 1995, cast some doubt on the Clintons' assertions in the matter, as they showed that the couple was aware that the interest payments in question were paid by the Whitewater corporation, and not them personally. Ray report Kenneth Starr's successor as Independent Counsel, Robert Ray, released a report in September 2000, that stated \\"This office determined that the evidence was insufficient to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that either President or Mrs. Clinton knowingly participated in any criminal conduct.\\" Nevertheless, Ray criticized the White House saying that delays in the production of evidence and \\"unmeritorious litigation\\" by the president's lawyers severely impeded the investigation's progress, leading to a total cost of nearly $60 million. Ray's report effectively closed the Whitewater investigation. Aftermath Bill and Hillary Clinton never visited the actual Whitewater property. In May 1985, Jim McDougal sold the remaining lots of the failed Whitewater Development Corporation to local realtor, Chris Wade. By 1993, there were a few occupied houses on the site, but most of the properties were still for sale. One owner, tired of the many reporters who visited the site, hung a sign saying \\"Go Home, Idiots.\\"Living History, pp. 195‚Äì196. By 2007, there were about 12 houses in the subdivision, with the last lot up for sale by son, Chris Wade, Jr., for $25,000. In Flippin, Arkansas Jim McDougal's savings and loan bank had been replaced by a variety of small businesses, most recently a barbershop. The length, expense, and results of the Whitewater investigations turned the public against the Office of the Independent Counsel; even Kenneth Starr was opposed to it. The Independent Counsel law was allowed to expire in 1999.

Description  Holy Living and Holy Dying is the collective title of two books of Christian devotion by Jeremy Taylor, originally published as The Rules and Exercises of Holy Living in 1650 and The Rules and Exercises of Holy Dying in 1651. The two books represent one of the high points of English prose during the period of the early Stuarts. According to historian Nancy Lee Beaty, Holy Dying was the \\"artistic climax\\" of a consolatory death literature tradition that had begun with Ars moriendi in the 15th century. Other works in this tradition include The Waye of Dying Well and The Sick Mannes Salve. Holy Living is designed to instruct the reader in living a virtuous life, increasing personal piety, and avoiding temptations. Holy Dying is meant to instruct the reader in the \\"means and instruments\\" of preparing for a blessed death. Each book contains discussions of theology, moral instruction, often prefaced as \\"The Consideration reduc'd to practise,\\" and model prayers requesting divine assistance in achieving them.  Morality  Holy Living is largely concerned with questions of practical morality, of a type that has hardly changed from the 17th century to today. The companion volume, Holy Dying, was occasioned by the death of the wife of Taylor's patron and employer, the Earl of Carbery. That book is half Christian instruction and half memorial sermon, with Taylor displaying his gift for poetic prose. Coupled with the 17th century cult of melancholia, the result is prose that is simultaneously stately and rapturous, \\"half in love with easeful death\\", and reads like prose poetry: :But so have I seen a Rose newly springing from the clefts of its hood, and at first it was fair as the Morning, and full with the dew of Heaven, as a Lambs fleece; but when a ruder breath had forced open its virgin modesty, and dismantled its too youthful and unripe retirements, it began to put on a darknesse, and to decline its softnesse, and the symptomes of a sickly age; it bowed the head, and broke its stalk, and at night having lost some of its leaves, and all of its beauty, it fell into the portion of weeds and outworn faces. (See also period (rhetoric)).  Legacy  Taylor's work was much admired by John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, for its devotional quality; and by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Thomas De Quincey, and Edmund Gosse for its literary qualities.

IUF Unicycle Trials Regulations for UNICON X The obstacles traversed can be set up specifically for the purpose of unicycle trials, but are often walls, railings, ledges and other \\"street furniture\\" found in an urban environment. The sport is derived from (or at least inspired by) bike trials and motorcycle trials. Obstacles are traversed using various moves. Hopping is achieved by suddenly forcing the unicycle pedals downwards while holding the seat, the reactive forces resulting from the compression of the tyre lift the unicycle into the air. Jumping is a similar to hopping, except that the unicycle seat is held in front of the rider to allow greater height to be achieved. Pedal grabs and crank grabs involve a hop or jump to land the unicycles pedal or crank on the edge of an object, and then a second hop or jump to land the unicycle fully on the object. Although unicycle trials can be performed on a standard unicycle, many are not designed for the forces which are caused by unicycle trials. A trials unicycle is built with unicycle trials in mind, and is therefore designed to better cope with these stresses. Trials unicycle Nimbus), with a white tire to allow indoor riding Nimbus trial unicycle A trials unicycle is a unicycle designed for unicycle trials. Trials unicycles are stronger than standard unicycles in order to withstand the stresses caused by jumping, dropping, and supporting the weight of the unicycle and rider on components such as the pedals and cranks. The wheel diameter on a trials unicycle is usually 19\\" or 20\\", as this allows greater maneuverability due to the short circumference of the wheel. Most Trials unicycles come with 19\\" rear rims as used on 20\\" (or mod) trials bicycles. This allows for larger tyres to be fitted which can help provide bounce and preload for jumping, and aid stability being generally quite wide (some up to 2.5 inches). A smaller wheel also means the unicycle is lighter, although some riders prefer larger wheels. The tire is generally wide and thick, giving a large air volume. This is to cushion drops and allow large hops and jumps. The tire will often have a deep tread to allow greater grip to obstacles. Strong high tension spokes and a strong rim wheel rim is used to prevent the wheel from deforming under the great stresses exerted on it by jumping. Unicycle wheels have to withstand large lateral stresses because, unlike in conventional riding, the rider may jump sideways. Many trials unicycles have a splined hub and cranks, as this design tends to be more resistant to bending and breaking than the more common cotterless, or square taper, equivalent. Long cranks give the rider extra torque and pedals with a large amount of grip (often with pins or teeth) are used to prevent the rider's feet from slipping. Unicycles with shorter cranks are generally referred to as street unicycles, as they let the rider keep up their momentum easier and do smooth tricks. Whereas Trials unicycles usually have longer cranks that are better for hopping, as the rider has better control of the rotation of the wheel, and can therefore keep the unicycle from slipping out from under him.

After removal of the thick, fibrous brown skin, the white flesh of the root can be eaten cooked or raw. Crisp, moist, and slightly sweet, the flesh draws comparison with that of the apple. The plant produces seeds that are comparable to lima beans, and that are sometimes eaten when young in places where the jicama is native.

The Argentine poet Alejandra Pizarnik and the Brazilian writer Clarice Lispector also wrote prose poems in Spanish. Translator Dennis Keene presented the work of six Japanese prose poets in The Modern Japanese Prose Poem: an Anthology of Six Poets. Adrian Wanner and Caryl Emerson described the form's growth in Russia in their critical work, Russian Minimalism: From the Prose Poem to the Anti-story. The writings of Syrian poet and writer Francis Marrash (1836‚Äì73) featured the first examples of prose poetry in modern Arabic literature. From the mid-20th century, the great Arab exponent of prose poetry was the Syrian poet Adunis (Ali Ahmad Said Esber, born 1930), a perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature.Robyn Creswell, \\"Hearing Voices: How the doyen of Arabic poetry draws on‚Äîand explodes‚Äîits traditions\\", The New Yorker, 18 & 25 December 2017, pp. 106‚Äì9. The Modernist poet T. S. Eliot wrote vehemently against prose poems. He added to the debate about what defines the genre, writing in his introduction to Djuna Barnes' highly poeticized 1936 novel Nightwood that it could not be classed as \\"poetic prose\\" as it did not show the rhythm or \\"musical pattern\\" of verse. By contrast, other Modernist authors, including Gertrude Stein and Sherwood Anderson, consistently wrote prose poetry. Canadian author Elizabeth Smart's By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept (1945) is a relatively isolated example of mid-20th-century English-language poetic prose. Prose poems made a resurgence in the early 1950s and in the 1960s with American poets Allen Ginsberg, Bob Dylan, Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, Russell Edson, Charles Simic, Robert Bly, John Ashbery, and James Wright. Edson worked principally in this form, and helped give the prose poem a reputation for surrealist wit. Simic won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for his 1989 collection, The World Doesn't End. Since the late 1980s, prose poetry has gained in popularity. Journals have begun specializing in prose poems or microfiction (see External links, below). In the United Kingdom, Stride Books published a 1993 anthology of prose poetry, A Curious Architecture.A Curious Architecture: New British and American Prose Poetry, London, Stride Press, 1993.

Stained glass window in St Mary the Virgin parish church, Iffley, Oxfordshire, made in 1995 The tree of life ( Tiberian: '; Standard: ') is a term mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. In the Book of Genesis, the tree of life is first described in as being \\"in the midst of the Garden of Eden\\" with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (). After the fall of man, \\"lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever\\", cherubim are placed at the east end of the Garden to guard the way to the tree of life. The tree of life has become the subject of some debate as to whether or not the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is the same tree. In the Bible outside of Genesis, the term \\"tree of life\\" appears in Proverbs () and Revelation (). It also appears in 2 Esdras () and 4 Maccabees (), which are included among the Jewish apocrypha.  Number of trees  Karl Budde, in his critical study of 1883, proposed that there was only one tree in the body of the Genesis narrative, and that it had been portrayed in two ways: one as the tree in the middle of the Garden, and two as the forbidden tree. Claus Westermann gave recognition to Budde's theory in 1976. Ellen van Wolde noted that among Bible scholars \\"the trees are almost always dealt with separately and not related to each other\\" and that \\"attention is almost exclusively directed to the tree of knowledge of good and evil, whereas the tree of life is paid hardly any attention.\\" Religious views =Christianity= Gilded royal doors carved to represent the tree of life (old wooden church in Chotyniec, Poland). Eastern Christianity Phillip Medhurst Collection of Bible illustrations in the possession of Revd. Philip De Vere at St. George's Court, Kidderminster, England. The Eastern Orthodox Church has traditionally understood the tree of life in Genesis as a prefiguration of the Cross, which humanity could not partake of until after the incarnation, death and resurrection of Jesus. Western Christianity Mary Assumption parish church in P√ºhret (Neustift i.M., Upper Austria): Altar of Virgin Mary: Image of Madonna with Child (1900). In The City of God (xiii.20-21), Augustine of Hippo offers great allowance for \\"spiritual\\" interpretations of the events in the garden, so long as such allegories do not rob the narrative of its historical reality. Enlightenment theologians (culminating perhaps in Brunner and Niebuhr in the twentieth century) sought for figurative interpretations because they had already dismissed the historical possibility of the story. Others sought very pragmatic understandings of the tree. In the Summa Theologica (Q97), Thomas Aquinas argued that the tree served to maintain Adam's biological processes for an extended earthly animal life. It did not provide immortality as such, for the tree, being finite, could not grant infinite life. Hence after a period of time, the man and woman would need to eat again from the tree or else be \\"transported to the spiritual life.\\" The common fruit trees of the garden were given to offset the effects of \\"loss of moisture\\" (note the doctrine of the humors at work), while the tree of life was intended to offset the inefficiencies of the body. Following Augustine in the City of God (xiv.26), ‚Äúman was furnished with food against hunger, with drink against thirst, and with the tree of life against the ravages of old age.‚Äù John Calvin (Commentary on Genesis 2:8), following a different thread in Augustine (City of God, xiii.20), understood the tree in sacramental language. Given that humanity cannot exist except within a covenantal relationship with God, and all covenants use symbols to give us \\"the attestation of his grace\\", he gives the tree, \\"not because it could confer on man that life with which he had been previously endued, but in order that it might be a symbol and memorial of the life which he had received from God.\\" God often uses symbols - He doesn‚Äôt transfer his power into these outward signs, but \\"by them He stretches out His hand to us, because, without assistance, we cannot ascend to Him.\\" Thus he intends man, as often as he eats the fruit, to remember the source of his life, and acknowledge that he lives not by his own power, but by God's kindness. Calvin denies (contra Aquinas and without mentioning his name) that the tree served as a biological defense against physical aging. This is the standing interpretation in modern Reformed theology as well. =Judaism= According to Jewish mythology, in the Garden of Eden there is a tree of life or the \\"tree of souls\\" that blossoms and produces new souls, which fall into the Guf, the Treasury of Souls. The Angel Gabriel reaches into the treasury and takes out the first soul that comes into his hand. Then Lailah, the Angel of Conception, watches over the embryo until it is born. Kabbalah The tree of life is represented in several examples of sacred geometry and is central in particular to the Kabbalah, where it is represented as a diagram of ten points. The ten points are known as Sephiroth or Sephirah, or the ten emanations or attributes of God. Kabbalah is an esoteric method, discipline and school of thought in Jewish mysticism.

The sexual relationship took place between 1995 and 1997 and came to light in 1998. Clinton ended a televised speech in late January 1998 with the statement that he \\"did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.\\" Further investigation led to charges of perjury and to the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998 by the U.S. House of Representatives. He was subsequently acquitted on all impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in a 21-day Senate trial. Clinton was held in civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving misleading testimony in the Paula Jones case regarding Lewinsky and was also fined $90,000 by Wright. His license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas for five years; shortly thereafter, he was disbarred from presenting cases in front of the United States Supreme Court. Lewinsky was a graduate of Lewis & Clark College. She was hired during Clinton's first term in 1995 as an intern at the White House and was later an employee of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs. Some believe that Clinton began a personal relationship with her while she worked at the White House, the details of which she later confided to Linda Tripp, her Defense Department co-worker who secretly recorded their telephone conversations. In January 1998, Tripp discovered that Lewinsky had sworn an affidavit in the Paula Jones case, denying a relationship with Clinton. She delivered tapes to Ken Starr, the independent counsel who was investigating Clinton on other matters, including the Whitewater scandal, the White House FBI files controversy, and the White House travel office controversy. During the grand jury testimony, Clinton's responses were carefully worded, and he argued, \\"it depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is,\\" with regard to the truthfulness of his statement that \\"there is not a sexual relationship, an improper sexual relationship or any other kind of improper relationship.\\"President Bill Clinton, The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, January 21, 1998. The wide reporting of the scandal led to criticism of the press for over-coverage. This scandal is sometimes referred to as \\"Monicagate,\\"Rich, Frank. \\"Journal; Monicagate Year Two\\", The New York Times, December 16, 1998. \\"Lewinskygate,\\"Rich, Frank. \\"Journal; Days of the Locust\\", The New York Times, February 25, 1998. \\"Tailgate,\\"Hennenberger, Melinda. \\"The President Under Fire\\", The New York Times, January 29, 1998. \\"Sexgate,\\"James Barron with Hoban, Phoebe. \\"Dueling Soaps\\", The New York Times, January 28, 1998. and \\"Zippergate,\\" following the \\"-gate\\" construction that has been used since Watergate. Allegations of sexual contact Clinton with Lewinsky in February 1997 Monica Lewinsky in May 1997 Lewinsky said she had sexual encounters with Bill Clinton on nine occasions from November 1995 to March 1997. According to her published schedule, First Lady Hillary Clinton was at the White House for at least some portion of seven of those days. In April 1996, Lewinsky's superiors relocated her job to the Pentagon, because they felt she was spending too much time around Clinton.Jeff Leen (January 24, 1998). \\"Lewinsky: Two Coasts, Two Lives, Many Images\\", The Washington Post. According to his autobiography, then-United Nations Ambassador Bill Richardson was asked by the White House in 1997 to interview Lewinsky for a job on his staff at the UN. Richardson did so, and offered her a position, which she declined. The American Spectator alleged that Richardson knew more about the Lewinsky affair than he declared to the grand jury. Lewinsky confided in Linda Tripp about her relationship with Clinton. Tripp persuaded Lewinsky to save the gifts Clinton had given her, and not to dry clean a semen-stained blue dress in order to keep it as an \\"insurance policy.\\" Tripp reported their conversations to literary agent Lucianne Goldberg, who advised her to secretly record them,US News and World Report, \\"The Monica Lewinsky Tapes\\", February 2, 1998, v.124 n.4 p.23. which Tripp began doing in September 1997. Goldberg also urged Tripp to take the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and bring them to the attention of people working on the Paula Jones case. In the fall of 1997, Goldberg began speaking to reporters (including Michael Isikoff of Newsweek) about the tapes. In the Paula Jones case, Lewinsky had submitted an affidavit that denied any physical relationship with Clinton. In January 1998, she attempted to persuade Tripp to commit perjury in the Jones case. Instead, Tripp gave the tapes to Starr, who was investigating the Whitewater controversy and other matters. Starr was now armed with evidence of Lewinsky's admission of a physical relationship with Clinton, and he broadened the investigation to include Lewinsky and her possible perjury in the Jones case. Denial and subsequent admission News of the scandal first broke on January 17, 1998, on the Drudge Report,\\"Newsweek Kills Story On White House Intern\\", DrudgeReportArchives, 1998. which reported that Newsweek editors were sitting on a story by investigative reporter Michael Isikoff exposing the affair. The story broke in the mainstream press on January 21 in The Washington Post. The story swirled for several days and, despite swift denials from Clinton, the clamor for answers from the White House grew louder. On January 26, President Clinton, standing with his wife, spoke at a White House press conference, and issued a denial in which he said:Top 5: Political Quotes That Defined Presidencies, APOLITICUS.COM Pundits debated whether Clinton would address the allegations in his State of the Union Address. Ultimately, he chose not to mention them. Hillary Clinton remained supportive of her husband throughout the scandal, despite the betrayal and public humiliation. On January 27, in an appearance on NBC's Today she said, \\"The great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.\\" For the next several months and through the summer, the media debated whether an affair had occurred and whether Clinton had lied or obstructed justice, but nothing could be definitively established beyond the taped recordings because Lewinsky was unwilling to discuss the affair or testify about it. On July 28, 1998, a substantial delay after the public break of the scandal, Lewinsky received transactional immunity in exchange for grand jury testimony concerning her relationship with Clinton. She also turned over a semen-stained blue dress (which Linda Tripp had encouraged her to save without dry cleaning) to the Starr investigators, thereby providing unambiguous DNA evidence that could prove the relationship despite Clinton's official denials. Clinton admitted in taped grand jury testimony on August 17, 1998, that he had engaged in an \\"improper physical relationship\\" with Lewinsky. That evening he gave a nationally televised statement admitting that his relationship with Lewinsky was \\"not appropriate\\".Clinton, Bill. Address to the nation, PBS.org, August 17, 1998. AP Archive (July 21, 2015). On August 20, 1998, three days after Clinton testified on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Operation Infinite Reach launched missiles against al-Qaeda bases in Khost, Afghanistan, and the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum, Sudan. Some countries, media outlets, protesters, and Republicans accused Clinton of ordering the attacks as a diversion. The attacks also drew parallels to the then-recently released movie Wag the Dog, which features a fictional president faking a war in Albania to distract attention from a sex scandal. Administration officials denied any connection between the missile strikes and the ongoing scandal, and 9/11 Commission investigators found no reason to dispute those statements.9/11 Commission Report, p. 118. Perjury charges In his deposition for the Jones lawsuit, Clinton denied having sexual relations with Lewinsky. Based on the evidence‚Äîa blue dress with Clinton's semen that Lewinsky provided‚ÄîStarr concluded that the president's sworn testimony was false and perjurious. During the deposition, Clinton was asked \\"Have you ever had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit1?\\" The judge ordered that Clinton be given an opportunity to review the agreed definition. Afterwards, based on the definition created by the Independent Counsel's Office, Clinton answered, \\"I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.\\" Clinton later said, \\"I thought the definition included any activity by [me], where [I] was the actor and came in contact with those parts of the bodies\\" which had been explicitly listed (and \\"with an intent to gratify or arouse the sexual desire of any person\\"). In other words, Clinton denied that he had ever contacted Lewinsky's \\"genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks\\", and effectively claimed that the agreed-upon definition of \\"sexual relations\\" included giving oral sex but excluded receiving oral sex.Tiersma, Peter. \\"The Language of Perjury\\", languageandlaw.org, November 20, 2007. Two months after the Senate failed to convict him, President Clinton was held in civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving misleading testimony regarding his sexual relationship with Lewinsky, and was also fined $90,000 by Wright. Clinton declined to appeal the civil contempt of court ruling, citing financial problems, but still maintained that his testimony complied with Wright's earlier definition of sexual relations. In 2001, his license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas for five years and later by the United States Supreme Court. Impeachment In December 1998, Clinton's Democratic political party was in the minority in both chambers of Congress. A few Democratic members of Congress, and most in the opposition Republican Party, claimed that Clinton's giving false testimony and allegedly influencing Lewinsky's testimony were crimes of obstruction of justice and perjury and thus impeachable offenses. After a delay due to a brief bombing campaign in Iraq, the House of Representatives voted to issue Articles of Impeachment against him which was followed by a 21-day trial in the Senate. All the Democrats in the Senate voted for acquittal on both the perjury and the obstruction of justice charges. Ten Republicans voted for acquittal for perjury: John Chafee (Rhode Island), Susan Collins (Maine), Slade Gorton (Washington), Jim Jeffords (Vermont), Richard Shelby (Alabama), Olympia Snowe (Maine), Arlen Specter (Pennsylvania), Ted Stevens (Alaska), Fred Thompson (Tennessee), and John Warner (Virginia). Five Republicans voted for acquittal for obstruction of justice: Chafee, Collins, Jeffords, Snowe, and Specter. President Clinton was thereby acquitted of all charges and remained in office. There were attempts to censure the president by the House of Representatives, but those attempts failed. Aftermath =Effect on 2000 presidential election= The scandal arguably affected the 2000 U.S. presidential election in two contradictory ways. Democratic Party candidate and sitting vice president Al Gore said that Clinton's scandal had been \\"a drag\\" that deflated the enthusiasm of their party's base, and had the effect of reducing Democratic votes. Clinton said the scandal had made Gore's campaign too cautious, and that if Clinton had been allowed to campaign for Gore in Arkansas and New Hampshire, either state would have delivered Gore's needed electoral votes regardless of the effects of the Florida recount controversy. Political analysts have supported both views. Before and after the 2000 election, John Cochran of ABC News connected the Lewinsky scandal with a voter phenomenon he called \\"Clinton fatigue\\". Polling showed that the scandal continued to affect Clinton's low personal approval ratings through the election, and analysts such as Vanderbilt University's John G. Geer later concluded \\"Clinton fatigue or a kind of moral retrospective voting had a significant impact on Gore's chances\\". Other analysts sided with Clinton's argument, and argued that Gore's refusal to have Clinton campaign with him damaged his appeal.An anatomy of 2000 USA presidential election , NigerDeltaCongress.comBeyond the Recounts: Trends in the 2000 US Presidential Election, Cairn.info =Collateral scandals= During the scandal, supporters of former President Clinton alleged that the matter should remain private, and called some supporting Clinton's impeachment hypocritical. A highly publicized investigation campaign actively sought information that might embarrass politicians who supported impeachment. According to the British newspaper The Guardian, Henry Hyde, Republican Chair of the House Judiciary Committee and lead House manager, also had an affair while in office as a state legislator. Hyde, aged 70 during the Lewinsky hearings, dismissed it as a \\"youthful indiscretion\\" (he had been 41).Talbot, David. \\"This hypocrite broke up my family\\", Salon, September 16, 1998.

Another clear conceptualization is made by Block, who stated that \\"Conceptually, the diagnosis is a compulsive-impulsive spectrum disorder that involves online and/or offline computer usage and consists of at least three subtypes: excessive gaming, sexual preoccupations, and e-mail/text messaging\\". Computer addiction is not currently included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as an official disorder. The concept of computer addiction is broadly divided into two types, namely offline computer addiction and online computer addiction. Offline computer addiction is normally used when speaking about excessive gaming behavior, which can be practiced both offline and online. Online computer addiction, also known as Internet addiction, gets more attention in general from scientific research than offline computer addiction, mainly because most cases of computer addiction are related to the excessive use of the Internet. Experts on Internet addiction have described this syndrome as an individual working intensely on the Internet, prolonged use of the Internet, uncontrollable use of the Internet, unable to use the internet in an efficient, timely matter, not being interested in the outside world, not spending time with people from the outside world, and an increase in their loneliness and dejection. Symptoms *Being drawn by the computer as soon as one wakes up and before one goes to bed. *Replacing old hobbies with excessive use of the computer and using the computer as one's primary source of entertainment and procrastination *Lacking physical exercise and/or outdoor exposure because of constant use of the computer, which could contribute to many health problems such as obesity Effects Excessive computer use may result in, or occur with: * Lack of face to face social interaction * Computer vision syndrome Causes Kimberly Young indicates that previous research links internet/computer addiction with existing mental health issues, most notably depression. She states that computer addiction has significant effects socially such as low self-esteem, psychologically and occupationally which led many subjects to academic failure. According to a Korean study on internet/computer addiction, pathological use of the internet results in negative life impacts such as job loss, marriage breakdown, financial debt, and academic failure. 70% of internet users in Korea are reported to play online games, 18% of which are diagnosed as game addicts which relates to internet/computer addiction. The authors of the article conducted a study using Kimberly Young's questionnaire. The study showed that the majority of those who met the requirements of internet/computer addiction suffered from interpersonal difficulties and stress and that those addicted to online games specifically responded that they hoped to avoid reality. Types Computers nowadays rely almost entirely on the internet and thus relevant research articles relating to internet addiction may also be relevant to computer addiction. * Gaming addiction: a hypothetical behavioral addiction characterized by excessive or compulsive use of computer games or video games, which interferes with a person's everyday life. Video game addiction may present itself as compulsive gaming, social isolation, mood swings, diminished imagination, and hyper-focus on in-game achievements, to the exclusion of other events in life. * Social media addiction: Data suggest that participants use social media to fulfill their social needs, but are typically dissatisfied. Lonely individuals are drawn to the Internet for emotional support. This could interfere with \\"real life socializing\\" by reducing face-to-face relationships. Some of these views are summed up in an Atlantic article by Stephen Marche entitled Is Facebook Making Us Lonely?, in which the author argues that social media provides more breadth, but not the depth of relationships that humans require and that users begin to find it difficult to distinguish between the meaningful relationships which we foster in the real world, and the numerous casual relationships that are formed through social media.  Diagnostic Test Many studies and surveys are being conducted to measure the extent of this type of addiction. Kimberly Young has created a questionnaire based on other disorders to assess the level of addiction. It is called the Internet Addict Diagnostic Questionnaire or IADQ. The questionnaire asks users about their online usage habits as well as their feelings about their internet usage. According to the IADQ sample, Internet Addiction resembles that of a Gambling disorder. Answering positively to five out of the eight questions on the IADQ may be indicative of an online addiction. Origin of the term and history Observations about the addictiveness of computers and more specifically computer games date back at least to the mid 1970s. Addiction and addictive behavior was common among the users of the PLATO system at the University of Illinois.Brian Dear, Chapter 21 -- Coming of Age, The Friendly Orange Glow, Pantheon Books, New York, 2017; see pages 381-387 for a discussion of addiction on PLATO, page 382 quotes a 1975 article from The Daily Illini that discusses the subject. British e-learning academic Nicholas Rushby suggested in his 1979 book, An Introduction to Educational Computing, that people can be addicted to computers and suffer withdrawal symptoms. The term was also used by M. Shotton in 1989 in her book Computer Addiction. However, Shotton concludes that the 'addicts' are not truly addicted. Dependency on computers, she argues, is better understood as a challenging and exiting pastime that can also lead to a professional career in the field. Computers do not turn gregarious, extroverted people into recluses; instead they offer introverts a source of inspiration, excitement and intellectual stimulation. Shotton's work seriously questions the legitimacy of the claim that computers cause addiction. The term became more widespread with the explosive growth of the Internet, as well the availability of the personal computer. Computers and the Internet both started to take shape as a personal and comfortable medium which could be used by anyone who wanted to make use of it. With that explosive growth of individuals making use of PCs and the Internet, the question started to arise whether or not misuse or excessive use of these new technologies could be possible as well. It was hypothesized that, like any technology aimed specifically at human consumption and use, that abuse could have severe consequences for the individual in the short term and for the society in the long term. In the late nineties people who made use of PCs and the internet where already referred to the term webaholics or cyberholics. Pratarelli et al. suggested at that point already to label \\"a cluster of behaviors potentially causing problems\\" as computer or Internet addiction. There are other examples of computer overuse that date back to the earliest computer games. Press reports have furthermore noted that some Finnish Defence Forces conscripts were not mature enough to meet the demands of military life, and were required to interrupt or postpone military service for a year. One reported source of the lack of needed social skills is overuse of computer games or the Internet. Forbes termed this overuse \\"Web fixations\\", and stated that they were responsible for 12 such interruptions or deferrals over the 5 years from 2000‚Äì2005.

It was his first book and was published by Houghton Mifflin. In addition to the title novella, set in Short Hills, New Jersey, Goodbye, Columbus contains the five short stories \\"The Conversion of the Jews\\", \\"Defender of the Faith\\", \\"Epstein\\", \\"You Can't Tell a Man by the Song He Sings\\", and \\"Eli, the Fanatic\\". Each story deals with the concerns of second and third-generation assimilated American Jews as they leave the ethnic ghettos of their parents and grandparents and go on to college, to white-collar professions, and to life in the suburbs. The book was a critical success for Roth and won the 1960 U.S. National Book Award for Fiction.\\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1960\\". Retrieved 2012-03-30. There is a link there to Roth's acceptance speech. The National Book Awards blog for the 50th anniversary of Goodbye, Columbus is essays by five writers about the book. The annual awards are made by the National Book Foundation. The book was not without controversy, as people within the Jewish community took issue with Roth's less than flattering portrayal of some characters.Zucker, David J. \\"Roth, Rushdie, and rage: religious reactions to Portnoy and The Verses.\\" BNET. 2008. 17 July 2010. The short story Defender of the Faith, about a Jewish sergeant who is exploited by three shirking, coreligionist draftees, drew particular ire. When Roth in 1962 appeared on a panel alongside the distinguished black novelist Ralph Ellison to discuss minority representation in literature, the questions directed at him became denunciations.Kaplan, Justin (September 25, 1988). \\"Play It Again, Nathan\\". The New York Times. Many accused Roth of being a self-hating Jew, a label that stuck with him for years.\\"Profile: Philip Roth: Literary hit man with a 9/11 bullet in his gun.\\" The Times. 19 September 2004. 17 July 2010. The title novella was made into the 1969 film Goodbye, Columbus, starring Ali MacGraw and Richard Benjamin. Roth's own retrospective reckoning Roth wrote in the preface to the book's 30th anniversary edition: > \\"With clarity and with crudeness, and a great deal of exuberance, the > embryonic writer who was me wrote these stories in his early 20s, while he > was a graduate student at the University of Chicago, a soldier stationed in > New Jersey and Washington, and a novice English instructor back at Chicago > following his Army discharge...In the beginning it amazed him that any > literate audience could seriously be interested in his story of tribal > secrets, in what he knew, as a child of his neighborhood, about the rites > and taboos of his clan‚Äîabout their aversions, their aspirations, their fears > of deviance and defection, their embarrassments and ideas of success.\\" The novella =Its story and themes= The title story of the collection, Goodbye, Columbus, was an irreverent look at the life of middle-class Jewish Americans, satirizing, according to one reviewer, their \\"complacency, parochialism, and materialism.\\" It was controversial with reviewers, who were highly polarized in their judgments. The story is told by the narrator, Neil Klugman, who is working in a low-paying position in the Newark Public Library. He lives with his Aunt Gladys and Uncle Max in a working-class neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey. One summer, Neil meets and falls for Brenda Patimkin, a student at Radcliffe College who is from a wealthy family living in the affluent suburb of Short Hills. The novella explores the classism which afflicts the relationship, despite the fact that Brenda's father, Ben, came from the same environment as Neil. The issue of ethnic assimilation is intrinsic, as Brenda is more assimilated than Neil. =Its title= The title ‚ÄúGoodbye, Columbus‚Äù is a quote from a song that was sung by the departing seniors, including Brenda's brother, Ron, at their graduation from the Ohio State University at Columbus. Ron dearly enjoys listening to a record of the song that evokes his years as a varsity athlete on a campus where sports are big. By listening to the record for a few years and later having Neil listen along, he is given continuing proof of the Patimkins' success at assimilation. As the story proceeds, Neil finds that his relationship with Brenda is falling apart. Thus, the alma-mater nostalgia of the novella's title can be heard as a choral parallel to Neil's saying goodbye to the affluent, assimilated world of the Patimkins and, in his unreported future, remembering, re-evaluating and possibly, in low moments or periods, missing it and them. A New York Yiddish theater song of 1926 (seven years before Philip Roth's birth) includes lyrics whose translation is \\"I‚Äôm going home....I‚Äôm going to Palestine....Goodbye, Columbus.\\"The Zionist Yiddish song‚Äôs title is ‚ÄúIkh For Aheym‚Äù (English translation: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going home‚Äù). There is an English-subtitled video of a performance of the song in 2014 by singer Jane Peppler and pianist Roger Spears that includes the chorus and first and fourth of the four stanzas. The words and music were written by David Meyerowitz a.k.a. Meyerovitz (1867-1943), who immigrated from Latvia to New York City in either 1880 or 1890. The lyrics whose translation is the title of Roth‚Äôs novella are the first line of the final stanza: ‚ÄúZay gezunt, Kolumbes.‚Äù Translation of some of the other lyrics of this song: ‚ÄúThe Exile has ended, and now I‚Äôm going back....as my grandfather wanted to do....I don‚Äôt want to be a foreigner anymore....I‚Äôm not staying anymore at someone or other's place....What have I got to lose?...If you‚Äôre talking about girls, you can take my word: All you get here is cute skirts; but real fabric/merchandise is gotten there....Keep drinking ice cream soda; I will drink the wine of Mount Carmel.‚Äù The flair, high-hattiness and bite of some of the lyrics‚Äîespecially, the line that became the title of the novella‚Äîwould have appealed to Neil Klugman and the very young Philip Roth. We can safely assume that when Roth decided on a title for it, he realized that the percentage of the subscribers to the Paris Review (in which the novella came out in 1958) and the percentage of the readers of any book in which it would later be published who had heard the Yiddish song‚Äîwhich isn't quoted or mentioned in the novella‚Äîin 1926 or later and also remembered its fourth stanza would be a very small minority of the novella‚Äôs audience. We can safely assume that he expected them to feel privileged or self- congratulatory at the expense of readers the title would perplex. The rhythm of this Jewish song is that of a march. The novella‚Äôs title restates or points at the proud and emotional rejection of assimilation that was belted out in this song by an East-European Jew who had immigrated to the U.S. This song's Columbus is not a campus but rather the man who induced Europeans to follow him to America, and its \\"Goodbye\\" (unlike the one in the college song) is neither a sentimental summation nor a grateful or admiring one. The title functions as a trick: to tempt and enable a reader to simultaneously hear the point that is made by \\"Goodbye\\" in each of the two songs (two incompatible points), while watching Neil ambivalently and uncomfortably tip back and forth between the two of them, and to simultaneously feel those attitudes and Roth's attitudes toward them, in order to see, among other things, the incompleteness and distortedness of each of the three goodbye-sayers' view of what he is saying goodbye to. It is a magic trick, though not of the kind that stops the members of a magician's audience from glimpsing what is happening two feet away from what they have all fixed their gaze on. Quite the contrary: The trick illuminates what is murky and unconscious. The short stories =\\"The Conversion of the Jews\\"= This short story, which first appeared in The Paris Review in 1958, deals with the themes of questioning religion and being violent to one another because of it. Ozzie Freedman, a Jewish-American boy about thirteen years old, confronts his Hebrew school teacher, Rabbi Binder, with challenging questions: especially, whether it is possible that God gave the Virgin Mary a child without having intercourse. Rabbi Binder interprets Ozzie's question about the virgin birth as impertinent, though Ozzie sincerely wishes to better understand God and his faith. When Ozzie continues to ask challenging questions, Binder slaps him on the face, accidentally bloodying Ozzie's nose. Ozzie calls Binder a bastard and, without thinking, runs to the roof of the synagogue. Once there, Ozzie threatens to jump. The rabbi and pupils go out to watch Ozzie from the pavement and try to convince him not to leap. Ozzie's mother arrives. Ozzie threatens to jump unless they all bow on their knees in the Christian tradition and admit that God can make a virgin birth, and furthermore, that they believe in Jesus Christ; he then admonishes all those present that they should never \\"hit anyone about God\\". He finally ends by jumping off the roof onto a glowing yellow net held by firemen. =\\"Defender of the Faith\\"= The story‚Äîoriginally published in The New Yorker‚Äîdeals with a Jewish American army sergeant who resists the attempted manipulation of a fellow Jew to exploit their mutual ethnicity to receive special favours. The story caused consternation among Jewish readers and religious groups, as recounted in chapter five of Roth's 1988 memoir The Facts: A Novelist's Autobiography.Philip Roth, The Facts: A Novelist's Autobiography, New York: Farrar Straus & Giroux, 1988. =\\"Epstein\\"= The title character goes through a crisis, feeling at age fifty-nine that by accepting the responsibilities of business, marriage, and parenthood, he has missed out on life, and starts an affair with another woman. =\\"You Can't Tell a Man by the Song He Sings\\"= An unnamed narrator recalls the events surrounding his meeting with Alberto Pelagutti, a troublemaker, in high school. =\\"Eli, the Fanatic\\"= The assimilated Jews of a small community express fear that their peaceful coexistence with the Gentiles will be disturbed by the establishment of an Orthodox yeshiva in their neighborhood.

The massacre was prompted by the presence of Albanian separatist activity in the region, and perpetrated by Serbian security forces. The Serbian government refused to let a war crimes prosecutor visit the site, and maintained that the casualties were all members of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) killed in combat with state security forces. The killings were investigated by two separate forensic teams, the first a joint Yugoslav‚ÄìBelarusian team and the second an external Finnish team representing the EU. The first team's report, which was commissioned by the Yugoslav government, concluded that those killed, who included a woman and 12-year-old child, were all separatist guerrillas and not civilians. The findings of the second team, however, sharply contradicted the Yugoslav investigation's report, determining that the deaths constituted unarmed citizen killings. The lead Finnish investigator, anthropology expert Dr. Helena Ranta, called it a \\"crime against humanity\\", though refusing as a scientist to directly label it a massacre or assign blame to any specific party. Many of the details of the Finnish team's findings were left undisclosed for two years, for fear that it would negatively impact tribunal proceedings in the Netherlands, seeking to punish Yugoslavian president Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá for alleged war crimes. At the time, reporting of the incident varied from publication to publication and country to country. Media outlets covering it more definitively described the event at Raƒçak as a gruesome terrorist atrocity by a repressive Serbian government. Bill Clinton, then president of the United States, condemned the massacre as a deliberate and indiscriminate act of murder, and the administration launched a \\"propaganda blitz\\" in order to convince the American people that intervention in Yugoslavia was necessary. Public support for intervention among Americans remained at only about 50%, even after the extensive media attention of Raƒçak, denoting that war with Yugoslavia would be significantly less popular than previous conflicts and interventions the US undertook in its recent history. Regardless, the actions taken and bloodshed at Raƒçak represented a \\"turning point in the war\\", drawing sympathy from several nations worldwide, and ultimately played a major role in NATO's decision to mount an organized military operation known as Operation Noble Anvil against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. NATO's involvement in the Kosovo conflict in the months postdating the Raƒçak incident altogether lasted 78 days and consisted of a series of tactical airstrikes against critical targets of military or strategic import. The bombardments led to possibly over 1000 Yugoslavian security forces deaths, several hundred civilian collateral deaths, billions of dollars worth of public and private-sector damage to infrastructure, the deterioration of Serbian leverage in Kosovo, and a mass withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from the region. A memorial exists to the victims of the massacre at Raƒçak. Kosovo annually holds a ceremony to honour the victims of the massacre. Background Raƒçak is a small Albanian- inhabited village in the ≈†timlje municipality of southern Kosovo. By 1998 it had become the scene of activity by the Albanian separatist organization Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). It had a population of around 2,000 people prior to the displacement of most of its inhabitants during Yugoslav military activity in the summer of 1998. By January 1999, around 350 people were reported by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to be living in the village. The KLA was highly active in the region and almost certainly had a presence in Raƒçak itself, with a base near a local power plant.Kosovo/Kosova: As Seen, As Told, \\"Part V: The Municipalities - Stimlje/Shtime\\", OSCE, 1999 On 8 and 10 January, the KLA mounted attacks on Serbian police posts in the neighboring municipalities of Suva Reka and Uro≈°evac, killing four Serbian policemen. In response, Yugoslav security forces established a security cordon in the immediate area of the attacks and around Raƒçak and its neighboring communities. Reports On 15 January, reports were received by the Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM), an unarmed observer force from the OSCE, of civilians being killed in Raƒçak. KVM monitors attempted to gain access to the area but were refused permission by security forces despite strong protests. Instead, they watched the fighting from a nearby hill. They later gained access to the village, where they found one dead man and a number of injured people and received reports of other deaths and of people being taken away by the Serbian security forces. They were denied permission to interview the villagers or explore the area around the village. The monitors finally gained access to the surrounding area on 16 January. Accompanied by a number of foreign journalists and members of the European Union's Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission (KDOM), they found a total of 40 bodies in and around the village. Another five bodies had allegedly been removed by family members. In all, 45 were reported killed, including a 12-year-old boy and three women. All had been shot and the KVM team reported that it found several bodies decapitated. KVM head William Walker later described what he had seen: :\\"In a gully above the village, I saw the first body. It was covered with a blanket, and when it was pulled back, I saw there was no head on the corpse ‚Äî just an incredibly bloody mess on the neck. Someone told me that the skull was on the other side of the gully and asked if I wanted to see that. But I said, \\"No, I've pretty much got this story.\\" [Three more bodies were found.] They looked like older men, with gray hair or white hair ... They had wounds on their heads, and there was blood on their clothes. [Then a larger group of bodies.] I didn't count them. I just looked and saw a lot of holes in the head - in the top of the head and the back of the head. A couple had what appeared to be bullet wounds knocking out their eyes. I was told there were other bodies further up and over the crest of the hill, and I was asked by journalists and inspectors if I was going to go up and see the rest. I said, 'I've seen enough.'\\"Quoted by Ivo H. Daalder, Michael E. O'Hanlon, Winning Ugly: NATO's War to Save Kosovo, pp. 63-64. Brookings Institution Press, 2001. Walker immediately condemned what he labelled \\"an unspeakable atrocity\\" which was \\"a crime very much against humanity\\".\\"Nato crisis talks on massacre\\", BBC News, January 17, 1999 He told the party of journalists accompanying him: \\"I do not hesitate to accuse the (Serb) government security forces. We want to know who gave the orders, and who carried them out. I will insist that justice will be done. They certainly didn't deserve to die in circumstances like this.\\" The journalists also provided first-hand accounts of the discovery of the bodies. One of them, the BBC's reporter Jacky Rowland, reported that the dead \\"were all ordinary men; farmers, labourers, villagers. They had all been shot in the head.\\"Jacky Rowland. \\"Kosovo massacre: 'A twisted mass of bodies'\\" BBC News, 16 January 1999 The dead were aged from 14 to 99 years old.\\"Kosovo: a divided land where hatred is passed down the generations\\". The Times, 8 December 2007 ITN's correspondent Bill Neely was also present and described how other KVM monitors reacted at the scene: \\"A Swedish monitor notes that the dead are all in civilian clothes and unarmed and that there are no signs of a battle... After working for two hours one monitor, a London police officer, tells me he believes many of the victims have been shot at close range.\\"Bill Neely. \\"Serbs rewrite history of Raƒçak massacre\\", The Independent, 23 January 1999 Two days later, on 18 January, the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Louise Arbour, attempted to enter Kosovo to investigate the killings but was refused access by Serbian authorities.\\"Serbs snub massacre probe\\", BBC News, 19 January 1999 On the same day, heavily armed Serbian police entered Raƒçak under fire from the KLA, and removed the bodies, taking them to a morgue in Pristina to await a forensic examination.Tom Walker. \\"Serbs take village massacre bodies\\", The Times, 19 January 1999 A joint Yugoslavian-Belarusian team of pathologists conducted post-mortems at the end of January. A Finnish forensic team working for the European Union subsequently conducted a second post-mortem, which was more detailed but less contemporaneous than the first. The bodies were finally released to the families and buried on 10 February.\\"Kosovo bodies returned\\". Irish Times, 11 February 1999 Investigations The killings at Raƒçak became the focus of an investigation by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. In its indictment of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and four other senior Yugoslav and Serbian officials, the ICTY's Chief Prosecutor stated that: Eyewitness reports from the surviving villagers unanimously supported the account of a massacre. The British journalist Julius Strauss, writing for the Daily Telegraph, described how he had \\"spent more than a week collecting evidence on the Raƒçak massacre from Albanian witnesses, Western monitors and diplomats and a few Serbian sources who spoke privately and at some risk.\\"Julius Strauss. \\"Massacre that started long haul to justice\\". Daily Telegraph, 26 June 2001 According to the survivors that he interviewed, \\"a small group of men dressed all in black and wearing gloves and balaclavas ... co-ordinated the attack on the village and the subsequent executions.\\" Men had been separated from women and children before being led away to be executed. One survivor told him that \\"some of the Serbs were in blue, some in black. The men in black appeared to be in control and wore balaclavas over their heads. Some had uniforms with insignia which included a Serbian flag; some had none. They carried automatic guns and, as we were led up the hill, both units started shooting us.\\" Strauss speculated that the men had been from the Specijalna Antiteroristiƒçka Jedinica, the Serbian Interior Ministry's elite anti-terrorist unit.Julius Strauss. \\"Military 'death squads' behind Kosovo massacre\\".

The Guardian, 15 February 2002 The Serbian government rejected this version of events. On the day after the killings, the Serbian Interior Ministry issued a statement asserting that its police units had come under fire from \\"ethnic Albanian terrorist groups ... on routes leading to Raƒçak village in the Stimlje municipality.\\" In the subsequent counter-attack \\"several dozen terrorists were killed in the clashes with the police. Most of them were in uniforms bearing the insignia of the ethnic Albanian terrorist organization calling itself the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).\\" \\"Serbs say terrorists killed at Raƒçak\\". Report by state news agency Tanjug, translated by BBC Monitoring. 16 January 1999 They received some support from the French newspapers Le Figaro and Le Monde, which suggested that the KLA could have fabricated evidence. A film crew working for the Associated Press accompanied the Serbian forces in Raƒçak for part of 15 January. Two French journalists from the Agence France Press and Le Figaro interviewed the cameramen and saw at least some of the footage, from which they concluded that it was possible that the KLA could have staged the massacre, and that \\"only a credible international inquiry would make it possible to resolve those doubts.\\" According to the paper, :\\"It was in fact an empty village that the police entered in the morning, sticking close to the walls. The shooting was intense, as they were fired on from KLA trenches dug into the hillside. The fighting intensified sharply on the hilltops above the village. Watching from below, next to the mosque, the AP journalists understood that the KLA guerrillas, encircled, were trying desperately to break out. A score of them in fact succeeded, as the police themselves admitted.\\"Rene Girard: \\"The images filmed during the attack on the village of Raƒçak contradict the Albanians' and the OSCE's version\\", Le Figaro, 20 January 1999 Another French journalist writing for Le Monde, Christophe Chatelot, gave an account from the perspective of the two AP journalists: :\\"When at 10 a.m. they entered the village in the wake of a police armored vehicle, the village was nearly deserted. They advanced through the streets under the fire of the Kosovo Liberation Army (UCK) fighters lying in ambush in the woods above the village. The exchange of fire continued throughout the operation, with more or less intensity. The main fighting took place in the woods. The Albanians who had fled the village when the first Serb shells were fired at dawn tried to escape. There they ran into Serbian police who had surrounded the village. The UCK was trapped in between. The object of the violent police attack on Friday was a stronghold of UCK Albanian independence fighters. Virtually all the inhabitants had fled Raƒçak during the frightful Serb offensive of the summer of 1998. With few exceptions, they had not come back. 'Smoke came from only two chimneys,' noted one of the two AP TV reporters.\\"Christophe Chatelot: \\"Were the Raƒçak dead really coldly massacred?\\", Le Monde, 21 January 1999 The Serbian President, Milan Milutinoviƒá, accused the KVM head William Walker of fabricating the killings \\"by securing the co-operation of his proteg√©s in the Kosovo Liberation Army\\".\\"Serbs launch war of words against US\\". Financial Times, 18 January 1999 The Serbian media took a similar line, arguing that the Albanians had removed the KLA uniforms from the bodies and replaced them with civilian clothes. Unnamed French diplomats also criticised Walker for publicly blaming the Serbs for the killings, arguing that he should have waited for a more thorough investigation.\\"Kosovo on the brink, again\\". The Economist, 23 January 1999. The Yugoslav government declared Walker to be persona non grata and demanded that he leave the territory of Yugoslavia within 48 hours. At the end of January 1999, the United States was reported to have leaked telephone intercepts that were said to prove the role of the Serb government in the killings. According to the Washington Post, the intercepts showed that the Serb government had ordered security forces to \\"go in hard\\" to the Raƒçak area. Deputy Prime Minister Nikola ≈†ainoviƒá and Interior Ministry General Sreten Lukiƒá reportedly expressed concern about reaction to the Raƒçak assault and discussed how to make the killings at Raƒçak appear to be the result of combat between government troops and KLA rebels. On the day of the attack on Raƒçak, Sainoviƒá was aware that the assault was underway and asked how many people had been killed. Lukiƒá replied that as of that moment the tally stood at 22. Following the international uproar about the killings, Sainoviƒá told Lukiƒá to re-enter Raƒçak and retrieve the bodies. He also told Lukiƒá that the ICTY prosecutor Louise Arbour was not to be allowed into the country.R. Jeffrey Smith. \\"Serbs Tried To Cover Up Massacre; Kosovo Reprisal Plot Bared by Phone Taps\\". Washington Post, 28 January 1999 =Forensic reports= Three forensic examinations were carried out on the bodies, by separate teams from FR Yugoslavia, Belarus (at the time an ally of Serbia) and Finland (under the auspices of the European Union).https://web.archive.org/web/19991116063236/http://www.usia.gov/regional/eur/balkans/kosovo/texts/racak.htm EU Forensic Expert Team report All three examinations took place in controversial circumstances; the Yugoslav and Belarusian forensic teams carried out their autopsies against the opposition of the KVM and ICTY, which had demanded that the outside experts from Finland should be the first to carry out post-mortems on the dead. The Yugoslav and Belarusian autopsies were conducted on 19 January under the auspices of the Pristina Forensic Medical Institute. Its director, Professor Sa≈°a Dobriƒçanin, stated that \\"Not a single body bears any sign of execution. The bodies were not massacred.\\" He told the media that he suspected that the bodies had been mutilated posthumously to fabricate the appearance of an execution.\\"Pathologist: 'No Kosovo massacre'\\". BBC News, 19 January 1999 The Finnish (EU) team, headed by pathologist Helena Ranta, began its own autopsy on 21 January\\"Raƒçak killings: Who says what?\\" BBC News, 22 January 1999 and released its initial findings on 17 March. The introduction to the report stressed that it was Ranta's personal view, and not the position of the team. The report concluded that \\"there was no evidence that the victims had been anything other than unarmed civilians and that they had probably been killed where they were later found by the international monitors.\\"\\"Raƒçak killings 'crime against humanity'\\". BBC News, 17 March 1999 Addressing the claims that the dead had been killed wearing KLA uniforms which had then been replaced with civilian clothes, the report states that \\"...the clothing [of the dead] bore no badges or insignia of any military unit. No indication of removal of badges of rank or insignia was evident. Based on autopsy findings (e.g. bullet holes, coagulated blood) and photographs of the scenes, it is highly unlikely that clothes could have been changed or removed.\\"\\"Report of the EU Forensic Team on the Raƒçak Incident\\", 17 March 1999. Quoted in Marc Weller, The Crisis in Kosovo 1989-1999, pp. 333-335. Ranta testified at the subsequent ICTY trial of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, stating that retrieved bullets, bullet casings and entry and exit wounds indicated that the victims were killed where their bodies were found and at approximately the same time. A later Finnish report showed that only one victim had provably been shot at close range. Independent forensic autopsies in an armed conflict: investigation of the victims from Raƒçak, KosovoJ. Rainio, a, K. Lalua, b and A. Penttil√§a The report from the Finnish team, however, was kept confidential by the EU until long after the war, and the team leader, Helena Ranta, issued a press release at the time containing her \\"personal opinion\\" and indicating different findings. Ranta stated that \\"...medicolegal investigations [such as scientific analysis of bodies] cannot give a conclusive answer to the question whether there was [in fact] a battle [between the police and insurgents]...\\", but she leaned towards the victims being non-combatants in part because \\"...no ammunition was found in the pockets\\" of the bodies she investigated. The report was widely understood as saying that the Finnish team had disproved the finding released by the Yugoslav and Belarusian pathologists, whose tests had shown a positive for gunshot residue on the hands of 37 out of the 40 bodies. Criticism was levelled against the paraffin method used by the Yugoslav and Belarusians to test for powder residue on the victims' hands, since it regularly gives false positives for many other substances, including fertilizers, tobacco, urine and cosmetics, and sometimes provides false negatives. The test is still used by the police of many countries who cannot afford more modern methods, but has been described since as early as 1967 as 'of no use scientifically.' Cowan, M. E., Purdon, P. L. A study of the \\"paraffin test.\\" J. Forensic Sci. 12(1): 19-35, 1967. The international reaction to the Yugoslav and Belarusian report on one hand, (which supported the view that those killed were KLA fighters, not civilians as claimed by the Kosovo-Albanians and NATO) and that of the EU expert team on the other (which did not find any evidence to suggest that the dead were combatants) differed considerably, not least in the NATO-countries who were preparing to intervene to stop widespread human rights violations in Kosovo. The former was ignored or dismissed as propaganda, and the latter was accepted as evidence of a massacre against civilians. Several pro-war activists and writers wrote about, and quoted, the Finnish team's press- release. Both reports were used as evidence by the prosecution and also by the defence of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá at his trial, until the Raƒçak case was dropped from the indictment because of lack of evidence. The full report of the EU team was handed over to the ICTY at the end of June 2000. An executive summary was published in 2001, but the full report has never been released publicly.Official Journal of the European Union, C 261 E, 18 September 2001 P. 0069 - 0070 In October 2008 Helena Ranta stated that she had been asked to modify the contents of her report, both by the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and by William Walker, the head of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Kosovo Verification Mission, in order to make it more explicit, she had refused to do so, saying this was \\"a task for the war crimes tribunal‚Äù. Consequences Many western governments, human rights groups and international organisations insisted that the Raƒçak operation was a deliberate massacre, conducted in defiance of earlier Serbian agreements to end the violence in Kosovo. The OSCE, Council of Europe, EU, NATO and the UN Security Council\\"Security Council Strongly Condemns Massacre Of Kosovo Albanians In Southern Kosovo\\", United Nations Security Council Press Release SC/6628, 19 January 1999 all issued strongly worded statements condemning the killings. On January 22, the Contact Group of countries with an interest in Yugoslavia (Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States) issued a joint statement condemning \\"the massacre of Kosovo Albanians in Raƒçak on 15 January. All members expressed their revulsion at this act of mass murder. No amount of provocation could justify it. The Contact Group condemns UCK [KLA] provocations which can only contribute to rising tensions and further violence... The Contact Group also condemns the decisions by the FRY authorities to refuse entry into Kosovo by ICTY Chief Prosecutor Judge Arbour.\\" The Contact Group also called for Yugoslav authorities to \\"work with the International Tribunal to ensure that those responsible for Raƒçak are brought to justice [and] suspend those VJ and MUP officers operating in Raƒçak on 15 January pending the results of this investigation becoming available\\".\\"Contact Group, Chairman's Conclusions, London, 22 January 1999\\", in Heike Krieger, The Kosovo Conflict and International Law: An Analytical Documentation 1974-1999, p. 197. Cambridge University Press, 2001 The UN Security Council and Secretary General on January 31 described the event as a massacre perpetrated by Yugoslav security forces. =ICTY indictment= The ICTY issued a sealed indictment on 27 May 1999 for crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and customs of war against a number of senior Yugoslav officials. These were Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá (President of Yugoslavia), Milan Milutinoviƒá (President of Serbia), Nikola ≈†ainoviƒá (Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister), Dragoljub Ojdaniƒá (Chief of the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army) and Vlajko Stojiljkoviƒá (Serbian Interior Minister). The Raƒçak massacre was added by the ICTY prosecutors in an amended indictment, but was subsequently dropped from the case, due to lack of evidence to support the accusation. Aftermath On June 18, 2001, a court in Pristina sentenced Zoran Stojanoviƒá, a 32-year-old police officer, to 15 years imprisonment for murder and attempted murder in Raƒçak. Stojanoviƒá, a Kosovo Serb, was convicted by a joint UN-Kosovo Albanian panel of judges (two United Nations magistrates and one ethnic Albanian). Stojanoviƒá's trial was highly controversial. It was speedy, one of the first trials by a hastily organized new court. Stojanoviƒá was alleged to have killed one man and wounded two more by firing one bullet. During the trial, according to one UN legal officer, both the international judges and the Albanian judge had considered dismissing the case, but did not do so, allegedly for political reasons. During the trial, some witnesses allegedly presented testimonies that contradicted the forensic evidence, suggesting. The reconstruction of events in Raƒçak for the trial was prevented by two men, who chased off court officials, telling them, \\"we don't want any Serbs in our village.\\" The second reconstruction was prevented by an angry mob of Albanians. A subsequent reconstruction was held without the presence of either the defendant or his lawyer. The prosecutor, Tome Gashe, told the court during the trial that unless Stojanoviƒá were found guilty, the people would \\"take justice in their own hands\\". The trial and sentencing of Stojanoviƒá was criticised by the United Nations and Amnesty International. Zoran Stojanoviƒá was pardoned in 2007 and released from custody. In late 2009, President of Serbia Boris Tadiƒá pardoned Zoran Stojanoviƒá, declaring that the trial was unjust, which opened the question as to whether he had jurisdiction because Stojanoviƒá was sentenced by an international High court. =Denial of the massacre= Serbian politician in Kosovo, Ivan Todosijevic denied the massacre took place, and said that the story was made up by \\"Albanian terrorists\\". In 2019, he was convicted of incitement to ethnic, racial, or religious intolerance and was sentenced to two years in prison by a court in Pristina for making the claims. The Serbian president, Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá supported Todosijevic, claiming that the massacre was indeed made up. This was met with stark reaction from Kosovo Albanian politicians and the civil society. The president of Kosovo, Hashim Tha√ßi said that peace in Balkan will only be established when Serbia expresses shame, and not pride when discussing war crimes. There were reactions by the former prime minister of Kosovo Ramush Haradinaj, former Kosovar minister of foreign affairs Behgjet Pacolli, and the European Commission. The European Commission stated that ‚ÄúDenial and revisionism are contrary to the values of the European Union and are contrary to the project of integration of the Western Balkans into the European Union. Sentencing has to be proportionate and take into account all elements of the case‚Äù.

As such, it differs from a celestial globe, which is a smooth sphere whose principal purpose is to map the constellations. It was invented separately in ancient Greece and ancient China, with later use in the Islamic world and Medieval Europe. With the Earth as center, an armillary sphere is known as Ptolemaic. With the Sun as center, it is known as Copernican. The flag of Portugal features an armillary sphere. The armillary sphere is also featured in Portuguese heraldry, associated with the Portuguese discoveries during the Age of Exploration. In the flag of the Empire of Brazil, the armillary sphere is also featured.  Description and use  This section refers to labels in the diagram below. (Open it in a second window on your screen for easy magnified reference.) Armillary sphere diagram The exterior parts of this machine are a compages [or framework] of brass rings, which represent the principal circles of the heavens. # The equinoctial A, which is divided into 360 degrees (beginning at its intersection with the ecliptic in Aries) for showing the sun's right ascension in degrees; and also into 24 hours, for showing its right ascension in time. # The ecliptic B, which is divided into 12 signs, and each sign into 30 degrees, and also into the months and days of the year; in such a manner, that the degree or point of the ecliptic in which the sun is, on any given day, stands over that day in the circle of months. # The tropic of Cancer C, touching the ecliptic at the beginning of Cancer in e, and the tropic of Capricorn D, touching the ecliptic at the beginning of Capricorn in f; each 23¬Ω degrees from the equinoctial circle. # The Arctic Circle E, and the Antarctic Circle F, each 23¬Ω degrees from its respective pole at N and S. # The equinoctial colure G, passing through the north and south poles of the heaven at N and S, and through the equinoctial points Aries and Libra, in the ecliptic. # The solstitial colure H, passing through the poles of the heaven, and through the solstitial points Cancer and Capricorn, in the ecliptic. Each quarter of the former of these colures is divided into 90 degrees, from the equinoctial to the poles of the world, for showing the declination of the sun, moon, and stars; and each quarter of the latter, from the ecliptic as e and f, to its poles b and d, for showing the latitude of the stars. In the north pole of the ecliptic is a nut b, to which is fixed one end of the quadrantal wire, and to the other end a small sun Y, which is carried round the ecliptic B‚ÄîB, by turning the nut : and in the south pole of the ecliptic is a pin d, on which is another quadrantal wire, with a small moon Œñ upon it, which may be moved round by hand : but there is a particular contrivance for causing the moon to move in an orbit which crosses the ecliptic at an angle of 5‚Öì degrees, to opposite points called the moon's nodes; and also for shifting these points backward in the ecliptic, as the moon's nodes shift in the heaven. Within these circular rings is a small terrestrial globe I, fixed on an axis K, which extends from the north and south poles of the globe at n and s, to those of the celestial sphere at N and S. On this axis is fixed the flat celestial meridian L L, which may be set directly over the meridian of any place on the globe, so as to keep over the same meridian upon it. This flat meridian is graduated the same way as the brass meridian of the common globe, and its use is much the same. To this globe is fitted the movable horizon M, so as to turn upon the two strong wires proceeding from its east and west points to the globe, and entering the globe at the opposite points off its equator, which is a movable brass ring set into the globe in a groove all around its equator. The globe may be turned by hand within this ring, so as to place any given meridian upon it, directly under the celestial meridian L. The horizon is divided into 360 degrees all around its outermost edge, within which are the points of the compass, for showing the amplitude of the sun and the moon, both in degrees and points. The celestial meridian L passes through two notches in the north and south points of the horizon, as in a common globe: both here, if the globe be turned round, the horizon and meridian turn with it. At the south pole of the sphere is a circle of 25 hours, fixed to the rings, and on the axis is an index which goes round that circle, if the globe be turned round its axis. Portrait of Chitasei Go Y≈ç (Wu Yong), by Japanese artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi (1798‚Äì1861) The whole fabric is supported on a pedestal N, and may be elevated or depressed upon the joint O, to any number of degrees from 0 to 90, by means of the arc P, which is fixed in the strong brass arm Q, and slides in the upright piece R, in which is a screw at r, to fix it at any proper elevation. In the box T are two wheels (as in Dr Long's sphere) and two pinions, whose axes come out at V and U; either of which may be turned by the small winch W. When the winch is put upon the axis V, and turn backward, the terrestrial globe, with its horizon and celestial meridian, keep at rest; and the whole sphere of circles turns round from east, by south, to west, carrying the sun Y, and moon Z, round the same way, and causing them to rise above and set below the horizon. But when the winch is put upon the axis U, and turned forward, the sphere with the sun and moon keep at rest; and the earth, with its horizon and meridian, turn round from horizon to the sun and moon, to which these bodies came when the earth kept at rest, and they were carried round it; showing that they rise and set in the same points of the horizon, and at the same times in the hour circle, whether the motion be in the earth or in the heaven. If the earthly globe be turned, the hour-index goes round its hour-circle; but if the sphere be turned, the hour-circle goes round below the index. And so, by this construction, the machine is equally fitted to show either the real motion of the earth, or the apparent motion of the heaven. To rectify the sphere for use, first slacken the screw r in the upright stem R, and taking hold of the arm Q, move it up or down until the given degree of latitude for any place be at the side of the stem R; and then the axis of the sphere will be properly elevated, so as to stand parallel to the axis of the world, if the machine be set north and south by a small compass: this done, count the latitude from the north pole, upon the celestial meridian L, down towards the north notch of the horizon, and set the horizon to that latitude; then, turn the nut b until the sun Y comes to the given day of the year in the ecliptic, and the sun will be at its proper place for that day: find the place of the moon's ascending node, and also the place of the moon, by an Ephemeris, and set them right accordingly: lastly, turn the winch W, until either the sun comes to the meridian L, or until the meridian comes to the sun (according as you want the sphere or earth to move) and set the hour-index to the XII, marked noon, and the whole machine will be rectified. ‚Äî Then turn the winch, and observe when the sun or moon rise and set in the horizon, and the hour- index will show the times thereof for the given day.Elements of the general description incorporate text from the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica First Edition (1771). History =China= The original diagram of Su Song's book of 1092 showing the inner workings of his clocktower; a mechanically rotated armillary sphere crowns the top. Armillary sphere at Beijing Ancient Observatory Throughout Chinese history, astronomers have created celestial globes () to assist the observation of the stars. The Chinese also used the armillary sphere in aiding calendrical computations and calculations. According to Needham, the earliest development of the armillary sphere in China goes back to the astronomers Shi Shen and Gan De in the 4th century BC, as they were equipped with a primitive single-ring armillary instrument.Needham, Volume 3, 343. This would have allowed them to measure the north polar distance (declination) a measurement that gave the position in a xiu (right ascension). Needham's 4th century dating, however, is rejected by British sinologist Christopher Cullen, who traces the beginnings of these devices to the 1st century BC.Christopher Cullen, \\"Joseph Needham on Chinese Astronomy\\", Past and Present, No. 87 (May, 1980), pp. 39‚Äì53 (45) During the Western Han Dynasty (202 BC9 AD) additional developments made by the astronomers Luoxia Hong (:zh:ËêΩ‰∏ãÈó≥), Xiangyu Wangren, and Geng Shouchang (ËÄøÂ£ΩÊòå) advanced the use of the armillary in its early stage of evolution. In 52 BC, it was the astronomer Geng Shouchang who introduced the first permanently fixed equatorial ring of the armillary sphere. In the subsequent Eastern Han Dynasty (23‚Äì220 AD) period, the astronomers Fu An and Jia Kui added the ecliptic ring by 84 AD. With the famous statesman, astronomer, and inventor Zhang Heng (Âº†Ë°°, 78‚Äì139 AD), the sphere was totally complete in 125 AD, with horizon and meridian rings. The world's first water-powered celestial globe was created by Zhang Heng, who operated his armillary sphere by use of an inflow clepsydra clock (see Zhang's article for more detail). Subsequent developments were made after the Han Dynasty that improved the use of the armillary sphere. In 323 AD the Chinese astronomer Kong Ting was able to reorganize the arrangement of rings on the armillary sphere so that the ecliptic ring could be pegged on to the equator at any point desired. The Chinese astronomer and mathematician Li Chunfeng (ÊùéÊ∑≥È¢®) of the Tang dynasty created one in 633 AD with three spherical layers to calibrate multiple aspects of astronomical observations, calling them 'nests' (chhung). He was also responsible for proposing a plan of having a sighting tube mounted ecliptically in order for the better observation of celestial latitudes. However, it was the Tang Chinese astronomer, mathematician, and monk Yi Xing in the next century who would accomplish this addition to the model of the armillary sphere.Needham, Volume 3, 350. Ecliptical mountings of this sort were found on the armillary instruments of Zhou Cong and Shu Yijian in 1050, as well as Shen Kuo's armillary sphere of the later 11th century, but after that point they were no longer employed on Chinese armillary instruments until the arrival of the European Jesuits. Celestial globe from the Qing Dynasty In 723 AD, Yi Xing (‰∏ÄË°å) and government official Liang Ling-zan (Ê¢Å‰ª§Áìö) combined Zhang Heng's water powered celestial globe with an escapement device. With drums hit every quarter-hour and bells rung automatically every full hour, the device was also a striking clock.Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 473‚Äì475. The famous clock tower that the Chinese polymath Su Song built by 1094 during the Song Dynasty would employ Yi Xing's escapement with waterwheel scoops filled by clepsydra drip, and powered a crowning armillary sphere, a central celestial globe, and mechanically operated manikins that would exit mechanically opened doors of the clock tower at specific times to ring bells and gongs to announce the time, or to hold plaques announcing special times of the day. There was also the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031‚Äì1095). Being the head official for the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo was an avid scholar of astronomy, and improved the designs of several astronomical instruments: the gnomon, armillary sphere, clepsydra clock, and sighting tube fixed to observe the pole star indefinitely.Sivin, III, 17 When Jamal al-Din of Bukhara was asked to set up an 'Islamic Astronomical Institution' in Khubilai Khan's new capital during the Yuan Dynasty, he commissioned a number of astronomical instruments, including an armillary sphere. It was noted that \\"Chinese astronomers had been building [them] since at least 1092\\".S. Frederick Starr, Lost Enlightenment: Central Asia's Golden Age from the Arab Conquest to Tamerlane. Princeton University Press, 2013, p. 452. = Hellenistic world and ancient Rome = Ptolemy with an armillary sphere model, by Joos van Ghent and Pedro Berruguete, 1476, Louvre, Paris The Greek astronomer Hipparchus (c. 190c. 120 BC) credited Eratosthenes (276194 BC) as the inventor of the armillary sphere.Williams, p. 131Walter William Bryant: A History of Astronomy, 1907, p. 18John Ferguson: Callimachus, 1980, , p. 18Henry C. King: The History of the Telescope, 2003, , p. 7Dirk L. Couprie, Robert Hahn, Gerard Naddaf: Anaximander in Context: New Studies in the Origins of Greek Philosophy, 2003, , p. 179 Names of this device in Greek include astrolabos and krik≈çtƒì sphaira \\"ringed sphere\\"., . The English name of this device comes ultimately from the Latin armilla (circle, bracelet), since it has a skeleton made of graduated metal circles linking the poles and representing the equator, the ecliptic, meridians and parallels. Usually a ball representing the Earth or, later, the Sun is placed in its center. It is used to demonstrate the motion of the stars around the Earth. Before the advent of the European telescope in the 17th century, the armillary sphere was the prime instrument of all astronomers in determining celestial positions. In its simplest form, consisting of a ring fixed in the plane of the equator, the armilla is one of the most ancient of astronomical instruments. Slightly developed, it was crossed by another ring fixed in the plane of the meridian. The first was an equinoctial, the second a solstitial armilla. Shadows were used as indices of the sun's positions, in combinations with angular divisions. When several rings or circles were combined representing the great circles of the heavens, the instrument became an armillary sphere. Armillary spheres were developed by the Hellenistic Greeks and were used as teaching tools already in the 3rd century BC. In larger and more precise forms they were also used as observational instruments. However, the fully developed armillary sphere with nine circles perhaps did not exist until the mid-2nd century AD, during the Roman Empire. Eratosthenes most probably used a solstitial armilla for measuring the obliquity of the ecliptic. Hipparchus probably used an armillary sphere of four rings.Editors of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. (16 November 2006). \\"Armillary Sphere.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Accessed 14 October 2017. The Greco-Roman geographer and astronomer Ptolemy (c. 100‚Äì170 AD) describes his instrument, the astrolabon, in his Almagest. It consisted of at least three rings, with a graduated circle inside of which another could slide, carrying two small tubes positioned opposite each other and supported by a vertical plumb-line. =Medieval Middle East and Europe= The spherical astrolabe from medieval Islamic astronomy, c. 1480, in the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford in a painting by Florentine Italian artist Sandro Botticelli, c. 1480. Ottoman illustration of an armillary sphere, 16th century Persian and Arab astronomers produced an improved version of the Greek armillary sphere in the 8th century, and wrote about it in the treatise of Dhat al-Halaq or The instrument with the rings by the Persian astronomer Fazari (d.c. 777). Abbas Ibn Firnas (d.887) is thought to have produced another instrument with rings (armillary sphere) in the 9th century which he gave to Caliph Muhammad I (ruled 852‚Äì886).Al-Makkari, (ed. 1986), Nafh Al-Teeb, Volume 4. Dar Al-Fikre, Egypt, pp. 348‚Äì349. The spherical astrolabe, a variation of both the astrolabe and the armillary sphere, was invented during the Middle Ages in the Middle East.Emilie Savage-Smith (1993). \\"Book Reviews\\", Journal of Islamic Studies 4 (2), pp. 296‚Äì299. About 550 AD, Christian philosopher John Philoponus wrote a treatise on the astrolabe in Greek, which is the earliest extant treatise on the instrument.Modern editions of John Philoponus' treatise on the astrolabe are De usu astrolabii eiusque constructione libellus (On the Use and Construction of the Astrolabe), ed. Heinrich Hase, Bonn: E. Weber, 1839, (or id. Rheinisches Museum f√ºr Philologie 6 (1839): 127‚Äì71); repr. and translated into French by Alain Philippe Segonds, Jean Philopon, trait√© de l'astrolabe, Paris: Librairie Alain Brieux, 1981, ; and translated into English by H.W. Green in R.T. Gunther, The Astrolabes of the World, Vol. 1/2, Oxford, 1932, repr. London: Holland Press, 1976, pp. 61‚Äì81. The earliest description of the spherical astrolabe dates back to the Persian astronomer Nayrizi (fl. 892‚Äì902). Muslim astronomers also independently invented the celestial globe, which were used primarily for solving problems in celestial astronomy. Today, 126 such instruments remain worldwide, the oldest from the 11th century. The altitude of the sun, or the Right Ascension and Declination of stars could be calculated with these by inputting the location of the observer on the meridian ring of the globe. The armillary sphere was reintroduced to Western Europe via Al-Andalus in the late 10th century with the efforts of Gerbert d'Aurillac, the later Pope Sylvester II (r. 999‚Äì1003).Darlington, 467‚Äì472. Pope Sylvester II applied the use of sighting tubes with his armillary sphere in order to fix the position of the pole star and record measurements for the tropics and equator.Darlington, 679‚Äì670. =Korea= Chinese ideas of astronomy and astronomical instruments were introduced to Korea, where further advancements were also made. Jang Yeong-sil, a Korean inventor, was ordered by King Sejong the Great of Joseon to build an armillary sphere. The sphere, built in 1433 was named Honcheonui (ÌòºÏ≤úÏùò). The Honcheonsigye, an armillary sphere activated by a working clock mechanism was built by the Korean astronomer Song Iyeong in 1669. It is the only remaining astronomical clock from the Joseon Dynasty. The mechanism of the armillary sphere succeeded that of Sejong era's armillary sphere (Hon≈≠i Ê∏æÂÑÄ, 1435) and celestial sphere (Honsang Ê∏æË±°, 1435), and the Jade Clepsydra (Ongnu ÁéâÊºè, 1438)'s sun-carriage apparatus. Such mechanisms are similar to Ch'oe Yu-ji (Â¥îÊî∏‰πã, 1603~1673)'s armillary sphere(1657). The structure of time going train and the mechanism of striking-release in the part of clock is influenced by the crown escapement which has been developed from 14th century, and is applied to gear system which had been improved until the middle of 17th century in Western-style clockwork. In particular, timing device of Song I-y≈èng's Armillary Clock adopts the early 17th century pendulum clock system which could remarkably improve the accuracy of a clock.KIM Sang-Hyuk, A study on the operation mechanism of song I-yong\`s armillary clock, Ph.D dissertation, JoongAng University Tycho Brahe's zodiacal armillary sphere, from his Astronomiae Instauratae Mechanica (Wandesburg, 1598), p. 36. =Renaissance= Further advances in this instrument were made by Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546‚Äì1601), who constructed three large armillary spheres which he used for highly precise measurements of the positions of the stars and planets. They were described in his Astronomiae Instauratae Mechanica. Armillary spheres were among the first complex mechanical devices. Their development led to many improvements in techniques and design of all mechanical devices. Renaissance scientists and public figures often had their portraits painted showing them with one hand on an armillary sphere, which represented the height of wisdom and knowledge. The armillary sphere survives as useful for teaching, and may be described as a skeleton celestial globe, the series of rings representing the great circles of the heavens, and revolving on an axis within a horizon. With the earth as center such a sphere is known as Ptolemaic; with the sun as center, as Copernican.

The Armillary sphere in Geneva =Seamless celestial globe= In the 1980s, Emilie Savage-Smith discovered several celestial globes without any seams in Lahore and Kashmir. Hollow objects are typically cast in two halves, and Savage-Smith indicates that the casting of a seamless sphere was considered impossible, though techniques such as rotational molding have been used since at least the '60s to produce similarly seamless spheres. The earliest seamless globe was invented in Kashmir by the Muslim astronomer and metallurgist Ali Kashmiri ibn Luqman in 1589‚Äì90 (AH 998) during Akbar the Great's reign; another was produced in 1659‚Äì60 (1070 AH) by Muhammad Salih Tahtawi with Arabic and Sanskrit inscriptions; and the last was produced in Lahore by a Hindu astronomer and metallurgist Lala Balhumal Lahori in 1842 during Jagatjit Singh Bahadur's reign. 21 such globes were produced, and these remain the only examples of seamless metal globes. These Mughal metallurgists used the method of lost-wax casting in order to produce these globes.  Paralympic Games  An artwork-based model of an Armillary sphere has been used since the March 1, 2014 to light the Paralympic heritage flame at Stoke Mandeville Stadium, United Kingdom. The sphere includes a wheelchair that the user can rotate to spark the flame as part of a ceremony to celebrate the past, present and future of the Paralympic Movement in the UK. The Armillary Sphere was created by artist Jon Bausor and will be used for future Heritage Flame events. The flame in the first-ever ceremony was lit by London 2012 gold medallist Hannah Cockroft.  Heraldry and vexillology  The flag of Portugal features a pronounced armillary sphere The armillary sphere is commonly used in heraldry and vexillology, being mainly known as a symbol associated with Portugal, the Portuguese Empire and the Portuguese discoveries. In the end of the 15th century, the armillary sphere became the personal heraldic badge of the future King Manuel I of Portugal, when he was still a Prince. The intense use of this badge in documents, monuments, flags and other supports, during the reign of Manuel I, transformed the armillary sphere from a simple personal symbol to a national one that represented the Kingdom of Portugal and in particular its Overseas Empire. As a national symbol, the armillary sphere continued in use after the death of Manuel I. In the 17th century, it became associated with the Portuguese dominion of Brazil. In 1815, when Brazil gained the status of kingdom united with that of Portugal, its coat of arms was formalized as a golden armillary sphere in a blue field. Representing Brazil, the armillary sphere became also present in the arms and the flag of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. When Brazil became independent as an empire in 1822, the armillary sphere continued to be present in its national arms and in its national flag. The celestial sphere of the present Flag of Brazil replaced the armillary sphere in 1889. The armillary sphere was reintroduced in the national arms and in the national Flag of Portugal in 1910. 6' Armillary Sphere at the San Jacinto Battle Field in La Porte, Texas  See also   ', describes the late medieval (Ptolemaic) cosmos , a free- standing ‚Äì largest in the world * References =Sources= * Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (1771), \\"Geography\\". * Darlington, Oscar G. \\"Gerbert, the Teacher,\\" The American Historical Review (Volume 52, Number 3, 1947): 456‚Äì476. * Kern, Ralf: Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit.

Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. ; 12 November 1915 ‚Äì 26 March 1980) was a French literary theorist, essayist, philosopher, critic, and semiotician. Barthes's ideas explored a diverse range of fields and he influenced the development of many schools of theory, including structuralism, semiotics, social theory, design theory, anthropology, and post-structuralism. He was particularly known for developing and extending the field of semiotics through the analysis of a variety of sign systems, mainly derived from Western popular culture. During his academic career he was primarily associated with the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS) and the Coll√®ge de France. Biography = Early life = Roland Barthes was born on 12 November in the town of Cherbourg in Normandy. His father, naval officer Louis Barthes, was killed in a battle during World War I in the North Sea before Barthes's first birthday. His mother, Henriette Barthes, and his aunt and grandmother raised him in the village of Urt and the city of Bayonne. When Barthes was eleven, his family moved to Paris, though his attachment to his provincial roots would remain strong throughout his life. = Student years = Barthes showed great promise as a student and spent the period from 1935 to 1939 at the Sorbonne, where he earned a licence in classical literature. He was plagued by ill health throughout this period, suffering from tuberculosis, which often had to be treated in the isolation of sanatoria. His repeated physical breakdowns disrupted his academic career, affecting his studies and his ability to take qualifying examinations. They also exempted him from military service during World War II. His life from 1939 to 1948 was largely spent obtaining a licence in grammar and philology, publishing his first papers, taking part in a medical study, and continuing to struggle with his health. He received a dipl√¥me d'√©tudes sup√©rieures (roughly equivalent to an MA by thesis) from the University of Paris in 1941 for his work in Greek tragedy.Alan D. Schrift, Twentieth-Century French Philosophy: Key Themes and Thinkers, John Wiley & Sons, 4 Feb 2009, p. 94. = Early academic career = In 1948, he returned to purely academic work, gaining numerous short-term positions at institutes in France, Romania, and Egypt. During this time, he contributed to the leftist Parisian paper Combat, out of which grew his first full-length work, Writing Degree Zero (1953). In 1952, Barthes settled at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, where he studied lexicology and sociology. During his seven-year period there, he began to write a popular series of bi-monthly essays for the magazine Les Lettres Nouvelles, in which he dismantled myths of popular culture (gathered in the Mythologies collection that was published in 1957). Consisting of fifty-four short essays, mostly written between 1954‚Äì1956, Mythologies were acute reflections of French popular culture ranging from an analysis on soap detergents to a dissection of popular wrestling. Knowing little English, Barthes taught at Middlebury College in 1957 and befriended the future English translator of much of his work, Richard Howard, that summer in New York City.Richard Howard. \\"Remembering Roland Barthes,\\" The Nation (20 November 1982): \\"Mutual friends brought us together in 1957. He came to my door in the summer of that year, disconcerted by his classes at Middlebury (teaching students unaccustomed to a visitor with no English to speak of) and bearing, by way of introduction, a fresh-printed copy of Mythologies. (Michelet and Writing Degree Zero had already been published in France, but he was not yet known in America‚Äînot even in most French departments. Middlebury was enterprising.)\\" Reprinted in Signs in Culture: Roland Barthes Today, edited by Steven Ungar and Betty R. McGraw, University of Iowa Press, 1989, p. 32 (). = Rise to prominence = Barthes spent the early 1960s exploring the fields of semiology and structuralism, chairing various faculty positions around France, and continuing to produce more full- length studies. Many of his works challenged traditional academic views of literary criticism and of renowned figures of literature. His unorthodox thinking led to a conflict with a well-known Sorbonne professor of literature, Raymond Picard, who attacked the French New Criticism (a label that he inaccurately applied to Barthes) for its obscurity and lack of respect towards France's literary roots. Barthes's rebuttal in Criticism and Truth (1966) accused the old, bourgeois criticism of a lack of concern with the finer points of language and of selective ignorance towards challenging theories, such as Marxism. By the late 1960s, Barthes had established a reputation for himself. He traveled to the US and Japan, delivering a presentation at Johns Hopkins University. During this time, he wrote his best-known work, the 1967 essay \\"The Death of the Author,\\" which, in light of the growing influence of Jacques Derrida's deconstruction, would prove to be a transitional piece in its investigation of the logical ends of structuralist thought. = Mature critical work = Barthes continued to contribute with Philippe Sollers to the avant-garde literary magazine Tel Quel, which was developing similar kinds of theoretical inquiry to that pursued in Barthes's writings. In 1970, Barthes produced what many consider to be his most prodigious work, the dense, critical reading of Balzac's Sarrasine entitled S/Z. Throughout the 1970s, Barthes continued to develop his literary criticism; he developed new ideals of textuality and novelistic neutrality. In 1971, he served as visiting professor at the University of Geneva. In those same years he became primarily associated with the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS). In 1975 he wrote an autobiography titled Roland Barthes and in 1977 he was elected to the chair of S√©miologie Litt√©raire at the Coll√®ge de France. In the same year, his mother, Henriette Barthes, to whom he had been devoted, died, aged 85. They had lived together for 60 years. The loss of the woman who had raised and cared for him was a serious blow to Barthes. His last major work, Camera Lucida, is partly an essay about the nature of photography and partly a meditation on photographs of his mother. The book contains many reproductions of photographs, though none of them are of Henriette. = Death = On 25 February 1980, Roland Barthes was knocked down by a laundry van while walking home through the streets of Paris. One month later, on 26 March, he died from the chest injuries he sustained in that collision. Writings and ideas =Early thought= Barthes's earliest ideas reacted to the trend of existentialist philosophy that was prominent in France during the 1940s, specifically to the figurehead of existentialism, Jean-Paul Sartre. Sartre's What Is Literature? (1947) expresses a disenchantment both with established forms of writing and more experimental, avant-garde forms, which he feels alienate readers. Barthes's response was to try to discover that which may be considered unique and original in writing. In Writing Degree Zero (1953), Barthes argues that conventions inform both language and style, rendering neither purely creative. Instead, form, or what Barthes calls \\"writing\\" (the specific way an individual chooses to manipulate conventions of style for a desired effect), is the unique and creative act. However, a writer's form is vulnerable to becoming a convention once it has been made available to the public. This means that creativity is an ongoing process of continual change and reaction. In Michelet, a critical analysis of the French historian Jules Michelet, Barthes developed these notions, applying them to a broader range of fields. He argued that Michelet's views of history and society are obviously flawed. In studying his writings, he continued, one should not seek to learn from Michelet's claims; rather, one should maintain a critical distance and learn from his errors, since understanding how and why his thinking is flawed will show more about his period of history than his own observations. Similarly, Barthes felt that avant-garde writing should be praised for its maintenance of just such a distance between its audience and itself. In presenting an obvious artificiality rather than making claims to great subjective truths, Barthes argued, avant-garde writers ensure that their audiences maintain an objective perspective. In this sense, Barthes believed that art should be critical and should interrogate the world, rather than seek to explain it, as Michelet had done. =Semiotics and myth= Barthes's many monthly contributions, collected in his Mythologies (1957), frequently interrogated specific cultural materials in order to expose how bourgeois society asserted its values through them. For example, Barthes cited the portrayal of wine in French society. Its description as a robust and healthy habit is a bourgeois ideal that is contradicted by certain realities (i.e., that wine can be unhealthy and inebriating). He found semiotics, the study of signs, useful in these interrogations. He developed a theory of signs to demonstrate this perceived deception. He suggested that the construction of myths results in two levels of signification: the \\"language-object\\", a first order linguistic system; and the \\"metalanguage\\", the second-order system transmitting the myth. The former pertains to the literal or explicit meaning of things while the latter is composed of the language used to speak about the first order. Barthes explained that these bourgeois cultural myths were \\"second-order signs,\\" or \\"connotations.\\" A picture of a full, dark bottle is a signifier that relates to a specific signified: a fermented, alcoholic beverage. However, the bourgeoisie relate it to a new signified: the idea of healthy, robust, relaxing experience. Motivations for such manipulations vary, from a desire to sell products to a simple desire to maintain the status quo. These insights brought Barthes in line with similar Marxist theory. Barthes used the term \\"myth\\" while analyzing the popular, consumer culture of post-war France in order to reveal that \\"objects were organized into meaningful relationships via narratives that expressed collective cultural values.\\" In The Fashion System Barthes showed how this adulteration of signs could easily be translated into words. In this work he explained how in the fashion world any word could be loaded with idealistic bourgeois emphasis. Thus, if popular fashion says that a 'blouse' is ideal for a certain situation or ensemble, this idea is immediately naturalized and accepted as truth, even though the actual sign could just as easily be interchangeable with 'skirt', 'vest' or any number of combinations. In the end Barthes's Mythologies became absorbed into bourgeois culture, as he found many third parties asking him to comment on a certain cultural phenomenon, being interested in his control over his readership. This turn of events caused him to question the overall utility of demystifying culture for the masses, thinking it might be a fruitless attempt, and drove him deeper in his search for individualistic meaning in art. =Structuralism and its limits= As Barthes's work with structuralism began to flourish around the time of his debates with Picard, his investigation of structure focused on revealing the importance of language in writing, which he felt was overlooked by old criticism. Barthes's \\"Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narrative\\" is concerned with examining the correspondence between the structure of a sentence and that of a larger narrative, thus allowing narrative to be viewed along linguistic lines. Barthes split this work into three hierarchical levels: 'functions', 'actions' and 'narrative'. 'Functions' are the elementary pieces of a work, such as a single descriptive word that can be used to identify a character. That character would be an 'action', and consequently one of the elements that make up the narrative. Barthes was able to use these distinctions to evaluate how certain key 'functions' work in forming characters. For example, key words like 'dark', 'mysterious' and 'odd', when integrated together, formulate a specific kind of character or 'action'. By breaking down the work into such fundamental distinctions Barthes was able to judge the degree of realism given functions have in forming their actions and consequently with what authenticity a narrative can be said to reflect on reality. Thus, his structuralist theorizing became another exercise in his ongoing attempts to dissect and expose the misleading mechanisms of bourgeois culture. While Barthes found structuralism to be a useful tool and believed that discourse of literature could be formalized, he did not believe it could become a strict scientific endeavour. In the late 1960s, radical movements were taking place in literary criticism. The post-structuralist movement and the deconstructionism of Jacques Derrida were testing the bounds of the structuralist theory that Barthes's work exemplified. Derrida identified the flaw of structuralism as its reliance on a transcendental signifier; a symbol of constant, universal meaning would be essential as an orienting point in such a closed off system. This is to say that without some regular standard of measurement, a system of criticism that references nothing outside of the actual work itself could never prove useful. But since there are no symbols of constant and universal significance, the entire premise of structuralism as a means of evaluating writing (or anything) is hollow. =Transition= Such thought led Barthes to consider the limitations not just of signs and symbols, but also of Western culture's dependency on beliefs of constancy and ultimate standards. He travelled to Japan in 1966 where he wrote Empire of Signs (published in 1970), a meditation on Japanese culture's contentment in the absence of a search for a transcendental signifier. He notes that in Japan there is no emphasis on a great focus point by which to judge all other standards, describing the centre of Tokyo, the Emperor's Palace, as not a great overbearing entity, but a silent and nondescript presence, avoided and unconsidered. As such, Barthes reflects on the ability of signs in Japan to exist for their own merit, retaining only the significance naturally imbued by their signifiers. Such a society contrasts greatly to the one he dissected in Mythologies, which was revealed to be always asserting a greater, more complex significance on top of the natural one. In the wake of this trip Barthes wrote what is largely considered to be his best-known work, the essay \\"The Death of the Author\\" (1968). Barthes saw the notion of the author, or authorial authority, in the criticism of literary text as the forced projection of an ultimate meaning of the text. By imagining an ultimate intended meaning of a piece of literature one could infer an ultimate explanation for it. But Barthes points out that the great proliferation of meaning in language and the unknowable state of the author's mind makes any such ultimate realization impossible. As such, the whole notion of the 'knowable text' acts as little more than another delusion of Western bourgeois culture. Indeed, the idea of giving a book or poem an ultimate end coincides with the notion of making it consumable, something that can be used up and replaced in a capitalist market. \\"The Death of the Author\\" is considered to be a post-structuralist work,Jay Clayton, Eric Rothstein, Influence and Intertextuality in Literary History, University of Wisconsin Press, 1991, p. 156. since it moves past the conventions of trying to quantify literature, but others see it as more of a transitional phase for Barthes in his continuing effort to find significance in culture outside of the bourgeois norms . Indeed, the notion of the author being irrelevant was already a factor of structuralist thinking. =Textuality and S/Z= Since Barthes contends that there can be no originating anchor of meaning in the possible intentions of the author, he considers what other sources of meaning or significance can be found in literature. He concludes that since meaning can't come from the author, it must be actively created by the reader through a process of textual analysis. In his S/Z (1970), Barthes applies this notion in an analysis of Sarrasine, a Balzac novella. The end result was a reading that established five major codes for determining various kinds of significance, with numerous lexias throughout the text ‚Äì a \\"lexia\\" here being defined as a unit of the text chosen arbitrarily (to remain methodologically unbiased as possible) for further analysis. The codes led him to define the story as having a capacity for plurality of meaning, limited by its dependence upon strictly sequential elements (such as a definite timeline that has to be followed by the reader and thus restricts their freedom of analysis). From this project Barthes concludes that an ideal text is one that is reversible, or open to the greatest variety of independent interpretations and not restrictive in meaning. A text can be reversible by avoiding the restrictive devices that Sarrasine suffered from such as strict timelines and exact definitions of events. He describes this as the difference between the writerly text, in which the reader is active in a creative process, and a readerly text in which they are restricted to just reading. The project helped Barthes identify what it was he sought in literature: an openness for interpretation. =Neutral and novelistic writing= In the late 1970s, Barthes was increasingly concerned with the conflict of two types of language: that of popular culture, which he saw as limiting and pigeonholing in its titles and descriptions, and neutral, which he saw as open and noncommittal. He called these two conflicting modes the Doxa (the official and unacknowledged systems of meaning by which we know culture) and the Para-doxa. While Barthes had sympathized with Marxist thought in the past (or at least parallel criticisms), he felt that, despite its anti-ideological stance, Marxist theory was just as guilty of using violent language with assertive meanings, as was bourgeois literature. In this way they were both Doxa and both culturally assimilating. As a reaction to this, he wrote The Pleasure of the Text (1975), a study that focused on a subject matter he felt was equally outside the realm of both conservative society and militant leftist thinking: hedonism. By writing about a subject that was rejected by both social extremes of thought, Barthes felt he could avoid the dangers of the limiting language of the Doxa. The theory he developed out of this focus claimed that, while reading for pleasure is a kind of social act, through which the reader exposes him/herself to the ideas of the writer, the final cathartic climax of this pleasurable reading, which he termed the bliss in reading or jouissance, is a point in which one becomes lost within the text. This loss of self within the text or immersion in the text, signifies a final impact of reading that is experienced outside the social realm and free from the influence of culturally associative language and is thus neutral with regard to social progress. Despite this newest theory of reading, Barthes remained concerned with the difficulty of achieving truly neutral writing, which required an avoidance of any labels that might carry an implied meaning or identity towards a given object. Even carefully crafted neutral writing could be taken in an assertive context through the incidental use of a word with a loaded social context. Barthes felt his past works, like Mythologies, had suffered from this. He became interested in finding the best method for creating neutral writing, and he decided to try to create a novelistic form of rhetoric that would not seek to impose its meaning on the reader. One product of this endeavor was A Lover's Discourse: Fragments in 1977, in which he presents the fictionalized reflections of a lover seeking to identify and be identified by an anonymous amorous other. The unrequited lover's search for signs by which to show and receive love makes evident illusory myths involved in such a pursuit. The lover's attempts to assert himself into a false, ideal reality is involved in a delusion that exposes the contradictory logic inherent in such a search. Yet at the same time the novelistic character is a sympathetic one, and is thus open not just to criticism but also understanding from the reader. The end result is one that challenges the reader's views of social constructs of love, without trying to assert any definitive theory of meaning. = Mind and body = Barthes also attempted to reinterpret the mind-body dualism theory. Like Friedrich Nietzsche and Levinas, he also drew from Eastern philosophical traditions in his critique of European culture as \\"infected\\" by Western metaphysics. His body theory emphasized the formation of the self through bodily cultivation. The theory, which is also described as ethico-political entity, considers the idea of the body as one that functions as a \\"fashion word\\" that provides the illusion of a grounded discourse. This theory has influenced the work of other thinkers such as Jerome Bel. =Photography and Henriette Barthes= Throughout his career, Barthes had an interest in photography and its potential to communicate actual events. Many of his monthly myth articles in the 50s had attempted to show how a photographic image could represent implied meanings and thus be used by bourgeois culture to infer 'naturalistic truths'. But he still considered the photograph to have a unique potential for presenting a completely real representation of the world. When his mother, Henriette Barthes, died in 1977 he began writing Camera Lucida as an attempt to explain the unique significance a picture of her as a child carried for him. Reflecting on the relationship between the obvious symbolic meaning of a photograph (which he called the studium) and that which is purely personal and dependent on the individual, that which 'pierces the viewer' (which he called the punctum), Barthes was troubled by the fact that such distinctions collapse when personal significance is communicated to others and can have its symbolic logic rationalized. Barthes found the solution to this fine line of personal meaning in the form of his mother's picture. Barthes explained that a picture creates a falseness in the illusion of 'what is', where 'what was' would be a more accurate description. As had been made physical through Henriette Barthes's death, her childhood photograph is evidence of 'what has ceased to be'. Instead of making reality solid, it reminds us of the world's ever changing nature. Because of this there is something uniquely personal contained in the photograph of Barthes's mother that cannot be removed from his subjective state: the recurrent feeling of loss experienced whenever he looks at it. As one of his final works before his death, Camera Lucida was both an ongoing reflection on the complicated relations between subjectivity, meaning and cultural society as well as a touching dedication to his mother and description of the depth of his grief. =Posthumous publications= A posthumous collection of essays was published in 1987 by Fran√ßois Wahl, Incidents.Jonathan Culler, Barthes: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1983, p. 110 It contains fragments from his journals: his Soir√©es de Paris (a 1979 extract from his erotic diary of life in Paris); an earlier diary he kept which explicitly detailed his paying for sex with men and boys in Morocco; and Light of the Sud Ouest (his childhood memories of rural French life). In November 2007, Yale University Press published a new translation into English (by Richard Howard) of Barthes's little known work What is Sport. This work bears a considerable resemblance to Mythologies and was originally commissioned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as the text for a documentary film directed by Hubert Aquin. In February 2009, √âditions du Seuil published Journal de deuil (Journal of Mourning), based on Barthes's files written from 26 November 1977 (the day following his mother's death) up to 15 September 1979, intimate notes on his terrible loss: He grieved his mother's death for the rest of his life: \\"Do not say mourning. It's too psychoanalytic. I'm not in mourning. I'm suffering.\\" and \\"In the corner of my room where she had been bedridden, where she had died and where I now sleep, in the wall where her headboard had stood against I hanged an icon‚Äînot out of faith. And I always put some flowers on a table. I do not wish to travel anymore so that I may stay here and prevent the flowers from withering away.\\" In 2012 the book Travels in China was published. It consists of his notes from a three-week trip to China he undertook with a group from the literary journal Tel Quel in 1974. The experience left him somewhat disappointed, as he found China \\"not at all exotic, not at all disorienting\\". Influence Roland Barthes's incisive criticism contributed to the development of theoretical schools such as structuralism, semiotics, and post-structuralism. While his influence is mainly found in these theoretical fields with which his work brought him into contact, it is also felt in every field concerned with the representation of information and models of communication, including computers, photography, music, and literature. One consequence of Barthes's breadth of focus is that his legacy includes no following of thinkers dedicated to modeling themselves after him. The fact that Barthes's work was ever adapting and refuting notions of stability and constancy means there is no canon of thought within his theory to model one's thoughts upon, and thus no \\"Barthesism\\". Key terms Readerly and writerly are terms Barthes employs both to delineate one type of literature from another and to implicitly interrogate ways of reading, like positive or negative habits the modern reader brings into one's experience with the text itself. These terms are most explicitly fleshed out in S/Z, while the essay \\"From Work to Text\\", from Image‚ÄîMusic‚ÄîText (1977), provides an analogous parallel look at the active‚Äìpassive and postmodern‚Äìmodern ways of interacting with a text. =Readerly text= A text that makes no requirement of the reader to \\"write\\" or \\"produce\\" their own meanings. The reader may passively locate \\"ready-made\\" meaning. Barthes writes that these sorts of texts are \\"controlled by the principle of non-contradiction\\" (156), that is, they do not disturb the \\"common sense,\\" or \\"Doxa,\\" of the surrounding culture. The \\"readerly texts,\\" moreover, \\"are products [that] make up the enormous mass of our literature\\" (5). Within this category, there is a spectrum of \\"replete literature,\\" which comprises \\"any classic (readerly) texts\\" that work \\"like a cupboard where meanings are shelved, stacked, [and] safeguarded\\" (200).Barthes, Roland. S/Z: An Essay. Trans. Richard Miller. New York: Hill and Wang, 1974. =Writerly text= A text that aspires to the proper goal of literature and criticism: \\"... to make the reader no longer a consumer but a producer of the text\\" (4). Writerly texts and ways of reading constitute, in short, an active rather than passive way of interacting with a culture and its texts. A culture and its texts, Barthes writes, should never be accepted in their given forms and traditions. As opposed to the \\"readerly texts\\" as \\"product,\\" the \\"writerly text is ourselves writing, before the infinite play of the world is traversed, intersected, stopped, plasticized by some singular system (Ideology, Genus, Criticism) which reduces the plurality of entrances, the opening of networks, the infinity of languages\\" (5). Thus reading becomes for Barthes \\"not a parasitical act, the reactive complement of a writing\\", but rather a \\"form of work\\" (10). =The Author and the scriptor= Author and scriptor are terms Barthes uses to describe different ways of thinking about the creators of texts. \\"The author\\" is our traditional concept of the lone genius creating a work of literature or other piece of writing by the powers of his/her original imagination. For Barthes, such a figure is no longer viable. The insights offered by an array of modern thought, including the insights of Surrealism, have rendered the term obsolete. In place of the author, the modern world presents us with a figure Barthes calls the \\"scriptor,\\" whose only power is to combine pre-existing texts in new ways. Barthes believes that all writing draws on previous texts, norms, and conventions, and that these are the things to which we must turn to understand a text. As a way of asserting the relative unimportance of the writer's biography compared to these textual and generic conventions, Barthes says that the scriptor has no past, but is born with the text. He also argues that, in the absence of the idea of an \\"author-God\\" to control the meaning of a work, interpretive horizons are opened up considerably for the active reader. As Barthes puts it, \\"the death of the author is the birth of the reader.\\"Barthes, Roland. Image‚ÄîMusic‚ÄîText. Essays selected and translated by Stephen Heath. New York: Noonday, 1977. Criticism In 1964, Barthes wrote \\"The Last Happy Writer\\" (\\"Le dernier des √©crivains heureux\\" in Essais critiques), the title of which refers to Voltaire. In the essay he commented on the problems of the modern thinker after discovering the relativism in thought and philosophy, discrediting previous philosophers who avoided this difficulty. Disagreeing roundly with Barthes's description of Voltaire, Daniel Gordon, the translator and editor of Candide (The Bedford Series in History and Culture), wrote that \\"never has one brilliant writer so thoroughly misunderstood another.\\" The sinologist Simon Leys, in a review of Barthes's diary of a trip to China during the Cultural Revolution, disparages Barthes for his seeming indifference to the situation of the Chinese people, and says that Barthes \\"has contrived‚Äîamazingly‚Äîto bestow an entirely new dignity upon the age-old activity, so long unjustly disparaged, of saying nothing at great length.\\"Leys, Simon The Hall of Uselessness: Collected Essays, New York, New York Review Books, 2013. In popular culture Barthes's A Lover's Discourse: Fragments was the inspiration for the name of 1980s new wave duo The Lover Speaks. Jeffrey Eugenides' The Marriage Plot draws out excerpts from Barthes's A Lover's Discourse: Fragments as a way to depict the unique intricacies of love that one of the main characters, Madeleine Hanna, experiences throughout the novel. In the film Birdman (2014) by Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu, a journalist quotes to the protagonist Riggan Thompson an extract from Mythologies: \\"The cultural work done in the past by gods and epic sagas is now done by laundry-detergent commercials and comic-strip characters\\". In the film The Truth About Cats & Dogs (1996) by Michael Lehmann, Brian is reading an extract from Camera Lucida over the phone to a woman whom he thinks to be beautiful but who is her more intellectual and less physically desirable friend. In the film Elegy, based on Philip Roth's novel The Dying Animal, the character of Consuela (played by Pen√©lope Cruz) is first depicted in the film carrying a copy of Barthes's The Pleasure of the Text on the campus of the university where she is a student.Manohla Dargis, \\"Extracurricular Lessons for Student and Teacher,\\" review of Elegy, New York Times, 8 August 2008, accessed on 12-9-2015: Of the character of Consuela, Dargis writes, \\"She was his student and ripe for the plucking, especially in the film, where she enters clutching Roland Barthes's \\"Pleasure of the Text\\" to her lush bosom.\\" Laurent Binet's novel The 7th Function of Language is based on the premise that Barthes was not merely accidentally hit by a van but that he was instead murdered, as part of a conspiracy to acquire a document known as the \\"Seventh Function of Language\\".

What a Lovely War is a 1969 British comedy and musical film directed by Richard Attenborough (in his directorial debut), with an ensemble cast, including Maggie Smith, Dirk Bogarde, John Gielgud, John Mills, Kenneth More, Laurence Olivier, Jack Hawkins, Corin Redgrave, Michael Redgrave, Vanessa Redgrave, Ralph Richardson, Ian Holm, Paul Shelley, Malcolm McFee, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Nanette Newman, Edward Fox, Susannah York, John Clements, Phyllis Calvert and Maurice Ro√´ves. The film is based on the stage musical Oh, What a Lovely War!, originated by Charles Chilton as the radio play The Long Long Trail in December 1961,The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century English Literature, ed Laura Marcus & Peter Nicholls, page 478. Cambridge University Press, 2004. , . and transferred to stage by Gerry Raffles in partnership with Joan Littlewood and her Theatre Workshop in 1963.Banham (1998, 645), Brockett and Hildy (2003, 493), and Eyre and Wright (2000, 266‚Äì69). The title is derived from the music hall song \\"Oh! It's a Lovely War\\", which is one of the major numbers in the film. Synopsis Oh! What a Lovely War summarises and comments on the events of World War I using popular songs of the time, many of which were parodies of older popular songs, and using allegorical settings such as Brighton's West Pier to criticise the manner in which the eventual victory was won. The diplomatic maneuvering and events involving those in authority are set in a fantasy location inside the pierhead pavilion, far from the trenches. In the opening scene, various foreign ministers, generals and heads of state walk over a huge map of Europe, reciting actual words spoken by these figures at the time. An unnamed photographer takes a picture of Europe's rulers ‚Äì after handing two red poppies to the Archduke Ferdinand and his wife, the Duchess of Hohenberg, he takes their picture, \\"assassinating\\" them as the flash goes off. Many of the heads of state enjoy good personal relations and are reluctant to go to war: a tearful Emperor Franz Josef declares war on Serbia after being deceived by his Foreign Minister, and Czar Nicholas II and Kaiser Wilhelm II are shown as unable to overrule their countries' military mobilisation schedules. The German invasion of Belgium leaves Sir Edward Grey little choice but to get involved. Italy reneges on its alliance with the Central Powers (it joined the Allies in 1915) but Turkey joins them instead. The start of the war in 1914 is shown as a parade of optimism. The protagonists are an archetypal British family of the time, the Smiths, who are shown entering Brighton's West Pier, with General Haig selling tickets ‚Äì the film later follows the young Smith men through their experiences in the trenches. A military band rouses holidaymakers from the beach to rally round and follow ‚Äì some even literally boarding a bandwagon. The first Battle of Mons is similarly cheerfully depicted yet more realistic in portrayal. Both scenes are flooded in pleasant sunshine. When the casualties start to mount, a theatre audience is rallied by singing \\"Are We Downhearted? No!\\" A chorus line dressed in frilled yellow dresses, recruits a volunteer army with \\"We don't want to lose you, but we think you ought to go\\". A music hall star (Maggie Smith) then enters a lone spotlight, and lures the still doubtful young men in the audience into \\"taking the King's Shilling\\" by singing about how every day she \\"walks out\\" with different men in uniform, and that \\"On Saturday I'm willing, if you'll only take the shilling, to make a man of any one of you.\\" The young men take to the stage and are quickly moved offstage and into military life, and the initially alluring music hall singer is depicted on close-up as a coarse, over-made-up harridan. The red poppy crops up again as a symbol of impending death, often being handed to a soldier about to be sent to die. These scenes are juxtaposed with the pavilion, now housing the top military brass. There is a scoreboard (a dominant motif in the original theatre production) showing the loss of life and \\"yards gained\\". Outside, Sylvia Pankhurst (Vanessa Redgrave) is shown addressing a hostile crowd on the futility of war, upbraiding them for believing everything they read in the newspapers. She is met with catcalls and jeered from her podium. 1915 is depicted as darkly contrasting in tone. Many shots of a parade of wounded men illustrate an endless stream of grim, hopeless faces. Black humour among these soldiers has now replaced the enthusiasm of the early days. \\"There's a Long, Long Trail a-Winding\\" captures the new mood of despair, depicting soldiers filing along in torrential rain in miserable conditions. Red poppies provide the only bright colour in these scenes. In a scene of British soldiers drinking in an estaminet, a chanteuse (Pia Colombo) leads them in a jolly chorus of \\"The Moon Shines Bright on Charlie Chaplin\\", a reworking of an American song then shifts the mood back to darker tone by singing a soft and sombre version of \\"Adieu la vie\\". At the end of the year, amidst more manoeuvres in the pavilion, General (later Field Marshal) Douglas Haig replaces Field Marshal Sir John French as Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces. Haig is then mocked by Australian troops who see him inspecting British soldiers; they sing \\"They were only playing Leapfrog\\" to the tune of \\"John Brown's Body\\". An interfaith religious service is held in a ruined abbey. A priest tells the gathered soldiers that each religion has endorsed the war by way of allowing soldiers to eat pork if Jewish, meat on Fridays if Catholic, and work through the sabbath if in service of the war for all religions. He also says the Dalai Lama has blessed the war effort. 1916 passes and the film's tone darkens again. The songs contain contrasting tones of wistfulness, stoicism and resignation, including \\"The Bells of Hell Go Ting-a- ling-a-ling\\", \\"If the Sergeant Steals Your Rum, Never Mind\\" and \\"Hanging on the Old Barbed Wire\\". The wounded are laid out in ranks at the field station, a stark contrast to the healthy rows of young men who entered the war. The camera often lingers on Harry Smith's silently suffering face. The Americans arrive, but are shown only in the \\"disconnected reality\\" of the pavilion, interrupting the deliberations of the British generals by singing \\"Over There\\" with the changed final line: \\"And we won't come back ‚Äì we'll be buried over there!\\" The resolute-looking American captain seizes the map from an astonished Haig. Jack notices with disgust that after three years of fighting, he is literally back where he started, at Mons. As the Armistice is sounding, Jack is the last one to die. There is a splash of red which at first glance appears to be blood, but which turns out to be yet another poppy out of focus in the foreground. Jack's spirit wanders through the battlefield, and he eventually finds himself in the room where the elder statesmen of Europe are drafting the coming peace - but they are oblivious to his presence. Jack finally finds himself on a tranquil hillside, where he joins his friends for a lie down on the grass, where their figures morph into crosses. The film closes with a long slow pan out that ends in a dizzying aerial view of countless soldiers' graves, as the voices of the dead sing \\"We'll Never Tell Them\\" (a parody of the Jerome Kern song \\"They Didn't Believe Me\\").

Alt URL The Deighton Duffy production company had produced the film adaptation of Deighton‚Äôs Only When I Larf starring Richard Attenborough. Deighton wrote the screenplay for Oh! What a Lovely War and the opening title sequence was created by Len Deighton's lifelong friend Raymond Hawkey, the designer responsible for many of Deighton's book covers in the 1960s. In an attempt to shame other people whom he thought were claiming credit for things they hadn't actually done, Deighton decided not to be listed in the film credits, a gesture he later described as \\"stupid and infantile\\". The 1969 film transferred the mise-en-sc√®ne completely into the cinematic domain, with elaborate sequences shot at West Pier in Brighton, elsewhere in Brighton and on the South Downs, interspersed with motifs from the stage production. These included the 'cricket' scoreboards showing the number of dead, but Deighton did not use the pierrot costumes. However, as many critics, including Pauline Kael,Kael, Pauline (1971) 'Off with the statues' heads!' in Deeper into Movies, Calder Boyars noted, the treatment diminished the effect of the numbers of deaths, which appear only fleetingly. Nonetheless, Deighton‚Äôs final sequence, ending in a helicopter shot of thousands of war graves is regarded as one of the most memorable moments of the film. According to Attenborough, 16,000 white crosses had to be hammered into individually dug holes due to the hardness of the soil. Although this is effective in symbolising the scale of death, the number of crosses was in fact fewer than the number of deaths in a single battle: depicting the actual number would have required the scale to have been replicated more than 1000 times. The film was shot in the summer of 1968 in Sussex, mostly in the Brighton area. Many of the extras were local folk, but a great many were students from the University of Sussex, Falmer, on the outskirts of the town. The film's locations included the West Pier (now gutted by fire and wrecked), Ditchling Beacon, Sheepcote Valley (the trench sequences), Old Bayham Abbey, near Frant (the church parade), Brighton station and Ovingdean (where thousands of crosses were erected for the classic finale). The song The song was written by J.P. Long and Maurice Scott in 1917 and was part of the repertoire of music hall star and male impersonator Ella Shields.Max Arthur (2001) When This Bloody War Is Over. London, Piatkus: 47 The first verse and the chorus follow: :Up to your waist in water, :Up to your eyes in slush ‚Äì :Using the kind of language, :That makes the sergeant blush; :Who wouldn't join the army? :That's what we all inquire, :Don't we pity the poor civilians sitting beside the fire. :Chorus :Oh! Oh! Oh! it's a lovely war, :Who wouldn't be a soldier eh? :Oh! It's a shame to take the pay. :As soon as reveille is gone :We feel just as heavy as lead, :But we never get up till the sergeant brings :Our breakfast up to bed :Oh! Oh! Oh! it's a lovely war, :What do we want with eggs and ham :When we've got plum and apple jam? :Form fours! Right turn! :How shall we spend the money we earn? :Oh! Oh! Oh! it's a lovely war. Two pre-musical renditions, one from 1918, can be found at Firstworldwar.com.firstworldwar.com Almost all of the songs featured in the film also appear on the CD41 album series Oh! It's a Lovely War (four volumes). Reception Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it \\"a big, elaborate, sometimes realistic film whose elephantine physical proportions and often brilliant all-star cast simply overwhelm the material with a surfeit of good intentions.\\" Variety called the film \\"dedicated, exhilarating, shrewd, mocking, funny, emotional, witty, poignant and technically brilliant.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film 4 stars out of 4, writing that it was not a movie but \\"an elaborately staged tableau, a dazzling use of the camera to achieve essentially theatrical effects. And judged on that basis, Richard Attenborough has given us a breathtaking evening.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune also gave the film a perfect grade of 4 stars and wrote it \\"deserves an Academy Award nomination for the best picture of the year ... You can sit back and enjoy this film on any one of many levels. The songs are good, the lyrics are biting; the staging and costuming blend with the story rather than overshadow it. The acting seems effortless.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"What noted British actor Richard Attenborough, in a dazzling directorial debut, and his principal writers Len Deighton and Brian Duffy have done is to transform the highly political and one-dimensional Joan Littlewood theatre piece into timeless‚Äîand painfully timely‚Äîtragic allegory.\\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote: \\"The conception is intriguing, but the film turns into an infernal, precision machine. As one big production number succeeded the other and one perfectly measured and symmetrical tableau faded into the next, I began to feel stupefied rather than touched. The physical production was rolling over the songs, the characters and the vignettes.\\" David Wilson of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that \\"one is simply left admiring a worthy mosaic of bits and pieces, full of good ideas but nowhere near to being a self-contained dramatic entity.\\" The film presently has a score of 79% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 14 reviews, with an average grade of 8.2 out of 10. The Toronto Star received complaints from veteran organizations about the advertisement for the film that featured cemetery crosses and later ran the adverts without the image. Box office It ranked the 16th film at the UK box office in 1969.\\"The World's Top Twenty Films.\\" Sunday Times [London, England] 27 Sept. 1970: 27.

Animal welfare is the well-being of non-human animals. Formal standards of animal welfare vary between contexts, but are debated mostly by animal welfare groups, legislators, and academics. Animal welfare science uses measures such as longevity, disease, immunosuppression, behavior, physiology, and reproduction, although there is debate about which of these best indicate animal welfare. Respect for animal welfare is often based on the belief that nonhuman animals are sentient and that consideration should be given to their well-being or suffering, especially when they are under the care of humans. These concerns can include how animals are slaughtered for food, how they are used in scientific research, how they are kept (as pets, in zoos, farms, circuses, etc.), and how human activities affect the welfare and survival of wild species. There are two forms of criticism of the concept of animal welfare, coming from diametrically opposite positions. One view, held by some thinkers in history, holds that humans have no duties of any kind to animals. The other view is based on the animal rights position that animals should not be regarded as property and any use of animals by humans is unacceptable. Accordingly, some animal rights proponents argue that the perception of better animal welfare facilitates continued and increased exploitation of animals. Some authorities therefore treat animal welfare and animal rights as two opposing positions. Others see animal welfare gains as incremental steps towards animal rights. The predominant view of modern neuroscientists, notwithstanding philosophical problems with the definition of consciousness even in humans, is that consciousness exists in nonhuman animals. However, some still maintain that consciousness is a philosophical question that may never be scientifically resolved. History, principles and practice Early legislation in the Western world on behalf of animals includes the Ireland Parliament (Thomas Wentworth) \\"An Act against Plowing by the Tayle, and pulling the Wooll off living Sheep\\", 1635, and the Massachusetts Colony (Nathaniel Ward) \\"Off the Bruite Creatures\\" Liberty 92 and 93 in the \\"Massachusetts Body of Liberties\\" of 1641. In 1776, English clergyman Humphrey Primatt authored A Dissertation on the Duty of Mercy and Sin of Cruelty to Brute Animals, one of the first books published in support of animal welfare.Niven, Charles D. (1967). History of the Humane Movement. Transatlantic Arts. p. 53Levitt, Lacey; Patronek, Gary; Grisso, Thomas. (2016). Animal Maltreatment: Forensic Mental Health Issues and Evaluations. Oxford University Press. p. 19. Marc Bekoff has noted that \\"Primatt was largely responsible for bringing animal welfare to the attention of the general public.\\"Bekoff, Marc. (2010). Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare, 2nd Edition. ABC-CLIO. pp. 484-485. Since 1822, when Irish MP Richard Martin brought the \\"Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822\\" through Parliament offering protection from cruelty to cattle, horses, and sheep, an animal welfare movement has been active in England. Martin was among the founders of the world's first animal welfare organization, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or SPCA, in 1824. In 1840, Queen Victoria gave the society her blessing, and it became the RSPCA. The society used members' donations to employ a growing network of inspectors, whose job was to identify abusers, gather evidence, and report them to the authorities. In 1837, the German minister Albert Knapp founded the first German animal welfare society. One of the first national laws to protect animals was the UK \\"Cruelty to Animals Act 1835\\" followed by the \\"Protection of Animals Act 1911\\". In the US it was many years until there was a national law to protect animals‚Äîthe \\"Animal Welfare Act of 1966\\"‚Äîalthough there were a number of states that passed anti-cruelty laws between 1828 and 1898. In India, animals are protected by the \\"Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960\\". Significant progress in animal welfare did not take place until the late 20th century.Phillips 2009. p 56. In 1965, the UK government commissioned an investigation‚Äîled by Professor Roger Brambell‚Äîinto the welfare of intensively farmed animals, partly in response to concerns raised in Ruth Harrison's 1964 book, Animal Machines. On the basis of Professor Brambell's report, the UK government set up the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Committee in 1967, which became the Farm Animal Welfare Council in 1979. The committee's first guidelines recommended that animals require the freedoms to \\"stand up, lie down, turn around, groom themselves and stretch their limbs.\\" The guidelines have since been elaborated upon to become known as the Five Freedoms. In the UK, the \\"Animal Welfare Act 2006\\" consolidated many different forms of animal welfare legislation. A number of animal welfare organisations are campaigning to achieve a Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare (UDAW) at the United Nations. In principle, the Universal Declaration would call on the United Nations to recognise animals as sentient beings, capable of experiencing pain and suffering, and to recognise that animal welfare is an issue of importance as part of the social development of nations worldwide. The campaign to achieve the UDAW is being co-ordinated by World Animal Protection, with a core working group including Compassion in World Farming, the RSPCA, and the Humane Society International (the international branch of HSUS).Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare Compassion in World FarmingBack a Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare World Animal Protection =Animal welfare science= Animal welfare science is an emerging field that seeks to answer questions raised by the keeping and use of animals, such as whether hens are frustrated when confined in cages, whether the psychological well-being of animals in laboratories can be maintained, and whether zoo animals are stressed by the transport required for international conservation. Ireland leads research into farm animal welfare with the recently published Research Report on Farm Animal Welfare. Animal welfare issues * Animal testing * Abandoned pets * Behavioral enrichment * Blood sport * Cruelty to animals * Feral cat * Hunting * Overpopulation in companion animals * Overview of discretionary invasive procedures on animals * Poaching * Puppy mills * Whaling =Farm animals= A major concern for the welfare of farm animals is factory farming in which large numbers of animals are reared in confinement at high stocking densities. Issues include the limited opportunities for natural behaviors, for example, in battery cages, veal and gestation crates, instead producing abnormal behaviors such as tail-biting, cannibalism, and feather pecking, and routine invasive procedures such as beak trimming, castration, and ear notching. More extensive methods of farming, e.g. free range, can also raise welfare concerns such as the mulesing of sheep, predation of stock by wild animals, and biosecurity. Farm animals are artificially selected for production parameters which sometimes impinge on the animals' welfare. For example, broiler chickens are bred to be very large to produce the greatest quantity of meat per animal. Broilers bred for fast growth have a high incidence of leg deformities because the large breast muscles cause distortions of the developing legs and pelvis, and the birds cannot support their increased body weight. As a consequence, they frequently become lame or suffer from broken legs. The increased body weight also puts a strain on their hearts and lungs, and ascites often develops. In the UK alone, up to 20 million broilers each year die from the stress of catching and transport before reaching the slaughterhouse. Another concern about the welfare of farm animals is the method of slaughter, especially ritual slaughter. While the killing of animals need not necessarily involve suffering, the general public considers that killing an animal reduces its welfare.Phillips 2009. p 10. This leads to further concerns about premature slaughtering such as chick culling by the laying hen industry, in which males are slaughtered immediately after hatching because they are superfluous; this policy occurs in other farm animal industries such as the production of goat and cattle milk, raising the same concerns. =Cetaceans= Captive cetaceans are kept for display, research and naval operations. To enhance their welfare, humans feed them fish which are dead, but are disease- free, protect them from predators and injury, monitor their health, and provide activities for behavioral enrichment. Some are kept in lagoons with natural soil and vegetated sides. Most are in concrete tanks which are easy to clean, but echo their natural sounds back to them. They cannot develop their own social groups, and related cetaceans are typically separated for display and breeding. Military dolphins used in naval operations swim free during operations and training, and return to pens otherwise. Captive cetaceans are trained to present themselves for blood samples, health exams and noninvasive breath samples above their blow holes. Staff can monitor the captives afterwards for signs of infection from the procedure. Research on wild cetaceans leaves them free to roam and make sounds in their natural habitat, eat live fish, face predators and injury, and form social groups voluntarily. However boat engines of researchers, whale watchers and others add substantial noise to their natural environment, reducing their ability to echolocate and communicate. Electric engines are far quieter, but are not widely used for either research or whale watching, even for maintaining position, which does not require much power. Vancouver Port offers discounts for ships with quiet propeller and hull designs. Other areas have reduced speeds. Boat engines also have unshielded propellers, which cause serious injuries to cetaceans who come close to the propeller. The US Coast Guard has proposed rules on propeller guards to protect human swimmers, but has not adopted any rules. The US Navy uses propeller guards to protect manatees in Georgia. Ducted propellers provide more efficient drive at speeds up to 10 knots, and protect animals beneath and beside them, but need grilles to prevent injuries to animals drawn into the duct. Attaching satellite trackers and obtaining biopsies to measure pollution loads and DNA involve either capture and release, or shooting the cetaceans from a distance with dart guns. A cetacean was killed by a fungal infection after being darted, due to either an incompletely sterilized dart or an infection from the ocean entering the wound caused by the dart. Researchers on wild cetaceans have not yet been able to use drones to capture noninvasive breath samples. Other harms to wild cetaceans include commercial whaling, aboriginal whaling, drift netting, ship collisions, water pollution, noise from sonar and reflection seismology, predators, loss of prey, disease. Efforts to enhance the life of wild cetaceans, besides reducing those harms, include offering human music. Canadian rules do not forbid playing quiet music, though they forbid \\"noise that may resemble whale songs or calls, under water\\". =Wild animal welfare= In addition to cetaceans, the welfare of other wild animals has also been studied, though to a lesser extent than that of animals in farms. Research in wild animal welfare has two focuses: the welfare of wild animals kept in captivity and the welfare of animals living in the wild. The former has addressed the situation of animals kept both for human use, as in zoos or circuses, or in rehabilitation centers. The latter has examined how the welfare of non-domesticated animals living in wild or urban areas are affected by humans or natural factors causing wild animal suffering. Some of the proponents of these views have advocated for carrying out conservation efforts in ways that respect the welfare of wild animals, within the framework of a discipline called compassionate conservation, while others have argued in favor of improving the welfare of wild animals for the sake of the animals, regardless of whether there are any conservation issues involved at all. The welfare economist Yew-Kwang Ng, in his 1995 \\"Towards welfare biology: Evolutionary economics of animal consciousness and suffering\\", proposed welfare biology as a research field to study \\"living things and their environment with respect to their welfare (defined as net happiness, or enjoyment minus suffering).\\"  Legislation  =European Union= The European Commission's activities in this area start with the recognition that animals are sentient beings. The general aim is to ensure that animals do not endure avoidable pain or suffering, and obliges the owner/keeper of animals to respect minimum welfare requirements. European Union legislation regarding farm animal welfare is regularly re-drafted according to science-based evidence and cultural views. For example, in 2009, legislation was passed which aimed to reduce animal suffering during slaughter and on January 1, 2012, the European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC came into act, which means that conventional battery cages for laying hens are now banned across the Union. United Kingdom The Animal Welfare Act 2006 makes owners and keepers responsible for ensuring that the welfare needs of their animals are met. These include the need: for a suitable environment (place to live), for a suitable diet, to exhibit normal behavior patterns, to be housed with, or apart from, other animals (if applicable), and to be protected from pain, injury, suffering and disease. Anyone who is cruel to an animal, or does not provide for its welfare needs, may be banned from owning animals, fined up to ¬£20,000 and/or sent to prison for a maximum of six months. In the UK, the welfare of research animals being used for \\"regulated procedures\\" was historically protected by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (ASPA) which is administrated by the Home Office. The Act defines \\"regulated procedures\\" as animal experiments that could potentially cause \\"pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm\\" to \\"protected animals\\". Initially, \\"protected animals\\" encompassed all living vertebrates other than humans, but, in 1993, an amendment added a single invertebrate species, the common octopus. Primates, cats, dogs, and horses have additional protection over other vertebrates under the Act. Revised legislation came into force in January 2013. This has been expanded to protect \\"...all living vertebrates, other than man, and any living cephalopod. Fish and amphibia are protected once they can feed independently and cephalopods at the point when they hatch. Embryonic and foetal forms of mammals, birds and reptiles are protected during the last third of their gestation or incubation period.\\" The definition of regulated procedures was also expanded: \\"A procedure is regulated if it is carried out on a protected animal and may cause that animal a level of pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm equivalent to, or higher than, that caused by inserting a hypodermic needle according to good veterinary practice.\\" It also includes modifying the genes of a protected animal if this causes the animal pain, suffering, distress, or lasting harm. The ASPA also considers other issues such as animal sources, housing conditions, identification methods, and the humane killing of animals. This legislation is widely regarded as the strictest in the world. Those applying for a license must explain why such research cannot be done through non-animal methods. The project must also pass an ethical review panel which aims to decide if the potential benefits outweigh any suffering for the animals involved. =United States= In the United States, a federal law called the Humane Slaughter Act was designed to decrease suffering of livestock during slaughter. The Georgia Animal Protection Act of 1986 was a state law enacted in response to the inhumane treatment of companion animals by a pet store chain in Atlanta. The Act provided for the licensing and regulation of pet shops, stables, kennels, and animal shelters, and established, for the first time, minimum standards of care. Additional provisions, called the Humane Euthanasia Act, were added in 1990, and then further expanded and strengthened with the Animal Protection Act of 2000. In 2002, voters passed (by a margin of 55% for and 45% against) Amendment 10 to the Florida Constitution banning the confinement of pregnant pigs in gestation crates. In 2006, Arizona voters passed Proposition 204 with 62% support; the legislation prohibits the confinement of calves in veal crates and breeding sows in gestation crates. In 2007, the Governor of Oregon signed legislation prohibiting the confinement of pigs in gestation crates and in 2008, the Governor of Colorado signed legislation that phased out both gestation crates and veal crates. Also during 2008, California passed Proposition 2, known as the \\"Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act\\", which orders new space requirements for farm animals starting in 2015. The use of animals in laboratories remains controversial. Animal welfare advocates push for enforced standards to ensure the health and safety of those animals used for tests. In the US, every institution that uses vertebrate animals for federally funded laboratory research must have an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Each local IACUC reviews research protocols and conducts evaluations of the institution's animal care and use which includes the results of inspections of facilities that are required by law. The IACUC committee must assess the steps taken to \\"enhance animal well-being\\" before research can take place. This includes research on farm animals.ftp://ftp.grants.nih.gov/IACUC/GuideBook.pdf According to the National Institutes of Health Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, researchers must try to minimize distress in animals whenever possible: \\"Animals used in research and testing may experience pain from induced diseases, procedures, and toxicity. The Public Health Service (PHS) Policy and Animal Welfare Regulations (AWRs) state that procedures that cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress should be performed with appropriate sedation, analgesia, or anesthesia. However, research and testing studies sometimes involve pain that cannot be relieved with such agents because they would interfere with the scientific objectives of the study. Accordingly, federal regulations require that IACUCs determine that discomfort to animals will be limited to that which is unavoidable for the conduct of scientifically valuable research, and that unrelieved pain and distress will only continue for the duration necessary to accomplish the scientific objectives. The PHS Policy and AWRs further state that animals that would otherwise suffer severe or chronic pain and distress that cannot be relieved should be painlessly killed at the end of the procedure, or if appropriate, during the procedure.\\" The National Research Council's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals also serves as a guide to improve welfare for animals used in research in the US. The Federation of Animal Science Societies' Guide for the Care and Use of Agricultural Animals in Research and Teaching is a resource addressing welfare concerns in farm animal research. Laboratory animals in the US are also protected under the Animal Welfare Act. The United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) enforces the Animal Welfare Act. APHIS inspects animal research facilities regularly and reports are published online. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the total number of animals used in the U.S. in 2005 was almost 1.2 million, but this does not include rats, mice, and birds which are not covered by welfare legislation but make up approximately 90% of research animals.The humane care and treatment of laboratory animals. National Association of Biomedical Research Approaches and definitions There are many different approaches to describing and defining animal welfare. Positive conditions ‚Äì Providing good animal welfare is sometimes defined by a list of positive conditions which should be provided to the animal. This approach is taken by the Five Freedoms and the three principles of Professor John Webster. The Five Freedoms are: * Freedom from thirst and hunger ‚Äì by ready access to fresh water and a diet to maintain full health and vigour * Freedom from discomfort ‚Äì by providing an appropriate environment including shelter and a comfortable resting area * Freedom from pain, injury, and disease ‚Äì by prevention or rapid diagnosis and treatment * Freedom to express most normal behavior ‚Äì by providing sufficient space, proper facilities, and company of the animal's own kind * Freedom from fear and distress ‚Äì by ensuring conditions and treatment which avoid mental suffering John Webster defines animal welfare by advocating three positive conditions: Living a natural life, being fit and healthy, and being happy. High production ‚Äì In the past, many have seen farm animal welfare chiefly in terms of whether the animal is producing well. The argument is that an animal in poor welfare would not be producing well, however, many farmed animals will remain highly productive despite being in conditions where good welfare is almost certainly compromised, e.g., layer hens in battery cages. Emotion in animals ‚Äì Others in the field, such as Professor Ian Duncan and Professor Marian Dawkins, focus more on the feelings of the animal. This approach indicates the belief that animals should be considered as sentient beings. Duncan wrote, \\"Animal welfare is to do with the feelings experienced by animals: the absence of strong negative feelings, usually called suffering, and (probably) the presence of positive feelings, usually called pleasure. In any assessment of welfare, it is these feelings that should be assessed.\\" Dawkins wrote, \\"Let us not mince words: Animal welfare involves the subjective feelings of animals.\\" Welfare biology ‚Äì Yew-Kwang Ng defines animal welfare in terms of welfare economics: \\"Welfare biology is the study of living things and their environment with respect to their welfare (defined as net happiness, or enjoyment minus suffering). Despite difficulties of ascertaining and measuring welfare and relevancy to normative issues, welfare biology is a positive science.\\" Dictionary definition ‚Äì In the Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, animal welfare is defined as \\"the avoidance of abuse and exploitation of animals by humans by maintaining appropriate standards of accommodation, feeding and general care, the prevention and treatment of disease and the assurance of freedom from harassment, and unnecessary discomfort and pain.\\" American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) has defined animal welfare as: \\"An animal is in a good state of welfare if (as indicated by scientific evidence) it is healthy, comfortable, well nourished, safe, able to express innate behavior, and if it is not suffering from unpleasant states such as pain, fear, and distress.\\" They have offered the following eight principles for developing and evaluating animal welfare policies. * The responsible use of animals for human purposes, such as companionship, food, fiber, recreation, work, education, exhibition, and research conducted for the benefit of both humans and animals, is consistent with the Veterinarian's Oath. * Decisions regarding animal care, use, and welfare shall be made by balancing scientific knowledge and professional judgment with consideration of ethical and societal values. * Animals must be provided water, food, proper handling, health care, and an environment appropriate to their care and use, with thoughtful consideration for their species-typical biology and behavior. * Animals should be cared for in ways that minimize fear, pain, stress, and suffering. * Procedures related to animal housing, management, care, and use should be continuously evaluated, and when indicated, refined or replaced. * Conservation and management of animal populations should be humane, socially responsible, and scientifically prudent. * Animals shall be treated with respect and dignity throughout their lives and, when necessary, provided a humane death. * The veterinary profession shall continually strive to improve animal health and welfare through scientific research, education, collaboration, advocacy, and the development of legislation and regulations. Terrestrial Animal Health Code of World Organisation for Animal Health defines animal welfare as \\"how an animal is coping with the conditions in which it lives. An animal is in a good state of welfare if (as indicated by scientific evidence) it is healthy, comfortable, well nourished, safe, able to express innate behaviour, and if it is not suffering from unpleasant states such as pain, fear, and distress. Good animal welfare requires disease prevention and veterinary treatment, appropriate shelter, management, nutrition, humane handling and humane slaughter/killing. Animal welfare refers to the state of the animal; the treatment that an animal receives is covered by other terms such as animal care, animal husbandry, and humane treatment.\\" Coping ‚Äì Professor Donald Broom defines the welfare of an animal as \\"Its state as regards its attempts to cope with its environment. This state includes how much it is having to do to cope, the extent to which it is succeeding in or failing to cope, and its associated feelings.\\" He states that \\"welfare will vary over a continuum from very good to very poor and studies of welfare will be most effective if a wide range of measures is used.\\" John Webster criticized this definition for making \\"no attempt to say what constitutes good or bad welfare.\\"John Webster. Animal Welfare: Limping Towards Eden. 2008. Page 5 Attitudes Animal welfare often refers to a utilitarian attitude towards the well-being of nonhuman animals. It believes the animals can be exploited if the animal suffering and the costs of use is less than the benefits to humans. This attitude is also known simply as welfarism. An example of welfarist thought is Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's meat manifesto. Point three of eight is: Robert Garner describes the welfarist position as the most widely held in modern society.Garner, Robert. Animal Ethics. Polity Press, 2005, pp. 15-16. He states that one of the best attempts to clarify this position is given by Robert Nozick:Garner, Robert. (2005). Animal Ethics. Polity Press. p. 72 Welfarism is often contrasted with the animal rights and animal liberation positions, which hold that animals should not be used by humans and should not be regarded as human property.Garner 2005, p. 15; However, it has been argued that both welfarism and animal liberation only make sense if it is assumed that animals have \\"subjective welfare\\". =New welfarism= New welfarism was coined by Gary L. Francione in 1996. It is a view that the best way to prevent animal suffering is to abolish the causes of animal suffering, but advancing animal welfare is a goal to pursue in the short term. Thus, for instance, new welfarists want to phase out fur farms and animal experiments but in the short-term they try to improve conditions for the animals in these systems, so they lobby to make cages less constrictive and to reduce the numbers of animals used in laboratories. Within the context of animal research, many scientific organisations believe that improved animal welfare will provide improved scientific outcomes. If an animal in a laboratory is suffering stress or pain it could negatively affect the results of the research. Increased affluence in many regions for the past few decades afforded consumers the disposable income to purchase products from high welfare systems.Phillips 2009. pp 60-63. The adaptation of more economically efficient farming systems in these regions were at the expense of animal welfare and to the financial benefit of consumers, both of which were factors in driving the demand for higher welfare for farm animals. A 2006 survey concluded that a majority (63%) of EU citizens \\"show some willingness to change their usual place of shopping in order to be able to purchase more animal welfare-friendly products.\\" The volume of scientific research on animal welfare has also increased significantly in some countries.Phillips 2009. p 60. Criticisms =Denial of duties to animals= Some individuals in history have, at least in principle, rejected the view that humans have duties of any kind to animals. Augustine of Hippo seemed to take such a position in his writings against those he saw as heretics: \\"For we see and hear by their cries that animals die with pain, although man disregards this in a beast, with which, as not having a rational soul, we have no community of rights.\\" =Animal rights= American philosopher Tom Regan has criticized the animal welfare movement for not going far enough to protect animals' interests. Animal rights advocates, such as Gary L. Francione and Tom Regan, argue that the animal welfare position (advocating for the betterment of the condition of animals, but without abolishing animal use) is inconsistent in logic and ethically unacceptable. However, there are some animal right groups, such as PETA, which support animal welfare measures in the short term to alleviate animal suffering until all animal use is ended.Interview with Ingrid Newkirk, David Shankbone, Wikinews, November 20, 2007. According to PETA's Ingrid Newkirk in an interview with Wikinews, there are two issues in animal welfare and animal rights. \\"If I only could have one thing, it would be to end suffering\\", said Newkirk. \\"If you could take things from animals and kill animals all day long without causing them suffering, then I would take it... Everybody should be able to agree that animals should not suffer if you kill them or steal from them by taking the fur off their backs or take their eggs, whatever. But you shouldn't put them through torture to do that.\\" Abolitionism holds that focusing on animal welfare not only fails to challenge animal suffering, but may actually prolong it by making the exercise of property rights over animals appear less unattractive. The abolitionists' objective is to secure a moral and legal paradigm shift, whereby animals are no longer regarded as property. In recent years documentaries such as watchdominion.com have been produced, exposing the suffering occurring in animal agriculture facilities that are marketed as having high welfare standards. Animal welfare organizations =Global= World Animal Protection was founded in 1981 to protection animals around the globe. World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE): The intergovernmental organisation responsible for improving animal health worldwide. The OIE has been established \\"for the purpose of projects of international public utility relating to the control of animal diseases, including those affecting humans and the promotion of animal welfare and animal production food safety.\\" World Animal Protection: Protects animals across the globe. World Animal Protection's objectives include helping people understand the critical importance of good animal welfare, encouraging nations to commit to animal-friendly practices, and building the scientific case for the better treatment of animals. They are global in a sense that they have consultative status at the Council of Europe and collaborate with national governments, the United Nations, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Organization for Animal Health. =Non-government organizations= Canadian Council on Animal Care: The national organization responsible for overseeing the care and use of animals involved in Canadian Science. Canadian Federation of Humane Societies (CFHS): The only national organization representing humane societies and SPCAs in Canada. They provide leadership on animal welfare issues and spread the message across Canada. The Canadian Veterinary Medical Association: Brings in veterinary involvement to animal welfare. Their objective is to share this concern of animals with all members of the profession, with the general public, with government at all levels, and with other organizations such as the CFHS, which have similar concerns. Compassion in World Farming: Founded over 40 years ago in 1967 by a British farmer who became horrified by the development of modern, intensive factory farming. \\"Today we campaign peacefully to end all cruel factory farming practices. We believe that the biggest cause of cruelty on the planet deserves a focused, specialised approach ‚Äì so we only work on farm animal welfare.\\" The Movement for Compassionate Living: Exists to- \\"Promote simple vegan living and self-reliance as a remedy against the exploitation of humans, animals and the Earth. Promote the use of trees and vegan-organic farming to meet the needs of society for food and natural resources. Promote a land-based society where as much of our food and resources as possible are produced locally.\\" National Animal Interest Alliance: An animal welfare organization in the United States founded in 1991 promotes the welfare of animals, strengthens the human-animal bond, and safeguards the rights of responsible animal owners, enthusiasts and professionals through research, public information and sound public policy. They host an online library of information about various animal-related subjects serving as a resource for groups and individuals dedicated to responsible animal care and well-being. National Farm Animal Care Council: Their objectives are to facilitate collaboration among members with respect to farm animal care issues in Canada, to facilitate information sharing and communication, and to monitor trends and initiatives in both the domestic and international market place. National Office of Animal Health: A British organisation that represents its members drawn from the animal medicines industry. Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals: A registered charity comprising over 50 communities. Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals: A well-known animal welfare charity in England and Wales, founded in 1824. Universities Federation for Animal Welfare: A UK registered charity, established in 1926, that works to develop and promote improvements in the welfare of all animals through scientific and educational activity worldwide.

Definition A splitting field of a polynomial p(X) over a field K is a field extension L of K over which p factors into linear factors :p(X) = c\\\\prod_{i=1}^{\\\\deg(p)} (X - a_i) where c\\\\in K and for each i we have (X - a_i) \\\\in L[X] with ai not necessarily distinct and such that the roots ai generate L over K. The extension L is then an extension of minimal degree over K in which p splits. It can be shown that such splitting fields exist and are unique up to isomorphism. The amount of freedom in that isomorphism is known as the Galois group of p (if we assume it is separable). Properties An extension L which is a splitting field for a set of polynomials p(X) over K is called a normal extension of K. Given an algebraically closed field A containing K, there is a unique splitting field L of p between K and A, generated by the roots of p. If K is a subfield of the complex numbers, the existence is immediate. On the other hand, the existence of algebraic closures in general is often proved by 'passing to the limit' from the splitting field result, which therefore requires an independent proof to avoid circular reasoning. Given a separable extension K‚Ä≤ of K, a Galois closure L of K‚Ä≤ is a type of splitting field, and also a Galois extension of K containing K‚Ä≤ that is minimal, in an obvious sense. Such a Galois closure should contain a splitting field for all the polynomials p over K that are minimal polynomials over K of elements a of K‚Ä≤. Constructing splitting fields =Motivation= Finding roots of polynomials has been an important problem since the time of the ancient Greeks. Some polynomials, however, such as over , the real numbers, have no roots. By constructing the splitting field for such a polynomial one can find the roots of the polynomial in the new field. =The construction= Let F be a field and p(X) be a polynomial in the polynomial ring F[X] of degree n. The general process for constructing K, the splitting field of p(X) over F, is to construct a sequence of fields F=K_0, K_1, \\\\ldots K_{r-1}, K_r=K such that Ki is an extension of Ki‚àí1 containing a new root of p(X). Since p(X) has at most n roots the construction will require at most n extensions. The steps for constructing Ki are given as follows: * Factorize p(X) over Ki into irreducible factors f_1(X)f_2(X) \\\\cdots f_k(X). * Choose any nonlinear irreducible factor f(X) = fi(X). * Construct the field extension Ki+1 of Ki as the quotient ring Ki+1 = Ki[X]/(f(X)) where (f(X)) denotes the ideal in Ki[X] generated by f(X) * Repeat the process for Ki+1 until p(X) completely factors. The irreducible factor fi used in the quotient construction may be chosen arbitrarily. Although different choices of factors may lead to different subfield sequences, the resulting splitting fields will be isomorphic. Since f(X) is irreducible, (f(X)) is a maximal ideal and hence Ki[X]/(f(X)) is, in fact, a field. Moreover, if we let \\\\pi : K_i[X] \\\\to K_i[X]/(f(X)) be the natural projection of the ring onto its quotient then :f(\\\\pi(X)) = \\\\pi(f(X)) = f(X)\\\\ \\\\bmod\\\\ f(X) = 0 so œÄ(X) is a root of f(X) and of p(X). The degree of a single extension [K_{i+1} : K_i] is equal to the degree of the irreducible factor f(X). The degree of the extension [K : F] is given by [K_r : K_{r-1}] \\\\cdots [K_2 : K_1] [K_1 : F] and is at most n!. = The field Ki[X]/(f(X)) = As mentioned above, the quotient ring Ki+1 = Ki[X]/(f(X)) is a field when f(X) is irreducible. Its elements are of the form :c_{n-1}\\\\alpha^{n-1} + c_{n-2}\\\\alpha^{n-2} + \\\\cdots + c_1\\\\alpha + c_0 where the cj are in Ki and Œ± = œÄ(X). (If one considers Ki+1 as a vector space over Ki then the powers Œ±j for form a basis.) The elements of Ki+1 can be considered as polynomials in Œ± of degree less than n. Addition in Ki+1 is given by the rules for polynomial addition and multiplication is given by polynomial multiplication modulo f(X). That is, for g(Œ±) and h(Œ±) in Ki+1 the product g(Œ±)h(Œ±) = r(Œ±) where r(X) is the remainder of g(X)h(X) divided by f(X) in Ki[X]. The remainder r(X) can be computed through long division of polynomials, however there is also a straightforward reduction rule that can be used to compute r(Œ±) = g(Œ±)h(Œ±) directly. First let :f(X) = X^n + b_{n-1} X^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + b_1 X + b_0. The polynomial is over a field so one can take f(X) to be monic without loss of generality. Now Œ± is a root of f(X), so :\\\\alpha^n = -(b_{n-1} \\\\alpha^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + b_1 \\\\alpha + b_0). If the product g(Œ±)h(Œ±) has a term Œ±m with it can be reduced as follows: :\\\\alpha^n\\\\alpha^{m-n} = -\\\\left( b_{n-1} \\\\alpha^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + b_1 \\\\alpha + b_0 \\\\right) \\\\alpha^{m-n} = -\\\\left( b_{n-1} \\\\alpha^{m-1} + \\\\cdots + b_1 \\\\alpha^{m-n+1} + b_0 \\\\alpha^{m-n} \\\\right) . As an example of the reduction rule, take Ki = Q[X], the ring of polynomials with rational coefficients, and take f(X) = X7 ‚àí 2. Let g(\\\\alpha) = \\\\alpha^5 + \\\\alpha^2 and h(Œ±) = Œ±3 +1 be two elements of Q[X]/(X7 ‚àí 2). The reduction rule given by f(X) is Œ±7 = 2 so :g(\\\\alpha) h(\\\\alpha) = \\\\left(\\\\alpha^5 + \\\\alpha^2\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\alpha^3 + 1\\\\right) = \\\\alpha^8 + 2 \\\\alpha^5 + \\\\alpha^2 = \\\\left(\\\\alpha^7\\\\right) \\\\alpha + 2\\\\alpha^5 + \\\\alpha^2 = 2 \\\\alpha^5 + \\\\alpha^2 + 2\\\\alpha. Examples = The complex numbers = Consider the polynomial ring R[x], and the irreducible polynomial The quotient ring is given by the congruence As a result, the elements (or equivalence classes) of are of the form where a and b belong to R. To see this, note that since it follows that , , , etc.; and so, for example The addition and multiplication operations are given by firstly using ordinary polynomial addition and multiplication, but then reducing modulo , i.e. using the fact that , , , , etc. Thus: : (a_1 + b_1x) + (a_2 + b_2x) = (a_1 + a_2) + (b_1 + b_2)x, : (a_1 + b_1x)(a_2 + b_2x) = a_1a_2 + (a_1b_2 + b_1a_2)x + (b_1b_2)x^2 \\\\equiv (a_1a_2 - b_1b_2) + (a_1b_2 + b_1a_2)x \\\\, . If we identify with (a,b) then we see that addition and multiplication are given by : (a_1,b_1) + (a_2,b_2) = (a_1 + a_2,b_1 + b_2), : (a_1,b_1)\\\\cdot (a_2,b_2) = (a_1a_2 - b_1b_2,a_1b_2 + b_1a_2). We claim that, as a field, the quotient is isomorphic to the complex numbers, C. A general complex number is of the form , where a and b are real numbers and Addition and multiplication are given by : (a_1 + ib_1) + (a_2 + ib_2) = (a_1 + a_2) + i(b_1 + b_2), : (a_1 + ib_1) \\\\cdot (a_2 + ib_2) = (a_1a_2 - b_1b_2) + i(a_1b_2 + a_2b_1). If we identify with (a,b) then we see that addition and multiplication are given by : (a_1,b_1) + (a_2,b_2) = (a_1 + a_2,b_1 + b_2), : (a_1,b_1)\\\\cdot (a_2,b_2) = (a_1a_2 - b_1b_2,a_1b_2 + b_1a_2). The previous calculations show that addition and multiplication behave the same way in and C. In fact, we see that the map between and C given by is a homomorphism with respect to addition and multiplication. It is also obvious that the map is both injective and surjective; meaning that is a bijective homomorphism, i.e. an isomorphism. It follows that, as claimed: In 1847, Cauchy used this approach to define the complex numbers. = Cubic example = Let be the rational number field and . Each root of equals times a cube root of unity. Therefore, if we denote the cube roots of unity by :\\\\omega_1 = 1, \\\\, :\\\\omega_2 = - \\\\frac{1} {2} + \\\\frac {\\\\sqrt{3}} {2} i, :\\\\omega_3 = - \\\\frac{1} {2} - \\\\frac {\\\\sqrt{3}} {2} i. any field containing two distinct roots of will contain the quotient between two distinct cube roots of unity. Such a quotient is a primitive cube root of unity‚Äîeither œâ2 or \\\\omega_3=1/\\\\omega_2. It follows that a splitting field of will contain œâ2, as well as the real cube root of 2; conversely, any extension of containing these elements contains all the roots of . Thus :L=\\\\mathbf{Q} \\\\left (\\\\sqrt[3]{2},\\\\omega_2 \\\\right )= \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\left. a + b\\\\sqrt[3]{2} + c\\\\sqrt[3]{2^2} + d\\\\omega_2 + e\\\\sqrt[3]{2}\\\\omega_2 + f\\\\sqrt[3]{2^2} \\\\omega_2 \\\\right  a,b,c,d,e,f\\\\in\\\\mathbf{Q} \\\\right \\\\\\\\} Note that applying the construction process outlined in the previous section to this example, one begins with K_0 = \\\\mathbf{Q} and constructs the field K_1 = \\\\mathbf{Q}[X] / (X^3 - 2). This field is not the splitting field, but contains one (any) root. However, the polynomial Y^3 - 2 is not irreducible over K_1 and in fact: :Y^3 -2 = (Y - X)(Y^2 + XY + X^2). Note that X is not an indeterminate, and is in fact an element of K_1. Now, continuing the process, we obtain K_2 = K_1[Y] / (Y^2 + XY + X^2) which is indeed the splitting field and is spanned by the \\\\mathbf{Q}-basis \\\\\\\\{1, X, X^2, Y, XY, X^2 Y\\\\\\\\}. Notice that if we compare this with L from above we can identify X = \\\\sqrt[3]{2} and Y = \\\\omega_2. =Other examples= * The splitting field of xq \\\\- x over Fp is the unique finite field Fq for q = pn. Sometimes this field is denoted by GF(q). * The splitting field of x2 \\\\+ 1 over F7 is F49; the polynomial has no roots in F7, i.e., ‚àí1 is not a square there, because 7 is not equivalent to 1 (mod 4).Instead of applying this characterization of odd prime moduli for which ‚àí1 is a square, one could just check that the set of squares in F7 is the set of classes of 0, 1, 4, and 2, which does not include the class of ‚àí1‚â°6. * The splitting field of x2 ‚àí 1 over F7 is F7 since x2 ‚àí 1 = (x + 1)(x ‚àí 1) already factors into linear factors. * We calculate the splitting field of f(x) = x3 \\\\+ x + 1 over F2. It is easy to verify that f(x) has no roots in F2, hence f(x) is irreducible in F2[x]. Put r = x + (f(x)) in F2[x]/(f(x)) so F2(r) is a field and x3 \\\\+ x + 1 = (x + r)(x2 \\\\+ ax + b) in F2(r)[x]. Note that we can write + for ‚àí since the characteristic is two. Comparison of coefficients shows that a = r and b = 1 + r2. The elements of F2(r) can be listed as c + dr + er2, where c, d, e are in F2. There are eight elements: 0, 1, r, 1 + r, r2, 1 + r2, r + r2 and 1 + r + r2. Substituting these in x2 \\\\+ rx + 1 + r2 we reach (r2)2 \\\\+ r(r2) + 1 + r2 = r4 \\\\+ r3 \\\\+ 1 + r2 = 0, therefore x3 \\\\+ x + 1 = (x + r)(x + r2)(x + (r + r2)) for r in F2[x]/(f(x)); E = F2(r) is a splitting field of x3 \\\\+ x + 1 over F2.

In the Bible, the name Azazel appears in association with the scapegoat rite; the name represents a desolate place where a scapegoat bearing the sins of the Jews during Yom Kippur was sent. During the Second Temple period, he appears as a fallen angel responsible for introducing humans to forbidden knowledge. His role as a fallen angel partly remains in Christian and Islamic traditions. Bible =Hebrew Bible= \\"And Aaron shall cast lots\\" In the Hebrew Bible, the term is used thrice in Leviticus 16, where two male goats were to be sacrificed to Yahweh and one of the two was selected by lot, for Yahweh is seen as speaking through the lots. One goat is selected by lot and sent into the wilderness , \\"for Azazel\\". This goat was then cast out in the desert as part of Yom Kippur. In older English versions, such as the King James Version, the phrase la-azazel is translated as \\"as a scapegoat\\"; however, in most modern English Bible translations, it is represented as a name in the text: Later rabbis, interpreting azazel as azaz (rugged) and el (of God), take it as referring to the rugged and rough mountain cliff from which the goat was cast down.Yoma 67b; Sifra, A·∏•are, ii. 2; Targ. Yer. Lev. xiv. 10, and most medieval commentatorsFor a delineation of the various Rabbinic opinions here, see R. Aryeh Kaplan's note on \\"Azazel\\" (Lev 16:8). = In Greek Septuagint and later translations = The translators of the Greek Septuagint understood the Hebrew term as meaning \\"the sent away\\", and read: Following the Septuagint, the Latin Vulgate,16:8 mittens super utrumque sortem unam Domino et alteram capro emissario Martin Luther3 Mose 16:8 German: Luther (1545) Und soll das Los werfen √ºber die zween B√∂cke, ein Los dem HERRN und das andere dem ledigen Bock. and the King James Version also give readings such as Young's Literal Translation: \\"And Aaron hath given lots over the two goats, one lot for Jehovah, and one lot for a goat of departure'\\".

Zeit.\\" 1864, pp. 196‚Äì204 According to the Book of Enoch (a book of the Apocrypha), Azazel (here spelled ‚ÄòƒÉzƒÅ‚Äôzyƒìl) was one of the chief Grigori, a group of fallen angels who married women. Many believe that this same story (without any mention of Azazel) is told in the book of Genesis 6:2‚Äì4: \\"That the sons of God (◊ë÷∞÷º◊†÷µ÷§◊ô ◊î÷∏÷Ω◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù÷ô: ben√™‚Äô æƒõl≈ç¬∑h√Æm) saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. [‚Ä¶] There were giants in the earth in those days; and also afterward, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bore children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.\\" Some believe, however, that the reference to \\"sons of God\\" in this passage is referring to men in that God formed man from the ground, and women from men book of Genesis 2:7,23. They cite nine other places that refer to men as \\"sons of God\\": Deuteronomy 14:1, 32:5, Psalm 73:15, Isaiah 43:6-7, Hosea 1:10, 11:1, Luke 3:38, 1 John 3:1-2, 10. They also claim that Hebrews 1:5 \\"For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?\\" argues that God never referred to angels as his sons. Because of these things they see the \\"sons of God\\" as merely men. But the nine passages referred to above are all based on simple English translation comparison and not an actual Hebrew textual comparison with Genesis 6:1-4, which contextually places the daughters of men into one group representing humanity (Gen 6:1 \\"And it happened that, when humankind began to multiply on the face of the ground, daughters were born to them\\"), and the \\"sons of God\\" (◊ë÷∞÷º◊†÷µ÷§◊ô ◊î÷∏÷Ω◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù÷ô: ben√™‚Äô æƒõl≈ç¬∑h√Æm) into a second group. None of those nine passages refer to the ben√™‚Äô æƒõl≈ç¬∑h√Æm, but only to English translation references to Israel, Judah, and as God's children. The six Old Testament passages cited do not support the claim that \\"sons of God\\" is referring to all humanity, but only that God did refer to Israel and Judah as his children. Though the end of Luke 3:38 is translated into English as \\"son of God\\", it simply says \\"of God\\" in the Greek. In 1 John 3, the author, who refers to his audience as \\"my little children\\", does, indeed, proclaim that those who are in Christ (1 John 1:28) are God's children, but this has nothing to do with the ben√™‚Äô æƒõl≈ç¬∑h√Æm of Gen 6 because they existed thousands of years before any Christians. And since Israel also did not exist until thousands of years after the events of Gen 6, the ben√™‚Äô æƒõl≈ç¬∑h√Æm cannot be referring to them either. The only other usage of ben√™‚Äô æƒõl≈ç¬∑h√Æm in the Hebrew Bible is found in Job 1:6, and Job 2:1, both of which refer to supernatural beings. These three verses are the only ben√™‚Äô æƒõl≈ç¬∑h√Æm verses in all of the Hebrew Masoretic Text, which was finalized around 1000 a.d. But the ancient understanding of ben√™‚Äô æƒõl≈ç¬∑h√Æm as supernatural beings was so firmly established over the history of Israel and Judah that in the Septuagint, which was completed some time between the 3rd and 1st century b.c,https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical- topics/bible-versions-and-translations/the-original-bible-and-the-dead-sea- scrolls/ the term \\"sons of God\\" is replaced with \\"angels of God\\" in all three of these verses.http://ecmarsh.com/lxx/Job/index.htm Thus demonstrating that the translators of the Septuagint did not consider ben√™‚Äô æƒõl≈ç¬∑h√Æm a matter of question, but rather a matter of fact: they were supernatural beings. Enoch portrays Azazel as responsible for teaching people to make weapons and cosmetics, for which he was cast out of heaven. The Book of Enoch 8:1‚Äì3a reads, \\"And Azazel taught men to make swords and knives and shields and breastplates; and made known to them the metals [of the earth] and the art of working them; and bracelets and ornaments; and the use of antimony and the beautifying of the eyelids; and all kinds of costly stones and all colouring tinctures. And there arose much godlessness, and they committed fornication, and they were led astray and became corrupt in all their ways.\\" The corruption brought on by Azazel and the Grigori degrades the human race, and the four archangels (Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel) ‚Äúsaw much blood being shed upon the earth and all lawlessness being wrought upon the earth [‚Ä¶] The souls of men [made] their suit, saying, \\"Bring our cause before the Most High; [‚Ä¶] Thou seest what Azazel hath done, who hath taught all unrighteousness on earth and revealed the eternal secrets which were in heaven, which men were striving to learn.\\" God sees the sin brought about by Azazel and has Raphael ‚Äúbind Azazel hand and foot and cast him into the darkness: and make an opening in the desert ‚Äì which is in Dudael ‚Äì and cast him therein. And place upon him rough and jagged rocks, and cover him with darkness, and let him abide there forever, and cover his face that he may not see light.‚Äù Azazel's fate is foretold near the end of Enoch 2:8, where God says, ‚ÄúOn the day of the great judgement he shall be cast into the fire.‚Äù Several scholars have previously discerned that some details of Azazel's punishment are reminiscent of the scapegoat rite. Thus, Lester Grabbe points to a number of parallels between the Azazel narrative in Enoch and the wording of Leviticus 16, including \\"the similarity of the names Asael and Azazel; the punishment in the desert; the placing of sin on Asael/Azazel; the resultant healing of the land.\\"Andrei Orlov (2009), \\"Azazel as the Celestial Scapegoat\\". An excerpt (pp. 79-111) from his contribution \\"The Eschatological Yom Kippur in the Apocalypse of Abraham: Part I: The Scapegoat Ritual\\" to A. Orlov and B. Louri√©, eds., Symbola Caelestis. Le symbolisme liturgique et paraliturgique dans le monde Chr√©tien. Daniel St√∂kl also observes that \\"the punishment of the demon resembles the treatment of the goat in aspects of geography, action, time and purpose.\\" Thus, the place of Asael‚Äôs punishment designated in Enoch as Dudael is reminiscent of the rabbinic terminology used for the designation of the ravine of the scapegoat in later rabbinic interpretations of the Yom Kippur ritual. St√∂kl remarks that \\"the name of place of judgment (Dudael) is conspicuously similar in both traditions and can likely be traced to a common origin.\\" Azazel in 1 Enoch has striking similarities to the Greek Titan Prometheus. He might be a demonized counterpart of a heavenly creature, who provided knowledge for people to make weapons, thus causing bloodshed and injustice. The latter might be identified with Greek kings and generals, who suppressed the Jews with military forces, but learned how to make their weapons by this specific expelled creature.George W. E. Nickelsburg. Apocalyptic and Myth in 1 Enoch 6-11. Journal of Biblical Literature, vol. 96, no. 3, 1977, pp. 383‚Äì405 In the fifth-century 3 Enoch, Azazel is one of the three angels (Azza [Shemhazai] and Uzza [Ouza] are the other two) who opposed Enoch's high rank when he became the angel Metatron. Whilst they were fallen at this time they were still in Heaven, but Metatron held a dislike for them, and had them cast out. = In the Apocalypse of Abraham = In the extra- canonical text the Apocalypse of Abraham (c.1st CE), Azazel is portrayed as an unclean bird who came down upon the sacrifice which Abraham prepared. (This is in reference to Genesis 15:11: \\"Birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away\\" [NIV]). The text also associates Azazel with the serpent and hell. In Chapter 23, verse 7, it is described as having seven heads, 14 faces, \\"hands and feet like a man's [and] on his back six wings on the right and six on the left.\\" Abraham says that the wicked will \\"putrefy in the belly of the crafty worm Azazel, and be burned by the fire of Azazel's tongue\\" (Abr. 31:5), and earlier says to Azazel himself, \\"May you be the firebrand of the furnace of the earth! Go, Azazel, into the untrodden parts of the earth. For your heritage is over those who are with you\\" (Abr. 14:5‚Äì6). Here there is the idea that God's heritage (the created world) is largely under the dominion of evil ‚Äì i.e., it is \\"shared with Azazel\\" (Abr. 20:5), again identifying him with Satan, who was called \\"the prince of this world\\" by Jesus. ( niv) =Rabbinical Judaism= The Mishnah (Yoma 39aYoma 39) follows the Hebrew Bible text; two goats were procured, similar in respect of appearance, height, cost, and time of selection. Having one of these on his right and the other on his left, the high priest, who was assisted in this rite by two subordinates, put both his hands into a wooden case, and took out two labels, one inscribed \\"for Yahweh\\" and the other \\"for Azazel\\". The high priest then laid his hands with the labels upon the two goats and said, \\"A sin-offering to Yahweh\\" (thus speaking the Tetragrammaton); and the two men accompanying him replied, \\"Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever.\\" He then fastened a scarlet woolen thread to the head of the goat \\"for Azazel\\"; and laying his hands upon it again, recited the following confession of sin and prayer for forgiveness: \\"O Lord, I have acted iniquitously, trespassed, sinned before Thee: I, my household, and the sons of Aaron Thy holy ones. O Lord, forgive the iniquities, transgressions, and sins that I, my household, and Aaron's children, Thy holy people, committed before Thee, as is written in the law of Moses, Thy servant, 'for on this day He will forgive you, to cleanse you from all your sins before the Lord; ye shall be clean.'\\" This prayer was responded to by the congregation present. A man was selected, preferably a priest, to take the goat to the precipice in the wilderness; and he was accompanied part of the way by the most eminent men of Jerusalem. Ten booths had been constructed at intervals along the road leading from Jerusalem to the steep mountain. At each one of these the man leading the goat was formally offered food and drink, which he, however, refused. When he reached the tenth booth those who accompanied him proceeded no further, but watched the ceremony from a distance. When he came to the precipice he divided the scarlet thread into two parts, one of which he tied to the rock and the other to the goat's horns, and then pushed the goat down (Yoma vi. 1‚Äì8). The cliff was so high and rugged that before the goat had traversed half the distance to the plain below, its limbs were utterly shattered. Men were stationed at intervals along the way, and as soon as the goat was thrown down the precipice, they signaled to one another by means of kerchiefs or flags, until the information reached the high priest, whereat he proceeded with the other parts of the ritual. The scarlet thread is symbolically referenced in ; and the Talmud states (ib. 39a) that during the forty years that Simeon the Just was High Priest of Israel, the thread actually turned white as soon as the goat was thrown over the precipice: a sign that the sins of the people were forgiven. In later times the change to white was not invariable: a proof of the people's moral and spiritual deterioration, that was gradually on the increase, until forty years before the destruction of the Second Temple, when the change of color was no longer observed (l.c. 39b).  Medieval Jewish commentators  The medieval scholar Nahmanides (1194‚Äì1270) identified the Hebrew text as also referring to a demon, and identified this \\"Azazel\\" with Samael.Israel Drazin, Stanley M. Wagner, . Gefen, 2008. p. 122. . However, he did not see the sending of the goat as honouring Azazel as a deity, but as a symbolic expression of the idea that the people's sins and their evil consequences were to be sent back to the spirit of desolation and ruin, the source of all impurity. The very fact that the two goats were presented before God, before the one was sacrificed and the other sent into the wilderness, was proof that Azazel was not ranked alongside God, but regarded simply as the personification of wickedness in contrast with the righteous government of God. Maimonides (1134‚Äì1204) says that as sins cannot be taken off one‚Äôs head and transferred elsewhere, the ritual is symbolic, enabling the penitent to discard his sins: ‚ÄúThese ceremonies are of a symbolic character and serve to impress man with a certain idea and to lead him to repent, as if to say, ‚ÄòWe have freed ourselves of our previous deeds, cast them behind our backs and removed them from us as far as possible‚Äô.‚ÄùGuide to the Perplexed 3:46, featured on the Internet Sacred Text Archive The rite, resembling, on one hand, the sending off of the basket with the woman embodying wickedness to the land of Shinar in the vision of Zechariah (), and, on the other, the letting loose of the living bird into the open field in the case of the leper healed from the plague (), was, indeed, viewed by the people of Jerusalem as a means of ridding themselves of the sins of the year. So would the crowd, called Babylonians or Alexandrians, pull the goat's hair to make it hasten forth, carrying the burden of sins away with it (Yoma vi. 4, 66b; \\"Epistle of Barnabas,\\" vii.), and the arrival of the shattered animal at the bottom of the valley of the rock of Bet ·∏§adudo, twelve miles away from the city, was signalized by the waving of shawls to the people of Jerusalem, who celebrated the event with boisterous hilarity and amid dancing on the hills (Yoma vi. 6, 8; Ta'an. iv. 8). Evidently the figure of Azazel was an object of general fear and awe rather than, as has been conjectured, a foreign product or the invention of a late lawgiver. More as a demon of the desert, it seems to have been closely interwoven with the mountainous region of Jerusalem. In Christianity =Latin Bible= The Vulgate contains no mention of \\"Azazel\\" but only of caper emissarius, or \\"emissary goat\\": English versions, such as the King James version, followed the Septuagint and Vulgate in understanding the term as relating to a goat. The modern English Standard Version provides the footnote \\"16:8 The meaning of Azazel is uncertain; possibly the name of a place or a demon, traditionally a scapegoat; also verses 10, 26\\". Most scholars accept the indication of some kind of demon or deity,Wright, David P. \\"Azazel.\\" Pages 1:536‚Äì37 in Anchor Bible Series. Edited by David Noel Freedman et al. New York: Doubleday, 1992. however Judit M. Blair notes that this is an argument without supporting contemporary text evidence.Judit M. Blair De- demonising the Old Testament: An Investigation of Azazel, Lilith, Deber p. 23‚Äì24 Ida Zatelli (1998)Ida Zatelli, \\"The Origin of the Biblical Scapegoat Ritual: The Evidence of Two Eblaite Texts\\", Vetus Testamentum 48.2 (April 1998):254‚Äì263) has suggested that the Hebrew ritual parallels pagan practice of sending a scapegoat into the desert on the occasion of a royal wedding found in two ritual texts in archives at Ebla (24th C. BC). A she-goat with a silver bracelet hung from her neck was driven forth into the wasteland of 'Alini' by the community.David Pearson Wright, . Scholars Press, University of Michigan, 1987. There is no mention of an \\"Azazel\\".Blair p. 21 According to The Expositor's Bible Commentary, Azazel is the Hebrew word for scapegoat. This is the only place that the Hebrew word is found in the whole Hebrew Old Testament. It says that the Book of Enoch, (extra-biblical Jewish theological literature, dated around 200 B.C.) is full of demonology and reference to fallen angels. The EBC (Vol 2) says that this text uses late Aramaic forms for these names which indicates that The Book of Enoch most likely relies upon the Hebrew Leviticus text rather than the Leviticus text being reliant upon the Book of Enoch. =Christian commentators= Cyril of Alexandria sees the apompaios (sent-away one, scapegoat) as a foretype of Christ. Origen (\\"Contra Celsum,\\" vi. 43) identifies Azazel with Satan.John Granger Cook The interpretation of the Old Testament in Greco-Roman paganism 299 In Islam In Islam, Azazel appears in relation to the story of Harut and Marut, a pair of angels mentioned in the Quran. Although not explained by the Quran itself, Muslim exegetes, such as Al-Kalbi and Al-Tha\`labi,Johannes Hendrik Kramers Shorter Encyclopaedia of Islam uzac Verlag, 1961 p. 135 usually linked the reason of their abode to a narration related to the Watchers known from 3 Enoch. Just as in 3 Enoch, angels complained about humans iniquity, whereupon God offered a test, that the angels might choose three among them to descend to earth, endowed with bodily desires, and proof that they would do better than humans under the same conditions. Accordingly, they choose Aza, Azzaya and Azazel. However, Azazel repented his decision and God allowed him to turn back to heaven. The other two angels failed the test and their names were changed to Harut and Marut. They ended up on earth, introducing men to illicit magic.Haggai Ben-Shammai, Shaul Shaked, Sarah Stroumsa (and Patricia Crone in this certain chapter) Exchange and transmission across cultural boundaries Yehuda Greenbaum 2005 p. 30Kristof d' Hulster, J. van Steenbergen Continuity and Change in the Realms of Islam: Studies in Honour of Professor Urbain Vermeulen Isd, 2008 p. 192 See also * Azazel (Marvel Comics) * Azazel in popular culture * Baphomet * Dudael * Lucifer * The Master and Margarita * Palorchestes azael (Australian large extinct marsupial) * Samyaza * Scapegoat * Watcher (angel) * Zazel (spirit) * Zazel (erotic art film 1997) References Angels in Islam Book of Leviticus Demons in the Old Testament apocrypha Hebrew words and phrases in the Hebrew Bible Hell (Christianity) Javanese folklore Jewish underworld Satan Watchers (angels) Yom Kippur Devils Fallen angels ","title":"Azazel"},{"id":"174444","text":"Tomme de Savoie is an uplandJoel Robuchon et al., Larousse Gastronomique (New York, New York: Clarkson Potter, 2001), page 1220. variety of Tomme cheese, specifically, one from Savoy in the French Alps. It is a mild, semi-firm cow's milk cheese with a beige interior and a thick brownish-grey rind. Tomme de Savoie dates back to ancient history. Tomme de Savoie, like most Tommes, is usually made from the skim milk left over after the cream is used to make butter or richer cheeses. As a result, the cheese has a relatively low fat content (between 20 and 45%). The cheese is made year-round, and typically has a slightly different character depending on whether the cows are fed on winter hay or summer grass. The cheese normally comes in discs approximately across, in thickness, and weighing between . It is first pressed, and then matured for several months in a traditional cellar, producing the characteristically thick rind and flavor.

When the Galois group is also cyclic, the extension is also called a cyclic extension. Going in the other direction, a Galois extension is called solvable if its Galois group is solvable, i.e., if the group can be decomposed into a series of normal extensions of an abelian group. Every finite extension of a finite field is a cyclic extension. Class field theory provides detailed information about the abelian extensions of number fields, function fields of algebraic curves over finite fields, and local fields. There are two slightly different definitions of the term cyclotomic extension. It can mean either an extension formed by adjoining roots of unity to a field, or a subextension of such an extension. The cyclotomic fields are examples. A cyclotomic extension, under either definition, is always abelian. If a field K contains a primitive n-th root of unity and the n-th root of an element of K is adjoined, the resulting Kummer extension is an abelian extension (if K has characteristic p we should say that p doesn't divide n, since otherwise this can fail even to be a separable extension). In general, however, the Galois groups of n-th roots of elements operate both on the n-th roots and on the roots of unity, giving a non-abelian Galois group as semi-direct product. The Kummer theory gives a complete description of the abelian extension case, and the Kronecker‚ÄìWeber theorem tells us that if K is the field of rational numbers, an extension is abelian if and only if it is a subfield of a field obtained by adjoining a root of unity. There is an important analogy with the fundamental group in topology, which classifies all covering spaces of a space: abelian covers are classified by its abelianisation which relates directly to the first homology group.

He was leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP) from 2003 to 2011 and previously sat on Toronto City Council, occasionally holding the title of acting mayor or deputy mayor of Toronto during his tenure as city councillor. He was the member of Parliament (MP) for Toronto‚ÄîDanforth from 2004 until his death. The son of a Progressive Conservative cabinet minister, Layton was raised in Hudson, Quebec. He rose to prominence in Toronto municipal politics, where he was one of the most prominent left-wing voices on the city and Metropolitan Toronto councils, championing many progressive causes. In 1991, he ran for mayor, losing to June Rowlands. Returning to council, he rose to become head of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. In 2003, he was elected leader of the NDP on the first ballot of the convention. Under his leadership, support for the NDP increased in each election. The party's popular vote almost doubled in the 2004 election, which gave the NDP the balance of power in Paul Martin's minority government. In May 2005 the NDP supported the Liberal budget in exchange for major amendments, in what was promoted as Canada's \\"First NDP budget\\". In November of that year, Layton voted with other opposition parties to defeat the Liberal government over the findings of the Gomery Commission. The NDP saw further gains in the 2006 and 2008 elections, in which the party elected 29 and 37 MPs, respectively. In the 2011 election Layton led the NDP to the most successful result in the party's history, winning 103 seats‚Äîenough to form Canada's Official Opposition. Federal support for Layton and the NDP in the election was unprecedented, especially in the province of Quebec, where the party won 59 out of 75 seats. Layton died on August 22, 2011, after being diagnosed with cancer. He was survived by his wife of 23 years, fellow Toronto MP Olivia Chow. Details of the type and spread of the cancer, and the exact cause of death, were not released to the public. Shortly before he died, Layton had nominated Nycole Turmel as interim leader of the NDP and, consequently, of the Official Opposition. Tom Mulcair won the NDP leadership contest to replace Layton. Early life and education Layton was born in Montreal and raised in nearby Hudson, Quebec, a largely Anglophone community.Wallace, James. \\"Man of the people: Jack Layton is a pragmatist waiting to be given a chance.\\" Sudbury Star. January 9, 2006, p. A8. His parents were Doris Elizabeth (n√©e Steeves), a grand-niece of William Steeves, a Father of Confederation, and Progressive Conservative MP Robert Layton. He was the grandson of Gilbert Layton, who served as a minister without portfolio the government of Quebec's Union Nationale Premier Maurice Duplessis. He was elected student council president of his high school, Hudson High School, and his yearbook predicted that he would become a politician;Taber, Jane. \\"Outside House, Layton learns pecking order.\\" The Globe and Mail. February 1, 2003, p. A5. he would later also credit Billy Bryans, who went on to become a prominent musician with the band The Parachute Club, for having played a role in his student council victory. He graduated from McGill University in 1970 with an honours Bachelor of Arts in political science and became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. In 1969‚Äì70, he was the prime minister of the Quebec Youth Parliament. Layton credited a professor at McGill, the political philosopher Charles Taylor, with being the primary influence in his decision to switch from a science degree to an arts degree. Moreover, it was on Taylor's advice that he pursued his doctorate at University of Toronto to study under political philosopher C. B. Macpherson. In what is perhaps Layton's most complete articulation of his political philosophy, a foreword he wrote for Canadian Idealism and the Philosophy of Freedom, he explains that, \\"The idealist current holds that human society has the potential to achieve liberty when people work together to form a society in which equality means more than negative liberty, the absolute and protected right to run races against each other to determine winners. Idealists imagine a positive liberty that enables us to build together toward common objectives that fulfill and even surpass our individual goals.\\"Meynell, Robert. Canadian Idealism and the Philosophy of Freedom. Montreal-Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2011, xi ‚Äì xii. Upon reading Canadian Idealism and the Philosophy of Freedom, Layton came to understand himself as part of the intellectual tradition of Canadian Idealists. In 1970, the family moved to Toronto, where Layton graduated the following year from York University with a Master of Arts in political science; and later in 1983, he completed his Doctor of Philosophy in political science at York.O'Neil, Peter (January 24, 2003). \\"Can Layton succeed?\\", Sudbury Star, p. A9. In 1974, Layton became a professor at Ryerson Polytechincal Institute (now Ryerson University).\\"Grading the candidates What are the educational qualifications of the candidates for mayor of Toronto?\\" Toronto Star September 29, 1991, p. A3. Over the next decade, he taught at Ryerson, York, and University of Toronto. He also became a prominent activist for a variety of causes. He wrote several books, including Homelessness: The Making and Unmaking of a Crisis and a book on general public policy, Speaking Out. Family and personal life Jack Layton and Olivia Chow on their way to vote, May 2, 2011 Layton's great-granduncle, William Steeves, was a Father of Confederation. His great-grandfather Philip E. Layton was a blind activist who founded the Montreal Association for the Blind in 1908 and led a campaign for disability pensions in the 1930s. Philip was the senior partner in the family business, Layton Bros. Pianos. Layton Pianos had been made in London, England since 1837, and Philip had emigrated to Montreal at the age of 19. Philip was a blind organist, composer (\\"Dominion March\\", played on carillon at Jack's lying-in-state), piano tuner, and piano retailer. The family business survives as Layton Audio in Montreal. Jack Layton's grandfather, Gilbert Layton, was a cabinet minister in the Union Nationale government of Maurice Duplessis in Quebec, and resigned due to the provincial government's lack of support for Canadian participation in World War II. His father, Robert Layton, was a Liberal Party activist in the 1960s and 1970s, and served as a Progressive Conservative member of Parliament and Cabinet minister in the 1980s under Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Layton was raised as a member of the United Church of Canada, and was a member of the Bloor Street United Church parish in Toronto.\\"Jack Layton inspired by United Church spirituality and ethics\\". The Vancouver Sun, August 25, 2011. However, he also sometimes attended services at the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto, whose pastor, Brent Hawkes, was a longtime NDP activist and a personal friend of Layton's. Layton wearing a custom-made uniform at a Star Trek convention in 1991 In 1969, at age 19, Jack married his high school sweetheart Sally Halford, with whom he had two children: Mike, currently a Toronto City Councillor, and Sarah, currently a senior staffer for the Stephen Lewis Foundation.Geddes, John. \\"Jack Layton.\\" Maclean's. December 5, 2005. Layton and Halford's marriage ended in divorce in 1983 after 14 years. Layton first met Olivia Chow in 1985 during an auction at Village by the Grange, in which Jack was the auctioneer and Olivia was the interpreter for the Cantonese language observers. They had been previously acquainted, however they realized that they were both candidates in the upcoming election and decided to have lunch together to talk about the campaign. Three weeks after the auction, they went on their first date. Olivia's mother did not approve of Jack at first, because of his race as well as him not being a lawyer or doctor. Jack was invited to dinner at the home of Olivia's mother, where they also played mahjong. After the dinner, Jack attempted to thank Olivia's mother in Cantonese, however Jack's incorrect tone had him inadvertently saying, \\"Thank you for the good sex.\\" Layton stated \\"My faux pas broke the ice completely. We've been good buddies ever since.\\" Layton was known for playing music and singing songs at party gatherings. Alberta NDP leader Brian Mason remembered during the three-day board meetings when Layton was running for president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities: \\"He would gather people together in his hotel room and play the guitar and get everybody singing old folk songs from the 1960s. He just got people involved, just with his personality, not politics.\\" Layton was a keen Trekkie, having a custom Starfleet uniform made by a tailor. Layton was famously photographed wearing his uniform at a Star Trek convention in 1991. At the 2005 Parliamentary Press Gallery Dinner (typically a satirical event), Layton sent up himself and his party, playing guitar and singing three songs: \\"Party for Sale or Rent\\" (to the tune of \\"King of the Road\\"), a re-worked version of \\"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out\\" with different humorous lyrics, and \\"If I Had Another $4.6 Billion\\". Toronto City Council At York and Ryerson, Layton developed close links with a number of Toronto figures including John Sewell and David Crombie. He was first elected to Toronto City Council in 1982, in a surprise upset against incumbent Gordon Chong. He quickly became one of the most outspoken members of council, and a leader of the left wing.Hayes, David R. \\"A new star rising over left field.\\" The Globe and Mail. January 8, 1983, p. F3. He was one of the most vocal opponents of the massive SkyDome project,MacLeod, Robert. \\"Layton urges SkyDome inquiry.\\" The Globe and Mail. September 12, 1991, p. A11. and an early advocate for rights for AIDS patients.Monsebraaten, Laurie. \\"Alderman proposes $2.1 million AIDS team.\\" Toronto Star. May 6, 1987, p. A6. In 1984, he was fined for trespassing when he handed out leaflets at the Toronto Eaton Centre during a strike by Eaton's staff, but the charge was later thrown out on freedom of speech grounds.Spears, Tom. \\"Alderman wins appeal for handing out leaflets at Eaton's during strike.\\" Toronto Star. May 27, 1986, p. A18. Layton was also one of the few opponents to Toronto's bid for the 1996 Summer Olympics.James, Royson. \\"Failure pinned on Jack Layton, poverty group.\\" Toronto Star. September 19, 1990, p. A3. In 1985, he moved to the Metropolitan Toronto Council, in the first direct elections for members of that body.Smith, Michael. \\"Toronto Aldermen gearing up for first direct Metro election.\\" Toronto Star. July 16, 1985, p. A6.\\"Layton proved right.\\" The Globe and Mail. November 13, 1985, p. A17. In the 1988 municipal elections, Layton traded places with city council ally Dale Martin, with Martin going to Metro and Layton returning to Toronto City Council. Layton was easily elected in a contest with former high school teacher Lois MacMillan-Walker. The election was a major victory for Layton as the reformist coalition of which he was the de facto head gained control of city council, the first time in city history a coalition of New Democrats and independents controlled council.Monsebraaten, Laurie. \\"Reformers on council seek Toronto's 'rebirth.'\\" Toronto Star. November 19, 1988, p. D1. On July 9, 1988, he married Hong Kong-born Toronto District School Board trustee Olivia Chow in a ceremony on Algonquin Island.Spears, Tom. \\"Busy trustee keeps to a hectic schedule.\\" Toronto Star. July 10, 1988, p. A10. Their whitewater rafting honeymoon plans had to be abandoned, however, when days before the wedding Layton collided with a newspaper box while bicycling.\\"Layton Sues for Bike Mishap that 'Ruined' his Honeymoon\\". Toronto Star. July 5, 1988, p. A7. Chow later joined Layton on the Toronto City Council. She has been a candidate for the federal New Democrats five times, first winning her seat the third time in a close race against Tony Ianno in the 2006 Canadian election, and re-elected in 2008 and 2011. Chow resigned from federal politics in 2014 to run for mayor of Toronto; she placed third. Layton and Chow were also the subject of some dispute when a June 14, 1990, Toronto Star article by Tom Kerr accused them of unfairly living in a housing cooperative subsidized by the federal government, despite their high income.Kerr, Tom. \\"Well-to-do Layton lives in 'affordable co-op'\\". Toronto Star. June 14, 1990, p. A1. Layton and Chow had both lived in the Hazelburn co-op since 1985, and lived together in an $800 per month three-bedroom apartment after their marriage in 1988. By 1990, their combined annual income was $120,000, and in March of that year they began voluntarily paying an additional $325 per month to offset their share of the co-op's Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation subsidy, the only members of the co-op to do so. In response to the article, the co-op's board argued that having mixed-income tenants was crucial to the success of co-ops, and that the laws deliberately set aside apartments for those willing to pay market rates, such as Layton and Chow.Kerr, Tom. \\"Co-op residents answer critics\\". Toronto Star. July 19, 1990, p. A21. During the late 1980s and early 1990s they maintained approximately 30% of their units as low income units and provided the rest at what they considered market rent. In June 1990, the city's solicitor cleared the couple of any wrongdoing,Polanyi, Margaret. \\"Layton cleared of wrongdoing Police say councillor committed no impropriety by living in co-op.\\" The Globe and Mail. August 17, 1990, p. A8. and later that month, Layton and Chow left the co-op and bought a house in Toronto's Chinatown together with Chow's mother, a move they said had been planned for some time.Duffy, Andrew. \\"Layton says he's moving from co-op.\\" Toronto Star. June 24, 1990, p. A3. Former Toronto mayor John Sewell later wrote in NOW that rival Toronto city councillor Tom Jakobek had given the story to Tom Kerr.Wolfe, Morris. \\"Sensational tabloids are enticing a suspicious public.\\" The Globe and Mail. February 4, 1992, p. D1. Originally known for coming to council meetings in blue jeans with unkempt hair, Layton worked to change his image to run for mayor in the 1991 civic election. He also started wearing contact lenses, abandoning his glasses, and traded in his blue jeans for suits.Byers, Jim. \\"Jack Layton's trim new look triggers rumor mill at city hall.\\" Toronto Star. February 5, 1987, p. A6. In February 1991, Layton became the first official NDP candidate for the mayoralty, pitting him against centrist incumbent Art Eggleton.Lewis, David Stein. \\"Councillor Jack Layton's campaign to become mayor of Toronto is ...\\" Toronto Star. February 6, 1991, p. A25. In a move that surprised many, Eggleton elected not to run again.Kerr, Tom. \\"Eggleton out of race for mayor.\\" Toronto Star. May 2, 1991, p. A1. Layton was opposed by three right-of-centre candidates: Susan Fish, June Rowlands, and Betty Disero. Right-wing support soon coalesced around former city councillor Rowlands, preventing the internal divisions Layton needed to win office.Byers, Jim. \\"Rowlands leads by 2‚Äì1 margin But 55% want more choice for mayor, Star poll shows\\" Toronto Star November 9, 1991, p. A1. Layton was also hurt by the growing unpopularity of the provincial NDP government of Bob Rae,MacLeod, Robert. \\"Rae's misfortunes called drag on Layton Toronto mayoral candidate running under NDP banner.\\" The Globe and Mail. June 15, 1991, p. A7. and by his earlier opposition to Toronto's Olympic bid. Bid organizer Paul Henderson accused Layton and his allies of costing Toronto the event.Byers, Jim. \\"Guide to the real winners, losers Apparent victories are defeats in topsy-turvy world of politics.\\" Toronto Star. November 15, 1991, p. A12. Despite this, October polls showed Layton only four points behind Rowlands, with 36% support.Byers, Jim. \\"Rowlands just ahead of Layton, Star poll finds.\\" Toronto Star. October 10, 1991, p. A1. However, on October 17, Fish, a former provincial Progressive Conservative cabinet minister who had only 19% support, pulled out of the race, and many of her supporters moved to Rowlands. Layton lost the November 12 election by a considerable margin.Byers, Jim. \\"Layton beaten by Rowlands in all but one of 16 wards.\\" Toronto Star. November 21, 1991, p. A7. However, in the same election Olivia Chow easily won a seat on city council. In November 1991, Layton co-founded the White Ribbon Campaign of men working to end male violence against women.Caplan, Gerald. \\"Violence against women: an international epidemic.\\" The Globe and Mail. July 30, 2010 Layton returned to academia and also founded the Green Catalyst Group Inc., an environmental consulting business.Lakey, Jack. \\"The mellowing of Jack Layton.\\" Toronto Star. January 4, 1999, p. 1. In 1993, he ran for the House of Commons of Canada in the riding of Rosedale for the NDP, but finished fourth in the generally Liberal riding. In 1994, he returned to Metropolitan Toronto Council, succeeding Roger Hollander in the Don River ward, and he resumed his high- profile role in local politics; following the \\"megacity\\" merger of Metropolitan Toronto into the current city of Toronto, he was again re-elected to Toronto City Council, serving alongside Pam McConnell in a two-member ward. He remained on Toronto City Council until pursuing the leadership of the federal New Democrats. He also came to national attention as the leader of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities.\\"Layton launches bid to lead NDP: Outspoken T.O. city councillor.\\" The Province. July 23, 2002, p. A22. Federally, he ran again in the 1997 election, this time in the neighbouring riding of Toronto‚ÄîDanforth, but lost to incumbent Dennis Mills by a wide margin. In June 1999, as chair of Toronto's environmental task force, the Toronto Atmospheric Fund, he was instrumental in the preliminary phases of the WindShare wind power cooperative in Toronto through the Toronto Renewable Energy Co-operative. Leader of the NDP Layton was elected leader of the NDP at the party's leadership convention in Toronto, on January 25, 2003. Layton won on the first ballot with 53.5% of the vote, defeating Bill Blaikie, Lorne Nystrom, Joe Comartin and Pierre Ducasse.Haight, Lana. \\"Layton surprises locals: Supporters 'blown away' by win over Blaikie, Nystrom; Lana Haight.\\" Star ‚Äì Phoenix. January 27, 2003, p. A1. His campaign was focused on the need to reinvigorate the party, and was prominently endorsed by former NDP leader Ed Broadbent.\\"Broadbent backs Toronto city councillor as NDP chief\\". Times ‚Äì Colonist. November 28, 2002, p. A7. Layton did not seek election to the House of Commons by running in a by-election, as is the tradition among new party leaders without a seat. Instead, he waited until the 2004 federal election to contest the riding of Toronto‚ÄîDanforth against Liberal Dennis Mills. With no seat in the House of Commons, he appointed the runner-up, longtime Winnipeg- area MP Bill Blaikie, as parliamentary leader.Paraskevas, Joe. \\"NDP leader goes after Grits on Day One\\". Sudbury Star. January 28, 2003, p. A8. Although he had no parliamentary seat, Layton was noted for drawing considerable attention from the Canadian mass media.Goar, Carol. \\"He makes it look too effortless\\". Toronto Star. November 5, 2003, p. A26.Curry, Bill. \\"NDP's Layton accused of hogging the microphones.\\" National Post. February 25, 2003, p. A11. Much of his rhetoric involved attacking the policies of then Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin as conservative, and arguing the ideology of the Liberal Party of Canada had shifted in a more right wing direction. Another focus of Layton's leadership was to focus the party's efforts on Quebec, one of the party's weaker provinces.Chung, Andrew. \\"Quebec a difficult hill for NDP to climb\\". Toronto Star. April 26, 2003, p. E02. One of his opponents in the leadership race, Pierre Ducasse, was the first Qu√©b√©cois to run for leader of the NDP. After the race, Layton appointed Ducasse as his Quebec lieutenant and party spokesperson.Curry, Bill. \\"NDP counting on Ducasse: Popular Quebecer to run in Manicouagan\\". The Gazette. January 5, 2004, p. A10. The result of Layton's efforts was a strong increase in the party's support. By the end of 2003, the party was polling higher than both the Canadian Alliance or the Progressive ConservativesLunman, Kim. \\"NDP inching past conservatives, poll indicates.\\" The Globe and Mail. December 5, 2003, p. A4. and it was even suggested that the next election could see the NDP in place as Official Opposition.Canton, Maria. \\"NDP official opposition possible, predicts prof\\". Calgary Herald. November 16, 2003, p. A8. =2004 election= During the 2004 Canadian federal election, controversy erupted over Layton's accusation that Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin was responsible for the deaths of homeless people because he failed to provide funding for affordable housing.Aubry, Jack. \\"Layton's line starts a storm.\\" Times ‚Äì Colonist. May 28, 2004, p. A4. While rates of homelessness and homeless deaths increased during the eleven years of Liberal government, the link to Martin's decisions was indirect as affordable housing is a mainly provincial jurisdiction.Murphy, Barbara. On the street: how we created the homeless. Winnipeg: J. Gordon Shillingford, c2000. Layton's charge was defended by some, including the Ottawa Citizen,Coyne, Andrew. \\"Layton's charge is out of order.\\" National Post. May 29, 2004, p. A22. but most attacked it as inaccurate and negative campaigning. Moreover, the controversy consumed the campaign, overshadowing policy announcements over the next week.Curry, Bill. \\"Layton drops from radar during Week 2.\\" Star ‚Äì Phoenix. June 5, 2004, p. A13. Further controversy followed as Layton suggested the removal of the Clarity Act, considered by some to be vital to keeping Quebec in Canada and by others as undemocratic, and promised to recognize any declaration of independence by Quebec after a referendum.Chase, Steven. \\"Layton would axe Clarity Act\\" The Globe and Mail. May 29, 2004, p. A1. This position was not part of the NDP's official party policy, leading some high-profile party members, such as NDP House leader Bill Blaikie and former NDP leader Alexa McDonough, to publicly indicate that they did not share Layton's views. His position on the Clarity Act was reversed in the 2006 election to one of support.Layton reverses course on Clarity Act Rabble.ca. December 7, 2005. Layton also continued his effort to improve his party's standing in Quebec. The NDP ran French-language ads in the province and Layton, who spoke colloquial Qu√©b√©cois French, appeared in them. He advocated replacing the first-past-the-post system with proportional representation. He threatened to use the NDP's clout in the event of a minority government. However, it was dismissed out of hand by the Liberal and Bloc Qu√©b√©cois leaders, as they tend to be favored by the first-past-the-post system, normally being allocated a greater proportion of seats than the proportion of votes cast for them. Historically, the NDP's popular vote does not translate into a proportional number of seats because of scattered support. This was most opposed by the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois, who usually had the lowest popular vote but nonetheless won many seats because their support was concentrated in Quebec. Despite these problems, Layton led the NDP to a 15% popular vote, its highest in 16 years. However, it only won 19 seats in the House of Commons, two less than the 21 won under Alexa McDonough in 1997, and far short of the 40 that Layton predicted on the eve of the election. However, some potential NDP voters may have voted Liberal to prevent a possible Conservative win. Olivia Chow and several other prominent Toronto NDP candidates lost tight races and Layton won his own seat against incumbent Liberal Dennis Mills by a much narrower margin than early polls indicated. =Liberal minority government= Jack Layton speaks at an NDP Rally in Courtenay, British Columbia the night of January 12, 2005 With the ruling Liberal Party being reduced to a minority government, revelations of the sponsorship scandal damaging its popularity to the point where both the Conservative Party and the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois were pressing their advantage for a snap election, the prime minister approached the NDP for its support. Layton demanded the cancellation of proposed corporate tax cuts and called for an increase in social spending. The ensuing compromise in the NDP's favour was protested by the other opposition parties who used it as a pretext to force a non-confidence vote. On May 19, two such votes were defeated and Layton's amendments went on to be passed on its final reading vote on June 23. As a result of this political coup and his apparent civil behaviour in a spitefully raucous parliament, many political analysts noted that Layton gained increased credibility as an effective leader of an important party, becoming the major second choice leader in many political polls ‚Äì for example, polling second in Quebec after Gilles Duceppe, despite the low polls for his party as a whole in the province. In mid-November 2005, when Liberal support dropped after the Gomery Commission delivered its first report, Layton offered the prime minister several conditions in return for the NDP's continued support, most notably on the issue of privatization of health care in Canada, where Layton wanted strict provisions for controlling public spending on private health care delivery, saying that without \\"significant action\\" on the issue, \\"Mr. Martin can't count on our support.\\" Martin for his part offered no comment on a meeting held to discuss the issue, only saying that it was a \\"good meeting\\", while Layton publicly expressed his disappointment at the outcome. Layton announced he would introduce a motion requesting a February election. However, the Martin government refused to allow the election date to be decided by the opposition. A motion of non-confidence followed, moved by Stephen Harper and seconded by Layton, triggering the 2006 federal election. Layton was working with the Liberal government, but determined he would have a better chance of electoral success by voting against the government and having an election. Coalition attempt with the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois and the Conservatives On March 26, 2011, in response to Harper's allegations that a coalition is not a legitimate or principled way to form government, Duceppe stated that Harper had once tried to form a coalition government with the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois and NDP. In 2004 Stephen Harper privately met with Bloc Qu√©b√©cois leader Gilles Duceppe and New Democratic Party Leader Jack Layton in a Montreal hotel. The meeting that took place between the three party leaders happened 2 months before the federal election. On September 9, 2004, the three signed a letter addressed to then-Governor General Adrienne Clarkson, stating, On the same day the letter was written, the three party leaders held a joint press conference at which they expressed their intent to co-operate on changing parliamentary rules, and to request that the governor general consult with them before deciding to call an election. At the news conference, Harper said \\"It is the Parliament that's supposed to run the country, not just the largest party and the single leader of that party. That's a criticism I've had and that we've had and that most Canadians have had for a long, long time now so this is an opportunity to start to change that.\\" However, at the time, Harper and the two other opposition leaders denied trying to form a coalition government. Harper said, \\"This is not a coalition, but this is a co-operative effort.\\" One month later, on October 4, Mike Duffy, now a Conservative senator (appointed by Harper), said \\"It is possible that you could change prime minister without having an election\\", and that some Conservatives wanted Harper as prime minister. The next day Layton walked out on talks with Harper and Duceppe, accusing them of trying to replace Paul Martin with Harper as prime minister. Both Bloc and Conservative officials denied Layton's accusations. =2006 campaign= In a media scrum during the 2006 winter election campaign With a vote scheduled for January 23, 2006, many New Democrats expected Layton to deliver substantially more seats than he did in 2004. They hoped the NDP would hold the balance of power in a new minority parliament, so that they could carry additional leverage in negotiating with the governing party. Mike Klander, the executive vice-president of the federal Liberals' Ontario wing, resigned after making posts on his blog comparing Chow to a Chow Chow dog and calling her husband an \\"asshole\\".Liberal exec quits over his blog remarks about NDPers CBC.ca. December 27, 2005. Through the course of the campaign, Layton attempted to cast himself as the sole remaining champion of universal health care. Some opinion polls showed that Canadians found Layton the most appealing and charismatic of the leaders. Layton repeatedly insisted that \\"Canadians have a third choice\\", and urged Liberals to \\"lend us your vote\\". Some commentators and pundits mocked Layton for over-using these catchphrases instead of explaining the NDP platform. The NDP's strategy had changed in that they were focusing their attacks on the Liberals rather than in 2004, where they criticized both the Liberals and Conservatives in equal measure, prompting some criticism from Paul Martin.Martin attacks Layton for not attacking Harper January 17, 2006. Andrew Coyne suggested that the NDP not only wanted to disassociate themselves from the scandal-ridden Liberals, but also because the Liberals were likely to receive credit for legislation achieved under the Liberal-NDP partnership. The NDP had also lost close races in the 2004 election due to the Liberals' strategic voting. Early in the campaign, NDP MP Judy Wasylycia-Leis had asked the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to launch a criminal investigation into the leaking of the income trust announcement.Income trust a major campaign turning point CTV News. January 22, 2006. The criminal probe seriously damaged the Liberal campaign and preventing them from making their key policy announcements, as well as bringing alleged Liberal corruption back into the spotlight. Layton's campaign direction also caused a break between him and Canadian Auto Workers union head Buzz Hargrove over the issue of strategic voting. Hargrove preferred a Liberal minority government supported by the NDP and he had earlier criticized Layton for participating in the motion of non-confidence that brought down the Liberal government. Hargrove allied with the Liberals and publicly stated that he \\"did not like the campaign that Jack Layton was running\\", criticizing Layton for \\"spending too much time attacking the Liberals\\". During the final week of the campaign, knowing that last-minute strategic voting had cost the NDP seats in several close ridings during the 2004 election, Hargrove and Martin urged all progressive voters to unite behind the Liberal banner to stop a Conservative government. Layton intensified his attacks on the Liberal scandals, pledging to use his minority clout to keep the Conservatives in check. Shortly after the election, the Ontario provincial branch of the NDP revoked Hargrove's party membership because he had violated the party's constitution by campaigning for other parties during an election campaign, though Layton disagreed with this. Hargrove retaliated by severing ties with the NDP at the annual CAW convention. The election increased the NDP's total seats to 29 seats, up from 18 before dissolution. Among the new NDP candidates elected was Olivia Chow, making the two only the second husband-and-wife team in Canadian Parliament history (Gurmant Grewal and Nina Grewal were the first husband-and-wife team in Canadian Parliament after the 2004 federal election). In the end, the NDP succeeded in increasing their parliamentary representation to 29 MPs, though they had significantly fewer seats than the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois (51) or the Opposition Liberals (103). =Conservative minority government= Jack Layton giving a speech on the 5th anniversary of his leadership of the NDP At the NDP's 22nd Convention, held on September 10, 2006, in Quebec City, Layton received a 92% approval rating in a leadership vote, tying former Reform Party Leader Preston Manning's record for this kind of voting.Panetta, Alexander. \\"Layton gets strong backing\\". London Free Press. September 11, 2006. This record was broken in 2016 by Elizabeth May of the Green Party of Canada. At the same convention, the NDP passed a motion calling for the return of Canadian Forces from Afghanistan. On September 24, 2006, he met with Afghan President Hamid Karzai to discuss the NDP position. After the meeting Layton stated that Canada's role should be focused on traditional peacekeeping and reconstruction rather than in a front line combat role currently taking place.

Layton denied he was trying to draw comparisons with Obama, saying \\"I mean, I am a lot shorter than he is. He is a brilliant orator. I'm never going to claim to be that. But what I have noticed is that the key issues faced by the American middle class, the working people of the U.S. and their concerns about their families' futures, are awfully similar to the issues that I hear in Canada.\\" Layton said that he has also written to Obama and Hillary Clinton saying that the North American Free Trade Agreement had hurt working people in both countries \\"and those stories have to be told.\\" Layton, along with Prime Minister Harper and Bloc Qu√©b√©cois leader Gilles Duceppe, initially opposed the inclusion of Green Party leader Elizabeth May in the leaders' televised debates. Layton initially said that he was following the rules of the broadcast consortium, while NDP spokesman Brad Lavigne confirmed that Layton had refused to attend if May was present, noting that May had endorsed Liberal leader St√©phane Dion for prime minister, and arguing that her inclusion would in effect give the Liberals two representatives at the debate. Rod Love, former chief of staff to Ralph Klein, suggested that the Greens could potentially cut into the NDP's support. Layton's stance drew criticism from the YWCA,\\"\\"Who's Afraid of Elizabeth May?\\" YWCA Canada calls for a woman's voice in election debate\\", YWCA press release, September 9, 2008. Judy Rebick, and members of his own party. Layton dropped his opposition to May's inclusion on September 10, 2008. \\"This whole issue of debating about the debate has become a distraction to the real debate that needs to happen\\", Layton said. \\"I have only one condition for this debate and that is that the prime minister is there.\\" In October 2008, Layton posted an online video message speaking out in favour of net neutrality, torrent sites, video-sharing sites, and social-networking sites. In a separate interview he said that increasing corporate control \\"is very, very dangerous and we have put the whole issue of net neutrality right into the heart of our campaign platform\\", and that the Internet is \\"a public tool for exchanging ideas and I particularly want to say that if we don‚Äôt fight to preserve it, we could lose it.\\" In the end, the NDP gained 8 new seats, taking its tally to 37. This result still left the NDP as Canada's fourth party, behind the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois with 50. The NDP managed to retain Outremont, held by Tom Mulcair, its only seat in the province. =Continued Conservative minority government= Layton during the 2008 election campaign The 40th session of Parliament began on November 27, 2008, with a fiscal update by the Conservatives that outlined their agenda for the upcoming term. This included a temporary suspension of federal employees' right to strike and a removal of monetary subsidies for political parties.Opposition threatens to topple Tories over update Richard Brennan. Toronto Star. November 27, 2008. All three opposition parties including the NDP stated that they could not support this position. Layton along with Liberal leader St√©phane Dion and Bloc Qu√©b√©cois leader Gilles Duceppe began negotiations to form a coalition that would replace the Conservatives as the government. The three opposition parties planned to table a motion of non-confidence in the House of Commons, and counted on the likelihood that the governor general, Micha√´lle Jean, would invite the coalition to govern instead of dissolving parliament and calling an election so soon after the last election. On December 1, 2008, the three opposition leaders signed an accord that laid down the basis for an agreement on a coalition government. The proposed structure would be a coalition between the Liberals and the NDP, with the New Democrats getting six Cabinet positions. Both parties agreed to continue the coalition until June 30, 2011. The Bloc Qu√©b√©cois would not be formally part of the government but would provide support on confidence motions for 18 months.Liberals, NDP, Bloc sign deal on proposed coalition CBC News. December 1, 2008. Opposition to the proposed coalition developed in all provinces except Quebec. On December 4, 2008, the governor general granted Prime Minister Harper's request to prorogue parliament until January 26, 2009, at which time Harper had planned to introduce the budget. Dion had since been ousted from the leadership of the Liberals and his successor, Michael Ignatieff, had distanced himself from the coalition. Layton remained committed to ousting the Harper government,https://etacanadaonline.com/ pledging that the NDP would vote against the Conservative budget regardless of what it contained. Layton urged Ignatieff's Liberal Party to topple the Conservatives before the shelf life of the coalition expired; constitutional experts said that four months after the last election, if the government fell, the governor general would likely grant the prime minister's request to dissolve parliament instead of inviting the coalition Layton making an appearance in Toronto's Pride Parade in 2009 On January 28, 2009, the Liberals agreed to support the Conservative budget with an amendment, ending the possibility of the coalition, so Layton said \\"Today we have learned that you can't trust Mr. Ignatieff to oppose Mr. Harper. If you oppose Mr. Harper and you want a new government, I urge you to support the NDP.\\" In March 2009, the NDP, under Layton's leadership, re-introduced a motion (first passed June 3, 2008) which, if implemented, would allow conscientious objectors to the Iraq War to remain in Canada. The motion again passed March 30, 2009, by 129‚Äì125, but it was non-binding. In a leadership review vote held at the NDP's August 2009 federal policy convention, 89.25% of delegates voted against holding a leadership convention to replace Layton. In October 2009, Layton paired up with the Stephen Lewis Foundation to raise money for HIV/AIDS affected families in Africa. As part of the foundation's A Dare to Remember campaign, Layton busked on a busy street corner.

Toronto Sun, April 13, 2011. On February 4, 2011, Layton attended a rally against Usage Based Billing in Toronto with MPs Dan McTeague, Olivia Chow, Peggy Nash and others. His attendance at this rally was accompanied by several press releases by the NDP denouncing metered internet usage in Canada. The NDP surge began in Quebec, with the NDP surprising many observers by surpassing the previously front-running Bloc in Quebec. In Canada overall, the NDP surged past the Liberals to take the second place behind the Conservatives; in Quebec, the NDP took first place. The NDP surge became the dominant narrative of the last week of the campaign, as other parties turned their attacks on the party and Layton. Layton in Quebec during the federal electoral campaign On April 29, 2011, a retired police officer told the Sun News Network and the Toronto Sun newspaper that in 1996, Layton had been found in a massage parlour when police, looking for underage Asian sex workers, raided the establishment. The police informed Layton of the potentially questionable use of the business and recommended that he avoid it in the future. No charges were filed. The Sun later ran a follow-up piece, in which Toronto city councillor Giorgio Mammoliti criticized Layton. Layton has said there was no wrongdoing in the matter, saying that he simply \\"went for a massage at a community clinic\\" and did not return after the police advised him not to. He also referred to the release of the police report as a smear campaign against him. Bloc Qu√©b√©cois leader Gilles Duceppe also dismissed the claim. A columnist for the National Post suggested that it was a Liberal insider that leaked the story, although a Liberal Party spokesman denied that they had anything to do with it. A subsequent Toronto Star column stated that most contributors to online discussions agreed there was a smear campaign against Layton. As for political damage from this story, that same day's update of the Nanos Leadership Index, which assesses public opinion on the Canadian federal leaders' trustworthiness, competence and vision for Canada, Layton rose from 80% to 97%, surpassing Harper at 88% and Ignatieff at 39%. The polling company speculated this improvement is due to strong sympathy by the public for a political candidate they judged as being unfairly maligned. The Toronto police launched an investigation into how official police notes were leaked to Sun Media. Police notebooks are closely guarded and may contain unfounded and unproven allegations. On May 5, 2011, it was announced that no charges would be laid with regards to the leaked information. Layton appeared on the Radio- Canada talk show Tout le monde en parle on April 3, an appearance that was credited for improving his party's standing among Francophone voters due to his informal Qu√©b√©cois French. The show is the most popular program in Quebec. He was also perceived to have performed well in the televised French-language party leaders' debate on April 13. In the May 2, 2011, election, Layton led the NDP to 103 seats, more than double its previous high. This was also enough to make the NDP the Official Opposition in the House of Commons for the first time ever. The NDP gains were partly due to a major surge in Quebec as the party won 59 of the province's 75 seats, dominating Montreal and sweeping Quebec City and the Outaouais, although the NDP also won more seats than any other opposition party in the rest of Canada. The NDP had gone into the election with only one seat in Quebec, that of Thomas Mulcair, and had won but a single seat in the province historically (Phil Edmonston in a 1990 by- election). Many of these gains came at the expense of the Bloc, which was reduced to a four-seat rump without official party status in Parliament. Illness and death An impromptu memorial set up at Nathan Phillips Square shortly after his death On February 5, 2010, Layton announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. He noted that his father Robert Layton had the same type of cancer 17 years before and recovered from it. His wife, Olivia Chow, had thyroid cancer a few years before. He vowed to beat the cancer, and said it would not interrupt his duties as member of Parliament or as leader of the NDP. Following the 2011 federal election, Layton led the party into the first month of the new session of Parliament, as well as attending the NDP Federal Convention in Vancouver. After Parliament rose for the summer, Layton announced on July 25, 2011 that he would be taking a temporary leave from his post to fight an unspecified, newly diagnosed cancer. He was hoping to return as leader of the NDP upon the resumption of the House of Commons on September 19, 2011. Layton recommended that NDP caucus chair Nycole Turmel serve as interim leader during his leave of absence. Layton died on August 22, 2011 at 4:45 am ET at his home in Toronto. He was 61 years old. Layton's coffin is taken from Parliament Hill after lying in state in Ottawa. Upon hearing the news, there was a nationwide outpouring of grief, and Governor General David Johnston, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, NDP deputy leader Libby Davies, and United States Ambassador to Canada David Jacobson issued statements praising Layton and mourning his loss. Layton's family released an open letter, written by Layton two days before his death. In it, he expressed his wishes regarding the NDP's leadership in the event of his death, and addressed various segments of the Canadian population, concluding, \\"My friends, love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic. And we'll change the world.\\" Layton was accorded a state funeral, which took place between August 25 and 27, 2011, with the final memorial service at Roy Thomson Hall in Toronto. Layton was the second leader of the Official Opposition to die while in office; the first, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, had been a former prime minister, and so a state funeral was consistent with protocol. Layton was the first opposition leader to die for whom a state funeral would not otherwise have been afforded, but Prime Minister Harper made the offer to Layton's widow who accepted. Layton was cremated following the funeral. A portion of his ashes was scattered under a jack pine planted on Toronto Island in his honour, with a second portion scattered at the Layton family's plot at Cote St. Charles United Church in Hudson, Quebec. A third portion was scattered under a memorial sculpted by Chow, placed at the Toronto Necropolis Cemetery on the first anniversary of his death. In popular culture Layton's life is portrayed in a 2013 television movie entitled Jack, with Rick Roberts portraying Layton and Sook- Yin Lee as Olivia Chow. The cast also includes Wendy Crewson and Erin Karpluk. It was released on March 10, 2013, and aired on CBC Television.

The Skycar's ducted fans deflect air vertically for takeoff and horizontally for forward flight. The ducted fans encase the propellers and engines, which prevents bystanders from being exposed to moving blades as well as improving aerodynamic efficiency at low speeds and generating lift in forward flight.

The Rotapower Wankel engine announced by Freedom Motors has the claimed ability to operate on any fuel including, but not limited to, gasoline, diesel, methanol, and clean renewable ethanol. Earlier Rotapower models used gasoline. The Rotapower engine is based on a rotary engine developed by Outboard Marine Corporation (OMC) in the 1970s.

He subsequently followed the broadcast announcement with a press release and a radio-broadcast announcement on the Coast to Coast AM radio program with host John B. Wells interviewing Moller for 2 hours. The campaign was formulated to raise money to further develop the systems to fly the Skycar without a tether and with a pilot on-board - something that Moller had yet to accomplish with the flights that had been conducted to date with the M400X prototype vehicle. Moller launched a donation-only crowdfunding campaign - not subject to SEC scrutiny - and promised to provide gifts and other items to donors, included a ride in the M400X as the top gift of the campaign. The Moller crowdfunding campaign ended on January 4, 2014 and raised a total of US$29,429.00 from 188 funders, far short of its $950,000 goal.

Yonhap provides news articles, pictures and other information to newspapers, TV networks and other media in South Korea. Predecessor agencies and establishment Yonhap (, , translit. Yeonhap; meaning \\"united\\" in Korean) was established on 19 December 1980, through the merger of Hapdong News Agency and Orient Press. The Hapdong News Agency itself emerged in late 1945 out of the short-lived Kukje News that had operated for two months out of the office of Domei, the former Japanese news agency that had functioned in Korea during the Japanese colonial era. In 1999 Yonhap took over the Naewoe News Agency. Naewoe was a South Korea government-affiliated organization, created in the mid 1970s, and tasked with publishing information and analysis on North Korea from a South Korean perspective through books and journals. Naewoe was known to have close links with South Korea's intelligence agency, and according to the British academic and historian James Hoare, Naowoe's publications became \\"less partisan after the late 1980s and are often useful source of information on North Korea\\". In 1999 Naewoe merged with Yonhap News Agency, with materials on North Korea continued to be \\"distributed for free as part of the government's propaganda effort\\". According to the U.S. Library of Congress \\"Originally a propaganda vehicle that followed the government line on unification policy issued, Naowae Press became increasingly objective and moderate in tone in the mid-1980s in interpreting political, social, and economic developments in North Korea\\". Naowae's principal publication was the monthly magazine Vantage Point: Developments in North Korea, which continued to be published by Yonhap until its discontinuation in 2016. History Yonhap maintains various agreements with 90 non-Korean news agencies, and also has a services-exchange agreement with North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) agency, signed in 2002. It is the only Korean wire service that works with foreign news agencies,Shrivastava, K. M. (2007). News Agencies from Pigeon to Internet. Elgin, IL: Sterling Publishers. . and provides a limited but freely-available selection of news on its website in Korean, English, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, Arabic, and French. Yonhap was the host news agency of the 1988 Seoul Summer Olympics and was elected twice to the board of the Organization of Asia-Pacific News Agencies (OANA). Yonhap is South Korea's only news agency large enough to have some 60 correspondents abroad and 600 reporters across the nation. Its largest shareholder is the Korea News Agency Commission (KONAC). In 2003, the South Korean government passed a law giving financial and systematic assistance to the agency, to reinforce staff and provide equipment. In the legislation, it was also given the role of ‚Äúpromoting the country's image‚Äù to an international audience. The head of the Yonhap agency is usually affiliated with the government, which critics say harms press freedom and influences news-gathering. However, it is government affiliation, rather than press laws (which are supportive of press freedom), which is said to be the cause of any limitations,Sin, T.; Shin, D.C.; Rutkowski, C.P.; Pak, C.

In 1998, Yonhap acquired from the National Intelligence Service a news wire service monitoring North Korean media and analyzing North-Korea- related information. Yonhap incorporated the firm and its staff into the newsroom, creating a special division (often referred to as the 'N.K. news desk') to improve its reporting on North Korea. In January 2009, two reporters from the N.K. news desk disclosed that Kim Jong-un had been chosen as heir apparent to North Korea's longtime leader, Kim Jong-il. Later, in 2010, the reporters won the grand journalism award for the exclusive story from the Korean Journalist Association. It was the first time in nine years that the association had awarded the prize. The Cho Gye-chang award The Korean Journalist Association in 2010 established the Cho Gye-chang Journalism Award for achievement in international news reporting to commemorate Cho Gye-chang, the former Yonhap correspondent in Shenyang, China. Cho was killed in a car crash in December 2008 on the way back, after having conducted an interview with a Korean-Chinese academic. He was assigned to Shenyang in 2006 as the first South Korean correspondent in the northern Chinese city. Cho was widely admired as an ardent news writer who focused on North Korean affairs and Korean-Chinese communities.

The GSO is resident at the Gothenburg Concert Hall at G√∂taplatsen. The orchestra received the title of the National Orchestra of Sweden () in 1997. Background and history The GSO was founded in 1905, with Heinrich Hammer as its first principal conductor. The composer Wilhelm Stenhammar was the orchestra's second principal conductor, from 1907 to 1922. In addition to Stenhammar conducting his own works, Jean Sibelius and Carl Nielsen made regular guest-conducting appearances with the GSO. The orchestra's fortunes waxed and waned in subsequent years, until the advent of Neeme J√§rvi as principal conductor, from 1982 to 2004. Although the GSO has a broad repertoire, it has a special affinity for the works of the Nordic Late Romantic composers, such as Jean Sibelius and Edvard Grieg. During J√§rvi's tenure as principal conductor, the longest tenure of any principal conductor in the GSO's history, its reputation on the world stage was greatly increased, including sponsorships from Volvo and a recording contract with Deutsche Grammophon. J√§rvi currently holds the title of Principal Conductor Emeritus (Chefdirigent Emeritus) with the GSO. Gustavo Dudamel was principal conductor of the GSO from 2007 to 2012, and now has the title of hedersdirigent (honorary conductor) of the GSO. Past principal guest conductors of the GSO have included Norman del Mar, who was Permanent Guest Conductor from 1968 to 1973, and Christian Zacharias. Kent Nagano became principal guest conductor and artistic advisor of the GSO as of the 2013‚Äì2014 season, with an initial contract of three years. In August 2014, Santtu-Matias Rouvali first guest- conducted the GSO. In May 2016, the GSO announced the appointment of Rouvali as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2017‚Äì2018 season, with an initial contract of four years. In May 2019, the GSO announced the extension of Rouvali's contract through 2025. In addition to Deutsche Grammophon, the orchestra has recorded commercially for such labels as BIS.

A wooden disk attached to the propeller is used to indicate where each round passes through the propeller arc. A synchronization gear (also known as a gun synchronizer or interrupter gear) is a device used by a single-engine tractor configuration aircraft to fire a forward-firing armament through the arc of a spinning propeller without bullets striking the blades. This allowed the aircraft, rather than the gun, to be aimed at the target. There were many practical problems, mostly arising from the inherently imprecise nature of an automatic gun's firing, the great (and varying) velocity of the blades of a spinning propeller, and the very high speed at which any gear synchronizing the two had to operate. In practice, all known gears worked on the principle of actively \\"triggering\\" each shot, in the manner of a semi-automatic weapon. Design and experimentation with gun synchronization had been underway in France and Germany in 1913‚Äì1914, following the ideas of August Euler, who seems to have been the first to suggest mounting a fixed armament firing in the direction of flight (in 1910). However, the first practical‚Äîif far from reliable‚Äîgear to enter operational service was that fitted to the Fokker Eindecker fighters, which entered squadron service with the German Air Service in mid-1915. The success of the Eindecker led to numerous gun synchronization devices, culminating in the reasonably reliable hydraulic British Constantinesco gear of 1917. By the end of the war German engineers were well on the way to perfecting a gear using an electrical rather than a mechanical or hydraulic link between the engine and the gun, with the gun being triggered by a solenoid rather than by a mechanical \\"trigger motor\\". From 1918 to the mid-1930s the standard armament for a fighter aircraft remained two synchronized rifle-calibre machine guns, firing forward through the arc of the propeller. During the late 1930s, however, the main role of the fighter was increasingly seen as the destruction of large, all-metal bombers, for which the \\"traditional\\" light armament was inadequate. Since it was impractical to try to fit more than one or two extra guns in the limited space available in the front of a single-engine aircraft's fuselage, this led to an increasing proportion of the armament being mounted in the wings, firing outside the arc of the propeller. The conclusive redundancy of synchronization gears did not finally come until the introduction of jet propulsion and the absence of a propeller for guns to be synchronized with.  Nomenclature  A mechanism to enable an automatic weapon to fire between the blades of a whirling propeller is usually called an interrupter or synchronizer gear. Both these terms are more or less misleading, at least insofar as explaining what happens when the gear functions.Woodman 1989, pp. 171‚Äì172. The term \\"interrupter\\" implies that the gear pauses, or \\"interrupts\\" the fire of the gun at the point where one of the blades of the propeller passes in front of its muzzle. The difficulty is that even the relatively slowly revolving propellers of First World War aircraft typically turned twice or even three times for each shot a contemporary machine gun could fire. A two-bladed propeller would therefore obstruct the gun six times every firing cycle of the gun, a four-bladed one twelve times. Another way of putting this is that an \\"interrupted\\" gun would have been \\"blocked\\" more than forty times every second,Hegener 1961, p. 26. while it was firing at a rate in the region of seven rounds per second. Unsurprisingly, the designers of so-called interrupter gears found this too problematic to be seriously attempted, as the gaps between \\"interruptions\\" would have been too short to allow the gun to fire at all.Volker 1992, pt. 2, pp. 80‚Äì81. And yet, \\"synchronization\\", in the usual sense of the word, between the rate of fire of a machine gun (firing as such, in a fully automatic manner) and the revolutions per minute of a spinning aircraft propeller is also a conceptual impossibility.Mixter and Edmonds 1919, p. 2. A machine gun normally fires a constant number of rounds a minute, and while this may be boosted by, for instance, strengthening and increasing the tension on a return spring, or redirecting the gasses produced by each firing, it cannot be varied at will while the gun is operating. On the other hand, the propeller of an aircraft, especially before the advent of the constant-speed propeller, turned at widely differing rates of revolution per minute, depending on the throttle setting, and whether the aircraft was climbing, flying level, or diving. Even if it had been feasible to pick a particular point on an aircraft engine's tachometer at which a machine gun's cyclic rate would permit it to fire through the propeller arc, this would be very limiting.Kosin 1988, pp. 18‚Äì19. It has been pointed out that any mechanism that achieved this feat could be described as \\"interrupting\\" the fire of the gun (to the extent that it no longer actually works as an automatic weapon at all), and also as \\"synchronizing\\", or \\"timing\\" its fire to coincide with the revolutions of the propeller.Woodman 1989, p. 172.  Components  A typical synchronizing gear had three basic components. = Propeller = Propeller of an Albatros C.III. One blade severed by a faulty or badly adjusted synchronization gear Firstly, a method of determining the position of the propeller at a given instant was required. Typically, a cam, driven either directly from the propeller shaft itself, or from some part of the drive train revolving at the same speed as the propeller, generated a series of impulses at the same rate as the propeller's revolutions. There were exceptions to this. Some gears placed the cam within the gun trigger mechanism itself, and the firing impulses were sometimes timed to occur at every two or three revolutions of the propeller, or, especially in the case of hydraulic or electric gears, at the rate of two or more for each revolution. The diagrams in this section assume, for simplicity's sake, one impulse for one revolution, so that each synchronized round is \\"aimed\\" at a single spot on the propeller disc. Synchronised gun firing badly \\"out of synch\\". All or most rounds strike one blade of propeller, quickly destroying it The timing of each impulse had to be adjusted to coincide with a \\"safe\\" period, when the blades of the propeller were well out of the way, and this adjustment had to be checked at intervals, especially if the propeller was changed or refitted, as well as after a major engine overhaul. Faults in this adjustment (or, say, a cam wheel slipping a millimetre or two, or a pushrod flexing)The normal expansion and contraction due to changing temperature was quite enough, especially for longer rods. could well result in every bullet fired hitting the propeller, a worse result than if the gun was fired through the propeller with no control at all. The other main type of failure involved a break in the stream of firing impulses, usually due to the generator or linkages either jamming or breaking (or disintegrating). This simply meant the gun no longer fired, and was a common cause of synchronized guns \\"jamming\\". The speed of the propeller, and thus the distance that it travelled between the firing of the gun and the arrival of the bullet at the propeller disc, varied as the rate of engine revolutions changed. Where muzzle velocity was very high, and the guns were sited well forward so that the bullets had a very short distance to reach the disc of the propeller, this difference could be largely ignored. But in the case of relatively low muzzle velocity weapons, or any gun sited well back from the propeller, the question could become critical,Volker 1992, pt. 4, p. 60 and in some cases the pilot had to consult his tachometer, taking care that his engine revolutions were within a \\"safe\\" range before firing, otherwise risking speedy destruction of his propeller. This phenomenon was particularly marked in Austro-Hungarian fighters armed with the Schwarzlose gun: which had a low muzzle velocity and very marginal suitability for synchronization. = Weapon = An attempt to synchronise an unsuitable gun or faulty/disparate ammunition ‚Äì \\"rogue\\" shots ‚Äì some of which risk striking the propeller. The second requirement was for a gun that would reliably fire (or \\"interrupt\\" its fire) exactly when the gear \\"told\\" it to. Not all automatic weapons were equally amenable to synchronization. When it was ready to fire, a synchronized machine-gun ideally needed to have a round in the breech, the breech to be closed, and the action cocked (the so-called \\"closed bolt\\" position).Volker 1992, pt. 3, p. 52 The difficulty was that several widely used automatic weapons (notably the Lewis gun and the Italian Revelli) were triggered from an open bolt, so that there was typically a tiny but variable interval between the gun being triggered and its firing.Williams 2003, p. 34. This meant they could not be synchronized at all without extensive modification.Woodman 1989, pp. 176‚Äì177. In practice it was found that it was necessary for the gun to be fired in semi-automatic mode.Volker 1992, pt. 2, p. 79 As the propeller revolved, a series of \\"firing impulses\\" was transmitted to the gun, effectively \\"pulling the trigger\\", to fire a single shot. The majority of these impulses would catch the gun in the course of its firing cycle, that is, when it was \\"busy\\" ejecting a spent round or loading a fresh one, and would be \\"wasted\\"; but eventually the firing cycle was completed, and the gun was ready to fire. It then had to \\"wait\\" for the next impulse from the gear, and on receiving this it fired. This delay between being ready to fire and actually firing is what slowed the rate of fire in comparison with a free-firing machine gun, which fires the moment it is ready to do so; but provided the gear functioned correctly, the gun could fire fairly rapidly between the whirling propeller blades without striking them.Volker 1992, pt. 2, p. 78 Some other machine-guns, such as the Austrian Schwarzlose and the American Marlin, proved less than perfectly adapted to synchronization, although eventually predictable \\"single shot\\" firing was achieved, typically by modifying the trigger mechanism to emulate \\"closed bolt\\" firing. Most weapons that were successfully synchronized (at least in the First World War period) were (like the German Parabellum and \\"Spandau\\" guns and the British Vickers) based on the original Maxim gun of 1884, a closed bolt weapon operated by barrel recoil.Williams 2003, pp. 16‚Äì17. Before these distinctions were fully understood, much time was wasted on attempts to synchronize unsuitable weapons. Even a closed bolt weapon needed reliable ammunition.Bureau of Aircraft Production 1918, p. 11. If the cap in a cartridge is faulty to the extent of delaying the firing of the gun for a tiny fraction of a second (quite a common case in practice with mass-produced ammunition) this is of little consequence in the case of a gun in use by infantry on the ground, but in the case of a synchronized \\"aircraft\\" gun such a delay can produce a rogue firing, sufficiently \\"out of time\\" for it to risk hitting the propeller.Williams 2003, p. 35. A very similar problem could arise where the mass of a special round (such as an incendiary or explosive one) was different enough to produce a substantial difference in muzzle velocity. Robertson 1970, p.105 This was compounded by the additional risk to the integrity of the propeller due to the nature of the round. The \\"trigger motor\\" could theoretically take two forms. The earliest patent (Schneider 1913) assumed that the synchronization gear would periodically prevent the gun from firing, thus operating as a true, or literal \\"interrupter\\". In practice all \\"real- life\\" synchronization gears, for which we have reliable technical details, directly fired the gun: operating it as if it were a semi-automatic weapon rather than a completely automatic one. = Linkage = The third requirement is for a linkage between the \\"machines\\" (engine and gun) to be synchronized. Many early gears used an intricate and inherently fragile bell crank and push rod linkage that could easily jam or otherwise malfunction, especially when required to work at higher speeds than it had been designed for. There were several alternative methods, including an oscillating rod, a flexible drive, a column of hydraulic fluid, a cable, or an electrical connection. Generally, mechanical systems were inferior to hydraulic or electric ones, but none were ever entirely foolproof, and synchronization gears at best always remained liable to occasional failure. The Luftwaffe ace Adolf Galland in his memoir of the war period The First and the Last describes a serious faulty synchronization incident in 1941.Galland 1955, p. 219.  Rate of fire  The Fokker E.IV prototype's original \\"three-Spandau\\" armament, before the portside gun was removed. Production examples had two guns, arranged symmetrically. A pilot would usually only have the target in his sights for a fleeting moment, so a concentration of bullets was vital for achieving a \\"kill\\". Even flimsy First World War aircraft often took a surprisingly large number of hits to shoot down, later and larger aircraft were much harder propositions again. There were two obvious solutions‚Äîto fit a more efficient gun with a higher cyclic rate of fire, or increase the number of guns carried.A third solution was to replace the rifle calibre weapons with heavy machine guns or cannon: for various reasons this did not become common until the 1940s. Both of these measures impinged on the question of synchronization. Early synchronized guns of the 1915‚Äì1917 period had a rate of fire in the region of 400 rounds per minute. At this comparatively leisurely rate of fire a synchronizer can be geared down to deliver a single firing impulse every two or three turns of the propeller, rendering it more reliable without unduly slowing the rate of fire. To control a faster gun, with, for example, a cyclic rate of 800 or 1,000 rounds a minute, it was necessary to supply at least one impulse (if not two) for every rotation of the propeller, making it more liable to failure. The intricate mechanism of a mechanical linkage system, especially of the \\"push rod\\" type, could easily shake itself to pieces when driven at this rate. The final version of the Fokker Eindecker, the Fokker E.IV, came with two lMG 08 \\"Spandau\\" machine guns;Grosz 1996, p. 1. this armament became standard for all the German D-type scouts starting with the Albatros D.I.Fokker's initial armament for the first prototype E.IV was in fact three machine guns but simply mounting three \\"followers\\" on the single cam wheel of the early Stangensteuerung gear proved quite unworkable, and production examples carried only two guns. From the appearance of the Sopwith Camel and the SPAD S.XIII in mid-1917, right through to the end of gun synchronization in the 1950s, a twin gun installation was the international norm. Having the two guns firing simultaneously would obviously not have been a satisfactory arrangement. The guns needed to both fire at the same point on the propeller disc, which means that one had to fire a tiny fraction of a second later than the other. This is why early gears designed for a single machine gun needed to be modified in order to control two guns satisfactorily. In practice, at least part of the mechanism had to be duplicated, even if the two weapons were not synchronized separately.  History  Drawing from Euler's 1910 patent for a fixed forward-firing machine gun From the beginnings of practical flight, possible military uses for aircraft were considered, although not all writers came to positive conclusions on the subject. By 1913, military exercises in Britain, Germany, and France had confirmed the likely usefulness of aircraft for reconnaissance and surveillance, and this was seen by a few forward looking officers as implying the need to deter or destroy the enemy's reconnaissance machines. Thus aerial combat was by no means entirely unanticipated, and the machine gun was from the first seen as the most likely weapon to be used.Cheesman 1960, p. 176. What was not generally agreed on was the superiority, at least for an attacking aircraft, of fixed forward-firing guns, aimed by pointing the aircraft at its target, rather than flexible weapons, aimed by a gunner other than the pilot. As late as 1916, pilots of the DH.2 pusher fighter had problems convincing their senior officers that the forward- firing armament of their aircraft was more effective if it was fixed to fire forward rather than being flexible.Goulding 1986, p. 11. On the other hand, August Euler had patented the idea of a fixed gun as early as 1910 ‚Äì long before tractor aircraft became the norm, illustrating his patent with a diagram of a machine gun-armed pusher. = Franz Schneider patent (1913‚Äì1914) = Drawing from the first known patent for a gear to allow an automatic weapon to fire through the blades of a spinning aeroplane propeller Whether directly inspired by Euler's original patent or not, the first inventor to patent a method of firing forward through a tractor propeller was the Swiss engineer Franz Schneider, formerly with Nieuport, but by then working for the LVG Company in Germany. The patent was published in the German aviation magazine Flugsport in 1914, meaning that the concept became public knowledge at an early stage.VanWyngarden 2006, p. 7. The linkage between the propeller and the gun is achieved with a spinning drive shaft, rather than a reciprocating rod. The impulses needed to operate the trigger, or in this case to prevent the trigger from operating, are produced by a cam wheel with two lobes at 180¬∞ apart situated at the gun itself since firing is to be interrupted by both blades of the propeller. No attempt was made (so far as is known) to build or test an actual operating gear based on this patent, which attracted little or no official interest at the time. The exact form of the synchronization gear fitted to Schneider's LVG E.I of 1915, and its relationship to this patent, is unknown since no plans survive.Woodman 1989, p. 184. = Raymond Saulnier patent (1914) = Sketch from Morane-Saulnier design drawings based on original (1914) French patent Unlike the Schneider patent design, Saulnier's device was actually built, and may be considered the first practical synchronization gear to be tested.Cheesman 1960, p. 177. For the first time, the cam producing the to-and-fro movement conveying firing impulses to the gun is situated at the engine (driven in this case by the same spindle that operated the oil pump and the tachometer) and the impulses themselves are transmitted by a reciprocating rod rather than Schneider's rotating shaft. The idea of literally \\"interrupting\\" the firing of the gun gives way (probably as the result of experience) to the principle of pulling the trigger for each successive shot, like the action of a semi-automatic weapon.Woodman 1989, p. 181. It has been pointed out that this was a practical design that should have worked, but it did not.Volker 1992, pt. 1, p. 48 Apart from possible inconsistencies in the ammunition supplied, the real problem was that the gun used to trial the gear, a gas-operated Hotchkiss 8 mm (.323 in) machine gun borrowed from the French army, was fundamentally unsuitable for \\"semi-automatic\\" firing. Following initial unsuccessful tests, the gun had to be returned, and the experiments ceased. Damaged propeller from a Sopwith Baby aircraft c. 1916/17 showing bullet holes from a machine gun fired through the propeller without a synchronizer. = Unsynchronized guns and the \\"deflector wedge\\" concept = When the pilots of the British Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service arrived in France in 1914, they found themselves equipped with pusher aircraft too underpowered to carry machine guns and still have a chance of overtaking the enemy, and tractor aircraft which were difficult to arm effectively because the propeller was in the way. Among other attempts to get around this‚Äîsuch as firing obliquely past the arc of the propeller, and even efforts, doomed to failure, to synchronize the Lewis Gun which was at the time the \\"standard\\" British aircraft weaponWoodman 1989, pp. 173‚Äì180.‚Äî was the expedient of firing straight through the propeller arc and \\"hoping for the best\\".Woodman 1989, p. 173. A high proportion of bullets would in the normal course pass the propeller without striking the blades,Woodman in several places estimates the ratio of bullets striking the propeller as 25% (1:4). This seems incredibly high: A simple calculation, based on the percentage of the disc of the propeller taken up by the blades, would indicate that 12.5% (1:8) is still fairly pessimistic. and each blade might typically take several hits before there was much danger of its failing, especially if it were bound with tape to prevent splintering (see diagram below, and illustration to the left). Unsynchronised gun ‚Äì fire more or less randomly spread around propeller disc ‚Äì most rounds pass but a few strike the propeller After his early synchronization experiments failed, Saulnier pursued a method trusting rather less to statistics and luck by developing armoured propeller blades that would resist damage. Salvaged propeller with deflectors captured by the Germans. By March 1915, when French pilot Roland Garros approached Saulnier to arrange for this device to be installed on his Morane-Saulnier Type L, these had taken the form of steel wedges which deflected the bullets which might otherwise have damaged the propeller, or ricocheted dangerously.Williams 2003, pp. 33‚Äì34. Garros himself and Jules Hue (his personal mechanic) are sometimes credited with testing and perfecting the \\"deflectors\\".Volker 1992, pt. 1, pp. 49‚Äì50. This crude system worked after a fashion, although the wedges diminished the propeller's efficiency, and the not inconsiderable force of the impact of bullets on the deflector blades must have put undesirable stress on the engine's crankshaft. On 1 April 1915 Garros shot down his first German aircraft, killing both the crew. On 18 April 1915, after two more victories, Garros was forced down (by ground fire) behind German lines. Although he was able to burn his aircraft, Garros was captured and his special propeller was sufficiently intact to be sent for evaluation by the Inspektion der Fliegertruppen (Idflieg) at D√∂beritz near Berlin. = Fokker's Synchronizer and other German gears = Fokker Synchronization gear set up for ground firing test. The wooden disc records the point on the disc of the propeller where each round passed. The diagram opposite shows the probable result for a properly working gear. Inherent inaccuracies in both the gear and the triggering of the gun itself, small faults in normal service ammunition, and even the differing RPM rates of the engine, all combine to produce a \\"spread\\" of hits, rather than every bullet striking the disc in precisely the same spot Correctly functioning synchronisation gear: all rounds fired well within \\"safe\\" zone (well clear of propeller) Inspection of the propeller from Garros' machine prompted Idflieg to attempt to copy it. Initial trials indicated that the deflector wedges would not be sufficiently strong to cope with the standard steel-jacketed German ammunition, and representatives from Fokker and Pfalz, two companies already building Morane copies (although, strangely, not Schneider's LVG concern) were invited to D√∂beritz to inspect the mechanism and suggest ways that its action might be duplicated.Woodman 1989, p. 180. Anthony Fokker was able to persuade Idflieg to arrange the loan of a Parabellum machine gun and ammunition so that his device could be tested, and for these items to be transported forthwith to the Fokker Flugzeugwerke GmbH at Schwerin (although probably not in his railway compartment or \\"under his arm\\", as he claimed after the war).Fokker, Anthony and Bruce Gould 1931 The story of his conception, development and installation of the Fokker synchronization device in a period of 48 hours (first found in an authorised biography of Fokker written in 1929) is not now believed to be factual.Weyl 1965, p. 96. Another possible explanation is that Garros's Morane, partly destroyed by fire as it was, had sufficient traces of the original synchronization gear remaining for Fokker to have guessed how it worked.Courtney 1972, p. 80. For various reasons this also seems unlikely,The main problem is that it assumes Garros was flying the same machine that Saulnier had used for his earlier tests! and the current historical consensus points to a synchronization device having been in development by Fokker's team (including engineer Heinrich L√ºbbe) prior to the capture of Garros's machine.  Fokker Stangensteuerung gear  Detail of early Fokker Eindecker ‚Äì cowl is removed, showing Fokker's original Stangensteuerung gear connected directly to the oil pump drive at the rear of the engine Diagram of the production form of Fokker's \\"Stangensteuerung\\" synchronization mechanism. The green handle is used to lower the red cam follower onto the cam wheel attached to the propeller shaft. When the cam raises the follower, the blue rod is depressed against the spring, enabling the yellow trigger plate to be reached when the purple firing button is pressed Stangensteuerung synchronized machine gun mounted well forward on Albatros C.III Whatever its ultimate source, the initial version of the Fokker synchronization gear (see illustration) very closely followed, not Schneider's patent, as claimed by Schneider and others,In 1916 LVG and Schneider sued Fokker for patent infringement‚Äîand though the courts repeatedly found in Schneider's favour, Fokker refused to pay any royalties, all the way to the time of the Third Reich in 1933. but Saulnier's. Like the Saulnier patent, Fokker's gear was designed to actively fire the gun rather than interrupt it, and, like the later Vickers-Challenger gear developed for the RFC, it followed Saulnier in taking its primary mechanical drive from the oil pump of a rotary engine. The \\"transmission\\" between the motor and the gun was by a version of Saulnier's reciprocating push-rod.Woodman 1989, p. 183. The main difference was that instead of the push rod passing directly from the engine to the gun itself, which would have required a tunnel through the firewall and fuel tank (as shown in the Saulnier patent drawings), it was driven by a shaft joining the oil pump to a small cam at the top of the fuselage. This eventually proved unsatisfactory, as the oil pump's mechanical drive spindle was insufficiently robust to take the extra load. Before the failings of the first form of the gear had become clear, Fokker's team had adapted the new system to the new Parabellum MG14 machine gun, and fitted it to a Fokker M.5K, a type which was at the time serving in small numbers with the Fliegertruppen as the A.III. This aircraft, bearing IdFlieg serial number A.16/15 became the direct forerunner to the five M.5K/MG pre-production prototypes built, and was effectively the prototype of the Fokker E.I ‚Äì the first production single-seat fighter aircraft armed with a synchronized machine gun.Grosz 2002, p. 9. This prototype was demonstrated to IdFlieg by Fokker in person on 19‚Äì20 May 1915 at the D√∂beritz proving ground near Berlin. Leutnant Otto Parschau was test flying this aircraft by 30 May 1915. The five production prototypes (factory designated M.5K/MG and serialed E.1/15 ‚Äì E.5/15Grosz 2002, p. 9.) were undergoing military trials shortly thereafter. These were all armed with the Parabellum gun, synchronized with the first version of the Fokker gear. This prototype gear had such a short life that a redesign was necessary, producing the second, more familiar, production form of the gear. The gear used in the production Eindecker fighters (see diagram) replaced the oil pump's mechanical driveshaft-based system with a large cam wheel, almost a light flywheel, driven directly from the spinning rotary engine's crankcase. The push rod now took its reciprocating motion directly from a \\"follower\\" on this cam wheel. At the same time the machine gun used was also changed‚Äîan lMG 08 machine gun, the so-called \\"Spandau\\", replacing the Parabellum used with the prototype gear. At this time the Parabellum was still in very short supply, and all available examples were required as observers' guns, the lighter and handier weapon being far superior in this role. The first victory using a synchronized gun- equipped fighter is now believed to have occurred on 1 July 1915 when Leutnant Kurt Wintgens of Feldflieger Abteilung 6b, flying the Parabellum-armed Fokker M.5K/MG aircraft \\"E.5/15\\", forced down a French Morane-Saulnier Type L east of Lun√©ville.VanWyngarden 2006, p. 12. Exclusive possession of a working gun synchronizer enabled a period of German air superiority on the Western Front known as the Fokker Scourge. The German high command was protective of the synchronizer system, instructing pilots not to venture over enemy territory in case they were forced down and the secret revealed, but the basic principles involved were already common knowledge,Courtney 1972, p. 82.Courtney rather pungently remarks that \\"... there was no particular secret to protect\\". and by the middle of 1916 several Allied synchronizers were already available in quantity. By this time, the Fokker Stangensteuerung gear, which had worked reasonably well for synchronizing a single gun, firing at a modest cyclic rate through a two-bladed propeller driven by a rotary engine, was becoming obsolete. Stangensteuerung gears for \\"stationary\\", i.e., in-line engines, worked from a small cam immediately behind the propeller (see illustration). This produced a basic dilemma: A short, fairly robust push rod meant that the machine gun had to be mounted well forward, putting the breech of the gun out of the pilot's reach for clearing jams. If the gun was mounted in the ideal position, within easy reach of the pilot, a much longer push rod was required, which tended to bend and break. The other problem was that the Stangensteuerung never worked well with more than one gun. Two (or even three) guns, mounted side by side and firing simultaneously, would have produced a wide spread of fire that would have been impossible to match with the \\"safe zone\\" between the whirling propeller blades. Fokker's initial answer to this was the fitting of extra \\"followers\\" to the Stangensteuerung's large cam wheel, to (theoretically) produce the \\"ripple\\" salvo necessary to ensure that the guns were aimed at the same point on the propeller disc. This proved a disastrously unstable arrangement in the case of three guns, and was rather less than satisfactory, even for two.Grosz 1996, p. 1. Most of the early Fokker and Halberstadt biplane fighters were limited to a single gun for this reason.At least as much as the more commonly cited effect on performance of the weight of an extra gun. In fact, the builders of the new Albatros twin- gunned stationary-engine fighters of late 1916 had to introduce their own synchronization gear, known as the Hedtke gear or Hedtkesteuerung, and it was evident that Fokker were going to have to come up with something radically new.  Fokker Zentralsteuerung gear  Twin guns synchronized by the Zentralsteuerung system in a Fokker D.VIII fighter. The \\"pipes\\" connecting the guns and the engine are flexible drive shafts This was designed in late 1916 and took the form of a new synchronization gear without any rods at all. The cam that generated the firing impulses was moved from the engine to the gun; the trigger motor in effect now generated its own firing impulses. The linkage between the propeller and the gun now consisted of a flexible drive shaft directly connecting the end of the engine camshaft to the trigger motor of the gun.Hegener 1961, p. 32. The firing button for the gun simply engaged a clutch at the engine which set the flexible drive (and thus the trigger motor) in motion. In some ways this brought the new gear closer to the original Schneider patent (q.v.). A major advantage was that the adjustment (to set where on the propeller's disc each bullet was to impact) was now in the gun itself. This meant that each gun was adjusted separately, an important feature, since twin synchronized guns were not set to be fired in strict unison, but when they were pointing at the same point on the propeller disc. Each gun could be fired independently, since it had its own flexible drive, linked to the engine camshaft by a junction box, and having its own clutch. This provision of a quite separate set of components for each gun also meant that a failure in the gear for one gun did not impinge on the other. This gear was available in numbers by mid 1917, in time for installation on the Fokker Dr.I triplane and all later German fighters. In fact it became the standard synchronizer for the Luftstreitkr√§fte for the remainder of the war,Hegener 1961, p. 33. although experiments to find an even more reliable gear continued.  Other German synchronizers  LVG E.I, with Schneider ring and forward-firing synchronized gun, presumably with a Schneider-designed gear, about which nothing is now known = 1915 Schneider gear = In June 1915 a two-seater monoplane designed by Schneider for the LVG Company was sent to the front for evaluation. Its observer was armed with the new Schneider gun ring that was becoming standard on all German two-seaters: the pilot was apparently armed with a fixed synchronized machine gun.Cheesman 1960, p. 177. The aircraft crashed on its way to the front and nothing more was heard of it, or its synchronization gear, although it was presumably based on Schneider's own patent. = Albatros gears = The new Albatros fighters of late 1916 were fitted with twin guns synchronized with the Albatros-Hedtke Steuerung gear, which was designed by Albatros Werkmeister Hedtke.Volker 1992, pt. 6, p. 33. The system was specifically intended to overcome the problems that had arisen in applying the Fokker Stangensteuerung gear to in-line engines and twin gun installations, and was a variation of the rigid push-rod system, driven from the rear of the crankshaft of the Mercedes D.III engine. The Albatros D.V used a new gear, designed by Werkmeister Semmler: (the Albatros- Semmler Steuerung). It was basically an improved version of the Hedtke gear. An official order, signed on 24 July 1917 standardised the superior Fokker Zentralsteuerung system for all German aircraft, presumably including Albatroses.Hegener 1961, p. 33.Volker 1992, pt. 6, p. 34. = Electrical gears = Post First World War German fighters were fitted with electrical synchronizers. In such a gear, a contact or set of contacts, either on the propeller shaft itself, or some other part of the drive train revolving at the same number of revolutions per minute, generates a series of electrical pulses, which are transmitted to a solenoid driven trigger motor at the gun. Experiments with these were underway before the end of the war, and again the LVG company seems to have been involved: a British intelligence report from 25 June 1918 mentions an LVG two-seater fitted with such a gear that was brought down in the British lines. It is known that LVG built 40 C.IV two-seaters fitted with a Siemens electrical synchronizing system. In addition, the Aviatik company received instructions to install 50 of their own electrical synchronization system on to DFW C.Vs (Av). = Austria-Hungary = The standard machine gun of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces in 1914 was the Schwarzlose gun, which operated on a \\"delayed blow back\\" system and was not ideally suited to synchronization.Volker 1992, pt. 3, p. 56 Unlike the French and Italians, who were eventually able to acquire supplies of Vickers guns, the Austrians were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of \\"Spandaus\\" from their German allies and were forced to use the Schwarzlose in an application for which it was not really suited. Although the problem of synchronizing the Schwarzlose was eventually partially solved, it was not until late 1916 that gears were available. Even then, at high engine revolutions Austrian synchronizer gears tended to behave very erratically. Austrian fighters were fitted with large tachometers to ensure that a pilot could check that his \\"revs\\" were within the required range before firing his guns, and propeller blades were fitted with an electrical warning system that alerted a pilot if his propeller was being hit.Woodman 1989, pp. 200‚Äì202. There were never enough gears available, due to a chronic shortage of precision tools; so that production fighters, even the excellent Austrian versions of the Albatros D.III, often had to be sent to the front in an unarmed state, for squadron armourers to fit such guns and gears as could be scrounged, salvaged or improvised.Varriale 2012, pp. 9‚Äì10. Rather than standardising on a single system, different Austrian manufacturers produced their own gears. The research of Harry Woodman (1989) identified the following types:  Zahnrad- Steuerung (cogwheel-control)  Drive was from the camshaft operating rods of an Austro-Daimler engine via a wormgear. The early Schwarzlose gun had a synchronized rate of 360 rounds per minute with this gear ‚Äì this was later boosted to 380 rounds with the MG16 model.Woodman 1989, p. 201.  Bernatzik-Steuerung  Drive was taken from the rocking arm of an exhaust valve, a lever fixed to the valve housing transmitting impulses to the gun through a rod. Designed by Leutnant Otto Bernatzik, it was geared down to deliver a firing impulse every second revolution of the propeller, and fired at about 380 to 400 rounds per gun.Guttman 2009, p. 194. As with other gears synchronizing the Schwarzlose gun, firing became erratic at high engine speeds.  Priesel-Steuerung  Apart from a control that engaged the cam follower and fired the gun in one movement, this gear was based closely on the original Fokker Stangensteuerung gear. It was designed by Oberleutnant Guido Priesel, and became standard on Oeffag Albatros fighters in 1918.  Zap- Steuerung (Zaparka control)  This gear was designed by Oberleutnant Eduard Zaparka. Drive was from the rear of the camshaft of a Hiero engine through a transmission shaft with Carden joints. The rate of fire, with the later Schwarzlose gun, was up to 500 rounds per minute. The machine gun had to be placed well forward, where it was inaccessible to the pilot, so that jams could not be cleared in flight.  Kralische Zentralsteuerung  Based on the principle of the Fokker Zentralsteuerung gear, with flexible drives linked to the camshaft, and firing impulses being generated by the trigger motor of each gun. Geared down to operate more reliably with the difficult Schwarzlose gun, its rate of fire was limited to 360‚Äì380 rounds per minute.Woodman 1989, p. 202. = United Kingdom = Mounting of synchronized Vickers gun on Bristol Scout, using the Vickers-Challenger gear: note long push rod at awkward angle British gun synchronization got off to a quick but rather shaky start. The early mechanical synchronization gears turned out to be inefficient and unreliable, and full standardisation on the very satisfactory hydraulic \\"C.C.\\" gear was not accomplished until November 1917. As a result, synchronized guns seem to have been rather unpopular with British fighter pilots well into 1917; and the overwing Lewis gun, on its Foster mounting, remained the weapon of choice for Nieuports in British service,Cheesman 1960, p. 181. being also initially considered as the main weapon of the S.E.5. Significantly, early problems with the C.C. gear were considered one of the less pressing matters for No. 56 squadron in March 1917, busy getting their new S.E.5 fighters combat worthy before they went to France, since they had the overwing Lewis to fall back on!Pengelly 2010, p. 153. Ball actually had his Vickers gun removed altogether for a while, to save weight.Hare 2013, p. 52.  Vickers- Challenger gear  Much neater, more practical application of the Vickers- Challenger gear for the synchronized Vickers gun of an R.E.8 The first British synchronizer gear was built by the manufacturer of the machine-gun for which it was designed: it went into production in December 1915. George Challenger, the designer, was at the time an engineer at Vickers. In principle it closely resembled the first form of the Fokker gear, although this was not because it was a copy (as is sometimes reported): it was not until April 1916 that a captured Fokker was available for technical analysis. The fact is that both gears were based closely on the Saulnier patent. The first version was driven by a reduction gear attached to a rotary engine oil pump spindle as in Saulnier's design and a small impulse-generating cam was mounted externally on the port side of the forward fuselage where it was readily accessible for adjustment.Woodman 1989, pp. 187‚Äì189. Unfortunately, when the gear was fitted to types such as the Bristol Scout and the Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter, which had rotary engines and their forward-firing machine gun in front of the cockpit, the long push rod linking the gear to the gun had to be mounted at an awkward angle, in which it was liable to twisting and deformation as well as expansion and contraction due to temperature changes. For this reason the B.E.12, the R.E.8 and Vickers' own FB 19 mounted their forward-firing machine guns on the port side of the fuselage so that a relatively short version of the push rod could be linked directly to the gun. This worked reasonably well although the \\"awkward\\" position of the gun, which precluded direct sighting, was initially much criticised. It proved less of a problem than was at first supposed once it was realized that it was the aircraft that was aimed rather than the gun itself. The last aircraft type to be fitted with the Vickers-Challenger gear, the R.E.8, retained the port-side position of the gun even after most were retrofitted with the C.C. gear from mid 1917.  Scarff-Dibovski gear  Cam gear of the Scarff Dibovsky Lieutenant Victor Dibovski, an officer of the Imperial Russian Navy, while serving as a member of a mission to England to observe and report on British aircraft production methods, suggested a synchronization gear of his own design. According to Russian sources, this gear had already been tested in Russia, with mixed results,Kulikov 2013, pp. 13‚Äì14. although it is possible that the earlier Dibovski gear was actually a deflector system rather than a true synchronizer. In any case, Warrant Officer F. W. Scarff worked with Dibovski to develop and realize the gear, which worked on the familiar cam and rider principle, the connection to the gun being by the usual push rod and a rather complicated series of levers. It was geared in order to slow the rate that firing impulses were delivered to the gun (and hence improve reliability, although not the rate of fire). The gear was ordered for the Royal Naval Air Service and followed the Vickers- Challenger gear into production by a matter of weeks. It was more adaptable to rotary engines than the Vickers-Challenger, but apart from early Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutters built to RNAS orders in 1916, and possibly some early Sopwith Pups, no actual applications seem to have been recorded Woodman 1989, pp. 189‚Äì190..  Ross and other \\"miscellaneous\\" gears  The Ross gear was an interim, field-built gear designed in 1916 specifically to replace the unsuitable Vickers-Challenger gears in the 1¬Ω Strutters of the RFC's No.70 Squadron.It is likely that the Scarff-Dibovski gear ‚Äì being Navy issue, would not have been readily available for this purpose. Officially it was designed by Captain Ross of No.70, although it has been suggested that a flight-sergeant working under Captain Ross was largely responsible. The gear was apparently used only on 1¬Ω Strutters, but No. 45 squadron used at least some examples of the gear, as well as No. 70. It was replaced by the Sopwith-Kauper gear when that gear became available.Woodman 1989, p. 192. Norman Macmillan, writing some years after the event, claimed that the Ross gear had a very slow rate of fire, but that it left the original trigger intact, so that it was possible \\"in a really tight corner\\" to \\"fire the gun direct without the gear, and get the normal rate of fire of the ground gun\\". Macmillan claimed that propellers with up to twenty hits nonetheless got their aircraft home.Bruce 1966, p. 7. Some aspects of this information are hard to reconcile with the way a synchronized gun actually worked, and may well be a matter of Macmillan's memory playing tricks. Another \\"field made\\" synchronizer was the ARSIAD: produced by the Aeroplane Repair Section of the No.1 Aircraft Depot in 1916. Little specific seems to be known about it; although it may have been fitted to some early R.E.8s for which no Vickers-Challenger gears could be found. Airco and Armstrong Whitworth both designed their own gears specifically for their own aircraft. Standardisation on the hydraulic C.C. gear (described below) occurred before either had been produced in numbers.Woodman 1989, pp. 192‚Äì193. Only Sopwiths' gear (next section) was to go into production.  Sopwith- Kauper gear  A diagram from the maintenance manual for installation of Sopwith-Kauper synchronization (Mk.III) gear in early production Sopwith Camels (1917) The first mechanical synchronization gears fitted to early Sopwith fighters were so unsatisfactory that in mid 1916 Sopwiths had an improved gear designed by their foreman of works Harry Kauper, a friend and colleague of fellow Australian Harry Hawker.Woodman 1989, pp. 191‚Äì192. This gear was specifically intended to overcome the faults of earlier gears. Patents connected with the extensively modified Mk.II and Mk.III versions were applied for in January and June 1917. Mechanical efficiency was improved by reversing the action of the push rod. The firing impulse was generated at a low point of the cam instead of at the lobe of the cam as in Saulnier's patent. Thus the force on the rod was exerted by tension rather than compression, (or in less technical language, the trigger motor worked by being \\"pulled\\" rather than \\"pushed\\") which enabled the rod to be lighter, minimising its inertia so that it could operate faster (at least in early versions of the gear, each revolution of the cam wheel produced two firing impulses instead of one). A single firing lever engaged the gear and fired the gun in one action, rather than the gear having to be \\"turned on\\" and then fired, as with some earlier gears. 2,750 examples of the Sopwith-Kauper gear were installed in service aircraft: as well as being the standard gear for the Sopwith Pup and Triplane it was fitted to many early Camels, and replaced earlier gears in 1¬Ω Strutters and other Sopwith types. However, by November 1917, in spite of several modifications, it was becoming evident that even the Sopwith-Kauper gear suffered from the inherent limitations of mechanical gears. Camel squadrons, in particular, reported that propellers were frequently being \\"shot through\\", the gears having a tendency to \\"run away\\". Wear and tear, as well as the increased rate of fire of the Vickers gun and higher engine speeds were responsible for this decline in performance and reliability. By this time the teething problems of the hydraulic C.C. gear had been overcome and it was made standard for all British aircraft, including Sopwiths.  Constantinesco synchronization gear  U.S. Patent office drawing for C.C. Synchronization gear. The pump-like component was the oil reservoir, and was situated in the cockpit. Lifting its handle ensured there was adequate hydraulic pressure to operate the gear Major Colley, the Chief Experimental Officer and Artillery Adviser at the War Office Munitions Invention Department, became interested in George Constantinesco's theory of Wave Transmission, and worked with him to determine how his invention could be put to practical use, finally hitting on the notion of developing a synchronization gear based on it. Major Colley used his contacts in the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Artillery (his own corps) to obtain the loan of a Vickers machine gun and 1,000 rounds of ammunition. Constantinesco drew on his work with rock drills to develop a synchronization gear using his wave transmission system.Woodman 1989, p. 195. In May 1916, he prepared the first drawing and an experimental model of what became known as the Constantinesco Fire Control Gear or the \\"C.C. (Constantinesco-Colley) Gear\\". The first provisional patent application for the Gear was submitted on 14 July 1916 (No. 512). At first, the meticulous Constantinesco was dissatisfied with the odd slightly deviant hit on his test disc. It was found that carefully inspecting the ammunition cured this fault (common, of course, to all such gears); with good quality rounds, the performance of the gear pleased even its creator. The first working C.C. gear was air-tested in a B.E.2c in August 1916.Sweetman 2010, p. 111. The new gear had several advantages over all mechanical gears: the rate of fire was greatly improved, the synchronization was much more accurate, and above all it was readily adaptable to any type of engine and airframe, instead of needing a specially designed impulse generator for each type of engine and special linkages for each type of aircraft.Cheesman 1960, p. 180. In the long run (provided it was properly maintained and adjusted) it also proved far more durable and less prone to failure.Woodman 1989, p. 196. No. 55 Squadron's DH.4s arrived in France on 6 March 1917 fitted with the new gear, followed shortly after by No. 48 squadron's Bristol Fighters and No. 56 Squadron's S.E.5s. Early production models had some teething troubles in service, as ground crew learned to service and adjust the new gears, and pilots to operate them.Woodman 1989, p. 196. It was late in 1917 before a version of the gear that could operate twin guns became available, so that the first Sopwith Camels had to be fitted with the Sopwith-Kauper gear instead. From November 1917 the gear finally became standard; being fitted to all new British aircraft with synchronized guns from that date up to the Gloster Gladiator of 1937. Over 6,000 gears were fitted to machines of the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service between March and December 1917. Twenty thousand more \\"Constantinesco-Colley\\" gun synchronization systems were fitted to British military aircraft between January and October 1918, during the period when the Royal Air Force was formed from the two earlier services on April 1, 1918. A total of 50,000 gears were manufactured during the twenty years it was standard equipment. A synchronized Vickers gun fitted to an improvised test stand; an electric motor drives a structure that simulates the propeller  Betteridge gear  The C.C. gear was not the only hydraulic gear to be proposed; in 1917 Air Mechanic A.R. Betteridge of No.1 Squadron Australian Flying Corps built and tested a gear of his own design while serving with his unit in Palestine. No official interest was expressed in this device; possibly the C.C. gear was already in prospect.Woodman 1989, p. 193. The illustration seems very likely to be of the test rig for this gear. = France = The French Aviation Militaire was fortunate in that they were able to standardise on two reasonably satisfactory synchronization gears ‚Äì one adapted for rotary engines, and the other for \\"stationary\\" (in-line) ones ‚Äì almost from the beginning. Nieuport 17 with machine gun synchronized by Alkan-Hamy system. The large reel behind the machine gun is a take-up spool for the ammunition belt and nothing to do with the synchronization gear. Note how the push rod has effectively become part of the gun  Alkan-Hamy gear  The first French synchronizer was developed by Sergeant-Mecanicien Robert Alkan and l'Ingenieur du Maritime Hamy. It was based closely on the definitive Fokker Stangensteuerung gear: the main difference being that the push rod was installed within the Vickers gun, using a redundant steam tube in the cooling jacket. This mitigated a major drawback of other push rod gears in that the rod, being supported for its whole length, was much less liable to distortion or breakage. Vickers guns modified to take this gear can be distinguished by the housing for the push rod's spring, projecting from the front of the gun like a second barrel. This gear was first installed and air-tested in a Nieuport 12, on 2 May 1916, and other pre- production gears were fitted to contemporary Morane-Saulnier and Nieuport fighters. The Alkan-Hamy gear was standardised as the Systeme de Synchronisation pour Vickers Type I (moteurs rotatifs), becoming available in numbers in time for the arrival of the Nieuport 17 at the front in mid 1916, as the standard gear for forward-firing guns of rotary-engine French aircraft.Woodman 1989, pp. 197‚Äì198. The Nieuport 28 used a different gear ‚Äì now known only through American documentation, where it is described as the \\"Nieuport Synchronizing gear\\" or the \\"Gnome gear\\".Woodman 1989, p. 199. A spinning drive shaft, driven by the rotating crankcase of the Nieuport's 160 CV Gnome 9N Monosoupape rotary engine, drove two separately adjustable trigger motors ‚Äì each imparting firing impulses to its gun by means of its own short rod.Hamady 2008 pp. 222‚Äì223. Photographic evidence suggests that an earlier version of this gear, controlling a single gun, might have been fitted to the Nieuport 23 and the Hanriot HD.1.  Birkigt gear  The SPAD S.VII was designed around Marc Birkigt's Hispano-Suiza engine, and when the new fighter entered service in September 1916 it came armed with a single Vickers gun synchronized with a new gear provided by Birkigt for use with his engine. Unlike most other mechanical gears, the \\"SPAD gear\\" as it was often called, did without a pushrod altogether: the firing impulses being transmitted to the gun torsionally by a moving oscillating shaft, which rotated through about a quarter of a revolution, alternately clockwise and anticlockwise. This oscillation was more mechanically efficient than the reciprocating motion of a push rod, permitting higher speeds. Officially known as the Systeme de Synchronisation pour Vickers Type II (moteurs fixes) the Birkigt gear was later adapted to control two guns, and remained in use in French service up to the time of the Second World War.Woodman 1989, p. 198. = Russia = No Russian synchronization gears went into production before the 1917 Revolution ‚Äì although experiments by Victor Dibovski in 1915 contributed to the later British Scarff-Dibovski gear (described above), and another naval officer, G.I. Lavrov, also designed a gear that was fitted to the unsuccessful Sikorsky S-16. French and British designs licence-built in Russia used the Alkan-Hamy or Birkigt gears. Fighters of the Soviet era used synchronized guns right up to the time of the Korean War, when the Lavochkin La-11 and the Yakovlev Yak-9 became the last synchronizer-equipped aircraft to see combat action. = Italy = The Italian Fiat-Revelli gun did not prove amenable to synchronization, so the Vickers became the standard pilot's weapon, synchronized by the Alkan-Hamy or Birkigt gears. = United States = French and British combat aircraft ordered for the American Expeditionary Force in 1917/18 were fitted with their \\"native\\" synchronization gears, including the Alkan-Hamy in Nieuports and French-built Sopwiths, the Birkigt gear in SPADs, and the C.C. gear for British types. The C.C. was also adopted for the twin M1917/18 Marlin machine guns fitted to the American built DH-4, and was itself made in America until the Nelson gear appeared in numbers.  Nelson gear  The Marlin gas operated gun proved less amenable to synchronization than the Vickers. It was found that \\"rogue\\" shots occasionally pierced the propeller, even when the gear was properly adjusted and otherwise functioning well. The problem was eventually resolved by modifications to the Marlin's trigger mechanism,Bureau of Aircraft Production 1918, p. 20. but in the meantime the engineer Adolph L. Nelson at the Airplane Engineering Department at McCook Field had developed a new, mechanical gear especially adapted to the Marlin, officially known as the Nelson single shot synchronizer.Woodman 1989, pp. 199‚Äì200. In place of the push rod common to many mechanical gears, or the \\"pull rod\\" of the Sopwith- Kauper, the Nelson gear used a cable held in tension for the transmission of firing impulses to the gun. Production models were largely too late for use before the end of the First World War, but the Nelson gear became the post-war U.S. standard, as Vickers and Marlin guns were phased out in favour of the Browning .30 calibre machine gun.  E-4/E-8 gears  The Nelson gear proved reliable and accurate, but it was expensive to produce and the necessity for its cable to be given a straight run could create difficulties when it was to be installed in a new type. By 1929 the latest model (the E-4 gear) had a new and simplified impulse generator, a new trigger motor, and the impulse cable was enclosed in a metal tube, protecting it, and permitting shallow bends. While the basic principle of the new gear remained unchanged: virtually all the components had been redesigned, and it was no longer officially referred to as the \\"Nelson\\" gear. The gear was further modernised in 1942 as the E-8. This final model had a modified impulse generator that was easier to adjust and was controlled from the cockpit by an electrical solenoid rather than a Bowden cable. = Decline and end of synchronization = Mockup of the fuselage of Hawker Hurricane prototype ‚Äì showing the installation of Merlin Engine and originally projected synchronized Vickers machinegun (later deleted) A Messerschmitt Bf 109E showing a traditional pair of synchronized machine guns, a motorkanone firing through the propeller hub and wing guns The usefulness of synchronization gears naturally disappeared altogether when jet engines eliminated the propeller, at least in fighter aircraft, but gun synchronization, even in single reciprocating engine aircraft, had already been in decline for twenty years prior to this. The increased speeds of the new monoplanes of the mid to late 1930s meant that the time available to deliver a sufficient weight of fire to bring down an enemy aircraft was greatly reduced. At the same time, the primary vehicle of air power was increasingly seen as the large all-metal bomber: powerful enough to carry armour protection for its vulnerable areas. Two rifle-calibre machine guns were no longer enough, especially for defence planners who anticipated a primarily strategic role for airpower. An effective \\"anti-bomber\\" fighter needed something more. Cantilever monoplane wings provided ample space to mount armament‚Äîand, being much more rigid than the old cable-braced wings, they afforded almost as steady a mounting as the fuselage. This new context also made the harmonisation of wing guns more satisfactory, producing a fairly narrow cone of fire in the close to medium ranges at which a fighter's gun armament was most effective. The retention of fuselage-mounted guns, with the additional weight of their synchronization gear (which slowed their rate of fire, albeit only slightly, and still occasionally failed, resulting in damage to propellers) became increasingly unattractive. This design philosophy, common in Britain and France (and, after 1941, the United States) tended towards eliminating fuselage mounted guns altogether. For example, the original 1934 specifications for the Hawker Hurricane were for a similar armament to the Gloster Gladiator: four machine-guns, two in the wings and two in the fuselage, synchronized to fire through the propeller arc. The illustration opposite is of an early mock-up of the prototype, showing the starboard fuselage gun. The prototype (K5083) as completed had ballast representing this armament; production Hurricane Is, however, were armed with eight guns, all in the wings.Mason 1962, p. 21 Another approach, common to Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan, while recognising the necessity to increase armament, preferred a system that included synchronized weapons. Centralised guns had the real advantage that their range was limited only by ballistics, as they did not need the gun harmonisation necessary to concentrate the fire of wing-mounted guns. They were seen as rewarding the true marksman, as they involved less dependence on gun sight technology. Mounting guns in the fuselage also concentrated mass at the centre of gravity, thus improving the fighter's roll ability.http://www.quarryhs.co.uk/ideal.htm More consistent ammunition manufacture, and improved synchronization gear systems made the whole concept more efficient and effective, whilst facilitating its application to weapons of increased calibre such as autocannon; moreover the constant-speed propellers that quickly became standard equipment on WW II fighters meant that the ratio between the propeller speed and the rate of fire of the guns varied less erratically. These considerations resulted in a reluctance to abandon fuselage-mounted guns altogether. The question was exactly where to mount additional guns. With a few exceptions, space limitations made mounting more than two synchronized guns in the forward fuselage highly problematic. The option of adding a third weapon firing through a hollow propeller shaft (an old idea, dating, like synchronization, from a Schneider patent of 1913) was only applicable to fighters with geared in-line engines, and even for them added only a single weapon. In the case of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 the fighter's wing roots were utilised for mounting additional weapons, although this required both synchronization and harmonisation. In any case, most designers of reciprocating engine fighters found that any worthwhile increase in firepower had to include at least some guns mounted in the fighter's wings, and that the firepower offered by synchronized weapons came to represent a decreasing percentage of a fighter's total armament. The final swan-song of synchronization belongs to the last reciprocating engine Soviet fighters, which largely made do with slow firing synchronized cannon throughout the World War II period and after. In fact, the very last synchronizer-equipped aircraft to see combat action were the Lavochkin La-11 and the Yakovlev Yak-9 during the Korean War.Volker 1992, pt. 2, p. 76 Popular culture The act of shooting one's own propeller is a trope that can be found in comedic gags, like the 1965 cartoon short \\"Just Plane Beep\\" starring Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. In this film, the attacking Coyote reduces his propeller to splinters after numerous bullets strike.  Notes   References   Bibliography  * Barnes, C. H.

Andrew Wiles proved the modularity theorem for semistable elliptic curves, which was enough to imply Fermat's Last Theorem. Later, a series of papers by Wiles's former students Brian Conrad, Fred Diamond and Richard Taylor, culminating in a joint paper with Christophe Breuil, extended Wiles's techniques to prove the full modularity theorem in 2001. Statement The theorem states that any elliptic curve over Q can be obtained via a rational map with integer coefficients from the classical modular curve X_0(N) for some integer N; this is a curve with integer coefficients with an explicit definition. This mapping is called a modular parametrization of level N. If N is the smallest integer for which such a parametrization can be found (which by the modularity theorem itself is now known to be a number called the conductor), then the parametrization may be defined in terms of a mapping generated by a particular kind of modular form of weight two and level N, a normalized newform with integer q-expansion, followed if need be by an isogeny. The modularity theorem implies a closely related analytic statement: to an elliptic curve E over Q we may attach a corresponding L-series. The L-series is a Dirichlet series, commonly written :L(E, s) = \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{a_n}{n^s}. The generating function of the coefficients a_n is then :f(E, q) = \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_n q^n. If we make the substitution :q = e^{2 \\\\pi i \\\\tau} we see that we have written the Fourier expansion of a function f(E, \\\\tau) of the complex variable œÑ, so the coefficients of the q-series are also thought of as the Fourier coefficients of f. The function obtained in this way is, remarkably, a cusp form of weight two and level N and is also an eigenform (an eigenvector of all Hecke operators); this is the Hasse‚ÄìWeil conjecture, which follows from the modularity theorem. Some modular forms of weight two, in turn, correspond to holomorphic differentials for an elliptic curve. The Jacobian of the modular curve can (up to isogeny) be written as a product of irreducible Abelian varieties, corresponding to Hecke eigenforms of weight 2. The 1-dimensional factors are elliptic curves (there can also be higher- dimensional factors, so not all Hecke eigenforms correspond to rational elliptic curves). The curve obtained by finding the corresponding cusp form, and then constructing a curve from it, is isogenous to the original curve (but not, in general, isomorphic to it). stated a preliminary (slightly incorrect) version of the conjecture at the 1955 international symposium on algebraic number theory in Tokyo and Nikk≈ç. Goro Shimura and Taniyama worked on improving its rigor until 1957. rediscovered the conjecture, and showed that it would follow from the (conjectured) functional equations for some twisted L-series of the elliptic curve; this was the first serious evidence that the conjecture might be true. Weil also showed that the conductor of the elliptic curve should be the level of the corresponding modular form. The Taniyama‚ÄìShimura‚ÄìWeil conjecture became a part of the Langlands program. The conjecture attracted considerable interest when suggested that it implies Fermat's Last Theorem. He did this by attempting to show that any counterexample to Fermat's Last Theorem would imply the existence of at least one non-modular elliptic curve. This argument was completed when identified a missing link (now known as the epsilon conjecture or Ribet's theorem) in Frey's original work, followed two years later by 's completion of a proof of the epsilon conjecture. Even after gaining serious attention, the Taniyama‚ÄìShimura‚ÄìWeil conjecture was seen by contemporary mathematicians as extraordinarily difficult to prove or perhaps even inaccessible to proof . For example, Wiles's ex-supervisor John Coates states that it seemed \\"impossible to actually prove\\", and Ken Ribet considered himself \\"one of the vast majority of people who believed [it] was completely inaccessible\\". , with some help from Richard Taylor, proved the Taniyama‚ÄìShimura‚ÄìWeil conjecture for all semistable elliptic curves, which he used to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, and the full Taniyama‚ÄìShimura‚ÄìWeil conjecture was finally proved by , , and who, building on Wiles's work, incrementally chipped away at the remaining cases until the full result was proved. Once fully proven, the conjecture became known as the modularity theorem. Several theorems in number theory similar to Fermat's Last Theorem follow from the modularity theorem. For example: no cube can be written as a sum of two coprime n-th powers, n ‚â• 3\\\\. (The case n = 3 was already known by Euler.) Generalizations The modularity theorem is a special case of more general conjectures due to Robert Langlands. The Langlands program seeks to attach an automorphic form or automorphic representation (a suitable generalization of a modular form) to more general objects of arithmetic algebraic geometry, such as to every elliptic curve over a number field. Most cases of these extended conjectures have not yet been proved. However, proved that elliptic curves defined over real quadratic fields are modular.

Piombino is an Italian town and comune of about 35,000 inhabitants in the province of Livorno (Tuscany). It lies on the border between the Ligurian Sea and the Tyrrhenian Sea, in front of Elba Island and at the northern side of Maremma. Overview It has an ancient historical centre, derived from the time in which it was the Etruscans' port, in the surroundings of Populonia. In the Middle Ages, it was instead an important port of the Republic of Pisa. Its hinterland hosts a considerable industrial area. Its port is still heavily used, both for industry and for tourism, with ferry-boats to Portoferraio (Elba) and Olbia (Sardinia). Geography The bounding communes of Piombino are Campiglia Marittima, Follonica, San Vincenzo and Suvereto. The town has seven civil parishes (frazioni): Baratti, Colmata, Fiorentina, La Sdriscia, Populonia, Populonia Stazione and Riotorto. History The area of modern Piombino was settled since ancient times. During the Etruscan era the main city in the area was Populonia, now a frazione within the comune of Piombino. The name Piombino derives almost certainly from Populino, meaning \\"Small Populonia\\", which the refugees gave to a small village where they had taken refuge after the city had been attacked by Greek pirates (9th century). It is also probable that Piombino had already been founded during the Ostrogoth domination. In 1022 the Monastery of San Giustiniano was founded in the area, boosting the activity of fishermen, sailors and workers. In 1115 Piombino submitted to the Republic of Pisa, becoming its second main port: authority was exerted by a Capitano (\\"Captain\\"). During the conflicts between the Pisane and the Genoese (12th‚Äì13th centuries) the city was sacked various times. In 1248 the Capitano Ugolino Arsopachi built the Channels. The Castle of Piombino remained a Pisan possession until Gerardo Appiani, ceding Pisa to the Milanese Visconti, carved out the independent state of the Principality of Piombino that included the islands of the Tuscan Archipelago: Elba, Pianosa, Montecristo, Capraia, Gorgona, and Giglio, for his family who held it until 1634. In 1445, through his marriage with Caterina Appiani, Rinaldo Orsini acquired the lordship. In 1501‚Äì1503 the principality was under Cesare Borgia. In 1509 the Appiani became princes of the Holy Roman Empire with the title of Piombino. Map of Piombino and its fortifications, 18th century. After Cosimo I de' Medici had occupied it in the course of the war against Siena, in 1553 and 1555 a French-Ottoman fleet attacked Piombino, but was pushed back. In 1557 the peace treaty reinstated the Appiani, with the exception of Portoferraio, given to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and the area of Orbetello, which became the State of the Presidi under Spanish control. In 1594 the Principality of Piombino was created by Emperor Rudolf II of Habsburg, the first prince being Alessandro Appiani d'Aragona. In 1634 the title was acquired by the Ludovisi, whose member Niccol√≤ I had married Polissena Appiani in 1632. In 1708 it went to the Boncompagni with Antonio I. In 1801 Napoleon abolished the principate, Piombino and its lands being annexed by the Kingdom of Etruria; in 1809 they were given to Napoleon's sister, Elisa Baciocchi. After the Napoleon's final defeat and the congress of Vienna, the state of Piombino was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. It became part of the unified Kingdom of Italy in 1860. =The battle of Piombino= During World War II, in the days that followed the announcement of the Armistice of Cassibile, Piombino was the setting for one of the first episodes of the Italian resistance.Nell'anniversario della battaglia di Piombino, uno storico racconta perch√© la citt√† merita l'onorificenza La medaglia d'oro, dopo 55 anni ¬´Il massimo riconoscimento va concesso per ristabilire la verit√†¬ª On 10 September 1943, during Operation Achse, a small German flotilla, commanded by Kapit√§nleutnant Karl-Wolf Albrand, tried to enter the harbour of Piombino but was denied access by the port authorities. General Cesare Maria De Vecchi, in command of the Italian coastal forces (and a former Fascist Gerarca), commanded the port authorities to allow the German flotilla to enter, against the advice of Commander Amedeo Capuano, the Naval commander of the harbour.Piombino citt√† di eroi8 settembre ‚Äô43: la breve illusione di pace Once they entered and landed, the German forces showed a hostile behaviour, and it became clear that their intent was to occupy the town; the local population asked for a resolved reaction by the Italian forces, threatening an insurrection, but the senior Italian commander, general Fortunato Perni, instead ordered his tanks to open fire on the civilians, to disperse the crowds; De Vecchi forbade any action against the Germans. This however did not stop the protests; some junior officers, acting on their own initiative and against the orders (Perni and De Vecchi even tried to dismiss them for this), assumed command and started distributing weapons to the population, and civilian volunteers joined the Italian sailors and soldiers in the defense.55¬∞ della Battaglia di Piombino Battle broke out at 21:15 on 10 September, between the German landing forces (who aimed to occupy the town centre) and the Italian coastal batteries, tanks, and civilian population.

Recreational disciplines include cross-country skiing and Telemark skiing. Olympic events are competitive cross-country skiing, ski jumping, biathlon and Nordic combined‚Äîcompetition in which athletes both cross-country ski and ski jump. The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships host these sports, plus Telemark skiing, at the championship level in the winter of every odd- numbered year. Biathlon combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting, but is not included as a Nordic discipline under the rules of the International Ski Federation (FIS). Instead, it comes under the jurisdiction of the International Biathlon Union. The biomechanics of competitive cross-country skiing and ski jumping have been the subject of serious study. Cross-country skiing requires strength and endurance and ski jumping requires aerodynamic efficiency, both of which requirements translate into specific skills to be optimized in training and competition.  Origins  Recreational skiing began with organized skiing exercises and races of the Norwegian and Swedish infantries. Military races and exercises included downhill in rough terrain, target practice while skiing downhill, and 3 km cross-country skiing with full military backpack.Bergsland, Einar (1946): P√• ski. Oslo: Aschehoug. Slalom (Norwegian: slal√•m) is a word of Norwegian origin that has entered the international skiing vocabulary. In the 1800s skiers in Telemark challenged each other on \\"wild slopes\\" (ville l√•mir), more gentle slopes had the adjective \\"sla\\". Some races were on \\"bumpy courses\\" (kneikel√•m) and sometimes included \\"steep jumps\\" (spr√∏ytehopp) for difficulty. These 19th century races in Telemark ran along particularly difficult trails usually from a steep mountain, along timber-slides and ended with a sharp turn (\\"Telemark turn\\") on a field or icy lake.B√∏, Olav (1993). Skiing throughout history. Oslo: Samlaget. .  Venues  Noted Nordic skiing resorts around the world include the following: * Devils Thumb Ranch is consistently ranked one of the top cross country ski resorts in all of North America. Located in the mountains of Colorado, the terrain is perfect for a cross country skiing and alpine skiing. * The Maine Huts & Trails is a non profit in the high peaks region in Maine. Here you can bike, hike, swim, fish, bird watch, snow shoe and Nordic ski. The Nordic skiing trails spans over 50 miles, are well groomed and offer a beautiful view of the backcountry of the North East. * Trapp Family Lodge, named after the Von Trapp family from the sound of music is a lodge in Vermont with an Austrian aesthetic. At their Nordic center, you can pick up skis and explore the 62 miles of cross country skiing. The lodge was the first cross country skiing resort in the country and the lodge sits on 37 miles of land. * Peer Gynt Trail in Norway is challenging, yet still enjoyable for cross country skiers of all ages. It is 80 km long and you will see the Jotunheimen, Rondane and Dovrefjell national parks as you take the trek through Peer Gynt Country. There are hotels to stay at during your journey because the trail will take around 7 days to complete. * Cirque du Gavarnie in France is not knows for its diversity of cross country skiing trails but it is known to have some of the most beautiful. Come for cheap entry fees and stay for the iconic views and the mostly open trails. * Ammassalik Island is an island in East Greenland that is known for its hiking in the summer and its deep snowfall in the winter which makes excellent Nordic skiing conditions. On the island there are tour operators that partner with guides to offers tourists a multi day cross country trip on the island. To ensure your safety dog sleds and snow mobiles will be patrolling the trails. The trails do not disappoint and the rest stops have astonishing views of the chilly north. * Yll√§s Ski Resort in Finland is definitely one of the bigger areas to go cross country skiing with 330 km of man made trials. 38 km of which are illuminated so after dark skiing excursions are a possibility. At the resort they have many restaurants as well as a petting zoo which makes quite a memorable stop on a cross-country trip through an already gorgeous terrain.

Chat messages are generally short in order to enable other participants to respond quickly. Thereby, a feeling similar to a spoken conversation is created, which distinguishes chatting from other text-based online communication forms such as Internet forums and email. Online chat may address point-to-point communications as well as multicast communications from one sender to many receivers and voice and video chat, or may be a feature of a web conferencing service. Online chat in a less stringent definition may be primarily any direct text-based or video-based (webcams), one-on-one chat or one-to-many group chat (formally also known as synchronous conferencing), using tools such as instant messengers, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), talkers and possibly MUDs. The expression online chat comes from the word chat which means \\"informal conversation\\". Online chat includes web-based applications that allow communication ‚Äì often directly addressed, but anonymous between users in a multi-user environment. Web conferencing is a more specific online service, that is often sold as a service, hosted on a web server controlled by the vendor.  History  The first online chat system was called Talkomatic, created by Doug Brown and David R. Woolley in 1973 on the PLATO System at the University of Illinois. It offered several channels, each of which could accommodate up to five people, with messages appearing on all users' screens character-by-character as they were typed. Talkomatic was very popular among PLATO users into the mid-1980s. In 2014, Brown and Woolley released a web- based version of Talkomatic. The first online system to use the actual command \\"chat\\" was created for The Source in 1979 by Tom Walker and Fritz Thane of Dialcom, Inc. Other chat platforms flourished during the 1980s. Among the earliest with a GUI was BroadCast, a Macintosh extension that became especially popular on university campuses in America and Germany. The first transatlantic Internet chat took place between Oulu, Finland and Corvallis, Oregon in February 1989. The first dedicated online chat service that was widely available to the public was the CompuServe CB Simulator in 1980, created by CompuServe executive Alexander \\"Sandy\\" Trevor in Columbus, Ohio. Ancestors include network chat software such as UNIX \\"talk\\" used in the 1970s.  Chatiquette  The term chatiquette (chat etiquette) is a variation of netiquette (Internet etiquette) and describes basic rules of online communication. These conventions or guidelines have been created to avoid misunderstandings and to simplify the communication between users. Chatiquette varies from community to community and generally describes basic courtesy. As an example, it is considered rude to write only in upper case, because it appears as if the user is shouting. The word \\"chatiquette\\" has been used in connection with various chat systems (e.g. Internet Relay Chat) since 1995. Chatrooms can produce a strong sense of online identity leading to impression of subculture. Chats are valuable sources of various types of information, the automatic processing of which is the object of chat/text mining technologies.  Social criticism  Criticism of online chatting and text messaging include concern that they replace proper English with shorthand or with an almost completely new hybrid language. Writing is changing as it takes on some of the functions and features of speech. Internet chat rooms and rapid real-time teleconferencing allow users to interact with whoever happens to coexist in cyberspace. These virtual interactions involve us in 'talking' more freely and more widely than ever before. With chatrooms replacing many face-to-face conversations, it is necessary to be able to have quick conversation as if the person were present, so many people learn to type as quickly as they would normally speak. Some critics are wary that this casual form of speech is being used so much that it will slowly take over common grammar; however, such a change has yet to be seen. With the increasing population of online chatrooms there has been a massive growth of new words created or slang words, many of them documented on the website Urban Dictionary.

History Stone commemorating the murder of an unknown sailor on Hindhead Common This area was notorious for highwaymen. In 1736, Stephen Phillips, a robber tried and convicted at the Old Bailey, admitted to the Newgate chaplain to having stolen 150 guineas in gold on the road towards London. In 1786, three men were convicted of the murder of an unknown sailor on his way from London to rejoin his ship, a deed commemorated by several memorials in the area. The perpetrators were hung in chains to warn others on Gibbet Hill, a short walk away on top of the Devil's Punch Bowl. With an increase in traffic and opening of the London to Portsmouth railway line removing much of the road transport of freight, such incidents reduced during the 19th century.Proceedings of the Old Bailey.

Blackdown Press Hindhead became a substantial settlement in the late 19th century. In 1904 a temporary mission church was built to serve the new community. An architectural competition to design a permanent church, that of St Albans in Beacon Hill, was held in 1906, and John Duke Coleridge (1879-1934) was chosen as the architect. The first phase, comprising the chancel, north chapel, transept and the lower stage of a projected bell tower, was completed by 1907, and the church gained its own parish in the same year. A series of windows by the Arts and Crafts designers Karl Parsons and Christopher Whall were installed in the unfinished church between 1908 and 1912. The three eastern bays of the nave were consecrated in 1915, but the two western bays were not built until 1929-31; the bell-tower was never completed and became in effect a south transept. There followed two additional stained- glass windows: by Christopher Webb in 1945 and by Francis Skeat in 1950. A large vestry extension was added in 1964. A fire in 1999 destroyed the original high altar and reredos paintings. Notable people Undershaw in Conan Doyle's day * Grant Allen (1848‚Äì1899), the Canadian-born novelist, lived at \\"Hilltop\\".

Afterwards, he was the Legitimist pretender to the throne of France from 1844 until his death in 1883. Henri was the only son of Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry, born after his father's death. The Duke was the younger son of Charles X of France, by his wife, Princess Carolina of Naples and Sicily, daughter of King Francis I of the Two Sicilies. As the grandson of Charles X, Henri was a . He was the last legitimate descendant in the senior male line of Louis XV of France. Early life Duchess of Berry presents her son Henri, Duke of Bordeaux, to the French court and Royal Family. Henri d'Artois was born on 29 September 1820, in the Pavillon de Marsan, a portion of the Tuileries Palace that still survives in the compound of the Louvre Palace in Paris. His father, the duc de Berry, had been assassinated seven months before his birth. At birth, Henri was given the title of duc de Bordeaux. Because of his birth after his father's death, when the senior male line of the House of Bourbon was on the verge of extinction, one of his middle names wasDieudonn√©, (French for \\"God- given\\"). Royalists called him \\"the miracle child\\". Louis XVIII was overjoyed, bestowing 35 royal orders to mark the occasion. Henri's birth was a major setback for Duke of Orleans' ambitions to ascend the French throne. During his customary visit to congratulate the newborn's mother, the duke made such offensive remarks about the baby's appearance that the lady holding him was brought to tears.

On 2 August 1830, in response to the July Revolution, Henri's grandfather, Charles X, abdicated, and twenty minutes later Charles' elder son Louis Antoine, duc d'Angoul√™me, himself renounced his rights, in favour of the young duc de Bordeaux. Charles X urged his cousin Louis Philippe of Orl√©ans, as Lieutenant g√©n√©ral du royaume, to proclaim Henri as Henry V, King of France. Louis Philippe requested the duc de Bordeaux to be brought in Paris to have his rights recognized. The duchess of Berry was denied to escort her son, therefore both the grandfather and the mother refused to leave the child in France.GARNIER, J. (1968). LOUIS-PHILIPPE ET LE DUC DE BORDEAUX (avec des documents in√©dits). Revue Des Deux Mondes (1829-1971), 38-52. Retrieved May 26, 2020, from www.jstor.org/stable/44593301 As a consequence, after seven days, a period in which legitimist monarchists considered that Henri had been the rightful monarch of France, the National Assembly decreed that the throne should pass to Louis Philippe, who was proclaimed King of the French on 9 August. Henri and his family left France and went into exile on 16 August 1830. While some French monarchists recognized him as their sovereign, others disputed the validity of the abdications of his grandfather and of his uncle. Still others recognised the July Monarchy of Louis Philippe. With the death of his 79-year-old grandfather in 1836 and of his uncle in 1844, young Henri became the genealogically senior claimant to the French throne. His supporters were called Legitimists to distinguish them from the Orl√©anists, the supporters of the family of Louis Philippe. Henri, who preferred the courtesy title of comte de Chambord (from the ch√¢teau de Chambord, which had been presented to him by the Restoration government, and which was the only significant piece of personal property of which he was allowed to retain ownership upon his exile), continued his claim to the throne throughout the July Monarchy of Louis Philippe, the Second Republic, the Second Empire of Napol√©on III, and the Third Republic. In November 1846, the comte de Chambord married his second cousin Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este, daughter of Duke Francis IV of Modena and Princess Maria Beatrice of Savoy. The couple had no children. Hope Plaque, at the ch√¢teau de Chambord, of the 5 July 1871 declaration, known as d√©claration du drapeau blanc, by Henri, comte de Chambord (Henri V). tricolore with the royal crown and fleur-de-lys was possibly designed by the count in his younger years as a compromise In the early 1870s, as the Second Empire collapsed following its defeat in the Franco-Prussian War at the battle of Sedan on 1 September 1870, the royalists became a majority in the National Assembly. The Orl√©anists agreed to support the aging comte de Chambord's claim to the throne, with the expectation that at his childless death he would be succeeded by their own claimant, Philippe d'Orl√©ans, comte de Paris. Henri was then pretender for both Legitimists and Orl√©anists, and the restoration of monarchy in France seemed a close possibility. However, Henri insisted that he would accept the crown only on condition that France abandon its tricolour flag and return to the use of the white fleur de lys flag.D. W. Brogan, The Development of Modern France (1870-1939) (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1945), pp. 83-84. He rejected a compromise, whereby the fleur-de-lys would be the new king's personal standard, and the tricolour would remain the national flag. Defeat A temporary Third Republic was established, to wait for Henri's death and his replacement by the more liberal Comte de Paris. By the time this occurred in 1883, public opinion had however swung behind the Republic as the form of government which, in the words of the former President Adolphe Thiers, \\"divides us least\\". Thus, Henri could be mockingly hailed by republicans such as Georges Clemenceau as \\"the French Washington\\" ‚Äî the one man without whom the Republic could not have been founded. Henri died on 24 August 1883 at his residence in Frohsdorf, Austria, at the age of sixty-two, bringing the Louis XV male-only line to an end. He was buried in his grandfather Charles X's crypt in the church of the Franciscan Kostanjevica Monastery in Gorizia, then Austria, now in Slovenian city of Nova Gorica. His personal property, including the ch√¢teau de Chambord, was left to his nephew, Robert I, Duke of Parma (son of Henri's late sister). Henri's death left the Legitimist line of succession distinctly confused. On one hand, Henri himself had accepted that the head of the Maison de France (as distinguished from the Maison de Bourbon) would be the head of the Orl√©ans line, i.e. the Comte de Paris. This was accepted by many Legitimists, and was the default on legal grounds; the only surviving Bourbon line more senior was the Spanish branch, which had renounced its right to inherit the throne of France as a condition of the Treaty of Utrecht. However, many if not most of Henri's supporters, including his widow, chose to disregard his statements and this law, arguing that no one had the right to deny to the senior direct-male-line male Bourbon to be the head of the Maison de France and thus the legitimate King of France; the renunciation of the Spanish branch is under this interpretation illegitimate and therefore void. Thus these Legitimists settled on Juan, Count of Montiz√≥n, the Carlist pretender to the Spanish throne (the Salic law having been suspended in Spain, the actual king, Alfonso XII, was not the senior descendant in the male line), as their claimant to the French crown.

Retrieved 2018-09-05. = Patrilineal descent = Henri's patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son. Patrilineal descent is the principle behind membership in royal houses, as it can be traced back through the generations - which means that if Henri were to choose an historically accurate house name it would be Robertian, as all his male-line ancestors have been of that house. Henri is a member of the House of Bourbon, a branch of the Capetian dynasty and of the Robertians. Henri's patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son. It follows the Bourbon, Kings of France, and the Counts of Paris and Worms. This line can be traced back more than 1,200 years from Robert of Hesbaye to the present day, through Kings of France & Navarre, Spain and Two-Sicilies, Dukes of Parma and Grand-Dukes of Luxembourg, Princes of Orl√©ans and Emperors of Brazil. It is one of the oldest in Europe. # Robert II of Worms and Rheingau (Robert of Hesbaye), 770‚Äì807 # Robert III of Worms and Rheingau, 808‚Äì834 # Robert IV the Strong, 820‚Äì866 # Robert I of France, 866‚Äì923 # Hugh the Great, 895‚Äì956 # Hugh Capet, 941‚Äì996 # Robert II of France, 972‚Äì1031 # Henry I of France, 1008‚Äì1060 # Philip I of France, 1053‚Äì1108 # Louis VI of France, 1081‚Äì1137 # Louis VII of France, 1120‚Äì1180 # Philip II of France, 1165‚Äì1223 # Louis VIII of France, 1187‚Äì1226 # Louis IX of France, 1215‚Äì1270 # Robert, Count of Clermont, 1256‚Äì1317 # Louis I, Duke of Bourbon, 1279‚Äì1342 # James I, Count of La Marche, 1319‚Äì1362 # John I, Count of La Marche, 1344‚Äì1393 # Louis, Count of Vend√¥me, 1376‚Äì1446 # Jean VIII, Count of Vend√¥me, 1428‚Äì1478 # Fran√ßois, Count of Vend√¥me, 1470‚Äì1495 # Charles de Bourbon, Duke of Vend√¥me, 1489‚Äì1537 # Antoine, King of Navarre, Duke of Vend√¥me, 1518‚Äì1562 # Henry IV, King of France and of Navarre, 1553‚Äì1610 # Louis XIII, King of France and Navarre, 1601‚Äì1643 # Louis XIV, King of France and Navarre, 1638‚Äì1715 # Louis, Grand Dauphin of France, 1661‚Äì1711 # Louis, Duke of Burgundy, Petit Dauphin of France, 1682‚Äì1712 # Louis XV, King of France and Navarre, 1710‚Äì1774 # Louis, Dauphin of France, 1729‚Äì1765 # Charles X of France and Navarre, 1757‚Äì1836 # Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry, 1778‚Äì1820 # Henri, Count of Chambord, 1820‚Äì1883 See also * List of shortest-reigning monarchs Footnotes Further reading * Brown, Marvin Luther.

With the narrow strip parish of Little Bookham, it forms part of the Saxon settlement of Bocham (\\"the village by the beeches\\"). The Bookhams are surrounded by common land, and Bookham railway station in Church Road, Great Bookham, serves both settlements. The villages are astride the A246, which is the non-motorway and direct route between the two towns. Once two distinct villages, the Bookhams have long been interconnected with residential roads that give the impression of one large village. On the southern edge of the village is Polesden Lacey, a country house surrounded by more than of grounds. It is owned by the National Trust and open to the public. History According to a charter c.675, the original of which is lost but which exists in a later form, there were granted to the Abbey twenty dwellings at Bocham cum Effingham. This was confirmed by four Saxon kings; King Offa of Mercia and of the nations roundabout in 787; King Athelstan who was \\"King and ruler of the whole island of Britain\\" in 933 confirmed the privileges to the monastery; King Edgar, \\"Emperor of all Britain\\" in 967 confirmed \\"twelve mansiones\\" in Bocham, and King Edward the Confessor, King of the English, in 1062 confirmed twenty mansae at Bocham cum Effingham, Driteham and Pechingeorde. Great Bookham lay within the Anglo-Saxon administrative district of Effingham half hundred. The Domesday Book 1086, which was a survey for taxation purposes, makes the first known distinction between the parishes of Great and Little Bookham, if it is assumed that there was no separate parish at the time of the charter of Edward the Confessor in 1062. Driteham and Pechingeorde are both referred to in the Domesday Book and appear to have been absorbed into the manors of Effingham and Effingham East Court. Great Bookham appears in Domesday Book as Bocheham.St Nicolas church history It was held by St Peter's Abbey, Chertsey. Its Domesday Assets were: 13 hides; 1 church, 1 mill worth 10s, 20 ploughs, of meadow, woodland and herbage worth 110 hogs. It rendered (in total): ¬£15. It seems probable, as the number of cottages in Bookham and Effingham remained constant, that the later charters must have been copies of earlier charters which were not revised to accord with the actual number of cottages at any one time. Jane Austen, whose godfather and cousin Rev. Samuel Cooke was vicar of Great Bookham (1769-1820), is said to have spent time in Bookham whilst writing several of her novels in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Its location is consistent with the geographical details in Emma.Surrey writers C. S. Lewis studied privately with William T. Kirkpatrick in Great Bookham between September 1914 and April 1917. Pink Floyd bass player and singer Roger Waters was born in Great Bookham in 1943. Polesden Lacey Polesden Lacey A regency villa on the southern edge of the village, Polesden Lacey has been the site of a house since at least 1336. The current house dates from the 17th century, and was bequeathed by its last owner, the Hon. Mrs Greville, a legendary Edwardian hostess, to the National Trust in 1942. When the Grevilles purchased the property in 1906, they extensively remodelled the house with the help of Mewes and Davis, architects of the Ritz Hotel, London. There are large walled and formal gardens, an orchard and croquet lawn, as well as extensive farmland. The property and its estate are open to the public, and is one of the National Trust's most visited properties. The house is also the National Trust's Southern Region head office. The future King George VI and his bride spent part of their honeymoon at Polesden Lacey, as guests of Mrs Greville. The poet and playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan was a previous owner of the property from 1804. Bookham Grove Bookham Grove House To the south side of the High Street stands Bookham Grove Manor, built in the early 18th century, once owned by the Dawnay family. It is now converted into apartments, with coach houses built in its now grounds. The manor's original large estate covered the surrounding roads up to Dorking Road, and Groveside, and had grounds to the front, running down to the Guildford Road. When the land was sold for development in 1947, the shops and car park were built in the grounds to the front of the house. Another surviving part of the estate is the stables, on the corner of Dorking Road. Eastwick Park Eastwick Park 1904 Eastwick Park, a beautiful manor in the village, was lost in 1958. The house stood within the area of roads now known as the 'Eastwick area', and its very large private estate included Great Bookham Commons, which were saved by the village and given to the National Trust. After ceasing to be used as a private house, the manor was used by the Canadian military in World War II, and was also a school called Southey Hall, before being demolished for redevelopment. The original gates to the house stand just west of Eastwick Park Avenue on Lower Road. Geography To the west of the Bookhams lies the village of Effingham; further west on the road to Guildford lie the similar villages of East and West Horsley and East and West Clandon. To the north-east lie Fetcham and Leatherhead, north of which the area becomes increasingly urban heading towards central London, which is only away. To the south-east, across the North Downs, are the village of Westhumble and the market town of Dorking. Today The village has a short high street at its centre, which has two butchers, a family-run fishmongers and two traditional greengrocers. The beautiful Rayleigh House at the top of the high street, originally built as the Victoria Temperance Hotel by Mary Chrystie, now contains Henshaws Estate Agents and a healthcare practice. Three public houses are in Great Bookham: The Anchor, The Royal Oak, The Old Crown and one in Little Bookham, Ye Olde Windsor Castle. A loose association with the latter is that the Ranger of Windsor Great Park was often appointed from the area by King Henry VIII which was more than five times larger, stretching as far as Guildford. The Old Barn Hall is the main community centre, regularly used for staging amateur dramatics productions and hosting parties and receptions. There are two successful primary schools in the village, which makes the area sought after with families: Eastwick Junior School in Eastwick Drive and The Dawnay School in Griffin Way. There are three infant schools in Great Bookham: the Polesden Lacey School in Oakfield Close, Eastwick Infant School in Eastwick Drive, and The Dawnay Infant School in Griffin Way. Sport and leisure Great Bookham has a Non-League football club Bookham F.C. who play at the Chrystie Recreation Ground in the Surrey Elite Intermediate Football League. The club was founded before the First World War.Bookham football club history Bookham Commons Bookham Commons includes the two commons in Great Bookham and Little Bookham. Great Bookham Common was bought by local residents in 1923 to save the oak woodlands, then given to the National Trust. Little Bookham Common was given to the Trust in 1924 by Mr H. Willock-Pollen, then Banks Common in 1925 by Mr R. Calburn. The London Natural History Society has been surveying Bookham Commons for more than fifty years, making it one of the best recorded sites for wildlife in southeast England. The common land consist of grassland (wet, low-lying meadows), woodland, scrub and twelve ponds. The ponds are home to all three British species of newt, including the rare Great Crested Newt. The five largest ponds are man-made, formed for fish production in the 17th century. Emergency services Great Bookham is served by these emergency services: * Surrey Police. Leatherhead Police Station is only used for minor issues now; everything else is handled from Dorking Police Station. * South East Coast Ambulance Service as of 1 July 2006, is the local NHS Ambulance Services Trust. The Surrey Ambulance Service, Sussex, and Kent Ambulance services have all merged, and have now ceased to exist. * Surrey Fire & Rescue Service, Actually in Fetcham, but called Leatherhead Fire Station. ** 1 x Water tender ladder ** 1 x Water carrier See also *List of places of worship in Mole Valley References External links *Bookham Community Association *Old photo Villages in Surrey Mole Valley ","title":"Great Bookham"},{"id":"174511","text":"Robert Burton (8 February 1577 ‚Äì 25 January 1640) was an English scholar and author, whose best-known work is The Anatomy of Melancholy, first published in 1621. From a comfortably-off family, Burton attended Brasenose College, Oxford, and then Christ Church Oxford, where he settled after graduating and remained as a fellow (called a \\"student\\") for the rest of his life. He was ordained as an Anglican priest and was the incumbent of St Thomas the Martyr, Oxford, and also, later, of Walesby, Lincolnshire and then Seagrave in Leicestershire. Burton suffered all his life from depression and The Anatomy of Melancholy was an eclectic treatise on the subject. It was an immediate success and four new editions were published between 1624 and 1638, with additional material. Among the later writers who found inspiration in the book were Samuel Johnson, Laurence Sterne, John Keats and Samuel Beckett.  Early years  Burton was born at Lindley Hall, Leicestershire, the fourth child and second son of the nine children of Ralph Burton (1547‚Äì1619) and his wife, Dorothy, n√©e Faunt (1560‚Äì1629).O'Connell, pp. 3‚Äì4 His elder brother was the antiquary William Burton.Bamborough, J. B. \\"Burton, Robert (1577‚Äì1640), writer\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Retrieved 6 October 2020 Burton attended two grammar schools, one at Nuneaton and one at Sutton Coldfield.Gowland, p. 5 Like other 16th-century scholars including Roger Ascham, he formed a low opinion of schoolmasters, finding them better at beating than at teaching.O'Connell, pp. 6‚Äì7 From school he progressed to the University of Oxford, first at Brasenose College, at which he matriculated in 1593, at the age of sixteen. It is not certain that he began his studies immediately, but his undergraduate years were abnormally long: he did not receive his Bachelor of Arts degree until 1602, nine years after he came to the university. Scholars including Burton's biographers Michael O'Connell and John Bamborough, and Julie Sanders think it probable that his studies were interrupted by depression.  Christ Church  In 1599, before he graduated, Burton was appointed as a student ‚Äì the equivalent of a fellow at other Oxford colleges ‚Äì of Christ Church. He remained there for the rest of his life; he wrote of himself, \\"I have lived a silent, sedentary, solitary, private life ‚Ä¶ penned up most part in my study. I have no wife nor children good or bad to provide for ‚Ä¶ I never travelled but in map or card\\".Quoted in Brownlee, p. 4 Latin was the prevailing academic language, and Burton was at ease in it, although his Latin verse was not regarded by his contemporaries as outstanding.O'Connell, p. 100 In 1603 he contributed a Latin poem to an Oxford collection celebrating King James I's accession to the English throne. In 1605, shortly after graduating Master of Arts, he contributed to Alba, a Latin play (now lost) performed for King James's visit to Oxford in August. After the royal visit Burton published a Latin poem celebrating it. He continued to publish works in Latin: a poem commemorating the death of the Prince of Wales (1612), a preface for the second edition of a Latin-English dictionary prepared by his friend Francis Holyoke (1612),O'Connell, pp. 102‚Äì103 and poems on the marriage of Princess Elizabeth and the death of Thomas Bodley (1613).O'Connell, p. 104 Burton's coat of arms on the south porch of St Thomas the Martyr's Church, Oxford In May 1614 Burton graduated Bachelor of Divinity. Bamborough observes that this may have been required by the college statutes, and notes that Burton did not proceed further to a Doctorate of Divinity. He remained a student of Christ Church for the rest of his life, but was also active as a priest. In November 1616 the dean and chapter of Christ Church appointed him vicar of St Thomas the Martyr's Church, Oxford.Gowland, p. 6 It was common for vicars to appoint curates to undertake most or all of a parish priests's functions, but Burton did not do so, discharging the duties himself. At a time of religious divisions, with High Church and Puritan Christians favouring different forms of worship within the limits permitted by the Church of England, Burton was seen as leaning towards the former. He gave his parishioners the sacrament in communion wafers, rather than bread ‚Äì a noted High Church practice.Gowland, p. 172 But he was not drawn to religious controversy, and once he had gained his Bachelor of Divinity degree he did not pursue studies in divinity, which he felt led to unnecessary argument and confrontation, and he \\"saw no such great neede\\" for him to join in.Quoted in Bamborough, ODNB At the time, an interest in astrology was not seen as incompatible with Christian religious belief, and like many of his contemporaries and near contemporaries,Dawson, pp. 32, 41, and 48 Burton devoted much time to the study of the subject. His personal library, comprising at least 1,700 books ‚Äì more than ten times as many as a typical Oxford don of that era ‚Äì contained many astrological works.O‚ÄôConnell, pp. 15‚Äì17 For three years, from 1615, Burton served as one of the two clerks of the market, a university post overseeing the conduct of trading in the city‚Äôs market and guarding the interests of members of the university in their dealings with the traders of Oxford. O‚ÄôConnell comments, \\"A Burton acquainted with the marketing practices of the fishmongers and brewers of Oxford suggests a worldliness at some variance with his self-portrait in the Anatomy of a scholar mewed up with his books\\".O'Connell, p. 20 In 1617 his Latin play Philosophaster was performed.Gowland, pp. 6‚Äì7 It is a comedy, set in a fictional Spanish university with striking resemblances to the real Oxford. He had worked on it since 1606, and it may or may not have been influenced by Ben Jonson's 1610 play The Alchemist.O'Connell, p. 93 A. H. Bullen, a specialist in Elizabethan drama, wrote of it:  The Anatomy of Melancholy  alt=17th century book page Bamborough regards Philosophaster (\\"a cross between an academic drama and a comedy of humours\\") as \\"not without genuine merit\\", but he regards Burton's one great work as The Anatomy of Melancholy. Ostensibly a three-part treatise on depression and its treatment, the book consists of quotations from, paraphrases of and commentary on numerous authors, in many fields of learning, ranging from classical times to his contemporaries.Birch, Dinah (ed). \\"Anatomy of Melancholy, The\\", The Oxford Companion to English Literature, Oxford University Press, 2009. Retrieved 9 October 2020 It was first published in 1621 and, as Burton revised and expanded it, there were new editions in 1624, 1628, 1632 and 1638. A sixth edition, corrected and \\"with severall considerable Additions\\" made by Burton in his last years and published posthumously in 1651, was 163,000 words longer than the original 353,369-word 1621 version. Burton wrote The Anatomy of Melancholy largely to write himself out of being a lifelong sufferer from depression. As he described his condition in the preface \\"Democritus Junior to the Reader\\", \\"a kind of imposthume in my head, which I was very desirous to be unladen of and could imagine no fitter evacuation than this ‚Ä¶ I write of melancholy, by being busy to avoid melancholy. There is no greater cause of melancholy than idleness, no better cure than business\\".Burton, pp. 17 and 18 In his view, melancholy was \\"a disease so frequent ... in our miserable times, as few there are that feele not the smart of it\\", and he said he compiled his book \\"to prescribe means how to prevent and cure so universall a malady, an Epidemicall disease, that so often, so much crucifies the body and mind\\".Gowland, p. 77 The book has been described as \\"an enyclopedia\\", \\"a commonplace book\\", \\"a mine of quotations\\", \\"a medical manual\\", \\"a self-help book\\", \\"one of the messiest books ever written\\",Sanders, Julie. \\"The Anatomy of Melancholy\\", In Our Time, BBC.

Authors who drew from it or admired it included Samuel Johnson, Laurence Sterne, John Keats and Samuel Beckett: Johnson said it was the only book that ever took him out of bed two hours sooner than he wished to rise,Boswell, p. 173 Sterne drew extensively from the book in Tristram Shandy,Overton, p. 88 Keats drew on it, for his Lamia,Twitchell, p. 49 as did Beckett in his first novel Murphy and other works throughout his career.Murphy et al, p. 63  Later years  In 1624 Burton received the living the parish of Walesby, Lincolnshire from the Dowager Countess of Exeter. He did not perform the ecclesiastical duties in this second parish, but employed a curate. In the same year he received the advowson of the parish of Seagrave in Leicestershire from Lord Berkeley, the dedicatee of The Anatomy of Melancholy, who may have been a former student of his at Christ Church. The advowson gave Burton the right to name a successor to the existing incumbent when the post became vacant. As a holder of an advowson was unable to nominate himself, Burton transferred it to his brothers and a cousin, who duly appointed him rector when the old incumbent died in 1632.O'Connell, p. 22 Burton's most prominent university appointment was in 1626, when he became librarian of Christ Church. O'Connell observes, \\"It must have seemed an apt post for the member who most haunted the libraries of Oxford\\". The duties seem to have been congenial and not over-arduous.O'Connell, p. 15 After resigning the living of Walesby at a uncertain date before 1632, Burton became rector of Seagrave. He appointed a curate, but took a more active role in parish affairs than he had at Walesby.O'Connell, pp. 22‚Äì23 In August 1639 Burton drew up his last will and testament, and on 25 January 1640 he died in his rooms at Christ Church; he was buried in the north aisle of Christ Church Cathedral.O'Connell, pp. 30‚Äì31 There was a rumour that he hanged himself in his chambers at Christ Church, so that his death would match his own astrological prediction. Bamborough dismisses the rumour on the grounds that a suicide would not have been buried in consecrated ground, but in a 2006 study of Burton, Gowland does not regard this as conclusive.Gowland, p. 301 Notes, references and sources =Notes= =References= =Sources=   * External links * Review and quotes at Complete Review * Entry at the Columbia Encyclopedia * The BBC's \\"In Our Time\\" discusses The Anatomy of Melancholy. ;Online texts  Alumni of Brasenose College, Oxford Burials at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford 16th-century English medical doctors 17th-century English medical doctors English non-fiction writers Fellows of Christ Church, Oxford People from Lindley, Leicestershire 17th-century English Anglican priests 1577 births 1640 deaths 16th- century English writers 16th-century male writers 17th- century English writers 17th-century male writers English male non-fiction writers ","title":"Robert Burton (scholar)"},{"id":"174512","text":"North Face of the Temple of Masks, E Group Uaxactun Uaxactun (pronounced ) is an ancient sacred place of the Maya civilization, located in the Pet√©n Basin region of the Maya lowlands, in the present-day department of Pet√©n, Guatemala. The site lies some north of the major center of Tikal.Martin & Grube 2000, p. 30. The name is sometimes spelled as Waxaktun. History of discovery With recent achievements in the decipherment of the ancient Maya hieroglyphic writing system, it has been determined that the ancient name for this site translates roughly as Siaan K'aan or \\"Born in Heaven\\". The name Uaxactun was given to the site by its rediscoverer, United States archaeologist Sylvanus Morley, in May 1916. He coined the name from Maya words Waxac and Tun, to mean \\"Eight Stones\\". The name has two meanings; Morley's stated reason for the name was to commemorate it as the first site where an inscription dating from the 8th Bakt√∫n of the Maya calendar was discovered (making it then the earliest known Maya date). The other meaning is a pun, since \\"Uaxactun\\" sounds like \\"Washington\\", the U.S. capital and home of the Carnegie Institute which funded Morley's explorations. Morley's initial investigation of the site mostly focused on the hieroglyphic inscriptions; after that Uaxactun was not visited again until 1924, when Frans Blom made a more detailed investigation of the structures and mapped the site. The Carnegie Institution conducted archeological excavations there from 1926 through 1937, led by Oliver Ricketson. The excavations added greatly to knowledge of the early Classic and pre-Classic Maya. The remains of several badly ruined late Classic era temple-pyramids were removed, revealing well- preserved earlier temples underneath them. View of E Group from the temple of masks at Uaxactun Ballcourt at Uaxactun For most of the Carnegie team's time at Uaxactun, communication with the outside world was via a four-day mule convoy to El Cayo, British Honduras. Towards the end of the time an airstrip was opened. Flights to Uaxactun continued and a small village grew there, as it became a center for gathering of chicle sap from the Peten jungle. In 1940 A. L. Smith and Ed Shook of the Carnegie project returned to make some additional excavations. In the late 1970s a rough road was opened, connecting Uaxactun to Tikal and thence to Flores, Guatemala. Air flights were discontinued. In 1984 the road was much improved. Shook returned again in 1974 to oversee consolidation and restoration of some architecture excavated earlier. In 1982 Guatemala's Tikal National Park was expanded to include the ruins of Uaxactun within its protected area. In 1990 the Maya Biosphere Reserve (MBR) was created, including Uaxactun as a part of the reserve's Multiple Use Zone. In 2009 an excavation project of Slovak Archaeological and Historical Institute (SAHI) was started by professor Milan Kov√°ƒç.  Conquest of Uaxactun by Siyaj K'ak'  Linda Schele, in A Forest of Kings, devotes an entire chapter to a war between Tikal and Uaxactun, in which Uaxactun was defeated by forces led by Fire is Born (Siyaj K'ak', formerly identified as Smoking Frogibid.) of Tikal. In this chapter, she also gives a brief overview of the known history of Uaxactun up to the final year of the war (378 AD) and of the Uaxactun kings who claimed descent from Fire is Born. The combined political entity of Tikal-Uaxactun dominated the Guatemalan Pet√©n for the following 180 years. Siyaj K'ak' might have come from Teotihuac√°n, been the general of the Teotihuacano ruler Spearthrower Owl, and conquered Tikal earlier the same year. This was a watershed moment of the Classic Maya. Some scholars suggested that new kings were installed at Tikal, Uaxactun, Rio Azul, El Peru, El Zapote and Bejucal during the Teotihuacan intrusions, new rituals and images were introduced, and a new order was established in the Maya Lowlands, while others suggested a less hegemonic role of Teotihuacan in its relationship with the Maya.  After 378 AD  After the conquest by Siyaj K'ak' in 378 AD, Uaxuactun was still able to keep elite prerogatives of monument carving, temple erection, and rich burials during most of the Early Classic era.\\"Polities in the northeast Peten, Guatemala\\" by T. P. Culbert, Classic Maya Political History: Hieroglyphic and Archaeological Evidence, edited by T. P. Culbert. During the Hiatus period (about 600 AD) between Early Classic and Late Classic, Uaxactun experienced a lack of architectural activity and ceramic production, which coincided with the decline of the power of Teotihuac√°n and Tikal. There was no erection of dedicatory monuments between 554 AD and 711 AD. By the middle of Late Classic, Uaxactun showed evidences of population increase, new construction, remodeling of old structures, and appearance of new residential areas, plaza groups, and buildings. There was a time of distinctive population decrease towards the end of Late Classic.Archaeology of Ancient Mexico and Central America: An Encyclopedia edited by S. T. Evans and D. L.

Infrastructure  Define Infrastructure at Dictionary.com including the services and facilities necessary for its economy to function. Infrastructure is composed of public and private physical structures such as roads, railways, bridges, tunnels, water supply, sewers, electrical grids, and telecommunications (including Internet connectivity and broadband access). In general, infrastructure has been defined as \\"the physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and services essential to enable, sustain, or enhance societal living conditions\\". San Francisco Ferry Building at night One way by which to classify types of infrastructure is to view them as two distinct kinds: hard infrastructure and soft infrastructure. Hard infrastructure refers to the physical networks necessary for the functioning of a modern industry. This includes roads, bridges, railways, etc. Soft infrastructure refers to all the institutions that maintain the economic, health, social, and cultural standards of a country. This includes educational programs, official statistics, parks and recreational facilities, law enforcement agencies, and emergency services. The word infrastructure has been used in French since 1875 and in English since 1887, originally meaning \\"The installations that form the basis for any operation or system\\".Online Etymology Dictionary. Douglas Harper, Historian. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/infrastructure (accessed: April 24, 2008) The word was imported from French, where it was already used for establishing a roadbed of substrate material, required before railroad tracks or constructed pavement could be laid on top of it. The word is a combination of the Latin prefix \\"infra\\", meaning \\"below\\", as many of these constructions are underground (for example, tunnels, water and gas systems, and railways), and the French word \\"structure\\" (derived from the Latin word \\"structure\\"). The army use of the term achieved currency in the United States after the formation of NATO in the 1940s, and by 1970 was adopted by urban planners in its modern civilian sense.Stephen Lewis The Ecology of Infrastructure and the Infrastructure of the Internet, blog Hag Pak Sak, posted September 22, 2008. Classifications A 1987 US National Research Council panel adopted the term \\"public works infrastructure\\", referring to: > \\"... both specific functional modes ‚Äì highways, streets, roads, and bridges; > mass transit; airports and airways; water supply and water resources; > wastewater management; solid-waste treatment and disposal; electric power > generation and transmission; telecommunications; and hazardous waste > management ‚Äì and the combined system these modal elements comprise. A > comprehension of infrastructure spans not only these public works > facilities, but also the operating procedures, management practices, and > development policies that interact together with societal demand and the > physical world to facilitate the transport of people and goods, provision of > water for drinking and a variety of other uses, safe disposal of society's > waste products, provision of energy where it is needed, and transmission of > information within and between communities.\\"Infrastructure for the 21st > Century, Washington, D.C.: National Academy WHAT IS THIS Press, 1987. The American Society of Civil Engineers publishes a \\"Infrastructure Report Card\\" which represents the organizations opinion on the condition of various infrastructure every 2‚Äì4 years.2017 Infrastructure Report, 112pp, American Society of Civil Engineers, 2017 they grade 16 categories, namely aviation, bridges, dams, drinking water, energy, hazardous waste, inland waterways, levees, parks and recreation, ports, rail, roads, schools, solid waste, transit and wastewater. = Personal = A way to embody personal infrastructure is to think of it in terms of human capital. Human capital is defined by the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica as ‚Äúintangible collective resources possessed by individuals and groups within a given population\\". The goal of personal infrastructure is to determine the quality of the economic agents‚Äô values. This results in three major tasks: the task of economic proxies in the economic process (teachers, unskilled and qualified labor, etc.); the importance of personal infrastructure for an individual (short and long-term consumption of education); and the social relevance of personal infrastructure. = Institutional = Institutional infrastructure branches from the term \\"economic constitution\\". According to Gianpiero Torrisi, institutional infrastructure is the object of economic and legal policy. It compromises the grown and sets norms. It refers to the degree of actual equal treatment of equal economic data and determines the framework within which economic agents may formulate their own economic plans and carry them out in co-operation with others. = Material = Material infrastructure is defined as ‚Äúthose immobile, non-circulating capital goods that essentially contribute to the production of infrastructure goods and services needed to satisfy basic physical and social requirements of economic agents\\". There are two distinct qualities of material infrastructures: 1) fulfillment of social needs and 2) mass production. The first characteristic deals with the basic needs of human life. The second characteristic is the non-availability of infrastructure goods and services. = Economic = According to the business dictionary, economic infrastructure can be defined as \\"internal facilities of a country that make business activity possible, such as communication, transportation and distribution networks, financial institutions and markets, and energy supply systems\\". Economic infrastructure support productive activities and events. This includes roads, highways, bridges, airports, cycling infrastructure, water distribution networks, sewer systems, irrigation plants, etc. = Social = Social infrastructure can be broadly defined as the construction and maintenance of facilities that support social services. Social infrastructures are created to increase social comfort and act on economic activity. These being schools, parks and playgrounds, structures for public safety, waste disposal plants, hospitals, sports area, etc. = Core = Core assets provide essential services and have monopolistic characteristics. Investors seeking core infrastructure look for five different characteristics: income, low volatility of returns, diversification, inflation protection, and long-term liability matching. Core infrastructure incorporates all the main types of infrastructure, such as roads, highways, railways, public transportation, water and gas supply, etc. = Basic = Basic infrastructure refers to main railways, roads, canals, harbors and docks, the electromagnetic telegraph, drainage, dikes, and land reclamation. It consist of the more well-known features of infrastructure. The things in the world we come across every day (buildings, roads, docks, etc.). = Complementary = Complementary infrastructure refers to things like light railways, tramways, gas/electricity/water supply, etc. To complement something, means to bring to perfection or complete it. So, complementary infrastructure deals with the little parts of the engineering world the bring more life. Basically they are needed to ensure successful usage and marketing of an already finished product, look at the road bridges. The lights on the sidewalks, the landscaping around buildings, the benches for pedestrians to rest, etc. Related concepts The term infrastructure may be confused with the following overlapping or related concepts. Land improvement and land development are general terms that in some contexts may include infrastructure, but in the context of a discussion of infrastructure would refer only to smaller-scale systems or works that are not included in infrastructure, because they are typically limited to a single parcel of land, and are owned and operated by the landowner. For example, an irrigation canal that serves a region or district would be included with infrastructure, but the private irrigation systems on individual land parcels would be considered land improvements, not infrastructure. Service connections to municipal service and public utility networks would also be considered land improvements, not infrastructure.Land improvement, Online BusinessDictionary.com, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/land- development.html (accessed January 31, 2009)Land development, Online BusinessDictionary.com, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/land- development.html (accessed January 31, 2009) The term public works includes government-owned and operated infrastructure as well as public buildings, such as schools and court houses. Public works generally refers to physical assets needed to deliver public services. Public services include both infrastructure and services generally provided by government. Ownership and financing Infrastructure may be owned and managed by governments or by private companies, such as sole public utility or railway companies. Generally, most roads, major airports and other ports, water distribution systems, and sewage networks are publicly owned, whereas most energy and telecommunications networks are privately owned. Publicly owned infrastructure may be paid for from taxes, tolls, or metered user fees, whereas private infrastructure is generally paid for by metered user fees. Major investment projects are generally financed by the issuance of long-term bonds. Government-owned and operated infrastructure may be developed and operated in the private sector or in public-private partnerships, in addition to in the public sector. in the United States for example, public spending on infrastructure has varied between 2.3% and 3.6% of GDP since 1950.The New York Times, \\"Money for Public Projects\\", November 19, 2008 (accessed January 26, 2009) Many financial institutions invest in infrastructure. Types =Engineering and construction= Engineers generally limit the term \\"infrastructure\\" to describe fixed assets that are in the form of a large network; in other words, hard infrastructure. Efforts to devise more generic definitions of infrastructures have typically referred to the network aspects of most of the structures, and to the accumulated value of investments in the networks as assets. One such definition from 1998 defined infrastructure as the network of assets \\"where the system as a whole is intended to be maintained indefinitely at a specified standard of service by the continuing replacement and refurbishment of its components\\".Association of Local Government Engineers New Zealand: \\"Infrastructure Asset Management Manual\\", June 1998. Edition 1.1 =Civil defense and economic development= Civil defense planners and developmental economists generally refer to both hard and soft infrastructure, including public services such as schools and hospitals, emergency services such as police and fire fighting, and basic financial services. The notion of infrastructure-based development combining long-term infrastructure investments by government agencies at central and regional levels with public private partnerships has proven popular among economists in Asia (notably Singapore and China), mainland Europe, and Latin America. =Military= Military infrastructure is the buildings and permanent installations necessary for the support of military forces, whether they are stationed in bases, being deployed or engaged in operations. For example, barracks, headquarters, airfields, communications facilities, stores of military equipment, port installations, and maintenance stations.D.O.D. Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, 2001 (rev. 2005) =Communications= Communications infrastructure is the informal and formal channels of communication, political and social networks, or beliefs held by members of particular groups, as well as information technology, software development tools. Still underlying these more conceptual uses is the idea that infrastructure provides organizing structure and support for the system or organization it serves, whether it is a city, a nation, a corporation, or a collection of people with common interests. Examples include IT infrastructure, research infrastructure, terrorist infrastructure, employment infrastructure and tourism infrastructure. In the developing world According to researchers at the Overseas Development Institute, the lack of infrastructure in many developing countries represents one of the most significant limitations to economic growth and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Infrastructure investments and maintenance can be very expensive, especially in such areas as landlocked, rural and sparsely populated countries in Africa. It has been argued that infrastructure investments contributed to more than half of Africa's improved growth performance between 1990 and 2005, and increased investment is necessary to maintain growth and tackle poverty. The returns to investment in infrastructure are very significant, with on average thirty to forty percent returns for telecommunications (ICT) investments, over forty percent for electricity generation, and eighty percent for roads.Christian K.M. Kingombe 2011. Mapping the new infrastructure financing landscape. London: Overseas Development Institute =Regional differences= The demand for infrastructure, both by consumers and by companies is much higher than the amount invested. There are severe constraints on the supply side of the provision of infrastructure in Asia.Peter McCawley (2010), 'Infrastructure Policy in Developing countries' , Asian-Pacific Economic Literature, 24(1), May. See also Asian-Pacific Economic Literature Policy Brief No 19, May 2010, on 'Infrastructure policy in developing countries in Asia'. The infrastructure financing gap between what is invested in Asia- Pacific (around US$48 billion) and what is needed (US$228 billion) is around US$180 billion every year. In Latin America, three percent of GDP (around US$71 billion) would need to be invested in infrastructure in order to satisfy demand, yet in 2005, for example, only around two percent was invested leaving a financing gap of approximately US$24 billion. In Africa, in order to reach the seven percent annual growth calculated to be required to meet the MDGs by 2015 would require infrastructure investments of about fifteen percent of GDP, or around US$93 billion a year. In fragile states, over thirty-seven percent of GDP would be required. =Sources of funding= The source of financing varies significantly across sectors. Some sectors are dominated by government spending, others by overseas development aid (ODA), and yet others by private investors. In California, infrastructure financing districts are established by local governments to pay for physical facilities and services within a specified area by using property tax increases. In order to facilitate investment of the private sector in developing countries' infrastructure markets, it is necessary to design risk-allocation mechanisms more carefully, given the higher risks of their markets.Koh, Jae Myong (2018) Green Infrastructure Financing: Institutional Investors, PPPs and Bankable Projects, Palgrave Macmillan. The spending money that comes from the government is less than it used to be. Compared to the global GDP percentages, The United States is tied for second-to-last place, with an average percentage of 2.4%. This means that the government spends less money on repairing old infrastructure and or on infrastructure as a whole. In Sub-Saharan Africa, governments spend around US$9.4 billion out of a total of US$24.9 billion. In irrigation, governments represent almost all spending. In transport and energy a majority of investment is government spending. In ICT and water supply and sanitation, the private sector represents the majority of capital expenditure. Overall, between them aid, the private sector, and non-OECD financiers exceed government spending. The private sector spending alone equals state capital expenditure, though the majority is focused on ICT infrastructure investments. External financing increased in the 2000s (decade) and in Africa alone external infrastructure investments increased from US$7 billion in 2002 to US$27 billion in 2009. China, in particular, has emerged as an important investor.

In Three Maine Partitions with their several Sections, Members, and Subsections. Philosophically, Medicinally, Historically, Opened and Cut Up) is a book by Robert Burton, first published in 1621, but republished five more times over the next seventeen years with massive alterations and expansions.  Overview  On its surface, the book is presented as a medical textbook in which Burton applies his vast and varied learning, in the scholastic manner, to the subject of melancholia (which includes, although it is not limited to, what is now termed clinical depression). Although presented as a medical text, The Anatomy of Melancholy is as much a sui generis work of literature as it is a scientific or philosophical text, and Burton addresses far more than his stated subject. In fact, the Anatomy uses melancholy as the lens through which all human emotion and thought may be scrutinized, and virtually the entire contents of a 17th-century library are marshalled into service of this goal. It is encyclopedic in its range and reference. In his satirical preface to the reader, Burton's persona and pseudonym \\"Democritus Junior\\" explains, \\"I write of melancholy by being busy to avoid melancholy.\\" This is characteristic of the author's style, which often supersedes the book's strengths as a medical text or historical document as its main source of appeal to admirers. Both satirical and serious in tone, the Anatomy is \\"vitalized by (Burton's) pervading humour\\",√âmile Legouis, A History of English Literature (1926) and Burton's digressive and inclusive style, often verging on a stream of consciousness, consistently informs and animates the text. In addition to the author's techniques, the Anatomys vast breadth ‚Äì addressing topics such as digestion, goblins, the geography of America, and others ‚Äì make it a valuable contribution to multiple research disciplines.  Publication  Burton was an obsessive rewriter of his work and published five revised and expanded editions of The Anatomy of Melancholy during his lifetime. It has often been out of print, most notably between 1676 and 1800.The Complete Review discussion of The Anatomy of Melancholy Because no original manuscript of the Anatomy has survived, later reprints have drawn more or less faithfully from the editions published during Burton's life.William H. Gass, Introduction to The Anatomy of Melancholy, New York Review of Books 2001 Early editions are now in the public domain, with several available in their entirety from a number of online sources such as Project Gutenberg. In recent years, increased interest in the book, combined with its status as a public domain work, has resulted in a number of new print editions, most recently a 2001 reprinting of the 1932 edition by The New York Review of Books under its NYRB Classics imprint ().  Synopsis  Burton defined his subject as follows: In attacking his stated subject, Burton drew from nearly every science of his day, including psychology and physiology, but also astronomy, meteorology, and theology, and even astrology and demonology. Much of the book consists of quotations from various ancient and medieval medical authorities, beginning with Hippocrates, Aristotle, and Galen. Hence the Anatomy is filled with more or less pertinent references to the works of others. A competent Latinist, Burton also included a great deal of Latin poetry in the Anatomy, and many of his inclusions from ancient sources are left untranslated in the text. The Anatomy of Melancholy is an especially lengthy book, the first edition being a single quarto volume nearly 900 pages long; subsequent editions were even longer. The text is divided into three major sections plus an introduction, the whole written in Burton's sprawling style. Characteristically, the introduction includes not only an author's note (titled \\"Democritus Junior to the Reader\\"), but also a Latin poem (\\"Democritus Junior to His Book\\"), a warning to \\"The Reader Who Employs His Leisure Ill\\", an abstract of the following text, and another poem explaining the frontispiece. The following three sections proceed in a similarly exhaustive fashion: the first section focuses on the causes and symptoms of \\"common\\" melancholies, while the second section deals with cures for melancholy, and the third section explores more complex and esoteric melancholies, including the melancholy of lovers and all varieties of religious melancholies. The Anatomy concludes with an extensive index (which, many years later, The New York Times Book Review called \\"a readerly pleasure in itself\\"Thomas Mallon, The New York Times Book Review, October 3, 1991). Most modern editions include many explanatory notes, and translate most of the Latin.  Critical reception  Admirers of The Anatomy of Melancholy range from Samuel Johnson, Holbrook Jackson (whose Anatomy of Bibliomania [1931] was based on the style and presentation), George Armstrong Custer, Charles Lamb and John Keats (who said it was his favourite book) to Northrop Frye, Stanley Fish, Philip Pullman, Cy Twombly, Jorge Luis Borges (who used a quote as an epigraph to his story \\"The Library of Babel\\"), O. Henry (William Sidney Porter), Amalia Lund, William Gass, Nick Cave, Samuel Beckett and Jacques Barzun (who sees in it many anticipations of 20th-century psychiatry).Jacques Barzun, From Dawn to Decadence, 221-224. According to The Guardian literary critic Nick Lezard, the Anatomy \\"survives among the cognoscenti\\".Nick Lezard, \\"Classics of the Future\\", The Guardian, September 16, 2000. Washington Irving uses a quote from the book on the title page of The Sketch Book. Burton's solemn tone and his endeavour to prove indisputable facts by weighty quotations were ridiculed by Laurence Sterne in Tristram Shandy.Ferriar (1798), chapter 3, pp. 55‚Äì9, 64.Petrie (1970) pp. 261‚Äì2. Sterne also mocked Burton's divisions in the titles of his chapters, and parodied his grave and sober account of Cicero's grief for the death of his daughter Tullia.

Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1997, It appears in developed form, but without mechanistic details, in the early Upanishads. The full exposition of the Sa·πÉsƒÅra doctrine is found in Sramanic religions such as Buddhism and Jainism, as well as various schools of Hindu philosophy after about the mid-1st millennium BC. The Sa·πÉsƒÅra doctrine is tied to the karma theory of Indian religions, and the liberation from Sa·πÉsƒÅra has been at the core of the spiritual quest of Indian traditions, as well as their internal disagreements. The liberation from Sa·πÉsƒÅra is called Moksha, Nirvana, Mukti or Kaivalya. Etymology and terminology Sa·πÉsƒÅra (Devanagari: ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞) means \\"wandering\\", as well as \\"world\\" wherein the term connotes \\"cyclic change\\". Sa·πÉsƒÅra is a fundamental concept in all Indian religions, is linked to the karma theory, and refers to the belief that all living beings cyclically go through births and rebirths. The term is related to phrases such as \\"the cycle of successive existence\\", \\"transmigration\\", \\"karmic cycle\\", \\"the wheel of life\\", and \\"cyclicality of all life, matter, existence\\". Many scholarly texts spell Sa·πÉsƒÅra as Samsara. According to Monier-Williams, Sa·πÉsƒÅra is rooted in the term Sa·πÉs·πõ (‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•É), which means \\"to go round, revolve, pass through a succession of states, to go towards or obtain, moving in a circuit\\". A conceptual form from this root appears in ancient texts as Sa·πÉsara·πáa, which means \\"going around through a succession of states, birth, rebirth of living beings and the world\\", without obstruction. The term shortens to Sa·πÉsƒÅra, referring to the same concept, as a \\"passage through successive states of mundane existence\\", a transmigration, metempsychosis, a circuit of living where one repeats previous states, from one body to another, a worldly life of constant change, that is rebirth, growth, decay and redeath. The concept is then contrasted with the concept of moksha, also known as mukti, nirvana, nibbana or kaivalya, which refers to liberation from this cycle of aimless wandering. The concept of Samsara developed in the post-Vedic times, and is traceable in the Samhita layers such as in sections 1.164, 4.55, 6.70 and 10.14 of the Rigveda. While the idea is mentioned in the Samhita layers of the Vedas, there is lack of clear exposition there, and the idea fully develops in the early Upanishads. Damien Keown states that the notion of \\"cyclic birth and death\\" appears around 800 BC. The word Sa·πÉsƒÅra appears, along with Moksha, in several Principal Upanishads such as in verse 1.3.7 of the Katha Upanishad,Katha Upanishad ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§•‡§Æ‡•ã‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ø‡§É/‡§§‡•É‡§§‡•Ä‡§Ø‡§µ‡§≤‡•ç‡§≤‡•Ä Wikisource verse 6.16 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad,Shvetashvatara Upanishad ‡§∑‡§∑‡•ç‡§†‡§É ‡§Ö‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ø‡§É Wikisource verses 1.4 and 6.34 of the Maitri Upanishad.Maitri Upanishad Wikisource, Quote: ‡•© ‡§ö‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§Æ‡•á‡§µ ‡§π‡§ø ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ç ‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§Ø‡§§‡•ç‡§®‡•á‡§® ‡§∂‡•ã‡§ß‡§Ø‡•á‡§§‡•çGA Jacob (1963), A concordance to the Principal Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita, Motilal Banarsidass, pages 947-948 The word Samsara is related to Sa·πÉs·πõti, the latter referring to the \\"course of mundane existence, transmigration, flow, circuit or stream\\". Definition and rationale The word literally means \\"wandering through, flowing on\\", states Stephen J. Laumakis, in the sense of \\"aimless and directionless wandering\\". The concept of Sa·πÉsƒÅra is closely associated with the belief that the person continues to be born and reborn in various realms and forms. The earliest layers of Vedic text incorporate the concept of life, followed by an afterlife in heaven and hell based on cumulative virtues (merit) or vices (demerit). However, the ancient Vedic Rishis challenged this idea of afterlife as simplistic, because people do not live an equally moral or immoral life. Between generally virtuous lives, some are more virtuous; while evil too has degrees, and the texts assert that it would be unfair for god Yama to judge and reward people with varying degrees of virtue or vices, in \\"either or\\" and disproportionate manner. They introduced the idea of an afterlife in heaven or hell in proportion to one's merit, and when this runs out, one returns and is reborn. This idea appears in ancient and medieval texts, as the cycle of life, death, rebirth and redeath, such as section 6:31 of the Mahabharata and section 6.10 of Devi Bhagavata Purana.Yuvraj Krishan (1988), Is Karma Evolutionary?, Journal of Indian Council of Philosophical Research, Volume 6, pages 24-26 History The historical origins of a concept of a cycle of repeated reincarnation are obscure but the idea appears in texts of both India and ancient Greece during the first millennium BC. The idea of Samsara is hinted in the late Vedic texts such as the Rigveda, but the theory is absent.A.M. Boyer (1901), Etude sur l'origine de la doctrine du samsara, Journal Asiatique, Volume 9, Issue 18, pages 451-453, 459-468 The late textual layers of the Vedas mention and anticipate the doctrine of karma and rebirth, however states Stephen Laumakis, the idea is not fully developed. It is in the early Upanishads where these ideas are more fully developed, but there too the discussion does not provide specific mechanistic details. The detailed doctrines flower with unique characteristics, starting around the mid 1st millennium BC, in diverse traditions such as in Buddhism, Jainism and various schools of Hindu philosophy. Some scholars state that the Samsara doctrine may have originated from the Sramana traditions and was then adopted by the Brahmanical traditions (Hinduism).Gavin D. Flood (1996), An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, , page 86, Quote: ‚ÄúThe origin and doctrine of Karma and Samsara are obscure. These concepts were certainly circulating amongst sramanas, and Jainism and Buddhism developed specific and sophisticated ideas about the process of transmigration. It is very possible that the karmas and reincarnation entered the mainstream brahmanical thought from the sramana or the renouncer traditions. Yet, on the other hand, although there is no clear doctrine of transmigration in the vedic hymns, there is the idea of redeath, that a person having died in this world, might die yet again in the next.‚ÄùPadmanabh S. Jaini 2001 ‚ÄúCollected Paper on Buddhist Studies‚Äù Motilal Banarsidass, , page 51, Quote: \\"Yajnavalkya‚Äôs reluctance to discuss the doctrine of karma in public (...) can perhaps be explained by the assumption that it was, like that of the transmigration of soul, of non-brahmanical origin. In view of the fact that this doctrine is emblazoned on almost every page of sramana scriptures, it is highly probable that it was derived from them.\\"Govind Chandra Pande, (1994) Life and Thought of Sankaracarya, Motilal Banarsidass , page 135, Quote: (...) They Sramanas could have been connected with the Harappan Civilization which is itself enigmatic. It seems that some Upanishad thinkers like Yajnavalkya were acquainted with this kind [sramanic] thinking (...) and tried to incorporate these ideas of Karma, Samsara and Moksa into the traditional Vedic thought. The evidence for who influenced whom in the ancient times, is slim and speculative, and the odds are the historic development of the Samsara theories likely happened in parallel with mutual influences.; Quote: \\"There was such constant interaction between Vedism and Buddhism in the early period that it is fruitless to attempt to sort out the earlier source of many doctrines, they lived in one another's pockets, like Picasso and Braque (who were, in later years, unable to say which of them had painted certain paintings from their earlier, shared period).\\" = Punarmrityu: redeath = While Sa·πÉsƒÅra is usually described as rebirth and reincarnation of living beings, the chronological development of the idea over its history began with the questions on what is the true nature of human existence and whether people die only once. This led first to the concepts of Punarm·πõtyu (\\"redeath\\") and Punarav·πõtti (\\"return\\"). These early theories asserted that the nature of human existence involves two realities, one unchanging absolute Atman (soul) which is somehow connected to the ultimate unchanging immortal reality and bliss called Brahman, and that the rest is the always-changing subject (body) in a phenomenal world (Maya). Redeath, in the Vedic theosophical speculations, reflected the end of \\"blissful years spent in svarga or heaven\\", and it was followed by rebirth back in the phenomenal world. Samsara developed into a foundational theory of the nature of existence, shared by all Indian religions. Rebirth as a human being, states John Bowker, was then presented as a \\"rare opportunity to break the sequence of rebirth, thus attaining Moksha, release\\". Each Indian spiritual tradition developed its own assumptions and paths (marga or yoga) for this spiritual release, with some developing the ideas of Jivanmukti (liberation and freedom in this life),Klaus Klostermaier, Mok·π£a and Critical Theory, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Jan., 1985), pages 61-71Norman E. Thomas (April 1988), Liberation for Life: A Hindu Liberation Philosophy, Missiology, Volume 16, Number 2, pp 149-160Gerhard Oberhammer (1994), La D√©livrance d√®s cette vie: Jivanmukti, Coll√®ge de France, Publications de l'Institut de Civilisation Indienne. S√©rie in-8¬∞, Fasc. 61, √âdition-Diffusion de Boccard (Paris), , pages 1-9 while others content with Videhamukti (liberation and freedom in after-life).M. von Br√ºck (1986), Imitation or Identification?, Indian Theological Studies, Vol. 23, Issue 2, pages 95-105Paul Deussen, , pages 356-357 The Sramanas traditions (Buddhism and Jainism) added novel ideas, starting about the 6th century BC. They emphasized human suffering in the larger context, placing rebirth, redeath and truth of pain at the center and the start of religious life. Samsara was viewed by the Sramanas as a beginningless cyclical process with each birth and death as punctuations in that process, and spiritual liberation as freedom from rebirth and redeath. The samsaric rebirth and redeath ideas are discussed in these religions with various terms, such as ƒÄgatigati in many early Pali Suttas of Buddhism. = Evolution of ideas = Across different religions, different soteriology were emphasized as the Sa·πÉsƒÅra theories evolved in respective Indian traditions. For example, in their Sa·πÉsƒÅra theories, states Obeyesekere, the Hindu traditions accepted Atman or soul exists and asserted it to be the unchanging essence of each living being, while Buddhist traditions denied such a soul exists and developed the concept of Anatta.[a] Anatta, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2013), Quote: \\"Anatta in Buddhism, the doctrine that there is in humans no permanent, underlying soul. The concept of anatta, or anatman, is a departure from the Hindu belief in atman (‚Äúthe self‚Äù).\\"; [b] Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, , page 64; \\"Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattƒÅ, Sanskrit: anƒÅtman, the opposed doctrine of ƒÅtman is central to Brahmanical thought). Put very briefly, this is the [Buddhist] doctrine that human beings have no soul, no self, no unchanging essence.\\"; [c] Edward Roer (Translator), to Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad, pages 2-4; [d] Katie Javanaud (2013), Is The Buddhist ‚ÄòNo-Self‚Äô Doctrine Compatible With Pursuing Nirvana?, Philosophy Now; [e] David Loy (1982), Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta: Are Nirvana and Moksha the Same?, International Philosophical Quarterly, Volume 23, Issue 1, pages 65-74; [f] KN Jayatilleke (2010), Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, , pages 246-249, from note 385 onwards; Salvation (moksha, mukti) in the Hindu traditions was described using the concepts of Atman (self) and Brahman (universal reality),Moksha, Georgetown University while in Buddhism it (nirvana, nibbana) was described through the concept of Anatta (no self) and ≈ö≈´nyatƒÅ (emptiness). The Ajivika tradition combined Sa·πÉsƒÅra with the premise that there is no free will, while the Jainism tradition accepted the concept of soul (calling it \\"jiva\\") with free will, but emphasized asceticism and cessation of action as a means of liberation from Sa·πÉsƒÅra it calls bondage. The various sub-traditions of Hinduism, and of Buddhism, accepted free will, avoided asceticism, accepted renunciation and monastic life, and developed their own ideas on liberation through realization of the true nature of existence.  in Hinduism In Hinduism, Sa·πÉsƒÅra is a journey of the soul. The body dies, assert the Hindu traditions, but not the soul which it assumes to be the eternal reality, indestructible and bliss. Everything and all existence is connected, cyclical and composed of two things, the soul and the body or matter. This eternal soul called Atman never reincarnates, it does not change and cannot change in the Hindu belief. In contrast, the body and personality, can change, constantly changes, is born and dies. Current karma impacts the future circumstances in this life, as well as the future forms and realms of lives.Christopher Chapple (1986), Karma and creativity, State University of New York Press, , pages 60-64 Good intent and actions lead to good future, bad intent and actions lead to bad future, in the Hindu view of life. A virtuous life, actions consistent with dharma, are believed by Hindus to contribute to a better future, whether in this life or future lives. The aim of spiritual pursuits, whether it be through the path of bhakti (devotion), karma (work), jnana (knowledge), or raja (meditation) is self-liberation (moksha) from Samsara. The Upanishads, part of the scriptures of the Hindu traditions, primarily focus on self-liberation from Sa·πÉsƒÅra. The Bhagavad Gita discusses various paths to liberation. The Upanishads, states Harold Coward, offer a \\"very optimistic view regarding the perfectibility of human nature\\", and the goal of human effort in these texts is a continuous journey to self-perfection and self-knowledge so as to end Sa·πÉsƒÅra. The aim of spiritual quest in the Upanishadic traditions is find the true self within and to know one's soul, a state that it believes leads to blissful state of freedom, moksha. =Differences within the Hindu traditions= All Hindu traditions and Dar≈õanas share the concept of Sa·πÉsƒÅra, but they differ in details and what they describe the state of liberation from Sa·πÉsƒÅra to be. The Sa·πÉsƒÅra is viewed as the cycle of rebirth in a temporal world of always changing reality or Maya (appearance, illusive), Brahman is defined as that which never changes or Sat (eternal truth, reality), and moksha as the realization of Brahman and freedom from Sa·πÉsƒÅra.H Chaudhuri (1954), The Concept of Brahman in Hindu Philosophy, Philosophy East and West, 4(1), pages 47-66 The dualistic devotional traditions such as Madhvacharya's Dvaita Vedanta tradition of Hinduism champion a theistic premise, assert the individual human soul and Brahman (Vishnu, Krishna) are two different realities, loving devotion to Vishnu is the means to release from Samsara, it is the grace of Vishnu which leads to moksha, and spiritual liberation is achievable only in after-life (videhamukti). The nondualistic traditions such as Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta tradition of Hinduism champion a monistic premise, asserting that the individual human soul and Brahman are identical, only ignorance, impulsiveness and inertia leads to suffering through Sa·πÉsƒÅra, in reality they are no dualities, meditation and self-knowledge is the path to liberation, the realization that one's soul is identical to Brahman is moksha, and spiritual liberation is achievable in this life (jivanmukti).  in Jainism Symbolic depiction of Sa·πÉsƒÅra at Shri Mahaveerji temple of Jainism. In Jainism, the Sa·πÉsƒÅra and karma doctrine are central to its theological foundations, as evidenced by the extensive literature on it in the major sects of Jainism, and their pioneering ideas on karma and Sa·πÉsƒÅra from the earliest times of the Jaina tradition. Sa·πÉsƒÅra in Jainism represents the worldly life characterized by continuous rebirths and suffering in various realms of existence. The conceptual framework of the Sa·πÉsƒÅra doctrine differs between the Jainism traditions and other Indian religions. For instance, in Jaina traditions, soul (jiva) is accepted as a truth, as is assumed in the Hindu traditions, but not assumed in the Buddhist traditions. However, Sa·πÉsƒÅra or the cycle of rebirths, has a definite beginning and end in Jainism. Souls begin their journey in a primordial state, and exist in a state of consciousness continuum that is constantly evolving through Sa·πÉsƒÅra. Some evolve to a higher state, while some regress, a movement that is driven by karma. Further, Jaina traditions believe that there exist Abhavya (incapable), or a class of souls that can never attain moksha (liberation). The Abhavya state of soul is entered after an intentional and shockingly evil act. Jainism considers souls as pluralistic each in a karma-Sa·πÉsƒÅra cycle, and does not subscribe to Advaita style nondualism of Hinduism, or Advaya style nondualism of Buddhism. The Jaina theosophy, like ancient Ajivika, but unlike Hindu and Buddhist theosophies, asserts that each soul passes through 8,400,000 birth-situations, as they circle through Sa·πÉsƒÅra. As the soul cycles, states Padmanabh Jaini, Jainism traditions believe that it goes through five types of bodies: earth bodies, water bodies, fire bodies, air bodies and vegetable lives. With all human and non-human activities, such as rainfall, agriculture, eating and even breathing, minuscule living beings are taking birth or dying, their souls are believed to be constantly changing bodies. Perturbing, harming or killing any life form, including any human being, is considered a sin in Jainism, with negative karmic effects. A liberated soul in Jainism is one who has gone beyond Sa·πÉsƒÅra, is at the apex, is omniscient, remains there eternally, and is known as a Siddha. A male human being is considered closest to the apex with the potential to achieve liberation, particularly through asceticism. Women must gain karmic merit, to be reborn as man, and only then can they achieve spiritual liberation in Jainism, particularly in the Digambara sect of Jainism; however, this view has been historically debated within Jainism and different Jaina sects have expressed different views, particularly the Shvetambara sect that believes that women too can achieve liberation from Sa·πÉsƒÅra. In contrast to Buddhist texts which do not expressly or unambiguously condemn injuring or killing plants and minor life forms, Jaina texts do. Jainism considers it a bad karma to injure plants and minor life forms with negative impact on a soul's .Lambert Schmithausen (1991), Buddhism and Nature, Studia Philologica Buddhica, The International Institute for Buddhist Studies, Tokyo Japan, pages 6-7 However, some texts in Buddhism and Hinduism do caution a person from injuring all life forms, including plants and seeds.Rod Preece (1999), Animals and Nature: Cultural Myths, Cultural Realities, , University of British Columbia Press, pages 212-217Christopher Chapple (1990), Ecological Nonviolence and the Hindu Tradition, in Perspectives on Nonviolence, Springer, , pages 168-177; L Alsdorf (1962), Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte von Vegetarismus und Rinderverehrung in Indien, Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur, F.

A liberated soul in Jainism is one who has gone beyond Sa·πÉsƒÅra, is at the apex, is omniscient, remains there eternally, and is known as a Siddha.  in Buddhism Traditional Tibetan thangka showing the bhavacakra and six realms of Sa·πÉsƒÅra in Buddhist cosmology. Sa·πÉsƒÅra in Buddhism, states Jeff Wilson, is the \\"suffering-laden cycle of life, death, and rebirth, without beginning or end\\". Also referred to as the wheel of existence (Bhavacakra), it is often mentioned in Buddhist texts with the term punarbhava (rebirth, re-becoming); the liberation from this cycle of existence, Nirvana, is the foundation and the most important purpose of Buddhism., Quote: \\"Nirvana is the raison d‚Äô√™tre of Buddhism, and its ultimate justification.\\" Samsara is considered impermanent in Buddhism, just like other Indian religions. Karma drives this impermanent Samsara in Buddhist thought, states Paul Williams, and \\"short of attaining enlightenment, in each rebirth one is born and dies, to be reborn elsewhere in accordance with the completely impersonal causal nature of one's own karma; This endless cycle of birth, rebirth, and redeath is Sa·πÉsƒÅra\\". The Four Noble Truths, accepted by all Buddhist traditions, are aimed at ending this Samsara-related re-becoming (rebirth) and associated cycles of suffering. Quote: \\"the first features described as painful [dukkha] in the above DCPS [Dhamma-cakka-pavatana Sutta in Vinaya Pitaka] quote are basic biological aspects of being alive, each of which can be traumatic. The dukkha of these is compounded by the rebirth perspective of Buddhism, for this involves repeated re-birth, re-aging, re-sickness, and re-death.\\" Like Jainism, Buddhism developed its own Samsara theory, that evolved over time the mechanistic details on how the wheel of mundane existence works over the endless cycles of rebirth and redeath.; Quote: \\"Buddhist doctrine holds that until they realize nirvana, beings are bound to undergo rebirth and redeath due to their having acted out of ignorance and desire, thereby producing the seeds of karma\\". In early Buddhist traditions, Sa·πÉsƒÅra cosmology consisted of five realms through which wheel of existence recycled. This included hells (niraya), hungry ghosts (pretas), animals (tiryak), humans (manushya), and gods (devas, heavenly). In latter traditions, this list grew to a list of six realms of rebirth, adding demi-gods (asuras). The \\"hungry ghost, heavenly, hellish realms\\" respectively formulate the ritual, literary and moral spheres of many contemporary Buddhist traditions. The Sa·πÉsƒÅra concept, in Buddhism, envisions that these six realms are interconnected, and everyone cycles life after life, and death is just a state for an afterlife, through these realms, because of a combination of ignorance, desires and purposeful karma, or ethical and unethical actions. Nirvana is typically described as the freedom from rebirth and the only alternative to suffering of Samsara, in Buddhism. However, the Buddhist texts developed a more comprehensive theory of rebirth, states Steven Collins, from fears of redeath, called amata (death-free), a state which is considered synonymous with nirvana.  in Sikhism Sikhism incorporates the concepts of Sa·πÉsƒÅra (sometimes spelled as Sansara in Sikh texts), karma and cyclical nature of time and existence. Founded in the 15th century, its founder Guru Nanak had a choice between the cyclical concept of ancient Indian religions and the linear concept of early 7th-century Islam, and he chose the cyclical concept of time, state Cole and Sambhi. However, states Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair, there are important differences between the Sa·πÖsƒÅra concept in Sikhism from the Sa·πÉsƒÅra concept in many traditions within Hinduism. The difference is that Sikhism firmly believes in the grace of God as the means to salvation, and its precepts encourage the bhakti of One Lord for mukti (salvation). Sikhism, like the three ancient Indian traditions, believes that body is perishable, there is a cycle of rebirth, and that there is suffering with each cycle of rebirth. These features of Sikhism, along with its belief in Sa·πÉsƒÅra and the grace of God, is similar to some bhakti-oriented sub- traditions within Hinduism such as those found in Vaishnavism. Sikhism does not believe that ascetic life, as recommended in Jainism, is the path to liberation. Rather, it cherishes social engagement and householder's life combined with devotion to the One God as Guru, to be the path of liberation from Sa·πÖsƒÅra.

By trading poker winnings for oil rights, he ultimately secured title to much of the East Texas Oil Field, one of the world's largest oil deposits. From it and his other acquisitions, he accrued a fortune that was among the world's largest. At his death, he was reputed to have the highest net worth of any individual in the world. Life Hunt was born near Ramsey, in Carson Township, Fayette County, Illinois, the youngest of eight children. He was named after his father, Haroldson Lafayette Hunt, who was a prosperous farmer-entrepreneur. His mother was Ella Rose (Myers) Hunt. Hunt was homeschooled. He did not go to elementary school or to high school. Later, he said that education is an obstacle to making money.YouTube video: political television program \\"–í–ª–∞–¥—ã–∫–∏ –±–µ–∑ –º–∞—Å–æ–∫. –ò–≥—Ä–æ–∫ –Ω–∞ –û–ª–∏–º–ø–µ\\" (\\"Lords without masks. Player on Olympus\\"), Soviet Union, 1970 As a teenager, Hunt traveled to different places before he settled in Arkansas, where he was running a cotton plantation by 1912. He had a reputation as a math prodigy and was a gambler. It was said that after his cotton plantation was flooded, he turned his last $100 into more than $100,000 after he had gambled in New Orleans. With his winnings, he purchased oil properties in the neighborhood of El Dorado, Arkansas. He was generous to his employees, who, in turn, were loyal to him by informing him of rumors of a massive oil field to the south, in East Texas. In negotiations over cheese and crackers, at the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas, with the wild-catter who discovered the East Texas Oil Field \\"Dad\\" Joiner, Hunt secured title to what was the largest known oil deposit in the world and agreed to pay only $1,000,000 and to protect Joiner from liability for his many fraudulent transactions surrounding the property. In 1957, Fortune estimated that Hunt had a fortune of $400-700 million,http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/ and was one of the eight richest people in the United States. J. Paul Getty, who was considered to be the richest private citizen in the world, said of Hunt, \\"In terms of extraordinary, independent wealth, there is only one man‚ÄîH. L. Hunt.\\" Personal life Hunt had fifteen children by three wives. He married Lyda Bunker of Lake Village, Arkansas, in November 1914 and remained married to her until her death in 1955.Brown, pp. 40 & 191. His seven children by her were: Margaret (1915‚Äì2007), Haroldson (\\"Hassie,\\" 1917‚Äì2005), Caroline (1923‚Äì2018), Lyda (born and died in 1925), Nelson Bunker (1926‚Äì2014), William Herbert (1929), and Lamar (1932‚Äì2006). Their home on White Rock Lake in Dallas was styled after Mount Vernon though much larger. His first son, Hassie, who was expected to succeed him in control of the family business, was lobotomized in response to increasingly-erratic behavior. He outlived his father. Lamar founded the American Football League and created the Super Bowl, drawing on the assistance of his children in selecting the game's name. Two other children, Herbert and Bunker, are famous for their purchasing much of the world's silver, in an attempt to corner the market. They ultimately owned more silver than any government in the world before their scheme was discovered and undone. Bunker Hunt was briefly one of the wealthiest men in the world, having discovered and taken title to the Libyan oil fields, before Muammar Gaddafi nationalized the properties. While still married to Lyda, H. L. Hunt is said to have married Frania Tye of Tampa, Florida, in November 1925 by using the name Franklin Hunt. Frania claimed to have discovered the bigamous nature of her marriage in 1934, and in a legal settlement in 1941, Hunt created trust funds for each of their four children, and she signed a document stipulating that no legal marriage between them had ever existed. About the same time, she briefly married then divorced Hunt's employee, John Lee, taking the last name Lee for herself and her four children.Brown, pp. 78‚Äì79 & 156‚Äì157. Her four children by Hunt were: Howard (born 1926), Haroldina (1928), Helen (1930), and Hugh (\\"Hue,\\" 1934). Frania Tye Lee died in 2002.Burrough, p. 437. Hunt supported and had children by Ruth Ray of Shreveport, Louisiana, whom he had met when she was a secretary in his Shreveport office. They married in 1957 after the death of Hunt's wife Lyda.

Considered one of the world's leading orchestras,In a widely cited list compiled by the British magazine Gramophone in 2008 (The world‚Äôs greatest orchestras), the RCO was in the number one position. A new list published in 2015, by the website Bachtrack, (Mark Pullinger, Chailly and the Berliner Philharmoniker: the critics‚Äô choice for World‚Äôs Best Conductor and Orchestra, 3 September 2015), also based on a poll among music critics, put the Concertgebouw Orchestra in the number two position. Queen Beatrix conferred the \\"Royal\\" title upon the orchestra in 1988. History The Concertgebouw opened on 11 April 1888. The Concertgebouw Orchestra was established several months later and gave its first concert in the Concertgebouw on 3 November 1888. This performance was conducted by the orchestra's first chief conductor, Willem Kes. =1888‚Äì1945: Kes and Mengelberg= Kes served as the orchestra's chief conductor from its 1888 founding to 1895. In 1895, Willem Mengelberg became chief conductor and remained in this position for fifty years, an unusually long tenure for a music director.Other long tenures at major orchestras include Evgeny Mravinsky at the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra, Ernest Ansermet at the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, Robert Kajanus at the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, and Eugene Ormandy at the Philadelphia Orchestra. He is generally regarded as having brought the orchestra to a level of major international significance, with a particular championing of such then-contemporary composers as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss. The Concertgebouw For approximately its first 75 years, the Concertgebouw Orchestra had a somewhat complicated roster of conductors. In addition to the chief conductor, the orchestra had conductor positions titled \\"eerste dirigent\\" (\\"first conductor\\"), who assisted the chief conductor with programming, and \\"tweede dirigent\\" (\\"second conductor\\"), who did \\"what he was told.\\"Wisse, Kees, notes to Q-Disc Issue \\"Eduard Van Beinum: The Radio Recordings\\", Q-Disc (translated Lodewijk Od√©, Ko Kooman and Chris Gordon). During Mengelberg's time as chief conductor, several of these first conductors included Karl Muck (1921‚Äì1925), Pierre Monteux (1924‚Äì1934), Bruno Walter (1934‚Äì1939), and Eugen Jochum (1941‚Äì1943), each of them internationally respected and holding positions at other orchestras as well. Musicians who served as \\"second conductor\\" were all Dutch and included the composer Cornelis Dopper, Evert Cornelis and Eduard van Beinum. In 1945, because of the controversy over his relationship with the Nazi occupying forces during the German occupation of the Netherlands during World War II, Mengelberg was removed as chief conductor and subsequently banned from conducting in The Netherlands. The ban was initially imposed for the remainder of his life, but after an appeal, reduced to six years, applied retroactively from 1945. Mengelberg died in 1951 just before the end of his sentence, thus never conducting the orchestra after 1945. =1945‚Äì1988: Van Beinum and Haitink= From 1945 to 1959, the orchestra's principal conductor was Eduard van Beinum, who had debuted with the orchestra in 1929. He had become the second conductor of the orchestra in 1931, and co-principal conductor in 1938. One of his specialties was the symphonies of Anton Bruckner, and Van Beinum made commercial recordings with the orchestra of Bruckner's Eighth and Ninth Symphonies for the Philips Records label. Van Beinum served as sole chief conductor of the orchestra after World War II until his sudden death on the Concertgebouw podium from a heart attack in April 1959. Bernard Haitink made his debut with the Concertgebouw Orchestra on 7 November 1956. After Van Beinum's death, from 1961 to 1963, Haitink and Eugen Jochum shared the post of chief conductor of the orchestra.Hussey, Dyneley, \\"The Musician's Gramophone\\" (May 1960). The Musical Times, 101 (1407): 303. Haitink became sole chief conductor in 1963, and served in this post until 1988. At some point during Haitink's time, the conductor system was simplified to have an assistant conductor instead of first- and second-conductors. Conductors who served in this capacity included Edo de Waart and Hans Vonk. The recording profile of the orchestra increased most dramatically under Haitink, with many recordings for Philips Records, as well as EMI and Columbia Records. In the early 1980s, the Dutch government threatened the orchestra with reductions in its government subsidy that could potentially have led to the dismissal of 23 musicians from the orchestra. Haitink threatened to resign in protest, and the financial situation was eventually settled. In 1999, Haitink was named the orchestra's Conductor Laureate. In March 2014, Haitink suggested to the Dutch newspaper Het Parool that he wished to renounce the title of RCO conductor laureate and no longer to guest-conduct the orchestra, in protest at the orchestra's current administrative management. In September 2015, the orchestra announced a rapprochement with Haitink, with a scheduled guest- conducting engagement with the RCO in the 2016‚Äì2017 season. =1988‚Äìcurrent: Chailly, Jansons and Gatti= The orchestra performing in the Grote Zaal (Great Hall) Riccardo Chailly made his debut with the Concertgebouw Orchestra in 1985, and was elected that year as their next chief conductor to succeed Haitink. As the first non-Dutchman to hold the post, Chailly served as chief conductor from 1988 to 2004. His recordings with the orchestra include complete Mahler and Brahms symphony cycles and several Bruckner symphonies. He is a strong advocate of modern music and recorded shorter works of Shostakovich, the complete Kammermusiken of Paul Hindemith, and the orchestral works of Igor Stravinsky, Olivier Messiaen and Edgard Var√®se. After his departure in 2004, Chailly was named Conductor Emeritus of the RCO. The Latvian conductor Mariss Jansons made his RCO debut in 1988 and was elected chief conductor on 22 October 2002. His tenure officially began on 1 September 2004, with an initial contract of three years. Premi√®res during Janson's tenure have included Hans Werner Henze's Sebastian im Traum, a RCO co- commission. In April 2014, the orchestra announced the scheduled conclusion of Jansons' tenure as chief conductor after the 2014‚Äì15 season. Daniele Gatti first guest-conducted the RCO in 2004. In October 2014, the RCO announced the appointment of Gatti as its seventh chief conductor, effective in 2016. On 2 August 2018, the orchestra announced Gatti's immediate departure following complaints of \\"inappropriate\\" behaviour with female musicians. Character The orchestra enjoyed a close relationship with Gustav Mahler and championed many of his symphonies, with an especially worthy festival of his music being the 1920 Mahler Festival. Other conductors who worked closely with the Concertgebouw Orchestra included Pierre Monteux, Eugen Jochum, George Szell and Kirill Kondrashin, who was principal guest conductor from 1978, following his defection from the USSR, until his death in 1981. More recently, Nikolaus Harnoncourt served as Honorary Guest Conductor of the RCO, beginning in 2000, and leading his final performance with the RCO in October 2013. Another factor in creating the orchestra's distinct character is that the Concertgebouw Orchestra has had only six chief conductors, setting it apart from orchestras of similar age and caliber. The nearly one thousand recordings that the orchestra has to its credit have also contributed to this reputation. The orchestra also serves as one of the opera orchestras for productions of the Dutch National Opera. Jan Raes is the orchestra's current executive director, since 1 December 2008, succeeding Jan Willem Loot, who retired in November 2008. In May 2019, the orchestra announced that Raes is to stand down as its executive director at the end of 2019. Past artistic directors of the Concertgebouw Orchestra have included Rudolf Mengelberg (1925-1955), Marius Flothuis (1955‚Äì1974), Hein van Royen (1974-1991) and Peter Ruzicka. The present head of artistic administration for the orchestra is Joel Ethan Fried. The RCO has begun to issue CDs on its own label, RCO Live, as conducted by Jansons and Haitink among others.

The term plays a role in subsequent Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.Britannica Concise Encyclopedia, 2008. Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. . p. 1722. The singular \\"seraph\\" is a back-formation from the Hebrew plural-form \\"seraphim\\", whereas in Hebrew the singular is \\"saraph\\".The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. Tradition places seraphim in the highest rank in Christian angelology and in the fifth rank of ten in the Jewish angelic hierarchy. A seminal passage in the Book of Isaiah () used the term to describe six-winged beings that fly around the Throne of God crying \\"holy, holy, holy\\". This throne scene, with its triple invocation of holiness, profoundly influenced subsequent theology, literature and art. Its influence is frequently seen in works depicting angels, heaven and apotheosis. Seraphim are mentioned as celestial beings in an influential Hellenistic work, the Book of Enoch, and the Book of Revelation. Origins and development Seraphim figures in Hagia Sophia. There is emerging consensus that the motifs used to display seraphs in Hyksos-era Palestine had their original sources in Egyptian uraeus iconography. The word saraph/seraphim appears four times in the Book of Isaiah (6:2‚Äì6, 14:29, 30:6). In Isaiah 6:2‚Äì6 the term is used to describe a type of celestial being or angel. The other uses of the word refer to serpents. The vision in Isaiah Chapter 6 of seraphim in an idealized version of Solomon's Temple represents the sole instance in the Hebrew Bible of this word being used to describe celestial beings. \\"... I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. Above it stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.\\" (Isaiah 6:1‚Äì3) And one cried to another, \\"Holy, holy, holy, is YHWH of hosts: the whole earth is full of His glory.\\" (verses 2‚Äì3) One seraph carries out an act of ritual purification for the prophet by touching his lips with a live coal from the altar (verses 6‚Äì7) \\"And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.\\" The text describes the \\"seraphim\\" as winged celestial beings with a fiery passion for doing God's good work. Notwithstanding the wording of the text itself, at least one Hebrew scholar claims that in the Hebrew Bible the seraphim do not have the status of angels, and that it is only in later sources (like De Coelesti Hierarchia or Summa Theologiae) that they are considered to be a division of the divine messengers. Seraphim appear in the 2nd-century BC Book of Enoch,Enoch, xx. 7, lxi. 10, lxxi. 7. where they are mentioned, in conjunction with cherubim, as the heavenly creatures standing nearest to the throne of God. In non-biblical sources they are sometimes called the Aky…ôst ( \\"serpents\\", \\"dragons\\"; an alternate term for Hell).Sola, David Aaron. Signification of the Proper Names, Etc., Occurring in the Book of Enoch: From the Hebrew and Chaldee Languages London, 1852.Rev. X.Y.Z. Merry England, Volume 22, \\"The Story of a Conversion\\" 1894. pg. 151Enoch 1 68:9-16 In the Second Book of Enoch, two classes of celestial beings are mentioned alongside the seraphim and cherubim, known as the phoenixes and the chalkydri ( khalk√Ωdrai, compound of khalk√≥s \\"brass, copper\\" + h√Ωdra \\"hydra\\", \\"water- serpent\\"‚Äîlit. \\"brazen hydras\\", \\"copper serpents\\"). Both are described as \\"flying elements of the sun\\" that reside in either the 4th or 6th heaven, who have twelve wings and burst into song at sunrise.Davidson, Gustav. (1967) A Dictionary of Angels, Including the Fallen Angels, Entries: 'Chalkydri', p. 84; 'Phoenixes', p. 224. In the Book of Revelation (4:4‚Äì8), the beasts are described as being forever in God's presence and praising him: \\"[A]nd they rest not day and night, saying, 'Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.\\" This account differs slightly from the account of Isaiah, stating in the eighth verse, \\"And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within\\". They appear also in the Gnostic text, On the Origin of the World. In Judaism The 12th-century scholar Maimonides placed the seraphim in the fifth of ten ranks of angels in his exposition of the Jewish angelic hierarchy. In Kabbalah, the seraphim are the higher angels of the World of Beriah (\\"Creation\\", first created realm, divine understanding),Angels 2: Wings on Fire, kabbalaonline.org: \\"These creatures of the world of Beriya, are the higher angels, called serafim, from the Hebrew word for burn, saraf.\\" whose understanding of their distance from the absolute divinity of Atziluth causes their continual \\"burning up\\" in self- nullification. Through this they ascend to God, and return to their place. Below them in the World of Yetzirah (\\"Formation\\", archetypal creation, divine emotions) are the Hayot angels of Ezekiel's vision, who serve God with self- aware instinctive emotions (\\"face of a lion, ox, eagle\\"). Seraphim are part of the angelarchy of modern Orthodox Judaism. Isaiah's vision is repeated several times in daily Jewish services, including at Kedushah prayer as part of the repetition of the Amidah, and in several other prayers as well. Conservative Judaism retains the traditional doctrines regarding angels and includes references to them in the liturgy, although a literal belief in angels is by no means universal among adherents. Adherents of Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism generally take images of angels as symbolic. An ancient Judean seal from the 8th century BCE depicts them as flying asps, yet having human characteristics, as encountered by Isaiah in his commissioning as a prophet.Berlin, Adele; Brettler, Marc Zvi; and Jewish Publication Society. (2014).The Jewish Study Bible Jewish Publication Society Tanakh translation. New York, New York : Oxford University Press. p. 779. . In Christianity Petites Heures de Jean de Berry, a 14th-century illuminated manuscript, commissioned by John, Duke of Berry. Medieval Christian theology places seraphim in the highest choir of the angelic hierarchy. They are the caretakers of God's throne, continuously singing \\"holy, holy, holy\\". Pseudo- Dionysius the Areopagite in his Celestial Hierarchy (vii), drew upon the Book of Isaiah in fixing the fiery nature of seraphim in the medieval imagination. Seraphim in his view helped the Deity maintain perfect order and are not limited to chanting the trisagion. Taking his cue as well from writings in the Rabbinic tradition, the author gave an etymology for the Seraphim as \\"those who kindle or make hot\\" > The name seraphim clearly indicates their ceaseless and eternal revolution > about Divine Principles, their heat and keenness, the exuberance of their > intense, perpetual, tireless activity, and their elevative and energetic > assimilation of those below, kindling them and firing them to their own > heat, and wholly purifying them by a burning and all-consuming flame; and by > the unhidden, unquenchable, changeless, radiant and enlightening power, > dispelling and destroying the shadows of darkness Origen wrote in On First Principles that the Seraphim, in the Book of Isaiah, are the physical representation of the Christ and the Holy Spirit. His rationale comes from the idea that nothing \\"can wholly know the beginnings of all things and the ends of the universe\\" aside from God. Origen concludes this section in writing about the Seraphim as beings that have the knowledge of God revealed to them which elevates the role of the Seraphim to divine levels: > Nevertheless whatever it is that these powers may have learned through the > revelation of the Son of God and of the Holy Spirit-and they will certainly > be able to acquire a great deal of knowledge, and the higher ones much more > than the lower-still it is impossible for them to comprehend everything; for > it is written, 'The more part of God's works are secret. This quote suggests that Origen believed the Seraphim are revealed this knowledge because of their anointed status as Son of God and the Holy Spirit. He was later criticized for making such claims and labeled a heretic by the Christian church. However, his theory about the Seraphim, as referred to in Isaiah, would be reflected in other early Christian literature, as well as early Christian belief through the second century. Thomas Aquinas in his Summa Theologiae offers a description of the nature of seraphim: The seraphim took on a mystic role in Giovanni Pico della Mirandola's Oration on the Dignity of Man (1487), the epitome of Renaissance humanism. Pico took the fiery Seraphim‚Äî\\"they burn with the fire of charity\\"‚Äîas the highest models of human aspiration: \\"impatient of any second place, let us emulate dignity and glory. And, if we will it, we shall be inferior to them in nothing\\", the young Pico announced, in the first flush of optimistic confidence in the human capacity that is the coinage of the Renaissance. \\"In the light of intelligence, meditating upon the Creator in His work, and the work in its Creator, we shall be resplendent with the light of the Cherubim. If we burn with love for the Creator only, his consuming fire will quickly transform us into the flaming likeness of the Seraphim.\\" Bonaventure, a Franciscan theologian who was a contemporary of Aquinas, uses the six wings of the seraph as an important analogical construct in his mystical work The Journey of the Mind to God. Christian theology developed an idea of seraphim as beings of pure light who enjoy direct communication with God.  In Islam  Seraphim (Sarufiyyun or Musharifin)Jerrold Seigel Between Cultures: Europe and Its Others in Five Exemplary Lives University of Pennsylvania Press 2015 are mentioned in a hadith from Al-Tirmidhi, about a conversation between Muhammad and God, during the Night Journey, concerning what is between the Heavens and the earth, often interpreted as a reference to the \\"Exalted assembly\\" disputing the creation of Adam in Surah .Mir Valiuddin (1987).

It is an ethereal being of light with six wings. Also, Galeem attempted to destroy everything in existence and turn everyone (except the fighters) into spirits. *In The Bastard Executioner, the Order of Seraphim are charged with preserving and protecting Jesus Christ's nine-volume, handwritten Libro Nazareni (New Testament) from the Church, which, as Annora and Ventrishire's manor priest, Father Ruskin, discuss in episodes 7 (\\"Behold the Lamb / Gweled yr Oen\\") and 8 (\\"Broken Things / Pethau Toredig\\"), and 9 (\\"The Bernadette Maneuver / Cynllwyn Bernadette\\"), could be toppled by the book's release to the public. For that reason, the Church's leaders, such as Robinus, the Archdeacon of Windsor, and their Knights of the Rosebud/Rosula, have targeted both the book and its protectors to be hunted and destroyed. In episode 3, episode 3, some young Welsh people who want to earn credibility with the rebels against the government unwisely masquerade as members of the Order of Seraphim, by adorning themselves with seraphim face paint and attack the Baroness' wagon and its knights, which causes repercussions throughout the season for those captured, for their village, and for those affected by escalated hunts for rebels and for members of the Order of Seraphim. *In Doom (2016 video game) it is mentioned that a Seraphin blesses the Doom Slayer with great strength and speed. *From the Street Fighter series, the character Gill uses a move called Seraphic Wing, in which he reveals six wings and unleashes godly energy that does several hits. In Street Fighter III, it is the strongest move in the game and can one-hit KO an opponent if they are not blocking. In, Street Fighter V, it is his critical art. While it cannot instantly defeat an opponent like before, it deals a lot of damage. * Seraphs also appear in the \\"CW\\" TV show Supernatural. They are shown as more powerful angels, but still weaker than an Archangel. When the angel Castiel (originated from \\"Cassiel\\") dies, he is brought back as a Seraph, although he still does not possess the power to go up against the archangel who killed him, Raphael. *Seraph is a supporting character in the second and third films of The Matrix Trilogy. Seraph is an exile program who is seen acting as a \\"guardian angel\\" of the Oracle, and is described as the personification of a sophisticated challenge-handshake authentication protocol which guards the Oracle. *In the Armored Core series, the villain Nine-Ball is featured as a recurring antagonist. Its second and most powerful form, debuting in Armored Core: Master of Arena, is known as Nine-Ball Seraph. * The term Seraph is applied to the mysterious Beings of Light in various Battlestar Galactica comics. =Logos and mascots= *Several Catholic schools use a seraph or a seraph- related symbol as their mascot: ** Koinonia Academy, Plainfield, New Jersey, United States ** Mater Dei Catholic Preparatory School, Middletown, New Jersey, United States ** St. Bonaventure High School, Ventura, California, United States ** St. Madeleine Sophie Catholic School, Bellevue, Washington, United States *Kingswood College in Randles Hill, Kandy, Sri Lanka, a public school, claims the seraph as its mascot. * The University of Pisa, Italy, features a seraph as its logo, despite referring to it as \\"cherubino\\" (cherub). *Several Rolls-Royce models use a \\"Flying Lady\\" symbol or moniker, which some equate to a seraph.

It is an adaptation of the 1964 novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl. The film tells the story of a poor child named Charlie Bucket who, after finding a Golden Ticket in a chocolate bar, visits Willy Wonka's chocolate factory along with four other children from around the world. Filming took place in Munich from August to November 1970. Dahl was credited with writing the film's screenplay; however, David Seltzer, who went uncredited in the film, was brought in to re-work the screenplay against Dahl's wishes, making major changes to the ending and adding musical numbers. These changes and other decisions made by the director led Dahl to disown the film. The musical numbers were written by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley while Walter Scharf arranged and conducted the orchestral score. The film was released by Paramount Pictures on June 30, 1971. With a budget of just $3 million, the film received generally positive reviews and earned $4 million by the end of its original run. The film gained a cult following and became highly popular in part through repeated television airings and home entertainment sales. In 1972, the film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score, and Wilder was nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, but both nominations lost to Fiddler on the Roof. The film also introduced the song \\"The Candy Man\\", which went on to become a popular hit when recorded by Sammy Davis Jr. and has since been covered by numerous artists. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".  Plot  In a small town, Charlie Bucket, a poor paperboy, watches kids visit a candy shop. Walking home, he passes Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. A mysterious tinker recites the first lines of William Allingham's poem \\"The Fairies\\" and tells Charlie that \\"nobody ever goes in, and nobody ever comes out.\\" Charlie rushes home to his widowed mother and bedridden grandparents. That night, Charlie tells his Grandpa Joe what the tinker said, and Joe reveals that Wonka locked the factory because other candy makers, including his rival Arthur Slugworth, sent in spies to steal his recipes. Wonka shut down the factory but resumed selling candy after three years. The origin of Wonka's labor force is unknown. Wonka announces he has hidden five \\"Golden Tickets\\" in chocolate Wonka Bars. Finders of the tickets will receive a factory tour and a lifetime supply of chocolate. The first four tickets are found by the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the spoiled Veruca Salt whose family is wealthy in the nut business, the gum-chewing Violet Beauregarde, and the television-obsessed Mike Teavee. As each winner is announced on TV, a sinister-looking man whispers to them. A subsequent news report reveals the fifth ticket was found in Paraguay by a millionaire/casino- owner, causing Charlie to lose hope. The next day, Charlie finds money in a gutter and uses it to buy a Wonka Scrumdiddlyumptious bar; with the change, he buys a regular Wonka Bar for Joe. While walking home, Charlie overhears that the millionaire forged the fifth ticket. Charlie opens the Wonka Bar and finds the fifth ticket. Rushing home, he encounters the same man seen whispering to the other winners, who introduces himself as Slugworth and offers a reward for a sample of Wonka's latest creation, the Everlasting Gobstopper. Returning home with the Golden Ticket, Charlie chooses Joe, who, in excitement, rises out of bed for the first time in 20 years, as his chaperone. The next day, Wonka greets the ticket winners and leads them inside, where each signs a contract before the tour. The factory includes a candy land with a river of chocolate and other sweets. The visitors meet Wonka's labor force, small men known as Oompa-Loompas. Despite being asked not to by Wonka, Augustus drinks directly from the chocolate river, but falls in and is sucked up by a pipe to the Fudge Room. Wonka takes the remaining guests on a surreal boat ride, leading to the Inventing Room, where everyone receives an Everlasting Gobstopper. Violet blows up into a large blueberry after chewing an experimental piece of three-course dinner gum over Wonka's warnings and must be squeezed before she explodes. The remaining group samples some lickable wallpaper and then reaches the Fizzy Lifting Drinks Room, where Charlie and Joe ignore Wonka's warning and sample the drinks. They float and have a near- fatal encounter with an exhaust fan before their burping \\"deflates\\" them and lets them descend back to the ground. In the Golden Eggs Room, Veruca demands a golden goose for herself before falling into a garbage chute that leads to the furnace, with her father falling in trying to rescue her. The rest of the group tests out Wonka's Wonkavision, which is used to teleport chocolate bars, and Mike teleports himself, becoming only a few inches tall. As the tour ends, Charlie and Joe, the only two remaining guests, ask about the other kids, and Wonka assures them that they will return to normal. Wonka then retreats to his office without awarding them the promised lifetime supply of chocolate. Grandpa Joe and Charlie enter his office to ask about this, where a furious Wonka informs them that by stealing Fizzy Lifting Drinks, they have violated the contract, thereby forfeiting their prize. Joe angrily denounces Wonka and suggests to Charlie that he should give Slugworth the Gobstopper as revenge, but Charlie returns the candy to Wonka. Wonka declares Charlie the winner and reveals that \\"Slugworth\\" is an employee, Mr. Wilkinson; the offer to buy the Gobstopper was a morality test that only Charlie passed. The trio enter the \\"Wonkavator\\", a multi-directional glass elevator that flies out of the factory. Soaring over the city, Wonka reveals he created the contest to find someone worthy enough to assume control of his factory when he retires, and he gives it to Charlie and his family.

Back row (left to right): Michael Bollner (Augustus Gloop), Ursula Reit (Mrs. Gloop), Gene Wilder (Willy Wonka) Second row (left to right): Leonard Stone (Sam Beauregarde), Roy Kinnear (Henry Salt), Nora Denny (Mrs. Teavee), Jack Albertson (Grandpa Joe) Front row (left to right): Denise Nickerson (Violet Beauregarde), Julie Dawn Cole (Veruca Salt), Paris Themmen (Mike Teavee), Peter Ostrum (Charlie Bucket) Oompa Loompas * Malcolm Dixon * Rusty Goffe * George Claydon * Angelo Muscat * Albert Wilkinson * Norma McGlen * Ismed Hassan * Marcus Powell * Pepi Poupee Production =Development= The idea for adapting the book into a film came about when director Mel Stuart's ten- year-old daughter read the book and asked her father to make a film out of it, with \\"Uncle Dave\\" (producer David L. Wolper who was not related to the Stuarts) producing it. Stuart showed the book to Wolper, who happened to be in the midst of talks with the Quaker Oats Company regarding a vehicle to introduce a new candy bar from its Chicago-based Breaker Confections subsidiary (since renamed the Willy Wonka Candy Company and sold to Nestl√©). Wolper persuaded the company, which had no previous experience in the film industry, to buy the rights to the book and finance the picture for the purpose of promoting a new Quaker Oats Wonka Bar. David L. Wolper and Roald Dahl agreed that the film would be a musical, and that Dahl himself would write the screenplay. However, Wolper changed the title to Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. Screenwriter David Seltzer conceived a gimmick exclusively for the film that had Wonka quoting numerous literary sources, such as Arthur O'Shaughnessy's Ode, Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice. Seltzer also worked Slugworth (only mentioned as a rival candy maker in the book) into the plot as an actual character (only to be revealed to be Wilkinson, one of Wonka's agents, at the end of the film). =Casting= All six members of Monty Python, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin, expressed interest in playing Wonka, but at the time they were deemed not big enough names for an international audience. Incidentally, three of the members, Cleese, Idle, and Palin, were later seriously considered for the same role in Tim Burton's version. Before Wilder was officially cast for the role, producers considered Fred Astaire, Joel Grey, Ron Moody, and Jon Pertwee. Spike Milligan was Roald Dahl's original choice to play Willy Wonka. Peter Sellers even begged Dahl for the role. When Wilder was cast for the role, he accepted it on one condition: The reason why Wilder wanted this in the film was that \\"from that time on, no one will know if I'm lying or telling the truth\\". Jean Stapleton turned down the role of Mrs. Teevee. Jim Backus was considered for the role of Sam Beauregarde. Sammy Davis Jr. wanted to play Bill, the candy store owner, but Stuart did not like the idea because he felt that the presence of a big star in the candy store scene would break the reality. Anthony Newley also wanted to play Bill, but Stuart also objected to this for the same reason. =Filming= Principal photography commenced on August 31, 1970, and ended on November 19, 1970. The primary shooting location was Munich, Bavaria, West Germany, because it was significantly cheaper than filming in the United States and the setting was conducive to Wonka's factory; Stuart also liked the ambiguity and unfamiliarity of the location. External shots of the factory were filmed at the gasworks of Stadtwerke M√ºnchen (Emmy-Noether-Stra√üe 10); the entrance and side buildings still exist. The exterior of Charlie Bucket's house, a set constructed solely for the film, was filmed at Quellenstra√üe in Munich. Charlie's school was filmed at Katholisches Pfarramt St. Sylvester, Biedersteiner Stra√üe 1 in Munich. Bill's Candy Shop was filmed at Lilienstra√üe, Munich. The closing sequence, in which the Wonkavator is flying above the factory, is footage of N√∂rdlingen, Bavaria, and the elevator rising shot showing that it shoots out of the factory was from B√∂√üeneckerstra√üe 4, 86720 N√∂rdlingen, Germany, now the location of a CAP-M√§rkte File:Wonka Factory2.JPGMunich Gasworks as it appeared in 2011 (building on the left) File:Wonka Factory.JPGMunich Gasworks as it appeared in 2011 (building on the right) File:Noerdlingen town hall from Daniel.jpgN√∂rdlingen, the town seen from above at the end of the film Production designer Harper Goff centered the factory on the massive Chocolate Room. According to Paris Themmen, who played Mike Teevee, \\"The river was made of water with food coloring. At one point, they poured some cocoa powder into it to try to thicken it but it didn't really work. When asked [what the river was made of], Michael B√∂llner, who played Augustus Gloop, answers, 'It vas dirty, stinking vater. In addition to the main scenes set in town and at the factory, several comic interludes were also shot. Uncredited screenwriter Robert Kaufman wrote several short humorous scenes related to the Wonka Bar hysteria. Stuart lamented in his book Pure Imagination: The Making of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, that his favorite scene was cut due to poor test screenings. In the scene, which took a lot of preparation and money to film, an English explorer climbs a holy mountain to ask a guru the meaning of life. The guru requests a Wonka Bar. Finding no golden ticket, he says, \\"Life is a disappointment.\\" Stuart loved the scene, but few laughed. He invited a psychologist friend to a preview, where again, the audience reaction was muted. The psychologist told him, \\"You don't understand, Mel. For a great many people, life is a disappointment.\\" When interviewed for the 30th anniversary special edition, Gene Wilder stated that he enjoyed working with most of the child actors, but said that he and the crew had some problems with Paris Themmen, claiming that he was \\"a handful\\". =Promotion= Before its release, the film received advance publicity through TV commercials offering a \\"Willy Wonka candy factory kit\\" for sending $1.00 and two seals from boxes of Quaker cereals such as King Vitaman, Life and any of the Cap'n Crunch brands. Release =Television= The film made its television debut on Thanksgiving Night, November 28, 1974 on NBC. The film was repeated the following year on November 23, 1975, on NBC. There was some controversy with the broadcast, as the Oakland Raiders vs Washington Redskins (26‚Äì23) Football game went into overtime, and the first 40 minutes of the movie were cut.\\"Raiders, NBC 0‚Äì2 in N.Y.; First Heidi, Now Willy Wonka\\". Los Angeles Times. November 24, 1975. p. C2. The film placed 19th in the TV ratings for the week ending November 23, beating out The Streets of San Francisco and Little House on the Prairie.\\"4 Movies Shake Up Week's Nielsen List\\". Los Angeles Times. November 26, 1975. p. 15. The next TV showing of the film was on May 2, 1976,\\"TV Guide Listings\\". Los Angeles Times. May 2, 1976. p. 10. where it placed 46th in the ratings. Some TV listings indicate the showing was part of the World of Disney time slot. =Home media= The film was first released on DVD in 1997/1999 in a \\"25th anniversary edition\\" as a double sided disc containing a widescreen and \\"standard\\" version. The \\"standard\\" version is an open matte print, where the mattes used to make the image widescreen are removed, revealing more picture at the top and bottom that was masked off from viewers. VHS and Betamax copies were also available, but only containing the \\"standard\\" version. A special edition DVD was released, celebrating the film's 30th anniversary, on August 28, 2001, but in full screen only. Due to the lack of a letterboxed release, fan petitioning eventually led Warner Home Video to issue a widescreen version on November 13, 2001. It was also released on VHS, with only one of the special features (a making-of feature). Several original cast members reunited to film documentary footage for this special edition DVD release. The two editions featured restored sound, and better picture quality. In addition to the documentary, the DVD included a trailer, a gallery, and audio commentary by the cast. In 2007, Warner Home Video released the film on HD DVD with all the bonus features from the 2001 DVD. The film was released on Blu-ray on October 20, 2009. It includes all the bonus features from the 2001 DVD and 2007 HD-DVD as well as a 38-page book. In 2011, a new deluxe-40th-anniversary edition Blu-ray/DVD set was released on November 1, consisting of the film on Blu-ray Disc and DVD as well as a bonus features disc. The set also included a variety of rarities such as a Wonka Bar-designed tin, four scented pencils, a scented eraser, a book detailing the making of the film, original production papers and a Golden Ticket to win a trip to Los Angeles. Reception Willy Wonka was released on June 30, 1971. The film was not a big success, being the 53rd highest-grossing film of the year in the U.S., earning just over $2.1 million on its opening weekend. However, it received generally positive reviews from critics. Roger Ebert gave the film a perfect four out of four stars, calling it: Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times praised the film as \\"lively and enjoyable\\" and called Wilder's performance \\"a real star turn\\", but thought the songs were \\"instantly forgettable\\" and that the factory looked \\"a lot more literal and industrial and less empathic than it might have\\".Champlin, Charles (July 28, 1971). \\"'Wonka' Fare for Families\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1, 10. Variety called the film \\"an okay family musical fantasy\\" that had \\"good\\" performances but lacked any tunes that were \\"especially rousing or memorable\\". Howard Thompson of The New York Times panned it as \\"tedious and stagy with little sparkle and precious little humor\\". Gene Siskel gave the film two stars out of four, writing, \\"Anticipation of what Wonka's factory is like is so well developed that its eventual appearance is a terrible letdown. Sure enough there is a chocolate river, but it looks too much like the Chicago River to be appealing. The quality of the color photography is flat. The other items in Wonka's factory ‚Äî bubblegum trees and lollypop flowers ‚Äî also look cheap. Nothing in the factory is appealing.\\"Siskel, Gene (July 18, 1971). \\"There's Gold in Willy Wonka Chocolate Bars\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 5, p. 1. Jan Dawson of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that after a slow start the second half of the film was \\"an unqualified delight‚Äîone of those rare, genuinely imaginative children's entertainments at which no adult need be embarrassed to be seen\\". By the mid-1980s, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory had experienced a spike in popularity thanks in large part to repeated television broadcasts and home video sales. Following a 25th anniversary theatrical re-release in 1996, it was released on DVD the next year, allowing it to reach a new generation of viewers. The film was released as a remastered special edition on DVD and VHS in 2001 to commemorate the film's 30th anniversary. In 2003, Entertainment Weekly ranked it 25th in the \\"Top 50 Cult Movies\\" of all time. The tunnel scene during the boat ride has been cited as the scariest of scenes in ‚Äúkids films‚Äù by many websites, due to its surreal visuals for their traumatizing nature. Willy Wonka was ranked No. 74 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments for the tunnel scene. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 90% approval rating and an average rating of 7.74/10 based on 48 reviews. The site's critical consensus states: \\"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is strange yet comforting, full of narrative detours that don't always work but express the film's uniqueness.\\" =Dahl's reaction= Dahl disowned the film, the script of which was partially rewritten by David Seltzer after Dahl did not meet deadlines. Dahl said he was \\"disappointed\\" because \\"he thought it placed too much emphasis on Willy Wonka and not enough on Charlie\\", as well as the casting of Gene Wilder instead of Spike Milligan. Dahl was also \\"infuriated\\" by the deviations in the plot Seltzer devised in his draft of the screenplay, including the conversion of Slugworth, a minor character in the book, into a spy (so that the film could have a villain) and the \\"fizzy lifting drinks\\" scene along with music other than the original Oompa Loompa compositions (including \\"Pure Imagination\\" and \\"The Candy Man\\"), and the ending dialogue for the film. In 1996, Dahl's second wife, Felicity, commented on her husband's objections towards the film saying \\"they always want to change a book's storyline. What makes Hollywood think children want the endings changed for a film, when they accept it in a book?\\" Music The Academy Award- nominated original score and songs were composed by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley, and musical direction was by Walter Scharf. The soundtrack was first released by Paramount Records in 1971. On October 8, 1996, Hip-O Records (in conjunction with MCA Records, which by then owned the Paramount catalog), released the soundtrack on CD as a \\"25th Anniversary Edition\\". In 2016, UMe and Geffen Records released a 45th Anniversary Edition LP.

In the 16th century the drink evolved into a cream, sugar and citrus-based confection, which is still consumed today as a cold set dessert similar to syllabub.  Introduction  Posset pot, Netherlands, Late 17th or early 18th century, Tin-glazed earthenware painted in blue V&A; Museum no. 3841-1901 Victoria and Albert Museum, London To make the drink, milk was heated to a boil, then mixed with wine or ale, which curdled it, and the mixture was usually spiced with nutmeg and cinnamon. It was considered a specific remedy for some minor illnesses, such as a cold, and a general remedy for others, as even today people drink hot milk to help them get to sleep.  History  A 1661 posset pot from England. The OED traces the word to the 15th century: various Latin vocabularies translate balducta, bedulta, or casius as \\"poshet\\", \\"poshoote\\", \\"possyt\\", or \\"possot\\". Russell's Boke of Nurture (c. 1460) lists various dishes and ingredients that \\"close a mannes stomak\\", including \\"√æe possate\\". Posset is frequently used as a starting point for other recipes (e.g. \\"Make a styf Poshote of Milke an Ale\\", and \\"Take cowe Mylke, & set it ouer √æe fyre, & √ærow √æer-on Saunderys, & make a styf poshotte of Ale\\", each of which is the first sentence of a longer recipe). Recipes for it appear in other 15th-century sources: boil milk, add either wine or ale \\"and no salt\\", let it cool, gather the curds and discard the whey, and season with ginger, sugar, and possibly \\"sweet wine\\" and candied anise. In 14th- and 15th-century cookery manuals, a possibly-related word spelled variously \\"possenet\\", \\"postnet\\", or \\"posnet\\" is used to mean a small pot or saucepan. In 16th-century and later sources, possets are generally made from lemon or other citrus juice, cream and sugar. Eggs are often added. Some recipes used breadcrumbs to thicken the beverage. \\"Posset sets\\" for mixing and serving possets were popular gifts, and valuable ones (often made of silver) were heirlooms. Such sets contained a posset \\"pot\\", or \\"bowl\\", or \\"cup\\" to serve it in, a container for mixing it in, and usually various containers for the ingredients, as well as spoons. The posset set that the Spanish ambassador gave Queen Mary I of England and King Philip II of Spain when they became betrothed in 1554 is believed to have been made by Benvenuto Cellini and is of crystal, gold, precious gems, and enamel. It is on display at Hatfield House in England and consists of a large, stemmed, covered bowl, two open, stemmed vessels, a covered container, three spoons, and two forks. The word \\"posset\\" is mostly used nowadays for a cold set dessert based on the 16th century version of the drink, containing cream and lemon, similar to syllabub. It is also used to refer to the semi-digested milk brought up by babies after a feed.  In popular culture  * Lady Macbeth uses poisoned possets to knock out the guards outside Duncan's quarters in William Shakespeare's Macbeth, Act II, Scene ii: :: The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms :: Do mock their charge with snores. I have drugg'd their possets :: That death and nature do contend about them, :: Whether they live or die. * David Balfour, the narrator in Robert Louis Stevenson's Kidnapped, makes a reference to possets in the sense of being pampered: :: \\"But I was by this time so weary that I could have slept twelve hours at a stretch; I had the taste of sleep in my throat; my joints slept even when my mind was waking; the hot smell of the heather, and the drone of the wild bees, were like possets to me; and every now and again I would give a jump and find I had been dozing.\\" * Kay Harker, of John Masefield's book The Box of Delights, takes a posset to help clear his head, on the advice of the local police inspector. The posset is said to be a jorum of hot milk, egg, treacle and nutmeg. * The Warden in Incarceron says that Claudia used to give her young, ailing tutor Jared sweetmeats and possets. This was used to illustrate how she only cares for Jared. * In The Silver Chair by C.S. Lewis, the queen of Harfang asks that one of the protagonists, Jill Pole, be given \\"...all you can think of‚Äîpossets and comfits and caraways and lullabies and toys.\\" * Mary Renault has Bagoas give Alexander the Great an egg posset with honey, wine and cheese to break a long fast in her novel The Persian Boy. * In the 2015 BBC dramatization of the Poldark novels, Verity Poldark notes that her duties include \\"[dosing] the servants with possets when they are ill.\\" * In the novel Chesapeake by James Michener, possets were served on the Eastern Shore before retiring, \\"for they were conducive to sleep and good digestion.\\" See also * Caudle * Eggnog * Hot toddy * List of hot beverages  Notes   References   * Milk-based drinks Historical alcoholic drinks Mixed drinks Hot drinks Traditional medicine ","title":"Posset"},{"id":"174568","text":"John Coney, and held at the Fogg Art Museum A caudle (or caudel) was a hot drink that recurred in various guises throughout British cuisine from the Middle Ages into Victorian times. It was thick and sweet, and seen as particularly suitable and sustaining for invalids and new mothers. At some periods of history, caudle recipes were based on milk and eggs, like eggnog. Later variants were more similar to a gruel, a sort of drinkable oatmeal porridge. Like the original forms of posset (a drink of wine and milk, rather than a set dessert), a caudle was usually alcoholic.  Etymology  A silver caudle spoon, Metropolitan Museum of Art The word caudle came into Middle English via the Old North French word caudel, ultimately derived from Latin caldus, \\"warm\\". The 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica states the word derived from Medieval Latin caldellum, a diminutive of caldum, a warm drink, from calidus, hot. The Oxford English Dictionary cites the use of the word to 1297. The word's etymological connection to heat makes it cognate with \\"cauldron\\".  Recipes  A related recipe for skyr, a cultured dairy product, appears in the early 13th century. The earliest surviving recipe for caudle, from 1300‚Äì1325, is simply a list of ingredients: wine, wheat starch, raisins, and sugar to \\"abate the strength of the wine\\". Another recipe from the late 14th century has more ingredients and more details on the cooking procedure: mix breadcrumbs, wine, sugar or honey, and saffron, bring to a boil, then thicken with egg yolks, and sprinkle with salt, sugar, and ginger. A 15th-century English cookbook includes three caudle recipes: ale or wine is heated and thickened with egg yolks and/or ground almonds, then optionally spiced with sugar, honey, saffron, and/or ginger (one recipe specifically says \\"no salt\\"). In a description of an initiation ceremony at Merton College, Oxford in 1647, caudle is described as a \\"syrupy gruel with spices and wine or ale added\\". William Carew Hazlitt provides a number of recipes for caudles and possets in his 1886 book, Old Cookery Books and Ancient Cuisine. The 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica describes it as \\"a drink of warm gruel, mixed with spice and wine, formerly given to women in childbed\\", i.e. as a restorative food during her postpartum confinement. Emily Post's 1922 Etiquette in Society, in Business, in Politics, and at Home, the classic guide to American manners, states that \\"although according to cook-books caudle is a gruel, the actual \\"caudle\\" invariably served at christenings is a hot eggnog, drunk out of little punch cups\\" (see Punch bowl).  \\"For the sick and lying-in\\" Aside from the initiation ceremony mentioned above, caudle was often served to people who were seen to need strengthening, especially invalids and new mothers. A historian of Georgian England says that maternity hospitals always served a \\"traditional postlabor fortified caudle\\" to women who had just given birth. The British Lying-In Hospital had \\"Laws, Orders, and Regulations\\" printed to be displayed on the wards, detailing among other things, the menu. Mothers on the \\"low diet\\" had caudle; when they graduated to the \\"common diet\\" it was beer caudle; and the \\"full diet\\" had no need of the invalid liquid any more. Maria Rundell included a \\"caudle for the sick and lying-in\\" in her best- selling A New System of Domestic Cookery (1806). (\\"Lying-in\\" is an obsolete term for childbirth, referring to the extended period of bed rest that marked the traditional recuperation time.) Judith Montefiore likewise included caudle with the \\"recipes for invalids\\" in her The Jewish Manual (1846), the first exposition of Jewish cuisine in English. Five years later, The English Housekeeper by Anne Cobbett (daughter of William Cobbett) gives variants of caudles, of either gruel (oatmeal) or rice, with different types of alcohol, and seasonings, including capillaire. She devotes a chapter to invalid food, making the point that \\"Often when the Doctor's skill has saved the life of his patient [...] it remains for the diligent nurse to prepare the cooling drinks and restorative foods [...]. Everything which is prepared for a sick person should be delicately clean, served quickly, in the nicest order; and in a small quantity at a time.\\" As a metonym Richard Dagley's illustration \\"Taking caudle\\" of Thomas Gaspey's poem. The new mother reclines in a four- poster bed, recouping her energy. A member of the household sits at the foot of the bed, entertaining a visitor, who keeps her bonnet on; both of them are drinking caudle. A maidservant shows the baby to the visitor, while a dog and cat look on. As caudel was served to new mothers to build up their strength, so it was offered to their visitors, to share in the happy occasion. \\"Cake and caudel\\" or \\"taking caudle\\" became the accepted phrases for a \\"lying-in visit\\", when women went to see their friends' new babies. These were all-female occasions, as more than one man noted. The American playwright Royall Tyler has one of the female characters in the comedy of manners The Contrast (1787) decline the offer of a man's escorting her by claiming that \\"half [her] visits are cake and caudel\\" and therefore unsuitable for him. A generation later in 1821, Thomas Gaspey wrote of these visits (with the italics in the original): Offering caudel, or cake and caudel, to all lying-in visitors is referred to as an old British custom. Queen Charlotte, consort of George III, bore him 15 princes and princesses. After the christening of the youngest, Princess Amelia in 1783, \\"the greater part of the company then paid a visit to the nursery, where they were entertained (as usual on such occasions) with cake and caudel.\\" This continued into Queen Victoria's reign: the day after she gave birth to the Prince of Wales, \\"many of the female Nobility called at Buckingham Palace, and were received by Lady Charlemont, the Lady in waiting, and after taking caudle were taken to the north wing to see the infant Prince.\\" But it was not just nobles who came. The Court Magazine and Belle Assembl√©e reported that the aftermath of a royal birth was \\"a usual reception of the public to cake and caudel\\". The London Chronicle reported in 1765 that \\"The resort of different ranks of people at St. James's to receive the Queen's Caudle is now very great.\\" Implements An earthenware caudle cup depicting King Charles II of England, so circa 1660, held at Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art There was a vessel particular to the drink, a caudle cup, a traditional gift for a pregnant woman, \\"which used to be handed round the young mother's chamber\\", according to Dr Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.. After the birth of Princess Augusta Sophia, sixth child of George III and Queen Charlotte: Other uses A caudle formed part of the Beltane (May Day) fire festival celebrations collated by James Frazier in The Golden Bough. He quotes at length Thomas Pennant, \\"who travelled in Perthshire in the year 1769\\": > on the first of May, the herdsmen of every village hold their Bel-tien, a > rural sacrifice. They cut a square trench on the ground, leaving the turf in > the middle; on that they make a fire of wood, on which they dress a large > caudle of eggs, butter, oatmeal and milk; and bring besides the ingredients > of the caudle, plenty of beer and whisky; for each of the company must > contribute something.

Frazier notes other Scottish May Day celebrations with similar dishes, \\"a repast of eggs and milk in the consistence of a custard\\". Apparently it was \\"a custom in France to bring the bridegroom a caudle in the middle of the night on his wedding-night\\", according to an explanatory note in an 1877 edition of The Essays of Montaigne, presumably inserted by the English editor, William Carew Hazlitt.

Niagara Escarpment (in red) Blue Mountains near Collingwood, Ontario The Niagara Escarpment is a long escarpment, or cuesta, in the United States and Canada that runs predominantly east/west from New York, through Ontario, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Illinois. The escarpment is most famous as the cliff over which the Niagara River plunges at Niagara Falls, for which it is named. The Escarpment is a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve. It has the oldest forest ecosystem and trees in eastern North America. The Escarpment is composed of an outcrop belt of the Lockport Formation of Silurian age, and is similar to the Onondaga Formation, which runs in a parallel outcrop belt just to the south, through western New York and southern Ontario. The Escarpment is the most prominent of several escarpments formed in the bedrock of the Great Lakes Basin. From its easternmost point near Watertown, New York,Lake Ontario Waterkeeper . Waterkeeper.ca (2010-12-03). Retrieved on 2013-07-26. the escarpment shapes in part the individual basins and landforms of Lakes Ontario, Huron, and Michigan. In Rochester, New York, three waterfalls over the escarpment are where the Genesee River flows through the city. The escarpment thence runs westward to the Niagara River, forming a deep gorge north of Niagara Falls, which itself cascades over the escarpment. In southern Ontario, it spans the Niagara Peninsula, closely following the Lake Ontario shore through the cities of St. Catharines, Hamilton, and Dundas, where it takes a sharp turn north in the town of Milton toward Georgian Bay. It then follows the Georgian Bay shore northwestwards to form the spine of the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island, as well as several smaller islands in northern Lake Huron, where it turns westwards into the Upper Peninsula of northern Michigan, south of Sault Ste. Marie. It then extends southwards into WisconsinJohn Luczaj, \\"Geology of the Niagara Escarpment in Wisconsin\\" following the Door Peninsula through the Bayshore Blufflands and then more inland from the western coast of Lake Michigan and Milwaukee, ending northwest of Chicago near the Wisconsin‚ÄìIllinois border.  Formation  Study of rock exposures and drillholes demonstrates that no displacement of the rock layers occurs at the escarpment: this is not a fault line but the result of unequal erosion. The escarpment's caprock is dolomitic limestone, also known as dolostone, which is more resistant and overlies weaker, more easily eroded shale as a weathering- resistant \\"cap\\". The escarpment thus formed over millions of years through a process of differential erosion of rocks of different hardnesses. Through time the soft rocks weather away or erode by the action of streams. The gradual removal of the soft rocks undercuts the resistant caprock, leaving a cliff or escarpment. The erosional process is most readily seen at Niagara Falls, where the river has quickened the process. It can also be seen at the three waterfalls of the Genesee River at Rochester (additional resistant rock layers make more than one escarpment in some places). Also, in some places thick glacial deposits, such as the Oak Ridges Moraine, conceal the Niagara Escarpment, such as north of Georgetown, Ontario, where it actually continues under glacial till and reappears farther north. The dolomite cap was laid down as sediment on the floor of a marine environment. In Michigan, behind (southwest of) the escarpment, the cuesta capstone slopes gently to form a wide basin, the floor of an Ordovician-Silurian-age tropical sea. (The escarpment is essentially the remnant shoreline of that sea.) There the constant deposition of minute shells and fragments of biologically-generated calcium carbonate, mixed with sediment washed in by erosion of the virtually lifeless landmasses, eventually formed a limestone layer. During the Silurian period, some magnesium substituted for some of the calcium in the carbonates, slowly forming harder dolomite layers in the same fashion. Worldwide sea levels were at their all-time maximum in the Ordovician; as the sea retreated, erosion inevitably began. This dolomite basin contains Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Erie. (The geological formations under Lakes Superior and Ontario were formed from volcanic rifts. Soft basalt lines their canyon walls, bottoming at 1300 feet below sea level.)  Human geography  The Welland Canal allows ships to traverse the escarpment between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario on the Niagara Peninsula of Ontario. The escarpment was a major obstacle in the construction of the Erie Canal in New York and was traversed by a series of locks; the community which grew up at the site thus became known as Lockport, New York. In southern Ontario, the Bruce Trail runs the length of the escarpment from Queenston on the Niagara River to Tobermory on the Bruce Peninsula. Highway 401, Canada's busiest, also crosses the Niagara Escarpment, beginning its long descent through rolling hills, farmland, and towns west of Milton. Rock exposed on the face of the escarpment can be seen along Highway 26 from Owen Sound eastwards towards Meaford, Ontario. Hamilton, Ontario is on the escarpment in such a way that the north end of the city is below and the south part above. Affectionately referred to as \\"The Mountain\\" by its residents, many roads or \\"mountain accesses\\" join the urban core below with the suburban expansion above. From 1892 to 1936, the Hamilton Incline Railway transported people up and down \\"The Mountain\\". High Cliff State Park in Wisconsin shows how modern and prehistoric humans used the escarpment for not only cultural reasons, but economic gains, as well. A number of different animal and geometric effigy mounds and the remains of an early 20th-century limestone quarry and kiln are within the park. The relief and exposed edge are used by several wind farms stretching from Pipe, to Brownsville in Wisconsin. Wind speeds average 18 mph (about 29 km/h) along this stretch. The Niagara Escarpment is a prominent feature just east of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, and it is known there as \\"The Ledge\\".Joanne Kluessendorf, \\"A look at The Ledge\\", Wisconsin Natural Resources magazine, October 2010. Some local organizations take their name from it, including The Ledgers, the sports teams at St. Mary's Springs Academy, which is perched on the side of the escarpment. Many resorts and ski areas in Ontario, Michigan, Wisconsin, and New York are along the escarpment.  Vineyard land  Niagara County, New York, near the eastern end of the escarpment, is the site of the Niagara Escarpment AVA (American Viticultural Area).Federal Register / Vol. 70, No. 173 / Thursday, September 8, 2005 / Rules and Regulations, page 53300 ‚Äì Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau 27 CFR Part 9 [T.D. TTB‚Äì33; Re: Notice No. 33 RIN 1513‚ÄìAA97. Establishment of the Niagara Escarpment Viticultural Area (2004R‚Äì589P) Wines produced in this region include traditional grape varieties such as Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, and Riesling, and fruit wines. Ontario's Niagara Peninsula is the site of the largest wine-producing appellation (region) in Canada. Cool-climate varieties such as Riesling, Chardonnay, Gamay Noir, Pinot Noir, and Cabernet Franc are among the more than 30 varietals produced across . Three subappellations lie along the benchlands of the Niagara Escarpment: Short Hills Bench, Twenty Mile Bench, and Beamsville Bench. Northeastern Wisconsin, at the western end of the escarpment, is the site of the Wisconsin Ledge AVA. Most of the region's vineyards lie upon the escarpment's eastern-facing slope that rise gently upward from the shores of Lake Michigan to the top of the Ledge, before dropping sharply off into Green Bay, and benefit greatly from constant air movement from Lake Michigan, which stores warmth during the summer. The presence of the lake produces a vacuum of sorts during the growing season: warm air over the lake rises, sucking colder air off the land and creating offshore breezes. Cold air cannot settle over the vineyards and a constant flow of warmer air makes the growing season here longer than in other parts of the state. The escarpment's glacial soils are made up of gravel, sand, and clay over limestone bedrock. An aquifer provides mineral-rich ground water to the vines, encouraging deep root growth.  World Biosphere Reserve  In February 1990, the Niagara Escarpment was a designated World Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO, making it one of 12 in Canada. Development and land use on and adjacent to the escarpment is regulated by the Niagara Escarpment Commission, an agency of the Ontario government. Cliffs along the Niagara Escarpment have the oldest forest ecosystem in eastern North America. The oldest tree in Ontario is an eastern white cedar from 688 A.D.. The oldest known tree in Wisconsin, a 1,300 year-old eastern white cedar, was found in Brown County.The oldest known tree in Wisconsin is a 1,300-year-old cedar growing from a cliff  See also  * Canadian Shield * Cheltenham Badlands * Oak Ridges Moraine * Onondaga Escarpment * Ontario Greenbelt *Golden Horseshoe  Notes   External links  * Niagara Escarpment Resource Network * Coalition on the Niagara Escarpment * The Niagara Escarpment: Wisconsin's eighth natural wonder * The Niagara Escarpment Legacy Project Geology of the United States Geological history of the Great Lakes Stratigraphy of Ontario Landforms of Niagara County, New York Landforms of New York (state) Landforms of Illinois Landforms of Michigan Landforms of Wisconsin Escarpments of Canada Escarpments of the United States Golden Horseshoe Biosphere reserves of Canada Niagara Falls Landforms of Ontario ","title":"Niagara Escarpment"},{"id":"174576","text":"Diagram showing a transform fault with two plates moving in opposite directions Transform fault (the red lines) A transform fault or transform boundary is a fault along a plate boundary where the motion is predominantly horizontal. It ends abruptly where it connects to another plate boundary, either another transform, a spreading ridge, or a subduction zone. Most such faults are found in oceanic crust, where they accommodate the lateral offset between segments of divergent boundaries, forming a zigzag pattern. This is a result of oblique seafloor spreading where the direction of motion is not perpendicular to the trend of the overall divergent boundary. A smaller number of such faults are found on land, although these are generally better-known, such as the San Andreas Fault. A transform fault is a special case of a strike-slip fault that also forms a plate boundary. Nomenclature Transform boundaries are also known as conservative plate boundaries because they involve no addition or loss of lithosphere at the Earth's surface.  Background  Geophysicist and geologist John Tuzo Wilson recognized that the offsets of oceanic ridges by faults do not follow the classical pattern of an offset fence or geological marker in Reid's rebound theory of faulting,Reid, H.F., (1910). The Mechanics of the Earthquake. in The California Earthquake of April 18, 1906, Report of the State Earthquake Investigation Commission, Carnegie Institution of Washington, Washington D.C. from which the sense of slip is derived. The new class of faults, called transform faults, produce slip in the opposite direction from what one would surmise from the standard interpretation of an offset geological feature. Slip along transform faults does not increase the distance between the ridges it separates; the distance remains constant in earthquakes because the ridges are spreading centers. This hypothesis was confirmed in a study of the fault plane solutions that showed the slip on transform faults points in the opposite direction than classical interpretation would suggest.Sykes, L.R. (1967). Mechanism of earthquakes and nature of faulting on the mid-oceanic ridges, Journal of Geophysical Research, 72, 5‚Äì27. Difference between transform and transcurrent faults Transform faults are closely related to transcurrent faults and are commonly confused. Both types of fault are strike-slip or side-to-side in movement; nevertheless, transform faults always end at a junction with another plate boundary, while transcurrent faults may die out without a junction with another fault. Finally, transform faults form a tectonic plate boundary, while transcurrent faults do not. Mechanics The effect of a fault is to relieve strain, which can be caused by compression, extension, or lateral stress in the rock layers at the surface or deep in the Earth's subsurface. Transform faults specifically relieve the strain by transferring displacement between ridges or subduction zones. They also act as the plane of weakness, which may result in splitting in rift zones. Examples Transform faults are commonly found linking segments of mid-oceanic ridges or spreading centres. These mid-oceanic ridges are where new seafloor is constantly created through the upwelling of new basaltic magma. With new seafloor being pushed and pulled out, the older seafloor slowly slides away from the mid-oceanic ridges toward the continents. Although separated only by tens of kilometers, this separation between segments of the ridges causes portions of the seafloor to push past each other in opposing directions. This lateral movement of seafloors past each other is where transform faults are currently active. Spreading center and strips Transform faults move differently from a strike-slip fault at the mid-oceanic ridge. Instead of the ridges moving away from each other, as they do in other strike-slip faults, transform-fault ridges remain in the same, fixed locations, and the new ocean seafloor created at the ridges is pushed away from the ridge. Evidence of this motion can be found in paleomagnetic striping on the seafloor. A paper written by geophysicist Taras Gerya theorizes that the creation of the transform faults between the ridges of the mid-oceanic ridge is attributed to rotated and stretched sections of the mid-oceanic ridge. This occurs over a long period of time with the spreading center or ridge slowly deforming from a straight line to a curved line. Finally, fracturing along these planes forms transform faults. As this takes place, the fault changes from a normal fault with extensional stress to a strike-slip fault with lateral stress. In the study done by Bonatti and Crane, peridotite and gabbro rocks were discovered in the edges of the transform ridges. These rocks are created deep inside the Earth's mantle and then rapidly exhumed to the surface. This evidence helps to prove that new seafloor is being created at the mid-oceanic ridges and further supports the theory of plate tectonics. Active transform faults are between two tectonic structures or faults. Fracture zones represent the previously active transform-fault lines, which have since passed the active transform zone and are being pushed toward the continents. These elevated ridges on the ocean floor can be traced for hundreds of miles and in some cases even from one continent across an ocean to the other continent. The most prominent examples of the mid-oceanic ridge transform zones are in the Atlantic Ocean between South America and Africa. Known as the St. Paul, Romanche, Chain, and Ascension fracture zones, these areas have deep, easily identifiable transform faults and ridges. Other locations include: the East Pacific Ridge located in the South Eastern Pacific Ocean, which meets up with San Andreas Fault to the North. Transform faults are not limited to oceanic crust and spreading centers; many of them are on continental margins. The best example is the San Andreas Fault on the Pacific coast of the United States. The San Andreas Fault links the East Pacific Rise off the West coast of Mexico (Gulf of California) to the Mendocino Triple Junction (Part of the Juan de Fuca plate) off the coast of the Northwestern United States, making it a ridge-to-transform-style fault. The formation of the San Andreas Fault system occurred fairly recently during the Oligocene Period between 34 million and 24 million years ago. During this period, the Farallon plate, followed by the Pacific plate, collided into the North American plate. The collision led to the subduction of the Farallon plate underneath the North American plate. Once the spreading center separating the Pacific and the Farallon plates was subducted beneath the North American plate, the San Andreas Continental Transform-Fault system was created. Southern Alps rise dramatically beside the Alpine Fault on New Zealand's West Coast. About 500 kilometres (300 mi) long; northwest at top. In New Zealand, the South Island's alpine fault is a transform fault for much of its length. This has resulted in the folded land of the Southland Syncline being split into an eastern and western section several hundred kilometres apart. The majority of the syncline is found in Southland and The Catlins in the island's southeast, but a smaller section is also present in the Tasman District in the island's northwest. Other examples include: * Middle East's Dead Sea Transform fault * Pakistan's Chaman Fault * Turkey's North Anatolian Fault * North America's Queen Charlotte Fault * Myanmar's Sagaing Fault Types In his work on transform-fault systems, geologist Tuzo Wilson said that transform faults must be connected to other faults or tectonic-plate boundaries on both ends; because of that requirement, transform faults can grow in length, keep a constant length, or decrease in length. These length changes are dependent on which type of fault or tectonic structure connect with the transform fault. Wilson described six types of transform faults: Growing length: In situations where a transform fault links a spreading center and the upper block of a subduction zone or where two upper blocks of subduction zones are linked, the transform fault itself will grow in length. Spreading to upper NEW Upper to upper Constant length: In other cases, transform faults will remain at a constant length. This steadiness can be attributed to many different causes. In the case of ridge-to-ridge transforms, the constancy is caused by the continuous growth by both ridges outward, canceling any change in length. The opposite occurs when a ridge linked to a subducting plate, where all the lithosphere (new seafloor) being created by the ridge is subducted, or swallowed up, by the subduction zone. Finally, when two upper subduction plates are linked there is no change in length. This is due to the plates moving parallel with each other and no new lithosphere is being created to change that length. Spreading centers constant Upper to down NEW Decreasing length faults: In rare cases, transform faults can shrink in length. These occur when two descending subduction plates are linked by a transform fault. In time as the plates are subducted, the transform fault will decrease in length until the transform fault disappears completely, leaving only two subduction zones facing in opposite directions.

As a region, this term most often refers to the coastal states of California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. More specifically, it refers to an area defined on the east by the Alaska Range, Cascade Range, Sierra Nevada, and Mojave Desert, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. The United States Census groups the five states of California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii together as the Pacific States division. Population As of the 2010 Census, the estimated population of the Census Bureau's Pacific Region was approximately 47.8 million ‚Äì about 15.3% of U.S. population.

Small isolated groups of hunter- gatherers migrated alongside herds of large herbivores far into Alaska. Between 16,500 BCE and 13,500 BCE (18,500‚Äì15,500 years ago), ice-free corridors developed along the Pacific coast and valleys of North America and possibly by sea. Alaska Natives, indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, and California indigenous peoples eventually descended from the Paleo- Indians. They developed various languages and established trade routes. Later, Spanish, British, French, Russian, and American explorers and settlers began colonizing the area. Climate The West Coast of the United States has an oceanic climate in its Northwestern, Northern, and Eastern edge towards the U.S.-Canada border, but from the California border towards the U.S.-Mexico border the climate is mediterranean. The coastline sees significantly mild temperatures when compared to the inland areas during summer. In far Northern California there is a difference of 17 ¬∞C (30 ¬∞F) between Eureka and Willow Creek in spite of only 25 miles (40 km) separating the locations and Willow Creek being located at a elevation. Slightly narrower fluctuations can be seen all through the coastline, and could partially be explained by the cold currents in the Pacific Ocean moderating coastal temperatures and the mountain ranges blocking the maritime air from moving farther inland than its foothills during summer. Coastal fog is also prevalent in keeping shoreline temperatures cool. This does not only occur in the San Francisco Bay Area, but it also affects Santa Monica in Los Angeles, Southern California, with very little yearly temperature differences but with cool summers similar to those expected in Northern Europe. A short journey inland and summer temperatures are comparable with the rest of the United States on the same latitudes, sometimes warmer due to prevailing winds from the Nevada and Arizona hot desert climate. Culture Since the West Coast has been populated by immigrants and their descendants more recently than the East Coast, its culture is considerably younger. Additionally, its demographic composition underlies its cultural difference from the rest of the United States. California's history first as a major Spanish colony, and later Mexican territory, has given the lower West Coast a distinctive Hispanic American tone, which it also shares with the rest of the Southwest. Similarly, two of the three cities in which Asian Americans have concentrated, San Francisco and Los Angeles, are located on the West Coast, with significant populations in other West Coast cities. San Francisco's Chinatown, the oldest in North America, is a noted cultural center. The West Coast also has a proportionally large share of green cities within the United States, which manifests itself in different cultural practices such as bicycling and organic gardening. In the Pacific Northwest, Portland and Seattle are both considered among the coffee capitals of the world. While Starbucks originated in Seattle, both cities are known for small- scale coffee roasters and independent coffeeshops. The culture has also been significantly shaped by the environment, especially by its forests, mountains, and rain. This may account for the fact that the Northwest has many high- quality libraries and bookshops (most notably Powell's Books and the Seattle Central Library) and a \\"bibliophile soul\\". The region also has a marginal, but growing independence movement based on bioregionalism and a Cascadian identity. The Cascadian flag has become a popular image at Seattle Sounders and Portland Timbers games. Alaska is widely known for its outdoors and its inhabitants engage in a range of activities which are unique to the state. Some of these activities can be experienced through the state's annual events, such as the Iron Dog snowmobile race from Anchorage to Nome and on to Fairbanks. Other events include the World Ice Art Championships (Fairbanks) and the Sitka Whalefest (Sitka).

Union Pacific Railroad Co., 240 U.S. 1 (1916), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the validity of a tax statute called the Revenue Act of 1913, also known as the Tariff Act, Ch. 16, 38 Stat. 166 (October 3, 1913), enacted pursuant to Article I, section 8, clause 1 of, and the Sixteenth Amendment to, the United States Constitution, allowing a federal income tax. The Sixteenth Amendment had been ratified earlier in 1913. The Revenue Act of 1913 imposed income taxes that were not apportioned among the states according to each state's population. Background Prior to 1895, all income taxes had been considered indirect taxes (not required to be apportioned among the states according to the population of each state). In the controversial 1895 case of Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., however, the Court had overturned longstanding precedent and ruled that while a tax on income from labor was an excise, or indirect tax (which was not required to be apportioned), a tax on income derived from property such as interest, dividends, or rents was or should be treated as a direct tax. Facts in the Brushaber case The plaintiff in this case, Frank R. Brushaber, was a shareholder in the defendant Union Pacific Railroad company. The Sixteenth Amendment had recently been passed, and the U.S. Congress had enacted legislation pursuant to the amendment assessing taxes to the wealthiest of income earners, including the railroad company in this case. Brushaber brought a lawsuit against the railroad company for an injunction to stop the company from paying the tax. Brushaber's contention was that statute enacting the tax violated the Fifth Amendment's prohibition on the government taking property without due process of law and that the statute also violated due process by exempting certain kinds of income. He also argued because the tax was not apportioned among the states according to population, it was unconstitutional. The U.S. government filed a brief supporting the validity of the tax. Holdings In an 8‚Äì0 decision (Justice James Clark McReynolds did not participate in the decision), the Court held, in an opinion written by Chief Justice Edward Douglass White, that the Sixteenth Amendment removes the requirement that income taxes be apportioned among the states according to population (Article I, Section 9, clause 4 of the U.S. Constitution). The Revenue Act of 1913, imposing income taxes that are not apportioned among the states according to each state's population, is constitutional. The Court stated: \\"...there can be no dispute that there was power by virtue of the Amendment during that period to levy the tax, without apportionment, and so far as the limitations of the Constitution in other respects are concerned, the contention is not open....\\"Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., 240 U.S. 1, at 20 (1916) (\\"Brushaber\\"). The Court also held that the Revenue Act does not violate the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against the government taking property without due process of law. The Court stated: \\"So far as the due process clause of the 5th Amendment is relied upon [by Mr. Frank Brushaber], it suffices to say that there is no basis for such reliance, since it is equally well settled that such clause is not a limitation upon the taxing power conferred upon Congress by the Constitution....\\"Brushaber, 240 U.S. 1, at 24 (1916). The Court further held that the Revenue Act does not violate the uniformity clause of Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution. The Court stated: \\"So far as these numerous and minute, not to say in many respects hypercritical, contentions [by Mr. Frank Brushaber] are based upon an assumed violation of the uniformity clause, their want of legal merit is at once apparent, since it is settled that that clause exacts only a geographical uniformity, and there is not a semblance of ground in any of the propositions [by Mr. Brushaber] for assuming that a violation of such uniformity is complained of.\\"Brushaber, 240 U.S. 1, at 24 (1916). Discussion In Brushaber the Court noted that even before the Sixteenth Amendment was passed, the Congress had authority to tax income. If a particular income tax was a direct tax or was treated as a direct tax in the constitutional sense, that tax could be imposed (after Pollock but before the passage of the Amendment) only by apportionment among the states, according to their census populations. In Brushaber, the Court held that the Sixteenth Amendment eliminated the requirement of apportionment as it relates to \\"taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived.\\" Subsequent interpretation Tax law professor Boris Bittker and his co-authors have stated: > As construed by the Supreme Court in the Brushaber case, the power of > Congress to tax income derives from Article I, Section 8, Clause 1, of the > original Constitution rather than from the Sixteenth Amendment; the latter > simply eliminated the requirement (Article I, section 9, clause 4 of the US > Constitution) that an income tax, to the extent that it is a direct tax, > must be apportioned among the states.Boris I.

No income tax enacted by the US Congress (either before or after the Sixteenth Amendment) has ever been apportioned among the states by population. All income taxes enacted after the Amendment have been treated as excises (they have been imposed with geographic uniformity but have not been required to be apportioned). Since the income tax may be imposed on income from whatever source and without regard to any apportionment requirement (by virtue of the wording of the 16th Amendment), an income tax cannot be treated as a direct tax (as income taxes on income from property were so treated in the Pollock case). Essentially, all income taxes after the Sixteenth Amendment are again treated as indirect taxes. Subsequent lower court cases have interpreted the Brushaber decision (\\"the confusion is not inherent, but rather arises from the conclusion ... this erroneous assumption\\") and the Sixteenth Amendment as standing for the rule that the Amendment allows a direct tax on \\"wages, salaries, commissions, etc. without apportionment.\\"Parker v. Commissioner, 724 F.2d 469, 84-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 9209 (5th Cir. 1984) (closing parenthesis in original has been omitted). For other court decisions upholding the taxability of wages, salaries, etc., on various grounds, see United States v. Connor, 898 F.2d 942, 90-1 U.S. Tax Cas.

(CCH) paragr. 50,289 (6th Cir. 2004), cert. denied,  U.S.  (2005); Granzow v. Commissioner, 739 F.2d 265, 84-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 9660 (7th Cir. 1984); Waters v. Commissioner, 764 F.2d 1389, 85-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 9512 (11th Cir. 1985); United States v. Buras, 633 F.2d 1356, 81-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 9126 (9th Cir. 1980). Geographical uniformity The Court in Brushaber noted that income taxes inherently belonged in the \\"category\\" of indirect tax (or excise). The court stated that incomes taxes are indirect excise taxes by reinforcing the Pollock decision: > As this conclusion but enforced a regulation as to the mode of exercising > power under particular circumstances, it did not in any way dispute the all- > embracing taxing authority possessed by Congress, including necessarily > therein the power to impose income taxes if only they conformed to the > constitutional regulations which were applicable to them. Moreover, in > addition, the conclusion reached in the Pollock Case did not in any degree > involve holding that income taxes generically and necessarily came within > the class of direct taxes on property, but, on the contrary, recognized the > fact that taxation on income was in its nature an excise... Indeed, that had been the understanding with respect to all income taxes until the Pollock decision. The Sixteenth Amendment removed the need imposed by the Pollock decision to determine whether an income tax in any particular case was required to be apportioned, as the Congress could again (after 1913) tax income from any source without having to apportion the tax according to population. Property taxes and capitations Nothing in the Sixteenth Amendment or in Brushaber (and the other cases interpreting the tax provisions of the U.S. Constitution) changes the general rule that direct taxes are still required to be apportioned among the states by population. For example, if the US Congress were to enact a national property tax (a property tax or other tax by reason of its ownership) or a national capitation (a poll tax or head tax), such taxes would be required to be apportioned.

It is most famous for its Nontrinitarian Christology but contains a number of other unorthodox beliefs as well. Origins The ideas of Socinianism date from the wing of the Protestant Reformation known as the Radical Reformation and have their root in the Italian Anabaptist movement of the 1540s, such as the anti-trinitarian Council of Venice in 1550. Lelio Sozzini was the first of the Italian Antitrinitarians to go beyond Arian beliefs in print and deny the pre- existence of Christ in his Brevis explicatio in primum Johannis caput ‚Äì a commentary on the meaning of the Logos in John 1:1‚Äì15 (1562).Wulfert De Greef, The writings of John Calvin: an introductory guide, 2008. Quote: \\"Lelio Sozzini's Brevis explicatio in primum Johannis caput appeared in 1561, which marked the beginning of the Socinian phase among the Italian.\\" Lelio Sozzini considered that the \\"Beginning\\" of John was the same as 1 John and referred to the new creation, not the Genesis creation. His nephew Fausto Sozzini published his own longer Brevis explicatio later, developing his uncle's arguments. Many years after the death of his uncle in Switzerland, Fausto Sozzini consulted with the Unitarian Church in Transylvania, attempting to mediate in the dispute between Giorgio Biandrata and Ferenc D√°vid. He moved to Poland, where he married the daughter of a leading member of the Polish Brethren, the anti-trinitarian minority, or ecclesia minor. In 1565, it had split from the Calvinist Reformed Church in Poland. Sozzini never joined the ecclesia minor, but he was influential in reconciling several controversies among the Brethren: on conscientious objection, on prayer to Christ, and on the virgin birth. Fausto persuaded many in the Polish Brethren who were formerly Arian, such as Marcin Czechowic, to adopt his uncle Lelio's views. Fausto Sozzini furthered his influence through his Racovian Catechism, published posthumously, which set out his uncle Lelio's views on Christology and replaced earlier catechisms of the Ecclesia Minor. His influence continued after his death through the writings of his students published in Polish and Latin from the press of the Racovian Academy at Rak√≥w, Kielce County. The name \\"Socinian\\" started to be used in Holland and England from the 1610s onward, as the Latin publications were circulated among early Arminians, Remonstrants, Dissenters, and early English Unitarians. In the late 1660s, Fausto Sozzini's grandson Andreas Wiszowaty and great-grandson Benedykt Wiszowaty published the nine-volume Biblioteca Fratrum Polonorum quos Unitarios vocant (1668) in Amsterdam, along with the works of F. Sozzini, the Austrian Johann Ludwig von Wolzogen, and the Poles Johannes Crellius, Jonasz Szlichtyng, and Samuel Przypkowski. These books circulated among English and French thinkers, including Isaac Newton, John Locke, Voltaire, and Pierre Bayle. In Britain and North America, \\"Socinianism\\" later became a catch-all term for any kind of dissenting belief. Sources in the 18th and 19th centuries frequently attributed the term \\"Socinian\\" anachronistically, using it to refer to ideas that embraced a much wider range than the narrowly defined position of the Racovian catechisms and library. Beliefs Socinian theology, as summarised in the Racovian Catechism, rejected the views of orthodox Christian theology on God's knowledge, on the doctrine of the Trinity and the divinity of Christ, and on soteriology. =Christology= The Racovian publications, like the Sozzinis, rejected the pre-existence of Christ and held that Jesus Christ did not exist until he was conceived of the virgin birth as a human being. This view had been put forward before by the 4th-century bishop Photinus, but it differed from the mainline Protestant, Eastern Orthodox, and Catholic views, which hold that the Logos referred to in the Gospel of John was God, thus is uncreated and eternal. =Human nature= The Socinians held that humans were created mortal in the beginning and would have died naturally whether Adam and Eve had eaten from the tree or not.\\"[Man] was originally created mortal; that is, was so constituted that he was not only by nature capable of dying, but also, if left to himself, could not but die.\\" The Racovian Catechism (English trans. Thomas Rees, London 1818), p. 20. They also rejected the doctrine of original sin.\\"The fall of Adam, as it was but one act, could not have power to deprave his own nature, much less that of his posterity.\\" The Racovian Catechism (English trans. Thomas Rees, London 1818), p. 326. =Atonement= Socinianism also rejected the propitiatory view of atonement.\\"Did not Christ die also, in order, properly speaking, to purchase our salvation, and literally to pay the debt of our sins? Although Christians at this time commonly so believe, yet this notion is false, erroneous, and exceedingly pernicious; since they conceive that Christ suffered an equivalent punishment for our sins, and by the price of his obedience exactly compensated our disobedience.\\" The Racovian Catechism (English trans. Thomas Rees, London 1818), pp. 303‚Äì304. =Predestination and omniscience= The Socinians believed that God's omniscience was limited to what was a necessary truth in the future (what would definitely happen) and did not apply to what was a contingent truth (what might happen). They believed that, if God knew every possible future, human free will was impossible and as such rejected the \\"hard\\" view of omniscience.The Racovian Catechism (English trans. Thomas Rees, London 1818), pp. 332‚Äì346. =Skepticism= Later writers such as Archibald Alexander Hodge (1823‚Äì86) asserted that Socinian theology was rooted in skepticism. However, the original Polish Socinians were believers in miracles, and the virgin birth,G. C. Berkouwer ‚Äì 1954 The Person of Christ ‚Äì Page 22 \\"The full consequences of this criticism, it is true, were not accepted in all respects, for the Socinians still believed that Christ was supernaturally begotten by way of the virgin birth, but the results of their criticism would soonColeridge, philosophy and religion: Aids to reflection and the ... ‚Äì Page 232 Douglas Hedley ‚Äì 2000 \\"Socinian theology was severely critical of traditional dogmas.

Before F. Sozzini's arrival in Poland, there had been a wide range of positions from the total otherworldiness, common property, and withdrawal from the state of Marcin Czechowic of Lublin through to the advocacy of military service by Symon Budny. The next generation of Polish Brethren stabilized between these two positions, carrying wooden swords to follow the letter of the law and allowing senior Socinians such as Hieronim Moskorzowski to vote in the Sejm.Brook P. \\"Conscientious objection\\" Offshoots of Socinians The direct doctrinal descendants of the original Socinians are the Unitarian Christians of Transylvania and England. Although the Polish Brethren never adopted the name \\"Unitarian\\" while in Poland, when they were disbanded in 1658, those who fled to Holland eventually embraced the term \\"Unitarian\\" (which they got from the Transylvanians), as they preferred not to be called \\"Socinians\\".Earl Morse Wilbur, A History of Unitarianism, vol. 2, pp. 47‚Äì48. The term had been used by the Unitarian Church of Transylvania as early as 1600. Socinian theology continued in Transylvania, where Polish exiles such as Andrzej Wiszowaty Jr., taught in the Unitarian College (1726‚Äì1740), as evidenced in the Summa Universae Theologiae Christianae secundum Unitarios of Mih√°ly Lombard de Szent√°brah√°m, recognized as the statement of faith of the Unitarian Church of Transylvania by Emperor Joseph II in 1782. Early English Unitarians such as Henry Hedworth and John Biddle retroactively applied the term \\"Unitarian\\" to the Polish Brethren. By 1676 there were at least three Socinian meeting houses in London, even if the Act of Toleration of 1689 saw Socinians and Catholics excluded from official recognition. Socinian ideas continued to have significant influence on Unitarians in England throughout the entire period of their development. Modern Socinians (in Christological terms) include the small number of \\"Biblical Unitarian\\" churches such as the Christadelphians, the Church of God General Conference and the Church of the Blessed Hope,Wilson Sects and Society Page 223 \\"7 The distinction of Christadelphian teaching from a unitarian position is apparent, although it shares much common ground with a Socinian or Arian position, yet with some differences.

Research published in 2002 indicates that they are more likely a result of Aeolian processes.Cione et al., 2002  Discovery  In 1990, Captain Ruben Lianza of the Argentine Air Force, an amateur astronomer, provided a report to an astronomy publication that included aerial pictures of a set of odd teardrop-shaped depressions near the city of R√≠o Cuarto, C√≥rdoba in north-central Argentina. The depressions seemed very similar to the sets of craters produced in laboratory simulations of impacts taking place at low angles. Such features exist on the Moon, Mars, and Venus, but had not been seen on Earth up to that time. The depressions had long been known to Argentine geologists, but until Lianza, nobody had seriously investigated them. Samples of materials obtained from the depressions indicated the presence of shocked materials, as well as pebbles that were clearly of meteoritic origin . A team of American researchers went to Argentina to investigate, collaborating with Captain Lianza and Argentine academics to study the strange depressions. There were ten depressions, four of them of substantial size. One depression, named the \\"Drop\\", was about wide and long. Two more large depressions, the \\"Eastern Twin\\" and \\"Western Twin\\", both about wide and long, were located to the northeast. Another major depression, the \\"Northern Basin\\", about half and again as big as one of the Twins, was sited 11 kilometers further to the northeast. The long axes of the depressions all point to the northeast.  Impact origin theory  The depressions were thought to be due to a grazing impact of a set of objects at a very low angle, which calculations show to be a rare occurrence. Most impacts will strike at an angle of 45 degrees to the horizontal or greater, and the impact craters will always be close to circular, since the shock wave that results from the impact propagates symmetrically. A grazing impact, however, will form an elliptical crater, with sprays of debris that look like butterfly wings. This has been confirmed by high-velocity guns used for impact experiments, and more recently by computer simulations. On impact, the object may shed chunks of itself that fly further downrange to perform secondary impacts. Based upon physical and numerical modeling, proponents R√≠o Cuarto event suggest that the object struck at an angle of no more than 15 degrees from the horizontal, with the impact itself having 10 times more explosive energy than the Barringer Crater event and 30 times more than the Tunguska event. Although the age of the depressions has not yet been determined precisely, it is believed by some researchers they are about 10,000 years old, placing them at the start of the Holocene, though the EID gives a broader age of less than 100,000 years old.  Aeolian origin theory  Satellite surveys of the area have found more than 400 similar oval features in the area, and studies of the layers of rock show no evidence of raised rims. These studies point to the oval features as being dune formations, aligned to the prevailing northeast wind.Acevedo et al., 2011 There is no doubt that there is impact material in the form of glassy impactite and shocked quartz in the R√≠o Cuarto structures. The age of this material has been questioned, and estimated to more than 500,000 BP, from an unknown source crater. There may have been a second, more recent event at around 10,000 BP which produced a second layer of impactite glass.

Greek philosophers such as Porphyry, who claimed influence from Platonism,Cumont, Franz (1911), The Oriental Religions in Roman Paganism, Chapter VI: Persia, p. 267 at sacred-texts.com and the fathers of the Christian Church, held that the world was pervaded with spirits, the latter of whom advanced the belief that demons received the worship directed at pagan gods.Augustine, The City of God , Book 8, Chapters 24-25, at the Christian Classics Ethereal Library Character of the spiritual world The ascription of malevolence to the world of spirits is by no means universal. In Central Africa, the Mpongwe believe in local spirits, just as do the Inuit; but they are regarded as inoffensive in the main.

Yet just as gods are not necessarily spiritual, demons may also be regarded as corporeal; vampires for example are sometimes described as human heads with appended entrails, which issue from the tomb to attack the living during the night watches. The so-called Spectre Huntsman of the Malay Peninsula is said to be a man who scours the firmament with his dogs, vainly seeking for what he could not find on Earth: a buck mouse-deer pregnant with male offspring; but he seems to be a living man; there is no statement that he ever died, nor yet that he is a spirit. The incubi and succubi of the Middle Ages are sometimes regarded as spiritual beings; but they were held to give proof of their bodily existence, such as offspring (though often deformed).Masello, Robert, Fallen Angels and Spirits of The Dark, pp. 64-68, 2004, The Berkley Publishing Group, 200 Madison Ave. New York, NY 10016, Belief in demons goes back many millennia. The Zoroastrian faith teaches that there are 3,333 Demons, some with specific dark responsibilities such as war, starvation, sickness, etc. =Ancient Mesopotamian religion= Ancient Sumerian cylinder seal impression showing the god Dumuzid being tortured in the underworld by galla demons The ancient Mesopotamians believed that the underworld (Kur) was home to many demons, which are sometimes referred to as \\"offspring of arali\\". These demons could sometimes leave the underworld and terrorize mortals on earth. One class of demons that were believed to reside in the underworld were known as galla; their primary purpose appears to have been to drag unfortunate mortals back to Kur. They are frequently referenced in magical texts, and some texts describe them as being seven in number. Several extant poems describe the galla dragging the god Dumuzid into the underworld. Like other demons, however, galla could also be benevolent and, in a hymn from King Gudea of Lagash ( 2144 ‚Äì 2124 BCE), a minor god named Ig-alima is described as \\"the great galla of Girsu\\". Demons had no cult in Mesopotamian religious practice since demons \\"know no food, know no drink, eat no flour offering and drink no libation.\\"cf. line 295 in \\"Inanna's descent into the nether world\\" =Abrahamic religions= Christianity Christian demonology is the study of demons from a Christian point of view. It is primarily based on the Bible (Old Testament and New Testament), the exegesis of scriptures, the writings of early Christian philosophers and hermits, tradition, and legends incorporated from other beliefs. Some scholars suggest the origins of early Greek Old Testament demonology can be traced to two distinctive and often competing mythologies of evil ‚Äì Adamic and Enochic, one of which was tied to the fall of man caused by Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and the other to the fall of angels in the antediluvian period.A. Orlov, Dark Mirrors: Azazel and Satanael in Early Jewish Demonology (Albany, SUNY, 2011) 6. Thus, the Adamic story traces the source of evil to Satan's transgression and the fall of man, a trend reflected in the Books of Adam and Eve which explains the reason for Satan's demotion by his refusal to obey God's command to venerate newly created Adam. In contrast, the early Enochic tradition bases its understanding of the origin of demons on the story of the fallen Watchers led by Azazel. Scholars believe these two enigmatic figures - Azazel and Satan exercised formative influence on early Jewish demonology. While in the beginning of their conceptual journeys Azazel and Satan are posited as representatives of two distinctive and often rival trends tied to the distinctive etiologies of corruption, in later Jewish and Christian demonological lore both antagonists are able to enter each other's respective stories in new conceptual capacities. In these later traditions Satanael is often depicted as the leader of the fallen angels while his conceptual rival Azazel is portrayed as a seducer of Adam and Eve.A. Orlov, Dark Mirrors: Azazel and Satanael in Early Jewish Demonology (Albany, SUNY, 2011) 7. While historical Judaism never recognized any set of doctrines about demons, scholars believe its post-exilic concepts of eschatology, angelology, and demonology were influenced by Zoroastrianism.Zoroastrianism, NET Bible Study DictionaryJahanian, Daryoush, M.D., \\"The Zoroastrian-Biblical Connections,\\" at meta-religion.com Some, however, believe these concepts were received as part of the Kabbalistic tradition.Franck, Adolphe (1843), translated by Sossnitz, I. (1926), The Kabbalah, or, The Religious Philosophy of the Hebrews, Part Two, Chapter IV, \\"Continuation of The Analysis of The Zohar: The Kabbalists' View of The World,\\" p. 184 at sacred-texts.com While many people believe today Lucifer and Satan are different names for the same being, not all scholars subscribe to this view.Davidson, Gustav (1967), A Dictionary of Angels, Including The Fallen Angels, Free Press, p. 176, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 66-19757, A number of authors throughout Christian history have written about demons for a variety of purposes. Theologians like Thomas Aquinas wrote concerning the behaviors of which Christians should be aware,Thomas Acquinas's Summa Theologica, Question 114, hosted on New Advent while witchhunters like Heinrich Kramer wrote about how to find and what to do with people they believed were involved with demons.Malleus Maleficarum, hosted on the Internet Sacred Text Archive Some texts such as the Lesser Key of SolomonLesser Key of Solomon, The Conjuration To Call Forth Any of the Aforesaid Spirits, hosted on Internet Sacred Text Archive or The Grimoire of Pope Honorius (although these, the earliest manuscripts, were from well after these individuals had died) are written with instructions on how to summon demons in the name of God and often were claimed to have been written by individuals respected within the Church.Arthur Edward Waite, Book of Ceremonial Magic, page 64 and page 106 These latter texts were usually more detailed, giving names, ranks, and descriptions of demons individually and categorically. Most Christians commonly reject these texts as either diabolical or fictitious. In modern times, some demonological texts have been written by Christians, usually in a similar vein of Thomas Aquinas, explaining their effects in the world and how faith may lessen or eliminate damage by them.Jessie Penn-Lewis, War on the Saints on Google Books, introductory chapter A few Christian authors, such as Jack Chick and John Todd, write with intentions similar to Kramer, proclaiming that demons and their human agents are active in the world. These claims can stray from mainstream ideology, and may include such beliefs as that Christian rock is a means through which demons influence people. Not all Christians believe that demons exist in the literal sense. There is the view that the language of exorcism in the New Testament is an example of what was once employed to describe the healings of what would be classified in modern days as epilepsy, mental illness etc. Islam Islam has no doctrinal hierarchy of demonology. Even though some Muslim scholars tried to classify jinn and demons, there is no established classification and terms for jinn may overlap or be used interchangeably. Naming the jinn also depends on cultural influences. Julius Wellhausen states, that Islamic demonology is also zoology.Tobias N√ºnlist D√§monenglaube im Islam Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 page 114 (German) Many demonic or demon-like entities are not purely spiritual, but also physical in nature and related to animals.

Can be either a powerful cunning Jinn or strong Shaitan. Ifrits are generally bad. * Marid: a haughty and powerful Shaitan or very malevolent Ifrit. * Bu'Bu: a jinn that frightens children. * Si'lah: a female demon who seduces men. * Amir: spirits dwelling in houses. * Ghul: generally evil, lives in the desert. * Qar√Ænah: name for a specific demon strangling children. * Hatif: a mysterious phenomenon, which can only be heard but never seen. The Ghul and the Si'lah often challenge orientalists to tell them apart, because both are shapeshifters also appearing as females to seduce men. A Ghul in Arabic meaning, term for any shapeshifting spirit, including the Si'lah.Amira El-Zein, Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn Syracuse University Press 2009 page 140 Furthermore, Marid and Ifrit may be hard to distinguish, since they are often used interchangeably, for example in \\"One Thousand and One Nights \\". However both entities have properties apart from the other. The Ifrit is also related to the ghosts of the dead, seeking revenge, unlike the Marid. On the other hand, the Marid is related to those assistants of truthsayers, striving to heaven to access informations from the angels, while the Ifrit does not. Additionally the Peri and the Daeva are kinds of Jinn in Persian lore. While the Daeva are akin to the Shayateen, subordinates of Satan, the Peris are good Jinn fighting the Daeva. However the Peri may endanger people, if they become angered.Robert Lebling Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar I.B.Tauris 2010 Ahmad al-Buni relates four Ifrits to archdemons, diametric opposites to the four archangels of Islam. They have their own ShayƒÅtƒ´n (plural of \\"Shaytan\\") under command, and are subordinate to Iblis, who is thought to be the leader of ShayƒÅtƒ´n.Robert Lebling Robert Lebling I.B.Tauris 2010 page 86-87 Judaism Judaism does not have a demonology or any set of doctrines about demons.Mack, Carol K., Mack, Dinah (1998), A Field Guide to Demons, Fairies, Fallen Angels and Other Subversive Spirits, p.

George (2000), Chapter: \\"Buddhist Cosmology\\", An Introduction to Buddhism, Shippensburg University peopled by demons who torment sinners and tempt mortals to sin, or who seek to thwart their enlightenment, with a demon named Mara as chief tempter, \\"prince of darkness,\\" or \\"Evil One\\" in Sanskrit sources.\\"Demon\\" and \\"Mara\\" in the Glossary of Buddhist Terms at kadampa.orgStrickmann, Michel. Chinese Magical Medicine,(2002) Stanford: Stanford University Press. The followers of Mara were also called mara, the devils, and are frequently cited as a cause of disease or representations of mental obstructions. The mara became fully assimilated into the Chinese worldview, and were called mo. The idea of the imminent decline and collapse of the Buddhist religion amid a \\"great cacophony of demonic influences\\" was already a significant component of Buddhism when it reached China in the first century A.D., according to Michel Strickmann. Demonic forces had attained enormous power in the world. For some writers of the time this state of affairs had been ordained to serve the higher purpose of effecting a \\"preliminary cleansing\\" that would purge and purify humanity in preparation for an ultimate, messianic renewal. Medieval Chinese Buddhist demonology was heavily influenced by Indian Buddhism. Indian demonology is also fully and systematically described in written sources, though during Buddhism's centuries of direct influence in China, \\"Chinese demonology was whipped into respectable shape,\\" with a number of Indian demons finding permanent niches even in Taoist ritual texts. Also, the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra, a major Mahayana Buddhist text, describes fifty demonic states: the so-called fifty skandha maras, which are \\"negative\\" mirror-like reflections of or deviations from correct samƒÅdhi (meditative absorption) states. In this context demons are considered by Buddhists to be beings possessing some supernatural powers, who, in the past, might have practiced Dharma, the Buddha's teaching, but due to practicing it incorrectly failed to develop true wisdom and true compassion, which are inseparable attributes of an enlightened being such as a Buddha or a Bodhisattva. In his autobiography, The Blazing Splendor, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, a prominent Tibetan Buddhist master of the 20th century describes encounters with such beings. Therefore, depending on the context, in Buddhism demons may refer to both disturbed mind states and actual beings. Hinduism Vedic Scriptures include a range of spirits (Vetalas, Rakshasas, Bhutas and Pishachas) that might be classified as demons. These spirits are souls of beings that have committed certain specific sins. As a purging punishment, they are condemned to roam without a physical form for a length of time, until a rebirth. Beings that died with unfulfilled desires or anger are also said to \\"linger\\" until such issues are resolved. Hindu text Atharvaveda gives an account of nature and habitats of such spirits including how to persuade/control them. There are occult traditions in Hinduism that seek to control such spirits to do their bidding. Hindu text Garuda Purana details other kinds of punishments and judgments given out in Hell; this also given an account of how the spirit travels to nether worlds. =Zoroastrianism= In the Zoroastrian tradition, Ahura Mazda, as the force of good Spenta Mainyu, will eventually be victorious in a cosmic battle with an evil force known as Angra Mainyu or Ahriman.\\"Who are the Zoroastrians,\\" at tenets.zoroastrianism.com See also References  Bibliography   External links * *Demonology by James I: plain text version of King James' important work on Demonology.

The crater on the left is about 11 m in diameter The Wabar craters are impact craters located in Saudi Arabia first brought to the attention of Western scholars by British Arabist, explorer, writer and Colonial Office intelligence officer St John Philby, who discovered them while searching for the legendary city of Ubar in Arabia's Rub' al Khali (\\"Empty Quarter\\") in 1932. The expeditions St John Philby in Riyadh =1932 Philby= The vast desert wasteland of southern Saudi Arabia known as the Empty Quarter, or Rub' al Khali in Arabic, is one of the most desolate places on Earth. In 1932, Harry St John \\"Jack\\" Philby was hunting for a city named Ubar, that the Quran describes being destroyed by God for defying the Prophet Hud. Philby transliterated the name of the city as Wabar. Philby had heard of Bedouin legends of an area called Al Hadida (\\"place of iron\\" in Arabic) with ruins of ancient habitations, and also an area where a piece of iron the size of a camel had been found, and so organized an expedition to visit the site. After a month's journey through wastes so harsh that even some of the camels died, on 2 February 1932 Philby arrived at a patch of ground about a half a square kilometre in size, littered with chunks of white sandstone, black glass, and chunks of iron meteorite. Philby identified two large circular depressions partially filled with sand, and three other features that he identified as possible \\"submerged craters\\". He also mapped the area where the large iron block was reputed to have been found. Philby thought that the area was a volcano, and it was only after bringing back samples to the UK that the site was identified as that of a meteorite impact by Leonard James Spencer of the British Museum.Philby (1933), pp 1-26 > A volcano in the midst of the Rub' al Khali! And below me, as I stood on > that hill-top transfixed, lay the twin craters, whose black walls stood up > gauntly above the encroaching sand like the battlements and bastions of some > great castle. These craters were respectively about 100 and 50 yards in > diameter, sunken in the middle but half choked with sand, while inside and > outside their walls lay what I took to be lava in great circles where it > seemed to have flowed out from the fiery furnace. Further examination > revealed the fact that there were three similar craters close by, though > these were surmounted by hills of sand and recognizable only by reason of > the fringe of blackened slag round their edges.Philby (1933), p. 13 Amongst the samples of iron, cindery material and silica glass that Philby brought back from the site was a 25 lb chunk of iron. Analysis showed it to be about 90% iron and 5% nickel, with the rest consisting of various elements, including copper, cobalt, and 6 ppm of iridium, an unusually high concentration. This siderophile element implied that the Wabar site was a meteorite impact area. =1937 Aramco= In 1937, Aramco geologists T. F. Harriss and Walton Hoag, Jr. also investigated the site, but, like Philby, were unable to locate the large block of iron. =1966 National Geographic and Aramco= In 1966 reports came that the sands had shifted and the large iron block was again visible. National Geographic journalist Thomas J. Abercrombie visited the site and found the large meteorite: \\"rumor has become a reality; the biggest iron meteorite ever found in Arabia lay at our feet ... shaped roughly like a saucer, it measured about four feet in diameter and two feet thick at center. A little quick geometry puts its weight at almost two and a half tons.\\"Thomas J. Abercrombie, 1966, \\"Beyond the Sands of Mecca\\" National Geographic Magazine, January 1966. Later in October 1966, a group headed by Aramco employee James Mandaville visited the site with heavy lifting equipment. They found two large uncovered meteorites. The largest, weighing 2,045 kilograms, had a pitted, but roughly level top surface about a metre (3.5 feet) in diameter with one end formed into a cone shape when the meteorite penetrated the atmosphere like a bullet ‚Äî was imbedded in sand, which had drifted over the top. It was photographed in situ, then overturned by a bulldozer and lifted on board a trailer where it and another, smaller meteorite were taken to Dhahran. =1982 Aramco= Mandaville visited the site twice after his 1966 visit. On his last visit, in 1982, he noted that the desert winds and resultant movement of the dune system were covering the site: \\"instead of two thirds of the crater rim (visible as before [in 1966, 16 years earlier]), less than a quarter of it showed.\\" =1994‚Äì1995 Zahid Tractors= In 1994 and 1995 a total of three expeditions were undertaken, sponsored by Zahid Tractor Corporation. A United States Geological Survey scientist, Jeffrey C. Wynn joined all three expeditions, and astronomer and geologist Gene Shoemaker joined at least one. These expeditions were made with modern offroad vehicles into the Empty Quarter, but even with modern technology, the trips were difficult ones. Not only were conditions harsh, but the Wabar site was tricky to find, as it sits in the midst of an enormous dune field that has no fixed landmarks. The site The Wabar site covers about 500 by 1,000 metres, and the most recent mapping shows three prominent, roughly circular craters. Five were reported by Philby in 1932, the largest of which measured 116 and 64 metres wide. Another was described by the second Zahid expedition and is 11 metres wide: this may be one of the other three originally described by Philby. They are all underlain by a hemispherical rim of \\"insta-Rock,\\" so called because it was created from local sand by the impact shock wave, and all three are nearly full of sand. The surface of the area partly consisted of \\"Insta-Rock\\" or \\"impactite\\", a bleached-white, coarsely-laminar sandstone- look-alike, and was littered with black glass slag and pellets. The impactite featured a form of shocked quartz known as \\"coesite\\", and is thus clearly the product of an impact event. The impact did not penetrate to bedrock, but was confined to local sand, making it particularly valuable as a research site. A Wabar meteorite: etched section showing the Widmanst√§tten pattern. The presence of iron fragments at the site also pointed to a meteorite impact, as there are no iron deposits in the region. The iron was in the form of buried fist-sized cracked balls and smooth, sand-blasted fragments found on the surface. The largest fragment was recovered in a 1966 visit to Wabar and weighs 2.2 tonnes. It is known as the \\"Camel's Hump\\" and was on display at the King Saud University in Riyadh until it was moved to the new National Museum of Saudi Arabia in Riyadh, where it is displayed in the entrance foyer. The sand was turned into black glass near the craters, and pellets of the glass are scattered all over the area, decreasing in size with distance from the craters due to wind-sorting. The glass is about 90% local sand and 10% meteoritic iron and nickel. The layout of the impact area suggests that the body fell at a shallow angle, and was moving at typical (although slightly slow) meteorite entry speeds of 11-17 km/s. Its total mass was more than 3,500 tonnes (which would give it a diameter of 16 meters at a density of 1.5 g/cm^3). The shallow angle presented the body with more air resistance than it would have encountered at a steeper angle, and it broke up in the air into at least four pieces before impact. The biggest piece struck with an explosion roughly equivalent to the atom bomb that levelled Hiroshima. Dating the impact event Fission-track analysis of glass fragments by Storzer (1965) suggested the Wabar impact took place thousands of years ago, but delicate glass filigree, and the fact that the craters have been filled-in considerably since Philby's 1932 visit, suggests their origin is much more recent. Thermoluminescence dating by Prescott et al. (2004) suggests the impact site is less than 250 years old. This is consistent with Arab reports of a fireball passing over Riyadh, variously reported as occurring in 1863 or 1891 and heading southeast, reported in Philby's book \\"Empty Quarter\\" (1933). Fragments scattered from the path of this fireball at the Umm al-Hadidah site 25 kilometers northwest of Wabar, which contained fragments of a Type IIIA Octahedrite identical to Wabar fragments, support this northwestern direction of arrival. Moreover, mapping done in 1995 (Shoemaker and Wynn, Lunar and Planetary Science Letters, 1995; Wynn and Shoemaker, Scientific American, November 1998) show that there is an asymmetric distribution of \\"Insta-Rock\\", the coarsely-laminar sandstone created by the impact shock-wave, in the down- range (southeast) direction of the three main craters mapped.

According to supply- side economics, consumers will then benefit from a greater supply of goods and services at lower prices and employment will increase. The Laffer curve, a theoretical relationship between rates of taxation and government revenue which suggests that lower tax rates when the tax level is too high will actually boost government revenue because of higher economic growth, is one of the main theoretical constructs of supply-side economics. The term \\"supply- side economics\\" was thought for some time to have been coined by journalist Jude Wanniski in 1975, but according to Robert D. Atkinson the term \\"supply side\\" was first used in 1976 by Herbert Stein (a former economic adviser to President Richard Nixon) and only later that year was this term repeated by Jude Wanniski. Its use connotes the ideas of economists Robert Mundell and Arthur Laffer.  Historical origins  Robert Mundell Supply-side economics developed in response to the stagflation of the 1970s.Case, Karl E. & Fair, Ray C. (1999). Principles of Economics (5th ed.), p. 780. Prentice-Hall. . It drew on a range of non-Keynesian economic thought, including the Chicago School and New Classical School. Bruce Bartlett, an advocate of supply-side economics, traced the school of thought's intellectual descent from the philosophers Ibn Khaldun and David Hume, satirist Jonathan Swift, political economist Adam Smith and United States Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton. However, what most distinguishes supply-side economics as a modern phenomenon is its argument in favor of low tax rates primarily for collective and notably working-class reasons, rather than traditional ideological ones. Classical liberals opposed taxes because they opposed government, taxation being the latter's most obvious form. Their claim was that each man had a right to himself and his property and therefore taxation was immoral and of questionable legal grounding.Gray, pp. 26‚Äì7 Liberalism. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1995. On the other hand, supply-side economists argued that the alleged collective benefit (i.e. increased economic output and efficiency) provided the main impetus for tax cuts. As in classical economics, supply-side economics proposed that production or supply is the key to economic prosperity and that consumption or demand is merely a secondary consequence. Early on, this idea had been summarized in Say's Law of economics, which states: \\"A product is no sooner created, than it, from that instant, affords a market for other products to the full extent of its own value.\\" Supply-side economics rose in popularity among Republican Party politicians from 1977 onwards. Prior to 1977, Republicans were more split on tax reduction, with some worrying that tax cuts would fuel inflation and exacerbate deficits. In 1978, Jude Wanniski published The Way the World Works in which he laid out the central thesis of supply-side economics and detailed the failure of high tax rate progressive income tax systems and United States monetary policy under Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter in the 1970s. Wanniski advocated lower tax rates and a return to some kind of gold standard, similar to the 1944‚Äì1971 Bretton Woods System that Nixon abandoned. = Laffer curve = Three different Laffer curves: t* represents the rate of taxation at which maximal revenue is generated and the curve need not be single-peaked nor symmetrical The Laffer curve embodies a postulate of supply-side economics: that tax rates and tax revenues are distinct, with government tax revenues the same at a 100% tax rate as they are at a 0% tax rate and maximum revenue somewhere in between these two values. Supply-siders argued that in a high tax rate environment lowering tax rates would result in either increased revenues or smaller revenue losses than one would expect relying on only static estimates of the previous tax base. This led supply-siders to advocate large reductions in marginal income and capital gains tax rates to encourage greater investment, which would produce more supply. Jude Wanniski and many others advocate a zero capital gains rate.Wanniski, Jude \\"Taxing Capital Gains\\" The increased aggregate supply should result in increased aggregate demand, hence the term \\"supply-side economics\\".  History  = Reaganomics = In the United States, commentators frequently equate supply-side economics with Reaganomics. The fiscal policies of Republican Ronald Reagan were largely based on supply-side economics. Reagan made supply-side economics a household phrase and promised an across-the-board reduction in income tax rates and an even larger reduction in capital gains tax rates.(Karl Case ad Ray Fair, 1999: pp. 781‚Äì2). During Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign, the key economic concern was double digit inflation, which Reagan described as \\"[t]oo many dollars chasing too few goods\\", but rather than the usual dose of tight money, recession and layoffs, with their consequent loss of production and wealth, he promised a gradual and painless way to fight inflation by \\"producing our way out of it\\".Case & Fair, pp. 781‚Äì2. Switching from an earlier monetarist policy, Federal Reserve chair Paul Volcker began a policy of tighter monetary policies such as lower money supply growth to break the inflationary psychology and squeeze inflationary expectations out of the economic system.Malabre, Jr., pp. 170‚Äì1. Therefore, supply-side supporters argue that Reaganomics was only partially based on supply-side economics. Congress under Reagan passed a plan that would slash taxes by $749 billion over five years. Critics claim that the tax cuts increased budget deficits while Reagan supporters credit them with helping the 1980s economic expansion that eventually lowered the deficits and argued that the budget deficit would have decreased if not for massive increases in military spending. As a result, Jason Hymowitz cited Reagan‚Äîalong with Jack Kemp‚Äîas a great advocate for supply-side economics in politics and repeatedly praised his leadership.Malabre, Jr., p. 188. Critics of Reaganomics claim it failed to produce much of the exaggerated gains some supply-siders had promised. Paul Krugman later summarized the situation: \\"When Ronald Reagan was elected, the supply-siders got a chance to try out their ideas. Unfortunately, they failed.\\" Although he credited supply-side economics for being more successful than monetarism which he claimed \\"left the economy in ruins\\", he stated that supply-side economics produced results which fell \\"so far short of what it promised\\", describing the supply-side theory as \\"free lunches\\".Malabre, Jr., p. 195. = Clinton years = The chart shows average federal tax rates paid by various levels of the income distribution. During the Clinton era, taxes on upper incomes were higher than during the Reagan era. Paul Krugman argued how higher taxes on higher income persons, combined with higher job creation under Clinton, represented a counter-example of the supply-side tax-cut doctrine. Krugman linked his own version of this chart to the preceding article, illustrating the average tax rate of the top 1%. President Clinton presided over the budgets for fiscal years 1994‚Äì2001. From 1998 to 2001, the budget was in a surplus for the first time since 1969. Economists Jeffrey Frankel and Peter Orszag summarized Clintonomics in a 2001 paper: \\"It sought to adopt some of the pro-market orientation associated with the ascendancy of the Republicans in the 1980s, and marry it with traditional Democratic values such as concern for the environment and a more progressive income distribution.\\" Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 into law, which raised income taxes rates on incomes above $115,000, created additional higher tax brackets for corporate income over $335,000, removed the cap on Medicare taxes, raised fuel taxes and increased the portion of Social Security income subject to tax, among other tax increases. Frankel and Orszag described the ‚Äúprogressive fiscal conservatism\\" of the 1993 package: \\"Such progressive fiscal conservatism combines modest attempts at redistribution (the progressive component) and budget discipline (the fiscal conservative component). Thus the 1993 package included significant spending reductions and tax increases. But it concentrated the tax increases on upper-income taxpayers, while substantially expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, Head Start, and other government programs aimed at lower earners.\\" President George H.W. Bush had raised marginal income tax rates in 1990. The tax increases led to greater revenue (relative to a baseline without a tax increase). The bill was strongly opposed by Republicans, vigorously attacked by John Kasich and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich as destined to cause job losses and lower revenue. Economist Paul Krugman wrote in 2017 that Clinton's tax increases on the rich provided counter-example to the supply-side tax cut doctrine: \\"Bill Clinton provided a clear test, by raising taxes on the rich. Republicans predicted disaster, but instead the economy boomed, creating more jobs than under Reagan.\\" Supply-side economist Alan Reynolds argued that the Clinton era represented a continuation of a low tax policy (from the 1980s): Kansas experiment In May 2012, Sam Brownback, Governor of the state of Kansas, signed into law the \\"Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117\\", which cut state income taxes deeply and was intended to generate rapid economic growth. The tax cuts have been called the \\"Kansas experiment\\", and described as \\"one of the cleanest experiments for how tax cuts effect economic growth in the U.S.\\" The law cut taxes by 231 million in its first year, and cuts were projected to total 934 million after six years. They eliminated taxes on \\"pass-through\\" income (used by sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited liability companies, subchapter S corporations, for the owners of almost 200,000 businesses, and cut individual income tax rates as well. The original bill proposed by Brownback offset the losses expected to result from the cuts with increases in the state sales tax, as well as the elimination of numerous tax credits and deductions, but by the time the bill came to the governor to be signed these had been removed. Brownback then argued that the cuts would pay for themselves by increasing revenue by boosting the state's economic growth. Supporters pointed to projections from the conservative Kansas Policy Institute predicting that the bill would lead to a $323 million increase in tax revenue. Brownback forecast his cuts would create an additional 23,000 jobs in Kansas by 2020. On the other hand, the Kansas Legislature's research staff warned of the possibility of a deficit of nearly 2.5 billion by July 2018. Brownback compared his tax cut policies with those of Ronald Reagan, but also described them as \\"a real live experiment ... We'll see how it works.\\" The cuts were based on model legislation published by the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), and were supported by The Wall Street Journal, supply-side economist Arthur Laffer, and anti-tax leader Grover Norquist. By 2017, state revenues had fallen by hundreds of millions of dollars causing spending on roads, bridges, and education to be slashed,\\"Kansas Legislature approves budget deal, after lawmakers deliver blistering critiques of state finances,\\" May 2, 2016, Topeka Capital- Journal\\"Kansas Republicans Sour on Their Tax-Cut Experiment\\" February 24, 2017, The Atlantic but instead of boosting economic growth, growth in Kansas remained consistently below average. A working paper by two economists at Oklahoma State University (Dan Rickman and Hongbo Wang) using historical data from several other states with economies structured similarly to Kansas found that the Kansas economy grew about 7.8% less and employment about 2.6% less than it would have had Brownback not cut taxes. In 2017, the Republican Legislature of Kansas voted to roll back the cuts, and after Brownback vetoed the repeal, overrode his veto. According to Max Ehrenfreund and economists he consulted, an explanation for the reduction instead of increase in economic growth from the tax cuts is that \\"any\\" benefits from tax cuts come over the long, not short run, but what does come in the short run is a major decline in demand for goods and services. In the Kansas economy cuts in state government expenditures cut incomes of state government \\"employees, suppliers and contractors\\" who spent much or most of their incomes locally. In addition, concern over the state's large budget deficits \\"might have deterred businesses from making major new investments\\". Economist Paul Krugman wrote in 2017: \\"Sam Brownback, governor of Kansas, slashed taxes in what he called a ‚Äúreal live experiment‚Äù in conservative fiscal policy. But the growth he promised never came, while a fiscal crisis did. At the same time, Jerry Brown's California raised taxes, leading to proclamations from the right that the state was committing ‚Äúeconomic suicide‚Äù; in fact, the state has experienced impressive employment and economic growth.\\" Gov. Brownback himself strongly rejected criticism of his cuts or any need to adjust the law, declaring the cuts a success, blaming perceptions to the contrary on a ‚Äúrural recession,‚Äù and on ‚Äúthe left media\\" which \\"lies about the tax cuts all the time‚Äù. = Trump tax cuts = President Trump implemented individual and corporate income tax cuts which took effect in 2018. Rutgers economics professor Farrokh Langdana claimed that the Trump tax cuts were an example of supply-side tax policy, citing a letter from economists long-associated with the supply-side theory describing them as such. The New York Times reported in November 2018 that the Trump tax overhaul \\"has fattened the paychecks of most American workers, padded the profits of large corporations and sped economic growth.\\" Cautioning that \\"its still early but ten months after the law took effect, the promised 'supply side' bump is harder to find than the sugar-high stimulus.\\" The writers explained that \\"It's highly unusual for deficits...to grow this much during periods of prosperity\\" and that \\"the fiscal health of the U.S. is deteriorating fast, as revenues have declined sharply\\" (nearly $200 billion or about 6%) relative to the CBO forecast prior to the tax cuts. Results included: *Contrary to claims the tax cuts would pay for themselves, the budget deficit rose to $779 billion in fiscal year 2018, up 17% versus the prior year. *Corporate tax revenues were down by one-third in fiscal year 2018. *Stock buyback activity increased significantly. *GDP growth, business investment and corporate profits increased. *A typical worker in a large company got a $225 raise or one-time bonus, due to the law. *Real wage growth (adjusted for inflation) was slightly slower in 2018 than 2017.  Fiscal policy theory  Supply-side fiscal policies are designed to increase aggregate supply, as opposed to aggregate demand, thereby expanding output and employment while lowering prices. Such policies are of several general varieties: #Investments in human capital, such as education, healthcare, and encouraging the transfer of technologies and business processes, to improve productivity (output per worker). Encouraging globalized free trade via containerization is a major recent example. #Tax reduction, to provide incentives to work, invest and take risks. Lowering income tax rates and eliminating or lowering tariffs are examples of such policies. #Investments in new capital equipment and research and development (R&D;), to further improve productivity. Allowing businesses to depreciate capital equipment more rapidly (e.g., over one year as opposed to 10), encourages them to purchase such equipment. #Reduction in government regulations, to encourage business formation and expansion. One benefit of such policies is that shifting the aggregate supply curve outward means prices can be lowered along with expanding output and employment. This is in contrast to demand-side policies (e.g., higher government spending), which even if successful tend to create inflationary pressures (i.e., raise the aggregate price level) as the aggregate demand curve shifts outward. Infrastructure investment is an example of a policy that has both demand-side and supply-side elements. Supply-side economics holds that increased taxation steadily reduces economic activity within a nation and discourages investment. Taxes act as a type of trade barrier or tariff that causes economic participants to revert to less efficient means of satisfying their needs. As such, higher taxation leads to lower levels of specialization and lower economic efficiency. The idea is said to be illustrated by the Laffer curve.(Karl Case and Ray Fair, 1999: pp. 780‚Äì1). Supply-side economists have less to say on the effects of deficits and sometimes cite Robert Barro‚Äôs work that states that rational economic actors will buy bonds in sufficient quantities to reduce long-term interest rates.  Effect on economic growth and tax revenues  upright=1.0Supply-side economics proposes that lower taxes lead to employment growth, but historical state data from the United States shows a heterogeneous result Many supply-side proponents argue that tax cuts can lead to increases in overall tax revenue because of the tax cuts' positive impact on economic growth However, a 2012 survey of leading economists showed a consensus against the proposition that tax reductions would increase tax revenue in the United States. Some contemporary economists do not consider supply-side economics a tenable economic theory, with Alan Blinder calling it an \\"ill-fated\\" and perhaps \\"silly\\" school on the pages of a 2006 textbook. Greg Mankiw, former chairman of President President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, offered similarly sharp criticism of the school in the early editions of his introductory economics textbook. \\"Tax cuts rarely pay for themselves. My reading of the academic literature leads me to believe that about one-third of the cost of a typical tax cut is recouped with faster economic growth.\\" In a 1992 article for the Harvard International Review, James Tobin wrote: \\"The] idea that tax cuts would actually increase revenues turned out to deserve the ridicule.\\" Karl Case and Ray Fair wrote in Principles of Economics, \\"The extreme promises of supply-side economics did not materialize. President Reagan argued that because of the effect depicted in the Laffer curve, the government could maintain expenditures, cut tax rates, and balance the budget. This was not the case. Government revenues fell sharply from levels that would have been realized without the tax cuts.\\" Supply side proponents Trabandt and Uhlig argue that \\"static scoring overestimates the revenue loss for labor and capital tax cuts\\" and that \\"dynamic scoring\\" is a better predictor for the effects of tax cuts. A 1999 study by University of Chicago economist Austan Goolsbee, which examined major changes in high income tax rates in the United States from the 1920s onwards concluded that there only modest changes in the reported income of high-income individuals, indicating that the tax changes had little effect on how much people work. He concluded that the notion that governments could raise more money by cutting rates \\"is unlikely to be true at anything like today's marginal tax rates.\\" In addition, some studies have shown that in the past several decades, tax cuts in the U.S. seldom recoup revenue losses and have minimal impact on GDP growth. A 2008 working paper found that in the case of Russia, \\"tax rate cuts can increase revenues by improving tax compliance.\\" The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics reports that estimates of revenue-maximizing tax rates have varied widely, with a mid- range of around 70%. A 2012 survey found a consensus among leading economists that reducing the US federal income tax rate would raise GDP but would not increase tax revenue. According to a 2012 study, \\"the U.S. marginal top [tax] rate is far from the top of the Laffer curve.\\" John Quiggin distinguishes between the Laffer curve and Laffer's analysis of tax rates. The Laffer curve was \\"correct but unoriginal\\", but Laffer's analysis that the United States was on the wrong side of the Laffer curve \\"was original but incorrect.\\" = 1920s tax cuts = Proponents of supply-side economics have sometimes cited tax cuts enacted in the 1920s as evidence that tax cuts can increase tax revenue. After World War I, the highest tax bracket, which was for those earning over $100,000 a year (worth at least $1 million a year now), was over 70 percent. The revenue acts of 1921, 1924 and 1926 reduced this tax rate to less than 25 percent, yet tax revenues actually went up significantly. Tax historian Joseph Thorndike argues that the tax cuts helped \\"bolster\\" growth but did not \\"cover the full cost of those tax cuts.\\" According to a 1995 study, the tax reductions implemented in the 1920s reduced tax avoidance. Gene Smiley at the Foundation for Economic Education explains: \\"The share of income taxes paid by the higher net income tax classes fell as tax rates were raised. With the reduction in rates in the twenties, higher-income taxpayers reduced their sheltering of income and the number of returns and share of income taxes paid by higher-income taxpayers rose\\". = Revenue Act of 1964 = Proponents of supply-side economics sometimes cite tax cuts enacted by President Lyndon B. Johnson with the Revenue Act of 1964. John F. Kennedy had the year prior advocated a drastic tax-rate cut in 1963 when the top income tax rate was 91%, arguing that \\"[t]ax rates are too high today and tax revenues too low, and the soundest way to raise revenues in the long run is to cut rates now\\". The CBO concluded in 1978 that the tax cuts reduced tax revenue by $12 billion and that only between $3 billion to $9 million were recaptured due to bolstered economic growth. According to the CBO, \\"most of this rise [in revenues] was due to economic growth that would have taken place even without the tax cut.\\" = Reaganomics = Ronald Reagan gives a televised address from the Oval Office, outlining his plan for tax reductions in July 1981 Supply-siders justified Reagan's tax cuts during the 1980s by claiming they would result in net increases in tax revenue, yet tax revenues declined (relative to a baseline without the cuts) due to Reagan's tax cuts and the deficit ballooned during Reagan's term in office. The Treasury Department studied the Reagan tax cuts and concluded they significantly reduced tax revenues relative to a baseline without them. The 1990 budget by the Reagan administration concluded that the 1981 tax cuts had caused a reduction in tax revenue. Both CBO and the Reagan Administration forecast that individual and business income tax revenues would be lower if the Reagan tax cut proposals were implemented, relative to a policy baseline without those cuts, by about $50 billion in 1982 and $210 billion by 1986. FICA tax revenue increased because in 1983 FICA tax rates were increased from 6.7% to 7% and the ceiling was raised by $2,100. For the self-employed, the FICA tax rate went from 9.35% to 14%. The FICA tax rate increased throughout Reagan's term and rose to 7.51% in 1988 and the ceiling was raised by 61% through Reagan's two terms. Those tax hikes on wage earners, along with inflation, were the source of revenue gains in the early 1980s.The Reagan Tax Cuts: Lessons for Tax Reform ‚Äì Joint Economic Committee It has been contended by some supply-side critics that the argument to lower taxes to increase revenues was a smokescreen for \\"starving\\" the government of revenues in the hope that the tax cuts would lead to a corresponding drop in government spending, but this did not turn out to be the case. Paul Samuelson called this notion \\"the tape worm theory‚Äîthe idea that the way to get rid of a tape worm is [to] stab your patient in the stomach\\".Malabre, Jr., pp. 197‚Äì8. There is frequent confusion on the meaning of the term \\"supply-side economics\\" between the related ideas of the existence of the Laffer Curve and the belief that decreasing tax rates can increase tax revenues. Many supply-side economists doubt the latter claim while still supporting the general policy of tax cuts. Economist Gregory Mankiw used the term \\"fad economics\\" to describe the notion of tax rate cuts increasing revenue in the third edition of his Principles of Macroeconomics textbook in a section entitled \\"Charlatans and Cranks\\": = Clinton administration = Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 into law, which raised income taxes rates on incomes above $115,000, created additional higher tax brackets for corporate income over $335,000, removed the cap on Medicare taxes, raised fuel taxes and increased the portion of Social Security income subject to tax, among other tax increases. CBO reported in 1999 that: \\"In the absence of changes in tax laws, total revenues tend to grow over a period of years at the same average rate as the economy. But 1998 marked the fifth consecutive year in which growth in revenues outstripped growth in national income. Tax increases enacted in 1993 helped boost revenues in 1994 and 1995, but rapid growth in taxes on capital gains realizations, increases in taxable incomes as a share of GDP, and other exceptional factors have driven the increases relative to GDP since then.\\" In 2008, the Center for American Progress compared economic and budgetary results from two supply-side periods (1981-1992 and 2001-2007), against the Clinton era (1993-2000) as a counter-example where tax rates were increased contrary to supply-side theory. In terms of growth in wages, real investment, and GDP, results were better during the Clinton era. While the tax cuts in the supply- side periods contributed to greater deficits, the tax increases of the Clinton era contributed to surpluses. = Bush tax cuts = During his presidency, President Bush signed the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, which entailed significant tax cuts. In 2003, the Congressional Budget Office conducted a dynamic scoring analysis of tax cuts advocated by supply advocates, and found that the Bush tax cuts would not pay for themselves. Two of the nine models used in the study predicted a large improvement in the deficit over the next ten years resulting from tax cuts, but only by making the assumption that people would work harder from 2004 to 2014 because they believed that the tax cuts would go up again in 2014 and they wanted to make more money before the tax cuts expired.\`Dynamic' Scoring Finally Ends Debate On Taxes, Revenue. By Alan Murray. Wall Street Journal. (Eastern edition). New York, N.Y.: April 1, 2003. p. A.4 In 2006, the CBO released a study titled \\"A Dynamic Analysis of Permanent Extension of the President's Tax Relief\\".Microsoft Word ‚Äì treasury dyn anal report jul 24 10am II FINAL.doc This study found that under the best possible scenario making tax cuts permanent would increase the economy \\"over the long run\\" by 0.7%. Since the \\"long run\\" is not defined, some commentators have suggested that 20 years should be used, making the annual best case GDP growth equal to 0.04%. When compared with the cost of the tax cuts, the best case growth scenario is still not sufficient to pay for the tax cuts. Previous official CBO estimates had identified the tax cuts as costing an amount equal to 1.4% of GDP. According to the study, if the best case growth scenario is applied, the tax cuts would still cost an amount equal to 1.27% of GDP. This study was criticized by many economists, including Harvard Economics Professor Greg Mankiw, who pointed out that the CBO used a very low value for the earnings-weighted compensated labor supply elasticity of 0.14. In a paper published in the Journal of Public Economics, Mankiw and Matthew Weinzierl noted that the current economics research would place an appropriate value for labor supply elasticity at around 0.5. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that extending the Bush tax cuts beyond their 2010 expiration would increase the deficit by $1.8 trillion over 10 years. The CBO also completed a study in 2005 analyzing a hypothetical 10% income tax cut and concluded that under various scenarios there would be minimal offsets to the loss of revenue. In other words, deficits would increase by nearly the same amount as the tax cut in the first five years with limited feedback revenue thereafter. According to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, the Bush tax cuts failed to promote growth since all macroeconomic growth indicators were well below average for the 2001‚Äì2005 business cycle. These critics argue the Bush tax cuts have done little more than deprive the government of revenue necessary to keep a balanced budget.The boom that wasn't Before President George W. Bush signed the 2003 tax cuts, the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) released a statement signed by ten Nobel prize laureates entitled \\"Economists' statement opposing the Bush tax cuts\\", which states: Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman agreed the tax cuts would reduce tax revenues and result in intolerable deficits, though he supported them as a means to restrain federal spending. Friedman characterized the reduced government tax revenue as \\"cutting their allowance\\". = Trump tax cuts = Some proponents for the 2017 tax cuts implemented by the Trump administration argued that the tax cuts would be revenue neutral. Proponents argued this before the passage of the tax cuts and continued to argue that the tax cuts paid for themselves in the years subsequent to the tax cuts; the CBO estimated in 2017 that tax cuts would increase deficits, and analyses published in subsequent showed that the tax cuts did indeed increase deficits. The New York Times reported in August 2019 that: \\"The increasing levels of red ink stem from a steep falloff in federal revenue after Mr. Trump‚Äôs 2017 tax cuts, which lowered individual and corporate tax rates, resulting in far fewer tax dollars flowing to the Treasury Department. Tax revenues for 2018 and 2019 have fallen more than $430 billion short of what the budget office predicted they would be in June 2017, before the tax law was approved that December.\\"  Effect on income inequality  Income inequality can be measured both pre- and after-tax. There is no consensus on the effects of income tax cuts on pre-tax income inequality, although one 2013 study indicated a strong correlation between how much top marginal tax rates were cut and greater pre-tax inequality across many countries. However, an important side effect of income tax cuts in the U.S. is an increase in after-tax income inequality (other things equal), meaning the top earners receive a greater share of the after-tax income. This is due to several tax policy factors: * Federal income taxes are progressive, meaning that higher income tax rates are levied on higher levels of income. For example, married couples filing jointly in 2017 pay a 25% tax rate on their income between $75,900 and $153,100, but 39.6% for income above $470,700. This progressive policy meant the top 1% of income earners paid roughly 45% of the income taxes despite earning 17% of the pre-tax income in 2014. So cutting income tax rates means relatively less is paid by higher-income households, leaving them with a greater share of the after-tax income. * Approximately 40-50% of American households do not pay federal income taxes, either because they do not earn sufficient income to pay federal income taxes or qualify for exclusions (e.g. many elderly households do not pay income taxes on their Social Security benefits). The percentage of households paying income taxes by age tends to rise into the prime working years (peaking at about 80% around age 50) and falls upon retirement.Washington Post-Brad Plumer-Who doesn't pay taxes, in eight charts-September 18, 2012 * Income taxes are distinct from payroll taxes, which all workers pay. In other words, a paycheck will have withdrawal amounts for payroll taxes (e.g. Social Security and Medicare) along with withdrawals for federal income taxes; some of the latter may be refunded when the annual tax return is filed. Payroll taxes are flat taxes (the same rate is levied) for salary and wage income up to a specific threshold ($127,400 in 2017). For example, the Tax Policy Center evaluated a detailed supply-side tax cut proposal from presidential candidate Jeb Bush in 2015. Their conclusion was that the proposal would both increase deficits dramatically and worsen after-tax income inequality.Washington Post-Jared Bernstein-Bush tax cut plan loses trillions and worsens inequality-December 11,2015 The combination of market forces driving pre-tax inequality combined with a reduction in marginal tax rates after 1979 resulted in the share of after-tax income received by the top 1% increasing from 7.4% to a peak of 16.7% in 2007 before falling to 12.4% in 2013. The tax increases effective in 2013 due to the expiration of the Bush tax cuts for income over $400,000 ($450,000 for couples filing jointly) along with other tax increases on high incomes related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) contributed to the decline in after-tax inequality, although they were not sufficient to offset the rise in inequality since 1979.  Criticism  Supply side economics has been criticised for benefiting high income earners, as graph shows the change in top 1% income share against the change in top income tax rate from 1975‚Äì1979 to 2004‚Äì2008 for 18 OECD countries: the correlation between increasing income inequality and decreasing top tax rates is very strongOptimal Taxation of Top Labor Incomes: A Tale of Three Elasticities Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez, Stefanie Stantcheva, NBER, Nov. 2011 Critics of supply-side policies emphasize the growing federal deficits, increased income inequality and lack of growth. They argue that the Laffer curve only measures the rate of taxation, not tax incidence, which may be a stronger predictor of whether a tax code change is stimulative or dampening. David Harper claims that some economists dismiss the theory as offering \\"nothing particularly new or controversial as an updated view of classical economics\\". Writing in 2010, John Quggin said, \\"To the extent that there was an economic response to the Reagan tax cuts, and to those of George W. Bush twenty years later, it seems largely to have been a Keynesian demand-side response, to be expected when governments provide households with additional net income in the context of a depressed economy.\\" Cutting marginal tax rates can also be perceived as primarily beneficial to the wealthy, which some see as politically rather than economically motivated:  See also  * Demand-side economics * Fiscal conservatism * Gold standard * Mellonomics * Monetarism * Thatcherism * Trickle-down economics * voodoo economics  Notes and references   External links  * Sowell, Thomas. \\"Trickle Down\\" Theory and \\"Tax Cuts for the Rich\\". \\"Portion of Mundell's Nobel Prize Lecture\\" (awarded for unrelated work in optimum currency area).

Its center is located offshore near the town of Chicxulub, after which the crater is named. It was formed when a large asteroid or comet about in diameter, known as the Chicxulub impactor, struck the Earth. The date of the impact coincides precisely with the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary (commonly known as the \\"K‚ÄìPg boundary\\"), slightly more than 66 million years ago, and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide climate disruption from the event was the cause of the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event, a mass extinction in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs. The crater is estimated to be in diameter and in depth, well into the continental crust of the region of about depth. It is the second largest confirmed impact structure on Earth, and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research. The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucat√°n Peninsula during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas. In 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact and its effects. A 2020 study concluded that the Chicxulub crater was formed by an inclined (45‚Äì60¬∞ to horizontal) impact from the northeast. Discovery Gravity anomaly map of the Chicxulub impact area. The coastline is shown as a white line. A series of concentric features reveals the location of the crater. White dots represent cenotes (water-filled sinkholes). A ring of cenotes is associated with the largest semicircular feature, although its exact origin remains unclear. In 1978, geophysicists Glen Penfield and Antonio Camargo were working for the Mexican state-owned oil company Petr√≥leos Mexicanos, or Pemex, as part of an airborne magnetic survey of the Gulf of Mexico north of the Yucat√°n Peninsula.Verschuur, 20‚Äì21. Penfield's job was to use geophysical data to scout possible locations for oil drilling.Bates. In the offshore magnetic data, Penfield noted anomalies whose depth he estimated, and mapped. He then obtained onshore gravity data from the 1940s. According to Penfield, \\"The old data showed a large concentric set of onshore gravity anomalies. When I laid it next to my No. 2 pencil mapping of the offshore magnetic anomalies, the fit was perfect: a shallow, 180-kilometer diameter gravity-magnetic bullseye on the almost non-magnetic, uniform carbonate background of the Yucatan platform! We recognized the crater as the likely Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary event.\\" A decade earlier, the same map suggested an impact feature to contractor Robert Baltosser, but he was forbidden to publicize his conclusion by Pemex corporate policy of the time.Verschuur, 20. Penfield with the sample of shocked quartz found at Well #2, Chicxulub Pemex disallowed release of specific data but let Penfield and company official Antonio Camargo present their results at the 1981 Society of Exploration Geophysicists conference.Weinreb. That year's conference was underattended and their report attracted scant attention. Coincidentally, many experts in impact craters and the K‚ÄìPg (Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene) boundary were attending a separate conference on Earth impacts. Although Penfield had plenty of geophysical data sets, he had no rock cores or other physical evidence of an impact. He knew Pemex had drilled exploratory wells in the region. In 1951, one bored into what was described as a thick layer of andesite about down. This layer could have resulted from the intense heat and pressure of an Earth impact, but at the time of the borings it was dismissed as a lava dome‚Äîa feature uncharacteristic of the region's geology. Penfield tried to secure site samples, but was told such samples had been lost or destroyed. When attempts at returning to the drill sites and looking for rocks proved fruitless, Penfield abandoned his search, published his findings and returned to his Pemex work. At the same time, in 1980, geologist Walter Alvarez and his father, Nobel Prize-winning scientist Luis Walter Alvarez, put forth their hypothesis that a large extraterrestrial body had struck Earth at the time of the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary. In 1981, unaware of Penfield's discovery, University of Arizona graduate student Alan R. Hildebrand and faculty adviser William V. Boynton published a draft Earth- impact theory and sought a candidate crater.Mason. Their evidence included greenish-brown clay with surplus iridium containing shocked quartz grains and small weathered glass beads that looked to be tektites.Hildebrand, Penfield, et al. Thick, jumbled deposits of coarse rock fragments were also present, thought to have been scoured from one place and deposited elsewhere by a megatsunami resulting from an Earth impact. Such deposits occur in many locations but seem concentrated in the Caribbean basin at the K‚ÄìPg boundary.Hildebrand interview: 'Similar deposits of rubble occur all across the southern coast of North America [‚Ä¶] indicate that something extraordinary happened here.' So when Haitian professor Florentine Mor√°s discovered what he thought to be evidence of an ancient volcano on Haiti, Hildebrand suggested it could be a telltale feature of a nearby impact.Mor√°s. Tests on samples retrieved from the K‚ÄìPg boundary revealed more tektite glass, formed only in the heat of asteroid impacts and high-yield nuclear detonations. In 1990, Houston Chronicle reporter Carlos Byars told Hildebrand of Penfield's earlier discovery of a possible impact crater.Frankel, 50. Hildebrand contacted Penfield in April 1990 and the pair soon secured two drill samples from the Pemex wells, stored in New Orleans.Hildebrand interview. Hildebrand's team tested the samples, which clearly showed shock-metamorphic materials. A team of California researchers including Kevin Pope, Adriana Ocampo, and Charles Duller, surveying regional satellite images in 1996, found a cenote (sinkhole) ring centered on Chicxulub that matched the one Penfield saw earlier; the cenotes were thought to be caused by subsidence of bolide-weakened lithostratigraphy around the impact crater wall.Pope, Baines, et al. More recent evidence suggests the crater is wide, and the 180 km ring is an inner wall of it.Sharpton & Marin. Impact specifics Researchers at the University of Glasgow dated tektite samples from the impact as 66,038,000 ¬± 11,000 years old. The Chicxulub impactor had an estimated diameter of , and delivered an estimated energy of 21‚Äì921 billion Hiroshima A-bombs (between 1.3√ó10 and 5.8√ó10 joules, or 1.3‚Äì58 yottajoules). For comparison, this is ~100 million times the energy released by the Tsar Bomba, a thermonuclear device (\\"H-bomb\\") that remains the most powerful human-made explosive ever detonated, which released 210 petajoules (2.1√ó10 joules, or 50 megatons TNT).Adamsky and Smirnov, 19. The impact created a hole wide and deep, leaving a crater mainly under the sea and covered by of sediment by the 21st century. In addition, the impact created winds in excess of 1000 kilometers per hour near the blast's center. =Effects= An animation showing the impact, and subsequent crater formation (University of Arizona, Space Imagery Center) The impact would have caused a megatsunami over tall that would have reached all the way to what are now Texas and Florida. The height of the tsunami was limited by the relatively shallow sea in the area of the impact; in deep ocean it would have been tall. Nonetheless, the most recent simulations show that waves may have been up to 1.5 kilometers (~1 mi) tall, able to reach the coastal lines all over the world.https://eos.org/articles/huge-global-tsunami-followed-dinosaur-killing- asteroid-impacthttps://agu.confex.com/agu/fm18/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/445502 A cloud of hot dust, ash and steam would have spread from the crater as the impactor burrowed underground in less than a second.Melosh, interview. Excavated material along with pieces of the impactor, ejected out of the atmosphere by the blast, would have been heated to incandescence upon re- entry, broiling the Earth's surface and possibly igniting wildfires; meanwhile, colossal shock waves would have triggered global earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.Melosh. \\"On the ground, you would feel an effect similar to an oven on broil, lasting for about an hour ... causing global forest fires.\\" Fossil evidence for an instantaneous die-off of diverse animals was found in a soil layer only thick in New Jersey away from the impact site, indicating that death and burial under debris occurred suddenly and quickly over wide distances on land. Field research from the Hell Creek Formation in North Dakota published in 2019 shows the simultaneous mass extinction of myriad species combined with geological and atmospheric features consistent with the impact event. According to researchers, the impact triggered a seismic event equivalent to a Magnitude 12 earthquake at the impact site, with shockwaves generating the equivalent of Magnitude 9 earthquakes across the globe. In addition, the ensuing shockwaves likely triggered large-scale volcanic eruptions across the Earth; the shockwaves probably contributed to the Deccan Traps flood basalt eruption, which was estimated to have occurred around the same time. The emission of dust and particles could have covered the entire surface of the Earth for several years, possibly a decade, creating a harsh environment for living things. Production of carbon dioxide caused by the destruction of carbonate rocks would have led to a sudden greenhouse effect.Hildebrand, Penfield, et al.; 5. Over a decade or longer, sunlight would have been blocked from reaching the surface of the Earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere, cooling the surface dramatically. Photosynthesis by plants would also have been interrupted, affecting the entire food chain.Perlman.Pope, Ocampo, et al. A model of the event developed by Lomax et al. (2001) suggests that net primary productivity (NPP) rates may have increased to higher than pre-impact levels over the long term because of the high carbon dioxide concentrations. In February 2008, a team of researchers led by Sean Gulick at the University of Texas at Austin's Jackson School of Geosciences used seismic images of the crater to determine that the impactor landed in deeper water than previously assumed. They argued that this would have resulted in increased sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere. According to the press release, that \\"could have made the impact deadlier in two ways: by altering climate (sulfate aerosols in the upper atmosphere can have a cooling effect) and by generating acid rain (water vapor can help to flush the lower atmosphere of sulfate aerosols, causing acid rain).\\" This was borne out by the results of a drilling project in 2016 which found that sulfate-containing rocks found in the area were not found in the peak ring (the rocks found were from deep within the earth's crust instead), the interpretation being that they had been vaporized by the impact and dispersed into the atmosphere. A long-term local effect of the impact was the creation of the Yucat√°n sedimentary basin which \\"ultimately produced favorable conditions for human settlement in a region where surface water is scarce.\\" =Geology and morphology= The piece of clay, held by Walter Alvarez, that sparked research into the impact theory. The greenish-brown band in the center is extremely rich in iridium. In their 1991 paper, Hildebrand, Penfield and company described the geology and composition of the impact feature.Hildebrand, Penfield, et al.; 1. The rocks above the impact feature are layers of marl and limestone reaching to a depth of almost . These rocks date back as far as the Paleocene.Hildebrand, Penfield, et al.; 3. Below these layers lie more than of andesite glass and breccia. These andesitic igneous rocks were only found within the supposed impact feature, as is shocked quartz. The K‚ÄìPg boundary inside the feature is depressed to compared with the normal depth of about measured away from the impact feature.Hildebrand, Penfield, et al.; 4. Along the edge of the crater are clusters of cenotes or sinkholes, which suggest that there was a water basin inside the feature during the Neogene period, after the impact. The groundwater of such a basin would have dissolved the limestone and created the caves and cenotes beneath the surface.Kring, \\"Discovering the Crater\\". The paper also noted that the crater seemed to be a good candidate source for the tektites reported at Haiti.Sigurdsson. =Astronomical origin of asteroid= In September 2007, a report published in Nature proposed an origin for the asteroid that created the Chicxulub crater. The authors, William F. Bottke, David Vokrouhlick√Ω, and David Nesvorn√Ω, argued that a collision in the asteroid belt 160 million years ago resulted in the Baptistina family of asteroids, the largest surviving member of which is 298 Baptistina. They proposed that the \\"Chicxulub asteroid\\" was also a member of this group. The connection between Chicxulub and Baptistina is supported by the large amount of carbonaceous material present in microscopic fragments of the impactor, suggesting the impactor was a member of a rare class of asteroids called carbonaceous chondrites, like Baptistina. According to Bottke, the Chicxulub impactor was a fragment of a much larger parent body about across, with the other impacting body being around in diameter.Bottke, Vokrouhlicky, Nesvorny.Ingham. In 2011, new data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer revised the date of the collision which created the Baptistina family to about 80 million years ago. This makes an asteroid from this family highly improbable to be the asteroid that created the Chicxulub crater, as typically the process of resonance and collision of an asteroid takes many tens of millions of years. In 2010, another hypothesis was offered which implicated the newly discovered asteroid P/2010 A2, a member of the Flora family of asteroids, as a possible remnant cohort of the K/Pg impactor. =Chicxulub and mass extinction= The Chicxulub Crater lends support to the theory postulated by the late physicist Luis Alvarez and his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, that the extinction of numerous animal and plant groups, including non-avian dinosaurs, may have resulted from a bolide impact (the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event). Luis and Walter Alvarez, at the time both faculty members at the University of California, Berkeley, postulated that this enormous extinction event, which was roughly contemporaneous with the postulated date of formation for the Chicxulub crater, could have been caused by just such a large impact.Alvarez, W. interview. The age of the rocks marked by the impact shows that this impact structure dates from roughly 66 million years ago, the end of the Cretaceous period, and the start of the Paleogene period. It coincides with the K‚ÄìPg boundary, the geological boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene. The impact associated with the crater is thus implicated in the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event, including the worldwide extinction of non-avian dinosaurs. This conclusion has been the source of controversy. In March 2010, forty-one experts from many countries reviewed the available evidence: 20 years' worth of data spanning a variety of fields. They concluded that the impact at Chicxulub triggered the mass extinctions at the K‚ÄìPg boundary.Schulte, et al., 2010Rincon. In 2013 a study compared isotopes in impact glass from the Chicxulub impact with the same isotopes in ash from the boundary where the extinction event occurred in the fossil record; the study concluded that the impact glasses were dated at 66.038 ¬± 0.049 Ma, and the deposits immediately above the discontinuity in the geological and fossil record was dated to 66.019 ¬± 0.021 Ma, the two dates being within 19,000 years of each other, or almost exactly the same within experimental error. The theory is now widely accepted by the scientific community. Some critics, including paleontologist Robert Bakker, argue that such an impact would have killed frogs as well as dinosaurs, yet the frogs survived the extinction event.Kring, \\"Environment Consequences\\". Gerta Keller of Princeton University argues that recent core samples from Chicxulub prove the impact occurred about 300,000 years before the mass extinction, and thus could not have been the causal factor.Keller, et al. This conclusion is unsupported by radioactive dating and sedimentology. The main evidence of such an impact, besides the crater itself, is contained in a thin layer of clay present in the K‚ÄìPg boundary across the world. In the late 1970s, the Alvarezes and colleagues reported that it contained an abnormally high concentration of iridium.Alvarez. Iridium levels in this layer reached 6 parts per billion by weight or more compared with 0.4 for the Earth's crust as a whole;Web Elements. in comparison, meteorites can contain around 470 parts per billion of this element.Quivx. It was hypothesized that the iridium was spread into the atmosphere when the impactor was vaporized and settled across the Earth's surface among other material thrown up by the impact, producing the layer of iridium-enriched clay.Mayell. Similarly, an iridium anomaly in core samples from the Pacific Ocean suggested the Eltanin impact of about 2.5 million years ago. A more recent discovery is believed to demonstrate evidence of the scope of the destruction from the impact. In a March 2019 article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, an international team of twelve scientists revealed the contents of the Tanis fossil site discovered near Bowman, North Dakota that appeared to show the destruction of an ancient lake and its inhabitants at the time of the Chicxulub impact. In the paper, the group claims that the geology of the site is strewn with fossilized trees and remains of fish and other animals. The lead researcher, Robert A. DePalma of the University of Kansas, was quoted in the New York Times as stating that \\"you would be blind to miss the carcasses sticking out... It is impossible to miss when you see the outcrop.\\" Evidence correlating this find to the Chicxulub impact included tektites bearing \\"the unique chemical signature of other tektites associated with the Chicxulub event\\" found in the gills of fish fossils and embedded in amber, an iridium-rich top layer that is considered another signature of the event, and an atypical lack of scavenging of the dead fish and animals that suggested few other species survived the event to feed off the mass death. The exact mechanism of the site's destruction has been debated as either an impact-caused tsunami or lake and river seiche activity triggered by post-impact earthquakes; there has yet been no firm conclusion upon which researchers have settled. Multiple impact hypothesis In recent years, several other craters of around the same age as Chicxulub have been discovered, all between latitudes 20¬∞N and 70¬∞N. Examples include the disputed Silverpit crater in the North Sea, and the Boltysh crater in Ukraine.Stewart, Allen.Kelley, Gurov. Both are much smaller than Chicxulub, but are likely to have been caused by objects many tens of meters across striking the Earth.Stewart. This has led to the hypothesis that the Chicxulub impact may have been only one of several impacts that happened nearly at the same time. Another possible crater thought to have been formed at the same time is the larger Shiva crater, though the structure's status as an impact crater is contested.Mullen, \\"Shiva\\". The collision of Comet Shoemaker‚ÄìLevy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 demonstrated that gravitational interactions can fragment a comet, giving rise to many impacts over a period of a few days if the comet should collide with a planet. Comets undergo gravitational interactions with the gas giants, and similar disruptions and collisions are very likely to have occurred in the past.Weisstein. This scenario may have occurred on Earth at the end of the Cretaceous, though Shiva and the Chicxulub craters might have been formed 300,000 years apart.Mullen, \\"Multiple Impacts\\". In late 2006, Ken MacLeod, a geology professor from the University of Missouri, completed an analysis of sediment below the ocean's surface, bolstering the single-impact theory. MacLeod conducted his analysis approximately from the Chicxulub crater to control for possible changes in soil composition at the impact site, while still close enough to be affected by the impact. The analysis revealed there was only one layer of impact debris in the sediment, which indicated there was only one impact.Than. Multiple-impact proponents such as Gerta Keller regard the results as \\"rather hyper-inflated\\" and do not agree with the conclusion of MacLeod's analysis, arguing that there might only be gaps of hours to days between impacts in a multiple-impact scenario (cf. Shoemaker-Levy 9) which would not leave a detectable gap in deposits.Dunham. Expedition 364 Chicxulub is the only known Earth crater with a remaining impact peak ring, but it is under of sediment. During April and May 2016, a joint IODP-ICDP Mission Specific Platform Expedition no. 364 obtained the first offshore core samples from the peak ring, surrounding the central zone of the crater. During Expedition 364, DES drillers on the L/B Myrtle collected core samples to enable ECORD Science Party members to study how the peak ring formed and calculate the total impact energy. Their target depth was below the bottom of the ocean, but they reached an acceptable . Sample preparation and analysis were performed in Bremen, Germany. The center of the crater is near the village of Chicxulub Puerto, Yucat√°n. It was announced in November 2016 that pink granite, usually found deep in the Earth's crust, had been found in drilling samples.Chicxulub and the Exploration of Large Peak-Ring Impact Craters through Scientific Drilling (PDF). David A. Kring, Philippe Claeys, Sean P.S. Gulick, Joanna V. Morgan, and Gareth S. Collins. The Geological Society of America. 2017. It suggests the impact was so great it shocked and melted rocks found deep in the crust, causing them to shoot up before falling back down to produce the peak rings. The granite samples were also found to be lighter and weaker than normal granite, a result of the shock and extreme conditions of the impact. The findings confirmed that the rock comprising the peak ring had originated deep in the earth, and was ejected to the surface. It had been subjected to immense pressures and forces and had been melted by heat and shocked by pressure from its usual state into its present form in just minutes; the fact that the peak ring was made of granite was also significant, since granite is not a rock found in sea-floor deposits, originating much deeper in the earth, and had been ejected to the surface by the immense pressures of impact. Gypsum, a sulfate-containing rock usually present in the shallow seabed of the region, had been almost entirely removed and likely vaporized to enter the atmosphere, an event immediately followed by a megatsunami sufficient to lay down the largest-known layered bed of sand, around deep and separated by grain size, directly above the peak ring. These types of sand deposits are caused by extreme water movement, where the larger and heavier sand grains settle first, followed by lighter and smaller grains. Taken together, analyses indicate that the impactor was large enough to create a peak ring, to melt, shock and eject granite from many kilometers within the earth, to create colossal water movements, and to eject an immense quantity of vaporized rock and sulfates into the atmosphere, where they would have persisted over years to decades. This global dispersal of dust and sulfates would have led to a sudden and catastrophic effect on the climate worldwide, large temperature drops, and devastated the food chain. The researchers stated that the impact generated an environmental calamity that extinguished life, but it also induced a vast subsurface hydrothermal system that became an oasis for the recovery of life.Probing the impact-generated hydrothermal system in the peak ring of the Chicxulub crater and its potential as a habitat. (PDF) Barry J. Shaulis, Ulrich Riller, Charles Cockell, Marco J., and L. Coolen. Lunar and Planetary Science XLVIII (2017) A program on British television in 2017The Day the Dinosaurs Died, BBC2 television, July 1, 2017, 6 to 7 pm described that the drilling revealed, from top down: thick Cenozoic limestone, about ; a graded sediment deposit from the megatsunami, over thick; the impact melted basement granite from the Earth's midcrust with shocked quartz. The peak ring itself did not contain the calcium sulfate that the rocks in the area around contain, leading the program makers to conclude that all the calcium sulfate in the crater area had been vaporized into the atmosphere and had become a dense sulfur dioxide veil stopping the sunlight. As additional clues of the resulting megatsunami found in a New Jersey, US quarry, a dense marine bone bed was found on the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary containing a mixture of dead sea animals with little or no damage from scavengers or predators. Also related to this tsunami was a dense dinosaur bone bed on the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary found in Patagonia. A 2020 study mentioned that Expedition 364 drilled to a depth of below the sea floor to reach the peak ring, and discovered a massive hydrothermal system filled with magma, which modified ~1.4 √ó 105 km3 of Earth‚Äôs crust and lasted for hundreds of thousands of years; in addition, those hydrothermal system might support the impact origin of life hypothesis for the Hadean, when the entire surface of Earth was affected by impactors enormously larger than the Chicxulub impactor.

The name Unterwalden is first recorded in 1304, as the translation of Latin inter silvas (\\"between the forests\\"), the name for monastery possessions in the area. In 1291, Rudolf I of Germany purchased the estates at Stans, Alpnach and Giswil. From 1304, the local bailiffs used their own seal. In 1309, Henry VII confirmed the imperial immediacy of the territory of Unterwalden as part of the imperial bailiwick of Waldst√§tte (but not as a political entity in its own right). The Federal Charter, internally dated 1291, is thought to originate at this time. In the text, Unterwalden figures as communitas hominum Intramontanorum Vallis Inferioris \\"community of the men between the mountains of the Lower Valley\\" in; this is usually rendered as \\"the community of the Lower Valley of Unterwalden\\" in modern translations, and interpreted as Nidwalden or \\"Unterwalden proper\\". Unterwalden was one of the three participants in the foundation of the Old Swiss Confederacy, named in the Pact of Brunnen of 1315 with Uri and Schwyz. The division of Unterwalden into two separate territories, Obwalden and Nidwalden in the early period is less than clear. Their status as two independent Talschaften appears to develop over the courser of the 14th and 15th centuries, while they retain a single vote in the Confederacy. The flag of Unterwalden in the 14th and 15th centuries was divided horizontally into equal parts red over white, identical with the flag of Solothurn. After the accession of Solothurn to the Confederacy in 1481, there were two cantons with identical flags, sometimes disambiguated by modifying the design of Solothurn's flag. By 1600, Nidwalden was known as Unterwalden proper or Subsylvania, while Obwalden was known as \\"Unterwalden ob dem Wald\\", strictly speaking an oxymoron, as it were Subsylvania super silva. From this time, there are also two separate coats of arms for the two half-cantons, the red-and-white flag for Unterwalden proper or Nidwalden, while Obwalden had a silver key in a red field. By the 1640s, these two designs were re-combined in a white-and-red key on a red-and-white field (per fess gules and argent, a key paleways with double wards counterchanged) as the coat of arms of the united canton. In Early Modern Switzerland, Unterwalden counted as a single state in \\"foreign relations\\" with the other member states of the Swiss Confederacy, but it consisted of two separate states internally, with separate governments, jurisdictions and separate flags. Martin Zeiller in 1642 reports Unterwalden as divided in two separate Talschaften the inhabitants of which were derived from separate races, those of Obwalden from the \\"Romans\\", those in Nidwalden from the \\"Cimbri\\" (viz. Germans). Unterwalden was restored in the Act of Mediation (1803) with a single constitution, but with two separate capitals, Sarnen and Stans, and two separate cantonal assemblies with equal sovereignty.F√ºnfzehntes_Capitel_-_Verfassung_des_Kantons_Unterwalden Unterwalden was a canton of the Restored Swiss Confederacy of 1815,:wikisource:Translation:Federal Treaty of 1815 and it was listed as a canton in the constitution of 1848, as Unterwalden (ob und nid dem Wald).Bundesverfassung der Schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft. vom 12.

No.173366 Mural monument to Sir John Acton, 6th Baronet, Church of Santa Ninfa dei Crociferi, Palermo, Sicily Sir John Francis Edward Acton, 6th Baronet (3 June 1736 12 August 1811) was a French-born English gentleman who served as Commander of the naval forces of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and later as Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Naples under Ferdinand IV.Chambers Biographical Dictionary, , p.6 He served at Naples during the turbulent times when French Revolutionary fervour under Napoleon was sweeping across Europe and threatening to extinguish the monarchy he served. Origins John was born on 3 June 1736 at Besan√ßon in France, the son of Edward Acton, an English-born physician who had settled in that town, the great-grandson of Sir Walter Acton, 2nd Baronet (1623‚Äì1665) of Aldenham Park, Morville, in Shropshire, England. In 1791, aged 55, John succeeded his second cousin once removed as 6th Baronet. Career =Service in Tuscany= He served under his uncle in the navy of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and in 1775 commanded the Tuscan frigates in the Spanish-led Invasion of Algiers. Concerning the calamitous disembarkation in which the Spanish were drawn into a trap by the feigned retreat of the Algerines, the travel writer Henry Swinburne wrote that the Spaniards would have been \\"broken and slaughtered to a man ... had not Mr. Acton, the Tuscan commander, cut his cables and let his ships drive in to shore just as the enemy was coming on us full gallop. The incessant fire of his great guns, loaded with grape-shot, not only stop't them in their career but obliged them to retire with great loss.\\"Travels through Spain, in the years 1775 and 1776, Volume 1, Pages 61‚Äì62, By Henry Swinburne, Published 1787 =Service in Naples= In 1779 Queen Maria Carolina of Naples persuaded her brother the Grand-Duke Leopold of Tuscany to allow Acton, who had been recommended to her by Prince Caramanico, to undertake the reorganisation of the Neapolitan navy. The ability displayed by him in this led to his rapid advancement. He became commander-in-chief of both the army and the navy of the Kingdom of Naples, minister of finance, and finally prime minister. His policy, devised in concert with Sir William Hamilton, the English ambassador to Naples, aimed at removing Spanish influence from Naples and replacing it with that of Britain and Austria. The policy led to open opposition to France and the French party in Italy. The Neapolitan fleet, which when Acton entered the service of Naples had been practically non-existent, he had built up by 1798 to 120 ships with 1,200 cannon, while the land forces had increased fourfold from 15 to 60 thousand. Unfortunately in no degree were the interests of Naples promoted by the vainglorious policy thus inaugurated, which speedily resulted in disaster. Although Acton had aimed to extend the commerce of the country by increasing the facilities of internal communication and restoring some of the principal ports, the increased taxation required to support the army and navy more than counter-balanced these efforts and caused acute distress and general discontent. The introduction of foreign officers into the services, which had aroused the resentment of the upper classes, was further augmented when the fleet was placed under the orders of the British Admiral Horatio Nelson. Although Nelson and the British fleet had extinguished French naval power in the Mediterranean by his victory at the Battle of the Nile in August 1798, thereby saving the Kingdom of Naples from naval conquest by Revolutionary France, the French armies entered the north of Italy, where they met successes. In response in December 1798 the King and Queen, together with Acton, Hamilton (and his wife Lady Emma Hamilton), by order of Nelson were evacuated from Naples on board HMS Vanguard to the King's Sicilian capital of Palermo. Thereupon, freed of the royal presence, the Neapolitan citizens and nobles sympathetic to the ideals of the French Revolution promptly established the short-lived Parthenopean Republic, with the aid of the French. However the monarchy was restored in Naples five months later with the help of a Calabrian army, called the Sanfedisti, led by Cardinal Ruffo. To re-establish order and with the consent of the Queen and the help of Ruffo, Acton established at Naples the Junta of State, a reign of terror during which many prominent citizens were thrown into prison or executed. In 1804 Acton was removed from power, on the demand of France, but nevertheless advised the king, who had agreed to an alliance with Napoleon, to permit British and Russian troops to land at Naples. Shortly afterwards the minister was recalled, but when the French entered Naples in 1806, he together with the royal family again took refuge in Sicily. He died at Palermo on 12 August 1811 and was buried there in the church of Santa Ninfa dei Crociferi. Succeeds to baronetcy In 1791, aged 55, he succeeded to the Acton baronetcy and estates on the death of his second cousin once removed, Richard Acton, 5th Baronet of Aldenham Park in Shropshire. Marriage and issue On 2 February 1800, at the age of 63, he married his 13 year-old niece Mary Ann Acton, the eldest daughter of his younger brother General Joseph Edward Acton (1737-1830). The marriage appears to have been made for dynastic purposes to keep control of the family's wealth and required papal dispensation due to consanguinity. By his wife he had three children: *Sir Ferdinand Dalberg-Acton, 7th Baronet (1801‚Äì1837), eldest son and heir, whose son was John Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton, 1st Baron Acton. *Cardinal Charles Januarius Edward Acton (1803‚Äì1847) *Elizabeth Acton (1806‚Äì1850), who married Sir Robert Throckmorton, 8th Baronet, of Coughton Court, Warwickshire, and had issue. Death, burial & monument He died at Palermo on 12 August 1811, aged 75, and was buried there in the church of Santa Ninfa dei Crociferi, where survives his mural monument,See :File:JActonGravePalermo.JPG displaying sculpted (all in relief) his bust within a laurel circlet and antique trophy of arms above a pedimented sarcophagus in the form of a double-bodied winged Sphinx, inscribed in Latin as follows: :DOM hic jacet Joannes Acton Angliae dynasta vere egenorum pater.

The founder of the dynasty was Rabbi Yitzchak Meir Alter (1798‚Äì1866), known as the Chiddushei HaRim, after his primary scholarly work by that title. He was a disciple of Simcha Bunim of Peshischa, thus making Ger part of the Peshischa Hasidic grouping. Before the Holocaust, followers of Ger were estimated to number in excess of 100,000, making it the largest and most influential Hasidic group in Poland. Today, the movement is based in Jerusalem, and its membership is estimated at 11,859 families (as of 2016), most of whom live in Israel, making Ger the largest Hasidic dynasty in Israel. However, there are also well-established Ger communities in the United States and in Europe.  History  After the death of the Kotzker Rebbe in 1859, the vast majority of his followers chose Rabbi Yitzchak Meir Alter, the Kotzker Rebbe's closest disciple, as their new rebbe. At the time, Alter lived in Warsaw and led the main Kotzker shtiebel there (on ul. Zelazna). Shortly after accepting the role, Yitzchak Meir was appointed as Rav and Av Beit Din (head of the rabbinical court) of G√≥ra Kalwaria (Ger). Relocating to Ger, he became the founding rebbe of the Gerrer dynasty. During his seven years of leadership, the group flourished, causing it to be known as the \\"seven years of plenty\\". Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter in Europe After Alter's death in 1866, his followers wanted his eighteen-year-old grandson, Rabbi Yehudah Aryeh Leib Alter, to succeed him. When Yehuda Aryeh Leib refused to accept this position, most of the Hasidim became followers of the elderly Hasid, Rabbi Chanokh Heynekh HaKohen Levin, formerly rabbi of Prushnits and Krushnevits and then retired to Alexander. After Rabbi Chanokh Heynekh died in 1870, Yehudah Aryeh Leib (who became known post-humously as the Sfas Emes) acceded to the request of the Hasidim to become their next rebbe. Imrei Emes and his son Pinchas Menachem in Mea She'arim, Jerusalem The Gerrer movement flourished under the leadership of Yehudah Aryeh Leib and his eldest son and successor, Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter (known as the Imrei Emes). In 1926, in a bold departure for Polish Hasidim, Avraham Mordechai established a yeshiva in Jerusalem, naming it for his father, the Sfas Emes. The first rosh yeshiva was Rabbi Nechemiah Alter, a brother of the Imrei Emes. Today, the yeshiva remains the flagship of the Ger yeshivas. Under the leadership of the fifth Gerrer Rebbe, Rabbi Yisrael Alter, known as the Beis Yisrael, the Ichud Mosdos Gur (Union of Gerrer Institutions) was established as the responsible body for funding all the educational institutions affiliated with Ger in Israel. Currently, there are about 100 such institutions. The Beis Yisrael helped rebuild Ger after its virtual destruction in World War II.  Distribution of Gerrer Hasidim  Almost all Ger Hasidim living in pre-war Europe (approximately 100,000 Hasidim) were murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust. Avraham Mordechai Alter, who managed to escape, set about the task of rebuilding the movement in the British Mandate of Palestine. It is generally accepted that he was released by the Nazis, and was then able to move to Palestine, because of a very large ransom paid by his followers to the Nazis. Under its post-war leaders, the movement began to flourish again. With approximately 12,000 families, Ger is the third-largest Hasidic dynasty in the world today, comprising 9.2% of the world population of Hasidim. Large communities of Gerrer Hasidim exist in Israel, in Bnei Brak (2294 families / 19% of the Hasidic population), Ashdod (2218 families / 45%), and Jerusalem (1921 families / 12%), and a slightly smaller community of 1,027 families (6% of the Hasidic population) exists in the Borough Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. Smaller communities with hundreds of families have also been established in Israel, such as Arad, Beit Shemesh, Kiryat Gat, Hatzor HaGlilit, Haifa, Tel Aviv, and Petah Tikva. Internationally, hundreds of families reside in London, Antwerp, Zurich (where they are the largest Hasidic sect), Manchester, Monsey, and Lakewood, with tens more living in Los Angeles, Queens, Montreal, Melbourne, and Chicago. Ger maintains a well-developed educational network of Talmud Torahs, yeshivas, and kollels, as well as Beis Yaakov schools for girls. Its leaders dominate the Agudat Israel religious movement and political party in Israel.  Center  The group's headquarters is located in Jerusalem. During and after the British Mandate, the group's beth midrash was at the Sfas Emes Yeshiva, near Mahane Yehuda. Later on, the synagogue moved to Ralbach Street in the Geula neighborhood, and in the 2000s, the Great Beit Midrash Gur was inaugurated on Yirmeyahu Street, near the Schneller Orphanage complex. It is one of the largest synagogues in the world (nearly 30,000 sq. feet). Its construction is not complete yet. In 2015, the plans were changed, and construction of an extension to the building was begun. On Rosh Hashanah 2018 (5779), another wing of the Beth Medrash was inaugurated (together 80,000 sq. feet). Beginning with the emigration of the Imrei Emes to Israel, the rebbes of Ger lived in Jerusalem, with the exception of the current rebbe, who moved to Jerusalem only in 2012. The group has \\"shtieblach\\" in most ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods in the city. As other Hasidic courts, Ger also expanded in Jerusalem following the immigration of young couples from Europe and the United States. Rabbi Meir Silberstein is the rabbi of Ger in Jerusalem.  Split of the dynasty  After the passing of Rabbi Pinchas Menachem Alter (the \\"Pnei Menachem\\"), his brother's son, Rabbi Yaakov Aryeh Alter, was crowned Rebbe. Between him and the son of Pnei Menachem, Rabbi Shaul Alter, who was appointed by his father to rosh yeshiva of the Sfas Emes Yeshiva, differences of opinion emerged, especially on the subject of Torah study. With the Rebbe's instructions, it was discontinued to study in \\"depth\\" at Yeshivah of Ger, and in 2016, the Sfas Emes Yeshiva was closed. Following a ostracism signed by the leaders of the dynasty in Israel in June 2019 against the current Head of the Board of Camp Ger in the United States (in a case known as the Camp Ger dispute),https://www.kikar.co.il/322171.html in which the majority (including some of the leaders) of the community in the United States didn't partake, and even disobeyed it. A letter of criticism was written by Rabbi Shaul Alter against the establishment, of which the establishment of the dynasty in Israel didn't take lightly.https://www.kikar.co.il/323673.html The admirers of Rabbi Shaul were continuously harassed and shamed by the establishment. In the middle of the Holiday of Sukkos (October 2019), following anhttps://www.kikar.co.il/333834.html attempted reconciliation that failed between him and the Rebbe, Rabbi Shaul Alter's men announced the existence of a separate congregation of prayers on Simchas Torah. In response, the establishment of the dynasty announced that they would ban students from their institutions whose fathers would attend the separate prayers. During the holiday,https://www.kikar.co.il/333986.html hundreds of followers participated in separate prayers and gatherings. Students whose fathers participated in the separate prayers were removed from thehttps://www.kikar.co.il/333876.html Hasidic establishment's institutions. Immediately afterwards, Rabbi Shaul Alter's members announced a split and the establishment of a separate community and institutions, including \\"Yeshivas Pnei Menachem\\". The community in the United States, the source of the conflict, washttps://www.kikar.co.il/338782.html currently (2020) saved from the Establishment's removal from the institution's, and currently, both factions of the dynasty are united into one community, and are studying in the same institutions and praying in the same synagogues.  Identifying features of Ger  The men are distinguished by their dark Hasidic garb, and by their pants tucked into their socks, called hoyzn-zokn (not to be confused with the breeches, called halber-hoyzn, worn by men in some other Hasidic groups). They wear a round felt hat, and a high, almost-pointed kapel. They raise their sidelocks from the temples, and tuck them under the yarmulke, nearly hiding them. On Shabbos and Jewish holidays, married men wear the high circular fur hat of the Polish Hasidim, called a spodik by Galicianers (not to be confused with the much flatter shtreimel worn by married men in Hasidic groups which do not hail from Congress Poland). Ger follows the way of Menachem Mendel of Kotzk in stressing service of God in a sharp and objective way, as opposed to the mystical and spiritual orientation of other Hasidic groups. Ger also places much emphasis on Talmud study. Ger Hasidut produced one of the most prolific composers of Jewish liturgical music of all time, Yankel Talmud (1885-1965). Known as \\"the Beethoven of the Gerrer Rebbes\\",Bleich, Chanania. \\"Remembering Reb Yankel Talmud\\". Ami, 1 September 2013, pp. 128-132. Talmud composed dozens of new melodies every year for the prayer services, including marches, waltzes, and dance tunes. Though he had no musical training, and could not even read music, Talmud composed over 1,500 melodies, most of them sung by him and his choir in the main Ger synagogue in Poland and in Israel. Several of Talmud's compositions are still widely sung today, including his rousing \\"Shir Hamaalos\\" march tune, performed at many weddings, and \\"Lo Sevoshi\\", sung in Hasidic shtiebels.Mandelbaum (2005), p. 215.

In 1948, Rabbi Yisrael Alter established the \\"Ordinances on Holiness\\", known as the takanot (called takunes in the vernacular of Yiddish used by Ger Hasidim), which regulate daily living. The rules were passed on verbally, and were never written down until 2016, when a former member of the Ger Hasidic sect published them on Facebook. The takanot prescribe, for example, that a couple should not have sex more than twice a month, should do so silently and quickly, and the man should always be on top. In addition to rules about sexual relations, they include prohibitions for men on everyday activities such as combing one's hair, using soap on days other than Friday (in preparation for Shabbos), smoking, and reading the newspaper. The ordinances are reputed to have had a detrimental effect on the demand for Gerrer bachelors in the Hasidic match-making market. In 2009, a Gerrer woman, Sarah Einfeld, appeared in a short documentary film titled in English Shrew (in Hebrew, Soreret). During the filming, she decided to desert Ger, and to adopt a secular way of life. In her blog, she reported on the \\"repression\\" of women in Ger, highlighting the suppression of sexuality under the regime of these rules.  Abuse scandal  In December 2019, the son of Rabbi Yaakov Aryeh Alter was accused of abusing male yeshiva students. Ger allegedly did not notify authorities, and paid money to stop publication of these reports. A number of sources describe a cover-up of the incidents that allegedly took place over years and were known to at least one senior figure within Ger.

The oldest senior class society at the university, Skull and Bones has become a cultural institution known for its powerful alumni and various conspiracy theories. It is one of the \\"Big Three\\" societies at Yale, the other two being Scroll and Key and Wolf's Head Society. The society's alumni organization, the Russell Trust Association, owns the organization's real estate and oversees the membership. The society is known informally as \\"Bones\\", and members are known as \\"Bonesmen\\", \\"Members of The Order\\" or \\"Initiated to The Order\\".  History  Skull and Bones was founded in 1832 after a dispute among Yale debating societies Linonia, Brothers in Unity, and the Calliopean Society over that season's Phi Beta Kappa awards. William Huntington Russell and Alphonso Taft co-founded \\"the Order of the Skull and Bones\\". The first senior members included Russell, Taft, and 12 other members. Alternative names for Skull and Bones are The Order, Order 322 and The Brotherhood of Death. The society's assets are managed by its alumni organization, the Russell Trust Association, incorporated in 1856 and named after the Bones' co-founder. The association was founded by Russell and Daniel Coit Gilman, a Skull and Bones member. The first extended description of Skull and Bones, published in 1871 by Lyman Bagg in his book Four Years at Yale, noted that \\"the mystery now attending its existence forms the one great enigma which college gossip never tires of discussing\\". Brooks Mather Kelley attributed the interest in Yale senior societies to the fact that underclassmen members of then freshman, sophomore, and junior class societies returned to campus the following years and could share information about society rituals, while graduating seniors were, with their knowledge of such, at least a step removed from campus life.Yale: A History, Brooks Mather Kelley, (New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press, Ltd.), 1974. Skull and Bones selects new members among students every spring as part of Yale University's \\"Tap Day\\", and has done so since 1879. Since the society's inclusion of women in the early 1990s, Skull and Bones selects fifteen men and women of the junior class to join the society. Skull and Bones \\"taps\\" those that it views as campus leaders and other notable figures for its membership. Facilities =Tomb= The Skull and Bones Hall is otherwise known as the \\"Tomb\\". The tomb before the addition of a second wing The building was built in three phases: the first wing was built in 1856, the second wing in 1903, and Davis-designed Neo-Gothic towers were added to the rear garden in 1912. The front and side facades are of Portland brownstone in an Egypto-Doric style. The 1912 tower additions created a small enclosed courtyard in the rear of the building, designed by Evarts Tracy and Edgerton Swartwout of Tracy and Swartwout, New York.Yale University 1999 Princeton Architectural Press, Google Books Evarts Tracy was an 1890 Bonesman, and his paternal grandmother, Martha Sherman Evarts, and maternal grandmother, Mary Evarts, were the sisters of William Maxwell Evarts, an 1837 Bonesman. A 2009 view of the tomb from across High Street The architect was possibly Alexander Jackson Davis or Henry Austin. Architectural historian Patrick Pinnell includes an in-depth discussion of the dispute over the identity of the original architect in his 1999 Yale campus history. Pinnell speculates that the re-use of the Davis towers in 1911 suggests Davis's role in the original building and, conversely, Austin was responsible for the architecturally similar brownstone Egyptian Revival Grove Street Cemetery gates, built in 1845. Pinnell also discusses the Tomb's esthetic place in relation to its neighbors, including the Yale University Art Gallery. In the late 1990s, New Hampshire landscape architects Saucier and Flynn designed the wrought iron fence that surrounds a portion of the complex. =Deer Island= The society owns and manages Deer Island, an island retreat on the St. Lawrence River (). Alexandra Robbins, author of a book on Yale secret societies, wrote: Bonesmen Time magazine, Briton Hadden and Henry Luce. Skull and Bones's membership developed a reputation in association with the \\"power elite\\". Regarding the qualifications for membership, Lanny Davis wrote in the 1968 Yale yearbook: Like other Yale senior societies, Skull and Bones membership was almost exclusively limited to white Protestant males for much of its history. While Yale itself had exclusionary policies directed at particular ethnic and religious groups, the senior societies were even more exclusionary. While some Catholics were able to join such groups, Jews were more often not. Some of these excluded groups eventually entered Skull and Bones by means of sports, through the society's practice of tapping standout athletes. Star football players tapped for Skull and Bones included the first Jewish player (Al Hessberg, class of 1938) and African-American player (Levi Jackson, class of 1950, who turned down the invitation for the Berzelius Society). Yale became coeducational in 1969, prompting some other secret societies such as St. Anthony Hall to transition to co-ed membership, yet Skull and Bones remained fully male until 1992. The Bones class of 1971's attempt to tap women for membership was opposed by Bones alumni, who dubbed them the \\"bad club\\" and quashed their attempt. \\"The issue\\", as it came to be called by Bonesmen, was debated for decades.Robbins, pp. 152‚Äì159 The class of 1991 tapped seven female members for membership in the next year's class, causing conflict with the alumni association.Andrew Cedotal, Rattling those dry bones, Yale Daily News, April 18, 2006. The trust changed the locks on the Tomb and the Bonesmen instead met in the Manuscript Society building. A mail-in vote by members decided 368‚Äì320 to permit women in the society, but a group of alumni led by William F. Buckley obtained a temporary restraining order to block the move, arguing that a formal change in bylaws was needed. Other alumni, such as John Kerry and R. Inslee Clark, Jr., spoke out in favor of admitting women. The dispute was highlighted on an editorial page of The New York Times. A second alumni vote, in October 1991, agreed to accept the Class of 1992, and the lawsuit was dropped. Judith Ann Schiff, Chief Research Archivist at the Yale University Library, has written: \\"The names of its members weren't kept secretthat was an innovation of the 1970sbut its meetings and practices were.\\"Yalealumnimagazine.com While resourceful researchers could assemble member data from these original sources, in 1985, an anonymous source leaked rosters to Antony C. Sutton. This membership information was kept privately for over 15years, as Sutton feared that the photocopied pages could somehow identify the member who leaked it. He wrote a book on the group, America's Secret Establishment: An Introduction to the Order of Skull and Bones. The information was finally reformatted as an appendix in the book Fleshing out Skull and Bones, a compilation edited by Kris Millegan and published in 2003. Among prominent alumni are former president and Chief Justice William Howard Taft (a founder's son); former presidents and father and son George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush; Chauncey Depew, president of the New York Central Railroad System, and a United States Senator from New York; Juan Terry Trippe, Founder & CEO, Pan American World Airways (Pan Am); Joseph Gibson Hoyt, the first chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis; Supreme Court Justices Morrison R. Waite and Potter Stewart; James Jesus Angleton, \\"mother of the Central Intelligence Agency\\"; Henry Stimson, U.S. Secretary of War (1940‚Äì1945); Robert A. Lovett, U.S. Secretary of Defense (1951‚Äì1953); William B. Washburn, Governor of Massachusetts; and Henry Luce, founder and publisher of Time, Life, Fortune, and Sports Illustrated magazines. John Kerry, former U.S. Secretary of State and former U.S. Senator; Stephen A. Schwarzman, founder of Blackstone Group; Austan Goolsbee, Chairman of Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers; Harold Stanley, co-founder of Morgan Stanley; and Frederick W. Smith, founder of FedEx, are all reported to be members. In the 2004 U.S. Presidential election, both the Democratic and Republican nominees were alumni. George W. Bush wrote in his autobiography, \\"[In my] senior year I joined Skull and Bones, a secret society; so secret, I can't say anything more.\\" When asked what it meant that he and Bush were both Bonesmen, former presidential candidate John Kerry said, \\"Not much, because it's a secret.\\"Meet the PressGoogle Video Lore The number \\"322\\" appears in Skull and Bones' insignia and is widely reported to be significant as the year of Greek orator Demosthenes' death. A letter between early society members in Yale's archives suggests that 322 is a reference to the year 322 BC and that members measure dates from this year instead of from the common era. In 322 BC, the Lamian War ended with the death of Demosthenes and Athenians were made to dissolve their government and establish a plutocratic system in its stead, whereby only those possessing 2,000 drachmas or more could remain citizens. Documents in the Tomb have purportedly been found dated to \\"Anno-Demostheni\\". Members measure time of day according to a clock 5 minutes out of sync with normal time, the latter is called \\"barbarian time\\". One legend is that the numbers in the society's emblem (\\"322\\") represent \\"founded in '32, 2nd corps\\", referring to a first Corps in an unknown German university.Robbins, Alexandra. Secrets of the Tomb: Skull and Bones, the Ivy League, and the Hidden Paths of Power. Back Bay Books, 2003. Members are assigned nicknames (e.g., \\"Long Devil\\", the tallest member, and \\"Boaz\\", a varsity football captain, or \\"Sherrife\\" prince of future). Many of the chosen names are drawn from literature (e.g., \\"Hamlet\\", \\"Uncle Remus\\") religion, and myth. The banker Lewis Lapham passed on his nickname, \\"Sancho Panza\\", to the political adviser Tex McCrary. Averell Harriman was \\"Thor\\", Henry Luce was \\"Baal\\", McGeorge Bundy was \\"Odin\\", and George H. W. Bush was \\"Magog\\". =Crooking= Skull and Bones has a reputation for stealing keepsakes from other Yale societies or from campus buildings; society members reportedly call the practice \\"crooking\\" and strive to outdo each other's \\"crooks\\". The society has been accused of possessing the stolen skulls of Martin Van Buren, Geronimo, and Pancho Villa. Rumors about the club The group Skull and Bones is featured in books and movies which claim that the society plays a role in a global conspiracy for world control. There have been rumors that Skull and Bones is a branch of the Illuminati, having been founded by German university alumni following the order's suppression in their native land by Karl Theodor, Elector of Bavaria with the support of Frederick the Great of Prussia, or that Skull and Bones itself controls the Central Intelligence Agency.

Samael (, SammƒÅ æƒìl, 'Venom of God, Poison of God'\\"Samael\\" ‚Äì Jewish Encyclopedia or 'Blindness of God'; , Samsama'il or , Samail; alternatively Smil, Samil, or Samiel) is an archangel in Talmudic and post-Talmudic lore; a figure who is the accuser (Ha-Satan), seducer, and destroyer (Mashhit). Although many of his functions resemble the Christian notion of Satan, to the point of being sometimes identified as a fallen angel, in others he is not necessarily evil, since his functions are also regarded as resulting in good, such as destroying sinners. He is considered in Talmudic texts to be a member of the heavenly host with often grim and destructive duties. One of Samael's greatest roles in Jewish lore is that of the main angel of death and the head of satans. Although he condones the sins of man, he remains one of God's servants. He appears frequently in the story of Garden of Eden and engineered the fall of Adam and Eve with a snake in writings during the Second Temple period.Jewish Virtual Library ‚Äì Samael However, the serpent is not a form of Samael, but a beast he rode like a camel. In some traditions he is also believed to be the father of Cain,Jewish Encyclopedia ‚Äì Samael as well as the partner of Lilith. As guardian angel and prince of Rome, he is the archenemy of Israel. By the beginning of Jewish culture in Europe, Samael had been established as a representative of Christianity, due to his identification with Rome. In some Gnostic cosmologies, Samael's role as source of evil became identified with the Demiurge, the creator of the material world. Although probably both accounts originate from the same source, the Gnostic development differs from the Jewish development of Samael, in which Samael is merely an angel and servant of God.  Judaism  = Second Temple period and posteriority = Samael was first mentioned during the Second Temple Period and immediately after its destruction. He is apparently first mentioned in the Book of Enoch along with other rebellious angels. In Enoch 1 he is one of the Watchers who descended to Earth to copulate with human women, although he is not their leader, this being Semyaza. In the Greek Apocalypse of Baruch, he is the dominant evil figure. Samael plants the Tree of knowledge, thereupon he is banished and cursed by God. To take revenge, he tempts Adam and Eve into sin by taking the form of the serpent. He appears further as the embodiment of evil in the Ascension of Isaiah, often identified as: * Melkira (, melek ra, 'king of evil, 'king of the wicked'); * Malkira / Malchira (, malakh/malach ra, 'messenger of evil' or 'angel of iniquity'); * Belkira (prob. , baal qir, 'lord of the wall'); or * Bechira (, bachir ra, 'the elect of evil, chosen by evil'). The names Belial and Satan are also applied to him and he gains control of King Manasseh in order to accuse Isaiah of treason. =Talmudic-Midrashic literature= In Talmudic-Midrashic literature, Samael's role as an agent of evil is rather marginal, but from the fifth or sixth century onward, this name again becomes one of the most prominent among the demonic entities. In the Exodus Rabbah, Samael is depicted as the accuser in the heavenly court and tempting to sin, while Michael defends Israel's actions. Here, Samael is identified with Satan. While Satan describes his function as an \\"accuser,\\" Samael is considered to be his proper name. He also fulfills the role of the Angel of Death, when he comes to take the soul of Moses and is called the leader of satans. The title of satan is also applied to him in the midrash Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer, where he is the chief of the fallen angels. According to the text, Samael opposed the creation of Adam and descended to Earth to tempt him into evil. Riding the serpent, he convinces Eve to eat the forbidden fruit. His role here might be influenced by the Islamic idea of Iblis, who refused to prostrate himself before Adam because he consists of fire and Adam merely from dust. The midrash also reveals Samael fathered Cain with Eve. In the Midrash Konen, he is the ruler of the third hell. Several sources, such as Yalkut Shimoni (I, 110) describe him as the guardian angel of Esau relating him to Rome, the one who wrestled with Jacob, the angel who ordered Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, and a patron of Edom. =Kabbalah= In Kabbalah (A. E. Waite, 255), Samael is described as the \\"severity of God,\\" and is listed as fifth of the archangels of the world of Briah. Although both Samael and Lilith are major demons in earlier Jewish traditions, they do not appear paired until the second half of the thirteenth century, when they are introduced together. Lilith is a demon created alongside Adam, originally created for the role Eve would fill, who then becomes Samael's bride. With her, Samael created a host of demon children, including a son, the \\"Sword of Samael\\" (or Asmodai). In the Kabbalistic work Treatise on the Left Emanation, Samael is part of the Qliphoth, prince of all demons, and spouse of Lilith. The two are said to parallel Adam and Eve, being emanated together from the Throne of Glory as a counterpart. Asmodeus is also mentioned to be subservient to Samael and married to a younger, lesser Lilith. According to the treatise, God castrated Samael in order not to fill the world with their demonic offspring, this being the reason why Lilith seeks to fornicate with men. In the Zohar, one of Kabbalah's main works, Samael is described as a leader of the divine forces of destruction, being part of the Qliphoth. He is mentioned again as the serpent's rider, and is described as having mated with Eisheth Zenunim, Na'amah, and Agrat bat Mahlat, all being \\"angels\\" of sacred prostitution. Notably, the same work later calls him Azazel, which might be a case of mistaken identity, as Azazel may be himself in Zoharistic lore a combination of the angels Aza and Azrael. It is also said that the Baal Shem once summoned Samael to make him do his bidding. =Other tradition= Samael is also depicted as the angel of death and one of the seven archangels, the ruler over the Fifth Heaven and commander of two million angels such as the chief of other destroying angels. According to Gedulat Moshe (The Revelation of Moses), Samael is also mentioned as being in 7th Heaven:  Gnosticism  A lion-faced deity found on a Gnostic gem in Bernard de Montfaucon's L'antiquit√© expliqu√©e et repr√©sent√©e en figures may be a depiction of the Demiurge, Samael. In the Apocryphon of John, On the Origin of the World, and Hypostasis of the Archons, found in the Nag Hammadi library, Samael is one of three names of the demiurge, whose other names are Yaldabaoth and Saklas. After Yaldabaoth claims sole divinity for himself, the voice of Sophia comes forth calling him Samael, due to his ignorance.Gilhus, Ingvild S√¶lid. 1985. The Nature of the Archons: A Study in the Soteriology of a Gnostic Treatise from Nag Hammadi (CGII, 4). Otto Harrassowitz Verlag. . p. 44Fischer-Mueller, E. Aydeet. 1990. \\"Yaldabaoth: The Gnostic Female Principle in Its Fallenness.\\" Novum Testamentum 32(1):79‚Äì95. . In On the Origin of the World, his name is explained as \\"blind god\\" and his fellow Archons are said to be blind, too. This reflecting the characteristics of the Christian devil, making people blind, as does the devil in 2 Corinthians 4. Also Samael is the first sinner in the Hypostasis of the Archons and the First Epistle of John calls the devil as sinner from the beginning. These characteristics combined with his boasting conflates the Jewish god with the devil.M. David Litwa esiring Divinity: Self-deification in Early Jewish and Christian Mythmaking Oxford University Press, 2016 p. 55 His appearance is that of a lion-faced serpent.Fischer-Mueller, E. Aydeet. ‚ÄúYaldabaoth: The Gnostic Female Principle in Its Fallenness.‚Äù Novum Testamentum, vol. 32, no. 1, 1990, pp. 79‚Äì95. Although the Gnostics and Jewish originally used the same source, both depictions of Samael developed independently.Ivry, Elliot R. Wolfson. [1998] 2013. Perspectives on Jewish Thought. Routledge. . Samael is sometimes confused in some books with Camael, who appears in the Gospel of Egyptians also as an evil power, whose name is similar to words meaning \\"like God\\" (but Camael with a waw missing). The name might be explained, because in Jewish traditions, the snake had the form of a camel, before it was banished by God.  Anthroposophy  To anthroposophists, Samael is known as one of the seven archangels: Saint Gregory gives the seven archangels as Anael, Gabriel, Michael, Oriphiel, Raphael, Samael, and Zerachiel. They are all imagined to have a special assignment to act as a global zeitgeist ('time-spirit'), each for periods of about 360 years.Matherne, Bobby. 2003. \\"The Archangel Michael, GA# 67\\" (review).

This invention is of importance for the large- scale synthesis of fertilizers and explosives. The food production for half the world's current population involves this method for producing nitrogen fertilizers. Haber, along with Max Born, proposed the Born‚ÄìHaber cycle as a method for evaluating the lattice energy of an ionic solid. Haber is also considered the \\"father of chemical warfare\\" for his years of pioneering work developing and weaponizing chlorine and other poisonous gases during World War I, especially his actions during the Second Battle of Ypres. Early life and education Fritz Haber was born in Breslau (now Wroc≈Çaw, Poland), Prussia, into a well-off Jewish family. The family name Haber was a common one in the area, but Fritz Haber's family has been traced back to a great-grandfather, Pinkus Selig Haber, a wool dealer from Kempen (now Kƒôpno, Poland). An important Prussian edict of 13 March 1812 determined that Jews and their families, including Pinkus Haber, were \\"to be treated as local citizens and citizens of Prussia\\". Under such regulations, members of the Haber family were able to establish themselves in respected positions in business, politics, and law. Fritz Haber was the son of Siegfried and Paula Haber, first cousins who married in spite of considerable opposition from their families. Fritz's father Siegfried was a well-known merchant in the town, who had founded his own business in dye pigments, paints and pharmaceuticals. Paula experienced a difficult pregnancy and died three weeks after Fritz's birth, leaving Siegfried devastated and Fritz in the care of various aunts. When Fritz was about six years old, Siegfried remarried, to Hedwig Hamburger. Siegfried and his second wife had three daughters, Else, Helene and Frieda. Although his relationship with his father was distant and often difficult, Fritz developed close relationships with his step-mother and his half-sisters. By the time Fritz was born, the Habers had to some extent assimilated into German society. Fritz attended primary school at the Johanneum School, a \\"simultaneous school\\" open equally to Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish students. At age 11, he went to school at the St. Elizabeth classical school, in a class evenly divided between Protestant and Jewish students. His family supported the Jewish community and continued to observe many Jewish traditions, but were not strongly associated with the synagogue. Fritz Haber identified strongly as German, less so as Jewish. Fritz Haber successfully passed his examinations at the St. Elizabeth High School in Breslau in September 1886. Although his father wished him to apprentice in the dye company, Fritz obtained his father's permission to study chemistry, at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin (today the Humboldt University of Berlin), with the director of the Institute for Chemistry, A. W. Hofmann. Haber was disappointed by his initial winter semester (1886‚Äì87) in Berlin, and arranged to attend the Heidelberg University for the summer semester of 1887, where he studied under Robert Bunsen. He then returned to Berlin, to the Technical College of Charlottenburg (today the Technical University of Berlin). In the summer of 1889 Haber left university to perform a legally required year of voluntary service in the Sixth Field Artillery Regiment. Upon its completion, he returned to Charlottenburg where he became a student of Carl Liebermann. In addition to Liebermann's lectures on organic chemistry, Haber also attended lectures by Otto Witt on the chemical technology of dyes. Liebermann assigned Haber to work on reactions with piperonal for his thesis topic, published as Ueber einige Derivate des Piperonals (About a Few piperonal Derivatives) in 1891. Haber received his doctorate cum laude from Friedrich Wilhelm University in May 1891, after presenting his work to a board of examiners from the University of Berlin, since Charlottenburg was not yet accredited to grant doctorates. With his degree, Fritz returned to Breslau to work at his father's chemical business. They did not get along well. Through Siegfried's connections, Fritz was assigned a series of practical apprenticeships in different chemical companies, to gain experience. These included Gr√ºnwald and Company (a Budapest distillers), an Austrian ammonia-sodium factory, and the Feldm√ºhle paper and cellulose works. Haber realized, based on these experiences, that he needed to learn more about technical processes, and persuaded his father to let him spend a semester at Polytechnic College in Z√ºrich (now the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology), studying with Georg Lunge. In fall of 1892, Haber returned again to Breslau to work in his father's company, but the two men continued to clash and Siegfried finally accepted that they could not work well together. Early career Haber then sought an academic appointment, first working as an independent assistant to Ludwig Knorr at the University of Jena between 1892 and 1894. During his time in Jena, Haber converted from Judaism to Lutheranism, possibly in an attempt to improve his chances of getting a better academic or military position. Knorr recommended Haber to Carl Engler, a chemistry professor at the University of Karlsruhe who was intensely interested in the chemical technology of dye and the dye industry, and the study of synthetic materials for textiles. Engler referred Haber to a colleague in Karlsruhe, Hans Bunte, who made Haber an Assistent in 1894. Bunte suggested that Haber examine the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons. By making careful quantitative analyses, Haber was able to establish that \\"the thermal stability of the carbon-carbon bond is greater than that of the carbon-hydrogen bond in aromatic compounds and smaller in aliphatic compounds\\", a classic result in the study of pyrolysis of hydrocarbons. This work became Haber's habilitation thesis. Haber was appointed a Privatdozent in Bunte's institute, taking on teaching duties related to the area of dye technology, and continuing to work on the combustion of gases. In 1896, the university supported him in traveling to Silesia, Saxony, and Austria to learn about advances in dye technology. In 1897 Haber made a similar trip to learn about developments in electrochemistry. He had been interested in the area for some time, and had worked with another privatdozent, Hans Luggin, who gave theoretical lectures in electrochemistry and physical chemistry. Haber's 1898 book Grundriss der technischen Elektrochemie auf theoretischer Grundlage (Outline of technical electrochemistry based on theoretical foundations) attracted considerable attention, particularly his work on the reduction of nitrobenzene. In the book's foreword, Haber expresses his gratitude to Luggin, who died on 5 December 1899. Haber collaborated with others in the area as well, including Georg Bredig, a student and later an assistant of Wilhelm Ostwald in Leipzig. Bunte and Engler supported an application for further authorization of Haber's teaching activities, and on 6 December 1898, Haber was invested with the title of Extraordinarius and an associate professorship, by order of the Grand Duke Friedrich von Baden. Haber worked in a variety of areas while at Karlsruhe, making significant contributions in several areas. In the area of dye and textiles, he and Friedrich Bran were able to theoretically explain steps in textile printing processes developed by Adolf Holz. Discussions with Carl Engler prompted Haber to explain autoxidation in electrochemical terms, differentiating between dry and wet autoxidation. Haber's examinations of the thermodynamics of the reaction of solids confirmed that Faraday's laws hold for the electrolysis of crystalline salts. This work led to a theoretical basis for the glass electrode and the measurement of electrolytic potentials. Haber's work on irreversible and reversible forms of electrochemical reduction are considered classics in the field of electrochemistry. He also studied the passivity of non-rare metals and the effects of electric current on corrosion of metals. In addition, Haber published his second book, Thermodynamik technischer Gasreaktionen : sieben Vorlesungen (1905) trans. Thermodynamics of technical gas-reactions : seven lectures (1908), later regarded as \\"a model of accuracy and critical insight\\" in the field of chemical thermodynamics. In 1906, Max Le Blanc, chair of the physical chemistry department at Karlsruhe, accepted a position at the University of Leipzig. After receiving recommendations from a search committee, the Ministry of Education in Baden offered the full professorship for physical chemistry at Karlsruhe to Fritz Haber, who accepted the offer. Nobel Prize During his time at University of Karlsruhe from 1894 to 1911, Haber and his assistant Robert Le Rossignol invented the Haber‚ÄìBosch process, which is the catalytic formation of ammonia from hydrogen and atmospheric nitrogen under conditions of high temperature and pressure. This discovery was a direct consequence of Le Ch√¢telier's principle, announced in 1884, which states that when a system is in equilibrium and one of the factors affecting it is changed, the system will respond by minimizing the effect of the change. Since it was known how to decompose ammonia on nickel based catalyst, one could derive from Le Ch√¢telier's principle that the reaction could be reversed to produce ammonia at high temperature and pressure (a process that Henry Louis Le Ch√¢telier had even tried himself but gave up after his technician almost killed himself, due to an oxygen intake related explosion). To further develop the process for large-scale ammonia production, Haber turned to industry. Teaming with Carl Bosch at BASF, the process was successfully scaled-up to produce commercial quantities of ammonia. The Haber‚ÄìBosch process was a milestone in industrial chemistry. The production of nitrogen-based products such as fertilizer and chemical feedstocks, previously dependent on acquisition of ammonia from limited natural deposits, now became possible using an easily available, abundant base ‚Äî atmospheric nitrogen. The ability to produce much larger quantities of nitrogen-based fertilizers in turn supported much greater agricultural yields and prevented billions of people from starving to death. The discovery of a new way of producing ammonia had other significant economic impacts as well. Chile had been a major (and almost unique) producer of natural deposits such as sodium nitrate (caliche). After the introduction of the Haber process, naturally extracted nitrate production in Chile fell from 2.5 million tons (employing 60,000 workers and selling at US$45/ton) in 1925 to just 800,000 tons, produced by 14,133 workers, and selling at $19/ton in 1934. The annual world production of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer is currently more than 100 million tons. The food base of half of the current world population is based on the Haber‚ÄìBosch process.Albrecht, J√∂rg (2008) \\"Brot und Kriege aus der Luft\\". Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. p. 77 (Data from \\"Nature Geosience\\"). Haber was awarded the 1918 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work (he actually received the award in 1919). Haber was also active in the research on combustion reactions, the separation of gold from sea water, adsorption effects, electrochemistry, and free radical research (see Fenton's reagent). A large part of his work from 1911 to 1933 was done at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry at Berlin-Dahlem. In 1953, this institute was renamed for him. He is sometimes credited, incorrectly, with first synthesizing MDMA (which was first synthesized by Merck KGaA chemist Anton K√∂llisch in 1912). World War I Haber greeted World War I with enthusiasm, joining 92 other German intellectuals in signing the Manifesto of the Ninety-Three in October 1914. Haber played a major role in the development of the non-ballistic use of chemical warfare in World War I, in spite of the proscription of their use in shells by the Hague Convention of 1907 (to which Germany was a signatory). He was promoted to the rank of captain and made head of the Chemistry Section in the Ministry of War soon after the war began. In addition to leading the teams developing chlorine gas and other deadly gases for use in trench warfare, Haber was on hand personally when it was first released by the German military at the Second Battle of Ypres (22 April to 25 May 1915) in Belgium. Haber also helped to develop gas masks with adsorbent filters which could protect against such weapons. A special troop was formed for gas warfare (Pioneer Regiments 35 and 36) under the command of Otto Peterson, with Haber and Friedrich Kerschbaum as advisors. Haber actively recruited physicists, chemists, and other scientists to be transferred to the unit. Future Nobel laureates James Franck, Gustav Hertz, and Otto Hahn served as gas troops in Haber's unit. In 1914 and 1915, before the Second Battle of Ypres, Haber's unit investigated reports that the French had deployed Turpenite, a supposed chemical weapon, against German soldiers.Richter, Donald C. Chemical Soldiers: British Gas Warfare in World War I. University Press of Kansas: 1992. Page 6. Gas warfare in World War I was, in a sense, the war of the chemists, with Haber pitted against French Nobel laureate chemist Victor Grignard. Regarding war and peace, Haber once said, \\"during peace time a scientist belongs to the World, but during war time he belongs to his country.\\" This was an example of the ethical dilemmas facing chemists at that time. Haber was a patriotic German who was proud of his service during World War I, for which he was decorated. He was even given the rank of captain by the Kaiser, which Haber had been denied 25 years earlier during his compulsory military service. In his studies of the effects of poison gas, Haber noted that exposure to a low concentration of a poisonous gas for a long time often had the same effect (death) as exposure to a high concentration for a short time. He formulated a simple mathematical relationship between the gas concentration and the necessary exposure time. This relationship became known as Haber's rule. Haber defended gas warfare against accusations that it was inhumane, saying that death was death, by whatever means it was inflicted and referred to history: \\"The disapproval that the knight had for the man with the firearm is repeated in the soldier who shoots with steel bullets towards the man who confronts him with chemical weapons. [...] The gas weapons are not at all more cruel than the flying iron pieces; on the contrary, the fraction of fatal gas diseases is comparatively smaller, the mutilations are missing\\".Haber, Fritz (1924). Die Chemie im Kriege: F√ºnf Vortr√§ge (1920‚Äì1923) √ºber Giftgas, Sprengstoff und Kunstd√ºnger im Ersten Weltkrieg. Berlin: Comino Verlag (reprint 2020), p. 50. During the 1920s, scientists working at his institute developed the cyanide gas formulation Zyklon A, which was used as an insecticide, especially as a fumigant in grain stores. Haber received much criticism for his involvement in the development of chemical weapons in pre-World War II Germany, both from contemporaries and from modern-day scientists. Personal life and family Clara Immerwahr Haber met Clara Immerwahr in Breslau in 1889, while he was serving his required year in the military. Clara was the daughter of a chemist who owned a sugar factory, and was the first woman to earn a PhD (in chemistry) at the University of Breslau. She converted from Judaism to Christianity in 1897, several years before she and Haber became engaged. They were married on 3 August 1901; their son Hermann was born on 1 June 1902. Clara was a women's rights activist and according to some accounts, a pacifist. Intelligent and a perfectionist, she became increasingly depressed after her marriage and the loss of her career. On 2 May 1915, following an argument with Haber, Clara committed suicide in their garden by shooting herself in the heart with his service revolver. She did not die immediately, and was found by her 12-year-old son, Hermann, who had heard the shots. Her reasons for suicide have been the subject of ongoing speculation. There were multiple stresses in the marriage, and it has been suggested that she opposed Haber's work in chemical warfare. According to this view, her suicide may have been in part a response to Haber's having personally overseen the first successful use of chlorine gas during the Second Battle of Ypres, resulting in over 67,000 casualties. Haber left within days for the Eastern Front to oversee gas release against the Russian Army. Originally buried in Dahlem, Clara's remains were later transferred at her husband's request to Basel, where she is buried next to him. Haber married his second wife, Charlotte Nathan, on 25 October 1917 in Berlin. Charlotte, like Clara, converted from Judaism to Christianity before marrying Haber. The couple had two children, Eva-Charlotte and Ludwig-Fritz (\\"Lutz\\"). Again, however, there were conflicts, and the couple were divorced as of 6 December 1927. Hermann Haber lived in France until 1941, but was unable to obtain French citizenship. When Germany invaded France during World War II, Hermann and his wife and three daughters escaped internment on a French ship travelling from Marseilles to the Caribbean. From there, they obtained visas allowing them to immigrate to the United States. Hermann's wife Margarethe died after the end of the war, and Hermann committed suicide in 1946. His oldest daughter, Claire, committed suicide in 1949; also a chemist, she had been told her research into an antidote for the effects of chlorine gas was being set aside, as work on the atomic bomb was taking precedence. Fritz Haber's other son, Ludwig Fritz Haber (1921‚Äì2004), became an eminent British economist and wrote a history of chemical warfare in World War I,The Poisonous Cloud (1986). His daughter, Eva, lived in Kenya for many years, returning to England in the 1950s. She died in 2015, leaving three children, five grandchildren and eight great- grandchildren. Several members of Haber's extended family died in Nazi concentration camps, including his half-sister Frieda's daughter, Hilde Gl√ºcksmann, her husband, and their two children. Between World Wars From 1919 to 1923 Haber continued to be involved in Germany's secret development of chemical weapons, working with Hugo Stoltzenberg, and helping both Spain and Russia in the development of chemical gases. From 1919 to 1925, in response to a request made by German ambassador to Japan Wilhelm Solf for Japanese support for German scholars in times of financial hardship, a Japanese businessman named Hoshi Hajime, the president of Hoshi Pharmaceutical Company donated two million Reichsmark to the Kaiser Wilhelm Society as the ‚ÄòJapan Fund‚Äô (Hoshi- Ausschuss). Haber was asked to manage the fund, and was invited by Hoshi to Japan in 1924. Haber offered a number of chemical licenses to Hoshi's company, but the offers were refused. The money from the Fund was used to support the work of Richard Willst√§tter, Max Planck, Otto Hahn, Leo Szilard, and others. In the 1920s, Haber searched exhaustively for a method to extract gold from sea water, and published a number of scientific papers on the subject. After years of research, he concluded that the concentration of gold dissolved in sea water was much lower than those reported by earlier researchers, and that gold extraction from sea water was uneconomic.Morris Goran, The Story of Fritz Haber, Norman: Univ. of Oklahoma Press, 1967. By 1931, Haber was increasingly concerned about the rise of National Socialism in Germany, and the possible safety of his friends, associates, and family. Under the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service of 7 April 1933, Jewish scientists at the Kaiser Wilhelm Society were particularly targeted. The Zeitschrift f√ºr die gesamte Naturwissenschaft (\\"Journal for all natural sciences\\") charged that \\"The founding of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes in Dahlem was the prelude to an influx of Jews into the physical sciences. The directorship of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical and Electrochemistry was given to the Jew, F. Haber, the nephew of the big-time Jewish profiteer Koppel\\". (Koppel was not actually related to Haber.) Haber was stunned by these developments, since he assumed that his conversion to Christianity and his services to the state during World War I should have made him a German patriot. Ordered to dismiss all Jewish personnel, Haber attempted to delay their departures long enough to find them somewhere to go. As of 30 April 1933, Haber wrote to Bernhard Rust, the national and Prussian minister of Education, and to Max Planck, president of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, to tender his resignation as the director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, and as a professor at the university, effective 1 October 1933. He said that although as a converted Jew he might be legally entitled to remain in his position, he no longer wished to do so. Haber and his son Hermann also urged that Haber's children by Charlotte Nathan, at boarding school in Germany, should leave the country. Charlotte and the children moved to the United Kingdom around 1933 or 1934. After the war, Charlotte's children became British citizens. Death The grave of Fritz Haber and Clara Haber (n√©e Immerwahr) in the H√∂rnli graveyard of Basel, Switzerland Haber left Dahlem in August 1933, staying briefly in Paris, Spain, and Switzerland. He was in extremely poor health during these travels, eventually suffering fatally from what was either a stroke or heart attack. In the meantime, some of the scientists who had been Haber's counterparts and competitors in England during World War I now helped him and others to leave Germany. Brigadier Harold Hartley, Sir William Jackson Pope and Frederick G. Donnan arranged for Haber to be officially invited to Cambridge, England. There, with his assistant Joseph Joshua Weiss, Haber lived and worked for a few months. Scientists such as Ernest Rutherford were less forgiving of Haber's involvement in poison gas warfare: Rutherford pointedly refused to shake hands with him. In 1933, during Haber's brief sojourn in England, Chaim Weizmann offered him the directorship at the Sieff Research Institute (now the Weizmann Institute) in Rehovot, in Mandatory Palestine. He accepted, and left for the Middle East in January 1934, travelling with his half-sister, Else Haber Freyhahn. His ill health overpowered him and on 29 January 1934, at the age of 65, he died of heart failure, mid-journey, in a Basel hotel. Following Haber's wishes, Haber and Clara's son Hermann arranged for Haber to be cremated and buried in Basel's H√∂rnli Cemetery on 29 September 1934, and for Clara's remains to be removed from Dahlem and re-interred with him on 27 January 1937 (see picture).A photograph of their gravestone in H√∂rnli Cemetery, Basel can also be found in the book written by Stoltzenberg. Estate and legacy Fritz Haber bequeathed his extensive private library to the Sieff Institute, where it was dedicated as the Fritz Haber Library on 29 January 1936. Hermann Haber helped to move the library and gave a speech at the dedication. In 1981, the Minerva foundation of the Max Planck Society and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJI) established the Fritz Haber Research Center for Molecular Dynamics, based at the Institute of Chemistry of the Hebrew University. Its purpose is the promotion of Israeli-German scientific collaboration in the field of Molecular Dynamics. The Center's library is also called Fritz Haber Library, but it is not immediately clear if there is any connection to the 1936 homonymous library of the Sieff (now Weizmann) Institute. The institute most closely associated with his work, the former Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry at Dahlem (a suburb of Berlin), was renamed Fritz Haber Institute in 1953 and is part of the Max Planck Society.

Thiessen describes Haber as a tragic figure who strives unsuccessfully throughout his life to evade both his Jewish ancestry and the moral implications of his scientific contributions. BBC Radio 4 Afternoon Play has broadcast two plays on the life of Fritz Haber. The description of the first reads: from the Diversity Website: The second play was titled The Greater Good and was first broadcast on 23 October 2008. It was directed by Celia de Wolff and written by Justin Hopper, and starred Anton Lesser as Haber. It explored his work on chemical warfare during World War I and the strain it put on his wife Clara (Lesley Sharp), concluding with her suicide and its cover-up by the authorities. Other cast included Dan Starkey as Haber's research associate Otto Sackur, Stephen Critchlow as Colonel Peterson, Conor Tottenham as Haber's son Hermann, Malcolm Tierney as General Falkenhayn and Janice Acquah as Zinaide. In 2008, a short film titled Haber depicted Fritz Haber's decision to embark on the gas warfare program and his relationship with his wife. The film was written and directed by Daniel Ragussis. In November 2008, Haber was again played by Anton Lesser in Einstein and Eddington. In January 2012, Radiolab aired a segment on Haber, including the invention of the Haber Process, the Second Battle of Ypres, his involvement with Zyklon A, and the death of his wife, Clara. In December 2013, Haber was the subject of a BBC World Service radio programme: \\"Why has one of the world's most important scientists been forgotten?\\". His and his wife's life, including their relationship with the Einsteins, and Haber's wife's suicide, are featured prominently in the novel A Reunion of Ghosts by Judith Claire Mitchell. The characters are named Lenz and Iris Alter. Haber's life and relationship to Albert Einstein was portrayed in Genius which aired on National Geographic Channel from 25 April to 27 June 2017.

It was founded as the first west coast-based record label of note in the United States in 1942 by Johnny Mercer, Buddy DeSylva, and Glenn E. Wallichs. Capitol was acquired by British music conglomerate EMI as its North American subsidiary in 1955. EMI was acquired by Universal Music Group in 2012 and was merged with the company a year later, making Capitol and the Capitol Music Group both a part of UMG. The label's circular headquarters building is a recognized landmark of Hollywood, California. Capitol is well known as the U.S. record label of the Beatles, especially during the years of Beatlemania in America from 1964 to 1967. Capitol's roster has included Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, Tina Turner, Paul McCartney, the Beach Boys, Brian Wilson, Megadeth, NF, Everclear, Katy Perry, Mary J. Blige, Halsey, the Beastie Boys, Juice Newton, The Kingston Trio, Neil Diamond, Luscious Jackson, Linda Ronstadt, Eagles, Beck, Avenged Sevenfold, Don Henley, Yellowcard, Sam Smith, Sparklehorse, Migos, Emeli Sand√©, Queen Naija.  History  =Founding= Songwriter Johnny Mercer founded Capitol Records in 1942 with financial help from songwriter and film producer Buddy DeSylva and the business acumen of Glenn Wallichs, owner of Wallichs Music City. Mercer raised the idea of starting a record company while golfing with Harold Arlen and Bobby Sherwood and with Wallichs at Wallichs's record store. On February 2, 1942, Mercer and Wallichs met DeSylva at a restaurant in Hollywood to talk about investment by Paramount Pictures. On March 27, 1942, the three men incorporated as Liberty Records (not Capitol's future sister label Liberty Records). In May 1942, the application was amended to change the label's name to Capitol Records. On April 6, 1942, Mercer supervised Capitol's first recording session where Martha Tilton recorded the song \\"Moon Dreams\\". On May 5, Bobby Sherwood and his orchestra recorded two tracks in the studio. On May 21, Freddie Slack and his orchestra recorded three tracks in the studio: one with the orchestra, one with Ella Mae Morse called \\"Cow-Cow Boogie\\" and \\"Air-Minded Executive\\" supervised by Mercer. On June 4, 1942, Capitol opened its first office in a second-floor room south of Sunset Boulevard. On that same day, Wallichs presented the company's first free record to Los Angeles disc jockey Peter Potter. On June 5, 1942, Paul Whiteman and his Orchestra recorded four songs at the studio. On June 12, the orchestra recorded five more songs in the studio, including \\"Trav'lin' Light\\" with Billie Holiday. On June 11, Tex Ritter recorded \\"(I Got Spurs That) Jingle Jangle Jingle\\" and \\"Goodbye My Little Cherokee\\" for his first Capitol recording session, and the songs comprised Capitol's 110th produced record. The earliest recording artists included co-owner Mercer, Johnnie Johnston, Morse, Jo Stafford, the Pied Pipers, Tex Ritter, Tilton, Paul Weston, Whiteman, and Margaret Whiting. Capitol's first gold single was Morse's \\"Cow Cow Boogie\\" in 1942. Capitol's first album was Capitol Presents Songs by Johnny Mercer, a three disc set with recordings by Mercer, Stafford and the Pied Pipers, all with Weston's orchestra. The label's other 1940s musicians included Les Baxter, Les Brown, Jimmy Bryant, Billy Butterfield, Nat King Cole, Sammy Davis Jr., Dinning Sisters, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Mary Ford, Benny Goodman, Skitch Henderson, Betty Hutton, Stan Kenton, Peggy Lee, Billy May, Les Paul, Alvino Rey, Andy Russell, Smilin' Jack Smith, Kay Starr, Speedy West, and Cootie Williams. Musicians on the Capitol Americana label included Lead Belly, Cliffie Stone, Hank Thompson, Merle Travis, Wesley Tuttle, Jimmy Wakely, and Tex Williams. Capitol was the first major west coast label to compete with major labels on the east coast such as RCA Victor, Columbia, and Decca. In addition to its Los Angeles recording studios, Capitol owned a second studio in New York City and occasionally sent mobile recording equipment to other cities. =Other genres= In 1946, writer-producer Alan W. Livingston created Bozo the Clown for the company's children's record library. Examples of notable Capitol albums for children during that era are Sparky's Magic Piano and Rusty in Orchestraville. Capitol also developed a noted jazz catalog that included the Capitol Jazz Men and issued the Miles Davis's album Birth of the Cool. Capitol released a few classical albums in the 1940s, some of which contained handsome heavily embossed, leather-like covers. These recordings appeared on the 78 rpm format and were subsequently reissued on the new LP format in 1949. Among the recordings: Brazilian composer Heitor Villa- Lobos' Choros No. 10, with contributions from a Los Angeles choral group and the Janssen Symphony Orchestra (1940‚Äì1952), conducted by Werner Janssen; Symphony No. 3 by Russian composer Reinhold Moritzovich Gli√®re; and C√©sar Franck's Symphony in D minor, with Willem Mengelberg and the Concertgebouw Orchestra. In 1949, Capitol opened a branch office in Canada and purchased KHJ Studios on Melrose Avenue adjacent to Paramount in Hollywood. By the 1950s, Capitol had become a huge label that concentrated primarily on popular music. The label's roster at that time included the Andrews Sisters, Ray Anthony, Shirley Bassey, June Christy, Tommy Duncan, Tennessee Ernie Ford, the Four Freshmen, the Four Knights, the Four Preps, Jane Froman, Judy Garland, Jackie Gleason, Andy Griffith, Dick Haymes, Harry James, the Louvin Brothers, Dean Martin, Al Martino, Skeets McDonald, Louis Prima, Nelson Riddle, Dinah Shore, Frank Sinatra, and Keely Smith. Capitol began recording rock and roll acts such as The Jodimars and Gene Vincent. There were comedy records by Stan Freberg, Johnny Standley, and Mickey Katz. Children listened to Capitol's Bozo the Clown albums. Although various people played Bozo the Clown on television, Capitol used the voice of Pinto Colvig, who was also the voice of Goofy in Walt Disney cartoons. Don Wilson also released children's records. In June 1952, Billboard magazine contained a chronicle of the label's first ten years in business.\\"The Record Decade, 1942-42.\\" Billboard, August 2, 1952, 49-82. =Ownership under EMI= Capitol logo from 1969 to 1978. Revived in 2017. In 1955, the British record company EMI ended its 55-year mutual distribution agreement with RCA Victor and acquired 96% of Capitol's stock for $8.5 million. EMI built a studio at Hollywood and Vine to match its state-of-the- art Abbey Road Studios in London. In 1957, EMI's classical label Angel was merged into Capitol. Some classical recordings were issued in high fidelity and stereophonic sound. These included William Steinberg and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, Leopold Stokowski with various orchestras (including the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra) and Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as light classical albums by Carmen Dragon and the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra and albums of film music conducted by Hollywood composers such as Alfred Newman. The Capitol of the World series introduced in 1956 and active into the 1970s encompassed German Beer Drinking Songs, Honeymoon in Rome, Australian Aboriginals, and Kasongo! Modern Music of the Belgian Congo. Many were produced by Dave Dexter Jr. This series contained over 400 albums. =Ownership under Universal Music Group= In 2012, the recorded music operations of EMI were sold to the Universal Music Group and the world headquarters were re-established in the Capitol Tower in Hollywood as part of the subsequent reorganization of the Capitol Music Group. Steve Barnett, previously an employee of Columbia, was hired as chairman and CEO of the division. Capitol filed a lawsuit against Vimeo, an online video-sharing website, for audio copyright infringement. Capitol filed the claim after users were visibly lip-synching to some of their tracks. Following legal action by Capitol against the ReDigi.com online company in April 2013, the latter was found to have violated copyright law. Capitol Records claimed that ReDigi was guilty of copyright infringement due to a business model that facilitated the creation of additional copies of Capitol's digital music files, whereby users could upload the files for downloading or streaming to the new purchaser of the file. ReDigi argued that the resale of MP3/digital music files is permitted under certain doctrines (\\"fair use\\" and \\"first sale\\") but the court maintained that the doctrines' application \\"was limited to material items that the copyright owner put into the stream of commerce.\\" In 2014, PGH Live Music joined the team and Katy Perry founded the record label Metamorphosis Music, starting a label venture with Capitol. The name of the label was later changed to Unsub Records in 2016. Also that year, Capitol rose to number two market share and won four categories at the Grammy Awards for music by Beck and Sam Smith. In 2018, Capitol's electronic division Astralwerks relaunched with a new team and moved its entire operations to Capitol's tower in Los Angeles. In December 2019, Jeff Vaughn was named President of Capitol Records, assuming his position as of January 1, 2020, and is based in Hollywood at the iconic Capitol Tower. Headquarters Capitol Records headquarters building Designed by Welton Becket with Louis Naidorf, a young architect from Becket's office, serving as project designer the thirteen-story, earthquake-resistant Capitol Records Tower is the world's first circular office building. Home to several recording studios, it is one of Hollywood's most distinctive landmarks. Although not intended as a tribute to record players, its wide curved awnings and tall narrow tower mimic the appearance of a stack of gramophone records atop a phonograph. The building was commissioned by EMI after its acquisition of Capitol Records in 1955 and was completed in April 1956. The building is north of the intersection of Hollywood and Vine and is the center of the company's consolidated West Coast operations. It was nicknamed \\"The House That Nat Built\\" after the financial success of Capitol singer Nat King Cole. The rectangular ground floor is a separate structure joined to the tower after it was completed. In September 2006, EMI announced that it had sold the tower and adjacent properties for $50 million to New York-based developer Argent Ventures. In mid-2008, a controversy erupted over a plan to build a condominium complex next door, igniting fears that the building's acoustic properties, specifically its underground echo chambers, would be compromised. It was announced in November 2012 that Steve Barnett would become chairman and CEO of Capitol Music Group and would be based at the Capitol Records Building. Capitol and artist Richard Wyatt Jr. restored his Hollywood Jazz Mural on the south wall of the Capitol Records Building. Studios Capitol's recording studios were designed to minimize noise and vibration, then newly important goals in the high-fidelity sound era. An inner wall floating on layers of rubber and cork was erected inside the building's concrete exterior walls, leaving a one-inch air gap to provide complete sound isolation. The facility also features subterranean echo chambers that allow engineers to add reverberation during the recording process. Eight trapezoidal chambers are located underground, with 10-inch concrete walls and concrete ceilings. Speakers on one side and microphones on the other permit an echo effect of up to five seconds. Studios A and B can be combined for the recording of orchestral music and symphonic film soundtracks. The first album recorded in the tower was Frank Sinatra Conducts Tone Poems of Color.  International operations  Capitol modified albums that were originally released in other countries on other labels. Albums released in the United States contained fewer tracks, usually no more than 11 or 12, compared to albums released in the United Kingdom due to differences in the method of publishing royalties were calculated in the two countries.Fox, Hank. \\"Disk Firms Swing to Less- Groove Policy\\" Billboard March 4, 1967: 10 Also, in the American market it was expected that albums would include the current hit single, whereas British albums typically did not duplicate songs released as singles. = The Beatles = Possibly the best-known treatment of an international artist's recordings was the label's release pattern for various albums by the Beatles. This began with Capitol's release of Meet the Beatles!, the first album by the band to be released by Capitol in the United States. It was based on the British album With the Beatles, which contained 14 tracks and a running time of around 35 minutes. Capitol removed five tracks (\\"Money\\", \\"You've Really Got A Hold On Me\\", \\"Devil in Her Heart\\", \\"Please Mister Postman\\", and \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\") and added both sides of the band's first American hit single (\\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" c/w \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\") and the British single's B-side, \\"This Boy\\". \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" was on the Beatles' first British album, Please Please Me. This resulted in Capitol releasing Meet the Beatles as a 12-track album with a duration of around 30 minutes and made it comparable with other American pop albums. It also provided Capitol with unreleased tracks for use in later US Beatles albums such as The Beatles' Second Album. Capitol also issued \\"duophonic\\" stereo releases of some recordings where the original master was monophonic. Capitol engineers split the single master mono track into two, boosted the bass on the right channel, boosted treble on the left channel and added a split-second delay between channels to produce a \\"stereo\\" release. This duophonic process meant that the Beatles' American fans occasionally heard a slightly different song from that heard by the rest of the world if they listened to the stereo version. This trend in the Beatles' American discography continued until 1967 when a new recording contract with EMI was signed. Unhappy with the way Capitol in the US and other companies around the world were issuing their work in almost unrecognizable forms, beginning in 1967 the Beatles gained full approval of album titles and cover art, track listing and running order in North America. Starting with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band Beatles' albums were released unmodified. The issue of 45 RPM singles featuring album tracks was also stopped. Instead, non-album tracks were issued as singles between album releases. = United Kingdom = Beginning in 1948, Capitol Records were released in the UK on the Capitol label by Decca. After its 1955 acquisition of Capitol, EMI took over distribution in 1956. EMI's Parlophone unit handled Capitol label marketing in the UK in later years. In 2012, EMI was sold to Universal Music Group. Universal Music started Capitol as an autonomous label in the UK with the rights to the Beatles' catalog. This marks the first time that Capitol in the UK operated as an autonomous label. = Canada = Capitol Records of Canada was established in 1949 by businessman W. Lockwood Miller. Capitol broke with Miller's company and formed Capitol Record Distributors of Canada Limited in 1954. EMI acquired this company when it acquired Capitol. The company was renamed Capitol Records of Canada Ltd. in 1958 after Miller's rights to the name expired. In 1959, Capitol of Canada picked up distribution rights for EMI's labels Angel, Path√©, Odeon, and Parlophone. In 1957, Paul White joined Capitol of Canada and in 1960 established an A&R; department independent of the American company to promote talent for the Canadian market. The division found native talent such as Anne Murray and EMI musicians from other countries. Beginning in 1962, Capitol of Canada issued albums by British musicians such as Cliff Richard, Helen Shapiro and Frank Ifield. They accepted the Beatles long before the American company. By 1967, they were distributing non-EMI labels such as 20th Century Fox, Buena Vista Records, Disneyland, and Pickwick. The company was renamed Capitol Records-EMI of Canada in 1974, before the EMI Music Canada name was adopted in 1993. EMI Music Canada was absorbed into Universal Music Canada in 2012. In 2016, Universal Music Canada donated the EMI Music Canada archives to the University of Calgary. https://musiccanada.com/news/universal-music-canada-donates-emi-music-canada- archive-to-university-of-calgary/ =Other countries= Capitol Latin focuses on Latin music artists in Latin America and the United States. It was founded in 1989 as EMI Latin and was renamed to Capitol Latin in 2009. Capitol Latin was merged with Universal Music Latin Entertainment in 2013.

The sum of all potential parallel universes that constitute reality is often called a \\"multiverse\\". While the three terms are generally synonymous and can be used interchangeably in most cases, there is sometimes an additional connotation implied with the term \\"alternate universe/reality\\" that implies that the reality is a variant of our own, with some overlap with the similarly-named alternate history. The term \\"parallel universe\\" is more general, without implying a relationship, or lack of relationship, with our own universe. A universe where the very laws of nature are different ‚Äì for example, one in which there are no Laws of Motion ‚Äì would in general count as a parallel universe but not an alternative reality and a concept between both fantasy world and Earth. Overview Fiction has long borrowed an idea of \\"another world\\" from myth, legend and religion. Heaven, Hell, Olympus, and Valhalla are all \\"alternative universes\\" different from the familiar material realm. Plato reflected deeply on the parallel realities, resulting in Platonism, in which the upper reality is perfect while the lower earthly reality is an imperfect shadow of the heavenly. The lower reality is similar but with flaws. The concept is also found in ancient Hindu mythology, in texts such as the Puranas, which expressed an infinite number of universes, each with its own gods. Similarly in Persian literature, \\"The Adventures of Bulukiya\\", a tale in the One Thousand and One Nights, describes the protagonist Bulukiya learning of alternative worlds/universes that are similar to but still distinct from his own. One of the first science fiction examples is Murray Leinster's \\"Sidewise in Time\\", in which portions of alternative universes replace corresponding geographical regions in this universe. \\"Sidewise in Time\\" describes it in the manner that similar to requiring both longitude and latitude coordinates in order to mark your location on Earth, so too does time: travelling along latitude is akin to time travel moving through past, present and future, while travelling along longitude is to travel perpendicular to time and to other realities, hence the name of the short story. Thus, another common term for a parallel universe is \\"another dimension\\", stemming from the idea that if the 4th dimension is time, the 5th dimension - a direction at a right angle to the fourth - are alternate realities. In modern literature, a parallel universe can be roughly divided into two categories: to allow for stories where elements that would ordinarily violate the laws of nature; and to serve as a starting point for speculative fiction, asking oneself \\"What if [event] turned out differently?\\". Examples of the former include Terry Pratchett's Discworld and C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia, while examples of the latter include Harry Turtledove's Worldwar series. A parallel universe (or more specifically, continued interaction between the parallel universe and our own) may serve as a central plot point, or it may simply be mentioned and quickly dismissed, having served its purpose of establishing a realm unconstrained by realism. The aforementioned Discworld, for example, only very rarely mentions our world or any other worlds, as setting the books on a parallel universe instead of \\"our\\" reality is to allow for magic on the Disc. The Chronicles of Narnia also utilises this to a lesser extent - the idea of parallel universes are brought up but only briefly mentioned in the introduction and ending, its main purpose to bring the protagonist from \\"our\\" reality to the setting of the books. Science fiction While technically incorrect, and looked down upon by hard science-fiction fans and authors, the idea of another \\"dimension\\" has become synonymous with the term \\"parallel universe\\". The usage is particularly common in movies, television and comic books and much less so in modern prose science fiction. The idea of a parallel world was first introduced in comic books with the publication of The Flash #123, \\"Flash of Two Worlds\\". In written science fiction, \\"new dimension\\" more commonly ‚Äì and more accurately ‚Äì refer to additional coordinate axes, beyond the three spatial axes with which we are familiar. By proposing travel along these extra axes, which are not normally perceptible, the traveler can reach worlds that are otherwise unreachable and invisible. Edwin A. Abbott's Flatland is set in a world of two dimensions. In 1884, Edwin A. Abbott wrote the seminal novel exploring this concept called Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions. It describes a world of two dimensions inhabited by living squares, triangles, and circles, called Flatland, as well as Pointland (0 dimensions), Lineland (1 dimension), and Spaceland (three dimensions) and finally posits the possibilities of even greater dimensions. Isaac Asimov, in his foreword to the Signet Classics 1984 edition, described Flatland as \\"The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions\\". In 1895, The Time Machine by H. G. Wells used time as an additional \\"dimension\\" in this sense, taking the four-dimensional model of classical physics and interpreting time as a space-like dimension in which humans could travel with the right equipment. Wells also used the concept of parallel universes as a consequence of time as the fourth dimension in stories like The Wonderful Visit and Men Like Gods, an idea proposed by the astronomer Simon Newcomb, who talked about both time and parallel universes; \\"Add a fourth dimension to space, and there is room for an indefinite number of universes, all alongside of each other, as there is for an indefinite number of sheets of paper when we pile them upon each other.\\" There are many examples where authors have explicitly created additional spatial dimensions for their characters to travel in, to reach parallel universes. In Doctor Who, the Doctor accidentally enters a parallel universe while attempting to repair the TARDIS console in \\"Inferno\\". Douglas Adams, in the last book of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, Mostly Harmless, uses the idea of probability as an extra axis in addition to the classical four dimensions of space and time similar to the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics, although according to the novel they were more a model to capture the continuity of space, time and probability. Robert A. Heinlein, in The Number of the Beast, postulated a six-dimensional universe. In addition to the three spatial dimensions, he invoked symmetry to add two new temporal dimensions, so there would be two sets of three. Like the fourth dimension of H. G. Wells' \\"Time Traveller\\", these extra dimensions can be traveled by persons using the right equipment. =Hyperspace= Perhaps the most common use of the concept of a parallel universe in science fiction is the concept of hyperspace. Used in science fiction, the concept of \\"hyperspace\\" often refers to a parallel universe that can be used as a faster-than-light shortcut for interstellar travel. Rationales for this form of hyperspace vary from work to work, but the two common elements are: #It is possible to enter and exit from this hyperspace with reasonable ease. #There is reason to enter the hyperspace and exit rather than conventional travel (usually, the reason being it's quicker than the conventional method). Sometimes \\"hyperspace\\" is used to refer to the concept of additional coordinate axes. In this model, the universe is thought to be \\"crumpled\\" in some higher spatial dimension and that traveling in this higher spatial dimension, a ship can move vast distances in the common spatial dimensions. An analogy is to crumple a newspaper into a ball and stick a needle straight through, the needle will make widely spaced holes in the two- dimensional surface of the paper. While this idea invokes a \\"new dimension\\", it is not an example of a parallel universe. It is a more scientifically plausible use of hyperspace. (See wormhole.) While use of hyperspace is common, it is mostly used as a plot device and thus of secondary importance. While a parallel universe may be invoked by the concept, the nature of the universe is not often explored. So, while stories involving hyperspace might be the most common use of the parallel universe concept in fiction, it is not the most common source of fiction about parallel universes. =Time travel and alternative history= British author H. G. Wells' 1895 novel The Time Machine, an early example of time travel in modern fiction Technically, alternative histories as a result of time travel are not parallel universes: while multiple parallel universes can co-exist simultaneously, only one history or alternative history can exist at any one moment, as alternative history usually involves, in essence, overriding the original timeline with a new one. As a result, travel between alternative histories is not possible without reverting the timeline back to the original. There are exceptions to the above, and an alternate history doesn't necessarily overwrite the old one. There are no rules written in stone regarding this. Modern ideas of time travel pose the idea of branching timelines, such as in Avengers: Endgame. Technically, if a timeline isn't explicitly stated to have been erased, it's still there. Parallel universes as a result of time travel can serve simply as the backdrop, or it may be a central plot point. The Guns of the South by Harry Turtledove, where the Confederate Army is given thousands of AK-47 rifles and ends up winning the American Civil War, is a good example of the former, while Fritz Leiber's novel The Big Time where a war between two alternative futures manipulating history to create a timeline that results in or realizes their own world is a good example of the latter. Subscribing to the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics, alternative histories in fiction can arise as a natural phenomena of the universe. In these works, the idea is that each choice every person makes, each leading to a different result, both occur, so when a person decides between jam or butter on his toast, two universes are created: one where that person chose jam, and another where that person chose butter. The concept of \\"sidewise\\" time travel, a term taken from Murray Leinster's \\"Sidewise in Time\\", is used to allow characters to pass through many different alternative histories, all descendant from some common branch point. Often, worlds that are more similar to each other are considered closer to each other in terms of this sidewise travel. For example, a universe where World War II ended differently would be \\"closer\\" to us than one where Imperial China colonized the New World in the 15th century. H. Beam Piper used this concept, naming it \\"paratime\\" and writing a series of stories involving the Paratime Police who regulated travel between these alternative realities as well as the technology to do so. Keith Laumer used the same concept of \\"sideways\\" time travel in his 1962 novel Worlds of the Imperium. More recently, novels such as Frederik Pohl's The Coming of the Quantum Cats and Neal Stephenson's Anathem explore human-scale readings of the \\"many worlds\\" interpretation, postulating that historical events or human consciousness spawns or allows \\"travel\\" among alternative universes. Universe 'types' frequently explored in sidewise and alternative history works include worlds whose Nazis won the Second World War, as in The Man in the High Castle by Philip K. Dick, SS-GB by Len Deighton, and Fatherland by Robert Harris, and worlds whose Roman Empire never fell, as in Roma Eterna by Robert Silverberg. Romanitas by Sophia McDougall, and Warlords of Utopia by Lance Parkin. =Counter-Earth= The concept of Counter-Earth might seem similar to a parallel universe, but is actually a distinct idea. A counter-earth is a planet that shares Earth's orbit but is on opposition, therefore, cannot be seen from Earth. There would be no necessity that such a planet would be like Earth in any way, although typically in fiction it is practically identical to Earth. Since Counter-Earth is not only within our universe but within our own Solar System, reaching it can be accomplished with ordinary space travel. Gerry and Sylvia Anderson used this concept in their 1969 movie Doppelg√§nger (released outside Europe as Journey to the Far Side of the Sun), in which a Counter-Earth is detected by astronomers and a manned mission launched by a US-European space consortium to explore it. Though not impossible, the idea is rather implausible - since none of the other planets in the Solar System has such a \\"twin\\" sharing its orbit. Over a long period of time, gravitational influences would make such an orbit unstable, resulting in a collision or repulsion of the two planets. H.G. Wells placed the world of his 1903 Modern Utopia within our own universebut much further away: However, Wells did not explain how such a precise duplication of our world could occur, nor how could a person be suddenly transported in twinkling of an eye from our world to the precise equivalent spot in that other world. =Convergent evolution= Convergent evolution is a biological concept whereby unrelated species acquire similar traits because they adapted to a similar environment and/or played similar roles in their ecosystems. In fiction, the concept is extended whereby similar planets will result in races with similar cultures and/or histories. Again, this is not a true parallel universe since such planets exist within the same universe as our own, but the stories are similar in some respects. Star Trek frequently explored such worlds: *In \\"Bread and Circuses\\" the Enterprise encounters a planet called Magna Roma, which has many physical resemblances to Earth such as its atmosphere, land to ocean ratio, and size. The landing party discovers that the planet is at roughly a late 20th-century level of technology but its society is similar to the Roman Empire, as if the Empire had not fallen but had continued to that time: there is also a reference to the Roman god Jupiter as the namesake of a new line of automobile, and gladiator fights are televised in primetime. Slavery on this world has also developed into an institution, with slaves guaranteed medical benefits and old-age pensions, so the workers grew more content and never rebelled. At the end of the episode, it is discovered that the society has just found their own version of Jesus, referred simply as \\"the son\\" (whose followers they had previously mistaken for sun worshipers). *In \\"The Omega Glory\\", the crew visit a planet on which there is a conflict between two peoples called the Yangs and the Kohms. They discover that the Yangs are like Earth's \\"Yankees\\" (in other words, Americans) and the Kohms are like Earth's Communists; the Yangs, who had at some point in the past been conquered by the Kohms, had a garbled speech that was almost identical to the American Pledge of Allegiance, and treated the U.S. Constitution as a sacred text. (A deleted scene from the episode, however, implied that both the Yangs and Kohms were actually descendants of human colonists.) *In \\"Miri\\", the Enterprise crew encounter a planet that is physically identical to Earth. Histories on the two planets were apparently identical until the 20th century when scientists had accidentally created a deadly virus that killed all the adults but extended the lives of the children (who call themselves the \\"Onlies\\"). The spin-off novel \\"Forgotten History\\" later established that the planet depicted here was actually an alternative version of Earth that was displaced into our universe, with the Enterprise later being sent into that universe and witnessing what happened to the history of the parallel universe without humanity's influence to help make first contact with the Vulcans and form the galactic Federation. =Convergent evolution due to contamination= A similar concept in biology is gene flow. In this case, a planet may start out differently from Earth, but due to the influence of Earth's culture, the planet comes to resemble Earth in some way. Star Trek also frequently used this theory as well: in \\"Patterns of Force\\", a planet is discovered to be very similar to Nazi Germany due to the influence of a historian that came to reside there, who believed that the Nazi fascism itself was not evil and under benevolent leadership could be \\"good government\\"; while in \\"A Piece of the Action\\", the Enterprise crew visits a planet that, 100 years after a book Chicago Mobs of the Twenties that had been left behind by previous Earth craft, their society resembles mob ruled cities of the Prohibition era United States. =Simulated reality= Simulated realities are digital constructs featured in science fiction such as The Matrix. The Parallel Universe Theory In 1954, a Princeton University doctoral applicant named Hugh Everett III concocted a final thought; that there exist parallel universes precisely equivalent to our Universe. These universes are entirely connected with our own; in fact, they branch far away from our own, and our Universe diverges from others. Inside these parallel universes, our wars have had unexpected results in comparison to those we as a whole know. Species that are wiped out in our Universe have developed and adjusted in others. In different universes, we people may get wiped out. Everett's give Many-Worlds Theory, as it came to be known, was his endeavor to respond to some unanswered inquiries raised by the consequences of examinations acted in the developing field of quantum material science. Ideas of parallel universes or measurements that look like our own have shown up in works of imagination and utilized as clarifications for mysticism. Fantasy =Stranger in a strange land= Oz and its surroundings. It is common in fantasy for authors to find ways to bring a protagonist from \\"our\\" world to the fantasy world. Before the mid-20th century, this was most often done by hiding fantastic worlds within unknown, distant locations on Earth; peasants who seldom, if ever, traveled far from their villages could not conclusively say that it was impossible that an ogre or other fantastical beings could live an hour away. Characters in the author's world could board a ship and find themselves on a fantastic island, as Jonathan Swift does in Gulliver's Travels or in the 1949 novel Silverlock by John Myers Myers, or be sucked up into a tornado and land in Oz. These \\"lost world\\" stories can be seen as geographic equivalents of a \\"parallel universe\\", as the worlds portrayed are separate from our own, and hidden to everyone except those who take the difficult journey there. The geographic \\"lost world\\" can blur into a more explicit \\"parallel universe\\" when the fantasy realm overlaps a section of the \\"real\\" world, but is much larger inside than out, as in Robert Holdstock's novel Mythago Wood. However, increasing geographical knowledge meant that such locations had to be farther and farther off. Perhaps influenced by ideas from science fiction, many works chose a setting that takes place in another, separate reality. As it is now not possible to reach these worlds via conventional travel, a common trope is a portal or artifact that connects our world and the fantasy world together, examples being the wardrobe in C. S. Lewis' The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe or the sigil in James Branch Cabell's The Cream of the Jest. In some cases, physical travel is not even possible, and the character in our reality travels in a dream or some other altered state of consciousness. Examples include the Dream Cycle stories by H. P. Lovecraft or the Thomas Covenant stories of Stephen R. Donaldson. Often, stories of this type have as a major theme the nature of reality itself, questioning whether the dream-world is as real as the waking world. Science fiction often employs this theme in the ideas of cyberspace and virtual reality. =Between the worlds= Through the Looking-Glass -- and the parallel universe Alice found there As mentioned above, in many stories the parallel universe mold is simply transport a character from the real world into the fantasy world where the bulk of the action takes place. Whatever method is used ceases to be important for the most of the story until the ending until the protagonists return to our world (assuming they do so). However, in a few cases the interaction between the worlds is an important element, so that the focus is not on simply the fantasy world, but on ours as well. Sometimes the intent is to let them mingle and see what would happen, such as introducing a computer programmer into a high fantasy world as seen in Rick Cook's Wizardry series, while other times an attempt to keep them from mingling becomes a major plot point, such as in Aaron Allston's Doc Sidhe our \\"grim world\\" is paralleled by a \\"fair world\\" where the elves live and history echoes ours, where a major portion of the plot deals with preventing a change in interactions between the worlds. =Fantasy multiverses= The idea of a multiverse is as fertile a subject for fantasy as it is for science fiction, allowing for epic settings and godlike protagonists. The most epic and far- ranging fantasy \\"multiverse\\" is that of Michael Moorcock, who actually named the concept in a 1963 science fiction novel The Sundered Worlds. Like many authors after him, Moorcock was inspired by the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, saying, \\"It was an idea in the air, as most of these are, and I would have come across a reference to it in New Scientist (one of my best friends was then editor) ... [or] physicist friends would have been talking about it. ... Sometimes what happens is that you are imagining these things in the context of fiction while the physicists and mathematicians are imagining them in terms of science. I suspect it is the romantic imagination working, as it often does, perfectly efficiently in both the arts and the sciences.\\"'' Unlike many science-fiction interpretations, Moorcock's Eternal Champion stories go far beyond alternative history to include mythic and sword and sorcery settings as well as worlds more similar to, or the same as, our own. The term 'polycosmos' was coined as an alternative to 'multiverse' by the author and editor Paul le Page Barnett (also known by the pseudonym John Grant), and is built from Greek rather than Latin morphemes. It is used by Barnett to describe a concept binding together a number of his works, its nature meaning that \\"all characters, real or fictional [...] have to co-exist in all possible real, created or dreamt worlds; [...] they're playing hugely different roles in their various manifestations, and the relationships between them can vary quite dramatically, but the essence of them remains the same.\\" =Fictional universe as alternative universe= There are many examples of the meta-fictional idea of having the author's created universe (or any author's universe) rise to the same level of \\"reality\\" as the universe we're familiar with. The theme is present in works as diverse as H.G. Wells' Men Like Gods, Myers' Silverlock, and Heinlein's Number of the Beast. Fletcher Pratt and L. Sprague de Camp took the protagonist of the Harold Shea series through the worlds of Norse myth, Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene, Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando Furioso, and the Kalevala ‚Äì without ever quite settling whether writers created these parallel worlds by writing these works, or received impressions from the worlds and wrote them down. In an interlude set in \\"Xanadu\\", a character claims that the universe is dangerous because the poem went unfinished, but whether this was his misapprehension or not is not established. Some fictional approaches definitively establish the independence of the parallel world, sometimes by having the world differ from the book's account; other approaches have works of fiction create and affect the parallel world: L. Sprague de Camp's Solomon's Stone, taking place on an astral plane, is populated by the daydreams of mundane people, and in Rebecca Lickiss's Eccentric Circles, an elf is grateful to Tolkien for transforming elves from dainty little creatures. These stories often place the author, or authors in general, in the same position as Zelazny's characters in Amber. Questioning, in a literal fashion, if writing is an act of creating a new world, or an act of discovery of a pre-existing world. Occasionally, this approach becomes self-referential, treating the literary universe of the work itself as explicitly parallel to the universe where the work was created. Stephen King's seven-volume Dark Tower series hinges upon the existence of multiple parallel worlds, many of which are King's own literary creations. Ultimately the characters become aware that they are only \\"real\\" in King's literary universe (this can be debated as an example of breaking the fourth wall), and even travel to a world ‚Äì twice ‚Äì in which (again, within the novel) they meet Stephen King and alter events in the real Stephen King's world outside of the books. An early instance of this was in works by Gardner Fox for DC Comics in the 1960s, in which characters from the Golden Age (which was supposed to be a series of comic books within the DC Comics universe) would cross over into the main DC Comics universe. One comic book did provide an explanation for a fictional universe existing as a parallel universe. The parallel world does \\"exist\\" and it resonates into the \\"real world\\". Some people in the \\"real world\\" pick up on this resonance, gaining information about the parallel world which they then use to write stories. Robert Heinlein, in The Number of the Beast, quantizes the many parallel fictional universes - in terms of fictons. A number of fictional universes are accessible along one of the three axes of time which Dr. Jacob Burroughs' \\"time twister\\" can access. Each quantum level change - a ficton - along this time axis corresponds to a different universe from one of several bodies of fiction known to all four travellers in the inter-universal, time travelling vehicle Gay Deceiver. Heinlein also \\"breaks the fourth wall\\" by having \\"both Heinleins\\" (Robert and his wife Virginia) visit an inter-universal science-fiction and fantasy convention in the book's last chapter. The convention was convened on Heinlein character Lazarus Long's estate on the planet \\"Tertius\\" to attract the evil \\"Black Hats\\" who pursued the main characters of The Number of the Beast through space and time in order to destroy Dr. Burroughs and his invention. Heinlein continues this literary conceit in The Cat Who Walks Through Walls and To Sail Beyond the Sunset, using characters from throughout his science-fictional career, hauled forth from their own \\"fictons\\" to unite in the war against the \\"Black Hats\\". Heinlein also wrote a stand-alone novel, Job: A Comedy of Justice, whose two protagonists fall from alternative universe into alternative universe (often naked), and after a number of such adventures die and enter a stereotypically Fundamentalist Christian Heaven (with many of its internal contradictions explored in the novel). Their harrowing adventures through the universes are then revealed to have been \\"destruction testing\\" of their souls by Loki, sanctioned by the Creator person of the Christian God (Yahweh). The Devil appears as the most sympathetic of the gods in the story, who expresses contempt for the other gods' cavalier treatment of the story's main characters. Thus, Job: A Comedy of Justice rings in the theological dimension (if only for the purpose of satirizing evangelical Christianity) of parallel universes, that their existence can be used by God (or a number of gods, Loki seems to have made himself available to do Yahweh's dirty work in this novel). It manages also to have a fictional multiverse angle in that references are made to Heinlein's early SF/fantasy short story \\"They\\", a solipistic tale in which reality is constantly being transmogrified behind the scenes to throw the central character off his guard and keep him from seeing reality as it is, which was set in the same Heinlein fictional universe as The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. =Elfland= Elfland, or Faerie, the otherworldly home not only of elves and fairies but goblins, trolls, and other folkloric creatures, has an ambiguous appearance in folklore. On one hand, the land often appears to be contiguous with 'ordinary' land. Thomas the Rhymer might, on being taken by the Queen of Faerie, be taken on a road like one leading to Heaven or Hell. This is not exclusive to English or French folklore. In Norse mythology, Elfland (Alfheim) was also the name of what today is the Swedish province of Bohusl√§n. In the sagas, it said that the people of this petty kingdom were more beautiful than other people, as they were related to the elves, showing that not only the territory was associated with elves, but also the race of its people. While sometimes folklore seems to show fairy intrusion into human lands ‚Äì \\"Tam Lin\\" does not show any otherworldly aspects about the land in which the confrontation takes place ‚Äì at other times the otherworldly aspects are clear. Most frequently, time can flow differently for those trapped by the fairy dance than in the lands they come from; although, in an additional complication, it may only be an appearance, as many returning from Faerie, such as Ois√≠n, have found that time \\"catches up\\" with them as soon as they have contact with ordinary lands. Fantasy writers have taken up the ambiguity. Some writers depict the land of the elves as a full-blown parallel universe, with portals the only entry ‚Äì as in Josepha Sherman's Prince of the Sidhe series or Esther Friesner's Elf Defense ‚Äì and others have depicted it as the next land over, possibly difficult to reach for magical reasons ‚Äì Hope Mirrlees's Lud-in-the-Mist, or Lord Dunsany's The King of Elfland's Daughter. In some cases, the boundary between Elfland and more ordinary lands is not fixed. Not only the inhabitants but Faerie itself can pour into more mundane regions. Terry Pratchett's Discworld series proposes that the world of the Elves is a \\"parasite\\" universe, that drifts between and latches onto others such as Discworld and our own world (referred to as \\"Roundworld\\" in the novels). In the young teenage book Mist by Kathryn James, the Elven world lies through a patch of mist in the woods. It was constructed when the Elven were thrown out of our world. Travel to and fro is possible by those in the know, but can have lethal consequences. =Isekai= Isekai, is a subgenre of Japanese fantasy light novels, manga, anime, and video games revolving around a normal person being transported to or trapped in a parallel universe. Often, this universe already exists in the protagonist's world as a fictional universe, but it may also be unbeknownst to them. Films The most famous treatment of the alternative universe concept in film could be considered The Wizard of Oz, which portrays a parallel world, famously separating the magical realm of the Land of Oz from the mundane world by filming it in Technicolor while filming the scenes set in Kansas in sepia. At times, alternative universes have been featured in small scale independent productions such as Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo's It Happened Here (1964), featuring an alternative United Kingdom which had undergone Operation Sea Lion in 1940 and had been defeated and occupied by Nazi Germany. It focused on moral questions related to the professional ethics of Pauline, a nurse forced into Nazi collaboration. Another common use of the theme is as a prison for villains or demons. The idea is used in the first two Superman movies starring Christopher Reeve where Kryptonian villains were sentenced to the Phantom Zone from where they eventually escaped. An almost exactly parallel use of the idea is presented in the campy cult film The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension, where the \\"8th dimension\\" is essentially a \\"phantom zone\\" used to imprison the villainous Red Lectroids. Uses in horror films include the 1986 film From Beyond (based on the H. P. Lovecraft story of the same name) where a scientific experiment induces the experimenters to perceive aliens from a parallel universe, with bad results. The 1987 John Carpenter film Prince of Darkness is based on the premise that the essence of a being described as Satan, trapped in a glass canister and found in an abandoned church in Los Angeles, is actually an alien being that is the 'son' of something even more evil and powerful, trapped in another universe. The protagonists accidentally free the creature, who then attempts to release his \\"father\\" by reaching in through a mirror. Some films present parallel realities that are actually different contrasting versions of the narrative itself. Commonly this motif is presented as different points of view revolving around a central (but sometimes unknowable) \\"truth\\", the seminal example being Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon. Conversely, often in film noir and crime dramas, the alternative narrative is a fiction created by a central character, intentionally ‚Äì as in The Usual Suspects ‚Äì or unintentionally ‚Äì as in Angel Heart. Less often, the alternative narratives are given equal weight in the story, making them truly alternative universes, such as in the German film Run Lola Run, the short-lived British West End musical Our House and the British film Sliding Doors. More recent films that have explicitly explored parallel universes are: the 2000 film The Family Man, the 2001 cult film Donnie Darko, which deals with what it terms a \\"tangent universe\\" that erupts from our own universe; Super Mario Bros. (1993) has the eponymous heroes cross over into a parallel universe ruled by humanoids who evolved from dinosaurs; The One (2001) starring Jet Li, in which there is a complex system of realities in which Jet Li's character is a police officer in one universe and a serial killer in another, who travels to other universes to destroy versions of himself, so that he can take their energy; and FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (2004), the main character runs away from a totalitarian nightmare, and he enters into a cyber-afterlife alternative reality. The current Star Trek films are set in an alternative universe created by the first film's villain traveling back in time, thus allowing the franchise to be rebooted without affecting the continuity of any other Star Trek film or show. The 2011 science-fiction thriller Source Code employs the concepts of quantum reality and parallel universes. The characters in The Cloverfield Paradox, the third installment of the franchise, accidentally create a ripple in the time-space continuum and travel into an alternative universe, where the monster and the events in the first film transpired. This concept has been also been passively depicted in the view of a romantic couple in the Indian Tamil Film Irandam Ulagam. Television The idea of parallel universes have received treatment in a number of television series, usually as a single story or episode in a more general science fiction or fantasy storyline. * The 1990s TV series Sliders depicts a group of adventurers visiting assorted parallel universes, as they attempt to find their \\"home\\" universe. Included in the 1st season is a universe where the world is stuck in the ice age, with no life anywhere. Another episode includes 'Honest Abe' never to be president, in which the United States loses World War I and World War II, and they are controlled by a senator, and technology is at an all-time low. * One of the earliest television plots to feature parallel time was a 1970 storyline on the soap opera Dark Shadows. Vampire Barnabas Collins found a room in Collinwood which served as a portal to parallel time, and he entered the room in an attempt to escape from his current problems. A year later, the show again traveled to parallel time, the setting this time being 1841. * The 1990s American comedy- drama series Sweet Valley High features an episode in the first series, entitled \\"Uh Oh Seven\\". In the episode, Elizabeth Wakefield is inspired to write a spy novel after visiting the cinema with her friends and watching a James Bond movie. The spy novel stars herself and her friends. After she feels that the women don't have enough of an active role in the novel, she decides to make the females the stars of the novel, and the men as secondary to the women. In the episode she calls this a reverse universe. * A well known and often imitated example is the original Star Trek episode entitled \\"Mirror, Mirror\\". The episode introduced an alternative version of the Star Trek universe where the main characters were barbaric and cruel to the point of being evil. When the parallel universe concept is parodied, the allusion is often to this Star Trek episode. A previous episode for the Trek series first hinted at the potential of differing reality planes (and their occupants), titled \\"The Alternative Factor\\". A mad scientist from \\"our\\" universe, named Lazarus B., hunts down the sane Lazarus A.; resident of an antimatter- comprised continuum. His counterpart, in a state of paranoia, claims the double threatens his and the very cosmos' existence. With help from Captain Kirk, A traps B along with him in a \\"anti\\"-universe, for eternity, thus bringing balance to both matter-oriented realms. A similar plot was used in the Codename: Kids Next Door episode Operation: P.O.O.L.. * The mirror universe of Star Trek was further developed by later series in the franchise. In several episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, the later evolution of the mirror universe is explored. A two-part episode of Star Trek: Enterprise, entitled \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\", serves as a prequel, introducing the early developments of the Mirror Universe. * In the 1970s young adult British SF series The Tomorrow People, its second-season episode, A Rift in Time (March‚ÄìApril 1974) pitted the three telepath core characters and allies against time travelling interlopers from an alternative history where the Roman Empire developed the steam engine in the first century CE, had a technological headstart, did not fragment during the fifth century and underwent accelerated technological development. The Roman eagle standard was planted on the Moon in the fifth century and by its alternative twentieth century, it had mastered interstellar travel, had a galactic empire and time travel. Consequently, the Tomorrow People had to rectify this aberrant timeline by dismantling and disabling the anomalous steam engine. * Multiple episodes of Red Dwarf use the concept. In \\"Parallel Universe\\" the crew meet alternative versions of themselves: the analogues of Lister, Rimmer and Holly are female, while the Cat's alternative is a dog. \\"Dimension Jump\\" introduces a heroic alternative Rimmer, a version of whom reappears in \\"Stoke Me a Clipper\\". The next episode, \\"Ouroboros\\", makes contact with a timeline in which Kochanski, rather than Lister, was the sole survivor of the original disaster; this alternative Kochanski then joins the crew for the remaining episodes. * Buffy the Vampire Slayer experienced a Parallel universe where she was a mental patient in Normal Again and not really \\"The Slayer\\" at all. In the end, she has to choose between a universe where her mother and father are together and alive (mother) or one with her friends and sister in it where she has to fight for her life daily. In The Wish (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Cordelia Chase inadvertently created a dystopian alternative reality in which Buffy had never moved from LA to Sunnydale. Her core-universe allies Xander Harris and Willow Rosenberg had become vampires in that timeline. * The plot of the season four episode of Charmed, entitled \\"Brain Drain\\", features The Source of All Evil kidnapping Piper Halliwell and forcing her into a deep coma, where she experiences an alternative reality in which the Halliwell manor is actually a mental institution. She and her sisters serve as patients in this universe, their powers only a manifestation of their minds, a ruse put up to trick Piper into willingly relinquishing the sisters' magic. * The animated series, Futurama, had an episode where the characters travel between \\"Universe 1\\" and \\"Universe A\\" via boxes containing each universe; and one of the major jokes is an extended argument between the two sets of characters over which set were the \\"evil\\" ones. * The idea of a parallel universe and the concept of d√©j√† vu was a major plot line of the first-season finale of Fringe, guest-starring Leonard Nimoy of Star Trek. The show has gone on to feature the parallel universe prominently. * In the 2010 season of Lost, the result of characters traveling back in time to prevent the crash of Oceanic Flight 815 apparently creates a parallel reality in which the Flight never crashed, rather than resetting time itself in the characters' original timeline. The show continued to show two \\"sets\\" of the characters following different destinies, until it was revealed in the series finale that there was really only one reality created by the characters themselves to assist themselves in leaving behind the physical world and passing on to an afterlife after their respective deaths. * In the anime and manga series of Dragon Ball Z, in the Androids Saga, Future Trunks returns to the past to give Goku medicine to prevent him from dying of a heart disease and warns him of the Androids, in the process creating a timeline split of parallel realities. This event leads to the appearance of Cell, who killed the same Future Trunks after he returned from the past in a separate split timeline to come back to the main timeline when the Androids are still alive for him to absorb. ** Its sequel, Dragon Ball Super, later features separate universes that are in pairs whose numbers add up to the total number of the universe: 12 in this case. Previously there were 18 universes, but Zeno (the supreme ruler of the Dragon Ball Multiverse) destroyed 6 of them in a fit of rage. Previously, Daizenshuu 7 stated that the typical Dragon Ball Universe had only 4 galaxies, but Dragon Ball Super effectively retcons this, where Whis says that the universe contains endless galaxies. * The anime Turn A Gundam attempted to combine all the parallel Gundam universes (other incarnations of the series, with similar themes but differing stories and characters, that had played out at different times since the debut of the concept in the 1970s) of the metaseries into one single reality. * The anime and manga series Eureka Seven: AO takes place in a parallel universe that is different from the one in the series' predecessor Eureka Seven. The E7 series started off in the year 12005, and the AO world, which takes place in the year 2025, would be the home of the two main characters' son. * The anime and manga series Katekyo Hitman Reborn! by Akira Amano features this idea in its third main arc, known as Future arc. * The anime Neon Genesis Evangelion features a parallel world in one of the final episodes. This parallel world is a sharp contrast to the harsh, dark \\"reality\\" of the show and presents a world where all the characters enjoy a much happier life. This parallel world would become the basis for the new Evangelion manga series Angelic Days. * The anime series Bakugan features a parallel universe called Vestroia and is the homeworld of fantastic creatures called Bakugan. The series' hero Dan Kuso alongside his friends and teammates must save Earth and Vestroia from total destruction. Season 2 & 3 feature another universe where Dan and his team save the day. They go to another dimension or universe through a pathway. The other universe has also other life forms and other types of technology. * In another anime series, Digimon, there is a parallel universe called \\"digital world\\". The show's child protagonists meet digital monsters, or digimon, from this world and become partners and friends. In the third story arc of Digimon Fusion, the Clockmaker (who is later revealed to be Bagramon) and his partner Clockmon travel through space-time to recruit heroes from previous series so they can help the Fusion Fighters to defeat Quartzmon before DigiQuartz can absorb each human and digital world in the multiverse. * In the anime series Umineko no Naku Koro ni the rounds of the battle between Battler and Beatrice take place in different dimensions, in order to show all kinds of possibilities (much to Battler's dismay) also the character Bernkastel is known for her ability to travel into different worlds by the usage of \\"fragments\\". * In the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Parallels\\", Lt. Worf traveled to several parallel universes when his shuttlecraft went through a time space fissure. * The Community episode Remedial Chaos Theory, six different timelines and one \\"prime\\" timeline are explored, each having a different outcome based on which member of the study group goes to get the pizza. One timeline, dubbed the \\"Darkest Timeline\\", results in the greatest amount of terrible incidents and ends with Abed donning a felt goatee bearing resemblance to Spock's in \\"Mirror, Mirror\\". * In the 2003 anime series of Fullmetal Alchemist, there exists a gateway that can be conjured by alchemists that acts as a source of all knowledge and energy; towards the end of the series, it is revealed that this gateway connects the world of the anime with the real world, set during the first decades of the 20th century. It is revealed that the two worlds shared a common history until their histories diverged, apparently due to the success of alchemy in one world and that of modern physics in the other. =As an ongoing subplot= Sometimes a television series will use parallel universes as an ongoing subplot. Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Enterprise and Star Trek: Discovery elaborated on the premise of the original series' \\"Mirror\\" universe and developed multi-episode story arcs based on the premise. Other examples are the science fiction series Stargate SG-1, the fantasy/horror series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Supernatural and the romance/fantasy Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. Following the precedent set by Star Trek, these story arcs show alternative universes that have turned out \\"worse\\" than the \\"original\\" universe: in Stargate SG-1 the first two encountered parallel realities featured Earth being overwhelmed by an unstoppable Goa'uld onslaught; in Buffy, two episodes concern a timeline in which Buffy came to Sunnydale too late to stop the vampires from taking control; Lois & Clark repeatedly visits an alternative universe where Clark Kent's adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent, died when he was ten years of age, and Lois Lane is also apparently dead. Clark eventually becomes Superman, with help from the \\"original\\" Lois Lane, but he is immediately revealed as Clark Kent and so has no life of his own. In addition to following Star Trek's lead, showing the \\"evil\\" variants of the main storyline gives the writers an opportunity to show what is at stake by portraying the worst that could happen and the consequences if the protagonists fail or the importance of a character's presence. Once Upon a Time often talks about alternative realms or universes in which all different forms of magic, and non-magic may occur, depending on the realm. According to the Mad Hatter (Sebastian Stan), they \\"touch each other in a long line of lands, each just as real as the last\\". He referred to our world's tendency to deny such things as arrogant. In the season 1 finale of The Flash, the Reverse-Flash opens a singularity that connects his world to a parallel universe called Earth-2. In the second season, The Flash starts facing villains from that earth who also have doppelgangers on Prime Earth sent by Zoom. The array of Earth-2 villains consists of Atom Smasher, Sand Demon, King Shark, and Dr. Light; all are sent by Zoom to kill The Flash with the assurance of being taken back home. However, they are not the only ones who arrive from the singularity; this also includes the Earth-2 Flash after a close death and loss of speed from a confrontation with Zoom. When the Earth-2 Flash (called Jay Garrick) introduces himself to Team Flash, Barry (The Flash) distrusts him at first and places him in the metahuman pipeline at S.T.A.R. Labs. When The Flash starts having a hard time facing off against Sand Demon, he frees Jay so that he could help him as well as train him in his speed. With a new trick taught by Jay, Barry defeats Sand Demon. Later on, the Earth-2 counterpart of the Reverse-Flash, Harrison Wells, arrives in Prime Earth as well. He steals a weapon from Mercury Labs and saves Barry from the Earth-2 King Shark. When Jay confronts and sees Wells again, the argument gets heated between them before Barry intercedes. The \\"Alf Stewart Rape Dungeon\\" series, created by artist Mr Doodleburger, uses footage from the Australian TV drama show Home and Away, but through the use of clever overlaid audio tracks, casts one of the main characters of the show, long running character Alf Stewart as a vicious violent character in a parallel version of Home and Away. see main article Alf Stewart Rape Dungeon Series =Television series involving parallel universes= There have been a few series where parallel universes were central to the series itself. * The Fantastic Journey, in which several travellers lost in the Bermuda Triangle find themselves in another world * Otherworld, in which a family gets trapped in an alternative world * Sliders, where a young man invents a worm-hole generator that allows travel to \\"alternative\\" Earths. Several characters travel across a series of \\"alternative\\" Earths, trying to get back to their home universe * Parallax, in which a boy discovers portals to multiple parallel universes in his home town * Charlie Jade, in which the titular character is accidentally thrown into our universe and is looking for a way back to his own. The series features three universes - alpha, beta and gamma * Awake, where a man switches between realities whenever he goes to sleep: one in which his wife survived a car accident that killed their son, and one in which his son survived but his wife died * In the TV series Fringe, a main element of the series is the loss of balance and the eventual collision of two universes and the moral ramifications of it. Most main characters have a doppelganger who is usually slightly different from their prime selves. * In the South Korean Drama Dr. Jin (2012), the concept of parallel universes was used. A doctor travels into the past, specifically, the Joseon era, and this results in major changes in history. * Rick and Morty, in which there is an infinite number of realities and universes. * Stranger Things, in which a small town becomes home to a gateway between dimensions. * The Flash, in which Barry Allen travels to multiple parallel universes in the multiverse with the help of his super speed. * Supernatural, in which several episodes deal with parallel universes, particularly the thirteenth season which features storylines centering around parallel universes known as Apocalypse World and The Bad Place which appears in the backdoor pilot to the proposed spinoff Supernatural: Wayward Sisters. Apocalypse World is depicted as a dark post-apocalyptic universe where Supernatural's main protagonists Sam and Dean Winchester were never born and thus could not stop the end of the world. * Doctor Who, in which a crack between two parallel universes opens up during the Rose Tyler plot. In which her Father still lives, however, the Cybermen control the parallel earth and pass through to ours. * The Man in the High Castle, where in a parallel universe Nazis have won World War II, based on the novel by Philip K. Dick. * The King: Eternal Monarch, in which the country of Korea is unified as a single kingdom in a parallel reality to the Koreas being separated. The two lead characters travel between their respective realities, one from the Republic of South Korea, the other being the aforementioned king. * Dark, where (previous) existance of original world was revealed only in last (3rd) season. Original world there was destroyed/splitted in two parallel ones by a genius scientist in pain, because his son's family was lost in an accident and he desperately wanted them back alive. Each of two worlds has their own protagonists group (Sic Mundus Creatus Est vs Erit Lux) fighting for a supremacy of time travel, available in 3 flavours: via a local cave, swirling blob of God particles and portable drones. * The OA, in which characters discover parallel universes and attempt to travel to them.  Books  Time Echoes Trilogy by Bryan Davis addresses the idea of parallel worlds as it delves into a plot in which the main character travels between three different \\"earth's\\" each moving at a different speed of time so one earth is 20 years in the past while another one is 10 minutes into the future when compared to the earth from which the character exists. Comic books Parallel universes in modern comics have become particularly rich and complex, in large part due to the continual problem of continuity faced by the major two publishers, Marvel Comics and DC Comics. The two publishers have used the multiverse concept to fix problems arising from integrating characters from other publishers into their own canon, and from having major serial protagonists having continuous histories lasting, as in the case of Superman, over 70 years. Additionally, both publishers have used new alternative universes to re-imagine their own characters. (See Multiverse (DC Comics) and Multiverse (Marvel Comics)) DC's Michael Moorcock's Multiverse collected 12 issues in 1999 with an introduction by Moorcock which offered a sophisticated description of his rationale. DC Comics inaugurated its multiverse in the early 1960s, with the reintroduction of Golden Age superheroes the Justice Society of America now located on Earth- Two, and devised a \\"mirror universe\\" scenario of inverted morality and supervillain domination of Earth-Three shortly afterwards, several years before Star Trek devised its own darker alternative universe. There was a lull before DC inaugurated additional alternative universes in the seventies, such as Earth-X, where there was an Axis victory in World War II, Earth-S, home to the Fawcett Comics superheroes of the forties and fifties, such as Captain Marvel, and Earth-Prime, where superheroes only existed in fictional forms. Therefore, comic books, in general, are one of the few entertainment mediums where the concept of parallel universes are a major and ongoing theme. DC in particular periodically revisits the idea in major crossover storylines, such as Crisis on Infinite Earths and Infinite Crisis, where Marvel has a series called What If... that's devoted to exploring alternative realities, which sometimes impact the \\"main\\" universe's continuity. DC's version of \\"What If...\\" is the Elseworlds imprint. DC Comics series 52 heralded the return of the Multiverse. 52 was a mega-crossover event tied to Infinite Crisis which was the sequel to the 1980s Crisis on Infinite Earths. The aim was to yet again address many of the problems and confusions brought on by the Multiverse in the DCU. Now 52 Earths exist and including some Elseworld tales such as Kingdom Come, DC's imprint WildStorm and an Earth devoted to the Charlton Comics heroes of DC. Countdown and Countdown Presents: The Search for Ray Palmer and the Tales of the Multiverse stories expand upon this new Multiverse. Marvel has also had many large crossover events which depicted an alternative universe, many springing from events in the X-Men books, such as 1981's Days of Future Past, 1995's Age of Apocalypse, and 2006's House of M. In addition, the Squadron Supreme is a DC inspired Marvel Universe that has been used several times, often crossing over into the mainstream Universe in the Avengers comic. Exiles is an offshoot of the X-Men franchise that allows characters to hop from one alternative reality to another, leaving the original, main Marvel Universe intact. The Marvel UK line has long had multiverse stories including the Jaspers' Warp storyline of Captain Britain's first series (it was here that the designation Earth-616 was first applied to the mainstream Marvel Universe). Marvel Comics, as of 2000, launched their most popular parallel universe, the Ultimate Universe. It is a smaller subline to the mainstream titles and features Ultimate Spider-Man, Ultimate X-Men, Ultimate Fantastic Four and the Ultimates (their \\"Avengers\\"). The graphic novel Watchmen is set in an alternative history, in 1985 where superheroes exist, the Vietnam War was won by the United States, and Richard Nixon is in his fifth term as President of the United States. The Soviet Union and the United States are still locked in an escalating \\"Cold War\\" as in our own world, but as the Soviet Union invades Afghanistan in this world and threatens Pakistan, nuclear war may be imminent. In 1973, Tammy published The Clock and Cluny Jones, where a mysterious grandfather clock hurls bully Cluny Jones into a harsh alternative reality where she becomes the bullied. This story was reprinted in Misty annual 1985 as Grandfather's Clock. In 1978, Misty published The Sentinels. The Sentinels were two crumbling apartment blocks that connected the mainstream world with an alternative reality where Hitler conquered Britain in 1940. In 1981, Jinty published Worlds Apart. Six girls experience alternative worlds ruled by greed, sports-mania, vanity, crime, intellectualism, and fear. These are in fact their dream worlds becoming real after they are knocked out by a mysterious gas from a chemical tanker that crashed into their school. In 1977 Jinty also published Land of No Tears where a lame girl travels to a future world where people with things wrong with them are cruelly treated, and emotions are banned. The parallel universe concept has also appeared prominently in the Sonic the Hedgehog comic series from Archie Comics. The first and most oft-recurring case of this is another \\"mirror universe\\" where Sonic and his various allies are evil or anti-heroic while the counterpart of the evil Dr. Robotnik is good. Another recurring universe featured in the series is a perpendicular dimension that runs through all others, known as the No Zone. The inhabitants of this universe monitor travel between the others, often stepping in with their Zone Cop police force to punish those who travel without authorization between worlds. In more recent years, the comic has adapted the alternative dimension from the video games Sonic Rush and Sonic Rush Adventure, home to Sonic's ally Blaze the Cat. The continuities seen in various other Sonic franchises also exist in the comic, most notably those based on the cartoon series Sonic Underground and Sonic X. For some years, a number of other universes were also featured that parodied various popular franchises, such as Sailor Moon, Godzilla, and various titles from Marvel Comics. Archie has also used this concept as the basis for crossovers between Sonic and other titles that they publish, including Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Mega Man. The various Transformers comics also feature the parallel universe concept, and feature the various continuities from different branches of the franchise as parallel worlds that occasionally make contact with each other. Quite notably, the annual Botcon fan convention introduced a comic storyline that featured Cliffjumper, an Autobot from the original Transformers series, entering an alternative universe where his fellow Autobots are evil and the Decepticons are good. This universe is known as the \\"Shattered Glass\\" universe, and continued on in comics and text based stories after its initial release. Video games * In the adventure game 9: The Last Resort (1996), after resolving several mind- blowing and unique puzzles, the player gets past \\"The Tiki Guards\\"; and a door opens up to \\"The Void\\" - actually a room to another universe, which houses the entirety of space. * Banjo-Kazooie (1998) features a world called \\"Click Clock Wood\\", which has spring, summer, autumn and winter variants. The environment develops between the seasons making some areas accessible or inaccessible, and actions taken in one season affect the outcome in others. * The first-person shooter BioShock Infinite (2013) features the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. The main character is named Booker Dewitt, an homage to physicist Bryce DeWitt. * The story of Chrono Cross (1999) centers around travel between two alternative timelines, the original or \\"Another World\\" and \\"Home World\\" which is a branch created by the actions of the heroes of the game's predecessor, Chrono Trigger. *City of Heroes (2004), a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, features a Player vs Player (PvP) zone called Recluse's Victory. It is an alternative future in a constant state of flux, as heroes and villains battle for the future of Earth. * Crash Twinsanity (2004) features Crash, Cortex, and Nina traveling to the \\"10th dimension\\", which could also be a parallel universe (suggested by the theme and how everything seems to be opposite). * In the psychological horror point- and-click adventure game Dark Seed (1992), the main character Mike Dawson discovers a parallel universe by going through his living room mirror. * The Darkness (2007) pivots around a world of darkness you travel to when you die, which is occupied by World War 1 soldiers. * EarthBound (1994) features many areas of the game that can be considered alternative dimensions. The first is an illusion created by the Mani Mani Statue that transforms the metropolis of Fourside into a bizarre neon metropolis called Moonside, filled with unusual characters and enemies. The second is Magicant, the world of Ness's subconscious that is accessed after obtaining the Eight Melodies. Finally, toward the end of the game, the protagonists arrive at the Cave to the Past, where they travel back in time to the haunting past dimension of the cave to face Giygas. * The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (2006) features an alternative hellish world called \\"Oblivion\\", as well as a painting you can climb into and a quest where you enter a dream world. *Fallout series (1997‚Äì ) takes place in a subtly different universe. For example, the ship that landed the first men on the moon in 1969 is called Valiant 11, rather than Apollo 11. This universe diverged from ours after World War II, which resulted in a lack of advanced computers, the Cold War, VHS, etc. * In Freedom Force (2002), most of the story is set in Patriot City, but a number of other locations and time periods are used, including magical realms, prehistoric times, and realms entirely removed from time and space. *Half-Life series (1998‚Äì ) revolves heavily around alternative universes. Xen is a location in the first Half-Life game, accidentally discovered by scientists and described as a border world between dimensions, where the player must travel to stop an alien invasion. Half-Life 2 features a multidimensional empire called The Combine which has successfully conquered Earth and subdued humanity, among countless other universes and species. *Heroes of the Storm (2015) takes place in the Nexus, a strange limbo of clashing universes, which collide from across space, time, and dimensions. The Nexus exists in the center of a trans-dimensional cosmic storm, which can rip worlds and universes in and out of existence, and it can also pull worlds into stability. Some of the central realms in the Nexus are examples of these points of stability. Every Realm within the Nexus has one stone called \\"Singularity\\", and only the one who achieves it through conquest can become the Realm Lord. Many powerful warriors have been sucked into the Nexus, including combatants from Warcraft, StarCraft, Diablo, and Overwatch universes. New combatants are constantly arriving, some of them are chosen after they died in their original reality. *Kingdom Hearts series (2002‚Äì ) features a Disney/Square Enix's Final Fantasy multiverse, in which various worlds are based on Disney films or concepts from the Final Fantasy line. The series also introduces the concept of different \\"Realms\\" corresponding to Light, Darkness, and In-Between where all of the worlds take place. * The series Legacy of Kain (1996‚Äì ) is played through several realms and timelines. * The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (1991) features a dark and twisted parallel version of Hyrule called the \\"Dark World\\". In the Ocarina of Time (1998) after the main protagonist, Link, defeats the dark lord, Ganon, he travels back in time to his childhood. This results in two alternative histories for Hyrule. In one a younger version Link travels to the land of Termina in Majora's Mask (2000). In the other Link is no longer present allowing Ganon to return to go on a rampage that forced the gods of Hyrule to flood the world in The Wind Waker (2002). There is also a scenario in which Link is killed by Ganon in the final battle, resulting in an alternative history in which Hyrule is put in an era of decline, leading to the events of A Link to the Past. The Majora's Mask takes place in Termina, a parallel world to Hyrule. Almost all of the characters from Ocarina of Time reappear in the game. The Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages (2001) use a similar concept to that which is used in A Link to the Past. In those games, the player must switch between the parallel past and present worlds (Ages) and between spring, summer, autumn and winter (Seasons) to progress through the game. In the first half of Twilight Princess (2006), areas of Hyrule are veiled by the Twilight Realm. These areas are dusky and brooding in appearance, Link cannot transform out of wolf form, characters only appear as spirits that cannot be communicated with, and enemies are twilight variations of their regular forms. Otherwise, the Twilight Realm is identical to regular Hyrule. * The world of the classic cult adventure games of The Longest Journey (1999) created by Ragnar Thornqast, along with its sequels, deals with the existence of two parallel universes ‚Äì technological (Stark) and magical (Arcadia). * Metroid Prime 2: Echoes (2004) involves a world, \\"Aether\\", having an alternative self in the, \\"Dark\\" realm, universe, or dimension. The protagonist, Samus, finds out that she just dropped into a hopeless war for the Luminoth, the dominant species of Light Aether against the Ing, the dominant species of Dark Aether. She also finds her counterpart, Dark Samus or Metroid Prime's essence inside Samus's Phazon Suit. * Minecraft (2011) features an alternative dimension called \\"The Nether\\", that includes a 'hell' like theme. It also contains a second alternative dimension called \\"The End\\", home world of the Endermen, a type of monster that spawns rarely in the main world. * In the adventure PC game Myst (1993), the unnamed protagonist travels to multiple alternative worlds through the use of special books, which describe a world within and transport the user to that world when a window on the front page is touched. * In OtherSpace (1998), a text-based science fiction MMORPG, refugees from Earth's universe were forced to migrate to a parallel universe called \\"Hiverspace\\", whose quantum divergence occurred billions of years in the past, after damage to the time/space continuum began to tear their own universe apart. Eventually, they were able to find a means back to a past universe whose quantum divergence from their original ones was relatively minor. * In the role-playing game Outcast (1999), a probe is sent to a parallel universe and is attacked by an \\"entity\\". Cutter Slade must escort a team of scientists across to the other world in order to retrieve and repair the damaged probe before the earth is consumed by a black hole. * Persona 2: Eternal Punishment (2000) takes place in an alternative universe called \\"This Side\\" where in the events of Innocent Sin did not take place and the characters have never met in the past. *Portal 2 (2011), an action-adventure video game, features a game- mode entitled \\"Perpetual Testing Initiative\\" (PeTI), where a plot item features protagonist \\"Bendy\\" through thousands of different worlds of which character Cave Johnson exist in different roles entitled \\"The Multiverse\\", and the PeTI's parallel universes are different from the main Half-Life/Portal timeline. * Resistance: Fall of Man (2006) is set in alternative universe where Tsarist Russia never experienced the Russian Revolution but instead became the bridgehead for an aggressive alien invasion from a species known as the \\"Chimera\\", who then proceed to overrun Western Europe, Great Britain, Canada and much of the United States, and where there has been no Second World War as a result. The events of the game and its sequels begin in its alternative 1951. * In the survival horror video game series Silent Hill (1999‚Äì ), the town of Silent Hill fluctuates between the real world, where Silent Hill is seemingly just an ordinary tourist town, the Fog World, which is like the real world, except the town is shrouded in thick fog and is nearly uninhabited except for monsters and a few people, and a dark and dilapidated version of the town called the \\"Other World\\". * Each Zone in Sonic CD (1993) has four variations: Past, Present, Bad Future and Good Future, each displaying some subtle and not-so subtle alterations. The series has also seen alternative dimensions, and parallel universes in the case of the Sonic Rush (2005), in which Sonic encounters a hero from another world named Blaze the Cat whose nemesis is an alternative counterpart of his own foe, Dr. Eggman. The Sonic series of Sonic The Hedgehog 2006, Generations And Rivals also makes use of the concept of Wormholes, and alternative timelines. * Sudeki (2004) is set in a realm of light and a parallel realm of darkness. * Super Mario 64 (1996) features a world called \\"Tiny Huge Island\\" which has two variants: one scaled up, the other scaled down. The player can only access certain parts of the level to obtain certain stars depending on which variant they are into. The two variants can be switched between via portals in the world. * Super Mario Bros. 2 (1988) features a \\"Magic Potion\\" item that when used, creates a doorway allowing the player to temporarily access \\"Subspace\\"; a mirrored silhouette version of the world where items can be found. * After the completion of the Special World in Super Mario World (1990), the overworld transforms from a green-colored springtime to an orange-colored autumnal setting. Many enemies encountered in the game are transformed into bizarre counterparts. * In Super Paper Mario (2007), the town \\"Flipside\\" (which acts as the game's central hub) has an alternative mirrored version called \\"Flopside\\". While Flipside appears pristine and the residents there are typically cheerful, Flopside appears somewhat dilapidated and is populated by surly characters. * Both titles of the When They Cry visual novel series (Higurashi and Umineko for short) contain the concept of parallel worlds. These series both involve some kind of murder mystery. As soon as the main character has 'lost', another parallel world, called a Fragment, is chosen to be observed. This continues until the entire mystery is solved. * The visual novel/puzzle video game Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward (2012) heavily uses the concept of multiple realities as the basis for its plot as well as its central gameplay mechanic of traversing through realities and altering history.

The band were pioneers in the American punk and then the new wave scene of the mid-1970s in New York. Their first two albums contained strong elements of these genres, and although highly successful in the United Kingdom and Australia, Blondie was regarded as an underground band in the United States until the release of Parallel Lines in 1978. Over the next three years, the band achieved several hit singles\\"Blondie\\". Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 2006. including \\"Heart of Glass\\", \\"Call Me\\", \\"Rapture\\" and \\"The Tide Is High\\". The band became noted for its eclectic mix of musical styles incorporating elements of disco, pop, reggae, and early rap music. Blondie disbanded after the release of its sixth studio album, The Hunter, in 1982. Debbie Harry continued to pursue a solo career with varied results after taking a few years off to care for partner Chris Stein, who was diagnosed with pemphigus, a rare autoimmune disease of the skin. The band re-formed in 1997, achieving renewed success and a number one single in the United Kingdom with \\"Maria\\" in 1999, exactly 20 years after their first UK No. 1 single (\\"Heart of Glass\\"). The group toured and performed throughout the world during the following years, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006.Blondie.net ‚Äì Official site. Retrieved September 7, 2006. Blondie has sold around 40 million records worldwide and is still active. The band's eleventh studio album, Pollinator, was released on May 5, 2017. History =1974‚Äì1978: Early career= Inspired by the burgeoning new music scene at the Mercer Arts Center in Manhattan, Chris Stein sought to join a similar band. He joined the Stilettoes in 1973 as their guitarist and formed a romantic relationship with one of the band's vocalists, Debbie Harry, a former waitress and Playboy Bunny. Harry had been a member of a folk-rock band, The Wind in the Willows, in the late 1960s. In July 1974, Stein and Harry parted ways with the Stilettoes and Elda Gentile, the band's originator, forming a new band with ex-Stilettoes bandmates Billy O'Connor (drums; born October 4, 1953, Germany, died March 29, 2015, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) and Fred Smith (bass). Originally billed as Angel and the Snake for two shows in August 1974, they renamed themselves Blondie by October 1974. The name derived from comments made by truck drivers who catcalled \\"Hey, Blondie\\" to Harry as they drove past. eNotes.com. 2006. September 12, 2010 By the spring of 1975, after some personnel turnover (including Ivan Kral on guitar and sisters Tish Bellomo and Snooky Bellomo on backing vocals), Stein and Harry were joined by drummer Clem Burke and bass player Gary Lachman. Blondie became regular performers at Max's Kansas City and CBGB. In June 1975, the band's first recording came in the way of a demo produced by Alan Betrock. To fill out their sound, they recruited keyboard player Jimmy Destri in November 1975. The band signed with Private Stock Records and their debut album, Blondie, was issued in December 1976 but was initially not a commercial success. In September 1977, the band bought back its contract with Private Stock and signed with British label Chrysalis Records.\\"Talent Talk\\" Billboard October 22, 1977: 54 The first album was re-released on the new label in October 1977. Rolling Stone's review of the debut album observed the eclectic nature of the group's music, comparing it to Phil Spector and the Who, and commented that the album's two strengths were Richard Gottehrer's production and the persona of Debbie Harry. The publication said she performed with \\"utter aplomb and involvement throughout: even when she's portraying a character consummately obnoxious and spaced-out, there is a wink of awareness that is comforting and amusing yet never condescending.\\" It also noted that Harry was the \\"possessor of a bombshell zombie's voice that can sound dreamily seductive and woodenly Mansonite within the same song\\". Debbie Harry performing with Blondie in Toronto, 1977 The band's first commercial success occurred in Australia in 1977, when the music television program Countdown mistakenly played their video \\"In the Flesh\\", which was the B-side of their then current single \\"X-Offender\\". Jimmy Destri later credited the show's Molly Meldrum for their initial success, commenting that \\"we still thank him to this day\\" for playing the wrong song. In a 1998 interview, drummer Clem Burke recalled seeing the episode in which the wrong song was played, but he and Chris Stein suggested that it may have been a deliberate subterfuge on the part of Meldrum. Stein asserted that \\"X-Offender\\" was \\"too crazy and aggressive [to become a hit]\\", while \\"In the Flesh\\" was \\"not representative of any punk sensibility. Over the years, I've thought they probably played both things but liked one better. That's all.\\" In retrospect, Burke described \\"In the Flesh\\" as \\"a forerunner to the power ballad\\". The single reached number 2 in Australia, while the album reached the Australian top twenty in November 1977, and a subsequent double-A release of \\"X-Offender\\" and \\"Rip Her to Shreds\\" reached number 81. A successful Australian tour followed in December, though it was marred by an incident in Brisbane when disappointed fans almost rioted after Harry cancelled a performance due to illness. In February 1978, Blondie released their second album, Plastic Letters (UK No. 10, US No. 78, Australia No. 64). The album was recorded as a four-piece as Gary Valentine had left the band in mid 1977. Valentine describes his July 4, 1977 departure from the band. Plastic Letters was promoted extensively throughout Europe and Asia by Chrysalis Records. The album's first single, \\"Denis\\", was a cover version of the Randy and the Rainbows' 1963 hit \\"Denise\\". It reached number two on the British singles charts, while both the album and its second single, \\"(I'm Always Touched by Your) Presence, Dear\\", reached the British top ten. Chart success, along with a successful 1978 UK tour, including a gig at London's Roundhouse, made Blondie one of the first American new wave bands to achieve mainstream success in the United Kingdom. By this time, Gary Valentine had left and been replaced by Frank Infante (guitar, bass guitar). With this lineup in place for a short time, British musician Nigel Harrison was hired as the group's full-time bassist, expanding Blondie to a six-piece for the first time in its history and thus allowing Infante to switch to guitar. The band's line-up had stabilized. =1978‚Äì1981: Mainstream success= Clem Burke Blondie's third album, Parallel Lines (UK No. 1, US No. 6, Australia No. 2), was released in September 1978. Produced by Mike Chapman, it finally broke the band into the American market on the strength of the worldwide hit single \\"Heart of Glass\\". Parallel Lines became the group's most successful album, selling 20 million copies worldwide. The album's first two singles were \\"Picture This\\" (UK No. 12) and \\"Hanging on the Telephone\\" (UK No. 5). Because the biggest hit from Blondie's previous album Plastic Letters was \\"Denis\\", a cover of Randy & The Rainbows' 1963 song \\"Denise\\", Chrysalis Records chose Buddy Holly's \\"I'm Gonna Love You Too\\" as the lead single from Parallel Lines in the United States. This turned out to be a miscalculation as the single failed to chart. The song was eventually released as a single in a few other countries in 1979. \\"Heart of Glass\\" was released in early 1979 and the disco- infused track topped the UK charts in February 1979 and the US charts in April 1979. It was a reworking of a rock and reggae-influenced song that the group had performed since its formation in the mid 1970s, updated with strong elements of disco music. Clem Burke later said the revamped version was inspired partly by Kraftwerk and partly by the Bee Gees' \\"Stayin' Alive\\", whose drum beat Burke tried to emulate. He and Stein gave Jimmy Destri much of the credit for the final result, noting that Destri's appreciation of technology had led him to introduce synthesizers and to rework the keyboard sections. Although some critics condemned Blondie for \\"selling out\\" by dabbling in disco, the song became a monumental worldwide success and became one of the biggest selling singles of 1979. The song was accompanied by a music video filmed at a club in New York City (incorrectly surmised as being Studio 54 due to a shot of its exterior at the start of the video). The music video showcased Harry's hard-edged and playfully sexual character, as well as her famously stiff, marginally disinterested persona. She began to attain a celebrity status that set her apart from the other band members, who were largely ignored by the media. Blondie's next single in the US was a more aggressive rock song, \\"One Way or Another\\" (US No. 24), though in the UK, an alternate single choice, \\"Sunday Girl\\", became a No. 1 hit. Parallel Lines is ranked No. 140 on Rolling Stone's list of 500 greatest albums of all time. In June 1979, Blondie, photographed by Annie Leibovitz, was featured on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. Blondie's fourth album, Eat to the Beat (UK No. 1, US No. 17, Australia No. 9), was released in September 1979. Though well received by critics as a suitable follow-up to Parallel Lines, the album and its singles failed to achieve the same level of success in the US. In the UK, the album delivered three top 20 hits, including the band's third UK number one (\\"Atomic\\", UK No. 1, US No. 39). The lead track off the album, \\"Dreaming\\", narrowly missed the top spot in the UK, but only made it to number 27 in the US. \\"Union City Blue\\" (UK No. 13) was not released in the US in favor of the track \\"The Hardest Part\\". In a daring move, Chrysalis Records' Linda Carhart asked Jon Roseman Productions US division to shoot videos for every song and make it the first ever video album. David Mallet directed and Paul Flattery produced it at various locations and studios in and around New York. Blondie's next single, the Grammy-nominated \\"Call Me\\", was the result of Debbie Harry's collaboration with the Italian songwriter and producer Giorgio Moroder, who had been responsible for Donna Summer's biggest hits. The track was recorded as the title theme of the Richard Gere film American Gigolo. Released in February 1980 in the US, \\"Call Me\\" spent six consecutive weeks at No. 1 in the US and Canada, reached No. 1 in the U.K. (where it was released in April 1980) and became a hit throughout the world. The single was also No. 1 on Billboard magazine's 1980 year-end chart. In the summer of 1980, the band appeared in a bit part in the film Roadie starring Meat Loaf. Blondie performed the Johnny Cash song \\"Ring of Fire\\". The live recording was featured on the film soundtrack, and on a later CD reissue of the Eat to the Beat album. In November 1980, Blondie's fifth studio album, Autoamerican (UK No. 3, US No. 7, Australia No. 8) was released; it contained two more No. 1 US hits: the reggae-styled \\"The Tide Is High\\", a cover version of a 1967 song written by John Holt of the Paragons, and the rap-flavored \\"Rapture\\", which was the first song featuring rapping to reach number one in the US. In the song Harry mentions the hip hop and graffiti artist Fab Five Freddy who also appears in the video for the song. Autoamerican featured a far wider stylistic range than previous Blondie albums, including the avant-garde instrumental \\"Europa\\", the acoustic jazz of \\"Faces\\", and \\"Follow Me\\" (from the Broadway show \\"Camelot\\"). The album went on to achieve platinum success in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Debbie Harry and Chris Stein =1981‚Äì1982: Hiatus, The Hunter, and breakup= Following their success of 1978‚Äì80, Blondie took a brief break in 1981. That year, Debbie Harry and Jimmy Destri both released solo albums; Stein worked on Harry's album KooKoo (UK No. 6, US No. 28) and Burke with Destri's Heart on a Wall. The back cover credits of Jimmy Destri's 1981 LP lists \\"Drums: Clem Burke\\". Burke went to Europe to play drums on Eurythmics' debut album In The Garden. Harry, Stein and Destri also worked together on music for the 1981 John Waters film Polyester. Frank Infante sued the band regarding a lack of involvement during the Autoamerican sessions; it was settled out of court, and Infante remained in the band (though Harry has subsequently said Infante was not on the next LP, despite appearing on the front cover). Around this time Harry also was cultivating an acting career that included a high-profile appearance in 1980's Roadie and later David Cronenberg's Videodrome in 1983. In October 1981, Chrysalis Records released The Best of Blondie (UK No. 4, US No. 30, Australia No. 1), the group's first greatest hits compilation. The band reconvened in late 1981 to record a new album, The Hunter, released in May 1982 (UK No. 9, US No. 33, Australia No. 15). In contrast to their earlier commercial and critical successes, The Hunter was poorly received. The album did have two moderate hit singles: \\"Island of Lost Souls\\" (UK# 11, US No. 37, Australia No. 13) and \\"War Child\\" (UK No. 39). The album also included \\"For Your Eyes Only\\", a track the band had been commissioned to write and record for the 1981 James Bond film of the same name, but was rejected by the film's producers (the producers ultimately chose another song with that title that would be recorded by Sheena Easton). In June 1982 Harry contributed backing vocals to The Gun Club's second album Miami, being credited as 'D.H. Lawrence Jr' while Chris Stein also produced the record, and is credited as 'bongos' and 'cover photos/design'. The Gun Club's singer Jeffrey Lee Pierce was a super-fan, emulating Harry's hairstyle and founding the West Coast Blondie Fan Club, before becoming friends with the band in New York. For the brief North American tour (July‚ÄìAugust 1982) to promote the Hunter album, guitarist Frank Infante was replaced with session musician Eddie Martinez.End credits of Blondie Live it Toronto video Also added to the live lineup were second keyboardist Abel Domingues, and a three- man horn section (Douglas Harris, Joseph Kohanski, and Arthur Pugh.) The concert tour was not particularly successful, with shows typically playing to less-than-capacity crowds. With tensions within the band on the rise due to the act's commercial decline and the attendant financial pressures that brought, as well as the constant press focus on Harry to the exclusion of the other band members, events reached a breaking point when Stein was diagnosed with the life-threatening illness pemphigus. As a result of Stein's illness, coupled with drug use by members of the band, financial mismanagement, and slow concert ticket sales, Blondie canceled their European tour plans early in August 1982. Shortly thereafter, the band broke up, with at least one (unspecified) member quitting and instigating lawsuits against the other group members. The band's breakup was announced publicly in November 1982.Goddard, Peter (November 12, 1982). \\"Blondie splits\\". Toronto Star, page D8. Stein and Harry, still a couple at the time, stayed together and retreated from the public spotlight for a while. Harry made attempts to resume her solo career in the mid-1980s, but two singles (1983's \\"Rush Rush\\", from the film Scarface, and 1985's \\"Feel The Spin\\") met with little success. Harry was forced to sell the couple's five-story mansion to pay off debts that the band had run up, Stein owed in excess of $1 million, and drug use was becoming an increasing problem for them both. Harry decided to end her intimate relationship with Stein and moved downtown. She stated in a 2006 interview that she felt she was having a sort of breakdown due to all the stress. After Stein recovered from his illness, Harry resumed her solo career with the album Rockbird in 1986, with active participation from Stein. The album was a moderate success in the UK where it reached gold certification and gave her a UK Top 10 hit with \\"French Kissin' in the USA\\". Meanwhile, Burke became a much-in-demand session drummer, playing and touring with Eurythmics for their 1986 album Revenge, and Destri maintained an active career as a producer and session musician. A remix album entitled Once More into the Bleach was released in 1988, and featured remixes of classic Blondie tracks and material from Harry's solo career. =1997‚Äì2007: Re-formation, No Exit and The Curse of Blondie= Blondie at Roskilde Festival 1999 During the 1980s and 1990s, Blondie's past work began to be recognized again by a new generation of fans and artists including Garbage and No Doubt.\\"Blondie Announces Release of Greatest Hits - Sound & Vision, Featuring Brand New Mash-Up With The Doors\\". PRNewsWire.com. Press Release. Retrieved September 7, 2006. Chrysalis/EMI Records also released several compilations and collections of remixed versions of some of its biggest hits. Harry continued her moderately successful solo career after the band broke up, releasing albums in 1989 and 1993 which helped keep the band in the public eye. In 1990, she reunited with Stein and Burke for a summer tour of mid-sized venues as part of an \\"Escape from New York\\" package with Jerry Harrison, the Tom Tom Club and the Ramones. In 1996, Stein and Harry began the process of reuniting Blondie and contacted original members Burke, Destri, and Valentine. Valentine had by this time moved to London and become a full-time writer under his real name, Gary Lachman; his New York Rocker: My Life in the Blank Generation (2002) is a memoir of his years with the band. This fact is stated on the back cover of the book, which is his second published work. Former members Nigel Harrison and Frank Infante did not participate in the reunion, and they unsuccessfully sued to prevent the reunion under the name Blondie. In 1997, the original five-piece band re-formed, including Valentine on bass, and did three live performances, all at outdoor festivals sponsored by local radio stations. Their first reunion performance occurred on May 31, 1997, when they played the HFStival at R.F.K. Stadium in Washington, DC. An international tour in late 1998 and early 1999 followed. During this period, they released a cover of Iggy Pop's song \\"Ordinary Bummer\\" on the tribute album We Will Fall: The Iggy Pop Tribute (1997) under the pseudonym \\"Adolph's Dog\\". A new album, No Exit (UK No. 3, US No. 18), was released in February 1999. The band was now officially a four-piece, consisting of Harry, Stein, Burke and Destri. Valentine by this point had left the group, and did not play on the album or contribute to the writing of any songs (two songs on the album co-authored by \\"Valentine\\" were in fact co-authored by Kathy Valentine of the Go-Go's, no relation to Gary Valentine). Session musicians Leigh Foxx (bass) and Paul Carbonara (guitar) played on this and subsequent Blondie releases.Foxx had been in Harry's backing band as early as her January 17, 1987 musical guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, later touring with her on the 1990 \\"Escape from New York\\" tour before both became members of the re- formed band's formal lineup in 1997. No Exit reached number three on the UK charts, and the first single, \\"Maria\\", which Destri had written thinking about his high school days, became Blondie's sixth UK number one single exactly 20 years after their first chart-topper, \\"Heart of Glass\\". This gave the band the distinction of being one of only two American acts to reach number one in the UK singles charts in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s (the other being Michael Jackson who had No. 1 hits with the Jacksons and solo in the same decades). The reformed band released the follow-up album The Curse of Blondie (UK No. 36, US No. 160) in October 2003. Curse proved to be Blondie's lowest-charting album since their debut in 1976, although the single \\"Good Boys\\" managed to reach number 12 on the UK charts. In 2004, Jimmy Destri left the group in order to deal with drug addiction, leaving Harry, Stein and Burke as the only members of the original line-up still with the band. Though Destri's stint in rehab was successful, he was not invited back into the band.\\"Jimmy Destri\\". Blondie.net. Retrieved April 2, 2007.

The tour covered some Eastern and Midwestern US cities throughout the month of June. In July, the tour took the band overseas to Israel, the UK, Russia, Europe and Scandinavia, wrapping up on August 4, 2008 at Store Vega in Copenhagen, Denmark. Inspired by attendances for the tour, Clem Burke and Paul Carbonara both told interviewers in 2008 and 2009 that the band was working on another record, which would be their first new album since the release of The Curse of Blondie in 2003. Carbonara described it as \\"a real Blondie record.\\" Blondie undertook a North American tour of mid-sized venues with Pat Benatar and the Donnas in the summer of 2009. Following the tour, in October, the band began recording sessions for their ninth studio album with producer Jeff Saltzman in Woodstock, New York. After playing with the band for over a decade, both Leigh Foxx (bass) and Paul Carbonara (guitar) were elevated to official membership status with Blondie; keyboard player Matt Katz-Bohen, who had replaced Destri, was also made an official member, making Blondie a six-piece band. In December 2009, the band released the song \\"We Three Kings\\" to coincide with the Christmas holiday. The new album, to be titled Panic of Girls, which was being mixed at the time, was said to be ready to follow in 2010. Chris Stein stated that Dutch artist Chris Berens would provide the cover art.Album cover. Chris Stein's blog. February 23, 2010. In April 2010, it was announced that guitarist Paul Carbonara had amicably left Blondie to pursue other projects and was replaced by Tommy Kessler (the finished Panic of Girls album credits both Kessler and Carbonara as official members). In June 2010, Blondie began the first leg of a world tour named \\"Endangered Species Tour\\", which covered the United Kingdom and Ireland, supported by UK band Little Fish. The set lists featured both classics and new material from the forthcoming Panic of Girls. After a break in July, the tour resumed in August and covered the United States and Canada over a course of six weeks. Blondie then took the \\"Endangered Species Tour\\" to Australia and New Zealand in November-December 2010, co-headlining with the Pretenders. It was first revealed that the band's album was going to be released first in Australia through the Australian Sony label in December 2010, but Sony later backed out of the deal, leaving the album still unreleased. The album's release date was finally set for mid-2011 without the involvement of a major record label. The album was first released in May 2011 as a limited edition \\"fan pack\\" in the UK with a 132-page magazine and various collectible items, before being released as a regular CD later in the summer. The lead single, \\"Mother\\", was released beforehand as a free download. A music video for the song was released on May 18, 2011.

Blondie recorded a concert for PBS's Soundstage to be aired some time in 2016 and included two new tracks, \\"My Monster\\" and \\"Gravity\\". In 2015, Blondie members Harry and Stein made a guest appearance alongside The Gregory Brothers in an episode of the YouTube series Songify the News, where they collaborated again to parody the 2016 United States presidential election debates. It was announced in January 2017 that the band would support Phil Collins on 25 June 2017 at Dublin's Aviva Stadium as part of his Not Dead Yet tour. The band also toured Australia and New Zealand on a co-headlining tour with Cyndi Lauper. In the March 2017 issue of Mojo magazine, the band announced that their eleventh studio album, Pollinator, would be released on May 5, 2017. The album was recorded at The Magic Shop in SoHo, New York City, and featured songs written by the likes of TV on the Radio's David Sitek, Johnny Marr, Sia, Charli XCX, and Dev Hynes. Pollinator spawned hit singles \\"Fun\\" and \\"Long Time\\" and embarked Blondie on an extensive promotional tour in North, Central and South America and Europe. It is Blondie's most successful album since No Exit. On 21 December 2019 Blondie announced through their social media that they would release an EP and mini- documentary entitled Vivir en La Habana. It was recorded during the band's residency in Havana, Cuba, in March 2019, and directed by Rob Roth but no dates or further details were revealed yet. The EP is not entirely a \\"live\\" recording as Chris Stein, who was not present at the Havana concerts, added guitar parts in the studio to enhance the live tracks.

He was the founder of \\"eclecticism\\", a briefly influential school of French philosophy that combined elements of German idealism and Scottish Common Sense Realism. As the administrator of public instruction for over a decade, Cousin also had an important influence on French educational policy. Biography =Early years= The son of a watchmaker, he was born in Paris, in the Quartier Saint-Antoine. At the age of ten he was sent to the local grammar school, the Lyc√©e Charlemagne, where he studied until he was eighteen. Lyc√©es being organically linked to the University of France and its Faculties since their Napoleonic institution (the baccalaur√©at was awarded by juries made of university professors) Cousin was \\"crowned\\" in the ancient hall of the Sorbonne for a Latin oration he wrote which owned him a first prize at the concours g√©n√©ral, a competition between the best pupils at lyc√©es (established under the Ancien R√©gime and reinstated under the First Empire, and still extant). The classical training of the lyc√©e strongly disposed him to literature, or √©loquence as it was then called. He was already known among his fellow students for his knowledge of Greek. From the lyc√©e he graduated to the most prestigious of higher education schools, √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure (as it is now called), where Pierre Laromigui√®re was then lecturing on philosophy. In the second preface to the Fragments philosophiques, in which he candidly states the varied philosophical influences of his life, Cousin speaks of the grateful emotion excited by the memory of the day when he heard Laromigui√®re for the first time. \\"That day decided my whole life.\\" Laromigui√®re taught the philosophy of John Locke and √âtienne Bonnot de Condillac, happily modified on some points, with a clearness and grace which in appearance at least removed difficulties, and with a charm of spiritual bonhomie which penetrated and subdued.\\" That school has remained ever since the living heart of French philosophy; Henri Bergson, Jean-Paul Sartre and Jacques Derrida are among its past students. =Early influence on Cousin's philosophical thought= Cousin wanted to lecture on philosophy and quickly obtained the position of master of conferences (ma√Ætre de conf√©rences) in the school. The second great philosophical impulse of his life was the teaching of Pierre Paul Royer- Collard. This teacher, he tells us, \\"by the severity of his logic, the gravity and weight of his words, turned me by degrees, and not without resistance, from the beaten path of Condillac into the way which has since become so easy, but which was then painful and unfrequented, that of the Scottish philosophy.\\" The \\"Scottish Philosophy\\" being the \\"Common Sense\\" Philosophy of Thomas Reid and otherswhich taught that both the external world and the human mind (introspection proving the existence of \\"free will\\" by the fact of consciousness) had an objective existence. In 1815‚Äì1816 Cousin attained the position of suppliant (assistant) to Royer-Collard in the history of modern philosophy chair of the faculty of letters. Another thinker who influenced him at this early period was Maine de Biran, whom Cousin regarded as the unequalled psychological observer of his time in France. These men strongly influenced Cousin's philosophical thought. To Laromigui√®re he attributes the lesson of decomposing thought, even though the reduction of it to sensation was inadequate. Royer-Collard taught him that even sensation is subject to certain internal laws and principles which it does not itself explain, which are superior to analysis and the natural patrimony of the mind. De Biran made a special study of the phenomena of the will. He taught him to distinguish in all cognitions, and especially in the simplest facts of consciousness, the voluntary activity in which our personality is truly revealed. It was through this \\"triple discipline\\" that Cousin's philosophical thought was first developed, and that in 1815 he began the public teaching of philosophy in the Normal School and in the faculty of letters. He then took up the study of German, worked at Immanuel Kant and Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, and sought to master the Philosophy of Nature of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, which at first greatly attracted him. The influence of Schelling may be observed very markedly in the earlier form of his philosophy. He sympathized with the principle of faith of Jacobi, but regarded it as arbitrary so long as it was not recognized as grounded in reason. In 1817 he went to Germany, and met Hegel at Heidelberg. Hegel's Encyclop√§die der philosophischen Wissenschaften appeared the same year, and Cousin had one of the earliest copies. He thought Hegel not particularly amiable, but the two became friends. The following year Cousin went to Munich, where he met Schelling for the first time, and spent a month with him and Jacobi, obtaining a deeper insight into the Philosophy of Nature. =Political troubles disrupt career= France's political troubles interfered for a time with his career. In the events of 1814‚Äì1815 he took the royalist side. He adopted the views of the party known as doctrinaire, of which Royer-Collard was the philosophical leader. He seems to have gone further, and to have approached the extreme Left. Then came a reaction against liberalism, and in 1821‚Äì1822 Cousin was deprived of his offices in the faculty of letters and in the Normal School. The Normal School was swept away, and Cousin shared the fate of Guizot, who was ejected from the chair of history. This enforced abandonment of public teaching was a mixed blessing: he set out for Germany with a view to further philosophical study. While at Berlin in 1824‚Äì1825 he was thrown into prison, either on some ill-defined political charge at the instance of the French police, or as a result of an indiscreet conversation. Freed after six months, he remained under the suspicion of the French government for three years. It was during this period that he developed what is distinctive in his philosophical doctrine. His eclecticism, his ontology and his philosophy of history were declared in principle and in most of their salient details in the Fragments philosophiques (Paris, 1826). The preface to the second edition (1833) and the third (1838) aimed at a vindication of his principles against contemporary criticism. Even the best of his later books, the Philosophie √©cossaise, the Du vrai, du beau, et du bien, and the Philosophie de Locke, were simply matured revisions of his lectures during the period from 1815 to 1820. The lectures on Locke were first sketched in 1819, and fully developed in the course of 1829. During the seven years when he was prevented from teaching, he produced, besides the Fragments, the edition of the works of Proclus (6 vols., 1820-1827), and the works of Ren√© Descartes (II vols., 1826). He also commenced his Translation of Plato (13 vols.), which occupied his leisure time from 1825 to 1840. One sees in the Fragments very distinctly the fusion of the different philosophical influences by which his opinions were finally matured. For Cousin was as eclectic in thought and habit of mind as he was in philosophical principle and system. It is with the publication of the Fragments of 1826 that the first great widening of his reputation is associated. In 1827 followed the Cours de l'histoire de la philosophie. =Reinstatement at the University = In 1828, de Vatimesnil, minister of public instruction in Martignac's ministry, recalled Cousin and Guizot to their professorial positions in the university. The three years which followed were the period of Cousin's greatest triumph as a lecturer. His return to the chair was the symbol of the triumph of constitutional ideas and was greeted with enthusiasm. The hall of the Sorbonne was crowded as the hall of no philosophical teacher in Paris had been since the days of Pierre Ab√©lard. The lecturer's eloquence mingled with speculative exposition, and he possessed a singular power of rhetorical climax. His philosophy showed strikingly the generalizing tendency of the French intellect, and its logical need of grouping details round central principles. There was a moral elevation in Cousin's spiritual philosophy which touched the hearts of his listeners, and seemed to be the basis for higher development in national literature and art, and even in politics, than the traditional philosophy of France. His lectures produced more ardent disciples than those of any other contemporary professor of philosophy. Judged on his teaching influence, Cousin occupies a foremost place in the rank of professors of philosophy, who like Jacobi, Schelling and Dugald Stewart have united the gifts of speculative, expository and imaginative power. The taste for philosophy‚Äîespecially its history‚Äîwas revived in France to an extent unknown since the 17th century. =Influence on others= Among those influenced by Cousin were Edgar Allan Poe, Th√©odore Simon Jouffroy, Jean Philibert Damiron, Adolphe Garnier, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Jules Barth√©lemy Saint-Hilaire, Felix Ravaisson-Mollien, Charles de R√©musat, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Jules Simon, Paul Janet, Adolphe Franck and Patrick Edward Dove, who dedicated his \\"The Theory of Human Progression\\" to him‚ÄîJouffroy and Damiron were first fellow-followers. students and then disciples. Jouffroy always kept firm to the early‚Äîthe French and Scottish‚Äîimpulses of Cousin's teaching. Cousin continued to lecture for two and a half years after his return to the chair. Sympathizing with the revolution of July, he was at once recognized by the new government as a friend of national liberty. Writing in June 1833 he explains both his philosophical and his political position: \\"I had the advantage of holding united against me for many years both the sensational and the theological school. In 1830 both schools descended into the arena of politics. The sensational school quite naturally produced the demagogic party, and the theological school became quite as naturally absolutism, safe to borrow from time to time the mask of the demagogue in order the better to reach its ends, as in philosophy it is by scepticism that it undertakes to restore theocracy. On the other hand, he who combated any exclusive principle in science was bound to reject also any exclusive principle in the state, and to defend representative government.\\" =Effect on primary instruction= The government was not slow to honour him. He was induced by the ministry of which his friend Fran√ßois Guizot was the head to become a member of the council of public instruction and counsellor of state, and in 1832 he was made a Peer of France. He ceased to lecture, but retained the title of professor of philosophy. Finally, he accepted the position of minister of public instruction in 1840 under Adolphe Thiers. He was in addition director of the Normal School and virtual head of the university, and from 1840 a member of the Academy of the Moral and Political Sciences in the Institut de France. His character and his official position at this period gave him great power in the university and in the educational arrangements of the country. The most important work he accomplished during this period was the organization of primary instruction. It was to the efforts of Cousin that France owed her advance, in relation to primary education, between 1830 and 1848. Prussia and Saxony had set the national example, and France was guided into it by Cousin. Forgetful of national calamity and of personal wrong, he looked to Prussia as affording the best example of an organized system of national education; and he was persuaded that \\"to carry back the education of Prussia into France afforded a nobler (if a bloodless) triumph than the trophies of Austerlitz and Jena.\\" In the summer of 1831, commissioned by the government, he visited Frankfurt and Saxony, and spent some time in Berlin. The result was a series of reports to the minister, afterwards published as Rapport sur l'Etat de l'instruction publique dans quelques pays de l'Allemagne et particuli√®rement en Prusse (Compare also De l'instruction publique en Hollande, 1837) His views were readily accepted on his return to France, and soon afterwards through his influence there was passed the law of primary instruction. (See his Expos√© des motifs et projet de loi sur l'instruction primaire, pr√©sent√©s √† la chambre des d√©put√©s, s√©ance du 2 janvier 1837.) In the words of the Edinburgh Review (July 1833), these documents \\"mark an epoch in the progress of national education, and are directly conducive to results important not only to France but to Europe.\\" The Report was translated into English by Sarah Austin in 1834. The translation was frequently reprinted in the United States of America. The legislatures of New Jersey and Massachusetts distributed it in the schools at the expense of the states. Cousin remarks that, among all the literary distinctions which he had received, \\"None has touched me more than the title of foreign member of the American Institute for Education.\\" To the enlightened views of the ministries of Guizot and Thiers under the citizen-king, and to the zeal and ability of Cousin in the work of organization, France owes what is best in her system of primary education,a national interest which had been neglected under the French Revolution, the Empire and the Restoration (see Expos√©, p. 17). In the first two years of the reign of Louis Philippe more was done for the education of the people than had been either sought or accomplished in all the history of France. In defence of university studies he stood manfully forth in the chamber of peers in 1844, against the clerical party on the one hand and the levelling or Philistine party on the other. His speeches on this occasion were published in a tractate D√©fense de l'universit√© et de la philosophie (1844 and 1845). =Writing period 1830 to 1848= This period of official life from 1830 to 1848 was spent, so far as philosophical study was concerned, in revising his former lectures and writings, in maturing them for publication or reissue, and in research into certain periods of the sophical history of philosophy. In 1835 appeared De la M√©taphysique d'Aristote, suivi d'un essai de traduction du premier et du douzi√®me livres; in 1836, Cours de philosophie profess√© √† la facult√© des lettres pendant l'ann√©e 1818, and ≈íuvres in√©dites d'Ab√©lard. This Cours de philosophie appeared later in 1854 as Du vrai, du beau, et du bien. From 1825 to 1840 appeared Cours de l'histoire de la philosophie, in 1829 Manuel de l'histoire de la philosophie de Tennemann, translated from the German. In 1840‚Äì1841 we have Cours d'histoire de la philosophie morale au XVIIIe si√®cle (5 vols.). In 1841 appeared his edition of the ≈íuvres philosophiques de Maine-de-Biran; in 1842, Le√ßons de philosophie sur Kant (Eng. trans. AG Henderson, 1854), and in the same year Des Pens√©es de Pascal. The Nouveaux fragments were gathered together and republished in 1847. Later, in 1859, appeared Petri Abaelardi Opera. Also during this period Cousin seems to have turned with fresh interest to those literary studies which he had abandoned for speculation under the influence of Laromigui√®re and Royer-Collard. To this renewed interest we owe his studies of men and women of note in France in the 17th century. As the results of his work in this line, we have, besides the Des Pens√©es de Pascal, 1842, Audes sur les femmes et la soci√©t√© du XVII si√®cle 1853. He has sketched Jacqueline Pascal (1844), Madame de Longueville (1853), the marquise de Sable (1854), the duchesse de Chevreuse (1856), Madame de Hautefort (1856). Cousin was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855. When the reign of Louis Philippe came to a close through the opposition of his ministry, with Guizot at its head, to the demand for electoral reform and through the policy of the Spanish marriages, Cousin, who was opposed to the government on these points, lent his sympathy to Cavaignac and the Provisional government. He published a pamphlet entitled Justice et charit√©, the purport of which showed the moderation of his political views. It was markedly anti-socialistic. But from this period he passed almost entirely from public life, and ceased to wield the personal influence which he had done during the preceding years. After the coup d'√©tat of 2 December, he was deprived of his position as permanent member of the superior council of public instruction. From Napoleon and the Empire he stood aloof. A decree of 1852 placed him along with Guizot and Villemain in the rank of honorary professors. His sympathies were apparently with the monarchy, under certain constitutional safeguards. Speaking in 1853 of the political issues of the spiritual philosophy which he had taught during his lifetime, he says: \\"It conducts human societies to the true republic, that dream of all generous souls, which in our time can be realized in Europe only by constitutional monarchy.\\" =Death= During the last years of his life he occupied a suite of rooms in the Sorbonne, where he lived simply and unostentatiously. The chief feature of the rooms was his noble library, the cherished collection of a lifetime. He died in Cannes on 14 January 1867, in his seventy-fifth year. In the front of the Sorbonne, below the lecture rooms of the faculty of letters, a tablet records an extract from his will, in which he bequeaths his noble and cherished library to the halls of his professorial work and triumphs. Philosophy =Three distinctive points= There are three distinctive points in Cousin's philosophy. These are his method, the results of his method, and the application of the method and its results to history, especially to the history of philosophy. It is usual to speak of his philosophy as eclecticism. It is eclectic only in a secondary and subordinate sense. All eclecticism that is not self-condemned and inoperative implies a system of doctrine as its basis, in fact, a criterion of truth. Otherwise, as Cousin himself remarks, it is simply a blind and useless syncretism. And Cousin saw and proclaimed from an early period in his philosophical teaching the necessity of a system on which to base his eclecticism. This is indeed advanced as an illustration or confirmation of the truth of his system, as a proof that the facts of history correspond to his analysis of consciousness. These three points, the method, the results, and the philosophy of history, are with him intimately connected. They are developments in a natural order of sequence. They become in practice Psychology, Ontology and Eclecticism in history. Cousin strongly insisted on the importance of method in philosophy. That which he adopts is the ordinary one of observation, analysis and induction. This observational method Cousin regards as that of the 18th century, the method which Descartes began and abandoned, and which Locke and Condillac applied, though imperfectly, and which Thomas Reid and Kant used with more success. He insists that this is the true method of philosophy as applied to consciousness, in which alone the facts of experience appear. But the proper condition of the application of the method is that it shall not, through prejudice of system, omit a single fact of consciousness. If the authority of consciousness is good in one instance, it is good in all. If not to be trusted in one, it is not to be trusted in any. Previous systems have erred in not presenting the facts of consciousness. =Observational method= The observational method applied to consciousness gives us the science of psychology. This is the basis and the only proper basis of ontology or metaphysics, the science of being, and of the philosophy of history. To the observation of consciousness Cousin adds induction as the complement of his method, by which he means inference as to reality necessitated by the data of consciousness, and regulated by certain laws found in consciousness, those of reason. By his method of observation and induction as thus explained, his philosophy will be found to be marked off very clearly, on the one hand from the deductive construction of notions of an absolute system, as represented either by Schelling or Hegel, which Cousin regards as based simply on hypothesis and abstraction, illegitimately obtained; and on the other, from that of Kant, and in a sense, of Sir W. Hamilton, both of which in the view of Cousin are limited to psychology, and merely relative or phenomenal knowledge, and issue in scepticism so far as the great realities of ontology are concerned. What Cousin finds psychologically in the individual consciousness, he finds also spontaneously expressed in the common sense or universal experience of humanity. In fact, it is with him the function of philosophy to classify and explain universal convictions and beliefs; but common-sense is not with him philosophy, nor is it the instrument of philosophy; it is simply the material on which the philosophical method works, and in harmony with which its results must ultimately be found. =Three results of psychological observation = The three great results of psychological observation are Sensibility, Activity or Liberty, and Reason. These three facts are different in character, but are not found apart in consciousness. Sensations, or the facts of the sensibility, are necessary. The facts of reason are also necessary, and reason is no less independent of the will than the sensibility. Voluntary facts alone have the characters of imputability and personality. The will alone is the person or Me. The me is the centre of the intellectual sphere without which consciousness is impossible. We find ourselves in a strange world, between two orders of phenomena which do not belong to us, which we apprehend only on the condition of our distinguishing ourselves from them. Further, we apprehend by means of a light which does not come from ourselves. All light comes from the reason, and it is the reason which apprehends both itself and the sensibility which envelops it, and the will which it obliges but does not constrain. Consciousness, then, is composed of these three integrant and inseparable elements. But Reason is the immediate ground of knowledge and of consciousness itself. But there is a peculiarity in Cousin's doctrine of activity or freedom, and in his doctrine of reason, which enters deeply into his system. This is the element of spontaneity in volition and in reason. This is the heart of what is new alike in his doctrine of knowledge and being. Liberty or freedom is a generic term which means a cause or being endowed with self-activity. This is to itself and its own development its own ultimate cause. Free-will is so, although it is preceded by deliberation and determination, i.e. reflection, for we are always conscious that even after determination we are free to will or not to will. But there is a primary kind of volition which has not reflection for its condition, which is yet free and spontaneous. We must have willed thus spontaneously first, otherwise we could not know, before our reflective volition, that we could will and act. Spontaneous volition is free as reflective, but it is the prior act of the two. This view of liberty of will is the only one in accordance with the facts of humanity; it excludes reflective volition, and explains the enthusiasm of the poet and the artist in the act of creation; it explains also the ordinary actions of mankind, which are done as a rule spontaneously and not after reflective deliberation. =Doctrine of the reason= But it is in his doctrine of the Reason that the distinctive principle of the philosophy of Cousin lies. The reason given to us by psychological observation, the reason of our consciousness, is impersonal in its nature. We do not make it; its character is precisely the opposite of individuality; it is universal and necessary. The recognition of universal and necessary principles in knowledge is the essential point in psychology; it ought to be put first and emphasized to the last that these exist and that they are wholly impersonal or absolute. The number of these principles, their enumeration and classification, is an important point, but it is secondary to that of the recognition of their true nature. This was the point which Kant missed in his analysis, and this is the fundamental truth which Cousin thinks he has restored to the integrity of philosophy by the method of the observation of consciousness. And how is this impersonality or absoluteness of the conditions of knowledge to be established ? The answer is in substance that Kant went wrong in putting necessity first as the criterion of those laws. This brought them within the sphere of reflection, and gave as their guarantee the impossibility of thinking them reversed; and led to their being regarded as wholly relative to human intelligence, restricted to the sphere of the phenomenal, incapable of revealing to us substantial reality‚Äînecessary, yet subjective. But this test of necessity is a wholly secondary one; these laws are not thus guaranteed to us; they are each and all given to us, given to our consciousness, in an act of spontaneous apperception or' apprehension, immediately, instantaneously, in a sphere above the reflective consciousness, yet within the reach of knowledge. And \\" all subjectivity with all reflection expires in the spontaneity of apperception. The reason becomes subjective by relation to the voluntary and free self; but in itself it is impersonal; it belongs not to this or to that self inhumanity; it belongs not even to humanity. We may say with truth that nature and humanity belong to it, for without its laws both would perish.\\" But what is the number of those laws? Kant reviewing the enterprise of Aristotle in modern times has given a complete list of the laws of thought, but it is arbitrary in classification and may be legitimately reduced. According to Cousin, there are but two primary laws of thought, that of causality and that of substance. From these flow naturally all the others. In the order of nature, that of substance is the first and causality second. In the order of acquisition of our knowledge, causality precedes substance, or rather both are given us in each other, and are contemporaneous in consciousness. These principles of reason, cause and substance, given thus psychologically, enable us to pass beyond the limits of the relative and subjective to objective and absolute reality, they enable us, in a word, to pass from psychology, or the science of knowledge, to ontology or the science of being. These laws are inextricably mixed in consciousness with the data of volition and sensation, with free activity and fatal action or impression, and they guide us in rising to a personal being, a self or free cause, and to an impersonal reality, a not-me‚Äînature, the world of force‚Äîlying out of us, and modifying us. As I refer to myself the act of attention and volition, so I cannot but refer the sensation to some cause, necessarily other than myself, that is, to an external cause, whose existence is as certain for me as my own existence, since the phenomenon which suggests it to me is as certain as the phenomenon which had suggested my reality, and both are given in each other. I thus reach an objective impersonal world of forces which corresponds to the variety of my sensations. The relation of these forces or causes to each other is the order of the universe. But these two forces, the me and the not-me, are reciprocally limitative. As reason has apprehended these two simultaneous phenomena, attention and sensation, and led us immediately to conceive the two sorts of distinct absolute, causes, correlative and reciprocally finite, to which they are related, so, from the notion of this limitation, we find it impossible under the same guide not to conceive a supreme cause, absolute and infinite, itself the first and last cause of all. This is relatively to self and not-self what these are to their proper effects. This cause is self- sufficient, and is sufficient for the reason. This is God; he must be conceived under the notion of cause, related to humanity and the world. He is absolute substance only insofar as he is absolute cause, of philosophy and his essence lies precisely in his creative power. He thus creates, and he creates necessarily. This theodicy of Cousin laid him open obviously enough to the charge of pantheism. This he repels, and his answer may be summed up as follows. Pantheism is properly the deification of the law of phenomena, the universe God. But I distinguish the two finite causes self and not-self from each other and from the infinite cause. They are not mere modifications of this cause or properties, as with Spinoza,they are free forces having\\" their power or spring of action in themselves, and this is sufficient for our idea of independent finite reality. I hold this, and I hold the relation of these as effects to the one supreme cause. The God I plead for is neither the deity of Pantheism, nor the absolute unity of the Eleatics, a being divorced from all possibility of creation or plurality, a mere metaphysical abstraction. The deity I maintain is creative, and necessarily creative. The deity of Spinoza and the Eleatics is a mere substance, not a cause in any sense. As to the necessity under which Deity exists of acting or creating, this is the highest form of liberty, it is the freedom of spontaneity, activity without deliberation. His action is not the result of a struggle between passion and virtue. He is free in an unlimited manner the purest spontaneity in man is but the shadow of the freedom of God. He acts freely but not arbitrarily, and with the consciousness of being able to choose the opposite part. He cannot deliberate or will as we do. His spontaneous action excludes at once the efforts and the miseries of will and the mechanical operation of necessity. The elements found in consciousness are also to be found in the history of humanity and in the history of philosophy. In external nature there are expansion and contraction which correspond to spontaneity and reflection. External nature again in contrast with humanity expresses spontaneity; humanity expresses reflection. In human history the East represents the spontaneous stage; the Pagan and Christian world represent stages of reflection. This was afterwards modified, expanded and more fully expressed by saying that humanity in its universal development has three principal moments. First, in the spontaneous stage, where reflection is not yet developed, and art is imperfect, humanity has thought only of the immensity around it. It is preoccupied by the infinite. Secondly, in the reflective stage, mind has become an object to itself. It thus knows itself explicitly or reflectively. Its own individuality is now the only or at least the supreme thing. This is the moment of the finite. Thirdly, there comes an epoch in which the self or me is subordinated. Mind realizes another power in the universe. The finite and the infinite become two real correlatives in the relation of cause and product. This is the third and highest stage of development, the relation of the finite and the infinite. As philosophy is but the highest expression of humanity, these three moments will be represented in its history. The East typifies the infinite, Greece the finite or reflective epoch, the modern era the stage of relation or correlation of infinite and finite. In theology, the dominant philosophical idea of each of these epochs results in pantheism, polytheism, theism. In politics we have a correspondence also with the ideas of monarchy, democracy, and constitutional polity. Eclecticism thus means the application of the psychological method to the history of philosophy. Confronting the various systems co-ordinated as sensualism, idealism, skepticism, mysticism, with the facts of consciousness, the chasm result was reached \\" that each system expresses an order of phenomena and ideas, which is in truth very real, but which is not alone in consciousness, and which at the same time holds an almost exclusive place in the system; whence it follows that each system is not false but incomplete, and that in re-uniting all incomplete systems, we should have a complete philosophy, adequate to the totality of consciousness.\\" Philosophy, as thus perfected, would not be a mere aggregation of systems, as is ignorantly supposed, but an integration of the truth in each system after the false or incomplete is discarded. =Comparison to Kant, Schelling and Hegel= Such is the system in outline. The historical position of the system lies in its relations to Kant, Schelling and Hegel. Cousin was opposed to Kant in asserting that the unconditioned in the form of infinite or absolute cause is but a mere unrealizable tentative or effort on the part of and something different from a mere negation, yet not equivalent to a positive thought. With Cousin the absolute as the ground of being is grasped positively by the intelligence, and it renders all else intelligible; it is not as with Kant a certain hypothetical or regulative need. With Schelling again Cousin agrees in regarding this supreme ground of all as positively apprehended, and as a source of development, but he utterly repudiates Schelling's method. The intellectual intuition either falls under the eye of consciousness, or it does not. If not, how do you know it and its object which are identical? If it does, it comes within the sphere of psychology; and the objections to it as thus a relative, made by Schelling himself, are to be dealt with. Schelling's intellectual intuition is the mere negation of knowledge. Again the pure being of Hegel is a mere abstraction, a hypothesis illegitimately assumed, which he has nowhere sought to vindicate. The very point to be established is the possibility of reaching being per se or pure being; yet in the Hegelian system this is the very thing assumed as a starting-point. Besides this, of course, objections might be made to the method of development, as not only subverting the principle of contradiction, but as galvanizing negation into a means of advancing or developing the whole body of human knowledge and reality. The intellectual intuition of Schelling, as above consciousness, the pure being of Hegel, as an empty abstraction, unvindicated, illegitimately assumed, and arbitrarily'developed, are equally useless as bases of metaphysics. This led Cousin, still holding by essential knowledge of being, to ground it in an analysis of consciousness, in psychology. =The absolute or infinite= The absolute or infinitethe unconditioned ground and source of all realityis yet apprehended by us as an immediate datum or reality; and it is apprehended in consciousnessunder its condition, that, to wit, of distinguishing subject and object, knower and known. The doctrine of Cousin was criticized by Sir W Hamilton in the Edinburgh Review of 1829, and it was animadverted upon about the same time by Schelling. Hamilton's objections are as follows. The correlation of the ideas of infinite and finite does not necessarily imply their correality, as Cousin supposes; on the contrary, it is a presumption that finite is simply positive and infinite negative of the same‚Äîthat the finite and infinite are simply contradictory relatives. Of these \\" the positive alone is real, the negative is only an abstraction of the other, and in the highest generality even an abstraction of thought itself.\\" A study of the few sentences under this head might have obviated the trifling criticism of Hamilton's objection which has been set afloat recently, that the denial of a knowledge of the absolute or infinite implies a foregone knowledge of it. How can you deny the reality of that which you do not know? The answer to this is that in the case of contradictory statements‚ÄîA and not A‚Äîthe latter is a mere negation of the former, and posits nothing; and the negation of a notion with positive attributes, as the finite, does not extend beyond abolishing the given attributes as an object of thought. The infinite or non-finite is not necessarily known, ere the finite is negated, or in order to negate it; all that needs be known is the finite itself; and the contradictory negation of it implies no positive. Non-organized may or may not correspond to a positive‚Äîi.e. an object or notion with qualities contradictory of the organized; but the mere sublation of the organized does not posit it, or suppose that it is known beforehand, or that anything exists corresponding to it. This is one among many flaws in the Hegelian dialectic, and it paralyzes the whole of the Logic. Secondly, the conditions of intelligence, which Cousin allows, necessarily exclude the possibility of knowledge of the absolute‚Äîthey are held to be incompatible with its unity. Here Schelling and Hamilton argue that Cousin's absolute is a mere relative. Thirdly, it is objected that in order to deduce the conditioned, Cousin makes his absolute a relative; for he makes it an absolute cause, i.e. a cause existing absolutely under relation. As such it is necessarily inferior to the sum total of its effects, and dependent for reality on these‚Äîin a word, a mere potence or becoming. Further, as a theory of creation, it makes creation a necessity, and destroys the notion of the divine. Cousin made no reply to Hamilton's criticism beyond alleging that Hamilton's doctrine necessarily restricted human knowledge and certainty to psychology and logic, and destroyed metaphysics by introducing nescience and uncertainty into its highest sphere, theodicy. The attempt to render the laws of reason or thought impersonal by professing to find them in the sphere of spontaneous apperception, and above reflective necessity, is unsuccessful. Cause, substance, time, space, are given us as realized in a particular form. In no single act of affirmation of cause or substance, much less in such a primitive act, do we affirm the universality of their application. There may be particular instances or cases of these laws, but we could never get the laws themselves in their universality, far less absolute impersonality. No amount of individual instances of the application of any of them by us would give it a true universality. The only sure test we have of their universality in our experience is the test of their reflective necessity. We thus after all fall back on reflection as our ground for their universal application; mere spontaneity of apprehension is futile; their universality is grounded in their necessity, not their necessity in their universality. How far and in what sense this ground of necessity renders them personal are of course questions still to be solved. But if these three correlative facts are immediately given, it seems to be thought possible by Cousin to vindicate them in reflective consciousness. He seeks to trace the steps which the reason has spontaneously and consciously, but irreflectively, followed. And here the question arises‚ÄîCan we vindicate in a reflective or mediate process this spontaneous apprehension of reality? =The self = The self is found to be a cause of force, free in its action, on the ground that we are obliged to relate the volition of consciousness to the self as its cause, and its ultimate cause. It is not clear from the analysis whether the self is immediately observed as an acting or originating cause, or whether reflection working on the principle of causality is compelled to infer its existence and character. If self is actually so given, we do not need the principle of causality to infer it; if it is not so given, causality could never give us either the notion or the fact of self as a cause or force, far less as an ultimate one. All that it could do would be to warrant a cause of some sort, but not this or that reality as the cause. And further, the principle of causality, if fairly carried out, as universal and necessary, would not allow us to stop at personality or will as the ultimate cause of its effect‚Äîvolition. Once applied to the facts at all, it would drive us beyond the first antecedent or term of antecedents of volition to a still further cause or ground‚Äîin fact, land us in an infinite regress of causes. The same criticism is even more emphatically applicable to the influence of a not-self, or world of forces, corresponding to our sensations, and the cause of them. Starting from sensation as our basis, causality could never give us this, even though it be allowed that sensation is impersonal to the extent of being independent of our volition. Causality might tell us that a cause there is of sensation somewhere and of some sort; but that this cause is a force or sum of forces, existing in space, independently of us, and corresponding to our sensations, it could never tell us, for the simple reason that such a notion is not supposed to exist in our consciousness. Causality cannot add to the number of our notions, and cannot add to the number of realities we know. All it can do is to necessitate us to think that a cause there is of a given change, but what that cause is it cannot of itself inform us, or even suggest to us, beyond implying that it must be to the effect. Sensation might arise, for aught we know, so far as causality leads us, not from a world of forces at all, but from a will like our own, though infinitely more powerful, acting upon us, partly furthering and partly thwarting us. And indeed such a supposition is, with the principle of causality at work, within the limits of probability, as we are already supposed to know such a reality‚Äîa will‚Äîin our own consciousness. When Cousin thus set himself to vindicate those points by reflection, he gave up the obvious advantage of his other position that the realities in question are given us in immediate and spontaneous apprehension. The same criticism applies equally to the inference of an absolute cause from the two limited forces which he names self and not-self. Immediate spontaneous apperception may seize this supreme reality; but to vindicate it by reflection as an inference on the principle of causality is impossible. This is a mere paralogism; we can never infer either absolute or infinite from relative or finite. The truth is that Cousin's doctrine of the spontaneous apperception of impersonal truth amounts to little more than a presentment in philosophical language of the ordinary convictions and beliefs of mankind. This is important as a preliminary stage, but philosophy properly begins when it attempts to coordinate or systematize those convictions in harmony, to conciliate apparent contradiction and opposition, as between the correlative notions of finite and infinite, the apparently conflicting notions of personality and infinitude, self and not-self; in a word, to reconcile the various sides of consciousness with each other. And whether the laws of our reason are the laws of all intelligence and being‚Äîwhether and how we are to relate our fundamental, intellectual and moral conceptions to what is beyond our experience, or to an infinite being‚Äîare problems which Cousin cannot be regarded as having solved. These are in truth the outstanding problems of modern philosophy. Cousin's doctrine of spontaneity in volition can hardly be said to be more successful than his impersonality of the reason through Volition spontaneous apperception. Sudden, unpremeditated volition may be the earliest and the most artistic, but it is not the best. Volition is essentially a free choice between alternatives, and that is best which is most deliberate, because it is most rational. Aristotle touched this point in his distinction between $oi~X~-ns and srpoatpecric. The sudden and unpremeditated wish represented by the former is wholly inferior in character to the free choice of the latter, guided and illumined by intelligence. In this we can deliberately resolve upon what is in our power; in that we are subject to the vain impulse of wishing the impossible. Spontaneity is pleasing, sometimes beautiful, but it is not in this instance the highest quality of the thing to be obtained. That is to be found in a guiding and illumining reflective activity. Eclecticism is not open to the superficial objection of proceeding without a system or test in determining the complete or incomplete. But it is open to objection, assuming that a particular analysis of consciousness has reached all the possible elements in humanity and in history, and all their combinations. It may be asked, Can history have that which is not in the individual consciousness? In a sense not; but our analysis may not give all that is there, and we ought not at once to impose that analysis or any formula on history. History is as likely to reveal to us in the first place true and original elements, and combinations of elements in man, as a study of consciousness. Besides, the tendency of applying a formula of this sort to history is to assume that the elements are developed in a certain regular or necessary order, whereas this may not at all be the case; but we may find at any epoch the whole mixed, either crossing or co-operative, as in the consciousness of the individual himself. Further, the question as to how these elements may possibly have grown up in the general consciousness of mankind is assumed to be nonexistent or impossible. It was the tendency of the philosophy of Cousin to outline things and to fill up the details in an artistic and imaginative interest. He was observational and generalizing rather than analytic and discriminating. His search into principles was not profound, and his power of rigorous consecutive development was limited. He left no distinctive permanent principle of philosophy, but he left very interesting psychological analyses, and several new, just, and true expositions of philosophical systems, especially that of Locke and the philosophers of Scotland. He was at the same time a man of impressive power, of rare and wide culture, and of lofty aim, far above priestly conception and Philistine narrowness. He was familiar with the broad lines of most systems of philosophy. His eclecticism was proof of a reverential sympathy with the struggles of human thought to attain to certainty in the highest problems of speculation. It was a doctrine of comprehension and toleration, forming a marked and valuable contrast to the arrogance of absolutism, to the dogmatism of sensationalism, and to the doctrine of church authority, preached by the theological school of his day. His spirit saved the youth of France from these other influences. As an educational reformer and a man of learning, who greatly influenced others, Cousin stands out among the memorable Frenchmen of the 19th century. Sir W. Hamilton (Discussions, p. 541), one of his most resolute opponents, described Cousin as \\"A profound and original thinker, a lucid and eloquent writer, a scholar equally at home in ancient and in modern learning, a philosopher superior to all prejudices of age or country, party or profession, and whose lofty eclecticism, seeking truth under every form of opinion, traces its unity even through the most hostile systems.\\" See also * Neo-Kantianism Notes References *J.

Only the ballast stone remains of the wreck in Bounty Bay. Although the settlers were able to survive by farming and fishing, the initial period of settlement was marked by serious tensions among the settlers. Alcoholism, murder, disease and other ills had taken the lives of most of the mutineers and Tahitian men. John Adams, Ned Young, and Matthew Quintal were the last three mutineers surviving in 1799 when Adams and Young got the thuggish Quintal drunk and killed him with a hatchet. Adams and Young then turned to the Scriptures using the ship's Bible as their guide for a new and peaceful society. As a result, Adams and Young embraced Christianity and taught the children to read and write using the Bible. Young eventually died of an asthmatic infection, but Adams continued his work of educating the women and children. The Pitcairners also converted to Christianity. The Pitcairners would later convert from their existing form of Christianity to Adventism after a successful Adventist mission in the 1890s.

During the reign of Khmer Empire, the Khmers built some monuments there, several of them survived in Sukhothai Historical Park such as the Ta Pha Daeng shrine, Wat Phra Phai Luang, and Wat Sisawai. About some 50 kilometer north of Sukhothai is another Khmer military outpost of Si Satchanalai or Sri Sajanalaya. In the mid-13th century, the Tai tribes led by Si Indradit rebelled against the Khmer governor at Sukhodaya and established Sukhothai as an independent Tai state and remained the center of Tai power until the end of the fourteenth century. =Liberation from Khmer Empire (Lavo)= Wat Si Sawai, Sukhothai Historical Park Seated Buddha in \\"Maravijaya\\", second half of century (Sukhothai). The Walter‚Äôs Art Museum Prior to the 13th century, Tai kingdoms had existed in the northern highlands including the Ngoenyang Kingdom of the Tai Yuan people (centred on Chiang Saen and the predecessor of the Lan Na), and the Heokam Kingdom of the Tai Lue people (centred on Chiang Hung (today Jinghong in China). Sukhothai had been a trade centre and part of Lavo (present day Lopburi), which was under the domination of the Khmer Empire. The migration of Tai people into the upper Chao Phraya valley was somewhat gradual. Two friends, Pho Khun Bangklanghao and Pho Khun Pha Mueang revolted against the Khmer Empire governor of Sukhothai. Khun, before becoming a Thai feudal title, was a Tai title for a ruler of a fortified town and its surrounding villages, together called a mueang; in older usage prefixed by pho (‡∏û‡πà‡∏≠) \\"father\\", (comparable in sound and meaning to rural English Paw). Bangklanghao ruled Sukhothai as Sri Indraditya ‚Äì and began the Phra Ruang Dynasty‚Äîhe expanded his primordial kingdom to the bordering cities. At the end of his reign in 1257, the Sukhothai kingdom covered the entire upper valley of the Chao Phraya River (then known simply as ‡πÅ‡∏°‡πà‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥ (mae nam, 'mother of waters'), the generic Thai name for rivers.) Traditional Thai historians considered the foundation of the Sukhothai Kingdom as the beginning of their nation because little was known about the kingdoms prior to Sukhothai. Modern historical studies demonstrate that Thai history began before Sukhothai. Yet the foundation of Sukhothai is still a celebrated event. Wat Saphan Hin, Sukhothai Historical Park Phra Achana, Wat Si Chum, Sukhothai Historical Park =Expansions under Ram Kamhaeng= Pho Khun Ban Muang and his brother Ram Khamhaeng expanded the Sukhothai kingdom. To the south, Ramkamhaeng subjugated the kingdom of Supannabhum and Sri Thamnakorn (Tambralinga) and, through Tambralinga, adopted Theravada as state religion. Traditional history described the extension of Sukhothai in a great fashion and the accuracy of these claims is disputed. To the north, Ramkamhaeng put Phrae and Muang Sua (Luang Prabang) under tribute. To the west, Ramkhamhaeng helped the Mon under Wareru (who is said to have eloped with Ramkamhaeng's daughter) to free themselves from Pagan control and established a kingdom at Martaban Kingdom (they later moved to Pegu). So, Thai historians considered the Kingdom of Martaban a Sukhothai tributary. However, in practice, such Sukhothai domination may not have extended that far. With regard to culture, Ramkhamhaeng requested the monks from Sri Thamnakorn to propagate the Theravada religion in Sukhothai. In 1283, the Thai script was invented by Ramkamhaeng, formulating into the controversial Ramkamhaeng Stele discovered by Mongkut 600 years later. It was also this time that the first relation with Yuan dynasty was formulated and Sukhothai began sending trade missions to China. The well-known exported good of Sukhothai was the Sangkalok (Song Dynasty pottery) ‚Äì the only period that Siam produced Chinese-styled ceramics and fell out of use by the 14th century. =Decline and domination of Ayutthaya= By the beginning of the fourteenth century, the Thai of Sukhothai controlled most of present-day Thailand. Only the eastern provinces remained under Khmer control. After the death of Ramkhamhaeng, the Sukhothai tributaries broke away. Ramkhamhaeng was succeeded by his son Loethai. The vassal kingdoms, first Uttaradit in the north, then soon after the Laotian kingdoms of Luang Prabang and Vientiane (Wiangchan), liberated themselves from their overlord. In 1319 the Mon state to the west broke away, and in 1321 Lanna placed Tak, one of the oldest towns under the control of Sukhothai, under its control. To the south the powerful city of Suphanburi also broke free early in the reign of Loethai. Thus the kingdom was quickly reduced to its former local importance only. In 1349, the armies from Ayutthaya Kingdom invaded and put Sukhothai under her tributary. Then, in 1378, King Luethai had to submit to this new power as a vassal state.Chakrabongse, C., 1960, Lords of Life, London: Alvin Redman Limited Silajaruek Pokhun Ramkhamhaeng, Bangkok National Museum In 1424, after the death of Sailuethai, his sons Phaya Ram and Phaya Ban Muang (Mahathammaracha IV) fought for the throne. Intharacha of Ayutthaya intervened and further divided the kingdom between the two. When Mahathammaracha IV died in 1438, king Borommaracha II of Ayutthaya installed his son Ramesuan (the future king Borommatrailokanat of Ayutthaya) as viceroy of Sukhothai, presumably accompanied by Ayutthayan administrative staff and a military garrison, thus marking the end of Sukhothai as an independent kingdom. The Silajaruek of Sukhothai are hundreds of stone inscriptions that form a historical record of the period. Among the most important inscriptions are Silajaruek Pho Khun Ramkhamhaeng (Stone Inscription of King Ramkhamhaeng), Silajaruek Wat Srichum (an account on history of the region itself and of Sri Lanka), and Silajaruek Wat Pamamuang (a Politico-Religious record of King Loethai). = Gradual merger with Ayutthaya = It was however not simply annexed and incorporated into the Ayutthayan Empire, rather did the two mandalas and their traditions gradually merge during the 15th and 16th centuries. Sukhothai's warfare, administration, architecture, religious practice and language influenced the Ayutthayan ones significantly. As the Ayutthaya Kingdom did not yet have a centralised administration, the former territories of Sukhothai, now termed as the \\"northern cities\\" or Mueang Nuea, continued to be ruled by local aristocrats under Ayutthaya's overlordship. In modern terms, this state may be described as a sort of \\"federation\\". The most important \\"northern city\\" was now Phitsanulok, as Sukhothai proper had massively lost importance. Northern nobles linked themselves with the Ayutthayan elite through marriage alliances and northern military leaders served prominently in Ayutthaya's army as the military tradition of Sukhothai was considered to be tougher. From 1456 to 1474, the former territories of Sukhothai were the object of a war between Ayutthaya and the Northern Thai kingdom of Lan Na. In 1462 the city-state of Sukhothai rebelled against Ayutthaya and allied itself with its enemy, Lan Na. During this time, Phitsanulok served as the \\"second capital\\" of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, and in 1463 king Borommatrailokanat even moved his residence there, presumably to be closer to the frontline. Contemporary Portuguese traders described Ayutthaya and Phitsanulok as \\"twin states\\". Northern nobles descending from old Sukhothai's elite often played the role of kingmakers in Ayutthaya succession conflicts. In 1569 Mahathammaracha, then governor of Phitsanulok and viceroy of the Northern cities, who claimed to descend from the old Sukhothai dynasty, ascended the Ayutthayan throne. After the Battle of Sittaung River in 1583, Naresuan, then uparaja (viceroy) of Ayutthaya and ruler of Phitsanulok, forcibly relocated people from the northern cities of Phitsanulok, Sukhothai, Phichai, Sawankhalok (Si Satchanalai), Kamphaeng Phet, Phichit, and Prabang to the region surrounding Ayutthaya. Kings  Historiography  Sukhothai royal temple, replica in Muang Boran The story of Sukhothai was incorporated into Thailand's \\"national history\\" in the late 19th century by King Mongkut, Rama IV, as a historical work presented to the British diplomatic mission. King Mongkut is considered the champion of Sukhothai narrative history based on his finding the Number One Stone Inscription, the 'first evidence' telling the history of Sukhothai. From then on, as a part of modern nation building process, modern national Siamese or Thai history comprises the history of Sukhothai. Sukhothai was said to be the 'first national capital', followed by Ayutthaya, Thonburi until Rattanakosin or today Bangkok. Sukhothai history was crucial among Siam/ Thailand's 'modernists', both 'conservative' and 'revolutionary'. Rama IV (King Mongkut) said that he found 'the first Stone Inscription' in Sukhothai, telling story of Sukhothai's origin, heroic kings such as Ram Khamhaeng, administrative system and other developments, considered as the 'prosperous time' of the kingdom. Sukhothai history became important even after the Revolution of 1932. Researches and writings on Sukhothai history were abundant. Details derived from the inscription were studied and 'theorised'.\\"Epigraphical and historical studies, nos. 1-24 published in the Journal of the Siam Society from 1968-1979\\"--Pref. Includes bibliographical references. Subjects: Inscriptions, Thai. Notes: English and Thai; some Pali (in roman). One of the most well-known topics was Sukhothai's 'democracy' rule. Story of the close relationship between king and his people, vividly described as 'father-son' relationship, the 'seed' of Thai Democracy. However the change in ruling style took place when later society embraced 'foreign' tradition, Khmer's Angkor tradition, influenced by Hinduism and 'mystic' Mahayana Buddhism. The story of Sukhothai became the model of 'freedom'. Jit Bhumisak, a 'revolutionary' scholar, also saw Sukhothai period as the beginning of the Thai people's liberation movement from their foreign ruler, Angkor. During military rule, from the 1950s, Sukhothai was placed in Thai national curriculum. Sukhothai became model of 'father-son' rule, described as 'Thai Democracy', free from 'foreign ideology'; Angkorian tradition compared to communism. Other Sukhothai aspects were investigated seriously, such as commoner and slave status, and economic situation. These topics, said, were on stage of ideological thoughts fighting during the Cold War and civil insurgency times in 1960-1970s.

Biography =Early life= He was born at Sompuis, near Vitry-le-Fran√ßois (in modern-day Marne), the son of Anthony Royer, a small businessman. His mother, Ang√©lique Perp√©tue Collard, had a reputation for strong character and great piety. His younger brother, Antoine- Athanase Royer-Collard, was a physician and pioneer in the field of psychiatry, at one point serving as chief physician at Charenton Asylum. Royer-Collard was sent at 12 to the college of Chaumont of which his uncle, Father Paul Collard, was director. He subsequently followed his uncle to Saint-Omer, where he studied mathematics. =Career= At the outbreak of the French Revolution, to which he was passionately sympathetic, he was practising at the Parisian bar. He was returned by his section, the Island of Saint- Louis, to the Commune, of which he was secretary from 1790 to 1792. After the revolution of 10 August in that year he was replaced by Jean-Lambert Tallien. His sympathies were now with the Gironde, and after the insurrection of the 12th Prairial (31 May 1793) his life was in danger. He returned to Sompuis, and was saved from arrest possibly by the protection of Georges Danton and in some degree by his mother's influence on the local commissary of the Convention. In 1797 he was returned by his d√©partment (Marne) to the Council of the Five Hundred, where he allied himself especially with Camille Jordan. He made a well-regarded speech in the council in defence of the principles of religious liberty, but the coup d'√©tat of Fructidor (4 September 1797) drove him back into private life. It was at this period that he developed his legitimist opinions and entered into communication with the comte de Provence (later Louis XVIII of France). He was the ruling spirit in the small committee formed in Paris to help forward a Restoration independent of the comte d'Artois and his party; but with the establishment of the Consulate he saw the prospects of the monarchy were temporarily hopeless, and the members of the committee resigned. From that time until the Restoration Royer-Collard devoted himself exclusively to the study of philosophy. He derived his opposition to the philosophy of √âtienne Bonnot de Condillac chiefly from the study of Ren√© Descartes and his followers, and from his early veneration for the fathers of Port-Royal. He was occupied with developing a system to provide a moral and political education consonant with his view of the needs of France. From 1811 to 1814 he lectured at the Sorbonne. From this time dates his long association with Fran√ßois Guizot. Royer-Collard himself was supervisor of the press under the first restoration. From 1815 onwards he sat as deputy for Marne in the chamber. As president of the commission of public instruction from 1815 to 1820 he checked the pretensions of the clerical party, the immediate cause of his retirement being an attempt to infringe the rights of the University of Paris by awarding diplomas, independent of university examinations, to the teaching fraternity of the Christian Brothers. Royer-Collard's acceptance of the legitimist principle did not prevent a faithful adhesion to the social revolution effected in 1789, and he protested in 1815, in 1820, and again under the monarchy of July against laws of exception. He was the moving spirit of the \\"Doctrinaires\\", as they were called, who met at the house of the comte de Ste Aulaire and in the salon of Madame de Sta√´l's daughter, the duchesse de Broglie. The leaders of the party, beside Royer-Collard, were Guizot, PFH de Serre, Camille Jordan and Charles de R√©musat. In 1820 Royer-Collard was excluded from the council of state by a decree signed by his former ally Serre. In 1827 he was elected for seven constituencies, but remained faithful to his native department. Next year he became president of the chamber, and fought against the reactionary policy which precipitated the Revolution of July. It was Royer-Collard who in March 1830 presented the address of the 221. From that time he took no active part in politics, although he retained his seat in the chamber until 1839. Whilst during the first half of the nineteenth century the word \\"liberal\\" was generally synonymous with Voltaireanism and hostility to the Jesuits, certain speeches of Royer-Collard quoted by Barante show that he professed a deferential attachment for the Church. \\"If Christianity\\", he wrote, \\"has been a degradation, a corruption, Voltaire in attacking it has been a benefactor of the human race; but if the contrary be true, then the passing of Voltaire over the Christian earth has been a great calamity.\\" In a letter to P√®re de Ravignan he comments upon the institution of the Jesuits as a \\"wonderful creation\\".Herbermann, et.al., pg. 214 =Personal life= Royer-Collard married Augustine Marie Rosalie de Forges de Ch√£taeubrun on 20 October 1800. They had four children, two of whom predeceased them. He died at his estate of Ch√¢teauvieux in the Berry, south of Blois. Further reading *Prosper de Barante. (1861) Vie politique de M.

They are related to the laika, a spitz-type dog. It takes its name from the Samoyedic peoples of Siberia. These nomadic reindeer herders bred the fluffy white dogs to help with herding.  History  Samoyed, circa 1915 The Samoyed has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th Century. It belongs to the spitz or northern dog group, specifically the laikas, a Eurasian dog type used for a variety of purposes, namely hunting, herding, guarding, and sledding. The Samoyed is descended from the Nenets herding laika, a dog that may not only be white, but also a wide variety of colors. Like many breeds, the Samoyed was bred from a small number of founders (in this case, from Siberia). Samoyeds were originally used for hunting, herding reindeer, and hauling sledges for the Samoyede people in Siberia.  Appearance and characteristics  The AKC Standard requires and at the shoulder for males, and and for females. The UK Kennel Club Standard requires for males, and for females. Samoyed eyes are usually black or brown and are almond in shape. Blue or other color eyes can occur but are not allowed in the show ring. It is in the \\"brown and black section\\" in its family, the Spitz family. Samoyed ears are thick and covered with fur, triangular in shape, and erect. They are almost always white but can often have a light to dark brown tint (known as \\"biscuit\\"), usually around the tips of the ears. The Samoyed tail is one of the breed's distinguishing features. Like the Alaskan Malamute, the tail is carried curled over the back; however, unlike the Alaskan Malamute, the Samoyed tail is held actually touching the back. It is not usually held in a tight curl, or held flag-like; it is usually carried lying over the back and to one side. In cold weather, Samoyeds may sleep with their tails over their noses to provide additional warmth. Almost all Samoyeds will allow their tails to fall when they are relaxed and at ease, as when being stroked or while eating, but will return their tails to a curl when more alert. Samoyeds have a dense, double layer coat. The topcoat contains long, coarse, and straight guard hairs, which appear white but have a hint of silver coloring. This top layer keeps the undercoat relatively clean and free of debris. The under layer, or undercoat, consists of a dense, soft, and short fur that keeps the dog warm. The undercoat typically sheds heavily once or twice a year, and this seasonal process is sometimes referred to as \\"blowing coat\\". This does not mean the Samoyed will shed only during that time however; fine hairs (versus the dense clumps shed during seasonal shedding) will be shed all year round, and have a tendency to stick to cloth and float in the air. The standard Samoyed may come in a mixture of biscuit and white coloring, although pure white and all biscuit dogs are common. Males typically have larger ruffs than females. While this breed is touted as \\"hypoallergenic\\", it does shed a fair amount and needs frequent grooming. While the breed may produce fewer allergens, care should be taken for severe allergies. Shed Samoyed fur is sometimes used as an alternative to wool in knitting, with a texture similar to angora. The fur is sometimes also used for the creation of artificial flies for fly fishing. Life expectancy for the breed is about 12‚Äì13 years.

The breed is characterized by an alert and happy expression which has earned the nicknames \\"Sammie smile\\" and \\"smiley dog.\\" With their tendency to bark, however, they can be diligent watch dogs, barking whenever something approaches their territory. Samoyeds are excellent companions, especially for small children or even other dogs, and they remain playful into old age. According to the Samoyed Club of America, when Samoyeds become bored, they may become destructive or start to dig. With their sled dog heritage, a Samoyed is not averse to pulling things, and an untrained Samoyed has no problem pulling its owner on a leash rather than walking alongside. Samoyeds were also used to herd reindeer.  Activities  Samoyeds can compete in dog agility trials, carting, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, mushing and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Samoyeds exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.  Health  = Samoyed hereditary glomerulopathy = The breed can be affected by a genetic disease known as Samoyed hereditary glomerulopathy, a kidney disease. The disease is known to be caused by an X-linked dominant faulty allele and therefore the disease is more severe in male Samoyeds. Also known as hereditary nephritis, it is caused by a nonsense mutation in codon 1027 of the COL4A5 gene on the X chromosome (glycine to stop codon), which is similar to Alport's syndrome in humans. Carrier females do develop mild symptoms after 2‚Äì3 months of age, but mostly do not go on to develop kidney failure. The disease is caused by a defect in the structure of the type-IV collagen fibrils of the glomerular basement membrane. As a consequence, the collagen fibrils of the glomerular basement membrane are unable to form cross-links, so the structural integrity is weakened and the membrane is more susceptible to \\"wear-and-tear\\" damage. As the structure of the basement membrane begins to degenerate, plasma proteins are lost in the urine and symptoms begin to appear. Affected males appear healthy for the first three months of life, but then symptoms start to appear and worsen as the disease progresses: the dog becomes lethargic and muscle wastage occurs, as a result of proteinuria. From three months of age onwards, a reduced glomerular filtration rate is detected, indicative of progressive kidney failure. Clinically, proteinuria is found in both sexes from the age of three to four months; in dogs older than this, kidney failure in combination with more or less pronounced hearing loss occurs swiftly and death at the age of 8 to 15 months is expected. In heterozygous females, the disease develops slowly. The disease can be treated to slow down the development by use of cyclosporine A and ACE inhibitors, but not be stopped. If a carrier female is mated with a healthy stud dog, the female offspring have a 50% chance of being carriers for the disease, and any male offspring have a 50% chance of being affected by the disease. A genetic test is available for this disease. = Other health concerns = For the Samoyeds several breed-specific hereditary diseases are described in the veterinary literature: * Diabetes mellitus similar but not identical to human Type I (insulin deficiency): The disease occurs in middle-aged Samoyeds, the mean age at diagnosis is seven years. The cause is a chronic inflammation of the pancreas and/or autoimmune destruction of beta cells of islets of Langerhans. Moreover, in affected dogs autoantibodies were found to insulin. Currently, several genetic markers are discussed as possible causes. * Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) caused by a frameshift mutation in the RPRG locus of the X chromosome. The disease leads to a slowly progressive loss of vision, which eventually leads to blindness. The first symptoms appear between two and five years of age. The disease corresponds to the X-linked PRA type 3 in humans. * Short legs in conjunction with eye abnormalities: Due to a genetic defect at the COL2A1 locus occurs on disproportionate dwarfism with short limbs in connection with cataracts, malformations of the retina and / or retinal detachment, liquefaction of the vitreous and a persistent hyaloid artery. The malformations of the retina are dominant (i.e. before coming in heterozygous dogs); the other symptoms are recessive, so they only come to expression in homozygous affected dogs. A connection with Opticin is not. * Pulmonary stenosis occurs more frequently in Samoyeds in comparison with other breeds. The disease can cause shortness of breath, cardiac arrhythmias and tiring on motion and increases the risk of congestive heart failure. * Hip dysplasia is also a concern for Samoyeds. * The breed can also be affected by sebaceous adenitis, an uncommon idiopathic autoimmune skin disease.

It is generally accepted that the name derives from Amerigo Vespucci, the Italian explorer, who explored the new continents in the following years. However, some have suggested other explanations, including being named before a mountain range in Nicaragua, or after Richard Amerike of Bristol. Usage In modern English, North and South America are generally considered separate continents, and taken together are called the Americas in the plural, parallel to similar situations such as the Carolinas and the Dakotas. When conceived as a unitary continent, the form is generally the continent of America in the singular. However, without a clarifying context, singular America in English commonly refers to the United States of America.\\"America.\\" The Oxford Companion to the English Language (). McArthur, Tom, ed., 1992. New York: Oxford University Press, p. 33: \\"[16c: from the feminine of Americus, the Latinized first name of the explorer Amerigo Vespucci (1454‚Äì1512). The name America first appeared on a map in 1507 by the German cartographer Martin Waldseem√ºller, referring to the area now called Brazil]. Since the 16c, a name of the western hemisphere, often in the plural Americas and more or less synonymous with the New World. Since the 18c, a name of the United States of America. The second sense is now primary in English ... However, the term is open to uncertainties.\\" Historically, in the English-speaking world, the term America used to refer to a single continent until the 1950s (as in Van Loon's Geography of 1937): According to historians K√§ren Wigen and Martin W. Lewis, This shift did not seem to happen in most other cultural hemispheres on Earth, such as Romance-speaking (including France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Romania, Switzerland, and the postcolonial Romance-speaking countries of Latin America and Africa), Germanic (but excluding English) speaking (including Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Icelands, Faroe Islands), Baltic-Slavic languages (including Czechia, Slovakia, Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Russia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria) and in many other hemispheres, where America is still considered a continent encompassing the North America and South America subcontinents, as well as Central America. \\"In Europe and other parts of the world, many students are taught of six continents, where North and South America are combined to form a single continent of America. Thus, these six continents are Africa, America, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, and Europe.\\" \\"six-continent model (used mostly in France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Romania, Greece, and Latin America) groups together North America+South America into the single continent America.\\" Earliest use of name Waldseem√ºller (Germany, 1507), which first used the name America (in the lower-left section, over South America) The earliest known use of the name America dates to April 25, 1507, when it was applied to what is now known as South America. It appears on a small globe map with twelve time zones, together with the largest wall map made to date, both created by the German cartographer Martin Waldseem√ºller in Saint-Di√©-des- Vosges in France. These were the first maps to show the Americas as a land mass separate from Asia. An accompanying book, Cosmographiae Introductio, anonymous but apparently written by Waldseem√ºller's collaborator Matthias Ringmann, states, \\"I do not see what right any one would have to object to calling this part [that is, the South American mainland], after Americus who discovered it and who is a man of intelligence, Amerigen, that is, the Land of Americus, or America: since both Europa and Asia got their names from women\\". America is also inscribed on the Paris Green Globe (or Globe vert) which has been attributed to Waldseem√ºller and dated to 1506‚Äì07: as well as the single name inscribed on the northern and southern parts of the New World, the continent also bears the inscription: America ab inuentore nuncupata (America, named after its discoverer).Monique Pelletier, \\"Le Globe vert et l'oeuvre cosmographique du Gymnase Vosgien‚Äù, Bulletin du Comit√© fran√ßais de cartographie, 163, 2000, pp. 17-31.

Globe vert America America ab inventore nuncupata (America, called after its discoverer) on the Globe vert, c.1507. Amerigo Vespucci Americus Vesputius was the Latinized version of the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci's name, the forename being an old Italianization (compare modern Italian Enrico) of Medieval Latin Emericus (see Saint Emeric of Hungary), from the Old High German name Emmerich, which may have been a merger of several Germanic names ‚Äì Amalric, Ermanaric and Old High German Haimirich, from Proto-Germanic *amala- ('vigor, bravery'), *ermuna- ('great; whole') or *haima- ('home') + *rƒ´k- ('ruler') (compare *Haimarƒ´ks). Amerigo Vespucci (March 9, 1454February 22, 1512) was an Italian explorer, financier, navigator and cartographer who first postulated that the West Indies and corresponding mainland were not part of Asia's eastern outskirts as initially conjectured from Columbus's voyages, but instead constituted an entirely separate landmass hitherto unknown to the Europeans.Davidson, M. H. (1997). Columbus Then and Now: A Life Re-examined. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, p. 417.Szalay, Jessie. Amerigo Vespuggi: Facts, Biography & Naming of America (citing Erika Cosme of Mariners Museum & Park, Newport News VA). 20 September 2017 (accessed 23 June 2019) Vespucci was apparently unaware of the use of his name to refer to the new landmass, as Waldseem√ºller's maps did not reach Spain until a few years after his death. Ringmann may have been misled into crediting Vespucci by the widely published Soderini Letter, a sensationalized version of one of Vespucci's actual letters reporting on the mapping of the South American coast, which glamorized his discoveries and implied that he had recognized that South America was a continent separate from Asia. Spain officially refused to accept the name America for two centuries, saying that Columbus should get credit, and Waldseem√ºller's later maps, after Ringmann's death, did not include it; however, usage was established when Gerardus Mercator applied the name to the entire New World in his 1538 world map. Acceptance may have been aided by the \\"natural poetic counterpart\\" that the name America made with Asia, Africa, and Europa. Named after a Nicaraguan mountain range In 1874, Thomas Belt proposed that the name derives from the Amerrisque Mountains of present-day Nicaragua. In 1875, Jules Marcou suggested a derivation from indigenous American languages where \\"Amerrique\\" originally named the prominent mountain range. Marcou corresponded with Augustus Le Plongeon, who wrote: \\"The name AMERICA or AMERRIQUE in the Mayan language means, a country of perpetually strong wind, or the Land of the Wind, and ... the [suffixes] can mean ... a spirit that breathes, life itself.\\" In this view, native speakers shared this indigenous word with Columbus and members of his crew, and Columbus made landfall in the vicinity of these mountains on his fourth voyage. The name America then spread via oral means throughout Europe relatively quickly even reaching the cartographer Waldseem√ºller who was preparing a map of newly reported lands for publication in 1507. Waldseem√ºller's work in the area of denomination takes on a different aspect in this view: > The baptismal passage in the Cosmographiae Introductio has commonly been > read as argument, in which the author said that he was naming the newly > discovered continent in honor of Vespucci and saw no reason for objections. > But, as etymologist Joy Rea has suggested, it could also be read as an > explanation, in which he indicates that he has heard the New World was > called America, and the only explanation lay in Vespucci's name. Among the reasons which proponents give in adopting this theory include the recognition of ‚Äúthe simple fact that place names usually originate informally in the spoken word and first circulate that way, not in the printed word.‚Äù In addition, Waldseem√ºller not only is exonerated from the charge of having arrogated to himself the privilege of naming lands, which privilege was reserved to monarchs and actual explorers, but also is freed from the charge of violating the long-established and virtually inviolable ancient European tradition of using only the first name of royal individuals as opposed to the last name of commoners (such as Vespucci) in bestowing names to lands. Richard Amerike Bristol antiquarian Alfred Hudd suggested in 1908 that the name was derived from the surname \\"Amerike\\" or \\"ap Meryk\\" and was used on early British maps that have since been lost. Richard ap Meryk, anglicised to Richard Amerike (or Ameryk) ( 1445‚Äì1503) was a wealthy Anglo-Welsh merchant, royal customs officer and sheriff of Bristol. According to some historians, he was the principal owner of the Matthew, the ship sailed by John Cabot during his voyage of exploration to North America in 1497. The idea that Richard Amerike was a 'principal supporter' of Cabot has gained popular currency in the 21st century. There is no known evidence to support this. Similarly, and contrary to a recent tradition that names Amerike as principal owner and main funder of the Matthew, Cabot's ship of 1497, academic enquiry does not connect Amerike with the ship. Her ownership at that date remains uncertain.Evan T. Jones, \\"The Matthew of Bristol and the financiers of John Cabot's 1497 voyage to North America\\", English Historical Review (2006) Macdonald asserts that the caravel was specifically built for the Atlantic crossing. Hudd proposed his theory in a paper which was read at the 21 May 1908 meeting of the Clifton Antiquarian Club, and which appeared in Volume 7 of the club's Proceedings. In \\"Richard Ameryk and the name America,\\" Hudd discussed the 1497 discovery of North America by John Cabot, an Italian who had sailed on behalf of England. Upon his return to England after his first (1497) and second (1498‚Äì1499) voyages, Cabot received two pension payments from Henry VII. Of the two customs officials at the Port of Bristol who were responsible for delivering the money to Cabot, the more senior was Richard Ameryk (High Sheriff of Bristol in 1503). Hudd postulated that Cabot named the land that he had discovered after Ameryk, from whom he received the pension conferred by the king. He stated that Cabot had a reputation for being free with gifts to his friends, such that his expression of gratitude to the official would not be unexpected. Hudd also thought it unlikely that America would have been named after Vespucci's given name rather than his family name. Hudd used a quote from a late 15th-century manuscript (a calendar of Bristol events), the original of which had been lost in an 1860 Bristol fire, that indicated the name America was already known in Bristol in 1497. Hudd reasoned that the scholars of the 1507 Cosmographiae Introductio, unfamiliar with Richard Ameryk, assumed that the name America, which he claimed had been in use for ten years, was based on Amerigo Vespucci and, therefore, mistakenly transferred the honour from Ameryk to Vespucci. While Hudd's speculation has found support from some authors, there is no strong evidence to substantiate his theory that Cabot named America after Richard Ameryk. Moreover, because Amerike's coat of arms was similar to the flag later adopted by the independent United States, a legend grew that the North American continent had been named for him rather than for Amerigo Vespucci. It is not widely accepted - the origin is usually attributed to the jack of the British East India Company. Native naming of the continent In 1977, the World Council of Indigenous Peoples (Consejo Mundial de Pueblos Ind√≠genas) proposed using the term Abya Yala instead of \\"America\\" when referring to the continent. There are also names in other indigenous languages such as Ixachilan and Runa Pacha. Some scholars have picked up the term with a reference to the illegitimacy of colonialism.

He considered himself a \\"Swedenborg of history\\" who sought to update the philosophy of Kantian liberalism and individualism for the socio- economic realities of the late nineteenth century, and influenced the sociological method of √âmile Durkheim. Biography Renouvier was born in Montpellier and educated in Paris at the √âcole Polytechnique. He took an early interest in politics, but never held public office, spending his time writing, away from public scrutiny. Philosophy Renouvier was the first French philosopher after Nicolas Malebranche to formulate a complete idealistic system, and had a vast influence on the development of French thought. His system is based on Immanuel Kant's,Kant, Philosophy of, The Catholic Encyclopedia as his chosen term \\"n√©o-criticisme\\" indicates; but it is a transformation rather than a continuation of Kantianism. The two leading ideas are the dislike of the \\"unknowable\\" in all its forms, and a reliance on the validity of personal experience. The former accounts for Renouvier's acceptance of Kant's phenomenalism, combined with rejection of the thing-in- itself. It accounts, too, for his polemic on the one hand against a Substantial Soul, a Buddhistic Absolute, an Infinite Spiritual Substance; on the other hand against the no less mysterious material or dynamic substratum by which naturalistic Monism explains the world. He maintains that nothing exists except presentations, which are not merely sensational, and have an objective aspect no less than a subjective. To explain the formal organization of our experience, Renouvier adopts a modified version of the Kantian categories. The insistence on the validity of personal experience leads Renouvier to a yet more important divergence from Kant in his treatment of volition. Liberty, he says, in a much wider sense than Kant, is man's fundamental characteristic. Human freedom acts in the phenomenal, not in an imaginary noumenal sphere. Belief is not merely intellectual, but is determined by an act of will affirming what we hold to be morally good. In his religious views, Renouvier makes a considerable approximation to Gottfried Leibniz. He holds that we are rationally justified in affirming human immortality and the existence of a finite God who is to be a constitutional ruler, but not a despot, over the souls of people. He nevertheless regards atheism as preferable to a belief in an infinite Deity. Renouvier's dislike of the unknowable also led him to take up arms against the notion of an actual infinite. He believed that an infinite sum must be a name for something incomplete. If one begins to count, \\"one, two, three ...\\" there never comes a time when one is entitled to shout \\"infinity\\"! Infinity is a project, never a fact, in the neocritical view. Renouvier became an important influence upon the thought of American psychologist and philosopher William James. James wrote that \\"but for the decisive impression made on me in the 1870s by his masterly advocacy of pluralism, I might never have got free from the monistic superstition under which I had grown up.\\" Works * Essais de critique g√©n√©rale (1854‚Äì64) * Science de la morale (1869) * Uchronie (1876) * Comment je suis arriv√© √† cette conclusion (1885) * Esquisse d'une classification syst√©matique des doctrines philosophiques (1885‚Äì86) * Philosophie analytique de l'histoire (1896‚Äì97) * La Nouvelle Monadologie (1899) * Histoire et solution des probl√®mes m√©taphysiques (1901) * Victor Hugo: Le Po√®te (1893) * Victor Hugo: Le Philosophe (1900) * Les Dilemmes de la m√©taphysique pure (1901) * Le Personnalisme (1903) * Critique de la doctrine de Kant (1906) See also * Neo-Kantianism Notes  Further reading  * Emmanuel Carr√®re: Le D√©troit de Behring.

He was a pioneer in the field of high- pressure industrial chemistry and founder of IG Farben, at one point the world's largest chemical company. Biography =Early years= Carl Bosch was born in Cologne, Germany to a successful gas and plumbing supplier. His father was Carl Friedrich Alexander Bosch (1843‚Äì1904) and his uncle was Robert Bosch, who pioneered the development of the spark plug and founded the multinational company Bosch. Carl, trying to decide between a career in metallurgy or chemistry, studied at the K√∂niglich Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg (now the Technical University of Berlin) and the University of Leipzig from 1892‚Äì1898. =Career= Painting by Hermann Groeber: Der Aufsichtsrat der 1925 gegr√ºndeten I.G. Farben AG, Carl Bosch and Carl Duisberg (in front sitting), Edmund ter Meer (third person from right with newspaper) Carl Bosch attended the University of Leipzig, and this is where he studied under Johannes Wislicenus, and he obtained his doctorate in 1898 for research in organic chemistry. After he left in 1899 he took an entry-level job at BASF, then Germany's largest chemical and dye firm. From 1909 until 1913 he transformed Fritz Haber's tabletop demonstration of a method to fix nitrogen using high pressure chemistry through the Haber‚ÄìBosch process to produce synthetic nitrate, a process that has countless industrial applications for making a near-infinite variety of industrial compounds, consumer goods, and commercial products. His primary contribution was to expand the scale of the process, enabling the industrial production of vast quantities of synthetic nitrate. To do this, he had to construct a plant and equipment that would function effectively under high gas pressures and high temperatures. Bosch was also responsible for finding a more practical catalyst than the osmium and uranium being used by Haber. As Osmium was a very limited resource, and uranium very expensive. There were many more obstacles as well, such as designing large compressors and safe high-pressure furnaces. A means was needed to provide pure hydrogen gas in quantity as the feedstock. Also, cheap and safe means had to be developed to clean and process the product ammonia. The first full-scale Haber-Bosch plant was erected in Oppau, Germany, now part of Ludwigshafen. With the process complete he was able to synthesize large amounts of ammonia, which was available for the industrial and agricultural fields. In fact, this production has increased the agricultural yields throughout the world. This work won him the Nobel prize for Chemistry in 1931. After World War I Bosch extended high-pressure techniques to the production of synthetic fuel via the Bergius process and methanol. In 1925 Bosch helped found IG Farben, and was the first head of the company. From 1935, Bosch was chairman of the board of directors. He received the Siemens-Ring in 1924 for his contributions to applied research and his support of basic research. In 1931 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry together with Friedrich Bergius for the introduction of high pressure chemistry. Today the Haber‚ÄìBosch process produces 100 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer every year. Personal life Bosch's grave in Heidelberg Bosch married Else Schilback in 1902. Carl and Else had a son and a daughter together. Bosch, a critic of many Nazi policies, was gradually relieved of his high positions after Hitler became chancellor, and fell into depression and alcoholism. He died in Heidelberg. Legacy The Haber‚ÄìBosch Process today consumes more than one percent of humanity's energy production and is responsible for feeding roughly one-third of its population. On average, one- half of the nitrogen in a human body comes from synthetically fixed sources, the product of a Haber‚ÄìBosch plant. Bosch was an ardent collector of insects, minerals, and gems. His collected meteorites and other mineral samples were loaned to Yale University, and eventually purchased by the Smithsonian. He was an amateur astronomer with a well-equipped private observatory. The asteroid 7414 Bosch was named in his honour. Carl Bosch along with Fritz Haber were voted the world's most influential chemical engineers of all time by members of the Institution of Chemical Engineers. The Haber-Bosch process, quite possibly the best-known chemical process in the world, which captures nitrogen from the air and converts it to ammonia, has its hand in the process of the Green Revolution that has been feeding the increasing population of the world. Bosch also won numerous awards including an honorary doctorate from Hochschule Karlsruhe (1918), the Liebig Memorial Medal of the Association of German Chemists along with the Bunsen Medal of the German Bunsen Society, the Siemens Ring, and the Golden Grashof Memorial medal of the VDI. In 1931 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for the contribution to the invention of chemical high pressure methods. He also received the Exner medal from the Austrian Trade Association and the Carl Lueg Memorial Medal. Bosch also enjoyed his membership of various German and foreign scientific academics, and his chairmanship of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society of which he became the President in 1937.

She was the daughter of Christian I, King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, and Dorothea of Brandenburg. Life Margaret was born in Denmark to King Christian I and Queen Dorothea of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Not much is known about Margaret's upbringing. By the time she was four years old there were talks about her marriage to the Scottish Prince James. In 1468 Margaret was betrothed to James of Scotland as a means to stop a feud regarding the debt Scotland owed Denmark over the taxation of the Hebrides and Isle of Man. The marriage was arranged on the recommendation of king Charles VII of France. In July 1469, at the age of 13 she married James III at Holyrood Abbey. Upon their marriage all of the Scottish debt was cancelled. William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness, was at that time the Norse Earl of Orkney. In 1472 he was made to exchange his Orkney fief for Ravenscraig Castle, so the Scottish throne took the earl's rights to the islands too. Queen Margaret was given the largest jointure allowed by Scottish law in her marriage settlement. She was interested in clothes and jewellery, and known for always being dressed in the latest fashions of the time.Elizabeth Ewan, Sue Innes and Sian Reynolds, The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women: From Earliest Times to 2004 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006). . She may have taught her son James to speak Danish. She became a popular queen in Scotland and was described as beautiful, gentle, and sensible. Many years later historians called her far better qualified to rule than her spouse. The relationship between Margaret and James III was not described as a happy one. Reportedly, she was not very fond of her husband and had intercourse with him only for procreation, though she did respect his position as a monarch. One reason for their estrangement was the fact that James favoured their second son over their eldest. In 1476, James had decided that he wanted the Earldom of Ross for his second son and accused John MacDonald, the Earl, of treason. Macdonald was then put on trial before the Parliament, but upon Margaret's request he was allowed to remain as Lord of Parliament. During the crisis of 1482, when James III was deprived of power by his brother for several months, Margaret was said to have shown more interest in the welfare of her children than her spouse, which led to a permanent estrangement. Politically, she worked for the reinstatement of her spouse in his powers as monarch during this incident. After the crisis of 1482, the couple lived apart: James III lived in Edinburgh, while queen Margaret preferred to live in Stirling with her children.  Death  Margaret died at Stirling Castle on 14 July 1486 after falling ill, and was buried in Cambuskenneth Abbey. Her husband, James III, was interred with her after his death in 1488. The abbey has mostly been reduced to ruins, apart from its bell-tower, which is still standing today. The grave was enclosed and restored in 1865 at the expense of Margaret's descendant, Queen Victoria.Grave inscription of King James III A story given by her son claims that Margaret was killed by poison given to her by John Ramsay, 1st Lord Bothwell, leader of one of the political factions. However, as Ramsay was favoured by the royal family also after the death of the queen, this is considered doubtful and may have been slander, although he did have some knowledge of poisons. Reportedly, James III mourned her death, and sent a supplication to the Pope where he applied for her to be declared a saint.

According to the latest census in 2010, there were 44,857 Nenets in the Russian Federation, most of them living in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Nenets Autonomous Okrug and Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District stretching along the coastline of the Arctic Ocean near the so called Arctic Circle between Kola and Taymyr peninsulas. The Nenets people speak either the Tundra or Forest Nenets languages, which are mutually unintelligible. In the Russian Federation they have a status of indigenous small-numbered peoples.Small(-numbered) peoples of the North and the Far East (–ú–ê–õ–´–ï –ù–ê–†–û–î–´ –°–ï–í–ï–†–ê –ò –î–ê–õ–¨–ù–ï–ì–û –í–û–°–¢–û–ö–ê). Multinational Petersburg. 18 July 2015  Name  The literal morphs samo and yed in Russian convey the meaning \\"self-eater\\", which is considered derogatory. Therefore, the name Samoyed quickly went out of usage in the 20th century. The people are known as the Nenets, which means \\"man\\". In old Russian documents the term Samoyed was often applied indiscriminately to different peoples of Northern Russia who speak related Uralic languages: Nenets, Nganasans, Enets, Selkups (speakers of Samoyedic languages). Currently, the term \\"Samoyedic peoples\\" applies to the whole group of these different peoples. It is the general term that includes the Nenets, Enets, Selkup, and Nganasan peoples.  Language  The Nenets language is on the Samoyedic branch of the Uralic language family, with two major dialects, Forest Nenets and Tundra Nenets. Ethnologue says that in Siberia, most young people are still fluent in Nenets, whereas in European Russia, they tend to speak Russian. Overall, the majority of native speakers are from older generations. UNESCO classifies Nenets as an endangered language. Some believe that the use of Russian and Komi is due to inter-ethnic marriages.  History and way of life  Nenets man, c. 1862 A group of Nenets in Dudinka Russian‚ÄìNenets family (photo uploaded in 2006) There are two distinct groups of Nenets sensu stricto, based on their economy: the Tundra Nenets (living far to the north) and the Khandeyar or Forest Nenets. A distinct third group of Nenets (Yaran people) has emerged as a result of intermarriages between Nenets and Izhma Komi people. The Samoyedic languages form a branch of the Uralic language family. They moved from farther south in Siberia to the northernmost part of what later became Russia sometime before the 12th century. They ended up between the Kanin and Taymyr peninsulas, around the Ob and Yenisey rivers, with only a few of them settling into small communities like Kolva. Their main subsistence comes from hunting and reindeer herding. Using reindeer as a draft animal throughout the year enables them to cover great distances. Large-scale reindeer herding emerged in the 18th century. They bred the Samoyed dog to help herd their reindeer and pull their sleds, and European explorers later used these dogs for polar expeditions, because they were well adapted to the arctic conditions. Tundra wolves can cause considerable economic loss, as they prey on the reindeer herds which are the livelihood of some Nenets families.Heptner, V. G. & Naumov, N., P. (editors) Mammals of the Soviet Union Vol.II Part 1a, SIRENIA AND CARNIVORA (Sea cows; Wolves and Bears), Science Publishers, Inc. USA. 1998. Along with reindeer meat, fish is a major component in the Nenets' diet. Nenets housing is conical yurt (mya). They have a shamanistic and animistic belief system which stresses respect for the land and its resources. During migrations, the Nenets placed sacred items like bear skins, religious figures, coins and more on a holy sleigh. The contents of this sacred sleigh are only unpacked during special occasions or for religious rituals (like sacrifices). However, only esteemed elders are allowed to unpack the sacred sleigh. They had a clan-based social structure. The Nenets shaman is called a Tadibya. After the Russian Revolution, their culture suffered due to the Soviet collectivisation policy. The government of the Soviet Union tried to force the nomadic Samoyeds to settle down permanently. They were forced to settle in villages and their children were educated in state boarding schools, which resulted in erosion of their cultural identity. Many, especially in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug lost their mother tongue and became assimilated. Since the 1930s, a few Nenets have expressed themselves professionally through cultural media. For instance, Tyko Vylka and Konstantin Pankov became well-known painters. Anna Nerkagi is one of the most celebrated Nenets writers. Yuri Vella, though living as a reindeer herder, has become the first writer in the Forest Nenets language. Environment Environmental damage to the Nenets' boots is significant due to industrialisation of their land, colonization and climate change. Because of the expansive gas and oil industry, reindeer pastures are shrinking, and some regions, such as the Yamal Peninsula are overgrazed, further endangering the Nenets way of life. The effects of global warming and climate change on nomadic Nenets reindeer herders have been documented, as certain lands they need to cross to follow migration patterns are only accessible during winter. Earlier spring melts compounded by delayed autumn freeze, affect the ability of reindeer and herders to traverse the frozen tundra. Arkhangelsk-based Leonid Zubov has documented how this restricts Nenets people's access to medical facilities, causing them to wait until the next snow season for medical attention.Berg- Nordlie, Mikkel: Upcoming Deluge or False Prophecy?

Biography Simon was born at Lorient. His father was a linen-draper from Lorraine, who renounced Protestantism before his second marriage with a Catholic Breton. Jules Simon was the son of this second marriage. The family name was Suisse, which Simon dropped in favour of his third forename. By considerable sacrifice he was enabled to attend a seminary at Vannes, and worked briefly as usher in a school before, in 1833, he became a student at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris. There he came in contact with Victor Cousin, who sent him to Caen and then to Versailles to teach philosophy. He helped Cousin, without receiving any recognition, in his translations from Plato and Aristotle, and in 1839 became his deputy in the chair of philosophy at the University of Paris, with the meagre salary of 83 francs per month. He also lectured on the history of philosophy at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure. At this period he edited the works of Nicolas Malebranche (2 vols, 1842), of Ren√© Descartes (1842), Bossuet (1842) and of Antoine Arnauld (1843), and in 1844‚Äì1845 appeared the two volumes of his Histoire de l'√©cole d'Alexandrie. He became a regular contributor to the Revue des deux mondes, and in 1847, with Am√©d√©e Jacques and √âmile Saisset, founded the Libert√© de penser, with the intention of throwing off the yoke of Cousin, but he retired when Jacques allowed the insertion of an article advocating the principles of collectivism, with which he was at no time in sympathy.  Political career from 1848 to 1871  In 1848 he represented the C√¥tes-du-Nord in the National Assembly, and next year entered the Council of State, but was retired on account of his republican opinions. His refusal to take the oath of allegiance to the government of Louis Napoleon after the coup d'√©tat was followed by his dismissal from his professorship, and he devoted himself to philosophical and political writings of a popular order. Le Devoir (1853), which was translated into modern Greek and Swedish, was followed by La Religion naturelle (1856, Eng. trans., 1887), La Libert√© de conscience (1857), La Libert√© politique (1859), La Libert√© civile (1859), L'Ouvri√®re (1861), L'Ecole (1864), Le Travail (1866), L'Ouvrier de huit ans (1867) and others. In 1863 he was returned to the Corps L√©gislatif for the 8th circonscription of the Seine d√©partement, and supported \\"les Cinq\\" in their opposition to the government. He became minister of instruction in the Government of National Defense on 5 September 1870. After the capitulation of Paris in January 1871 he was sent down to Bordeaux to prevent the resistance of L√©on Gambetta to the peace. But at Bordeaux, Gambetta, who had issued a proclamation excluding from the elections those who had been officials under the Empire, was all-powerful. Pretending to dispute Jules Simon's credentials, he issued orders for his arrest. Meanwhile, Simon had found means of communication with Paris, and on 6 February was reinforced by Eug√®ne Pelletan, E. Arago and Garnier-Pages. Gambetta resigned, and the ministry of the Interior, though nominally given to Arago, was really in Simon's hands.  Third Republic  Defeated in the d√©partement of the Seine, he sat for the Marne in the National Assembly, and resumed the portfolio of Education in the first cabinet of Adolphe Thiers's presidency. He advocated free primary education yet sought to conciliate the clergy by all the means in his power; but no concessions removed the hostility of Dupanloup, who presided over the commission appointed to consider his draft of an elementary education bill. The reforms he was actually able to carry out were concerned with secondary education. He encouraged the study of living languages, and limited the attention given to the making of Latin verse; he also encouraged independent methods at the √âcole Normale, and set up a school at Rome where members of the French school of Athens should spend some time. He retained office until a week before the fall of in 1873. He was regarded by the monarchical right as one of the most dangerous obstacles in the way of a restoration, which he did as much as any man (except perhaps the comte de Chambord himself) to prevent, but by the extreme left he was distrusted for his moderate views, and Gambetta never forgave his victory at Bordeaux. In 1875, he became a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise and a life senator, and in 1876, on the resignation of Jules Dufaure, was summoned to form a cabinet. He replaced anti-republican functionaries in the civil service by republicans, and held his own until 3 May 1877, when he adopted a motion carried by a large majority in the Chamber inviting the cabinet to use all means for the repression of clerical agitation. His clerical enemies then induced Marshal MacMahon to take advantage of a vote on the press law carried in Jules Simon's absence from the Chamber to write him a letter regretting that he no longer preserved his influence in the Chamber, and thus practically demanding his resignation. His resignation in response to this act of the president, known as the \\"Seize Mai\\", which he might have resisted by an appeal to the Chamber, proved his ruin, and he never again held office. He justified his action by his fear of providing an opportunity for a coup d'√©tat on the part of the Marshal. However, the May 1877 crisis eventually ended in MacMahon's demise and in the victory of the Republicans over the monarchist Orleanists and Legitimists. The rejection (1880) of article 7 of Ferry's Education Act, by which the profession of teaching would have been forbidden to members of non- authorized congregations, was due to his intervention. He was in fact one of the chief of the left centre Opportunist Republicans faction, opposed in the same faction to Jules Gr√©vy and also to the Radical Gambetta. He was director of Le Gaulois from 1879 to 1881, and his influence in the country among moderate republicans was retained by his articles in Le Matin from 1882 onwards, in the Journal des D√©bats, which he joined in 1886, and in Le Temps from 1890.  Works  His own accounts of some of the events in which he had been involved appear in Souvenirs du 4 septembre (1874), Le Gouvernement de M. Thiers (2 vols., 1878), in M√©moires des autres (1889), Nouveaux m√©moires des autres (1891) and Les Derniers m√©moires des autres (1897), while his sketch of Victor Cousin (1887) was a further contribution to contemporary history.

He also made notable contributions to the classification of mental disorders and has been described by some as \\"the father of modern psychiatry\\". An 1809 description of a case that Pinel recorded in the second edition of his textbook on insanity is regarded by some as the earliest evidence for the existence of the form of mental disorder later known as dementia praecox or schizophrenia, although Emil Kraepelin is generally accredited with its first conceptualisation.  Early life  Dr. Philippe Pinel at the Salp√™tri√®re, 1795 by Tony Robert-Fleury. Pinel ordering the removal of chains from patients at the Paris Asylum for insane women. Pinel was born in Jonqui√®res, the South of France, in the modern department of Tarn. He was the son and nephew of physicians. After receiving a degree from the faculty of medicine in Toulouse, he studied an additional four years at the Faculty of Medicine of Montpellier. He arrived in Paris in 1778. He spent fifteen years earning his living as a writer, translator, and editor because the restrictive regulations of the old regime prevented him from practicing medicine in Paris. The faculty did not recognize a degree from a provincial university like Toulouse. He failed twice in a competition which would have awarded him funds to continue his studies. In the second competition, the jury stressed his ‚Äòpainful‚Äô mediocrity in all areas of medical knowledge, an assessment seemingly so grossly incompatible with his later intellectual accomplishments that political motives have been suggested.Michel Caire, \\"Philippe Pinel en 1784. Un m√©decin \\"√©tranger\\" devant la Facult√© de M√©decine de Paris.\\" In Histoire des Sciences M√©dicales vol XXIX, no 3 1995, pp 242 - 251 Discouraged, Pinel considered emigrating to America. In 1784 he became editor of the medical journal the Gazette de sant√©, a four- page weekly. He was also known among natural scientists as a regular contributor to the Journal de physique. He studied mathematics, translated medical works into French, and undertook botanical expeditions. At about this time he began to develop an intense interest in the study of mental illness. The incentive was a personal one. A friend had developed a ‚Äònervous melancholy‚Äô that had ‚Äòdegenerated into mania‚Äô and resulted in suicide. What Pinel regarded as an unnecessary tragedy due to gross mismanagement seems to have haunted him. It led him to seek employment at one of the best-known private sanatoria for the treatment of insanity in Paris. He remained there for five years prior to the Revolution, gathering observations on insanity and beginning to formulate his views on its nature and treatment. Pinel was an Ideologue, a disciple of the abb√© de Condillac. He was also a clinician who believed that medical truth was derived from clinical experience. Hippocrates was his model. During the 1780s, Pinel was invited to join the salon of Madame Helv√©tius. He was in sympathy with the French Revolution. After the revolution, friends he had met at Madame Helv√©tius‚Äô salon came to power. In August 1793 Pinel was appointed \\"physician of the infirmeries\\" at Bic√™tre Hospital. At the time it housed about four thousand imprisoned men‚Äîcriminals, petty offenders, syphilitics, pensioners and about two hundred mental patients. Pinel‚Äôs patrons hoped that his appointment would lead to therapeutic initiatives. His experience at the private sanatoria made him a good candidate for the job.  The Bic√™tre and Salp√™tri√®re  Soon after his appointment to Bic√™tre Hospital, Pinel became interested in the seventh ward where 200 mentally ill men were housed. He asked for a report on these inmates. A few days later, he received a table with comments from the \\"governor\\" Jean- Baptiste Pussin. In the 1770s Pussin had been successfully treated for scrofula at Bic√™tre; and, following a familiar pattern, he was eventually recruited, along with his wife, Marguerite Jubline, on to the staff of the hospice. Appreciating Pussin's outstanding talent, Pinel virtually apprenticed himself to that unschooled but experienced custodian of the insane. His purpose in doing this was to \\"enrich the medical theory of mental illness with all the insights that the empirical approach affords\\". What he observed was a strict nonviolent, nonmedical management of mental patients that came to be called moral treatment or moral management, though psychological might be a more accurate term. Pinel freeing the insane from their chains, 1876 by Tony Robert-Fleury Although Pinel always gave Pussin the credit he deserved, a legend grew up about Pinel single-handedly liberating the insane from their chains at Bicetre. This legend has been commemorated in paintings and prints, and has lived on for 200 years and is repeated in textbooks. In fact, it was Pussin who removed the iron shackles (but sometimes using straitjackets) at Bic√™tre in 1797, after Pinel had left for the Salp√™tri√®re. Pinel did remove the chains from patients at the Salp√™tri√®re three years later, after Pussin joined him there. There is some suggestion that the Bicetre myth was actually deliberately fabricated by Pinel's son, Dr Scipion Pinel, along with Pinel's foremost pupil, Dr Esquirol. The argument is that they were 'solidists', which meant then something akin to biological psychiatry with a focus on brain disease, and were embarrassed by Pinel's focus on psychological processes. In addition, unlike Philippe, they were both royalists. While at Bic√™tre, Pinel did away with bleeding, purging, and blistering in favor of a therapy that involved close contact with and careful observation of patients. Pinel visited each patient, often several times a day, and took careful notes over two years. He engaged them in lengthy conversations. His objective was to assemble a detailed case history and a natural history of the patient's illness. In 1795, Pinel became chief physician of the Hospice de la Salp√™tri√®re, a post that he retained for the rest of his life. The Salp√™tri√®re was, at the time, like a large village, with seven thousand elderly indigent and ailing women, an entrenched bureaucracy, a teeming market and huge infirmaries. Pinel missed Pussin and in 1802 secured his transfer to the Salp√™tri√®re. It has also been noted that a Catholic nursing order actually undertook most of the day to day care and understanding of the patients at Salp√™tri√®re, and there were sometimes power struggles between Pinel and the nurses. Pinel created an inoculation clinic in his service at the Salp√™tri√®re in 1799, and the first vaccination in Paris was given there in April 1800. In 1795 Pinel had also been appointed as a professor of medical pathology, a chair that he held for twenty years. He was briefly dismissed from this position in 1822, with ten other professors, suspected of political liberalism, but reinstated as an honorary professor shortly thereafter. A statue in honour of Pinel now stands outside the Salp√™tri√®re.  Publications  In 1794 Pinel made public his essay 'Memoir on Madness', recently called a fundamental text of modern psychiatry. In it Pinel makes the case for the careful psychological study of individuals over time, points out that insanity isn't always continuous, and calls for more humanitarian asylum practices. In 1798 Pinel published an authoritative classification of diseases in his Nosographie philosophique ou m√©thode de l'analyse appliqu√©e √† la m√©decine. Although he is properly considered one of the founders of psychiatry, this book also establishes him as the last great nosologist of the eighteenth century. While the Nosographie appears completely dated today, it was so popular in its time that it went through six editions between its initial publication and 1818. Pinel based his nosology on ideas of William Cullen, employing the same biologically-inspired terminology of 'genera' and 'species' of disorder. Pinel's classification of mental disorder simplified Cullen's 'neuroses' down to four basic types of mental disorder: melancholia, mania (insanity), dementia, and idiotism. Later editions added forms of 'partial insanity' where only that of feelings which seem to be affected rather than reasoning ability. The first mental derangement is called melancholia. The symptoms are described as ‚Äútaciturnity, a thoughtful pensive air, gloomy suspicions, and a love of solitude.‚Äù It is noted that Tiberius and Louis XI were subjected to this temperament. Louis was characterized by the imbalance between the state of bitterness and passion, gloom, love of solitude, and the embarrassment of artistic talents. However, Louis and Tiberius were similar in that they both were deceitful and planned a delusional trip to military sites. Eventually both were exiled, one to the Isle of Rhodes and the other to a province of Belgium. People with melancholia are often immersed with one idea that their whole attention is fixated on. On one hand they stay reserved for many years, withholding friendships and affection while on the other, there are some who make reasonable judgment and overcome the gloomy state. Melancholia can also express itself in polar opposite forms. The first is distinguished by an exalted sense of self- importance and unrealistic expectations such as attaining riches and power. The second form is marked by deep despair and great depression. Overall individuals with melancholia generally do not display acts of violence, though they may find it wildly fanciful. Depression and anxiety occurs habitually as well as frequent moroseness of character. Pinel remarks that melancholia can be explained by drunkenness, abnormalities in the structure of the skull, trauma in the skull, conditions of the skin, various psychological causes such as household disasters and religious extremism, and in women, menstruation and menopause. The second mental derangement is called mania without delirium. It is described as madness independent of a disorder that impairs the intellectual faculties. The symptoms are described as perverse and disobedient. An instance where this type of species of mental derangement occurs where a mechanic, who was confined at the Asylum de Bicetre, experienced violent outbursts of maniacal fury. The paroxysms consisted of a burning sensation located in the abdominal area that was accompanied by constipation and thirst. The symptom spread to the chest, neck, and face area. When it reached the temples, the pulsation of the arteries increased in those areas. The brain was affected to some length but nonetheless, the patient was able to reason and cohere to his ideas. One time the mechanic experienced furious paroxysm at his own house where he warned his wife to flee to avoid death. He also experienced the same periodical fury at the asylum where he plotted against the governor. The specific character of mania without delirium is that it can either be perpetual or sporadic. However, there was no reasonable change in the cognitive functions of the brain; only perversive thoughts of fury and a blind tendency to acts of violence. The third mental derangement is called mania with delirium. It is mainly characterized by indulgence and fury, and affects cognitive functions. Sometimes it may be distinguished by a carefree, gay humor that can venture off path in incoherent and absurd suggestions. Other times it can be distinguished by prideful and imaginary claims to grandeur. Prisoners of this species are highly delusional. For example, they would proclaim having fought an important battle, or witness the prophet Mohammad conjuring wrath in the name of the Almighty. Some declaim ceaselessly with no evidence of things seen or heard while others saw illusions of objects in various forms and colors. Delirium sometimes persists with some degree of frenzied uproar for a period of years, but it can also be constant and the paroxysm of fury repeat at different intervals. The specific character of mania with delirium is the same as mania without delirium in the sense that it can either be continued or cyclical with regular or irregular paroxysms. It is marked by strong nervous excitement, accompanied by a deficit of one or more of the functions of the cognitive abilities with feelings of liveliness, depression or fury. The fourth mental derangement is called dementia, or otherwise known as the abolition of thinking. The characteristics include thoughtlessness, extreme incorrectness, and wild abnormalities. For instance, a man who had been educated on the ancient nobility was marching on about the beginning of the revolution. He moved restlessly about the house, talking endlessly and shouting passionately on insignificant reasons. Dementia is usually accompanied by raging and rebellious movement, by a quick succession of ideas formed in the mind, and by passionate feelings that are felt and forgotten without attributing it to objects. Those who are in captive of dementia have lost their memory, even those attributed to their loved ones. Their only memory consists of those in the past. They forget instantaneously things in the present ‚Äì seen heard or done. Many are irrational because the ideas do not flow coherently. The characteristic properties of dementia are that there is no judgment value and the ideas are spontaneous with no connection. The specific character of dementia contains a rapid progression or continual succession of isolated ideas, forgetfulness of previous condition, repetitive acts of exaggeration, decreased responsiveness to external influence, and complete lack of judgment. The fifth and last mental derangement is called idiotism, or otherwise known as ‚Äúobliteration of the intellectual faculties and affections.‚Äù This disorder is derived from a variety of causes, such as extravagant and debilitating delight, alcohol abuse, deep sorrow, diligent study, aggressive blows to the head, tumors in the brain, and loss of consciousness due to blockage in vein or artery. Idiotism embodies a variety of forms. One such form is called Cretinism, which is a kind of idiotism that is relative to personal abnormalities. It is well known in the Valais and in parts of Switzerland. Most people who belong in this group are either deficient in speech or limited to the inarticulate utterances of sounds. Their expressions are emotionless, senses are dazed and motions are mechanical. Idiots also constitute the largest number of patients at hospitals. Individuals who have acute responsiveness can experience a violent shock to the extreme that all the activities of the brain can either be arrested in an action or eradicated completely. Unexpected happiness and exaggerated fear may likely occur as a result of a violent shock. As mentioned previously, idiotism is the most common among hospital patients and is incurable. At the Bicetre asylum, these patients constitute one fourth of the entire population. Many die after a few days of arrival, having been reduced to states of stupor and weakness. However, some who recover with the progressive regeneration of their strength also regain their intellectual capabilities. Many of the young people that have remained in the state of idiotism for several months or years are attacked by a spasm of active mania between twenty and thirty days. The specific character of idiotism includes partial or complete extermination of the intellect and affections, apathy, disconnected, inarticulate sounds or impairment of speech, and nonsensical outbursts of passion. In his book Trait√© m√©dico-philosophique sur l'ali√©nation mentale; ou la manie, published in 1801, Pinel discusses his psychologically oriented approach. This book was translated into English by D. D. Davis as a Treatise on Insanity in 1806, although Davis substituted Pinel's introduction for his own, leaving out among other things Pinel's strong praise for Alexander Crichton. Pinel's book had an enormous influence on both French and Anglo-American psychiatrists during the nineteenth century. He meant by alienation that the patient feels like a stranger (alienus) to the world of the 'sane'. A sympathetic therapist living in that world might be able to journey into the patient's experience, understand the 'alienated', their language, and possibly lead them back into society. In 1802 Pinel published La M√©decine Clinique which was based on his experiences at the Salp√™tri√®re and in which he extended his previous book on classification and disease. Pinel was elected to the Acad√©mie des Sciences in 1804 and was a member of the Acad√©mie de M√©decine from its founding in 1820. He died in Paris in 1826.  Clinical approach  = Psychological understanding = The central and ubiquitous theme of Pinel's approach to etiology (causation) and treatment was \\"moral,\\" meaning the emotional or the psychological not ethical. He observed and documented the subtleties and nuances of human experience and behavior, conceiving of people as social animals with imagination.Philippe Huneman ‚ÄúAnimal Economy‚Äù Anthropology and the Rise of Psychiatry from the ‚ÄòEncyclop√©die‚Äô to the Alienists in Anthropology of the Enlightenment. Wolff L., Marco Cipolloni M. (ed.), Stanford University Press, ch. 14, 2007 Pinel noted, for example, that: \\"being held in esteem, having honor, dignity, wealth, fame, which though they may be factitious, always distressing and rarely fully satisfied, often give way to the overturning of reason\\". He spoke of avarice, pride, friendship, bigotry, the desire for reputation, for conquest, and vanity. He noted that a state of love could turn to fury and desperation, and that sudden severe reversals in life, such as \\"from the pleasure of success to an overwhelming idea of failure, from a dignified state‚Äîor the belief that one occupies one‚Äîto a state of disgrace and being forgotten\\" can cause mania or 'mental alienation'. He identified other predisposing psychosocial factors such as an unhappy love affair, domestic grief, devotion to a cause carried to the point of fanaticism, religious fear, the events of the revolution, violent and unhappy passions, exalted ambitions of glory, financial reverses, religious ecstasy, and outbursts of patriotic fervor. = Treatments = Pinel developed specific practical techniques, rather than general concepts and assumptions. He engaged in therapeutic conversations to dissuade patients from delusions. He offered benevolent support and encouragement, although patients who persistently resisted or caused trouble might be threatened with incarceration or punishment if they were not able to control themselves. Pinel argued that psychological intervention must be tailored to each individual rather than be based solely on the diagnostic category, and that it must be grounded in an understanding of the person's own perspective and history. He noted that \\"the treatment of insanity (l‚Äôali√©nation mentale) without considering the differentiating characteristics of the patients [la distinction des esp√®ces] has been at times superfluous, rarely useful, and often harmful\\", describing the partial or complete failures of some psychological approaches, as well as the harm that the usual cruel and harsh treatments caused to patients before they came to his hospital. He saw improvement as often resulting from natural forces within the patient, an improvement that treatment could at best facilitate and at worst interfere with. Pinel‚Äôs approach to medical treatments has been described as ambiguous, complex, and ambivalent. He insisted that psychological techniques should always be tried first, for example \\"even where a violent and destructive maniac could be calmed by a single dose of an antispasmodic [he referred to opium], observation teaches that in a great number of cases, one can obtain a sure and permanent cure by the sole method of expectation, leaving the insane man to his tumultuous excitement... ...and [furthermore] seeing, again and again, the unexpected resources of nature left to itself or wisely guided, has rendered me more and more cautious with regard to the use of medications, which I no longer employ‚Äîexcept when the insufficiencies of psychological means have been proven.\\" For those cases regarded as psychologically incurable, Pinel would employ baths, showers, opium, camphor and other antispasmodics, as well as vesicants, cauterization, and bloodletting in certain limited cases only. He also recommended the use of laxatives for the prevention of nervous excitement and relapse. Pinel often traced mental states to physiological states of the body, and in fact could be said to have practiced psychosomatic medicine. In general, Pinel traced organic causes to the gastrointestinal system and peripheral nervous system more often than to brain dysfunction. This was consistent with his rarely finding gross brain pathology in his post-mortem examinations of psychiatric patients, and his view that such findings that were reported could be correlational rather than causative. = Management = Pinel was concerned with a balance between control by authority and individual liberty. He believed in \\"the art of subjugating and taming the insane\\" and the effectiveness of \\"a type of apparatus of fear, of firm and consistent opposition to their dominating and stubbornly held ideas\\", but that it must be proportional and motivated only by a desire to keep order and to bring people back to themselves. The straitjacket and a period of seclusion were the only sanctioned punishments. Based on his observations, he believed that those who were considered most dangerous and carried away by their ideas had often been made so by the blows and bad treatment they had received, and that it could be ameliorated by providing space, kindness, consolation, hope, and humor. Because of the dangers and frustrations that attendants experienced in their work, Pinel put great emphasis on the selection and supervision of attendants in order to establish a custodial setting dedicated to norms of constraint and liberty that would facilitate psychological work. He recommended that recovered patients be employed, arguing that \\"They are the ones who are most likely to refrain from all inhumane treatment, who will not strike even in retaliation, who can stand up to pleading, menaces, repetitive complaining, etc. and retain their inflexible firmness.\\" Pinel also emphasized the necessity for leadership that was \\"thoughtful, philanthropic, courageous, physically imposing, and inventive in the development of maneuvers or tactics to distract, mollify, and impress\\" and \\"devoted to the concept of order without violence\\", so that patients are \\"led most often with kindness, but always with an inflexible firmness.\\" He noted that his ex-patient and superintendent Pussin had showed him the way in this regard, and had also often been better placed to work with patients and develop techniques due to his greater experience and detailed knowledge of the patients as individuals. = Moral judgments = Pinel generally expressed warm feelings and respect for his patients, as exemplified by: \\"I cannot but give enthusiastic witness to their moral qualities. Never, except in romances, have I seen spouses more worthy to be cherished, more tender fathers, passionate lovers, purer or more magnanimous patriots, than I have seen in hospitals for the insane, in their intervals of reasonableness and calm; a man of sensibility may go there any day and take pleasure in scenes of compassion and tenderness\\". He argued that otherwise positive character traits could cause a person to be vulnerable to the distressing vicissitudes of life, for example \\"those persons endowed with a warmth of imagination and a depth of sensitivity, who are capable of experiencing powerful and intense emotions, [since it is they] who are most predisposed to mania\\". Pinel distanced himself from religious views, and in fact considered that excessive religiosity could be harmful. However, he sometimes took a moral stance himself as to what he considered to be mentally healthy and socially appropriate. Moreover, he sometimes showed a condemnatory tone toward what he considered personal failings or vice, for example noting in 1809: \\"On one side one sees families which thrive over a course of many years, in the bosom of order and concord, on the other one sees many others, especially in the lower social classes, who offend the eye with the repulsive picture of debauchery, arguments, and shameful distress!\\". He goes on to describe this as the most prolific source of alienation needing treatment, adding that while some such examples were a credit to the human race many others are \\"a disgrace to humanity!\\"Louis C Charland (2008) A moral line in the sand: Alexander Chrichton and Philippe Pinel on the psychopathology of the passions. In Fact and value in emotion By Louis C. Charland, Peter Zachar  Influence  Pinel is generally seen as the physician who more than any other transformed the concept of 'the mad' into that of patients needing care and understanding, establishing a field that would eventually be called psychiatry. His legacy included improvement of asylum conditions; broadly psychosocial (incl. milieu) therapeutic approaches; history-taking; nosography (the science of the description of syndromes); broadly-numerical assessments of courses of illness and treatment responses; and a record of clinical teaching. Pinel's actions took place in the context of the Enlightenment, and a number of others were also reforming asylums along humanitarian lines. For example, Vincenzo Chiarugi, in the 1780s in Italy, removed metal chains from patients but did not enjoy the same renown bestowed on the more explicitly humanitarian Pinel who was so visible from late 18th century revolutionary France. In France, Joseph D'Aquin in Chamb√©ry permitted patients to move about freely and published a book in 1791 urging humanitarian reforms, dedicating the second edition in 1804 to Pinel. The movement as a whole become known as moral treatment or moral management, and influenced asylum development and psychological approaches throughout the Western world. Pinel's most important contribution may have been the observation and conviction that there could be sanity and rationality even in cases that seemed on the surface impossible to understand, and that this could appear for periods in response to surrounding events (and not just because of such things as the phase of the moon, a still common assumption and the origin of the term lunatic). The influential philosopher Hegel praised Pinel for this approach. Pinel also started a trend for diagnosing forms of insanity that seemed to occur 'without delerium' (confusion, delusions or hallucinations). Pinel called this Manie sans d√©lire, folie raisonnante or folie lucide raisonnante. He described cases who seemed to be overwhelmed by instinctive furious passions but still seemed sane. This was influential in leading to the concept of moral insanity, which became an accepted diagnosis through the second half of the 19th century. Pinel's main psychiatric heir, Esquirol, built on Pinel's work and popularised various concepts of monomania. However, Pinel was also criticised and rejected in some quarters. A new generation favoured pathological anatomy, seeking to locate mental disorders in brain lesions. Pinel undertook comparisons of skull sizes, and considered possible physiological substrates, but he was criticized for his emphasis on psychology and the social environment. Opponents were bolstered by the discovery of tertiary syphilis as the cause of some mental disorder. Pinel's humanitarian achievements were emphasized and mythologised instead. With increasing industrialization, asylums generally became overcrowded, misused, isolated and run-down. The moral treatment principles were often neglected along with the patients. There was recurrent debate over the use of psychological-social oppression even if some physical forces were removed. By the mid-19th century in England, the Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society was proclaiming the moral treatment approach was achieved \\"by mildness and coaxing, and by solitary confinement\\", treating people like children without rights to make their own decisions. Similarly in the mid-20th century, Foucault's influential book, Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason, also known as History of Madness, focused on Pinel, along with Tuke, as the driving force behind a shift from physical to mental oppression. Foucault argued that the approach simply meant that patients were ignored and verbally isolated, and were worse off than before. They were made to see madness in others and then in themselves until they felt guilt and remorse. The doctor, despite his lack of medical knowledge about the underlying processes, had all powers of authority, and defined insanity. Foucault also suggested that a focus on the rights of patients at Bicetre was partly due to revolutionary concerns that it housed and chained victims of arbitrary or political power, or alternatively that it might be enabling refuge for anti-revolutionary suspects, as well as just 'the mad'.Foucault, Michel. Madness and Civilization, p. 158, or History of Madness (pg 469) Scull argues that the \\"...manipulations and ambiguous 'kindness' of Tuke and Pinel...\\" may nevertheless have been preferable to the harsh coercion and physical \\"treatments\\" of previous generations, though he does recognise its \\"...less benevolent aspects and its latent potential ... for deterioration into a repressive form....\\" Some have criticised the process of deinstitutionalization that took place in the 20th century and called for a return to Pinel's approach, so as not to underestimate the needs that mentally ill people might have for protection and care.

The colors show the global integration of the different streets, measuring the accessibility of a topological line for the entire system according to the spatial analysis of the space syntax. Created with Mindwalk 1.0 The term space syntax encompasses a set of theories and techniques for the analysis of spatial configurations. It was conceived by Bill Hillier, Julienne Hanson, and colleagues at The Bartlett, University College London in the late 1970s to early 1980s to develop insights into the mutually constructive relation between society and space. As space syntax has evolved, certain measures have been found to correlate with human spatial behavior, and space syntax has thus come to be used to forecast likely effects of architectural and urban space on users. Thesis The general idea is that spaces can be broken down into components, analyzed as networks of choices, then represented as maps and graphs that describe the relative connectivity and integration of those spaces. It rests on three basic conceptions of space: * an isovist (popularised by Michael Benedikt at University of Texas), or viewshed or visibility polygon, the field of view from any particular point * axial space (idea popularized by Bill Hillier at UCL), a straight sight-line and possible path * convex space (popularized by John Peponis, and his collaborators at Georgia Tech), an occupiable void where, if imagined as a wireframe diagram, no line between two of its points goes outside its perimeter: all points within the polygon are visible to all other points within the polygon. The three most popular ways of analysing a street network are Integration, Choice and Depth Distance. * Integration measures the amount of street-to-street transitions needed from a street segment, to reach all other street segments in the network, using shortest paths. The graph analysis could also limit measure integration at radius 'n', for segments further than this radius not to be taken into account. The first intersecting segment requires only one transition, the second two transitions and so on. The result of the analysis finds street segments that require fewest turns to reach all other streets, which are called 'most integrated' and are usually represented with hotter colors, such as red or yellow. Integration can also be analyzed in local scale instead of the scale of the whole network. In the case of radius 4, for instance, only four turns are counted departing from each street segment. Measure also is highly related to network analysis Centrality. Theoretically, the integration measure shows the cognitive complexity of reaching a street, and is often argued to 'predict' the pedestrian use of a street: the easier it is to reach a street, the more popular it should be. While there is some evidence of this being true, the method is biased towards long, straight streets that intersect with many other streets. Such streets, as Oxford Street in London, come out as especially strongly integrated. However, a slightly curvy street of the same length would typically be segmented into individual straight segments, not counted as a single line, which makes curvy streets appear less integrated in the analysis. * The Choice measure is easiest to understand as a 'water-flow' in the street network. Imagine that each street segment is given an initial load of one unit of water, which then starts pouring from the starting street segment to all segments that successively connect to it. Each time an intersection appears, the remaining value of flow is divided equally amongst the splitting streets, until all the other street segments in the graph are reached. For instance, at the first intersection with a single other street, the initial value of one is split into two remaining values of one half, and allocated to the two intersecting street segments. Moving further down, the remaining one half value is again split among the intersecting streets and so on. When the same procedure has been conducted using each segment as a starting point for the initial value of one, a graph of final values appears. The streets with the highest total values of accumulated flow are said to have the highest choice values. Like Integration, Choice analysis can be restricted to limited local radii, for instance 400m, 800m, 1600m. Interpreting Choice analysis is trickier than Integration. Space syntax argues that these values often predict the car traffic flow of streets, but, strictly speaking, Choice analysis can also be thought to represent the number of intersections that need to be crossed to reach a street. However, since flow values are divided (not subtracted) at each intersection, the output shows an exponential distribution. It is considered best to take a log of base two of the final values in order to get a more accurate picture. * Depth Distance is the most intuitive of the analysis methods. It explains the linear distance from the center point of each street segment to the center points of all the other segments. If every segment is successively chosen as a starting point, a graph of cumulative final values is achieved. The streets with lowest Depth Distance values are said to be nearest to all the other streets. Again, the search radius can be limited to any distance. =Applications= From these components it is thought to be possible to quantify and describe how easily navigable any space is, useful for the design of museums, airports, hospitals, and other settings where wayfinding is a significant issue. Space syntax has also been applied to predict the correlation between spatial layouts and social effects such as crime, traffic flow, and sales per unit area. [references needed] = Software = In general, the analysis uses one of many software programs that allow researchers to analyse graphs of one (or more) of the primary spatial components. History Space syntax originated as a programme research in the early 1970s when Bill Hillier, Adrian Leaman and Alan Beattie came together at the School of Environmental Studies at University College London (now part of the Bartlett School of Architecture). Bill Hillier had been appointed Director of the Unit for Architectural Studies (UAS) as successor to John Musgrove. They established a new MSc programme in Advanced Architectural Studies and embarked on a programme of research aimed at developing a theoretical basis for architecture. Previously Bill Hillier had written papers with others as secretary to the RIBA, notably 'Knowledge and Design' and 'How is Design Possible'. These laid the theoretical foundation for a series of studies that sought to clarify how the built environment relates to society. One of the first cohort of students on the MScAAS was Julienne Hanson who went on to co-author The Social Logic of Space (SLS) with Bill Hillier (CUP, 1984). This brought together in one place a comprehensive review of the programme of research up to that point, but also developed a full theoretical account for how the buildings and settlements we construct an not merely the product of social processes, but also play a role in producing social forms. SLS also developed an analytic approach to representation and quantification of spatial configuration at the building and the settlement scale, making possible both comparative studies as well as analysis of the relationship between spatial configuration and aspect of social function in the built environment. These methods coupled to the social theories have turned out to have a good deal of explanatory power. Space syntax has grown to become a tool used around the world in a variety of research areas and design applications in architecture, urban design, urban planning, transport and interior design. Many prominent design applications have been made by the architectural and urban planning practice Space Syntax Limited, which was founded at The Bartlett, University College London in 1989. These include the redesign of Trafalgar Square with Foster and Partners and the Pedestrian Movement Model for the City of London. Over the past decade, Space syntax techniques have been used for research in archaeology, information technology, urban and human geography, and anthropology. Since 1997, the Space syntax community has held biennial conferences, and many journal papers have been published on the subject, chiefly in Environment and Planning B. Criticism Space syntax's mathematical reliability has come under scrutiny because of a seeming paradox that arises under certain geometric configurations with 'axial maps', one of the method's primary representations of spatial configuration. This paradox was proposed by Carlo Ratti at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but comprehensively refuted in a passionate academic exchange with Bill Hillier and Alan Penn [2004]. There have been moves to combine space syntax with more traditional transport engineering models, using intersections as nodes and constructing visibility graphs to link them, by researchers including Bin Jiang, Valerio Cutini and Michael Batty. Recently there has also been research development that combines space syntax with geographic accessibility analysis in GIS, such as the place syntax-models developed by the research group Spatial Analysis and Design at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. A series of interdisciplinary works published from 2006 by Vito Latora, Sergio Porta and colleagues, proposing a network approach to street centrality analysis and design, have highlighted Space Syntax' contribution to decades of previous studies in the physics of spatial complex networks.

It was founded in July 1997, following a national congress of the Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200, to support the candidacy of Hugo Ch√°vez, the former President of Venezuela, in the 1998 presidential election. The \\"Fifth Republic\\" refers to the fact that in 1997 the Republic of Venezuela was the fourth in Venezuelan history, and the Movement aimed to re-found the Republic through a constituent assembly. Following Ch√°vez' 1998 election victory, this took place in 1999, leading to the 1999 Constitution of Venezuela. At the legislative elections on 30 July 2000, the party won 91 out of 165 seats in the National Assembly. On the same day Hugo Ch√°vez was elected president in the presidential elections with 59.5% of votes. In the parliamentary elections of 4 December 2005, the party won 114 out of 167 seats with allied parties winning the remaining seats. Opposition parties had unexpectedly withdrawn several days before election day, and turnout was just 25%. In December 2006 and January 2007 the party started its dissolution, to form the proposed United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV). It merged into PSUV on 20 October 2007. Foundation The MVR was founded in July 1997 to support the electoral aims of the Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200. For a number of years after his 1994 release from prison, Ch√°vez maintained a position against participation in elections, believing them a fixed game which merely legitimated the established order. This led to a split with his colleague Francisco Arias C√°rdenas, who left the MBR-200.Jones, Bart (2008), Hugo! The Hugo Chavez Story from Mud Hut to Perpetual Revolution, London: The Bodley Head, pp. 202‚Äì04 In the early years after his release, Ch√°vez considered the possibility of another coup attempt, but with the prospects appearing slim, some advisers, notably Luis Miquilena, urged him to reconsider his scepticism of the elections, arguing that Ch√°vez could potentially win so convincingly that the establishment would not be able to deny him victory. To find out whether this was the case, Ch√°vez set up teams of psychologists, sociologists, university professors and students to carry out a survey. With their support, grassroots members of the Bolivarian movement polled tens of thousands of people across the country. The results showed that 70% of respondents supported Ch√°vez running for the presidency ‚Äì and 57% said they would vote for him. Support for the electoral route was strengthened when Arias C√°rdenas, as a candidate for Radical Cause, won the Governorship of Zulia State in the December 1995 regional elections. Despite this, the MBR-200 remained divided over electoral participation, and spent a year debating the issue in local, regional and national assemblies. A national congress on 19 April 1997 took from 9 am until 2 am the next day to reach a conclusion, ultimately deciding to launch Ch√°vez' candidacy for the 1998 presidential election. Some members of the movement resigned in protest, holding too much at stake. In July 1997 Ch√°vez registered the new \\"Fifth Republic Movement\\" with the National Electoral Council (the name had to be changed as Venezuelan law did not permit parties to use Simon Bolivar's name). The international media took little interest, citing opinion polls showing 8% support for Ch√°vez. Aims The party was committed to the Bolivarian Revolution and claimed to be the political voice of the country's poor. Primary elections Mural of MVR logo The Movement for a Fifth Republic (MVR), formerly Venezuela‚Äôs governing party, was the first political party in Venezuela to incorporate primary elections as the primary method for selecting its candidates. Led by President Hugo Ch√°vez, but involving organizations and movements that are broader than the MVR, the question of how to select MVR candidates had been controversial. Until the implementation of this primary mechanism, candidates tended to be hand-picked by the leadership of the parties. The result had been that a number of those elected on MVR platforms were distrusted by the masses, and in some cases proved to be disloyal. The issue came to a head in the lead-up to the regional elections of October 2005. Despite opposition from within the grassroots movements, a candidate list was drawn up by the leadership of various MVR allied parties. The decision not to hold primaries was justified by the claim that there wasn't time. After the elections, Chavez stated that in the future, primaries would be held to empower the rank and file to select candidates. Provisions introduced into the constitution and adopted by referendum in 1999 already mean that elected officials can have their mandate revoked half-way through their term if 20% of their electors sign a petition requesting a fresh election. A total of 2.4 million people voted in the MVR primaries. More than 5200 candidates were pre-selected to compete for the 5618 positions up for grabs in the August elections. The remaining 418 positions will go to other pro-Chavez parties. However, other pro-Chavez groups have publicly criticized the MVR for taking these positions. The use of Venezuelan history Venezuela historiography recognizes four \\"republics,\\" or major regime changes since the country was founded in 1811. The First Republic, known as the \\"Venezuelan Confederation\\" lasted until 1812. The Second Republic is the restored republican regime that was instituted by Sim√≥n Bol√≠var after his Admirable Campaign in 1813, and which lasted until 1814. The Third Republic refers to the period after 1816 in which various patriot guerrilla bands joined under Bol√≠var's leadership in the Llanos of Venezuela and set up an independent government. This process culminated in the Congress of Angostura, but shortly thereafter the Congress declared Venezuela to be part of a larger Gran Colombia. Gran Colombia lasted only a decade and at its dissolution Venezuela became once again the \\"Republic of Venezuela,\\" which is considered the start of the Fourth Republic. In 1864 the country was then restructured into the \\"United States of Venezuela\\", before reverting once again to the name, \\"Republic of Venezuela\\" in 1953. Although both periods began with the implementation of new constitutions (the fourth and twenty-fourth constitutions, respectively), both have been deemed by Venezuelan historiography as a continuation of the Fourth Republic.Planchart Manrique, Gustavo. \\"Constituciones de Venezuela\\" in Diccionario de Historia de Venezuela. Caracas: Fundaci√≥n Polar, 1997. Since Ch√°vez's election to the Presidency in 1999, the country has been known as the \\"Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\\", signaling Ch√°vez' desires to usher in a new era of politics and government. This unique \\"Bolivarian\\" government is the \\"Fifth Republic\\" referred to in the party's title. The use of the phrase also echoes the French Fifth Republic, which was another sweeping political change to deal with political instability during decolonisation. Dissolution On 18 December 2006, Hugo Ch√°vez announced plans to dissolve the party, hoping that the 23 other parties that supported his government would follow suit and collectively form the proposed United Socialist Party of Venezuela.https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2006/12/18/AR2006121800832.html Elections the MVR participated in: * 1998 Venezuelan presidential election, 2000 Venezuelan presidential election, 2006 Venezuelan presidential election * 1998 Venezuelan parliamentary election, 2000 Venezuelan parliamentary election, 2005 Venezuelan parliamentary election * 1998 Venezuelan regional elections, 2000 Venezuelan regional elections, 2004 Venezuelan regional elections * April 1999 Venezuelan constitutional referendum, December 1999 Venezuelan constitutional referendum, 2004 Venezuelan recall referendum Leaders of MVR * Hugo Ch√°vez * Francisco Ameliach * Juan Barreto * Diosdado Cabello * Jesse Chac√≥n * Cilia Flores * Willian Lara * Nicol√°s Maduro * Tarek William Saab * Luis Tasc√≥n * Iris Varela * Dar√≠o Vivas Election results =Presidential= { class=wikitable - ! rowspan=2Election year ! rowspan=2Name ! colspan=21st round ! colspan=22nd round - ! # of overall votes ! % of overall vote ! # of overall votes ! % of overall vote - ! 1998  Hugo Ch√°vez  3,673,685  56.2 (#1)  colspan=2 bgcolor=lightgrey - ! 2000  Hugo Ch√°vez  3,757,773  59.8 (#1)  colspan=2 bgcolor=lightgrey - ! 2006  Hugo Ch√°vez  7,309,080  62.8 (#1)  colspan=2 bgcolor=lightgrey } =Parliament (National Assembly)= { class=wikitable - !

He is best known for popularizing the Scottish Enlightenment and his lectures at the University of Edinburgh were widely disseminated by his many influential students. In 1783 he was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In most contemporary documents he is referred to as Prof Dougal Stewart.Edinburgh Post Office Directories 1800 to 1828 etc Early life He was the son of Matthew Stewart (1715‚Äì1785), professor of mathematics at the University of Edinburgh (1747‚Äì1772), and was born in his father's quarters at Old College. His mother was Marjory Stewart, his father's cousin. He was educated at the High School and the University of Edinburgh, where he studied mathematics and moral philosophy under Adam Ferguson. In 1771, in the hope of gaining a Snell Exhibition Scholarship and proceeding to Oxford to study for the English Church, he went to the University of Glasgow to attend the classes of Thomas Reid. To Reid he later owed his theory of morality. In Glasgow, Stewart boarded in the same house as Archibald Alison, author of the Essay on Taste, and a lasting friendship sprang up between them. After a single session in Glasgow University, at the age of nineteen, Dugald was asked by his father, whose health was beginning to fail, to give his mathematical classes in the University of Edinburgh. After three years there, in 1775, Dugald was elected joint professor of mathematics in conjunction with his father. Three years later Ferguson was appointed secretary to the commissioners sent out to the American colonies, and at his request Stewart lectured as his substitute during the session 1778‚Äì1779, delivering an original course of lectures on morals. In his early years he was influenced by Lord Monboddo, with whom he corresponded. Professor at Edinburgh In 1785 Stewart succeeded Ferguson in the chair of moral philosophy, which he filled for twenty-five years, making it a centre of intellectual and moral influence. Young men were attracted by his reputation from England, Europe and America. Stewart's course on moral philosophy embraced, besides ethics proper, lectures on political philosophy or the theory of government. Stewart spent the summers of 1788 and 1789 in France, where he met Suard, Deg√©rando, and Raynal, and came to sympathise with the revolutionary movement. His political teaching, after the French Revolution, drew suspicion on him. His Edinburgh residence for several years was Whitefoord House on the Royal Mile.Edinburgh and District: Ward Lock Travel Guide 1930 From 1800 to 1801, Stewart gave lectures to undergraduate students on the subject of political economy, the first person to do so.The early years at University of Edinburgh School of Economics's official website. Accessed 24 February 2013. In 1800 he appears as \\"Dougald Stewart, professor of moral philosophy\\" living at Lothian House near the bottom of the Canongate.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1800 Family In 1783 Stewart married Helen Bannatyne (a distant cousin)http://www- groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Stewart.html, who died in 1787, leaving him an only son, Matthew Stewart FRSE (1784-1851). In 1790 he married Helen D'Arcy Cranstoun, sister of George Cranstoun. His second wife was well- born and accomplished, and he was in the habit of submitting to her criticism whatever he wrote. They had a son and a daughter. The son's death in 1809 brought about his retirement from the active duties of his chair. His sister, Janet Stewart, married Rev Thomas Miller of Cumnock, and they were parents to Dr Patrick Miller FRSE (1782-1871). Later life Dugald Stewart Monument, Edinburgh The tomb of Dugald Stewart, Canongate Kirkyard In 1806 Stewart received in lieu of a pension the nominal office of the writership of the Edinburgh Gazette, with a salary of ¬£300. When he ceased lecturing during the session of 1809‚Äì1810, his place was taken, at his own request, by Thomas Brown, who in 1810 was appointed conjoint professor. On the death of Brown in 1820 Stewart retired altogether from the professorship. His successor was John Wilson, known as \\"Christopher North\\". From 1809 onwards Stewart lived mainly at Kinneil House, Bo'ness, which was placed at his disposal by the Duke of Hamilton. In June 1814 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1817. Freemasonry Like his father, Rev Dr Matthew Stewart, he was a Scottish Freemason. He was Initiated in the Lodge of his father - Lodge Canongate Kilwinning, No.2, on 4 December 1775.History of the Lodge Canongate Kilwinning, No.2, compiled from the records 1677-1888. By Alan MacKenzie. 1888. P.245. His friend and fellow Freemason, Robert Burns, made him an honorary member of Lodge St David, Tarbolton, No. 133, on 25 July 1787. This was whilst Stewart was staying at the family seat at Catrine, Ayrshire.Robert Burns - The Freemason. Ed. John Weir. DSO, OBE, JP, MA, FEIS. 1996. P.14. . Death In 1822 he was struck with paralysis, but recovered a fair degree of health, sufficient to enable him to resume his studies. He died in Edinburgh on 11 June 1828, where he was buried in Canongate Churchyard, close to his Edinburgh residence. He is buried in an enclosed vault in the lower section, on its west side. Memorials In 1831, and of great public note, a monument was erected by the city on Calton Hill. This is to a design by William Henry Playfair and holds a commanding position in the city skyline, forming one of the city's iconic landmarks.Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh by Gifford, Mcwilliam and Walker His memory is also honoured by the \\"Dugald Stewart Building\\" (erected 2011) for the University of Edinburgh to house its Philosophy Department, on Charles Street, off George Square. Works Stewart as a student in Glasgow wrote an essay on Dreaming. In 1792 he published the first volume of the Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind; the second volume appeared in 1814, the third not till 1827. In 1793 he printed a textbook, Outlines of Moral Philosophy, which went through many editions; and in the same year he read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh his Account of the Life and Writings of Adam Smith. Similar memoirs of Robertson the historian and of Reid were afterwards read before the same body and appear in his published works. In 1805 Stewart published pamphlets defending John Leslie against the charges of unorthodoxy made by the presbytery of Edinburgh. In 1810 appeared the Philosophical Essays, in 1814 the second volume of the Elements, in 1811 the first part and in 1821 the second part of the \\"Dissertation\\" written for the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Supplement, entitled \\"A General View of the Progress of Metaphysical, Ethical, and Political Philosophy since the Revival of Letters.\\" In 1827 he published the third volume of the Elements, and in 1828, a few weeks before his death, The Philosophy of the Active and Moral Powers. Stewart's works were edited in 11 vols. (1854‚Äì1858) by Sir William Hamilton and completed with a memoir by John Veitch. Influence Among Stewart's pupils were Lord Palmerston, Sir Walter Scott, Francis Jeffrey, Henry Thomas Cockburn, Francis Horner, Sydney Smith, John William Ward, Lord Brougham, Dr. Thomas Brown, James Mill, Sir James Mackintosh and Sir Archibald Alison. His reputation rested as much on his eloquence, populism, and style as on original work. He was principally responsible for making the \\"Scottish philosophy\\" predominant in early 19th- century Europe. In the second half of the century, Stewart's reputation fell to that of a follower of the work of Thomas Reid. Stewart upheld Reid's psychological method and expounded the Scottish Common Sense Realism,Selections from the Scottish Philosophy of Common Sense, ed. by G. A. Johnston (1915), essays by Thomas Reid, Adam Ferguson, James Beattie, and Dugald Stewart (online version). which was attacked by James Mill and John Stuart Mill. Part of his originality lay in his incorporation of elements of moderate empiricism and the French ideologists Laromigui√®re, Cabanis and Destutt de Tracy. He opposed the argument of ontology, and Condillac's sensationalism.

Historically, a village green was common grassland with a pond for watering cattle and other stock, often at the edge of a rural settlement, used for gathering cattle to bring them later on to a common land for grazing. Later, planned greens were built into the centres of villages. The village green also provided, and may still provide, an open-air meeting place for the local people, which may be used for public celebrations such as May Day festivities. The term is used more broadly to encompass woodland, moorland, sports grounds, buildings, roads and urban parks. History Most village greens in England originated in the Middle Ages. Individual greens may have been created for various reasons, including protecting livestock from wild animals or human raiders during the night, or providing a space for market trading. In most cases where a village green is planned, it is placed in the centre of a settlement. Village greens can also be formed when a settlement expands to the edge of an existing area of common land, or when an area of waste land between two settlements becomes developed. Some historical village greens have been lost as a result of the agricultural revolution and urban development. Greens are now most likely to be found in the older villages of mainland Europe, the United Kingdom, and older areas of the United States. Some greens that used to be a common or otherwise at the centre of a village have been swallowed up by a city growing around them. Sometimes they become a city park or a square, and manage to maintain a sense of place. London has several of these, such as Newington Green, with Newington Green Unitarian Church anchoring the northern end. Town expansion in the mid-20th century led in England to the formation of local conservation societies, often centring on village green preservation, as celebrated and parodied in The Kinks' album The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society. The Open Spaces Society is a present-day UK national campaigning body which continues this movement. Examples =United States= New Haven Green, circa 1919 In the United States, the most famous example of a town green is probably the New Haven Green in New Haven, Connecticut. New Haven was founded by settlers from England and was the first planned city in the United States. Originally used for grazing livestock, the Green dates from the 1630s and is well preserved today despite lying at the heart of the city centre. The largest green in the U.S. is a mile in length, and can be found in Lebanon, Connecticut. This is the only village green in the United States still used for agriculture. One of the most unusual is the Dartmouth Green in Hanover, New Hampshire, which was owned and cleared by the college in 1770. The college, not the town, still owns it and surrounded it with buildings as a sort of collegiate quadrangle in the 1930s, although its origin as a town green remains apparent. An example of a traditional American town green exists in downtown Morristown, NJ. The Morristown Green dates from 1715 and has hosted events ranging from executions to clothing drives. There are two places in the United States called Village Green: Village Green-Green Ridge, Pennsylvania, and Village Green, New York. Some New England towns, along with some areas settled by New Englanders such as the townships in the Connecticut Western Reserve, refer to their town square as a village green. The village green of Bedford, New York, is preserved as part of Bedford Village Historic District. =Europe= Finchingfield village green A notable example of a village green is that in the village of Finchingfield in Essex, England, which is said to be \\"the most photographed village in England\\". The green dominates the village, and slopes down to a duck pond, and is occasionally flooded after heavy rain. The small village of Car Colston in Nottinghamshire, England, has two village greens, totaling 29 acres (12 ha),Good Pub Guide Retrieved 2 April 2016. and the village of Burton Leonard in North Yorkshire has three. The Open Spaces Society states that in 2005 there were about 3,650 registered greens in England covering and about 220 in Wales covering about . A village green in Zuidlaren, Netherlands The northern part of the province of Drenthe in the Netherlands is also known for its village greens. Zuidlaren is the village with the largest number of village greens in the Netherlands. The B≈Çonia Park, originally established in the Middle Ages, is an example of a large village green in Krak√≥w, Poland. =Indonesia= In Indonesia, especially in Java, a similar place is called Alun-Alun. It is a central part of Javanese village architecture and culture. Legal definitions =England and Wales= Apart from the general use of the term, village green has a specific legal meaning in England and Wales, and also includes the less common term town green. Town and village greens were defined in the Commons Registration Act 1965, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, as land: # which has been allotted by or under any Act for the exercise or recreation of the inhabitants of any locality # or on which the inhabitants of any locality have a customary right to indulge in lawful sports and pastimes # or if it is land on which for not fewer than twenty years a significant number of the inhabitants of any locality, or of any neighbourhood within a locality, have indulged in lawful sports and pastimes as of right. Registered greens in England and Wales are now governed by the Commons Act 2006, but the fundamental test of whether land is a town and village green remains the same. Thus land can become a village green if it has been used for twenty years without force, secrecy or request (nec vi, nec clam, nec precario).For a discussion of the law on this, see Austen-Baker, R. and Mayfield, B.,\\"Uncommon Confusion: Parallel Jurisprudence in Town and Village Green Applications\\" [2012] Conveyancer 55. Village green legislation is often used to try to frustrate development. Recent case law (Oxfordshire County Council vs Oxford City Council and Robinson) makes it clear that registration as a green would render any development which prevented continuing use of the green as a criminal activity under the Inclosure Act 1857 and the Commons Act 1876. This leads to some most curious areas being claimed as village greens, sometimes with success. Recent examples include a bandstand,http://www.iwight.com/council/committees/Human%20Resources%20and%20Misc%20Appeals/1-9-06/Paper%20B.htm two lakes and a beach.[2013] EWCA Civ 276 On 11 December 2019, a Supreme Court decision put the future of some village greens at risk in England and Wales. The case involved five fields (13 hectares) in south Lancaster, the Mooreside Fields, owned by Lancashire County Council. The lands had been available for public use for over 50 years. According to the Commons Act 2006, land used for informal recreation for at least 20 years can be registered as a green and is then protected from development. (Granted, the Growth and Infrastructure Act of 2013 specified that land designated for planning applications could not be registered as a village green, but that did not apply in the Moorside Fields case.) The Moorside Fields Community Group attempted to register the lands in 2016 under the Commons Act. The local authority challenged the registration, wanting to retain control of the lands for future expansion of the nearby Moorside Primary School's playing fields. The Council's challenge failed in the High Court and then in the Court of Appeal; the registration of the land as a village green could proceed. Lancashire County Council subsequently appealed to the UK Supreme Court. In the appeal decision, cited as R (on the application of Lancashire County Council) (Appellant) v Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Respondent) the Court overturned the previous judgments. At the same time, the Supreme Court also ruled against the registration of lands in a separate case in Surrey involving the 2.9 hectare Leach Grove Wood at Leatherhead, owned by the National Health Service. After publication of the decision in the Moorside Fields case, Lancashire County Council told the news media that the Court had \\"protect[ed] this land for future generations\\". In effect, the Supreme Court decision left lands owned by public authorities by their statutory powers open to development for any purpose that they deem to be appropriate. This could have far-reaching ramifications in England and Wales, according to the Open Spaces Society, a national conservation group that was founded in 1865. A representative made this comment to The Guardian: \\"This is a deeply worrying decision as it puts at risk countless publicly owned green spaces which local people have long enjoyed, but which, unknown to them, are held for purposes which are incompatible with recreational use\\".

It attacked computers running Microsoft's IIS web server. It was the first large scale, mixed threat attack to successfully target enterprise networks. The Code Red worm was first discovered and researched by eEye Digital Security employees Marc Maiffret and Ryan Permeh when it exploited a vulnerability discovered by Riley Hassell. They named it \\"Code Red\\" because Code Red Mountain Dew was what they were drinking at the time.ANALYSIS: .ida \\"Code Red\\" Worm (Archived copy from 22 July 2011), Code Red advisory, eEye Digital Security, 17 July 2001 Although the worm had been released on July 13, the largest group of infected computers was seen on July 19, 2001. On this day, the number of infected hosts reached 359,000. Concept =Exploited vulnerability= The worm showed a vulnerability in the growing software distributed with IIS, described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS01-033,MS01-033 \\"Microsoft Security Bulletin MS01-033: Unchecked Buffer in Index Server ISAPI Extension Could Enable Web Server Compromise\\", Microsoft Corporation, 18th of June 2001 for which a patch had been available a month earlier. The worm spread itself using a common type of vulnerability known as a buffer overflow. It did this by using a long string of the repeated letter 'N' to overflow a buffer, allowing the worm to execute arbitrary code and infect the machine with the worm. Kenneth D. Eichman was the first to discover how to block it, and was invited to the White House for his discovery. =Worm payload = The payload of the worm included: * Defacing the affected web site to display: HELLO! Welcome to http://www.worm.com! Hacked By Chinese! * Other activities based on day of the month: ** Days 1-19: Trying to spread itself by looking for more IIS servers on the Internet. ** Days 20‚Äì27: Launch denial of service attacks on several fixed IP addresses. The IP address of the White House web server was among those. ** Days 28-end of month: Sleeps, no active attacks. When scanning for vulnerable machines, the worm did not test to see if the server running on a remote machine was running a vulnerable version of IIS, or even to see if it was running IIS at all. Apache access logs from this time frequently had entries such as these: GET /default.ida?NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN %u9090%u6858%ucbd3%u7801%u9090%u6858%ucbd3%u7801 %u9090%u6858%ucbd3%u7801%u9090%u9090%u8190%u00c3 %u0003%u8b00%u531b%u53ff%u0078%u0000%u00=a HTTP/1.0 The worm's payload is the string following the last 'N'. Due to a buffer overflow, a vulnerable host interpreted this string as computer instructions, propagating the worm. Similar worms On the 4th of August 2001, Code Red II appeared. Although it used the same injection vector, it had a completely different payload. It pseudo-randomly chose targets on the same or different subnets as the infected machines according to a fixed probability distribution, favoring targets on its own subnet more often than not. Additionally, it used the pattern of repeating 'X' characters instead of 'N' characters to overflow the buffer. eEye believed that the worm originated in Makati City, Philippines, the same origin as the VBS/Loveletter (aka \\"ILOVEYOU\\") worm.

She grew up in Berlin, Germany, and received a thorough musical education from teachers including her mother, Ludwig Berger, and Carl Friedrich Zelter. Her brother Felix Mendelssohn, also a composer and pianist, shared the same education and the two developed a close relationship. Due to the reservations of her family, and to social conventions of the time about the roles of women, a number of her works were published under her brother's name in his Opus 8 and 9 collections. In 1829, she married the artist Wilhelm Hensel and, in 1830, the two had their only child, Sebastian Hensel. In 1846, despite the continuing ambivalence of her family towards her musical ambitions, Fanny Hensel published a collection of songs as her Opus 1. The next year, she suddenly died of a stroke. She composed over 460 pieces of music, including a piano trio, a piano quartet, an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and over 250 lieder, most of which went unpublished in her lifetime. Since the 1990s her life and works have been the subject of more detailed research. Her Easter Sonata was inaccurately credited to her brother in 1970, before new analysis of documents in 2010 corrected the error. The Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany. Life =Early life and education= Fanny Mendelssohn, sketched in 1829 by her future husband Wilhelm Hensel Mendelssohn was born in Hamburg, the oldest of four children, including her brother Felix Mendelssohn born four years after her.Mace Christian (2018) She was descended on both sides from distinguished Jewish families; her parents were Abraham Mendelssohn (who was the son of philosopher Moses Mendelssohn and later changed the family surname to Mendelssohn Bartholdy), and Lea, n√©e Salomon, a granddaughter of the entrepreneur Daniel Itzig.Todd (2010), pp. 3‚Äì5 Her uncle was the banker Joseph Mendelssohn. She was baptised as a Christian in 1816, becoming Fanny C√§cilie Mendelssohn Bartholdy.Todd (2010) Despite this, she and her family continued an affinity with the social and moral values of Judaism.Mendelssohn (1987), pp. xxix, 629Citron (1994), p. 322 Like her brother Felix, she objected strongly when their father Abraham changed the family surname to \\"Mendelssohn Bartholdy\\" with the intention of playing down their Jewish origins: she wrote to Felix of \\"Bartholdy, that name which we all dislike.\\"Mendelssohn (Hensel) 1987, p. 66 While growing up in the family's new home in Berlin,Forney (2015), p. 278 Mendelssohn showed prodigious musical ability and began to write music. She received her first piano instruction from her mother, who had learned the Berlin Bach tradition through the writings of Johann Kirnberger, a student of Johann Sebastian Bach.Todd (2010) Thus as a 14 year old, Mendelssohn could already play all 24 preludes from Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier from memory alone, and she did so in honour of her father's birthday in 1819.Hayman (2017) Beyond inspiration from her mother, Mendelssohn may also have been influenced by the role-models represented by her great-aunts Fanny von Arnstein and Sarah Levy, both lovers of music, the former the patroness of a well-known salon and the latter a skilled keyboard player in her own right.Citron (1994), After studying briefly with the pianist Marie Bigot in Paris,Mendelssohn (1987) Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received piano lessons from Ludwig Berger and composition instruction from Carl Friedrich Zelter.Rogers (2011), p. 178 At one point, Zelter favoured Fanny over Felix: he wrote to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in 1816, in a letter introducing Abraham Mendelssohn to the poet, \\"He has adorable children and his oldest daughter could give you something of Sebastian Bach. This child is really something special.\\"Conway (2012), 171 Both Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received instruction in composition from Zelter starting in 1819. In 1820, they joined the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin, which was then being led by Zelter.Mendelssohn (1987) Much later, in an 1831 letter to Goethe, Zelter described Fanny's skill as a pianist with the highest praise for a woman at the time: \\"She plays like a man.\\"Todd (2010) Visitors to the Mendelssohn household in the early 1820s, including Ignaz Moscheles and Sir George Smart, were equally impressed by both siblings.Conway (2012), p. 169Smart (1907), pp. 173, 179 =Gender and class limitations= In the words of the music historian Kristine Forney, in this period \\"social assumptions about women long discouraged them from composing (and limited their public performances)\\".Forney et al. (2015), page not given Such attitudes were shared by Mendelssohn's father, who was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. In 1820, he wrote to her, \\"Music will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for it can and must be only an ornament\\".Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I p. 82 Although Felix was privately broadly supportive of her as a composer and a performer, he was cautious (professedly for family reasons) of her publishing her works under her own name. He wrote: > From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor > vocation for authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for > this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the > musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are > fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that > I approve of it.Letter to Lea Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, 24 June 1837. > Mendelssohn (1864), p. 113 The music historian Angela Mace Christian has written that Fanny Mendelssohn \\"struggled her entire life with the conflicting impulses of authorship versus the social expectations for her high-class status[...]; her hesitation was variously a result of her dutiful attitude towards her father, her intense relationship with her brother, and her awareness of contemporary social thought on women in the public sphere.\\" Felix's friend Henry Chorley wrote of Fanny: \\"Had Madame Hensel been a poor man's daughter, she must have become known to the world by the side of Madame Schumann and Madame Pleyel as a female pianist of the highest class\\", suggesting that her social class was limiting for her career as well as her sex.Conway (2012) pp. 27‚Äì28 The biography of the Mendelssohn family compiled from family documents by Fanny's son Sebastian HenselHensel (1884) has been construed by the musicologist Marian Kimber as intending to represent Fanny as having no aspirations to perform outside the private sphere.Kimber (2002), p. 115 However, the editor of Fanny's correspondence, Marcia Citron, notes that Fanny's \\"oft-reported longing for a professional music career is not supported by her ... diaries, which are somewhat surprising for how little they reveal about her musical life.\\"Kimber (2004), p. 51 =Felix and Fanny= Felix Mendelssohn aged 12 (1821) by Carl Joseph BegasThe siblings' bond was strengthened by their shared passion for music. Fanny's works were often played alongside her brother's at the family home in Berlin in a Sunday concert series (Sonntagskonzerte), which was originally organised by her father and after 1831 carried on by Fanny herself.Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 631 In 1822, when Fanny was 17 and Felix 13, she wrote \\"Up to the present moment I possess his [Felix's] unbounded confidence. I have watched the progress of his talent step by step, and may say I have contributed to his development. I have always been his only musical adviser, and he never writes down a thought before submitting it to my judgment.\\"Hensel (1884), p. 117 In 1826/1827 Felix arranged with Fanny for some of her songs to be published under his name,Hensel (1884), II 168‚Äì71 three in his Op. 8 collectionTodd (2003), p. 175 and three more in his Op. 9.Todd (2003), p. 224 In 1842, this resulted in an embarrassing moment when Queen Victoria, receiving Felix at Buckingham Palace, expressed her intention of singing to the composer her favourite of his songs, Italien (to words by Franz Grillparzer), which Felix confessed was by Fanny. There was a lifelong musical correspondence between the two. Fanny helped Felix by providing constructive criticism of pieces and projects, which he always considered very carefully.Reich (1991), p. 92 Felix would rework pieces solely based on the suggestions she made, and nicknamed her \\"Minerva\\" after the Roman goddess of wisdom. Their correspondence of 1840/41 reveals that they were both outlining scenarios for an opera on the subject of the Nibelungenlied: Fanny wrote \\"The hunt with Siegfried's death provides a splendid finale to the second act.\\"Letter of 9 December 1840. See Fanny Mendelssohn (1987), pp. 299‚Äì301 = Marriage and later life= In 1829, after a courtship of several years (they had first met in 1821 when she was 16), Fanny married the artist Wilhelm Hensel, and the following year gave birth to their only child, .Todd (2003), pp. 219, 230 She later had at least two miscarriages or stillbirths, in 1832 and 1837. Wilhelm Hensel: Self-portrait (1829) In 1830 came her first public notice as a composer, when John Thomson, who had met her in Berlin the previous year, wrote in the London journal The Harmonicon in praise of a number of her songs that had been shown to him by Felix.Gates (2006), p. 7 Her public debut at the piano (one of only three known public performances according to Mendelssohn scholar R. Larry Todd)Todd (2010), p. x came in 1838, when she played her brother's Piano Concerto No. 1.Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. xxiv Fanny's support of Felix's music was clearly demonstrated during the 1838 rehearsals in Berlin for her brother's oratorio St. Paul at the Singverein, which she attended at the invitation of its conductor, Carl Friedrich Rungenhagen. In a letter to her brother she described attending the rehearsals and \\"suffering and champing at the bit [...] as I heard the whining and [the accompanist's] dirty fingers on the piano [...] They started [the passage] \\"mache dich auf\\" at half the right tempo, and then I instinctively called out, \\"My God, it must go twice as fast!\\" The consequence was that Rungenhagen consulted her closely about all details of the rehearsals and performance; this included her firm instructions not to add a tuba to the organ part. \\"I assured them that they should be ruled by my word, and they'd better do it for God's sake.\\"Citron (1984), p. 104 Wilhelm Hensel, like Felix, was supportive of Fanny's composing, but unlike many others of her circle was also in favour of her seeking publication of her works.Kimber (2002), p. 116Reich (1991), p. 95. The historian Nancy B. Reich has suggested two events which may have increased her confidence. One was her visit to Italy with her husband and Sebastian in 1839‚Äì40. This was her first visit to the South and she felt invigorated and inspired; they also spent time with young French musicians who had won the Prix de Rome (one was the young Charles Gounod) and whose respect for Fanny powered her self-esteem as a musician. The other event was her acquaintance shortly afterwards with the Berlin critic Robert von Keudell; in her diary she wrote: \\"Keudell looks at everything new that I write with the greatest interest, and points out to me if there is something to be corrected [...] He has always given me the very best counsel.\\"Reich (1991), pp. 95‚Äì6 Grave of Fanny Hensel in Berlin In 1846, after an approach by two Berlin publishersHensel (1874), v. 2, p. 325 and without consulting Felix, she decided to publish a collection of her songs (as her Op. 1).Citron, (1994) After publication, Felix wrote to her \\"[I] send you my professional blessing on becoming a member of the craft [...] may you have much happiness in giving pleasure to others; may you taste only the sweets and none of the bitterness of authorship; may the public pelt you with roses, and never with sand.\\" (12 August 1846). On 14 August Fanny wrote in her journal \\"Felix has written, and given me his professional blessing in the kindest manner. I know that he is not quite satisfied in his heart of hearts, but I am glad he has said a kind word to me about it.\\"Hensel (1874), v. 2, pp. 325‚Äì326 She also wrote about the publication to her friend Angelica von Woringen: \\"I can truthfully say that I let it happen more than made it happen, and it is this in particular which cheers me [...] If [the publishers] want more from me, it should act as a stimulus to achieve. If the matter comes to an end then, I also won't grieve, for I'm not ambitious.\\" Throughout March 1847 Fanny had many meetings with Clara Schumann. At this time Fanny was working on her Piano Trio Op. 11 and Clara had recently completed her own Piano Trio (Op. 17), which she may have intended to dedicate to Fanny. =Death= On 14 May 1847 Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel died in Berlin of complications from a stroke suffered while rehearsing one of her brother's cantatas, The First Walpurgis Night.Todd (2002), p. 557 Felix himself died less than six months later from the same cause (which was also responsible for the deaths of both of their parents and their grandfather Moses),Sterndale Bennett (1955) 376 but not before completing his String Quartet No. 6 in F minor, written in memory of his sister.Todd (2010), pp. 348‚Äì349 Compositions April from the manuscript of Fanny Hensel's Das Jahr (illustration by Wilhelm Hensel) Fanny Mendelssohn composed over 460 pieces of music. Her compositions include a piano trio, a piano quartet, an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and in excess of 250 Lieder (German art songs).Forney (2014), p. 278 A number of her songs were originally published under Felix's name in his Opus 8 and 9 collections.Song (2016), pp. 2‚Äì3 Her piano works are often in the manner of songs, and many carry the name Lied f√ºr Klavier (Song for Piano), analogous to Felix's Lieder ohne Worte (Songs Without Words). This style of piano music was most successfully developed by Felix, whose first set (Op. 19b) appeared in 1829‚Äì30, with a second set (Op. 30) appearing in 1833‚Äì34. Fanny's sets of Lieder f√ºr Klavier were written in the period 1836‚Äì1837, at about the same time as Felix's set Op. 38.Mace (2013) p. 118Song (2016), pp. 5‚Äì7 Title page of first edition of Fanny Hensel's Op. 1, 1846 The majority of Fanny Mendelssohn's compositions are limited to lieder and piano pieces as she felt her abilities did not extend to larger, more intricate compositions. She was also undoubtedly hampered by the fact that, unlike her brother, she had never studied or played any string instruments, experience which would have assisted her in writing chamber or orchestral works.Reich (1991), pp. 93‚Äì4 After completing her string quartet, she wrote to Felix in 1835, \\"I lack the ability to sustain ideas properly and give them the needed consistency. Therefore lieder suit me best, in which, if need be, merely a pretty idea without much potential for development can suffice.\\"Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 174. She was an early example of women composers of a string quartet; she had also earlier written, with the assistance of Zelter, a piano quartet in 1822 (her first large-scale work), and, despite her reservations in her letter to Felix, she wrote in her last year a piano trio (Op. 11).Todd (2003), pp. 104, 542‚Äì544 Amongst her works is the Easter Sonata written in 1828, which was unpublished in her lifetime, then discovered and attributed to her brother in 1970, before examination of the manuscript and a mention of the work in her diary finally established in 2010 that the work was hers.Hawkins (2017)https://www.angelamacechristian.com/easter-sonata It was premiered in her name on 8 March 2017, International Women's Day. She also composed in 1841 a cycle of pieces depicting the months of the year, Das Jahr (The Year). The music was written on tinted sheets of paper and illustrated by her husband Wilhelm, with each piece accompanied by a short poem. The writer Kristine Forney has suggested that the poems, artwork and coloured paper may represent the different stages of life, with others suggesting they represent her own life.Forney (2014), p. 177 In a letter from Rome, Fanny described the process behind composing Das Jahr: > I have been composing a good deal lately, and have called my piano pieces > after the names of my favourite haunts, partly because they really came into > my mind at these spots, partly because our pleasant excursions were in my > mind while I was writing them. They will form a delightful souvenir, a kind > of second diary. But do not imagine that I give these names when playing > them in society, they are for home use entirely.Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987) =Style and form= Fanny Hensel's music room in the Hensel house, Leipziger Str. 3, Berlin Angela Mace, the musicologist who proved Fanny Hensel's authorship of the Easter Sonata, considers that Fanny was much more experimental with her lieder than Felix, noting that her works have a \\"harmonic density\\" that serves to express emotion.Mace (2013) p. 10 R. Larry Todd has pointed out that, although there has been much comment about the influence of Felix's music on Fanny (and some comment on that of Fanny on Felix), both were strongly influenced by the later music of Ludwig van Beethoven in terms of form, tonality and fugal counterpoint.Todd (2010), p. 182 This is reflected for example in Fanny's string quartet.Song (2016), p. 1 Musicologist Stephen Rodgers has claimed that the relative lack of analysis of Fanny Hensel's music has left the presence of triple hypermeter in her songs mostly overlooked. He points to this type of meter being used by Mendelssohn to alter the speed of vocals in the song and to reflect emotions through distortion of duple norms.Rogers (2011b), He also points to a lack of tonic harmony as a recurring characteristic of her lieder, identifying it in the lied Verlust as a deliberate means to reflect the song's themes of abandonment and failing to find love. Mendelssohn's use of word painting is also acknowledged as a common element of her style, a method of stressing emotion in the song text.Rogers (2011a), She commonly used strophic form for her songs, and her piano accompaniments frequently doubled the voice-line, characteristics also of the music of her teachers Zelter and Berger.Draper (2012), p. 87 Though the foundation created by her teachers would remain, Rodgers suggests that she increasingly turned to through-composed forms as her style developed, as a way to respond to elements of poetic text.Rogers (2011b) p. 201 Legacy From the 1980s onwards there has been renewed interest in Mendelssohn and her works. =Music= In the six months before his death, Felix attempted to ensure that his sister received the recognition that had been withheld throughout most of her life by collecting many of her works with the intent of releasing them to the public through his publisher, Breitkopf & H√§rtel. In 1850, the publisher began to distribute Fanny Mendelssohn's unreleased works, starting with Vier Lieder Op. 8.Todd (2010), p. 351 Commencing in the late 1980s, Fanny Mendelssohn's music has become better known thanks to concert performances and new recordings.https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs- transcripts-and-maps/hensel-fanny-mendelssohn Examples from this period include recordings of the Gartenlieder, Op. 3 (CPO, 1986); Piano Trio in D, Op. 11 (Hyperion, 1989);https://www.hyperion- records.co.uk/dc.asp?dc=D_CDH55078 and Piano Music for Four Hands (Sony, 1992),March, Ivan; Edward Greenfield; Robert Layton; Paul Czajkowski (1999). The Penguin Guide to Compact Discs. London: Penguin. p.858-859 each of which received positive reviews in mainstream publications. Numerous recordings have continued to be made since this period. Her Easter Sonata for piano, formerly attributed to Felix, was premiered in her name on 8 March 2017, International Women's Day. =Writings= Fanny Mendelssohn published no writings during her lifetime. Selected letters and journal entries were published during the 19th century, notably by Sebastian Hensel in his book on the Mendelssohn family. Her collected letters to Felix, edited by Marcia Citron, were published in 1987.Mendelssohn (Hensel) 1987 =Biographical and musicological studies= During the 19th century Fanny mainly figured as a bystander in biographies and studies of her brother Felix; typically she was a representative of a supposed 'feminizing' influence that sapped his artistry.Kimber (2004), pp. 48-49 In the 20th century the conventional narrative switched to presenting Felix as disapproving of his sister's musical activities and seeking to contain them, whilst the 'feminizing' accusation against Fanny evaporated.Kimber (2004), pp. 49-50 From the 1980s onwards Fanny Mendelssohn has been the subject of many academic books and articles.See bibliography in Mace Christian (2018) Kimber opines that \\"The tale of Fanny, the 'suppressed' composer, has so readily found a place in the biographies of the siblings because of its resemblance to prevailing models for the life of a 'Great Composer' [...] based in Romantic ideology about male artists [....] Hensel fits neatly into a traditional narrative of the suffering artistic genius [...] with a modern twist: the feminine gender of its main character. Thus two characters [Felix and Fanny] are forced to bear the weight of two centuries of gender ideology.\\"Kimber (2004), p. 52 =Museum= The Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum, which is dedicated to the lives and work of Fanny Mendelssohn and her brother Felix, opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.

He was known for developing the theory of complex multiplication of abelian varieties and Shimura varieties, as well as posing the Taniyama‚ÄìShimura conjecture which ultimately led to the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Biography Gor≈ç Shimura was born in Hamamatsu, Japan, on 23 February 1930. Shimura graduated with a B.A. in mathematics and a D.Sc. in mathematics from the University of Tokyo in 1952 and 1958 respectively. After graduating, Shimura became a lecturer at the University of Tokyo, then worked abroad ‚Äî including ten months in Paris and a seven-month stint at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study ‚Äî before returning to Tokyo, where he married Chikako Ishiguro. He then moved from Tokyo to join the faculty of Osaka University, but growing unhappy with his funding situation, he decided to seek employment in the United States. Through Andr√© Weil he obtained a position at Princeton University itself. Shimura joined the Princeton faculty in 1964 and retired in 1999, during which time he advised over 28 doctoral students and received the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1970, the Cole Prize for number theory in 1977, the Asahi Prize in 1991, and the Steele Prize for lifetime achievement in 1996. Shimura described his approach to mathematics as \\"phenomenological\\": his interest was in finding new types of interesting behavior in the theory of automorphic forms. He also argued for a \\"romantic\\" approach, something he found lacking in the younger generation of mathematicians. Shimura used a two-part process for research, using one desk in his home dedicated to working on new research in the mornings and a second desk for perfecting papers in the afternoon. Shimura had two children, Tomoko and Haru, with his wife Chikako. Shimura died on 3 May 2019 in Princeton, New Jersey at the age of 89. Research Shimura was a colleague and a friend of Yutaka Taniyama, with whom he wrote the first book on the complex multiplication of abelian varieties and formulated the Taniyama‚ÄìShimura conjecture. Shimura then wrote a long series of major papers, extending the phenomena found in the theory of complex multiplication of elliptic curves and the theory of modular forms to higher dimensions (e.g. Shimura varieties). This work provided examples for which the equivalence between motivic and automorphic L-functions postulated in the Langlands program could be tested: automorphic forms realized in the cohomology of a Shimura variety have a construction that attaches Galois representations to them. In 1958, Shimura generalized the initial work of Martin Eichler on the Eichler‚ÄìShimura congruence relation between the local L-function of a modular curve and the eigenvalues of Hecke operators. In 1959, Shimura extended the work of Eichler on the Eichler‚ÄìShimura isomorphism between Eichler cohomology groups and spaces of cusp forms which would be used in Pierre Deligne's proof of the Weil conjectures. In 1971, Shimura's work on explicit class field theory in the spirit of Kronecker's Jugendtraum resulted in his proof of Shimura's reciprocity law. In 1973, Shimura established the Shimura correspondence between modular forms of half integral weight k+1/2, and modular forms of even weight 2k. Shimura's formulation of the Taniyama‚ÄìShimura conjecture (later known as the modularity theorem) in the 1950s played a key role in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles in 1995. In 1990, Kenneth Ribet proved Ribet's theorem which demonstrated that Fermat's Last Theorem followed from the semistable case of this conjecture. Shimura dryly commented that his first reaction on hearing of Andrew Wiles's proof of the semistable case was 'I told you so'. Other interests His hobbies were shogi problems of extreme length and collecting Imari porcelain. The Story of Imari: The Symbols and Mysteries of Antique Japanese Porcelain is a non-fiction work about the Imari porcelain that he collected over 30 years that was published by Ten Speed Press in 2008.

A logical fallacy of the questionable cause variety, it is subtly different from the fallacy cum hoc ergo propter hoc (\\"with this, therefore because of this\\"), in which two events occur simultaneously or the chronological ordering is insignificant or unknown. Post hoc is a particularly tempting error because correlation appears to suggest causality. The fallacy lies in a conclusion based solely on the order of events, rather than taking into account other factors potentially responsible for the result that might rule out the connection. A simple example is \\"the rooster crows immediately before sunrise; therefore the rooster causes the sun to rise.\\"  Pattern  The form of the post hoc fallacy is expressed as follows: :* A occurred, then B occurred. :* Therefore, A caused B. When B is undesirable, this pattern is often combined with the formal fallacy of denying the antecedent, assuming the logical inverse holds: Avoiding A will prevent B.  Examples  * A tenant moves into an apartment and the building's furnace develops a fault. The manager blames the tenant's arrival for the malfunction. One event merely followed the other, in the absence of causality. * The Brazilian footballer Pel√© is said to have blamed a dip in his playing performance on having given a fan a specific playing shirt; after getting the shirt back his performance recovered.

The festivals may occur on May Day (May 1) or Pentecost (Whitsun), although in some countries it is instead erected at Midsummer. In some cases the maypole is a permanent feature that is only utilised during the festival, although in other cases it is erected specifically for the purpose before being taken down again. Primarily found within the nations of Germanic Europe and the neighbouring areas which they have influenced, its origins remain unknown. It has often been speculated that the maypole originally had some importance in the Germanic paganism of Iron Age and early Medieval cultures, and that the tradition survived Christianisation, albeit losing any original meaning that it had. It has been a recorded practice in many parts of Europe throughout the Medieval and Early Modern periods, although it became less popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, the tradition is still observed in some parts of Europe and among European communities in the Americas. Symbolism May Day: villagers near Munich lift a very tall maypole into place English historian Ronald Hutton concurs with Swedish scholar Carl Wilhelm von Sydow who stated that maypoles were erected \\"simply\\" as \\"signs that the happy season of warmth and comfort had returned.\\" Their shape allowed for garlands to be hung from them and were first seen, at least in the British Isles, between AD 1350 and 1400 within the context of medieval Christian European culture. In 1588, at Holy Trinity Church in Exeter, villagers gathered around the 'summer rod' for feasting and drinking. Chaucer mentions that a particularly large maypole stood at St Andrew Undershaft, which was collectively erected by church parishioners annually due to its large shape. The symbolism of the maypole has been continuously debated by folklorists for centuries, although no definitive answer has been found. Some scholars classify maypoles as symbols of the world axis (axis mundi). The fact that they were found primarily in areas of Germanic Europe, where, prior to Christianisation, Germanic paganism was followed in various forms, has led to speculation by some that the maypoles were in some way a relic of a Germanic pagan tradition. One theory holds that they were a remnant of the Germanic reverence for sacred trees, as there is evidence for various sacred trees and wooden pillars that were venerated by the pagans across much of Germanic Europe, including Thor's Oak and the Irminsul. Ronald Hutton, however, states that \\"there is absolutely no evidence that the maypole was regarded as a reflection of it.\\" It is also known that, in Norse paganism, cosmological views held that the universe was a world tree, known as Yggdrasil. Some observers have proposed phallic symbolism, an idea which was expressed by Thomas Hobbes, who erroneously believed that the poles dated back to the Roman worship of the god Priapus. This notion has been supported by various figures since, including the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. Phallic symbolism has been attributed to the maypole in the later Early Modern period, as one sexual reference is in John Cleland's controversial novel Fanny Hill: > ... and now, disengag'd from the shirt, I saw, with wonder and surprise, > what? not the play-thing of a boy, not the weapon of a man, but a maypole of > so enormous a standard, that had proportions been observ'd, it must have > belong'd to a young giant. Ronald Hutton has stated, however, that \\"there is no historical basis for his claim, and no sign that the people who used maypoles thought that they were phallic\\" and that \\"they were not carved to appear so.\\" The anthropologist Mircea Eliade theorizes that the maypoles were simply a part of the general rejoicing at the return of summer, and the growth of new vegetation. In this way, they bore similarities with the May Day garlands which were also a common festival practice in Britain and Ireland. Regional traditions =Malta= Remains of the kukkanja in situ, in which the maypole was inserted Grand Master Marc'Antonio Zondadari introduced the game of cockaigne (with the use of the maypole) to Maltese Carnival in 1721: on a given signal, the crowd assembled in Palace Square converged on a collection of hams, sausages and live animals hidden beneath leafy branches outside the Main Guard. The provisions became the property of those who, having seized them, were able to carry them off. =Germany and Austria= Maypole in Weingarten (Baden) Rhenish maypole for a girl in K√∂nigswinter In Germany and Austria the maypole (or Maibaum) is a tradition going back to the 16th century. It is a decorated tree or tree trunk that is usually erected either on 1 May ‚Äì in Baden and Swabia ‚Äì or on the evening before, for example, in East Frisia. In most areas, especially in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Bavaria and Austria, it is usual to have a ceremony to erect the maypole on the village green. The custom of combining it with a village or town fete, that usually takes place on 30 April, 1 May or at Pentecost (Whitsun), is widespread. This tradition is especially strong in the villages of the Bavarian Alps where the raising of the traditional maypole on 1 May in the village square is a cause for much celebration. The pole is usually painted in the Bavarian colours of white and blue and decorated with emblems depicting local crafts and industry. In Bavaria the Maibaum is erected several weeks before May 1st. The young men from the villages try to steal the Maibaum from an other, which is why the men of each village or city take turns in watching over the Maibaum. If a village manages to steal a Maibaum, then the village the Maibaum has been stolen from has to invite the whole village of the thieves to free beer and a festivity which then takes place on May 1st. Just before the Maibaum is erected, depending on the region, there may be a procession through the village, usually ending up at a central place and/or restaurant and usually watched by crowds of spectators and accompanied by a brass band. The actual installation of the tree then takes place in the afternoon or evening. While the crowds usually while away the time drinking beer and eating sausages, the young men busy themselves with decorating the maypole to get the symbols of various trades representing the region into the right position. While the maypole is traditionally set up with the help of long poles, today it may sometime also be done using tractors, forklifts or even cranes. In Lower Austria ropes and ladders are used. In the Rhineland in and around Cologne, there exists a somewhat different maypole tradition. During the night before 1 May, unmarried men erect young birch trees in front of the houses of their sweethearts. These trees, which may reach five metres of height or more, are sold beforehand by local foresters. The men usually decorate them with multicoloured crepe paper and often with a red heart of wood with the name of the girl written on it. During the month of May, many house front gardens have such maypoles. If the tree is erected on the eve of 1 May, then the event is usually followed by a May dance or Tanz in den Mai. Depending on local custom, the Maibaum may remain in place all year round or may be taken down at the end of May. The trunk may then be stored until the following year. =Nordics= In Denmark the maypole tradition is almost extinct but is still observed on the islands of Avernak√∏ and Stryn√∏ south of Funen and in a few villages in southern Himmerland in eastern Jutland. The maypole is generally referred to as a majtr√¶, \\"May tree\\". In Sweden and Swedish speaking parts of Finland, the maypole is usually called a midsummer pole, (), as it appears at the Midsummer celebrations, although the literal translation majst√•ng also occurs, where the word maj refers to the old Swedish word maja which means dress and not to the month of May. The traditions surrounding the maypoles vary locally, as does the design of the poles, although the design featuring a cross and two rings is most common nowadays. A perhaps more original incarnation is the one still in use in the Swedish landscape of Sm√•land where the pole carries a large horizontally suspended ring around it, hanging from ropes attached at the top of the pole. This perhaps more original form of course strongly reinforces the procreation symbolism. The cross-arm may be a latter-day attempt to Christianize the pagan symbol into the semblance of a cross, although not completely successful. Common in all of Sweden are traditional ring dances, mostly in the form of dances where you are alternating dancing and making movements and gestures based on the songs, such as pretending that you are scrubbing laundry while singing about washing, or jumping as frogs during the song Sm√• grodorna (\\"The little frogs\\"). The ring dancing is mostly popular with small children. The central part played by young children in the celebration emphasize the procreation aspect of the celebration. Yet another pointer in this direction is the custom that young maidens expect to dream of their future mate if they pick seven different flowers and place them under their pillow when they go to bed on this day only. File:Maypole erection valje 1.jpg File:Maypole erection valje 2.jpg File:Maypole erection valje 3.jpg File:Maypole erection valje 4.jpg File:Maypole erection valje 5.jpg =Belgium= In Belgium, the Maypole is called Meiboom or Meyboom in Dutch. Hasselt erects its Meiboom on April 30. In Brussels and Leuven, the Meyboom is traditionally erected on August 9 before 17:00. The planting of the Meyboom is the cause of a friendly rivalry between the two cities, dating back to 1213. In that year, a brawl broke out between Leuven and Brussels which saw the latter victorious. To commemorate this event, the city of Brussels was granted, almost 100 years later, the eternal right by John III, Duke of Brabant to erect a Meyboom, but only if they managed to do this every year on August 9 before 17:00. A first attempt by Leuven to steal the tree in 1939 was stopped by the police. In 1974 however, a group of Leuven men found out which tree was chosen by Brussels as that year's Meyboom. During the night of August 8, the tree was cut down and transported to Leuven where it was erected in front of the City Hall. Ever since, Leuven claims ownership of the only official Meyboom. Brussels, however, denies having lost the right, as another tree was cut down and put up before 17:00 on August 9. It is also customary, mostly in the Dutch-speaking region of Belgium, to place a branch (also called a Meiboom) on the highest point of a building under construction. The erection of the branch is often cause for celebration by both the workmen and the neighbours. =Britain= A maypole at Llanfyllin, Wales on May 1, 1941 In Britain the maypole was found primarily in England and in areas of the Scottish Lowlands and Wales which were under English influence. However, the earliest recorded evidence comes from a Welsh poem written by Gryffydd ap Adda ap Dafydd in the mid-14th century, in which he described how people used a tall birch pole at Llanidloes, central Wales. Literary evidence for maypole use across much of Britain increases in later decades, and \\"by the period 1350-1400 the custom was well established across southern Britain, in town and country and in both Welsh-speaking and English-speaking areas.\\" Ickwell Green, Bedfordshire at dawn on 1 May 2005 The practice had become increasingly popular throughout the ensuing centuries, with the maypoles becoming \\"communal symbols\\" that brought the local community together - in some cases, poorer parishes would join up with neighbouring ones in order to obtain and erect one, whilst in other cases, such as in Hertfordshire in 1602 and Warwickshire in 1639, people stole the poles of neighbouring communities, leading to violence. In some cases the wood for the pole was obtained illegally, for instance in 1603, the earl of Huntingdon was angered when trees were removed from his estates for use as maypoles without his permission. The maypole at Barwick-in-Elmet, Yorkshire, which is lowered, refurbished and raised every three years. The rise of Protestantism in the 16th century led to increasing disapproval of maypoles and other May Day practices from various Protestants who viewed them as idolatry and therefore immoral. Under the reign of Edward VI in England and Wales, the Protestant Anglicanism was declared to be the state religion, and under the Reformation many maypoles, such as the famous Cornhill maypole of London, were destroyed; however when Mary I ascended the throne after Edward's death, she reinstated Roman Catholicism as the state faith, and the practice of maypoles was reinstated. Under later English monarchs, the practice was sporadic, being banned in certain areas, such as Doncaster, Canterbury and Bristol, but continuing in many others, according to the wishes of the local governors. In Scotland meanwhile, which at this time was still an independent state, Protestantism, in the form of Presbyterianism, had taken a more powerful hold, and largely wiped out the practice of maypoles across the country. That royal support contributed to the outlawing of maypole displays and dancing during the English Interregnum. The Long Parliament's ordinance of 1644 described maypoles as \\"a Heathenish vanity, generally abused to superstition and wickedness.\\" The only recorded breach of the Long Parliament's prohibition was in 1655 in Henley-in-Arden, where local officials stopped the erection of maypoles for traditional games. Scholars suspect, but have no way to prove, that the lack of such records indicates official connivance in flouting of the prohibition. However, they are certain that the prohibition turned maypole dancing into a symbol of resistance to the Long Parliament and to the republic that followed it. The church of St Andrew Undershaft in the City of London is named after the maypole that was kept under its eaves and set up each spring until 1517 when student riots put an end to the custom. The maypole itself survived until 1547 when a Puritan mob seized and destroyed it as a \\"pagan idol\\". May Day celebrations, banned under the Commonwealth, were revived in 1660. The maypole at Castle Bytham, Lincolnshire, was inscribed to commemorate the date when it was later cut in half for use as a ladder When the Restoration occurred in 1660, common people in London, in particular, put up maypoles \\"at every crossway,\\" according to John Aubrey. The largest was the Maypole in the Strand, near the current St Mary-le-Strand church. The maypole there was the tallest by far, reaching over a hundred and thirty feet, and it stood until being blown over by a high wind in 1672, when it was moved to Wansted in Essex and served as a mount for the telescope of Sir Isaac Newton. In the countryside, may dances and maypoles appeared sporadically even during the Interregnum, but the practice was revived substantially and joyously after the Restoration. By the 19th century, the maypole had been subsumed into the symbology of \\"Merry England\\". The addition of intertwining ribbons seems to have been influenced by a combination of 19th century theatrical fashion and visionary individuals such as John Ruskin in the 19th century. However, the maypole remained an anti- religious symbol to some theologians, as shown by \\"The Two Babylons\\", an anti- Catholic conspiracist pamphlet that first appeared in 1853. As revived, the dance is performed by pairs of boys and girls (or men and women) who stand alternately around the base of the pole, each holding the end of a ribbon. They weave in and around each other, boys going one way and girls going the other and the ribbons are woven together around the pole until the merry- makers meet at the base. There are also more complex dances for set numbers of (practised) dancers (the May Queen dancing troupes) involving complicated weaves and unweaves, but they are not well known today. However, such dances are performed every Mayday around the permanent Maypole at Offenham, in Worcestershire. Temporary Maypoles are usually erected on village greens and events are often supervised by local Morris dancing groups. In some regions, a somewhat different Maypole tradition existed: the carrying of highly decorated sticks. The sticks had hoops or cross-sticks or swags attached, covered with flowers, greenery or artificial materials such as crepe paper. Children would take these hand-held poles to school on May Day morning and prizes may be awarded for the most impressive. This tradition is known as garlanding, and was a central feature of Mayday celebrations in central and southern England until the mid-19th century. After that time, it began to be replaced by formally organised school-centred celebrations. It still occurs from place to place but is invariably a reinstatement of a local custom that had lapsed decades earlier. In 1780, Kilmarnock Council, now in East Ayrshire, paid Robert Fraser 2s. 6d. for dressing a Maypole, one of the last recorded examples of the rural festival of the first of May in Scotland, having been put down by Act of Parliament immediately after the Reformation in 1560. The tallest maypoles in Britain may be found in the villages of Nun Monkton, North Yorkshire (), Barwick-in-Elmet, West Yorkshire (), and Welford-on-Avon, Warwickshire (). =United States= Tuxedo Park, United States Brentwood Maypole tradition originated when Archer School for Girls was still the Eastern Star Home. Children swinging on a maypole in Golden Rule Park in Toledo, Ohio, 1900s While not celebrated among the general public in the United States today, a Maypole Dance nearly identical to that celebrated in the United Kingdom is an important part of May Day celebrations in local schools and communities . Often the Maypole dance will be accompanied by other dances as part of a presentation to the public. The earliest use of the Maypole in America occurred in 1628, where William Bradford, governor of New Plymouth, wrote of an incident where a number of servants, together with the aid of an agent, broke free from their indentured service to create their own colony, setting up a maypole in the center of the settlement, and behaving in such a way as to receive the scorn and disapproval of the nearby colonies, as well as an officer of the king, bearing patent for the state of Massachusetts. Bradford writes: > They also set up a May-pole, drinking and dancing about it many days > togaether, inviting the Indean women, for their consorts, dancing and > frisking togither, (like so many fairies, or furies rather,) and worse > practises. As if they had anew revived & celebrated the feasts of the Roman > Goddess Flora, or the beasly practieses of the madd Bacchinalians. Morton > likwise (to shew his poetrie) composed sundry rimes & verses, some tending > to lasciviousnes, and others to the detraction & scandall of some persons, > which he affixed to this idle or idoll May-polle. They changed also the name > of their place, and instead of calling it Mounte Wollaston, they call it > Merie-mounte, as if this joylity would have lasted ever. But this continued > not long, for after Morton was sent for England, shortly after came over > that worthy gentleman, Mr. John Indecott, who brought a patent under the > broad seall, for the governmente of the Massachusetts, who visiting those > parts caused the May-polle to be cutt downe, and rebuked them for their > profannes, and admonished them to looke ther should be better walking; so > they now, or others, changed the name of their place againe, and called it > Mounte-Dagon. Governor Bradford's censure of the Maypole tradition played a central role in Nathaniel Hawthorne's fictional story \\"The Maypole of Merry Mount\\", 1837. = Italy = A traditional 'red' maypole in Ascoli Piceno, Italy Maypole traditions can be found in some parts of the country, e.g. in Veneto, Friuli, Umbria and Marche. In the last of these regions, the tradition dates back to the Napoleonic campaigns, when the arbre de la libert√© (Liberty tree), the symbol of the French Revolution, arrived in Italy. Liberty trees were erected in the southern part of the region in Ripatransone and Ascoli Piceno. In 1889, the first congress of the Second International, met in Paris for the centennial of the French Revolution and the Exposition Universelle. A proposal by Raymond Lavigne, called for international demonstrations on the 1890 anniversary of the Chicago protests. After the institution of the International Workers' Day the maypole rite in southern part of the Marche became a socialist ritual. At the top of the tree (poplar) appeared the red flag. In the second half of the 20th century the rite of the maypole around Ascoli remained a rite of celebration of spring but it became also a political symbol of the peasant movement (mezzadri) that struggled against the landowners to have decent living conditions. Every year, even today, on the night of 30 April, in many villages of the zone like Appignano del Tronto, Arquata del Tronto, Ascoli Piceno, Castorano, Castignano, Castel di Lama, Colli del Tronto, Grottammare, Monsampolo del Tronto, Porchia (Montalto Marche), Monteprandone, Offida, Rotella, Spinetoli, San Benedetto del Tronto, citizens cut a poplar on which they put-up a red flag and the tree is erected in village squares or at crossroads. The same ritual is known from Lamon, a village in the Dolomites in Veneto, where however it is likely it predates the Napoleonic period. Here, a number of quarters and hamlets erect a maypole in the form of a larch whose branches and bark are almost completely removed. Only the top branches are left. A red flag is normally attached, although Italian flags or flags of other countries (Colombia, Bolivia for example) or artists (Bob Marley) are also attested. Around the maypole, quarters and hamlets give feasts with music, food and alcohol which usually last until the dawn of the 1st of May. The maypole is locally called 'Majo' (May in the local dialect). = Canada = Maypole dance during F√™te de la Reine in Quebec, Canada, 24 May 1934 In Canada, maypole dances are sometimes done as part of Victoria Day celebrations which occur in May. In New Westminster, British Columbia, dancing around the may pole and May Day celebrations have been held for 149 years. In literature Poet Jonathan Swift in his poem \\"A Maypole\\" describes a maypole as: \\"The May-Pole of Merry Mount\\" is a short story by Nathaniel Hawthorne. It first appeared in The Token and Atlantic Souvenir in 1832. The story revolves around a young couple feeling influence of nature and natural influence gets betrothed in presence of a Maypole and how do they face puritan ire. Hawthorne based his story on events in colonial New England history, borrowing from a story of Thomas Mortan whose settlement opposed the rigid cultural and religious standards of the Plymouth colony puritans.

Jordan was educated in Lyon, and from an early age was imbued with royalist principles. He actively supported by voice, pen, and musket his native town in its resistance to the Convention, and when Lyon fell, in October 1793, Jordan fled. From Switzerland he passed in six months to England, where he formed acquaintances with other French exiles and with prominent British statesmen, and imbibed a lasting admiration for the English Constitution. In 1796 he returned to France, and next year he was sent by Lyon as a deputy to the Council of the Five Hundred. There, his eloquence won him consideration. He earnestly supported what he felt to be true freedom, especially in matters of religious worship, though the energetic appeal on behalf of church bells in his Rapport sur la libert√© des cultes procured him the sobriquet of \\"Jordan- Cloche\\". Proscribed at the coup d'√©tat of the 18th Fructidor (4 September 1797), he escaped to Basel. Thence he went to Germany, where he met Goethe. Back again in France by 1800, he boldly published in 1802 his Vrai sens du vote national pour le consulat √† vie, in which he exposed the ambitious schemes of Bonaparte. He was unmolested, however, and during the First Empire lived in literary retirement at Lyon with his wife and family, producing for the Lyon academy occasional papers on the Influence r√©ciproque de l'√©loquence sur la R√©volution et de la R√©volution sur l'√©loquence; Etudes sur Klopstock, etc. At the restoration in 1814, he again emerged into public life. By Louis XVIII he was ennobled and named a councillor of state; and from 1816 he sat in the chamber of deputies as representative of Am. At first, he supported the ministry, but when they began to show signs of reaction, he separated from them, and gradually came to be at the head of the constitutional opposition. His speeches in the chamber were always eloquent and powerful. Though warned by failing health to resign, Camille Jordan remained at his post till his death at Paris, on 19 May 1821.

The American Eskimo Dog is a member of the Spitz family. The breed's progenitors were German Spitz, but due to anti-German sentiment during the First World War, it was renamed \\"American Eskimo Dog.\\" Although modern American Eskimo Dogs have been exported as German Spitz Gross (or Mittel, depending on the dog's height), the breeds have diverged and the standards are significantly different. In addition to serving as a watchdog and companion, the American Eskimo Dog also achieved a high degree of popularity in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s as a circus performer. There are three size varieties of the American Eskimo Dog breed, the toy, the miniature and the standard. They share a common resemblance with Japanese Spitz, Danish Spitz, Volpino Italiano, German Spitz and Samoyed. History English painter Thomas Gainsborough (1727‚Äì1788) painted ‚ÄúThe Morning Walk‚Äù depicting Mr. and Mrs. Hallet, accompanied by their White Spitz, a breed which is amongst the ancestors of the American Eskimo Dog. The American Eskimo Dog was originally bred to guard people and property and, therefore, is territorial by nature and a valiant watchdog. It is not considered an aggressive breed but, due to its watchdog history, American Eskimo dogs are generally quite vocal, barking at any stranger who comes in proximity to their owners' territory. In Northern Europe, smaller Spitz were eventually developed into the various German Spitz breeds. European immigrants brought their Spitz pets with them to the United States, especially New York, in the early 1900s, \\"all of them descended from the larger German Spitz, the Keeshond, the white Pomeranian, and the Italian Spitz, the Volpino Italiano.\\" Although white was not always a recognized color in the various German Spitz breeds, it was generally the preferred color in the US. In a display of patriotism in the era around World War I, dog owners began referring to their pets as American Spitz rather than German Spitz.Choron, Sandra (2005) Planet Dog, Mariner Books, p. 163, After World War I, the small Spitz dogs came to the attention of the American public when the dogs became popular entertainers in the American circus. In 1917, the Cooper Brothers‚Äô Railroad Circus featured the dogs.Cooper Brother's Railroad Circus . Circushistory.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-22. A dog named Stout's Pal Pierre was famous for walking a tightrope with the Barnum and Bailey Circus in the 1930s, and also contributing to their popularity, they sold puppies after the show. Due to the popularity of the circus dogs, many of today's American Eskimo Dogs can trace their lineage back to these circus dogs. American Eskimo Dog portrait. After World War II, the dogs continued to be popular pets. Postwar contact with Japan led to importation into the United States of the Japanese Spitz, which may have been crossed into the breed at this time. The breed was first officially recognized as the \\"American Eskimo\\" as early as 1919 by the American United Kennel Club (UKC), and the first written record and history of the breed was printed in 1958 by the UKC.Breed History NAEDA (earliest records were lost in a fire) At that time there was no official breed club and no breed standard, and dogs were accepted for registration as single dogs, based on appearance. In 1970 the National American Eskimo Dog Association (NAEDA) was founded, and single dog registrations ceased. In 1985 the American Eskimo Dog Club of America (AEDCA) was formed by fanciers who wished to register the breed with the American Kennel Club (AKC). Following the AKC's requirements for breed recognition, the AEDCA collected the pedigree information from 1,750 dogs that now form the basis of the AKC recognized breed, which is called the American Eskimo Dog. The breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1995. The stud book was opened from 2000 to 2003 in an attempt to register more of the original UKC registered lines, and today many American Eskimo Dogs are dual-registered with both American kennel clubs. The breed is also recognized by the Canadian Kennel Club as of 2006,Recognition Of The American Eskimo Dog. Ckc.ca. Retrieved on 2013-08-22. but is not recognized elsewhere in the world The American Eskimo Dog is not entirely an internationally recognized breed, and since neither of the American kennel clubs are affiliated with the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale, fanciers wishing to participate in certain international dog shows will register their American Eskimo Dogs as the very similar German Spitz. This is done only by individuals wishing to participate in dog sports in international shows, and does not mean that the American Eskimo Dog and the German Spitz are the same. Although the American Eskimo is known as the German Spitz in several countries outside of the United States, the two breeds have actually developed somewhat differently since the American Eskimo was relocated to North America, over a century ago. It is not uncommon for German Spitz breeders to incorporate imported American Eskimo bloodlines into their breeding program to broaden the gene pool, and vice versa. Health The American Eskimo is a hardy breed with an average life span of 12‚Äì15 years. This breed tends to become overweight easily, so proper diet and exercise is needed to maintain an overall well being. Health testing should be performed by all responsible breeders and anyone purchasing a puppy should be aware of the genetic problems which have been found in some individuals of the breed, such as PRA (progressive retinal atrophy), luxating patella, and hip dysplasia. None of these problems are common and the breed is generally very healthy.American Eskimo Dog . Webvet.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-22. In addition to the rarer problems mentioned, the breed can have a tendency towards allergies and most commonly, tear-staining. This breed also is known in some cases to have dental issues.Tear Stains. Eskiedog.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-22. American Eskimo Dog. Temperament The American Eskimo is an affectionate, loving dog. The breed is easy to train and they are excellent with children because of the dog's high intelligence and its willingness to please. American Eskimos often rank among the top scorers in obedience trials. They like to work. Naturally wary of strangers, once properly introduced, they become friends. American Eskimos are highly intelligent, inquisitive and love to investigate. Without enough mental and physical exercise, they can become hyperactive and high-strung, spinning in circles. They are not always recommended for first-time dog owners, but with some advice from a trainer, can be a great pet. The American Kennel Club standard states: > The American Eskimo Dog is intelligent, alert, and friendly, although > slightly conservative. It is never overly shy nor aggressive, and such dogs > are to be severely penalized in the show ring. At home it is an excellent > watchdog, sounding a warning bark to announce the arrival of any stranger. > It is protective of its home and family, although it does not threaten to > bite or attack people.

Charles Fran√ßois Marie, Comte de R√©musat (13 March 1797 - 6 June 1875), was a French politician and writer. Biography He was born in Paris. His father, Auguste Laurent, Comte de R√©musat, of a good family of Toulouse, was chamberlain to Napoleon Bonaparte, but acquiesced in the restoration and became prefect first of Haute Garonne, and then of Nord. Charles' mother was Claire √âlisabeth Jeanne Gravier de Vergennes, Madame de R√©musat, born in 1780. She married at sixteen, and was attached to the Empress Josephine as dame du palais in 1802. Talleyrand was among her admirers, and she was generally regarded as a woman of great intellectual capacity and personal grace. After her death (1824), her Essai sur l'√©ducation des femmes was published and received academic approval, but it was not until her grandson, Paul de R√©musat, published her M√©moires (3 vols., Paris, 1879‚Äì80), which followed by some correspondence with her son (2 vols., 1881), that justice could be done to her literary talent. Claire's memoirs threw light not only on the Napoleonic court, but also on the youth and education of her son Charles. He developed political views more liberal than those of his parents, and, being brought up for a career in law, he published in 1820 a pamphlet on trial by jury. He was an active journalist, showing in philosophy and literature the influence of Victor Cousin, and is said to have furnished to no small extent the original of Honor√© de Balzac's character, Henri de Marsay. He signed the journalists' protest against the Ordinances of July 1830, and in the following October was elected deputy for Haute Garonne. Becoming a Doctrinaire, he supported most of those measures of restriction on popular liberty which made the July monarchy unpopular with French Radicals. In 1836 he became for a short time undersecretary of state for the interior. He then became an ally of Adolphe Thiers, and in 1840 held the ministry of the interior for a brief period. In the same year he became an Academician. For the rest of Louis Philippe's reign he was in opposition until he joined in his attempt at a ministry in the spring of 1848. During this time R√©musat constantly spoke in the chair here, but was still more active in literature, especially on philosophical subjects, the most remarkable of his works being his book on Pierre Ab√©lard (2 vols., 1845). He had to leave France after the coup d'√©tat; nor did he re-enter political life during the Second Empire until 1869, when he founded a moderate opposition journal at Toulouse. Neither the Revolution of 1848 nor the Second Empire was to his taste. Eventually he gave up hope for the restoration of constitutional monarchy in France and he declared himself in favor of the Third French Republic: \\"I have never desired anything else than the peaceful triumph of the great principles of the French Revolution. I hoped that the monarchy would bring it forth; today I put my hopes in the Republic, firmly maintained and wisely organized.\\" In 1871 he refused the Vienna embassy offered him by , but in August he was appointed minister of foreign affairs in succession to Jules Favre. Although minister he was not a deputy, and on standing for Paris in September 1873 he was beaten by D√©sir√© Barodet. A month later he was elected (having already resigned with ) for Haute Garonne by a great majority. He died in Paris. During his abstention from politics R√©musat continued to write on philosophical history, especially English. Saint Anselme de Cantorb√©ry appeared in 1854; L'Angleterre au ... son temps, etc., in 1858; John Wesley in 1870; Lord Herbert de Cherbury in 1874; Histoire de la philosophie en Angleterre depuis Bacon jusqu'√† Locke in 1875; besides other and minor works. He wrote well, was a forcible speaker and an acute critic; but his adoption of the indeterminate eclecticism of Victor Cousin in philosophy and of the somewhat similarly indeterminate liberalism of in politics probably limited his powers, though both no doubt accorded with his critical and unenthusiastic turn of mind. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1873.

The Blancmange curve, the graph of a nowhere- differentiable but uniformly continuous function, is also called the Takagi curve after his work on it.  Biography  He was born in the rural area of the Gifu Prefecture, Japan. He began learning mathematics in middle school, reading texts in English since none were available in Japanese. After attending a high school for gifted students, he went on to the University of Tokyo, at that time the only university in Japan. There he learned mathematics from such European classic texts as Salmon's Algebra and Weber's Lehrbuch der Algebra. Aided by Hilbert, he then studied at G√∂ttingen. Aside from his work in algebraic number theory he wrote a great number of Japanese textbooks on mathematics and geometry. During World War I, he was isolated from European mathematicians and developed his existence theorem in class field theory, building on the work of Heinrich Weber. As an Invited Speaker, he presented a synopsis of this research in a talk Sur quelques th√©oremes g√©n√©raux de la th√©orie des nombres alg√©briques at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Strasbourg in 1920. There he found little recognition of the value of his research, since algebraic number theory was then studied mainly in Germany and German mathematicians were excluded from the Congress. Takagi published his theory in the same year in the journal of the University of Tokyo. However, the significance of Takagi's work was first recognized by Emil Artin in 1922, and was again pointed out by Carl Ludwig Siegel, and at the same time by Helmut Hasse, who lectured in Kiel in 1923 on class field theory and presented Takagi's work in a lecture at the meeting of the DMV in 1925 in Danzig and in his Klassenk√∂rperbericht (class field report) in the 1926 annual report of the DMV. Takagi was then internationally recognized as one of the world's leading number theorists. In 1932 he was vice-president of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich and in 1936 was a member of the selection committee for the first Fields Medal. He was also instrumental during World War II in the development of Japanese encryption systems; see Purple. Family * Sigekatu Kuroda - son-in-law. Mathematician. * S.-Y.

The program was carefully written to avoid damaging existing file or directory structures, and to avoid copying itself if permissions did not exist or if harm would result. Its spread was halted by an OS upgrade that changed the format of the file status tables PERVADE used. Though non-malicious, \\"Pervading Animal\\" represents the first Trojan \\"in the wild\\". * The novel The Shockwave Rider by John Brunner is published, coining the word \\"worm\\" to describe a program that propagates itself through a computer network.  1981‚Äì1989  = 1981 = * A program called Elk Cloner, written for Apple II systems, was created by high school student Richard Skrenta, originally as a prank. The Apple II was particularly vulnerable due to the storage of its operating system on a floppy disk. Elk Cloner's design combined with public ignorance about what malware was and how to protect against it led to Elk Cloner being responsible for the first large-scale computer virus outbreak in history. = 1983 = * November: The term \\"virus\\" is re-coined by Frederick B. Cohen in describing self-replicating computer programs. In 1984 Cohen uses the phrase \\"computer virus\\" (suggested by his teacher Leonard Adleman) to describe the operation of such programs in terms of \\"infection\\". He defines a \\"virus\\" as \\"a program that can 'infect' other programs by modifying them to include a possibly evolved copy of itself.\\" Cohen demonstrates a virus-like program on a VAX11/750 system at Lehigh University. The program could install itself in, or infect, other system objects. = 1984 = * August: Ken Thompson publishes his seminal paper, Reflections on Trusting Trust, in which he describes how he modified a C compiler so that when used to compile a specific version of the Unix operating system, it inserts a backdoor into the login command, and when used to compile a new copy of itself, it inserts the backdoor insertion code, even if neither the backdoor nor the backdoor insertion code is present in the source code of this new copy. = 1986 = * January: The Brain boot sector virus is released. Brain is considered the first IBM PC compatible virus, and the program responsible for the first IBM PC compatible virus epidemic.

Chameleon series debuted with the release of 1260. * June: The Form computer virus is isolated in Switzerland. It would remain in the wild for almost 20 years and reappear afterward; during the 1990s it tended to be the most common virus in the wild with 20 to more than 50 percent of reported infections. = 1992 = * March: The Michelangelo virus was expected to create a digital apocalypse on March 6, with millions of computers having their information wiped, according to mass media hysteria surrounding the virus. Later assessments of the damage showed the aftermath to be minimal. John McAfee had been quoted by the media as saying that 5 million computers would be affected. He later said that pressed by the interviewer to come up with a number, he had estimated a range from 5 thousand to 5 million, but the media naturally went with just the higher number. = 1993 = * \\"Leandro\\" or \\"Leandro & Kelly\\"\\"Leandro\\", Threat Encyclopedia, Trend Micro, 9 March 2000.

The nebula glows primarily by light reflected from Rigel, located just outside the top right corner of the image. Fine dust in the nebula reflects the light. The blue color is caused not only by Rigel's blue color but because the dust grains reflect blue light more efficiently than red. In astronomy, reflection nebulae are clouds of interstellar dust which might reflect the light of a nearby star or stars. The energy from the nearby stars is insufficient to ionize the gas of the nebula to create an emission nebula, but is enough to give sufficient scattering to make the dust visible. Thus, the frequency spectrum shown by reflection nebulae is similar to that of the illuminating stars. Among the microscopic particles responsible for the scattering are carbon compounds (e. g. diamond dust) and compounds of other elements such as iron and nickel. The latter two are often aligned with the galactic magnetic field and cause the scattered light to be slightly polarized.Kaler, 1997. Discovery Reflection nebula IC 2631. Reflection Nebula vdB1 Analyzing the spectrum of the nebula associated with the star Merope in the Pleiades, Vesto Slipher concluded in 1912 that the source of its light is most likely the star itself, and that the nebula reflects light from the star (and that of the star Alcyone). Calculations by Ejnar Hertzsprung in 1913 lend credence to that hypothesis. Edwin Hubble further distinguished between the emission and reflection nebulae in 1922. Reflection nebulae are usually blue because the scattering is more efficient for blue light than red (this is the same scattering process that gives us blue skies and red sunsets). Reflection nebulae and emission nebulae are often seen together and are sometimes both referred to as diffuse nebulae. Some 500 reflection nebulae are known. A blue reflection nebula can also be seen in the same area of the sky as the Trifid Nebula. The giant star Antares, which is very red (spectral class M1), is surrounded by a large, red reflection nebula. Reflection nebulae may also be the site of star formation. Luminosity law Cosmic dust clouds in Messier 78. In 1922, Edwin Hubble published the result of his investigations on bright nebulae. One part of this work is the Hubble luminosity law for reflection nebulae, which makes a relationship between the angular size (R) of the nebula and the apparent magnitude (m) of the associated star: :5 log(R) = -m + k where k is a constant that depends on the sensitivity of the measurement.

This dramatically reduces the amount of the highly toxic and very expensive osmium tetroxide needed. These four reagents are commercially available premixed (\\"AD-mix\\"). The mixture containing (DHQ)2-PHAL is called AD-mix-Œ±, and the mixture containing (DHQD)2-PHAL is called AD-mix-Œ≤. Such chiral diols are important in organic synthesis. The introduction of chirality into nonchiral reactants through usage of chiral catalysts is an important concept in organic synthesis. This reaction was developed principally by K. Barry Sharpless building on the already known racemic Upjohn dihydroxylation, for which he was awarded a share of the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.  Background  Alkene dihydroxylation by osmium tetroxide is an old and extremely useful method for the functionalization of olefins. However, since osmium(VIII) reagents like osmium tetroxide (OsO4) are expensive and extremely toxic, it has become desirable to develop catalytic variants of this reaction. Some stoichiometric terminal oxidants that have been employed in these catalytic reactions include potassium chlorate, hydrogen peroxide (Milas hydroxylation), N-Methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO, Upjohn dihydroxylation), tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP), and potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6). K. Barry Sharpless was the first to develop a general, reliable enantioselective alkene dihydroxylation, referred to as the Sharpless Asymmetric Dihydroxylation (SAD). Low levels of OsO4 are combined with a stoichiometric ferricyanide oxidant in the presence of chiral nitrogenous ligands to create an asymmetric environment around the oxidant.  Reaction mechanism  The reaction mechanism of the Sharpless dihydroxylation begins with the formation of the osmium tetroxide ‚Äì ligand complex (2). A [3+2]-cycloaddition with the alkene (3) gives the cyclic intermediate 4. Basic hydrolysis liberates the diol (5) and the reduced osmate (6). Methanesulfonamide (CH3SO2NH2) has been identified as a catalyst to accelerate this step of the catalytic cycle and if frequently used as an additive to allow non-terminal alkene substrates to react efficiently at 0 ¬∞C. Finally, the stoichiometric oxidant regenerates the osmium tetroxide ‚Äì ligand complex (2). The reaction mechanism of the Sharpless dihydroxylation The mechanism of the Sharpless Asymmetric Dihydroxylation has been extensively studied and a potential secondary catalytic cycle has been identified (see below). If the osmylate ester intermediate is oxidized before it dissociates, then an osmium(VIII)-diol complex is formed which may then dihydroxylate another alkene.Sundermeier, U., Dobler, C., Beller, M. Recent developments in the osmium-catalyzed dihydroxylation of olefins. Modern Oxidation Methods. 2004 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA,Weinheim. Dihydroxylations resulting from this secondary pathway generally suffer lower enantioselectivities than those resulting from the primary pathway. A schematic showing this secondary catalytic pathway is shown below. This secondary pathway may be suppressed by using a higher molar concentration of ligand. Catalytic cycle of the Sharpless Asymmetric Dihydroxylation =[2+2] vs [3+2] debate= In his original report Sharpless suggested the reaction proceeded via a [2+2] cycloaddition of OsO4 onto the alkene to give an osmaoxetane intermediate (see below). This intermediate would then undergo a 1,1- migratory insertion to form an osmylate ester which after hydrolysis would give the corresponding diol. In 1989 E. J. Corey published a slightly different variant of this reaction and suggested that the reaction most likely proceeded via a [3+2] cycloaddition of OsO4 with the alkene to directly generate the osmylate ester. Corey's suggestion was based on a previous computational study done by Jorgensen and Hoffman which determined the [3+2] reaction pathway to be the lower energy pathway. In addition Corey reasoned that steric repulsions in the octahedral intermediate would disfavor the [2+2] pathway. Osmium tetroxide dihydroxylation proposed and correct mechanism The next ten years saw numerous publications by both Corey and Sharpless, each supporting their own version of the mechanism. While these studies were not able to distinguish between the two proposed cyclization pathways, they were successful in shedding light on the mechanism in other ways. For example, Sharpless provided evidence for the reaction proceeding via a step-wise mechanism.Thomas, G.; Sharpless, K. B. ACIEE 1993, 32, 1329 Additionally both Sharpless and Corey showed that the active catalyst possesses a U-shaped chiral binding pocket. Corey also showed that the catalyst obeys Michaelis- Menten kinetics and acts like an enzyme pocket with a pre-equilibrium. In the February 1997 issue of the Journal of the American Chemical Society Sharpless published the results of a study (a Hammett analysis) which he claimed supported a [2+2] cyclization over a [3+2]. In the October issue of the same year, however, Sharpless also published the results of another study conducted in collaboration with Ken Houk and Singleton which provided conclusive evidence for the [3+2] mechanism. Thus Sharpless was forced to concede the decade-long debate. = Catalyst structure = Allyl benzoate bound within the U-shaped binding pocket of the active dihydroquinidine catalyst, osmium tetroxide interacting with the Re face. Crystallographic evidence has shown that the active catalyst possesses a pentacoordinate osmium species held in a U-shaped binding pocket. The nitrogenous ligand holds OsO4 in a chiral environment making approach of one side of the olefin sterically hindered while the other is not.  Catalytic Systems  Numerous catalytic systems and modifications have been developed for the SAD. Given below is a brief overview of the various components of the catalytic system: # Catalytic Oxidant: This is always OsO4, however certain additives can coordinate to the osmium(VIII) and modify its electronic properties. OsO4 is often generated in situ from K2OsO2(OH)4 (an Os(VI) species) due to safety concerns. # Chiral Auxiliary: This is usually some kind of cinchona alkaloid. # Stoichiometric Oxidant: #* Peroxides were among the first stoichiometric oxidants to be used in this catalytic cycle; see the Milas hydroxylation. Drawbacks of peroxides include chemoselectivity issues. #* Trialkylammonium N-oxides, such as NMO‚Äîas in the Upjohn Reaction‚Äîand trimethylamine N-oxide. #* Potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6) is the most commonly used stoichiometric oxidant for the reaction, and is the oxidant that comes in the commercially available AD-mix preparations. # Additive: #* Citric acid: Osmium tetroxide is an electrophilic oxidant and as such reacts slowly with electron-deficient olefins. It has been found that the rate of oxidation of electron-deficient olefins can be accelerated by maintaining the pH of the reaction slightly acidic. On the other hand, a high pH can increase the rate of oxidation of internal olefins, and also increase the enantiomeric excess (e.e.) for the oxidation of terminal olefins.  Regioselectivity  In general Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation favors oxidation of the more electron-rich alkene (scheme 1). SAD scheme 1 In this example SAD gives the diol of the alkene closest to the (electron-withdrawing) para-methoxybenzoyl group, albeit in low yield. This is likely due to the ability of the aryl ring to interact favorably with the active site of the catalyst via œÄ-stacking. In this manner the aryl substituent can act as a directing group. SAD scheme 2  Stereoselectivity  The diastereoselectivity of SAD is set primarily by the choice of ligand (i.e. AD-mix-Œ± versus AD-mix-Œ≤), however factors such as pre-existing chirality in the substrate or neighboring functional groups may also play a role. In the example shown below, the para-methoxybenzoyl substituent serves primarily as a source of steric bulk to allow the catalyst to differentiate the two faces of the alkene. SAD scheme 3 It is often difficult to obtain high diastereoselectivity on cis-alkenes when both sides of the olefin have similar steric environments.

Migration to Canada or the United States by Russian Germans (German: Deutsche aus Russland or Russlanddeutsche; Russian: –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ –Ω–µ–º—Ü—ã, russkiye nemtsy) peaked in the late 19th century. The upper Great Plains of the United States and southern Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan in Canada have large areas populated primarily by descendants of Germans from Russia. Their mother tongues were High German or Low German dialects, despite ethnic German communities having existed in Russia for many generations. Russian Germans frequently lived in distinct communities, where they maintained German- language schools and German churches. They were primarily Volga Germans from the lower Volga River valley, Black Sea Germans from the Crimean Peninsula/Black Sea region, or Volhynian Germans from the governorate of Volhynia in contemporary Ukraine. The smaller villages were often settled by colonists of a common religious denomination, who had come from the same area, so one town might be made up of German-speaking Catholics, Lutherans or German Jews, for instance; the people often settled together from the same region of Germany and thus spoke the same German dialect. Also included were Germans of the Mennonite faiths (today mostly referred to as Russian Mennonite despite of their German language culture and ethnicity), and also Hutterites seeking religious freedom. Originally recruited and welcomed into Russia in the 18th century, when they were promised the practice of their own language and religions, and exemption from military service, the German people found increasing hardship. With changes in Russian politics, the government took back some of the privileges granted; economic conditions grew poor, and there were a series of famines. These conditions led to German mass migrations from Russia. After the 1917 Revolution and the rise of the Soviet Union, and particularly under the leadership of Joseph Stalin, conditions for the remaining Germans in Russia declined considerably. The rise of Nazi Germany, with its concern about ethnic Germans in other lands and proselytizing the German volk, led to suspicions of any German within Russia. In 1932-33, the Soviet authorities forced starvation among the Volga Germans, seized their food claiming famine in the rest of the Soviet Union and ordering the breakup of many German villages.Koch, Fred C. (1977). The Volga Germans: In Russia and the Americas, from 1763 to the Present, pp. 281-82. The Pennsylvania State University. After the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, Stalin ordered the deportation of Russian Germans to labor camps in Siberia and Central Asia, as he was suspicious of potential collaboration with the Germans.Rappaport, Helen (1999). Joseph Stalin: A Biographical Companion, p. 191. ABC-CLIO, Inc. In some areas, his forces attempted to bulldoze the German churches, and reused their tombstones for paving blocks. Many Germans in the Americas sent donations back to their communities, but others permanently lost contact with their relatives during the social disruption of the famine and Stalin's Great Purge, followed by World War II. Areas of immigration  Unlike many other immigrants to the Americas during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Germans from Russia wanted to continue farming and settled in agricultural areas rather than industrial cities. Primary areas were the Plains states of Illinois, Nebraska, Kansas, North and South Dakota, with some movement to specific areas of Washington and California (Fresno and Lodi for instance) in the United States; Saskatchewan and Manitoba of Canada; and Brazil and Argentina.http://www.ahsgr.org/faq.htm#5 These areas tended to resemble the flat plains of the Russian steppes. In addition, the upper Great Plains still had arable land available for free settlement under the Homestead Act. In the 2000 Census, North Dakota reported 43.9% of the population identified as having German ancestry. In 1910, 5% of the population of North Dakota had been born in Russia; it is likely most were ethnic Germans. Large-scale immigration to the Americas started in the 1870s and continued until the 1917 Revolution, when travel and emigration were stopped.http://www.ahsgr.org/faq.htm#4 https://wiki.familysearch.org/en/Germans_from_Russia_Emigration_and_Immigration Since the reunification of Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall and declining conditions in Russia, many ethnic Germans still living in the lands of the former Soviet Union sought German repatriation. United States: Volga Germans Temporary quarters for Volga Germans in central Kansas, 1875 Germans from Russia were the most traditional of German-speaking arrivals. About 100,000 Volga Germans immigrated by 1900, settling primarily in the Dakotas, Kansas and Nebraska. The south-central part of North Dakota was known as \\"the German-Russian triangle\\". A smaller number moved farther west, finding employment as ranchers and cowboys. The largest groups settled mainly in the Great Plains: North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas and nearby areas in the US. Outside that area, they also settled in Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, and Fresno County in California's Central Valley. They often succeeded in dryland farming, which they had practiced in Russia. Many of the immigrants who arrived between 1870 and 1912 spent a period doing farm labor, especially in northeastern Colorado and in Montana along the lower Yellowstone River in sugar beet fields. Their family and community lifestyle, and contribution to the sugar beet industry on the plains of Colorado is well-documented in \\"Work Renders Life Sweet: Germans from Russia in Fort Collins, 1900 - 2000\\". https://www.fcgov.com/historicpreservation/pdf/german-russia-doc.pdf They were often sugar beet farmers most everywhere they settled - Nebraska, southern Michigan, Colorado, and Fresno, California. =Cities= Other Volga Germans made new lives in the industrializing American cities, especially Chicago, which had an immense upsurge in immigration from Eastern Europe during this time. Today Chicago has the largest number of ethnic Volga Germans in North America. The largest area of concentrated settlement was in Jefferson Park on the city's Northwest Side, mostly between the years 1907-1920. By 1930, 450 families of the Evangelical faith were living in this area, most of whom originated from Wiesenseite.\\"German Russians in Chicagoland\\", Newsletter, March 1995, American Historical Society of Germans from Russia Later during the period of suburbanization, many of their descendants moved out to outlying areas such as Maywood and Melrose Park. A number of families living in the Jefferson Park central business district along Lawrence and Milwaukee Avenue have Volga German immigrant ancestors. During the first two decades of the 20th century, the Chicago neighborhood of Jefferson Park was the point of initial settlement for many Volga German immigrants =Wheat= Bernhard Warkentin was born in a small Russian village in 1847, and travelled to America in his early twenties. Interested in flour mills, he was especially impressed with the wheat-growing possibilities in the United States. After visiting Kansas, Warkentin found the Great Plains much like those he had left behind. Settling in Harvey County, he built a water mill on the banks of the Little Arkansas River ‚Äì the Halstead Milling and Elevator Company. Warkentin's greatest contribution to Kansas was the introduction of hard Turkey Wheat into Kansas, which replaced the soft variety grown exclusively in the state. =Culture= Negatively influenced by the violation of their rights and cultural persecution by the Tsar, the Germans from Russia who settled in the northern Midwest saw themselves a downtrodden ethnic group separate from Russian Americans and having an entirely different experience from the German Americans who had immigrated from German lands; they settled in tight-knit communities that retained their German language and culture. They raised large families, built German-style churches, buried their dead in distinctive cemeteries using cast iron grave markers, and created choir groups that sang German church hymns. Many farmers specialized in sugar beets‚Äîstill a major crop in the upper Great Plains. During World War I their identity was challenged by anti-German sentiment. Actors from Germany in film \\"Als der Tod ins Leben wuchs\\" of Sebastian Ed Erhenberg as Volga Germans, Sanok 2013 By the end of the World War II, the German language, which had always been used with English for public and official matters, was in serious decline. Today German is preserved mainly through singing groups and recipes, with the Germans from Russia in the northern Great Plains states speaking predominantly English. German remains the second most spoken language in North and South Dakota, and Germans from Russia sometimes use loanwords, such as Kuchen for cake, although the word is primarily used for the sweet bread dessert made in a pie plate with topping like fruits or cottage cheese. This latter kind of Kuchen has been the state dessert of South Dakota since 2013. kuchen Despite the loss of their language, the ethnic group remains distinct and has left a lasting impression on the American West.Elwyn B. Robinson, History of North Dakota (1966) pp. 285-87, 557; Gordon L. Iseminger, \\"Are We Germans, or Russians, or Americans? The McIntosh County German-Russians During World War I\\", North Dakota History 1992 59(2): 2-16. =Memory= During the 1970s, Dr. Kenneth Rock, a professor of history at Colorado State University, collected sixty oral histories of German Russian immigrants and their descendants as part of the \\"Germans from Russia in Colorado\\" Study Project. It documented life in the ethnic German communities in Russia, the immigration experience, work and social life in the United States, and interaction between the German-Russian communities and the wider society in both Russia and the United States. They were often described as looking like Russians, but sounding like Germans. Approximately one million descendants of Germans from Russia live in the United States.Chronology: The Germans in America (European Reading Room, Library of Congress) Modern descendants in Canada and the United States refer to their heritage as Germans from Russia, Russian Germans, Volgadeutsch or Black Sea Germans. In many parts of the United States, they tend to have blended to a large degree with the \\"regular\\" German Americans who are much more numerous in the northern half of the United States. Canada =Background= In addition to the large population of Volga Germans that settled on the American prairie, many also settled in the Canadian West. Beginning in the early 1870s, the Canadian Government had created promotional programs in Europe to entice settlers to the largely unsettled western areas, in what would become Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and British Columbia.HEIER, EDMUND. ‚ÄúThe Immigration of the Russo-German Catholics and Lutherans into Canada.‚Äù Canadian Slavonic Papers / Revue Canadienne Des Slavistes 4 (January 1, 1959): 160‚Äì175. doi:10.2307/40866073. Public policy also served to attract immigration following the passage of the Land Act of 1872, which provided free grants of homesteads to those who settled on the Western Prairie. In the early twentieth century, many immigrants moved from the United States to Canada in search of inexpensive land, and still greater social autonomy.Peters, Victor. ‚ÄúRu√ülanddeutsche in Der Kanadischen Pr√§ire.‚Äù Globus Spezial (n.d.): 191‚Äì192. These German-American immigrants brought not only their experience working on the American plains, but had also accrued wealth, giving a much needed boost to the economy of the Western Provinces. =1875-1918= The Volga Germans that flocked to Canada in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries came from different religious backgrounds including Lutheran, Catholic, and Mennonite. It was this last group, named after leader Menno Simons, that constituted the largest portion of the immigrant population. In Russia they had proven the best organized, preparing scouting parties to investigate the prospect of immigration to Canada and the United States. These scouts had been reliant on the assistance of established Mennonite groups such as those found in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and Ontario. In the period 1873-1879, Mennonites formed blocked settlements in Manitoba with a total of close to 7000 members. Most settled in Southern Manitoba in the richest part of the Red River Valley.Haslam, J. H. ‚ÄúThe Canadianization of the Immigrant Settler.‚Äù Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 107 (May 1, 1923): 45‚Äì49. doi:10.2307/1014693. These communities were centered around religious homogeneity, and insistence on the tenets of adult baptism, and the refusal to bear arms or swear an oath.Moelleken, Wolfgang W. ‚ÄúDiaphonic Correspondences in the Low German of Mennonites from the Fraser Valley, British Columbia.‚Äù Zeitschrift f√ºr Mundartforschung 34, no. 3/4 (December 1, 1967): 240‚Äì253. doi:10.2307/40500396. Many Mennonites had been propelled to leave because of the introduction of extended conscription, put in place in 1874, but set to take effect in Russia in 1881. Many Volga Germans emigrated from the United States to the Western Provinces in the period 1890-1909. They sought to escape rising land prices, and imposition of laws that began to encroach on their relative autonomy. Canada was seen as a new frontier, a place of vast land, but little settlement. These immigrants settled mainly in the colonies of St. Peter and St. Joseph, East and West of Saskatoon in Central Saskatchewan. In the 1890s, twelve Catholic families established Rastadt-Dorf, and another twenty-one settled Katherinetal. Additional settlements were begun in Davin, Kronau, and Speyer as well.Anderson, Alan B. ‚ÄúSt. Joseph‚Äôs Colony, Katherinetal Colony, Kronau-Rastadt, and Odessa (1886-1904).‚Äù German Settlements in Saskatchewan: The Origin and Development of German Catholic, Lutheran, Baptist, Mennonite, and Huttere Communities (n.d.). =Between the World Wars= In the period between World War I and World War II, conditions in Russia worsened, especially following the Revolution and the Great Famine of 1921. Many Volga Germans sought to leave the USSR, but faced opposition from a government that did not wish to see so large a portion of its population leave. The Russian government imposed a fee for obtaining a passport, which led to protests as many would-be immigrants flooded the streets of Moscow. Many Mennonites were eventually able to leave, and between the World Wars, over 20,000 left destined for Canada. Beginning in the second decade of the twentieth century, and continuing until several years after the Second World War, the ethnic background of the Volga Germans made them prey to discrimination. By 1914, Germany had become Canada's enemy, and the Volga Germans were not immune despite many families having not set foot in Germany for hundreds of years. This period saw the suppression of many German cultural customs, including the suppression of their print media, and the closure of German schools. The Wartime Elections Act, passed in September 1917, revoked the citizenship of any German naturalized after March, 1902. Many settlements were renamed to disguise their obvious German origin.https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/germans The 1920s period also saw the movement of Volga Germans within Western Canada as well. Many pushed further west, settling in British Columbia. The area had the appeal of a warmer climate, an escape from the frigid prairie. Other Volga Germans were propelled by economic factors such as the Great Depression, which not only impoverished many, but also coincided with a tremendous drought ushering in crop failures. The economy of the Prairie Provinces, and much of Canada, was dependent on the success of wheat farming. Wheat had been a staple crop for the Volga Germans in Russia, and translated well to the climate of the Canadian West. Repeated crop failures meant a large influx of the German- Russian population into larger cities and towns, a fact that would contribute to the gradual decline of their culturally homogeneous communities. The prairie lands abutting the United States border experienced Dust Bowl conditions, which sent swarms of families to the coastal areas of British Columbia.Friesen, Gerald (1987). The Canadian Prairies: A History (Student ed.). Toronto and London: University of Toronto Press. pp. 383‚Äì417. Throughout the period following World War II, new immigrants joined their families in British Columbia, congregating in the Fraser Valley, and Vancouver Island.Goerz, H. ‚ÄúGerman Russians in British Columbia, Canada,‚Äù n.d. The mid- twentieth century brought immigrants from South American regions, namely Argentina and Brazil, as they fought to maintain their cultural autonomy in increasingly nationalist areas, dominated by nationalist leaders like Juan Per√≥n.Koch, Fred C. The Volga Germans: In Russia and the Americas, from 1763 to the Present. Penn State Press, 1978. Lutheran and Catholic Volga Germans were also significant migrants to Canada, but lacked the organization of their Mennonite brethren. Early on, these immigrants were more likely to settle in Saskatchewan, especially around the city of Regina. Despite their location near earlier Mennonite communities, settlements remained religiously homogenous. =Legacy= Throughout their history in the Canadian West, the Volga Germans have been able to maintain many of their cultural characteristics, including their dialect, proliferated through Saturday schools and Canadian policies that allowed for cultural freedom. These schools operated on Saturday mornings for around three hours, and became especially vital as the German language was no longer taught in the Canadian public school system after World War I. The Mennonites, unlike most Volga Germans, were able to maintain these schools even after World War II. The dialect of the Volga Germans was also maintained through the Church, especially in the Mennonite community.Magocsi, Paul Robert. Encyclopedia of Canada‚Äôs Peoples. University of Toronto Press, 1999. Before the Volga Germans had left for North America they had been regarded as privileged colonists in Russia. When they arrived in the United States and Canada they found that they were treated the same as any other Eastern European migrant group.Kloberdanz, Timothy J. ‚ÄúThe Volga Germans in Old Russia and in Western North America: Their Changing World View.‚Äù Anthropological Quarterly 48, no. 4 (October 1, 1975): 209‚Äì222. doi:10.2307/3316632. The Mennonites may be seen as an exception as they successfully used connections with their brethren in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and Ontario. Through their hard work on the North American plains, they established themselves as a productive portion of Canadian and American society. Language  The Germans from Russia originally spoke German dialects such as the Palatine dialect or Mennonite Low German (Plautdietsch) at home. Since the villages in Russia often were populated by settlers from a particular region and were isolated from Germany, they maintained their regional dialects. Depending on their specific dialect, Germans from Russia had difficulties understanding Standard German, because German dialects in general differ greatly from the standard language. After emigrating from Russia to the Americas the Germans still spoke with their German dialects. In the 1950s it was still common for the children in the Dakotas to speak in English and the parents and grandparents to use German. Songs in church would be sung in two languages simultaneously.

An emission nebula is a nebula formed of ionized gases that emit light of various wavelengths. The most common source of ionization is high-energy ultraviolet photons emitted from a nearby hot star. Among the several different types of emission nebulae are H II regions, in which star formation is taking place and young, massive stars are the source of the ionizing photons; and planetary nebulae, in which a dying star has thrown off its outer layers, with the exposed hot core then ionizing them. General information Usually, a young star will ionize part of the same cloud from which it was born, although only massive, hot stars can release sufficient energy to ionize a significant part of a cloud. In many emission nebulae, an entire cluster of young stars is doing the work. The nebula's color depends on its chemical composition and degree of ionization. Due to the prevalence of hydrogen in interstellar gas, and its relatively low energy of ionization, many emission nebulae appear red due to the strong emissions of the Balmer series. If more energy is available, other elements will be ionized and green and blue nebulae become possible. By examining the spectra of nebulae, astronomers infer their chemical content. Most emission nebulae are about 90% hydrogen, with the remaining helium, oxygen, nitrogen, and other elements. Some of the most prominent emission nebulae visible from the northern hemisphere are the North America Nebula (NGC 7000) and Veil Nebula NGC 6960/6992 in Cygnus, while in the south celestial hemisphere, the Lagoon Nebula M8 / NGC 6523 in Sagittarius and the Orion Nebula M42. Further in the southern hemisphere is the bright Carina Nebula NGC 3372. Emission nebulae often have dark areas in them which result from clouds of dust which block the light. Many nebulae are made up of both reflection and emission components such as the Trifid Nebula.

Thus, a gravitational field is used to explain gravitational phenomena, and is measured in newtons per kilogram (N/kg). In its original concept, gravity was a force between point masses. Following Isaac Newton, Pierre-Simon Laplace attempted to model gravity as some kind of radiation field or fluid, and since the 19th century explanations for gravity have usually been taught in terms of a field model, rather than a point attraction. In a field model, rather than two particles attracting each other, the particles distort spacetime via their mass, and this distortion is what is perceived and measured as a \\"force\\". In such a model one states that matter moves in certain ways in response to the curvature of spacetime, and that there is either no gravitational force, or that gravity is a fictitious force. Gravity is distinguished from other forces by its obedience to the equivalence principle. Classical mechanics In classical mechanics, a gravitational field is a physical quantity. A gravitational field can be defined using Newton's law of universal gravitation. Determined in this way, the gravitational field around a single particle of mass is a vector field consisting at every point of a vector pointing directly towards the particle. The magnitude of the field at every point is calculated applying the universal law, and represents the force per unit mass on any object at that point in space. Because the force field is conservative, there is a scalar potential energy per unit mass, , at each point in space associated with the force fields; this is called gravitational potential. The gravitational field equation is :\\\\mathbf{g}=\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{F}}{m}=\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^2\\\\mathbf{R}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t^2}=-GM\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat R}}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{R}\\\\right^2}=- abla\\\\Phi where is the gravitational force, is the mass of the test particle, is the position of the test particle (or for the second Newton's law of motion which is a time dependent function, a set of positions of test particles each occupying a particular point in space for the start of testing), is a unit vector in the radial direction of , is time, is the gravitational constant, and is the del operator. This includes Newton's law of universal gravitation, and the relation between gravitational potential and field acceleration. Note that and are both equal to the gravitational acceleration (equivalent to the inertial acceleration, so same mathematical form, but also defined as gravitational force per unit mass). The negative signs are inserted since the force acts antiparallel to the displacement. The equivalent field equation in terms of mass density of the attracting mass is: : abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{g}=- abla^2\\\\Phi=-4\\\\pi G\\\\rho which contains Gauss's law for gravity, and Poisson's equation for gravity. Newton's and Gauss's law are mathematically equivalent, and are related by the divergence theorem. These classical equations are differential equations of motion for a test particle in the presence of a gravitational field, i.e. setting up and solving these equations allows the motion of a test mass to be determined and described. The field around multiple particles is simply the vector sum of the fields around each individual particle. An object in such a field will experience a force that equals the vector sum of the forces it would experience in these individual fields. This is mathematically :\\\\mathbf{g}_j^\\\\text{(net)} =\\\\sum_{i e j}\\\\mathbf{g}_i =\\\\frac{1}{m_j}\\\\sum_{i e j}\\\\mathbf{F}_i = -G\\\\sum_{i e j}m_i\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat R}_{ij}}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{R}_i-\\\\mathbf{R}_j\\\\right^2} =-\\\\sum_{i e j} abla\\\\Phi_i i.e. the gravitational field on mass is the sum of all gravitational fields due to all other masses mi, except the mass itself. The unit vector is in the direction of . General relativity In general relativity, the Christoffel symbols play the role of the gravitational force field and the metric tensor plays the role of the gravitational potential. In general relativity, the gravitational field is determined by solving the Einstein field equations : \\\\mathbf{G}=\\\\kappa\\\\mathbf{T} , where is the stress‚Äìenergy tensor, is the Einstein tensor, and is the Einstein gravitational constant. The latter is defined as , where is the Newtonian constant of gravitation and is the speed of light. These equations are dependent on the distribution of matter and energy in a region of space, unlike Newtonian gravity, which is dependent only on the distribution of matter. The fields themselves in general relativity represent the curvature of spacetime. General relativity states that being in a region of curved space is equivalent to accelerating up the gradient of the field. By Newton's second law, this will cause an object to experience a fictitious force if it is held still with respect to the field. This is why a person will feel himself pulled down by the force of gravity while standing still on the Earth's surface. In general the gravitational fields predicted by general relativity differ in their effects only slightly from those predicted by classical mechanics, but there are a number of easily verifiable differences, one of the most well known being the deflection of light in such fields.

It was the first adaptation of TSR's Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D;) fantasy role-playing game for home computers, becoming the first episode in a four-part series of D&D; computer adventure games. The other games in the \\"Gold Box\\" series used the game engine pioneered in Pool of Radiance, as did later D&D; titles such as the Neverwinter Nights online game. Pool of Radiance takes place in the Forgotten Realms fantasy setting, with the action centered in and around the port city of Phlan. Just as in traditional D&D; games, the player starts by building a party of up to six characters, deciding the race, sex, class, and ability scores for each. The player's party is enlisted to help the settled part of the city by clearing out the marauding inhabitants that have taken over the surroundings. The characters move on from one area to another, battling bands of enemies as they go and ultimately confronting the powerful leader of the evil forces. During play, the player characters gain experience points, which allow them to increase their capabilities. The game primarily uses a first- person perspective, with the screen divided into sections to display pertinent textual information. During combat sequences, the display switches to a top- down \\"video game isometric\\" view. Generally well received by the gaming press, Pool of Radiance won the Origins Award for \\"Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1988\\". Some reviewers criticized the game's similarities to other contemporary games and its slowness in places, but praised the game's graphics and its role-playing adventure and combat aspects. Also well-regarded was the ability to export player characters from Pool of Radiance to subsequent SSI games in the series. Gameplay Pool of Radiance is based on the same game mechanics as the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rule set. As in many role-playing games (RPGs), each player character in Pool of Radiance has a character race and a character class, determined at the beginning of the game. Six races are offered, including elves and halflings, as well as four classes (fighter, cleric, wizard, and thief). Non-human characters have the option to become multi-classed, which means they gain the capabilities of more than one class, but advance in levels more slowly. During character creation, the computer randomly generates statistics for each character, although the player can alter these attributes. The player also chooses each character's alignment, or moral philosophy; while the player controls each character's actions, alignment can affect how NPCs view their actions. The player can then customize the appearance and colors of each character's combat icon. Alternatively, the player can load a pre-generated party to be used for introductory play. These characters are combined into a party of six or less, with two slots open for NPCs. Players create their own save-game files, assuring character continuation regardless of events in the game. On an MS-DOS computer, the game can be copied to the hard-disk drive. Other computer systems, such as the Commodore 64, require a separate save-game disk. dragon; the party in combat; exploring the graveyard; sample character view The game's \\"exploration\\" mode uses a three-dimensional first-person perspective, with a rectangle in the top left of the screen displaying the party's current view; the rest of the screen displays text information about the party and the area. During gameplay, the player accesses menus to allow characters to use objects; trade items with other characters; parley with enemies; buy, sell, and pool the characters' money; cast spells, and learn new magic skills. Players can view characters' movement from different angles, including an aerial view. The game uses three different versions of each sprite to indicate differences between short-, medium-, and long-range encounters. In combat mode, the screen changes to a top-down mode with dimetric projection, where the player decides what actions the characters will take in each round. These actions are taken immediately, rather than after all commands have been issued as is standard in some RPGs. Optionally, the player can let the computer choose character moves for each round. Characters and monsters may make an extra attack on a retreating enemy that moves next to them. If a character's hit points (HP) fall below zero, he or she must be bandaged by another character or the character will die. The game contains random encounters, and game reviewers for Dragon magazine observed that random encounters seem to follow standard patterns of encounter tables in pen and paper AD&D; game manuals. They also observed that the depictions of monsters confronting the party \\"looked as though they had jumped from the pages of the Monster Manual.\\" Different combat options are available to characters based on class. For example, fighters can wield melee or ranged weapons; magic-users can cast spells; thieves have the option to \\"back-stab\\" an opponent by strategically positioning themselves. As fighters progress in level, they can attack more than once in a round. Fighters also gain the ability to \\"sweep\\" enemies, effectively attacking each nearby low-level creature in the same turn. Magic- users and clerics are allowed to memorize and cast a set number of spells each day. Once cast, a spell must be memorized again before reuse. The process requires hours of inactivity for all characters, during which they rest in a camp; this also restores lost hit points to damaged characters. This chore of memorizing spells each night significantly added to the amount of game management required by the player. As characters defeat enemies, they gain experience points (XP). After gaining enough XP, the characters \\"train up a level\\" to become more powerful. This training is purchased in special areas within the city walls. In addition to training, mages can learn new spells by transcribing them from scrolls found in the unsettled areas. Defeated enemies in these areas also contain items such as weapons and armor, which characters can sell to city stores. =Copy protection= The MS-DOS, Macintosh and Apple II versions of Pool of Radiance include a 2-ply code wheel for translating elvish and dwarven runes to English. Some dwarven runes have multiple different translations.Pool of Radiance (1988). MS-DOS. Strategic Simulations, Inc. Strategic Simulations, Inc.(1988). Strategic Simulations, Inc. Strategic Simulations, Inc.(1989). Strategic Simulations, Inc. Strategic Simulations, Inc. After the title screen, a copy protection screen is displayed consisting of two runes and a line of varying appearance (a dotted line, a dashed line, or a line with alternating dots and dashes) which correspond to markings on the code wheel. The player is prompted to enter a five or six character code which corresponds to a five or six character word. In the case of a five character word, there is a number at the beginning of the word which is not entered. Under the lines on the wheel are slots which reveal English letters, the coded English word being determined by lining up the runes, matching the correct line appearance, and then entering the word revealed on the code wheel. If the player enters an incorrect code three times, the game closes itself. In the MS-DOS version of Pool of Radiance, the code wheel is also used for some in-game puzzles. For example, in Sokol Keep the player discovers some parchment with elvish runes on it that require use of the code wheel to decipher; this is optional however, but may be used to avoid some combat with undead if the decoded words are said to them. In the NES version, the elvish words are given to the player deciphered without the use of the code wheel, as the NES release did not include a code wheel. Plot =Setting= Once the party reaches the outer confines of Phlan, they can enter the external environment and move about this map. Phlan is located at the outlet of the river near lower center. Pool of Radiance takes place in the Forgotten Realms fantasy world, in and about the city of Phlan. This is located on the northern shore of the Moonsea along the Barren River, between Zhentil Keep and Melvaunt. The party begins in the civilized section of \\"New Phlan\\" that is governed by a council. This portion of the city hosts businesses, including shopkeepers who sell holy items for each temple's worshipers, a jewelry shop, and retailers who provide arms and armor. A party can also contract with the clerk of the city council for various commissions; proclamations fastened to the halls within City Hall offer bits of information to aid the party. These coded clues can be deciphered by using the Adventurer's Journal, included with the game. There are three temples within Phlan, each dedicated to different gods. Each temple can heal those who are wounded, poisoned, or afflicted, and can fully restore deceased comrades for a high price. The party can also visit the hiring hall and hire an experienced NPC adventurer to accompany the party. Encounters with NPCs in shops and taverns offer valuable information. Listening to gossip in taverns can be helpful to characters, although some tavern tales are false and lead characters into great danger. =Plot summary= The ancient trade city of Phlan has fallen into impoverished ruin. Now only a small portion of the city remains inhabited by humans, who are surrounded by evil creatures. To rebuild the city and clean up the Barren River, the city council of New Phlan has decided to recruit adventurers to drive the monsters from the neighboring ruins. Using bards and publications, they spread tales of the riches waiting to be recovered in Phlan, which draws the player's party to these shores by ship. At the start of the game, the adventurers' ship lands in New Phlan, and they receive a brief but informative tour of the civilized area. They learn that the city is plagued with a history of invasions and wars and has been overtaken by a huge band of humanoids and other creatures. Characters hear rumors that a single controlling element is in charge of these forces. The characters begin a block-by-block quest to rid the ruins of monsters and evil spirits. Beyond the ruins of old Phlan, the party enters the slum area‚Äîone of two quests immediately available to new parties. This quest requires the clearing of the slum block and allows a new party to quickly gain experience. The second quest is to clear out Sokol Keep, located on Thorn Island. This fortified area is inhabited by the undead, which can only be defeated with silver weapons and magic. The characters' adventure is later expanded to encompass the outlying areas of the Moonsea region. Eventually, the player learns that an evil spirit named Tyranthraxus, who has possessed an ancient dragon, is at the root of Phlan's problems. The characters fight Tyranthraxus the Flamed One in a climactic final battle.  History  =Development= Pool of Radiance was the first official game based on the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules. The scenario was created by TSR designers Jim Ward, David Cook, Steve Winter, and Mike Breault, and coded by programmers from Strategic Simulations, Inc's Special Projects team. The section of the Forgotten Realms world in which Pool of Radiance takes place was intended to be developed only by SSI. The game was created on Apple II and Commodore 64 computers, taking one year with a team of thirty-five people. This game was the first to use the game engine later used in other SSI D&D; games known as the \\"Gold Box\\" series. The SSI team developing the game was led by Chuck Kroegel. Kroegel stated that the main challenge with the development was interpreting the AD&D; rules to an exact format. Developers also worked to balance the graphics with gameplay to provide a faithful AD&D; feel, given the restrictions of a home computer. In addition to the core AD&D; manuals, the books Unearthed Arcana and Monster Manual II were also used during development. The images of monsters were adapted directly from the Monster Manual book. The game was originally programmed by Keith Brors and Brad Myers, and it was developed by George MacDonald. The game's graphic arts were by Tom Wahl, Fred Butts, Darla Marasco, and Susan Halbleib. Pool of Radiance was released in June 1988; it was initially available on the Commodore 64, Apple II series and IBM PC compatible computers. A version for the Atari ST was also announced. The Macintosh version was released in 1989. The Macintosh version featured a slightly different interface and was intended to work on black-and- white Macs like the Mac Plus and the Mac Classic. The screen was tiled into separate windows including the game screen, text console, and compass. Graphics were monochrome and the display window was relatively small compared to other versions. The Macintosh version featured sound, but no music. The game's Amiga version was released two years later. The PC 9800 version in Japan was fully translated (like the Japanese Famicom version) and featured full-color graphics. The game was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System under the title Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Pool of Radiance, released in April 1992. The NES version was the only version of the game to feature a complete soundtrack, which was composed by Seiji Toda, as he was signed to the publisher, Pony Canyon's record label at the time. The same soundtrack can be found on the PC-9801 version. The Amiga version also features some extra music, while most other ports contain only one song that plays at the title screen. The original Pool of Radiance game shipped with a 28-page introductory booklet, which describes secrets relating to the game and the concepts behind it. The booklet guides players through the character creation process, explaining how to create a party. The game also included the 38-page Adventurer's Journal, which provides the game's background. The booklet features depictions of fliers, maps, and information that characters see in the game. =Sequels and related works= Cover of the Pool of Radiance novel Pool of Radiance was the first in a four-part series of computer D&D; adventures set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. The others were released by SSI one year apart: Curse of the Azure Bonds (1989), Secret of the Silver Blades (1990), and Pools of Darkness (1991). The 1989 game Hillsfar was also created by SSI but was not a sequel to Pool of Radiance. Hillsfar is described instead, by the reviewers of Dragon, as \\"a value-added adventure for those who would like to take a side trip while awaiting the sequel\\". A player can import characters from Pool of Radiance into Hillsfar, although the characters are reduced to their basic levels and do not retain weapons or magical items. Original Hillsfar characters cannot be exported to Pool of Radiance, but they can be exported to Curse of the Azure Bonds. A review for Curse of the Azure Bonds in Computer Gaming World noted that \\"you can transfer your characters from Pool of Radiance and it's a good idea to do so. It will give you a headstart in the game.\\" GameSpot declared that Pool of Radiance, with its detailed art, wide variety of quests and treasure, and tactical combat system, and despite the availability of only four character classes and the low character level cap, \\"ultimately succeeded in its goal of bringing a standardized form of AD&D; to the home computer, and laid the foundation for other future gold box AD&D; role-playing games\\". Scott Battaglia of GameSpy said Pool of Radiance is \\"what many gamers consider to be the epitome of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons RPGs. These games were so great that people today are using MoSlo in droves to slow down their Pentium III-1000 MHz enough to play these gems.\\" In March 2008, Dvice.com listed Pool of Radiance among its 13 best electronic versions of Dungeons & Dragons. The contributor felt that \\"The Pool of Radiance series set the stage for Dungeons & Dragons to make a major splash in the video game world.\\" The 1988 Dungeons & Dragons role- playing game module Ruins of Adventure was produced using the same adventure scenario as Pool of Radiance, using the same plot, background, setting, and many of the same characters as the computer game. The module thus contains useful clues to the successful completion of the computer missions. Ruins of Adventure contains four linked miniscenarios, which form the core of Pool of Radiance. According to the editors of Dragon magazine, Pool of Radiance was based on Ruins of Adventure, and not vice versa. =Novelization= In November 1989 a novelization of Pool of Radiance the video game, also called Pool of Radiance, was written by James Ward and Jane Cooper Hong, published by TSR. The novel is set in the Forgotten Realms setting based on the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game. Dragon described the novel's plot: \\"Five companions find themselves in the unenviable position of defending the soon- to-be ghost town against a rival possessing incredible power.\\" This book was the first in a trilogy, followed by Pools of Darkness and Pool of Twilight. = Re-release = GOG.com released Pool of Radiance and many Gold Box series games digitally on August 20, 2015, as a part of \\"Forgotten Realms: The Archives - Collection Two\\".Forgotten Realms: The Archives brings 13 D&D; classics to GOG on PC Gamer Jordan Erica Webber (Aug 20, 2015)Forgotten Realms: The Archives - Collection Two on gog.com Reception SSI sold 264,536 copies of Pool of Radiance for computers in North America, three times that of Heroes of the Lance, an AD&D-licensed; action game SSI also released that year. It became by far the company's most successful game up to that time; even its hint book outsold any earlier SSI game. It spawned a series of games, which combined to sell above 800,000 copies worldwide by 1996. In Computer Gaming Worlds preview of Pool of Radiance in July 1988, the writer noted a sense of deja vu. He described the similarity of the game's screen to earlier computer RPGs. For example, the three-dimensional maze view in the upper-left window was similar to Might & Magic or Bard's Tale, both released in the mid-1980s. The window with a listing of characters was featured in 1988's Wasteland; and the use of an active character to represent the party was part of Ultima V. The reviewer also noted that the design approach for game play was closer to SSI's own Wizard's Crown than to the other games in the genre. Pool of Radiance received positive reviews. G.M. called the game's graphics \\"good\\" and praised its role-playing and combat aspects. They felt that \\"roleplayers will find Pools is an essential purchase, but people who are solely computer games oriented may hesitate before buying it [...] it will be their loss\\". Tony Dillon from Commodore User gave it a score of 9 out of 10; the only complaint was a slightly slow disk access, but the reviewer was impressed with the game's features, awarding it a Commodore User superstar and proclaiming it \\"the best RPG ever to grace the C64, or indeed any other computer\\". Issue #84 of the British magazine Computer + Video Games rated the game highly, saying that \\"Pools is a game which no role player or adventurer should be without and people new to role playing should seriously consider buying as an introductory guide\\". Another UK publication, The Games Machine, gave the game an 89% rating. The reviewer noted that the third-person arcade style combat view is a great improvement for SSI, as they had traditionally incorporated simplistic graphics in their role-playing games. The reviewer was critical that Pool of Radiance was not original in its presentation and that the colors were a little drab, but concluded that the game is \\"classic Dungeons & Dragons which SSI have recreated excellently\\". A review from Zzap was less positive, giving the game a score of 80%. The reviewer felt that the game required too much \\"hacking, slicing and chopping\\" without enough emphasis on puzzle solving. The game was awarded 49% for its puzzle factor. Three reviewers for Computer Gaming World had conflicting reactions. Ken St. Andre‚Äîdesigner of the Tunnels & Trolls RPG‚Äîapproved of the game despite his dislike of the D&D; system, praising the art, the mixture of combat and puzzles, and surprises. He concluded, \\"take it from a 'rival' designer, Pool of Radiance has my recommendation for every computer fantasy role-playing gamer\\". Tracie Forman Hicks, however, stated that over-faithful use of the D&D; system left it behind others like Ultima and Wizardry. She also disliked the game's puzzles and lengthy combat sequences. Scorpia also disliked the amount of fighting in a game she otherwise described as a \\"well-designed slicer/dicer\\", concluding that \\"patience (possibly of Job) [is] required to get through this one\\". Shay Addams from Compute! stated that experienced role- playing gamers \\"won't find anything new here\\", but recommended it to those who \\"love dungeons, dragons, and drama\\". In their March 1989 \\"The Role of Computers\\" column in Dragon magazine #143, Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser (often called \\"The Lessers\\") gave Pool of Radiance a three-page review. The reviewers praised Pool of Radiance as \\"the first offering that truly follows AD&D; game rules\\", calling it a \\"great fantasy role-playing game\\" that \\"falls into the must-buy category for avid AD&D; game players\\". The reviewers advised readers to \\"rush out to your local dealer and buy Pool Of Radiance\\". They considered it SSI's flagship product, speculating that it would \\"undoubtedly bring thousands of computer enthusiasts into the adventure-filled worlds of TSR\\". The Dragon reviewers criticized the \\"notoriously slow\\" technology of the C64/128 system but added that the C64/128 version would become nearly unplayable without a software-based fastloader utility which Strategic Simulations integrated into the game. Conversely, the reviewers felt that the MS-DOS version was extremely fast, so much so that they had to slow the game operation down in order to read all the on-screen messages. They found that the MS-DOS version played at twice the speed of the C64/128 version when using the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) graphics mode. Alex Simmons, Doug Johns, and Andy Mitchell reviewed the Amiga version of Pool of Radiance for Amiga Action magazine in 1990, giving it a 79% overall rating. Mitchell preferred the game Champions of Krynn, which had been released by the time the Amiga version of Pool of Radiance became available; he felt that Pool of Radiance was \\"more of the same\\" when compared to Champions, but was less playable and with more limited actions for players. Simmons felt that Pool of Radiance looked primitive and seemed less polished when compared with Champions of Krynn; he felt that although Pool was not up to the standard of Champions, he said it was still \\"a fine little game\\". Johns, on the other hand, felt that Pool of Radiance was well worth the wait, considering it very user-friendly despite being less polished than Champions of Krynn. Pool of Radiance was well received by the gaming press and won the Origins Award for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1988. For the second annual \\"Beastie Awards\\" in 1989, Dragon's readers voted Pool of Radiance the most popular fantasy role-playing game of the year, with Ultima V as the runner-up. The Apple II version was the most popular format, the PC DOS/MS-DOS came in a close second, and the Commodore 64/128 got the fewest votes. The primary factor given for votes was the game's faithfulness to the AD&D; system as well as the game's graphics and easy-to-use user interface to activate commands. Pool of Radiance was also selected for the RPGA-sponsored Gamers' Choice Awards for the Best Computer Game of 1989. In 1990 the game received the fifth-highest number of votes in a survey of Computer Gaming World readers' \\"All-Time Favorites\\". Allen Rausch, writing for GameSpy's 2004 retrospective \\"A History of D&D; Video Games\\", concluded that although the game \\"certainly had its flaws (horrendous load times, interface weirdness, and a low-level cap among others), it was a huge, expansive adventure that laid a good foundation for every Gold Box game that followed\\". In 1994, PC Gamer US named Pool of Radiance the 43rd best computer game ever. IGN ranked Pool of Radiance No. 3 on their list of \\"The Top 11 Dungeons & Dragons Games of All Time\\" in 2014. Ian Williams of Paste rated the game #5 on his list of \\"The 10 Greatest Dungeons and Dragons Videogames\\" in 2015.

The mustard-colored areas are part of the demesne, the hatched areas part of the glebe. William R. Shepherd, Historical Atlas, 1923 The open-field system was the prevalent agricultural system in much of Europe during the Middle Ages and lasted into the 20th century in parts of western Europe, Russia, Iran, and Turkey.Keddie, Nicki R. Iran. Religion, Politics and Society: Collected Essays London: Routledge, 1980, pp. 186‚Äì187 Under the open-field system, each manor or village had two or three large fields, usually several hundred acres each, which were divided into many narrow strips of land. The strips or selions were cultivated by individuals or peasant families, often called tenants or serfs. The holdings of a manor also included woodland and pasture areas for common usage and fields belonging to the lord of the manor and the church. The farmers customarily lived in individual houses in a nucleated village with a much larger manor house and church nearby. The open-field system necessitated co-operation among the inhabitants of the manor. The Lord of the Manor, his officials, and a Manorial court administered the manor and exercised jurisdiction over the peasantry. The Lord levied rents and required the peasantry to work on his personal lands, called a demesne.Astill, Grenville and Grant, Annie, eds. The Countryside of Medieval England Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1988, pp.23, 64 In medieval times, little land was owned outright. Instead, generally the lord had rights given to him by the king, and the tenant rented land from the lord. Lords demanded rents and labour from the tenants, but the tenants had firm user rights to cropland and common land and those rights were passed down from generation to generation. A medieval lord could not evict a tenant nor hire labour to replace him without legal cause. Most tenants likewise were not free without penalty to depart the manor for other locations or occupations. The rise of capitalism and the concept of land as a commodity to be bought and sold led to the gradual demise of the open- field system.Kulikoff, Allan From British Peasants to Colonial American Farmers Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2000, p. 11 The open- field system was gradually replaced over several centuries by private ownership of land, especially after the 15th century in the process known as enclosure in England. France, Germany, and other northern European countries had systems similar to England, although open fields generally endured longer on the continent. Some elements of the open-field system were practised by early settlers in the New England region of the United States.Ault, W. O. Open-Field Farming in Medieval England London: George Allen and Unwin Ltd., 1972, pp. 77‚Äì78Powell, Sumner Chilton. (1963). Puritan Village: The Formation of a New England Town. Wesleyan University Press, Middletown, CT 215pp. Description The method of ploughing the fields created a distinctive ridge and furrow pattern in open-field agriculture. The outlines of the medieval strips of cultivation, called selions, are still clearly visible in these now enclosed fields. The most visible characteristic of the open-field system was that the arable land belonging to a manor was divided into many long narrow furlongs for cultivation. The fields of cultivated land were unfenced, hence the name open-field system. Each tenant of the manor cultivated several strips of land scattered around the manor. The village of Elton, Cambridgeshire is representative of a medieval open-field manor in England. The manor, whose Lord was an abbot from a nearby monastery, had 13 \\"hides\\" of arable land of six virgates each. The acreage of a hide and virgate varied; but at Elton, a hide was and a virgate was . Thus, the total of arable land amounted to . The abbot's demesne land consisted of three hides plus of meadow and of pasture. The remainder of the land was cultivated by 113 tenants who lived in a village on the manor. Counting spouses, children, and other dependents, plus landless people, the total population resident in the manor village was probably 500 to 600.Gies, Frances and Joseph Life in a Medieval Village New York: Harper and Row, 1990, pp 31, 42 The abbot also owned two water mills for grinding grain, a fulling mill for finishing cloth, and a millpond on the manor. The village contained a church, a manor house, a village green, and the sub-manor of John of Elton, a rich farmer who cultivated one hide of land and had tenants of his own. The tenants' houses lined a road rather than being grouped in a cluster. Some of the village houses were fairly large, long by wide. Others were only long and wide. All were insubstantial and required frequent reconstruction. Most of the tenants' houses had outbuildings and an animal pen with a larger area, called a croft, of about one-half acre (0.2 ha), enclosed for a garden and grazing for animals.Gies, pp. 34‚Äì36 The tenants on the manor did not have equal holdings of land. About one-half of adults living on a manor had no land at all and had to work for larger landholders for their livelihood. A survey of 104 13th-century manors in England found that, among the landholding tenants, 45 percent had less than . To survive, they also had to work for larger landowners. 22 percent of tenants had a virgate of land (which varied in size between and and 31 percent had one-half virgate.McCloskey, Donald N. \\"The open fields of England: rent, risk, and the rate of interest, 1300‚Äì1815\\" in Markets in History: Economic Studies of the Past, ed. David W. Galenson, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989, pp 6‚Äì7 To rely on the land for a livelihood a tenant family needed at least . The land of a typical manor in England and other countries was subdivided into two or three large fields. Non-arable land was allocated to common pasture land or waste, where the villagers would graze their livestock throughout the year, woodland for pigs and timber, and also some private fenced land (paddocks, orchards and gardens), called closes. The ploughed fields and the meadows were used for livestock grazing when fallowed or after the grain was harvested. One of the two or three fields was fallowed each year to recover soil fertility. The fields were divided into parcels called furlongs. The furlong was further subdivided into long, thin strips of land called selions or ridges. Selions were distributed among the farmers of the village, the manor, and the church. A family might possess about 70 selions totalling about scattered around the fields. The scattered nature of family holdings ensured that families each received a ration of both good and poor land and minimised risk. If some selions were unproductive, others might be productive. Ploughing techniques created a landscape of ridge and furrow, with furrows between ridges dividing individual holdings and aiding drainage. While selions were cultivated by individuals or families, the right of pasture on fallowed fields, land unsuitable for cultivation, and harvested fields was held in common with rules to prevent overgrazing enforced by the community.\\"Medieval fields in their many forms\\" British Archaeology Issue no. 33, April 1998; Ault, W. O. \\"Open- Field Farming in Medieval England London: George Allen and Unwin, Ltd., 1972, pp. 15‚Äì16 Crops and production A four-ox-team plough, circa 1330. The ploughman is using a mouldboard plough to cut through the heavy soils. A team could plough about one acre (0.4 ha) per day. The typical planting scheme in a three-field system was that barley, oats, or legumes would be planted in one field in spring, wheat or rye in the second field in the fall and the third field would be left fallow. The following year, the planting in the fields would be rotated. Pasturage was held in common. The tenants pastured their livestock on the fallow field and on the planted fields after harvest. An elaborate set of laws and controls, partly set by the Lord of the Manor and partly by the tenants themselves regulated planting, harvest, and pasturing.Hopcroft, Rosemary L. Regions, Institutions, and Agrarian Change in European History Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, pp. 17‚Äì20; Astill and Grant, p. 27 Wheat and barley were the most important crops with roughly equal amounts planted on the average in England. Annual wheat production at Battle Abbey in Sussex in the late 14th century ranged from 2.26 to 5.22 seeds harvested for every seed planted, averaging 4.34 seeds harvested for every seed planted. Barley production averaged 4.01 and oats 2.87 seeds harvested for seeds planted. This translates into yields of 7 to 17 bushels per acre harvested. Battle Abbey, however, may have been atypical, with better management and soils than typical of demesnes in open-field areas.Brandon, P. F. \\"Cereal Yields on the Sussex Estates of Battle Abby during the Later Middle Ages,\\" The Economic History Review, New Series, Vol. 25, No. 8 (Aug 1972), pp. 405, 412, 417, 419‚Äì420 Barley was used in making beer ‚Äì consumed in large quantities ‚Äì and mixed with other grains to produce bread that was a dietary staple for the poorer farmers. Wheat was often sold as a cash crop. Richer people ate bread made of wheat. At Elton in 1286, perhaps typical of that time in England, the tenants harvested about twice as much barley as wheat with lesser amounts of oats, peas, beans, rye, flax, apples, and vegetables.Gies, pp. 60‚Äì62 The land-holding tenants also had livestock, including sheep, pigs, cattle, horses, oxen, and poultry. Pork was the principal meat eaten; sheep were primarily raised for their wool, a cash crop. Only a few rich landholders had enough horses and oxen to make up a ploughing-team of six to eight oxen or horses, so sharing among neighbours was essential.Giews, pp. 82, 145‚Äì149 History Much of the land in the open-field system during medieval times had been cultivated for hundreds of years earlier on Roman estates or by farmers belonging to one of the ethnic groups of Europe. There are hints of a proto-open-field system going back to AD 98 among the Germanic tribes. Germanic and Anglo-Saxon invaders and settlers possibly brought the open-field system to France and England after the 5th century AD.Hopcroft, p. 40 The open-field system appears to have developed to maturity between AD 850 and 1150 in England, although documentation is scarce prior to the Domesday Book of 1086. The open-field system was never practised in all regions and countries in Europe. It was most common in heavily populated and productive agricultural regions. In England, the south-east, notably parts of Essex and Kent, retained a pre-Roman system of farming in small, square, enclosed fields. In much of eastern and western England, fields were similarly either never open or were enclosed earlier. The primary area of open fields was in the lowland areas of England in a broad swathe from Yorkshire and Lincolnshire diagonally across England to the south, taking in parts of Norfolk and Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, large areas of the Midlands, and most of south central England. This area was the main grain-growing region (as opposed to pastoral farming) in medieval times. The population in Europe grew in the early centuries of the open-field system, doubling in Britain between 1086 and 1300, which required increased agricultural production and more intensive cultivation of farmland.Ault, pp. 15‚Äì16, Oosthuizen, p. 165-166 The open-field system was generally not practised in marginal agricultural areas or in hilly and mountainous regions. Open fields were well suited to the dense clay soils common in northwestern Europe. Heavy ploughs were needed to cut through the soil and the ox or horse teams which pulled the ploughs were expensive, and thus both animals and ploughs were often shared by necessity among farm families.Ault, 20‚Äì21 Fiddleford Manor in Dorset, England, a manor house built about 1370. The part of the house in the background was added in the 16th century. Strip field at Forrabury, CornwallWhilst the stitches (strips) to the west of track across the open field were arable at the time of this visit (early May 2009), on the east side they are covered in grass. This illustrates the system whereby the stitches were cultivated by their owners during the Summer, but grazed in common during the winter. This grazing adds manure to the soil to keep it fertile. The Black Death of 1348‚Äì1350 killed 30‚Äì60% of Europe's population. As a consequence the surviving population had access to larger tracts of empty farmland and wages increased due to a shortage of labour. Richer farmers began to acquire land and remove it from communal usage. An economic recession and low grain prices in fifteenth century England gave a competitive advantage to the production of wool, meat, and milk. The shift away from grain to livestock accelerated enclosure of fields. The steadily increasing number of formerly open fields converted to enclosed (fenced) fields caused social and economic stress among small farmers who lost their access to communal grazing lands. Many tenants were forced off the lands their families may have cultivated for centuries to work for wages in towns and cities. The number of large and middle-sized estates grew in number while small land-holders decreased in number.Hopcroft, pp 70‚Äì81 In the 16th and early 17th centuries, the practice of enclosure (particularly depopulating enclosure) was denounced by the Church and the government, and legislation was drawn up against it. The dispossession of tenants from their land created an \\"epidemic of vagrancy\\" in England in the late 16th and early 17th century.Gies, p. 196; Kulikoff, pp. 19, 50 However, the tide of elite opinion began to turn towards support for enclosure, and the rate of enclosure increased in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.Beresford, Maurice. The Lost Villages of England (Revised ed.) London: Sutton, 1998, p. 102 ff Controversies and inefficiencies The open-field system is considered by many economists to have been inefficient for agricultural production and resistant to technological innovation. \\"Everyone was forced to conform to village norms of cropping, harvesting, and building.\\"Hopcroft, p. 48 The communal institutions, the manorial court, and the tenants regulated agricultural practices and economic behaviour. The manorial lord exercised control over the tenants by extracting rent for land or labour to cultivate his demesne lands. The scattered holdings of individual farmers increased the time needed to travel to and from fields. The open-field system, especially its characteristic of common grazing lands, has often been used as an example by economists to illustrate \\"the tragedy of the commons\\" and assert that private ownership is a better steward of resources than common or public ownership. \\"Tragedy of the commons\\" refers to the alleged destruction of common pastures in England as a result of overgrazing, each tenant maximising his gain by grazing as many animals as possible and ignoring the long-term impact of overgrazing. However, the creator of the term \\"tragedy of the commons\\", Garrett Hardin, pointed out that the pastures of England were \\"protected from ruin by limiting each tenant to a fixed number of animals\\". Thus, Hardin says the commons were \\"managed\\", the \\"logical equivalent of socialism ...which may be good or bad depending on the quality of the management\\".Hardin, Garret, \\"The Tragedy of the Commons\\", accessed 22 August 2019 The fact that the open-field system endured for roughly a thousand years over a large part of Europe and provided a livelihood to a growing population indicates that there might not have been a better way of organizing agriculture during that time period.Dahlman, Carl J. (1980), The Open Field System and Beyond, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 95Cox, S., (1985). \\"No tragedy on the commons\\". Environmental Ethics 7:49‚Äì61. The replacement of the open-field system by privately owned property was fiercely resisted by many elements of society. The \\"brave new world\\" of a harsher, more competitive and capitalistic society from the 16th century onward destroyed the securities and certainties of land tenure in the open-field system.Campbell, Bruce M. S. \\"The Land\\" in A Social History of England, 1200‚Äì1500, ed. by Rosemary Horrox and W. Mark Ormrod. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 237 The open field system died only slowly. More than half the agricultural land of England was still not enclosed in 1700, after which the government discouraged the continuation of the open-field system. It was finally laid to rest in England about 1850 after more than 5,000 Acts of Parliament over several centuries had transformed the \\"scattered plots in the open fields\\" into unambiguous private and enclosed properties free of village and communal control and use. Other European countries also began to pass legislation to eliminate the scattering of farm land, the Netherlands and France passing laws making land consolidation compulsory in the 1930s and 1950s respectively.McCloskey, p. 11 In Russia, the open-field system, called \\"cherespolositsa\\" (\\"alternating ribbons (of land)\\") and administered by the obschina / mir (the general village community), remained as the main system of peasant land ownership in Russia until the Stolypin reform process that started in 1905, but generally continued for many years, finally ending only with the Soviet policy of collectivisation in the 1930s. Modern times =Surviving open fields= One place in England where the open-field system continues to be used is the village of Laxton, Nottinghamshire. It is thought that its anomalous survival is due to the inability of two early 19th century landowners to agree on how the land was to be enclosed, thus resulting in the perpetuation of the existing system. The only other surviving medieval open strip field system in England is in Braunton, North Devon. It is still farmed with due regard to its ancient origins and is conserved by those who recognise its importance although the number of owners has fallen dramatically throughout the years and this has resulted in the amalgamation of some of the strips. There is also a surviving medieval open strip field system in Wales in the township of Laugharne, which is also the last town in the UK with an intact medieval charter. Vestiges of an open-field system also persist in the Isle of Axholme, North Lincolnshire, around the villages of Haxey, Epworth and Belton, where long strips, of an average size of half an acre, curve to follow the gently sloping ground and are used for growing vegetables or cereal crops. The boundaries are mostly unmarked, although where several strips have been amalgamated a deep furrow is sometimes used to divide them. The ancient village game of Haxey Hood is played in this open landscape. =Allotment gardens= A similar system to open fields survives in the United Kingdom as allotment gardens. In many towns and cities there are areas of land of one or two acres (up to about one hectare) interspersed between the buildings. These areas are usually owned by local authorities, or by allotment associations. Small patches of the land are allocated at a low rent to local individuals or families for growing food.

The name refers to the red flags that the communists use. The term is most often used to refer to two periods in the history of the United States which are referred to by this name. The First Red Scare, which occurred immediately after World War I, revolved around a perceived threat from the American labor movement, anarchist revolution, and political radicalism. The Second Red Scare, which occurred immediately after World War II, was preoccupied with the perception that national or foreign communists were infiltrating or subverting U.S. society and the federal government. First Red Scare (1917‚Äì1920) Paris peace talks The first Red Scare began following the Bolshevik Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent wave of Communist revolutions throughout Europe and beyond. Domestically, these were the intensely patriotic years of World War I, with anarchist and other left-wing social agitation aggravating national, social, and political tensions. Political scientist and former member of the Communist Party Murray B. Levin wrote that the Red Scare was \\"a nationwide anti-radical hysteria provoked by a mounting fear and anxiety that a Bolshevik revolution in America was imminent‚Äîa revolution that would change Church, home, marriage, civility, and the American way of Life\\". Newspapers exacerbated those political fears into anti-foreign sentiment because varieties of radical anarchism were becoming popular as possible solutions to poverty, often by recent European immigrants (cf. hyphenated-Americans). The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), also known as the Wobblies, backed several labor strikes in 1916 and 1917. These wartime strikes covered a wide range of industries including steel working, shipbuilding, coal mining, copper mining, as well as other industries necessary to make wartime necessities. After World War I ended the number of strikes increased to record levels in 1919 with more than 3,600 separate strikes that spanned from steel workers, to railroad shop workers, to the Boston police department. The press portrayed them as \\"radical threats to American society\\" inspired by \\"left-wing, foreign agents provocateurs\\". Those on the side of the IWW claim that the press \\"misrepresented legitimate labor strikes\\" as \\"crimes against society\\", \\"conspiracies against the government\\", and \\"plots to establish communism\\".Political Hysteria in America: The Democratic Capacity for Repression (1971), p. 31 Opponents, on the other hand, saw these as an extension of the radical, anarchist foundations of the IWW, which contends that all workers should be united as a social class and that capitalism and the wage system should be abolished. In 1917 as a response to World War 1 Congress passed the espionage act of 1917 to prevent any information relating to national defense to be used to harm the United States or aid her enemies. The Wilson administration used this act to make anything \\"urging treason\\" a \\"nonmailable matter\\" . Due to the espionage act and the then Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson, 74 separate newspapers were not being mailed. A \\"European Anarchist\\" attempts to destroy the Statue of Liberty in this 1919 political cartoon. A bomb blast badly damaged the residence of Attorney General Mitchell Palmer in the spring of 1919. In April 1919, authorities discovered a plot for mailing 36 bombs to prominent members of the U.S. political and economic establishment: J. P. Morgan Jr., John D. Rockefeller, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, U.S. Attorney General Alexander Mitchell Palmer, and immigration officials. On June 2, 1919, in eight cities, eight bombs simultaneously exploded. One target was the Washington, D.C., house of U.S. Attorney General Palmer, where the explosion killed the bomber, who evidence indicated was an Italian-American radical from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Afterwards, Palmer ordered the U.S. Justice Department to launch the Palmer Raids (1919‚Äì21). He deported 249 Russian immigrants on the \\"Soviet Ark\\", helped create the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and used federal agents to jail more than 5,000 citizens and search homes without respecting their constitutional rights. Yet, in 1918, before the bombings, President Woodrow Wilson had pressured the Congress to legislate the anti- anarchist Sedition Act of 1918 to protect wartime morale by deporting putatively undesirable political people. Law professor David D. Cole reports that President Wilson's \\"federal government consistently targeted alien radicals, deporting them ... for their speech or associations, making little effort to distinguish terrorists from ideological dissidents.\\" President Wilson used the Sedition Act of 1918 in order to limit the exercise of free speech by criminalizing language deemed disloyal to the United States government. Initially, the press praised the raids; The Washington Post said, \\"There is no time to waste on hairsplitting over [the] infringement of liberty\\", and The New York Times said the injuries inflicted upon the arrested were \\"souvenirs of the new attitude of aggressiveness which had been assumed by the Federal agents against Reds and suspected-Reds\\". In the event, the Palmer Raids were criticized as unconstitutional by twelve publicly prominent lawyers, including (future Supreme Court Justice) Felix Frankfurter, who published A Report on the Illegal Practices of The United States Department of Justice, documenting systematic violations of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution via Palmer-authorized \\"illegal acts\\" and \\"wanton violence\\". Defensively, Palmer then warned that a government-deposing left-wing revolution would begin on 1 May 1920‚ÄîMay Day, the International Workers' Day. When it failed to happen, he was ridiculed and lost much credibility. Strengthening the legal criticism of Palmer was that fewer than 600 deportations were substantiated with evidence, out of the thousands of resident aliens arrested and deported. In July 1920, Palmer's once-promising Democratic Party bid for the U.S. presidency failed. Wall Street was bombed on September 2, 1920, near Federal Hall National Memorial and the JP Morgan Bank. Although both anarchists and communists were suspected as being responsible for the bombing, ultimately no individuals were indicted for the bombing in which 38 died and 141 were injured. In 1919‚Äì20, several states enacted \\"criminal syndicalism\\" laws outlawing advocacy of violence in effecting and securing social change. The restrictions included free speech limitations. Passage of these laws, in turn, provoked aggressive police investigation of the accused persons, their jailing, and deportation for being suspected of being either communist or left-wing. Regardless of ideological gradation, the Red Scare did not distinguish between communism, anarchism, socialism, or social democracy. This aggressive crackdown on certain ideologies resulted in many supreme court cases over the debate to free speech. In the case of Schenk v. United States using the clear and present danger test the espionage act of 1917 and the sedition act of 1918 were deemed constitutional. Second Red Scare (1947‚Äì57) Senator Joseph McCarthy, namesake of McCarthyism The second Red Scare occurred after World War II (1939‚Äì45), and it was popularly known as \\"McCarthyism\\" after its most famous supporter, Senator Joseph McCarthy. McCarthyism coincided with an increased and popular fear of communist espionage that was consequent of the increasing tension in the Cold War through the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe, the Berlin Blockade (1948‚Äì49), the end of the Chinese Civil War, the confessions of spying for the Soviet Union that were made by several high-ranking U.S. government officials, and the outbreak of the Korean War. =Internal causes of the anti-communist fear= The events of the late 1940s, the early 1950s ‚Äî the trial of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg (1953), the trial of Alger Hiss, the Iron Curtain (1945‚Äì1991) around Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union's first nuclear weapon test in 1949 (RDS-1) ‚Äî surprised the American public, influencing popular opinion about U.S. National Security, which, in turn, was connected to the fear that the Soviet Union would hydrogen-bomb the United States, and fear of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA). In Canada, the 1946 Kellock‚ÄìTaschereau Commission investigated espionage after top secret documents concerning RDX, radar and other weapons were handed over to the Soviets by a domestic spy-ring.Canada. The report of the Royal Commission appointed under Order in Council P. C. 411 of February 5, 1946 to investigate the facts relating to and the circumstances surrounding the communication, by public officials and other persons in positions of trust, of secret and confidential information to agents of a foreign power, June 27, 1946. Ottawa: E. Cloutier, Printer to the King, 1946. At the House Un-American Activities Committee, former CPUSA members and NKVD spies, Elizabeth Bentley and Whittaker Chambers, testified that Soviet spies and communist sympathizers had penetrated the U.S. government before, during and after World War II. Other U.S. citizen spies confessed to their acts of espionage in situations where the statute of limitations on prosecuting them had run out. In 1949, anti‚Äìcommunist fear, and fear of American traitors, was aggravated by the Chinese Communists winning the Chinese Civil War against the Western-sponsored Kuomintang, their founding of the People's Republic of China, and later Chinese intervention in the Korean War (1950‚Äì53) against U.S. ally South Korea. A few of the events during the Red Scare were also due to a power struggle between director of FBI J. Edgar Hoover and the Central Intelligence Agency. Hoover had instigated and aided some of the investigations of members of the CIA with \\"leftist\\" history, like Cord Meyer.Mocking Bird , John Simkin, Spartacus Schoolnet This conflict could also be traced back to the conflict between Hoover and William J. Donovan, going back to the first Red Scare, but especially during World War II. Donovan ran the OSS (CIA's predecessor). They had differing opinions on the nature of the alliance with the Soviet Union, conflicts over jurisdiction, conflicts of personality, the OSS hiring of communists and criminals as agents, etc.See for example Wedge: The Secret War between the FBI and CIA, by Mark Riebling = History =  Early years  By the 1930s, communism had become an attractive economic ideology, particularly among labor leaders and intellectuals. By 1939, the CPUSA had about 50,000 members. In 1940, soon after World War II began in Europe, the U.S. Congress legislated the Alien Registration Act (aka the Smith Act, 18 USC ¬ß 2385) making it a crime to \\"knowingly or willfully advocate, abet, advise or teach the duty, necessity, desirability or propriety of overthrowing the Government of the United States or of any State by force or violence, or for anyone to organize any association which teaches, advises or encourages such an overthrow, or for anyone to become a member of or to affiliate with any such association\\"‚Äîand required Federal registration of all foreign nationals. Although principally deployed against communists, the Smith Act was also used against right-wing political threats such as the German-American Bund, and the perceived racial disloyalty of the Japanese-American population, (cf. hyphenated-Americans). After the non-aggression pact was signed between Hitler and Stalin in 1939 the communist party in the United States took an anti-war approach and were consequently treated with more hostility than they had been previously by the public because they were seen as to be working with the Nazis, however in 1941, after Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union, the CPUSA's official position became pro-war, opposing labor strikes in the weapons industry and supporting the U.S. war effort against the Axis Powers. With the slogan \\"Communism is Twentieth-Century Americanism\\", the chairman, Earl Browder, advertised the CPUSA's integration to the political mainstream. In contrast, the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party opposed U.S. participation in the war and supported labor strikes, even in the war-effort industry. For this reason, James P. Cannon and other SWP leaders were convicted per the Smith Act.  Increasing Tension  In March 1947, President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9835, creating the \\"Federal Employees Loyalty Program\\" establishing political-loyalty review boards who determined the \\"Americanism\\" of Federal Government employees, and requiring that all federal employees to take an oath of loyalty to the United States government. It then recommended termination of those who had confessed to spying for the Soviet Union, as well as some suspected of being \\"Un-American\\". This led to more than 2,700 dismissals and 12,000 resignations from the years 1947 to 1956. It also was the template for several state legislatures' loyalty acts, such as California's Levering Act. The House Committee on Un-American Activities was created during the Truman administration as a response to allegations by republicans of disloyalty in Truman's administration. The House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) and the committees of Senator Joseph McCarthy (R., Wisc.) conducted character investigations of \\"American communists\\" (actual and alleged), and their roles in (real and imaginary) espionage, propaganda, and subversion favoring the Soviet Union‚Äîin the process revealing the extraordinary breadth of the Soviet spy network in infiltrating the federal government; the process also launched the successful political careers of Richard Nixon and Robert F. Kennedy, as well as that of Joseph McCarthy. The HUAC held a large interest in investigating those in the entertainment industry in Hollywood. They interrogated actors, writers, and producers. The people who cooperated in the investigations got to continue working as they had been, but people who refused to cooperate were blacklisted. Senator Joseph McCarthy stirred up further fear in the United States of communists infiltrating the country by saying that communist spies were omnipresent, and he was America's only salvation, using this fear to increase his own influence. In 1950 Joseph McCarthy addressed the senate, citing 81 separate cases, and made accusations against suspected communists. Although he provided little or no evidence, this prompted the Senate to call for a full investigation. Senator McCarran introduced the McCarran Internal Security Act of 1950 that was passed by the U.S. Congress and which modified a great deal of law to restrict civil liberties in the name of security. President Truman declared the act a \\"mockery of the Bill of Rights\\" and a \\"long step toward totalitarianism\\" because it represented a government restriction on the freedom of opinion. He vetoed the act but his veto was overridden by Congress. Much of the bill eventually was repealed. The Second Red Scare profoundly altered the temper of American society. Its later characterizations may be seen as contributory to works of feared communist espionage, such as the film My Son John (1952), about parent's suspicions their son is a spy. Abundant accounts in narrative forms contained themes of the infiltration, subversion, invasion, and destruction of American society by un‚ÄìAmerican thought. Even a baseball team, the Cincinnati Reds, temporarily renamed themselves the \\"Cincinnati Redlegs\\" to avoid the money-losing and career-ruining connotations inherent in being ball-playing \\"Reds\\" (communists). In 1954 congress passed the Communist Control Act of 1954 which prevented members of the communist party in America from holding office in labor unions and other labor organizations.  Wind Down  In 1954, after accusing the army, including war heroes, Senator Joseph McCarthy lost credibility in the eyes of the American public. He was formally censured by his colleagues in Congress and the hearings led by McCarthy came to a close. After the Senate formally censured McCarthy, he lost a lot of his standing and political power, and some of the tension and excitement from a possible communist takeover died down. From 1955 through 1959, the Supreme Court made several decisions which restricted the ways in which the government could enforce its anti-communist policies, some of which included limiting the federal loyalty program to only those who had access to sensitive information, allowing defendants to face their accusers, reducing the strength of congressional investigation committees, and weakening the Smith Act. In the 1957 case Yates v. United States and the 1961 case Scales v. United States, the Supreme Court limited Congress's ability to circumvent the First Amendment, and in 1967 during the Supreme Court case United States v. Robel, the Supreme Court ruled that a ban on communists in the defense industry was unconstitutional. In 1995, the American government revealed details of the Venona Project, which when combined with the opening of the USSR ComIntern archives, provided substantial validation of intelligence gathering, outright spying, and policy influencing, by Americans on behalf of the Soviet Union, from 1940 through 1980. Over 300 American communists, whether they knew it or not, including government officials and technicians that helped in developing the atom bomb, were found to have engaged in espionage.

Originally developed for multimedia PC applications, M-JPEG is now used by video-capture devices such as digital cameras, IP cameras, and webcams, as well as by non-linear video editing systems. It is natively supported by the QuickTime Player, the PlayStation 3 console, and web browsers such as Safari, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge.  History  MJPEG was first used by the QuickTime Player in the mid-1990s.  Applications  Software and devices using the M-JPEG standard include web browsers, media players, game consoles, digital cameras, IP cameras, webcams, streaming servers, video cameras, and non-linear video editors. = Video capture and editing = M-JPEG is frequently used in non- linear video editing systems. Modern desktop CPUs are powerful enough to work with high-definition video, so no special hardware is required, and they in turn offer native random-access to any frame. M-JPEG support is also widespread in video-capture and editing equipment. = Game consoles = The PlayStation 3 game console integrated M-JPEG decompression hardware for in- game FMV sequences, while the PlayStation Portable handheld game console can play M-JPEG from the Memory Stick Pro Duo under the .avi extension with a resolution of 480√ó272. Both can record clips in M-JPEG with its Go!Cam camera. Nintendo's Wii game console, as well as V-Tech's InnoTAB, can play M-JPEG- encoded videos on SD card using its Photo Channel. The SanDisk Sansa e200 and the Zen V digital audio players play short M-JPEG videos. Recent firmware updates to the Nintendo 3DS can now record and play \\"3D-AVI\\" M-JPEG-encoded files, which is the same format used in the Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D series, from a SD card in 320√ó240 resolution so long as the video duration is 10 minutes or less. = Digital cameras = Prior to the recent rise in MPEG-4 encoding in consumer devices, a progressive scan form of M-JPEG saw widespread use in the ‚Äúmovie‚Äù modes of digital still cameras, allowing video encoding and playback through the integrated JPEG compression hardware with only a software modification. The resultant quality is still inferior compared to a similar- sized MPEG, particularly as the sound (when included) was uncompressed PCM and recorded at a low sample rate or low-compression, low processor-demand ADPCM. To keep file sizes and transfer rates under control, frame sizes and rates, along with sound sampling rates, are kept relatively low with very high levels of compression for each individual frame. Resolutions of 160√ó120 or 320√ó240 are common sizes, typically at 10, 12 or 15 frames per second, with picture quality equivalent to a JPEG setting of ‚Äú50‚Äù with mono ADPCM sound sampled at ~8 kHz. This results in a very basic, but serviceable video output at a similar storage cost to MPEG (~120 kB/s video rate, ~8 kB/s audio ‚Äì or approx 1 Mbit/s at 320√ó240 resolution), but with minimal processing overheads. This video is typically stored in the popular Windows AVI or Apple QuickTime MOV container files, generally viewable natively (or after installation of a simple codec) in most versions of the applicable operating system. The AMV video format, common on cheap \\"MP4\\" players, is a modified version of M-JPEG. In addition to portable players (which are mainly \\"consumers\\" of the video), many video-enabled digital cameras use M-JPEG for video-capture. For instance: * In August 2008, Nikon announced the D90, the first D-SLR to record video. The format used is M-JPEG. The D90 uses three different motion JPEG formats: 320√ó216 pixels, 640√ó424 pixels and 1280√ó720 pixels. * In June 2009, Pentax announced that the then-upcoming K-7 camera would use M-JPEG in resolutions 640√ó416, 1280√ó720, and 1536√ó1024. The data rate for the M-JPEG files created can be up to 74 Mbit/s. * In August 2016, Canon announced that the 5D Mark IV camera would record 4K video in M-JPEG, with a data rate of approximately 500 Mbit/s. = HDTV media players = Apple announced on September 1, 2010 that their newest version of the Apple TV would support Motion JPEG (M-JPEG) up to 35 Mbit/s, 1280 by 720 pixels, 30 frames per second, audio in Œºlaw, PCM stereo audio in .avi file format. Certain media players such as the Netgear NeoTV 550 do not support the playback of M-JPEG. = IP cameras = Many network-enabled cameras provide M-JPEG streams that network clients can connect to. Mozilla and Webkit-based browsers have native support for viewing these M-JPEG streams. Some network-enabled cameras provide their own M-JPEG interfaces as part of the normal feature set. For cameras that don't provide this feature natively, a server can be used to transcode the camera pictures into an M-JPEG stream and then provide that stream to other network clients. = M-JPEG over HTTP = HTTP streaming separates each image into individual HTTP replies on a specified marker. HTTP streaming creates packets of a sequence of JPEG images that can be received by clients such as QuickTime or VLC. In response to a GET request for a MJPEG file or stream, the server streams the sequence of JPEG frames over HTTP. A special mime-type content type multipart/x-mixed- replace;boundary= informs the client to expect several parts (frames) as an answer delimited by . This boundary name is expressly disclosed within the MIME-type declaration itself. The TCP connection is not closed as long as the client wants to receive new frames and the server wants to provide new frames. Two basic implementations of a M-JPEG streaming server are cambozola and MJPG- Streamer. The more robust ffmpeg-server also provides M-JPEG streaming support. = Client software = Native web browser support includes: Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Firefox.M-JPEG streams sent to Mozilla Firefox must be enclosed within an HTTP document to avoid flickering. See Bug 625012. Other browsers, such as Internet Explorer can display M-JPEG streams with the help of external plugins. Cambozola is an applet that can show M-JPEG streams in Java-enabled browsers. M-JPEG is also natively supported by PlayStation and QuickTime. = Digital video = Digital Video (DV) adopts a similar method by compressing video frames individually.  Encoding  M-JPEG is an intraframe-only compression scheme (compared with the more computationally intensive technique of interframe prediction). Whereas modern interframe video formats, such as MPEG1, MPEG2 and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, achieve real-world compression ratios of 1:50 or better, M-JPEG's lack of interframe prediction limits its efficiency to 1:20 or lower, depending on the tolerance to spatial artifacting in the compressed output. Because frames are compressed independently of one another, M-JPEG imposes lower processing and memory requirements on hardware devices. As a purely intraframe compression scheme, the image quality of M-JPEG is directly a function of each video frame's static (spatial) complexity. Frames with large smooth transitions or monotone surfaces compress well and are more likely to hold their original details with few visible compression artifacts. Frames exhibiting complex textures, fine curves and lines (such as writing on a newspaper) are prone to exhibit discrete cosine transform (DCT) artifacts such as ringing, smudging and macroblocking. M-JPEG-compressed video is also insensitive to motion complexity, i.e. variation over time. It is neither hindered by highly random motion (such as the water-surface turbulence in a large waterfall), nor helped by the absence of motion (such as static landscape shot by tripod), which are two opposite extremes commonly used to test interframe video formats. For QuickTime formats, Apple has defined two types of coding: MJPEG-A and MJPEG-B. MJPEG-B no longer retains valid JPEG Interchange Files within it, hence it is not possible to take a frame into a JPEG file without slightly modifying the headers.  Advantages  * It is simple to implement because it uses a mature compression standard (JPEG) with well-developed libraries, and it is an intraframe method of compression. * It tolerates rapidly changing motion in the video stream, whereas compression schemes using interframe compression can often experience unacceptable quality loss when the video content changes significantly between each frame. * It enjoys broad client support ‚Äî most major web browsers and players provide native support, and plug-ins are available for the rest. * Minimal hardware is required because it is not computationally intensive.  Disadvantages  * Unlike the video formats specified in international standards such as MPEG-2 and the format specified in the JPEG still-picture coding standard, there is no document that defines a single exact format that is universally recognized as a complete specification of ‚ÄúMotion JPEG‚Äù for use in all contexts. This raises compatibility concerns about file outputs from different manufacturers. However, each particular file format usually has some standard on how M-JPEG is encoded. For example, Microsoft documents their standard format to store M-JPEG in AVI files, Apple documents how M-JPEG is stored in QuickTime files, RFC 2435 describes how M-JPEG is implemented in an RTP stream, and an M-JPEG CodecID is planned for the Matroska file format.http://www.matroska.org/technical/specs/codecid/index.html * JPEG is inefficient, using more bits to deliver similar quality, compared to more modern formats (such as JPEG 2000 and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC). Since the development of the original JPEG standard in the early 1990s, technology improvements have been made not only to the JPEG format but to the interframe compression schemas possible as well. * Technology improvements can be found in the designs of H.263v2 Annex I and MPEG-4 Part 2, that use frequency-domain prediction of transform coefficient values, and in H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, that use spatial prediction and adaptive transform block size techniques. There are also more sophisticated entropy coding than what was practical when the first JPEG design was developed. All of these new developments make M-JPEG an inefficient recording mechanism.

It is sometimes called a hack, whack, escape (from C/UNIX), reverse slash, slosh, downwhack, backslant, backwhack, bash, reverse slant, and reversed virgule.Macquarie Dictionary (3rd edition) In Unicode and ASCII it is encoded at . History Bob Bemer introduced the character into ASCII on September 18, 1961, as the result of character frequency studies. In particular, the was introduced so that the ALGOL boolean operators (and) and (or) could be composed in ASCII as and respectively.\\"How ASCII Got Its Backslash\\" , Bob Bemer Both these operators were included in early versions of the C programming language supplied with Unix V6, Unix V7 and more recently BSD 2.11. Usage =Programming languages= In many programming languages such as C, Perl, PHP, Python, Unix scripting languages, and many file formats such as JSON, the backslash is used as an escape character, to indicate that the character following it should be treated specially (if it would otherwise be treated normally), or normally (if it would otherwise be treated specially). For instance, inside a C string literal the sequence produces a newline byte instead of an 'n', and the sequence produces an actual double quote rather than the special meaning of the double quote ending the string. An actual backslash is produced by a double backslash . Regular expression languages used it the same way, changing subsequent literal characters into metacharacters and vice versa. For instance searches for either '' or 'b', the first bar is escaped and searched for, the second is not escaped and acts as an \\"or\\". Outside quoted strings, the only common use of backslash is to ignore (\\"escape\\") a newline immediately after it. In this context it may be called a \\"continuation\\" as the current line continues into the next one. To support computers that lacked the backslash character, the C trigraph was added, which is equivalent to a backslash. Since this can escape the next character, which may itself be a , the primary modern use may be for code obfuscation. Support for trigraphs was removed in C++17. In Visual BASIC (and some other BASIC dialects) the backslash is used as an operator symbol to indicate integer division. This rounds toward zero. The ALGOL 68 programming language uses the \\"\\\\\\" as its Decimal Exponent Symbol. ALGOL 68 has the choice of 4 Decimal Exponent Symbols: e, E, \\\\, or 10. Examples: , , or . In APL is called Expand when used to insert fill elements into arrays, and Scan when used to produce prefix reduction (cumulative fold). In PHP version 5.3 and higher, the backslash is used to indicate a namespace. In Haskell, the backslash is used both to introduce special characters and to introduce lambda functions (since it is a reasonable approximation in ASCII of the Greek letter lambda, Œª).O'Sullivan, Stewart, and Goerzen, Real World Haskell, ch. 4: anonymous (lambda) functions, p.99 =Filenames= MS-DOS 2.0, released 1983, copied the hierarchical file system from Unix and thus used the (forward) slash but (possibly on the insistence of IBM) added the backslash to allow paths to be typed at the command line interpreter's prompt while retaining compatibility with MS-DOS 1.0 where the slash was the command-line option indicator (typing \\"\\" gave the \\"wide\\" option to the \\"\\" command, so some other method was needed if you actually wanted to run a program called inside a directory called ). Except for COMMAND.COM, all other parts of the operating system accept both characters in a path, but the Microsoft convention remains to use a backslash, and APIs that return paths use backslashes. In some versions, the option character can be changed from to via SWITCHAR, which allows COMMAND.COM to preserve in the command name. The Microsoft Windows family of operating systems inherited the MS-DOS behavior and so still support either character ‚Äì but individual Windows programs and sub-systems may, wrongly, only accept the backslash as a path delimiter, or may misinterpret a forward slash if it is used as such. Some programs will only accept forward slashes if the path is placed in double-quotes. The failure of Microsoft's security features to recognize unexpected-direction slashes in local and Internet paths, while other parts of the operating system still act upon them, has led to some serious lapses in security. Resources that should not be available have been accessed with paths using particular mixes, such as . =Text markup= The backslash is used in the TeX typesetting system and in RTF files to begin markup tags. In USFM, the backslash is used to mark format features for editing Bible translations. =Mathematics= A backslash-like symbol is used for the set difference. The backslash is also sometimes used to denote the right coset space. Especially when describing computer algorithms, it is common to define backslash so that is equivalent to . This is integer division that rounds down, not towards zero. In Wolfram Mathematica the backslash is used this way for integer divide. In MATLAB and GNU Octave the backslash is used for left matrix divide, while the slash is for right matrix divide. Confusion with ¬• and other characters In the Japanese encodings ISO 646 (a 7-bit code based on ASCII), JIS X 0201 (an 8-bit code), and Shift JIS (a multi-byte encoding which is 8-bit for ASCII), the code point 0x5C that would be used for backslash in ASCII is instead rendered as a yen sign . Due to extensive use of the backslash code point to represent the yen sign, even today some fonts such as MS Mincho render the backslash character as a ¬•, so the characters at Unicode code points 00A5 (¬•) and 005C (\\\\\\\\) both render as when these fonts are selected. Computer programs still treat 005C as a backslash in these environments but display it as a yen sign, causing confusion, especially in MS-DOS filenames. Several other ISO 646 versions also replace backslash with other characters, including ‚Ç© (Korean), √ñ (German, Swedish), √ò (Danish, Norwegian), √ß (French) and √ë (Spanish), leading to similar problems, though with less lasting impact compared to the yen sign. RFC 1345 suggests as a unique two-character mnemonic that may be used in internet standards as \\"a practical way of identifying [this] character, without reference to a coded character set and its code in [that] coded character set\\".

During the production process biomass or other carbon-containing materials are gasified within the oxygen-limited environment of a wood gas generator to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide. These gases can then be burnt as a fuel within an oxygen rich environment to produce carbon dioxide, water and heat. In some gasifiers this process is preceded by pyrolysis, where the biomass or coal is first converted to char, releasing methane and tar rich in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.  History  A bus, powered by wood gas generated by a gassifier on a trailer, Leeds, England c.1943 The first wood gasifier was apparently built by Gustav Bischof in 1839. The first vehicle powered by wood gas was built by Thomas Hugh Parker in 1901. Around 1900, many cities delivered syngas (centrally produced, typically from coal) to residences. Natural gas began to be used only in 1930. Wood gas vehicles were used during World War II as a consequence of the rationing of fossil fuels. In Germany alone, around 500,000 \\"producer gas\\" vehicles were in use at the end of the war. Trucks, buses, tractors, motorcycles, ships and trains were equipped with a wood gasification unit. In 1942, when wood gas had not yet reached the height of its popularity, there were about 73,000 wood gas vehicles in Sweden,Ekerholm, Helena.

In 1944, Finland had 43,000 \\"woodmobiles\\", of which 30,000 were buses and trucks, 7,000 private vehicles, 4,000 tractors and 600 boats.Wood gas vehicles: firewood in the fuel tank Low-tech Magazine, January 18, 2010 Wood gasifiers are still manufactured in China and Russia for automobiles and as power generators for industrial applications. Trucks retrofitted with wood gasifiers are used in North Korea in rural areas, particularly on the roads of the east coast.  Usage  =Internal combustion engine = A Wood gas generator fitted to a Ford truck converted into a tractor, Per Larsen Tractor Museum, Sweden, 2003 Wood gasifier system A wood-gas powered car, Berlin, 1946. Note the secondary radiator, required to cool the gas before it is introduced into the engine Wood gasifiers can power either spark ignition engines, where all of the normal fuel can be replaced with little change to the carburation, or in a Diesel engine, feeding the gas into the air inlet that is modified to have a throttle valve, if it didn't have it already. On Diesel engines the Diesel fuel is still needed to ignite the gas mixture, so a mechanically regulated Diesel engine's \\"stop\\" linkage and probably \\"throttle\\" linkage must be modified to always give the engine a little bit of injected fuel, often under the standard idle per-injection volume. Wood can be used to power cars with ordinary internal combustion engines if a wood gasifier is attached. This was quite popular during World War II in several European, African and Asian countries, because the war prevented easy and cost-effective access to oil. In more recent times, wood gas has been suggested as a clean and efficient method to heat and cook in developing countries, or even to produce electricity when combined with an internal combustion engine. Compared to World War II technology, gasifiers have become less dependent on constant attention due to the use of sophisticated electronic control systems, but it remains difficult to get clean gas from them. Purification of the gas and feeding it into natural gas pipelines is one variant to link it to the existing refuelling infrastructure. Liquefaction by the Fischer‚ÄìTropsch process is another possibility. Efficiency of the gasifier system is relatively high. The gasification stage converts about 75% of fuel energy content into a combustible gas that can be used as a fuel for internal combustion engines. Based on long-term practical experiments and over driven with a wood gas- powered car, the energy consumption has been 1.54 times higher compared to the energy demand of the same car on petrol, excluding the energy needed to extract, transport and refine the oil from which petrol is derived, and excluding the energy to harvest, process, and transport the wood to feed the gasifier. This means that of wood combustible matter has been found to be equivalent to of petrol during real transportation in similar driving conditions and with the same, otherwise unmodified, vehicle. This can be considered to be a good result, because no other refining of the fuel is required. This study also considers all possible losses of the wood gas system, like preheating of the system and carrying of the extra weight of the gas-generating system. In power generation, reported demand of fuel is wood combustible matter per kilowatt-hour of electricity. Gasifiers have been built for remote Asian communities using rice hulls, which in many cases have no other use. One installation in Burma uses an 80 kW modified Diesel-powered electric generator for about 500 people who are otherwise without power.Burmese village rice husk gasifier The ash can be used as biochar fertilizer, so this can be considered a renewable fuel. Exhaust gas emission from an internal combustion engine is significantly lower on wood gas than on petrol. Especially the hydrocarbon emissions are low on wood gas. A normal catalytic converter works well with wood gas, but even without it, emission levels less than 20 ppm HC and 0.2% CO can be easily achieved by most automobile engines. Combustion of wood gas generates no particulates, and the gas renders thus very little carbon black amongst motor oil. = Stoves, cooking and furnaces = Coaxial downdraft gasification stove Certain stove designs are, in effect, gasifiers working on the updraft principle: The air passes up through the fuel, which can be a column of rice hulls, and is combusted, then reduced to carbon monoxide by the residual char on the surface. The resulting gas is then burnt by heated secondary air coming up a concentric tube. Such a device behaves very much like a gas stove. This arrangement is also known as a Chinese burner. An alternative stove based on the down-draft principle and typically built with nested cylinders also provides high efficiency. Combustion from the top creates a gasification zone, with the gas escaping downwards through ports located at the base of the burner chamber. The gas mixes with additional incoming air to provide a secondary burn. Most of the CO produced by gasification is oxidized to in the secondary combustion cycle; therefore, gasification stoves carry lower health risks than conventional cooking fires. Another application is the use of producer gas to displace light density fuel oil (LDO) in industrial furnaces. Green hydrogen gas is also extracted from the wood gas which is in turn produced from widely available and carbon neutral biomass.  Production  Fluidized bed gasifier in G√ºssing, Austria, operated on wood chips A wood gasifier takes wood chips, sawdust, charcoal, coal, rubber or similar materials as fuel and burns these incompletely in a fire box, producing wood gas, solid ash and soot, the latter of which have to be removed periodically from the gasifier. The wood gas can then be filtered for tars and soot/ash particles, cooled and directed to an engine or fuel cell.Electricity from wood through the combination of gasification and solid oxide fuel cells, Ph.D. Thesis by Florian Nagel, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, 2008 Most of these engines have strict purity requirements of the wood gas, so the gas often has to pass through extensive gas cleaning in order to remove or convert, i.e., \\"crack\\", tars and particles. The removal of tar is often accomplished by using a water scrubber. Running wood gas in an unmodified gasoline-burning internal combustion engine may lead to problematic accumulation of unburned compounds. The quality of the gas from different gasifiers varies a great deal. Staged gasifiers, where pyrolysis and gasification occur separately, instead of in the same reaction zone as was the case in, e.g., the World War II gasifiers, can be engineered to produce essentially tar-free gas (less than 1 mg/m3), while single-reactor fluidized bed gasifiers may exceed 50,000 mg/m3 tar. The fluidized bed reactors have the advantage of being much more compact, with more capacity per unit volume and price. Depending on the intended use of the gas, tar can be beneficial, as well by increasing the heating value of the gas. The heat of combustion of \\"producer gas\\" ‚Äî a term used in the United States meaning wood gas produced for use in a combustion engine ‚Äî is rather low compared to other fuels. Taylor reports that producer gas has a lower heat of combustion of 5.7 MJ/kg versus 55.9 MJ/kg for natural gas and 44.1 MJ/kg for gasoline. The heat of combustion of wood is typically 15-18 MJ/kg. Presumably, these values can vary somewhat from sample to sample. The same source reports the following chemical composition by volume which most likely is also variable: A charcoal gas producer at the Nambassa alternative festival in New Zealand in 1981 * Nitrogen N2: 50.9% * Carbon monoxide CO: 27.0% * Hydrogen H2: 14.0% * Carbon dioxide CO2: 4.5% * Methane CH4: 3.0% * Oxygen O2: 0.6%. It is pointed out that the gas composition is strongly dependent on the gasification process, the gasification medium (air, oxygen or steam) and the fuel moisture. Steam- gasification processes typically yield high hydrogen contents, downdraft fixed bed gasifiers yield high nitrogen concentrations and low tar loads, while updraft fixed bed gasifiers yield high tar loads.Handbook of Biomass Downdraft Gasifier Engine Systems (Section 5.2 paragraph 2, pg 30), prepared by the Solar Energy Research Institute, U.S. Department of Energy Solar Technical Information Program, Solar Energy Research Institute, 1988 During the production of charcoal for blackpowder, the volatile wood gas is vented.

It can be produced from various fuels by partial combustion with air, usually modified by simultaneous injection of water or steam to maintain a constant temperature and obtain a higher heat content gas by enrichment of air gas with hydrogen. In this respect it is similar to other types of \\"manufactured\\" gas, such as coal gas, coke oven gas, water gas and carburetted water gas. Producer gas was used primarily as an industrial fuel for iron and steel manufacturing, such as firing coke ovens and blast furnaces, cement and ceramic kilns, or for mechanical power through gas engines. It was characteristically low in heating value but cheap to make, so that large amounts could be made and burned. In the USA, producer gas may also be referred to by other names based on the fuel used for production such as wood gas. In the UK, producer gas is generally referred to as suction gas. The term suction refers to the way the air was drawn into the gas generator by an internal combustion engine. Wood gas is produced in a gasifier and used to fire kilns, but the gas generated contains distillates that require scrubbing for use in other applications. Depending on the fuel, a variety of contaminants are produced that will condense out as the gas cools. When producer gas is used to power cars and boatsFarmer, Weston. From My Old Boatshop, 1979 International Marine Publishing, p. 176-198 or distributed to remote locations it is necessary to scrub the gas to remove the materials that can condense and clog carburettors and gas lines. Anthracite and coke are preferred for automotive use because they produce the smallest amount of contamination, allowing smaller, lighter scrubbers to be used. Producer gas is generally made from coke, or other carbonaceous material such as anthracite. Air is passed over the red-hot carbonaceous fuel and carbon monoxide is produced. The reaction is exothermic and proceeds as follows: Formation of producer gas from air and carbon: :C + O ‚Üí CO, +97,600 calories :CO + C ‚Üí 2CO, ‚Äì38,800 calories :2C + O ‚Üí 2CO, +58,800 calories Reactions between steam and carbon: :HO + C ‚Üí H + CO, ‚Äì28,800 calories :2HO + C ‚Üí 2H + CO, ‚Äì18,800 calories Reaction between steam and carbon monoxide: :HO + CO ‚Üí CO + H, +10,000 calories :CO + H ‚Üí CO + HO, ‚Äì10,000 calories The average composition of ordinary producer gas according to Latta was: CO: 5.8%; O: 1.3%; CO: 19.8%; H: 15.1%; CH: 1.3%; N: 56.7%; B.T.U. gross per cu.ft 136 Nisbet Latta, \\"American Producer Gas Practice and Industrial Gas Engineering\\", D. Van Nostrand Company, 1910 , page 107 The concentration of carbon monoxide in the \\"ideal\\" producer gas was considered to be 34.7% carbon monoxide (carbonic oxide) and 65.3% nitrogen.W. J. Atkinson Butterfield, \\"The Chemistry of Gas Manufacture, Volume 1. Materials and Processes\\", Charles Griffin & Company Ltd., London, 1907, page 72 After \\"scrubbing\\", to remove tar, the gas may be used to power gas turbines (which are well-suited to fuels of low calorific value), spark ignited engines (where 100% petrol fuel replacement is possible) or diesel internal combustion engines (where 15% to 40% of the original diesel fuel requirement is still used to ignite the gas ). During World War II in Britain, plants were built in the form of trailers for towing behind commercial vehicles, especially buses, to supply gas as a replacement for petrol (gasoline) fuel. A range of about 80 miles for every charge of anthracite was achieved. In old movies and stories, when describing suicide by \\"turning on the gas\\" and leaving an oven door open without lighting the flame, the reference was to coal gas or town gas. As this gas contained a significant amount of carbon monoxide it was quite toxic. Most town gas was also odorized, if it did not have its own odor. Modern 'natural gas' used in homes is far less toxic, and has a mercaptan added to it for odor for identifying leaks. Various names are used for producer gas, air gas and water gas generally depending on the fuel source, process or end use including: * Air gas: a.k.a. ‚Äúpower gas,‚Äù ‚Äúgenerator gas‚Äù or ‚ÄúSiemens‚Äô producer gas.‚Äù Produced from various fuels by partial combustion with air. Air gas consists principally of carbon monoxide with nitrogen from the air used and a small amount of hydrogen. This term is not commonly used, and tends to be used synonymously with wood gas. * Producer gas: Air gas modified by simultaneous injection of water or steam to maintain a constant temperature and obtain a higher heat content gas by enrichment of air gas with H. Current usage often includes air gas. * Semi- water gas: Producer gas. * Blue water-gas: Air, water or producer gas produced from clean fuels such as coke, charcoal and anthracite which contain insufficient hydrocarbon impurities for use as illuminating gas. Blue gas burns with a blue flame and does not produce light except when used with a Welsbach gas mantle. * Lowe‚Äôs Water Gas: Water gas with a secondary pyrolysis reactor to introduce hydrocarbon gasses for illuminating purposes. CONVERSION OF SOLID FUELS TO LOW BTU GAS Thomas E. Ban McDowell-Wellman Engineering Company Cleveland, Ohio 44110 * Carburetted gas: Any gas produced by a process similar to Lowe‚Äôs in which hydrocarbons are added for illumination purposes. * Wood gas: produced from wood by partial combustion. Sometimes used in a gasifier to power cars with ordinary internal combustion engines. Other similar fuel gasses * Coal Gas or Illuminating gas: Produced from coal by distillation. * Water gas: Produced by injection of steam into fuel preheated by combustion with air. The reaction is endothermic so the fuel must be continually re-heated to keep the reaction going. This was usually done by alternating the steam with an air stream. This name is sometimes used incorrectly when describing carburetted blue water gas simply as blue water gas. * Coke Oven Gas: Coke ovens give off a gas exactly similar to illuminating gas, part of which is used to heat the coal. There may be a large excess, however, which is used for industrial purposes after it has been purified. * syngas, or synthesis gas: (from synthetic gas or synthesis gas) can be applied to any of the above gasses, but generally refers modern industrial processes, such as natural gas reforming, hydrogen production, and processes for synthetic production of methane and other hydrocarbons. * City (Town) gas: any of the above-manufactured gases including producer gas containing sufficient hydrocarbons to produce a bright flame for illumination purposes, originally produced from coal, for sale to consumers and municipalities. Uses and Advantages of Producer Gas: * It is used in furnace. When furnaces are big, no scrubbing etc. is required. When furnace is small, scrubbing is necessary to avoid chocking of small burners. In gas engines, it is used after scrubbing. * There is no loss due to smoke and convection current. * Quantity of air required for the combustion of producer gas is not much above the theoretical quantity while burning solid fuel far more than theoretical quantity is required. So in case of solid fuels, the larger quantity of exhaust gases takes away sensible heat and thus there is loss of heat. * Producer gas is more easily transmitted than solid fuel. * Gas-fired furnaces can be maintained at a constant temperature. * With gas, an oxidising and reducing flame can be obtained. * Heat loss due to converting solid fuel into producer gas can be made in an economic way, * Smoke nuisance can be avoided. * Producer gas can be produced even by the poorest quality of fuel.

The extinction of the light is caused by interstellar dust grains located in the coldest, densest parts of larger molecular clouds. Clusters and large complexes of dark nebulae are associated with Giant Molecular Clouds. Isolated small dark nebulae are called Bok globules. Like other interstellar dust or material, things it obscures are only visible using radio waves in radio astronomy or infrared in infrared astronomy. Dark clouds appear so because of sub-micrometre-sized dust particles, coated with frozen carbon monoxide and nitrogen, which effectively block the passage of light at visible wavelengths. Also present are molecular hydrogen, atomic helium, C18O (CO with oxygen as the 18O isotope), CS, NH3 (ammonia), H2CO (formaldehyde), c-C3H2 (cyclopropenylidene) and a molecular ion N2H+ (diazenylium), all of which are relatively transparent. These clouds are the spawning grounds of stars and planets, and understanding their development is essential to understanding star formation.ESO - eso9934 - Secrets of a Dark Cloud The form of such dark clouds is very irregular: they have no clearly defined outer boundaries and sometimes take on convoluted serpentine shapes. The largest dark nebulae are visible to the naked eye, appearing as dark patches against the brighter background of the Milky Way like the Coalsack Nebula and the Great Rift. These naked-eye objects are sometimes known as dark cloud constellations and take on a variety of names. In the inner outer molecular regions of dark nebulae, important events take place, such as the formation of stars and masers.

There is uncertainty about his birth year; his tombstone gives the date as 1874.The Rough Guide to the Blues Career Born on a plantation in Red Banks, Mississippi, Cannon moved a hundred miles to Clarksdale, then the home of W. C. Handy, at the age of 12. His musical skills came without training; he taught himself to play a banjo that he made from a frying pan and a raccoon skin. He ran away from home at the age of fifteen and began his career entertaining at sawmills and levee and railroad camps in the Mississippi Delta around the turn of the century. While in Clarksdale, Cannon was influenced by two local musicians, Jim Turner and Alec Lee. Turner's fiddle playing in W. C. Handy's band so impressed Cannon that he decided to learn to play the fiddle himself. Lee, a guitarist, taught Cannon his first folk blues, \\"Po' Boy, Long Ways from Home\\", and showed him how to use a knife blade as a slide, a technique that Cannon adapted to his banjo playing.Barlow, William (1989). \\"Looking Up at Down\\": The Emergence of Blues Culture. Temple University Press. pp. 214‚Äì17. . Cannon left Clarksdale around 1907 and soon settled near Memphis, Tennessee, where he played in a jug band led by Jim Guffin. He began playing in Memphis with Jim Jackson. He met the harmonica player Noah Lewis, who introduced him to a young guitar player, Ashley Thompson. Lewis and Thompson later were members of Cannon's Jug Stompers. The three of them formed a band to play at parties and dances. In 1914 Cannon began touring in medicine shows. He supported his family through various jobs, including sharecropping, ditch digging, and yard work, but supplemented his income with music. Cannon began recording, as Banjo Joe, for Paramount Records in 1927. At that session he was backed by Blind Blake. After the success of the Memphis Jug Band's first records, he quickly assembled a jug band, Cannon's Jug Stompers, featuring Lewis and Thompson (later replaced by Elijah Avery). The group was first recorded at the Memphis Auditorium for Victor Records in January 1928. Hosea Woods joined the Jug Stompers in the late 1920s, playing guitar, banjo and kazoo and providing some vocals. Cannon's Jug Stompers' recording of \\"Big Railroad Blues\\" is available on the compilation album The Music Never Stopped: Roots of the Grateful Dead. Although their last recordings were made in 1930, Cannon's Jug Stompers were one of Beale Street's most popular jug bands through the 1930s. A few songs Cannon recorded with the Jug Stompers are \\"Minglewood Blues\\", \\"Pig Ankle Strut\\", \\"Wolf River Blues\\", \\"Viola Lee Blues\\", \\"White House Station\\" and \\"Walk Right In\\" (a pop hit for The Rooftop Singers in the 1960s and for Dr. Hook in the 1970s). By the end of the 1930s, Cannon had effectively retired, although he occasionally performed as a solo musician. Cannon made a few recordings for Folkways Records in 1956. During the blues revival of the 1960s, he made some appearances at colleges and coffee houses with Furry Lewis and Bukka White, but he had to pawn his banjo to pay his heating bill the winter before The Rooftop Singers had a hit with \\"Walk Right In\\".Bronson, Fred (2003). \\"Walk Right In\\", in The Billboard Book of #1 Hits. 5th ed. New York: Billboard Publications. In the wake of becoming a hit composer, he recorded an album for Stax Records in 1963, with fellow Memphis musicians Will Shade (the former leader of the Memphis Jug Band) on jug and Milton Roby on washboard. Cannon performed traditional songs, including \\"Kill It\\", \\"Salty Dog\\", \\"Going Around\\", \\"The Mountain\\", \\"Ol' Hen\\". \\"Gonna Raise a Ruckus Tonight\\", \\"Ain't Gonna Rain No More\\", \\"Boll-Weevil\\", \\"Come On down to My House\\", \\"Make Me a Pallet on Your Floor\\", \\"Get Up in the Morning Soon\\", and \\"Crawdad Hole\\", along with his own \\"Walk Right In\\", with stories and introductions between songs.Vladimir, Bogdanov (2003).

His writings display a deep curiosity towards the natural world, influenced by the scientific revolution of Baconian enquiry and are permeated by references to Classical and Biblical sources as well as the idiosyncrasies of his own personality. Although often described as suffused with melancholia, Browne's writings are also characterised by wit and subtle humour, while his literary style is varied, according to genre, resulting in a rich, unique prose which ranges from rough notebook observations to polished Baroque eloquence.  Biography  = Early life = The son of Thomas Browne, a silk merchant from Upton, Cheshire, and Anne Browne, the daughter of Paul Garraway of Sussex, he was born in the parish of St Michael, Cheapside, in London on 19 October 1605.R. H. Robbins, \\"Browne, Sir Thomas (1605‚Äì1682)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2008 accessed 16 Feb 2013 His father died while he was still young and his mother married Sir Thomas Dutton (1575‚Äì1634). Browne was sent to school at Winchester College. In 1623, he went to Broadgates Hall of Oxford University. Browne was chosen to deliver the undergraduate oration when the hall was incorporated as Pembroke College in August 1624. He graduated from Oxford in January 1627, after which he studied medicine at Padua and Montpellier universities, completing his studies at Leiden, where he received a medical degree in 1633. He settled in Norwich in 1637 and practised medicine there until his death in 1682. In 1641, he married Dorothy Mileham (1621-1685), of Burlingham St Peter, Norfolk. She bore him ten children, six of whom died before their parents. =Literary works= Lady Dorothy Browne and Sir Thomas Browne, by Joan Carlile, c. 1641 ‚Äì 1650 Browne's first literary work was Religio Medici (The Religion of a Physician) which was circulated as a manuscript among his friends. It surprised him when an unauthorised edition appeared in 1642, since the work included several unorthodox religious speculations. An authorised text appeared in 1643, with some of the more controversial views removed. The expurgation did not end the controversy: in 1645, Alexander Ross attacked Religio Medici in his Medicus Medicatus (The Doctor, Doctored) and, in common with much Protestant literature, the book was placed upon the Papal Index Librorum Prohibitorum in the same year.J. S. Finch A doctor's Life of Faith and Science. Princeton 1950 In 1646 Browne published his encyclopaedia, Pseudodoxia Epidemica, or, Enquiries into Very many Received Tenets, and commonly Presumed Truths, the title of which refers to the prevalence of false beliefs and \\"vulgar errors\\". A sceptical work that debunks a number of legends circulating at the time in a methodical and witty manner, it displays the Baconian side of Browne--the side that was unafraid of what at the time was still called \\"the new learning\\". The book is significant in the history of science because it promoted an awareness of up-to-date scientific journalism. Browne's last publication during his lifetime were two philosophical Discourses which are closely related to each other in concept. The first, Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial, or a Brief Discourse of the Sepulchral Urns lately found in Norfolk (1658) inspired by the discovery of some Bronze Age burials in earthenware vessels found in Norfolk, resulted in a literary meditation upon death, the funerary customs of the world and the ephemerality of fame. The other discourse in the diptych is antithetical in style, subject-matter and imagery. The Garden of Cyrus, or The Quincuncial Lozenge, or Network Plantations of the Ancients, Artificially, Naturally, and Mystically Considered (1658) features the quincunx which is used by Browne to demonstrate evidence of the Platonic forms in art and nature.Frank Huntley, Sir Thomas Browne : A biographical and Critical Study Ann Arbor University of Michigan Press, 1962 = Later life and knighthood = An illustration of Sir Thomas Browne's house in Norwich In Religio Medici, Browne confirmed his belief, in accordance with the vast majority of seventeenth century European society, in the existence of angels and witchcraft. He attended the 1662 Bury St Edmunds witch trial, where his citation of a similar trial in Denmark may have influenced the jury's minds of the guilt of two accused women, who were subsequently executed for witchcraft. In 1671 King Charles II, accompanied by the Court, visited Norwich. The courtier John Evelyn, who had occasionally corresponded with Browne, took good use of the royal visit to call upon \\"the learned doctor\\" of European fame and wrote of his visit, \\"His whole house and garden is a paradise and Cabinet of rarities and that of the best collection, amongst Medails, books, Plants, natural things\\".The Diary of John Evelyn ed. John Eve pub. Everyman (2003) During his visit, Charles visited Browne's home. A banquet was held in St Andrew's Hall for the royal visit. Obliged to honour a notable local, the name of the Mayor of Norwich was proposed to the King for knighthood. The Mayor, however, declined the honour and proposed Browne's name instead.Simon Wilkins Supplementary Memoir citing Francis Blomefield Sir Thomas Browne Collected Works Vol. I pub. 1836 = Death and aftermath = will, dated 2 December 1679 Browne died on 19 October 1682, his 77th birthday, and was buried in the chancel of St Peter Mancroft, Norwich. His skull was removed when his lead coffin was accidentally re-opened by workmen in 1840. It was not re-interred in St Peter Mancroft until 4 July 1922 when it was recorded in the burial register as aged 317 years.Colin Dickey. The Fate of His Bones // Cabinet Magazine. Issue 28: Bones. Winter 2007/08. Browne's coffin plate, which was stolen the same time as his skull, was also eventually recovered, broken into two halves, one of which is on display at St Peter Mancroft. Alluding to the commonplace opus of alchemy it reads, Amplissimus Vir Dns. Thomas Browne, Miles, Medicinae Dr., Annos Natus 77 Denatus 19 Die mensis Octobris, Anno. Dni. 1682, hoc Loculo indormiens. Corporis Spagyrici pulvere plumbum in aurum Convertit. ‚Äî translated from Latin as \\"The esteemed Gentleman Thomas Browne, Knight, Doctor of Medicine, 77 years old, died on the 19th of October in the year of Our Lord 1682 and lies sleeping in this coffin. With the dust of his alchemical body he converts lead into gold\\". The origin of the invented word spagyrici are from the Greek of: Spao to tear open, + ageiro to collect, a signature neologism coined by Paracelsus to define his medicine-oriented alchemy; the origins of iatrochemistry, being first advanced by him. Browne's coffin-plate verse, along with the collected works of Paracelsus and several followers of the Swiss physician listed in his library, are evidence that although sometimes highly critical of Paracelsus, nevertheless, like the 'Luther of Medicine', he believed in palingenesis, physiognomy, alchemy, astrology and the kabbalah.Manchester Guardian 19 October 1905 The Library of Sir Thomas Browne was held in the care of his eldest son Edward until 1708. The auction of Browne and his son Edward's libraries in January 1711 was attended by Hans Sloane. Editions from the library were subsequently included in the founding collection of the British Library.A Facsimile of the 1711 Sales Auction Catalogue of Sir Thomas Browne and his son Edward's Libraries. Introduction, notes and index by J.S. Finch (E.J. Brill: Leiden, 1986) Page 7 Autobiography On 14 March 1673, Browne sent a short autobiography to the antiquarian John Aubrey, presumably for Aubrey's collection of Brief Lives, which provides an introduction to his life and writings. :...I was born in St Michael's Cheap in London, went to school at Winchester College, then went to Oxford, spent some years in foreign parts, was admitted to be a Socius Honorarius of the College of Physicians in London, Knighted September 1671, when the King Charles II, the Queen and Court came to Norwich.

Have some miscellaneous tracts which may be published...(Letters 376) Literary influence Title page of 1658 edition of Urn-Burial together with The Garden of Cyrus Browne is widely considered one of the most original writers in the English language. The freshness and ingenuity of his mind invested everything he touched with interest; while on more important subjects his style, if frequently ornate and Latinate, often rises to the highest pitch of stately eloquence. His paradoxical place in the history of ideas, as equally, a devout Christian, a promoter of the new inductive science and adherent of ancient esoteric learning, have greatly contributed to his ambiguity in the history of ideas. For these reasons, one literary critic succinctly assessed him as \\"an instance of scientific reason lit up by mysticism in the Church of England\\".Sencourt R., Outflying Philosophy: A Literary Study of the Religious Element in the Poems and Letters of John Donne and in the Works of Sir Thomas Browne., Ardent Media, 1925, p. 126 However, the complexity of Browne's labyrinthine thought processes, his highly stylised language, along with his many allusions to Biblical, Classical and contemporary learning, along with esoteric authors, are each contributing factors for why he remains obscure, little-read, and, thus, misunderstood. Browne appears at No. 69 in the Oxford English Dictionarys list of top cited sources. He has 775 entries in the OED of first usage of a word, is quoted in a total of 4131 entries of first evidence of a word, and is quoted 1596 times as first evidence of a particular meaning of a word. Examples of his coinages, many of which are of a scientific or medical nature, include 'ambidextrous', 'antediluvian', 'analogous', 'approximate', 'ascetic', 'anomalous', 'carnivorous', 'coexistence', 'coma', 'compensate', 'computer', 'cryptography', 'cylindrical', 'disruption', 'ergotisms', 'electricity', 'exhaustion', 'ferocious', 'follicle', 'generator', 'gymnastic', 'hallucination', 'herbaceous', 'holocaust', 'insecurity', 'indigenous', 'jocularity', 'literary', 'locomotion', 'medical', 'migrant', 'mucous', 'prairie', 'prostate', 'polarity', 'precocious', 'pubescent', 'therapeutic', 'suicide', 'ulterior', 'ultimate' and 'veterinarian'.Adam Nicolson, The Century That Wrote Itself, BBC Four, 21 April 2013 The influence of his literary style spans four centuries. *In the 18th century, Samuel Johnson, who shared Browne's love of the Latinate, wrote a brief Life in which he praised Browne as a faithful Christian and assessed his prose thus: *In the 19th century Browne's reputation was revived by the Romantics. Thomas De Quincey, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Charles Lamb (who considered himself the rediscoverer of Browne) were all admirers. Carlyle was also influenced by him.Reid Barbour, Thomas Browne A Life OUP 2013 *The American novelist Herman Melville, heavily influenced by his style, deemed him a \\"crack'd Archangel.\\"(quoted in the Historical Note, Elizabeth S. Foster, page 661: \\"He has borrowed Sir Thomas Brown[e] of me,\\" Evert A. Duyckinck wrote his brother on 18 March 1848, \\"and says finely of the speculations of the Religio Medici that Browne is a kind of 'crack'd Archangel!' Was ever anything of this sort said before by a sailor?\\" in \\"Mardi and A Voyage Thither,\\" Northwestern University Press, c. 1970, paper bound edition) *The epigraph of Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\" (1841) is from Browne's Hydriotaphia,(Chap.5): \\"What song the Syrens sang, or what name Achilles assumed when he hid himself among women, although puzzling questions, are not beyond all conjecture\\". * The novelist Joseph Conrad prefaced his 1913 novel Chance with a quotation by Browne. *The English author Virginia Woolf wrote two short essays about him, observing in 1923, \\"Few people love the writings of Sir Thomas Browne, but those that do are the salt of the earth.\\"review by Woolf of the Golden Cockerel edition of the Works of Sir Thomas Browne, published in Times Literary Supplement (1923) In the 20th century those who have admired Browne include: * The American natural historian and palaeontologist Stephen Jay Gould.\\"Age-Old Fallacies of Thinking and Stinking\\", in \\"I Have Landed: Splashes and Reflections in Natural History\\" * The theosophist Madame Blavatsky.Isis Unveiled 1877 vol. 1 H.P.

Laing, who opens his work The Politics of Experience with a quotation by him : \\" thus is man that great and true Amphibian whose nature is disposed to live not only like other creatures in divers elements, but in divided and distinguished worlds.\\"from Religio medici, cf. Laing R., (1967), The Politics of Experience and The Bird of Paradise, Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, p. 15 * The composer William Alwyn wrote a symphony in 1973 based upon the rhythmical cadences of Browne's literary work Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial.Naxos B000A17GGK Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra David Lloyd-Jones 2005 * The American author Armistead Maupin includes a quote from Religio Medici in the preface to the third in his Tales of the City novels, Further Tales of the City, first published in 1982. * The Canadian physician William Osler (1849‚Äì1919), the \\"founding father of modern medicine\\", was a well-read admirer of Browne. * The German author W. G. Sebald wrote of Browne in his semi-autobiographical novel The Rings of Saturn (1995). * The Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges alluded to Browne throughout his literary writings, from his first publication, Fervor de Buenos Aires (1923) until his last years. He described Browne as \\"the best prose writer in the English language\\". Such was his admiration of Browne as a literary stylist and thinker that late in his life (Interview 25 April 1980) he stated of himself, alluding to his self-portrait in \\"Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\\" (1940): * In his short story \\"The Celestial Omnibus\\", published in 1911, E. M. Forster makes Browne the first \\"driver\\" that the young protagonist encounters on the magical omnibus line that transports its passengers to a place of direct experience of the aesthetic sublime reserved for those who internalise the experience of poetry, as opposed to those who merely acquire familiarity with literary works for snobbish prestige.Forster, E.M., Selected Stories, Penguin Classics, 2001, pp.30-46, The story is an allegory about true appreciation of poetry and literature versus pedantry. * In North Towards Home, Willie Morris quotes Sir Thomas Browne's Urn Burial from memory as he walks up Park Avenue with William Styron: \\"'And since death must be the Lucina of life, and even Pagans could doubt, whether thus to live were to die; since our longest sun sets at right descensions, and makes but winter arches, and therefore it cannot be long before we lie down in darkness and have our light in ashes...' At that instant I was almost clipped by a taxicab, and the driver stuck his head out and yelled, 'Aincha got eyes in that head, ya bum?'\\"Willie Morris, North Towards Home, New York: Vintage; part 3 (page 313 ff); ; The quote is from Chapter 5. * William Styron prefaced his 1951 novel Lie Down in Darkness with the same quotation as noted above in the remarks about Willie Morris's memoir. The title of Styron's novel itself comes from that quotation. * Spanish writer Javier Mar√≠as translated two works of Browne into Spanish, Religio Medici and Hydriotaphia.La religi√≥n de un m√©dico. El enterramiento en urnas (Hydriotaphia).

Since 1992 the lineup has consisted of Ira Kaplan (guitars, piano, vocals), Georgia Hubley (drums, piano, vocals), and James McNew (bass, vocals). In 2015, original guitarist Dave Schramm rejoined the band and appears on their fourteenth album, Stuff Like That There. Despite achieving limited mainstream success, Yo La Tengo has been called \\"the quintessential critics' band\\" and maintains a strong cult following. Though they mostly play original material, the band performs a wide repertoire of cover songs both in live performance and on record. History =Formation and early history, 1984‚Äì85= Ira Kaplan and Georgia Hubley formed the band as a couple in 1984. They chose the name \\"Yo La Tengo\\" (Spanish for \\"I have it\\", referring to a female-gender object or person). The name came from a baseball anecdote that occurred during the 1962 season, when New York Mets center fielder Richie Ashburn and shortstop Elio Chac√≥n found themselves colliding in the outfield. When Ashburn went for a catch, he would scream, \\"I got it! I got it!\\" only to run into Chac√≥n, a Venezuelan who spoke only Spanish. Ashburn learned to yell, \\"¬°Yo la tengo! ¬°Yo la tengo!\\" instead. In a later game, Ashburn happily saw Chac√≥n backing off. He relaxed, positioned himself to catch the ball, and was instead run over by left fielder Frank Thomas, who understood no Spanish and had missed a team meeting that proposed using the words \\"¬°Yo la tengo!\\" as a way to avoid outfield collisions. After getting up, Thomas asked Ashburn, \\"What the hell is a Yellow Tango?\\". Kaplan and Hubley placed an advertisement to recruit other musicians who shared their love for bands such as the Soft Boys, Mission of Burma, and Arthur Lee's Love. The group's debut recording was a 7\\" single entitled \\"The River of Water\\" backed with a cover of Lee's \\"A House Is Not a Motel\\", released in late 1985 with Dave Schramm on lead guitar and Dave Rick on bass. After recording \\"Private Doberman\\" for inclusion on a Coyote Records compilation entitled Luxury Condos Coming to Your Neighborhood Soon, Rick left the band and was replaced by Mike Lewis, the founding bass player of Boston garage-punk bands DMZ and Lyres, who was also a member of Brooklyn garage rock band the A-Bones throughout his tenure in YLT. =Early releases, 1986‚Äì89= In 1986, Yo La Tengo released their first LP, Ride the Tiger on Coyote Records. Produced by former Mission of Burma bassist Clint Conley who also took over bass duties on three songs, the album \\"marked Yo La Tengo as a band with real potential\\" according to reviewer Mark Deming. Kaplan was credited as \\"naive guitar\\" on the sleeve, and in the liner notes for the 1993 reissue of the album on City Slang Records, went so far as to say \\"Dave's guitar playing is inarguably the best thing about the record.\\" Schramm and Lewis left the band after the album's release, with Kaplan subsequently taking on the role of lead guitar and Stephan Wichnewski joining to play bass. The group's next album New Wave Hot Dogs (1987) sold poorly, but in the words of Mark Deming, \\"was a quantum leap over the sound of their debut.\\" The release of President Yo La Tengo in 1989 did much to establish the band's reputation among rock critics including Robert Christgau who praised the \\"mysterioso guitar hook\\" in the first song titled \\"Barnaby, Hardly Working\\". Produced by Gene Holder of The dB's, the album was the band's last release on Coyote. Despite the positive reception of the album, sales were still poor and Wichnewski left the band not long after. Hubley and Kaplan carried on as a duo and began playing two-electric-guitar shows. Kaplan, though typically a pragmatist, started carrying a bug trapped in amber in his pocket for luck. =Bar/None and Alias Records, 1990‚Äì92= Yo La Tengo reunited with Dave Schramm in 1990 to record Fakebook, an album of mostly acoustic tunes, including covers of Cat Stevens, Gene Clark, The Kinks, Daniel Johnston, among others, with five original songs by the band themselves, including an acoustic version of Barnaby Hardly Working. Again produced by Gene Holder, the album's folk sound was a change of pace for the band. Years later, Kaplan recalled that the album was \\"just me and Georgia looking for an excuse to record with Dave Schramm and Al Greller\\" who played guitar and double bass on the album, respectively. In 1991, with Dave Schramm in tow, Yo La Tengo collaborated with Daniel Johnston on the song \\"Speeding Motorcycle\\" which was released as a single. The band also released a 7\\" single on Bar/None Records with the song \\"Walking Away from You\\" backed with a cover of Beat Happening's \\"Cast a Shadow.\\" Gene Holder produced the single and played the bass. The That Is Yo La Tengo EP released later that year included some tracks that would end up on the group's next LP. After the release of That Is Yo La Tengo, James McNew (who also records under the solo moniker Dump) began playing bass with the band, forming the trio that continues to make up the band today. According to McNew, The band recorded May I Sing with Me in Boston with Holder producing and Lou Giordano engineering. The album was released on Alias Records in 1992. Three of the album's eleven songs (\\"Swing for Life\\", \\"Out the Window\\" and \\"Five-Cornered Drone\\") were carried over from the That Is Yo La Tengo EP and feature Holder on bass. The Upside-Down EP was released on CD in support of the album, rounding out the band's releases on Alias. =Early Matador period, 1993‚Äì2000= In 1993, Yo La Tengo began their partnership with Matador Records, releasing a 7\\" and CD5 of the song \\"Shaker\\" which the band recorded with John Siket in New Jersey. The following LP, 1993's Painful, was also the beginning of the band's fruitful creative partnership with producer Roger Moutenot, who has produced all of their subsequent albums up until 2013's Fade, which was produced by John McEntire. Painful is the first Yo La Tengo album to feature James McNew on every song. Ira Kaplan explains: Rob Sheffield, writing in The New Rolling Stone Album Guide remarked that McNew \\"became an essential part of the sound on Painful, the 1993 album that kept every promise Yo La Tengo ever made and blew their previous highlights away.\\" Portions posted at Critical reaction was quite positive, with reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine calling it \\"a subtly addicting album.\\" Robert Christgau also praised the group once again, writing in his review that Yo La Tengo is \\"always friendly. This is not the forbidding experimentation of an aspiring vanguard. This is the fooling around of folks who like to go out on Saturday night and make some noise‚Äîand then go home humming it.\\" The band released Electr-O-Pura in 1995 to similar acclaim. For the first time, all songs were credited to the band as a whole rather than individual members; this became the norm for all future releases. The band's 1997 LP I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One synthesized the group's eclectic combination of folk, punk rock, shoegazing, long instrumental noise-jams, and electronic music into a sprawling, multi-faceted style. Critical reaction was extremely positive; Pitchfork awarded the album a 9.7 out of 10, and AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that it was \\"arguably Yo La Tengo's finest and most coherent album to date.\\" Kaplan recalled a turning point in the band's musical progression: With their critical reputation higher than ever before, the band toured extensively and their fan base continued to grow. In 1998, they collaborated with Jad Fair and released the album Strange but True to mixed reviews. Yo La Tengo had a cameo role as a Salvation Army band in the 1998 Hal Hartley film The Book of Life, and feature on its 1999 soundtrack release. The band entered the studio again in late 1999 to record their ninth LP. And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out was released in February 2000 to a warm reception. The album features some intimate songs with hushed, varied instrumentation and includes the 17-minute meditation \\"Night Falls On Hoboken\\". =Continued acclaim and soundtrack work, 2001‚Äìpresent= In 2001, Yo La Tengo recorded an instrumental score for eight short undersea documentaries by Jean Painlev√©, entitled The Sounds of the Sounds of Science. The program debuted at the San Francisco Film Festival and has been performed live approximately twelve times. The band also released an EP with covers of Sun Ra's \\"Nuclear War\\" in late 2002. The band's tenth LP, Summer Sun, was released in 2003. Although the album received generally favorable reviews, some critics found the album's quiet atmosphere \\"underwhelming.\\" Others criticized the band for a perceived lack of invention. When asked about the album's quiet nature, Kaplan stated, Battery Park, New York City, July 4, 2005 Yo La Tengo collaborated with Yoko Ono on the 2003 charity album Wig in a Box: Songs from and Inspired by Hedwig and the Angry Inch in support of the Harvey Milk High School. The band put together their first \\"best of\\" compilation entitled Prisoners of Love: A Smattering of Scintillating Senescent Songs: 1985‚Äì2003 which was released in 2005. They composed scores for four more films, 2005's Junebug and Game 6, and 2006's Shortbus and Old Joy. Their scores for these four films were collected on the 2008 compilation They Shoot, We Score. Their eleventh LP, I Am Not Afraid of You and I Will Beat Your Ass, was released in 2006 to universal acclaim. Informed by their soundtrack work, the arrangements included more strings and horns than any of the band's previous albums. Kaplan told an interviewer: \\"I think we gained an element of comfort with using that kind of instrumentation, and it became something we could draw on for our other songs.\\" In addition, the album was book-ended with two guitar jams lasting over ten minutes each. In 2006, the band released Yo La Tengo Is Murdering the Classics, a compilation of their live impromptu cover-song performances on the New Jersey freeform radio station, WFMU. As part of the station's annual fundraising marathon, listeners who call in to pledge money to the station may request a favorite which the band will then perform on the spot. In late 2007, the band began performing acoustically for \\"The Freewheelin' Yo La Tengo\\" tour. Audiences were encouraged to request songs and ask questions which, Kaplan stated, the band tried to answer \\"in a strategic manner so that the answers to the questions will lead to the next song.\\" In March 2008, Yo La Tengo performed under the alias \\"Condo Fucks\\" at Brooklyn's Magnetic Field. As Condo Fucks, the band released an album of cover songs, Fuckbook, on Matador in March 2009. Popular Songs, the band's 12th album, was released on September 8, 2009. The album was recorded in the band's rehearsal space in New Jersey and features two songs with elaborate string sections (composed by jazz composer Richard Evans). It entered the Billboard chart at No. 58, the highest entry of the band's career thus far. In 2009, Yo La Tengo contributed to Stroke: Songs for Chris Knox, a tribute album for New Zealand rock and roll musician Chris Knox who suffered a stroke in June 2009. Yo La Tengo covered Knox's song \\"Coloured\\". All proceeds from the album go towards Knox's recovery. Also in 2009, Yo La Tengo contributed a cover of the song \\"Gentle Hour\\" to the AIDS benefit album, Dark Was the Night, produced by the Red Hot Organization. Preceding their album Popular Songs, Yo La Tengo released an EP entitled Here to Fall Remixes in the summer of 2010. Remixes of their single Here to Fall were done by De La Soul, RJD2, and Pete Rock. This was Yo La Tengo's third out-of-the-box remix EP in 14 years, following the Autumn Sweater and Danelectro Remix EPs. In 2012 Yo La Tengo recorded a cover of Todd Rundgren's \\"I Saw the Light\\" for a fund raising cd titled \\"Super Hits Of The Seventies\\" for radio station WFMU. In August 2012, they announced the release of an EP in September 2012 to be followed by a full-length album in January 2013. The EP includes three versions of the song \\"Stupid Things\\": the single version, a remix by EY∆é, and the original 12-minute instrumental version. The following album, Fade, was released on January 15, 2013. In 2014 they toured and performed live onstage as film maker Sam Green live narrated an evolving version of his new film The Love Song of R. Buckminster Fuller in Austin, Burlington, Detroit, Ithaca, Portland, New Orleans and Vancouver. In 2014, they played an Indiana-based Night Ranger cover band Bobby Night Ranger in the final episode of season 6 of the television series Parks and Recreation. On August 28, 2015, Yo La Tengo released Stuff Like That There, an album (and \\"a sequel of sorts to Fakebook\\") of re-recorded versions of some of their old songs as well as covers, including songs by The Cure, Hank Williams, and Sun Ra. In 2016, the band released Murder in the Second Degree, a second compilation of their live impromptu cover-song performances on the New Jersey freeform radio station, WFMU. In 2017, the band played two dates in New York City with Robyn Hitchcock. The performances included the Hitchcock album \\"Black Snake Diamond Role\\" in its entirety, as well as collections of classic Hitchcock songs and covers of other artists. In 2018, Yo La Tengo released their 15th studio album, There's a Riot Going On, which Pitchfork decided 'reflects the group's greatest and most instantly recognizable strengths'. In 2020, Yo La Tengo released We Have Amnesia Sometimes which was recorded over a 10-day period from late April to early May amid the coronavirus pandemic. The album consists of five instrumental, ambient compositions which were recorded with one microphone in the room and the band spread out adhering to social distance protocols laid out by Governor Murphy of New Jersey. Members Yo La Tengo have always had the core members Ira Kaplan and Georgia Hubley. They have had 14 bass players. James McNew has been the bass player since 1992's May I Sing With Me. ;Current * Ira Kaplan ‚Äì lead vocals and backing vocals, guitar, keyboard (1984‚Äìpresent) * Georgia Hubley ‚Äì drums, lead and backing vocals, percussion, keyboard (1984‚Äìpresent) * James McNew ‚Äì bass, guitar, percussion, keyboard, lead and backing vocals (1992‚Äìpresent) ;Past * Dave Schramm ‚Äì lead guitar (1985‚Äì1986, 2015) * Dave Rick ‚Äì bass (1985) * Mike Lewis ‚Äì bass (1985‚Äì1986) * Stephan Wichnewski ‚Äì bass (1987‚Äì1989) Discography *Ride the Tiger (1986) *New Wave Hot Dogs (1987) *President Yo La Tengo (1989) *Fakebook (1990) *May I Sing with Me (1992) *Painful (1993) *Electr-O-Pura (1995) *I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One (1997) *And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside- Out (2000) *Summer Sun (2003) *I Am Not Afraid of You and I Will Beat Your Ass (2006) *Popular Songs (2009) *Fade (2013) *Stuff Like That There (2015) *There's a Riot Going On (2018) *We Have Amnesia Sometimes (2020) References External links * Official site * Matador Records' official site * *Music Guide to Yo La Tengo at pontone.pl * Bar/None Records Yo La Tengo page 1984 establishments in New Jersey Indie rock musical groups from New Jersey Matador Records artists American musical trios Musical groups established in 1984 Arts & Crafts Productions artists Noise pop musical groups Dream pop musical groups American experimental rock groups Musicians from Hoboken, New Jersey City Slang artists Musical groups from New Jersey ","title":"Yo La Tengo"},{"id":"174839","text":"Austin City Limits is an American public television music program recorded live in Austin, Texas, by PBS member television station KLRU, and broadcast on many PBS stations around the United States. The show helped Austin to become widely known as the \\"Live Music Capital of the World\\", and is the only television show to receive the National Medal of Arts, which it was awarded in 2003. It also won a rare institutional Peabody Award in 2011 \\"for its more than three decades of presenting and preserving eclectic American musical genres.\\"72nd Annual Peabody Awards, May 2012 Austin City Limits is produced by PBS affiliate station Austin PBS (previously KLRU) under the Capital of Texas Public Telecommunications Council. The show was created in 1974 by Bill Arhos, Bruce Scafe, and Paul Bosner. Beginning in season 15 (1990), Austin City Limits began broadcasting in Dolby Surround, and continued until season 24 (1999). Beginning in season 33 (2007‚Äì08), the show began broadcasting in widescreen HDTV 1080i. From 1976 to 2004 (seasons 1-29), the show was broadcast in SDTV 480i. From 2004 to 2007 (seasons 30-32), the show was broadcast in HDTV 720p. Format Each episode began with a preview of the artist as read by longtime narrator Terry Lickona, which leads into an opening credit sequence. After the credits, Lickona would introduce the artist. The camera was positioned during the performance, so that various closeup shots can be seen. After the performance, there was an interview segment. After the interview segment, Lickona would introduce our next artist, and another interview segment, followed by the closing credits. The show consisted of two artists in a half-hour format, as well as one artist in a one hour format. Beginning in season 30 (2004-2005) and continuing to today, Lickona would ask the artist a question. The show was originally taped at KLRU's Studio 6A during the first 36 seasons (1976-2011). Beginning in season 37 (2011-2012), the show moved to its current home at the Moody Theater. Beginning in season 46, Lickona appeared on camera to introduce that night's artists, as well as the interview segments, rather than introducing the artist in a voiceover narration. Songwriters Special Beginning in season 5 (1980), Austin City Limits introduced its Songwriters Special, which remained in use until season 34 (2008-2009). The first Songwriters Special teamed up with Willie Nelson, Floyd Tillman, Hank Cochran, Red Lane, Whitey Shafer, and Sonny Throckmorton. Television pilot The pilot was shot on October 17, 1974, and starred Willie Nelson. (B.W. Stevenson was actually taped the night before, but the recording was deemed unusable.) The deliberate lack of production slickness plus attention to audio detail pleased even the notoriously TV-shy Nelson. Lead Marketer Ken Waggoner, and ACL creator Bill Arhos pitched the pilot to PBS as part of its 1975 pledge drive. The show's success as a fundraiser was enough for Arhos to get ACL green-lighted as a series. Availability The show inspired the creation of the Austin City Limits Music Festival, an annual live music festival at Zilker Park in Austin. In 1982, Bill Arhos returned to Austin City Limits as the executive producer starting in season 7, and he stayed until his retirement in season 24 (1999). In 2015, Arhos died at the age of 80. In 2014, he was inducted into the Austin City Limits Hall of Fame. Some of the performances from Austin City Limits have been released as CDs and DVDs in the Live from Austin, TX series. Full episodes can also be viewed online at the show's official website. There is an Austin City Limits store at the Austin Bergstrom International Airport. On June 21, 2012, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, Ohio, announced that nearly 40 years of Austin City Limits footage would be digitally archived \\"in perpetuity\\" at the Museum's new Library and Archives; recordings from more than 800 live performances will be made available to the public. On September 9, 2018, Austin City Limits Radio was launched in Austin at 97.1FM, with an eclectic playlist representative of the television show's history. Syndication In 1981, Austin City Limits began syndicating to local stations under the moniker Austin City Limits Encore. MTV Live (formerly Palladia HD) acquired rerun rights to the series in 2016 under the moniker Best of Austin City Limits. From 2002 to 2003, CMT repackaged several country music-themed episodes under the moniker Best of Austin City Limits. When Austin City Limits aired on CMT, episodes ran for 42 minutes to make room for commercials, and began with an introduction by Charlie Robison, and Tara McNamara. From 1992 to 1993, TNN repackaged older Austin City Limits performers under the moniker Austin Encore. The program also aired on CMT Canada from 1998 to 2002. Production Terry Lickona ‚Äì Producer of Austin City Limits (January 25, 1979‚Äìpresent) The executive producer of Austin City Limits is Terry Lickona, who joined the program in 1979 during season 4, where he started off as a producer. The first director of Austin City Limits was Bruce Scafe, who was the director for the show's first two seasons in 1976 and 1977; Charles Vaughn took over as producer-director in season 3 (1978); Clark Santee took over as director in season 4 (1979); Allan Muir took over as director in season 5 (1980), and he continued until season 7 (1982); Gary Menotti replaced Allan Muir as the show's current director starting in season 8 (1983). Venue Austin City Limits sign at ACL Live ‚Äì Moody Theater in Austin, TX (2012) For the first 36 seasons, Austin City Limits was taped in its original home at Studio 6A in the Communications Building B on the University of Texas at Austin campus, on a stage featuring a mock skyline of Austin in the background, which was introduced in season 7 (1982). The studio had a seating capacity of approximately 800, but due to limited access to fire exits the audience size was limited to 300. In 2010, the show and its original studio were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. A plaque near the entrance to Communications Building B commemorating the occasion proclaims Austin City Limits as the \\"longest running music show in the history of American television.\\" On February 26, 2011, Austin City Limits held its first taping in its new purpose-built Austin City Limits Live at The Moody Theater (ACL Live) and studio in downtown Austin's Block 21. The additional seating capacity is used for an estimated 100 concerts and 100 private events per year at the venue. 40th season On December 2, 2014, in celebration of Austin City Limits' 40th season, a DVD titled Austin City Limits Celebrates 40 Years was released.

Etymology The name actinolite is derived from the Greek word aktis (), meaning \\"beam\\" or \\"ray\\", because of the mineral's fibrous nature. Mineralogy Actinolite is an intermediate member in a solid-solution series between magnesium-rich tremolite, , and iron-rich ferro-actinolite, . Mg and Fe ions can be freely exchanged in the crystal structure. Like tremolite, asbestiform actinolite is regulated as asbestos. Occurrence Actinolite is commonly found in metamorphic rocks, such as contact aureoles surrounding cooled intrusive igneous rocks. It also occurs as a product of metamorphism of magnesium-rich limestones. The old mineral name uralite is at times applied to an alteration product of primary pyroxene by a mixture composed largely of actinolite. The metamorphosed gabbro or diabase rock bodies, referred to as epidiorite, contain a considerable amount of this uralitic alteration. Fibrous actinolite is one of the six recognised types of asbestos, the fibres being so small that they can enter the lungs and damage the alveoli. Actinolite asbestos was once mined along Jones Creek at Gundagai, Australia. Gemology Some forms of actinolite are used as gemstones. One is nephrite, one of the two types of jade (the other being jadeite, a variety of pyroxene). Another gem variety is the chatoyant form known as cat's-eye actinolite. This stone is translucent to opaque, and green to yellowish green color. This variety has had the misnomer jade cat's-eye. Transparent actinolite is rare and is faceted for gem collectors. Major sources for these forms of actinolite are Taiwan and Canada. Other sources are Madagascar, Tanzania, and the United States.

They were formed in Grangemouth by Robin Guthrie (guitars, drum machine) and Will Heggie (bass), adding Elizabeth Fraser (vocals) in 1981 and replacing Heggie with multi-instrumentalist Simon Raymonde in 1983. The group has earned critical praise for their distinctive ethereal sound and the soprano vocals of Fraser, whose lyrics often abandon recognisable language. They pioneered the 1980s alternative rock subgenre of dream pop. After signing with the British record label 4AD in 1982, the band released their debut album Garlands later that year, \\"mixing strong Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division influences\\" as the British press promoted it at the time. The addition of Raymonde in 1983 solidified their final lineup, which produced The Spangle Maker EP (containing their biggest hit in their native United Kingdom, \\"Pearly-Dewdrops' Drops\\", peaking at No. 29 on the UK Singles Chart) and their third studio album, Treasure in 1984. Raymonde temporarily left the band during the recording of their fourth album, Victorialand. In 1988, Cocteau Twins signed with Capitol Records in the United States, distributing their fifth album, Blue Bell Knoll, through a major label in the country. After the 1990 release of their most critically acclaimed album, Heaven or Las Vegas, the band left 4AD for Fontana Records, where they released their final two albums. After nearly 20 years together, the band disbanded in 1997 in part due to issues stemming from the disintegration of Fraser and Guthrie's romantic relationship. In 2005, the band announced that they would reunite to headline Coachella and embark on a world tour but the reunion was cancelled a month later after Fraser refused to perform on stage with Guthrie. History =Early years, 1979‚Äì1983= Guthrie and Heggie, both from Grangemouth, Scotland, formed the band in 1979. At a local disco called Nash in 1981, they met the 17-year-old Fraser, also from Grangemouth, who became the band's vocalist. The band's influences at the time included The Birthday Party (drummer Phill Calvert encouraged the group to sign to 4AD), Sex Pistols, Kate Bush, and Siouxsie and the Banshees,Liz Fraser interview. Melody Maker. 6 November 1993 (Fraser had Siouxsie tattoos on her arms for several years). The band was named after the Johnny and the Self-Abusers' (who later renamed themselves Simple Minds) song \\"The Cocteau Twins\\" (later rewritten as \\"No Cure\\"). Their debut recording, Garlands (released by 4AD in 1982), was an instant success, peaking at number 2 in the indie albums chart in the UK. NMEs Don Watson compared the style of the band to gothic rock bands like Gene Loves Jezebel and Xmal Deutschland, while Spin magazine's Sue Cummings compared it retrospectively to Siouxsie and the Banshees and Bauhaus.Sue Cummings: \\"The Pink Opaque\\", Cocteau Twins review, p. 28, SPIN magazine, March 1986 In 1983, the band released a second EP, Peppermint Pig. Cocteau Twins' sound on their first three recordings relied on the combination of Heggie's rhythmic basslines, Guthrie's minimalist guitar melodies, and Fraser's voice. The band's next full-length LP record, Head over Heels, relied solely on the latter two, following Heggie's amicable departure after the tour that followed the release of Peppermint Pig (he would later join Lowlife). This led to the characteristic Cocteau Twins sound: Fraser's voice, by turns ethereal and operatic, combined with increasingly effects-heavy guitar playing by Guthrie (who has often said that he is far more interested in the way the guitar is recorded than in the actual notes being played, though he later admitted that his reliance on effects and layering was initially due to his own technical limitations).Paynes, Steph: \\"Robin Guthrie\\", Guitar Player, 25(2):25‚Äì26, 1991. In 1983 the band participated in 4AD's This Mortal Coil project, which spawned a cover version of Tim Buckley's \\"Song to the Siren\\" performed by Guthrie and Fraser). Despite appearing under the This Mortal Coil name, the cover has subsequently become one of the best-known Cocteau Twins tracks: in 2012, Dawn French selected \\"Song to the Siren\\" on Desert Island Discs as, in her words, \\"The song that made me fall in love again\\". During the TMC sessions, Guthrie and Fraser became acquainted with another project contributor, multi- instrumentalist Simon Raymonde (formerly a member of Drowning Craze), who joined Cocteau Twins later that year. =Rise to fame, 1984‚Äì1989= With Raymonde, the band released a series of critically acclaimed albums and EPs that explored their new style. These included The Spangle Maker (1984), Treasure (1984), Aikea-Guinea (1985), Tiny Dynamine (1985), Echoes in a Shallow Bay (1985), and Love's Easy Tears (1986). Raymonde, who was called in to work on the second album by This Mortal Coil, did not participate in the recording of the fourth Cocteau Twins LP, Victorialand (1986), a predominantly acoustic record which featured only Guthrie and Fraser. Raymonde returned to the group for The Moon and the Melodies (1986), a collaboration with ambient composer Harold Budd, which was not released under the Cocteau Twins name. In 1985 4AD signed an agreement with Relativity Records for distribution of Cocteau Twins releases in the US and other territories. To commemorate the event, the compilation The Pink Opaque (1985) was released as a way of introducing the new, broader audience to the band's back catalogue. While remaining a 4AD band internationally, Cocteau Twins finally signed a major- label contract with Capitol Records in 1988 for distribution in the United States, and released their fifth album, Blue Bell Knoll, in September of that year. \\"Carolyn's Fingers\\" became the band's biggest hit in the U.S., peaking at No. 2 on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart. =Mainstream success, 1990‚Äì1994= The group released Heaven or Las Vegas in late 1990. The most commercially successful of their many recordings, the album rose to the higher reaches of the UK Albums Chart immediately after its release. Despite the success of the record and the subsequent concert tours, not everything was well with the band. They parted ways with 4AD following Heaven or Las Vegas partly because of conflicts with the label's founder Ivo Watts-Russell, and were close to breaking up over internal problems due in large part to Guthrie's substance abuse. While on their international tour supporting Heaven or Las Vegas, the group signed a new recording contract with Mercury Records subsidiary Fontana for the UK and elsewhere, while retaining their US relationship with Capitol. In 1991, 4AD and Capitol released a box set that compiled the band's EPs from 1982 to 1990, and also included a bonus disc of rare and previously unreleased material. Fraser and Guthrie ended their 13-year relationship in 1993, and by this time had a young daughter, Lucy- Belle, born in 1989. The band's seventh LP, Four-Calendar Caf√©, their first since Fraser and Guthrie's separation, was released in late 1993. The band explained that Four-Calendar Caf√© was a response to the turmoil that had engulfed them in the intervening years, with Guthrie entering rehab and quitting alcohol and drugs, and Fraser undergoing psychotherapy. =Later releases and break-up, 1995‚Äì1997= 1995 saw the release of two new EPs: Twinlights and Otherness. Some of the tracks on Twinlights and Otherness were versions of songs from the band's eighth album, Milk & Kisses (1996). The record saw the return of more heavily layered guitars, and Fraser began once again to obscure her lyrics, though not entirely. Two singles were taken from the album: \\"Tishbite\\" and \\"Violaine\\"; both exist in two CD versions, with different B-sides included on each. The band, augmented by an extra guitarist and a drummer, toured extensively to support the album, their last for Mercury/Fontana. A new song, \\"Touch Upon Touch\\", which debuted during the live shows and was recorded later in 1996 was also one of the two songs written and arranged by Fraser, Guthrie and Raymonde for Chinese pop singer Faye Wong for her Mandarin album Fuzao released in June 1996, the other being \\"Tranquil Eye\\" from Violaine released in October 1996. In 1997, while recording what was to have been their ninth LP, the trio disbanded over irreconcilable differences in part related to the breakup of Guthrie and Fraser. While a number of songs were partially recorded and possibly completed, the band has stated that they will likely never be finished or released in any form. =Post-breakup= In 1999 Bella Union, the record label founded by Guthrie and Raymonde, released a double-CD Cocteau Twins compilation entitled BBC Sessions. The collection is a complete record of the band's appearances on UK radio programs from 1982 to 1996, with rare and unreleased material included. In 2000, 4AD released Stars and Topsoil, a compilation of selected songs picked by the band members that had been released during their years with 4AD; all recordings had been digitally remastered by Guthrie. Finally, in 2003, 4AD followed Stars and Topsoil with the release of digitally remastered versions of the first six Cocteau Twins LPs. On 31 January 2005, Cocteau Twins announced that they would be reforming to perform at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on 30 April 2005, and later indicated that additional tour dates would be added. However on 16 March, the reunion was cancelled after Fraser announced that she would not take part. In a 2009 interview, Fraser said she could not go through the pain of sharing the stage with her former lover Guthrie, the issue behind the band's 1997 breakup. Raymonde revealed that the band had also booked a 55-date world tour, which would have paid him ¬£1.5 million. Later in 2005, 4AD released a worldwide limited edition of 10,000 compilation box set titled, Lullabies to Violaine, a 4-disc set that details every single and EP released from 1982 to 1996. This was shortly followed up by two 2-disc sets of the same names, known as Volume 1 and Volume 2. Since March 2007, the band has started podcasts of exclusive material. On 6 October 2008, Cocteau Twins were awarded the Q Awards Inspiration Award, which they accepted in a rare collective live appearance. In 2013, the first book about the band, Des Punks C√©lestes, was published in France. Solo work The former members of Cocteau Twins have remained active musically in the years since the band's demise. In addition to forming Bella Union, Guthrie and Raymonde have produced releases from new bands signed to that label. Raymonde released the solo album Blame Someone Else as the first release on Bella Union. He also co-produced the posthumous album by Billy Mackenzie from the Associates, then went on to produce several Domino Records artists like James Yorkston, Archie Bronson Outfit (whom he later managed) and Clearlake. More recently he has produced the UK band The Duke Spirit, London-based duo Helene, former Golden Virgins frontman Lucas Renney and has mixed the Mercury Prize nominated album The End of History by Fionn Regan. In his role running Bella Union, he has discovered such artists as Laura Veirs, Fleet Foxes, Midlake, Lift to Experience, The Low Anthem, I Break Horses, The Czars and John Grant. The label is renowned for its long- term relationships with its artists, such as Beach House who have released all four of their albums with Bella Union, as have Dirty Three, Midlake etc. Raymonde picked up the Independent Record Company of the Year award at the Music Week Awards (as voted by UK independent retailers) in 2010, 2012 and 2014. Guthrie has released five solo albums ‚Äì Imperial, Continental, Carousel, Emeralds and Fortune ‚Äì and five EPs. He toured extensively with his band Violet Indiana, which included ex-Cocteau's guitarist Mitsuo Tate in the line- up. He has also scored the music for three movies‚ÄîGregg Araki's Mysterious Skin (in collaboration with Harold Budd), Dany Saadia's 3:19 Nada Es Casualidad (a Mexican/Spanish production), and again with Gregg Araki and Harold Budd on the score and the soundtrack of White Bird in a Blizzard. He has also reunited with Budd to collaborate on two companion CDs, Before the Day Breaks and After the Night Falls, and the later Bordeaux and Winter Garden, the latter a collaboration also with Italian electronica artist Eraldo Bernocchi. In 2006, Guthrie produced three songs on Mahogany's \\"Connectivity,\\" on which Lucy Belle Guthrie made her singing debut. He most recently produced and played guitar on Apollo Heights debut album, White Music for Black People. Fraser provided guest vocals on The Future Sound of London's single \\"Lifeforms\\" (1993), vocals for three songs on Massive Attack's Mezzanine in 1998 (as well as touring with them several times), and for other musical projects and groups. Notably, she wrote the lyrics and sang the vocals for \\"Teardrop\\" by Massive Attack which was released as a single in 1998 and reached number 10 in the UK singles chart It has been speculated that she has been working on a solo album, though details of this are as yet unavailable. Fraser provided the vocals for \\"Lament for Gandalf\\" in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. In 2000 she sang with Peter Gabriel on Ovo (The Millennium Show). In 2005, she worked with Breton musician Yann Tiersen on two songs for his album Les retrouvailles.

This mineral was called andalousite by Delam√©tehrie, who thought it came from Andalusia. It soon became clear that it was a locality error, and that the specimens studied were actually from El Cardoso de la Sierra, in the province of Guadalajara, not Andalusia. Andalusite is trimorphic with kyanite and sillimanite, being the lower pressure mid temperature polymorph. At higher temperatures and pressures, andalusite may convert to sillimanite. Thus, as with its other polymorphs, andalusite is an aluminosilicate index mineral, providing clues to depth and pressures involved in producing the host rock. Varieties The variety chiastolite commonly contains dark inclusions of carbon or clay which form a cruciform pattern when shown in cross-section. This stone was known at least from the sixteenth century, being taken to many European countries, as a souvenir, by pilgrims returning from Santiago de Compostela. A clear variety found in Brazil and Sri-Lanka can be cut into a gemstone. Faceted andalusite stones give a play of red, green, and yellow colors that resembles a muted form of iridescence, although the colors are actually the result of unusually strong pleochroism.  Occurrence  Andalusite is a common metamorphic mineral which forms under low pressure and low to high temperatures. The minerals kyanite and sillimanite are polymorphs of andalusite, each occurring under different temperature-pressure regimes and are therefore rarely found together in the same rock. Because of this the three minerals are a useful tool to help identify the pressure-temperature paths of the host rock in which they are found. It is particularly associated with mica schist.  Uses  Andalusite is used as a refractory in furnaces, kilns and other industrial processes. South Africa possesses by far the largest portion of the world's known andalusite deposits.

Broad distinctions are useful to avoid ambiguity, and disambiguation will be of varying importance depending on the nuance of the equivalent word in other languages. A first distinction is necessary between maritime shipping routes and waterways used by inland water craft. Maritime shipping routes cross oceans and seas, and some lakes, where navigability is assumed, and no engineering is required, except to provide the draft for deep- sea shipping to approach seaports (channels), or to provide a short cut across an isthmus; this is the function of ship canals. Dredged channels in the sea are not usually described as waterways. There is an exception to this initial distinction, essentially for legal purposes, see under international waters. Where seaports are located inland, they are approached through a waterway that could be termed \\"inland\\" but in practice is generally referred to as a \\"maritime waterway\\" (examples Seine Maritime, Loire Maritime, Seeschiffahrtsstra√üe Elbe). The term \\"inland waterway\\" refers to navigable rivers and canals designed to be used by inland waterway craft only, implicitly of much smaller dimensions than seagoing ships. In order for a waterway to be navigable, it must meet several criteria: * it must be deep enough to accommodate vessels loading to the design draft; * it must be wide enough to allow passage of the vessels with the design width or beam; * it must be free of obstacles to navigation such as waterfalls and rapids, or offer a way around them (such as canal locks or boat lifts); * its current must be mild enough to allow vessels to make headway upstream without undue difficulty; * the wave height (on lakes) must not exceed the value for which the class of vessel is designed. Vessels using waterways vary from small animal-drawn barges to immense ocean tankers and ocean liners, such as cruise ships. Example of classification of inland waterways The European Conference of Ministers of Transport established in 1953 a classification of waterways that was later expanded to take into account the development of push-towing. Europe is a continent with a great variety of waterway characteristics, which makes this classification valuable to appreciate the different classes of waterway. There is also a remarkable variety of waterway characteristics in many countries of Asia, but there has not been any equivalent international drive for uniformity. This classification is provided by the UN Economic Commission for Europe, Inland Transport Committee, Working Party on Inland Water Transport. A low resolution version of that map is shown here.

They emerged from the early 1980s Los Angeles heavy metal scene. The band's popularity peaked that decade, yet they continue to record and tour, making them one of the most enduring of the West Coast heavy metal bands. W.A.S.P. gained notoriety for their shock rock-themed image, lyrics and live performances. They have sold over 12 million albums. W.A.S.P. was a prominent target in the mid-1980s of the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), an organization that pushed for warning labels on recorded music. The band immortalized its fight with the PMRC on the song \\"Harder, Faster\\" from their 1987 live album, Live...In the Raw. Their most well-known songs include \\"Animal (Fuck Like a Beast)\\", \\"I Wanna Be Somebody\\", \\"L.O.V.E. Machine\\", \\"Wild Child\\", \\"Blind in Texas\\", \\"Forever Free\\", \\"Mean Man\\", \\"Chainsaw Charlie (Murders in the New Morgue)\\" and \\"The Idol\\", as well as their cover versions of Ray Charles' \\"I Don't Need No Doctor\\" and The Who's \\"The Real Me\\". The band's most recent album, Golgotha, was released in 2015, and they have reportedly been working on new material. Band name There has been much speculation over the origin of the band's name, and whether it actually stands for anything, since it is written as an acronym. One possible interpretation is \\"White Anglo-Saxon Protestants\\", being the original meaning of the acronym. The song \\"Show No Mercy\\", the B-side of the band's first single \\"Animal\\", contains the repeated lyric, \\"White Anglo- Saxon / A violent reaction\\". The original U.S. release of the band's debut album W.A.S.P. had the words \\"We Are Sexual Perverts\\" inscribed on both sides around the label in the center, while \\"Winged Assassins\\" is inscribed on the spine of the first vinyl pressing. When asked about the band's name Lawless has avoided giving a straight answer: in one interview he answered, \\"We Ain't Sure, Pal.\\" In a February 2010 interview, Lawless stated the main reason for the name was the periods. He claimed no band had ever used them before (although R.E.M. formed two years earlier) and, in essence, the periods created a \\"question mark of uncertainty\\" to make W.A.S.P. stand out more. He then went on to say, \\"Look where we are: it did!\\" History =Early years and rise to fame (1982‚Äì1985)= Circus Circus 1979-1980: Joey Palemo, Blackie Lawless, Jimi Image, Randy Piper W.A.S.P. began following the demise of Circus Circus, an L.A. band featuring Blackie Lawless and Randy Piper. The original lineup of W.A.S.P. was formed in Los Angeles, California in 1982 by Lawless, Piper, Rik Fox, and Tony Richards. The band became notorious for its raunchy and, at times, shocking live shows. Lawless was known to tie semi-naked models to a torture rack, and to also hurl raw meat into the audience. The band's debut single, entitled \\"Animal (Fuck Like A Beast)\\", and its cover were equally controversial. The first lineup didn't last for long, as Rik Fox was let go and went on to join the band Steeler with vocalist Ron Keel and guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen. He was replaced by Don Costa, the bassist in Richards' former band, Dante Fox (which later evolved into Great White). Shortly afterward, Don Costa also left the band and his position on the bass was filled by Brayden Parker . At the same time, guitarist Chris Holmes joined the band. W.A.S.P. signed to Capitol Records for their debut album, W.A.S.P., released on August 17, 1984. The debut was at one time planned for release with the title Winged Assassins. The band's first single \\"Animal (Fuck Like A Beast)\\" was omitted from the album in the United States to prevent it from being banned from major chain stores. Shortly afterwards, the band made an appearance in the 1984 film The Dungeonmaster. \\"L.O.V.E. Machine\\" and \\"I Wanna Be Somebody\\" helped the album sell, and set the band up for \\"Blind In Texas\\", a song written in St. Paul, Minnesota, by Lawless. The song was released on their next album The Last Command in September 1985. The Last Command is still W.A.S.P.'s highest charting album, peaking at No. 47 on the Billboard album chart. \\"Blind In Texas\\" is perhaps their best known song, more than 20 years later. The Last Command was also the first album with new drummer Steve Riley. The former Keel drummer replaced Tony Richards at the beginning of the 1984-1985 tour. After The Last Command tour, guitarist Randy Piper departed the band. Former King Kobra bassist Johnny Rod joined W.A.S.P. as Lawless went back to playing rhythm guitar. =Mainstream success (1986‚Äì1989)= With the lineup changes made, they recorded their third album, titled Inside the Electric Circus. It was released in October 1986. The album was a big hit with W.A.S.P. fans. Critics, on the other hand, dismissed it as \\"7th-grader rock\\". Songs like \\"Shoot From The Hip\\" and the minor hit single \\"95-N.A.S.T.Y.\\" helped the band live up to the reputation of one of the possible meanings of their band name, \\"We Are Sexual Perverts\\". However, Blackie Lawless himself, known to be a harsh critic of his own work, cited in the album's re-release liner notes that Inside the Electric Circus was \\"[a] tired record by a tired band.\\" Ultimately it was an unfavorable critical review of the single \\"95-N.A.S.T.Y.\\" that convinced Lawless to take some time off and reconsider the band's creative direction. W.A.S.P. became a very prominent target of the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), an organization led by Tipper Gore and dedicated to opposing music with lyrics deemed violent or overtly sexual in content. This lowered the band's reputation to such a degree that concert halls were getting bomb threats, band members were receiving death threats by the hundreds, and singer Blackie Lawless was shot at twice (though not hit). The controversy generated valuable publicity for the band. In 1987 W.A.S.P. had their song \\"Scream Until You Like It\\" included on the soundtrack of the movie Ghoulies 2. The same year, a few dates during the Inside the Electric Circus tour were recorded and on November 27, 1987, the Long Beach arena concert was released as the Live...In the Raw album. Unfortunately, by this time, Steve Riley had left W.A.S.P. to join L.A. Guns, replaced by local drummer Chad Nelson. 18-year-old Glenn Soderling, who had recorded an album in 1983 with the band Pandemonium then joined the band, but did not play any shows due to Chris Holmes¬¥ illness. Soderling left during rehearsals and was replaced by Kelly Martella for their Donington appearance and a Top of the Pops performance of \\"Scream Until You Like It\\" on BBC. Kelly Martella went on to join the band Silent Rage (Simmons Records) in 1988. Soderling later surfaced under the name Tripp Holland in the band Engines of Aggression with former Tomorrow's Child members Rik Schaffer and Craig Dollinger, and is currently making music for TV shows as staff writer with Supersonic Noise. W.A.S.P.'s fourth studio album, The Headless Children, was released on April 15, 1989 and was their first album without any overtly sexually explicit songs included. It was also their first album to sell rather poorly, however it reached the band's highest chart position with No. 48 on the Billboard 200 before falling off the charts in 13 weeks. However, it would be W.A.S.P.'s most critically acclaimed work up to that point and, according to a recent Lawless interview, it is now actually the highest selling W.A.S.P. album to date. The drumming duties for the album were handled by former Quiet Riot drummer Frankie Banali. It featured two of the band's most highly acclaimed songs, the power ballad \\"Forever Free\\" and a cover of The Who's \\"The Real Me\\". =Post-Chris Holmes period (1989‚Äì1995)= Blackie Lawless and W.A.S.P. performing in Stavanger, Norway Chris Holmes left the band in August 1989, stating that he wanted to \\"have fun, you know.\\" Lawless responded with a caustic remark about the fact that \\"some guys want to stay at home and wear aprons,\\" hinting at the nature of Chris Holmes' relationship with his new wife Lita Ford. The band effectively disbanded a few months later with Blackie Lawless embarking on a short lived solo career. Lawless was originally slated to play the T-1000 terminator in the movie Terminator 2: Judgment Day, but was later replaced by Robert Patrick after Arnold Schwarzenegger deemed Lawless \\"too tall\\" (1.93m). Blackie commenced work on his solo project, but under pressure from both promoters and fans, he released it as a W.A.S.P. album. Ironically, many critics feel that the resulting concept album, The Crimson Idol, has been the best W.A.S.P. output so far. The follow-up to The Crimson Idol was Still Not Black Enough (1995), a collection of dark, introspective tunes that extended the Crimson Idol mythology. This time, rather than \\"hiding behind\\" alter ego Jonathan Steele, Lawless spoke directly to the audience about his own feelings (as stated in the liner notes). While the album lacked the cohesiveness of its predecessor, the lyrics still explored similar topics to Crimson Idol: being an outcast and misfit, the pressures of fame and society, and the search for love. Still Not Black Enough also included cover songs as \\"bonus tracks\\". The initial European edition included a different track listing from the American version and a subsequent American re-issue featured yet a different track listing. No version to date includes all the various tracks on one disc. =Reunion with Chris Holmes (1996‚Äì2001)= Chris Holmes returned to W.A.S.P. in 1996 and together they released Kill.Fuck.Die (1997) and Helldorado (1999). They also recorded two live albums from these tours, Double Live Assassins and The Sting respectively. The Sting CD and DVD were taken directly from an experimental webcast that Lawless claims to have had no control over. This release angered him as he was unhappy with the sound and picture quality. The band continued with the album Unholy Terror in 2001. Chris Holmes left the band once again in 2001, stating that he wanted to \\"play the blues\\". He hooked up with fellow ex-W.A.S.P. member Randy Piper's band Animal, but soon dropped out of that project also. Holmes, for his part, has claimed he never played on Unholy Terror. =Dying for the World and the Neon God albums (2002‚Äì2005)= Dying for the World, released in 2002, was written and recorded in less than a year which is very fast by Lawless' perfectionist standards. Its liner notes feature one of Lawless' strongest statements about political correctness, inspired by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In April 2004, W.A.S.P. released the first part of The Neon God, subtitled The Rise, a conceptual album about an abused and orphaned boy who finds that he has the ability to read and manipulate people. The second part, The Demise, was released in September 2004. In 2005, W.A.S.P. headlined American Metal Blast. A video shoot for the track \\"Never Say Die\\" was planned with Ward Boult, a fetish photographer, directing. To this day, there has been no news as to whether the shoot resulted in anything concrete. It would have been the first W.A.S.P. promo video in ten years, the last being 1995's \\"Black Forever\\". =Dominator and Babylon (2006‚Äì2014)= Early 2006 saw the seemingly stable lineup fall apart. Long-time session and tour drummer Stet Howland left first (on amicable terms), promising more specific information about the reasons for the split to be posted on his website. Larry Howe of Vicious Rumors was considered as a replacement. In May, the departure of guitarist Darrell Roberts, who went on to join the band Five Finger Death Punch, was announced and new guitar player Mark Zavon was brought in several days before the first tour date. The same press release confirmed Mike Dupke, and not Howe, would be the new drummer. Furthermore, two days later, Zavon was out of the picture as well, seeing Doug Blair step in on guitar. A new album, Dominator was planned for release in October 2006, according to a statement made by Blackie Lawless at a tour stop in Kavarna. He then went on to play a new song from the album, entitled Mercy. A few weeks later, the release of the album was postponed until April 2007, with the band recording two news songs and dropping two cover songs, to be used instead as bonus tracks. In October 2007, W.A.S.P. embarked on The Crimson Idol Tour, to celebrate that album's 15th anniversary. It was the first time that the album, often regarded to be among the band's finest work, was performed in full from start to finish. The tour kicked off in Greece, in Thessaloniki at the Principal Club Theater on October 26, 2007. The release of the Dominator album was finalized for April 16 in the UK, April 20 in Scandinavia with the rest of mainland Europe following on April 27. The release dates for South America and Russia followed in early May. Dominator reached No. 72 on the charts in Germany. W.A.S.P. canceled their North American tour due to their record label's loss of a distributor. They were going to finish up their shows in Europe and then reschedule their shows in the United States. They were unable to finish the shows in Europe because of a \\"family illness that needed immediate attention\\" which forced the band to return to Los Angeles right away. They were originally going to perform at Rocklahoma. As the tour was canceled, W.A.S.P. was not able to perform at Rocklahoma and was replaced by Queensr√øche. W.A.S.P. announced a European tour which included dates in Scotland, England and other places throughout Europe in late October 2007. W.A.S.P. released their fourteenth studio album, entitled Babylon in late 2009, via Demolition Records. Blackie Lawless has in recent interviews claimed that he is never going to play the song \\"Animal (Fuck Like A Beast)\\" live again, due to his religious beliefs. These beliefs are what have allegedly been behind Blackie Lawless' self-censorship of his own lyrics during the 'Babylon World Tour,' most notably during the performance of 'Chainsaw Charlie (Murders In The New Morgue).' On The Beast of Babylon Tour, Blackie canceled two shows within a week of each other. The first cancellation came about at the Gramercy Theater in New York City after the band discovered that the venue had been selling V.I.P. meet and greet tickets for twice the amount of the general admission price. The band made a statement claiming, \\"We have never charged a fan for an autograph and will never charge any fans for an autograph.\\" The second cancellation occurred when the Crocodile Rock venue in Allentown, Pennsylvania wanted 50% of all of the band's profit, according to Lawless. On September 21, 2012, the band celebrated the 30th anniversary of their first ever live show by kicking off a world tour at The Forum in London. The set for the tour was split into three sections: songs from the first four albums, a cut-down rendition of the Crimson Idol performance and a final segment for newer material. =Golgotha, 25th anniversary of The Crimson Idol and next album (2015‚Äìpresent)= W.A.S.P.'s fifteenth studio album, Golgotha, was released on October 2, 2015. The album took four years to materialize. W.A.S.P. toured in 2017 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the release of The Crimson Idol. To coincide with this anniversary, the band released Reidolized (The Soundtrack to the Crimson Idol) on February 2, 2018, which came with the original The Crimson Idol movie on DVD and Blu-ray, and includes six tracks that were originally intended to be part of the original version of the album. In December 2017, it was reported that W.A.S.P. had been working on new material for their sixteenth studio album. Former W.A.S.P. drummer Frankie Banali died of pancreatic cancer on August 20, 2020, making him the second deceased member of the The Crimson Idol-era lineup, following Bob Kulick who had died three months earlier.

(band)"},{"id":"174855","text":"In computer chess programs, the null-move heuristic is a heuristic technique used to enhance the speed of the alpha-beta pruning algorithm.  Rationale  Alpha-beta pruning speeds the minimax algorithm by identifying cutoffs, points in the game tree where the current position is so good for the side to move that best play by the other side would have avoided it. Since such positions could not have resulted from best play, they and all branches of the game tree stemming from them can be ignored. The faster the program produces cutoffs, the faster the search runs. The null-move heuristic is designed to guess cutoffs with less effort than would otherwise be required, whilst retaining a reasonable level of accuracy. The null-move heuristic is based on the fact that most reasonable chess moves improve the position for the side that played them. So, if the player whose turn it is to move can forfeit the right to move (or make a null move - an illegal action in chess) and still have a position strong enough to produce a cutoff, then the current position would almost certainly produce a cutoff if the current player actually moved.  Implementation  In employing the null-move heuristic, the computer program first forfeits the turn of the side whose turn it is to move, and then performs an alpha-beta search on the resulting position to a shallower depth than it would have searched the current position had it not used the null move heuristic. If this shallow search produces a cutoff, it assumes the full-depth search in the absence of a forfeited turn would also have produced a cutoff. Because a shallow search is faster than deeper search, the cutoff is found faster, accelerating the computer chess program. If the shallow search fails to produce a cutoff, then the program must make the full-depth search. This approach makes two assumptions. First, it assumes that the disadvantage of forfeiting one's turn is greater than the disadvantage of performing a shallower search. Provided the shallower search is not too much shallower (in practical implementation, the null-move search is usually 2 or 3 plies shallower than the full search would have been), this is usually true. Second, it assumes that the null-move search will produce a cutoff frequently enough to justify the time spent performing null-move searches instead of full searches. In practice, this is also usually true.  Problems with the null- move heuristic  There are a class of chess positions where employing the null-move heuristic can result in severe tactical blunders. In these zugzwang (German for \\"forced to move\\") positions, the player whose turn it is to move has only bad moves as their legal choices, and so would actually be better off if allowed to forfeit the right to move. In these positions, the null-move heuristic may produce a cutoff where a full search would not have found one, causing the program to assume the position is very good for a side when it may in fact be very bad for them. To avoid using the null-move heuristic in zugzwang positions, most chess-playing programs that use the null-move heuristic put restrictions on its use. Such restrictions often include not using the null-move heuristic if *the side to move is in check *the side to move has only its king and pawns remaining *the side to move has a small number of pieces remaining *the previous move in the search was also a null move.  Verified null-move pruning  Another heuristic for dealing with the zugzwang problem is Omid David and Nathan Netanyahu's verified null-move pruning. In verified null-move pruning, whenever the shallow null-move search indicates a fail-high, instead of cutting off the search from the current node, the search is continued with reduced depth.

The 1964 Olympic champion and multiple world record holder, he is regarded as one of the greatest athletes ever to compete in the high jump. His international career was ended by a motorcycle accident in 1965. Early life and education Brumel was born in a far eastern Siberian village to a family of geologists exploring the region. They later moved to Lugansk and taught at a local university. Athletic career Brumel took up the high jump at age 12 in Lugansk, coached by P. S. Shtein. Aged 16 he cleared using the then dominant straight-leg straddle technique. He improved his skills under the coaching of V. M. Dyachkov in Moscow. In 1960 he broke the USSR record, , and was selected to the Olympic team. At the 1960 Summer Olympics, he cleared the same height as the winner Robert Shavlakadze, but made more attempts and thus was awarded a silver medal. In 1961‚Äì1963 he broke the world record in the high jump six times, improving it from to . He also won the high jump at the 1961 and 1963 Universiade, 1962 European Championships, the 1964 Summer Olympics and the USSR Championships of 1961‚Äì1963. After going undefeated during the 1965 season, Brumel suffered a multiple fracture in his right foot in a motorcycle accident, and faced an amputation. He was operated on successfully by professor Gavriil Ilizarov with a new leg-lengthening procedure using his external fixator. Yet even after 29 surgeries he could not fully recover. He retired in 1970 after jumping at local competitions. Retirement from athletics In retirement Brumel turned to acting and writing. He starred in the film Sport, Sport, Sport (1970) and wrote the script for Pravo na pryzhok (The right on a jump, 1973). He also wrote numerous novels and plays, including the novel Don't Change Yourself (1979), which was translated into seven languages, and the libretto to Rauf Hajiyev's operetta Golden Caravel (–ó–æ–ª–æ—Ç–∞—è –∫–∞—Ä–∞–≤–µ–ª–ª–∞).

Since 1992, the band has consisted of Joe Elliott (lead vocals), Rick Savage (bass, backing vocals), Rick Allen (drums, backing vocals), Phil Collen (guitars, backing vocals), and Vivian Campbell (guitars, backing vocals), which has been the band's longest running line-up. They established themselves as part of the new wave of British heavy metal movement. The band's greatest commercial success came between the early 1980s and the early 1990s. Their 1981 album, High 'n' Dry, was produced by Mutt Lange, who helped them begin to define their style, and the album's main track \\"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\\" became one of the first rock videos played on MTV in 1982. The band's next studio album, Pyromania, was released in January 1983, with \\"Photograph\\" and \\"Rock of Ages\\" as the lead singles. In the US, Pyromania was certified Diamond, making Def Leppard among the most commercially popular bands at the time. Def Leppard's fourth album Hysteria, released in 1987, topped the UK and US album charts. As of 2009, it had reached beyond the success of Pyromania, having been certified 12√ó platinum for sales of over 12 million copies in the US, and has sold over 25 million worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. The album spawned seven hit singles, including the US Billboard Hot 100 number one \\"Love Bites\\", alongside \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\", \\"Hysteria\\", \\"Armageddon It\\", \\"Animal\\", \\"Rocket\\", and \\"Women\\". Their next studio album, Adrenalize (the first following the death of guitarist Steve Clark), reached number one in UK and US charts in 1992, and contained several hits, including \\"Let's Get Rocked\\" and \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\\". Their 1993 album, Retro Active, contained the acoustic hit song \\"Two Steps Behind\\". Their greatest-hits album Vault, released in 1995, featured the UK hit \\"When Love & Hate Collide\\".

History  = Early years (1977‚Äì1979) = Lead singer Joe Elliott Rick Savage, Tony Kenning, and Pete Willis, all students at Tapton School in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, formed a band called Atomic Mass in 1977. The band originally consisted of Willis on guitar, Savage on bass guitar after briefly playing guitar, and Kenning on drums. Only 18 at the time, Joe Elliott tried out for the band as a guitarist following a chance meeting with Willis after missing a bus in November 1977. During his audition it was decided that he was better suited to be the lead singer. The band's initial rehearsals took place at Portland Works, and their first gig was in the dining hall in A Block in Westfield School in Mosborough, Sheffield.Pete Frame (1999).

According to Elliott, he successfully auditioned for the band by playing Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Free Bird\\" in its entirety.Prato, Greg. Steve Clark Biography Allmusic. Retrieved 17 November 2011 In November, just prior to recording sessions for a three-song release known as The Def Leppard E.P., Kenning abruptly left the band; he later formed the band Cairo. He was replaced for those sessions by Frank Noon. By the end of the month, Rick Allen, then only 15 years old, had joined the band as its full-time drummer. Sales of the EP soared after the track \\"Getcha Rocks Off\\" was given extensive airtime by renowned BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, considered at the time to be a champion of punk rock and new wave music. Throughout 1979, the band developed a loyal following among British hard rock and heavy metal fans and were considered among the leaders of the new wave of British heavy metal movement.Macmillan, Malc (2012). The N.W.O.B.H.M. Encyclopedia. p. 148. Iron Pages Books (3 ed.). Berlin, Germany: I.P. Verlag Jeske/Mader GbR. Their growing popularity led to a record deal with the major label Phonogram/Vertigo (Mercury Records in the US). Def Leppard's original management, MSB, a local duo consisting of Pete Martin and Frank Stuart-Brown, were fired after Martin and Joe Elliott got into a fistfight over an incident on the road. The band approached Peter Mensch of Leber-Krebs management, who had booked them on a tour of the UK supporting AC/DC. Mensch, who admitted that he had had his eye on the band, became their manager. = Rise to fame (1980‚Äì1983) = The band's logo (pictured in 2018) first appeared in their 1980 album On Through the Night. Def Leppard's debut album, On Through the Night, was released on 14 March 1980. Although the album hit the Top 15 in the UK, many early fans were turned off by the perception that the band was trying too hard to appeal to American audiences by recording songs such as \\"Hello America\\" and touring more in the US (supporting Pat Travers, AC/DC, and Ted Nugent); a performance at the Reading Festival in August was marred when audience members expressed their displeasure by pelting the band with beer cans and bottles filled with urine. This incident was partially blamed on a cover story in Sounds music newspaper by the journalist Geoff Barton titled, \\"Has the Leppard changed its spots?\\", accusing the band of selling out to the American market. In a documentary on the band recorded for BBC 2, Barton recalls feelings of guilt over the story and having a \\"stand-up row\\" with the band's manager, Mensch, backstage at the show.Peter Buckley (2003) The rough guide to rockColin Larkin (1995) The Guinness encyclopedia of popular music, Volumes 1‚Äì6. p. 1118.

Pete Willis was fired on 11 July 1982 due to excessive alcohol consumption on the job and was replaced by Phil Collen of Girl the next day. This personnel change took place during the recording of their third album, Pyromania, which was released on 20 January 1983 and also produced by Lange. The cover artwork depicted an animated picture of a huge flame emerging from the top floor of a skyscraper, with a bullseye aimed at the flame. The lead single, \\"Photograph\\", turned Def Leppard into a household name, supplanting Michael Jackson's \\"Beat It\\" as the most requested video on MTV and becoming a staple of rock radio (dominating the US Album Rock Charts for six weeks), and sparked a headline tour across the US.Bob Batchelor, Scott Stoddart The 1980s Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007 Fueled by \\"Photograph\\" and subsequent singles \\"Rock of Ages\\" and \\"Foolin'\\", Pyromania went on to sell six million copies in 1983 (more than 100,000 copies every week in that year) and was held from the top of the US charts only by Michael Jackson's Thriller.Mick Wall (2010).

Mutt Lange initially joined in on the songwriting sessions but then suddenly declined to return as producer due to exhaustion. Jim Steinman (of Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell fame) was brought in. However, Steinman worked only briefly with the band, and the recording work was not released. Bassist Rick Savage On 31 December 1984, drummer Rick Allen lost his left arm in a car crash on the A57 in the hills outside the band's home city of Sheffield. Allen was driving with his Dutch girlfriend, Miriam Barendsen, when his Corvette swerved off the road on a sharp bend and went through a drystone wall. Despite the severity of the accident, Allen was committed to continuing his role as Def Leppard's drummer and realised that he could use his legs to do some of the drumming work previously done with his arms. He then worked with Simmons to design a custom electronic drum kit.Legends of rock guitar: the essential reference of rock's greatest guitarists Hal Leonard Corporation, 1997 The other members of the band supported Allen's recovery and never sought a replacement. Allen was placed in a separate studio to practice his new drums. After a few months, Allen gathered the band together and performed the intro to the Led Zeppelin version of \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" to showcase his progress to the band. Joe Elliott reports this as being a \\"very emotional moment.\\" During this period, Mutt Lange returned as producer. Def Leppard brought in Jeff Rich in August 1986 to play alongside Allen during Def Leppard's warm-up mini tour of Ireland. When the band couldn't fit two drum kits on stage at a gig, he and the band realized Allen could drum alone. Allen's comeback was sealed at the 1986 Monsters of Rock festival in England, with an emotionally charged ovation after his introduction by Joe Elliott.[ Def Leppard Biography]. Billboard.

Initial US album sales were relatively slow (compared to Pyromania) until the release of the fourth single, \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\". The song hit No. 2, and Hysteria finally reached the top of the US Billboard 200 in July 1988. Often regarded as the band's signature song, \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" was ranked No. 2 on VH1's \\"100 Greatest Songs of the 80s\\" in 2006. The band's UK success saw them nominated for the 1988 Brit Award for Best British Group. In October 1988, the power ballad \\"Love Bites\\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. In January 1989, the band scored another US Top 5 hit with \\"Armageddon It\\", and by spring of 1989 the final single \\"Rocket\\" was in the Top 20. Wanting to give fans something new after the massive radio and video airplay for not only the seven singles but also the Album tracks that Radio DJs were playing off the album, the band performed \\"Tear It Down\\", a Hysteria B-side at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards. Hysteria is one of only a handful of albums that has charted seven singles or more on the US Hot 100: \\"Women\\" (#80), \\"Animal\\" (#19), \\"Hysteria\\" (#10), \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" (#2), \\"Love Bites\\" (#1), \\"Armageddon It\\" (#3), and \\"Rocket\\" (#12). It remained on the charts for three years and has sold over 25 million copies worldwide. Equally successful was the accompanying 16-month tour, in which the band performed in the round. This concept proved wildly popular with fans (as seen in the videos for \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" and \\"Armageddon It\\") and was used again for the Adrenalize tour.

Following Hysteria, the band quickly set out to work on their fifth album, hoping to avoid another lengthy gap. Steve Clark's alcoholism worsened to the point that he was constantly in and out of rehab. Recording sessions suffered from this distraction, and in mid-1990, Clark was granted a six-month leave of absence from the band. Clark died from a mix of prescription drugs and alcohol on 8January 1991, in his London home. The remaining band members decided to carry on and recorded the album as a four-piece, with Collen mimicking Clark's style on his intended guitar parts.

Ultimately, the band chose Vivian Campbell in 1992, formerly of Dio and Whitesnake. Another world tour followed but the band's fortunes began to be affected by the rise of alternative rock, including grunge. Amidst the increasing popularity of alternative rock, the band decided to balance their original image as rebellious rock stars with a slightly friendlier energy, combining heavy metal with melodies and hooks more reminiscent of pop music. On 6June 1993, Def Leppard performed the first ever rock concert at the Don Valley Stadium in their home city of Sheffield before an audience of over 50,000.Def Leppard: The Definitive Visual History. p. 109.

The band rehearsed and played the songs together in the studio instead of recording parts separately, resulting in a much more live- sounding album. The US audience reception for Slang and its subsequent tour was a major dropoff from a decade earlier, but Q Magazine nonetheless listed Slang as one of their Top Ten Albums of 1996. VH1 revived the band's fortunes in the US in 1998 by featuring them on one of the first episodes of Behind the Music. Reruns of the episode yielded some of the series' highest ratings and brought the band's music back into the public consciousness (following years of burial by the alternative rock climate). The episode was even parodied on Saturday Night Live. In an effort to capitalise on this new momentum, Def Leppard returned to its classic sound with the 1999 album Euphoria.

In addition to 34 of Def Leppard's greatest hits, the collection featured the band's new cover of the Depeche Mode hit \\"Personal Jesus\\" (which was originally released in July 2018 for Spotify Singles), the new Christmas track \\"We All Need Christmas\\", and the new remix of \\"Rock On\\". On the same day, a new limited edition, 10-disc vinyl box set featuring all of the 7\\" singles from the Hysteria album was released.\\"Def Leppard To Release New Greatest Hits 'The Story So Far' And 10-Disc Vinyl Box 'Hysteria: The Singles\\". UdiscoverMusic.com. Retrieved 13 December 2018 The band finished the year off with a sell out tour of the UK and Ireland titled Hysteria & More Tour. They embarked on a world tour in 2019 beginning with the Sweden Rock Festival on 6June. In March 2019, it was announced that the band would undertake a second Las Vegas residency titled Def Leppard Hits Vegas‚ÄîThe Sin City Residency. The box set The Early Years 79-81 was released in March 2020, featuring remastered versions of the band's first two albums plus a variety of live recordings, B-sides, and studio outtakes from the 1979 to 1981 period. On 4 December 2019, the band announced they would be touring with M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Poison, and Joan Jett on The Stadium Tour in summer 2020, which was later rescheduled to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Musical style and legacy  Joe Elliott is known for his distinctive raspy singing voice. Def Leppard's musical style has beend described as glam metal, hard rock, heavy metal, arena rock, and pop rock. Def Leppard's music is a mixture of hard rock, AOR, pop and heavy metal elements, with its multi-layered, harmonic vocals and its melodic guitar riffs. However, even though they were often considered one of the top bands of the new wave of British heavy metal movement of the late 1970s, in the mid-1980s the band were associated with the growing glam metal scene, mainly due to their mainstream success and glossy production. Pyromania has been cited as the catalyst for the 1980s pop-metal movement. Def Leppard, however, expressed their dislike of the \\"glam metal\\" label, as they thought it did not accurately describe their look or musical style. By the release of the Hysteria album, the band had developed a distinctive sound featuring electronic drums and effects-laden guitar sounds overlaid with a multi-layered wall of husky, harmonised vocals. Def Leppard were influenced by Ian Hunter and Mott The Hoople and cited as an influence by a wide range of musical artists, including heavy metal and thrash metal bands such as Slayer, Pantera, and Metallica as part of the new wave of British heavy metal movement as well as by popular contemporary artists Matt Nathanson and Taylor Swift.

The others are The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and Van Halen\\". Both Pyromania and Hysteria feature in Rolling Stone list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Def Leppard were among the most successful of the new wave of British heavy metal bands in the early 1980s. They combined the raw power of metal with a pop emphasis on melody, catchy hooks and vocal harmonies that, particularly later on, contrasted sharply with harsher contemporary metal and punk bands. Their early album On Through the Night (1980) appealed to metal fans and influenced the likes of Dimebag Darrell of Pantera and Jeff Hanneman of Slayer. Their hugely popular later albums, such as Hysteria (1987), were different due to their perfectionism in the studio, but appealed to a broad range of music fans. In 2006, the band received a Sheffield Legends plaque in their hometown of Sheffield, England. Despite their huge commercial success, Elliott has said in an interview that he feels the band does not receive its fair share of respect from the British music press and he claimed the band had been barred from the BBC's Later with Jools Holland series because they were \\"not cool enough\\". = Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction = On 9 October 2018, Def Leppard received an induction nomination from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In addition to the 1,000 members of the Hall of Fame voting committee, the general public also had an opportunity to participate in the \\"Fan Vote\\". On 13 December 2018, Def Leppard were named in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's Class of 2019. The band won the Klipsch Audio Fan Vote, beating 14 other nominees with 547,647 general public votes (119,803 and 28% more than second vote receiver Stevie Nicks). The current lineup of the band, along with past members Pete Willis and Steve Clark, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 29 March 2019 at a ceremony at Brooklyn's Barclays Center. Def Leppard were inducted by Queen guitarist Brian May, who said they were \\"a magnificent rock group, in the classic tradition of what a rock group really is\\" and \\"a bunch of magnificent human beings.\\"  Band members  ;Current members * Joe Elliott: lead vocals, occasional rhythm guitar, keyboards, piano (1977‚Äìpresent) * Rick Savage: bass guitar, keyboards, backing vocals (1977‚Äìpresent) * Rick Allen: drums, percussion, backing vocals (1978‚Äìpresent) * Phil Collen: guitars, backing vocals (1982‚Äìpresent) * Vivian Campbell: guitars, backing vocals (1992‚Äìpresent) ;Former members * Tony Kenning: drums (1977‚Äì1978) * Pete Willis: guitars, backing vocals (1977‚Äì1982) * Steve Clark: guitars, backing vocals (1978‚Äì1991; his death)  Side projects  Phil Collen played guitar, uncredited, on Sam Kinison's \\"Wild Thing\\" in 1988.

Collen also produced and played on the 1991 album On The Edge by Australian band BB Steal. Joe Elliott sang lead vocals on two tracks on Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood's 1992 solo album, Slide on This. His then-wife Karla appeared in the videos for \\"Always Wanted More\\" and \\"Somebody Else Might\\". Various members of Def Leppard have played on tribute records for Jeff Beck, AC/DC, and Alice Cooper. A fan of his local football club Sheffield United F.C., Elliott performed on two tracks to the soundtrack of the 1996 Sheffield-set motion picture, When Saturday Comes (featuring fellow Sheffield native Sean Bean as a star football player), the title track and an instrumental, \\"Jimmy's Theme\\". Elliott sang and co-wrote the opening track, \\"Don't Look Down\\" on Mick Ronson's farewell album Heaven and Hull. A promotional video was issued for the song as well. Cybernauts was a side project consisting of Elliott and Collen teamed with members of The Spiders From Mars (David Bowie's former band), minus the late Mick Ronson. The group played several shows, covering Bowie's Ziggy Stardust-era songs and released one internet-only album (since deleted). Vivian Campbell has played with two side bands in recent years, Clock and the Riverdogs, and recorded a solo album, Two Sides of If, released in 2005. Campbell toured with Thin Lizzy in early 2011 before joining Def Leppard on their latest tour. Collen sings lead vocals and plays guitar in a side band called Man Raze with Sex Pistols drummer Paul Cook and former Girl bandmate Simon Laffy. They released their debut album Surreal in 2008 and a second album, PunkFunkRootsRock, in 2008. Joe Elliott founded and fronts the band Down 'n' Outz with members of The Quireboys. The band plays covers of Mott the Hoople and related artists such as British Lions and Ian Hunter. They have released two studio albums of covers and one live album since their incarnation in 2009. Following the death of Ronnie James Dio, Vivian Campbell reunited with the rest of the original Dio lineup with vocalist Andrew Freeman to form Last in Line. The band pays tribute to Dio by playing songs from their original tenure in the band and released an album titled Heavy Crown in February 2016. Joe Elliott, along with various other musicians including Glenn Hughes, Duff McKagan, Sebastian Bach, Matt Sorum, Gilby Clarke and Steve Stevens formed a supergroup called Kings of Chaos, whose catalogue consists of songs by Deep Purple, Def Leppard, Guns N' Roses and others. In 2012, Kings of Chaos recorded their version of Deep Purple's classic, \\"Never Before\\" featuring Elliott singing lead vocals. Kings of Chaos played Stone Fest in Australia along with a few dates in South America in 2013. Phil Collen formed a blues project by the name of Delta Deep with vocalist Debbi Blackwell Cook which released an eponymous debut in 2015.

He won the 1986 Nobel Prize in Chemistry jointly with Yuan T. Lee and John C. Polanyi \\"for their contributions concerning the dynamics of chemical elementary processes.\\" Herschbach and Lee specifically worked with molecular beams, performing crossed molecular beam experiments that enabled a detailed molecular-level understanding of many elementary reaction processes. Herschbach is a member of the Board of Sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Early life and education Herschbach was born in San Jose, California on June 18, 1932. The eldest of six children, he grew up in a rural area. He graduated from Campbell High School, where he played football. Offered both athletic and academic scholarships to Stanford University, Herschbach chose the academic. His freshman advisor, Harold S. Johnston, hired him as a summer research assistant, and taught him chemical kinetics in his senior year. His master's research involved calculating Arrhenius A-factors for gas-phase reactions. Herschbach received a B.S. in mathematics in 1954 and an M.S. in chemistry in 1955 from Stanford University. Herschbach then attended Harvard University, where he earned an A.M. in physics in 1956 and a Ph.D. in chemical physics in 1958 under the direction of Edgar Bright Wilson. At Harvard, Herschbach examined tunnel splitting in molecules, using microwave spectroscopy. He was awarded a three-year Junior Fellowship in the Society of Fellows at Harvard, lasting from 1957 to 1959. Research In 1959, Herschbach joined the University of California at Berkeley, where he was appointed an Assistant Professor of Chemistry and became an Associate Professor in 1961. At Berkeley, he and graduate students George Kwei and James Norris constructed a cross-beam instrument large enough for reactive scattering experiments involve alkali and various molecular partners. His interest in studying elementary chemical processes in molecular-beam reactive collisions challenged an often-accepted belief that \\"collisions do not occur in crossed molecular beams\\". The results of his studies of K + CH3I were the first to provide a detailed view of an elementary collision, demonstrating a direct rebound process in which the KI product recoiled from an incoming K atom beam. Subsequent studies of K + Br2 resulted in the discovery that the hot-wire surface ionization detector they were using was potentially contaminated by previous use, and had to be pre-treated to obtain reliable results. Changes to the instrumentation yielded reliable results, including the observation that the K + Br2 reaction involved a stripping reaction, in which the KBr product scattered forward from the incident K atom beam. As the research continued, it became possible to correlate the electronic structure of reactants and products with the reaction dynamics. In 1963, Herschbach returned to Harvard University as a professor of chemistry. There he continued his work on molecular-beam reactive dynamics, working with graduate students Sanford Safron and Walter Miller on the reactions of alkali atoms with alkali halides. In 1967, Yuan T. Lee joined the lab as a postdoctoral student, and Herschbach, Lee, and graduate students Doug MacDonald and Pierre LeBreton began to construct a \\"supermachine\\" for studying collisions such as Cl + Br2 and hydrogen and halogen reactions. His most acclaimed work, for which he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1986 with Yuan T. Lee and John C. Polanyi, was his collaboration with Yuan T. Lee on crossed molecular beam experiments. Crossing collimated beams of gas-phase reactants allows partitioning of energy among translational, rotational, and vibrational modes of the product molecules‚Äîa vital aspect of understanding reaction dynamics. For their contributions to reaction dynamics, Herschbach and Lee are considered to have helped create a new field of research in chemistry. Herschbach is a pioneer in molecular stereodynamics, measuring and theoretically interpreting the role of angular momentum and its vector properties in chemical reaction dynamics. In the course of his life's work in research, Herschbach has published over 400 scientific papers. Herschbach has applied his broad expertise in both the theory and practice of chemistry and physics to diverse problems in chemical physics, including theoretical work on dimensional scaling. One of his studies demonstrated that methane is, in fact, spontaneously formed at high-pressure and high-temperature environments such as those deep in the Earth's mantle; this finding is an exciting indication of abiogenic hydrocarbon formation, meaning that the actual amount of hydrocarbons available on Earth might be much larger than conventionally assumed under the assumption that all hydrocarbons are fossil fuels. His recent work also includes a collaboration with Steven Brams studying approval voting. Science and education Herschbach with AIC Gold Medal, 2011 Hershbach's teaching ranges from graduate seminars on chemical kinetics to an introductory undergraduate course in general chemistry that he taught for many years at Harvard, and described as his \\"most challenging assignment.\\" Herschbach has been a strong proponent of science education and science among the general public, and frequently gives lectures to students of all ages, imbuing them with his infectious enthusiasm for science and his playful spirit of discovery. Herschbach has also lent his voice to the animated television show The Simpsons for the episode \\"Treehouse of Horror XIV\\" where he is seen presenting the Nobel Prize in Physics to Professor Frink. In October 2010, Herschbach participated in the USA Science and Engineering Festival's Lunch with a Laureate program where middle and high school students will get to engage in an informal conversation with a Nobel Prize-winning scientist over a brown-bag lunch. Herschbach is also a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival's Advisory Board. Furthermore, Herschbach has participated in the Distinguished Lecture Series of the Research Science Institute (RSI), a summer research program for high school students held at MIT. Although still an active research professor at Harvard, he joined the Texas A&M; University faculty September 1, 2005 as a Professor of Physics, teaching one semester per year in the chemical physics program. As of 2010, he holds the title of Professor Emeritus at Harvard, and remains well known for his involvement as a lecturer and mentor in the Harvard research community. He and his wife Georgene Herschbach also served for several years as the co-Masters of Currier House, where they were highly involved in undergraduate life in addition to their full-time duties. Public service He is a board member of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation and was the chairman of the board for Society for Science & the Public from 1992-2010. Herschbach is a member of the Board of Sponsors of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto. He is also an Eagle Scout and recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award (DESA). 2016 endorsement for President of USA Professor Herschbach publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton for President in 2016./photo/1 Family Dudley Robert Herschbach on science and peace, UNESCO 2011 Herschbach's wife, Georgene Herschbach, served as the Associate Dean of Harvard College for Undergraduate Academic Programs.

This behavior is mostly associated with insects, but other animals are known to do this as well, such as a number of species of fish, snakes and spiders. The mechanism is typically that of one structure with a well-defined lip, ridge, or nodules (the \\"scraper\\" or plectrum) being moved across a finely-ridged surface (the \\"file\\" or stridulitrum‚Äîsometimes called the pars stridens) or vice versa, and vibrating as it does so, like the dragging of a phonograph needle across a vinyl record. Sometimes it is the structure bearing the file which resonates to produce the sound, but in other cases it is the structure bearing the scraper, with both variants possible in related groups. Common onomatopoeic words for the sounds produced by stridulation include chirp and chirrup. Arthropod stridulation Stridulation in Subpsaltria yangi Insects and other arthropods stridulate by rubbing together two parts of the body.

It is also widespread among decapod crustaceans, e.g., rock lobsters. Most spiders are silent, but some tarantula species are known to stridulate. When disturbed, Theraphosa blondi, the Goliath tarantula, can produce a rather loud hissing noise by rubbing together the bristles on its legs. This is said to be audible to a distance of up to 15 feet (4.5 m).Goliath Tarantula, Theraphosa blondi at Extreme Science . Accessed 13 March 2007. One of the wolf spiders, Schizocosa stridulans, produces low-frequency sounds by flexing its abdomen (tremulation, rather than stridulation) or high- frequency stridulation by using the cymbia on the ends of its pedipalps. The anatomical parts used to produce sound are quite varied: the most common system is that seen in grasshoppers and many other insects, where a hind leg scraper is rubbed against the adjacent forewing (in beetles and true bugs the forewings are hardened); in crickets and katydids a file on one wing is rubbed by a scraper on the other wing; in longhorned beetles, the back edge of the pronotum scrapes against a file on the mesonotum; in various other beetles, the sound is produced by moving the head‚Äîup/down or side-to-side‚Äîwhile in others the abdominal tergites are rubbed against the elytra; in assassin bugs, the tip of the mouthparts scrapes along a ridged groove in the prosternum; in velvet ants the back edge of one abdominal tergite scrapes a file on the dorsal surface of the following tergite. Stridulation in several of these examples is for attracting a mate, or as a form of territorial behaviour, but can also be a warning signal (acoustic aposematism, as in velvet ants and tarantulas). This kind of communication was first described by Slovenian biologist Ivan Regen (1868‚Äì1947). Green Katydid Grasshopper call. Vertebrate stridulation Some species of venomous snakes stridulate as part of a threat display. They arrange their body into a series of parallel C-shaped (counterlooped) coils that they rub together to produce a sizzling sound, rather like water on a hot plate. The best-known examples are members of the genus Echis (saw-scaled vipers), although those of the genus Cerastes (North African desert vipers) and at least one bush viper species, Atheris desaixi, do this as well.Spawls S, Branch B. 1995.

A bird species, the club-winged manakin, has a dedicated stridulation apparatus, while a species of mammal, the lowland streaked tenrec, (Hemicentetes semispinosus) produces a high-pitched noise by rubbing together specialised quills on its back.

The UN Charter is the foundational legal document of the United Nations (UN) and is the cornerstone of the public international law governing the use of force between States. NATO members are also subject to the North Atlantic Treaty, but its use of force provision is superseded by the non-derogable prohibition of the use of force contained in the Charter, which allows only two exceptions: action taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII, and self-defence against an armed attack. Neither of these exceptions were fulfilled in this case. Critics of the bombing have argued that the campaign violated international humanitarian law. Supporters of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia argued that the bombing brought to an end the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo's Albanian population, and that it hastened (or caused) the downfall of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá's government, which they saw as having been responsible for the international isolation of Yugoslavia, war crimes, and human rights violations. Legal justifiability of launching the war The laws of public international law that determine whether launching a war is legally justified are called jus ad bellum. =NATO's argument for the bombing's legitimacy= NATO described the conditions in Kosovo as posing a risk to regional stability. As such, NATO and certain governments asserted they had a legitimate interest in developments in Kosovo, due to their impact on the stability of the whole region which, they claimed, is a legitimate concern of the Organisation. = The UN Charter = The UN Charter is legally binding on all United Nations member states, including all members of NATO, because they have each signed it. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the use of force by UN member states to resolve disputes, but with two specific exceptions to this general prohibition: :1. The first exception is set forth in Chapter VII--the UN Security Council has the power to authorize the use of force in order to fulfill its responsibility to maintain international peace and security. In particular, Article 42 states that should the Security Council consider that measures provided for in Article 41 would be inadequate or have proved to be inadequate, it may take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security. Such action may include demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces of Members of the United Nations. :2. Article 51 contains the second specific exception to the prohibition on the use of force--the right to self-defence. In particular, Article 51 states that nothing in the present charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. NATO did not have the backing of the United Nations Security Council to use force in Yugoslavia. Further, NATO did not claim that an armed attack occurred against another state. However, its advocates contend that NATO actions were consistent with the United Nations Charter because the UN Charter prohibits unprovoked attacks only by individual states. The principal legal issue remains, however, since NATO as such is not a member state of the UN, whether the member states of NATO, the United States and the European powers that sent armed forces to attack as part of the NATO bombing campaign, violated the UN Charter by attacking a fellow UN member state: (1) in the absence of UN Security Council authorization, and (2) in the absence of an attack or a threat of imminent attack on them. The United Nations considers NATO to be a \\"regional arrangement\\" under UN Article 52, which allows it to deal with matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security as are appropriate for regional action provided that such arrangements or agencies and their activities are consistent with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations. However, the UN policy on military intervention by regional arrangements in UN Article 53 states the Security Council can, where appropriate, \\"utilize such regional arrangements or agencies for enforcement action under its authority. However, no enforcement action shall be taken under regional arrangements or by regional agencies without the authorization of the Security Council.\\" = NATO's charter = NATO had justified the actions in Kosovo under Article 4 of its charter, the North Atlantic Treaty, which allows involved parties to consult together whenever political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened. Because the NATO actions in Kosovo were taken after consultation with all members, were approved by a NATO vote, and were undertaken by several NATO members, NATO contends that its actions were in accordance with its charter. Article 4, however, is silent as to the use of force and does not discuss under what circumstances force may be authorized.The North Atlantic Treaty, 4 April 1949 Article 5 of NATO's charter calls on NATO members to respond in mutual defense when any NATO member is attacked. It is unclear whether under the NATO charter force may be used in the absence of such an attack. Article 5 has been interpreted as restricting NATO's use of force to situations where a NATO member has been attacked. It has been argued, therefore, that NATO's actions were in violation of the charter of NATO. Critics of this theory argue, however, that the purpose of Article 5 is to require all NATO members to respond when any NATO member is attacked, not to restrict the circumstances under which NATO may choose to use force. =The Vienna Convention= Serbia was threatened by NATO with armed attack if Serbia refused to sign the Rambouillet Agreement, an agreement that Serbia in the end refused to sign. It has been argued that pursuant to Article 52 of the 1980 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, had Serbia signed the Rambouillet Agreement, the agreement would have been void due to the threat or use of force to compel Serbian acceptance. =International criticism NATO actions= Kofi Annan UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan supported intervention in principle, saying \\"there are times when the use of force may be legitimate in the pursuit of peace\\", but was critical of unilateral action by NATO. He argued \\"under the [UN] Charter the Security Council has primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security - and this is explicitly acknowledged in the North Atlantic Treaty. Therefore, the Council should be involved in any decision to resort to the use of force.\\" Russian attempt to end the bombing On the day the bombing started, Russia called for the UN Security Council to meet to consider \\"an extremely dangerous situation caused by the unilateral military action of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\\". However, a draft resolution, tabled jointly by Russia, Belarus and India, to demand \\"an immediate cessation of the use of force against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\\" was defeated. Among the 15 UN Security Council nations, there were three votes in favour (Russia, China and Namibia) and twelve against, with no abstentions. Argentina, Bahrain, Brazil, Gabon, Gambia, Malaysia, and Slovenia, along with the US, Britain, France, Canada, and Netherlands voted against it. Rejection of Russia's condemnation amounted to political, but not legal, support of NATO's intervention. After the war ended with the Kumanovo Treaty and the bombing stopped, some argued that the creation on 10 June 1999 of the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), by Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999), constituted a legal ratification post festum (after the event).Henkin, Louis. 1999. Kosovo and the Law of \\"Humanitarian Intervention\\". [ed.] The American Journal of International Law. The American Journal of International Law. 10 1, 1999, Vol. 93, 4, pp. 824-828 Humanitarian reasoning The bombing campaign is sometimes referred to as a \\"humanitarian war\\" or a case of \\"humanitarian intervention\\". Part of NATO's justification for the bombing was to end the humanitarian crisis involving the large outflow of Kosovar Albanian refugees caused by Yugoslav forces. In April 1999, the development of this humanitarian crisis as well as accusations of genocide were used by policy-makers in the United States and Europe to legally justify the campaign on the basis of \\"humanitarian law\\", allowing for intervention where large scale human rights violations are occurring. Human rights organizations and individuals were divided on the campaign, given that the invocation of human rights and humanitarian law was used to initiate war. Moreover, they expressed doubts about the campaign given that it worsened the violence against Kosovar Albanians. Critics of the campaign have employed the term \\"humanitarian bombing\\" in an ironic manner to demonstrate their derision. Legality of wartime conduct Aside from the above-discussed issue of the legal justifiability of launching the war against Serbia, the NATO bombing campaign has been criticized for exceeding the limits of lawful wartime conduct under international humanitarian law, such as the Geneva Conventions. =Former Canadian ambassador James Bissett= James Byron Bissett, former Canadian ambassador to Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania, said in 2004 that \\"Canada participated in a series of NATO-sanctioned war crimes against Yugoslavia\\". He added, \\"NATO and the United States claimed that more than 100,000 ethnic Albanians had been killed as the result of Serb genocide\\". \\"The forensic experts found fewer than 2,000 graves and many of the people in those graves were Serbs,\\" Bissett claimed. According to Bissett, \\"There were more civilians killed in Serbia by the NATO bombing campaign.\\" =Noam Chomsky= Noam Chomsky was also highly critical of the NATO campaign and its aerial bombing in particular, where public utilities were bombed in addition to military targets. Chomsky argued that the main objective of the NATO intervention was to integrate FR Yugoslavia into the Western neo-liberal social and economic system, since it was the only country in the region which still defied the Western hegemony prior to 1999. He described bombing of the Radio Television of Serbia as an act of terrorism.  See also  * Independent International Commission on Kosovo References =Sources=  Noam Chomsky, Davor D≈æalto (2018).

Degenerate art () was a term adopted in the 1920s by the Nazi Party in Germany to describe modern art. During the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler, German modernist art, including many works of internationally renowned artists, was removed from state-owned museums and banned in Nazi Germany on the grounds that such art was an \\"insult to German feeling\\", un-German, Jewish, or Communist in nature. Those identified as degenerate artists were subjected to sanctions that included being dismissed from teaching positions, being forbidden to exhibit or to sell their art, and in some cases being forbidden to produce art. Degenerate Art also was the title of an exhibition, held by the Nazis in Munich in 1937, consisting of 650 modernist artworks chaotically hung and accompanied by text labels deriding the art. Designed to inflame public opinion against modernism, the exhibition subsequently traveled to several other cities in Germany and Austria. While modern styles of art were prohibited, the Nazis promoted paintings and sculptures that were traditional in manner and that exalted the \\"blood and soil\\" values of racial purity, militarism, and obedience. Similar restrictions were placed upon music, which was expected to be tonal and free of any jazz influences; disapproved music was termed degenerate music. Films and plays were also censored. Reaction against modernism The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari The early 20th century was a period of wrenching changes in the arts. In the visual arts, such innovations as Fauvism, Cubism, Dada, and Surrealism‚Äîfollowing Symbolism and Post-Impressionism‚Äîwere not universally appreciated. The majority of people in Germany, as elsewhere, did not care for the new art, which many resented as elitist, morally suspect, and too often incomprehensible.Adam 1992, p. 29. Wilhelm II, who took an active interest in regulating art in Germany, criticized Impressionism as \\"gutter painting\\" ()K√ºhnel, Anita (2003). \\"Entartete Kunst\\". Grove Art Online. and forbade K√§the Kollwitz from being awarded a medal for her print series A Weavers' Revolt when it was displayed in the Berlin Grand Exhibition of the Arts in 1898.Goldstein, Robert Justin, and Andrew Nedd (2015). Political Censorship of the Visual Arts in Nineteenth-Century Europe: Arresting Images. Basingstoke, Hampshire: Palgrave Macmillan. p. 159. . In 1913, the Prussian house of representatives passed a resolution \\"against degeneracy in art\\". Under the Weimar government of the 1920s, Germany emerged as a leading center of the avant-garde. It was the birthplace of Expressionism in painting and sculpture, of the atonal musical compositions of Arnold Schoenberg, and the jazz- influenced work of Paul Hindemith and Kurt Weill. Films such as Robert Wiene's The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920) and F. W. Murnau's Nosferatu (1922) brought Expressionism to cinema. The Nazis viewed the culture of the Weimar period with disgust. Their response stemmed partly from a conservative aesthetic taste and partly from their determination to use culture as a propaganda tool.Adam 1992, p. 110. On both counts, a painting such as Otto Dix's War Cripples (1920) was anathema to them. It unsparingly depicts four badly disfigured veterans of the First World War, then a familiar sight on Berlin's streets, rendered in caricatured style. (In 1937, it would be displayed in the Degenerate Art exhibition next to a label accusing Dix‚Äîhimself a volunteer in World War INorbert Wolf, Uta Grosenick (2004), Expressionism, Taschen, p. 34. .‚Äîof \\"an insult to the German heroes of the Great War\\".Barron 1991, p. 54.) In 1930 Wilhelm Frick, a Nazi, became Minister for Culture and Education in the state of Thuringia., p. 54 By his order, 70 mostly Expressionist paintings were removed from the permanent exhibition of the Weimar Schlossmuseum in 1930, and the director of the K√∂nig Albert Museum in Zwickau, Hildebrand Gurlitt, was dismissed for displaying modern art. As dictator, Hitler gave his personal taste in art the force of law to a degree never before seen. Only in Stalin's Soviet Union, where Socialist Realism was the mandatory style, had a modern state shown such concern with regulation of the arts.Barron 1991, p. 10. In the case of Germany, the model was to be classical Greek and Roman art, regarded by Hitler as an art whose exterior form embodied an inner racial ideal.Grosshans 1983, p. 87. Art historian Henry Grosshans says that Hitler \\"saw Greek and Roman art as uncontaminated by Jewish influences. Modern art was [seen as] an act of aesthetic violence by the Jews against the German spirit. Such was true to Hitler even though only Liebermann, Meidner, Freundlich, and Marc Chagall, among those who made significant contributions to the German modernist movement, were Jewish. But Hitler ... took upon himself the responsibility of deciding who, in matters of culture, thought and acted like a Jew.\\"Grosshans 1983, p. 86. The supposedly \\"Jewish\\" nature of all art that was indecipherable, distorted, or that represented \\"depraved\\" subject matter was explained through the concept of degeneracy, which held that distorted and corrupted art was a symptom of an inferior race. By propagating the theory of degeneracy, the Nazis combined their anti-Semitism with their drive to control the culture, thus consolidating public support for both campaigns.Barron 1991, p. 83. Degeneracy (the Magdeburg cenotaph), by Ernst Barlach was declared to be degenerate art due to the \\"deformity\\" and emaciation of the figures‚Äîcorresponding to Nordau's theorized connection between \\"mental and physical degeneration\\". The term (or \\"degeneracy\\") had gained currency in Germany by the late 19th century when the critic and author Max Nordau devised the theory presented in his 1892 book Entartung.Barron 1991, p. 26. Nordau drew upon the writings of the criminologist Cesare Lombroso, whose The Criminal Man, published in 1876, attempted to prove that there were \\"born criminals\\" whose atavistic personality traits could be detected by scientifically measuring abnormal physical characteristics. Nordau developed from this premise a critique of modern art, explained as the work of those so corrupted and enfeebled by modern life that they have lost the self- control needed to produce coherent works. He attacked Aestheticism in English literature and described the mysticism of the Symbolist movement in French literature as a product of mental pathology. Explaining the painterliness of Impressionism as the sign of a diseased visual cortex, he decried modern degeneracy while praising traditional German culture. Despite the fact that Nordau was Jewish and a key figure in the Zionist movement (Lombroso was also Jewish), his theory of artistic degeneracy would be seized upon by German National Socialists during the Weimar Republic as a rallying point for their anti-Semitic and racist demand for Aryan purity in art. Belief in a Germanic spirit‚Äîdefined as mystical, rural, moral, bearing ancient wisdom, and noble in the face of a tragic destiny‚Äîexisted long before the rise of the Nazis; the composer Richard Wagner celebrated such ideas in his work.Adam 1992, pp. 23‚Äì24. Beginning before World War I, the well-known German architect and painter Paul Schultze-Naumburg's influential writings, which invoked racial theories in condemning modern art and architecture, supplied much of the basis for Adolf Hitler's belief that classical Greece and the Middle Ages were the true sources of Aryan art.Adam 1992, pp. 29‚Äì32. Schultze-Naumburg subsequently wrote such books as ' (The art of the Germans. Its nature and its works) and ' (Art and Race), the latter published in 1928, in which he argued that only racially pure artists could produce a healthy art which upheld timeless ideals of classical beauty, while racially mixed modern artists produced disordered artworks and monstrous depictions of the human form. By reproducing examples of modern art next to photographs of people with deformities and diseases, he graphically reinforced the idea of modernism as a sickness.Grosshans 1983, p. 9. Grosshans calls Schultze-Naumburg \\"[u]ndoubtedly the most important\\" of the era's German critics of modernism. Alfred Rosenberg developed this theory in ' (Myth of the Twentieth Century), published in 1933, which became a best-seller in Germany and made Rosenberg the Party's leading ideological spokesman.Adam 1992, p. 33. Purge Hitler's rise to power on January 31, 1933, was quickly followed by actions intended to cleanse the culture of degeneracy: book burnings were organized, artists and musicians were dismissed from teaching positions, and curators who had shown a partiality for modern art were replaced by Party members.Adam 1992, p. 52. In September 1933, the (Reich Culture Chamber) was established, with Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's (Reich Minister for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda) in charge. Sub-chambers within the Culture Chamber, representing the individual arts (music, film, literature, architecture, and the visual arts) were created; these were membership groups consisting of \\"racially pure\\" artists supportive of the Party, or willing to be compliant. Goebbels made it clear: \\"In future only those who are members of a chamber are allowed to be productive in our cultural life. Membership is open only to those who fulfill the entrance condition. In this way all unwanted and damaging elements have been excluded.\\"Adam 1992, p. 53. By 1935 the Reich Culture Chamber had 100,000 members. Nonetheless, during 1933‚Äì1934 there was some confusion within the Party on the question of Expressionism. Goebbels and some others believed that the forceful works of such artists as Emil Nolde, Ernst Barlach and Erich Heckel exemplified the Nordic spirit; as Goebbels explained, \\"We National Socialists are not unmodern; we are the carrier of a new modernity, not only in politics and in social matters, but also in art and intellectual matters.\\"Adam 1992, p. 56. However, a faction led by Alfred Rosenberg despised the Expressionists, and the result was a bitter ideological dispute, which was settled only in September 1934, when Hitler declared that there would be no place for modernist experimentation in the Reich.Grosshans 1983, pp. 73‚Äì74. This edict left many artists initially uncertain as to their status. The work of the Expressionist painter Emil Nolde, a committed member of the Nazi party, continued to be debated even after he was ordered to cease artistic activity in 1936.Boa, Elizabeth, and Rachel Palfreyman (2000). Heimat: a German Dream: Regional Loyalties and National Identity in German Culture, 1890‚Äì1990. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 158. . For many modernist artists, such as Max Beckmann, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, and Oskar Schlemmer, it was not until June 1937 that they surrendered any hope that their work would be tolerated by the authorities.Kimmelman, Michael (June 19, 2014). \\"The Art Hitler Hated\\".

Although books by Franz Kafka could no longer be bought by 1939, works by ideologically suspect authors such as Hermann Hesse and Hans Fallada were widely read.Laqueur 1996, p. 74. Mass culture was less stringently regulated than high culture, possibly because the authorities feared the consequences of too heavy-handed interference in popular entertainment.Laqueur 1996, p. 73. Thus, until the outbreak of the war, most Hollywood films could be screened, including It Happened One Night, San Francisco, and Gone with the Wind. While performance of atonal music was banned, the prohibition of jazz was less strictly enforced. Benny Goodman and Django Reinhardt were popular, and leading British and American jazz bands continued to perform in major cities until the war; thereafter, dance bands officially played \\"swing\\" rather than the banned jazz.Laqueur 1996, pp. 73‚Äì75. Entartete Kunst exhibit Entartete Kunst poster, Berlin, 1938 By 1937, the concept of degeneracy was firmly entrenched in Nazi policy. On June 30 of that year Goebbels put Adolf Ziegler, the head of (Reich Chamber of Visual Art), in charge of a six-man commission authorized to confiscate from museums and art collections throughout the Reich, any remaining art deemed modern, degenerate, or subversive. These works were then to be presented to the public in an exhibit intended to incite further revulsion against the \\"perverse Jewish spirit\\" penetrating German culture.Adam 1992, p. 123, quoting Goebbels, November 26, 1937, in Von der Grossmacht zur Weltmacht. Self-portrait by Elfriede Lohse-W√§chtler, who was murdered at Sonnenstein Euthanasia Centre in 1940 Over 5000 works were seized, including 1052 by Nolde, 759 by Heckel, 639 by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and 508 by Max Beckmann, as well as smaller numbers of works by such artists as Alexander Archipenko, Marc Chagall, James Ensor, Albert Gleizes, Henri Matisse, Jean Metzinger, Pablo Picasso, and Vincent van Gogh.Adam 1992, pp. 121‚Äì122. The exhibit, featuring over 650 paintings, sculptures, prints, and books from the collections of 32 German museums, premiered in Munich on July 19, 1937, and remained on view until November 30, before traveling to 11 other cities in Germany and Austria. The exhibit was held on the second floor of a building formerly occupied by the Institute of Archaeology. Viewers had to reach the exhibit by means of a narrow staircase. The first sculpture was an oversized, theatrical portrait of Jesus, which purposely intimidated viewers as they literally bumped into it in order to enter. The rooms were made of temporary partitions and deliberately chaotic and overfilled. Pictures were crowded together, sometimes unframed, usually hung by cord. The first three rooms were grouped thematically. The first room contained works considered demeaning of religion; the second featured works by Jewish artists in particular; the third contained works deemed insulting to the women, soldiers and farmers of Germany. The rest of the exhibit had no particular theme. There were slogans painted on the walls. For example: * Insolent mockery of the Divine under Centrist rule * Revelation of the Jewish racial soul * An insult to German womanhood * The ideal‚Äîcretin and whore * Deliberate sabotage of national defense * German farmers‚Äîa Yiddish view * The Jewish longing for the wilderness reveals itself‚Äîin Germany the Negro becomes the racial ideal of a degenerate art * Madness becomes method * Nature as seen by sick minds * Even museum bigwigs called this the \\"art of the German people\\"Barron 1991, p. 46. Speeches of Nazi party leaders contrasted with artist manifestos from various art movements, such as Dada and Surrealism. Next to many paintings were labels indicating how much money a museum spent to acquire the artwork. In the case of paintings acquired during the post-war Weimar hyperinflation of the early 1920s, when the cost of a kilogram loaf of bread reached 233 billion German marks,Evans 2004, p. 106. the prices of the paintings were of course greatly exaggerated. The exhibit was designed to promote the idea that modernism was a conspiracy by people who hated German decency, frequently identified as Jewish-Bolshevist, although only 6 of the 112 artists included in the exhibition were in fact Jewish.Barron 1991, p. 9. The exhibition program contained photographs of modern artworks accompanied by defamatory text.Barron, Stephanie, Guenther and Peter W., \\"Degenerate Art\\": The Fate of the Avant-Garde in Nazi Germany], LACMA, 1991, . The cover featured the exhibition title‚Äîwith the word , meaning art, in scare quotes‚Äîsuperimposed on an image of Otto Freundlich's sculpture . A few weeks after the opening of the exhibition, Goebbels ordered a second and more thorough scouring of German art collections; inventory lists indicate that the artworks seized in this second round, combined with those gathered prior to the exhibition, amounted to 16,558 works.Barron 1991, pp. 47‚Äì48. Coinciding with the exhibition, the (Great German art exhibition) made its premiere amid much pageantry. This exhibition, held at the palatial (House of German Art), displayed the work of officially approved artists such as Arno Breker and Adolf Wissel. At the end of four months had attracted over two million visitors, nearly three and a half times the number that visited the nearby .Adam 1992, pp. 124‚Äì125. Fate of the artists and their work Avant-garde German artists were now branded both enemies of the state and a threat to German culture. Many went into exile. Max Beckmann fled to Amsterdam on the opening day of the exhibit.Schulz-Hoffmann and Weiss 1984, p. 461. Max Ernst emigrated to America with the assistance of Peggy Guggenheim. Ernst Ludwig Kirchner committed suicide in Switzerland in 1938. Paul Klee spent his years in exile in Switzerland, yet was unable to obtain Swiss citizenship because of his status as a degenerate artist. A leading German dealer, Alfred Flechtheim, died penniless in exile in London in 1937. Other artists remained in internal exile. Otto Dix retreated to the countryside to paint unpeopled landscapes in a meticulous style that would not provoke the authorities.Karcher 1988, p. 206. The Reichskulturkammer forbade artists such as Edgar Ende and Emil Nolde from purchasing painting materials. Those who remained in Germany were forbidden to work at universities and were subject to surprise raids by the Gestapo in order to ensure that they were not violating the ban on producing artwork; Nolde secretly carried on painting, but using only watercolors (so as not to be betrayed by the telltale odor of oil paint).Bradley 1986, p. 115. Although officially no artists were put to death because of their work, those of Jewish descent who did not escape from Germany in time were sent to concentration camps.Petropoulos 2000, p. 217. Others were murdered in the Action T4 (see, for example, Elfriede Lohse-W√§chtler). Membership in the Nazi Party did not protect Emil Nolde, whose 1912 woodcut The Prophet is shown here. 1052 of Nolde's paintings were removed from German museums, more than any other artist. After the exhibit, paintings were sorted out for sale and sold in Switzerland at auction; some pieces were acquired by museums, others by private collectors. Nazi officials took many for their private use: for example, Hermann G√∂ring took 14 valuable pieces, including a Van Gogh and a C√©zanne. In March 1939, the Berlin Fire Brigade burned about 4000 paintings, drawings and prints that had apparently little value on the international market. This was an act of unprecedented vandalism, although the Nazis were well used to book burnings on a large scale.Grosshans 1983, p. 113. A large amount of \\"degenerate art\\" by Picasso, Dal√≠, Ernst, Klee, L√©ger and Mir√≥ was destroyed in a bonfire on the night of July 27, 1942, in the gardens of the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume in Paris.Hellman, Mallory, Let's Go Paris, p. 84. Whereas it was forbidden to export \\"degenerate art\\" to Germany, it was still possible to buy and sell artworks of \\"degenerate artists\\" in occupied France. The Nazis considered indeed that they should not be concerned by Frenchmen's mental health.Bertrand Dorl√©ac, Laurence (1993). L'art de la d√©faite, 1940‚Äì1944. Paris: Editions du Seuil. p. 482. . As a consequence, many works made by these artists were sold at the main French auction house during the occupation.Oosterlinck, Kim (2009). \\"The Price of Degenerate Art\\", Working Papers CEB 09-031.RS, ULB ‚Äì Universite Libre de Bruxelles. The couple Sophie and Emanuel Fohn, who exchanged the works for harmless works of art from their own possession and kept them in safe custody throughout the National Socialist era, saved about 250 works by ostracized artists. The collection survived in South Tyrol from 1943 and was handed over to the Bavarian State Painting Collections in 1964. After the collapse of Nazi Germany and the invasion of Berlin by the Red Army, some artwork from the exhibit was found buried underground. It is unclear how many of these then reappeared in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, where they still remain. In 2010, as work began to extend an underground line from Alexanderplatz through the historic city centre to the Brandenburg Gate, a number of sculptures from the degenerate art exhibition were unearthed in the cellar of a private house close to the \\"Rote Rathaus\\". These included, for example, the bronze cubist-style statue of a female dancer by the artist Marg Moll, and are now on display at the Neues Museum.

In 1996 the Victoria and Albert Museum in London acquired the only known surviving copy of the complete listing. The document was donated to the V&A;'s National Art Library by Elfriede Fischer, the widow of the art dealer Heinrich Robert (\\"Harry\\") Fischer. Copies were made available to other libraries and research organisations at the time, and much of the information was subsequently incorporated into a database maintained by the Freie Universit√§t Berlin. A digital reproduction of the entire inventory was published on the Victoria and Albert Museum's website in January 2014. The V&A;'s publication consists of two PDFs, one for each of the original volumes. Both PDFs also include an introduction in English and German. Entartete Kunst, Victoria and Albert Museum. 2014. An online version of the inventory was made available on the V&A;'s website in November 2019, with additional features. The new edition uses IIIF page-turning software and incorporates an interactive index arranged by city and museum.

Details include artist surname, inventory number, title and medium, followed by a code indicating the fate of the artwork, then the surname of the buyer or art dealer (if any) and any price paid. The entries also include abbreviations to indicate whether the work was included in any of the various exhibitions (see Degenerate Art Exhibition) or (see The Eternal Jew (art exhibition)).Victoria and Albert Museum 2014, vol. 1, p. 7. The main dealers mentioned are Bernhard A. B√∂hmer (or Boehmer), Karl Buchholz, Hildebrand Gurlitt, and Ferdinand M√∂ller (or Moeller). The manuscript also contains entries for many artworks acquired by the artist Emanuel Fohn, in exchange for other works.Victoria and Albert Museum 2014, vol. 1 and 2.  21st-century reactions  Neil Levi, writing in The Chronicle of Higher Education, suggested that the branding of art as \\"degenerate\\" was only partly an aesthetic aim of the Nazis. Another was the confiscation of valuable artwork, a deliberate means to enrich the regime.Neil Levi, \\"The Uses of Nazi ‚ÄòDegenerate Art‚Äô\\", The Chronicle of Higher Education (Nov. 12, 2013).  In popular culture  A Picasso, a play by Jeffrey Hatcher based loosely on actual events, is set in Paris 1941 and sees Picasso being asked to authenticate three works for inclusion in an upcoming exhibition of Degenerate art.

It is advocated by those who consider the focus of the present standards and practices wholly inadequate to the task of measuring and reporting the activity, success, and failure of modern enterprise, including government. Real debate concerns concepts such as whether to report transactions, such as asset acquisitions, at their cost or at their current market values. The former, traditional approach, appeals for its reliability, but can quickly lose its relevance due to inflation and other factors; the latter, increasingly common approach, is appealing for its relevance, but is less reliable due to the need to use subjective measures. Accounting standards setters such as the International Accounting Standards Board attempt to strike a balance between relevance and reliability.  Business  Limited reforms within professional management circles have led in the past to activity-based costing, economic value added, and risk measures. Current accounting practices have also been criticized for being too complex. Heads of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since the 1980s have consistently complained that this lobbying makes it impossible for them to apply meaningful reform, even in the wake of accounting scandals, e.g. that which felled Arthur Andersen in 2002.  National economies  Any comprehensive scheme of accounting reform is a major professional and academic enterprise. Typically it requires examination of the role of each of the fundamental factors of production, an analysis of capital indicating how many types there are and how each supports each factor of a production process. A comprehensive scheme that would affect, for instance, the United Nations standards for national accounts, the rules of the Bank for International Settlements, or listing requirements on the major stock exchanges, would have to defend any change against critics that advocated lesser reforms. Marilyn Waring, who deeply criticized the UN account system for systematically under-valuing the social and economic contributions of women, stated also that she had to read literally an entire room full of books in order even to understand the standards applied today. The critique from ecological economics claims that most means of measuring well-being indicated that the developed nations were in a state of \\"uneconomic growth\\" through the 1980s and 1990s, due mostly to failures of measurement, most or all of which could be tracked back to the practice of using Gross National Product or other narrow indicators as a means of making money supply (and other economic) decisions. Robert Costanza, Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and others who advocate a consistent global system for valuing natural capital, note that failures in this area are particularly grim: promoting extinction, loss of biodiversity, climate change and destructive weather for the sake of such \\"growth\\". John McMurtry characterized this as \\"the cancer stage of capitalism\\". What makes \\"economic sense\\" under current standards, they argue, is in fact leading to ecological catastrophe, social conflict, and economic chaos.

It first appeared in late 1934, invented by Donn Beach at his Hollywood Don the Beachcomber restaurant. It was popularized on the East coast soon afterwards at the 1939 New York World's Fair. History Legend has it that Donn Beach originally concocted the Zombie to help a hung-over customer get through a business meeting. The customer returned several days later to complain that he had been turned into a zombie for his entire trip. Its smooth, fruity taste works to conceal its extremely high alcoholic content. Don the Beachcomber restaurants limit their customers to two Zombies apiece because of their potency, which Beach said could make one \\"like the walking dead.\\" According to the original recipe, the Zombie cocktail included three different kinds of rum, lime juice, falernum, Angostura bitters, Pernod, grenadine, and \\"Don's Mix\\", a combination of cinnamon syrup and grapefruit juice. Beach was very cautious with the recipes of his original cocktails. His instructions for his bartenders contained coded references to ingredients, the contents of which were only known to him. Beach had reason to worry; a copy of the Zombie was served at the 1939 New York World's Fair by a man trying to take credit for it named Monte Proser (later of the mob-tied Copacabana). Beach's original recipes for the Zombie and other Tiki drinks have been published in Sippin' Safari by Jeff \\"Beachbum\\" Berry. Berry researched the origins of many Tiki cocktails, interviewing bartenders from Don the Beachcomber's and other original Tiki places and digging up other original sources. Mostly notably, Sippin' Safari details Beach's development of the Zombie with three different recipes dating from 1934 to 1956. The Zombie was occasionally served heated (a drink more commonly known today as the I.B.A. Hot Zombie), as outlined by the Catering Industry Employee (CIE) journal: \\"Juice of 1 lime, unsweetened pineapple juice, bitters, 1 ounce heavily bodied rum, 2 ounces of Gold Label rum, 1 ounce of White Label rum, 1 ounce of apricot-flavored brandy, 1 ounce of papaya juice\\"CIE: Volumes 50-51 by Hotel & Restaurant Employees and Bartenders International Union, Hotel Employees & Restaurant Employees International Union, Hotel and Restaurant Employees' International Alliance and Bartenders' International League of America in 1941 Tiki culture influence Due to the popularity of the cocktail during the Tiki craze and the fact that Beach kept his recipe secret and occasionally altered it, there are many variations of the Zombie served at other restaurants and bars (some tasting nothing like the original cocktail). The word zombie also began to be used at other tiki themed establishments, such as at the Zombie Hut and Zombie Village. Trader Vic also listed a recipe for the Zombie in his 1947 Bartender's Guide. Other competitors created drinks linked to the zombie. At Stephen Crane's Chicago Kon-Tiki Ports restaurant they featured a drink on the menu called The Walking Dead: \\"Makes the dead walk and talk.

Structure VIII. Structure IV. Outside stairway, Structure IX Becan (Spanish: Bec√°n) is an archaeological site of the Maya civilization in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. Becan is located near the center of the Yucat√°n Peninsula, in the present-day Mexican state of Campeche, about 150 km (93.2 mi) north of Tikal. The Maya sites of Balamku, Calakmul, Chicanna and Xpuhil are nearby. The name Becan was bestowed on the site by archaeologists who rediscovered the site, meaning \\"ravine or canyon formed by water\\" in Yukatek Maya, after the site's most prominent and unusual feature, its surrounding ditch. Archaeological evidence shows that Becan was occupied in the middle Preclassic Maya period, about 550 BCE, and grew to a major population and ceremonial center a few hundred years later in the late Preclassic. The population and scale of construction declined in the early classic (c 250 CE), although it was still a significant site, and trade goods from Teotihuacan have been found. A ditch and ramparts were constructed around the site at this time. There is a ditch that runs the circumference of the city which covers approximately 25 hectares (61.7 acres). Around 500 the population again increased dramatically and many large new buildings were constructed, mostly in the Rio Bec style of Maya architecture. Construction of major buildings and elite monuments stopped about 830, although ceramic evidence show that the site continued to be occupied for some time thereafter, although the population went into decline and Becan was probably abandoned by about 1200. The site was first documented in the archaeological literature in 1934 by archaeologists Karl Ruppert and John Denison on an expedition to the region sponsored by the Carnegie Institution of Washington, who named it \\"Becan\\" after the conspicuous ditch surrounding the center of the city; the ancient name of the site is not known. From 1969 to 1971 archaeological excavations were made at Becan sponsored by Tulane University and the National Geographic Society. In 1984, while conducting research at the site, one of Mexico's \\"most important archeologists\\", Rom√°n Pi√±a Ch√°n, fell from the pyramid at Bec√°n, becoming paralyzed. On 13 July 2001, at a homage paid to Pi√±a by the National Museum of Anthropology, it was announced that Luc√≠a Campa√±a, had discovered a pre-Hispanic tomb in the ninth building at the site, the previous day.

This is in contrast to uniformitarianism (sometimes described as gradualism), in which slow incremental changes, such as erosion, created all the Earth's geological features. The proponents of uniformitarianism held that the present was the key to the past, and that all geological processes (such as erosion) throughout the past were like those that can be observed now. Since the early disputes, a more inclusive and integrated view of geologic events has developed, in which the scientific consensus accepts that there were some catastrophic events in the geologic past, but these were explicable as extreme examples of natural processes which can occur. Proponents of catastrophism proposed that the geological epochs had ended with violent and sudden natural catastrophes such as great floods and the rapid formation of major mountain chains. Plants and animals living in the parts of the world where such events occurred were made extinct, being replaced abruptly by the new forms whose fossils defined the geological strata. Some catastrophists attempted to relate at least one such change to the Biblical account of Noah's flood. The concept was first popularised by the early 19th-century French scientist Georges Cuvier, who proposed that new life forms had moved in from other areas after local floods, and avoided religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings. History =Geology and biblical beliefs= In the early development of geology, efforts were made in a predominantly Christian western society to reconcile biblical narratives of Creation and the universal flood with new concepts about the processes which had formed the Earth. The discovery of other ancient flood myths was taken as explaining why the flood story was \\"stated in scientific methods with surprising frequency among the Greeks\\", an example being Plutarch's account of the Ogygian flood. =Cuvier and the natural theologians= The leading scientific proponent of catastrophism in the early nineteenth century was the French anatomist and paleontologist Georges Cuvier. His motivation was to explain the patterns of extinction and faunal succession that he and others were observing in the fossil record. While he did speculate that the catastrophe responsible for the most recent extinctions in Eurasia might have been the result of the inundation of low-lying areas by the sea, he did not make any reference to Noah's flood. Nor did he ever make any reference to divine creation as the mechanism by which repopulation occurred following the extinction event. In fact Cuvier, influenced by the ideas of the Enlightenment and the intellectual climate of the French revolution, avoided religious or metaphysical speculation in his scientific writings. Cuvier also believed that the stratigraphic record indicated that there had been several of these revolutions, which he viewed as recurring natural events, amid long intervals of stability during the history of life on earth. This led him to believe the Earth was several million years old. By contrast in Britain, where natural theology was influential during the early nineteenth century, a group of geologists including William Buckland and Robert Jameson interpreted Cuvier's work differently. Cuvier had written an introduction to a collection of his papers on fossil quadrupeds, discussing his ideas on catastrophic extinction. Jameson translated Cuvier's introduction into English, publishing it under the title Theory of the Earth. He added extensive editorial notes to the translation, explicitly linking the latest of Cuvier's revolutions with the biblical flood. The resulting essay was extremely influential in the English- speaking world. Buckland spent much of his early career trying to demonstrate the reality of the biblical flood using geological evidence. He frequently cited Cuvier's work, even though Cuvier had proposed an inundation of limited geographic extent and extended duration, whereas Buckland, to be consistent with the biblical account, was advocating a universal flood of short duration. Eventually, Buckland abandoned flood geology in favor of the glaciation theory advocated by Louis Agassiz, following a visit to the Alps where Agassiz demonstrated the effects of glaciation at first hand. As a result of the influence of Jameson, Buckland, and other advocates of natural theology, the nineteenth century debate over catastrophism took on much stronger religious overtones in Britain than elsewhere in Europe. =The rise of uniformitarianism in geology= Uniformitarian explanations for the formation of sedimentary rock and an understanding of the immense stretch of geological time, or as the concept came to be known deep time, were found in the writing of James Hutton, sometimes known as the father of geology, in the late 18th century. The geologist Charles Lyell built upon Hutton's ideas during the first half of 19th century and amassed observations in support of the uniformitarian idea that the Earth's features had been shaped by same geological processes that could be observed in the present acting gradually over an immense period of time. Lyell presented his ideas in the influential three volume work, Principles of Geology, published in the 1830s, which challenged theories about geological cataclysms proposed by proponents of catastrophism like Cuvier and Buckland. From around 1850 to 1980, most geologists endorsed uniformitarianism (\\"The present is the key to the past\\") and gradualism (geologic change occurs slowly over long periods of time) and rejected the idea that cataclysmic events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or floods of vastly greater power than those observed at the present time, played any significant role in the formation of the Earth's surface. Instead they believed that the earth had been shaped by the long term action of forces such as volcanism, earthquakes, erosion, and sedimentation, that could still be observed in action today. In part, the geologists' rejection was fostered by their impression that the catastrophists of the early nineteenth century believed that God was directly involved in determining the history of Earth. Some of the theories about Catastrophism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were connected with religion and catastrophic origins were sometimes considered miraculous rather than natural events. The rise in uniformitarianism made the introduction of a new catastrophe theory very difficult. In 1923 J Harlen Bretz published a paper on the channeled scablands formed by glacial Lake Missoula in Washington State, USA. Bretz encountered resistance to his theories from the geology establishment of the day, kicking off an acrimonious 40 year debate. Finally in 1979 Bretz received the Penrose Medal; the Geological Society of America's highest award.Penrose Medal 1979 to J Harlen Bretz, Geological Society of America =Immanuel Velikovsky's views= In the 1950s, Immanuel Velikovsky propounded catastrophism in several popular books. He speculated that the planet Venus is a former \\"comet\\" which was ejected from Jupiter and subsequently 3,500 years ago made two catastrophic close passes by Earth, 52 years apart, and later interacted with Mars, which then had a series of near collisions with Earth which ended in 687 BCE, before settling into its current orbit. Velikovsky used this to explain the biblical plagues of Egypt, the biblical reference to the \\"Sun standing still\\" for a day (Joshua 10:12 & 13, explained by changes in Earth's rotation), and the sinking of Atlantis. Scientists vigorously rejected Velikovsky's conjectures. Current application Neocatastrophism is the explanation of sudden extinctions in the palaeontological record by high magnitude, low frequency events (such as asteroid impacts, super-volcanic eruptions, supernova gamma ray bursts, etc.), as opposed to the more prevalent geomorphological thought which emphasises low magnitude, high frequency events. =Luis Alvarez impact event hypothesis= Over the past 25 years, a scientifically based catastrophism has gained wide acceptance with regard to certain events in the distant past. One impetus for this change came from the publication of a historic paper by Walter and Luis Alvarez in 1980. This paper suggested that a asteroid struck Earth 66 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period. The impact wiped out about 70% of all species, including the dinosaurs, leaving behind the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary (K‚ÄìT boundary). In 1990, a candidate crater marking the impact was identified at Chicxulub in the Yucat√°n Peninsula of Mexico. Since then, the debate about the extinction of the dinosaurs and other mass extinction events has centered on whether the extinction mechanism was the asteroid impact, widespread volcanism (which occurred about the same time), or some other mechanism or combination. Most of the mechanisms suggested are catastrophic in nature. The observation of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 cometary collision with Jupiter illustrated that catastrophic events occur as natural events. =Comparison with uniformitarianism= One of the key differences between catastrophism and uniformitarianism is that uniformitarianism requires the assumption of vast timelines, whereas catastrophism does not. Today most geologists combine catastrophist and uniformitarianist standpoints, taking the view that Earth's history is a slow, gradual story punctuated by occasional natural catastrophic events that have affected Earth and its inhabitants. =Moon-formation= Modern theories also suggest that Earth's anomalously large moon was formed catastrophically. In a paper published in Icarus in 1975, William K. Hartmann and Donald R. Davis proposed that a catastrophic near-miss by a large planetesimal early in Earth's formation approximately 4.5 billion years ago blew out rocky debris, remelted Earth and formed the Moon, thus explaining the Moon's lesser density and lack of an iron core. The impact theory does have some faults; some computer simulations show the formation of a ring or multiple moons post impact, and elements are not quite the same between the earth and moon.

The rest of the Yahi (as well as many members of their parent tribe, the Yana) were killed in the California genocide in the 19th century. Ishi, who was widely acclaimed as the \\"last wild Indian\\" in America, lived most of his life isolated from modern American culture. In 1911, aged 50, he emerged near the foothills of Lassen Peak in Northern California. Ishi, which means \\"man\\" in the Yana language, is an adopted name. The anthropologist Alfred Kroeber gave him this name because in the Yahi culture, tradition demanded that he not speak his own name until formally introduced by another Yahi. When asked his name, he said: \\"I have none, because there were no people to name me,\\" meaning that there was no other Yahi to speak his name on his behalf. Ishi was taken in by anthropologists at the University of California, Berkeley, who both studied him and hired him as a janitor. He lived most of his remaining five years in a university building in San Francisco. His life was depicted and discussed in multiple films and books, notably the biographical account Ishi in Two Worlds published by Theodora Kroeber in 1961. Biography =Early life= Ishi's quiver of arrows (Richard Burrill, 2011) In 1865, Ishi and his family were attacked in the Three Knolls Massacre, in which 40 of their tribesmen were killed. Although 33 Yahi survived to escape, cattlemen killed about half of the survivors. The last survivors, including Ishi and his family, went into hiding for the next 44 years. Their tribe was popularly believed to be extinct.Ishi: A Real-Life Last Of The Mohicans, Mohican Press Prior to the California Gold Rush of 1848‚Äì1855, the Yahi population numbered 404 in California, but the total Yana in the larger region numbered 2,997.Rockafellar, Nancy (date unknown). \\"The story of Ishi: A Chronology\\". Retrieved on 2011-01-14 from https://history.library.ucsf.edu/ishi.html. The gold rush brought tens of thousands of miners and settlers to northern California, putting pressure on native populations. Gold mining damaged water supplies and killed fish; the deer left the area. The settlers brought new infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles.\\"Ishi Biography\\" The northern Yana group became extinct while the central and southern groups (who later became part of Redding Rancheria) and Yahi populations dropped dramatically. Searching for food, they came into conflict with settlers, who set bounties of 50 cents per scalp and 5 dollars per head on the natives. In 1865, the settlers attacked the Yahi while they were still asleep. Richard Burrill wrote, in Ishi Rediscovered: > \\"In 1865, near the Yahi‚Äôs special place, Black Rock, the waters of Mill > Creek turned red at the Three Knolls Massacre.

Ishi Rediscovered. > Barron's art guides, Anthro Company, 2001. . In late 1908, a group of surveyors came across the camp inhabited by two men, a middle-aged woman, and an elderly woman. These were Ishi, his uncle, his younger sister, and his mother, respectively. The former three fled while the latter hid herself in blankets to avoid detection, as she was sick and unable to flee. The surveyors ransacked the camp, and Ishi's mother died soon after his return. His sister and uncle never returned. =Captured into American society= After the 1908 attack, Ishi spent three more years in the wilderness, alone. Finally, starving and with nowhere to go, at around the age of 50, on August 29, 1911, Ishi was captured attempting to forage for meat near Oroville, California, after forest fires in the area. The local sheriff took the man into custody for his protection. The \\"wild man\\" caught the imagination and attention of thousands of onlookers and curiosity seekers. Professors at the University of California, Berkeley, Museum of Anthropology‚Äînow the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology (PAHMA)‚Äîread about him and brought him to their facility, then housed on the University of California, San Francisco campus in an old law school building. Studied by the university, Ishi also worked as a janitor and lived in an apartment at the museum for most of the remaining five years of his life. In June 1915, he temporarily lived in Berkeley with the anthropologist Thomas Talbot Waterman and his family. Ishi (right) with Alfred L. Kroeber in 1911 Waterman and Alfred L. Kroeber, director of the museum, studied Ishi closely over the years and interviewed him at length in an effort to reconstruct Yahi culture. He described family units, naming patterns, and the ceremonies that he knew. Much tradition had already been lost when he was growing up, as there were few older survivors in his group. He identified material items and showed the techniques by which they were made. Ishi provided valuable information on his native Yana language, which was recorded and studied by the linguist Edward Sapir, who had previously done work on the northern dialects. Lacking acquired immunity to the diseases common among European Americans, Ishi was often ill. He was treated by Saxton T. Pope, a professor of medicine at UCSF. Pope became close friends with Ishi, and learned from him how to make bows and arrows in the Yahi way. He and Ishi often hunted together. Ishi died of tuberculosis on March 25, 1916. It is said his last words were \\"You stay. I go.\\" His friends at the university tried to prevent an autopsy on Ishi's body, since Yahi tradition called for the body to remain intact. However, the doctors at the University of California medical school performed an autopsy before Waterman could prevent it. Ishi's brain was preserved and his body cremated. His friends placed grave goods with his remains before cremation: \\"one of his bows, five arrows, a basket of acorn meal, a boxfull of shell bead money, a purse full of tobacco, three rings, and some obsidian flakes.\\" Ishi's remains were interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Colma, near San Francisco.\\"Ishi's Hiding Place\\", Butte County , A History of American Indians in California: Historic Sites, National Park Service, 2004, accessed November 5, 2010 Kroeber put Ishi's preserved brain in a deerskin-wrapped Pueblo Indian pottery jar and sent it to the Smithsonian Institution in 1917. It was held there until August 10, 2000, when the Smithsonian repatriated it to the descendants of the Redding Rancheria and Pit River tribes. This was in accordance with the National Museum of the American Indian Act of 1989 (NMAI). According to Robert Fri, director of the National Museum of Natural History, \\"Contrary to commonly-held belief, Ishi was not the last of his kind. In carrying out the repatriation process, we learned that as a Yahi‚ÄìYana Indian his closest living descendants are the Yana people of northern California.\\" His remains were also returned from Colma, and the tribal members intended to bury them in a secret place. Possible multi-ethnicity Ishi in 1914 In 1994, Steven Shackley of UC Berkeley learned of a paper by Jerald Johnson, who noted morphological evidence that Ishi's facial features and height were more typical of the Wintu and Maidu. He theorized that under pressure of diminishing populations, members of groups that were once enemies may have intermarried to survive. Johnson also referred to oral histories of the Wintu and Maidu that told of the tribes' intermarrying with the Yahi. The debate on this remains unsettled. In 1996, Shackley announced work based on a study of Ishi's projectile points and those of the northern tribes. He had found that points made by Ishi were not typical of those recovered from historical Yahi sites. Because Ishi's production was more typical of points of the Nomlaki or Wintu tribes, and markedly dissimilar to those of Yahi, Shackley suggested that Ishi may have been of mixed ancestry, and related to and raised among members of another of the tribes.02.05.96 ‚Äì \\"Ishi apparently wasn't the last Yahi, according to new evidence from UC Berkeley research archaeologist\\", News, University of Berkeley He based his conclusion on a study of the points made by Ishi compared to others held by the museum from the Yahi, Nomlaki and Wintu cultures. Among Ishi's techniques was the use of what is known as an Ishi stick, used to run long pressure flakes. This is known to be a traditional technique of the Nomlaki and Wintu tribes. This suggests that Ishi may have learned the skill directly from a male relative of one of those tribes. These people lived in small bands, close to the Yahi. They were traditional competitors and enemies of the Yahi. Similar case Ishi's story has been compared to that of Ota Benga, an Mbuti pygmy from Congo. His family had died and were not given a mourning ritual. He was taken from his home and culture. During one period, he was displayed as a zoo exhibit. Ota shot himself in the heart on March 20, 1916, five days before Ishi's death.

Mayapan was the political and cultural capital of the Maya in the Yucat√°n Peninsula during the Late Post-Classic period from the 1220s until the 1440s. Estimates of the total city population are 15,000‚Äì17,000 people, and the site has more than 4,000 structures within the city walls, and additional dwellings outside. The site has been professionally surveyed and excavated by archeological teams, beginning in 1939; five years of work was done by a team in the 1950s, and additional studies were done in the 1990s. Since 2000, a collaborative Mexican-United States team has been conducting excavations and recovery at the site, which continue. Layout Maya Ruins in Mayapan. Mayapan is 4.2 square kilometers (about 1.6 square miles) and has over 4000 structures, most of them residences, packed into this compound within the city walls. Built-up areas extend a half kilometer beyond the city walls in all directions. The stone perimeter wall has twelve gates, including seven major gates with vaulted entrances. The wall is 9.1 km (about 5.65 miles) long and is roughly ovate with a pointed northeast corner. The ceremonial center of the site is located in Square Q of the city's grid in the center of the wider western half of the walled enclosure. The ceremonial center has a tightly packed cluster of temples, colonnaded halls, oratories, shrines, sanctuaries, altars, and platforms (for oration, dancing, or stela display). A.L. Smith, an archeologist with the Carnegie Institute, estimated 10‚Äì12,000 people lived within the walled city. Mayan site, Mayapan. The picture was taken on the highest pyramid of the site. According to Dr. Gregory Simons survey outside the city walls, there were numerous additional dwellings and he revised the total population estimate to between 15,000‚Äì17,000 people. His survey results are posted online at www.mayapanperiphery.net. People living outside of the city wall engaged in agriculture, animal-raising, and specialized activities such as lime production. Russell also found a colonnaded hall outside the city wall, revealing much is still to be discovered regarding the complexity of this urban landscape. The Temple of Kukulcan, a large pyramid also known as the Castillo, is the main temple in Mayapan. It is located immediately to the east of the Cenote Ch'en Mul, which has caves radiating from it. In form, the Temple of Kukulcan (Structure Q-162 on the site map) is a radial four- staircase temple with nine terraces; it is generally similar to the Temple of Kukulcan at the earlier site of Chichen Itza. However, the Mayapan temple appears to be an inferior imitation of the one at Chichen Itza, and the city's buildings in general are not constructed as well as those in other Mayan cities. For example, most or all of the vaulted roofs in Mayapan have collapsed, while many of the better-built buildings at Chichen Itza remain intact. Other major temples in the ceremonial center include three round ones, which are unusual for the Maya area and are also linked to the deity Kukulkan/Quetzalcoatl in his wind god (Ehecatl) aspect. Unlike Chichen Itza, Mayapan has no ballcourts. The extensive residential zones of the site are composed of dwellings and ancillary domestic structures, with those around the ceremonial district larger and of higher quality and those toward the fringes being generally poorer. The houses are often arranged in small patio groups surrounding small courtyards. Houses were built haphazardly without organized streets. Lanes wind among the residences and walls. The residential areas of the site contain many cenotes, perhaps as many as 40. Settlement was the most dense in the southwestern part of the city where cenotes are more numerous. Historical overview A panorama of the Mayapan excavations from the top of the Castle of King Kukulcan. The ethnohistorical sources ‚Äì such as Diego de Landa's Relacion de las Cosas de Yucatan, compiled from native sources in the 16th century ‚Äì recount that the site was founded by Kukulcan (the Mayan name of Quetzalcoatl, the Toltec king, culture hero, and demigod) after the fall of Chichen Itza. He convened the lords of the region, who agreed to found a new capital at Mayapan. The lords divided the towns of Yucat√°n among them, and chose the chief of the Cocom family as their leader. The ethnohistorical sources recount multiple different histories of the rise and fall of Mayapan (Roys 1962). These histories are often confusing, chronologically implausible, and difficult to reconcile. For example, some sources say that the Maya revolted in 1221 against the Maya-Toltec lords of Chichen Itza. After a short civil war, the lords of various powerful cities and families met to restore a central government to Yucat√°n. They decided to build a new capital city near the town of Telchaquillo, hometown of Hunac Ceel, the general who defeated the rulers of Chichen Itza. The new city was built within a defensive wall and named Mayapan, meaning \\"Standard of the Maya people\\". The chief of the Cocom family, a rich and ancient lineage that had taken part in the revolt against Chichen, was chosen to be king, and all the other noble families and regional lords were to send members of their families to Mayapan to play parts in the government (and perhaps act as hostages for the good behavior of the subsidiary cities). Mexican mercenaries from Tabasco were also employed to keep order and maintain power. Another family, the Xiu, may have been living in the Mayapan area prior to the arrival of the Cocom; the Xiu claim to be a part of the lineage from Uxmal. This arrangement lasted for over 200 years. (An alternative account is given in a Maya chronicle from the Colonial era, claiming that Mayapan was contemporary with Chichen Itza and Uxmal and allied with those cities, but archeological evidence shows this version to be less likely.) Mayapan became the primary city in a group of allies that included much of the northern Yucat√°n, and trade partners that extended directly to Honduras, Belize, and the Caribbean island of Cozumel, and indirectly to Mexico. Though Mayapan was ruled by a council, the Jalach winik and the aj k‚Äôin (the highest ruler, and the high priest) dominated the political sphere. Below the two primary officials were many other officials with varying responsibilities. The range of classes went from the nobility, down to slaves, with intermediary classes in between. The social climate of Mayapan was made complicated by the antagonistic relationship between the factions of nobles, which were often arranged by kinship (Pugh 2009; Milbrath 2003). In 1441, Ah Xupan of the powerful noble family of Xiu became resentful of the political machinations of the Cocom rulers and organized a revolt. As a result, all of the Cocom family, except one who was away in Honduras conducting trade, were killed, Mayapan was sacked, burned, and abandoned, all the larger cities went into decline, and Yucat√°n devolved into warring city-states. Archaeological evidence indicates that at least the ceremonial center was burned at the end of the occupation. Excavation has revealed burnt roof beams in several of the major buildings in the site center. Excavations and investigations The Temple Redondo with a Mayan carving in the foreground. In 1841 John L. Stephens was the first to document parts of the Mayapan site with two important illustrations. The first was of the Q-152 round temple, and the second was of the Pyramid of Kukulkan. He was the first in a long string of explorers who drew the ruins of Mayapan. The first large-scale archeological site surveys were not conducted until 1938 by R.T. Patton. These surveys mapped the main plaza group and the city wall, and were the basis of later maps (Russell 2008). In the 1950s, archaeologists of the Carnegie Institution, including A. L. Smith, Robert Smith, Tatiana Proskouriakoff, Edwin Shook, Karl Ruppert and J. Eric Thompson conducted five years of intensive archeological investigations at Mayapan. Their work was published in a mimeographed series of Current Reports. The Current Reports have recently been republished in their entirety by the University of Colorado Press (John Weeks 2009). The final report was published by the Carnegie Institution as Mayapan, Yucatan, Mexico, by H. E. D. Pollock, Ralph L. Roys, A. L. Smith, and Tatiana Proskouriakoff (1962, Publication 619). Robert Smith published a two-volume monograph on The Pottery of Mayapan in 1971 (Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology 66, Harvard University). In the early 1990s, Clifford T. Brown of Tulane University carried out excavations in the residential zones of Mayapan as part of his doctoral dissertation research. Several years later, the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) of Mexico began extensive architectural excavations and consolidation under the direction of archaeologist Carlos Peraza Lope. This work continues to the present. It has resulted in the discovery of many important artifacts, murals, stuccoes, and architectural elements. From 2001 to 2009, further investigations were begun at the site by a team under the direction of Dr. Marilyn Masson from the State University New York at Albany, Carlos Peraza Lope of INAH, and Timothy S. Hare of Morehead State University. This \\"Economic Foundations of Mayapan\\" (PEMY) Project performed mapping, surface survey and collection, test-pitting, and horizontal excavation across the city. Major findings of this project include the identification of diverse occupational specialization among the city's commoners, who worked as craftsmen, conscripted military personnel, farmers, and domestic servants. Great variation is now recognized in the types of work performed by commoners of different households and their degrees of affluence. This project has also identified a probable major market plaza in Square K (between the site center and major north gate D); Richard Terry, Bruce Dahlin, and Daniel Bair have analyzed soil samples from this location to test the function of this locality. In 2008 and 2009, the PEMY project focused excavations on an outlying ceremonial group by the far eastern city gate (Gate H), known as Itzmal Ch'en, as part of its study of the economic and social links between governing elites and distant neighborhoods within the city. Chronology This mural partially survives in the Sala de los Frescos in Mayap√°n. In it appears a solar disk with the figure of a deity, possibly representing one of the transit of Venus that happened in years 1152 or 1275. =Before Mayapan= * Some evidence suggests overlapping occupation of the area by different cultures. Shook in 1954 said that there may have been a Puuc \\"city\\" somewhere near Mayapan prior to its post-classical settlement. The mixture of Puuc pot sherds in the lower parts of Mayapan lots may support this, but it is a very small percentage of the material (2% in most cases and no more than 4% in others). =Site chronology based on ceramics= * According to Robert Smith, the ceramicist for the Carnegie Institution, there were two ceramic phases in Mayapan: hocaba, which he said started around A.D. 1200 and may have included types named Mama Red and Navula Unslipped, more commonly associated with southern lowland settlements. (Milbrath and Pereza argue that the Hocaba phase starts in A.D. 1100, which fits better with the chronology of the southern lowland sites.) The second phase is Tases, which has some overlapping typology with the Hocaba phase. =Site chronology based on radiocarbon dates= Middle Preclassical Date :In an alley fill between the Templo Redondo and an adjoining hall, some charcoal was found that yielded a calibrated date of 540‚Äì820 B.C. But, most of the pottery in this fill was post-classical. Researchers think that this sample represented old charcoal that predated the context in which it was found. Terminal Classical Dates :A burial found on bedrock in the houselot soils of a post-classical solare dated between A.D. 600 and A.D. 780. The burial appeared to be a secondary interment, and could not be completely excavated because it intruded into a wall. There was no pottery with the burial; midden samples in this area suggest occupation prior to the construction of the post-classical houselots. :Charcoal was found on the upper floor of one of the temples that was dated to A.D. 770-1020. Researchers think that this sample is not associated with the context in which it was found. The construction fill as well as the upper floors were of post-classical age. =Early Mayapan occupation= * Three separate samples form the frame for early Mayapan occupation. These dates are A.D. 990‚Äì1170. However, two of these dates come from inexact sources. One was burned copal found in an unknown structure (apparently the label had eroded off of the structure); the researchers inferred that it was Q-95. The early date would suggest that this temple was built and in use in Mayapan's early history. * Carbon dating of the pits below what was assumed to be Q-97 (again the label had eroded) dated from A.D. 990‚Äì1180. * Charcoal found in the early construction phase of the site's main pyramid was dated A.D. 1020‚Äì1170. This sample was found in reliable context and is presumably the most accurate. It is important for suggesting that the post-classical phase in Mayapan started earlier than A.D. 1200. =Late Mayapan occupation= * Mayapan's settlement pattern radiated outwards to its fringes over time; many of the later dates are from materials outside of the main group of ruins. The fall of the city is tentatively dated around A.D. 1461, based on the lack of construction of altars and burial cists after this date. (Lope et al. 2006). According to Diego de Landa Calderon (1524 - 1579), the city was abandoned following the country's enslavement by a certain chieftain of the Yucatecan nation (in collusion with a garrison of Mexica Indians), and which abuse eventually led to internecine war, culminating in the city's demise in circa 1441.Diego de Landa Calderon, Yucat√°n before and after the Conquest, 1937 (reprinted in 2008) See: Abridged History of Yucatan, pp. 38-41.Yucat√°n Before and After the Conquest, by Diego de Landa.Mayapan Yucatan Mexico, H.E.D.

Ledyard Smith, Publication 619: Carnegie Institution of Washington, Washington, D.C. 1962, (Introduction) p. 8Kukulcan's Realm: Urban Life at Ancient Mayap√°n, Marilyn Masson & Carlos Peraza Lope, University Press of Colorado 2014, chapter 8: Militarism, Misery and Collapse Agriculture and animals Milpa, or mixed, fields may have been cultivated when Mayapan was inhabited. There is evidence that the area around Mayapan was regularly used for slash-and-burn agriculture. Cenotes and underground limestone canals serve as the only source of freshwater in this area, making them essential to support agriculture. Researchers have suggested that Mayapan was an import/export center, and that they often traded luxury goods, such as cotton, salt, and honey, for products of obsidian and metal, which they would have forged. (Paris 2008) (Melbrath & Peraza 2003:29). Today farmers use mixed fields, called the milpa fields, to cultivate maize, beans, squash, watermelons, mangoes, papayas and other crops. Also, citrus fruit such as oranges and limes are often grown within the domestic house groups of the local residents (Russell 2008:16). Faunal remains indicate that the local population used varying methods of animal acquisition. A study done by M.A. Masson and C. Peraza Lope in 2008 looked at faunal remains from two different middens, one located in the monumental center by some houses, and the other is located in the domestic area outside the monumental compound. The largest samples of recognized remains within the monumental center were from: white- tailed deer (23%), dog (4.4%), turkey (12.9%), and iguana (10.2%). The combined contributions of fish make up around 1.2% of the samples. These percentages as well as the ones that will follow for the settlement zone are based on recognized remains. Primary animals may have made up larger portions of the diet but their remains are too difficult to recognize. In the settlement zone, researchers found: white-tailed deer (8.4%), dog (1.4%), turkey (5.3%), iguana (14.5%), and fish (3.6%). Both turtle and rabbit remains were found in both sites, but they were consumed in small amounts (less than 1.5%). While excavating, the researchers noted many fish skeletons, but few fish heads. They concluded that the fish were being traded into Mayapan, and not collected near the site. If the fish had been prepared at the site, the heads would have been common refuse. Within the ceremonial center, numerous deer heads and teeth were found among the remains.(M.A. Masson, C. Peraza Lope 2008). Trade Columned hall, seen from the Kukulkan pyramid. Mayapan was a major capital in the Yucat√°n, and there is extensive evidence that it had far- reaching trade routes, as seen in architecture and artifacts of other settlements in the region. A wide variety of goods were traded, including maize, honey, salt, fish, game, cloth, and birds. =Peten= Zacpeten on Lake Salpeten ‚Äì Incense burners found at this site are nearly identical to those found at Mayapan. The temple assemblages at Zacpeten are very similar to those at Mayapan. Topoxte in Lake Yaxha, Peten also shares similarities of architecture and artifacts of effigy censers. Topoxte architectural remains show a similar stone carving style to Mayapan. Also, tiny ‚Äúdwarf‚Äù shrines found at this site were very similar to shrines found at Mayapan. The two sites appear to have been abandoned around the same time; which may suggest a connection between their governments. =Highland Guatemala= Architectural and artifact connections are seen between Mayapan and the Utatlan in highland Guatemala. Examples are similar temple assemblages, the presence of skull imagery and squatting figures, extensive and lavish use of stucco combined with crude masonry, and effigy figure censers. =Yucatan East Coast= This region also shows apparent influence of Mayapan, in similar temple assemblages, similarities in architecture, effigy censers at some sites, and parallels between architectural decoration at Mayapan and some east coast sites. The east coast sites exported products such as cotton, salt, and honey from the Yucat√°n. Sites in Guatemala traded back cacao. El Chayal in Guatemala was the only source of the obsidian found at Mayapan. =Aztecs, Central Mexico, and the Campeche Coast= The presence of Matillas Fine Orange ceramics in Mayapan suggests trade with Tabasco. This area may have mediated trade between Mayapan and the rest of Central Mexico. Sculptures and murals at Mayapan suggest that there was contact between Mayapan and the rising Aztec empire. Some Mayapan figures showed details of Aztec dress, and what appears to be an Aztec deity is carved on an altar in Mayapan. This evidence suggests a: ‚Äúcircum-Yucatecan trade route that linked Mayapan to Peten, northern Belize, and east-coast sites in the Late Postclassic period.‚Äù (Melbrath & Peraza Lope 2003:24‚Äì31) Symbolism * The symbolism present in Mayapan is particularly significant, partially because the center of the site is mainly used for ritual purposes. There are many similarities between the murals in Mayapan and the art and iconography of the Aztec and Mixteca-Puebla regions. Symbols that they have in common include: :* the sun disc (there are varying interpretations of what this represents ::* Could represent the sun god ::* However, the diving posture of the figure within the disc is a common motif used to represent a dead warrior, and because the figure is represented bound and with his heart removed it has been interpreted as a representation of a warrior sacrificed to the sun god. :* representations of Quetzalcoatl :* murals in structure Q.80 show reptile iconography which has been interpreted as participation in Mixteca-Puebla traditions. The dentition of the reptile indicate that they are serpents. There are similar representations found at Coba and on some pottery in Cholula dated to circa 1350‚Äì1550 AD. (Milbrath, Susan., Carlos Peraza Lope, Miguel Delgado K√∫. 2010) * Serpent iconography is very common at Mayapan, serpent balustrade carvings are common throughout the ritual center in the complexes that are associated with the Cocom lineage like the Castillo (Milbrath, Susan., Carlos Peraza Lope, Miguel Delgado K√∫ 2010). In contrast depictions of the rain god Chaac are common to the temples related to the Xiu lineage. (Milbrath 2009:583) There are also depictions of the Monkey-man god * Most of the iconography in Mayapan is found either in murals on the temple walls, stone carving, or carved stone covered in plaster. Evidence of inequality Directionality may have played a role in the representation of inequality among the powerful factions of Mayapan. East and west were of primary importance because it represented the track of the sun through the sky. The east was associated with: life, males, and heat; whereas the west was associated with: death, females, and cold. This has led many sources to believe that the Itza and the Xiw may have been associated with east and west. There was very little evidence for obvious separation of residence between classes. This is mostly due to the residential center of Mayapan being located around the concentration of the water filled cenotes. Most residences are tandem structures made of several building within a separating wall. Many of these tandem structures include multiple residential buildings; the size of these residential buildings, relative to each other, suggests that some of them were for slaves. The integration of classes extends to the outer edges of the residential areas probably due to the convenience of being close to the agricultural fields. Some sources indicate that the analysis of oratarios or god-houses (large house-like shrines) show boundaries that were known to the people of Mayapan. This is shown in relation to the analysis of household oratarios and those oriented around the ceremonial center of Mayapan. Unfortunately there is very little skeletal evidence found in this region because of the composition of the soil. The goods found in different house structures do suggest different levels of social status, mainly in regard to the specialization of housing structures. There are at least two examples of obsidian workshops in Mayapan. The strongest evidence for inequality in Mayapan is found in the presence of deep shafts full of sacrificial victims, this suggests that the noble class had enough power to condemn some people to death. Abandonment The site of Mayapan was abandoned sometime in the 15th century. There has been some dispute over when the actual abandonment took place. However, written records state that the site was abandoned in A.D. 1441. There appear to be several contributing factors to the abandonment of Mayapan. Around A.D. 1420 a riot was started by the Xius against the Cocom which culminated in the death of nearly all (if not in fact all) of the Cocom lineage. Pestilence may have been involved in the subsequent abandonment of the site by the remaining Xiu inhabitants. There were several sources of evidence to support this interpretation. Evidence of burned wood was found inside of structure Y-45a as well as burned roofing material on many of the other structures that was dated to around the time of the collapse in K‚Äôatun 8 Ahua (roughly A.D. 1441‚Äì1461). A mass grave in the main plaza, and bodies in a burial shaft covered in ash were dated to around the collapse and showed signs of violence, some of the bodies still had large flint knives in their chests or pelvises, suggesting ritualized sacrifice. Smashed vessels litter the floors of the Y-45a complex that date to around A.D. 1270‚Äì1400, prior to the documented collapse of Mayapan. A vessel bearing the glyph K‚Äôatun 8 Ahua was found on the floor of this complex. From this they have posited that the complex was abandoned finally when the city fell (Lope 2006; Milbrath 2003). After A.D. 1461 there is little evidence of altars and burial cists being constructed after 1461, suggesting that the site had been abandoned by this point (Lope 2006). Very little evidence has been found to support later usage of Mayapan. Copal from an altar was found in the Templo Redondo compound that may suggest later pilgrimages to the Castillo de Kukulkan. However, these samples date to the industrial era and may not be valid, so any assumptions based on this evidence would also not be valid (Lope 2006:168).

It forms the arrangement of five units in the pattern corresponding to the five-spot on six-sided dice, playing cards, and dominoes. It is represented in Unicode as or (for the die pattern) . Historical origins of the name quincunx coin Portuguese shield The quincunx was originally a coin issued by the Roman Republic c. 211-200 BC, whose value was five twelfths (quinque and uncia) of an as, the Roman standard bronze coin. On the Roman quincunx coins, the value was sometimes indicated by a pattern of five dots or pellets. However, these dots were not always arranged in a quincunx pattern. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) dates the first appearances of the Latin word in English as 1545 and 1574 (\\"in the sense 'five-twelfths of a pound or as). The first citation for the geometric meaning, as \\"a pattern used for planting trees\\", dates from 1606. The OED also cites a 1647 reference to the German astronomer Kepler for an astronomical/astrological meaning, an angle of 5/12 of a whole circle. states that the word refers to the pattern of trees in an orchard, but then uses it more abstractly for a version of the orchard-planting problem involving patterns of points and lines in the plane (for which the quincunx pattern provides the optimal solution for five points).. Examples Quincunx patterns occur in many contexts: The flag of the Solomon Islands features a quincunx of stars. A quincuncial map Cosmatesque pavements with the quincunx pattern Pump It Up dance pads with tiles arranged quincuncially * In heraldry, groups of five elements (charges) are often arranged in a quincunx pattern, called in saltire in heraldic terminology. The flag of the Solomon Islands features this pattern, with its five stars representing the five main island groups in the Solomon Islands. Another instance of this pattern occurred in the flag of the 19th-century Republic of Yucat√°n, where it signified the five departments into which the republic was divided. * A quincunx is a standard pattern for planting an orchard.. * Francis Galton's \\"quincunx\\" (referred to later as a \\"bean machine\\") is a physical demonstration of how the central limit theorem leads to a normal distribution; its pins are laid out in a quincunx pattern. * Quincunxes are used in modern computer graphics as a pattern for multisample anti-aliasing. Quincunx antialiasing samples scenes at the corners and centers of each pixel. These five sample points, in the shape of a quincunx, are combined to produce each displayed pixel. However, samples at the corner points are shared with adjacent pixels, so the number of samples needed is only twice the number of displayed pixels.. * In numerical analysis, the quincunx pattern describes the two-dimensional five-point stencil, a sampling pattern used to derive finite difference approximations to derivatives.. * In architecture, a quincuncial plan, also defined as a \\"cross-in-square\\", is the plan of an edifice composed of nine bays. The central and the four angular ones are covered with domes or groin vaults so that the pattern of these domes forms a quincunx; the other four bays are surmounted by barrel vaults.R. Krautheimer, Early Christian and Byzantine Architecture, 1965 In Khmer architecture, the towers of a temple, such as Angkor Wat, are sometimes arranged in a quincunx to represent the five peaks of Mount Meru.Angkor Wat : Image of the Day * A quincunx is one of the quintessential designs of Cosmatesque inlay stonework.. * A quincuncial map is a conformal map projection that maps the poles of the sphere to the centre and four corners of a square, thus forming a quincunx. * The points on each face of a unit cell of a face-centred cubic lattice form a quincunx. * The quincunx as a tattoo is known as the five dots tattoo. It has been variously interpreted as a fertility symbol,. a reminder of sayings on how to treat women or police, a recognition symbol among the Romani people,. a group of close friends,. standing alone in the world,. or time spent in prison (with the outer four dots representing the prison walls and the inner dot representing the prisoner).. Thomas Edison, whose many inventions included an electric pen which later became the basis of a tattooing machine created by Samuel O'Reilly, had this pattern tattooed on his forearm.. * The first two stages of the Saturn V super heavy-lift rocket had engines in a quincunx arrangement.. * A baseball diamond forms a quincunx with the four bases and the pitcher's mound.. See in particular p. 62. * Early African American scientist Benjamin Banneker describes a dream in which he is asked to measure the shape of the soul after death. The answer is \\"quincunx\\". Research locates his ancestry in Senegal, where the quincunx is a common religious symbol. Literary symbolism Various literary works use or refer to the quincunx pattern for its symbolic value: * The English physician Sir Thomas Browne in his philosophical discourse The Garden of Cyrus (1658) elaborates upon evidence of the quincunx pattern in art, nature and mystically as evidence of \\"the wisdom of God\\". Although Browne wrote about quincunx in its geometric meaning, he may have been influenced by English astrology, as the astrological meaning of \\"quincunx\\" (unrelated to the pattern) was introduced by the astronomer Kepler in 1604. * James Joyce uses the term in \\"Grace\\", a short story in Dubliners of 1914, to describe the seating arrangement of five men in a church service. Lobner; for additional work on this instance of the quincunx pattern, see . argues that in this context the pattern serves as a symbol both of the wounds of Christ and of the Greek cross. * Lawrence Durrell's novel sequence The Avignon Quintet is arranged in the form of a quincunx, according to the author; the final novel in the sequence is called Quinx, the plot of which includes the discovery of a quincunx of stones.. * The Quincunx is the title of a lengthy and elaborate novel by Charles Palliser set in 19th-century England, published in 1989; the pattern appears in the text as a heraldic device, and is also reflected in the structure of the book.. * In the first chapter of The Rings of Saturn, W. G. Sebald's narrator cites Browne's writing on the quincunx. The quincunx in turn becomes a model for the way in which the rest of the novel unfolds.. * S√©amus Heaney describes Ireland's historical provinces as together forming a quincunx, as the Irish word for province c√∫ige (literally: \\"fifth part\\") also explicates. The five provinces of Ireland were Ulster (north), Leinster (east), Connacht (west), Munster (south) and Meath (center, and now a county within Leinster). More specifically, in his essay Frontiers of Writing, Heaney creates an image of five towers forming a quincunx pattern within Ireland, one tower for each of the five provinces, each having literary significance...

The term, originated in 1973 by Butler Lampson, is defined as channels \\"not intended for information transfer at all, such as the service program's effect on system load,\\" to distinguish it from legitimate channels that are subjected to access controls by COMPUSEC.Lampson, B.W., A Note on the Confinement Problem. Communications of the ACM, Oct.1973.16(10):p. 613-615. Characteristics A covert channel is so called because it is hidden from the access control mechanisms of secure operating systems since it does not use the legitimate data transfer mechanisms of the computer system (typically, read and write), and therefore cannot be detected or controlled by the security mechanisms that underlie secure operating systems. Covert channels are exceedingly hard to install in real systems, and can often be detected by monitoring system performance. In addition, they suffer from a low signal-to- noise ratio and low data rates (typically, on the order of a few bits per second). They can also be removed manually with a high degree of assurance from secure systems by well established covert channel analysis strategies. Covert channels are distinct from, and often confused with, legitimate channel exploitations that attack low-assurance pseudo-secure systems using schemes such as steganography or even less sophisticated schemes to disguise prohibited objects inside of legitimate information objects. The legitimate channel misuse by steganography is specifically not a form of covert channel. Covert channels can tunnel through secure operating systems and require special measures to control. Covert channel analysis is the only proven way to control covert channels. By contrast, secure operating systems can easily prevent misuse of legitimate channels, so distinguishing both is important. Analysis of legitimate channels for hidden objects is often misrepresented as the only successful countermeasure for legitimate channel misuse. Because this amounts to analysis of large amounts of software, it was shown as early as 1972 to be impractical.Computer Security Technology Planning Study (James P. Anderson, 1972) Without being informed of this, some are misled to believe an analysis will \\"manage the risk\\" of these legitimate channels. =TCSEC criteria= The Trusted Computer Security Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) was a set of criteria, now deprecated, that had been established by the National Computer Security Center, an agency managed by the United States' National Security Agency. Lampson's definition of a covert channel was paraphrased in the TCSECNCSC-TG-030, Covert Channel Analysis of Trusted Systems (Light Pink Book), 1993 from the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Rainbow Series publications. specifically to refer to ways of transferring information from a higher classification compartment to a lower classification. In a shared processing environment, it is difficult to completely insulate one process from the effects another process can have on the operating environment. A covert channel is created by a sender process that modulates some condition (such as free space, availability of some service, wait time to execute) that can be detected by a receiving process. The TCSEC defines two kinds of covert channels: *Storage channels - Communicate by modifying a \\"storage location\\", such as a hard drive. *Timing channels - Perform operations that affect the \\"real response time observed\\" by the receiver. The TCSEC, also known as the Orange Book,5200.28-STD, Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (Orange Book), 1985 from the DoD Rainbow Series publications. requires analysis of covert storage channels to be classified as a B2 system and analysis of covert timing channels is a requirement for class B3.  Timing Channels  The use of delays between packets transmitted over computer networks was first explored by Girling for covert communication. This work motivated many other works to establish or detect a covert communication and analyze the fundamental limitations of such scenarios. Identifying covert channels Ordinary things, such as existence of a file or time used for a computation, have been the medium through which a covert channel communicates. Covert channels are not easy to find because these media are so numerous and frequently used. Two relatively old techniques remain the standards for locating potential covert channels. One works by analyzing the resources of a system and other works at the source-code level. Eliminating covert channels The possibility of covert channels cannot be completely eliminated, although it can be significantly reduced by careful design and analysis. The detection of a covert channel can be made more difficult by using characteristics of the communications medium for the legitimate channel that are never controlled or examined by legitimate users. For example, a file can be opened and closed by a program in a specific, timed pattern that can be detected by another program, and the pattern can be interpreted as a string of bits, forming a covert channel. Since it is unlikely that legitimate users will check for patterns of file opening and closing operations, this type of covert channel can remain undetected for long periods. A similar case is port knocking. In usual communications the timing of requests is irrelevant and unwatched. Port knocking makes it significant. Data hiding in OSI model Handel and Sandford presented research where they study covert channels within the general design of network communication protocols.Hiding data in the OSI network model , Theodore G. Handel and Maxwell T. Sandford II (2005) They employ the OSI model as a basis for their development in which they characterize system elements having potential to be used for data hiding. The adopted approach has advantages over these because standards opposed to specific network environments or architectures are considered. Their study does not aim to present foolproof steganographic schemes. Rather, they establish basic principles for data hiding in each of seven OSI layers. Besides suggesting the use of the reserved fields of protocols headers (that are easily detectable) at higher network layers, they also propose the possibility of timing channels involving CSMA/CD manipulation at the physical layer. Their work identifies covert channel merit such as: * Detectability: Covert channel must be measurable by the intended recipient only. * Indistinguishability: Covert channel must lack identification. * Bandwidth: number of data hiding bits per channel use. Their covert channel analysis does not consider issues such as interoperability of these data hiding techniques with other network nodes, covert channel capacity estimation, effect of data hiding on the network in terms of complexity and compatibility. Moreover, the generality of the techniques cannot be fully justified in practice since the OSI model does not exist per se in functional systems. Data hiding in LAN environment by covert channels As Girling first analyzes covert channels in a network environment. His work focuses on local area networks (LANs) in which three obvious covert channels (two storage channel and one timing channel) are identified. This demonstrates the real examples of bandwidth possibilities for simple covert channels in LANs. For a specific LAN environment, the author introduced the notion of a wiretapper who monitors the activities of a specific transmitter on LAN. The covertly communicating parties are the transmitter and the wiretapper. The covert information according to Girling can be communicated through any of following obvious ways: # By observing the addresses as approached by the transmitter. If total number of addresses a sender can approach is 16, then there is a possibility of secret communication having 4 bits for the secret message. The author termed this possibility as covert storage channel as it depends in what is sent (i.e., which address is approached by the sender). # In the same way, the other obvious storage covert channel would depend on the size of the frame sent by the sender. For the 256 possible sizes, the amount of covert information deciphered from one size of the frame would be of 8 bits. Again this scenario was termed as the covert storage channel. # The third scenario presented uses the presence or absence of messages. For instance, ‚Äú0‚Äù for an odd message time interval, ‚Äú1‚Äù for even. The scenario transmits covert information through a \\"when-is-sent‚Äù strategy therefore termed as timing covert channel. The time to transmit a block of data is calculated as function of software processing time, network speed, network block sizes and protocol overhead. Assuming block of various sizes are transmitted on the LAN, software overhead is computed on average and novel time evaluation is used to estimate the bandwidth (capacity) of covert channels are also presented. The work paves the way for future research. Data hiding in TCP/IP Protocol suite by covert channels Focusing on the IP and TCP headers of TCP/IP Protocol suite, an article published by Craig Rowland devises proper encoding and decoding techniques by utilizing the IP identification field, the TCP initial sequence number and acknowledge sequence number fields. Covert Channels in the TCP/IP Protocol Suite , 1996 Paper by Craig Rowland on covert channels in the TCP/IP protocol with proof of concept code. These techniques are implemented in a simple utility written for Linux systems running version 2.0 kernels. Rowland provides a proof of concept as well as practical encoding and decoding techniques for exploitation of covert channels using the TCP/IP protocol suite. These techniques are analyzed considering security mechanisms like firewall network address translation. However, the non-detectability of these covert communication techniques is questionable. For instance, a case where sequence number field of TCP header is manipulated, the encoding scheme is adopted such that every time the same alphabet is covertly communicated, it is encoded with the same sequence number. Moreover, the usages of sequence number field as well as the acknowledgment field cannot be made specific to the ASCII coding of English language alphabet as proposed, since both fields take into account the receipt of data bytes pertaining to specific network packet(s). After Rowland, several authors in academia published more work on covert channels in the TCP/IP protocol suite, including a plethora of countermeasures ranging from statistical approaches to machine learning. The research on network covert channels overlaps with the domain of network steganography, which emerged later.

Functional predicates are also sometimes called mappings, but that term has other meanings as well. In a model, a function symbol will be modelled by a function. Specifically, the symbol F in a formal language is a functional symbol if, given any symbol X representing an object in the language, F(X) is again a symbol representing an object in that language. In typed logic, F is a functional symbol with domain type T and codomain type U if, given any symbol X representing an object of type T, F(X) is a symbol representing an object of type U. One can similarly define function symbols of more than one variable, analogous to functions of more than one variable; a function symbol in zero variables is simply a constant symbol. Now consider a model of the formal language, with the types T and U modelled by sets [T] and [U] and each symbol X of type T modelled by an element [X] in [T]. Then F can be modelled by the set :[F]:=\\\\big\\\\\\\\{([X],[F(X)]):[X]\\\\in[\\\\mathbf{T}]\\\\big\\\\\\\\}, which is simply a function with domain [T] and codomain [U]. It is a requirement of a consistent model that [F(X)] = [F(Y)] whenever [X] = [Y]. Introducing new function symbols In a treatment of predicate logic that allows one to introduce new predicate symbols, one will also want to be able to introduce new function symbols. Given the function symbols F and G, one can introduce a new function symbol F ‚àò G, the composition of F and G, satisfying (F ‚àò G)(X) = F(G(X)), for all X. Of course, the right side of this equation doesn't make sense in typed logic unless the domain type of F matches the codomain type of G, so this is required for the composition to be defined. One also gets certain function symbols automatically. In untyped logic, there is an identity predicate id that satisfies id(X) = X for all X. In typed logic, given any type T, there is an identity predicate idT with domain and codomain type T; it satisfies idT(X) = X for all X of type T. Similarly, if T is a subtype of U, then there is an inclusion predicate of domain type T and codomain type U that satisfies the same equation; there are additional function symbols associated with other ways of constructing new types out of old ones. Additionally, one can define functional predicates after proving an appropriate theorem. (If you're working in a formal system that doesn't allow you to introduce new symbols after proving theorems, then you will have to use relation symbols to get around this, as in the next section.) Specifically, if you can prove that for every X (or every X of a certain type), there exists a unique Y satisfying some condition P, then you can introduce a function symbol F to indicate this. Note that P will itself be a relational predicate involving both X and Y. So if there is such a predicate P and a theorem: : For all X of type T, for some unique Y of type U, P(X,Y), then you can introduce a function symbol F of domain type T and codomain type U that satisfies: : For all X of type T, for all Y of type U, P(X,Y) if and only if Y = F(X). Doing without functional predicates Many treatments of predicate logic don't allow functional predicates, only relational predicates. This is useful, for example, in the context of proving metalogical theorems (such as G√∂del's incompleteness theorems), where one doesn't want to allow the introduction of new functional symbols (nor any other new symbols, for that matter). But there is a method of replacing functional symbols with relational symbols wherever the former may occur; furthermore, this is algorithmic and thus suitable for applying most metalogical theorems to the result. Specifically, if F has domain type T and codomain type U, then it can be replaced with a predicate P of type (T,U). Intuitively, P(X,Y) means F(X) = Y. Then whenever F(X) would appear in a statement, you can replace it with a new symbol Y of type U and include another statement P(X,Y). To be able to make the same deductions, you need an additional proposition: : For all X of type T, for some unique Y of type U, P(X,Y). (Of course, this is the same proposition that had to be proved as a theorem before introducing a new function symbol in the previous section.) Because the elimination of functional predicates is both convenient for some purposes and possible, many treatments of formal logic do not deal explicitly with function symbols but instead use only relation symbols; another way to think of this is that a functional predicate is a special kind of predicate, specifically one that satisfies the proposition above. This may seem to be a problem if you wish to specify a proposition schema that applies only to functional predicates F; how do you know ahead of time whether it satisfies that condition? To get an equivalent formulation of the schema, first replace anything of the form F(X) with a new variable Y. Then universally quantify over each Y immediately after the corresponding X is introduced (that is, after X is quantified over, or at the beginning of the statement if X is free), and guard the quantification with P(X,Y). Finally, make the entire statement a material consequence of the uniqueness condition for a functional predicate above. Let us take as an example the axiom schema of replacement in Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory. (This example uses mathematical symbols.) This schema states (in one form), for any functional predicate F in one variable: :\\\\forall A, \\\\exists B, \\\\forall C, C \\\\in A \\\\rightarrow F(C)\\\\in B. First, we must replace F(C) with some other variable D: :\\\\forall A, \\\\exists B, \\\\forall C, C \\\\in A\\\\rightarrow D \\\\in B. Of course, this statement isn't correct; D must be quantified over just after C: :\\\\forall A, \\\\exists B, \\\\forall C, \\\\forall D, C \\\\in A \\\\rightarrow D\\\\in B. We still must introduce P to guard this quantification: :\\\\forall A, \\\\exists B, \\\\forall C, \\\\forall D, P(C,D) \\\\rightarrow (C \\\\in A \\\\rightarrow D \\\\in B). This is almost correct, but it applies to too many predicates; what we actually want is: :(\\\\forall X, \\\\exists ! Y, P(X,Y))\\\\rightarrow (\\\\forall A, \\\\exists B, \\\\forall C, \\\\forall D, P(C,D)\\\\rightarrow (C \\\\in A \\\\rightarrow D \\\\in B)). This version of the axiom schema of replacement is now suitable for use in a formal language that doesn't allow the introduction of new function symbols. Alternatively, one may interpret the original statement as a statement in such a formal language; it was merely an abbreviation for the statement produced at the end.

Flavorings or seasonings, such as salt, herbs, seeds, or cheese, may be added to the dough or sprinkled on top before baking. Crackers are often branded as a nutritious and convenient way to consume a staple food or cereal grain. Reproduction of 19th-century hardtack, in the Army (square) and Navy (round) styles Crackers can be eaten on their own, but can also accompany other food items such as cheese or meat slices, dips, or soft spreads such as jam, butter, or peanut butter. Bland or mild crackers are sometimes used as a palate cleanser in food product testing or flavor testing, between samples. Crackers may also be crumbled and added to soup. The modern cracker is somewhat similar to nautical ship's biscuits, military hardtack, chacknels, and sacramental bread. Other early versions of the cracker can be found in ancient flatbreads, such as lavash, pita, matzo, flatbr√∏d, and crisp bread. Asian analogues include papadum and senbei. Names In American English, the name \\"cracker\\" usually refers to savory or salty flat biscuits, whereas the term \\"cookie\\" is used for sweet items. Crackers are also generally made differently: crackers are made by layering dough, while cookies, besides the addition of sugar, usually use a chemical leavening agent, may contain eggs, and in other ways are made more like a cake. In British English, crackers are sometimes called water biscuits, or savoury biscuits. Types Crackers come in many shapes and sizes, such as round, rectangular, triangular, or irregular. Crackers sometimes have cheese or spices as ingredients, or even chicken stock. Saltines and oyster crackers are often used in or served with soup. Additional types of crackers include cream crackers and water biscuits. Cheese crackers are prepared using cheese as a main ingredient. Commercial examples include Cheez-It, Cheese Nips and Goldfish. Graham crackers and digestive biscuits are also treated more like cookies than crackers, although they were both invented for their supposed health benefits, and graham crackers are sweet. Mock apple pie is made using Ritz (or similar) crackers. The characteristic holes found in many crackers are called \\"docking\\" holes. The holes are poked in the dough to stop overly large air pockets from forming in the cracker while baking. Brands Cracker brands include Bremner Wafers, Captain's Wafers, Cheese Nips, Club Crackers, Handi-Snacks, In a Biskit, Town House crackers, Ritz Crackers, Stoned Wheat Thins, Triscuit, TUC and Wheat Thins, among others. Such crackers are sometimes spread with cheese, p√¢t√©, or mousse.

Except for short periods when other musicians joined briefly, the band has had a relatively stable line-up consisting of Charlotte Caffey on lead guitar and keyboards, Belinda Carlisle on lead vocals, Gina Schock on drums, Kathy Valentine on bass guitar, and Jane Wiedlin on rhythm guitar. The Go-Go's rose to fame during the early 1980s. The band is the first all-female band that both wrote their own songs and played their own instruments to top the Billboard album charts. The band's 1981 debut album, Beauty and the Beat, is considered one of the \\"cornerstone albums of US new wave\\" (AllMusic), breaking barriers and paving the way for a host of other new American acts. When the album was released, it steadily climbed the Billboard 200 chart, ultimately reaching No. 1 and remaining there for six consecutive weeks. The album sold over two million copies, making it one of the most successful debut albums of all time, and the group was nominated for the Best New Artist award at the 24th Annual Grammy Awards. Four of the band's singles--\\"Our Lips Are Sealed\\", \\"We Got the Beat\\", \\"Vacation\\", and \\"Head over Heels\\"‚Äîhave reached the Top 20 in the U.S. charts. The Go-Go's have sold over seven million records worldwide. The Go-Go's broke up in 1985 but reconvened several times through the 1990s and beyond, recording new material and touring. Though the band's 2016 performances were billed as a farewell tour, the band remains active on an ad hoc basis. Head Over Heels, a musical featuring the songs of the Go- Go's, ran on Broadway at the Hudson Theatre from July 26, 2018 to January 6, 2019. History =Original incarnation (1978‚Äì1980)= Formed in Los Angeles in 1978, the Go-Go's initially consisted of Belinda Carlisle (vocals), Jane Wiedlin (guitar, background vocals), Margot Olavarria (bass), and Elissa Bello (drums).White, S. (2016). The Go-Go's: A YinPop Guide. Fly-By-Night Books, They were formed as a punk band and had roots in the L.A. punk community.Hudak, Joseph. (June 22, 2012) The Go-Go's Biography . Rolling Stone. Retrieved 2015-09-14. They shared a rehearsal space with the Motels and Carlisle, under the name \\"Dottie Danger\\", had briefly been a member of punk rock band the Germs. After she became temporarily ill, she left the Germs before playing a gig. The band began playing gigs at punk venues such as The Masque and the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles and the Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco alongside bands such as X, Fear, the Plugz and the Controllers. Charlotte Caffey (lead guitar, keyboards, background vocals) was added later in 1978, and in the summer of 1979, Gina Schock replaced Bello on drums. With these lineup changes, the group began moving towards their more-familiar power pop sound. The group frequently met at a Denny's on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, and it was there that they chose the band's name. During late 1979, the band recorded a five-song demo at Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles, and in 1980, they supported the British ska revival groups Madness and The Specials in both Los Angeles and England. The Go-Go's subsequently spent half of 1980 touring England, earning a sizable following and releasing the demo version of \\"We Got the Beat\\" on Stiff Records, which became a minor UK hit. In December 1980, original bassist Olavarria fell ill with hepatitis A and was replaced with Kathy Valentine, who had played guitar in bands such as Girlschool and the Textones. Valentine had not previously played bass guitar. Carlisle also related in her autobiography, Lips Unsealed, that according to the band's view, another reason for Olavarria's dismissal from the Go-Go's was that she frequently missed rehearsals, due largely to her dissatisfaction with the band's move away from punk and toward pop. In late 1982, Olavarria sued the remaining members of the band for wrongful removal. The suit was settled in 1984. Olavarria later joined Martin Atkins' band Brian Brain. =Career peak (1981‚Äì1983)= The Go-Go's signed to I.R.S. Records in April 1981. The following year, they toured with The Police on the Ghost in the Machine Tour. Their debut album, Beauty and the Beat, was a surprise hit: it topped the U.S. charts for six weeks in 1982 and eventually received a double platinum certification. The album was also a success outside the U.S. charting at No. 2 in Canada, where it received a platinum certification, and No. 27 in Australia. In 2003, the album was ranked No. 413 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. \\"Our Lips Are Sealed\\" and a new version of \\"We Got the Beat\\" were popular singles in North America in early 1982. During this period, the Go-Go's started building a fanbase.Belinda Carlisle - Voila In 1982, the group was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist.White, S. (2016). The Go-Go's: A YinPop Guide. Fly-By-Night Books, p. 21, http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1982/grammys.htm The follow-up album, Vacation, received mixed reviews and sold less than Beauty and the Beat. However, the album was certified gold in the U.S. and spawned another top 10 US hit with the title track. Other singles released from the album were \\"Get Up and Go\\" and \\"This Old Feeling\\", neither of which made it into the Top 40. In 1983, Vacation was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Packaging. During the album's promotion, the group went on hiatus when Schock underwent surgery for a congenital heart defect. =Talk Show and initial breakup (1984‚Äì1985)= In 1984, the group returned with the Martin Rushent-produced album Talk Show. The album tracks \\"Head over Heels\\" and \\"Turn to You\\" were both Top 40 hits in the US. Despite the favorable reception, the album sold less than the previous two, not reaching the top 10 and not receiving any certification. Personality conflicts and creative differences within the group were also taking a toll, as were drug addiction problems for some band members. Wiedlin announced her departure from the group in October 1984. The band sought a replacement, selecting Paula Jean Brown (of Giant Sand) as their new bass guitarist, with Valentine moving to rhythm guitar. This lineup debuted at the 1985 Rock in Rio festival, playing two shows, but Carlisle and Caffey soon realized their hearts were no longer in the group and decided to disband the Go-Go's in May 1985. =Reunions (1990‚Äì1994)= In 1990, the Go- Go's classic lineup (Caffey, Carlisle, Schock, Valentine and Wiedlin) reunited to play a benefit concert for the California Environmental Protection Act, a 1990 ballot initiative. The band also entered the studio with producer David Z to re-record a cover of \\"Cool Jerk\\" for a greatest hits compilation. In 1994, the same lineup got together again to release a two-disc retrospective entitled Return to the Valley of The Go-Go's, featuring three new recordings. The single \\"The Whole World Lost Its Head\\" peaked at No. 21 on the Billboard Modern Rock charts and \\"bubbled under\\" on the US charts at No. 108, but became the band's first and only Top 40 hit in the UK, peaking at No. 29. The band toured again to promote the release; ex-Bangle Vicki Peterson stood in on several dates for Caffey, who was pregnant. =Schock lawsuit (1997‚Äì1999)= In 1997, Schock sued the other members of the group, claiming that she had not been properly paid for her contributions since 1986 and that a songwriting agreement with Caffey had been breached. The suit was resolved by 1999 when the band reunited for a brief tour. =Touring and God Bless the Go-Go's (1999‚Äì2009)= The Go-Go's toured regularly from 1999 onward. In 2001, the band (still with the \\"classic\\" lineup) released an album of new material, God Bless the Go-Go's. Green Day's lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong co-wrote the only released single, \\"Unforgiven\\", which peaked at No. 22 on Billboard's Adult Top 40 chart. The album was well received by critics and peaked at number No. 57 in the Billboard 200 chart. Also in 2001, the Go-Go's, along with artists Elton John, Billy Joel, David Crosby and Paul Simon, performed at the concert \\"An All-Star Tribute to Brian Wilson\\" at Radio City Music Hall, hosted by the TNT network.

After 2010, the idea of a farewell tour seemed to have been abandoned, with the Go-Go's touring frequently. In 2011, the Go-Go's announced the \\"Ladies Gone Wild\\" tour to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the release of Beauty and the Beat. On August 11, 2011, the band received the 2,444th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at the site where punk rock club The Masque used to stand. They subsequently toured the US in 2012, with Abby Travis subbing for an injured Valentine during the latter part of the tour. =Departure of Kathy Valentine and lawsuit (2013‚Äì2015)= On March 8, 2013, the group's official website said \\"irreconcilable differences\\" had led to the departure of bassist Valentine. On May 24, Valentine sued her former bandmates for \\"breach of fiduciary duty and abuse of control...in an attempt to deprive [her] of her position and interest in the group, including her right to receive her full one-fifth, 20% share of the benefits and revenues generated by the group substantial reputation, fame, and goodwill.\\" Officially a quartet (Caffey, Carlisle, Schock, Wiedlin), the Go-Go's continued on, playing a series of tour dates in 2013 and 2014, including several double bills with the B-52's. In 2014, the band was inducted in the Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame.Hall of Fame . Hollywood Bowl. Retrieved September 14, 2015. That same year, the lawsuit that Valentine brought against her former bandmates was settled out of court. =Another farewell tour, return of Valentine (2016‚Äìpresent)= On March 21, 2016, plans for a Go-Go's farewell tour (minus Valentine) were officially announced. A band statement said: \\"After a 38-year run, we are gearing up for one last blast of a summer tour\\". Valentine rejoined the band to perform their first show together as a quintet in six years at New York's Bowery Ballroom on January 31, 2018, to announce the Broadway dates of their new musical, Head Over Heels. The new musical‚Äîwhich premiered at New York's Hudson Theatre in the summer of 2018‚Äîfeatures the band's hits (including \\"Get Up and Go\\" and \\"Lust to Love\\") as well as Carlisle's solo hits \\"Mad About You\\" and \\"Heaven Is a Place on Earth.\\" The musical had a preview at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2015. In 2020, a documentary movie about the band premiered at Sundance, directed by Allison Ellwood after the band saw her work on the 2013 History of the Eagles documentary. In the US, the movie was seen on television on Showtime. The documentary features the formation and rise of the band through the 1980s breakup, skipping the lawsuits and reunions through the 1990s-2010s, ending with a 2019 reunion. On July 31, 2020, the Go-Go's released their first new song in 19 years, \\"Club Zero,\\" which is featured in the documentary. =Solo careers= * Belinda Carlisle became the most commercially successful solo artist of the band's alumnae, scoring a string of mainstream pop singles in the mid and late '80s, including the No. 3 US hit \\"Mad About You\\" (co-written by Paula Jean Brown) and \\"Heaven Is a Place on Earth\\", a No. 1 hit in the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere which became her signature song. She followed up \\"Heaven Is a Place on Earth\\" with \\"I Get Weak\\", which peaked at No. 2 in the U.S. In the UK and Europe, Carlisle became even more successful, continuing to score top 10 hits through the mid '90s; she racked up 19 top 40 hits in the UK between 1987 and 1997. In August 2001, Carlisle appeared in a nude layout, including a cover photo, in that month's issue of Playboy magazine. In 2007, she released a French-language album titled Voila. She also appeared as a judge on the MTV show Rock the Cradle and toured during the summer of 2008 as part of the Regeneration Tour with the Human League, A Flock of Seagulls, ABC and Naked Eyes. Carlisle appeared on Dancing with the Stars on ABC in 2009, and starred in London's West End production of the musical Hairspray. She wrote a memoir, Lips Unsealed, that was published in June 2010. In March 2013, Carlisle released her first U.S. single in 17 years, titled \\"Sun\\". Carlisle's eighth studio album, a selection of Gurmukhi chants titled Wilder Shores, was released in September 2017. * Jane Wiedlin released several solo albums including Fur, which featured a successful single, \\"Rush Hour\\". Wiedlin also took acting roles in movies, including Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Clue and Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, as well as doing cartoon voiceovers and a 2005 appearance on the VH1 show Surreal Life. In 1995, Wiedlin formed a band called froSTed (the capital ST paid homage to Star Trek), which released an album, Cold, before disbanding in 1998. In 2000, Wiedlin started her own label, Painful Discs, to release her solo album Kissproof World. * Charlotte Caffey worked as a songwriter and session musician for Carlisle. In 1988, she formed a band called the Graces that released the album Perfect View. After the Graces disbanded, she briefly formed a group called Astrid's Mother. Anna Waronker and Caffey co-wrote \\"Ordinary Girl\\", the theme song to the television series Clueless (61 episodes, 1996‚Äì1999). Caffey and Wiedlin co-wrote \\"But for the Grace of God\\" (2000) for Keith Urban, which was their first No. 1 single on the charts. Caffey and Waronker also wrote the music for the rock opera Lovelace: A Rock Opera based on the life of porn star Linda Lovelace, which premiered in Los Angeles in October 2008. * Gina Schock released a self-titled album in 1988 with her band House of Schock, and she later formed the short- lived group K-Five. Schock co-wrote the title track for Miley Cyrus's sophomore CD, Breakout, which debuted at No. 1 on the US Billboard 200 Charts in the summer of 2008. Schock also co-wrote several tracks on the 2009 debut album Kiss & Tell by Selena Gomez & the Scene. * Kathy Valentine returned to her blues-rock roots playing lead guitar with the BlueBonnets, which morphed into the Delphines with Dominique Davalos on lead vocals and bass. The Delphines released two CDs, The Delphines (1996) and Cosmic Speed (2001). Valentine released a debut solo CD, titled Light Years, in September 2005. In 2006, she relocated to Austin, Texas, and produced a local female trio, Adrian and the Sickness, whose album BFD was released in 2009. Valentine reformed the BlueBonnets, releasing two albums with them, Boom Boom Boom Boom (2010) and Play Loud (2014). In 2018 Valentine reunited with the Textones, her pre-Go- Go's band, and played guitar on their Old Stone Gang album. = Member timeline = Discography Studio albums: *Beauty and the Beat (1981) *Vacation (1982) *Talk Show (1984) *God Bless the Go-Go's (2001) Videos: * Totally Go-Go's ‚Äì live December 1981 (1982) * Wild at the Greek ‚Äì live concert (1984) * Prime Time ‚Äì music video compilation (1985) * Live in Central Park ‚Äì live concert (2001) Bibliography * The Go-Go's: A YinPop Guide by S.

His appearance and clothing contrast noticeably with Bert, as he is the shorter and stouter of the pair, wears a shirt with horizontal stripes as opposed to Bert's vertical ones, and has a head that is wider than it is high. In addition, Ernie has no visible eyebrows, while Bert displays a unibrow. Ernie is well known for his fondness for baths with his Rubber Duckie, and for trying to learn to play the saxophone. Ernie is also known for keeping Bert awake at night, for reasons such as wanting to play the drums, wanting to count something (like sheep), to observe something like a blackout, or even because he is waiting for his upstairs neighbor to drop his shoes. Appearances =Sesame Street= Many Ernie and Bert sketches involve Ernie wanting to play a game with Bert, who would much rather do something else (like read). Ernie keeps irking Bert with the game until Bert joins ‚Äî and usually, by the time Bert starts enjoying the game, Ernie is tired of playing the game and wants to do something else. Other sketches have involved them sharing some food by dividing it equally, only for one of them to have a bit more than the other, leading Ernie to make it even by eating the extra piece. Ernie makes appearances without Bert, usually within the framework of another double act. He has regularly appeared in skits with Grover, Cookie Monster, Sherlock Hemlock and Lefty the Salesman. =Journey to Ernie= From Season 33 (2002) until Season 36 (2005), he and Big Bird starred in a daily segment called \\"Journey to Ernie\\". Ernie was one of the hosts of the show Play with Me Sesame, where he was performed by John Tartaglia during the second season. One regular segment that he hosted was \\"Ernie Says\\", a variation of \\"Simon Says\\". Role in other projects Ernie sang about his affection for Rubber Duckie in a skit, which aired during the first season of Sesame Street. The song from that skit ‚Äì titled \\"Rubber Duckie\\" ‚Äì became a modest mainstream hit, reaching No. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 in September 1970.Whitburn, Joel, \\"Top Pop Singles: 1955‚Äì2006\\", 2007. Ernie has appeared in both of the Sesame Street movies. In Follow That Bird, he and Bert searched for Big Bird by plane. Ernie piloted the plane, and eventually, after they found Big Bird, he flew the plane upside-down, singing \\"Upside Down World\\". However, after they lost Big Bird, Ernie blamed Bert. Ernie and Bert also appeared in Out to Lunch, and were the host of this crossover special. In The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland, Ernie and Bert served as hosts, interrupting the movie whenever it looks like something bad is about to happen. Bert was worried about the bad bits, but Ernie reassured him by saying \\"Bert, nothing bad is going to happen!\\". Ernie reveals in Sesame Street Episode 257 that his favourite activities include watching parades, circuses and going to birthday parties. A typical Bert and Ernie skit has Ernie coming up with a harebrained idea, and Bert trying to talk him out of it ending with Bert losing his temper, while Ernie becomes oblivious to his own bad idea. Other sketches have involved Bert and Ernie sharing a snack by division, but finding that one of them has a bit more; Ernie humorously decides to try to make it even by eating the extra piece, which goes forth until the entire snack is all eaten up. Others have also involved Ernie eating part of Bert's snack he prepares for himself, and when Bert comes back from somewhere, Ernie tries to make several attempts to cover up the crime in front of Bert, which is not successful mostly. Some other plotlines involved Ernie wanting to play a game with Bert who wants to do something else; he continues playing until he gets Bert in, but when Bert finally wants to continue playing the game, Ernie is tired of playing, and wants to do something else. The age of Bert and Ernie is regularly discussed on forums. Nothing official has ever been said, but most consider the duo adults, as they do not appear to be highly dependent on others. One Sesame Street Live performer has commented that \\"I just kind of try to think like a six year old or a seven year old, because that's how old Bert is.\\"macon.com However, Bert's twin brother Bart is depicted as a traveling salesman, which would mean Bert (and probably Ernie) are both adults. Ernie also appeared in the finales of The Muppet Movie and The Muppets Take Manhattan, in the last of which he got a line. In Christmas Eve on Sesame Street, Ernie decided to buy Bert a cigar box to store his paper clips in. However, as he did not have any money, he traded his own Rubber Duckie for it. At the same time, Bert decided to get Ernie a soap dish to put his Rubber Duckie in, so that it wouldn't keep falling into the tub, but had to trade his paper clips for it. However, Mr. Hooper could tell that neither of them really wanted to give up their prized possessions, so Mr. Hooper gave them their things back as presents. Ernie and Bert introduced a montage of Sesame Street clips in The Muppets: A Celebration of 30 Years. Ernie also narrated a Christmas pageant, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, in A Muppet Family Christmas. In that same special, Ernie and Bert had a conversation with Doc, making them the only Sesame Street characters (not counting Kermit the Frog) to have interacted with Doc. In Sesame Street... 20 Years & Still Counting, he and Bert got a new video camera, and he talked Bert into using the camera to record footage of Sesame Street so that they could watch Sesame Street on television. Jim Henson's original Ernie puppet is currently on display at the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta, Georgia. Performing Ernie Ernie is a \\"Live Hand Muppet,\\" meaning that while operating the head of the puppet with his right hand, the puppeteer inserts his left hand into a T shaped sleeve, capped off with a glove that matches the fabric \\"skin\\" of the puppet, thus \\"becoming\\" the left arm of the puppet. A second puppeteer usually provides the right arm, although sometimes the right arm is simply stuffed and pinned to the puppet's chest or the second puppeteer will perform both arms. The original segment of the song \\"I Don't Want To Live On The Moon\\" was one of the rare instances when Ernie's full body was shown. It reportedly took three puppeteers to perform Ernie in this segment: Jim Henson performed Ernie's head and left hand, while two other puppeteers operated Ernie's right hand and feet respectively. Other puppets of this type include Cookie Monster, Fozzie Bear, Beaker, and Bunsen Honeydew. In other media =Theme parks= Ernie was one of the first characters to appear at Sesame Place theme park as a costumed character, in May 1983. (They had previously appeared at the attraction's groundbreaking event.) International Sesame Street is localized for some different markets, and Ernie is often renamed. For instance, in episodes that are aired in Portugal, Ernie's name has been changed to Egas, in Brazil, his name is √änio, in Spain, he is renamed \\"Epi\\", in Latin America, his name is \\"Enrique\\", on Egyptian Alam Simsim (Sesame World) Ernie's name is given as \\"Shadi\\" (rhyming with Bert's which is \\"Hadi\\"), in Russia, he also known as Yenik (–ï–Ω–∏–∫), in Turkey, he is named \\"Edi\\", in Israel, he is called \\"Arik\\" (◊ê◊®◊ô◊ß) and in Norway, he is known as \\"Erling\\".

Grenville was born into an influential political family and first entered Parliament in 1741 as an MP for Buckingham. He emerged as one of Cobham's Cubs, a group of young members of Parliament associated with Lord Cobham. In 1754 Grenville became Treasurer of the Navy, a position he held twice until 1761. In October 1761 he chose to stay in government and accepted the new role of Leader of the Commons causing a rift with his brother-in-law and political ally William Pitt who had resigned. Grenville was subsequently made Northern Secretary and First Lord of the Admiralty by the new Prime Minister Lord Bute. On 8 April 1763, Lord Bute resigned, and Grenville assumed his position as Prime Minister. His government tried to bring public spending under control and pursued an assertive foreign policy. His best-known policy is the Stamp Act, a long-standing tax in Great Britain which Grenville extended to the colonies in America, but which instigated widespread opposition in Britain's American colonies and was later repealed. Grenville had increasingly strained relations with his colleagues and the King and in 1765 he was dismissed by George III and replaced by Lord Rockingham. For the last five years of his life, Grenville led a group of his supporters in opposition and staged a public reconciliation with Pitt. Coat of arms of Grenville of Wotton Underwood, Buckinghamshire: Vert, on a cross argent five torteaux Early life George Grenville was born at Wotton House on 14 October 1712. He was the second son of Richard Grenville and Hester Temple (later the 1st Countess Temple). He was one of five brothers, all of whom became MPs. His sister Hester Grenville married the leading political figure William Pitt. His elder brother was Richard Grenville, later the 2nd Earl Temple. It was intended by his parents that George Grenville should become a lawyer.Lawson, p. 3. Grenville received his education at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, and was called to the bar in 1736. Politics =Loyalist= Stowe House, Buckinghamshire, the political base of the Cobham faction. In 1749 ownership of the estate passed to Grenville's brother Richard. He entered Parliament in 1741 as one of the two members for Buckingham, and continued to represent that borough for the next twenty-nine years until his death. He was disappointed to be giving up what appeared to be a promising legal career for the uncertainties of opposition politics.Lawson. In Parliament, he subscribed to the \\"Boy Patriot\\" party, which opposed Sir Robert Walpole. In particular he enjoyed the patronage of Lord Cobham, the leader of a faction that included George Grenville, his brother Richard, William Pitt and George Lyttelton that became known as Cobham's Cubs. =Joins Administration= In December 1744 he became a Lord of the Admiralty in the administration of Henry Pelham. He allied himself with his brother Richard and with William Pitt (who became their brother-in-law in 1754) in forcing Pelham to give them promotion by rebelling against his authority and obstructing business. In June 1747, Grenville became a Lord of the Treasury. In 1754 Grenville was made Treasurer of the Navy and Privy Councillor. Along with Pitt and several other colleagues he was dismissed in 1755 after speaking and voting against the government on a debate about a recent subsidy treaty with Russia which they believed was unnecessarily costly, and would drag Britain into Continental European disputes. Opposition to European entanglements was a cornerstone of Patriot Whig thinking. He and Pitt joined the opposition, haranguing the Newcastle government. Grenville and Pitt both championed the formation of a British militia to provide additional security rather than the deployment of Hessian mercenaries favoured by the government.Lawson, pp. 84‚Äì87. As the military situation deteriorated following the loss of Minorca, the government grew increasingly weak until it was forced to resign in Autumn 1756. In Government with Pitt =Treasurer of the Navy= Pitt then formed a government led by the Duke of Devonshire. Grenville was returned to his position as Treasurer of the Navy, which was a great disappointment as he had been expecting to receive the more prestigious and lucrative post of Paymaster of the Forces.Brown, p. 133. This added to what Grenville regarded as a series of earlier slights in which Pitt and others had passed him over for positions in favour of men he considered no more talented than he was. From then on Grenville felt a growing resentment towards Pitt, and grew closer to the young Prince of Wales and his advisor Lord Bute who were both now opposed to Pitt.Lawson, pp. 110‚Äì113. In 1758, as Treasurer of the Navy, he introduced and carried a bill which established a fairer system of paying the wages of seamen and supporting their families while they were at sea which was praised for its humanity if not for its effectiveness.Lawson, pp. 107‚Äì108. He remained in office during the years of British victories, notably the Annus Mirabilis of 1759 for which the credit went to the government of which he was a member. However his seven-year-old son died after a long illness and Grenville remained by his side at their country house in Wotton and rarely came to London.Lawson, pp. 108‚Äì109. In 1761, when Pitt resigned upon the question of the war with Spain, and subsequently functioned as Leader of the House of Commons in the administration of Lord Bute. Grenville's role was seen as an attempt to keep someone closely associated with Pitt involved in the government, in order to prevent Pitt and his supporters actively opposing the government. However, it soon led to conflict between Grenville and Pitt. Grenville was also seen as a suitable candidate because his reputation for honesty meant he commanded loyalty and respect amongst independent MPs.Anderson, pp. 487‚Äì488. =Northern Secretary= Lord Bute, Prime Minister between 1762 and 1763, under whom Grenville served and whom he later succeeded In May 1762, Grenville was appointed Northern Secretary, where he took an increasingly hard line in the negotiations with France and Spain designed to bring the Seven Years' War to a close.

In spite of this, Grenville had now become associated with Bute rather than his former political allies who were even more vocal in their opposition to the peace treaty than he was. In October he was made in First Lord of the Admiralty. Henry Fox took over as Leader of the Commons, and forced the peace treaty through parliament. Bute's position grew increasingly untenable as he was extremely unpopular, which led to him offering his resignation to George III on several occasions. With reluctance George III eventually accepted Bute's resignation and accepted that Grenville should be his successor, in spite of his personal dislike of him. In April 1763, Grenville became First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer succeeding Bute as first Minister after Henry Fox had rejected the job. Prime minister Grenville's first act was to prosecute John Wilkes for publishing in The North Briton newspaper an article deriding King' George III's speech made on 23 April 1763. Wilkes was prosecuted for \\"seditious libel\\" and, after a duel with a Grenville supporter Samuel Martin, fled to France. Wilkes was later elected and re-elected by the Middlesex constituency. He was continually refused admission to parliament by parliament, and proved a problem to several successive governments. As Britain was trying to recover from the costs of the Seven Years' War and now in dire need of finances for the British army in the American colonies, Grenville's most immediate task was to restore the nation's finances. He also had to deal with the fall-out from Pontiac's Rebellion, which erupted in North America in 1763. Prominent measures of his administration included the prosecution of John Wilkes and the passing of the American Stamp Act 1765, which led to the first symptoms of alienation between American colonies and Great Britain. =Stamp Act= Cartoon depicting the repeal of the Stamp Act as a funeral, with Grenville carrying a child's coffin marked \\"born 1765, died 1766\\" One of the more prominent measures of Grenville's administration occurred in March 1765 when Grenville authored the Stamp Act, enacted in November of that year. It was an exclusive tax placed on the colonies in America requiring that documents and newspapers be printed on stamped paper from London bearing an embossed revenue stamp that had to be paid for in British currency. It was met with general outrage and resulted in public acts of disobedience and rioting throughout the colonies in America.Marjie Bloy Ph.D., Senior Research Fellow National University of Singapore =Foreign policy= In disputes with Spain and France, Grenville managed to secure British objectives by deploying what was later described as gunboat diplomacy.Thomas, p. 114. During his administration Britain's international isolation increased, as Britain failed to secure alliances with other major European powers, a situation that subsequent governments were unable to reverse leading to Britain fighting several countries during the American War of Independence without a major ally. =Dismissal= The King made various attempts to induce Pitt to come to his rescue by forming a ministry, but without success, and at last had recourse to Lord Rockingham. When Rockingham agreed to accept office, the king dismissed Grenville in July 1765. He never again held office. The nickname of \\"gentle shepherd\\" was given him because he bored the House by asking over and over again, during the debate on the Cider Bill of 1763, that somebody should tell him \\"where\\" to lay the new tax if it was not to be put on cider. Pitt whistled the air of the popular tune (by Boyce) Gentle Shepherd, tell me where, and the House laughed.Lawson, p. 149. Though few surpassed him in knowledge of the forms of the House or in mastery of administrative details, he lacked tact in dealing with people and affairs. Later career After a period of active opposition to the Chatham Ministry led by Pitt between 1766 and 1768, Grenville became an elder statesman during his last few years ‚Äì seeking to avoid becoming associated with any faction or party in the House of Commons.Johnson, p. 297. He was able to oversee the re-election of his core group of supporters in the 1768 General Election. His followers included Robert Clive and Lord George Sackville and he received support from his elder brother Lord Temple. In late 1768 he reconciled with Pitt and the two joined forces, re-uniting the partnership that had broken up in 1761 when Pitt had resigned from the government.Lawson, p. 273. Grenville was successful in mobilising the opposition during the Middlesex election dispute. Grenville prosecuted John Wilkes and the printers and authors for treason and sedition for publishing a bitter editorial about King George III's recent speech in \\"The North Briton\\" a weekly periodical. After losing the case Grenville lost favor from the public who regarded the act as an attempt to silence or control the press. Although personally opposed to Wilkes, Grenville saw the government's attempt to bar him from the Commons as unconstitutional and opposed it on principle. Following a French invasion of Corsica in 1768 Grenville advocated sending British support to the Corsican Republic. Grenville was critical of the Grafton Government's failure to intervene and he considered such weakness would encourage the French. In the House of Commons he observed \\"For fear of going to war, you will make a war unavoidable\\".Thomas, p. 199. In 1770 Grenville steered a bill concerning the results of contested elections, a major issue in the eighteenth century, into law ‚Äì despite strong opposition from the government.Lawson, pp. 285‚Äì286. Grenville died on 13 November 1770, aged 58. His personal following divided after his death, with a number joining the government of Lord North. In the long-term the Grenvillites were revived by William Pitt the younger who served as Prime Minister from 1784 and dominated British politics until his death in 1806. Grenville's own son, William Grenville, later served briefly as Prime Minister. Grenville is buried at Wotton Underwood in BuckinghamshireGrenODNB. Legacy He was one of the relatively few prime ministers (others include Henry Pelham, William Pitt the Younger, Henry Campbell-Bannerman, Bonar Law, Ramsay MacDonald, Neville Chamberlain, Sir Winston Churchill, George Canning, Spencer Perceval, William Ewart Gladstone, Edward Heath, John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron, and Theresa May) who never acceded to the peerage. The town of Grenville, Quebec, was named after George Grenville. The town is in turn the namesake for the Grenville orogeny, a long-lived Mesoproterozoic mountain-building event associated with the assembly of the supercontinent Rodinia. Its record is a prominent orogenic belt which spans a significant portion of the North American continent, from Labrador to Mexico, and extends to Scotland. George Grenville's post mortem was carried up by John Hunter who retained specimens in his collection which later became the Hunterian Museum. Subsequent analysis of these specimens published by the Royal College of Surgeons of England suggests that George Grenville was affected by Multiple myeloma at the time of his death. Family life In 1749 Grenville married Elizabeth Wyndham (1719 ‚Äì 5 December 1769), daughter of Sir William Wyndham, and the granddaughter of the Duke of Somerset. Somerset did not approve of their marriage and consequently left Elizabeth only a small sum in his will. Bibliography of source material: * Lawson, P. George Grenville: A Political Life.

It is one of the most common trees in the United States. Although the silver maple‚Äòs Latin name is similar, it should not be confused with Acer saccharum, the sugar maple. Some of the common names are also applied to other maples, especially Acer rubrum. Description Silver maple leaf The silver maple tree is a relatively fast- growing deciduous tree, commonly reaching a height of , exceptionally . Its spread will generally be wide. A 10-year-old sapling will stand about tall. It is often found along waterways and in wetlands, leading to the colloquial name \\"water maple\\". It is a highly adaptable tree, although it has higher sunlight requirements than other maple trees. Silver maple leaves The leaves are simple and palmately veined, long and broad, with deep angular notches between the five lobes. The long, slender stalks of the leaves mean that even a light breeze can produce a striking effect as the downy silver undersides of the leaves are exposed. The autumn color is less pronounced than in many maples, generally ending up a pale yellow, although some specimens can produce a more brilliant yellow and even orange and red colorations. The tree has a tendency to color and drop its leaves slightly earlier in autumn than other maples. Samaras and leaves forming in April The flowers are in dense clusters, produced before the leaves in early spring, with the seeds maturing in early summer. The fruit are samaras, each containing a single seed, and winged, in pairs, small ( in diameter), the wing about long. The fruit are the largest of any native maple. Although the wings provide for some transport by air, the fruit are heavy and are also transported by water. Silver maple and its close cousin red maple are the only Acer species which produce their fruit crop in spring instead of fall. The seeds of both trees have no epigeal dormancy and will germinate immediately. Seed production begins at 11 years of age and large crops are produced most years. Like most maples, silver maple can be variably dioecious (separate male or female trees) or monoecious (male and female flowers on the same tree) but dioecious trees are far more common. They can also change sex from year to year. On mature trunks, the bark is gray and shaggy. On branches and young trunks, the bark is smooth and silvery gray. Cultivation and uses Typical yellow autumn leaf color Atypical reddish autumn color; this sort of coloration is sporadic and uncommon Wildlife uses the silver maple in various ways. In many parts of the eastern U.S., the large rounded buds are one of the primary food sources for squirrels during the spring, after many acorns and nuts have sprouted and the squirrels' food is scarce. The seeds are also a food source for squirrels, chipmunks and birds. The bark can be eaten by beaver and deer. The trunks tend to produce cavities, which can shelter squirrels, raccoons, opossums, owls and woodpeckers. Additionally, the leaves serve as a source of food for species of Lepidoptera, such as the rosy maple moth (Dryocampa rubicunda). Native Americans used the sap of wild trees to make sugar, as medicine, and in bread. They used the wood to make baskets and furniture. An infusion of bark removed from the south side of the tree is used by the Mohegan for cough medicine.Tantaquidgeon, Gladys 1928 Mohegan Medicinal Practices, Weather-Lore and Superstitions. SI-BAE Annual Report #43: 264-270 (p. 269) Today the wood can be used as pulp for making paper. Lumber from the tree is used in furniture, cabinets, flooring, musical instruments, crates, and tool handles, because it is light and easily worked. Because of the silver maple's fast growth, it is being researched as a potential source of biofuels. Silver maple produces a sweet sap but it is generally not used by commercial sugarmakers because its sugar content is lower than in other maple species. Silver maple bark Silver maple is often planted as an ornamental tree because of its rapid growth and ease of propagation and transplanting. It is highly tolerant of urban situations and is frequently planted next to streets. However, its quick growth produces brittle wood which is commonly damaged in storms. The silver maple's root system is shallow and fibrous and easily invades septic fields and old drain pipes; it can also crack sidewalks and foundations. It is a vigorous resprouter, and if not pruned, will often grow with multiple trunks. Although it naturally is found near water, it can grow on drier ground if planted there. In ideal natural conditions, A. saccharinum may live up to 130 years but in urban environments often 80 or less. Following World War II, silver maples were commonly used as a landscaping and street tree in suburban housing developments and cities due to their rapid growth, especially as a replacement for the blighted American elm. However, they fell out of favor for this purpose because of brittle wood, unattractive form when not pruned or trained, and tendency to produce large numbers of volunteer seedlings. Today the tree has fallen so far out of favor that some towns and cities have banned its use as a street tree. Silver maple's natural range encompasses most of the eastern US, the midwestern US and southern Canada, that being Southern Ontario and southwestern Quebec. It is generally absent from the humid US coastal plain south of Maryland meaning it is confined to the Appalachians in those states, and does not occur along the Gulf Coast or in Florida outside a few scattered locations in the panhandle. It is also commonly cultivated outside its native range, showing tolerance of a wide range of climates, growing successfully as far north as central Norway and south to Orlando, Florida. It can thrive in a Mediterranean climate, as at Jerusalem and Los Angeles, if summer water is provided. It is also grown in temperate parts of the Southern Hemisphere: Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela, the southern states of Brazil (as well as in a few low-temperature locations within the states of S√£o Paulo and Minas Gerais). The silver maple is closely related to the red maple (Acer rubrum) and can hybridise with it. The hybrid is known as the Freeman maple (Acer √ó freemanii). The Freeman maple is a popular ornamental tree in parks and large gardens, combining the fast growth of silver maple with the less brittle wood, less invasive roots, and the beautiful bright red fall foliage of the red maple.

It is native to the hardwood forests of eastern Canada, from Nova Scotia west through southern Quebec, central and southern Ontario to southeastern Manitoba around Lake of the Woods, and northcentral and northeastern United States, from Minnesota eastward to Maine and southward to northern Virginia, Tennessee and Missouri. Sugar maple is best known for being the primary source of maple syrup and for its brightly colored fall foliage.  Description  Bark Seasonal leaf color change Acer saccharum is a deciduous tree normally reaching heights of , and exceptionally up to . A 10-year-old tree is typically about tall. Although heights of 120 feet are possible, few sugar maples exceed 70 feet. As with most trees, forest-grown sugar maples form a much taller trunk and narrower canopy than open-growth ones. The leaves are deciduous, up to long and wide, palmate, with five lobes and borne in opposite pairs. The basal lobes are relatively small, while the upper lobes are larger and deeply notched. In contrast with the angular notching of the silver maple, however, the notches tend to be rounded at their interior. The fall color is often spectacular, ranging from bright yellow on some trees through orange to fluorescent red- orange on others. Sugar maples also have a tendency to color unevenly in fall. In some trees, all colors above can be seen at the same time. They also share a tendency with red maples for certain parts of a mature tree to change color weeks ahead of or behind the remainder of the tree. The leaf buds are pointy and brown-colored. The recent year's growth twigs are green, and turn dark brown. A pair of samaras Flowers in spring The flowers are in panicles of five to 10 together, yellow-green and without petals; flowering occurs in early spring after 30‚Äì55 growing degree days. The sugar maple will generally begin flowering when it is between 10 and 200 years old. The fruit is a pair of samaras (winged seeds). The seeds are globose, in diameter, the wing long. The seeds fall from the tree in autumn, where they must be exposed to 45 days of temperatures below to break their coating down. Germination of A. saccharum is slow, not taking place until the following spring when the soil has warmed and all frost danger is past. It is closely related to the black maple, which is sometimes included in this species, but sometimes separated as Acer nigrum. The western American bigtooth maple (Acer grandidentatum) is also treated as a variety or subspecies of sugar maple by some botanists. The sugar maple can be confused with the Norway maple, which is not native to America but is commonly planted in cities and suburbs, and they are not closely related within the genus. The sugar maple is most easily identified by clear sap in the leaf petiole (the Norway maple has white sap), brown, sharp-tipped buds (the Norway maple has blunt, green or reddish-purple buds), and shaggy bark on older trees (the Norway maple bark has small grooves). Also, the leaf lobes of the sugar maple have a more triangular shape, in contrast to the squarish lobes of the Norway maple. Although many people think a red sugar maple leaf is featured on the flag of Canada, the official maple leaf does not belong to any particular maple species; although it perhaps most closely resembles a sugar maple leaf of all the maple species in Canada, the leaf on the flag was specially designed to be as identifiable as possible on a flag waving in the wind without regard to whether it resembled a particular species' foliage.  Ecology  Sugar maple-yellow birch forest, Jacques-Cartier National Park, Quebec, Canada The sugar maple is an extremely important species to the ecology of many forests in the northern United States and Canada. Pure stands are common, and it is a major component of the northern and Midwestern U.S. hardwood forests. Due to its need for cold winters, sugar maple is mostly found north of the 42nd parallel in USDA growing zones 3‚Äì5. It is less common in the southern part of its range (USDA Zone 6) where summers are hot and humid; there sugar maple is confined to ravines and moist flatlands. In the east, from Maryland southward, it is limited to the Appalachians. In the west, Tennessee represents the southern limit of its range and Missouri its southwestern limit. Collection of sap for sugar is also not possible in the southern part of sugar maple's range as winter temperatures do not become cold enough. The minimum seed-bearing age of sugar maple is about 30 years. The tree is long-lived, typically 200 years and occasionally as much as 300. Sugar maple is native to areas with cooler climates and requires a hard freeze each winter for proper dormancy. In northern parts of its range, January temperatures average about and July temperatures about ; in southern parts, January temperatures average about and July temperatures average almost . Seed germination also requires extremely low temperatures, the optimal being just slightly above freezing, and no other known tree species has this property. Germination of sugar maple seed in temperatures above is rare to nonexistent. Acer saccharum is among the most shade tolerant of large deciduous trees. Its shade tolerance is exceeded only by the striped maple, a smaller tree. Like other maples, its shade tolerance is manifested in its ability to germinate and persist under a closed canopy as an understory plant, and respond with rapid growth to the increased light formed by a gap in the canopy. Sugar maple can tolerate virtually any soil type short of pure sand, but does not tolerate xeric or swampy conditions. Sugar maples are deeper-rooted than most maples and engage in hydraulic lift, drawing water from lower soil layers and exuding that water into upper, drier soil layers. This not only benefits the tree itself, but also many other plants growing around it. Sugar Maple terminal bud Human influences have contributed to the decline of the sugar maple in many regions. Its role as a species of mature forests has led it to be replaced by more opportunistic species in areas where forests are cut over. Climate change has contributed to the decline of the sugar maple by pushing the suitable habitat range for the trees further north, where temperatures are cooler. This has resulted in a gradual northward migration of the species. The sugar maple also exhibits a greater susceptibility to pollution than other species of maple. Acid rain and soil acidification are some of the primary contributing factors to maple decline. Also, the increased use of salt over the last several decades on streets and roads for deicing purposes has decimated the sugar maple's role as a street tree. The mushroom Pholiota squarrosoides is known to decay the logs of the tree. In some parts of New England, particularly near urbanized areas, the sugar maple is being displaced by the Norway maple. The Norway maple is also highly shade tolerant, but is considerably more tolerant of urban conditions, resulting in the sugar maple's replacement in those areas. In addition, Norway maple produces much larger crops of seeds, allowing it to out-compete native species.  Cultivation and uses  = Maple syrup = Collecting sap from sugar maples The sugar maple is one of the most important Canadian trees, being, with the black maple, the major source of sap for making maple syrup. Other maple species can be used as a sap source for maple syrup, but some have lower sugar contents and/or produce more cloudy syrup than these two. In maple syrup production from Acer saccharum, the sap is extracted from the trees using a tap placed into a hole drilled through the phloem, just inside the bark. The collected sap is then boiled. As the sap boils, the water is evaporated off and the syrup left behind. Forty gallons of maple sap are required to be boiled to produce only 1 gallon of pure syrup. Syrup production is dependent on the tree growing in cooler climates; as such, sugar maples in the southern part of its range produce little sap. = Timber = Ultra-thin sugar maple sections from Romeyn Beck Hough's American Woods. From top to bottom, the image displays transverse, radial and tangential sections. The adjacent image shows light passing through the specimens. The sapwood can be white, and smaller logs may have a higher proportion of this desirable wood. Bowling alleys and bowling pins are both commonly manufactured from sugar maple. Trees with wavy woodgrain, which can occur in curly, quilted, and \\"birdseye maple\\" forms, are especially valued. Maple is also the wood used for basketball courts, including the floors used by the NBA, and it is a popular wood for baseball bats, along with white ash. In recent years, because white ash has become threatened by emerald ash borer, sugar maple wood has increasingly displaced it for baseball bat production. It is also widely used in the manufacture of musical instruments, such as the members of the violin family (sides and back), guitars (neck), and drum shells. It is also often used in the manufacture of sporting goods. Canadian maple, often referred to as \\"Canadian hardrock maple\\", is prized for pool cues, especially the shafts. Some production-line cues will use lower-quality maple wood with cosmetic issues, such as \\"sugar marks\\", which are most often light brown discolorations caused by sap in the wood. The best shaft wood has a very consistent grain, with no marks or discoloration. Sugar marks usually do not affect how the cue plays, but are not as high quality as those without it. The wood is also used in gunstocks and flooring for its strength. Canadian hardrock maple is also used in the manufacture of electric guitar necks due to its high torsional stability and the bright, crisp resonant tone it produces. If the grain is curly, with flame or quilt patterns, it's usually reserved for more expensive instruments. In high-end guitars this wood is sometimes Torrefied to cook out the Lignin resins, allowing the greater stability to climate & environmental changes, and to enhance its tonal characteristics as the instrument's resonance is more evenly distributed across the cellulose structure of the wood without the lignin. = Urban planting = Sugar maple in a suburban landscape Closeup of autumn foliage Sugar maple was a favorite street and park tree during the 19th century because it was easy to propagate and transplant, is fairly fast-growing, and has beautiful fall color. As noted above, however, it proved too delicate to continue in that role after the rise of automobile- induced pollution and was replaced by Norway maple and other hardier species. The shade and the shallow, fibrous roots may interfere with grass growing under the trees. Deep, well-drained loam is the best rooting medium, although sugar maples can grow well on sandy soil which has a good buildup of humus. Light (or loose) clay soils are also well known to support sugar maple growth. Poorly drained areas are unsuitable, and the species is especially short-lived on flood-prone clay flats. Its salt tolerance is low and it is very sensitive to boron. The species is also subject to defoliation when there are dense populations of larvae of Lepidoptera species like the rosy maple moth (Dryocampa rubicunda).

In 2007, the year it was submitted, it had a circumference of 5.92 m (233 inches, 19.4 ft) at 1.3 meters above the ground's surface, and thus a diameter at breast height of about 1.88 m (6.18 ft). At that time the tree was (34.1 m (112 ft) tall with an average crown spread of 27.7 m (91 ft). Using the scoring system of circumference in inches plus height in feet plus 25% of crown spread in feet resulted in a total number of 368 points at the National Register of Big Trees. A tree in Lyme, Connecticut, measured in 2012, had a circumference of 18.25 feet (5.56 m), or an average diameter at breast height of about 5.8 feet (1.77 m). This tree had been 123 ft (37.5 m) tall with a crown spread of 86 ft (26.2 m), counting for a total number of 364 points.

The group released several singles in the first half of the 1970s on labels such as Micron and their own Ital label, and were an early example of the Rastafari movement's influence on the Jamaican music scene, taking a clear lead from The Abyssinians. After recording \\"Mysterious Nature\\" for producer Rupie Edwards, the group recorded 1974's \\"No Cup No Broke\\" for Studio One, breaking up shortly after. Minott then teamed up with the producer Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, as studio apprentice at Dodd's Studio One, working as a singer, guitarist and percussionist, and soon began recording his own singles.Larkin, Colin: \\"The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae\\", Virgin Books, 1998, Minott developed a talent for writing new songs to fit over existing rhythms (which at the time was common when singers performed live, but rare in the studio), often proving more popular than the original songs, pioneering an approach that would be central to the emerging dancehall style. After a number of moderately successful hits for Studio One, such as \\"Vanity\\", \\"Hang On Natty\\", \\"Mr. DC\\", and \\"Jah Jah Children\\", his debut LP Live Loving made his name and increased his popularity, and is regarded as pioneering the dancehall style that would dominate the early 1980s. It was followed in 1979 with a second album, Showcase, which included his singles that had been omitted from the first album. The Bittersweet album followed, and then the third album of 1979, Ghetto-ology, which saw a return to roots reggae. Roots Lovers (1980) saw a move towards lovers rock, which was a UK hit. He became a bigger star in the UK than in Jamaica, his self-produced \\"Hard Time Pressure\\" being a major UK reggae hit in 1980, leading Minott to relocate to the UK, where he became a focus for UK reggae. Singles such as \\"Run Come\\", \\"Not for Sale\\", \\"African Girl\\", \\"Lovers Rock\\", \\"In a Dis Ya Time\\", \\"Africa\\" and \\"Make It with You\\" (with Carroll Thompson) were hits in the years that followed. \\"Good Thing Going\\" (a cover of a song originally recorded by Michael Jackson in 1971) was picked up for distribution by RCA and reached Number 4 in the UK Singles Chart in March 1981, leading to an album of the same name. The Herbman Hustling album saw a return to dancehall and roots reggae. He released an album of recordings from Channel One Studios, With Lots Of Extra in 1983, collecting several hits from his time working with Winston Holness. While Minott was in England he discovered the group Musical Youth and released a number of successful Lovers Rock singles. Returning to Jamaica, his Youth Promotion sound system performed regularly in Kingston's Maxfield Park, featuring Jah Stitch and newcomers who had been nurtured by his organization such as Ranking Joe, Captain Sinbad, and Ranking Dread. His Black Roots label featured his productions of these artists plus others such as Barry Brown, Tenor Saw, Little John, Tony Tuff, Barrington Levy, Horace Andy, and one of his discoveries from England, Trevor Hartley. Minott also produced early works by Nitty Gritty, Junior Reid, Yami Bolo, Colourman, Daddy Freddy and Garnett Silk. Throughout the 1980s the hits kept coming. Able to encompass different styles from rough roots to sweet lovers, through to classic dancehall, he was an artist of some influence. In that period he was working for all the top producers in Jamaica including, Mikey Dread, George Phang, Sly & Robbie, Philip \\"Fatis\\" Burrell, Channel One, Prince Jammy, and Donovan Germain, as well as recording for United States-based Lloyd \\"Bullwackie\\" Barnes (the Wicked A Go feel It album from 1984). His biggest hits included \\"Herbman Hustling\\", \\"No Vacancy\\", \\"Jamming in the Street\\", \\"Rub A Dub Sound\\", \\"Buy Off The Bar\\", \\"Rydim\\", and \\"Devil's Pickney\\". He linked up with Sly & Robbie for 1984's \\"Rub a Dub Sound Style\\" single, which is regarded as a prototype for the ragga style that developed in the mid-1980s. Sugar Minott continued to record on his Black Roots label, Youth Promotion Label and for Major and Independent labels. His albums receive increasingly exciting reviews. He released over 60 albums and hundreds of singles. Sugar is one of the artists who appeared on the (2006) record, Radiodread, released by the Easy Star label, he provided the guest vocals on the song \\"Exit Music (For a Film)\\". Minott's desire for independence led him to leave Studio One in 1978 and form his own Black Roots Records label and Youth Promotion organization, the latter with the aim of helping young singers from the same ghetto background as himself. Minott also ran the Youthman Promotion sound-system, giving young performers their first public exposure. Youthman Promotion has new selectors working alongside the veterans of Major Stitch, Ragga Steve and Drifter, Daddy Ants, Mr Shorty and Jimmy Knuckles. The selectors most recently added to the sound are DiGeneral Starry B in 2007, alongside Poochiny and Jr War, who were added in 2012. Ragga Steve has taken full control of the sound with Earl Minott in the UK. Death Minott died on 10 July 2010 at the University Hospital of the West Indies in St. Andrew Parish, Jamaica, after being admitted earlier that day. The cause of death remains undisclosed. He had been affected by a heart condition since early 2009, and cancelled several performances in May 2010 due to chest pains.\\"Sugar Minott dies aged 54\\", BBC, 12 July 2010.

STEbus 68008 processor The original 68000 (introduced in 1979) has a 24-bit address bus and a 16-bit data bus. These relatively large buses made it hard to design a low-cost system based on the 68000; they were difficult to lay out on a circuit board and needed a lot of supporting circuitry. A 16-bit data bus also required twice as many memory chips as an 8-bit one. The 68008, introduced in 1982, was designed to work with low-cost 8-bit memory systems. Because of its smaller data bus, it was only about half as fast as a 68000 of the same clock speed. However, it was still faster than competing 8-bit microprocessors, because the 68008 internally was based on 32-bit data registers and a 16-bit data bus. Except for its smaller data and address buses, the 68008 behaved identically to the 68000 and had the same internal organization and microarchitecture. The 68008 was an HMOS chip with about it came with a speed grade of . There were two distinct versions of the chip.

A later version came in a 52-pin plastic leaded chip carrier; this version provided a 22-bit address bus and could support of RAM. Very few computer systems used the 68008 as the main processor; the Sinclair QL microcomputer is the best known of these. However, the 68008 was popular in embedded systems.

History  =Time of the Companions= While many Companions narrated hadith, according to Ahmad ibn Hanbal there were six who were the most prolific narrators of them, who lived long lives enabling them narrate to a large extent. They were: Abu Huraira, Abdullah ibn Umar, Aisha, Jabir ibn Abdullah, Ibn Abbas and Anas ibn Malik with Abu Huraira being the most prolific of them.Muqadimah Ibn al-Salah, by Ibn al-Salah, edited by 'Aishah bint 'Abd al-Rahman, p. 492, Dar al-Ma'arif, Cairo. According to Ibn al-Salah the most prolific narrators from the Companions was Abu Huraira followed by Ibn Abbas. In spite of the Companions' efforts in narrating their hadith, there was no need for them to evaluate each other's narrating capabilities or trustworthiness. This is because, as Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi said, that Allah and his Prophet declared the Companions to be upright and trustworthy, and, therefore, there is no need to investigate their reliability, however, one must investigate the condition of those after them.Al-Kifayah, by al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, p. 46, Dar al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyyah, Beirut, Lebanon, 1988; this edition is apparently based upon the original Indian printing. However, there are many established narrations originating from the Companions praising some of the Tabi'un with some criticism of specific individuals from them. =After the Companions= As for the Tabi'un, the generation following the Companions, their praise of narrators was plentiful, while disparagement from them was seldom. Those narrators who were criticized from the Followers were not criticized for fabricating hadith, but, instead, due to heresy, such as the Kharijites, or due to weak memory or due to their condition as narrators being unknown. Evaluating the narrators of hadith began in the generation following that of the Companions based upon the statement of Muhammad Ibn Sirin, \\"They did not previously inquire about the isnad. However, after the turmoil occurred they would say, 'Name for us your narrators.' So the people of the Sunnah would have their hadith accepted and the people of innovation would not.\\"Reported by Muslim in the introduction to his Sahih, vol. 1, p. 8. The turmoil referred to is the conflicting ideology of the Shias after the passing of the Prophet, and later the Kharijites that had emerged at the time of the third Sunni Caliph Uthman ibn Affan's assassination and the social unrest of the Kharijites in opposition to the succeeding rulers, Ali and Muawiyah.This is the explanation provided by al-Qurtubi in al-Mufhim, vol. 1, pgs. 122-3 as quoted in Qurrah Ayn Al-Muhtaj, vol. 2, pg 58. The death of Uthman was in the year 35 after the migration.Al-Bidayah wa Al-Nihayah, by Ibn Kathir, vol. 10, p. 323, Dar Alam al-Kutub. In the following generation, Tabi' al-Tabi'in, and afterward, the weak, unacceptable narrators increased in number, necessitating that a group of scholars clarify the condition of the narrators and distinguishing any narrations that were not authentic. Early specialists According to Ibn al-Salah, quoting an early religious authority, the first to specialize in the study of hadith narrators was Shu øba Ibn al-·∏§ajjƒÅj, followed by Yahya ibn Sa'id al-Qattan and then Ahmad ibn Hanbal and Yahya ibn Ma'in. Al-Bulqini added some names to the aforementioned: Ali ibn al-Madini and 'Amr ibn 'Ali al-Fallas, and then mentioned Malik ibn Anas and Hisham ibn Urwah as having preceded them in evaluating narrators.  Overview  =Narrator criteria= A hadith is subject to criticism on the basis of two matters. The first relates to the continuity of the hadith's chain of narration; if there is discontinuity between two or more narrators, that hadith is criticized on this basis as discussed in depth in the hadith terminology article. The second relates to criticism of a narrator, or more, in the chain of narration of a particular hadith.Nuzhah al-Nathar, by Ibn ·∏§ajr, published as an-Nukat, p. 108, Dar Ibn al-Jawzi, Dammam, Saudi Arabia, sixth edition, 2001. Hadith narrators are evaluated in light of two qualities in determining the overall grading of a hadith. These qualities are derived from the definition of a hadith that is sahih constituting two of its five conditions. The first, uprightness (al- ªadƒÅlah), is defined as the ability an individual possesses to adhere to moralistic decorum (al-taqwƒÅ) and maintaining proper social graces (al-mur≈´ ºah). The second, precision (al- ·∏çab·π≠), is of two types, the first is pertaining to memorization and the second to writing. Precision in memorization (·∏çab·π≠ al-·π£adr) refers to the ability to retain the specified information, recalling and conveying it at will. Precision in writing (·∏çab·π≠ al-kitƒÅb) is the preservation of the written information from the time it was heard until its transmission.Nuzhah al- Nathar, p. 83. =Grounds for criticism= The grounds upon which a narrator is subject to criticism are numerous some relating to moral uprightness and others to precision. Ibn ·∏§ajr identified and enumerated ten qualities in which a narrator could be criticized. Five relate to trustworthiness and the other five to precision; however, he presented these ten qualities in order according to severity: # A narrator intentionally lying, claiming a statement to be a Prophetic hadith when it is not. The inclusion of a narrator of a hadith as such renders that hadith fabricated (Maw·∏ç≈´ ª). # An accusation of fabricating a hadith. This would be due a narration that clearly contradicts established religious principles originating from the direction (as it pertains to that hadith's chain of narration) of that individual. Or, that a narrator is known to lie in his ordinary speech but not while narrating hadith. # Plenitude of mistakes in a narrator's hadith. # Lack of attention to accuracy. # The commission of wrongdoing by statement or action as long as it does not constitute apostasy. # Misconception due to narrating on the basis of misunderstanding. # Contradiction of that narrator's hadith of another established narrator. # Unspecification of that narrator's standing in their narrating capabilities. # Heresy, being the belief in an innovated matter that contradicts the established religious practice originating with the Prophet due to a misconception, not obstinateness. # Poor memory, differing from number three above in that the mistakes of that narrator outnumber instances in which they are correct.Nuzhah al-Nathar, pgs. 116‚Äì17. =Methods of evaluation= Hadith scholars of the past employed various methods by which to evaluate the narrating abilities of a narrator. From these means are the following: # Observing that narrator's religiosity and asking others about it. # Requesting the narrator in question to narrate from a particular living scholar and then returning to that scholar and comparing his narrations with those of the narrator under examination. # If the narrator narrates from a deceased scholar, inquiring when he, the narrator in question, was born, when he met that scholar and where and then comparing the dates provided in his response to the recognized dates of that scholars death and travels. So, perhaps, the dates provided by the narrator may contradict the established dates, for example, claiming that he heard from a particular scholar after the recognized death of that scholar. # Comparing the narrations of the narrator with those of narrators of established reliability, comparing them seeking any distinctions that might be unique to that narrator, in particular, while contradicting the others. # Examination of the narrations either written or memorized by that narrator after the passage of time observing any discrepancies with their initial narrations.Ilm al-rijƒÅl wa Ihimmiyyatuh, pp. 22‚Äì4. # Deliberately altering the wording of a hadith or more for the purpose of examining the ability of the narrator being examined to detect those alterations. This is considered an acceptable practice as long as those alterations are brought to light following the examination process.Nuzhah al- Nathar, [ 127.  Evaluation terminology  As a result of the evaluation of narrators, each scholar would then conclude by describing the standing of each narrator. A system of terminology developed to codify the standing of each narrator, with some variation in usage of terms between the individual evaluators. These are divided into two categories, those terms that constitute praise (ta ªdƒ´l) and those that constitute criticism (jar·∏•). al-Suy≈´·π≠ƒ´ gathered the various terms and arranged them in order of strength. He quoted four levels of strength for praise from Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah, adding that al-Dhahabi and Abd al-Rahim ibn al-Husain al-'Iraqi added an additional level and Ibn ·∏§ajr one above that. Thus according to al-Suy≈´·π≠ƒ´, there are six levels of praise. Similarly, al-Suy≈´·π≠ƒ´ described six levels of terms used to criticize a narrator; he arranged them beginning with the least severe and concluding with the most severe criticism.Tadrib al-Rawi, by al-Suy≈´·π≠ƒ´, vol. 1, pp. 573-8, Dar al-'Asimah, Riyadh, first edition, 2003. =Levels of praise= #Ibn ·∏§ajr held that the highest level of praise was expressed was through the use of the superlative, for example, the most established of the people (), or the most reliable of the people (). #Al-'Iraqi and al-Dhahabi were of the opinion that the highest level was the repetition of adjective, or adjectives, in praising a narrator. For example, reliably reliable (), or reliable, firm (). #The highest level according to Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al- Salah the highest is the use of a single adjective in describing a narrator. Examples of this are: reliable (), precise ({{translarmutqin) or firm (). #Trustworthy () and worthy of trust () are both examples of the next category to Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah while al-'Iraqi and al-Dhahabi consider the latter term to be from the next level. #Next is respectable (shaykh) along with worthy of trust () according to some. This level would also be inclusive of an individual accused of heresy. #The lowest of the levels of praise is, for example, satisfactory in hadith (), meaning according to Ibn ·∏§ajr, this includes acceptable () meaning, when supported by other narrators.As he explained in the introduction to Taqrib al-Tahthib, pp. 14, Mu'assasah al- Risalah, Beirut, first edition, 1999. =Levels of criticism= #The least severe level for the criticism of a narrator is soft in hadith (layyin al- ·∏•adƒ´th) and, according to al-'Iraqi, they have spoken about him (takallam≈´ fƒ´hi). This level would also be taken into consideration as a corroborating narrator, but at a level less than the lowest level of praise. #Next is he is not strong (laysa bi l-qawƒ´). The hadith of a narrator determined to be at this level would also be taken into consideration, as with the previous level, however, this narrator is weaker than one of the previous level. #More severe than he is not strong is weak in hadith (·∏ça ªƒ´f al-·∏•adƒ´th), however, none of these first three categories are rejected outright. #The fourth of the levels of severity of criticism includes terms such as: his hadith is rejected (rudd al-·∏•adƒ´th) and very weak (·∏ça ªƒ´f jiddan). #The fifth includes terms such as: his hadith is abandoned (matr≈´k al-·∏•adƒ´th) and destroyed (hƒÅlik). #From the most severe level of terms of criticism are: compulsive liar (kadhdhƒÅb), he lies (yakdhib) and fabricator (wa·∏ç·∏çƒÅ ª) among other terms.

Somewhat confusingly, in atomic physics, e sometimes denotes the electron charge, i.e. the negative of the elementary charge. In the US, the base of the natural logarithm is often denoted e (italicized), while it is usually denoted e (roman type) in the UK and Continental Europe. This elementary charge is a fundamental physical constant. To avoid confusion over its sign, e is sometimes called the elementary positive charge. From the 2019 redefinition of SI base units, which took effect on 20 May 2019, its value is exactly , by definition of the coulomb. In the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system of units (CGS), it is .This is derived from the National Institute of Standards and Technology value and uncertainty, using the fact that one coulomb is exactly statcoulombs. The conversion factor is ten times the numerical speed of light in metres per second. Making the value of the elementary charge exact implies that the value of Œµ0 (electric constant), which was an exact value before, is now subject to experimental determination: Œµ0 had an exactly defined value until the 2019 SI redefinition, after which it has become a subject of experimental refinement over time. The SI committees (CGPM, CIPM, etc.) had long considered redefining the SI base units entirely in terms of physical constants so as to remove their dependence on physical artifacts (such as the International Prototype of the Kilogram): for this to work, it was necessary to define fixed values for the physical constants., p. 125 Robert A. Millikan's oil drop experiment first measured the magnitude of the elementary charge in 1909.Robert Millikan: The Oil-Drop Experiment  As a unit  In some natural unit systems, such as the system of atomic units, e functions as the unit of electric charge, that is e is equal to 1 e in those unit systems. The use of elementary charge as a unit was promoted by George Johnstone Stoney in 1874 for the first system of natural units, called Stoney units. Later, he proposed the name electron for this unit. At the time, the particle we now call the electron was not yet discovered and the difference between the particle electron and the unit of charge electron was still blurred. Later, the name electron was assigned to the particle and the unit of charge e lost its name. However, the unit of energy electronvolt reminds us that the elementary charge was once called electron. In high-energy physics (HEP), Lorentz‚ÄìHeaviside units are used, and the charge unit is a dependent one, \\\\sqrt{\\\\hbar c}, so that = ‚âà 0.30282212088 , where Œ± is the fine-structure constant, c is the speed of light, \\\\hbar is the reduced Planck's constant.  Quantization  Charge quantization is the principle that the charge of any object is an integer multiple of the elementary charge. Thus, an object's charge can be exactly 0 e, or exactly 1 e, ‚àí1 e, 2 e, etc., but not, say, e, or ‚àí3.8 e, etc. (There may be exceptions to this statement, depending on how \\"object\\" is defined; see below.) This is the reason for the terminology \\"elementary charge\\": it is meant to imply that it is an indivisible unit of charge. = Charges less than an elementary charge = There are two known sorts of exceptions to the indivisibility of the elementary charge: quarks and quasiparticles. *Quarks, first posited in the 1960s, have quantized charge, but the charge is quantized into multiples of e. However, quarks cannot be seen as isolated particles; they exist only in groupings, and stable groupings of quarks (such as a proton, which consists of three quarks) all have charges that are integer multiples of e. For this reason, either 1 e or e can be justifiably considered to be \\"the quantum of charge\\", depending on the context. This charge commensurability, \\"charge quantization\\", has partially motivated Grand unified Theories. *Quasiparticles are not particles as such, but rather an emergent entity in a complex material system that behaves like a particle. In 1982 Robert Laughlin explained the fractional quantum Hall effect by postulating the existence of fractionally charged quasiparticles. This theory is now widely accepted, but this is not considered to be a violation of the principle of charge quantization, since quasiparticles are not elementary particles. =What is the quantum of charge?= All known elementary particles, including quarks, have charges that are integer multiples of e. Therefore, one can say that the \\"quantum of charge\\" is e. In this case, one says that the \\"elementary charge\\" is three times as large as the \\"quantum of charge\\". On the other hand, all isolatable particles have charges that are integer multiples of e. (Quarks cannot be isolated: they only exist in collective states like protons that have total charges that are integer multiples of e.) Therefore, one can say that the \\"quantum of charge\\" is e, with the proviso that quarks are not to be included. In this case, \\"elementary charge\\" would be synonymous with the \\"quantum of charge\\". In fact, both terminologies are used.Q is for Quantum, by John R. Gribbin, Mary Gribbin, Jonathan Gribbin, page 296, Web link For this reason, phrases like \\"the quantum of charge\\" or \\"the indivisible unit of charge\\" can be ambiguous unless further specification is given. On the other hand, the term \\"elementary charge\\" is unambiguous: it refers to a quantity of charge equal to that of a proton. =Lack of fractional charges= Paul Dirac persuasively argued in 1931 that if magnetic monopoles exist, then electric charge must be quantized; however, it is unknown whether magnetic monopoles actually exist.Preskill, J. (1984). Magnetic monopoles. Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science, 34(1), 461-530. It is currently unknown why isolatable particles are restricted to integer charges; much of the string theory landscape appears to admit fractional charges.  Experimental measurements of the elementary charge  Before reading, it must be remembered that the elementary charge is exactly defined since 20 May 2019 by the International System of Units. = In terms of the Avogadro constant and Faraday constant = If the Avogadro constant NA and the Faraday constant F are independently known, the value of the elementary charge can be deduced using the formula : e = \\\\frac{F}{N_\\\\text{A}}. (In other words, the charge of one mole of electrons, divided by the number of electrons in a mole, equals the charge of a single electron.) This method is not how the most accurate values are measured today. Nevertheless, it is a legitimate and still quite accurate method, and experimental methodologies are described below. The value of the Avogadro constant NA was first approximated by Johann Josef Loschmidt who, in 1865, estimated the average diameter of the molecules in air by a method that is equivalent to calculating the number of particles in a given volume of gas. English translation . Today the value of NA can be measured at very high accuracy by taking an extremely pure crystal (often silicon), measuring how far apart the atoms are spaced using X-ray diffraction or another method, and accurately measuring the density of the crystal. From this information, one can deduce the mass (m) of a single atom; and since the molar mass (M) is known, the number of atoms in a mole can be calculated: NA = M/m. The value of F can be measured directly using Faraday's laws of electrolysis. Faraday's laws of electrolysis are quantitative relationships based on the electrochemical researches published by Michael Faraday in 1834. In an electrolysis experiment, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the electrons passing through the anode-to-cathode wire and the ions that plate onto or off of the anode or cathode. Measuring the mass change of the anode or cathode, and the total charge passing through the wire (which can be measured as the time-integral of electric current), and also taking into account the molar mass of the ions, one can deduce F. The limit to the precision of the method is the measurement of F: the best experimental value has a relative uncertainty of 1.6 ppm, about thirty times higher than other modern methods of measuring or calculating the elementary charge. = Oil-drop experiment = A famous method for measuring e is Millikan's oil-drop experiment. A small drop of oil in an electric field would move at a rate that balanced the forces of gravity, viscosity (of traveling through the air), and electric force. The forces due to gravity and viscosity could be calculated based on the size and velocity of the oil drop, so electric force could be deduced. Since electric force, in turn, is the product of the electric charge and the known electric field, the electric charge of the oil drop could be accurately computed. By measuring the charges of many different oil drops, it can be seen that the charges are all integer multiples of a single small charge, namely e. The necessity of measuring the size of the oil droplets can be eliminated by using tiny plastic spheres of a uniform size. The force due to viscosity can be eliminated by adjusting the strength of the electric field so that the sphere hovers motionless. = Shot noise = Any electric current will be associated with noise from a variety of sources, one of which is shot noise. Shot noise exists because a current is not a smooth continual flow; instead, a current is made up of discrete electrons that pass by one at a time. By carefully analyzing the noise of a current, the charge of an electron can be calculated. This method, first proposed by Walter H. Schottky, can determine a value of e of which the accuracy is limited to a few percent. However, it was used in the first direct observation of Laughlin quasiparticles, implicated in the fractional quantum Hall effect. =From the Josephson and von Klitzing constants= Another accurate method for measuring the elementary charge is by inferring it from measurements of two effects in quantum mechanics: The Josephson effect, voltage oscillations that arise in certain superconducting structures; and the quantum Hall effect, a quantum effect of electrons at low temperatures, strong magnetic fields, and confinement into two dimensions. The Josephson constant is : K_\\\\text{J} = \\\\frac{2e}{h}, where h is the Planck constant. It can be measured directly using the Josephson effect. The von Klitzing constant is : R_\\\\text{K} = \\\\frac{h}{e^2}. It can be measured directly using the quantum Hall effect. From these two constants, the elementary charge can be deduced: : e = \\\\frac{2}{R_\\\\text{K} K_\\\\text{J}}. =CODATA method= The relation used by CODATA to determine elementary charge was: : e^2 = \\\\frac{2h \\\\alpha}{\\\\mu_0 c} = 2h \\\\alpha \\\\varepsilon_0 c, where h is the Planck constant, Œ± is the fine-structure constant, Œº0 is the magnetic constant, Œµ0 is the electric constant, and c is the speed of light. Presently this equation reflects a relation between Œµ0 and Œ±, while all others are fixed values. Thus the relative standard uncertainties of both will be same.

They are frequently used where burial space is scarce. A body is first buried in a temporary grave, then after some years the skeletal remains are removed and placed in an ossuary (\\"os\\" is \\"bone\\" in Latinhttps://www.funeralguide.co.uk/blog/what-is-an-ossuary). The greatly reduced space taken up by an ossuary means that it is possible to store the remains of many more people in a single tomb than if the original coffins were left as is.  Persian  In Persia, the Zoroastrians used a deep well for this function from the earliest times (c. 3,000 years ago) and called it astudan (literally, \\"the place for the bones\\"). There are many rituals and regulations in the Zoroastrian faith concerning the astudans.  Roman Catholic  The ossuary of San Bernardino alle Ossa in Milan. Many examples of ossuaries are found within Europe, including the Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini in Rome, Italy; the Martyrs of Otranto in south Italy; the Fontanelle cemetery and Purgatorio ad Arco in Naples, Italy; the San Bernardino alle Ossa in Milan, Italy; the Brno Ossuary and the Sedlec Ossuary in the Czech Republic; the Czermna Skull Chapel in Poland; and the Capela dos Ossos (\\"Chapel of Bones\\") in √âvora, Portugal. The village of Wamba in the province of Valladolid, Spain, has an impressive ossuary of over a thousand skulls inside the local church, dating from between the 12th and 18th centuries. A more recent example is the Douaumont ossuary in France, which contains the remains of more than 130,000 French and German soldiers that fell at the Battle of Verdun during World War I. The Catacombs of Paris represents another famous ossuary. The catacombs beneath the Monastery of San Francisco in Lima, Peru, also contains an ossuary. Eastern Orthodox Greek ossuaries made of wood and metal. The use of ossuaries is a longstanding tradition in the Orthodox Church. The remains of an Orthodox Christian are treated with special reverence, in conformity with the biblical teaching that the body of a believer is a \\"temple of the Holy Spirit\\", having been sanctified and transfigured by Baptism, Holy Communion and the participation in the mystical life of the Church. In Orthodox monasteries, when one of the brethren dies, his remains are buried (for details, see Christian burial) for one to three years, and then disinterred, cleaned and gathered into the monastery's charnel house. If there is reason to believe that the departed is a saint, the remains may be placed in a reliquary; otherwise the bones are usually mingled together (skulls together in one place, long bones in another, etc.). The remains of an abbot may be placed in a separate ossuary made out of wood or metal. The use of ossuaries is also found among the laity in the Greek Orthodox Church. The departed will be buried for one to three years and then, often on the anniversary of death, the family will gather with the parish priest and celebrate a parastas (memorial service), after which the remains are disinterred, washed with wine, perfumed, and placed in a small ossuary of wood or metal, inscribed with the name of the departed, and placed in a room, often in or near the church, which is dedicated to this purpose. Jewish Ossuaries  Jewish ossuary inscription from Second Temple period. During the Second Temple period, Jewish burial customs were varied, differing based on class and belief. For the wealthy, one option available included primary burials in burial caves, followed by secondary burials in ossuaries. These bone boxes were placed in smaller niches of the burial caves, on the benches used for the desiccation of the corpse, or even on the floor. These ossuaries are almost exclusively made of limestone, roughly 40% of which are decorated with intricate geometrical patterns. Many ossuaries, plain or decorated, feature inscriptions identifying the deceased. These inscriptions are the chief scholarly source for identifying naming conventions in this region during this period. Among the best-known Jewish ossuaries of this period are: an ossuary inscribed 'Simon the Temple builder' in the collection of the Israel Museum; one inscribed 'Yehohanan ben Hagkol' that contained an iron nail in a heel bone suggesting crucifixion; another inscribed 'James son of Joseph, brother of Jesus', the authenticity of which is not supported by most scholars; and ten ossuaries recovered from the Talpiot Tomb in 1980, several of which are reported to have names recorded in the New Testament. Geographically, ossuaries are almost exclusively associated with tombs in and around Jerusalem; however, caches of contemporaneous ossuaries have been discovered in Jericho. There is ongoing scholarly disagreement as to the function and origin of ossuary burial. Some argue that this form of burial was born out of a theological shift in ideas about purity. Specifically, in the Mishnah and Talmud, Jewish sages from the period are depicted debating the methods and beliefs around ossuary burial. The perspectives they espouse are connected to the Pharisaic tradition; as such, it is speculated that ossuaries were developed by elite members of the Pharisaic religious school before spreading to other sects. Others argue that material conditions of the elite have more influence on ossuaries use and form during this period. An increase in wealth among the urban elite in Jerusalem and Jericho, coupled with a building boom that created a surplus of stone masons, allowed for new kinds of burial to evolve. It has been observed that ossuaries follow philosophically with Greco- Roman ideas of individuality in death and physically with Hellenistic forms of chest burial; as such, ossuaries may be an elite imitation of imperial burial modes that did not violate Jewish cultural norms. The custom of secondary burial in ossuaries, on a whole, did not persist among Jews past the Second Temple period nor appear to exist widely among Jews outside the land of Israel. There are, of course, exceptions to every trend: after the destruction of the Second Temple, poor imitations of ossuaries made of clay were created in Galilee; the last stone ossuaries are found in Beth Shearim and date from the late third century CE; and at least one ossuary dating from the Second Temple period has been discovered in Alexandria.  Largest ossuary  The skeletal remains of six million people lie, neatly arranged, in catacombs (also known as ossuaries or charnel houses) beneath the streets of Paris, France.

He is a key figure in classical sociology, as well as one of the founders of the sociology of knowledge. Mannheim is best known for his book Ideology and Utopia (1929/1936), in which he distinguishes between partial and total ideologies, the latter representing comprehensive worldviews distinctive to particular social groups, and also between ideologies that provide outdated support for existing social arrangements, and utopias, which look to the future and threaten to transform a society.David Kettler, Volker Meja, and Nico Stehr (1984), Karl Mannheim, London: Tavistock  Biography  = Childhood and education = Karl Mannheim was born 27 March 1893 in Budapest, to a Hungarian father, a textile merchant, and German mother, both of Jewish descent.David Kettler and Volker Meja, \\"Karl Mannheim's Jewish Question\\" in Religions 2012, 3, p. 231 His early education was in that city, he studied philosophy and literature at the University of Budapest, though he also went to Berlin (where he studied with Georg Simmel) and Paris to further his education, returning to Hungary around the start of the First World War. He obtained a PhD from the University of Budapest, and further qualifications from the University of Heidelberg. = Academic career = During the War he was involved in a number of influential intellectual circles: the Galileo Circle founded by Karl Polanyi in which Michael Polanyi also participated, the Social Science Association organised by Oscar J√°szi, and the Sonntagskreis or 'Sunday Circle' led by Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs.Kettler, D. (1971) ‚ÄòCulture and revolution‚Äô, Telos, 10, pp35-92. In the brief period of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, in 1919, Mannheim taught in the Pedagogical Institute of the University of Budapest thanks to the patronage of his friend and mentor Luk√°cs,Kar√°csony, A.

Karl Mannheim and the Contemporary Sociology of Knowledge, New York: St Martins Press, pp. 1-197. Both Mannheim and Luk√°cs were forced into exile after the rise of Horthy as Regent of Hungary. Mannheim chose exile in Germany and was there from 1920-1933.Kettler, D., Meja, V., and Stehr, N. (1984) Karl Mannheim, London, Tavistock. In 1921, he married psychologist Juliska K√°rolyn√© Lang, better known as Julia Lang. Though she is often unacknowledged, Lang collaborated with Mannheim on many of his works, and along with a number of Mannheim's students, put together many of his works to be published posthumously. After an unsuccessful attempt to gain a sponsor to teach philosophy in Heidelberg, Mannheim began work in 1924 under the German sociologist Alfred Weber, the brother of well-known sociologist Max Weber, and Emil Lederer.Werner, S. (1967). \\"Karl Mannheim\\", Encyclopedia of Philosophy, pp. 1. In 1926, Mannheim had his habilitation accepted by the faculty of social sciences, thus satisfying the requirements to teach classes in sociology at Heidelberg. Mannheim was chosen over other competitors for the post, one of whom was Walter Benjamin. From 1929-1933, he served as a professor of sociology and political economy at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main. Norbert Elias and Hans Gerth worked as his assistants from spring 1930 until spring 1933, with Elias as the senior partner. Greta Kuckhoff, who later became a prominent figure in the DDR, was his administrative assistant in Frankfurt, leaving early in 1933 to study at the London School of Economics (LSE) and prepare for Mannheim's emigration there.Bernd-Rainer Barth, Helmut M√ºller-Enbergs: Biographische Datenbanken: Kuckhoff, Greta Bundesunmittelbare Stiftung des √∂ffentlichen Rechts. Wer war wer in der DDR?, 5th edition, Volume 1 Ch. Links Verlag, Berlin (2010). In 1933, Mannheim was ousted from his professorship under the terms of the anti- Semitic law to purge the civil service and was forced into exile. After fleeing the Nazi regime and settling in Britain, Mannheim became a lecturer in Sociology at the London School of Economics, under a program to assist academic exiles, until his death. In 1941, Sir Fred Clarke, Director of the Institute of Education at the University of London, invited him to teach sociology on a part-time basis in conjunction with his declining role at LSE under wartime conditions. In January 1946 he was appointed as the first sociology professor at the Institute of Education, a position he held until his death in London a year later. During his time in England, Mannheim played a prominent role in 'The Moot', a Christian discussion group of which T.S. Eliot was also a member, concerned with the role of religion and culture in society, which was convened by J. H. Oldham. He gained a position of influence through his editorship of the extensive Routledge series on social sciences.225x225pxMannheim's life, one of intellectual and geographical migration, falls into three main phases: Hungarian (to 1919), German (1919‚Äì1933), British (1933‚Äì1947). Among his valued interlocutors were Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs, Oszk√°r J√°szi, Georg Simmel, Martin Heidegger, Edmund Husserl, Karl Marx, Alfred and Max Weber, Max Scheler, and Wilhelm Dilthey. In his work, he sought variously to synthesize elements derived from German historicism, Marxism, phenomenology, sociology, and Anglo-American pragmatism. =Death= Mannheim died in London.on January 9, 1947 at the age of 53 due to a congenitally weak heart. Shortly before his death, he was invited to be the head of the European UNESCO, an offer he was unfortunately not able to accept. He was cremated at Golder's Green Crematorium and his ashes were placed in the columbarium there in an urn, which were later mixed with those of his wife. He was originally placed opposite Sigmund Freud as a planned pairing, but Freud was later relocated.  Sociological work  = The Hungarian Phase (1919) = Mannheim was a precocious scholar and an accepted member of two influential intellectual circles in Budapest. In the autumn of 1915, he was the youngest founding memberLemert, Charles. \\"Social Theory: The Multicultural and Classic Readings.\\" Weslyan University. of the Sonntagskreis (Sunday Circle) alongside B√©la Bal√°zs, Lajos F√ºlep, and Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs, where a wide range of literary and philosophical topics where discussed.Mary Gluck (1985) Georg Luk√°cs and His Generation, 1900-1918. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. pp. 14‚Äì16 Some discussion focused on the enthusiasms of German diagnosticians of cultural crisis, but also the novels of Fyodor Dostoyevsky and the writings S√∏ren Kierkegaard and of the German mystics. The Social Science Association, on the other hand, was founded by Oszk√°r J√°szi in 1919 and was interested above all in French and English sociological writings. Mannheim's Hungarian writings, notably his doctoral dissertation \\"Structural Analysis of Epistemology,\\" anticipate his lifelong search for \\"synthesis\\" between these currents. According to the sociologist Longhurst, the Sonntagskreis \\"rejected any 'positivist' or 'mechanist' understanding of society and was dissatisfied with the existing political arrangements in Hungary. The way forward was seen to be through the spiritual renewal entailed in a revolution in culture\\". The group members were discontent with the political and intellectual composition of Hungary, however, \\"they rejected a materialist Marxist critique of this society. Hungary was to be changed by a spiritual renewal led by those who had reached a significant level of cultural awareness\\". Yet they did not exclude Marxist themes and Mannheim's work was influenced by Luk√°cs' Marxist interests, as he credits Marx as the forerunner to the sociology of knowledge.Ryan, Michael. \\"Karl Mannheim\\", Encyclopedia of Social Theory, pp. 469. = The German Phase (1919‚Äì1933) = This was Mannheim's most productive period, as this is when he turned from philosophy to sociology to inquire into the roots of culture. In the early part of his stay in Germany, Mannheim published his doctoral dissertation \\"Structural Epistemology of Knowledge\\", which discusses his theory of the structure of epistemology, the \\"relations between the knower, the known and the to be known‚Ä¶for Mannheim based on psychology, logic and ontology\\". Sociologist Brian Longhurst explains, his work on epistemology represents the height of his early \\"idealist\\" phase, and transition to hermeneutic \\"issues of interpretation within culture\\". In this essay, Mannheim introduces \\"the hermeneutic problem of the relationship between the whole and the parts\\". He argues the differences between art, the natural sciences, and philosophy \\"with respect to truth claims\\", stating science always tries to disprove one theory, where art never does this and can coexist in more than one worldview; philosophy falls in between the two extremes. Mannheim posits the \\"danger of relativism\\", in which historical process yields cultural product; \\"if thought to be relative to a historical period, it may be unavailable to a historical period\\" Mannheim's ambitious attempt to promote a comprehensive sociological analysis of the structures of knowledge was treated with suspicion by Marxists and neo-Marxists of the grouping that was later recognized as an antecedent of the Frankfurt School. They saw the rising popularity of the sociology of knowledge as neutralization and a betrayal of Marxist inspiration. Arguments between Mannheim and Horkheimer played out in faculty forums, like the Kant Gesellschaft and Paul Tillich's Christian Socialist discussion group. Horkheimer's Institute at the time was best known for the empirical work it encouraged, and several of Mannheim's doctoral students used its resources. While Mannheim and Horkheimer's contest looms large in retrospect, Mannheim's most active contemporary competitors were in fact other academic sociologists, notably the proto-fascist Leipzig professor, Hans Freyer, and the proponent of formal sociology and leading figure in the profession, Leopold von Wiese. Theory of the sociology of knowledge and sociology of culture Mannheim's theory on the sociology of knowledge is based on some of the epistemological discoveries of Immanuel Kant. Sociology of knowledge is known as a section of the greater field known as the sociology of culture. The idea of sociology of culture is defined as the relationship between culture and society.Remmling, Gunter W. \\"Karl Mannheim: Revision of an Intellectual Portrait.\\" Social Forces , Vol. 40, No. 1 (Oct., 1961) , pp. 23-30. There are two main branches of sociology of culture: a moderate branch and a radical branch. The moderate branch is represented by Max Scheler, who believed that social conditions do not affect the content of knowledge. The radical branch, on the contrary, highlighted that society is determined by all aspects of culture. When it came to the sociology of knowledge, Mannheim believed that it established a dependence of knowledge on social reality. Though Mannheim was far from being a Marxist, sociology of knowledge was largely based on Marx's theories regarding classes. Mannheim's central question of the sociology of knowledge, which tried to understand the relationship between society and knowledge, demonstrated his endeavors to solve the issue of \\"historical nature and unity of mind and life.\\" Mannheim affirmed the sociology of knowledge as an \\"extrinsic interpretation and sets apart from the immanent interpretation of thought products.\\" The immanent interpretation is based on one's understanding of intellectual content, which is limited to theoretical content of knowledge and the extrinsic interpretation is based on the capability to understand manifestations. Knowing the difference between these two types of interpretations helped Mannheim create a place for the sociology of knowledge in the scientific system, thus leaving the sociology of knowledge to stand opposite of the traditional human sciences and to interpret knowledge through an exploration of social reality. Mannheim claimed that the sociology of knowledge has to be understood as the visionary expression of \\"historical experience which has social reality at its vital center.\\" In 1920, a series of his essays were published in Germany under the name Essays in Sociology of Knowledge. These essays focused on the search for the meaning behind social reality, the notion of \\"truth\\" and the role of the empirical intellectual in search for these truths. Later in his life, after publishing Ideology and Utopia, Mannheim published Essays in Sociology of Culture in 1956 that basically served to merge his concern with social reality and democracy. According to Mannheim ideology was linked to a notion of reality, meanwhile culture focuses more so on the mind of the individual and how it perceives that reality, both, however, \\"still concerned with the role of the intelligentsia.\\" Ideology and Utopia (1929) Mannheim is most well known for his study and analysis of ideologies and utopias. One of his main ideas regarding utopias is what he considers the \\"utopian mentality\\", which Mannheim describes in four ideals types: # orgiastic chiliasm # liberal humanist utopias # the conservative idea which # modern communism In Ideology and Utopia, he argued that the application of the term ideology ought to be broadened. He traced the history of the term from what he called a \\"particular\\" view. This view saw ideology as the perhaps deliberate obscuring of facts. This view gave way to a \\"total\\" conception (most notably in Marx), which argued that a whole social group's thought was formed by its social position (e.g. the proletariat's beliefs were conditioned by their relationship to the means of production). However, he called for a further step, which he called a general total conception of ideology, in which it was recognized that everyone's beliefs‚Äîincluding the social scientist's‚Äîwere a product of the context they were created in. Thus, to Mannheim, \\"ideas were products of their times and of the social statuses of their proponents.\\" Mannheim points out social class, location and generation as the greatest determinants of knowledge. He feared this could lead to relativism but proposed the idea of relationism as an antidote. To uphold the distinction, he maintained that the recognition of different perspectives according to differences in time and social location appears arbitrary only to an abstract and disembodied theory of knowledge. The list of reviewers of the German Ideology and Utopia includes a remarkable roll call of individuals who became famous in exile, after the rise of Hitler: Hannah Arendt, Max Horkheimer, Herbert Marcuse, Paul Tillich, Hans Speier, G√ºnther Stern (aka G√ºnther Anders), Waldemar Gurian, Siegfried Kracauer, Otto Neurath, Karl August Wittfogel, B√©la Fogarasi, and Leo Strauss. In the early 1970s, Erich Fromm and Michael Maccoby would later illustrate scientifically the effects of social class and economic structure on personality in their landmark study Social Character in a Mexican Village. Out of all of his works, Mannheim's book Ideologie und Utopie was the most widely debated book by a living sociologist in Germany during the Weimar Republic. It was first published in German in 1929, with the English publication, Ideology and Utopia, following in 1936. This work has been a standard in American-style international academic sociology, carried by the interest it aroused in the United States. Mannheim and macro-sociology Mannheim's work was written mostly through a macrosociological lens. While writing Ideology and Utopia Mannheim's fundamental questions was \\"why does man behave different in the framework of different social group and class structure.\\" In answering this question, his intellectual contribution to sociology was focused more on social problems than sociological problems. The consolidation of his work focused on topics such as \\"social stability, social groups and the psychic differentials corresponding to social status or class cleavages.\\" To Mannheim the public was essential and fundamental to a democratic society. Therefore, assuring that not one ideology dictate all of the public is vital for the preservation of democracy. = The British Phase (1933‚Äì1947) = Monument to Karl Mannheim in Golder's Green Columbarium, part of Golder's Green Crematorium In his British phase Mannheim attempted a comprehensive analysis of the structure of modern society by way of democratic social planning and education. Mannheim's first major work published during this period was Man and Society in an Age of Reconstruction 1935, in which he argues for a shift from the liberal order of laissez-faire capitalism, \\"founded on the unregulated trade cycle, unextended democracy, free competition and ideas of competitive individualism\\" to planned democracy. In Diagnosis of Our Time, Mannheim expands on this argument and expresses concern for the transition from liberal order to planned democracy, according to Longhurst, arguing \\"...the embryonic planned democratic society can develop along democratic or dictatorial routes...as expressed in the totalitarian societies of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union\\". His work was admired more by educators, social workers, and religious thinkers than it was by the small community of British sociologists. His books on planning nevertheless played an important part in the political debates of the immediate post-war years, both in the United States and in several European countries. Legacy Mannheim's sociological theorizing has been the subject of numerous book-length studies, evidence of an international interest in his principal themes. Mannheim was not the author of any work he himself considered a finished book, but rather of some fifty major essays and treatises, most later published in book form. Selected works * Mannheim, K.

Krishna heroically carried away Rukmini, as per her wish, and eloped with her as they loved each other but her brother Rukmi out of envy had forbidden their marriage because Krishna killed his uncle Kamsa who was also a friend of Rukmi. He had arranged an unwanted marriage between Sri Rukmini Devi and the evil Shishupala who was a cousin of Krishna on the paternal side( His father Vasudeva of the Yadava/Vrishni clan had two sisters, one being Kunti and the other Srutashrava, mother of Shishupala ). Later Shrimati Rukmini wrote a beautiful love letter to Krishna to come and take her away (described in the Bhagavata Purana).She is the chief consort of Lord Krishna. Legends =Birth= According to traditional accounts, princess Rukmini is believed to have been born on Vaishakha 11 (Vaishakh Ekadashi). Although born of an earthly king, her position as an incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi is described throughout Puranic literature: * Goddess Lakshmi is forever united with the Lord. With Rama, Sri becomes Sita, when He is Krishna, she is Rukmini. In all the expansions of Narayan, Lakshmi is inseparable from Narayana.(Vishnu Purana 1.9.144) * A hero among the Kurus, the Supreme Lord himself, Govinda, married King Bhishmaka's daughter, Vaidarbhi Rukmini, who was a direct expansion of the Goddess of fortune [Sriyo maatraam]. (Bhagavata Purana 10.52.16) * Dwaraka's citizens were overjoyed to see Krishna, the Lord of all opulence, united with Rukmini, the Goddess of fortune Rama.(SB 10.54.60) * Lakshmi by Her portion took birth on earth as Rukmini in the family of Bhismaka.(Mahabharata Adi 67.156) * Rukmini, the Consort of Krishna is the Swarupa-shakti (Mulaprakriti), the essential potency of Krishna (Krsnatmika) and she is the shakti / Mother of the Divine World (Jagatkatri). * She was born in Vidarbha (today's Maharashtra) and a royal princess of Vidarbha Kingdom. The daughter of a powerful king Bhishmaka.She is the goddess of love , devotion,courage and mercy. The Shrutis which are closely associated with the narrations of the pastimes of the Vraja-gopis with Svayam-rupa Bhagavan Shri Krishna, the Parabrahma, have declared this truth (Gopala-tapani Upanisad 57). They cannot be separated. As Lakshmi is Vishnu's Shakti (power or strength) so even as Rukmini is Krishna's strength. The Idu-Mishmi tribe of Arunanchal Pradesh believes that Rukmini belonged to the Idu-Mishmi tribe.https://arunachaltimes.in/index.php/2018/03/28/a-twist-in-the-myth- rukminis-vague-arunachal-connection/ =Marriage= Rukmini was the daughter of Bhishmaka, the king of Vidarbha. She is the first most beautiful women at Dwaparyug. Bhismaka was the vassal of King Jarasandha of Magadha. She fell in love with and longed for Krishna, whose virtue, character, charm and greatness she had heard much of. Rukmini's eldest brother Rukmi though was a friend of evil King Kansa, who was killed by Krishna and was set against the marriage. Rukmini's parents wanted to marry Rukmini to Krishna but Rukmi, her brother strongly opposed it. Rukmi was an ambitious prince and he did not want to earn the wrath of Emperor Jarasandha, who was ruthless. Instead, he proposed that she be married to his friend Shishupala, the crown prince of Chedi and a cousin of Krishna. Shishupala was also a vassal and close associate of Jarasandha and hence an ally of Rukmi. Bhishmaka gave in but Rukmini, who had overheard the conversation was horrified and immediately sent for a brahmana, Sunanda, whom she trusted and asked him to deliver a letter to Krishna. She asked Krishna to come to Vidarbha and kidnap her to avoid a battle where her relatives may be killed. She said that he may wonder how will he accomplish this without any bloodshed, considering that she is in the inner apartments of her palace, but the solution to this problem was that she would have to visit the temple of Goddess Girija, who is their family deity. Rukmini asked that he use this occasion to claim her. Krishna, having received the message in Dwarka,said to brahmana,Sunanda that \\"Just as Rukmini's mind is fixed on Me, My mind is fixed on her. I can't even sleep at night. I know that Rukmi, out of envy, has forbidden our marriage. She has dedicated herself exclusively to me and her beauty is flawless. I will bring her here after thrashing those worthless kings in battle, just as one brings a blazing flame out of firewood.He then immediately set out for Vidarbha with Balarama, his elder brother.\\" Meanwhile, Shishupala was overjoyed at the news from Rukmi that he could simply go to Kundina (present-day Koundanyapur) Amravati district and claim Rukmini. Jarasandha, not so trusting, sent all his vassals and allies along because he felt that Krishna would certainly come to snatch Rukmini away.Meanwhile, at the palace, Rukmini got ready for her upcoming marriage.The brahmana messenger came and informed that Krishna had accepted her request. She went to the temple to offer her obeisances to Goddess Ambika, consort of Lord Shiva. As she stepped out, she saw Krishna and he soon swept her into his chariot with him. They both started to ride off when Shishupala noticed them. All of Jarasandha's forces quickly started chasing them. While Balarama occupied most of them and held them back Rukmi had almost caught up with Krishna and Rukmini. He overtook Krishna near Bhadrod. Krishna and Rukmi dueled with the inevitable result of Krishna's victory. Rukmi used abusive and offensive words for Rukmini for which Krishna was about to kill him, Rukmini fell at the feet of Krishna and begged that her brother's life be spared. Krishna, generous as always, agreed, but as punishment, shaved Rukmi's head and let him go free. There was no greater shame for a warrior than a visible sign of defeat. Rukmi was worshipped as Gaudera by villagers since he was defeated. He was known as the God of defeat and shame. Krishna and Rukmini, Government Museum, Chennai, India According to folklore, Krishna came to the village of Madhavpur Ghed after kidnapping and marrying Rukmini at this very place. In the memory of that event, there is a temple built for Madhavrai. A celebration of this event is held at Madhavpur in memory of this marriage every year in a cultural fair. At Dwaraka, Krishna and Rukmini were welcomed with great pomp and ceremony. =Tulabharam (weighing by scale)= Krishna with his two principal queens (from left): Rukmini, Krishna, Satyabhama and his vahana Garuda This story is absent in the main scriptures pertaining to Krishna's life. The Tulabharam is an incident in the life of Rukmini, that reveals the extent to which humble devotion is worth more than material wealth. Satyabhama, another queen of Krishna, prides herself about the love Krishna has for her and her grasp over his heart. Rukmini, on the other hand is a devoted wife, humble in her service of her Lord. Her devotion is her real inner beauty. On one occasion, sage Narada arrived in Dwaraka and in the course of conversation hinted to Satyabhama that the love that Krishna exhibits towards her is not all that real and in fact it is Rukmini who has real control over his heart. Unable to bear this, Satyabhama challenges Narada to prove it. Narada, with his way with words, tricked her into accepting a Vrata (ritual) where she has to give Krishna away in charity to Narada and reclaim him by giving the weight of Krishna in wealth. Narada lures her into accepting this vrata by telling her that Krishna's love to her will increase many folds if she succeeds in performing this Tulabharam. He also instigates her ego by hinting that her wealth may not be sufficient to equal the weight of Krishna. With Satyabhama's ego duly raised, she tells Narada that she can mobilize so much wealth that it is a child's play for her to outweigh Krishna. Narada warns her that if she is not able to do this, Krishna will become his slave to be done with as he pleases. The scene is soon set for the vrata. Satyabhama gives Krishna away in charity in spite of the other wives' pleadings. Krishna, always the mischievous cowherd, meekly submits to this drama. After donating Krishna to Narada, Satyabhama arranges for a big scale to be put up and sends with all assurance for her huge treasure of gold and jewelry. All that she has is soon put on the scale, but it doesn't budge. Narada starts taunting her and threatening her that if she can't put enough gold or diamonds, he will be forced to auction Krishna as a slave to someone else. Satyabhama, in frantic panic, swallows her pride and begs all the other wives to give their jewels. They agree out of love for Krishna but alas, it is of no use. Krishna remains a mute witness to all this drama and rubs salt into the open wounds of Satyabhama's ego that the king of Dwaraka will now become a slave to some rishi and will have to suffer the separation from his dear wife. Narada suggests to Satyabhama that Rukmini may be able to get her out of the predicament. She finally swallows her pride and appeals to the devoted first wife of Krishna. Rukmini comes and with a prayer to her husband puts a single leaf of the sacred Tulasi on the scale (tula). The scales then become all at once so heavy that even after removing all the jewels, the scales are weighed down on the side of the Tulasi leaf. While there are different versions in different texts as to why the weighing was arranged, the story of the Tulsi leaf placed by Rukmini being worth more in weight than that of Satyabhama's wealth is a common ending. This story is often repeated to enunciate the significance of Tulsi and how a humble offering to God is greater than any material wealth. =Sudama= Another well-known incident in Rukmini's married life is when Krishna's childhood friend, Sudama, visited Dwarka. Srimati Rukmini Maharani welcomed Sudama and gave him food. She and Krishna fanned him as he rested from his long journey. This type of devotion is a characteristic of Srimati Rukmini Maharani, that was very prevalent.

In 1996 several of Maxis' simulation games were re-released under the Maxis Collector Series with greater compatibility with Windows 95 and differing box art, including the addition of Classics beneath the title. SimEarth was re-released in 1997 under the Classics label.  Overview  In SimEarth, the player can vary a planet's atmosphere, temperature, landmasses, etc., then place various forms of life on the planet and watch them evolve. In the ‚ÄúRandom Planet‚Äù game setting, the game is a software toy, without any required goals. The big (and difficult) challenge is to evolve sentient life and an advanced civilization. The development stages of the planet can be restored and repeated, until the planet \\"dies\\" ten billion years after its creation, the estimated time when the Sun will become a red giant and kill off all of the planet's life. There are also eight scenarios that do have goals, the first three (Aquarium, Cambrian Earth, and Modern-day Earth) involving managing the evolution and development of Earth in different stages, four (Mars, Venus, Ice Planet, and Dune) involving terraforming other planets to support life, and the final scenario (Earth 2XXX) involving rescuing life and civilization on a future Earth from self-replicating robots and nuclear warfare and giving you the option of causing a great flood to help achieve this goal. In addition, there is another game mode besides Random Planet and Scenario mode, called Daisy World, where the only biome on the planet is daisies, which change their color relative to the temperature. The game models the Gaia hypothesis of James Lovelock (who assisted with the design and wrote an introduction to the manual), and one of the options available to the player is the simplified \\"Daisyworld\\" model. SimEarth screenshot, IBM PC version. In this simulated planet, radiates have developed sentience and are beginning to form civilizations. The player's control of the planet in the game is quite comprehensive; display panels allow the player to regulate everything from atmospheric gases, with percentages to three decimal places, to the rate of continental drift, to the rate of reproduction and mutation of lifeforms. In addition, the player is given options to place equipment or items that interfere with the planet's development, such as Oxygen Generators, which increase the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere, and the monolith, a take on the one found in 2001: A Space Odyssey, which aids in increasing intelligence of a lifeform through extraterrestrial contact. The list of disasters ranges from natural occurrences, such as hurricanes and wild fires, to population- dependent disasters, such as plagues and pollution. Effects on the planet may be minor or major depending on the current conditions. Increased volcanic eruptions, for example, increase the amount of dust in the atmosphere, lowering global temperature; earthquakes in a body of water may produce tsunamis; and the shortage of nuclear fuel for a nuclear power-dependent civilization may potentially trigger nuclear war and nuclear winter. Global warming can cause the planet's ice caps to melt and sea levels to rise, but if a planet gets very hot, the oceans boil away until there are no oceans left, only land. A planet without any water can have oceans brought back if hit by an \\"ice meteor\\" (a.k.a. a comet). Many things have to be kept within a certain balanced range for a planet to be able to support multicellular animal life; outside this range, only single-celled lifeforms, plants, robots, and lifeforms that have been civilized can survive. This excludes most lifeforms in this game since most are multicellular animals that are not civilized. All player-triggered actions have a cost specified in \\"energy units\\" or \\"omega (Œ©) units\\"; for example, 50 energy units are required to lay down a single terrain square, while 500 units are required to lay down a terraforming device. The energy budget is determined by the level of development of the planet, and the chosen difficulty level; on the lowest difficulty level, the energy budget is unlimited. Gameplay itself can be somewhat mystifying; species may thrive or die out for no apparent reason. Mass extinctions, however, are often followed by periods of renewed evolutionary diversification, allowing the player to experiment with new sets of species and ecosystems. =Taxa= A feature of the game is that all taxa of multicellular animals are on an equal footing, and thus it is possible to evolve, for example, sapient molluscs.{SimEarth User Manual, p. 143} The two single-celled lifeform taxa, Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes (or Bacteria and Amoebas, in-game respectively) are treated specially. Some examples of animal taxa include Radiates and Cetaceans as well as more well known taxa such as fish and birds. As an \\"Easter egg\\", there is also machine life, which can appear if a city of the highest technology level (Nanotech Age) is destroyed by a nuclear explosion. Machine life can thrive in any biome or environmental conditions, generally out-competing any other lifeforms present, and can itself eventually evolve intelligence and build cities. Additionally, there are Carniferns, which are mutated, carnivorous plants, which can occur only naturally. Having an abundance of insects allows for these life-forms to develop. Carniferns are able to develop intelligence just as animals can. In addition to the familiar types, the long-extinct \\"trichordates\\" are included. The game states that \\"We [the game's developers] felt sorry for them, and are giving them a chance for survival in SimEarth.\\" Dinosaurs are also an included taxa. =Civilization= Once an organism on your planet becomes sentient and develops civilization, it will gradually go through different stages of development with each successive stage being more technologically advanced than the last. * Stone Age, This stage is characterized by the use of stone tools and paleolithic lifestyles. * Bronze Age, This stage is characterized by the use of bronze tools, the invention of farming, the development of writing, and urbanization. * Iron Age, This stage is characterized by the use of Iron tools and is slightly more advanced than the Bronze Age. * Industrial Age, This stage is characterized by rapid industrialization and improving living standards. This stage is where resources are being rapidly consumed. Once this stage is achieved, energy requirements are high and global warming starts to threaten your planet's habitability. * Atomic Age, This stage is characterized by the use of nuclear energy. * Information Age, This stage is associated with the mass use of telecommunication technologies and computers. * Nanotech Age, This is the most challenging stage to reach due to depleting resources and the growing threat of global warming. It is associated with the use of nanotechnology and interplanetary space travel. Development The DOS version of SimEarth was released in December 1990, and was scheduled to release in Spring 1991 for the Amiga and Atari ST. Will Wright was introduced to James Lovelock by Stewart Brand, a former editor of CoEvolution Quarterly who lived near Wright, upon hearing about SimEarth. Lovelock advised the development team behind SimEarth, and particularly assisted with geophysical models. Lovelock stated in regards to the Gaia model that \\"Attempts to model the Earth through simple sciences such as biology or biochemistry fail because the models are oversensitive to initial conditions and prone to chaotic disturbance.\\" Gaia models link biology and geology however, which Lovelock claimed are \\"for some reason stable and able to resist perturbations.\\" Lovelock expressed that SimEarth's simulation has 'a degree of realism' despite it being \\"little more than a game\\", and he expressed that he hadn't seen or been involved in any computer simulations of nature on the scale of SimEarth at the time, noting that many professional climate models at the time didn't take clouds, the ocean, or biology into account. Reception Computer Gaming World called SimEarth \\"absolutely fascinating\\". The reviewer wished that the game had more SimCity-like visual feedback, but stated that it was superior to the predecessor because of larger scope and greater replayability. It won the 1991 Software Publishers Association Excellence in Software Awards for Best Secondary Education Program and Best Simulation Program. Entertainment Weekly gave the game an A- and wrote that \\"While it's never too early to teach kids to respect the biosphere, the same may not be true of introducing them to complicated simulations such as Simearth: The Living Planet (FCI, for Super NES), which has more variables (temperature, precipitation, etc.) than a polynomial equation. There's something to be said for this, though: A task as simple as 'growing a daisy'‚Äîone option offered here‚Äîrequires knowing far more than which button to push to cream the bad guy.\\" The One gave the DOS version of SimEarth an overall score of 95%, and expressed that the game is fun 'regardless of whether you know what you're doing or not', and said that experimenting with the simulation is \\"hours of fun\\". The One praised SimEarth's substantial gameplay, expressing that the game has \\"near-infinite variations with which to experiment.\\" The One noted the game as having \\"tremendous educational possibilities\\", but simultaneously being fun and engaging.

It is one of the most common forms found in classical chamber music. The term can also refer to a group of musicians who regularly play this repertoire together; for a number of well-known piano trios, see below. The term \\"piano trio\\" is also used in jazz, where it most commonly designates a pianist accompanied by bass and drums. Other jazz trios exist, such as piano, bass and guitar. Form Works titled \\"Piano Trio\\" tend to be in the same overall shape as a sonata. Initially this was in the three movement form, though some of Haydn's have two movements. Mozart, in five late works, is generally credited with transforming the accompanied keyboard sonata, in which the essentially optional cello doubles the bass of the keyboard left hand, into the balanced trio which has since been a central form of chamber music. With the early 19th century, particularly Beethoven, this genre was felt to be more appropriate to cast in the four movement form. Piano trios that are set in the Sonata tradition share the general concerns of such works for their era, and often are reflective directly of symphonic practice with individual movements laid out according to the composer's understanding of the sonata form. In the Classical period, home music-making made the piano trio a very popular genre for arrangements of other works. For example, Beethoven transcribed his first two symphonies for piano trio. Thus a large number of works exist for the arrangement of piano, violin and violoncello which are not generally titled or numbered as piano trios, but which are nonetheless part of the overall genre. These include single movements as well as sets of variations such as Beethoven's Variations on 'Ich bin der Schneider Kakadu' Op. 121a and Variations in E flat major Op. 44. After the classical era, works for piano and two instruments continue to be written which are not presented as in the sonata tradition, or are arrangements of other works. Many of these individual works are popular on concert programs, for example Suk's Elegie. For individual articles treating works for piano trio, see :Compositions for piano trio. The role of the three instruments The piano trios of the Classical era, notably those of Haydn, are dominated by the piano part. The violin plays the melody only a certain amount of the time, and when it does, is often doubled by the piano. The cello part is very much subordinated, usually just doubling the bass line in the piano. It is thought that this practice was quite intentional on Haydn's part and was related to the sonority of the instruments of Haydn's day: the piano was fairly weak and \\"tinkling\\" in tone, and benefited from the tonal strengthening of other instruments. Mozart's five late (K 496 and later) trios are generally felt to mark the assured arrival of the form, attentive to balanced voices and three-part dialogue. Beethoven's trios continued the compositional objectives inaugurated by Mozart. The new idea of equality was never implemented completely; the extent to which it is realized varies from one composition to the next, as well as among movements within a single composition. Certainly by the mid nineteenth century, all three instruments had been modified to have a very powerful sound, and each can hold its own in a modern ensemble. The earlier trios are now frequently performed and recorded using authentic instruments, of the kind for which they were originally written. Such performances restore the sonic balance the composer would have expected, and have proven popular. Other combinations Some rather rare combinations of instruments have nonetheless inspired a few outstanding works. *Haydn wrote three trios for flute, cello and piano (H. 15/15-17), a combination for which Carl Maria von Weber also wrote one work (op. 63). *Beethoven wrote his Trio in G major, WoO 37 (1786) for flute, bassoon and piano. *Mikhail Glinka wrote his Trio path√©tique in D minor for Clarinet, Bassoon and Piano, although is also performed with a Violin or Cello substituting the Clarinet or the Bassoon, respectively. *Francis Poulenc's Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano op. 43 (1926). *The Horn-violin-piano trio is exemplified by Brahms' Trio Op. 40 in E flat and Gy√∂rgy Ligeti's 1982 Trio for Violin, Horn and Piano. *Trios with clarinet include masterpieces such as Mozart's Kegelstatt Trio and works by Beethoven, Brahms and Bart√≥k; many more works are listed in Clarinet-violin-piano trio, Clarinet-viola-piano trio and Clarinet-cello-piano trio. *Ignaz Lachner wrote all of his six piano trios for violin, viola and piano. *The jazz trio formation of saxophone, piano and percussion has been taken up as an alternative \\"piano trio\\" in the field of contemporary classical music, initially by Trio Accanto who since 1994 have commissioned more than 100 works for this combination. Several other trios have been formed to perform this repertoire.

Originally, computer user interfaces were formed on CRTs. The phosphor was normally a very dark color, and lit up brightly when the electron beam hit it, appearing to be green or amber on black, depending on phosphors applied on a monochrome screen. RGB screens continued along a similar vein, using all the beams set to \\"on\\" to form white. With the advent of teletext, research was done into which primary and secondary light colors and combinations worked best for this new medium. Cyan or yellow on black was typically found to be optimal from a palette of black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white. Audio player with dark theme The opposite color scheme, dark-on-light color scheme, was originally introduced in WYSIWYG word processors to simulate ink on paper, and became the norm. While the debate of whether it is easier or healthier to read text on a dark background was disputed by vision and perception researchers, there was similar dispute between users. A 2018 article by Popular Science suggests that \\"Dark mode is easier on the eyes and battery\\" and displaying white on full brightness uses roughly six times as much power as pure black on a Google Pixel, which has an OLED display. Most popular operation systems (like Windows, Mac and for Mobile Android and iOS) now support \\"Dark Mode\\". Some apps and software are getting Dark Mode as well. Another example of dark desktop environment View of the NationStates web game in dark mode. Night mode may also be a display scheme using less blue light (whether dark on light, or otherwise), for example Night shift on Apple devices or Night mode on Android. Displays with less blue light may disrupt sleep less.  History  Dark backgrounds were added to Windows Phone 7 with energy consumption in mind since fully black pixels emit no light on OLED screens , and the default in earlier versions of Samsung TouchWiz. In 2017, YouTube added an optional dark theme. In November 2018, Google confirms dark mode on Android saves battery life. In December 2018, Samsung released One UI, which contains a dark mode. In June 2019, Apple announced that a light-on-dark mode will be available across all native applications in iOS 13 and iPadOS. It will also be possible for third-party developers to implement their own dark themes. In August 2019, Google announced an official shadow mode will come to Android with the release of Android 10. 2019: Google Drive on Android added dark theme In 2019, Reddit Introduced an optional dark theme. 2019: introduction of \\"prefers-color- scheme\\" for front-end web developers, a CSS property that signals a user's choice for their system to use a light or dark color theme. 2020: Facebook Introduced an optional dark theme. 2020: Firefox and Chromium (Google Chrome) Implemented optional dark theme for all internal screens, adding of dark theme started year before. In March 2020, WhatsApp announced dark mode for iOS and Android.  Energy usage  Light on dark color schemes require less energy to display on the most common display technologies, including as OLED, CRT and LCD displays. This positively impacts battery life and energy consumption. While an OLED will consume around 40% of the power of an LCD displaying an image that is primarily black, it can use more than three times as much power to display an image with a white background, such as a document or web site.Stokes, Jon. (2009-08-11) This September, OLED no longer \\"three to five years away\\" . Arstechnica.com. Retrieved 2011-10-04. This can lead to reduced battery life and energy usage unless a light-on-dark color scheme is used. The long-term reduced power usage may also prolong battery life or the useful life of the display and battery. The energy savings that can be achieved using a light-on-dark color scheme are because of how OLED screens work: in an OLED screen, each subpixel generates its own light and it only consumes power when generating light. This is in contrast to how an LCD works: in an LCD, subpixels either block or allow light from an always-on (lit) LED backlight to pass through. \\"AMOLED Black\\" color schemes (that use pure black instead of dark gray) do not necessarily save more energy than other light-on-dark color schemes that use dark gray instead of black, as the power consumption on an AMOLED screen decreases proportionately to the average brightness of the displayed pixels. Although it is true that AMOLED black does save more energy than dark gray, the additional energy savings are often negligible; AMOLED black will only give an additional energy saving of less than 1%, for instance, over the dark gray that's used in the dark theme for Google's official Android apps.  Issues with the web  Some argue that a color scheme with light text on a dark background is easier to read on the screen, because the lower overall brightness causes less eyestrain, Others argue to the contrary. The caveat is that most pages on the web are designed for white backgrounds; GIF and PNG images with a transparency bit instead of alpha channels tend to show up with choppy outlines, as well as causing problems with other graphical elements. It is not necessary that a web design work well with only one color scheme. There are many mechanisms of web architecture that allow designs to work well with any color scheme a user might prefer, and CSS adds \\"forced colors mode\\" for preferences, such as for \\"Dark Mode\\". This technical flexibility is a product of the web architect's concern for accessibility and user preference empowerment, though designers rarely utilize this technical flexibility. Wikipedia is an example of this.

After some early changes, the first stable lineup of the group consisted of Terry Hall and Neville Staple on vocals, Lynval Golding and Roddy Radiation on guitars, Horace Panter on bass, Jerry Dammers on keyboards, John Bradbury on drums, and Dick Cuthell and Rico Rodriguez on horns. Their music combines a \\"danceable ska and rocksteady beat with punk's energy and attitude\\". Lyrically, they present a \\"more focused and informed political and social stance\\". The band wore mod-style \\"1960s period rude boy outfits (pork pie hats, tonic and mohair suits and loafers)\\". In 1980, the song \\"Too Much Too Young\\", the lead track on their The Special AKA Live! EP, reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart. In 1981, the recession-themed single \\"Ghost Town\\" also hit No. 1 in the UK. After seven consecutive UK Top 10 singles between 1979 and 1981, main lead vocalists Hall and Staple, along with guitarist Golding, left to form Fun Boy Three. Continuing as \\"The Special AKA\\" (a name they used frequently on earlier Specials releases), a substantially revised Specials line-up issued new material through 1984, including the top 10 UK hit single \\"Free Nelson Mandela\\". After this, founder and songwriter Jerry Dammers dissolved the band and pursued political activism. The group reformed in 1993, and have continued to perform and record with varying line-ups, none of them involving Dammers. Career =Founding and early years (1977‚Äì78)= The group was formed in 1977 by songwriter/keyboardist Dammers, vocalist Tim Strickland, guitarist/vocalist Lynval Golding, drummer Silverton Hutchinson and bassist Horace Panter (a.k.a. Sir Horace Gentleman). Strickland was replaced by Terry Hall shortly after the band's formation. The band was first called the Automatics, then the Coventry Automatics. Vocalist Neville Staple and guitarist Roddy Byers (usually known as Roddy Radiation) joined the band the following year; the new line-up changed their name to the Special AKA. Joe Strummer of the Clash had attended one of their concerts, and invited the Special AKA to open for his band in their \\"On Parole\\" UK tour. This performance gave the Special AKA a new level of national exposure, and they briefly shared the Clash's management. The Specials began at the same time as Rock Against Racism, which was first organised in 1978. According to Dammers, anti-racism was intrinsic to the formation of the Specials, in that the band was formed with the goal of integrating black and white people. Many years later Dammers stated that \\"Music gets political when there are new ideas in music, ...punk was innovative, so was ska, and that was why bands such as the Specials and the Clash could be political\\".Sarfraz Manzoor The year rock found the power to unite The Guardian (London), 20 April 2008. Retrieved 12 March 2009. =Ascendancy of the Specials (1979‚Äì81)= In 1979, shortly after drummer Hutchinson left the band to be replaced by John Bradbury, Dammers formed the 2 Tone Records label and released the band's debut single \\"Gangsters\\", a reworking of Prince Buster's \\"Al Capone\\". The record became a Top 10 hit that summer. The band had begun wearing mod/rude boy/skinhead-style two-tone tonic suits, along with other elements of late 1960s teen fashions. Changing their name to the Specials, they recorded their eponymous debut album in 1979, produced by Elvis Costello. Horn players Dick Cuthell and Rico Rodriguez were featured on the album, but would not be official members of the Specials until their second album. The Specials led off with Dandy Livingstone's \\"Rudy, A Message to You\\" (slightly altering the title to \\"A Message to You, Rudy\\") and also had covers of Prince Buster and Toots & the Maytals songs from the late 1960s. In 1980, the EP Too Much Too Young (predominantly credited to the Special A.K.A.) was a No. 1 hit in the UK Singles Chart, despite controversy over the song's lyrics, which reference teen pregnancy and promote contraception. Reverting once again to the name of the Specials, the band's second album, More Specials, was not as commercially successful and was recorded at a time when, according to Hall, conflicts had developed in the band. Female backing vocalists on the Specials' first two studio albums included: Chrissie Hynde; Rhoda Dakar (then of the Bodysnatchers and later of the Special AKA); and Belinda Carlisle, Jane Wiedlin and Charlotte Caffey of the Go-Go's. In the first few months of 1981, the band took a break from recording and touring, and then released \\"Ghost Town\\", a non-album single, which hit No. 1 in 1981. At their Top of the Pops recording of the song, however, Staple, Hall and Golding announced they were leaving the band. Golding later said: \\"We didn't talk to the rest of the guys. We couldn't even stay in the same dressing room. We couldn't even look at each other. We stopped communicating. You only realise what a genius Jerry was years later. At the time, we were on a different planet.\\" Shortly afterwards, the three left the band to form Fun Boy Three. =Band split, rebirth as the Special AKA (1982‚Äì84)= For the next few years, the group was in a seemingly constant state of flux. Adding Dakar to the permanent line-up, the group recorded \\"The Boiler\\" with Dakar on vocals, Dammers on keyboards, Bradbury on drums, John Shipley (from the Swinging Cats) on guitar, Cuthell on brass and Nicky Summers on bass. The single was credited to \\"Rhoda with the Special AKA\\". The track describes an incident of date rape, and its frank and harrowing depiction of the matter meant that airplay was severely limited. Nevertheless, it managed to reach No. 35 on the UK charts, and American writer Dave Marsh later identified \\"The Boiler\\" as one of the 1,001 best \\"rock and soul\\" singles of all time in his book The Heart of Rock & Soul. After going on tour with Rodriguez, the band (without Dakar, and as \\"Rico and the Special AKA\\") also recorded the non-charting (and non-album) single \\"Jungle Music\\". The line-up for the single was Rodriguez (vocal, trombone), Cuthell (cornets), Dammers (keyboards), Bradbury (drums), Shipley (guitar), returning bassist Panter, and new additions Satch Dickson and Groco (percussion) and Anthony Wymshurst (guitar). Rodriguez and the three newcomers were all dropped for the next single, \\"War Crimes\\", which brought back Dakar and added new co-vocalists Edgio Newton and Stan Campbell, as well as violinist Nick Parker. Follow-up single \\"Racist Friend\\" was a minor hit (UK No. 60), with the band establishing themselves as a septet: Dakar, Newton, Campbell, Bradbury, Cuthell, Dammers and Shipley. The new line-up (still known as the Special AKA) finally issued a new full-length album In the Studio in 1984. Officially, the band was now a sextet: Dakar, Campbell, Bradbury, Dammers, Shipley and new bassist Gary McManus. Cuthell, Newton, Panter and Radiation all appeared on the album as guests; as did saxophonist Nigel Reeve, and Claudia Fontaine and Caron Wheeler of the vocal trio Afrodiziak. Both critically and commercially, In The Studio was less successful than previous efforts, although the 1984 single \\"Free Nelson Mandela\\" was a No. 9 UK hit. The latter contributed to making Mandela's imprisonment a cause c√©l√®bre in the UK, and became popular with anti-apartheid activists in South Africa. Dammers then dissolved the band and pursued political activism. Later developments Since the break-up of the original line-up, various members of the band performed in other bands and have reformed several times to tour and record in Specials-related projects. However, there has never been a complete reunion of the original line-up. After their departure from the Specials, Golding, Hall and Staple founded the pop band Fun Boy Three and enjoyed commercial success from 1981 to 1983 with hits such as \\"Tunnel of Love\\", \\"It Ain't What You Do (It's the Way That You Do It)\\", \\"Our Lips Are Sealed\\" and \\"The Lunatics (Have Taken Over the Asylum)\\". The group ended with Hall's sudden departure, leading to a 15-year rift with Staple.Neville Staple with Tony McMahon, Original Rude Boy: From Borstal to the Specials, Chapter 9: \\"Bhangra House\\". After Fun Boy Three, Staple and Golding joined Pauline Black of the Selecter in the short-lived band Sunday Best, releasing the single \\"Pirates on the Airwaves\\". In 1990, Bradbury, Golding, Panter and Staple teamed up with members of the Beat to form Special Beat, performing the music of the two bands and other ska and Two Tone classics. The group, undergoing many line-up changes, toured and released several live recordings through the 1990s. A 1994 single credited to \\"X Specials\\" featured Neville, Lynval, Roddy, and Horace. A cover of the Slade song \\"Coz I Love You\\", the project was produced by Slade's Jim Lea. Moving into production and management, Staple \\"discovered\\" and produced bhangra pop fusion artist Johnny Zee. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Staple would stay active producing and guesting with a variety of artists, including International Beat, Special Beat, Unwritten Law, Desorden Publico, the Planet Smashers and others, as well as leading his own bands and starting the Rude Wear clothing line. He sang with the 1990s Specials line-up, and again from 2009 to 2012. Panter went on to join with members of the Beat and Dexys Midnight Runners to form General Public, and then Special Beat. He joined the 1990s Specials before training as a primary school teacher at the University of Central England in Birmingham. He continued to play with latter-day Special Neol Davies in the blues outfit Box of Blues. However, he rejoined the band for their 2009 reunion and continues as a member. Golding teamed up with Dammers for a brief spell of club DJing, and then worked with Coventry band After Tonight. After Special Beat, he went on to lead the Seattle-based ska groups Stiff Upper Lip, and more recently, Pama International, as well as many collaborations with other ska bands. He has also toured with the Beat. He joined the 1990s Specials line-up, but left in 2000. He rejoined in 2009, and continues with the group. Radiation fronted and worked with numerous artists including the Tearjerkers (a band that he had begun in the last months of the Specials), the Bonediggers, the Raiders and Three Men & Black (including Jean- Jacques Burnel of the Stranglers), Jake Burns (Stiff Little Fingers), Pauline Black, Bruce Foxton (the Jam), Dave Wakeling (the Beat, General Public) and Nick Welsh (Skaville UK). He also fronts the Skabilly Rebels, a band that mixes rockabilly with ska. He joined the 1990s Specials line-up and again in 2009, continuing to 2014. Bradbury continued through the Special AKA era, then formed the band JB's Allstars, before moving into production. He joined Special Beat for several years, then a reformed Selecter, before retiring from music to work as an IT specialist.Neville Staple with Tony McMahon, Original Rude Boy: From Borstal to the Specials; Chapter 10: \\"The Third Wave ‚Äì America Revives Ska\\". He rejoined the band for their 2009 reunion, and continued to perform with them until his death in 2015. From 1984 until 1987, Hall fronted the Colourfield, with some commercial success. After they disbanded, Hall pursued a solo career, working mostly in the new wave genre. He co-wrote a number of early Lightning Seeds releases. He also performed some vocals for a Dub Pistols album. He and Eurythmics member David A. Stewart formed the duo Vegas in the early 1990s, releasing an eponymous album in 1992. Hall joined the Specials for their 2009 reunion, and continues to perform with them. In 2006, Dammers formed large, jazz-style ensemble the Spatial AKA Orchestra. Reunions and current events The first reunion under the Specials name occurred in 1993, when producer Roger Lomas decided to use the Specials as backing band for a new album by ska legend Desmond Dekker. Only Golding, Panter, Radiation and Staple were willing to participate. They were joined in the studio by former Selecter drummer Charley Harrington \\"Aitch\\" Bembridge, who had also played with soul singer Ray King in the 1970s, who mentored and worked with Dammers, Staple, Golding and Hutchinson in their days before the Specials.Original Rude Boy: From Borstal to the Specials by Neville Staple with Tony McMahon; Chapter 4: The Specials ‚Äì The Rude Boys Arrive A group of studio musicians filled out the band, including keyboardist Mark Adams. The album, released by Trojan Records as King of Kings, was credited to Desmond Dekker and the Specials. After the Dekker recording was finished, Lomas brought the group back into the studio to record a number of classic songs from the Trojan Records back catalogue. Two weeks before this project, Golding left the group to concentrate on domestic life in Seattle. Turning to another Selecter veteran for help, the band replaced him on guitar with Neol Davies. Davies, Staple, Radiation and Panter, joined by a group of session musicians, recorded a wealth of tracks that eventually saw release by Trojan sub-label Receiver Records as Skinhead Girl in 2000 and Conquering Ruler in 2001. The release of the album with Desmond Dekker created some buzz for the band, and led to an offer from a Japanese promoter to book a tour. Rejoined by Golding, along with Bembridge & Adams from the \\"King of Kings\\" sessions, the band added horn players Adam Birch and Jonathan Read and began rehearsing and playing live. Initially using the names the Coventry Specials, The X Specials, and Specials2, they shortly reverted to The Specials after accepting that it was the name promoters were using anyway,Paul Williams, You're Wondering Now ‚Äì The Specials from Conception to Reunion; Part Two: \\"More Specials ‚Äì Roddy Radiation\\". although the line-up was referred to as Specials MkII by those involved. This line-up went on to tour internationally and released two studio albums: Today's Specials, a collection of mostly reggae and ska covers in 1996,name=\\"The Great Rock Discography\\"/Today's Specials, and Guilty 'til Proved Innocent! in 1998, a collection of original compositions. The band toured heavily in support of both releases - including headlining the Vans Warped Tour - and received positive reviews of their live shows. Despite the live success, the band fizzled out after a 1998 Japan tour (which Panter missed due to illnessYou're Wondering Now ‚Äì The Specials from Conception to Reunion, by Paul Willams; Part Two: More Specials ‚Äì Horace Panter), although limited touring with a different line-up continued into 2000. The release of the earlier Trojan sessions, Skinhead Girl in 2000 and Conquering Ruler in 2001, would be the last heard from the band for some time. In 2007, Hall teamed up with Golding for the first time in 24 years, to play Specials songs at two music festivals. At Glastonbury Festival, they appeared on the Pyramid Stage with Lily Allen to perform \\"Gangsters\\". In May 2009, Golding claimed that Allen's reuniting him with Hall played a \\"massive part\\" in the group's later reformation. Later the same day, they played on the Park Stage, with Damon Albarn of Blur on piano and beatboxer Shlomo providing rhythm, to perform \\"A Message to You, Rudy\\". At GuilFest, Golding joined the Dub Pistols to again perform \\"Gangsters\\". In 2007, Golding regularly performed concerts and recorded with Pama International, a collective of musicians who were members of Special Beat. The Specials performing at Brixton Academy, London, May 2009 as part of their 30th anniversary tour On 30 March 2008, Hall stated that the Specials would be reforming for tour dates in autumn 2008, and possibly for some recording. This was officially confirmed on 7 April 2008. On 6 September 2008, six members of the band performed on the main stage at the Bestival, billed as the \\"Surprise Act\\". By December 2008, the band had announced 2009 tour dates to celebrate their 30th anniversary, although founder member Dammers was not joining the band on the tour. Hall was quoted as saying, \\"The door remains open to him\\". However, Dammers described the new reunion as a \\"takeover\\" and claimed he had been forced out of the band. Around that same time, longtime Specials fan Amy Winehouse joined Dammers onstage at Hyde Park, singing the song he wrote for the Specials, \\"Free Nelson Mandela\\", for Mandela's 90th birthday concert, dubbed 46664 after Mandela's prison number, and also the name of his AIDS charity, which received money raised by the birthday bash. On 10 April 2009, the Specials guested on BBC Two's Later... with Jools Holland. The following month, Bradbury and Golding expressed their intentions to release further original Specials material at a later date. On 8 June 2009, it was announced that the Specials would embark on a second leg of their 30th anniversary tour, taking in the locations and venues that they missed earlier in the year. In July and August 2009, the Specials toured Australia and Japan. In October, the band picked up the Inspiration Award at the Q Awards. In 2010, they performed at the Dutch festival Lowlands. In an interview at the Green Room in Manchester in November 2010, Hall confirmed that there would be further Specials dates in the autumn of 2011, and confessed to having enjoyed playing live again: \\"It's a celebration of something that happened in your life that was important, and we're going to do that again next year, but then maybe that'll be it\\". In late 2010, the band re-released \\"A Message to You, Rudy\\" as a Haiti Special Fund available to download from iTunes in both the UK and the US, with proceeds going to aid the UNICEF effort to help children in earthquake-stricken Haiti. In February 2012, it was announced that the Specials would perform at Hyde Park with Blur and New Order to celebrate the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. Panter said that the band were excited to be involved in such a momentous event: \\"We have been keeping it under our pork pie hats for a month or so now. I think it is going to be the only chance people get to see the Specials performing in the UK this year.\\" The Specials' performance was said to have remained synonymous with Britain's political and social upheaval of the late 1970s and early 1980s. M√©tropolis, Montreal, 7 July 2013 In August 2012, the Specials released a new live album, More... Or Less. ‚Äì The Specials Live, featuring \\"the best of the best\\" performances from their 2011 European tour, selected by the band themselves on a double-disc CD and double-vinyl LP. In January 2013, the Specials announced the departure of Staple with the following message on their website: \\"We are very sad Neville cannot join us on the Specials' UK tour in May 2013 or indeed on the future projects we have planned. He has made a huge contribution to the fantastic time and reception we have received since we started and reformed in 2009. However, he missed a number of key shows last year due to ill health, and his health is obviously much more important. We wish him the very best for the future\\". The Specials completed a North American tour in 2013, performing to sold-out crowds in Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland and Vancouver. In February 2014, it was revealed that Roddy Radiation had left the reformed group. In spite of his departure, the Specials played an extensive tour in the autumn of 2014 with Steve Cradock (Ocean Colour Scene, Paul Weller) as lead guitarist. Drummer John Bradbury died on 28 December 2015 at the age of 62. On 22 March 2016, the Specials announced that The Libertines drummer Gary Powell would be performing on their upcoming tours. Powell was replaced by PJ Harvey/Jazz Jamaica drummer Kenrick Rowe on the Encore album and subsequent tour. On 29 October 2018, the Specials announced a forthcoming UK tour in 2019 to coincide with the release of a new album, Encore. On 1 February 2019, the band announced a Spring North American tour to promote the 1 February 2019 release of Encore (out via Island Records). The following week, Encore debuted at number 1 on the UK Albums Chart, giving the band their first chart-topping album since 1980.

California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court modifying its definition of obscenity from that of \\"utterly without socially redeeming value\\" to that which lacks \\"serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value\\".. It is now referred to as the three-prong standard or the Miller test. Background In 1971, Marvin Miller, an owner/operator of a California mail-order business specializing in pornographic films and books, sent out a brochure advertising books and a film that graphically depicted sexual activity between men and women. The brochure used in the mailing contained graphic images from the books and the film. Five of the brochures were mailed to a restaurant in Newport Beach, California. The owner and his mother opened the envelope and seeing the brochures, called the police.John Henry Merryman, albert Edward Elsen, Stephen K. Urice, Law, Ethics, and the Visual Arts, (Frederick, MD: Aspen Publishers, 2007) 687 Miller was arrested and charged with violating California Penal Code 311.2(a) which says in part, \\"Every person who knowingly sends or causes to be sent, or brings or causes to be brought, into this state for sale or distribution, or in this state possesses, prepares, publishes, produces, or prints, with intent to distribute or to exhibit to others, or who offers to distribute, distributes, or exhibits to others, any obscene matter is for a first offense, guilty of a misdemeanor.\\" California lawmakers wrote the statute based on two previous Supreme Court obscenity cases, Memoirs v. Massachusetts. and Roth v. United States... Miller was tried by jury in the Superior Court of Orange County. At the conclusion of the evidence phase, the judge instructed the jury to evaluate the evidence by the community standards of California, i.e., as defined by the statute. The jury returned a guilty verdict. Miller appealed to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court, arguing that the jury instructions did not use the standard set in Memoirs v. Massachusetts which said that in order to be judged obscene, materials must be \\"utterly without redeeming social value.\\" Miller argued that only a national standard for obscenity could be applied. The appellate division rejected the argument and affirmed the jury verdict. Miller then filed an appeal with the California Court of Appeal for the Third District, which declined to review. Miller applied to the Supreme Court for certiorari, which was granted. Oral arguments were heard in January 1972. Previous Supreme Court decisions on obscenity The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari to Miller because the California law was based on its two previous obscenity cases which the Court wanted to revisit. Chief Justice Warren Burger came to the Court in 1969 believing that the Court's obscenity jurisprudence was misguided and governments should be given more leeway to ban obscene materials. In consideration of Miller in May and June 1972, Burger pushed successfully for a looser definition of \\"obscenity\\" which would allow local prosecutions, while Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., who by now also believed the Roth and Memoirs tests should be abandoned, led the charge for protecting all \\"obscenity\\" unless distributed to minors or exposed offensively to unconsenting adults. Decision of the case was contentious, and Miller was put over for reargument for October term in 1972, and did not come down until June 1973, with Burger prevailing with a 5‚Äì4 vote. Since the Court's decision in Roth v. United States, the Court had struggled to define what constituted constitutionally unprotected obscene material. Under the Comstock laws that prevailed before Roth, articulated most famously in the 1868 English case Regina v. Hicklin, any material that tended to \\"deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences\\" was deemed \\"obscene\\" and could be banned on that basis. Thus, works by Honor√© de Balzac, Gustave Flaubert, James Joyce, and D. H. Lawrence were banned based on isolated passages and the effect they might have on children. Roth repudiated the \\"Hicklin test\\" and defined obscenity more strictly, as material whose \\"dominant theme taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest\\" to the \\"average person, applying contemporary community standards\\". Only material now meeting this test could be banned as \\"obscene\\". In Memoirs v. Massachusetts, a plurality of the Court further redefined the Roth test by holding unprotected only that which is \\"patently offensive\\" and \\"utterly without redeeming social value,\\" but no opinion in that case could command a majority of the Court either, and the state of the law in the obscenity field remained confused. In Jacobellis v. Ohio, Justice Potter Stewart's concurring opinion said that the Court in earlier pornography cases \\"was faced with the task of trying to define what may be indefinable\\", and that criminal laws were constitutionally limited to \\"hard-core pornography\\", which he did not try to define: \\"perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it.\\" (Stewart, J., concurring); . Other Justices, including Justice Hugo Black in Mishkin v. New York, had equally been unwilling to clearly define what pornography could be prohibited by the First Amendment. Supreme Court decision Miller had based his appeal in California on Memoirs v. Massachusetts. The Court rejected that argument. The question before the court was whether the sale and distribution of obscene material was protected under the First Amendment's guarantee of Freedom of Speech. The Court ruled that it was not. It indicated that \\"obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment\\", especially that of hardcore pornography, thereby reaffirming part of Roth.Miller, 413 U.S. at 36.Miller, 413 U.S. at 27. \\"Under the holdings announced today, no one will be subject to prosecution for the sale or exposure of obscene materials unless these materials depict or describe patently offensive 'hard core' sexual conduct specifically defined by the regulating state law, as written or construed.\\" However, the Court acknowledged \\"the inherent dangers of undertaking to regulate any form of expression\\", and said that \\"State statutes designed to regulate obscene materials must be carefully limited.\\"Miller, 413 U.S. at 23-24. The Court, in an attempt to set such limits devised a set of three criteria which must be met for a work to be legitimately subject to state regulation: # whether the average person, applying contemporary \\"community standards\\", would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; # whether the work depicts or describes, in an offensive way, sexual conduct or excretory functions, as specifically defined by applicable state law (the syllabus of the case mentions only sexual conduct, but excretory functions are explicitly mentioned on page 25 of the majority opinion); and # whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.Miller, 413 U.S. at 24-25. This obscenity test overturns the definition of obscenity set out in the Memoirs decision, which held that \\"all ideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance ... have the full protection of the guaranties [of the First Amendment]\\" and that obscenity was that which was \\"utterly without redeeming social importance\\". The Miller decision vacated the jury verdict and remanded the case back to the California Superior Court.  Definition of obscenity post-Miller Miller provided states greater freedom in prosecuting alleged purveyors of \\"obscene\\" material because, for the first time since Roth, a majority of the Court agreed on a definition of \\"obscenity\\". Hundreds of \\"obscenity\\" prosecutions went forward after Miller, and the Supreme Court began denying review of these state actions after years of reviewing many \\"obscenity\\" convictions (over 60 appeared on the Court's docket for the 1971‚Äì72 term, pre-Miller). A companion case to Miller, Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, provided states with greater leeway to shut down adult movie houses. Controversy arose over Miller's \\"community standards\\" analysis, with critics charging that Miller encouraged forum shopping to prosecute national producers of what some believe to be \\"obscenity\\" in locales where community standards differ substantially from the rest of the nation. For example, under the \\"community standards\\" prong of the Miller test, what might be considered \\"obscene\\" in Massachusetts might not be considered \\"obscene\\" in Utah, or the opposite might be true; in any event, prosecutors tend to bring charges in locales where they believe that they will prevail. Justice Brennan, author of the Roth opinion, argued in his dissent for Paris Adult Theatre that outright suppression of obscenity is too vague to enforce in line with the First and Fourteenth Amendments.. The standards established by Miller were elaborated upon in Pope v. Illinois in 1987.. In the case, the jury instructions for the local court had been for the jurors to evaluate whether adult magazines had value according to a community standard, and the conviction was held by the Illinois appellate court. The Supreme Court overruled the appellate court decision, siding with the defendant. In the majority opinion, the Supreme Court held that the first two prongs of the test were to be evaluated according to a \\"community standard,\\" but not the third, which was to be held to the higher standard of a \\"reasonable person\\" evaluating the work for value.Congressional Research Service, Obscenity, Child Pornography, and Indecency: Brief Background and Recent Developments, 1 (January 20, 2010). In 1987, Oregon became the first state to strike down the criminalization of obscenity. In State v. Henry, the Oregon Supreme Court ruled in favor of Earl Henry, the owner of an adult bookstore, stating that the state obscenity statute violated the free speech provision of Oregon's state constitution. Most recently, in 1997, the Supreme Court ruled in Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union that the anti-indecency provisions of the Communications Decency Act were unconstitutional.. The Act had criminalized the sending of \\"obscene or indecent\\" material to minors over the Internet. The court unanimously ruled that the provision violated the First Amendment due to its burden on free speech. Effects of the decision In the years since Miller, many localities have cracked down on adult theatres and bookstores, as well as nude dancing, through restrictive zoning ordinances and public nudity laws. Additionally, in 1982's New York v. Ferber the Court declared child pornography as unprotected by the First Amendment, upholding the state of New York's ban on that material.. In the 2002 Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition case, however, the Court held that sexually explicit material that only appears to depict minors, but actually does not, might be exempt from obscenity rulings.. In American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression v. Strickland, plaintiffs American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression, joined by various publishers, retailers, and web site operators, sued Ohio's Attorney General and Ohio county prosecutors in United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Plaintiffs alleged that Ohio Revised Code ¬ß2907.01(E) and (J), which prohibited the dissemination or display of \\"materials harmful to juveniles\\", unconstitutionally violated both the First Amendment and the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. Plaintiffs specifically challenged the statute's definition of \\"harmful to juveniles\\", as well as the provisions governing Internet dissemination of those materials. The court held the statute unconstitutional because the statute's definition of \\"material harmful to minors\\" did not comply with Miller. The \\"community standards\\" portion of the decision is of particular relevance with the rise of the Internet, as materials believed by some to be \\"obscene\\" can be accessed from anywhere in the nation, including places where there is a greater concern about \\"obscenity\\" than other areas of the nation. Enforcing and applying obscenity laws to the Internet have proven difficult. Both the Child Pornography Prevention Act (CPPA) and the Child Online Protection Act (COPA) have had sections struck down as unconstitutional in cases such as Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition and Ashcroft v. ACLU.

City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377 (1992), is a case of the United States Supreme Court in which the Supreme Court unanimously struck down St. Paul's Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance and reversed the conviction of a teenager, referred to in court documents only as R.A.V., for burning a cross on the lawn of an African-American family for violating the First Amendment's protections for freedom of speech.. Facts and procedural background In the early morning hours of June 21, 1990, the petitioner and several other teenagers allegedly assembled a crudely made cross by taping together broken chair legs. The cross was erected and burned in the front yard of an African American family that lived across the street from the house where the petitioner was staying. Petitioner, who was a juvenile at the time, was charged with two counts, one of which a violation of the St. Paul Bias- Motivated Crime Ordinance. The Ordinance provided; Petitioner moved to dismiss the count under the Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance on the ground that it was substantially overbroad and impermissibly content based, and therefore facially invalid under the First Amendment.505 U.S. at 380. The trial court granted the motion, but the Minnesota Supreme Court reversed, rejecting petitioner's overbreadth claim because, as the Minnesota Court had construed the Ordinance in prior cases, the phrase \\"arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others\\" limited the reach of the ordinance to conduct that amounted to fighting words under the Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire decision.505 U.S. at 380-381. The Minnesota Court also concluded that the ordinance was not impermissibly content based, because \\"the ordinance is a narrowly tailored means towards accomplishing the compelling governmental interest in protecting the community against bias-motivated threats to public safety and order.\\"In re Welfare of R.A.V., 464 N.W.2d 507, 510 (Minn. 1991). Petitioner appealed, and the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari.. Decision Justice Antonin Scalia delivered the opinion of the court, in which Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Justice Anthony Kennedy, Justice David Souter, and Justice Clarence Thomas joined. Justice Byron White wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment, which Justice Harry Blackmun and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor joined in full, and Justice John Paul Stevens joined in part. Justice Blackmun wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment. Justice Stevens wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment, which was joined in part by Justice White and Justice Blackmun.Justice Scalia, who wrote the majority opinion in R.A.V. =The majority decision= The Court began with a recitation of the relevant factual and procedural background, noting several times that the conduct at issue could have been prosecuted under different Minnesota statutes.505 U.S. at 379‚Äì380, N.1. In construing the ordinance, the Court recognized that it was bound by the construction given by the Minnesota Supreme Court.505 U.S. at 381. Therefore, the Court accepted the Minnesota court's conclusion that the ordinance reached only those expressions that constitute \\"fighting words\\" within the meaning of Chaplinsky. Petitioner argued that the Chaplinsky formulation should be narrowed, such that the ordinance would be invalidated as \\"substantially overbroad,\\" but the Court declined to consider this argument, concluding that even if all of the expression reached by the ordinance was proscribable as \\"fighting words,\\" the ordinance was facially unconstitutional in that it prohibited otherwise permitted speech solely on the basis of the subjects the speech addressed. The Court began its substantive analysis with a review of the principles of free speech clause jurisprudence, beginning with the general rule that the First Amendment prevents the government from proscribing speech,. or even expressive conduct,Texas v. Johnson, because of disapproval of the ideas expressed.505 U.S. at 382. The Court noted that while content-based regulations are presumptively invalid, society has permitted restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas, which are \\"of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.\\"505 U.S. at 382‚Äì383, citing . The Court then clarified language from previous free speech clause cases, including Roth v. United States, Beauharnais v. Illinois, and Chaplinsky that suggested that certain categories of expression are \\"not within the area of constitutionally protected speech,\\" and \\"must be taken in context.\\"505 U.S. at 383. The Court's clarification stated that this meant that certain areas of speech \\"can, consistently with the First Amendment, be regulated because of their constitutionally proscribable content (obscenity, defamation, etc.)‚Äînot that they are categories of speech entirely invisible to the Constitution, so that they may be made the vehicles for content discrimination.\\"505 U.S. at 383-384, emphasis in original Thus, as one of the first of a number of illustrations that Justice Scalia would use throughout the opinion, the government may \\"proscribe libel, but it may not make the further content discrimination of proscribing only libel critical of the government.\\"505 U.S. at 384. The Court recognized that while a particular utterance of speech can be proscribed on the basis of one feature, the Constitution may prohibit proscribing it on the basis of another feature.505 U.S. at 385. Thus, while burning a flag in violation of an ordinance against outdoor fires could be punishable, burning a flag in violation of an ordinance against dishonoring the flag is not. In addition, other reasonable \\"time, place, or manner\\" restrictions were upheld, but only if they were \\"justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.\\".505 U.S. at 386. The Court recognized two final principles of free speech jurisprudence. One of these described that when \\"the entire basis for the content discrimination consists entirely of the very reason the entire class of speech is proscribable, no significant danger of idea or viewpoint discrimination exists.\\" As examples, Justice Scalia wrote, The other principle of free speech jurisprudence was recognized when the Court wrote that a valid basis for according different treatment to a content-defined subclass of proscribable speech is that the subclass \\"happens to be associated with particular 'secondary effects' of the speech, so that 'the regulation is justified without reference to the content of the ... speech'\\"505 U.S. at 389, quoting Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., (emphasis in original). As an example, the Court wrote that a State could permit all obscene live performances except those involving minors.505 U.S. at 389. Applying these principles to the St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance, the Court concluded that the ordinance was facially unconstitutional. Justice Scalia explained the rationale, writing, The Court went on to explain that, in addition to being an impermissible restriction based on content, the Ordinance was also viewpoint- based discrimination, writing, Displays containing some words, such as racial slurs, would be prohibited to proponents of all views, whereas fighting words that \\"do not themselves invoke race, color, creed, religion, or gender‚Äîaspersions upon a person's mother, for example‚Äîwould seemingly be usable ad libitum in the placards of those arguing in favor of racial, color, etc., tolerance and equality, but could not be used by those speakers' opponents.\\" The Court concluded that \\"St. Paul has no such authority to license one side of a debate to fight freestyle, while requiring the other to follow Marquess of Queensberry rules.\\" The Court concluded, \\"Let there be no mistake about our belief that burning a cross in someone's front yard is reprehensible. But St. Paul has sufficient means at its disposal to prevent such behavior without adding the First Amendment to the fire.\\"505 U.S. at 396. Limitation In Virginia v. Black (2003), the United States Supreme Court deemed constitutional part of a Virginia statute outlawing the public burning of a cross if done with an intent to intimidate, noting that such expression \\"has a long and pernicious history as a signal of impending violence.\\".

The screenplay by Zo√´ Akins was adapted from Timothy Shea's novel of the same name. It stars Ruth Chatterton, Fredric March, Gilbert Emery, and Doris Lloyd. It was filmed at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles and released by Paramount Pictures. Plot Sarah Storm, an Austrian immigrant, has taken up with Jim Grey, with the goal of both of them becoming vaudeville entertainers. Months after their stage debut, they now have a baby boy and no steady income, and Jim expresses little interest in finding work or supporting the family. After a fight with Sarah, Jim tries to get a loan from John Ashmore, a wealthy businessman, who denies his request, but mentions his envy at Jim's fatherhood, since his wife cannot bear children. On a whim, Jim enlists with the Marines for four years, and goes drinking. After returning home and quarreling again with Sarah, he disappears with their young son Bobby, intending to sell him to the Ashmores. The heartbroken Sarah is given a job singing with an itinerant musician, Cyril Belloc. Two years later, Cyril and Sarah perform for WWI veterans in a hospital. As she goes among the beds of the wounded soldiers, she finds Jim there, near death. He begs forgiveness for his actions, and tells her about giving her son to the Ashmores. When she pleads with John Ashmore to let her see if their son is hers, Ashmore refuses, threatening to have her committed; their attorney, Howard Vanning, who is also Ashmore's brother-in-law, takes pity on her and says he will try to help, but also believes her delusional. Sarah leaves America for Germany to pursue her singing career. Years later, Sarah has become an internationally famous opera singer, and returns to New York to perform. She reconnects with Vanning, declares she is no longer afraid of any threats the Ashmores can levy against her, and again demands to meet the boy, saying a birthmark will prove her is her son. Meanwhile, Bobby is now 13, and unhappy with the too-protective Ashmores, confiding to his uncle Howard that he fears being incapable of being a self-sufficient man. Still refusing to agree to a meeting, Mrs. Ashmore presents in his stead the deaf mute son of one of their servants, hoping this will convince Sarah he is not her son. Bobby, unbeknownst to his adoptive parents, runs away to the summer house of his uncle Howard. Howard, who is now fully in love with Sarah, brings her to the house unaware of Bobby's presence, and finally engineers an encounter between them.

Daryl Hall is generally the lead vocalist; John Oates primarily plays electric guitar and provides backing vocals. The two write most of the songs they perform, separately or in collaboration. They achieved their greatest fame from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s with a fusion of rock and roll and rhythm and blues. Hall and Oates have sold an estimated 40 million records. They have had six No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100: \\"Rich Girl\\", \\"Kiss on My List\\", \\"Private Eyes\\", \\"I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)\\", \\"Maneater\\", and \\"Out of Touch\\". Other Top 40 hits include \\"You Make My Dreams\\", \\"She's Gone\\", \\"Say It Isn't So\\" and \\"Sara Smile\\". In total, they had 34 chart hits on the US Billboard Hot 100, seven RIAA platinum albums, and six RIAA gold albums. Billboard magazine named them the most successful duo of the rock era, surpassing Simon & Garfunkel and The Everly Brothers. They have achieved moderate success in the United Kingdom with two UK top ten albums, spending a total of 117 weeks in the UK top 75 album charts and 84 weeks in the top 75 of the UK Singles Chart. In 2003, Hall and Oates were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Billboard magazine had Hall and Oates at No. 15 on their list of the 100 greatest artists of all time and the No. 1 duo,[ Daryl Hall & John Oates Biography & Awards]. Billboard. Retrieved on November 2, 2012. while VH1 placed the duo as No. 99 on their list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2014. On September 2, 2016, they received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. History =1967‚Äì1972: Formation and early years= Daryl Franklin Hohl (born in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, on October 11, 1946) and John William Oates (born in New York City, New York, on April 7, 1948) first met at the Adelphi Ballroom in Philadelphia in 1967. At the time they met, each was heading his own musical group, Hall with The Temptones and Oates with The Masters. They were there for a band competition when gunfire rang out between two rival gangs, and in trying to escape, they ran to the same service elevator. On further discovering that they were interested in the same music and that both were attending Philadelphia's Temple University, they started spending time together on a regular basis and eventually shared a number of apartments in the city. One of the apartments they shared had \\"Hall & Oates\\" on the mailbox, which became the duo's name. It would take them another two years to form a musical duo, and three years after that, they signed to Atlantic Records and released their debut album. The two didn't start working together seriously until 1970 after Oates got back from an extended stay in Europe. =1972‚Äì1974: First albums= Early in their recording careers, Hall and Oates had trouble clearly defining their sound, alternating among folk, soul, rock and pop. None of their early albums - Whole Oats, Abandoned Luncheonette and War Babies - were very successful. Despite being produced by such big-name producers as Arif Mardin and Todd Rundgren, they had no hit singles during this time period, though Abandoned Luncheonette contained \\"She's Gone\\". This song would be covered by Lou Rawls and Tavares before Atlantic Records re-released the Hall and Oates version in 1976. \\"She's Gone,\\" as covered by Tavares, did go to Number One on the R&B; charts in 1974. It was originally written for Hall's first wife, Bryna Lublin (Hall), and initially inspired by Oates' being stood up on a date on New Year's Eve. Another Abandoned Luncheonette single, \\"Las Vegas Turnaround\\", was written about (and mentioned by first name) Hall's girlfriend, flight attendant and future songwriting collaborator Sara Allen. Despite the fact that none of the Atlantic albums was a huge national hit, in Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul, a number of tracks on Abandoned Luncheonette received significant airplay on local FM station KQRS, making it a local hit. This and the other regional success the album achieved were enough to push the album into the charts, reaching #33 on Nov. 20, 1976 and staying on the charts for 38 weeks. =1975‚Äì1977: First hits= Print ad for Belkin Productions, Cleveland Public Hall, WMMS Radio in The Plain Dealer newspaper on December 5, 1976 Hall and Oates left Atlantic Records after the release of War Babies to join RCA Records. Their first album for the new label, Daryl Hall & John Oates (often referred to by their fans as the silver album because of the silver foil material on the original album cover), was their first legitimate success. It contained the ballad \\"Sara Smile,\\" a song Hall wrote for his aforementioned girlfriend Sara Allen. It also featured an album cover in which Hall and Oates are overly made up with cosmetic blush to the point where they looked like women, especially the long- haired and clean-shaven Hall. Hall would later say in an interview for VH1's Behind the Music that he looked like \\"the girl I always wanted to go out with\\" on that album cover. This cover was made by Pierre LaRoche, who created Ziggy Stardust for David Bowie. \\"Sara Smile\\" became their first Top 10 hit, reaching No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in June 1976. \\"She's Gone,\\" re-released by Atlantic Records after \\"Sara Smile,\\" also went to the Top 10, reaching No. 7 in October 1976. Hall and Oates followed those hits with the more pop- oriented album Bigger Than Both of Us later that year. Though the album's first single‚Äîthe Philadelphia soul-oriented ballad \\"Do What You Want, Be What You Are\\"‚Äîbarely made the Top 40, their second single, \\"Rich Girl,\\" was a smash. The song was Hall and Oates' first No. 1 hit, reaching the top spot for the week ending March 26, 1977. =1977‚Äì1980: Leaner years and Sacred Songs= After this small run of hits, Hall and Oates still encountered difficulty getting radio play. Despite touring constantly and recording albums with efficiency, the duo could not find any pop success for a number of reasons, mainly because of the popularity of the disco genre. By the time they released the rock-oriented albums Beauty on a Back Street in 1977 and Along the Red Ledge in 1978, disco music was trendy and taking most of the spots in popular music. Hall and Oates released X-Static in late 1979, which combined rock with dance music. The album did not fare well, although \\"Wait for Me\\" did hit the top 20. They did release a few hit singles during this period: the follow-up to \\"Rich Girl\\" (\\"Back Together Again\\") hit the Top 40, and \\"It's A Laugh\\" (from \\"Along The Red Ledge\\") hit the top 20 in 1978. In 1977, RCA attempted to push Hall to the fore with his first solo effort Sacred Songs. However, after being presented with the highly experimental recording (produced by Robert Fripp of King Crimson), RCA became unwilling to release what was, in their view, a non-commercial album. \\"Sacred Songs\\" was eventually released in 1980. =1980‚Äì1981: Voices= The 1980s brought about significant changes for Hall and Oates. The pair felt that the biggest hindrance to their success was that their music was being filtered through outside producers, and that studio musicians were not familiar with their own tastes and thoughts. They also wished to capture the sound of New York City which, by then, had become their home. As a result, instead of recording in Los Angeles, as they had done previously, they decided to record at Electric Lady Studios in New York City, just five minutes away from their apartments, and began producing their own recordings with their touring band backing them in the studio. They also enlisted Hall's girlfriend Sara Allen (and also her younger sister Janna) as songwriting collaborators, as well as beginning a working relationship with Neil Kernon, an engineer on Voices who would work as co-producer on their succeeding two albums. The resulting album, Voices, was written, produced and arranged by Hall and Oates in one month, according to their authorized biography Dangerous Dances (by Nick Tosches). The first two singles from the album charted fairly well, with \\"How Does It Feel to Be Back\\" charting at Number 30. The well-received cover of The Righteous Brothers' \\"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\\" just missed the Top 10, peaking at Number 12, but spent 14 weeks in the Top 40. After the release of that song, Oates' contribution as the lead vocalist diminished on future releases. The third single \\"Kiss on My List\\" hit Number 1 in April 1981 and remained there for three weeks. The follow-up single \\"You Make My Dreams\\" reached Number 5 in July of that year. The other well-known song from Voices is the emotive ballad \\"Everytime You Go Away\\", with powerful lead vocals by Hall, who wrote it. British singer Paul Young had a Billboard Number 1 hit with a cover of the song in 1985. Though the Hall and Oates original (recorded in a Memphis-soul style) was never released as a single, it remains a fan favorite on the duo's greatest hits albums and was featured on their Apollo Theater album in 1985, and is frequently featured in their live set to this day. =1981‚Äì1982: Private Eyes= By the time \\"You Make My Dreams\\" was falling off the charts, Hall and Oates had already released their follow-up album Private Eyes. Having worked in the studio while Voices was at its peak in popularity, the two had already recorded most of their material and perfected a fusion of their doo-wop and soul roots with New Wave energy and hard rock grit. The result was a pop classic that is often considered one of the greatest albums of the 80s and was the first Hall and Oates album to reach the Top 10 on the Billboard 200 album chart, while four singles from Private Eyes all reached the Top 40. The title track and \\"I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)\\" were nearly consecutive Number 1 hits, separated only by the ten-week stay at Number 1 by the monster hit \\"Physical\\" by Olivia Newton-John. \\"I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)\\" was one of the few songs ever recorded by a white act to reach Number One on both the R&B; and the pop charts. \\"Did It in a Minute\\" reached Number 9 in the spring of 1982, and \\"Your Imagination\\" peaked at No. 33. This album is now considered among the duo's best albums, mixing soul, new wave and power pop. =1982‚Äì1983: H2O= Their next album, H2O, a very polished, synth-heavy effort, became the duo's most successful album, with US sales eventually approaching four million copies. H2O reached #3 on the Billboard album chart (where it held for 15 weeks) and spawned three Top 10 singles. \\"Maneater\\", the biggest hit of their career, reached Number 1 on December 18, 1982 and stayed there for four weeks. The soulful ballad \\"One on One\\" and a cover of Mike Oldfield's \\"Family Man\\" reached Number 7 and Number 6 in March and June 1983, respectively. According to Oates, they recorded approximately 20 songs for the album, of which 9 didn't make the final cut. He went on to say they usually would have 5 or 6 tracks left over per album.Juke Magazine, November 6, 1982. \\"Hall & Oates: Water on the Brain by Allan Webster, page 20. \\"One On One,\\" with its clever mixed-metaphorical references to romance and basketball, was used in NBA commercials of the period. The commercial featured numerous players, including Hall of Famer James Worthy performing a 360-degree slow- motion lay-up during the saxophone solo. For the H2O album, Hall and Oates made some permanent changes to their current band. Drummer Mickey Curry, who had appeared on some Private Eyes tracks, including the title song, replaced Jerry Marotta full-time. Bassist Tom \\"T-Bone\\" Wolk, who had mimed John Siegler's bass line in the \\"Private Eyes\\" video, replaced Siegler full-time. These two joined the band's holdovers‚Äîlead guitar player G.E. Smith, and saxophonist Charlie \\"Mr. Casual\\" DeChant. De Chant and Wolk continued to perform with the duo until Wolk's death in early 2010, while Curry returned for the Do It for Love sessions. =1983‚Äì1984: Rock 'n Soul Part 1= By the fall of 1983, Hall and Oates were one of the biggest pop music acts in the United States. They had five Number 1 singles to their credit, two consecutive Top 10 albums and were one of the biggest names on MTV. Two covers of the 1957 Bobby Helms classic \\"Jingle Bell Rock\\" were recorded‚Äîone with Hall on lead vocals, and the other with Oates on lead vocals‚Äîand released in time for Christmas 1983, complete with a humorous video of the band, that received extensive airplay on MTV. In 1983, they released their first greatest hits album entitled Rock 'n Soul Part 1. The album peaked at Number 7, and the two new songs that were written and recorded for that LP also became Top 10 hits as well. The first single released from this album, \\"Say It Isn't So\\", battled six weeks for the Number 1 spot with Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson's \\"Say Say Say\\" at the peak of Thriller mania. \\"Say It Isn't So\\" remained at Number 2 for an impressive four weeks from December 1983 to January 1984. Hall and Oates' follow-up single \\"Adult Education\\" received heavy airplay at both pop and black (urban contemporary) radio, and reached Number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April 1984. It was accompanied by a dark, New York City-oriented music video set in a cave. Oates later told VH1 that the clip resembled the Survivor TV show on acid. =1984‚Äì1985: Big Bam Boom= Hall and Oates returned to the studio in 1984 after a rest period to begin work on the Big Bam Boom album. This album had even more of an electronic, urban feel to it than H2O, combining their song structure and vocalization with the latest technical advances in recording and playing. The album employed some of the most sophisticated equipment ever used in the recording industry at the time (most notably the Synclavier II, one of the first computerized synthesizer workstations, as well as the Fairlight CMI). Noted remix and hip-hop icon Arthur Baker worked very closely with the duo as a consultant, and produced dance remixes of four of the album's singles. The lead-off song \\"Dance on Your Knees\\" (written by Hall and Baker) is basically an homage to Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's song \\"White Lines (Don't Don't Do It)\\". Released in late 1984, the first single from the LP, \\"Out of Touch\\", became the group's sixth number 1 hit on December 8, 1984. \\"Method of Modern Love\\", which debuted on the pop charts while \\"Out of Touch\\" was at number 1, reached number 5 in February 1985. \\"Some Things Are Better Left Unsaid\\" reached number 18, and \\"Possession Obsession\\" (a song in which Oates sings lead) reached number 30 in 1985 as well. The group's \\"Live Thru '85\\" tour to promote the album began in November 1984, sponsored by Pontiac's latest sports car, the Fiero. In addition, Pontiac allowed Oates, a skilled amateur racer, to drive in Pontiac's factory IMSA GTU race car in Camel GT pro races. In April 1984, the Recording Industry Association of America named Hall & Oates the most successful duo in rock history. =1985‚Äì1988: Live at the Apollo/Other Projects= Hall and Oates have almost always toured extensively for each album release. But in 1985, the duo took a break after the release of their Live at the Apollo album with David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks‚Äîvoices of The Temptations and two of their heroes. This was RCA's second attempt at a live Hall and Oates album, following the 1978 release Livetime. Live at the Apollo was released primarily to fulfill the duo's contract with RCA, and contained a Top 20 Grammy-nominated hit with a medley of \\"The Way You Do the Things You Do\\" and \\"My Girl\\"; Ruffin and Kendrick had originally recorded both songs with the Temptations in 1964. Hall and Oates had collaborated on the USA for Africa \\"We Are the World\\" project, with the former as one of the soloists and the latter as a chorus member, and performed at the Live Aid concert in Philadelphia, with Ruffin and Kendrick. The Hall and Oates band also backed up Mick Jagger's performance at this show. Hall, Oates, Ruffin and Kendrick performed again at the MTV Video Music Awards in New York later that year, complete with an Apollo Theater-style marquee descending on the stage during their performance. In May, 1985, Hall and Oates performed at the Nashville Municipal Auditorium. Just prior to Live Aid, on July 4, they participated in Liberty Concert, an outdoor benefit concert at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, New Jersey for the restoration of the Statue of Liberty. It became a major music event, drawing an estimated crowd of over 60,000 people. In 1986, Hall scored a Top 5 US hit with \\"Dreamtime\\", from his solo album Three Hearts in the Happy Ending Machine. That album also included the Top 40 hit \\"Foolish Pride\\" and the Top 100 hit \\"Somebody Like You,\\" later performed by the duo live on their \\"Behind the Music\\" set. Although Oates did not have a solo hit as a singer, he did contribute a solo track to the film About Last Night and co-wrote (with Iva Davies) and performed backing vocals on the 1987 Icehouse top 10 US hit \\"Electric Blue.\\" Oates also worked as producer, co-songwriter and co-lead vocalist of the single \\"Love Is Fire\\" by The Parachute Club, which was a top 40 hit in Canada in 1987. =1988‚Äì1990: The Arista years= Hall and Oates signed with Arista Records, their third record company, in 1987, shortly before the string of Top 10 hits ended, in Tommy Mottola's effort to keep them under contract when their RCA obligation ran out. Their first album for the label, Ooh Yeah!, included the hits \\"Everything Your Heart Desires\\" (Number 3 in May 1988‚Äîtheir last to make the Top 10), \\"Missed Opportunity\\", and \\"Downtown Life\\". Beginning with Ooh Yeah!, album and single releases were credited as Daryl Hall John Oates, with the '&' or 'and' missing between the duo's names. It was the last Hall and Oates album, other than greatest hits packages, to enjoy platinum success. They recorded one more album for Arista called Change of Season. The album's first single \\"So Close\\" (co-produced by Jon Bon Jovi) reached Number 11 and was Hall & Oates' last major hit. Another song from the album, \\"Don't Hold Back Your Love\\", was named by SOCAN as the second-most performed song in Canada for 1992; it became a hit for Australian Sherbet front man Daryl Braithwaite in his solo years, and has become a Hall and Oates staple in concert. Change of Season was a more mainstream rock album than their previous work. Despite the fact that Ooh Yeah! and Change of Season reached platinum and gold status respectively, they were perceived as disappointments. In 1989, they covered and did their own version of the O'Jays song Love Train for the movie Earth Girls Are Easy. =1991‚Äì2006= The duo's occasional songwriting collaborator Janna Allen died of leukemia in 1993. Hall and Oates released the Marigold Sky album in 1997 (their first all-new studio album in seven years), which included an Adult Contemporary hit \\"Promise Ain't Enough\\". They also released a \\"VH1 Behind the Music\\" Greatest Hits package shortly after appearing on the show in 2002. At the same time, Daryl and Sara, professional/personal collaborators, broke off their romantic relationship after some three decades. Their friendship is still apparently strong; he has noted her help in his recovery from his 2005 attack of Lyme disease. Hall and Oates released the Do It for Love album in 2003, whose title track was a number-one Adult Contemporary hit. They have also released the Hall & Oates Live DVD from an A&E; Live by Request special. This album was the first release (and first success) for their newest joint venture U-Watch Records. Hall has also released the solo albums Soul Alone (1993) and Can't Stop Dreaming (originally released in Japan in 1996), and a live two-disc solo album titled Live in Philadelphia (2004). Hall and Oates covered Elton John's \\"Philadelphia Freedom\\" on the 1991 John/Taupin tribute album \\"Two Rooms\\", saying in the booklet: \\"We chose 'Philadelphia Freedom' because the music is so close to our hearts, and the lyrics represent the way we feel about Philadelphia.\\" Oates released his own solo album in 2002 entitled Phunk Shui and a companion live concert DVD. Hall and Oates also released their first CD of (mostly) covers, Our Kind of Soul, in 2004. It includes some of their favorite R&B; songs, such as \\"I'll Be Around\\" (their first Hot 100 entry in over a decade), \\"Love T.K.O.\\", and Dan Hartman's \\"I Can Dream About You\\", among others. Hall and Oates are still on the touring circuit, traveling nearly as much as they did in years past. In addition, a DVD of live performances of the songs from Our Kind of Soul was released in November 2005. Hall and Oates released a Christmas album, Home for Christmas, on October 3, 2006, which contained two Christmas originals and covers, including a version of \\"It Came Upon a Midnight Clear\\", which became their second number one Adult Contemporary hit.\\"Fred Bronson, Chart Beat, December 21, 2006\\", billboard.com =2007‚Äì2013: Solo projects and hiatus= In September 2007, representatives of Montreal-based band Chromeo stated in a press release, \\"Indeed, Chromeo's idols Hall and Oates have asked them to collaborate with them on their upcoming record! Needless to say, the gentlemen are giddy like schoolchildren to be given this opportunity,\\" as reported by Pitchfork Media. This collaboration with Chromeo was expected to be released in late 2008/early 2009, and was released as Live from Daryl's House. On May 20, 2008, Hall and Oates were honored as BMI Icons at the 56th annual BMI Pop Awards. As of 2008, their songwriting has collected 24 BMI Pop Awards and 14 BMI Million-Air awards. There were two notable nationally televised appearances for the duo in late 2008. On October 27, Oates sang the National Anthem before Game 5 of the 2008 World Series at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia (Hall had taken sick, and the game was called on account of rain after the top of the 6th inning, but resumed on October 29, and the Phillies won, claiming their first World Series Championship in 28 years). (Though born in New York, Oates was raised in a suburb of Philadelphia and attended Temple University.) Then, on December 11, both Hall and Oates appeared on the year's last episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. They sang a satirical tribute to Alan Colmes, as he would leave the show Hannity and Colmes on Fox News a month later.\\"The Daily Show With Jon Stewart, December 11, 2008 on hulu\\", hulu.com On March 24, 2009, Hall and Oates performed together on the American television show Dancing with the Stars.

They played many popular selections, including \\"Cab Driver\\" from Hall's solo album as well as several songs from the Abandoned Luncheonette album, including \\"Had I Known You Better Then\\" which had never been performed live before. The performance was recorded as a concert film and later released in the US as a double CD set with DVD/Blu-ray Combo on November 25, 2008. In 2009 the live performances of \\"Sara Smile\\" from this album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, an incredible 33 years after the original song was released. Concerning the nomination, Daryl considered it truly a surprise. This made it the third time that the band was nominated for a Grammy Award; the other two times were in 1981 for \\"Private Eyes\\" and 1983 for \\"Maneater\\". On October 13, 2009, a 4-CD box set was released, titled Do What You Want, Be What You Are: The Music of Daryl Hall and John Oates.

Lord Venkateswara is the presiding deity of Tirumala Venkateswara Temple located in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India. Etymology Venkateswara literally means \\"Lord of Venkata\\". The word is a combination of the words Venkata (the name of a hill in Andhra Pradesh) and isvara (\\"Lord\\"). According to the Brahmanda and Bhavishyottara Puranas, the word \\"Venkata\\" means \\"destroyer of sins\\", deriving from the Sanskrit words vem (sins) and kata (power of immunity). It is also being said Venkata is combination of two words 'ven' (keeps away) and 'kata' (troubles). Being that said Venkata means 'who keeps away troubles' or 'who takes away problems' or any other sentence in similar context. Legend Lord Venkateswara with consorts Bhudevi and Padmavati. Every year, lakhs of devotees donate a large amount of wealth at the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple at Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh. There is a great legend behind this incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Once, there was a ritual to be conducted. The sages and pontiffs for the Yagya were in a dilemma that for which God is the ritual to be done. The sages called for Sage Bhrigu, one of the Saptarishis to ask for which God should the ritual be done. To test the ideal God, Bhrigu did a test. He first went to King of Gods, Indra. Indra did not at all recognize Bhrigu's presence and was busy in mesmerising the dance of devadasis in the heaven. Bhrigu cursed Indra that he would only be referred as an egoistic soul all over the universe. He next visited Brahma. Brahma was busy with his four heads in chanting the Vedas, doing meditation, creating the world and spending his time with his consort, Saraswati. Bhrigu cursed Brahma that he would be not worshipped by the creatures on earth anymore for not obeying him. Next he visited Lord Shiva. Shiva was busy in his Rudradhyanam and his consort, Mother Parvati was worshipping Shiva's feet. Bhrigu cursed Shiva that he would be worshipped only as a stone called Lingam. At last, Bhrigu went to Lord Vishnu. Vishnu was sleeping on the bed of serpents and Lakshmi was at his feet. When Bhrigu arrived, he first saw Vishnu's feet and felt too humiliated. He thus kicked Vishnu on his chest and awakened Vishnu started massaging Bhrigu's feet and served him great hospitality. Bhrigu was pleased and ordered the sages to perform the rites for Vishnu. Goddess Lakshmi, also referred as Sri, had a fight with Lord Vishnu as she felt that Bhrigu insulted her indirectly by hitting Vishnu on his chest where Sri lived and thus left Vaikuntha. She came and settled on earth in disguise in the ancient city of Karvir(Kolhapur) and meditated for Vishnu where today the Mahalaxmi temple is situated. Lord Vishnu soon arrived on earth searching for Goddess Lakshmi. But He failed to find her and instead settled on Seshachalam hills inside an anthill. Like this, Lord Vishnu reached the place of piligrimage of Lord Varaaha Swamy in Tirupati Tirumala. Lord Vishnu sat inside an anthill which was situated under a tamarind tree and started chanting the name of Goddess mahalaksmi. The whole earth became gloomy. On the request of Parvati and Saraswati, Lord Shiva and Lord Brahma incarnated as a cow and a calf respectively in the Chola kingdom.This cow and calf were being grazed daily by a shepherd of Chola kingdom in the Seshachalam hills. The cow and calf, everyday used to deposit their milk in the anthill to lessen the thirst of Vishnu. Due to daily program, the cow and calf became pale and unhealthy. The Chola king and shepherd noticed this and felt something suspicious. The next day the shepherd took the animals for grazing and like everyday, the cow and calf deposited their milk in the anthill. The Chola king saw this act and launched his arrow towards the cow and calf. But in order to protect them, Vishnu arose from the anthill and the arrow hit Vishnu's leg. The Chola king was sorry for his mistake and surrendered at the Lord's feet. Lord presented him a boon that he would marry his daughter in his next birth. In his next birth, Vishnu incarnated as Srinivasa to a woman named Vakula Devi. It is said that in Dwapara Yuga, Krishna presented Yashoda a boon that Krishna will be again born to Yashoda in Kali Yuga. Vakula Devi was reincarnation of Yashoda. Meanwhile, Goddess Lakshmi of Karvir took birth at the palace of Aakasha Raja, the next birth of The previous Chola king. Srinivasa was a forest dweller. During the search, Lord Srinivasa met the beautiful girl named Padmavati. They both fell in love and decided to get married as per the boon of Vishnu to Chola king in previous birth.For the marriage expenses, Srinivasa takes debt from Kubera and promises to repay the loan with interest till the end of Kaliyuga. After the marriage, Sage Narada informed Lakshmi about the wedding, then fuming, Lakshmi confronts Vishnu. The clash between his two consorts leads Srinivasa, to turn himself into stone form. Padmavathi & Lakshmi also become stone on his either side and Vakula Devi as a garland. Deity Venkateswara, an avatar of Vishnu is the presiding deity of the Tirupati temple. It is believed that the Moolavirat is Swayambhu (self manifested).

Bhoga Srinivasa is always placed near the left foot of Moolavirat and is always connected to the main deity by a holy Sambandha Kroocha.This deity will receive many daily sevas(pleasures) on behalf of Moolavar and hence known as Bhoga Srinivasa(In Telugu: Bhoga means Pleasure). This deity receives Ekanthaseva daily and SahasraKalasabhisheka on Wednesdays. #Ugra Srinivasa or Snapana Beram - This deity represents the fearsome(Telugu: Ugra means angry) aspect of Lord Venkateswara. This deity is the main processional deity until 1330 CE when it was replaced by Malayappa swami deity. Ugra Srinivasa remains inside the sanctum sanctorum and comes out on a procession only one day in a year: on Kaishika Dwadasi, before the sunrise.

Koluvu Srinivasa is regarded as the guardian deity of the temple that presides over its financial and economic affairs. Daily Koluvu seva(Telugu: Koluvu means engaged in) will be held in the morning, during which, the previous day's offerings, income, expenditures are notified to this deity, with a presentation of accounts. Panchanga sravanam also will be held at the same time during which that particular days Tithi, sunrise and sunset time, nakshatra are notified to the Venkateswara. Songs and Hymns Sri Venkateswara Suprabhatam is the first and pre-dawn seva performed to Lord Venkateswara at Sayana Mandapam inside sanctum sanctorum of Tirumala Temple. 'Suprabhatam' is a Sanskrit term which literally means ‚ÄòGood Morning‚Äô and is meant to wake up the Lord from His celestial sleep. Sri Venkateswara Suprabhatam hymns were composed by Prathivadhi Bhayankaram Annangaracharya during 13th century and consists of 70 slokas in four parts including Suprabhatam(29), Stotram(11), Prapatti(14) and Mangalasasanam(16).

It made its Broadway debut at the Vanderbilt Theatre on November 2, 1921. O'Neill received the 1922 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for this work. Plot summary Anna Christie is the story of a former prostitute who falls in love, but runs into difficulty in turning her life around. ; Characters * Johnny the Priest * Two longshoremen * A postman * Larry ‚Äî bartender * Chris C. Christopherson ‚Äî captain of the barge Simeon Winthrop * Marthy Owen * Anna Christopherson ‚Äî Chris's daughter * Mat Burke ‚Äî a stoker * Johnson ‚Äî deckhand on barge = Act I = The first act takes place in a bar owned by Johnny the Priest and tended by Larry. Coal- barge captain Old Chris receives a letter from his daughter, a young woman he has not seen since he lived in Sweden with his family and she was five years old. They meet at the bar and she agrees to go to the coal barge with him. = Act II = The barge crew rescues Mat Burke and four other men who survived a shipwreck in an open boat. Anna and Mat don't get along at first, but quickly fall in love. = Act III = A confrontation on the barge among Anna, Chris and Mat. Mat wants to marry Anna, Chris does not want her to marry a sailor, and Anna doesn't want either of them to think they can control her. She tells them the truth about her past: She was raped while living with her mother's relatives on a Minnesota farm, worked briefly as a nurse's aide, then became a prostitute. Mat reacts angrily, and he and Chris leave. = Act IV = Mat and Chris return. Anna forgives Chris for not being part of her childhood. After a dramatic confrontation, Anna promises to abandon prostitution and Mat forgives her. Chris agrees to their marriage. Chris and Mat have both signed to work aboard a ship that is leaving for South Africa the next day. They promise to return to Anna after the voyage.  Productions  Pauline Lord as Anna Christopherson, James T. Mack as Johnny-the-Priest, and Eugenie Blair as Marthy Owen in the original Broadway production of Anna Christie (1921) O'Neill's first version of this play, begun in January 1919, was titled Chris Christopherson and performed as Chris in out-of-town tryouts. O'Neill revised it radically, changing the barge captain's daughter Anna from a pure woman needing to be protected into a prostitute who finds reformation and love from life on the sea. The new version, play, now titled Anna Christie, had its premiere on Broadway at the Vanderbilt Theatre on November 2, 1921, and ran for 177 performances before closing in April 1923. The production was staged by Arthur Hopkins and starred Pauline Lord. The desk on which O'Neill wrote the play is preserved and on display at his family's former home, Monte Cristo Cottage in Connecticut.Schmidt, Shannon McKenna and Joni Rendon. Novel Destinations: Literary Landmarks from Jane Austen's Bath to Ernest Heminway's Key West. Washington, D.C.: National Geographic, 2008: 13. Alexander Woollcott in The New York Times called it \\"a singularly engrossing play\\", and advised that \\"all grown-up playgoers should jot down in their notebooks the name of Anna Christie as that of a play they really ought to see.\\" The London West End premiere was staged at the Strand Theatre (now the Novello) in 1923. This was the first time an O'Neill play was seen in the West End. The play starred Pauline Lord, who had been the original Anna Christie on Broadway. The play had a great reception. Time magazine wrote, \\"In London, the first night of Eugene O'Neill's Anna Christie, with Pauline Lord in the title role, received a tremendous ovation. After the first act the curtain was rung up a dozen times during the applause. =Revivals= * 1952: The play was revived at the Lyceum Theatre on January 23, 1952, staged by Michael Gordon and designed by Emeline C. Roche with Celeste Holm as Anna, Kevin McCarthy, and Arthur O'Connell. It ran for 8 performances. Poster for the 1977 Broadway revival by James McMullan * 1955: The play was revived at the Teatro 5 de diciembre of Mexico City, directed by Tulio Demicheli. It starred Silvia Pinal as Anna and Wolf Ruvinskis. * 1977: The play was revived at the Imperial Theatre on April 14, 1977, directed by Jos√© Quintero and designed by Ben Edwards. It starred Liv Ullmann as Anna, Robert Donley, John Lithgow and Mary McCarty. It received Tony Award nominations for Liv Ullmann as Best Actress and for Mary McCarty as Best Featured Actress. It ran for 124 performances. * 1990: The play was staged at the Young Vic theatre in London and starred Natasha Richardson.https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/oct/19/young- vic-40th-birthday-anniversaryhttps://www.thedailybeast.com/earthy-beauty * 1993: The play was revived on Broadway on January 14, 1993 by The Roundabout Theatre Company at the Criterion Center Stage Right. It was directed by David Leveaux and designed by John Lee Beatty. It starred Natasha Richardson, Liam Neeson, Anne Meara, and Rip Torn. It received Tony Award nominations for Best Actress (Natasha Richardson), Best Actor (Liam Neeson), Best Featured Actress (Anne Meara), Best Direction (David Leveaux), and won the award for Best Revival. Neeson and Richardson both received the Theatre World Award. The production won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Play for Richardson. It ran for 54 performances. * 2002: The play was directed by Gar Campbell at the Pacific Resident Theatre, rerunning from January 5, 2002 to May 5, 2002, starring Lesley Fera. * 2011: The play was produced at the Donmar Warehouse, London, running from August 4, 2011 to October 8, 2011, with Ruth Wilson as Anna, Jude Law as Mat, and David Hayman as Chris. It was positively received by critics, with mostly 4 and 5 star reviews, and it won the 2012 Olivier Award for \\"best revival\\". Adaptations Thomas Ince Productions (1923) The play was adapted by Bradley King for a 1923 film of the same name directed by John Griffith Wray and Thomas H. Ince, with stars Blanche Sweet, William Russell, George F. Marion, and Eugenie Besserer. A 1930 film adaptation by Frances Marion was directed by Clarence Brown and starred Greta Garbo, Charles Bickford, George F. Marion and Marie Dressler. This pre-Code film used the marketing slogan \\"Garbo Talks!\\", as it was her first talkie. Her first spoken line has become her most famous: \\"Give me a whiskey with ginger ale on the side, and don't be stingy, baby.\\" George F. Marion, who had performed the role of Anna's father in the original Broadway production, reprised the role in both the 1923 and 1930 film adaptations. A German-language adaptation, also starring Garbo, was filmed in 1930 and released the same year, using the same production as the English language film that had concluded filming in 1929. This version was adapted by Frances Marion, translated by Walter Hasenclever and directed by Jacques Feyder. In addition to Garbo, the cast included Theo Shall, Hans Junkermann, and Salka Viertel. In 1957, a thoroughly reworked adaptation by George Abbott with music and lyrics by Bob Merrill, called New Girl in Town, opened on Broadway. It ran for 431 performances. In 2018, Encompass New Opera Theatre presented an opera adaptation composed by Edward Thomas with a libretto by Joe Masteroff at the Baruch College Performing Arts Center in New York City. Directed by Nancy Rhodes and conducted by Julian Wachner, it featured Melanie Long in the title role, Frank Basile as Chris, Jonathan Estabrooks as Mat, Joe Hermlayn as Marthy and Mike Pirozzi as Larry. It ran for 12 performances. A recording with the original cast, produced by Thomas Z. Shepard and conducted by Julian Wachner, with the orchestra NOVUS New York, will be released by Broadway Records on August 16, 2019. It is a collaboration of Trinity Church and Encompass New Opera Theatre. Trivia According to actress Ellen Burstyn in the 2012 film Marilyn in Manhattan, Marilyn Monroe performed a scene from Anna Christie at the Actors Studio with Maureen Stapleton. Calling the story \\"legendary,\\" Burstyn said, \\"Everybody who saw that says that it was not only the best work Marilyn ever did, it was some of the best work ever seen at Studio, and certainly the best interpretation of Anna Christie anybody ever saw. She...achieved real greatness in that scene.\\" (According to some biographers, Monroe was molested by foster parents and worked as a prostitute.)

The method is named after Polish scientist Jan Czochralski,Pawe≈Ç Tomaszewski, \\"Jan Czochralski i jego metoda. Jan Czochralski and his method\\" (in Polish and English), Oficyna Wydawnicza ATUT, Wroc≈Çaw‚ÄìKcynia 2003, who invented the method in 1915 while investigating the crystallization rates of metals.J.

He made this discovery by accident: instead of dipping his pen into his inkwell, he dipped it in molten tin, and drew a tin filament, which later proved to be a single crystal. The most important application may be the growth of large cylindrical ingots, or boules, of single crystal silicon used in the electronics industry to make semiconductor devices like integrated circuits. Other semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide, can also be grown by this method, although lower defect densities in this case can be obtained using variants of the Bridgman‚ÄìStockbarger method. The method is not limited to production of metal or metalloid crystals. For example, it is used to manufacture very-high purity crystals of salts for use in particle physics experiments, with tight controls (part per billion measurements) on confounding metal ions and water absorbed during manufacture. In this case, the material is lithium molybdate, including material with controlled isotopic composition.  Application  Monocrystalline silicon (mono-Si) grown by the Czochralski method is often referred to as monocrystalline Czochralski silicon (Cz-Si). It is the basic material in the production of integrated circuits used in computers, TVs, mobile phones and all types of electronic equipment and semiconductor devices.Czochralski Crystal Growth Method. Bbc.co.uk. 30 January 2003. Retrieved on 2011-12-06. Monocrystalline silicon is also used in large quantities by the photovoltaic industry for the production of conventional mono-Si solar cells. The almost perfect crystal structure yields the highest light-to-electricity conversion efficiency for silicon.  Production of Czochralski silicon  Crystal of Czochralski-grown silicon High-purity, semiconductor-grade silicon (only a few parts per million of impurities) is melted in a crucible at , usually made of quartz. Dopant impurity atoms such as boron or phosphorus can be added to the molten silicon in precise amounts to dope the silicon, thus changing it into p-type or n-type silicon, with different electronic properties. A precisely oriented rod-mounted seed crystal is dipped into the molten silicon. The seed crystal's rod is slowly pulled upwards and rotated simultaneously. By precisely controlling the temperature gradients, rate of pulling and speed of rotation, it is possible to extract a large, single-crystal, cylindrical ingot from the melt. Occurrence of unwanted instabilities in the melt can be avoided by investigating and visualizing the temperature and velocity fields during the crystal growth process. This process is normally performed in an inert atmosphere, such as argon, in an inert chamber, such as quartz.  Crystal sizes Silicon crystal being grown by the Czochralski method at Raytheon, 1956. The induction heating coil is visible, and the end of the crystal is just emerging from the melt. The technician is measuring the temperature with an optical pyrometer. The crystals produced by this early apparatus, used in an early Si plant, were only one inch in diameter. Due to efficiencies of scale, the semiconductor industry often uses wafers with standardized dimensions, or common wafer specifications. Early on, boules were small, a few cm wide. With advanced technology, high-end device manufacturers use 200 mm and 300 mm diameter wafers. Width is controlled by precise control of temperature, speeds of rotation, and the speed at which the seed holder is withdrawn. The crystal ingots from which wafers are sliced can be up to 2 metres in length, weighing several hundred kilograms. Larger wafers allow improvements in manufacturing efficiency, as more chips can be fabricated on each wafer, with lower relative loss, so there has been a steady drive to increase silicon wafer sizes. The next step up, 450 mm, is currently scheduled for introduction in 2018.Doubts over 450mm and EUV. Electronicsweekly.com. December 30, 2013. Retrieved on 2014-01-09. Silicon wafers are typically about 0.2‚Äì0.75 mm thick, and can be polished to great flatness for making integrated circuits or textured for making solar cells. The process begins when the chamber is heated to approximately 1500 degrees Celsius, melting the silicon. When the silicon is fully melted, a small seed crystal mounted on the end of a rotating shaft is slowly lowered until it dips just below the surface of the molten silicon. The shaft rotates counterclockwise and the crucible rotates clockwise. The rotating rod is then drawn upwards very slowly‚Äîat about 25 mm per hour when making a crystal of ruby‚Äîallowing a roughly cylindrical boule to be formed. The boule can be from one to two metres, depending on the amount of silicon in the crucible. The electrical characteristics of the silicon are controlled by adding material like phosphorus or boron to the silicon before it is melted. The added material is called dopant and the process is called doping. This method is also used with semiconductor materials other than silicon, such as gallium arsenide. Incorporating impurities A puller rod with seed crystal for growing single-crystal silicon by the Czochralski method Crucibles used in Czochralski method Crucible after being used When silicon is grown by the Czochralski method, the melt is contained in a silica (quartz) crucible. During growth, the walls of the crucible dissolve into the melt and Czochralski silicon therefore contains oxygen at a typical concentration of 10 cm. Oxygen impurities can have beneficial or detrimental effects. Carefully chosen annealing conditions can give rise to the formation of oxygen precipitates. These have the effect of trapping unwanted transition metal impurities in a process known as gettering, improving the purity of surrounding silicon. However, formation of oxygen precipitates at unintended locations can also destroy electrical structures. Additionally, oxygen impurities can improve the mechanical strength of silicon wafers by immobilising any dislocations which may be introduced during device processing. It was experimentally shown in the 1990s that the high oxygen concentration is also beneficial for the radiation hardness of silicon particle detectors used in harsh radiation environment (such as CERN's LHC/HL- LHC projects). Therefore, radiation detectors made of Czochralski- and magnetic Czochralski-silicon are considered to be promising candidates for many future high-energy physics experiments.CERN RD50 Status Report 2004, CERN-LHCC-2004-031 and LHCC-RD-005 and cited literature therein It has also been shown that the presence of oxygen in silicon increases impurity trapping during post-implantation annealing processes. However, oxygen impurities can react with boron in an illuminated environment, such as that experienced by solar cells. This results in the formation of an electrically active boron‚Äìoxygen complex that detracts from cell performance. Module output drops by approximately 3% during the first few hours of light exposure.Eikelboom, J.A., Jansen, M.J., 2000.

He was also a scientist, cosmologist, mathematician and music theorist.Ludwig W. Adamec (2009), Historical Dictionary of Islam, pp.95‚Äì96. Scarecrow Press. . In Islamic philosophical tradition he was often called \\"the Second Teacher\\", following Aristotle who was known as \\"the First Teacher\\". He is credited with preserving the original Greek texts during the Middle Ages because of his commentaries and treatises, and influencing many prominent philosophers, such as Avicenna and Maimonides. Through his works, he became well-known in the West as well as the East.  Biography  The existing variations in the basic accounts of al- Farabi's origins and pedigree indicate that they were not recorded during his lifetime or soon thereafter by anyone with concrete information, but were based on hearsay or guesses (as is the case with other contemporaries of al- Farabi). Little is known about his life. Early sources include an autobiographical passage where al-Farabi traces the history of logic and philosophy up to his time, and brief mentions by Al-Masudi, Ibn al-Nadim and Ibn Hawqal. Said Al-Andalusi wrote a biography of al-Farabi. Arabic biographers of the 12th‚Äì13th centuries thus had few facts to hand, and used invented stories about his life. From incidental accounts it is known that he spent significant time (most of his life) in Baghdad with Christian scholars including the cleric Yuhanna ibn Haylan, Yahya ibn Adi, and Abu Ishaq Ibrahim al-Baghdadi. He later spent time in Damascus and in Egypt before returning to Damascus where he died in 950-1.Reisman, D.(ed.)Before and After Avicenna. Princeton, NJ. 2001 His name was Ab≈´ Na·π£r Mu·∏•ammad b.

His grandfather was not known among his contemporaries, but a name, Awzala·∏°, suddenly appears later in the writings of Ibn Abƒ´ U·π£aibi øa, and of his great-grandfather in those of Ibn Khallikan. His birthplace could have been any one of the many places in Central Asia-Khurasan that is known by that name. The name \\"parab/farab\\" is a Persian term for a locale that is irrigated by effluent springs or flows from a nearby river. Thus, there are many places that carry the name (or various evolutions of that hydrological/geological toponym) in that general area, such as FƒÅrƒÅb on the Jaxartes (Syr Darya) in modern Kazakhstan, FƒÅrƒÅb (modern T√ºrkmenabat) on the Oxus Amu Darya in Turkmenistan, or evenFƒÅryƒÅb in Greater Khorasan (modern day Afghanistan).

Al- Farabi and His School, 1999, p. 5 Dimitri Gutas, an American Arabist of Greek origin, criticizes this, saying that Ibn KhallikƒÅn's account is aimed at the earlier historical accounts by Ibn Abƒ´ U·π£aibi øa, and serves the purpose to \\"prove\\" a Turkic origin for al-Farabi, for instance by mentioning the additional nisba (surname) \\"al-Turk\\" (arab. \\"the Turk\\")‚Äîa nisba Farabi never had. However, Abu al-FedƒÅ', who copied Ibn ·∏¥hallekƒÅn, corrected this and changed al-Torkƒ´ to the phrase \\"wa-kƒÅna rajolan torkƒ´yan\\", meaning \\"he was a Turkish man.\\" In this regard, Oxford professor C.E. Bosworth notes that \\"great figures [such] as al-Farabi, al-Biruni, and ibn Sina have been attached by over enthusiastic Turkish scholars to their race\\". = Life and education = Al-Farabi spent almost his entire life in Baghdad. In the auto-biographical passage preserved by Ibn Abƒ´ U·π£aibi øa, Farabi stated that he had studied logic, medicine and sociology with Y≈´·∏•annƒÅ bin ·∏§aylƒÅn up to and including Aristotle's Posterior Analytics, i.e., according to the order of the books studied in the curriculum, FƒÅrƒÅbƒ´ was claiming that he had studied Porphyry's Eisagoge and Aristotle's Categories, De Interpretatione, Prior and Posterior Analytics. His teacher, bin ·∏§aylƒÅn, was a Nestorian cleric. This period of study was probably in Baghdad, where Al-Masudi records that Y≈´·∏•annƒÅ died during the reign of Al-Muqtadir (295-320/908-32). He was in Baghdad at least until the end of September 942, as recorded in notes in his MabƒÅde æ ƒÅrƒÅ æ ahl al-madƒ´na al-fƒÅ≈ºela. He finished the book in Damascus the following year (331), i.e., by September 943). He also studied in T√©touan, Morocco and lived and taught for some time in Aleppo. Farabi later visited Egypt, finishing six sections summarizing the book MabƒÅde æ in Egypt in 337/July 948 ‚Äì June 949 when he returned to Syria, where he was supported by Sayf al-Dawla, the Hamdanid ruler. Al-Masudi, writing barely five years after the fact (955-6, the date of the composition of the Tanbƒ´h), says that Farabi died in Damascus in Rajab 339 (between 14 December 950 and 12 January 951).  Religious beliefs  Henry Corbin writes that the evidence supports the opinion common in Iran that al- Farabi was a Shia Muslim. Corbin argues that there are many similarities between what he calls Farabi's \\"prophetic philosophy\\" and the teachings of Shiite Imams. Najjar Fauzi likewise argues that al-Farabi's political philosophy was influenced by Shiite sects.Fazi, FƒÅrƒÅbƒ´'s Political Philosophy and shƒ´'ism, Studia Islamica, No. 14 (1961), pp. 57‚Äì72 Giving a positive account, Nadia Maftouni describes shi'ite aspects of Farabi's writings. As she put it, Farabi in his Al-Millah, Al-Sƒ´yƒÅsah al-Madanƒ´yah, and Tahsil al- Sa‚Äôadah believes in a utopia governed by prophet and his successors: the Imams.  Works and contributions  Farabi made contributions to the fields of logic, mathematics, music, philosophy, psychology, and education. = Alchemy = Al-Farabi wrote: The Necessity of the Art of the Elixir = Logic = Though he was mainly an Aristotelian logician, he included a number of non-Aristotelian elements in his works. He discussed the topics of future contingents, the number and relation of the categories, the relation between logic and grammar, and non-Aristotelian forms of inference.History of logic: Arabic logic, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. He is also credited with categorizing logic into two separate groups, the first being \\"idea\\" and the second being \\"proof\\". Al-Farabi also considered the theories of conditional syllogisms and analogical inference, which were part of the Stoic tradition of logic rather than the Aristotelian. Another addition al-Farabi made to the Aristotelian tradition was his introduction of the concept of poetic syllogism in a commentary on Aristotle's Poetics. = Music = Drawing of a musical instrument, a shahrud, from al- Farabi's KitƒÅb al-m≈´sƒ´qƒÅ al-kabƒ´r Al-Farabi wrote a book on music titled Kitab al-Musiqa (The Book of Music). In it, he presents philosophical principles about music, its cosmic qualities, and its influences. He also wrote a treatise on the Meanings of the Intellect, which dealt with music therapy and discussed the therapeutic effects of music on the soul. = Philosophy = Gerard of Cremona's Latin translation of Kitab ihsa' al-'ulum (\\"Encyclopedia of the Sciences\\") As a philosopher, Al-Farabi was a founder of his own school of early Islamic philosophy known as \\"Farabism\\" or \\"Alfarabism\\", though it was later overshadowed by Avicennism. Al-Farabi's school of philosophy \\"breaks with the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle [... and ...] moves from metaphysics to methodology, a move that anticipates modernity\\", and \\"at the level of philosophy, Alfarabi unites theory and practice [... and] in the sphere of the political he liberates practice from theory\\". His Neoplatonic theology is also more than just metaphysics as rhetoric. In his attempt to think through the nature of a First Cause, Alfarabi discovers the limits of human knowledge\\". Al-Farabi had great influence on science and philosophy for several centuries, and was widely considered second only to Aristotle in knowledge (alluded to by his title of \\"the Second Teacher\\") in his time. His work, aimed at synthesis of philosophy and Sufism, paved the way for the work of Ibn Sina (Avicenna). Al-Farabi also wrote a commentary on Aristotle's work, and one of his most notable works is Al-Madina al-Fadila () where he theorized an ideal state as in Plato's The Republic.Arabic and Islamic Natural Philosophy and Natural Science, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Al-Farabi argued that religion rendered truth through symbols and persuasion, and, like Plato, saw it as the duty of the philosopher to provide guidance to the state. Al-Farabi incorporated the Platonic view, drawing a parallel from within the Islamic context, in that he regarded the ideal state to be ruled by the prophet-imam, instead of the philosopher-king envisaged by Plato. Al-Farabi argued that the ideal state was the city-state of Medina when it was governed by the prophet Muhammad as its head of state, as he was in direct communion with Allah whose law was revealed to him. = Physics = Al-Farabi wrote a short treatise \\"On Vacuum\\", where he thought about the nature of the existence of void. He also may have carried out the first experiments concerning the existence of vacuum, in which he investigated handheld plungers in water. His final conclusion was that air's volume can expand to fill available space, and he suggested that the concept of perfect vacuum was incoherent. = Psychology = Wrote Social Psychology and Principles of the Opinions of the Citizens of the Virtuous City, which were the first treatises to deal with social psychology. He stated that \\"an isolated individual could not achieve all the perfections by himself, without the aid of other individuals,\\" and that it is the \\"innate disposition of every man to join another human being or other men in the labor he ought to perform.\\" He concluded that to \\"achieve what he can of that perfection, every man needs to stay in the neighborhood of others and associate with them.\\"Amber Haque (2004), \\"Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists\\", Journal of Religion and Health 43 (4): 357‚Äì377 [363]. In his treatise On the Cause of Dreams, which appeared as chapter 24 of his Principles of the Opinions of the Citizens of the Ideal City, he distinguished between dream interpretation and the nature and causes of dreams.  Philosophical thought  Pages from a 17th-century manuscript of Al-Farabi's commentary on Aristotle's metaphysics = Influences = The main influence on al-Farabi's philosophy was the neo-Aristotelian tradition of Alexandria. A prolific writer, he is credited with over one hundred works.Black, D. Al- Farabi in Leaman, O & Nasr, H (2001). History of Islamic Philosophy. London: Routledge. p178. Amongst these are a number of prolegomena to philosophy, commentaries on important Aristotelian works (such as the Nicomachean Ethics) as well as his own works. His ideas are marked by their coherency, despite drawing together of many different philosophical disciplines and traditions. Some other significant influences on his work were the planetary model of Ptolemy and elements of Neo-Platonism,Motahhari, Mortaza, Becoming familiar with Islamic knowledge, V1, p:162 particularly metaphysics and practical (or political) philosophy (which bears more resemblance to Plato's Republic than Aristotle's Politics).Reisman, D. Al-Farabi and the Philosophical Curriculum In Adamson, P & Taylor, R. (2005). The Cambridge Companion to Arabic Philosophy. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p52 = Al-Farabi, Aristotle, Maimonides = In the handing down of Aristotle‚Äôs thought to the Christian west in the middle ages, al-Farabi played an essential part as appears in the translation of Farabi‚Äôs Commentary and Short Treatise on Aristotle‚Äôs de Interpretatione that F.W. Zimmermann published in 1981. Farabi had a great influence on Maimonides, the most important Jewish thinker of the middle ages. Maimonides wrote in Arabic a Treatise on logic, the celebrated Maqala fi sina at al-mantiq. In a wonderfully concise way, the work treats of the essentials of Aristotelian logic in the light of comments made by the Persian philosophers: Avicenna and, above all, al-Farabi. R√©mi Brague in his book devoted to the Treatise stresses the fact that Farabi is the only thinker mentioned therein. Al-Farabi as well as Ibn Sina and Averroes have been recognized as Peripatetics (al-Mashsha‚Äôiyun) or rationalists (Estedlaliun) among Muslims.Motahhari, Morteza, Becoming familiar with Islamic knowledge, V1, p.166 ÿß⁄Øÿ± ÿ®ÿÆŸàÿßŸáŸäŸÖ ŸÉŸÑŸÖŸáÿß€å ÿ±ÿß ÿ®Ÿá ŸÉÿßÿ± ÿ®ÿ±ŸäŸÖ ŸÉŸá ŸÖŸÅŸäÿØ ŸÖŸÅŸáŸàŸÖ ÿ±Ÿàÿ¥ ŸÅŸÑÿ≥ŸÅ€å ŸÖÿ¥ÿßÿ¶ŸäŸÜ ÿ®ÿßÿ¥ÿØ ÿ®ÿßŸäÿØ ŸÉŸÑŸÖŸá ( ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿØŸÑÿßŸÑ€å ) ÿ±ÿß ÿ®Ÿá ŸÉÿßÿ± ÿ®ÿ±ŸäŸÖ . However, he tried to gather the ideas of Plato and Aristotle in his book \\"The gathering of the ideas of the two philosophers\\".Motahhari, Mortaza, Becoming familiar with Islamic knowledge, V1, p.167 ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿßÿ®€å ŸÉÿ™ÿßÿ® ŸÉŸà⁄ÜŸÉ ŸÖÿπÿ±ŸàŸÅ€å ÿØÿßÿ±ÿØ ÿ®Ÿá ŸÜÿßŸÖ ( ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÖÿπ ÿ®ŸäŸÜ ÿ±ÿ£Ÿä€å ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÉŸäŸÖŸäŸÜ ) ÿØÿ± ÿßŸäŸÜ ŸÉÿ™ÿßÿ® ŸÖÿ≥ÿßÿ¶ŸÑ ÿßÿÆÿ™ŸÑÿßŸÅ€å ÿßŸäŸÜ ÿØŸà ŸÅŸäŸÑÿ≥ŸàŸÅ ÿ∑ÿ±ÿ≠ ÿ¥ÿØŸá Ÿà ŸÉŸàÿ¥ÿ¥ ÿ¥ÿØŸá ŸÉŸá ÿ®Ÿá ŸÜÿ≠Ÿà€å ÿßÿÆÿ™ŸÑÿßŸÅÿßÿ™ ŸÖŸäÿßŸÜ ÿßŸäŸÜ ÿØŸà ÿ≠ŸÉŸäŸÖ ÿßÿ≤ ÿ®ŸäŸÜ ÿ®ÿ±ŸàÿØ . According to Adamson, his work was singularly directed towards the goal of simultaneously reviving and reinventing the Alexandrian philosophical tradition, to which his Christian teacher, Yuhanna bin Haylan belonged. His success should be measured by the honorific title of \\"the second master\\" of philosophy (Aristotle being the first), by which he was known. Adamson also says that he does not make any reference to the ideas of either al-Kindi or his contemporary, Abu Bakr al- Razi, which clearly indicates that he did not consider their approach to Philosophy as a correct or viable one.Reisman, p55  Thought  = Metaphysics and cosmology = In contrast to al-Kindi, who considered the subject of metaphysics to be God, al-Farabi believed that it was concerned primarily with being qua being (that is, being in and of itself), and this is related to God only to the extent that God is a principle of absolute being. Al-Kindi's view was, however, a common misconception regarding Greek philosophy amongst Muslim intellectuals at the time, and it was for this reason that Avicenna remarked that he did not understand Aristotle's Metaphysics properly until he had read a prolegomenon written by al- Farabi.Black, p188 Al-Farabi's cosmology is essentially based upon three pillars: Aristotelian metaphysics of causation, highly developed Plotinian emanational cosmology and the Ptolemaic astronomy.Reisman, p56 In his model, the universe is viewed as a number of concentric circles; the outermost sphere or \\"first heaven\\", the sphere of fixed stars, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and finally, the Moon. At the centre of these concentric circles is the sub-lunar realm which contains the material world.Black, p189 Each of these circles represent the domain of the secondary intelligences (symbolized by the celestial bodies themselves), which act as causal intermediaries between the First Cause (in this case, God) and the material world. Furthermore these are said to have emanated from God, who is both their formal and efficient cause. The process of emanation begins (metaphysically, not temporally) with the First Cause, whose principal activity is self- contemplation. And it is this intellectual activity that underlies its role in the creation of the universe. The First Cause, by thinking of itself, \\"overflows\\" and the incorporeal entity of the second intellect \\"emanates\\" from it. Like its predecessor, the second intellect also thinks about itself, and thereby brings its celestial sphere (in this case, the sphere of fixed stars) into being, but in addition to this it must also contemplate upon the First Cause, and this causes the \\"emanation\\" of the next intellect. The cascade of emanation continues until it reaches the tenth intellect, beneath which is the material world. And as each intellect must contemplate both itself and an increasing number of predecessors, each succeeding level of existence becomes more and more complex. This process is based upon necessity as opposed to will. In other words, God does not have a choice whether or not to create the universe, but by virtue of His own existence, He causes it to be. This view also suggests that the universe is eternal, and both of these points were criticized by al-Ghazzali in his attack on the philosophersReisman, p57Corbin, H. (1993). History of Islamic Philosophy. London: Keagan Paul International. p161 In his discussion of the First Cause (or God), al-Farabi relies heavily on negative theology. He says that it cannot be known by intellectual means, such as dialectical division or definition, because the terms used in these processes to define a thing constitute its substance. Therefore if one was to define the First Cause, each of the terms used would actually constitute a part of its substance and therefore behave as a cause for its existence, which is impossible as the First Cause is uncaused; it exists without being caused. Equally, he says it cannot be known according to genus and differentia, as its substance and existence are different from all others, and therefore it has no category to which it belongs. If this were the case, then it would not be the First Cause, because something would be prior in existence to it, which is also impossible. This would suggest that the more philosophically simple a thing is, the more perfect it is. And based on this observation, Adamson says it is possible to see the entire hierarchy of al-Farabi's cosmology according to classification into genus and species. Each succeeding level in this structure has as its principal qualities multiplicity and deficiency, and it is this ever-increasing complexity that typifies the material world.Reisman, p58-59 = Epistemology and eschatology = Human beings are unique in al- Farabi's vision of the universe because they stand between two worlds: the \\"higher\\", immaterial world of the celestial intellects and universal intelligibles, and the \\"lower\\", material world of generation and decay; they inhabit a physical body, and so belong to the \\"lower\\" world, but they also have a rational capacity, which connects them to the \\"higher\\" realm. Each level of existence in al-Farabi's cosmology is characterized by its movement towards perfection, which is to become like the First Cause, i.e. a perfect intellect. Human perfection (or \\"happiness\\"), then, is equated with constant intellection and contemplation.Reisman, p61 Al-Farabi divides intellect into four categories: potential, actual, acquired and the Agent. The first three are the different states of the human intellect and the fourth is the Tenth Intellect (the moon) in his emanational cosmology. The potential intellect represents the capacity to think, which is shared by all human beings, and the actual intellect is an intellect engaged in the act of thinking. By thinking, al-Farabi means abstracting universal intelligibles from the sensory forms of objects which have been apprehended and retained in the individual's imagination. This motion from potentiality to actuality requires the Agent Intellect to act upon the retained sensory forms; just as the Sun illuminates the physical world to allow us to see, the Agent Intellect illuminates the world of intelligibles to allow us to think.Reisman, p64 This illumination removes all accident (such as time, place, quality) and physicality from them, converting them into primary intelligibles, which are logical principles such as \\"the whole is greater than the part\\". The human intellect, by its act of intellection, passes from potentiality to actuality, and as it gradually comprehends these intelligibles, it is identified with them (as according to Aristotle, by knowing something, the intellect becomes like it).Reisman, p63 Because the Agent Intellect knows all of the intelligibles, this means that when the human intellect knows all of them, it becomes associated with the Agent Intellect's perfection and is known as the acquired Intellect.Black, p186 While this process seems mechanical, leaving little room for human choice or volition, Reisman says that al-Farabi is committed to human voluntarism. This takes place when man, based on the knowledge he has acquired, decides whether to direct himself towards virtuous or unvirtuous activities, and thereby decides whether or not to seek true happiness. And it is by choosing what is ethical and contemplating about what constitutes the nature of ethics, that the actual intellect can become \\"like\\" the active intellect, thereby attaining perfection. It is only by this process that a human soul may survive death, and live on in the afterlife.Corbin, p158 According to al-Farabi, the afterlife is not the personal experience commonly conceived of by religious traditions such as Islam and Christianity. Any individual or distinguishing features of the soul are annihilated after the death of the body; only the rational faculty survives (and then, only if it has attained perfection), which becomes one with all other rational souls within the agent intellect and enters a realm of pure intelligence. Henry Corbin compares this eschatology with that of the Ismaili Neo-Platonists, for whom this process initiated the next grand cycle of the universe.Corbin, p165 However, Deborah Black mentions we have cause to be skeptical as to whether this was the mature and developed view of al-Farabi, as later thinkers such as Ibn Tufayl, Averroes and Ibn Bajjah would assert that he repudiated this view in his commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics, which has been lost to modern experts. = Psychology, the soul and prophetic knowledge = In his treatment of the human soul, al-Farabi draws on a basic Aristotelian outline, which is informed by the commentaries of later Greek thinkers. He says it is composed of four faculties: The appetitive (the desire for, or aversion to an object of sense), the sensitive (the perception by the senses of corporeal substances), the imaginative (the faculty which retains images of sensible objects after they have been perceived, and then separates and combines them for a number of ends), and the rational, which is the faculty of intellection.Black, p184 It is the last of these which is unique to human beings and distinguishes them from plants and animals. It is also the only part of the soul to survive the death of the body. Noticeably absent from these scheme are internal senses, such as common sense, which would be discussed by later philosophers such as Avicenna and Averroes.Reisman, p60-61Black (2), D. Psychology: Soul and Intellect in Adamson, P and Taylor, R. (2005). The Cambridge Companion to Arabic Philosophy. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p313 Special attention must be given to al-Farabi's treatment of the soul's imaginative faculty, which is essential to his interpretation of prophethood and prophetic knowledge. In addition to its ability to retain and manipulate sensible images of objects, he gives the imagination the function of imitation. By this he means the capacity to represent an object with an image other than its own. In other words, to imitate \\"x\\" is to imagine \\"x\\" by associating it with sensible qualities that do not describe its own appearance. This extends the representative ability of the imagination beyond sensible forms and to include temperaments, emotions, desires and even immaterial intelligibles or abstract universals, as happens when, for example, one associates \\"evil\\" with \\"darkness\\".Black (b), p313Black, p185 The prophet, in addition to his own intellectual capacity, has a very strong imaginative faculty, which allows him to receive an overflow of intelligibles from the agent intellect (the tenth intellect in the emanational cosmology). These intelligibles are then associated with symbols and images, which allow him to communicate abstract truths in a way that can be understood by ordinary people. Therefore what makes prophetic knowledge unique is not its content, which is also accessible to philosophers through demonstration and intellection, but rather the form that it is given by the prophet's imagination.Corbin, p164Black, p187 = Practical philosophy (ethics and politics) = The practical application of philosophy was a major concern expressed by al-Farabi in many of his works, and while the majority of his philosophical output has been influenced by Aristotelian thought, his practical philosophy was unmistakably based on that of Plato.Corbin, p162 In a similar manner to Plato's Republic, al-Farabi emphasized that philosophy was both a theoretical and practical discipline; labeling those philosophers who do not apply their erudition to practical pursuits as \\"futile philosophers\\". The ideal society, he wrote, is one directed towards the realization of \\"true happiness\\" (which can be taken to mean philosophical enlightenment) and as such, the ideal philosopher must hone all the necessary arts of rhetoric and poetics to communicate abstract truths to the ordinary people, as well as having achieved enlightenment himself.Black, p190 Al-Farabi compared the philosopher's role in relation to society with a physician in relation to the body; the body's health is affected by the \\"balance of its humours\\" just as the city is determined by the moral habits of its people. The philosopher's duty, he wrote, was to establish a \\"virtuous\\" society by healing the souls of the people, establishing justice and guiding them towards \\"true happiness\\".Butterworth, p278 Of course, al- Farabi realized that such a society was rare and required a very specific set of historical circumstances to be realized, which means very few societies could ever attain this goal. He divided those \\"vicious\\" societies, which have fallen short of the ideal \\"virtuous\\" society, into three categories: ignorant, wicked and errant. Ignorant societies have, for whatever reason, failed to comprehend the purpose of human existence, and have supplanted the pursuit of happiness for another (inferior) goal, whether this be wealth, sensual gratification or power. Al-Farabi mentions \\"weeds\\" in the virtuous society: those people who try to undermine its progress towards the true human end.Black, p191 The best known Arabic source for al-Farabi's political philosophy is his work titled, al-Madina al-fadila (The Virtuous City). Whether or not al-Farabi actually intended to outline a political programme in his writings remains a matter of dispute amongst academics. Henry Corbin, who considers al-Farabi to be a crypto-Shi'ite, says that his ideas should be understood as a \\"prophetic philosophy\\" instead of being interpreted politically.Corbin, p162-163 On the other hand, Charles Butterworth contends that nowhere in his work does al-Farabi speak of a prophet-legislator or revelation (even the word philosophy is scarcely mentioned), and the main discussion that takes place concerns the positions of \\"king\\" and \\"statesmen\\".Butterworth, C. Ethical and Political Philosophy in Adamson, P and Taylor, R. (2005). The Cambridge Companion to Arabic Philosophy. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p276 Occupying a middle position is David Reisman, who, like Corbin, believes that al-Farabi did not want to expound a political doctrine (although he does not go so far to attribute it to Islamic Gnosticism either). He argues that al-Farabi was using different types of society as examples, in the context of an ethical discussion, to show what effect correct or incorrect thinking could have.Reisman, p68 Lastly, Joshua Parens argues that al-Farabi was slyly asserting that a pan-Islamic society could not be made, by using reason to show how many conditions (such as moral and deliberative virtue) would have to be met, thus leading the reader to conclude that humans are not fit for such a society.Joshua Parens, An Islamic Philosophy of Virtuous Religions: Introducing Alfarabi (New York: State University of New York Press, 2006), 2. Some other authors such as Mykhaylo Yakubovych argue that for al-Farabi religion (milla) and philosophy (falsafa) constituted the same praxeological value (i.e. basis for amal al- fadhil‚Äî\\"virtuous deed\\"), while its epistemological level (ilm‚Äî\\"knowledge\\") was different.Mykhaylo Yakubovych.

Her acting career spanned eight decades‚Äîfrom silent film to sound film, including theatre, radio, and television‚Äîand her performance in The Broadway Melody (1929) earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.  Early life  Horton as a child in Texas Love was born Juanita Horton in Midland, Texas, to John Cross Horton and Emma Jane Horton (' Savage). Her father was a cowboy and bartender, while her mother worked in and managed restaurants. She attended school in Midland until she was in the eighth grade, when her family moved to Arizona, New Mexico, and then to California, where they settled in Hollywood. When in Hollywood, her father became a chiropractor, and her mother worked at the Jantzen's Knitwear and Bathing Suits factory.  Career  = The silent era =  1915‚Äì20: Young ingenue  Love as Hulda, the Swedish maid, in The Flying Torpedo (1916), her second onscreen appearance In June 1915, while a student at Los Angeles High School, Horton went to the set of a film to meet with actor Tom Mix, who had recommended that she visit him if she wanted to \\"get into pictures\\". However, when Mix was unavailable, she was advised to meet with pioneering film director D. W. Griffith, who put her under personal contract. When it was decided that her given name was too long for theater marquees and too difficult to pronounce, Griffith's associate Frank Woods gave Horton the stage name Bessie Love: \\"Bessie, because any child can pronounce it. And Love, because we want everyone to love her!\\" Love dropped out of high school to pursue her film career, but she completed her diploma in 1919. Griffith gave her a small role in his Intolerance (1916). Although Intolerance was her first performance to be filmed, it was her ninth film to be released. The first films Love made were with Griffith's Fine Arts company, yet Intolerance was the only film that he formally directed. Her \\"first role of importance\\"‚Äîin the second of her films to be released‚Äîwas in The Flying Torpedo (1916). She later appeared opposite William S. Hart in The Aryan and with Douglas Fairbanks in The Good Bad-Man, Reggie Mixes In, and The Mystery of the Leaping Fish (all 1916). This string of appearances and supporting roles led to her first starring role, in A Sister of Six (1916). In her early career, she was likened to Mary Pickford, and was called \\"Our Mary\\" by Griffith. As her roles got larger, her popularity gradually grew. In early 1918, Love left Fine Arts for a better contract with Path√©. After the Path√© films were unsuccessful, she signed a nine-film contract with Vitagraph later that year, all of which were directed by David Smith. Her performances often received positive reviews, but her films often were shown at smaller movie theaters, which impacted the growth of her career.  1921‚Äì28: Dramatic actress  Upon the completion of her Vitagraph contract, Love became a free agent. She took an active role in the management of her career, and was represented by Gerald C. Duffy, the former editor of Picture-Play Magazine. With Victory Bateman in Human Wreckage (1923) Love sought roles that were different from the little girls she had portrayed earlier in her career when under contract to studios. She played Asian women in The Vermilion Pencil (1922) and The Purple Dawn (1923); a drug- addicted mother in Human Wreckage (1923); a woman accused of murder in The Woman on the Jury (1924); an underworld flapper in Those Who Dance (1924); and versions of her real-life self in Night Life in Hollywood (1922), Souls for Sale (1923), and Mary of the Movies (1923). As a film star, she was expected to entertain studio executives at parties, so she learned to sing, dance, and play the ukulele. She gradually honed these skills and later performed them onscreen and on the stage. Because of her performance in The King on Main Street (1925), Love is credited with being the first person to dance the Charleston on film,In The King on Main Street: popularizing it in the United States. Her technique was documented in instructional guides, including a series of photographs by Edward Steichen. She subsequently performed the dance the following year in The Song and Dance Man.In The Song and Dance Man:  In 1925, she starred in The Lost World, a science fiction adventure based on the novel of the same name by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In 1927, she appeared in the successful Dress Parade, and was so impressed by her experiences on location that she wrote the unpublished novel Military Mary. A year later, she starred in The Matinee Idol, a romantic comedy directed by a young Frank Capra. Despite these successes, Love's career was on the decline. She lived frugally so that she could afford lessons in singing and dancing. = The sound era and stage work =  1929‚Äì30: Musical comedy star  Love, photographed by Ruth Harriet Louise to promote The Broadway Melody (1929) Love toured with a musical revue for sixteen weeks, which was so physically demanding that she broke a rib. The experience she gained on the vaudeville stage singing and dancing in three performances a day prepared her for the introduction of sound films. She appeared in the successful sound musical short film The Swell Head in early 1928, and was signed to MGM later that year. In 1929, she appeared in her first feature-length sound film, the musical The Broadway Melody. Her performance earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and the success of the film resulted in a five-year contract with MGM and an increase in her weekly salary from to $3,000 ()‚Äî$1,000 more than her male co-star Charles King. She appeared in several other early musicals, including 1929's The Hollywood Revue of 1929 and 1930's Chasing Rainbows, Good News, and They Learned About Women. Her success in these musicals earned her the title \\"the screen's first musical comedy star.\\"  1931‚Äì43: Semi-retirement  However, the popularity of musical films waned, again putting her career in decline. Love is quoted as saying of her career: \\"I guess I'm through. They don't seem to want me any more.\\" She shifted focus to her personal life, marrying in December 1929. She semi- retired from films, and traveled with a musical revue that included clips from her films The Broadway Melody, The Hollywood Revue, and Chasing Rainbows. While on tour, she learned she was pregnant with her daughter, who was born in 1932. Love stopped her stage work to raise her daughter. In 1935, Love moved to England, briefly returning to the United States in 1936 to obtain a divorce. During World War II in Britain, when it was difficult to find employment as an actress, Love worked as the script supervisor on the film drama San Demetrio London (1943). She also worked for the American Red Cross.  1944‚Äì83: Working actress  After the war, Love began acting again, this time primarily in the theater and on BBC Radio as a member of their Drama Repertory Company; she also played small roles in British films, often as an American tourist. Stage work included such productions as Love in Idleness (1944) and Born Yesterday (1947). She wrote and performed in The Homecoming, a semiautobiographical play, which opened in Perth, Scotland in 1958. Film work included The Barefoot Contessa (1954) with Humphrey Bogart, and Ealing Studios' Nowhere to Go (1958), and she had supporting roles in The Greengage Summer (1961) starring Kenneth More, the James Bond thriller On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), and John Schlesinger's Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971). In addition to playing the mother of Vanessa Redgrave's titular character in Isadora (1968), Love also served as dialect coach to the actress. When television became popular, Love appeared in dozens of episodes of British television shows in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. In October 1963, she became the subject of This Is Your Life when host Eamonn Andrews surprised her at the stage door of Never Too Late after its London opening. Guests included London Scrapbook director Derrick De Marney, her Forget Me Not (1922) co-star Gareth Hughes, actor Percy Marmont, her friend and Those Who Dance (1924) co-star Blanche Sweet, and her daughter Patricia. Love appeared in John Osborne's play West of Suez (1971), and as \\"Aunt Pittypat\\" in a large-scale musical version of Gone with the Wind (1972). She also played Maud Cunard in the TV miniseries Edward & Mrs. Simpson in 1978. Her film work continued in the 1980s with roles in Ragtime (1981), Reds (1981), Lady Chatterley's Lover (1981), and‚Äîher final film‚ÄîThe Hunger (1983).  Personal life  Wedding portrait of Love and Hawks Love married agent William Hawks at St. James' Episcopal Church in South Pasadena, California on December 27, 1929. Mary Astor (Hawks's sister-in-law), Carmel Myers, and Norma Shearer were among her bridesmaids, with Irving Thalberg and Hawks's brother Howard serving as ushers. Following their wedding, the couple lived at the Havenhurst Apartments in Hollywood, and their only child, Patricia, was born in 1932. Four years later, the couple divorced. Love moved to England with her daughter in 1935, a year before her divorce was final. Her life in England kept her out of the eye of her American fans, which resulted in the American press erroneously reporting her as dead multiple times. Love became a British subject in the late 1960s. Love was a Christian Scientist. = Later years and death = After several years of declining health, Love died at the Mount Vernon Hospital in Northwood, London from natural causes on April 26, 1986. Her ashes are interred at Breakspear Crematorium in Ruislip, Hillingdon, England.  Legacy  Love's star on Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6777 Hollywood Blvd. Cartoonist Alex Gard created a caricature of Love for Sardi's, the famed restaurant in Manhattan's Theater District. It is now part of the Billy Rose Theatre Division of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. Portraits of Love are also in the collections of the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. and the National Portrait Gallery in London. Love periodically was interviewed by film historians, and was featured in the television documentary series The Hollywood Greats (1978) and Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film (1980), both about early filmmaking in Hollywood. She also loaned materials from her personal collection to museums. In 1962, she began contributing articles about her experiences to The Christian Science Monitor.Twenty-one articles were published over eighteen years: * First article: * Final article: In 1977, she published an autobiography entitled From Hollywood with Love.
