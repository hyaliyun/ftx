His areas of practice are white collar criminal defense, LA-based entertainment litigation, and political sagas, and has been involved in high-profile criminal trials. Early career Sun went to the University of Southern California for his undergraduate studies and for law school. In 1976, he graduated magna cum laude from University of Southern California and obtained his juris doctor degree in 1979. His work experience in law school included internships at the Securities and Exchange Commission and US Attorney's Office, both experiences helped him develop an interest in criminal law. After his graduation, Brian clerked for the Honorable A. Andrew Hauk, United States District Court Judge for the Central District of California. In 1982, Brian became an Assistant United States Attorney, where he prosecuted drug and related money laundering crimes. The latter experience would be put to use when he gave Congressional testimony to Congress on the subject in 1982 and helped draft a bill to counter such money laundering. Between 1984 and 1986, he served as the section chief of the Financial Investigations Unit for the United States Department of Justice. Espionage and foreign government influence cases The Justice Department investigated fundraising activities related to the 1996 election campaigns, leading to allegations of a covert plot by the Chinese government to influence American politics. Sun represented Democratic Party fundraiser Johnny Chung one of the key figures subject to the investigation. Chung was charged with funneling illegal campaign contributions through use of straw donors for the Clinton reelection campaign. As part of a plea agreement, Chung plead guilty to charges of tax evasion, bank fraud, and conspiracy related to the illegal contributions and although faced with 37 years was able to avoid any prison time. Sun formed part of the team that represented Wen Ho Lee, who in 2000 was accused by the US government of espionage. He led the civil suit side of legal efforts, charging the Department of Energy for violation of Lee's privacy in a lawsuit. The criminal case against Lee later ended with his release and an apology from the federal judge who presided over the proceedings to Lee for unfair treatment. Lee initiated his civil action against the government for invasion of privacy in 1999 and settled in 2006 for $1,645,000, with five media organizations paying for half the settlement amount. Sun noted to The New York Times that the settlement had the unusual stipulation imposed by the government that the government half of the settlement amount could not go to Lee but would instead go to pay \\"lawyers' fees, litigation costs, and taxes.\\" The particular expertise Sun gained in the Wen Ho Lee defense on the rules for the disclosure of classified information in criminal cases was put to use again in 2003 when he defended James J. Smith, a FBI counterintelligence agent on the China squad, who was charged with providing classified information to Katrina Leung, a businesswoman in Los Angeles. The US Senate Subcommittee on Investigations published a report in 2010 detailing the findings of a probe on transfers of corruption tainted funds from African countries. Sun represented an American lawyer alleged by the committee to have helped the son of Equatorial Guinea President Teodoro Obiang Nguema in making transfers when the attorney was called to testify before the Senate panel. Entertainment business law In Blix Street Records v. Gelbard, a licensing dispute between Blix Street Records and Eva Cassidy Partners, a business partnership that included the parents of Eva Cassidy, Sun represented Eva Cassidy Partners. Sun was criminal counsel to Elie Samaha during an FBI investigation tied to his dispute with Intertainment, a German financier of movies produced under his company Franchise Pictures. White collar criminal defense In the wake of the 1994 Orange County bankruptcy, several public officials faced criminal and civil charges including Steve E. Lewis, the then auditor-controller of the county, who was represented by Sun. Sun represented Mike Carona, a former sheriff of Orange County, who was put on trial for conspiracy and mail fraud charges. The government's case relied on damning statements made by Carona while taped by a government informant. Sun portrayed the statements made on the tapes as false chest thumping and argued the government witnesses were white collar felons looking to escape punishment by testifying against Carona. The outcome was favorable to Carona who was acquitted of five of the six charges and convicted of the remaining charge of witness tampering. Carona called the acquittals an \\"absolute miracle.\\" External links *Jones Day profile References 1954 births Living people American people of Chinese descent Members of Committee of 100 People from Monterey Park, California University of Southern California alumni USC Gould School of Law alumni American law firm executives ","title":"Brian Sun"},{"id":"36577174","text":"Aliaksandr Mikalayevich Buikevich (, ; born 19 November 1984) is a Belarusian sabre fencer, European champion in 2008 and team silver medallist at the 2011 World Championships in Catania.

As part of Romania's sabre team, he won the team silver medal in the 2012 Summer Olympics and the team gold medal in the 2009 World Championships in Antalya. Fencing career =Junior= Dolniceanu began fencing at age 13 under the coaching of Iulian Bițucă at CSM Iași. The absence of his parents, who had gone to work in Italy, pushed him to train hard. He took his first international podium in the Junior World Cup in Budapest in 2006. The same year, he earned a silver medal in the Junior World Championships in Poznań, after being defeated by future Olympic champion Áron Szilágyi. He took the bronze medal in the Junior European Championships in Prague in 2007 and reached number one in junior rankings in early 2008. =2008–2012= His progress was slower amongst seniors, but he joined the national sabre team. Along with Florin Zalomir, Cosmin Hănceanu, and Rareș Dumitrescu, Romania created a surprise by beating favourite Italy to win the gold medal in the 2009 World Championships in Antalya. For this performance, Dolniceanu and his teammates received the Order of Sports Merit, class IIa. The same team went on to win the bronze in the 2010 World Championships in Paris. Dolniceanu transferred in 2011 to CS Dinamo București and began training under Mihai Covaliu, who also coaches the national team. He took part in the 2012 Summer Olympics, but was beaten in the second round by United States' Daryl Homer. In the team event, sixth-seeded Romania disposed of China 45–30 to meet Russia in the semi-finals. Dolniceanu gave his team a 20-17 lead, but a crash with Nikolay Kovalev awakened a right- ankle sprain sustained during the 2012 European Championships; he also broke a nail on his weapon hand and had to receive medical treatment. Romania were dominated 45-26 by South Korea in the final, Dolniceanu being the only one to win a bout, and took the silver medal. =After the London Games= Reshetnikov in the 2013 World Championships After the Games three of the four members of the Olympic team chose to retire, Formerly the team's benjamin, Dolniceanu became captain of the new team, with Alin Badea and Ciprian Gălățeanu as full members and Iulian Teodosiu and Mădălin Bucur as reserves. Dolniceanu began the 2012–13 season with a silver medal in the Plovdiv Grand Prix. In the European Championships in Zagreb, he defeated 15–11 the three-time incumbent Aleksey Yakimenko of Russia to win the individual gold medal. An injury sustained in the quarter-final prevented him from taking part in the team event, which Romania finished in the fourth place. Dolniceanu went to earn the bronze medal and the team silver medal in the World Fencing Championships in Budapest. He also won the silver in the 2013 World Combat Games. For these performances he was voted sportsman of the year by the Romanian Sport Press Association and fencer of the year by the Romanian Fencing Federation. In the 2013–14 season Dolniceanu won the bronze medal in the first stage of the World Cup in Madrid. This result pushed him to the first place in world rankings. He went on to win in Moscow the first World Cup tournament of his career after defeating Korea's Kim Jung-hwan. In March he helped his club CS Dinamo to win the European Champion Clubs' Cup in Gödöllő, after prevailing over Áron Szilágyi's Vasas SC, at the price of a right-foot tendon injury during the final. He sustained another injury, this time to the left ankle, at the Plovdiv World Cup, where he posted a third place. At the 2014 European Championships he was stopped in the second round by France's Nicolas Rousset. In the team event Romania were defeated in the quarter-finals by Belarus and placed fifth after the ranking matches. At the 2014 World Championships Dolniceanu reached the semifinals, but he was defeated by Russia's Kovalev, against whom he had prevailed in the same phase at the 2013 European championships, and came away with his second bronze medal in a row. In the team event Romania met South Korea in quarter-finals. After a promising beginning for Romania Dolniceanu lost the pace against Kim Jung-hwan. They failed to make up lost ground and lost eventually on a 41–45 score. Romania finished seventh after the ranking matches. Romania's head coach Mihai Covaliu was quoted saying: “This kind of 'block' can happen to the greatest of fencers. I hope Tibi learns from it.” Dolniceanu finished the season no.5 in world rankings. Thanks to his bronze medal he was named fencer of the year by the Romanian Fencing Federation for the second year in a row. In the 2014–15 season Dolniceanu failed to get past the table of 16 in Budapest, New York and Padova: he was defeated respectively by teammate Teodosiu and two South Koreans. He was happier in the team competition, striking the decisive hit in the final against Italy in Budapest and winning gold for Romania. He also led CS Dinamo to a silver medal in the European Champion Clubs' Cup in Padova. He reached the semi-finals of the men's individual sabre at the 2016 Olympics. There was no team event.

She attended St. Ambrose, St. Mary's, Latimer and Allegheny high schools. In her spare time, she went to Cowley Recreation Center on Troy Hill enjoying basketball, softball, swimming and ice skating. As a teenager, she was a member of the Pittsburgh Rockets basketball team, even though her favorite pastime was playing softball. She joined the league in 1950 with the Rockford Peaches.1950 Rockford Peaches. Retrieved 2019-03-28. After spring training camp, Rockford decided that Cornett was not ready for the league and sent her to the Springfield Sallies rookie touring team to acquire more experience. In 1951 she was promoted to the Kalamazoo Lassies and was dealt to the Battle Creek Belles before the 1952 season.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary – W.C.

She was best suited for the third base job, but she hit a paltry .147 average in 47 games and Battle Creek did not offer her a contract the next season. ″Curly″, as her teammates called her for her drooping hair, still wanted to play, so she had to wait five years to regain her amateur status again. Then she played successfully in Northwest Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania softball leagues until 1970. Cornett also worked for H. J. Heinz Company in Pennsylvania during 24 years, retiring in 1987 after being diagnosed with CREST syndrome. After that, she was invited to several AAGPBL Players Association reunions. The association was largely responsible for the opening of Women in Baseball, a permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, which was inaugurated in November 1988. In addition, a photograph of Cornett in her wheelchair is featured at the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum next to an enlarged copy of her AAGPBL baseball card, while a second-floor display still holds her baseball glove, cap and spikes.

He is a four-time European Champion, team World Champion and two- time Olympic participant. He is chairman of the Athletes Commission in the DOSB and founding president of Athleten Deutschland e.V. He was a member of the Sporthilfe supervisory board for four years, four years in the board of the German Fencing Federation and two years in the board of the German Olympic Comitee as the voice of the athletes. He completed his studies in politics, sociology and economics at the Zeppelin University in Friedrichshafen and the Universteit Gent. With Athletes Germany, Hartung achieved a victory over IOC before the Federal Cartel Office. The advertising guidelines for German athletes at Olympic Games have been relaxed. Following public criticism, the German Armed Forces have changed their sports promotion program after talks between Minister of Defense Ursula von der Leyen, Silke Kassner and Max Hartung. The Athletes Germany e. V, which he co-founded, is supported by the federal government with 450,000 euros per year and is the first athlete representation worldwide that is independent of the NOK. In addition, on the initiative of Athletes Germany, the federal government has introduced direct athlete support of 7 million euros for the first time and passed a pension package for athletes. Hartung drew attention to himself around the postponement of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. He was the first athlete in the world to declare before the official decision of the IOC that he would not compete in the Summer Olympics in July 2020 due to the corona pandemic out of consideration for the population living in Japan and global health protection. Shortly thereafter, athletes from Canada and Australia also cancelled their participation in the 2020 Summer Olympics. The Summer Olympics of the 32nd Olympiad of Modern Times have been postponed to July 23, 2021. Hartung, who has already qualified for individual and team events, is currently preparing to participate.  Sports Career  At the Olympic Games in London, Max Hartung took seventh place in the individual competition and fifth place with the team. At the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Hartung took 10th place. Probably his greatest sporting success is the historic win of the world championship with the team in 2014 - a feat that no German team has ever achieved before. In 2017 he won the European championship title in Tbilisi in the individual competition and was able to defend this title in Novi Sad in 2018. In 2019 he became European champion with the German team in a dramatic final in front of his home crowd in Düsseldorf. Hartung starts in Germany for TSV Bayer Dormagen. He was able to win 15 national titles during his fencing career.  Voluntary commitment  In 2013 he was elected athlete spokesman of the German Fencing Federation. Since September 2014, Hartung has also been a member of the Athletes' Commission of the DOSB, since February 2017 he has been its chairman. He is also a member of the supervisory board of the Stiftung deutsche Sporthilfe. He is the founding president of Athleten Deutschland e.V. After the challenges of the athletes' representatives in the DOSB in the years 2014 to 2016, the Athletes' Commission decided to found an independent association, independent of the DOSB, to strengthen the athletes' interests. Decisive factors for the founding of the association were the dissatisfaction with the doping scandal in Russia, the many cases of sexualized violence in sports, the competitive sports reform with a strong medal focus and the introduction of the anti-doping law. Athletes Germany today has 450,000 Euro annually and employs five staff. The club fights for a German sports system that offers athletes the best conditions in the world for developing their sporting and personal potential and respects them as human beings. It fights for athletes in all arenas and encourages them to shape the future of their sport themselves. The organization aims to enable athletes to improve communication between athletes and institutions. Athletes Germany shall represent the interests of the athletes towards the federations, but also towards all other actors in sports, politics and society and develop the legal relationship and the nomination procedures between athletes and federations. The association has set itself the goal of promoting athlete support that enables athletes to embark on a competitive sports career without having to fear disadvantages or existential fears, and that promotes fair and clean sports.  Podcast  With his team mate Matyas Szabo, Hartung runs the largest German-language fencing podcast. On the way to the Olympic Games in Tokyo 2020, the two of them recorded more than 40 episodes and let the audience take a look behind the mask. During the lockdown, the team also recorded training videos for children who had no access to their gyms and published them on YouTube. They have been awarded for this project by Beyond Crisis and Germany Land of Ideas.

He was also a silver medalist at the 2015 World Fencing Championships, and is a five-time gold medalist at the Pan American Fencing Championships. Personal life Homer was born on St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands to Juliette Smith and Daryl Homer. At the age of 5, Homer moved to New York City with his mother and younger sister D’Meca, to an apartment on Gun Hill Road in the Bronx. Homer attended Public School 21 their before going to Salesian High School in New Rochelle. He eventually graduated from St. John’s University with a degree in advertising communications. He now works for advertising and marketing agency Anomaly. Homer regularly speaks to inner city youth about balancing his career with his athletic passions. He is a brand ambassador at Fencing in the Schools, a non-profit that aims to enrich the lives of students in the inner city through fencing. The program focuses on the health benefits, life skills, and exposure fencing can give to students in some of the most impoverished neighborhoods. The program has trained teachers in Utah, Chicago, Newark, New York City, and Vermont. Fencing career Homer (R) scores from a flunge at the 2015 World Fencing Championships Homer started fencing at the age of eleven, after happening on a picture of a masked fencer in the dictionary, and finding it \\"very cool\\". He joined the Peter Westbrook Foundation in New York City, a program dedicated to exposing inner city youth to fencing started by six-time Olympian and 1984 Olympic bronze medalist Peter Westbrook. Homer chose saber because Westbrook himself had been a sabreur. Homer was quickly identified as a talented athlete, and began working with four-time Olympic coach Yury Gelman immediately. He won a bronze medal at the 2007 Cadet World Fencing Championships, and another bronze at the 2009 Junior World Championships in Belfast. That same year he competed in his first senior World Championships in Antalya, finishing 23rd, and took the NCAA title as a sophomore.

The next season, he won the gold medal at the 2011 Pan American Championships, after prevailing in the final over Canada's Vincent Couturier. He redshirted the following season to train for the 2012 Summer Olympics, for which he qualified as a member of the top-ranked team of the Americas zone.

In December 1874, in a convention held in Pinopolis, with members of four parishes, after the rejection of four black men from the ministry by the Protestant Episcopal Church, it was decided to leave the Diocese of South Carolina and to seek membership with the newly created Reformed Episcopal Church. In the same convention, Frank Crawford Ferguson was elected President and wrote to the Presiding Bishop of the Reformed Episcopal Church, George Cummins. In June 1875, he received a letter by Benjamin Johnson, explaining that he had been sent by the General Council of the REC to receive all the black people willing to join the denomination.The Diocese of the Southeast of the Reformed Episcopal Church: A Brief History The new body would be the Missionary Jurisdiction of the South, named Diocese of the Southeast when the division into dioceses was adopted in 1984.

The face value of the stamp is 8 fen. Taiwan was not shaded red as at the time of printing, it was (and remains so today) under the control of the Republic of China instead of the PRC. The official reason given for the withdrawal of the stamp was that the Spratly and Paracel Islands were missing from the map, as well as the borders with Mongolia, Bhutan, and Myanmar being incorrectly drawn.Far East Collector's Guide, a supplement to Gibbons Stamp Monthly, November, 2011, p. 3. The stamp had been distributed for less than half a day when an editor at SinoMaps Press noticed the problem with Taiwan and reported it to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. As a result, all Chinese post offices had to stop selling the stamp and return all copies, with only a small quantity making it to private collectors. The designer of the stamp, Wang Weisheng, said in an AFP interview, \\"For a long time I was really worried that I would be jailed\\".

Bezozzi, the fourth generation of this traditional family of wind instrument musicians, composed mainly piano and choral works as well as a four-volume work with exercises for choral singing. Biography Born in Versailles, Louis Besozzi belonged a family of artists from Italy, many of them with a reputation of being instrumental in Turin, Naples and Dresden. His great-great grandfather Giuseppe Besozzi was an oboist in Parma,. his great-grandfather Gaetano Besozzi oboist at the court of Naples and later in the chapel of Versailles, his grandfather Girolamo Besozzi oboist in the service of the King of France and his father Henri Besozzi flutist at the Opéra-Comique. He entered the Conservatoire de Paris on 18 July 1825 as a pupil of Auguste Barbereau (piano) and Jean-François Lesueur (composition)... From 1831 he worked at the Conservatory as successor of Ferdinand Gasse in solfège and later as piano teacher at the École de musique classique et religieuse of Louis Niedermeyer, where he was succeeded by Camille Saint-Saëns in 1865. Many times a prize winner at the Conservatory, he won the 1837 Grand Prix de Rome and went on to study at the French Academy in Rome, where he met Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Charles Gounod, Dominique Papety and others. Later he devoted his life to teaching popular music and the development of orfeónic societies, for which he wrote his Solfèges, des exercices et des méthodes d'apprentissage. In 1852, Besozzi succeeded Louis Braille on the Cavaillé-Coll organ, built in 1845 in the Church of St. Vincent de Paul. He had attended the inaugural ceremony for this great organ on 26 January 1852, but his career as organist remained unsuccessful. After several candidates, Johann Peter Cavallo was selected. Besozzi died in Paris.

Arnold was educated at the Slade School of Fine Art before attending the London County Council (LCC) Central School of Arts and Crafts where he studied under Christopher Whall from 1989 to 1903. He designed stained glass windows for James Powell & Sons and also did some independent work. While an officer in the Northumberland Fusiliers, Arnold died on active service at Gallipoli in 1915. Some of Arnold's works were: * St. Cuthbert in Kirkby-in-Furness, Cumbria - This church has an Arnold window in the Chancel area which depicts St Aidan and St Cuthbert.Matthew Hyde and Nikolaus Pevsner. \\"The Buildings of England.\\" Cumbria: Cumberland, Westmoreland and Furness. * St Barnabas in Great Tey, Essex - In 1900 a window which was made by James Powell & Sons to Arnold’s design. It is a five-light window East window which depicted angels. * St John in Wimbledon, Outer London - In 1914 another Arnold designed window was executed by James Powell & Sons. It is a two-light window in the South side of the Nave. The window was created in memory of Charles Thomas Arnold, Hugh's father, who was one of the first trustees of the church. In one light, Arnold depicts Christ in Gethsemane with an angel and includes the text \\"Not my will, but thine be done\\". In the other light The Last Supper is depicted with the text \\"This is my blood which is shed for you\\".Information courtesy Mark Elliott * Holy Trinity in Coalbrookdale, Shropshire - In 1902 James Powell & Sons executed an Arnold designed three-light window in the South East area of the church. * Church of the Holy Cross in Crediton, Devon - In 1913 Arnold designed windows that reflected the church's history. The parish church dates mainly to the 15th Century but has some 12th and 13th Century remnants. In a roundel, Arnold depicts the Saxon Cathedral which Eadulph had begun to build on the site of the present church. Below is another roundel where the Charter granted by King Edward the Elder is depicted. Coats of Arms of the donors, Mr.and Miss Ingram Walker, are included in the design.

HaCohen is the Rosh yeshiva of Yeshivat Otniel (together with Rabbi Binyamin Kalmanzon) and the rabbi of the Israeli settlement of Otniel.  Biography  Re'em HaCohen was born in Jerusalem on 1 March, 1957 to Yedaya, a principal at Yeshivat Har Etzion and son of Zionist thinker Shmuel HaCohen Weingarten, and Dina, head of Midreshet Emuna and daughter of Zionist pioneer Natan Gardi. He was named after his great- grandfather, Rabbi Avraham Mordechai. He grew up on the border of Jerusalem's Rehavia and Sha'arei Hesed neighbourhoods. In his youth, Hacohen would frequently visit the house of Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach. He studied at Netiv Meir Yeshiva High School under Rabbis Arye Bina and David Fuks, and after that at Yeshivat Har Etzion in Alon Shvut under Rabbis Aharon Lichtenstein and Yehuda Amital. He served in the Israeli Armoured Corps and advanced to the rank of Major in the Reserves. HaCohen received semikhah from Rabbi Lichtenstein and Rabbi Eliezer Waldenberg (author of the halachic treatise Tzitz Eliezer). He also studied with Rabbi Sholom Eisen, a posek in the Edah HaChareidis. HaCohen served as a Ra\\"m at Yeshivat Or Etzion under Rabbi Haim Drukman and at Yeshivat Shvut Yisrael in Efrat. In 1994, he was invited by rabbis Binyamin Kalmanzon and Ami Ulami to be a Rosh Yeshiva at Yeshivat Otniel. After Ulami was murdered that year, HaCohen became the community rabbi of the town of Otniel. In the past, Rabbi HaCohen worked with the organisation \\"Circles of Justice\\". In 2006, he was nominated for the post of Chief Rabbi of the IDF. He serves on the judging panel of \\"Kane Lecha Chaver\\", a Torah competition run by Mifal HaPayis. = Family = Rabbi HaCohen and his wife Noa have 9 children. His son, Rabbi Uri HaCohen, is a Ra\\"m at Yeshivat Otniel. His oldest brother is Major-General Gershon HaCohen, a senior IDF officer. His other brothers are Rabbi Elyashiv HaCohen, Rosh yeshiva at Yeshivat Beit Shmuel in Hadera, Rabbi Aviya HaCohen, Ra\\"m at Yeshivat Tekoa, and Rabbi Chayim HaCohen, head of the Beit Yatir pre-army program. His brother-in-law is Rabbi Aharon Harel, head of Lev Chadash Yeshiva High School in Shilo.  Opinions and Philosophy  According to Rabbi HaCohen, the learning in the beit midrash must be connected to the outside world, as the inner parts of the Torah must be connected to the outer parts. For this reason, his teaching references many different sources ranging from academic and professional, to halachic and kabbalistic sources.http://www.otniel.org/english.asp?show=22911 Rabbi HaCohen's educational philosophy is characterised by contemplative independence. As a student of Rabbi Lichtenstein, he uses the Brisker method of learning Talmud. He is a student of Kabbalah, especially the teachings of the Ramchal, Chabad (in particular the Baal HaTanya) and Menahem Azariah da Fano. The teachings of Rav Kook are also central to his philosophy, particularly as they are interpreted by Rabbi David Cohen. HaCohen thinks that it is halachically binding to donate one's organs and have an organ donor card.http://www.otniel.org/show.asp?id=23918 He forbids smoking as a form of suicide. He requires his followers to wear techelet.

It bites off a piece of life. This is why it’s necessary to read stories. Life’s constancy of movement lulls us into a soporific acceptance. If you frame a portion of it, you lift it out of context. And suddenly, it can look very different. Tragedy can frame the continuous movement of life the same way a story does. For instance, we all know what we were doing on the morning of September 11, 2001. That morning has been lifted out of our lives and will always be separate. I know I’ve arrived at the ending of a story if I’ve taken it to a place where something has happened that removes that particular life out of its assumed trajectory. It no longer fits, and thus, hangs in suspension. A short story frames a piece of the movement of life in such a way that it can never go back into place.\\" Bibliography *A Length of Wire and Other Stories (1983) *She Wanted Something Else (1987) *The Notebook of Lost Things (1999) *Lessons In Another Language (2010) *The Exit Coach (2016) References 1952 births Living people American fiction writers Writers from Philadelphia ","title":"Megan Staffel"},{"id":"36578195","text":"John Fitzgerald (1914 – 7 October 1994) was an Irish Labour Party politician.

In a racing career lasting from July 1972 until October 1973 she ran eight times and won five races. Mysterious won Group races on her first four racecourse appearances including the Classic 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse and Oaks at Epsom. She later finished second to Dahlia in the Irish Oaks at the Curragh and won the Yorkshire Oaks at York. Background Mysterious was a chestnut filly with a narrow white blaze and white socks on her hind feet, bred in England by the California-based George Pope, Jr and raised at the Cliff Stud near Helmsley in Yorkshire. She was sired by The Derby winner Crepello out of Hill Shade an American-bred mare. Hill Shade won the Nassau Stakes and the Sun Chariot Stakes when trained in Britain and spent most of her breeding career in the United States where she produced several other winners including J. O. Tobin. Mysterious was sent into training with Noel Murless at his Warren Place stables in Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career Mysterious bypassed maiden races, beginning her career in the Group Three Cherry Hinton Stakes over six furlongs at the Newmarket July meeting. She won the race from two opponents but did not appear again in 1972. Mysterious made her first appearance as a three-year-old in the Group Three Fred Darling Stakes over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse. She defeated the Irish- trained favourite Grasse by three quarters of a length to take the event, a recognised trial for the 1000 Guineas. At Newmarket Mysterious was ridden as usual by Geoff Lewis and started at odds of 11/1 for the 1000 Guineas, with the Cheveley Park Stakes winner Jacinth being made odds-on favourite. Lewis sent Mysterious into the lead two furlongs from the finish and she won decisively, beating Jacinth by three lengths. Her win gave Murless a sixth success in the race, setting a 20th-century record. At Epsom a month later, Mysterious started 13/8 favourite for the Epsom Oaks against nine other fillies. Lewis restrained the filly in the early stages, before moving up along the inside to take the lead in the straight. Mysterious retained her undefeated record, winning easily by four lengths from Where You Lead. Mysterious started 1/2 favourite for the Irish Oaks in July, but was beaten three lengths by the French-trained filly Dahlia. Later that month Dahlia was a six length winner of Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. In the Yorkshire Oaks in August, Mysterious won comfortably from Virunga, a French filly who had finished second to Dahlia in the Prix Saint-Alary. Mysterious failed to reproduce her best form in her remaining two starts. She started odds-on favourite for the Sun Chariot Stakes but was beaten by Cheveley Princess, her only rival in a two-runner race. In October she finished sixth in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket. Retirement Mysterious spent her breeding career in the United States where she was bred to leading stallions including Northern Dancer, Mr. Prospector and Nijinsky. She produced several winners, but nothing approaching top class. Her most successful descendant has been Quest, whose wins included the Clark Handicap. Assessment and honours Mysterious was given a Timeform rating of 127. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Mysterious an \\"average\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas and Oaks.

The purpose of the assessment is to prove and aid the effectiveness of the interventions or treatments used to help eliminate the problem behavior. Through functional behavior assessments, we have learned that there are complex patterns to people's seemingly unproductive behaviors. It is important to not only pay attention to consequences that follow the behavior but also the antecedent that evokes the behavior. More work needs to be done in the future with functional assessment including balancing precision and efficiency, being more specific with variables involved and a more smooth transition from assessment to intervention. Definition Functional behavior assessment (FBA) is a method developed by applied behavior analysis (ABA) to identify the variables that maintain a problem behavior. Behavior is lawful. Whether it is desirable or undesirable, behavior is controlled by environmental variables. Behavior is a function of the antecedent and consequences that make up the three-term contingency. Functional assessment is the process of gathering information about the antecedent stimuli and consequences functional to the problem behavior. It attempts to provide an explanation to why the problem behavior may be occurring. The information about the antecedent stimuli may include the time and place, the presence of others and the frequency. The information collected helps identify which of the antecedent and consequences are maintaining the behavior. The information collected from functional assessment can also help develop appropriate treatments for the target behavior. Stimulus that may have been found to be reinforcing for the original behavior could be transferred to reinforce a more appropriate behavior. Functions of problem behavior The purpose of conducting a functional assessment is to identify the function of the target behavior. There are four main classes of functions of problem behavior. =Social positive reinforcement= Social positive reinforcement is when another person delivers a positive reinforcement after the problem behavior occurs. This is include the giving of attention, fun activities or goods and services provided by the person. An example of social positive reinforcement would be Max's mother (social) dropping what she is doing and provide attention (positive reinforcement) to her son when he engages in head banging on the wall (problem behavior). =Social negative reinforcement= Social negative reinforcement is when another person delivers a negative reinforcement after the problem behavior occurs. The person may terminate an aversive stimuli (interaction, task or activity) and the behavior is more likely to be maintained. An example of social negative reinforcement would be Max complains (problem behavior) to his parents (social) when he is asked to do chores, as a result, his parents allows him to escape the task (negative reinforcement). =Automatic positive reinforcement= Automatic positive reinforcement is when a positive reinforcement occurs automatically and is not mediated by another person. The behavior is strengthened by an automatic reinforcing consequence. An example of automatic positive reinforcement would be an autistic child waving his hands in front of his face (problem behavior) because the sensory stimulation (automatic positive reinforcement) produced is reinforcing for the child. =Automatic negative reinforcement= Automatic negative reinforcement is when a negative reinforcement occurs automatically reducing or eliminating an aversive stimulus as a reinforcing consequence of the behavior. A popular example of automatic negative reinforcement would be binge eating. Binge eating (problem behavior) had been found to temporarily reduce any unpleasant emotions the person may be experiencing before the binge (automatic negative reinforcement). Assessment methods There are various different methods used to conduct functional assessment, all of which falls into three distinct categories. =Indirect methods= Indirect functional assessment methods use behavior interviews or surveys to gather information about the person exhibiting the behavior from themselves others who know this person well. The main advantage of indirect methods is they are easy and cheap to conduct and do not take much time. The main disadvantage of indirect methods is that the people involved are relying on their memories, thus some information may be lost or inaccurate. Because of their convenience, indirect methods are used most commonly. It is essential assessment to be clear and objective as this will produce the most accurate answers without interpretation. The goal of the indirect assessment method is to generate information on the antecedent, behavior and consequence that can help generate a hypothesis about the variables that maintains the behavior. Indirect methods can help develop a correlation hypothesis but not a functional relationship. =Direct observation methods= Direct observation methods involve is present to observe and record the problem behavior as it occurs. The goal of direct observation is to record the immediate antecedent and consequences that functions with the problem behavior within a natural environment. The main advantage of direct observation is that the antecedents and consequences are recorded as it happens instead of recollection of memory. Therefore, the information recorded is generally more accurate. The main disadvantage of direct observation is it requires a considerable amount of time and effort to implement. Another thing about direct observation is, like indirect methods, it can only demonstrate a correlation but not a functional relationship. The observer of the direct observation method should be present in the natural environment when the problem behavior is most likely to occur. The observer should also be trained to record the problem behavior and its functional antecedent and consequences immediately, correctly and objectively. Direct observation can also be an ABC observation. Together with indirect methods, direct and indirect assessments are categorized as descriptive assessment because the antecedent and consequences are described from with memory of events. The information collected aids the development of a hypothesis, but to demonstrate a functional relationship, one must use the experimental method. =Experimental methods= Experimental methods involve manipulating either the antecedent or consequent variables to determine their influence on the problem behavior. This is the only method that can demonstrate a functional relationship between the antecedent stimulus or the reinforcing consequence and the problem behavior. The main advantage of the experimental method is the demonstration of a functional relationship. The main disadvantage of the experimental method is the extensive use of time and effort to create an experiment. Experimental methods can also be called experimental analysis or functional analysis. For more information please visit functional analysis. Conducting a functional assessment A functional assessment should always be conducted before treating a problem behavior. To develop appropriate treatment, one must have the correct information about the antecedents and consequences controlling the behavior because treatment involves manipulating these environmental events to evoke a change in the problem behavior. Here is the proper procedure to correctly implement a functional assessment. # The first step should start with a behavioral interview with the client or someone who knows him/her well. # The interview from the first step should help develop a hypothesis about which antecedent would produce the behavior and which reinforcing consequence would maintain it. # Once a hypothesis has been formed, the next step is to conduct a direct observation assessment in the natural environment. If the data collected from the interview is consistent with the observation, the validity of the hypothesis is strengthened. # With the information from both sources being consistent, confirm your initial hypothesis to develop appropriate treatment plans for the identified antecedent and consequence. # If the data collected from the behavioral interview and the information observed from the direct observation is inconsistent, conduct further assessments such as another interview or continued observation to clear up any of the inconsistencies. # If after review and extra interviews and further observations, the information collected are still inconsistent, it is time to conduct a functional analysis. A functional analysis is also need if the information is consistent but can not lead to a conclusive, firm hypothesis about the predictably of the antecedent and consequence. Functional interventions After a functional behavior assessment has been conducted, the information collected is used to develop treatments and interventions. Interventions are designed to manipulate the antecedent or/and the consequence of the problem behavior to decrease its occurrence rate and increase the rate of occurrence of functional replacement behaviors. Functional interventions include extinction, differential reinforcement and antecedent manipulations. These intervention are functional because they deal with the environmental events that are functional to the problem behavior. They are also non-aversive as punishment is not involved. More aversive interventions can be used as latter resort if previous non- aversive intervention have been tried and shown ineffective. Punishment such as time-out and response cost are considered negative punishment, which although is still controversial, is more widely accepted than positive punishment such as overcorrection, contingent exercise, guided compliance and physical restraint. As mentioned punishment should only be used as a last resort when other methods have already been considered. Research A lot of research being done with functional assessment deals with self injurious behaviors of mentally challenged children or adults and autistic children. Carr, Newsom and Binkoff conducted an experimental method of functional assessment on the two boys with intellectual disabilities exhibiting aggressive behaviors. They hypothesized that their aggressive behaviors were maintained by escape from academic tasks. To test their hypothesis, they set two different experimental conditions; 1. Academic demands were put on the boys, 2. Academic demands were not put on the children. If their hypothesis is true, then the problem behavior should occur much more often in the first condition than the second. Results show that their hypothesis was indeed true as the aggressive behavior occurred at a much higher frequency in the first condition. The researchers concluded that the boy's problem behavior was indeed maintained by the antecedent of academic demands and the consequence of escape from the demands. Another functional assessment research was done by Iwata in 1982 worked with children with developmental disabilities showing self injurious behaviors. The research could not conclude what was maintaining their behavior but believed it either adult attention, escape from demands or sensory stimulation from the injuries. For each of the hypothesis, they created a condition that would fit into the category. For adult attention hypothesis, they created an environment where an adult is in the room with the child but pays no attention to him/her until after the behavior occurs. For the escape from demands hypothesis, they had an adult make a normal demand towards the child, but terminate it if the self injurious behavior occurs. For the sensory stimulation hypothesis, the child is left alone without the presence of anyone or any stimulating activities. Iwata compared the levels of self injurious behaviors across the three conditions and demonstrated that the function of the problem behavior for each child was different. Some wanted attention, others escape while some were maintained by automatic reinforcement. As shown here, it is very important to conduct a functional assessment to determine what exactly is maintaining the behavior before any function interventions are taken.

In 1751, he founded the Rite of Strict Observance. Childhood and youth Karl Gotthelf von Hund came from Silesia, descended from Henry von Hund und Altengrotkau (ca 1480). Henry's son was Commander of the Order of Malta in Glatz, where in 1518 and 1523 he held the Office of the Governor.\\"Landes-Hauptleute der Graffschaft Glatz. (Nach Köglers handschriftlichen Chroniken.)\\" in Vierteljahrsschrift für Geschichte und Heimatkunde der Grafschaft Glatz. 2. Jahrgang 1882-1883, S. 167 Documents from around 1300 show John and Christopher von Hund, but it is not proven that they belong to the line that later became Altengrotkau. Karl Gotthelf's father, Joachim Hildebrand von Hund was chamberlain and Electoral Saxon landowner. The family of von Hund and Altengrotkau owned their estate from 1607 and from 1704 the estate of Upper Kittlitz in Upper Lusatia. Karl's father died very early, so that his still minor son inherited the estate. The guardianship of the son and his mother fell to Caspar Heinrich von Rodewitz. Karl Gotthelf was the youngest of three children, but his elders died before his birth, so that he was entitled to special care and a good teaching. He studied in Leipzig from 1737 to 1739. Then he joined the Army under the command of Colonel Friedrich von Schoenberg. Because of the death of his beloved, the daughter of his guardian, von Hund decided never to marry. Hund became chamberlain to the elector of Cologne. First contacts with Freemasonry In 1741 Hund was at the coronation of Charles VII in Frankfurt, where he was admitted to the Masonic brotherhood. From December 1742 till September 1743 he was in Paris, and there converted to Catholicism under the influence of a noble lady. Here, on 20 February 1743, he became Master of a lodge. On 25 August 1743 he served at the foundation of a lodge as senior warden. Later, he claimed that it was in Paris in 1743 that he was initiated, by Scottish knights, into the Order of the Knights Templar, and was the introduced to the pretender to the British throne, Prince Charles Edward Stuart as the Grand Master of the (supposedly resurrected) Knights Templar. Present were the Earl of Kilmarnock and other senior Jacobites. He was initiated by the \\"Knight of the Red Feather, whose identity he was pledged to conceal, but he may have tried to hint that it was Charles Edward Stuart.R. F. Gould, A Concise History of Freemasonry. Gale & Poulden, London 1904, pp 411-414 There is no documentary proof of any such Masonic lodge. Hund claimed to have been appointed by these \\"unknown superiors\\" of the Templars as \\"commander in chief\\" (Provincial Grand Master) of the Order of Province VII (Germany). Whether he lied or whether he had been deceived for other purposes, is not known. As proof, he presented an encoded \\"military chief patent\\", which remains undeciphered. Hund wrapped himself in silence and in more detailed inquiries repeatedly underlined his discretion with respect to the \\"unknown superiors\\", who had supposedly charged him with the revival of the Templar Order in Germany. Hund's relationship to the alleged French Templar Order is unclear, and his surviving diary entries give little information. Masonic work In 1749 Hund established the Lodge of Three Columns on his estate at Unwürde in association with the brothers of the neighboring Lodge of Three Hammers at Naumburg. After returning to Germany in 1750 Hund settled in Lower Kittlitz. The castle of Kittlitz, built by him, has an octagonal floor plan, which is interpreted as a Masonic symbol. After several failed attempts, the court of the pretender Charles Edward Stuart was contacted, and the establishment of the seventh province of the Templars taken in hand. From 1751 he founded the Rite of Strict Observance within Freemasonry. He always promoted the idea of a line of descent from the Templars to the Freemasons. First he founded in 1751 on his estate, the Strict Observance chapter of \\"The three pillars\\", which initially consisted of only him and his best childhood friend from Schoenberg. In 1755 he created for the community of the Knights Templar a plan of operations for the recruitment of persons of high rank. Its members gave themselves religious-sounding names. Hund had the name Carolus Eques ab Ense (Latin for Charles Knight of the Sword) or Chevalier de l'Épée (same in French). The Rite of Strict Observance The new Scottish Rite that Hund introduced to Germany, he named \\"Rectified Masonry\\" and, after 1764, the Rite of Strict Observance, while referring to the English system of Freemasonry as the Late Observance. In 1764 Hund's estate had been badly affected by the Seven Years' War, and his confidence was damaged by his inability to contact his Jacobite superiors for certification of his position and ritual. He was contacted by George Frederick Johnson, who had been accepted by the lodge at Jena as their masonic mentor, and now claimed superiority over all other lodges in Germany and Bohemia. Those who accepted his rule had their own charters and papers burned, and their leaders re-initiated (at some expense) into Johnson's system of higher degrees. Hoping that Johnson was his desired link to his own missing superiors, Hund agreed to meet, and Johnson brought his entire entourage, with representatives of his subordinate lodges. However, Johnson's bizarre behaviour, and his failure to produce promised material, convinced both Hund and his own people that he was a fraud. He was later found to be a German confidence trickster called Johann Samuel Lechte. When their discredited mentor left, his lodges turned to Hund as the unexpected hero of the hour, who now found himself at the head of a movement.Ladislas de Malczovich, A Sketch of the Earlier History of Masonry in Austria and Hungary, Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, v6, 1893, pp85-91 The Rite appealed to German national pride, attracted the non-nobility, and was allegedly directed by \\"Unknown Superiors\\". The Rite of Strict Observance was particularly devoted to the reform of Masonry, with special reference to the elimination of the occult sciences which at the time were widely practiced in many lodges, and the establishment of cohesion and homogeneity in Masonry through the enforcement of strict discipline, the regulation of functions, etc. Despite its initial popularity, growing dissatisfaction among members over the failure to being initiated into the mysteries of the Unknown Superiors led to the Strict Observance being dissolved in 1782. They decided at a convent in Wilhelmsbad, under Jean- Baptiste Willermoz, that the Freemasons were not descended from the Templars, and reconstituted the order as the Rectified Scottish RiteTrevor W. McKeown, \\"The Rite of Strict Observance\\", Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon A.F. & A. M, 2007. Retrieved on 2008-06-11. Hund's Legacy From today's perspective Hund was not a charlatan, like many of his contemporaries. It is clear that Hund had been enthusiastic and relatively easy to influence. Even as a young man he loved the poets of antiquity and all the ideals of the chivalric spirit. He worshiped chivalric ideals, which in other high-level systems of Freemasonry of the 18th Century were strongly expressed. Hund preached with enthusiasm, all his mature life, the mistaken view that Freemasonry sprang from the alleged remnant of the Templar Order, and strove to resurrect it. Masonic historians considered Hund to be a man of kindness and brotherhood, who sacrificed everything for his ideals. He could have led a life of prosperity, and risen to prominence in court and state. In all this he resigned in favour of religious thought. He suffered pains, hostility and persecution until his death, always in the mistaken view that he had become an emissary of the Knights Templar. Challenged at the 11th Convention of Brunswick (June 1775) about the \\"unknown superiors\\" who allegedly introduced him in Paris to the system of the Strict Observance, Hund is said to have assured his questioners, with tears, that his oath and his conscience forbade reply. For Freemasonry and the system he established, the Strict Observance, he sacrificed a lot of time, money and almost his entire estate. With what sacrifice he persevered in his teaching is shown when, already very ill, in 1776 he traveled to Meiningen to persuade the reigning Duke Friedrich August to adopt the Strict Observance. Shortly after, he died of \\"a fever\\" and was buried in full regalia in the town church of Mellrichstadt (Bavaria). He wore his Army Master ring with the initials N.V.I.O., i.e., \\"nulla vi invertur ordo\\" (\\"No power can overthrow the Order\\"), the motto of the Strict Observance.

Family and education  Alexej Glagolev was born to a family of Alexander Glagolev, the priest and professor of Kiev Theological Academy. His father died in Kiev prison in 1937. His mother, Zinaida Petrovna (née Slesarskaya) was a daughter of the head librarian of Kiev Theological Academy. He had a brother named Sergei and a sister named Varvara. Alexej graduated with distinction from a high school in Kiev. Between 1919 and 1923 he studies at the Kiev Theological Academy. Throughout this period the Academy was shut by Bolsheviks and worked illegally. In 1926 he married Tatiana Pavlovna, née Bulashevich, a daughter of the owner of the sugar plant. They were both members of the Kiev religious community of the priest Anatole Zhurakovsky. Their children: Magdalina (born 1926) and Maria (born 1943).  Life in 1930s  On the 7th of May 1932 Alexej Glagolev was arrested and accused of acting against revolution. In one week's time he was set free but had no vote rights as a son of \\"cult worker\\" (Soviet term for a priest). He worked at the constructions side, security in the nursery at the jam factory. In 1936 he started the degree in Physics and Mathematics in Kiev Pedagogy Institute, graduated in 1940. He continued secretly working in an underground church.  Priest  In 1941, after the Great Patriotic War began, he was made a priest by Archbishop Veniamin (Novitsky) and served in the Pokrov Church in Kiev.Biography, in Russian  Saving Jews during the Nazi occupation  During the Nazi occupation of Ukraine in the Second World War, Glagolev and his family were saving Jews from the Nazis. Glagolevs hid Jews in their own home and homes of their congregants. Alexej also gave Jews fake christening birth certificates left from his father, priest Alexander Glagolev. Once Alexej's wife Tatiana changed the photo in her own passport and gave it to a Jewish woman which was in hiding. Father Alexej wrote about this episode in his memoirs: \\"My wife almost paid with her own life for her reckless action. Gestapo walked flat to flat for requisitions. They asked for her papers and when they found out that she did not have a passport, they were going to arrest her and take to Gestapo. Very few people returned to their homes after such arrests. We begged and just about managed to persuade them to leave her alone, a few witnesses having identified her identity.\\"Glagolev Family details on Yad Vashem's website They also managed to save a family of a Russian Red Army lieutenant colonel – his wife and six kids. Glagolev family took a huge risk, hiding Jews was punished by execution, but they continued doing it despite Tatiana's pregnancy (she gave birth to Maria in 1943). In 1943 Alexej worked in the hospital church in Pokrov Monastery. He stayed in Podil with the people he was hiding despite the demands of German administration to leave this part of Kiev. In autumn of 1943, he was detained by German authorities, twice beaten up and deported to Germany with his son, but they managed to escape. In 1945, he wrote a detailed letter about the Jews he has saved to the First Secretary of the Central Committee of Ukraine Nikita Khrushchev.  After the War  After the war Glagolev carried on working as a priest in the Pokrov church until its closure in 1960. Then he worked in few other churches. Towards the end of his life he was very ill as a result of beatings by Nazis in 1943 and underwent several surgeries. The journalist Sergei Kokurin in his article «Glagolev: the hard truth» characterized Alexej Glagolev as follows:Glagolev: the hard truth, by Sergei Kokurin, in Russian > It is hard to understand to an average man the determination with which > Glagolev went against the tide. <...> In 1936 this fragile-looking > intellectual was publicly carrying the cross taken off a Church of Nikola > the Kind and despite the threats from Komsomol members kept it in his flat. > He was the only priest in Kiev that refused in April 1942 to hold a church > service to celebrate Hitler's birthday. He was not afraid in 1946 to host in > the church the family ordered by Court to leave Kiev within 24 hours, > because NKVD officer occupied their flat.  Memory of Alexej Glagolev  On September 12, 1991, Yad Vashem recognized Aleksej and Tatyana Glagolev, and their daughter, Magdalina (Mariya) Palyan, as Righteous Among the Nations. On October 8, 2000, Yad Vashem recognized Nikolay Glagolev as Righteous Among the Nations. Nikolay who served as a messenger between his parents and the people being saved. On 30 January 2002, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Alexej Glagolev's birth, a memorial plaque to Alexander Glagolev and Alexej Glagolev was erected on the wall of The National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy (Volshskaja Street 8/5, korpus 4).

The medal honours 20 years of exemplary service by peace officers as designated by the Governor General. It is, within the Canadian system of honours, the sixth and newest of the exemplary service medals. Award criteria The award of the Peace Officer Exemplary Service Medal is governed by an Advisory Committee, appointed by the Governor General of Canada, made up from a representative from each organization with personnel eligible for the medal. This committee ensures that personnel nominated for the medal meet all of the criteria for award, as spelled out by regulation, before forwarding the nomination to the Chancellery of Honours. Peace officers are eligible for award of the Exemplary Service Medal if they meet various criteria. First among the criteria is the requirement that the employee of an approved organization was actively serving on or after 22 September 1998, and has completed at least twenty years of service with one or more approved organizations. Eligible periods of service must include protecting the safety and security of Canada, with at least ten years served as a peace officer serving at potential risk as determined by the Advisory Committee. The recognized period of service of a nominee for the medal must be of a character that no serious disciplinary action was taken against a nominee and none may be pending. Nominees are expected to have a record of exemplary service of a high standard warranting recognition. Those personnel who are already recipients of the Peace Officer Exemplary Service Medal, may be awarded a bar to the medal for ten additional years of qualifying service.

However, full-time exemplary service in the Canadian Forces or in any other occupation eligible for award of an Exemplary Service Medal may count as qualifying service, if the service has not been previously recognized. =Extraordinary award criteria= The Advisory Committee may recommend an award of the Peace Officer Exemplary Service Medal to the Governor General under extraordinary circumstances.

Founded with the amalgamation of Ethelbert Road Boys School and Lady Capel School for Girls in 1983, the school consists of 1056 pupils from the ages of 11–19. The school became an Academy in August 2011. History The School was opened in September 1983 with the amalgamation of Ethelbert Road Boys School and Lady Capel School for Girls with the whole process being overseen by its first head, Vin Thomas. The Boys school was decommissioned with students moving to the south side of Faversham where the school currently stands. In 1987, Peter Walker became the school's 2nd headteacher. In February 2000, Walker reported to Ofsted about the deteriorating conditions of the former canteen that was built in the 1940s. The roof had become a thick layer of moss with asbestos that caused paint to peel off the walls. In September 2004, with the support of parents, the school became the first to introduce random drug tests which commenced in January 2005. The tests could be performed only when parents gave permission for their child to be tested. Students who refused to be available for testing or tested positive would undergo a counselling program. Critics of the program stated an infringement of privacy would lead to legal action. At the school, 20 students were tested weekly and were given a mouth swab for cannabis, cocaine and heroin. Supporters of the program including former Prime Minister Tony Blair who endorsed Walker's efforts and called for the program to be expanded. In 2005, the school reported that the scheme helped to boost examination results to 40% compared with 32% in 2004, and 28% in 2003. In 2006, headteacher Peter Walker retired from his position to become Britain's official ambassador for drug testing and gave a presentation to John Walters, the director of the White House drug policy office. His position was taken over by Jenny James who promised to continue drug testing. The scheme was ended in 2008, due to other schools not performing the tests. Within the space of four years, only one student tested positive. James was succeeded by Catrin Woodend after some months and oversaw the school's transition to an academy in 2011. Woodend also organised the building of the school's all-weather pitch which was completed in 2012. In 2018, Catrin Woodend announced her retirement and was succeeded by Dr. Rowland Speller. Governance The Governors are responsible for the school on behalf of the Members of the Academy Trust. The school has 6 Community Governors, 2 Parent Governors and 2 staff Governors. School structure =Lower school= As of 2014, the lower school has an annual intake of 210 students at the beginning of Year Seven (age 11). The lower school (Years 7–11) is 865 students strong, for whom the school uniform for boys consists of a black jacket accompanied with the school badge on the breast pocket, with black trousers and a white shirt.

In 2012, two academy players Tom Axford and Lloyd Harrington, were selected for the England Schoolboy Internationals for the spring and the matches were broadcast live on Sky Sports. Curriculum As of 2010, the school follows the National Curriculum in Years 7–11 and offers a broad range of GCSEs (national exams taken by students aged 14–16) and A-levels (national exams taken by pupils aged 16–18). The school has no affiliation with a particular religious denomination, but religious education is given throughout the school. Students in Key Stage 3 are taught within the national curriculum with timetables arranged to allow students to work at the level of their ability. Students with learning disabilities receive additional support such as teaching in small groups, help from Learning Support Assistants or computer packages which aim to improve literacy and numeracy skills. Students in Key Stage 4 continue to study within the national curriculum but they are able to select a range of additional subjects they wish to study. The school year runs from September to July, split across three terms: the autumn term (September to December), spring term (January to April) and the summer term (April to July). Students receive two weeks off for Christmas and Easter, a six-week summer break, and three \\"half term\\" breaks. =Examination= League tables published by The Daily Telegraph based on 2013 A-level results rank Abbey as the 34th best school in Kent.

The majority of the food is locally sourced from Faversham and surrounding villages. Alongside the restaurant, there is an horticulture area and business units. In 2012, a third generation all-weather football pitch was constructed on the grounds of the school. The pitch had been started by fundraising in 2009 with the final funding coming from the Kent FA with a grant of £390,000 and funds from charities Bensted and Queenborough Fisheries Trust. The construction work was carried out by Charles Lawrence Surfaces in conjunction with Surfacing Standards and Lano Sports, a Football Foundation Framework Partners at a cost of £650,000. The official opening ceremony was held on 19 July 2012 and was attended by Hugh Robertson along with headteacher Catrin Woodend. The 3G pitch surface is estimated to be used for a total of 90 hours with 2,200 players using it weekly. The school created an all-purpose sports hall which would include improvements to the changing rooms and community gymnasium 'The Abbey Sports Centre' with a viewing gallery that would overlook the outdoor pitches. The plans secured backing of Faversham Town Council on 17 December 2012. In 2013, the school was awarded £1.2million for a makeover to provide a new modern look and an energy efficient environment. The Abbey runs a nursery called Twinkle Toes Nursery, which opened in 2009 and operates from a purpose built building on the site. The nursery employs 15 staff with two managers and a cook. The nursery is also subject to Ofsted inspections with the last held on 4 January 2011, stating the nursery is \\"well led and managed\\" with the inspection noting that the environment was \\"thoughtfully set out\\" along with parent relations as \\"very positive\\". The school runs a dining hall and business centre that is located near the Autism Integration Unit and the dining hall is used for wedding receptions, dancing, charity fund-raising events and the annual Year 11 Prom. Usage for the Business room which includes Businesses, Adult Education, use as a conference room, training venue and ICT training. An Outdoor Performance Area (OPA) is maintained with a capacity of 70 people and is used for outdoor performances relating to productions mainly held during the summer. Previous uses of the OPA have included karaoke competitions and events in the style of the musical talent show The X Factor.

His grandfather, Isaac Badcock and his great-uncle, John Badcock had founded \\"Badcock's Bank\\" at Taunton in 1800, which later became known as \\"Stuckey's Bank\\" and then the Westminster Bank.Tyler, Colonel J.C: 'Badcock of Devon and Somerset', Miscellanea Genealogica et Heraldica, December, 1927 He obtained his first commission as ensign on 1 Oct. 1861, was promoted lieutenant on 1 Oct. 1862 and captain on 1 Oct. 1873, brevet-colonel on 2 March 1885, major-general on 1 April 1897, lieutenant-general on 3 April 1900. After a brief period of regimental duty with the 38th foot and then with the 29th Bengal native infantry, he entered in 1864 the commissariat department, in which he remained till 1895, achieving a remarkable success and rising to the highest post of commissary general-in-chief, December 1890. In his three earliest campaigns, Bhutan War (1864-5), the Black Mountain Expedition (1868), and Perak (1875-6) he attracted notice for his foresight and power of organisation, winning the thanks of government. His next service was rendered as principal commissariat officer under Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts in the Kuram field force (1878-9), taking part in the forcing of the Peiwar Kotal and other actions. Returning from furlough when operations were resumed, he joined the Kabul field force, and owing to his admirable preparations Lord Roberts found in Sherpur when it was invested 'supplies for men stored for nearly four months and for animals for six weeks.' Badcock also assisted in recovering the guns abandoned near Bhagwana, and finally when the Kabul-Kandahar field force, consisting of 9986 men and eighteen guns with 8000 followers and 2300 horses and mules, started on 9 Aug. 1880 he relieved Roberts's 'greatest anxiety,' and the force reached Kandahar, 313 miles from Kabul, on 31 August, with a safe margin of supplies. For these services he received the medal and three clasps, the bronze star, brevets of major and lieutenant-colonel, and the C.B.

Generally a PES would include items such as cleanliness, litter, appearance, temperature (heating and air conditioning), graffiti, trash cans, and other quality issues affecting customer perception and quality of the riding experience. There is usually a quality control criteria, and dedicated surveyors are used to gather data that summarize into periodic ratings. In North America, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), Bay Area Rapid Transit District, and Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority are three agencies currently using this type of surveys. However, many other transit agencies have similar surveys or quality assurance processes—but other names might be used to describe them. Introduction Quantitative measurements require clear and well-defined standards. The majority of PES standards were developed from the same quality control criteria used by operating departments to manage their employees. Quality control criteria are found in various agency documents. Some are codified in rules and regulations, union contracts, standard operating procedures, and other official documents; others appear in training materials, field manuals, and management procedures distributed to field staff. Use of actual operating standards is important: it lends PES a degree of official credibility, and improves acceptance by management and the public alike.Ryus, P. TCRP Research Results Digest, Number 56. Summary of TCRP Report 88: A Guidebook for Developing a Transit Performance-Measurement System. Washington D.C. (2003). Use of a different criteria to monitor performance would be unfair to both employees and management. Additionally, use of operating standards ensures by default all field employees would be familiar with PES indicators, and thus clearly understand the yardstick by which their performance is measured. =Data Collection= Because of PES's audit and merit assessment functions, the operator must ensure data collection forces have no vested interest in survey results. Biases associated with using operating staff for data collection have been observed in many organizations. Difference between traffic checker ridership counts, conductor reported passenger counts, and ridership levels implied by fare receipts often differ in commuter railroads and other transit organizations. To provide a neutral data collection workforce, a cadre (group) of specially trained surveyors can be used. Surveyors report directly to a performance measurement unit in central administration, minimizing the influence of operating departments. Surveyors should be hired directly from outside through the usual HR process. Therefore, they start at the operating agency with minimal pre-conceptions about operations. These procedures together ensure that PES truly represents the perspective of customers – seeing the system as they see it. =Important Features= Several features are particularly important in this type of quality control survey: 1\\\\. Quantitative Measurements are Taken Whenever Possible: Surveyors are required to count or measure quantities. Number of doors not operating is counted. Interior temperature is measured with a digital thermometer. Quantitative data enables analysis to be conducted after the fact, and reduce the risk of surveyor errors in judgment. 2\\\\. Auditing Information is Gathered Simultaneously: By collecting information such as car numbers, boarding and alighting stations and times, an analyst can later establish whether the surveyor was actually present at the correct location. The fleet numbers can be cross-checked with block register information independently recorded by operations personnel in signal towers. This is particularly critical when invariably a bad score causes operating departments to challenge the validity of one surveyor's work. If discrepancies are found, results are discarded and surveyor asked to explain how mismatching car numbers appeared in their data. Additionally, spotchecks by surveyor supervision helps to maintain data quality. 3\\\\. Failing Scores are Clearly Documented: Whenever a failing score is recorded, the surveyor records the reason on the form. This demonstrates the surveyor understands PES standards and their correct application. The data is also used to analyze root causes of failing scores. The requirement to record specifics (e.g. color of observed graffiti) allows for post-facto auditing of surveyor activity. Analysts regularly review the forms to gauge surveyors' comprehension level and act proactively to prevent recurring errors, by reinstructing surveyors as necessary. 4\\\\. Qualitative Measures Require Clearly Defined Rating Standards: Occasionally, quantitative measure is difficult or impossible to collect. An ordinal 'rating' standard is then used with clear definitions. Bottles and cans, and food matters trigger an automatic failure rating. =Sampling for PESs= Statistically valid measurements require even and representative samples. Biases due to sampling must be minimized, to ensure validity in PES's audit and merit assessment functions. At the same time, sample size must be minimized for cost reasons. Striking a balance between a statistically valid sample and minimum surveyor cost is not simple. Historical data analyses suggest PES scores are correlated with time-of-day, location, and service route, even though indicators themselves are independent. PES scores are also subject to clustering effects: data collected sequentially on the same day may be adversely affected by common factors such as a school condition, weather conditions, or special events. A pure random sample is an inefficient method of collecting such data, but observations made sequentially cannot be treated as independent observations. Generally, a good statistical sample should fulfill three criteria: 1\\\\. Sample error margins should be appropriate for the intended use of the statistic. 2\\\\. Sample should be representative of the underlying population. 3\\\\. Data collection method should not violate assumptions (e.g. assumption of independent observation) used when designing the sample. A representative sample weighs each sub-class of the population equally. Applying that principle to PES requires analysts to determine a priori what factors might affect PES scores, and stratify the sample based on buckets of these variables. However, PES scores are affected by many factors. With few observations per reporting period and many scheduling constraints, a true stratified sample is not possible. A heuristic (rule-of-thumb) can be used to minimize the impacts of skews introduced by uneven sampling: * Surveys should be evenly distributed throughout the whole reporting period, e.g. nine required Bus Terminal surveys are equally distributed throughout a quarter, with three surveys assigned each month. * Where surveys are conducted at multiple locations, or roving, assigned locations and directions should be evenly distributed. * Surveyors should be scheduled such that they will not repeat any depot, terminal, or route within a quarter. * For surveys with a long allowable timespan (e.g. 0800-2200), samples should be evenly distributed between morning, afternoon, and evening. Application in New York Passenger Environment Survey at the NYCTA was introduced by David L. Gunn, former president of the Authority. PES was introduced in the First Quarter of 1983 and consisted of a handful of very simple indicators designed to quantify how amenable and comfortable the transit environment was to our customers. Although it is difficult to objectively assess the many conditions that relate to passengers’ feelings and perceptions, the early indicators provided a systematic framework to assess performance in these areas independently of anecdotal customer comments. In that sense the early PES was a big step forward and an important recognition that NYCT cares deeply about the environment that is presented everyday to our 7.3 million customers.Kittelson & Associates Inc. TCRP G-6 Interim Report: A Guidebook for Developing a Transit Performance Measurement System. Washington D.C. (2002). The early PES included 11 subway indicators, and 21 bus indicators. Several indicators were added in 1995, expanding the scope of PES. Indicators relating to the station environment such as functioning turnstiles and escalator/elevators were added. A major revision occurred in 2000, when indicators specifically designed to measure the performance of cleaning crews were added. Quarterly reports were scaled back to semi-annual beginning in 2004. NYCT began monitoring the passenger environment aboard express buses in 2007. Additionally, the PES survey methodologies have been used on a variety of \\"pilot\\" policy initiatives designed to measure the impact of allocating additional production resources to cleaning functions. The PES approach has been such a success that NYCT regularly receives requests for details, nationally and internationally, from other transit properties wishing to model quality control programs after NYCT's PES. Initially, PES data was tabulated manually, and reports were issued quarterly with substantial time lag. Although this enabled managers to act after the fact to improve performance, many months may pass before substantial performance improvement is achieved. With the advent of personal computers, NYCT began keeping PES data and reporting results using spreadsheet applications and databases. Internal reports are now issued much more frequently, allowing management to react to mediocre scores mid-quarter. Data mining capabilities allow special requests from top management to be handled quantitatively. Today, NYCT routinely produces internal PES monthly reports as a snapshot to assist operating personnel in taking corrective actions. The PES database is being migrated to Transit's enterprise server. The data collection effort is being transitioned from pen and paper to handheld computers. The PES staff provides regular 'Roadshows' in field locations to improve operations managers’ understanding of PES ratings and how they might improve PES scores, thereby improving the customer experience. These PES Roadshows have become an important mechanism of information exchange, improving relationships between PES and operating staff, and allows PES staff to gain valuable understanding of operations processes. New York City Transit's Passenger Environment Survey (PES) is a quantitative and scientific approach to measuring passenger perception of NYCT's services. The PES standards are consistent, well-defined, and clearly understood by operations personnel. The indicators are measured from a passenger perspective by a group of dedicated and impartial surveyors, and subject to rigorous data quality control by trained statistical analysts. Internally, PES functions as a performance audit for field operations management. Externally, PES serves as a dispassionate and analytical 'scorecard' measure of passenger experience. First designed in 1983, PES has evolved over time to include 68 indicators in four distinct categories measured in four different passenger environments. Nine survey forms and 25 surveyors produce semi-annual reports with statistical precision exceeding 95% ± 5%. NYCT has such confidence in these measures that PES results are considered in the promotion and merit decision-making process. The rich and extensive dataset generated by these periodic sample measurements are used throughout NYCT to support quantitative management decision making.

In 1920 he was Minister of Finance for the short-lived Arab Kingdom of Syria in Damascus. He subsequently became the finance minister in Transjordan. In Mandatory Palestine In 1925, he became the Director General of Awqaf in Mandatory Palestine, the organisation headed by Haj Amin Husseini, which controlled and regulated properties bequeathed to charities under Islamic Law. He later began his banking career when he joined the Arab Bank, which had been established in Jerusalem by Abdul Hamid Shoman in 1930. A few years later Ahmed Hilmi founded his own bank, the Arab National Bank. He was one of the early members of the Istiqlal (Independence) Party which was set up in 1932 and in April 1936 he was named as a member of the Arab Higher Committee becoming its treasurer.Smith. pp.79,80,131,221,222,236.Cohen. p.309. In 1937 he, along with other members of the Higher Committee not already in exile, was deported to the Seychelles Islands. In 1939 he was allowed to attend the London Conference at St. James Palace, where he urged the Higher Committee to accept the British proposals later set out in the 1939 White paper. Regarded by the authorities as a moderate, he was allowed back to Palestine in the early 1940s and resumed his post as chairman of the National Bank. He purchased the newspaper Filistin and used it to present Istiqlal policies to the public. The war years were very profitable for the Palestinian economy and the bank had large deposits to invest. In August 1943 he set up the Arab National Fund the purpose of which was to buy land from farmers who were heavily in dept and to encourage the establishment of Awqaf whose proceeds would be allocated to the Fund. By the middle of 1946 the Fund had an income of £P150,000 and owned 15,000 dunams (3,750 acres) of land. It had offices in all the Arab towns and in most of the large villages. Since the Supreme Muslim Council had been abolished the Fund was the only institution offering an alternative to land purchases by the Jewish National Fund. Its success was seen as a threat by followers of the Haj Amin Husseini, who had formed the Palestine Arab Party with most of its leaders in exile. With the end of the war the fund went into decline.Cohen. p.309; Smith. p.80. Declaration of establishment of Palestinian Government. El-Falah school, Gaza City. 22 September 1948. As the situation in Palestine deteriorated, the Arab League tried to impose a united front on the various Palestinian Arab factions. Eventually in January 1947, after four attempts, a five-member Arab Higher Committee was set up, which included Hilmi.Cohen. pp. 333,334. Husayin al- Khalidi and Hilmi were the only members of this Committee actually resident in Palestine during 1947 and 1948.Pappe, Ilan (1994) The making of the Arab- Israeli conflict. 1947-1951. I.B.Tauris. . p.66 Prime Minister of All- Palestine Government On 9 July 1948, following the declaration of Israeli statehood, the Arab League set up the Administrative Council for Palestine, chaired by Hilmi. On 22 September the National Assembly was set up in Gaza, with Haj Amin Husseini as President and Hilmi as Prime Minister. The assembly ceased to function following the Israeli army victories in Southern Palestine and the Arab Legion assuming control over Bethlehem and Hebron. In 1949 Hilmi became a district military governor in the West Bank and later he served as the Palestinian representative to the Arab League.Smith pp.86,87,90,98,190,234.

In 1995 Koehler develop this in The Three Meanings of Global Apartheid: Empirical, Normative, Existential.Alternatives: Global, Local, Political, Vol. 20, No. 3 (July-September 1995), pp. 403-413 Its best known use was by Thabo Mbeki, then-President of South Africa, in a 2002 speech, drawing comparisons of the status of the world's people, economy, and access to natural resources to the apartheid era.Haviland, William (1993). Cultural Anthropology. Vermont: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich College Publishers. p. 250-252 Mbeki got the term from Titus Alexander, initiator of Charter 99, a campaign for global democracy, who was also present at the UN Millennium Summit and gave him a copy of Unravelling Global Apartheid.  Concept  Minority rule in global governance is based on national sovereignty rather than racial identity, but in many other respects the history and structures of apartheid South Africa can be seen as a microcosm of the world. Following the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Second World War, the United States and United Kingdom used their political power to create systems of economic management and protection to mitigate the worst effects of free trade and neutralise the competing appeals of communism and national socialism. In South Africa civilized labour policies restricted public employment to whites, reserved skilled jobs for whites and controlled the movement of non-whites through a system of pass laws. In the West, escalating tariff barriers reserved manufacturing work for Europeans and Americans while immigration laws controlled the movement of immigrants seeking work. Alexander argued that apartheid was a system of one-sided protectionism, in which the rich white minority used their political power to exclude the black majority from competing on equal terms, and warned that \\"the intensification of economic competition as a result of greater free trade is increasing political pressures for one-sided protectionism.\\" At a political level, the West still dominates global decision-making through minority control of the central banking system (Bank of International Settlements), IMF, World Bank, Security Council and other institutions of global governance. The G8 (now G7) represent less than 15% of world population, yet have over 60% of its income. 80% of the permanent members of the UN Security Council represent white Western states, 60% from Europe. The West has veto power in the World Bank, IMF and WTO and regulates global monetary policy through the Bank of International Settlements (BIS). By tradition, the head of the World Bank is always a US citizen, nominated by the US President, and the IMF is a European. Although the rest of the world now has a majority in many international institutions, it does not have the political power to reject decisions by the Western minority. In The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, Samuel P. Huntington describes how \\"the United States together with Britain and France make the crucial decisions on political and security issues; the United States together with Germany and Japan make the crucial decisions on economic issues.\\"Samuel P Huntington The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, (p81) Huntington quoted Jeffrey R Bennett to claim that Western nations:Jeffrey R Bennett ‘Exclusion as National Security Policy’, Parameters, 24, Spring 1994, 54 * own and operate the international banking system * control all hard currencies * are the world’s principal customers * provide the majority of the world’s finished goods * dominate international capital markets * exert considerable moral leadership within many societies * are capable of massive military intervention * control the sea lanes Huntington presents a ‘framework, a paradigm, for viewing global politics’ to protect “Western civilization”. He argues that other civilizations threaten the West through immigration, cultural differences, growing economic strength and potential military power. ‘If North America and Europe renew their moral life, build on their cultural commonality, and develop close forms of economic and political integration to supplement their security collaboration in NATO, they could generate a third Euroamerican phase of Western affluence and political influence. Meaningful political integration would in some measure counter the relative decline in the West’s share of the world’s people, economic product, and military capabilities and revive the power of the West in the eyes of the leaders of other civilizations.’ However, this ‘depends overwhelmingly on whether the United States reaffirms its identity as a Western nation and defines its global role as the leader of Western civilization.’ [p308] Alexander identifies numerous pillars of global apartheid including: *veto power by the Western minority in the UN Security Council *voting powers in the IMF and World Bank *dominance of the World Trade Organization through effective veto power and ‘weight of trade’ rather than formal voting power *one-sided rules of trade, which give privileged protection to Western agriculture and other interests while opening markets in the Majority World *protection of ‘hard currency’ through the central banking system through the Bank of International Settlements *immigration controls which manage the flow of labour to meet the needs of Western economies *use of aid and investment to control elites in the Majority World through reward and punishment *support for coups or military intervention in countries which defy Western dominance More recently, scholars such as Thanh-Dam Truong and Des Gasper, inTransnational Migration and Human Security and Kyle and Koslowsk in In Global Human Smuggling, analyse the rise of migrant smuggling and human trafficking in terms of the \\"structural violence generated by the escalation of border interdiction by states as part of the system of global apartheid.\\" Political demands for protectionism and physical barriers between the West and the Majority World, such as President Trump’s wall between Mexico and the US as well as barriers round the EU follow similar economic pressures to those which entrenched apartheid in South Africa.

Plot Lois Conway (Williams) works as a music teacher at a local high school in a small town, where recently a woman was found murdered. When she starts receiving notes from an anonymous admirer, she suspects her favorite student Sandy (Wilder) is responsible, and tells him they could never be lovers. The notes grow more violent and when, in her latest letter, she is invited to meet at the school's lockers at night, Lois decides to visit, hoping to stop the young man. There, she is attacked by an initial shadowy figure, whom she later identifies as Leonard Bennett (Saxon), the high school's star football player. She successfully gets away, though drops her purse, and is aided by Lieutenant Harry Graham (Nader). Graham advises her to press charges, but Lois wants to drop the matter in hopes of it blowing over. Back at home, she notices her purse on her table, and aware that the thief is in her home, orders him to leave. As he bashes through the door to get away, Lois is now certain that Leonard is her attacker. Leonard is able to get home without his dominant and overbearing father (Andrews) noticing he is gone. Mr. Bennett lectures his son on the dangers of women, stimulated by the occurrence of him being left by his wife and Leonard's mother when he was very ill. The following day, Lois reports the incident to the principal Pendleton (Tremayne), but when Leonard denies the whole matter, Pendleton protects the school's most valuable athletic asset by suggesting to Lois that she should provide evidence. Soon the story spreads around school, and with gossip surrounding Lois allegedly pursuing Leonard, both her personal and professional life becomes a mess. One day, she pulls him out of class and tries to reason with him, but he refuses to listen to her. Meanwhile, she grows closer to Graham, who does not understand why she is sympathetic to Leonard. Nonetheless, she decides to visit the Bennetts, but the father does not want her to interfere with his son and accuses her of seducing Leonard. He is startled, though, upon finding out the police are now involved in the matter. Mr. Bennett is unaware that Leonard again sneaked out of his room to visit a waitress whom he has dated in the past. Sometime later, Graham accompanies Lois to a football game, where Graham is inspired to retrieve Leonard's fingerprints from his locker. It turns out the fingerprints match those found at Lois' place. At a school dance, she tries to warn Leonard about the police discovery, assuring him he will get into big trouble if he does not come clean. Leonard, for the first time, speaks truthfully to her, but they are interrupted by Mr. Bennett, who convinces Leonard Lois is manipulating him. Leonard asks her to meet him in the cloak room to discuss the matter, but Lois is unaware Mr. Bennett and Pendleton are hiding in the same room. Her presence convinces them she must be having an affair with the teenager. Lois, being tricked by Leonard, falls into Graham's arms, and finally allows him to arrest the kid. At the police station, the now suspended Lois is brought in by Graham to get an honest confession from Leonard. During the interrogation, the couple is informed that another man has admitted to having committed the murder. Graham wants to continue prosecuting Leonard for breaking into Lois' apartment, but she wants to drop the case and orders him to bring the boy home. Back home, Lois is about to undress, when suddenly Mr. Bennett jumps out of her closet and starts assaulting her. At the same moment, Leonard, impressed by having been forgiven by his teacher, confesses to Graham that his father is responsible for the murders. Graham decides to share the news with Lois and arrives at her home just in time to save her from being murdered by Mr. Bennett. Bennett suffers a heart attack after attempting to flee the scene, and dies in front of Leonard. Cast * Esther Williams as Lois Conway * George Nader as Lt.

Williams) Production =Development= The origin of The Unguarded Moment is as surprising as Esther Williams' casting in it. According to biographer Bernard F. Dick in Forever Mame: The Life of Rosalind Russell, the story idea came from writer Larry Marcus and Rosalind Russell, as a possible vehicle for herself. (Marcus had written scripts for Russell's own production company.) The first draft of the screenplay by Marcus and Russell (under the pseudonym C.A. McKnight, her mother's maiden name) had a working title of Teach Me to Love and was completed by 1951. In a 1951 draft of the story, Harry Graham was a fellow teacher instead of a policeman, and Leonard Bennett was revealed to be responsible for the murders, before being killed.Forever Mama: The Life of Rosalind Russell by Bernard F. Dick. p. 141. In 1952 it was announced the story, called The Hidden Heart had been purchased by Benagoss Productions, who had made The Green Glove. Herbert Meadow had worked on the script and Rudolph Mate was to direct. The story had been originally set in France but was relocated to California. Possible female stars discussed in the press included Olivia de Havilland, Loretta Young and Teresa Wright. The movie was not made. Russell had no time to work on the screenplay as she became busy with back to back Broadway productions including Wonderful Town, The Girl Rush and Picnic. As a result, she didn't return to the project until 1955 when Marcus and scenarist Herb Meadow had made further revisions to the script under working titles of The Lie and The Hidden Heart. In October 1955 it was announced Universal International had purchased the script and Gordon Kay was going to produce. (It was later estimated Russell and Marcus made $50,000 for their work on the film.) In November Esther Williams signed on to play the lead and the film was called The Gentle Webb. =Casting= Actor John Saxon had yet to make a name for himself when the film went into production. He received the co-starring role after several screen tests, and the studio attempted to make him fill the void actor James Dean left when he died. For Esther Williams, the film was her first since her contract ended with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and it proved to be her first non-swimming dramatic role since The Hoodlum Saint (1946). In her autobiography, she noted: > I thought it was a curious choice for Universal to offer me the lead in a > 'dry' psychological thriller, and I wasn't sure the public would accept me > without my glittering crowns and sparkly swimsuits. Nonetheless, Universal > offered me $200,000, which was more than I ever made for a single film at > MGM in or out of the water...Later, after we had started shooting, Rosalind > Russell came up to me at a party and said, 'I hear you're doing my script.' > I looked at her blankly until she explained that she had written it under > the pseudonym C. A. McKnight. 'I wrote the part for me, but I got too old.'\\" Reception The film flopped at the box office. Saxon received warm reviews for his performance of Leonard Bennett. Some reviewers lauded Williams' performance, others lamented her change of milieu. Russell later wrote that Williams was \\"very good in\\" the film. The Chicago Tribune wrote that \\"the film is a pleasant surprise... the well knit story has suspense and the dialogue is excellent.\\" The Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"it carries enough suspense to please any but rabid devotees\\". In present days, the film is regarded as a B film, despite the fact it was heavily promoted in the 1950s. According to Turner Classic Movies, Williams \\"unintentionally accents [her] limitations as a dramatic actress though she still looks gorgeous. [..] While Esther Williams is the top-billed star of The Unguarded Moment, it is Andrews' unexpectedly creepy performance that hijacks the film and imbues it with an underlying mood of malice and menace.\\" Filmink called it \\"’a decent woman-has-a-stalker thriller, surprisingly harsh on the misogyny of men in 1950s America (Russell’s influence?).\\" See also *List of American films of 1956 References External links  The Unguarded Moment review at Film Noir of the Week by Wheeler Winston Dixon * 1956 films 1956 drama films 1950s thriller drama films American films American thriller drama films American high school films English-language films Films about educators Films directed by Victor Saville Films directed by Harry Keller Films scored by Herman Stein Universal Pictures films ","title":"The Unguarded Moment (film)"},{"id":"36579507","text":"Aboagye is a surname.

The book was published in 1846, and is based on his travels during the second voyage of HMS Beagle, commanded by captain Robert FitzRoy. HMS Beagle arrived in South America to map out the coastlines and islands of the region for the British Navy. On the journey, Darwin collected fossils and plants, and recorded the continent's geological features. It is the third book in a series of geology books written by Darwin, which also includes The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs, published in 1842, and Geological Observations on the Volcanic Islands visited during the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, published in 1844. It took Darwin four years to write and complete the entire series, from 1842 to 1846. According to his diaries, Geological Observations of South America was written between July 1844 to April 1845. The text contains eight chapters along with appendices on Darwin's Mesozoic and Tertiary fossils. It describes his travels through the regions of modern Chile, Brazil, and Argentina, including the Pampas, Patagonia, and the Andes. With this book Darwin became the first to describe and name Navidad Formation, the reference unit for the marine Neogene in Chile. Darwin established relatives ages for rock units in the high Andes near Portillo. Metamorphic rocks were older than intruding red granites found in the area. By establishing, with aid of fossils, a Cretaceous age for some strata in the high Andes Darwin set time constrains for uplift of the Andes. He did further posited that the western part of the Andes (hinterland) rose before the eastern part, an idea later verified to be correct not only for the part of the Andes he visited but for orogenic mountains in general. Darwin, in a letter to the geologist Charles Lyell, wrote that the book was \\"dreadfully dull, yet much condensed.\\" He put a great deal of effort into writing the book, but sardonically commented that \\"geologists never read each other's works, and that the only object in writing a book is a proof of earnestness, and that you do not form your opinions without undergoing labour of some kind.\\" In the book, Darwin voiced sceptical support for the \\"crater of elevation\\" theory. The theory proposed that volcanoes were not the product of lavas, but are pushed up from within. Darwin later rejected the theory when sufficient evidence was demonstrated by the geologist Charles Lyell to disprove it. Geological Observations on South America is based on Darwin's travels during the second voyage of HMS Beagle. Francis Darwin, a botanist and the son of Charles Darwin, wrote that the book was significant for the \\"evidence which it brought forward to prove the slow interrupted elevation of the South American continent during a recent geological period.\\" Darwin's geological work is not considered as notable as his work is biology, but nevertheless was important in advancing \\"the general reception of Lyell's teaching.\\" References External links * Geological Observations on South America.

The condition is rare in adults; however, children diagnosed with abdominal migraines may have migraine headaches as adults. Signs and Symptoms As with other types of migraines, there is no diagnostic test to identify abdominal migraines. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, a family history of migraines, and eliminations of other possible causes. Common migraine triggers may also trigger abdominal migraines. Symptoms may include: * Abdominal pain * Nausea * Vomiting * Headaches * Light sensitivity Diagnosis The diagnosis of abdominal migraines was once considered controversial but is now accepted as a common cause of chronic abdominal pain in children. Diagnostic criteria from the International Classification of Headache Disorders are: > :A. At least 5 attacks fulfilling criteria B-D. :B.

The Portland is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and presently hosts the Oregon Maritime Museum which owns the vessel. The vessel is moored at the Willamette River seawall next to Tom McCall Waterfront Park in downtown Portland. History Portland was built in 1947 and delivered to the Port of Portland on August 29 of that year. She was operated as a tug by both Willamette Tug & Barge and Shaver Transportation until she was retired in 1981. By that time, the Port of Portland was serving oil supertankers from Alaska that were too large for Portland to assist, and container ships with bow thrusting capabilities that reduced the need for tug assistance. Built at a time when steam paddlewheels were giving way to more modern propulsion systems, Portland was originally proposed as a diesel-powered screw-driven vessel, but at the request of the Columbia River Pilots Association she was built with more traditional propulsion. As a result, she was the last steam-powered, sternwheel tugboat built in the United States. She was also the last such vessel still in service in the U.S. at the time of her retirement in 1981. For these reasons, she is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as \\"an outstanding representative of her type and method of construction.\\" Portland was built to replace her predecessor of the same name, built in 1919. Unlike her predecessor, the present Portland is built with a steel hull, and a wooden superstructure. Oregon Maritime Museum Stern of Portland with boarding gangplank for museum visitors In 1991, nearly ten years after Portland was retired, ownership was transferred to the Oregon Maritime Museum for $1, where restoration work began with the intent of turning her into a stationary museum ship. Interest and fundraising for the project exceeded expectations, and $700,000 in donations allowed Portland to be restored to a functioning, seaworthy condition. Restoration work was completed in 1993, with occasional passenger trips until the Coast Guard inspected the vessel in 2001 and shut passenger operations down until the ship could pass inspection. The museum raised an addition $480,000 in funds, volunteers put an additional million dollars in labor over seven years, and the ship was cleared for passenger service in 2008. In 1994, Portland was moved to her present location, at Tom McCall Waterfront Park in downtown Portland, where she is available most days for tours. In 2002, the static displays for the Oregon Maritime Museumcalled the Oregon Maritime Center and Museum until 2004were brought on board and are now a part of the tour. Notable events = 1952 Steamboat Race = On January 24, 1952, the Portland raced against the older sternwheel tug Henderson in a staged race on the Columbia River in order to promote the upcoming Jimmy Stewart film Bend of the River (with the stars riding on Henderson). Henderson won by a length and a half. =1952 freeing S.G. Follis= The heavy-laden , inbound to Portland, ran firm aground at the Sauvie Island dike. Other tugs tried to free her to no avail. With lines fast to S.G. Follis, the wash from Portlands paddle wheel in full reverse began to loosen the sand under S.G. Follis, allowing Portland to work her free. =1957 Portland saves the Hawthorne Bridge= On April 14, 1957, two ships set to be scrapped broke from their moorings and collided with the Hawthorne Bridge. Two of the most powerful diesel tugs available were unable to do much more than relieve some of the strain from the bridge. Portland was able to free the ships and tow them to moorings before the strain broke the bridge. The Columbia River Pilots Association saw this incident as justification for having insisted that Portland be a steam-powered sternwheeler. =2008 grounding= In 2008, Portland was set to participate in the first steamboat race on the Columbia River in more than half a century, recreating the 1952 race. She was set to race against the sternwheeler , as a part of the Sternwheeler Days Festival in Cascade Locks, Oregon. Portlands steering locked, and she ran into the bank, damaging her wheel. Without power or steering, she drifted towards the Bonneville Dam until another tug secured a line and towed her to safety. A Coast Guard investigation cited a problem with an improperly repaired gear in the steering system dating back to 1997. Portland and Columbia Gorge have since raced at least three times, with the Portland winning two of the races. =2012 collision= As the Portland was docking for the Heritage Maritime Festival in St. Helens, she backed into the Portland Pirate Festival's tall ship . While no one was injured, significant damage was done to Royaliste. As of July 2012, an investigation was ongoing.

The white, wooden, neo-gothic church was built in a cruciform style in 1901 by the architects Carl Julius Bergstrøm and Karl Norum. The church seats about 696 people. History The earliest existing historical records of this church date back to 1381, but the church was not new at that time. There have been several churches in Sortland over the centuries. The first churches in Sortland were located about southeast of the present-day church, closer to the fjord. Not much is known about the medieval churches in Sortland, but records show a new church was built in 1676. It was a log building in a cruciform design. In 1803, the church was heavily renovated. By the early 1900s, the church was in poor condition. A new church site was chosen, about northwest of the church. The new church was completed in 1902 and it seats nearly 700 people. After the new church was completed, the old church was torn down. The site of the old church was marked with a small building with the old church steeple and church bell on top and the area was made into a park.

In 1525, Charles I of Spain named him maestrescula of the cathedral chapter of Salamanca Cathedral, a post that also made him chancellor of the University of Salamanca. The cathedral chapter, however, elected Martín de Espinosa, an auditor of the Roman Rota, for the same position. Espinosa ultimately prevailed in the dispute over this double appointment. In compensation, Charles I of Spain in 1530 made him major chaplain of the Chapel of the New Monarchs in the Cathedral of Toledo. Six months later, Charles nominated him to be Bishop of Canarias and he was elected as bishop on 22 June 1530. He was transferred to the see of Ciudad Rodrigo on 14 December 1530.

Support for the campaign came from a number of high-ranking officials and governments, including the United States Congress, U.S. President Barack Obama, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, U.S. Republican Party presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the Italian Parliament, the Australian Parliament, the Canadian Parliament, the German Parliament, and German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle. The IOC declined the request for a minute of silence at the opening ceremony, but IOC officials honoured the victims at a ceremony organised by the Israeli embassy and the Jewish community in London during the Olympics on August 6, 2012. A further ceremony was planned in Germany on the anniversary of the attack on September 5, 2012 at the military airfield of Fürstenfeldbruck. IOC President Rogge led a spontaneous minute of silence during a ceremony on July 23, 2012 which promoted the Olympic truce, marking the first time ever that the IOC honored the Israeli victims in a ceremony inside an Olympic village. Background The Munich massacre occurred during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, in southern West Germany, when members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage and eventually murdered by the Palestinian group Black September. The kidnappers killed eleven Israeli athletes and coaches, as well as a West German police officer. Following the attack, a memorial service was held in the Olympic Stadium, although the International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Avery Brundage did not refer to the athletes during his speech. Since the memorial, the IOC has repeatedly rejected calls to commemorate the victims during the Olympics or hold an official memorial service. Initial attempts The families of the murdered athletes have attempted since the massacre to receive official remembrance for those killed in the massacre, starting with the Montreal Olympics in 1976. Ankie Spitzer, the widow of Israeli coach Andrei Spitzer, has helped lead the campaign, and has described the idea of a minute of silence or other form of commemoration as \\"natural in our [the families'] eyes.\\" However, Spitzer said, > But they told us very clearly: \\"There are 21 Arab delegations that will > leave if we say something about the Israeli athletes.\\" So I said: \\"Let them > leave if they can't understand what the Olympics are all about – a > connection between people through sport.\\" Since the Montreal Olympics, the IOC has continued to reject any official commemoration of the victims. Spitzer explained that the International Olympics Committee says it is not in the \\"protocol of the opening ceremony to have a commemoration.\\" However, Spitzer said, \\"Well, my husband coming home in a coffin was not in the protocol either. This was the blackest page in Olympic history. These 11 athletes were part of the Olympic family, they were not accidental tourists. They should be remembered as part of the Olympic framework.\\" Campaign In April 2012, the year of the 40th anniversary of the Munich massacre, an online petition was created titled \\"Tell the International Olympic Committee: 40 Years is Enough!\\", to urge the International Olympic Committee to honour the memory of the eleven murdered athletes in one minute of silence. The Jewish Community Center of Rockland County, New York, initiated the petition with Ankie Spitzer, the wife of Andrei Spitzer, who was killed at the Munich Olympics. The petition says, \\"Just one minute — at the 2012 London Summer Olympics and at every Olympic Game, to promote peace.\\" When the London Olympics took place in July, over 100,000 people had signed the petition in support of one minute of silence. Later during the same month, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon wrote an official letter to the International Olympic Committee, in which he requested the commemoration of the eleven murdered athletes in a minute of silence, as well as an emphasis on the Olympic principles of equality and brotherhood. Ayalon said, \\"We must remain vigilant against acts of hate and intolerance that stand in contrast to the ideals of the international Olympics.\\" Support Support for the one minute of silence campaign for the London 2012 Olympics emerged from across the globe. Calls for a minute of silence also came from various parliaments and government officials. In addition, over 100,000 people signed a petition in support of one minute of silence. =Australia= Prime Minister Julia Gillard, Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan, Foreign Minister Bob Carr, opposition leader Tony Abbott, New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell, Victorian Premier Ted Baillieu, and federal lawmakers Michael Danby and Josh Frydenberg signed a letter urging the International Olympics Committee to hold one minute of silence. The letter said, \\"Silence is a fitting tribute for the athletes who lost their lives on the Olympic stage. Silence contains no statements, assumptions or beliefs and requires no understanding of language to interpret.\\" Australian lawmakers unanimously supported a motion that supported a minute of silence during the opening ceremony of the London Olympics. Prime Minister Julia Gillard and opposition leader Tony Abbot voted for the motion as well. The motion said that the impact of 1972 Munich Massacre \\"has been seared on world consciousness\\" and urged the International Olympic Committee to commemorate the 40th anniversary. =Canada= The House of Commons unanimously adopted a motion by Liberal Member of Parliament Irwin Cotler to support the campaign for a special tribute for the victims of the Munich Massacre. Minister of State for Sport Bal Gosal and Minister of Foreign Affairs John Baird urged IOC President Jacques Rogge to reconsider his position against commemorating the victims. They wrote, \\"The terrorist attack targeted not only Israel, but the spirit and goals of the Olympic movement. Given the impact of this tragedy, on the Olympic community as a whole and the world, it should be marked publicly as part of the official ceremony of the games, not just by the Israeli delegation.\\" =Germany= Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle supported a minute of silence at the London Olympics in a letter to Jacques Rogge, the president of the International Olympics Committee. Westerwelle wrote that the Munich Massacre was \\"also an attack on the Olympic Games and the Olympic idea of promoting peace and friendship among the nations.\\" Westerwelle recognized that the focus of the Olympics must be the sports competition, but also appealed to Rogge for \\"a moment's pause at an appropriate time\\" during the Olympics, which would be \\"a humanitarian gesture and a fitting way to send the message that violence and terror are incompatible with the Olympic idea.\\" Westerwelle added that Germany \\"looks back with grief and anguish on the tragedy of Munich\\" and their thoughts are with the victims, their families, and the Israeli team members who survived. Parliament President Norbert Lammert pledged his support for one minute of silence in an official letter to Israel's Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin. Rivlin said, \\"That Germany, on whose territory the terrorist attacks were carried out, joined the cause is extremely significant.\\" \\"The case for a minute of silence to mark the 40th anniversary of the massacre is a moral cause of the first order.\\" =United Kingdom= The London Assembly unanimously agreed on a motion that called on Mayor Boris Johnson to ensure that the victims of the 1972 Munich Massacre are remembered during the 2012 Games with a minute of silence in the Olympic Park during the opening or closing ceremonies. The motion said: > This Assembly notes the widespread, cross-party, support for one minute's > silence during the London Olympic Games to mark the 10th Olympiad since and > 40th anniversary of the terrorist massacre of Israeli competitors and their > coaches during the 1972 Munich Olympics. This Assembly urges the Mayor of > London to use his position and influence to ensure an official minute's > silence remembrance is observed in the Olympic Park during the Opening or > Closing Ceremonies of the London Olympic Games. Andrew Dismore AM proposed the motion and said, \\"It is 40 years since this terrible attack took place and there has not once been a memorial service or event officially part of the scheduled events at Olympic Games. This is simply not good enough. The IOC say to have a minute's silence to commemorate these victims of terrorism would be a 'political gesture' but surely not having a minute's silence is, in itself, the political gesture. This is not about the nationality of the victims – they were Olympians.\\" Roger Evans AM seconded the motion and said, \\"The IOC needs to show some political courage and allow the commemoration of a tragedy that affected their guests during their event in their venue forty years ago. This important decision should not be dictated by a small number of their members.\\" =Italy= Approximately 140 members of Italy's parliament urged the International Olympic Committee to observe one minute of silence on the 40th anniversary of the Munich Massacre in a letter they wrote to the IOC. =United States= The United States Senate unanimously passed a resolution which urged the International Olympic Committee to hold one minute of silence. The United States House of Representatives unanimously passed a similar bill brought by the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, but the full body did not receive a chance to vote on it. The House of Representatives held a moment of silence themselves, and one-minute speeches were given on the House floor as well. Representative Eliot Engel, who cosponsored the resolution in support of a minute of silence, blamed the IOC's refusal on \\"being political because frankly they’re afraid of offending some of the Arab nations.\\" However, Engel said, \\"If you have this fiction of fraternal bonds and commonality of feeling, then it's appropriate for the IOC to act without any politics whatsoever. The only reason they haven’t done this in 40 years is because it's Israeli athletes, and that makes it even more disgraceful.\\" President Barack Obama said that he \\"absolutely\\" supports a minute of silence. National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said \\"We absolutely support the campaign for a minute of silence at the Olympics to honor the Israeli athletes killed in Munich.\\" United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wrote to the International Olympics Committee President Jacques Rogge to urge the IOC to hold an \\"appropriate memorial event\\" in London for the victims of the Munich massacre, and urged the IOC to reverse their decision against holding a minute of silence. Republican presidential candidate, Governor Mitt Romney, supported one minute of silence. Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mitt Romney, said, \\"Governor Romney supports the moment of silence in remembrance of the Israeli athletes killed in the Munich Olympic Games.\\" International Olympic Committee response The International Olympic Committee refused to hold one minute of silence at the 40th anniversary of the Munich massacre. IOC President Jacques Rogge said that, \\"We feel that the opening ceremony is an atmosphere that is not fit to remember such a tragic incident.\\" However, Rogge said that the IOC would honour the victims of the Munich massacre at a reception in London during the Olympics on August 6, and that IOC officials would attend a ceremony in Germany on the anniversary of the attack on September 5 at the military airfield of Fürstenfeldbruck, where most of the Israelis died during a botched rescue attempt. Rogge also said that he has attended several ceremonies with the Israeli Olympic Committee and Israeli athletes during recent games. Despite the refusal to honour the victims during the opening ceremony of the Olympics, on July 23 IOC President Jacques Rogge led a minute of silence during a ceremony which promoted the Olympic truce. This was the first time that the IOC honoured the Israeli victims in a ceremony inside an Olympic village. Rogge started by \\"honoring the memory of the 11 Israeli Olympians who shared the ideals that have brought us together in this beautiful Olympic village\\" and said that the Israelis \\"came to Munich in the spirit of peace and solidarity.\\" Rogge added, \\"we owe it to them to keep that spirit alive and to remember them.\\" In response to Rogge's spontaneous minute of silence, Ilana Romano, the widow of Israeli weightlifter Yossef Romano, said, \\"He is trying to do the bare minimum,\\" and called it \\"shameful.\\" Ankie Spitzer, the widow of Israeli coach Andrei Spitzer, also criticized Rogge, saying, \\"This is not the right solution, to hold some ceremony in front of 30 or 40 people. We asked for a moment of silence at the opening ceremony, not for someone to mumble something in front of a few dozen people.\\" At the London commemoration on August 6, Romano told Rogge he had \\"submitted to terrorism\\", and would be \\"written down on the pages of history as ... a president who violated the Olympic charter calls for brotherhood, friendship and peace.\\" Their attacks were applauded by the audience, but afterwards some attendees privately expressed discomfort at the sustained attack on Rogge, and Andrew Gilbert, formerly chair of Limmud International tweeted that \\"the memorial service for Munich 11 became an anti-IOC rally and heavy-handed humiliation of Rogge\\".'Miriam Shaviv, \\"IOC’s Rogge hears sharp criticism at London memorial for Munich 11\\", at The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, August 7, 2012. =Reactions to IOC response= Jibril Rajoub, the president of the Palestine Olympic Committee, thanked Jacques Rogge in a letter for refusing to hold a minute of silence, saying that it promotes the \\"spread of racism\\" and that the Palestinian Olympic team was prepared to \\"confront the Israeli provocations,\\" referring to a minute of silence. Rajoub added that \\"sport in Palestine is a means to achieve national goals\\" as well as \\"a tool of struggle to present the Palestinian cause,\\" and that \\"sports are a bridge to love, interconnection, and spreading of peace among nations.\\" Al- Hayat al-Jadida, the official daily newspaper of the Palestinian National Authority referred to the Munich massacre as \\"the Munich Operation.\\"The Olympics and the Peace Process Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon denounced the use of the term \\"racist\\" by Rajoub, and insisted that the murder of the Israeli Olympians due to their nationality was the racist act. Ankie Spitzer and Ilana Romano urged members of the crowd to stand for a spontaneous minute of silence during the opening ceremony. Spitzer claimed that Rogge was using a Munich ceremony organised by the Israelis and the London Jewish community on August 6 as an excuse not to hold the moment of silence. Spitzer said, \\"Jacques Rogge is using it as a hideaway. If the Israeli embassy and London Jewish community were not organizing it, he would not have any memorial to go to.\\" When the Israeli delegation entered the Olympic Stadium, NBC sportscaster Bob Costas noted that the International Olympic Committee denied the requests for a minute of silence, saying in an interview that \\"many people find that denial more than puzzling but insensitive.\\" During the opening ceremony, Costas referred to the spontaneous minute of silence the week before as insufficient, saying, \\"Still, for many, tonight with the world watching is the true time and place to remember those who were lost and how and why they died.\\" Congressman Eliot Engel condemned the IOC's refusal, saying, \\"Shame on you!\\" Joseph Potasnik, vice president of the New York board of rabbis, said, \\"37,360: these are the number of minutes in the entire Olympics and they didn't find one.\\" Barbara Berger, whose brother David Mark Berger was killed in the Munich massacre, felt dismayed and offended at the rejection, explaining that \\"A moment of silence may not seem like much. But to us, to the families who lost so much, that silent respect will speak volumes.\\" Such a moment: Aly Raisman, a Jewish-American gymnast who won a gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics, expressed her support for a minute of silence at the Olympics, saying that, \\"The fact it was on the 40th anniversary is special, and winning the gold today means a lot to me. If there had been a moment's silence, I would have supported it and respected it.\\" On August 9, Irwin Cotler, a former Canadian justice minister and attorney-general and a then- member of Parliament, wrote a last-minute plea to Rogge to hold a minute of silence at the closing ceremony of the Olympics. Cotler wrote: Cotler said that the IOC's \\"steadfast reluctance\\" to hold a minute of silence ignores and mocks \\"the calls for a moment of silence by Government leaders... and the sustained international public campaign and anguished civil society appeals.\\" Cotler also mentioned that such a memorial would not be unprecedented, mentioning the minute of silence observed in memory of the Georgian athlete Nodar Kumaritashvili in the 2010 Winter Olympics; the 2002 Winter Olympics' memorialization of the victims of 9/11; and the 2012 Summer Olympics' memorialization of the victims of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, which happened the day after London was awarded the games. Cotler noted that neither of the last two terrorist attacks he mentioned were connected to the Olympics. Non-IOC commemorations On July 25, 2012, the Italian Chamber of Deputies held a minute of silence to mark the 40th anniversary of the Munich massacre and in honour of the victims of the massacre. On July 29, members of the Italian Olympic delegation also held a moment of silence. Those in attendance consisted of approximately 30 individuals, as well as the Italian Tourism and Sports Minister Piero Gnudi, the head of the Italian Olympic Committee Gianni Petrucci, the Chairman of the Israeli Olympic Committee Zvi Varshaviak, and the head of the Israeli delegation Efraim Zinger. On July 27, 2012, over 20,000 people throughout London attended a \\"Minute for Munich\\" program organised by the British Zionist Federation. On the same day, a memorial was held in Trafalgar Square that was attended by approximately 400 people to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Munich massacre. The event, organised by the British Israel Coalition, was \\"a response to the International Olympic Committee's sustained refusal to include a minute of silence in the opening ceremony due to be held tonight.\\" British Prime Minister David Cameron agreed to attend a commemoration at Guildhall to mark the 40th anniversary of the Munich massacre and in honour of the victims of the massacre. Prime Minister Cameron said, \\"It's right that in 2012 – 40 years on from the Munich Olympics – we remember the Israeli team members who were killed there.\\" Israelis marked the 40th anniversary of the Munich massacre in London, during which prayers were read for the 11 murdered Israelis, wreaths were laid, and a plaque was unveiled approximately four miles from the Olympic Stadium. London Mayor Boris Johnson attended the event, and recalled watching the massacre in 1972 unfold when he was 8 years old. Johnson said, \\"What sticks in my mind is that sense of sacrilege and a feeling of horror that the world's greatest sporting event should suffer such an attack, and that an attack should be mounted against people who had been training for what should have been the greatest event in their lives. And I think the world watched with a sense of numb disbelief as those events unfolded because sport should transcend politics.\\" In addition, Israeli TV commentators held an informal 30-second silence during the Olympics opening ceremony. On July 31, a minute of silence was held aboard an EasyJet flight from London to Israel as their airplane flew over Munich, Germany. The captain of the flight agreed to a request from the passengers to hold a minute of silence, and asked passengers to do so. A memorial ceremony was held on August 6, organised by the National Olympic Committee of Israel, the embassy of Israel in London, and the Jewish Committee for the London Games. IOC president Jacques Rogge, British Prime Minister David Cameron, London mayor Boris Johnson, Israeli Sports and Culture Minister Limor Livnat and other representatives attended the ceremony. A message of support was read from Charles, the Prince of Wales. Prime Minister Cameron said: > It is right that we should stop and remember the 11 Israeli athletes who so > tragically lost their lives when those values came under attack in Munich 40 > years ago. It was a truly shocking act of evil. A crime against the Jewish > people. A crime against humanity. A crime the world must never forget. Cameron also recalled the 7 July 2005 London bombings, and that Britain too had suffered from terrorism. Livnat said that \\"not observing a silence grants a moral victory to the evil.\\" Ankie Spitzer said \\"Is the IOC only interested in power and money and politics? Did they forget that they are supposed to promote peace, brotherhood and fair play?\\" Spitzer and Ilana Romana, who had previously requested that Rogge be banned from the ceremony, said that the IOC had discriminated against the dead athletes because they were Israelis and Jews. They added that they were personally hurt and felt insulted by Rogge.Anshel Pfeffer,'Munich families attack International Olympic Committee president at memorial event,' at Haaretz, August 7, 2007. Spitzer exclaimed, \\"Shame on you!\\" in reference to IOC President Rogge for refusing to hold one minute of silence.

This exodus is reflected in over 100 English-speaking schools that have closed in recent years. The students at McGill University and Concordia University cite better work opportunities outside of the province as a reason for leaving. Frequently the lack of a Francophone background is cited as an obstacle for anglophones, even for those that are bilingual. Weintraub also looks at the role that the Office québécois de la langue française plays in making anglophone businesses comply with language laws, calling for the use of French language signage instead of English. The film juxtaposes a worried minority's present position with their past in Montreal, where English- speakers once outnumbered francophones, where the mayor was English-speaking and it was difficult to be served in French in downtown department stores. The film also addresses key moments of significance to the Anglo community in Montreal, such as the demolition of the Van Horne Mansion in 1973. Weintraub also displays the significant role that Anglo business has played in cultivating Montreal's overseas image as a \\"North American Paris.\\" As the Anglo youth leave Montreal and the elderly stay behind, the film poses questions about the future and sustainability of the Anglo community in Montreal and the province itself.

While growing up, Jones spent a brief time back in Flint, where he was pursuing studies in visual arts, before ultimately moving to Atlanta to pursue a career in music.

Biography Eric Slater was a colour woodcut artist who had an international reputation in the 1920s and 1930s.Exhibition showcases famous Seaford artist Eric Slater, Sussex Express, 6 May 2012 The son of a silversmith, he was born in Hampstead, London. When he was eight, his father died and he moved with his mother to East Sussex, first to Bexhill-on-Sea, then to Winchelsea, and finally, in 1929, to Seaford. He attended the Hastings School of Art. Notable for their beautifully observed skies, many of Slater's prints are inspired by the South Downs and the coastline near his home. His printmaking was revered during his relatively short career, and much admired by Campbell Dodgson, then Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum. Slater was a member of the Society of Graver Printers in Colour and the Society of Print Makers of California. His work was exhibited in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Austria and South Africa, but he stopped making woodcuts soon after the death of his mother in 1938. By the time Slater died in 1963, he had sunk into obscurity. With no close surviving relatives, a priest organised his burial in Seaford. An exhibition of his landscapes was held at the Towner Gallery in Eastbourne, East Sussex, in 2012 - the first public display of his work for 70 years. Exhibitions in Seaford and Lewes followed in 2013, that year being the 50th anniversary of Slater's death, and Slater's work continues to be exhibited and publicised. Slater's prints are held by the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, and can also be found in national museums in Canada and New Zealand. The Towner exhibition helped revive interest in his work and the output of other British artists who used Japanese techniques to make colour woodcuts - a printing method introduced to the UK by Frank Morley Fletcher (1866-1949) in the 1890s. A book about Slater by James Trollope, called Slater's Sussex, has been published by Towner.http://www.townereastbourne.org.uk/event/eric-slater-book- launch-and-talk/ Slater was taught the Japanese woodcut technique by his Sussex neighbour Arthur Rigden Read (1879-1955).

The Spanish troops were part of the Imperial forces in Denmark, which were under the leadership of Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte. Most of the Spanish troops were successfully spirited away by the British navy and shipped to Santander, Spain to fight against France in the Peninsular War. In 1807, the Spanish Division of the North was sent to northern Europe to participate in the planned Franco-Danish invasion of Sweden. Formerly loyal to the alliance with Imperial France, the Spanish officers and men found in 1808 that Emperor Napoleon I of France had overthrown King Charles IV of Spain and Prince Ferdinand and placed his brother Joseph Bonaparte on the Spanish throne. The British sent an agent to contact La Romana and found that the general desired to escape from Denmark. The two arranged a secret plan for the Spanish troops to be evacuated by the British fleet. One cavalry and two infantry regiments failed to get away and remained in Napoleon's power. But in August 1808, most units were able to seize Danish shipping and make their way to the rendezvous with the British navy. About 9,000 Spanish troops disembarked at Santander in October 1808 and had a chance to fight against the French. Background In 1806, Spain was an ally of Emperor Napoleon's First French Empire. After all, it was the combined fleets of France and Spain that were defeated by the British at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. At this time, Manuel de Godoy, Prince of the Peace was a favorite of King Charles IV of Spain, enjoying great influence. At the start of the War of the Fourth Coalition, which pitted the Kingdom of Prussia against Napoleon, Godoy issued a proclamation that was obviously aimed at France, even though it did not specify an enemy. After Napoleon's decisive victory at the Battle of Jena- Auerstedt, Godoy quickly withdrew the proclamation. But it was too late to avert the emperor's suspicion. From that moment, Napoleon planned to deal with his inconstant ally at some future time. In the meantime, the French emperor dragooned Godoy and Charles IV into providing a division of Spanish troops to serve in northern Europe. In March 1807, 15,000 Spanish troops set out for northern Europe under the command of Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana. Altogether, there were 14 battalions of foot soldiers and five regiments of horse. Their first destination was Hamburg. La Romana's Division served under Marshal Guillaume Brune at the Siege of Stralsund which ended on 20 August 1807 when the Swedish garrison evacuated the city. Brune commanded 40,000 troops from France, the Kingdom of Holland, the Kingdom of Italy, the Grand Duchy of Baden, and some lesser German states. The Spanish contingent included 9,763 infantry, 2,340 cavalry in 12 squadrons, 324 gunners in four foot artillery batteries, and 104 sappers. The besiegers lost 998 men killed, wounded, missing, or died from disease. Spanish casualties are unknown. The Division of the North spent the winter of 1807–1808 in Swedish Pomerania, Mecklenburg, and towns of the old Hanseatic League. In early 1808, the Spanish troops marched into Denmark. According to an 1808 state of the army, the line infantry regiments each had three battalions of four companies and their strengths were, Asturias (2,103), Guadalajara (2,069), Princesa (1,969), and Zamora (2,096). The light infantry regiments each consisted of one battalion of six companies and their numbers were, 1st of Barcelona (1,266) and 1st of Catalonia (1,164). The heavy cavalry regiments each counted five squadrons and their strengths were, Rey Nr. 1 (634), Infante Nr. 4 (615), and Algarve Nr. 9 (572). The Light Cavalry also had five squadrons and their numbers were, Almanza Nr. 3 (598) and Villaviciosa Nr. 5 (628). The Division of the North came under the command of Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte who was tasked with defending the southwestern shore of the Baltic Sea. In addition to La Romana's Spaniards, the marshal controlled 30,000 Danish troops plus French and Dutch units. Napoleon, whose plans to seize Spain were well advanced, made sure that the Spanish units were spread out so that it would be difficult to assemble them in one place. Furthermore, Danish troops were always posted nearby. A painting of Pedro Caro y Sureda. The 4,000 men of the Asturias and Guadalajara Regiments were stationed near Roskilde on the island of Zealand (Sjælland). The 4,500-strong Princesa, 1st of Barcelona, Almanza, and Villaviciosa Regiments were posted on the island of Funen (Fyn) along with La Romana's headquarters which were at Nyborg. The 1st of Catalonia Regiment was quartered on Langeland. The Algarve, Infante, Rey, and Zamora Regiments were stationed at Aarhus (Århus), Fredericia, and Randers on Jutland. Watching the various Spanish contingents were the main Danish army on Zealand, 3,000 Danes at Odense on Funen, 800 Danes and a company of French on Langeland, and a Dutch light cavalry brigade and Danish infantry on Jutland. To keep the soldiers quiet, Napoleon increased the officers' pay and promised La Romana the Grand Cross of the Légion d'Honneur. In order to flatter the Spaniards, Bernadotte used a troop of the Rey Regiment as his personal escort. During the spring, the French authorities began intercepting the dispatches between La Romana and the Spanish government. However, they failed to stop a Spanish officer who arrived in April with a message protesting that 15 messages had been sent from Spain without a reply from the Division of the North. At last, La Romana and his officers became aware of the French seizure of Barcelona, Figueras, and Pamplona in March. Soon afterward came the tidings of the Dos de Mayo Uprising. Nearly all of the officers and men were infuriated by the news but realized that they were encompassed by enemies and far from home. On 24 June, La Romana learned that Joseph Bonaparte had been proclaimed king. One of his staff officers, Joseph O'Donnell noted, \\"The more they tried to persuade us that Spain was tranquil, and had settled down to enjoy an age of felicity under Napoleon, the more clearly did we forsee the scenes of blood, strife, and disaster which were to follow these incredible events.\\" Espionage Denmark map shows Sjaelland (Zealand) and Fyn (Funen) and towns of Århus and Fredericia. Langeland is the long, narrow island between Fyn and Lolland. After the outbreak of the Peninsular War, the British government desired to get in touch with the Division of the North to see whether its soldiers wished to fight against Napoleon. An authority consulted Francisco Javier Castaños, who assured him that the troops would do so. Since the British navy totally dominated the Baltic Sea it was feasible to pick up the Spaniards if only they could reach the coast. First, an agent had to brave Napoleon's secret police in order to get in touch with La Romana. Luckily, Sir Arthur Wellesley had suggested such a person to British Foreign Secretary George Canning before departing to command the army in Portugal that went on to win the Battle of Vimeiro in August 1808. James Robertson was a Roman Catholic priest who was born in Scotland but spent much of his life in a monastery in Regensberg, Germany. He went to England where he took employment as a tutor to an aristocratic family. While there, he let Wellesley know that he was willing to serve the British government in its struggle against Napoleon's empire. Canning contacted Robertson who accepted the mission to get in touch with La Romana. The spy was introduced into Europe via a smuggling ship that passed from Heligoland to Bremerhaven. Finding that the Spaniards were no longer in the vicinity of the Hanseatic towns, Robertson traveled north into Denmark, posing as a German merchant of chocolate and cigars, which were contraband goods. Robertson made his way to Nyborg and introduced himself to La Romana with his chocolate and cigars, which he knew were especially desired by the Spanish officers. But as soon as he and the Spanish general were in private, he blurted out his mission. He knew it was possible that La Romana might turn him over to Napoleon's police to be hanged as a spy. At first, the Spaniard regarded Robertson as a likely French agent trying to test his loyalty. Finally, the priest convinced La Romana that he was working for the British government. The general admitted that he was dismayed by his position and certain that Napoleon's intentions toward Spain were bad. The Scottish priest then revealed the plan for the British navy to evacuate the Division of the North from Denmark and land it at any location in the Spanish empire that La Romana wanted to go. After talking it over with his staff, the Spanish general told Robertson of his desire to go ahead with the operation. Soon afterward, the plan nearly miscarried when the Scot was picked up by a Danish patrol while attempting to signal a British warship off Funen. The priest managed to talk his way out of the situation and later was able to get his message to a British vessel. At length, the commander of the Baltic fleet, Admiral Richard Goodwin Keats contacted Canning that the plan could be put into motion. Transport vessels set out from England for the Baltic. Escape Princesa Line Infantry Regt (left); Catalonia Light Infantry Regt (right) La Romana let a few trusted subordinates into the secret. However, the plan was not confided to the pro-French Brigadier General Jean de Kindelan on Jutland. In order for the evacuation to be a success, La Romana needed to concentrate his scattered troops and seize the nearby ports when the British fleet was close by. The initial strategy was to assemble all the Spanish troops in one place for a grand review for Marshal Bernadotte. This plot was not carried out because orders arrived from France that all Spanish soldiers were required to swear an oath of loyalty to King Joseph Bonaparte. The troops on Jutland and Funen took the oath, their officers ignoring it when the soldiers swore allegiance to Prince Ferdinand rather than to Joseph. However, on Zealand there was a full scale mutiny on 31 July in which an aide de camp to General François Nicolas Fririon was killed. The next day, the Asturias and Guadalajara Regiments were surrounded by superior numbers of Danish troops and compelled to surrender. Thereafter, the soldiers were interned in small groups. Spanish troops under General Romana embarking for Spain, 1808. This incident alarmed Bernadotte, but before he could take stronger measures, the news reached La Romana that Rafael Lobo, an agent of the Spanish Junta had arrived offshore. Lobo indicated that the British fleet was en route, so the Spanish general got the word to his subordinates that it was time to execute the plan. The Spanish troops on Funen seized the port of Nyborg on 7 August. The only resistance was from two Danish vessels in the harbour - the brig Fama and the smaller Søe- OrmenThe London Gazette, 24 August 1808, pp. 1149–1151 \\\\- which were attacked by a British frigate and overwhelmed. The next day, the soldiers on Jutland commandeered some small craft at Fredericia and Aarhus and sailed to Funen. The Infante, Rey, and Zamora Regiments made a clean getaway, but the colonel of the Algarve regiment refused to budge. Finally, the senior captain put the plan into motion but it was too late. Finally aware of the plot, Kindelan rode to a nearby French camp and told them what was going on. A brigade of Dutch hussars intercepted the Algarve Regiment and forced their surrender; the senior captain then killed himself. By this time La Romana had 8,000 Spanish soldiers assembled on Funen. The badly outnumbered Danish contingent at Odense prudently left them alone. Between 9 and 11 August, the troops on Funen sailed across to Langeland where the 1st of Catalonia had overpowered the Danish garrison. La Romana's 9,000 Spanish troops waited on Langeland until 21 August when Keats arrived with three ships of the line and other warships. Keats transshipped the Division of the North to Gothenburg, Sweden where 37 naval transports awaited them. The squadron sailed to Santander where they deposited La Romana's troops by 11 October. The foot soldiers immediately prepared to fight while the cavalrymen marched to Extremadura where they were to collect horses. Aftermath Admiral Keats When the troops arrived at Santander, La Romana formed the infantry into the 5th Division of the Army of Galicia and placed the Conde de San Roman in command. The division was ordered to join Joaquín Blake's army but only the 1st of Catalonia with 1,066 men arrived in time to participate in the Battle of Pancorbo on 29 October 1808. The 5th Division formed the army's rear guard during the subsequent retreat. The French pursuit was so aggressive that San Roman reported to his army commander that he was about to be cut off, so Blake offered battle on 10 November. In the two-day Battle of Espinosa de los Monteros the 5,294-strong division repulsed several French attacks on the first day and suffered about 1,000 casualties including San Roman. A month later, the 5th Division still counted 3,953 bayonets. The soldiers from the regiments that failed to escape Napoleon's clutches were employed in the French invasion of Russia and fought at the Battle of Borodino on 7 September 1812. The 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Joseph Napoleon Regiment formed part of Louis Friant's 2nd Division of the I Corps while the 1st and 4th Battalions fought with Jean-Baptiste Broussier's 14th Division of the IV Corps. As many as 4,000 Spaniards were captured during the retreat from Russia and were handed over to the British Royal Navy at Kronstadt for repatriation to Spain.

After a career in military logistics and education, he served multiple times as Minister of War, and briefly as President of the Council of Ministers (equivalent to prime minister) from 11 April to 14 May 1909 during the penultimate year of the Portuguese constitutional monarchy. Biography =Early life and military career= Sebastião Custódio de Sousa Teles was the son of colonel Casimiro Vítor de Sousa Teles de Morais (Lisbon, 23 May 1805 - ?)—whose maternal grandfather was French—and Antónia Fortunata de Brito e Abreu (Albufeira, 6 May 1808 - Lisbon, 29 July 1889). His brother Casimiro Vítor de Sousa Teles would also become a general. Portuguese sailor and writer Venceslau de Morais was his cousin. Teles began his military career as a volunteer in the 17th Infantry Regiment of the Portuguese Army on 6 January 1863. He was promoted to ensign on 4 January 1871. On 20 September 1906 he was made general of his brigade, and on 26 December 1910 he was transferred to the reserves and made general of a division. His military service took place mostly under the jurisdiction of the Portuguese Army's central organs in Lisbon. He specialized in military logistics and transportation, focusing his work on the region between the Douro and Tagus rivers, as well as the roads and railways of Estremadura Province. He also served in various administrative functions, including as secretary of the Comissão Superior de Guerra (High Commission of War), as director-general of the Serviço de Estado-Maior (General Staff Service), and as a member of the Comissão Consultiva de Defesa do Reino (Consultative Commission for the Defense of the Kingdom). Teles was involved in military education and training, serving as commandant of the Escola do Exército (School of the Army; Portugal's then war college). He wrote various treatises on military organization and Portuguese national defense. One of his works, Introdução ao estudo dos conhecimentos militares (\\"Introduction to the study of military matters\\"), won the Lisbon Academy of Sciences' D. Luís I Prize. The work relates Auguste Comte's Positivist philosophy and the philosophies of Herbert Spencer and Émile Littré to military questions in Portugal. Portuguese intellectuals including Antero de Quental and Teófilo Braga—usually hostile to the military and military themes in academia—lauded the work. Braga even proposed admitting Teles as a member of the Lisbon Academy of Sciences. =Political career= Having dedicated most of his career to military education, Teles did not enter politics until 1898, when he accepted the position of Minister of War in the government led by José Luciano de Castro, leader of the Progressive Party. In his tenure as minister from 18 August 1898 to 25 June 1900, Teles spearheaded various improvements and reforms to the army's overall organization, culminating in the 13 July 1899 approval of the Lei de Reorganização do Exército (Law Reorganizing the Army). On 17 March 1899 Sousa Teles became a Peer of the Realm, granting him a spot in the Chamber of Peers, the upper house of the Cortes Gerais (Portugal's pre- republican parliament). He focused his parliamentary career on topics related to the military, particularly reforms to promotions, uniforms, and recruitment, and the ultimately unsuccessful establishment of a \\"parliamentary committee of war\\" (comissão parlamentar de guerra). Teles served as Minister of War twice more: between 20 October 1904 and 27 December 1905 as part of another José Luciano de Castro government, and between 4 February 1908 and 14 May 1909 under the successive governments led by Francisco Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral, Artur Alberto de Campos Henriques, and himself. His second and third tenures as minister took place in a time of increasing political instability following the assassination of King Carlos I of Portugal by republicans. Teles's parliamentary career and multiple tenures as minister gained a him reputation for significant involvement in party politics generally and the Progressive Party specifically, despite the short duration of many governments during the Portuguese monarchy's twilight. He was a nominee for leader of the Progressive Party during the prolonged senescence of José Luciano de Castro. Portuguese historian Maria Filomena Mónica suggests Teles's relative permanence in government from 1908 through 1909 may be attributed to his desire to elbow out Francisco da Veiga Beirão as the Progressive Party leader, though Teles did not succeed in doing so. Teles's brief 33-day service as President of the Council of Ministers (equivalent to prime minister) between 11 April and 14 May 1909—under which he also served as his own Minister of War—took place in an increasingly volatile political milieu. The short-lived administration resigned following the \\"Caeiro de Mata\\" incident, in which the young parliamentary deputy challenged former Minister of Finance to a duel. During a plenary session of the Cortes Gerais on 10 March 1909, Caeiro de Mata had accused Espregueira of fraud and other \\"criminal\\" activities for deciding to loan public money to the , a railway company to which Espregueira was linked. Both participants left the duel unscathed. When Caiero de Mata returned to the Chamber of Deputies (the Cortes's lower house) on 25 April 1909 without apologizing for the duel and breach of decorum, many other deputies refused to carry out their parliamentary duties in protest. In response Caeiro de Mata fought another inconclusive duel: this time with parliamentary majority leader , after which many deputies continued avoiding the Chamber of Deputies. Sousa Teles's government was forced to resign, further eroding the Portuguese monarchy's legitimacy. The First Portuguese Republic was declared on 5 October 1910. Sousa Teles publicly declared his support for the Republic and decided to retire from politics. He died on 7 June 1921 in Lisbon. Honors Teles received multiple military decorations for his academic works on military logistics and organization, including Knight, Commander, and Grand Officer of the Order of Aviz; Commander of the Military Order of Saint James of the Sword; Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword; Grand Cross of the Prussian Order of the Crown; and Grand Cross of Military Merit of Spain.

The recruits were to be paid and equipped like regular soldiers; they would be, in effect, a full-time home guard.http://www.royalprovincial.com/military/rhist/nsvol/nsvraise.htm On-Line Institute for Advanced Loyalist Studies The officers of the \\"Royal Nova Scotia Volunteers\\" were mostly lawyers and other men of the Halifax establishment and Francis Legge's political hangers-on, with little or no military experience, along with a number of subalterns brought in from the British Fleet. The most distinguished senior officer was George Henry Monk, who became major and served for the duration.Piers, p 159 Recruiting for the Loyal Regiment of Nova Scotia Volunteers proved to be extremely difficult, owing to Francis Legge's unpopularity. He was finally ordered back to Britain in May, 1776, although he remained colonel and governor in absentia until replaced by John Parr in 1782. Despite a recruiting bounty of two guineas, by April, 1776, only sixty men had been mustered, at very heavy expense. The officers were so discouraged that they sent a petition of grievances to the Secretary of State on June 14. Rather than being trained as soldiers, the men were sent to Spanish River, Cape Breton to dig coal for the army. The next summer, forty men went back to colliery while twenty served as marines on the Royal Navy sloop HMS Gage. The subalterns were returned to the Fleet.Piers, p 160 - 61 Service duties As resentment of Francis Legge died away, the fortunes of the Loyal Regiment changed. Returns show that by February, 1780, 568 men had enlisted and 92 had deserted, for an overall strength of 476 rank and file. This was very close to the re-authorized strength of a half-battalion (500). Due to officer absences, the unit was under day-to-day command of the senior captain, John Solomon, at Fort Sackville. The Volunteers were taking a full share of garrison duties in Halifax and several outposts.Piers, p 161 - 62 Given the importance of Halifax to the overall British war effort, this was useful employment. In 1782 a detachment was sent to the Island of St. John. Not only the size, but the desirable reputation of the Loyal Nova Scotia Volunteers grew in later years. A few months before disbandment, Brigadier-General Henry Edward Fox expressed: > ... the great satisfaction he has received in seeing the two provincial > battalions of Royal N.S. Volunteers and the King's Orange Rangers, and > highly approves of their discipline and military appearance, more > particularly of the soldierlike manoeuvres and quick-step of the Royal N. > Sco. Volunteers which has so much the appearance of troops that have been > employed in active service.Piers, p 163 Uniforms In 1775-1776 the men of the Volunteers mostly wore civilian clothing; essentially, whatever they were wearing when they enlisted. Their first uniforms arrived in early 1777, green coats faced white, with white smallclothes, in common with most other Loyalist corps of the American command at that time. Officers wore silver lace. By 1779 the regiment was wearing red coats faced buff, and officers' metal had changed to gold. There is a reference to red coats faced green in 1783.Chartrand, René; American Loyalist Troops 1775-84, Osprey Publishing, Oxford, UK, 2008, p 23 Regiment Disbanded The Loyal Nova Scotia Volunteer Regiment was disbanded at noon on Monday, October 20, 1783. The officers went on half-pay, and those officers and men who wished received land grants in the area of Ship Harbour.Piers, p 163 - 64 Cpt.

A staunch Royalist, he was knighted and appointed as a Vice Admiral by the future Charles II, and licensed as a privateer. Biography Mucknell was born to Catholic parents in Stepney, in the East End of London, and baptised at St Dunstan's Church in September 1608. He and his wife Elizabeth later lived in the neighbouring parish of Poplar. Mucknell became a ship's commander under the East India Company, a powerful firm trading between England and the East Indies. By 1643, Mucknell was unhappy with Puritan opinions and set sail on the John, a new East India Company 44-gun ship, bound for Surat. After marooning his enemies on a small island called Johanna, among the Comoros in the north end of the Mozambique Channel, Mucknell sailed first to Bristol and then to the Isles of Scilly. There, Mucknell united and took control of local pirates and the John became the flagship. There were about 11 ships in the group. Mucknell operated in the English Channel and the Western Approaches between 1644 and 1651. Legacy There are three extant first hand accounts from crew members of the John. Todd Stevens, a shipwreck hunter, claims to have found the wreck of the John. English Heritage announced plans to dive the wreck in June 2012.

Later he served as Deputy Minister for heavy machinery and equipment of the GDR.  Life  Rentzsch was born in Schmiedeberg, Germany and worked as a carpenter. Between 1927 and 1933 he was a member of the Socialist Working Youth. He became a soldier in the German Reichswehr in 1934, serving in a Nebelwerfer-Abteilung and was promoted to sergeant. During the Second World War he was nominated for an officer's career. Rentzsch became a lieutenant in 1940 and a first lieutenant in 1942. He was captured at Stalingrad in 1943 and taken into Soviet captivity. He became a member of the National Committee for a Free Germany and worked as a front organization representative of the Soviet 6th Guards Army engaged in propaganda work. According to the memoirs of Marshal Ivan Bagramyan, his German anti-fascists activities were instrumental in organizing the Battle of Königsberg. He became a member of the German Communist Party in July 1945 after attending a short course at the anti-fascist school in Rüdersdorf. In 1946 he became a member of Socialist Unity Party (SED). Rentzsch served as the mayor of the city of Stollberg/Ore mountains from 1945 to 1947 and from 1947 to 1948 he was the chief administrator of the district Stollberg. In 1948, Rentzsch was involved as one of the early leaders in the development of the Kasernierte Volkspolizei (Barracked People's Police), the nucleus for the National People’s Army. In 1948/49 he was the Chief Inspector and head of the border alert police of the German Administration of the Interior. After appropriate further military training in the Soviet Union from 1949 to 1950, he became a Major General of the People's Police in 1952. He served as commander of the Territorial Department North. After the founding of the National People's Army, he was commander of the Military District V. In 1957 he was Director of Training at the Ministry of National Defense. In 1959 he was the Director of Administration at the headquarters of the National People’s Army Artillery. In 1959, the German Democratic Republic started dismissing former Wehrmacht soldiers from active duty and Rentzsch was transferred in the reserves. He became principal director of the state owned industry UNIMAK (Universalmaschinen Koppatsch) which coordinated all armament industries. He was thus responsible for oversight of various munitions factories and chemical plants. Between 1961 and 1965 he was Deputy Chairman of the Economic Council of the GDR and 1966/67 Deputy Minister of heavy machinery and plant construction. Between 1967 and 1972, Rentzsch was the first Director of Administration for Defense Economics to the chairman of the Council of Ministers.

CBC News, February 26, 2019. Although shortlived and often in conflict with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission over its lack of a broadcast license, the service did have the effect of forcing Canada's major commercial television networks to add rebroadcast transmitters in a number of communities they had previously ignored.\\"Hamlets in the North get flea-powered TV\\". The Globe and Mail, January 6, 1978. The service's operator, David Brough, told The Globe and Mail in 1978 that his ultimate goal was to operate five transmitters in each community: two general entertainment channels to rebroadcast content from CTV and Global, a French channel to rebroadcast content from TVA (and Radio-Canada, where that service was not already available), an educational programming service and a local community channel. In actual practice, only one station was actually set up in each community, which aired either English-only or English and French programming depending on local market needs. In the Globe interview, Brough clarified that his position was that he was simply using a different technological method to deliver a service legally and ethically no different from a cable television provider. The networks, however, viewed his methods as copyright infringement. History Brough was a special education teacher at an institution for the mentally challenged and an entertainer for the Toronto-based Uncle Bobby children's TV series. In 1969 Brough travelled throughout remote northern Canada as a solo performer. During these tours he noted the lack of radio and television service in many regions and developed methods to bring television to remote Canadian communities. In 1971, Brough created a prototype television program in Yellowknife using portable videotape technology and demonstrated this to the CBC's board of directors. When the CBC rejected his proposals for extending television service, Brough then developed an inexpensive television system which could be installed in remote communities. The station depended on taped programming which would be shipped to the station, rather than on microwave or satellite transmissions. A camera was available at the station for local broadcasts. Brough installed the first Northern Access Network station at Pickle Lake, Ontario in December 1976 with support by Umex, the operator of a local mine. Operating costs of recording and shipping programming tapes were covered with subscriber fees through a locally-run trust fund. The television channel was not licensed by the CRTC. When police attempted to confiscate the station's equipment, local miners and loggers defended the station by chopping down trees to block Highway 599.\\"100 TV channels free for taking\\". The Globe and Mail, March 21, 1980. A Northern Access Network station was opened at Longlac, Ontario in 1977. French programming was included on that station to support the predominantly francophone community. Previously, only the CBC English network television service was available there. On 2 February 1978, the Longlac transmitter was seized by RCMP and Ontario Provincial Police officers accompanied by a representative from the federal Department of Communications. In May 1977, the CRTC and the Department of Communications indicated that they would demonstrate some tolerance to the unlicensed Northern Access Network stations. They adopted an approach where further attempts at station closures were unlikely, particularly where television service was otherwise unavailable. Brough applied to the CRTC to formally license his stations. A hearing for that application was conducted that October. The CRTC awarded licences for five of his northern Ontario stations in late 1979, but rejected licences for many other existing stations. Brough's dilemma was that the smaller licensed stations would not be viable without income support from the unlicensed stations in more populous communities. Although it had been opposed to his original unlicensed methods, CTV did offer a network affiliation deal to Brough's licensed stations. The Northern Access Network grew from 30 stations in its first year to 50 by 1979. There were plans for up to 100 additional stations at that point. By 1981, Brough turned his attention to the development of satellite television receive-only systems. He began Commander Satellite Systems that year. Operations A typical Northern Access Network station consisted of a tower with a low power transmitter. The programming signal originated from either a local video camera or a Betamax videocassette recorder. Brough recorded television programming in Toronto, primarily from the commercial networks CTV and Global, onto Betamax tapes which he then sent to the stations for broadcast. Tapes were sent out by mail, with the expectation that once broadcast, they would be sent on to the next station. The initial Pickle Lake station featured a tower of supported by a one watt transmitter to provide an approximately coverage area. Total equipment cost at Pickle Lake was approximately $4000. Brough modified the Betamax cassette system so that it could contain 10 hours of programming which reduced shipping costs. In the late 1970s, each modified cassette cost Brough $30 compared to the $47 cost of each conventional Betamax cassette. Stations were funded primarily through an expectation that viewers of the station would contribute toward an operational fund, although in many towns a large percentage of the viewership did not do so. A secondary source of operating funds for the stations was the broadcast of a televised bingo game, which viewers could play at home by buying bingo cards. Later, an inexpensive television encryption was developed for approximately $8 per descrambling unit. This allowed Northern Access Network to enforce a subscriber fee system in its communities. Coverage Ontario communities served by Northern Access Network besides Pickle Lake and Longlac included Armstrong, Balmertown, Caramat, Cochenour, Dubreuilville, Ear Falls, Ignace, Mattabi Mines, Moosonee, Nakina, Sioux Lookout, South Bay Mine and Wawa. In early 1978, Manitoba stations were established at Gillam, Leaf Rapids and Lynn Lake, where the only existing television at the time was from CBC. Other stations were established in the Northwest Territories (Inuvik, Tuktoyaktuk) and in Newfoundland (St Anthony).

Torrential rains on 29 and 30 July 2012 worsened the situation, causing additional damage and casualties and forcing the government to request international assistance. Severe rainfall also affected the southern region of North Korea in August, killing at least six. Tropical Storm Khanun Tropica Storm Khanun over North Korea on 19 July Houses in South Hamgyong Province damaged by floods in July 2012 Khanun made landfall in South Korea on 19 July and weakened as it moved over North Korea before dissipating over China. The government on 29 July increased the number of fatalities as a result of flooding caused by Khanun from 8 to 88, with an additional 134 injured. The biggest loss of human life was in two counties of South Pyongan province. At least 62,900 were made homeless by the flooding, while more than 30,000 hectares of land for growing crops were submerged and will add to growing fears of another looming famine in the country. Three hundred public buildings and 60 factories were damaged during the storm. July 29-30 rains Torrential rains hit North Korea again on 29 and 30 July, with approximately 442 millimeters (17.4 inches) of rain recorded in Pakchon County of North Phyongan Province during a 24-hour period from 6 a.m. local time 29 July. The rains worsened the flood situation caused by Khanun, destroying railways, roads, bridges and 'many' dwelling houses. The government said many residents in the affected region were left homeless, but no figures have yet been released about damage and casualties. The North Korean government has asked assistance from resident United Nations agencies, the Red Cross, and European Union Program Support Units. The North Korean government also supported two inter-agency assessment missions in South Pyongan and Kangwon provinces on 31 July. On 1 August, KCNA announced that North and South Pyongan provinces and Nyongwon county were severely affected by floods, landslides and thunderbolts, which destroyed 4,900 dwellings, submerged 8,530 homes and destroyed or submerged 200 public buildings and factories. KCNA also reported significant damage to coal mining and processing infrastructure in the area. Some 179,000 tonnes of coal were washed away, along with about 200 pieces of equipment at the Kaechon and Tokchon mining complexes. Railways serving the complexes were also damaged. State media reported at least 31 were killed by landslides and lightning, with 16 others missing. On 4 August, the North Korean government said the death toll from both Khanun and the torrential rains in late July had risen to 169, with around 400 others missing. It said 8,600 houses were destroyed and 44,000 houses were flooded, leaving more than 212,200 people homeless. 17–20 August rains Torrential rains hit North Korea again between late 17 August and early 20 August, causing at least six deaths and destroying more than 530 buildings in the southern region of the country. Three people were killed in North Hwanghae Province, three people were also killed in South Phyongan Province, and an unknown number of people were killed in South Hwanghae Province. Typhoon Bolaven In North Korea, heavy rains from the storm triggered significant flooding and many landslides in late August. In South Hamgyong Province, at least 100 homes were flooded by the storm. KCNA reported wind speeds of more than in North and South Hwanghae, South Hamgyong, South Pyongan and the city of Nampho, and waves as high as in the sea of Kimchaek. Widespread damage took place throughout the country as a result of the storm. At least 6,700 homes were destroyed and approximately 101,000 hectares (250,000 acres) of crop and rice fields were flooded. Additionally, 16,730 trees were downed and 880 public and industrial buildings were severely damaged. In all, at least 48 people were killed and 21,800 others were left homeless.

Levine studied biology as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, studying biology with Allan Wilson and graduating in 1976.UCSD Press Release, April 30, 1996. He went on to graduate studies at Yale, where he studied with Alan Garen and in 1981 received a Ph.D. in molecular biophysics and biochemistry.

There, he co-discovered the homeobox with Ernst Hafen and fellow post-doc William McGinnis: > After learning that Ultrabithorax, a gene that specifies the development of > wings, showed a localized pattern of expression similar to that of > Antennapedia, they decided to revisit the classic papers of Ed Lewis.

Those were the days.\\"  Discovery of the eve stripe 2 enhancer  Levine briefly returned to UC Berkeley as a postdoctoral fellow with Gerry Rubin.Mike Levine (Abstract), Current Biology, v.13, n.14, R545 (July 15, 2003). He then joined the faculty of Columbia University, where he \\"led the discovery of the modular organization of the regulatory regions of developmental genes.\\" After isolating the even-skipped (eve) gene, Levine's team determined that each of the seven stripes was produced by separate enhancers. With further study they discovered that both a set of activators and a set of repressors worked together to shape the expression of eve in the second stripe, and determined that the repressors shut down only their binding enhancers, leaving other enhancers free of repression. Joseph Corbo said of the work, > \\"Before Levine's studies of even-skipped stripe 2, it wasn't clear how you > generated spatially restricted patterns of gene expression from initially > broad crude gradients of morphogens. I think that the even-skipped stripe 2 > studies were the defining studies that showed how an organism can interpret > those gradients and turn them into specific patterns of gene expression. To > me that's Mike's crowning achievement.\\"  Discoveries in the ascidian Ciona  After earning tenure in only four years at Columbia, Levine moved to UCSD in 1991, where he added the sea squirt, Ciona intestinalis, to his repertoire. Although much of Levine's work, including his homeobox studies, has been done in Drosophila Levine's team is also prominent in work with the sea squirt, Ciona intestinalis, an invertebrate that facilitates study of development. For example, this work included insights into classical myodeterminants and the composition of the notochord, the defining tissue of the chordate phylum. = Awards = * 1982 - Jane Coffin Childs Postdoctoral Fellowship * 1985 - Searle Scholars Research Fellowship\\"Michael Levine\\", Searle Scholars Program directory.

On choosing to become a research biologist, he described some family pressure to become a doctor (\\"Coming from a modest background, particularly a Jewish family, the pressure to become a doctor was intense\\"), Fellow biologist Sean Carroll said of Levine, \\"Mike's work has done for animal development what the work on the lac operon and phage lambda did for understanding gene regulation in simpler organisms ... [Those] two big discoveries had a very large conceptual significance for developmental biology and by extension for evolutionary biology.\\"Sean B. Carroll, quoted in Levine is well-known within academic biologist circles for his unconventional sense of humor, including an incident in which he lit a ring of fire around a postdoc: > \\"The most famous thing I ever did is I torched one of my postdocs,\\" says > Levine.

Beagle is a book written by the English naturalist Charles Darwin. The book was published in 1844, and is based on his travels during the second voyage of HMS Beagle, commanded by captain Robert FitzRoy. It is the second book in a series of geology books written by Darwin, and also includes The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs, published in 1842, and Geological Observations on South America, published in 1846. The text contains seven chapters, and includes observations made during Darwin's travels to the volcanic island of St. Jago in Cape Verde, the Fernando de Noronha archipelago, Ascension Island, the island of Saint Helena, the Galápagos Islands, James Island, New Zealand, Australia, Van Diemen's Land, and the Cape of Good Hope. The book includes one of the earliest accounts of the process of magmatic differentiation. While observing a basaltic lava flow in the Galápagos Islands, Darwin observed that \\"crystals sink from their weight\\" Available on-line at: Internet ArchiveOn p. 117 of his Geological Observations on the Volcanic Islands … (1844), Darwin noted the precipitation of albite crystals within basaltic lava on Santiago Island (or \\"James Island\\") of the Galápagos Islands. He then cited a work by \\"von Buch\\" (German geologist and paleontologist Christian Leopold von Buch (1774–1853)): Physikalische Beschreibung der canarischen Inseln [Physical description of the Canary Islands] (Berlin, 1825), which was translated into French as: Léopold von Buch, with C. Boulanger, trans., Description physique des Îles Canaries (Paris, France: F. G. Levrault, 1836). Darwin cited pp. 190–191 of that translation, where Buch mentions a similar geological formation on the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands and where he mentions a \\"M. de Drée\\", who had found experimentally that feldspar crystals form and precipitate in molten lava: \\"Les expériences de M. de Drée, dans lesquelles il a fait fondre diverses laves dans un creuset, ont prouvé que dans une telle masse fluide, les cristaux de feldspath devaient tendre à se précipiter au fond.\\" (The experiments of M. de Drée, in which he melted various lavas in a crucible, proved that in such a fluid mass, crystals of feldspar should tend to precipitate to the bottom.) \\"M. de Drée\\" was Étienne-Marie-Gilbert, Marquis de Drée (1760–1848) [ Fr ], a French amateur geologist who in 1808 had presented to L'Institut national de France his paper \\"Mémoire sur un nouveau genre de liquéfaction ignée qui explique la formation des laves lithoïdes\\" (Memoir on a new type of igneous liquefaction that explains the formation of stony lavas). (Summarized (in French) in: Etienne-Marie-Gilbert Drée (1808 March 28) \\"Mémoire sur un nouveau genre de liquéfaction ignée qui explique la formation des laves lithoïdes,\\" Nouveau Bulletin des Sciences, 1 : 137–142.) On pp. 16–17 of the memoir, Drée stated: \\"En plaçant le morceau de porphyre dans le creuset no. 6, je suis certain que ce morceau touchoit au fond du creuset, et cependant on voit dans le produit tous les cristaux réunis dans la partie supérieure, preuve que la liquéfaction a été assez complète pour permettre l'élévation des cristaux de feld-spath (1).\\" (In placing the piece of porphyry in crucible number 6, I'm certain that that piece touched the bottom of the crucible, and yet one sees in the product all of the crystals clustered in the upper part — proof that the liquefaction was complete enough to permit the rising [i.e., floating] of the crystals of feldspar (1).) Thus, although Drée had expected the feldspar crystals to float, they instead sank to the bottom of the molten lava — just as had happened in the lavas of James Island and Tenerife. and that this \\"throws light on the separation of the high silica versus low silica series of rocks.\\" This was the first proposal of the fractional crystallization hypothesis of magma differentiation that was further developed and demonstrated in the 20th century. Charles Darwin wrote Geological Observations on the Volcanic Islands as part of a series of books on geology. The geologist Archibald Geikie praised the book, calling it \\"the best authority on the general geological structure of most of the regions it describes,\\" and that Darwin was \\"one of the earliest writers to recognize the magnitude of denudation to which even recent geological accumulations have been subjected.\\" A second edition of the book, published in 1876, combines Geological Observations on the Volcanic Islands with Geological Observations on South America.

Released October 22, 2012, it was their last release under Psychopathic Records, as they left the label following its release. Abominationz was predominantly produced by Strange Music in-house producer Seven. Featured guests on the album include Royce da 5'9\\" and Insane Clown Posse. A variation edition of the album featured additional guest appearances by Krizz Kaliko and Glasses Malone.  Background  On August 16, 2011, Monoxide stated on Twitter that the next Twiztid album would feature a guest appearance from Hopsin. However, this ultimately did not happen. On April 18, 2012, both Jamie Madrox and Monoxide were interviewed on Strange Music's BlogTalkRadio. During the interview, they released the new album title, Abominationz. Recording for the album started in the first week of February 2012 and ended in late March 2012 as Twiztid prepared for their Kaos and Kronik tour. While Twiztid was on tour Joe Strange began mixing songs and recording of the album resumed in June 2012 after Twiztid had returned from tour. The Album was finished being recorded and mixed between June 2012 and September 2012.  Music and lyrics  Producer Seven provided a more varied sound for Twiztid on Abominationz, culling from blues on \\"Bad Side\\", providing a power ballad sound for \\"LDLHA-IBCSYWA\\" and generally drawing from electro and rap rock throughout the album, as well as underlining the raps and music with horror film-inspired sound design. For the album, Twiztid adopted a faster rapping style which allowed the duo to write more lyrics for the album than previous efforts. The duo's primary lyrical inspiration for the album was anger and hate, with elements of dark humor, including gallows humor.  Release  The pamphlet included with Insane Clown Posse's album The Mighty Death Pop! announced that Twiztid's Abominationz would be released on October 23, 2012. The release date was later pushed up to October 22. On October 4, the track listing for Abominationz was released. On October 9, the single and a series of samples from the album were released. Abominationz was released in alternate variant editions, each containing unique outer artwork depicting photographs of Jamie Madrox and Monoxide and a bonus track. The Madrox edition contained the bonus track \\"Return of the Pervert\\", and the Monoxide edition contained the bonus track \\"Sux 2 B U\\", which featured guest vocals by Krizz Kaliko and Glasses Malone. These variant editions were made available to purchase separately, or as a combo. The combined order was shipped with a poster. Those that purchased both Abominationz and Cold 187um's The Only Solution within two weeks of the album's release date also received a bonus CD containing Psychopathic Records' \\"Psyphers\\". In a December 4, 2014 interview, Twiztid stated that they will be re-releasing the album as well as W.I.C.K.E.D..  Reception  Abominationz debuted at number 18 on the Billboard 200 chart and number 4 on the Top Independent Albums and number 2 on the Top Rap Albums charts and number 6 on the Top Tastemaker Albums. As of December the album has sold 29 000 copies. Reviewing the album for Allmusic, David Jeffries gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5, writing, \\"As far as Twiztid as rappers, here they're as shameless and gross [...] as ever, although the tempo of their delivery has steadily increased, making the Abominationz lyric sheet longer than previous albums.

It was created on May 2, 1952, by decree of President Germán Suárez Flamerich, in order to protect the Sierra Nevada de Mérida in the Andes. It was the second national park decreed, after Henri Pittier National Park, which became the first Venezuelan national park 15 years earlier. The Sierra Nevada is an area of great ecological importance for Venezuela, for preservation of the ecosystem of the tallest in the country, where mountain ranges are located at higher altitudes of the Venezuelan Andes, including the Pico Bolívar, the highest geographical in Venezuela with 4,978 m. History The initiative to create the Sierra Nevada Park was born in the Escuela de Ingeniería Forestal since 1948. The proposal takes strength and the University of the Andes, appoints a commission to the preliminary study, later, was presented to national authorities to justify the creation of the park. On May 2, 1952, the Governing Board chaired by Germán Suárez Flamerich, signed a decree which stated the Sierra Nevada as National Park. The Sierra Nevada Park is the second oldest National Park in Venezuela, after Henri Pittier National Park. Initially the park covered an area of 190,000 ha. However, the August 14, 1985 by decree of the National Executive, President Jaime Lusinchi are added other 86,446 ha., leaving a total area of 276,446 ha. Geography The spectacled bear, an endangered species The New Mérida cable car cabin, the highest cable car and tour around the world The park encompasses parts of six municipalities of the states of Mérida and three of the Barinas state. Its total area is 276,446 hectares, of which 185,886 hectares belong to the state of Mérida, which means 67.2% of the total area, while the remaining 90,560 ha represent the state of Barinas, 32.8% of the area of the park. The Sierra Nevada covers one of the two branches of the Cordillera de Mérida in the central Andes of Venezuela, which is the same name Sierra Nevada, the area of it is rugged highlighting the location of the main peaks in the country as these are Pico Bolívar (4,978 m), Pico Humboldt (4,942 m), Pico La Concha (4922), Pico Bonpland (4883), Pico Espejo (4880), Pico León (4740), Pico El Toro (4729) and Pico Mucuñuque (4609). The Sierra Nevada is separated from the Sierra La Culata, other Cordilleran massif of Andean mountain range, by depression of the Chama River in the north, while the northeast makes the valley of the River Santo Domingo, from the Kettle Mucubají to the dam José Antonio Páez. In the southwest, the boundary of the park forms the valley of River Nuestra Señora, left bank tributary of the Chama River, downstream from the city of Ejido. The park is in two major mountain ranges: the Sierra Nevada de Mérida and the Sierra de Santo Domingo, which are characterized by high peaks, glacial valleys and river valleys. Most rivers are the Chama, Albarregas and Mucujún flowing into Lake Maracaibo. Meanwhile, the Orinoco basin, the main ones are the Caparo, the Santo Domingo and the Cajurí that flows into the Uribante. In the park are also thirteen watersheds, and ten lakes of glacial origin, that global warming effects have been reduced, some of them are: Mucubají, La Negra, La Verde and Los Anteojos. The vegetation of the park is representative of the Andean cloud forests, mostly trees and undergrowth layers well developed and numerous epiphytes and endemic species. The higher altitudes, above 3,000 m is developed typical moorland vegetation, consisting of a large number of species of Espeletia. It also presents a xerophytic scrub vegetation in the drier areas of the River Basin Nuestra Señora. In Barinas, the vegetation is predominantly forest, with trees up to 25 m. height. =Climate= The Sierra Nevada has two annual periods, a period of maximum rainfall concentrated between May and October and a dry period or minimum rainfall between December and March. In addition to the precipitation as rain, is also very common in snow precipitation or snowfall in the highest peaks, snowfalls are frequent between July and September and sporadic the rest of the year. Due to its location in a mountain range, the temperature range in the park is quite large, varying its annual average between 26 °C in the lower areas (400 m) and -05 °C in the highest peaks (+ 4900 masl). Fauna Feral cattle in the park For the type of weather that gives the park, it has developed into one of the largest shelter and space for hundreds of animal species. One of the largest species can be found in the park is the spectacled bear, besides being the only representative of the family Ursidae in the Andes, is one of the endangered species. Among other species of wildlife living in the Sierra Nevada are: the white-tailed deer, the helmeted curassow, the puma, the Andean coati, the Andean leopard, the jaguar, the paca and the rabbit of the moor, among others. Feral cattle and horses can be found in the area. Among the birds in the park includes the Andean guan, the white-tailed quetzal, the masked trogon, magpies and black-chested buzzard-eagle, some larger species like the Andean condor are now in danger of extinction and is therefore is taking a restocking program in Colombia.

Located approximately south east of the town of Kilinochchi, the airport is also known as Kilinochchi Airport and SLAF Iranamadu. Originally built by the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 2003, it was captured by the Sri Lankan military in 2009 and taken over by the Sri Lanka Air Force. History The rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam first built an airstrip in Iranamadu in the early 1990s. In 1993 they started clearing land south east of the Iranamadu Tank and over the next two years constructed a runway which was opened by LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran on 19 March 1995. The runway was then bombed and destroyed by the Sri Lanka Air Force. In late 2003, during the Norwegian facilitated ceasefire, the LTTE started clearing land at another site, east of Iranamadu Tank. Within a year the LTTE had built a runway. The air force bombed the airstrip several times, indulging in June 2006 after the Kebithigollewa massacre. The airstrip was the launchpad for a number of Air Tigers attacks including the raid on Anuradhapura Air Force Base in October 2007. The Sri Lankan military captured the airstrip on 15 January 2009. A Sri Lanka Air Force detachment moved onto the site on 21 June 2009. The airstrip became an air station on 3 August 2011. The airstrip was reconstructed in 2011 and opened for light aircraft. The airstrip was then converted into an airport with a runway capable of handling the air force's Lockheed C-130 Hercules and Antonov An-32 aircraft. The new airport was officially opened by President Mahinda Rajapaksa, becoming the country's 16th domestic airport.

Co- created by Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle, he first appeared in Detective Comics #608 (Nov. 1989), as an adversary of Batman. Introduced as Lonnie Machin, a child prodigy with knowledge of radical philosophy and driven to overthrow governments to improve social conditions, stories revolving around Anarky often focus on political and philosophical themes. The character, who is named after the philosophy of anarchism, primarily espouses anti-statism. Multiple social issues have been addressed whenever the character has appeared in print, including environmentalism, antimilitarism, economic exploitation, and political corruption. Inspired by multiple sources, early stories featuring the character often included homages to political and philosophical books, and referenced anarchist philosophers and theorists. The inspiration for the creation of the character and its early development was based in Grant's personal interest in anti-authoritarian philosophy and politics. However, when Grant himself transitioned to the philosophy of Neo-Tech, he shifted the focus of Anarky from a vehicle for socialist and populist philosophy, to rationalist, atheist, and free market-based thought. Originally intended to only be used in the debut story in which he appeared, Grant decided to continue using Anarky as a sporadically recurring character throughout the early 1990s, following positive reception by readers and Dennis O'Neil. The character experienced a brief surge in media exposure during the late 1990s, beginning when Norm Breyfogle convinced Grant to produce a limited series based on the character. The 1997 spin-off series, Anarky, was received with positive reviews and sales, and later declared by Grant to be among his \\"career highlights\\". Batman: Anarky, a trade paperback collection of stories featuring the character, soon followed. This popular acclaim culminated, however, in a financially and critically unsuccessful ongoing solo series. The 1999 Anarky series, in which even Grant has expressed his distaste, was quickly cancelled after eight issues, but not before sparking a minor controversy by suggesting Anarky was the biological son of the Joker. Following the cancellation of the Anarky series, and Grant's departure from DC Comics, Anarky experienced a prolonged period of absence from DC publications, despite professional and fan interest in his return. This period of obscurity lasted approximately ten years, with three brief interruptions for minor cameo appearances in 2000, 2001, and 2005. In 2008, Anarky reappeared in an issue of Robin authored by Fabian Nicieza, with the intention of ending this period of obscurity. The storyline drastically altered the character's presentation, prompting a series of responses by Nicieza. Anarky became a recurring character in issues of Red Robin, authored by Nicieza, which was cancelled in 2011. In 2013 a revamped version of Anarky was debuted as the primary antagonist for Beware the Batman, a Batman animated series produced by Warner Bros. Animation. Later that year, the character made his video game debut in Batman: Arkham Origins, as an anti-villain who attempts to ally with Batman against corruption in Gotham City, while threatening government and corporate institutions with destruction. Publication history =1989–1996: Creation and early depictions= Originally inspired by his personal political leanings, Alan Grant entertained the idea of interjecting anarchist philosophy into Batman comic books. In an attempt to emulate the success of Chopper, a rebellious youth in Judge Dredd, he conceptualized a character as a twelve- year-old anarchist vigilante, who readers would sympathize with despite the character's harsh methods. Creating the character without any consultation from his partner, illustrator Norm Breyfogle, his only instructions to Breyfogle were that Anarky be designed as a cross between V and the Black Spy from Mad magazine's Spy vs. Spy. Grant also briefly considered incorporating Krazy Kat as a third design suggestion, but decided against the idea. In response to deadline pressures, and not recognizing the character's potential, Breyfogle \\"made no preliminary sketches, simply draping him in long red sheets\\". The character was also intended to wear a costume that disguised his youth, and so was fitted with a crude \\"head extender\\" that elongated his neck, creating a jarring appearance. While both of these design elements have since been dropped, more enduring aspects of the character have been his golden face mask, \\"priestly\\" hat, and his golden sceptre. The first Anarky story, \\"Anarky in Gotham City Part 1: Letters to the Editor\\", appeared in Detective Comics #608 (Nov. 1989). Lonnie Machin is introduced as \\"Anarky\\" as early as his first appearance in Detective Comics #608, withholding his origin story for a later point. He is established as an uncommonly philosophical and intelligent 12-year-old. The debut story of the character failed to provide a back story to explain his behavior, but a narrative from Batman reveals that he is a socially conscious and arrogant child who believes he knows how to solve societies' problems. Convinced that only he can do so, he becomes a vigilante and fashions weapons—a stun baton and smoke bombs—in labs at school. Lonnie Machin made his debut as \\"Anarky\\" by responding to complaints in the newspaper by attacking the offending sources, such as the owner of a factory whose byproduct waste is polluting local river water. He goes to lengths to disguise his age and appearance by creating a costume with a false head to increase his height. This was in fact intended as a ruse on the part of writer Alan Grant to disguise the character's true identity, and to confuse the reader into believing Anarky to be an adult. Anarky and Batman ultimately come to blows, and during their brief fight, Batman deduces that Anarky is actually a young child. During this first confrontation, Anarky is aided by a band of homeless men, including Legs, a homeless cripple who becomes loyal to him and would assist him in later appearances. After being caught, Lonnie is locked away in a juvenile detention center. In Grant's earliest script for the character, Anarky was designed to be far more vicious, and to have killed his first victim. Dennis O'Neil, then editor of Detective Comics, requested that Grant \\"tone down\\" the script, as he felt Anarky becoming a murderer at such a young age was morally reprehensible. Grant consented to the request and the script was rewritten. In a 2004 interview, Grant explained the motivation behind this early decision. \\"I wanted to play it that way because it created incredible tension in Anarky himself. Other heroes might kill—Batman used to, in the early days—but for a teenager to rationally decide to take lives ... well, it hadn't been handled in comics before. But Denny was boss, and I respected his opinion and toned things down.\\" Although Grant had not created the character to be used beyond the two-part debut story, positive reactions from reader letters and his editor caused him to change his mind. He then decided to make Lonnie Machin the third Robin, following Jason Todd, desiring a new sidekick who would act as a foil to Batman, and not have the same motivations for vengeance. This was abandoned when he learned that Tim Drake had already been created to fill the role by Marv Wolfman. Quickly rebounding from this decision, Grant instead used the second appearance of Anarky as the antagonist for Tim Drake's first solo detective case. This appearance came in Detective Comics #620. The story chronicles that Anarky increases his computer skills during his detention to the point of becoming an advanced grey hat computer hacker. He takes on the online user alias \\"Moneyspider\\" to steal millions of dollars from Western corporations, including Wayne Enterprises, outmaneuvering Batman's own data security in the process. He then uses the money to create bank accounts for poor farmers in Third World countries. Tim Drake pursues the hacker in an online investigation, tracking Anarky to his location at the detention center. In 2008, Fabian Nicieza would revert Lonnie Machin to this early alias as part of an attempt to reuse the character following a period of absence lasting approximately 10 years. In the years following Anarky's creation, the character was rarely incorporated into Batman stories by Grant, being reserved for stories in which the author felt the need to make a philosophical point. Throughout the early 1990s, Anarky was a lesser-known, but established antagonist in the Batman franchise, frequently depicted as escaping from the detention center and peregrinating around Gotham City. However, his back-story had still yet to be elaborated upon. Grant provided hints to Anarky's origin in Robin Annual #1, \\"The Anarky Ultimatum\\", part of Eclipso: The Darkness Within crossover event. Within the story it is revealed that Lonnie Machin was a highly intelligent child who from an early age read prodigiously at local bookstores, but had few friends. Published in 1992, it would not be until 1995 that Grant would finally elaborate upon Lonnie Machin's fictional history. 1995 saw Grant begin the slow increase in the character's abilities that would culminate in the Anarky series. In the \\"Anarky\\" story arc from Batman: Shadow of the Bat #40–41, Lonnie is released from juvenile detention, and builds a machine that allows him to fuse both hemispheres of his brain, giving him increased intelligence, and what he perceives as enlightenment. Creating an online bookstore, Anarco, to propagate radical literature, he begins to accumulate funds that he donates through another front company, The Anarkist Foundation, to radical organizations, such as eco-warriors and gun protesters, or keeps for his own projects. These story devices served to further improve Anarky's skill set, and increase his intelligence and financial independence. During this storyline, Grant finally revealed Lonnie Machin's origins in full, using a farewell letter to his parents to provide exposition into the character's motivations. The origin story narrates through flashbacks that Lonnie Machin was once an ordinary child who, while abnormally intelligent, was apolitical and unaware of world events. At 11, he gains a foreign pen pal, Xuasus, as part of a school program. Through this contact, Lonnie discovers the level of global corruption he never knew of before. Further studies into war and political violence leads him to hold radical sympathies. He comes to view all wars as being caused by political elites, with common individuals forced or cajoled into fighting on behalf of the former. He becomes convinced of the need to reshape society and becomes Anarky. During the Anarky series, much of the character's development was influenced by the nature of Grant and Breyfogle's association. As part of the story writing process, the duo would engage in philosophical discussion carried out entirely over fax-transmissions. These long, in-depth, and occasionally heated debates influenced plot points, as well as the general direction of Anarky's character development. Because of this, Breyfogle personally considers Anarky to be among their few co-creations, whereas he considers other characters they \\"made\\" together, such as the Ventriloquist, to be entirely Grant's creations. =1997–1999: Anarky series= The cover of Anarky #1 (May 1997) by Norm Breyfogle. Following the comic book industry crash of 1996, Norm Breyfogle was unemployed and looking for work. As a result of a request Breyfogle made to DC for employment, Darren Vincenzo, then an editorial assistant at DC Comics, suggested multiple projects which Breyfogle could take part in. Among his suggestions was an Anarky limited series, written by Grant, which was eventually the project decided upon. The four- issue limited series, Anarky, was published in May 1997. Entitled \\"Metamorphosis\\", the story maintained the character's anti-authoritarian sentiments, but was instead based on Neo-Tech, a philosophy developed by Frank R. Wallace. During the climax of the \\"Anarky\\" storyline of Batman: Shadow of the Bat #41-42, it is implied that Anarky dies in a large explosion. In turn, the Anarky limited series resolved this event by revealing that Anarky survives, but chooses to shed the encumbrance of his double life by faking his death. Anarky works in seclusion to further his goal of achieving a utopian society, briefly hiring Legs and other homeless men to monitor Batman's movements. His four-issue adventure leads him into conflict with Etrigan the Demon and Darkseid, as Anarky confronts the nature of evil through dialogue, and concludes with a showdown against Batman, addressing the issue of consequentialism. Well received by critics and financially successful, Grant has referred to the limited series as one of his favorite projects, and ranked it among his \\"career highlights\\". With its success, Vincenzo suggested continuing the book as an ongoing series to Breyfogle and Grant. Although Grant was concerned that such a series would not be viable, he agreed to write it at Breyfogle's insistence, as the illustrator was still struggling for employment. Grant's primary concerns centered on his belief that Anarky's role as a non-superpowered teenager was not capable of competing for reader attention when DC Comics already had a similar series in Robin. Further, while potential disagreements with editors over story elements were not among his initial concerns, he eventually found himself constantly at odds with editors and editorial assistants throughout the creation of the series. Grant's doubts concerning the comic's prospects eventually proved correct. The series was panned by critics, failed to catch on among readers, and was canceled after eight issues, however Grant has noted that it was popular in Latin American countries, perhaps owing to a history of political repression in the region. \\"It didn't sit too well with American readers, who prefer the soap opera and cool costume aspects of superhero comics. But I became a minor hero in many Latin countries, like Argentina and Mexico, where readers had been subjected to tyranny and fascism and knew precisely what I was writing about.\\" Breyfogle gave a similar explanation for what he believed to be the cause of the series' failure. In an essay written after the cancellation of the series, he reflected on the difficulty of combining escapist entertainment with social commentary: \\"Anarky is a hybrid of the mainstream and the not-quite-so- mainstream. This title may have experienced exactly what every \\"half-breed\\" suffers: rejection by both groups with which it claims identity.\\" Dennis O'Neil, Group Editor for the Batman family of comic books from 1986 to 2000, was at odds with the suggestion that Anarky become the son of the Joker. Despite numerous editorial impositions, the most controversial plot point was not a mandate, but was instead a suggestion by Breyfogle, intended as a means to expand Anarky's characterization: that Anarky's biological father be revealed to be the Joker. Breyfogle expressed an interest using the relationship as a source for internal conflict in the character. \\"... I figured that because Anarky represents the epitome of reason, one of the biggest crises he could face would be to discover that his father was the exact opposite: a raving lunatic!\\" Alternatively, Grant saw it as an opportunity to solidify Anarky's role in the Batman franchise. Grant's decision to pursue the suggestion ran into conflict with Dennis O'Neil, who protested against it. Grant recalled, \\"Denny only let me write that story under protest, he was totally opposed to Joker being Anarky's father and said under no circumstances would DC allow that.\\" Grant persisted, suggesting that the move would generate interest for the comic book, and that the story could be undone later in another story. With O'Neil's permission, the sub-plot of Anarky's unrevealed heritage was published in the series' first issue. With the eventual series cancellation, the final issue was quickly written to reveal the identity of Anarky's father as the Joker, simply to resolve the plot line, and leaving any future rebuttal to a future publications. As the last issue of the Anarky series, the unresolved finale left open the possibility that the Joker might be Anarky's actual father, and the planned \\"rebuttal\\" was never published. Further, Grant and Breyfogle later speculated that as Dennis O'Neil has retired from DC Comics, and the final editorial decision currently belongs to Dan DiDio, it is no longer possible to be sure whether a rebuttal will ever be published. As of 2012, there is yet no record of Didio ever commenting on the subject, though the DC Universe timeline chronologically prevents the Joker from being Anarky's biological father, as the character's birth predates the existence of either Batman or the Joker. As Anarky was created while Grant and Breyfogle were operating under \\"work-for- hire\\" rules, DC Comics owns all rights to the Anarky character. Following the cancellation of the Anarky series, both men attempted to buy the rights to Anarky from the company, but their offer was declined. =2000–2007: Absence from DC publications= After the financial failure of Anarky (vol. 2), the character entered a period of absence from DC publications that lasted several years. Norm Breyfogle attempted to continue using the character in other comics during this time, co-writing an issue of The Spectre with John Marc DeMatteis that would cameo Anarky as a rationalist foil to the mystical nature of the Spectre. When this story was rejected, Breyfogle came to suspect the character's prolonged absence was due in part to censorship. Since the cancellation of the Anarky series, Grant has disassociated himself from the direction of the character. In a 2004 interview he recalled that he had been asked by James Peatty for a critique of an Anarky/Green Arrow script the latter had written. Peatty desired to know if his presentation of Anarky had been correct. Grant declined to read the story, explaining, \\"you have to let these things go\\". The script was published in 2005 and Anarky made the guest appearance billed as his \\"return\\" to DC continuity in Green Arrow #51, \\"Anarky in the USA\\". The story narrative chronicles Anarky's reappearance after several years of obscurity in response to a bombing in Star City that he is framed for. He teams up with the Green Arrow to hunt down the guilty parties, but remains a wanted felon by authorities. Although the front cover of the issue advertised the comic as the \\"return\\" of the character, Anarky failed to make any further appearances. This was despite comments by Peatty that he had further plans to write stories for the character. Among his comments was the suggestion that he intended to explore the cliffhanger of Anarky's parentage left after the cancellation of the original Anarky series, and that as Green Arrow #51 was being published, he had already written a two-part story for Batman which featured Anarky. Besides Breyfogle and Peatty, Todd Seavey was another professional writer who expressed an interest in creating stories for Anarky. A freelance libertarian writer and editor, and author of several issues of Justice League, Seavey considered authoring an Anarky series his \\"dream comics project\\". Breyfogle has also noted that Anarky retained interest among a \\"diehard\\" fan base during this obscure period. During a panel at WonderCon 2006, multiple requests were made by the audience for Anarky to appear in the DC Comics limited series 52. In response, Dan DiDio announced two weeks later, at a DC Comics panel during the 2006 New York Comic Con, that the writing team of 52 had decided to create a part for the character. 52 editor, Michael Siglain, later responded to a reader question concerning when Anarky would appear in the series, estimating Anarky would appear in later issues. However, 52 concluded without Anarky making an appearance and with no explanation given by anyone involved in the production of the series. =2008: Return as \\"Moneyspider\\"= On August 15, 2008, DC Comics announced that Anarky would reappear in the December issue of Robin (vol. 2) #181. Several weeks later, Dan Didio announced that Anarky would be among several villains to be showcased in DC Comic's \\"Faces of Evil\\" event. With the publication of Robin (vol. 2) #181, it was revealed that Lonnie Machin's role as Anarky had been supplanted by another Batman villain, Ulysses Hadrian Armstrong. Further, Machin was depicted as being held hostage by Armstrong, \\"paralyzed and catatonic\\", encased in an iron lung, and connected to computers through his brain. This final feature allowed the character to connect to the Internet and communicate with others via a speech synthesizer. The story, \\"Pushing Buttons, Pulling Strings\\", narrates that as Tim Drake attempts to maintain control of Gotham City in Batman's absence following the \\"Batman R.I.P.\\" storyline, it is revealed that the ultimate foe attempting to foment chaos and destroy the city through gang wars and terrorist bombings is Armstrong. Armstrong is also revealed to have encountered Lonnie Machin at an unspecified point prior to the story, at which time Machin was \\"shot in the head\\", leaving him paralyzed and hostage to Armstrong. Incapacitated, Machin reverts to his hacker identity as \\"Moneyspider\\", while Armstrong commandeers the identity of Anarky and conspires to acquire power through chaos. The storyline concluded with the publication of Robin (vol. 2) #182, on January 21, 2009, as part of the \\"Faces of Evil\\" event. The issue featured the Ulysses Hadrian Armstrong version of Anarky on the front cover of the issue, but did not include Lonnie Machin as a character within the story. Fabian Nicieza's reintroduction of Anarky took the character in a new direction, upsetting some of the character's fans. Fabian Nicieza, author of the issue and storyline in which Anarky appeared, responded to reader concerns in an internet forum for a Q&A; secession with fans a few days after issue #181 was published. Nicieza explained his decision behind giving Machin's mantle as Anarky to another character was due to his desire to establish \\"Robin's Joker\\", and that \\"the concept of Anarky, applied in a visceral, immature fashion, would make an excellent counterpoint to Robin's ordered methodical thinking.\\" However, in an effort to respect the original characterization of Anarky, it was necessary that it not be Machin, who Nicieza recognized as neither immature, nor a villain. Nicieza also noted the difficulty inherent in writing any story featuring Anarky, due to the complexity of the character's philosophy. Regardless, Nicieza did desire to use Machin and properly return the character to publication, and so favored presenting Ulysses H. Armstrong as Anarky, and Lonnie Machin as MoneySpider, describing the latter as an \\"electronic ghost.\\" The alias Moneyspider was a secondary name briefly used by Grant for Anarky in a 1990 Detective Comics storyline. Nicieza felt that this created a scenario in which each could be used for different effects. As he put it, \\"[o]ne can prove a physical opposition to Robin (Ulysses as Anarky), the other an intellectual one (Lonnie as MoneySpider).\\" Nicieza also acknowledged that this dramatic change in the character's presentation would upset fans of the character, but countered that he felt he had not made any changes to the character which could not be undone easily by other writers. Following the publication of Robin (vol. 2) #181, Roderick Long, a political commentator and Senior Scholar at the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and self-professed fan of the character, expressed annoyance at the portrayal of the character of Lonnie Machin and the usurpation of the Anarky mantle by Armstrong. Upon learning of Nicieza's reasoning for the portrayal, Long parodied the explanation as a mock-dialectic, writing, \\"Thesis: Anarky is too interesting a character not to write about. Antithesis: Anarky is too interesting a character for me to write successfully about. Dialectical synthesis: Therefore I will make Anarky less interesting so I can write about him.\\" Grant also commented on the transformation. \\"Someone recently sent me DC's new take on Anarky,\\" Grant reported during an interview for the Scotland regional edition of The Big Issue, \\"and I was saddened to see they were using him as just another asshole villain.\\" Several months later, in a forum discussion, Nicieza once again defended his writing of the story. In a discussion regarding communication between comic book authors, and whether writers were bothered when their creations were altered, or re-characterized, by other authors of a shared universe, Nicieza's treatment of Anarky was criticized. In addressing the concerns of his detractors, Nicieza submitted that he fully agreed with the criticisms by Alan Grant. As Nicieza explained, his intention was to deliberately alter the concept the Anarky mantle represented, while attempting to respect the characterization of Lonnie Machin. For this reason, Nicieza also saw little reason to communicate with Grant for feedback, and so made no overtures to Anarky's creator. Nicieza also confessed to his personal discomfort with communicating with Grant, given the latter's estrangement from DC Comics. Nicieza continued his explanation, tackling the topic of the new \\"misapplication\\" of the philosophical underpinnings of the Anarky mantle in the hands of the General. \\"I was well aware that the General's application of the name, costume and themes were inaccurate to the political philosophy of Anarchy (and of Lonnie's reason for being as Anarky). It's even STATED in print during the course of the story that Ulysses didn't 'get it.'\\" Nicieza then concluded with a restatement in his expectation that other writers now had the opportunity to pursue stories which would make use of the characters, \\"I could understand original Anarky readers and the creator of the character not agreeing with that, but therein lies the beauty of our medium -- there's always another story to tell that could 'fix' what you don't like ...\\" =2009–2011: Red Robin series= With the conclusion of Robin (vol. 2) #182, Nicieza began authoring the 2009 Azrael series, leaving any future use of Anarky or Moneyspider to author Christopher Yost, who would pick up the Robin character in a new Red Robin series. At the 2009 New York Comic Con panel for the \\"Batman: Battle for the Cowl\\" storyline, various collaborating writers, editors, and artists for Batman-related comic books took questions from the audience. When asked a question regarding Anarky, Mike Marts confirmed that \\"Anarky\\" would be utilized in future publications, but did not elaborate further. Yet in the ensuing months, Yost only made one brief references to Anarky, without directly involving the character in a story plot. In April 2010, it was announced that Nicieza would replace Yost as the author of Red Robin, and Nicieza was quick to note his interest in using Anarky and Moneyspider in future issues of the series. Nicieza reintroduced Ulysses Armstrong and Lonnie Machin over the course of several storylines, and regularly used Lonnie as a cast member of the ongoing Red Robin series. Within Nicieza's first storyline, \\"The Hit List\\", Tim Drake rescues Lonnie Machin from the evil Ulysses Armstrong, who escapes capture and still claims the \\"Anarky\\" mantle. Recruiting Lonnie as he recovers from his coma, Drake asks that Machin act as Moneyspider and join him in fighting crime. Tim Drake comes to rely on Machin for his computer wizardry, as well as for his advice and companionship, in issues that follow. In the next story arc, \\"The Rabbit Hole\\", Nicieza reintroduced readers to a concept explored in other DC Universe comic books—the virtual reality realm of the Ünternet. Within the plot, Tim Drake is aided by Machin in hacking the Ünternet, a virtual realm used by criminals as a meeting space and form of entertainment. Once inside, Machin seizes control of the system, where he is returned to a digitized semblance of his former health and reclaims the mantle of \\"Anarky\\" within cyberspace. Uniquely gifted with full control of his bicameral mind, he leaves half of his personality as Anarky online at all times, even as the other half interacts with Drake offline as Moneyspider. Fending off villains within the digital realm with Tim Drake's help, Moneyspider is told to shut down the entire system by Drake. Sensing an opportunity, he pretends to do so, but instead secretly salvages it for himself. With the cancellation of the series five months later, the repercussions of these events were left unexplored. The series was cancelled in October 2011, as a result of The New 52, a revamp and relaunch by DC Comics of its entire line of ongoing monthly superhero comic books, in which all of its existing titles were cancelled. 52 new series debuted in September 2011 with new #1 issues to replace the cancelled titles. =2012–2013: Debuts in animation and video games= At the MIPJunior conference, on October 1, 2011, Sam Register, executive vice president for creative affairs at Warner Bros. Animation, announced several upcoming events for 2012, including a new CGI animated series, Beware the Batman. Intended to focus on lesser known villains for an unfamiliar audience. A Cartoon Network press release announced that Anarky would be one of the planned villains to be included, while series developers later explained that the character would be revamped for the series and chosen as the primary antagonist. Series producers Glen Murakami and Mitch Watson compared his role to that of \\"Moriarty to Batman's Sherlock Holmes\\", explaining that he would indirectly challenge Batman through complex machinations. Anarky debuted in the first season's third episode, \\"Tests\\", on July 27, 2013. The episode was written by Jim Krieg, with direction by Curt Geda, while the character was voiced by Wallace Langham. Scott Thill, technology and pop culture commentator for Wired magazine, has praised the choice to debut Anarky on television, noting the character's relevance following the rise of the Occupy movement and the hacktivist activities of Anonymous. On May 20, 2013, Computer and Video Games's website confirmed that Anarky would make his video game debut in Batman: Arkham Origins. Presenting the first game play demonstration for the game at the 2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo, and providing sit down interviews for media was the creative director of WB Games Montréal, Eric Holmes. Anarky was presented as an example of the new \\"Most Wanted\\" system introduced in the series. The system used guest villains to create mini-quests for players to optionally tackle, adding variety and replay value to the game. The game was released on October 25, 2013. Voiced by Matthew Mercer, Anarky's side-mission involved his placing explosives at corporate and government locations. However, Anarky would not act strictly as a villain, but rather would attempt to appeal to Batman for an alliance. Extra components of the game included a series of invisible \\"Anarky tags\\" hidden throughout the over world map, which upon discovery would provide an essay explaining his critique of social problems; and a pirate radio station, \\"Liberation Radio\\", which the player could listen to as Anarky summarized the history of the 1919 United States anarchist bombings. The actual side mission involved a race against a countdown timer, as the player guided Batman across the city skyline from a starting point to reach the destination. Upon arrival, the player must defeat guards protecting a bomb and then deactivate it before detonation, which commentators compared to a similar side mission in Batman: Arkham City which involved Victor Zsasz. Though aware of the \\"Moneyspider\\" period the character had experienced in the pages of Red Robin, Holmes explained that the developers had primarily drawn upon the earliest stories for Anarky by Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle in Detective Comics. In response to a comment from an interviewer on the contemporary popularity of anarchism, Holmes acknowledged it as a factor in the choice to include the character in the game, and to update his appearance to that of a street protester with a gang resembling a social movement. He also noted the character's resemblance to the masked protesters of Anonymous. According to Holmes, Anarky's relevance to contemporary protest movements was the key element that made Anarky stand out among the characters of the game. \\"In the real world, this is Anarky's moment. Right now. Today.\\" Holmes also warned players unfamiliar with Anarky against investigating the character through published material online, as he felt it would potentially spoil surprises the game held. Alan Grant was later quoted as \\"honoured\\" by the choice to include Anarky in the game, though also \\"slightly peeved\\" that Anarky's character design had been based on what he felt were anarchist stereotypes, \\"complete with Molotov cocktails!\\" He was nonetheless pleased with the way the character was utilized within the game, and remarked that he'd also like to see Anarky used in films. \\"I’d love to see Anarky get even more exposure... though only if the writers handled him properly.\\" =2013: Post-New 52= While Anarky was \\"rising in profile in other media\\" by mid 2013, the character had yet to be reintroduced to the status quo of the Post-New 52 DC Universe. This changed on August 12, when DC Comics announced that Anarky would be reintroduced in Green Lantern Corps #25, \\"Powers That Be\\", on November 13, 2013. The issue was a tie-in to the \\"Batman: Zero Year\\" crossover event, authored by Van Jensen and co-plotted by Robert Venditti. In the lead up to the publication date, at a panel event at the New York Comic Con, Jensen was asked by a fan holding a \\"plush Anarky doll\\" what the character's role would be in the story. Jensen explained that Anarky \\"would have a very big hand\\" in the story, and further explained, \\"you can understand what he's doing even if you don't agree with what he's doing.\\" Jensen had also indicated that his version of Anarky would be a \\"fresh take that also honors his legacy.\\" The story featured a character study of John Stewart, narrating Stewart's final mission as a young Marine in the midst of a Gotham City power blackout and citywide evacuation, mere days before a major storm is to hit the city. Anarky is depicted as rallying a group of followers and evacuees to occupy a sports stadium, on the basis that the area the stadium was built upon was gentrified at the expense of the local community and should be returned to them. The identity of this new version of Anarky was unrevealed, as Anarky escapes capture at the end of the story. The main story sequence is interwoven with flashbacks as Stewart's mother narrates her experiences as a child during the 1967 Detroit riot, forming the basis for the content of his family's character. A review of the storyline embraced two particular additions brought to the revamped version of Anarky; the first being that this new version of Anarky is portrayed as an African American, as Batman has traditionally lacked many black villains; the second choice being to preserve the character's anonymity. To the commentator, this presented the opportunity that this Anarky could also be female. However, while the story had borrowed its characterization and design of Anarky from the version found in Batman: Arkham Origins, it was judged to have simultaneously made the character less threatening. The reviewer drew upon this result to caution the \\"need to reach a happy medium between the disillusioned Occupy Wall Street protester we see here and the super genius kung fu fighting terrorist from Beware the Batman.\\" List of notable media appearances =Comics= As a lesser-known and under-utilized character in the DC Universe, Anarky has a smaller library of associated comic books and significant story lines than more popular DC Comics characters. Between 1989 and 1996, Anarky was primarily written by Alan Grant in Batman-related comics, received a guest appearance in a single issue of Green Arrow by Kevin Dooley, and was given an entry in Who's Who in the DC Universe. In the late 1990s, Anarky entered a brief period of minor prominence; first with the publication of Anarky in 1997; followed in 1998 with the Batman: Anarky collection; and in 1999, with featured appearances in both DCU Heroes Secret Files and Origins #1 and the ongoing series, Anarky (vol. 2). After the cancellation of the ongoing series, Anarky lapsed into obscurity that lasted nearly 10 years. This ambiguous condition was not complete, as Anarky was sporadically used during this time. These appearances include marginal cameos in issues of Young Justice, Wonder Woman, and Green Arrow. Anarky made a controversial appearance in 2008 (in Robin (vol. 2) #177-182) as part of an effort to return the character to regular publication, and became a recurring cast member in the Red Robin series in November 2010, until the series was cancelled in October 2011. * :Comprising the entire \\"Metamorphosis\\" story arc, this 1997 limited series was retroactively labeled the \\"first volume\\" following its continuation in 1999. * :Anarky relocates to Washington, D.C. to wage war against the United States government, in a financially and critically unsuccessful ongoing series. * :Anarky is revamped as \\"Moneyspider\\", a comatose hacker recruited by the eponymous Red Robin to act as a recurring cast member and literary foil in this ongoing series. * :A trade paperback collecting four stories featuring Anarky in various Batman-related comics between 1989 and 1997. * :Anarky's debut appearance in Detective Comics, in which Anarky begins a campaign of revolt in Gotham City. * :Anarky attempts to \\"deprogram\\" humanity of all social constraints in a four-part limited series, revamping Anarky with new abilities and philosophy. * :Anarky seeks the truth of his parentage and learns the Joker may be his father in this controversial final issue of the ongoing Anarky series. * :Robin faces a mysterious figure who promotes gang warfare in Batman's absence in the final story arc of Robin, which reintroduces Lonnie Machin as \\"Moneyspider\\". * :Anarky has rallied a neighborhood against a group of marines, including John Stewart, who are attempting to rescue them in the midst of a Gotham City evacuation, in Anarky's New 52 debut. =Other media= Television =Arrowverse= Lonnie Machin, portrayed by Alexander Calvert, appears in the fourth season of Arrow, depicted as an unhinged former mob enforcer. Described as \\"crazy pants\\", Machin was hired by Damien Darhk to cause chaos in Star City. However, when Darhk fires him for going too far, Machin develops a monomaniac desire to destroy Darhk. This brings him into conflict with Team Arrow, getting burned badly by Speedy during a bout of bloodlust; Machin escapes his ambulance, leaving his symbol behind. Adopting a plastic mask to hide his burns, Machin dubs himself \\"Anarky\\" and begins trying to bring down H.I.V.E. to lure out Darhk to kill him. In addition, he kidnapped his daughter and wife but Lonnie killed Darhk's wife Ruvé Adams. In the season four finale, Anarky attempts to ruin Project Genesis by cutting off the air supply to H.I.V.E.'s bunker. He is stopped by Speedy, revealing herself as Thea Queen to him in the process. In the fifth-season premiere, \\"Legacies\\", Anarky attempts to bomb Star City but is stopped by Green Arrow and arrested. =Animation= * Anarky was considered to be featured in The New Batman Adventures. The producers wanted to cast film director Kevin Smith for the role.http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/sections/backstage/unused/batman/anarky.php *Lesser known among the cast of characters in the DC universe, Anarky went unused for adaptations to other media platforms throughout much of the character's existence. However, in 2012 the character was chosen to act as the main antagonist in Beware the Batman. Anarky debuted in \\"Tests\\", the third episode of the first season, which aired on July 27, 2013. Anarky, voiced by Wallace Langham, is revamped as a criminal mastermind and acts as Batman's primary antagonist in this CGI animated series. He is clad in a white suit with cape and mask opposed to crimson robes and golden mask. Anarky is depicted as obsessed with both chaos and chess, enacting complex plans to battle Batman, who he views as his exact opposite. He later forms an alliance with District Attorney Harvey Dent, as the two both want to take down Batman. Though his plans seemingly work when Deathstroke seemingly kills Batman, Dent, having gone insane after being disfigured, attempts to murder Anarky. Anarky nearly kills Dent in retaliation, but Commissioner Gordon disarms him, and Anarky escapes. In the final scene of the series, Anarky, hiding out in a dilapidated room, compliments Batman for beating him, before announcing he plans to “play again.” Video games * In 2013, Anarky was included as a villain in the Batman video game, Batman: Arkham Origins. Anarky, voiced by Matthew Mercer, is a teenager who leads a movement among the homeless and desperate, setting explosives at government and corporate buildings Batman must deactivate in his video game debut. ** Anarky is also mentioned by characters in dialogue in 2015's Batman: Arkham Knight, which occurs roughly ten years after the events of Arkham Origins. Anarky is mentioned to have disappeared following his capture, and it is heavily implied that the federal government had intervened in his imprisonment and transferred him to a federal prison or someplace else. His trademark vest can be found in the evidence locker, and several thugs mention that Anarky would love the chaos going on in Gotham. * Anarky is among many other DC characters included in Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure.

Following Anarky's debut in \\"Anarky in Gotham City\\", the character's design incorporated the head extender in Robin Annual #1 (1992), Green Arrow #89 (Aug. 1994), and The Batman Adventures #31 (April 1995). The head extender was not included in Shadow of The Bat #18 (Oct. 1993), and The Batman Chronicles #1 (summer 1995). . 52 was promoted as a comic that would attempt to incorporate as many DC Comics characters as possible. In a Q&A; session hosted by Newsarama.com, Michael Siglain answered a series of questions regarding which characters fans wanted to see in the series. Question No. 19 asked \\"We were told Anarky would be playing a part in 52. Could you please tell us when we can expect his appearances?\\" Siglain's simple response to readers was, \\"check back in the late 40s.\\" Speculation centered on the prospect of Anarky appearing in issue No.48 of the series, as the solicited cover illustration was released to the public several weeks before the issues' publication. On the cover, the circle-A could be seen as a minor element in the background. In a review for \\"Week 48\\", Major Spoilers considered the absence of Anarky a drawback: \\"It's too bad we didn't see the return of Anarky as hinted by this week's cover\\" Pop culture critic, Douglas Wolk, wrote, \\"I guess this issue's cover is the closest we're going to get to Anarky after all (and by proxy as close as we're going to get to the Haunted Tank). Too bad.\\" . In warning readers to avoid spoiling potential surprises for their experience in playing Batman: Arkham Origins, Eric Holmes specifically referenced the Wikipedia article on the character as a resource to avoid. \\"You know what? If you want to enjoy the game, don't bother reading up on him, because there are a few surprises about him which will turn up in the game, and if you go read Wikipedia or something like that, it'll rob you a little bit on some of the stuff in the game, because there are some surprises about Anarky.\\" . Anarky is not actually a part of the main story of the game, but is rather featured in several other respects. As part of the \\"Most Wanted\\" game feature, which encourages the player to track down side missions at their leisure, apprehending Anarky unlocks the \\"Anarky\\" character trophy. An \\"Anarky tag\\" collectible feature encourages players to search the city of Gotham map for hidden messages left by Anarky for his followers, earning the player the \\"Voice of the People\\" achievement if completed, and a \\"Liberation Radio\\" broadcast can be heard using Batman's Cryptographic Sequencer tool, which broadcasts Anarky's recitation of the \\"Plain Words\\" flier found during the 1919 United States anarchist bombings. A second collectible feature, Enigma's \\"extortion data files\\" include two for Anarky featuring voice actors performing as a corrupt cop coercing a homeless person to infiltrate Anarky's ranks, and Anarky calling Gordon and informing the latter to leave the city as he does not wish to hurt the officer and believes he can still be \\"rehabilitated\\".

Written by Peter Gould and directed by Adam Bernstein, it originally aired on AMC in the United States on July 29, 2012\\\\. Plot Mike and his attorney spend an entire day visiting his former subordinates in jail. Although the RICO Act has taken all of their money, Mike instructs them not to divulge anything to the DEA, explaining that they will still get their \\"hazard pay\\" due to his new partnership with Walt. Meanwhile, Walt has moved himself back into the house, to Skyler's silent horror. Mike meets with Walt, Jesse, and Saul, where he declares that he will handle the business end of their operation while Walt and Jesse remain cooks. Walt agrees, but still asserts himself as the leader. Saul shows them numerous potential locations for a meth lab, but none are good enough for the trio. While visiting a pest control company, Vamonos Pest, Walt notices a folded fumigation tent. He decides they will establish a mobile lab, never cooking in the same place twice. He explains that no one looks twice at a tented house, and even if the strange smell of a meth cook is emitted, no one would investigate or enter the tent. Saul contacts the pest control team that moonlight as burglars, among them a man named Todd Alquist, who allows Walt and Jesse entrance into the houses they are working on. Old Joe supplies much of the equipment while Badger Mayhew and Skinny Pete purchase large music equipment cases to smuggle the lab from one site to another. Jesse and his girlfriend Andrea invite Walt to dinner, where he feels guilt upon seeing her son Brock, whom he secretly poisoned. Meanwhile, while discussing Walt's upcoming 51st birthday with Marie at the car wash, Skyler begins to light a cigarette. As Marie begins to confront her about smoking, Skyler screams \\"shut up\\" repeatedly and suffers a nervous breakdown. The first cook at the mobile site is a success, and afterwards, Walt feigns enthusiasm for Jesse's relationship with Andrea, but hints that Jesse should break up with her after mentioning the problems it would cause if she discovered his secret life. Marie confronts Walt at home about Skyler's breakdown and demands to know the truth. Walt tells her about Skyler's affair with Ted and that her breakdown was due to stress over his recent accident. After Marie leaves, Walt decides not to attend to Skyler. When she emerges from the bedroom hours later, she finds Walt, Walt Jr., and Holly watching the final scene of Scarface, which further frightens her. Mike allocates the money earned from the first cook, but Walt becomes upset when so much of it is given to dealers, mules, Saul, and Vamonos Pest. Walt becomes further angered when he learns of the hazard pay to Mike's old henchmen, but eventually relents. Walt deduces that the final amount taken home by the partners was less than what he was making when he was working for Gus. Jesse, who reveals that he broke off the relationship with Andrea, tells Walt that he was \\"looking at it wrong.\\" Jesse explains to Walt that under Gus, they were employees, but as owners they were actually making more considering the volume of the output. Walt, however, hints that they may need to get rid of some of the other members of the team.  Reception  =Ratings= The episode was watched by approximately 2.20 million American viewers in its original broadcast, a slight drop from the previous episode. =Critical reception= The episode received positive reviews. Allison Keene of Collider was originally going to rate the episode with a C, but gave it a B for the \\"Skinny Pete scene and the cook montage\\", adding: \\"Introducing Skinny Pete in 'Hazard Pay' with him artfully and flawlessly dancing through a piano melody on a keyboard in the music store was funny, but also deeply sad.\\" She added about the cook: \\"Every season Walt and Jesse seem to find some foolproof place to cook in peace, and I always get a weird sense of calm.

Plot Walter White and Walt Jr. retrieve Walt's Pontiac Aztek from an auto repair shop. The mechanic believes the car will last a long time, but when Walt puts on the hat he dons for his Heisenberg persona, his pride takes over. Walt impulsively sells the Aztek to the mechanic for $50, leases a new Chrysler 300 for himself, and later leases a new Dodge Challenger for Walt Jr. At Madrigal's Houston branch, Lydia Rodarte-Quayle receives a call from Mike Ehrmantraut, who warns her that the police are about to arrive. She escorts Hank Schrader, Steven Gomez, and other officers to the Madrigal warehouse and points out foreman Ron, who was supplying her with methylamine. Mike reassures Lydia that Ron will not talk, adding that she will have a new guy in the warehouse soon. Walt presents Skyler White with a stack of newly-earned drug money, saying they have to recoup the lost $600,000. After her suggestion of sending the kids to boarding school is struck down by Walter, he mentions that she should throw him a party for his 51st birthday. The next day, SAC Ramey offers Hank the position of ASAC (Assistant Special Agent in Charge) vacated by Merkert. Hank accepts, even though his pursuit of Heisenberg will be given to a field agent. That evening, the Whites and the Schraders finish a meager birthday dinner in the backyard — a noticeable shift from the well-attended surprise party one year before. After Walt Jr. leaves, Walt notes that it has been a year since his cancer diagnosis. As he reflects, a fully clothed Skyler steps into the pool and slowly submerges herself. Marie panics while Walt jumps in to pull her out. At the warehouse, Lydia leads Jesse Pinkman to a barrel of methylamine. As Jesse lowers the barrel with a forklift, Lydia points her flashlight at a GPS tracker affixed to the bottom of the barrel, forcing them to leave empty-handed. Back at the house, Walt learns that Skyler has asked Marie and Hank to look after the kids until her issues with Walt are resolved. Walt tentatively agrees though he considers it a temporary arrangement. Skyler insists that she will not have her children living in a house where dangerous events that occur are just shrugged off. She threatens to further harm herself, to fake spousal abuse and to send Walt Jr. to boarding school if Walt brings the kids back home, but he belittles her plans as unworkable. Breaking down and realizing there is no way out of her situation without hurting her family, she relents to his arguments but not without admitting to him that her only option is to hope that Walt's cancer will come back and kill him. The next day at Vamonos Pest, Mike is skeptical that the tracker was planted by the DEA because of its crude placement on the bottom of the barrel. When informed by Jesse that it was Lydia who spotted it first, Mike concludes that Lydia planted it herself in order to get out of their deal and vows to kill her. Jesse pleads for Mike to show mercy and asks for Walt's opinion. Walt votes to keep her alive so no time is lost finding a new precursor supplier. Jesse later gives Walt a TAG Heuer Monaco wristwatch as a birthday present, which pleases Walt. At home, Walt informs a chain-smoking Skyler that more money is coming. He shows off Jesse's gift as proof that Skyler will eventually forgive him, as Jesse once wanted him dead too. Walt goes to bed with time on the watch ticking away.

They prepare another barrel for the boy. While Todd and Jesse are smoking outside, Todd glibly dismisses the tragedy, leading an incensed Jesse to punch him. After a heated debate, Walt, Jesse, and Mike agree to spare Todd's life and keep him on the payroll with Vamonos Pest, in order to monitor him. While visiting a park with his granddaughter, Mike detects a DEA stakeout and taunts them by faking a dead drop and leaving a vulgar message placed under a garbage can. Mike, under pressure from the increased surveillance, and Jesse, still shaken over the boy's death, decide to leave Walt's meth operation and sell their shares of the stolen methylamine to Declan, a Phoenix-based competitor, for $5 million apiece.

Marie mistakenly believes this to be the reason for Skyler's mental anguish. Jesse comes to Walt's house to discreetly discuss the deal offered by Declan. Walt rejects the sale, reasoning that the methylamine is worth $300 million when cooked, and correlating his buyout from Gray Matter Technologies for only $5,000 when the company is now worth well over $2 billion. He admits for the first time that he isn't cooking meth for his family, as his children live elsewhere and his marriage is in shambles.

One of the first female graduates of Oxford University,_, \\"Oxford–Saturday. Degrees for Women\\". Yorkshire Post, 1 November 1920. 9. Dr Williams was instrumental in advancing the field of maternal and child health in developing nations, and in 1948 became the first director of Mother and Child Health (MCH) at the newly created World Health Organization (WHO). She once remarked that \\"if you learn your nutrition from a biochemist, you're not likely to learn how essential it is to blow a baby's nose before expecting him to suck.\\"Stanton, Jennifer (16 July 1992). \\"Obituary: Dr Cicely Williams\\". The Independent UK. Retrieved 28 July 2012. Early life Cicely Delphine Williams was born in Kew Park, Darliston, Westmoreland, Jamaica into a family which had lived there for generations. She was the daughter of James Rowland Williams (1860-1916), and Margaret Emily Caroline Farewell (1862-1953). Her father is said to have remarked, when Cicely was nine years old, that she had better become a lady doctor as she was unlikely to find a husband.Tortello, Rebecca (26 November 2002). \\"Dr Cicely Williams: Jamaica's Gift to the Field for Maternal and Child Health Care 1893–1992\\" .

Archives of Disease in Childhood (hosted by British Medical Journal Online). Retrieved 28 July 2012. She deferred her place at college, as she returned to Jamaica to help her parents after a devastating series of earthquakes and hurricanes. After the death of her father in 1916 Williams, then 23, returned to Oxford and began studying medicine. Williams was one of the first females admitted into the course, only because of the death of male students caused by World War I. Williams qualified from King's College Hospital in 1923, at 31, and worked for two years at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children, in Hackney. It was here that Williams decided to specialise in paediatrics, acknowledging that to be an effective physician she must have first hand knowledge of a child's home environment and background, a notion which would come to define her medical practice. Due to the end of World War I, and the return of male physicians, Williams found it difficult to find a medical position following graduation. She worked for a term in Salonika with Turkish refugees. She completed a course at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) from 1928–9 and afterwards applied to the Colonial Medical Service, and in 1929 was posted to the Gold Coast (present day Ghana). Colonial Medical Service Williams was employed specifically as a \\"Woman Medical Officer\\"- a distinction she disagreed with, not least because it meant she was paid a lower rate than her male counterparts.Stanton, J (May 2012). \\"Listening to the Ga: Cicely Williams' Discovery of Kwashiorkor on the Gold Coast\\". World Public Health Nutrition Association. Retrieved 29 July 2012. Her role on the Gold Coast was to treat acutely ill infants and children, and give advice at a clinic level. Faced with the shocking rate of death and illness in the community, Williams trained nurses to do out-reach visits, and created well-baby visits for the local community. She also began a patient information card system to assist with record keeping. Williams, while supportive of modern medicine and scientific techniques, was one of the few colonial physicians who gave credence to traditional medicine and local knowledge. Williams noted that while the child mortality was high, newborns were not represented nearly as highly as toddlers between two and four years. The repeated presentation of young children with swollen bellies and stick thin limbs who very often died despite treatment, piqued Dr Williams' interest. This condition was often diagnosed as pellagra, a vitamin deficiency, but Williams disagreed, and carried out autopsies on the dead children at great personal risk to herself (there were no antibiotics in colonial Ghana, and she became severely ill with streptococcal haemolysis from a cut during one such procedure). Williams asked the local women what they called this condition, and was told kwashiorkor, which Williams translated as \\"disease of the deposed child\\".Konotey-Ahulu, Felix (14 May 2005). \\"There is nothing mysterious about kwashiorkor\\". British Medical Journal. Retrieved 28 July 2012. Her findings- that the condition was due to a lack of protein in the diets of weanlings after the arrival of a new baby- were published in the Archives of Disease in Childhood in 1933. Her colleagues in the colonies were quick to antagonise her claims, particularly H.S. Stannus, regarded as an expert on African nutritional deficiency, and Williams thus followed up her paper with another, more directly contrasting kwashiorkor and pellagra, published in The Lancet in 1935. This did little to sway the medical opinion, and colonial physicians continued to avoid using the term kwashiorkor, or even acknowledge that it was a distinct condition from pellagra, despite the continued deaths of thousands of children who were being treated for the latter condition. Williams remarked about the ongoing issue \\"These men in Harley Street couldn't believe you unless you wore stripy trousers.\\" Williams felt that kwashiorkor was a disease caused mostly through a lack of knowledge and information, and her desire to combine preventive and curative medicine caused her to clash with her superiors and in 1936, after over seven years of service on the Gold Coast, she was transferred 'in disgrace' to Malaya, to lecture at the University of Singapore.Knutson, Tanja (June 2005). \\"Breastfeeding Pioneer: Cicely Williams\\", LaLeche League International (Asia). Retrieved 26 July 2012. Malaya and World War II In Malaya, Williams found a very different healthcare problem, the mortality of newborn infants was extremely high. She became incensed after learning that companies were employing women dressed as nurses to go to tenement houses and convince new mothers that sweetened condensed milk was a preferable replacement for their own milk. This practise was illegal in England and Europe, but Nestlé were exporting the milk to Malaysia and advertising it as \\"ideal for delicate infants\\". In 1939 Williams was invited to address the Singapore Rotary Club, the chairman of which was also the president of Nestlé, and gave a speech entitled \\"Milk and Murder\\" famously saying: :\\"Misguided propaganda on infant feeding should be punished as the most miserable form of sedition; these deaths should be regarded as murder.\\" Williams oversaw the development and running of a primary health care centre in the province of Trengganu in north-eastern Malaya, and was responsible for 23 other doctors and some 300,000 patients. In 1941 the Japanese invaded, and Williams was forced to trek to Singapore to safety. Shortly after her arrival, Singapore too fell to the Japanese, and she was interned first at the Sime Road camp, and then later taken to Changi gaol with 6000 other prisoners. She was gaoled for three and a half years at Changi, and became one of the camp leaders, a position which lead to her being removed for six months to the Kempe Tai headquarters where she was tortured, starved and kept in cages with dying men. Williams suffered dysentery, beriberi (which left her feet numb for the rest of her life) and when the war was declared over in 1945, she was in hospital near death. On her return to England, Williams wrote a report entitled Nutritional conditions among women and children in internment in the civilian camp, noting that: :\\"20 babies were born, 20 babies were breastfed, 20 babies survived, you can't do better than that\\". Later years In 1948, Williams was made head of the new Maternal and Child Health (MCH) division of the World Health Organization in Geneva, and later transferred back to Malaya to head all maternal and child welfare services in South-East Asia. In 1950, she oversaw the commission of an international survey into kwashiorkor across 10 nations in sub-Saharan Africa. This study found that the condition carried such a health burden that it represented \\"the most serious and widespread nutritional disorder known to medical or nutritional science.\\" In her years with the organisation she lectured and advised on MCH in over 70 countries and was influential in promoting the advantages of local knowledge and resources as key to achieving health and wellness in local communities. Following an outbreak of \\"vomiting sickness\\" in Jamaica in 1951 the Government ordered an investigation \\"to improve child care and investigate the causes of food poisoning\\". Between 1951-1953 Dr. Williams coordinated this research and the results were published.\\"Report on Vomiting Sickness in Jamaica. 1954, 194 pp.\\" This eventually led to the identification of the hypoglycaemic effects of unripe ackee.\\"C H Hassall and K Reyle, West Indies Medical Journal, 1955, 4, 83.\\" From 1953–1955 she was a senior lecturer in Nutrition at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, her alma mater. In 1960 Williams' became Professor of Maternal and Child Services at the American University of Beirut. She stayed for four years, and in her time worked with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) with the Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip. She also worked with at risk communities in Yugoslavia, Tanzania, Cyprus, Ethiopia and Uganda. Awards and legacy In 1968, Dr Williams was made a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (CMG), and introduced to Queen Elizabeth II at a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. The Queen reputedly remarked: \\"I can't remember where you've been.\\" To which Williams replied, \\"Many places.\\" \\"Doing what?\\" asked Her Majesty. With typical modesty, Williams replied, \\"Mostly looking after children.\\"Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia (2002). Retrieved 23 July 2018. In 1986 Dr Williams was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Science from the University of Ghana, for her \\"love, care and devotion to sick children\\" and her citation mentioned that during her time as a colonial physician \\"it became necessary to have the police keep order among the surging patients.\\" Many authors have written of her achievements. In 2005, a Ghanaian physician Felix Konotey-Ahulu, wrote to The Lancet in praise of Dr Williams' ability to identify and acknowledge the social context of diseases such as kwashiorkor, he mentions that her translation of the concept had yet to be bettered almost 70 years later, and commended her for her respect for local traditions, as evidenced by her referring to kwashiorkor by its local name. Another article also recognised her for pioneering the field of maternal and child specific medicine, as during her early days in Ghana, such works was devalued as 'women's work' and outside the realms of proper modern medicine. She took copious photographs and notes cataloguing her time in Ghana, and admired the mothering skills of the native women, remarking that \\"[The baby] is carried about on the mother's back, a position it loves, it sleeps close beside her, it is nourished whenever it cries, and on the whole it does remarkably well on this treatment\\", while traditional British parenting recommended the separation of mothers from their infants whenever possible. The article concludes by recognising Williams' contribution to the field of primary health care, stating that after the war and into the modern day, her views becoming the 'gospel for the next generation'. In writing about Africans of the Gold Coast, Dr Williams noted: \\"compared to the white races, he seems to lack initiative and constructive ideas, although he may be shrewd to judge the attainment of others... he is almost invariably dishonest\\"Carothers, J.C. (1953) \\"The African Mind in Health and Disease: a Study in Ethnopsychiatry\\".

Miranda: Laudivio Zacchia Early life Zacchia was born in 1565 at the Castle of Vezzano, the son of Gaspare Zacchia and Veronica de' Nobili, of the signori of Vezzano. It was not Zacchia's original intention to serve an ecclesiastic life. He originally married Laura Biassa and had a son and a daughter; Felice Zacchia (mother of Cardinal Paolo Emilio Rondinini). However, after his wife died, he left Vezzano and went to Rome to aid his brother, Cardinal Paolo Emilio Zacchia. There he worked in the Roman Curia and later became pro-treasurer of the Apostolic Chamber and later its commissary- general. Ecclesiastic career On 17 August 1605 he was named bishop of Montefiascone, a bishopric which had previously been held by his brother.Catholic Hierarchy: Laudivio Cardinal Zacchia Both undertook works on the cathedral there. During the papacy of Pope Paul V, Zacchia was named vice- legate in Viterbo and vice-legate of the province of the Patrimony. Pope Gregory XV appointed Zacchia as nuncio to Venice, where he served from 1621 until December 1623.Achille Gennarelli, \\"Istruzione al vescovo di Montefiascone che nel 1621 recavasi nunzio a Venezia,\\" Archivio storico italiano, nuova serie, Vol. 7 (1858), pp. 3-35. In 1626, Pope Urban VIII made him a cardinal in the consistory of 19 January 1626 and he was named cardinal- priest at San Sisto Vecchio the following month, then opted for the title of San Pietro in Vincoli in 1629. Between 1631 and his death in 1637, Zacchia was named crown-cardinal of the Republic of Genoa. Zacchia was one of three cardinals who did not subscribe to the condemnation of Galileo in 1633. Bid to remove Pope Urban VIII According to his contemporary John Bargrave, in 1636 members of the Spanish faction of the College of Cardinals were so horrified by the conduct of Pope Urban VIII that they conspired to have him arrested and imprisoned (or killed) so that they could replace him with a new pope; namely Zacchia.Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals by John Bargrave, edited by James Craigie Robertson (reprint; 2009)Note: Bargrave describes Zacchia as the uncle of Paolo Emilio Rondinini when in fact the younger cardinal was his grandson. When Urban travelled to Castel Gandolfo to rest, the members of the Spanish faction met in secret and discussed ways to progress their plan. But they were discovered and the pope raced back to Rome where he immediately held a consistory and demanded to know who the new pope was. To put an end to the conspiracy, the pope decreed that all cardinal- bishops should leave Rome and return to their own churches. As it was, Zacchia died the following year, in 1637, and was buried in the chapel of Saint Domenico at the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome.

The main purpose of the facility is to provide farm irrigation, and the size of Crawford Reservoir changes significantly with the seasons. In most years, the lake is full in late Spring and early Summer, but by early Fall, the water level drops enough to leave boat launches high and dry. The low water pool lasts through the Winter until Spring runoff begins to fill the water supply once again.

Ligero (pronounced \\"lee-HAIR-oh\\") is a type of tobacco leaf found near the top of each tobacco plant. Slower to mature than the seco and viso leaves found at the middle of the plant or the easy-burning volado leaves at the bottom, ligero leaves are characterized by a coarse texture and produce smoke with a potent, spicy taste. Ligero leaf is selected for the manufacture of heavy, full-bodied cigars, being rolled at the very center of the filler bundle owing to its slow-burning nature. Description While the variety of tobacco, climate, and soil type affect the strength and flavor of tobacco smoke, another key variable is the part of the plant from which the leaves are harvested.David Savona, \\"The Power Train: Strong Cigars Fuel the Industry's Hottest Trend, But Are They for Everyone?\\" Cigar Aficionado, vol. 10, no. 2 (February 2002), pg. 150.

Personality Plus =Personality groups= *Powerful Cholerics are considered to be leader and commander types, being dominant, strong, decisive, and occasionally arrogant. They tend to be good leaders because they are driven to get things done, however they might offend some people along the way. Cholerics are also known as the \\"Powerful\\" type. *Perfect Melancholy personality types are described by Littauer to be the mental types, with their personality displaying a strong emphasis on thinking, evaluation, and assessment. Their typical behavior involves thinking, assessing, making lists, evaluating the positives and negatives, and general analysis of facts. They love maps, charts and graphs. They are usually the most intelligent of the four types, however they tend to dwell on details. A Melancholy is a planner, making sure things happen, although sometimes they can paralyze themselves with over-analysis. Lists and \\"doing things the right way\\" are characteristics of this personality type. Melancholies are also known as the \\"Perfect\\" type. *Popular Sanguines are a social personality type, displaying characteristics such as a predisposition to socialize and entertain. They enjoy fun, socializing, chatting, telling stories - and are fond of promising the world, because that is the friendly thing to do. A Sanguine gets on well with people and can get others excited about issues, but cannot always be relied upon to get things done. They love interacting with others and play the role of the entertainer or center of attention in group interactions. They have a tendency to over-promise and under-deliver. Sanguines are also known as the \\"Popular\\" type. *Peaceful Phlegmatics are described as having a flat-type personality, being laid back and desiring a peaceful environment above all else. They are easy going, laid back, nonchalant, unexcitable and relaxed. Desiring a quiet and peaceful environment above all else. They tend not to actively upset people, but their indifference may frustrate people. They try not to make decisions, and generally go for the status quo. They are good as mediators because they do not usually have many enemies. They also have a \\"dry\\" and quick sense of humor. Phlegmatics are also known as the \\"Peaceful\\" type. None of these types is specifically described as being positive or negative - hence the combination of positive and negative adjectives (i.e. \\"Powerful\\" with \\"Choleric\\"). They each have upsides and downsides. The characteristics are for observing and identifying, rather than judging.

It was built in the late Art Deco period in 1942. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The Brauntex Theatre first opened in downtown New Braunfels in January 1942. Pearl Harbor had just been attacked, and the United States was at war. Patrons needed a place where they could attempt to ease their worry of loved ones in the war and catch up on the status of the war. It premiered with \\"The Birth of the Blues\\", starring Bing Crosby. At the time there were many other operational theaters in the city, but when the state-of- the-art Brauntex Theatre opened, it was the best. A major fire in one of the other downtown theaters, the Palace, either just before or just after the Brauntex opened, made the new theater an even more welcome addition to the city. The Griffith Company owned the theater. Its design was copied from an earlier Griffith theater in New Cordell, Oklahoma, the Washita Theater. The old theater was an important part of downtown New Braunfels for fifty years. Many members of the staff recalls many highlights of the early movie operations such as the time that Pedro Gonzalez appeared while filming the John Wayne classic, The Alamo. The theater was integrated during the 1960s. After integration patrons could sit anywhere in the theater; 40 cents upstairs or 50 cents downstairs. =Renovation= Slowly over time this once grand establishment with smartly dressed ushers and a bright neon sign became a ghost of years past. Through the dust one could still see the gilded fittings of the Brauntex, but the seats were broken and the theater reeked of cigarette smoke. In September 1998 a local group of city and county officials, artists, engineers, an attorney, a performing arts technician, bank officials and many other concerned citizens, came together to try to save this once great theater. This plan soon grew and the whole city was eager to save this beauty. This group of 36 diverse participants had meetings, brainstorming the needs of the building as well as its potential uses. Out of this the committee decided to mold this run-down movie palace into a full-scale theater which was to be run by the Brauntex Performing Arts Theatre Association. The plan had to be set aside due to the October 1998 Central Texas floods. When the city of New Braunfels had recovered, the plan to renovate the Brauntex was put back into place. In July 1999 corporate non-profit status was acquired, the Association elected officers and directors and contracted a management consultment and a grant writer. On August 31, 1999 the earnest money contract was signed and on December 10, 1999 the Association became proud owners of the dilapidated gem, the Brauntex Theatre. Almost immediately after the Association acquired the property, renovation begun. Plans were drawn, ideas were submitted, and money was raised to give this structure a much needed face-lift. One of the first tasks the Association had was expanding the tiny movie theater stage, into a large performing arts stage. The other major structural change was to restore the balcony to its former glory, as the previous owner had closed it off to create a second theater. The renovation crew included many different local groups who volunteered to overhaul the theatre, including the USMC Junior ROTC from New Braunfels High School. a group of women, who dubbed themselves as the Brauntex Sweatshop, had to sew 600 seat covers alone. The renovation was completed quickly and the grand reopening of the Brauntex Theatre had the San Antonio Symphony grace their stage. The opening night was sold out and was a huge and grand success for this once great movie palace.

Retrieved 07-30-2012 Reception =Critical reception= Philbert Ortiz Dy of ClickTheCity gave the film a favorable review. He states that,\\"...I have to admit I’m a little astounded by This Guy’s In Love with U, Mare. The sexual politics of the film are really intriguing, and surprisingly progressive for a mainstream release. The film depicts relationships that go far beyond the hetero-normative ideals usually portrayed in mainstream cinema. The movie has plenty of fun with gender roles, confounding larger ideas about what it means to be straight or gay in a modern society. It ends up making a case for a more fluid form of sexuality, one that isn’t limited by prejudices towards femininity or masculinity.\\". He also cite some bad sides of the film stating, \\"...Some of the elements of the formula are still kind of annoying[...]The premise is a little hacky, and the comedy gets old really fast[...]is a lot less pleasing. The comedy still feels stale. Laughs are mostly generated through sped up footage, making fun of people for being ugly and word-for-word recitations of dramatic scenes from other movies. Some of the gags are stretched out for far too long, and that extends the film’s runtime\\". Mark Angelo Ching of PEP.ph stated his review through his personal website. He stated that \\"What makes this movie okay is the abundance of smart jokes. There are many sight gags and hidden jokes in many scenes that are played with no hard effort[...] Vice's best scenes happen in the first half, when he's on a revenge streak. When he calms down and the movie gets dramatic, the film gets boring.\\" The other lead characters, on the other hand, deliver shaky performances. Toni Gonzaga portrays her character to be smart, but then she fails to see Lester's true intent. Luis Manzano plays his character dumb at times, and smart at times, it gets confusing what is right. In fairness, this may not be the two actors' fault, but the director's. A review from Twitch Film gave the film a poor rating. Ogg Cruz stated, \\"It is what it is, a disposable piece of entertainment that does not have the will or courage to reinvent the wheel. As a product of commerce, the film understandably insists on being merely lightweight, parading characters that are mere two-dimensional sketches with either a skewed or an overly simplistic understanding of gender roles and morality. The film manages to be funny within the very same framework that all comedies about self-deprecating gays are funny[...]While it is apparent that there are attempts to blur the borders between genders and relationships, it unfortunately misses the opportunity to actually create discourse out of its premise, to graduate from the decades-old subgenre.\\" Skilty Labastilla of the Young Critics Circle Film Desk, on the other hand, lambasted the film, saying that the film is \\"shrill, unfunny, and disturbing\\". He adds, \\"the film’s bigger sins, in my opinion, has little to do with its filmmaking and everything to with its peddling of disturbing messages: 1) To be a real man, one has to be physically violent., 2) Making fun of people whose looks do not meet society’s standards of beauty is completely OK., and 3) Gay men will lust after every young man they see.\\" =Box-office= According to Mico Del Rosario, advertising and promotion manager for Star Cinema, the movie grosses PHP 23 Million on its opening day.

Depictions of Muhammad have inspired considerable controversy and censorship. Some Islamic societies have religious police, who enforce the application of Islamic Sharia law. In non-Islamic countries, Islam has often been cited as a reason for self-censorship. Sometimes this self-censorship is because of threats of violence. Leaders of the member states of the world's largest Islamic organization, known as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), called for a categorical ban on anything that could be deemed as denigration of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in 2012.  Calls for a global ban of criticism of Muhammad  The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the world's second largest intergovernmental organization, comprising fifty-seven Islamic states, has actively lobbied for a global ban on what it perceives as anti-Islamic blasphemy, especially after the publication of Innocence of Muslims — a \\"low- quality film\\" depicting Muhammad as a madman, philanderer, and paedophile, — triggered protests and demonstrations in over a dozen Islamic countries. The OIC actions constituted a major step to criminalize speech critical of religion. Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu, a Turkish citizen and the Secretary General of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, also called for a ban on insults against the Islamic prophet. He said, \\"If the Western world fails to understand the sensitivity of the Muslim world, then we are in trouble\\". He asserted provocative insults are \\"a threat to international peace and security and the sanctity of life.\\" However, the opposition from Western nations barred the resolution from being accepted. Ihsanoglu said, \\"We could not convince them, [..] The European countries don't vote with us, the United States doesn't vote with us.\\"  Censorship measures in the Islamic world  = Afghanistan = The Taliban, which ruled Afghanistan after the mid-1990s, had the most strict, deeply enforced Islamic censorship of any other government in the Muslim World. They enforced and imposed a blanket ban on all films and videos. The Taliban fully fell in 2002 and Afghan President Hamid Karzai's administration began, with expectations of a move towards more secular policies. However, Karzai has worked with members of the Islamic Council of Scholars to censor television programs regarded as sinful, particularly those created by the Indian entertainment industry (many Afghan Islamists often euphemistically refer to Hindus in said industry as \\"worshipers of graven idols\\"). One of Afghanistan's most popular television soap operas, Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi,Note that no exact English language translation exists of the title, but it has been described as: Because the Mother-in-law Was Once a Daughter-in-law Too. has faced threats of a total banning from the country unless the shows were heavily modified. Azim Roboti, director of the Kabul company 'Caravan Film', has remarked about Islamic censorship, = Algeria = During the Algerian civil war in the 1990s, at least 60 journalists were killed by Islamists.Entre menace, censure et liberté: La presse privé algérienne se bat pour survivre , March 31, 1998 = Bangladesh = Several books of the Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin have been banned in Bangladesh, including her novel Lajja. Militant Islamist groups announced a bounty on Nasreen's head and in October 2002, a court sentenced Nasreen in absentia to a year in jail for her \\"derogatory remarks about Islam.\\"\\"Taslima's Banned Books\\" . Retrieved 14 November 2013.Bangladesh Seeks Writer, Charging She Insults Islam The New York Times, June 8, 1994.Book Review The New York Times, August 28, 1994. = Egypt = Hosni Mubarak implemented Islamic censorship as part of his outreach to anti-regime Islamists in the 1980s. The government of Egypt, during the modern era, used a fundamentally secular legal code that went back decades. In 1985, Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak and the National Assembly revised that code in order to try and take some of the heat off of Islamist anti-regime activists such as those in the Muslim Brotherhood by co- opting some of the Islamists' demands. Systematic Islamic censorship on the nation's media began at the same time as the imposition of religious education in state schools. The government's Ministry of Culture typically worked with the Islamic Research Council, based out of Al-Azhar University, to implement Islamic censorship of the nation's film industry. For example, Youssef Chahine, one of the most popular Egyptian filmmakers in history, had the distribution of his successful 1994 work The Emigrant ended when the Council objected to a character's portrayal of the religious figure Joseph. Chahine sued and won, ensuring further showings of his film and showing the sometimes inconsistent nature of Egyptian censorship. Egyptian films of the nation's classic cinema period often depict all sorts of physical affection such as kisses and hugging, and said films receive frequent play on the state-owned Egyptian Television Network. In the aftermath of the Arab Spring toppling of Mubarak's government, some conservative Islamists in Egypt's parliament have worked for a comprehensive censorship law banning such displays. Many Egyptians have expressed concerns about increasing Islamic censorship harming the nation's entertainment industries. Although both secular and Islamic censorship has existed, widespread use of the internet, physical distribution of DVDs, and so on has broadly allowed a large variety of arts and media access. Those measures have not kept Cairo from being regarded as the largest arts and media publishing hub in the Middle East. A coalition of participants in the Egyptian art world formed the 'Egyptian Creativity Front' to oppose Islamic censorship by the ruling Muslim Brotherhood, using the slogan \\"Long Live Free Art\\". The government has used article 44 of the new Egyptian Constitution as justification for their measures, which states \\"insult or abuse of all religious messengers and prophets shall be prohibited\\". = Iran = Mahmoud Ahmadinejad tightened Islamic censorship of his nation's media after his election. The Shah's government eschewed Islamic censorship, with popular commercial films featuring frank sexual themes and even nudity. The regime largely concerned itself with fostering feelings of legitimacy and making sure that films always portrayed it in a positive light. The Shah personally intervened in a 1934 film biopic to make sure that the protagonist, the poet Firdawsi, viewed the ruler character as a patron of the arts. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, members of the 1979 Revolution sought to use film and other measures to shift public opinion's against the Shah's regime and, upon taking power, utilized filmmakers for ideological support. In some circumstances, this meant more rights than under the Shah such as use of minority dialects by characters. However, the Islamic government has strictly regulated films in order to suppress messages perceived as un-Islamic, using religious bureaucracies such as the Council of Screenplay Inspection and the Council of Film Reviewing to alter and delete specific lines and scenes against filmmaker's wishes. In particular, the government forbids the depiction of women either singing, dancing, or both. Actresses also must conceal their hair at all times, even in moments when the characters are shown alone in their own homes. Censors suppress the showing of direct physical contact between members of the opposite sex. Despite this tradition of censorship, some officials have relaxed implementation of Islamic standards, particularly since the death of Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989 (which resulted in the film Two Women by Tahmineh Milani being un-banned before receiving widespread public acclaim). Iran's government, through the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, reviews written works before allowing authors to be published. This process tends to involve having three separate officials inspect works for offending words and phrases, which can take several months to years before approval is granted. Authors with banned works include Plato, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, James Joyce, Kurt Vonnegut, and Paulo Coelho. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has publicly attacked the impact of \\"harmful books\\" on his nation, analogizing them with \\"poisonous\\" drugs. Iranian censorship of books grew stricter after then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's administration began in 2005. His government authorized booksellers to distribute Memoria de mis putas tristesNote that the Spanish-language title has translations such as Memories of My Melancholy Sweethearts and Memories of My Melancholy Whores (the latter being widely used). by Nobel-prize winning author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, which had the five-thousand first edition sell out in short notice, but it reversed course and banned further reprinting. Muslim religious conservatives objected to the story's plot, which describes an isolated ninety-year-old man seeking a night of \\"wild love\\" with an adolescent prostitute. = Iraq = Censorship for both socio-political and religious justifications, intertwined, was widespread in Iraq's government in the 20th century. In particular, the Iraqi Law on the Censorship of Foreign Films of 1973 banned the showing of anything with \\"the propagation of reactionary, chauvinistic, populistic, racialist or regionist ideas, of favouring the spirit of defeatism, serving imperialism and Zionism\\", prohibiting as well anything \\"defaming the Arab nation and its goals\\". Iraq's government effectively had the ability to ban any film for any reason whatsoever at any notice. = Malaysia = In 2006 alone, 56 publications were banned by the Internal Security Ministry, including the Indonesian translation of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species.2006 List of banned publications . Malaysian Ministry of Internal Security. In January 2014, an image of pigs was censored in the Malaysian edition of the International New York Times, with the pig's faces blacked out. = Maldives = In November 2011, the blog of journalist Ismail Khilath Rasheed was shut down by Communications Authority of the Maldives (CAM) on the order of the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, on the grounds that the site contained \\"anti-Islamic material\\". Rasheed, a self-professed Sufi Muslim, had argued for greater religious tolerance. = Pakistan = The government of Pakistan maintains strict censorship of its citizens' access to the internet, with the Ministry of Information Technology's sub-agency the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority monitoring and filtering a variety of websites accused of playing host to perceived anti-Islamic content. Examples of cautioned websites include Google, Yahoo, Bing, YouTube, Hotmail, MSN, and Amazon. The government banned access to Facebook outright for two months in mid-2010 after the controversial page titled \\"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\\" received public attention. These measures have partially contributed to underlying tensions between the Pakistani government and the U.S. government, with many of the aforementioned websites being American-owned. = Saudi Arabia = The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has, in the words of the International Business Times, \\"resorted to drastic measures to limit free communication within its own borders.\\" The administration blocks hundreds of thousands of websites for having content perceived as immoral. Censorship has grown more strict since the 'Arab Spring' revolutions began in early 2011. = Tunisia = In one well-publicized instance of Islamic censorship, the government of Tunisia fined Nabil Karoui, owner of Tunis-based company Nessma TV, about $1,700 in May 2012 for airing the controversial film Persepolis. Said film includes a scene depicting Allah directly along with other disputed material. The government's ruling blasted Karoui for what it viewed as \\"broadcasting a film that disturbs public order and threatens proper morals\\". = Uzbekistan = Islam Karimov, the President of Uzbekistan, has implemented a degree of Islamic censorship over the nation's media, such as banning advertisements for alcohol or tobacco products. Those measures have been a part of a general plan of religious administration that has included running religious programming on state television, federally funding the building of mosques and the restorations of shrines, and the promotion of the official government muftiyat to smooth connections between the state and Islamic believers.  Censorship in non-Islamic countries  Al-Bīrūnī, depicting Muhammad at the Farewell Pilgrimage. This image was the subject of a 2008 petition to have it removed from Wikipedia. Several examples exist of incidences of self-censorship in non-Islamic countries. = Denmark = After 12 editorial cartoons, most of which depicted the Islamic prophet Muhammad, were published in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten on 30 September 2005, Muslim groups in Denmark complained, and the issue eventually led to protests in many countries around the world, which included violent demonstrations and riots in some Islamic countries. According to The New York Times, many of the demonstrations eventually turned violent, resulting in \\"at least 200 deaths\\" globally. Several death threats and reward offers for killing those responsible for the cartoons were made, resulting in the cartoonists going into hiding.TimesOnline: Danish cartoonists fear for their lives = Netherlands = Dutch film director Theo Van Gogh received death threats for making a film about the treatment of Muslim women by other Muslims, titled Submission and was eventually murdered in 2004 by an Islamic radical in retribution. A letter pinned to Van Gogh's body with a knife was a death threat to Ayaan Hirsi Ali who provided the script and the voice-over for the film.\\"Controversial filmmaker shot dead\\". independent.co.uk = The United States = The makers of the television series South Park were mired in controversy for satirizing issues surrounding the depiction of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. The website for the organization Revolution Muslim, a New York-based radical Muslim organization, posted an entry that included a warning to creators Parker and Stone that they risk violent retribution for their depictions of Muhammad. It said that they \\"will probably wind up like Theo Van Gogh for airing this show.\\" This caused the network Comedy Central to censor the episodes. When an anti-Islamic film trailer titled Innocence of Muslims was uploaded to YouTube, it was perceived as denigration of the prophet Muhammad and it culminated in demonstrations and violent protests against the video. The protests have led to hundreds of injuries and over 50 deaths.Protests Against Depictions of Muhammad retrieved 1 October 2012 Fatwas have been issued against the video's participants and a Pakistani minister has offered a bounty for the killing of the producer Nakoula.issued by Muslim cleric against participants in an anti- Islamic film retrieved 1 October 2012Issues Fatwa Against 'Innocence Of Muslims' Makers retrieved 1 October 2012cleric issues fatwa against 'Innocence of Muslims' cast retrieved 1 October 2012US condemns Pakistan minister's bounty retrieved 1 October 2012 The film has sparked debates about freedom of speech and internet censorship.Innocence of Muslims be censored? retrieved 3 October 2012 YouTube itself was blocked in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Sudan and Pakistan for not removing the video.Rory Mulholland, Fresh protests as prophet cartoons fuel Muslim fury, AFP.YouTube links to anti-Islam film blocked in Jordan Government authorities in Chechnya and Daghestan have issued orders to internet providers to block YouTube and Iran has announced that it is blocking Google and Gmail. In 2012 a request by White House was extended towards Google to reconsider the anti-Islam video in light of the violent protests in the Arab world and its rules banning hate speech on Google-owned YouTube, but Google didn't comply. In 2008, Random House cancelled publication of Sherry Jones' The Jewel of Medina — a work of historical fiction focusing upon the life of 'Ā'ishah bint Abī Bakr, first wife of the Islamic prophet Muhammad — due to claims that the novel \\"made fun of Muslims and their history,\\" and thus raised \\"a very real possibility of major danger for the building and staff and widespread violence\\" or even stood to create \\"a national security issue\\". Eventually, the novel saw publication in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth by Gibson Square, and in the United States by Beaufort Books. = India = Although India's constitution protects freedom of speech as a fundamental right, it allows for \\"reasonable restrictions\\" in the interests of \\"public order, decency or morality\\". * In 1989, India became the second country, after Singapore, to ban Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses for its purported attacks on Islam.\\"Rushdie 'hurt' by India ban \\", BBC News, 10 October 1998.

Early life Durazzo was born 5 August 1594 in Multedo, near Genoa, the seventh son of Pietro Durazzo and Aurelia Saluzzo. He belonged to the Durazzo family, one of new emerging families of the Republic of Genoa which had entered on the corporation (albergo) of the House of Grimaldi. His grandfather Giacomo had been Doge of Genoa from 1573 to 1575. Also his father Pietro was Doge from 1619 to 1621, as well as his brother Cesare (from 1665 to 1667) and his nephew Pietro (from 1685-1687). Another of his nephews, Marcello Durazzo, became a cardinal in 1686. Stefano Durazzo was destined to the ecclesiastic life and he was sent to Rome in 1611. In 1618 he was ordained priest and he completed his studies earning a doctorate in utroque iure on about 1620. Durazzo took up a career in the administration of the Papal States: in 1621 he became referendary of the Tribunals of the Apostolic Signature thanks to the support of the seven cardinals of the Republic of Genoa. He purchased the title of clerk of the Apostolic Chamber in 1623, and in 1624 he became Prefect of the Annona with the responsibility for the grain supply to the city of Rome, a duty he accomplished with success during a period of famine organizing shipments of grain from Sicily. In 1627 Durazzo became treasurer-general of the Apostolic Chamber in 1627 and held that position until 1633 before being appointed pro-secretary of the Apostolic Chamber in 1634. Cardinal Stefano Durazzo was created cardinal Priest on 28 November 1633 with the title of San Lorenzo in Panisperna. On 11 October 1666 he gained the title of San Lorenzo in Lucina. On May 1634 he was appointed Papal legate (governor) of Ferrara. His government of Ferrara had not particular issues: he renewed the sewage pipes of the town, built a channel and a fortification in Comacchio and used 4000 ecus of him to buy grain during a famine: such money was given for the town as a loan not as charity. He had a conflict with the bishop of the town Cardinal Lorenzo Magalotti over some rights on the church of San Lorenzo. During his stay in Ferrara, on 5 March 1635, Durazzo was appointed Archbishop of Genoa. The Episcopal consecration followed on 22 April in the Cathedral of Ferrara by the hands of Cardinal Lorenzo Magalotti. He was requested to remain in Ferrara and he left for Genoa only on 22 October 1637. His government of the Archdiocese of Genoa was from the very beginning marked by his conflicts with the aristocracy, represented by the Senate of the Republic, and also with a large portion of the clergy . In particular Durazzo opposed the claim of the Doge to receive regal honors, disputed with the Senate over the control of hospitals, and ordered to the clergy the mandatory use of clerical clothing. His main achievement as archbishop was the founding of the seminary. To support such institution he ordered a particular tax on the revenues of the ecclesiastic benefices which made him unpopular among the clergy. He also ordered that the admission to the seminary was to be decided by the Church only without any interference by the Senate. Durazzo also conducted mercantile business in addition to his ecclesiastic work. Another important reason of his conflict with the ancient aristocracy of the town was his subtle pro-France attitude which he shared with Pope Urban VIII, who made him cardinal, and with the Barberini family. Between June 1640 and November 1642 he was appointed Legate in Bologna which he ruled with his usual authoritative way of acting. During the First War of Castro he closed the doors of Bologna and did not attack the army of Odoardo Farnese, saving the town but actually opposing the Barberini and the pope. Returned in Genoa, he celebrated a synod in April 1643 which resulted in a turn of the screw against the laxity of the clergy. In 1645 was reached an agreement with the Senate over the main issue of etiquette, but the conflicts continued and became stronger and stronger. The Senate asked many times to the Pope to remove Durazzo, who moved to Rome from 1659 to 1661, and again from 1662. In October 1664 Stefano Durazzo finally resigned as Archbishop of Genoa. Durazzo participated in the conclave of 1644 which elected Pope Innocent X, the conclave of 1655 which elected Pope Alexander VII and the conclave of 1667 which elected Pope Clement IX. He died in Rome on 11 July 1667 and was buried in the church of S. Maria in Monterone. His remains were later transferred to Genoa.

The earliest known women's football match involving the French was a women's French team versus the Dick, Kerr's Ladies team from Preston, played at Goodison Park, Liverpool on Boxing Day 1920, attracted a crowd of 53,000 with another 10–15,000 reportedly turned away because the ground was full. Although popular amongst girls, many experience prejudice and discrimination. National competition Division 1 Féminine was created in 1918 and placed under the aegis of the Fédération des Sociétés Féminines Sportives de France (FSFSF), a women's football organization led by pioneer Alice Milliat. The competition was organized for fourteen consecutive years until in 1932 female football was banned. In 1975 the women's football was officially rehabilitated and Division 1 Féminine returned to be organized thanks to the funds made available by the Fédération Française de Football (FFF). With the 2009-2010 season it went to professionalism, being the contracts previously signed semi- professional. Until the 1991–92 season, the championship included a first group stage followed by a direct elimination phase with a final to decree the winning team of the title. Starting from the 1992–93 season he went to an Italian group with round and back bets. Over the years there has been an alternation between the winning teams of the championship. In the 1970s, the Stade de Reims won the first three championships and in all five titles over eight years, from 1974 to 1982. The 1980s saw the dominance of the VGA Saint- Maur, able to win six titles between 1983 and 1990, four consecutive years between 1985 and 1988.

The band started out in the mid 1990s and became very popular throughout Rio Grande do Sul competing with bands in the same genre such as Tchê Barbaridade. The band briefly became successful nationally and appeared on national television. To broaden their appeal, they reworked their music to be more pop-oriented and not have as much of a gaucho sound from instruments such as the accordion. The band also changed their style by wearing normal street clothing on their album covers instead of traditional gaucho garb. The band continued to exist in the early 2000s with some new members and the original lead singer/song writer, but soon disbanded in the middle of the decade.

Wooldridge owned the Parakylia lease that he had established and then sold the western portion and kept the balance himself and renamed as Arcoona. The neighbouring properties are Wirraminna to the south and Andamooka Station to the north. The pastoralist James Gemmell who had been managing Mundi Mundi Station left to take over Arcoona in 1893. The horse Discussion by Light Artillery from Small Talk was bought in 1906 and sent to Arcoona to stud. Richardson paid 190 guineas for the sire. It was sold in 1909 by Messrs. Richardson and Gemmell to John Pick of Terowie, who would be elected to the House of Assembly while at Arcoona. At the time the station was stocked with 12,000 sheep, 600 cattle, 250 horses and 7 camels. Although Arcoona has an arid climate it is occasionally inundated with rain, in 1919 Mr J. H. Mules reported of rain falling and the lake filling fast, and again on New Year's Day in 1921 of rain fell. Pick sold Arcoona in 1920 and bought Coondambo Station in May 1920 for £37,200. The station was restocked in 1930 with 2,000 ewes being delivered from the Matakanna district. Following a great season in 1938 the percentage of lambing was excellent with 6,637 lambs produced from 6,977 ewes. The 1942 season was fairly dry but some patchy rains provided enough feed for the sheep to graze on but not enough to fill any surface tanks. At this time the station was owned by Arcoona Pastoral Co. of which Mr. R. J. McEwin was a partner. During the drought of 1944–1945 stock numbers were very low. The station was sold once again in 1947, for an undisclosed price believed to be in excess of £75,000 on account of J. E. Pick to Kidman Estates of Adelaide. At the time the area of the property was and had an estimated flock of 25,000 sheep. The station had also received heavier than normal rainfall over the last year and all the creeks were flowing and lakes were full to capacity. In 2003 the station was selected by the then federal Science Minister, Peter McGauran, as a low level nuclear waste dump. The site was chosen as it had better security, a less environmentally sensitive access route and more saline water which has no pastoral use. About of radioactive waste generated each year in Australia would be stored in an underground repository. The plan was abandoned in 2004, following legal action from the then owners, the Polke family, as well as opposition from the state government and traditional owners. In 2008 the property was acquired by the Handbury family who also owned Collinsville Station. The property occupied an area of and was managed by Andrew Willis. The property was running a flock of about 20,000 sheep as well as 100 shorthorn cattle.

However, the two federations scrapped the BeNe League after the 2014–15 season, with the KNVB choosing to reactivate the women's Eredivisie with the same seven clubs that had formed the Dutch contingent in the final season of the joint league. The Eredivisie has since expanded to nine teams. UEFA Women's Euro 2017 was hosted in the Netherlands.

Education Abraham Nitzan was born in Tel Aviv. He received his bachelor's degree in Chemistry from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in 1964, and his master's degree in physical chemistry from the same institute in 1966. His research towards the master's degree, on the radiation chemistry of aqueous solutions, was supervised by Gideon Czapski. During the period 1966-1969 he served in the Israel Defense Forces and in 1972 completed his Ph.D. studies at Tel Aviv University under the supervision of Joshua Jortner. His thesis focused on the theory of non- radiative transitions in large molecules. Professional career In the years 1972-1974, Nitzan worked as a research fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The following year he stayed at Northwestern University, after which he returned to Israel and joined the faculty of the chemistry department of Tel Aviv University. In 1981 he was promoted to the rank of professor. Between 1983 and 1986 he served as head of the School of Chemistry, developing study programs integrating the study of Chemistry with other subjects, and in the period 1995-1998 he served as dean of the Faculty of Exact Sciences. Among his academic duties, he served as head of the faculty teaching committee, member of the university promotions committee, and Senate representative in the central committee and board of trustees. He was also a member of the Ministry of Education topical committee on Chemistry. Current to 2012, Nitzan directs the Advanced Studies Institute at Tel Aviv University. Apart from his being a professor and visiting researcher at universities around the world, Nitzan was a member of the editorial boards of the scientific journals \\"Physical Review Letters\\", \\"Journal of Chemical Physics\\" and \\"Journal of Physical Chemistry\\". Research Nitzan's field of research is chemical dynamics, which studies the dynamics of chemical processes on the microscopic level. In particular, his studies deal with processes involving interactions between light and matter, chemical reactions in condensed phases and chemical processes at interfaces. His early research (1970-1980) has focused on energy transfer processes in molecular systems. This was followed (1980-1990) a series of works (with Joel Gersten) on surface enhanced optical process that later led to the development of the field of molecular plasmonics, as well as works on activated rate processes and charge transfer in complex molecular environments. Later work has focused on electron solvation, transfer and transport in molecular environment and at interfaces, culminated in a series of studies (with Mark Ratner, Michael Galperin, Dvira Segal and others) on molecular electronics. By 2012, he has published 350 scientific articles, and his work has been presented in dozens of international conferences. He was ranked as one of the hundred top chemists in the world between 2000 and 2010, as ranked by the impact of their scientific research, by Science Watch.http://www.sciencewatch.com/dr/sci/misc/Top100Chemists2000-10/ Honors and awards Nitzan is a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, a fellow of American Association for the Advancement of Science and of the American Physical Society, a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences. He received an Honorary Doctorate (Doctor Honoris Causa) from the University of Konstanz in 2010. Apart from these, his work has earned him many awards, some of which are: * Fulbright scholarship (1972) * I. M. Kolthoff award (1995) * Humboldt Prize (1995) * Israel Chemical Society Prize (2003) * Israel prize in chemistry (2010) * The EMET Prize in chemistry (2012) * Israel Chemical Society Medal (2015) References * Abraham Nitzan, \\"Chemical Dynamics in Condensed Phases\\" (Oxford University Press, 2006) External links * Abraham Nitzan's website: The University of Tel-Aviv * Abraham Nitzan's website: The University of Pennsylvania 1944 births Living people Israeli chemists Theoretical chemists Hebrew University of Jerusalem alumni Tel Aviv University alumni Tel Aviv University faculty Fulbright Scholars Members of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities Israel Prize in exact science recipients who were chemists Israel Prize in chemistry recipients Israeli Jews Computational chemists Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science fellows of the American Physical Society ","title":"Abraham Nitzan"},{"id":"36582520","text":"Renee Spearman single \\"I Love Him\\" artwork 2019 Renee Spearman (born March 3, 1969 in Lynwood, CA) is an American gospel, Christian, recording artist, singer, songwriter and producer.

Rodriguez's music, which had never achieved success in the United States, had become very popular in South Africa although little was known about him in that country. On 10 February 2013, the film won the BAFTA Award for Best Documentary at the 66th British Academy Film Awards in London,\\"Full list of Bafta award winners\\",The Independent, 10 February 2013: Retrieved 26 February 2013. and two weeks later it won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 85th Academy Awards in Hollywood.\\"The 2013 Oscars Best Documentary Award\\", Docomentaryhive.com, 25 February 2013..

It was released in the United Kingdom on 26 July 2012, and had a limited release (New York and Los Angeles) in the United States the following day. Searching for Sugar Man performed well during its theatrical release, earning $3,696,196 at the US box office (47th of all US docs on Box Office Mojo). Reception =Critical response= Searching for Sugar Man has received widespread critical acclaim. The film holds a 95% rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 7.97/10, based on reviews from 130 critics. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"A fascinating portrait of a forgotten musical pioneer, Searching for Sugar Man is by turns informative and mysterious.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100 based on 32 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a glowing four-star review, writing \\"I hope you're able to see this film...and yes, it exists because we need for it to.\\" The New York Times critic Manohla Dargis also wrote a positive review, calling the film \\"a hugely appealing documentary about fans, faith and an enigmatic Age of Aquarius musician who burned bright and hopeful before disappearing.\\" Dargis subsequently named Searching for Sugar Man one of the 10 best films of 2012. Criticism The film's narrative of a South African story about an American musician omits that Rodriguez was successful in Australia in the 1970s and toured there in 1979 and 1981. Because of this omission some critics have called the documentary \\"myth-making\\". However, the film focuses on his mysterious reputation in South Africa and the attempts of music historians there to track him down in the mid-1990s. South Africans were unaware of his Australian success due to the harsh censorship enacted by the apartheid regime coupled with international sanctions that made any communication with the outside world on the subject of banned artists virtually impossible. Awards and nominations * Searching for Sugar Man won the Best Documentary category at the 85th Academy Awards. Rodriguez declined to attend the award ceremony as he did not want to overshadow the filmmakers' achievement if he came up on stage with them. Upon accepting his award, producer Simon Chinn remarked on such generosity, \\"That just about says everything about that man and his story that you want to know.” However, Malik Bendjelloul also said on stage, \\"Thanks to one of the greatest singers ever, Rodriguez.\\" * The film also won the Best Documentary category at the 66th British Academy Film Awards on 10 February 2013. * The Directors Guild of America awarded the DGA Award for best documentary on 2 February 2013. * The Writers Guild of America awarded the WGA Award for best documentary. * The Producers Guild of America awarded the PGA Award for best documentary. * The American Cinema Editors awarded the ACE Eddie Award for best documentary. * It won the Guldbagge Award for Best Documentary at the 48th Guldbagge Awards. * It won The National Board of Review in New York on 5 December 2012. * The International Documentary Association (IDA) awarded Searching for Sugar Man Best Feature and Best Music at the 28th Annual IDA Documentary Awards on 7 December 2012 at the Directors Guild of America building, Los Angeles, California. * It also won Best Documentary during Critics' Choice Awards – Searching for Sugar Man * Searching for Sugar Man won the Special Jury Prize and the Audience Award for best international documentary at the Sundance Film Festival.
