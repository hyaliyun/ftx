Location The viaduct crosses the deep and wide Saane/Sarine valley, which is cut into Molasse rock, in the hamlet of Grandfey in Granges-Paccot, about three kilometres north of Fribourg station on the way to D√ºdingen. The viaduct crosses the language border between Romandy and German-speaking Switzerland (the \\"R√∂stigraben\\").  History = First viaduct = Grandfey Viaduct of 1862 In 1856, the Lausanne‚ÄìFribourg‚ÄìBern Railway Company commissioned engineer Leopold Blotnitzki to carry out studies for this most complex construction project in its route network. The design was developed by a commission of four, consisting of Durbach, Karl Etzel, Fran√ßois Jacqmin and Wilhelm N√∂rdlinger, as the engineer (who was then active in France under the name Nordling) was called in Stuttgart. This planning took into account the recently built Crumlin Viaduct in South Wales and the Sitter Viaduct near St. Gallen. Planning for the construction process was carried out by Ferdinand Mathieu, senior engineer of the French iron and steel company Schneider et Cie in Le Creusot, which had received the metalworking contract for the bridge. The earthwork and masonry work was carried out by the Swiss company Wirth, Studer & Co. The 343 m long and 82 m high double-track bridge built from 1857 to 1862 consisted of six vertical lattice trusses supported by large stone pillars, carrying a strong lattice girder supporting the superstructure of the rail tracks. The five central spans were each 48.75 m long and the side spans were 43.30 m long. Inside the truss there was a lane for pedestrians and small carts. Thus the Grandfey Viaduct created a new route for light land transport over the long and impassable gorge of the Saane. The masonry stone bases were up to 32 m high so that their heads were all at the same level. The flow dividers of pillars IV and V standing in the river were protected by limestone cladding against the current. The pillars consisted of 3.93 m long cast iron pipes, which were arranged on 11 levels stacked together 43.20 m high and connected by lattice-shaped wrought iron trusses and stiffened. The track base consisted of four wrought-iron lattice girders spaced 2.09 m apart, measured from their centres. The passage for the pedestrians was located between the two middle girders. The Grandfey Viaduct is considered the first bridge where Ferdinand Mathieu, senior engineer of Schneider & Cie., used the incremental launch method that he invented. In this case, the lattice girder beam that was pushed over the valley served as a crane for the construction of the first and subsequently the next pillar. 1300 tons of cast iron and 700 tons of wrought iron were used for the pillars and 1250 tons of wrought iron were used for the beams. The Grandfey viaduct influenced the Busseau Viaduct in France, which was designed shortly afterwards by N√∂rdling. It also served as a model for the Malleco Viaduct in Chile, which was also built by Schneider & Cie. from 1886 to 1890. Because of heavier trains, the bridge was rebuilt in 1892 with a single track, which was positioned in the middle of the deck and the speed was limited to 40 km/h. = Second viaduct = Grandfey Viaduct of 1927 Pedestrian path below the tracks With the electrification of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) network, the bridge had to be strengthened to carry heavier and faster locomotives and train compositions. The Grandfey Viaduct was rebuilt in a new form from 1925 to 1927 following principles developed by the bridge construction office of the SBB, which had already been realised with the Le Day Viaduct. SBB involved Robert Maillart, the pioneer of large concrete structures in Switzerland, as an advisory engineer. Supported by pillars consisting of iron trusses completely enclosed in concrete, the bridge has six wide concrete arches that are built according to the Melan system, over the top of which runs a pedestrian walkway. The five middle arches have clear spans of 42 m. Long rows of slender arcades that carry the track bed rest on the main arches. The double row of arches gives the large structure a monumental classical form. As a result of the construction of the Schiffenen dam, which was completed in 1964, the lower part is now filled by the water of the Schiffenensee.  Passage and sculpture by Richard Serra  The passage through the Grandfey Viaduct is one of the most beautiful points on the canton of Fribourg's network of hiking and cycling trails. A modern sculpture by the American artist Richard Serra is located on this passage. The artwork represents an L-shaped steel girder and was created in 1987. In August 2007, the SBB had two handrails attached to the artwork for safety reasons, which were later removed.

Among his best known works are the books Design in Architecture: Architecture and the Human Sciences (1973) and Emerging Concepts in Urban Space Design (1990).  Biography  = Family, education and career = Broadbent was born on 11 June 1929 in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England, son of Albert and Florence Broadbent. He studied architecture at the University of Manchester, completing his studies in 1955. He worked as an assistant architect at the architects firm of Fairhursts in Manchester in 1956-1959. His interests, however, lay more in academia; he was a lecturer in architecture at the University of Manchester in 1959-1961; lecturer at the Institute of Advanced Architectural Studies (IAAS) at the University of York in 1961-1962; and lecturer at the University of Sheffield in 1963-1967, before being made head of the School Architecture at Portsmouth Polytechnic in 1967, a position he held until 1994, when he became professor emeritus. Among the numerous positions he has held over his career, he was chairman of the Portsmouth Society in 1974-1988, a member of numerous committees (especially tied to education) in the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Royal Society of Arts, the Design Research Society, and the British School at Rome. Geoffrey Broadbent was married to Anne Barbara Broadbent (deceased 1985), and they had two children, Mark John Broadbent and Antony James Broadbent. He married Gloria Camino Maldonado in 1991.  Work Broadbent was one of a number of early theorists in architectural theory, along with others such as Christopher Alexander, who made strong links between architecture and the humanities and psychology and later, along with others such as Charles Jencks, in semiotics. His seminal book Design in Architecture: Architecture and the Human Sciences (1973) attempted to break down the architectural design process into its constituent parts. He posited four major phases in design activity; pragmatic, iconic, analogic and canonic.

In 1999 the Swiss critic Harald Szeemann, director of the 48th Venice Biennale, invited Nurcis to exhibit inside the Italian Pavilion; the artist organized an ongoing artistic project about networking whose results were illustrated in the book Oreste at the Venice Biennale, published by Charta and distributed internationally.Norese, Giancarlo, et al.

In 2003 Nurcis began working with the Buia Gallery in New York, taking part in the Young Italian Genome group show ‚Äì the exhibition that inaugurated the gallery's activity.Young Italian Genome on undo.net In 2005 the sculptor Arnaldo Pomodoro invited Nurcis to take part to La scultura italiana del XX secolo, a group show that inaugurated the Arnaldo Pomodoro Foundation in Milan, focused on the works of the most important Italian sculptors of the century, such as Adolfo Wildt, Giacomo Balla, Marino Marini, Mario Merz, Luciano Fabro, Enzo Cucchi and others.Pomodoro, Arnaldo; Meneguzzo, Marco (2005). La scultura italiana del XX secolo. Milan: Skira. . In 2017 the museum director Gianluca MarzianiGianluca Marziani Official Web Site organized a retrospective of Nurcis' works, from 1981 to present days, at the Palazzo Collicola Arti Visive museum in Spoleto, Umbria, occupying three floors of the museum. Recurring features of the work of Nurcis are the post- conceptual attitude towards art and the manic nature of his craftsmanship.Altea, Giuliana; Magnani, Marco (1998). ‚ÄúSardegna oggi‚Äù. Flash Art n. 212. Milan: Giancarlo Politi Editore. p. 112. Nurcis considers the classical conceptual approach developed by contemporary artists during the 20th century to be obsolete,\\"Andrea Nurcis. Intervista con Simona Rossi\\". Milan: That's Art n. 23, August‚ÄìSeptember 2001. p. 89. and prefers to talk about his working method as being similar to that of a poet:Perra, Artribune.Guercini, Maurizio (1992). Poesie oscure. Rome: Scettro del Re. OCLC 31226999. p. 28. just as the poet aligns words disconnected from discursive syntax and even from grammatical logic, the artist works by accumulation of formal and plastic elements, often juxtaposed according to the artist‚Äôs casual logic or pure unconscious improvisation.Borsato, Sonia (2011). Generazioni Glocal. Villanova Monteleone: Soter. . p. 25. His manic execution often manifests itself in the obsessive execution of pen drawings in various formats,Marziani, Gianluca (2003).

Imola: Maretti editore. . pp. 208-211.  Works  = The Black Drawings series (1981‚Äìpresent) = The Untitled series of drawings, also called the Black Drawings series,Marziani, Gianluca (April 10, 2004). ‚ÄúL‚Äôarte futura riscopre carta e matita‚Äù, in Lo Specchio, La Stampa, Turin. p. 91. is based on a continual production process of drawings made in ballpoint pen on small sheets of paper (each about 19x14 cm) that the artist has undertaken to draw, starting in 1981, for the rest of his life. The project foresaw that Nurcis create a drawing every night, struggling against sleep and concentrating on work with such tension as to almost destroy the sheet of paper on which the drawing was executed; within the limits of the possible imposed by the course of events, Nurcis has tried to remain faithful to his original purpose. Over time, the usual ballpoint pen ink technique on paper has been enriched with tempera, acrylic, gold or silver leaf inserts. The Black Drawings series today consists of several thousand works ‚Äì all owned by the artist ‚Äì which he exhibits in blocks but has never proposed to the public in its entirety. Nurcis has also prepared a contract that would commit a collector to buying the Black Drawings all together, including those still to be realised.That's Art n. 23. p. 90. = No Light (1995‚Äìpresent) = No Light is a work of digital video art created in collaboration with the artist Enrico Corte.Marziani, Gianluca (2008). Enrico Corte ‚Äì Spectrospective. Bologna: Damiani. . pp. 51-54. It is a 30-minute narrative video representing a dialogue in alternating scenes between two characters: a small Demon, interpreted by Corte with the use of digital animation techniques, and a Hermit, played by Nurcis. Nurcis created his Hermit costume by hand and sometimes exhibits it as a sculptural work. No Light includes scenography and props made by Nurcis and Corte; the artists have exhibited these works separately from the video. A series of stills taken from the video was selected by Corte and Nurcis and exhibited in the form of photographic prints of varying sizes, even composing them as large-format environmental installations. The continual reworking of images, plastic objects, costumes and scenery ‚Äì in addition to a series of limited-edition gadgets inspired by the video ‚Äì over the years to date has allowed the artists to broaden their initial inspiration and provide new keys to the reading of No Light, inserting the video in a context of a multimedia nature. = Homevideo (1997) = Homevideo is a digital video art work created in collaboration with Enrico Corte.Marziani, Gianluca (2008). Enrico Corte ‚Äì Spectrospective. Bologna: Damiani. . pp. 54-55. For this project Nurcis and Corte invited a series of friends, residing in the Roman area, to visit in turn the artists‚Äô house- studio, located on the outskirts of Rome. Each guest had to choose a room of the house-studio to ‚Äústage‚Äù an existential narration based on improvisation; Nurcis and Corte, without interacting with the guest, filmed the action with a 35mm camera. The project also stipulated that when all the rooms of the house- studio had been occupied by the various guests over time, and all the filming had been completed, Nurcis and Corte would sell the house and move elsewhere. Although there are several hours of film, the artists have so far screened only a partial editing of 33 minutes of the video, that includes music written for the occasion, arthouse film sequences, and television broadcasts clips that complete their narrative project; in this form, Homevideo was presented at Corto Circuito film festival at the Royal Palace of Naples, directed by Franz Cerami in 1998Cerami, Franz (1998).

Esposizione Internazionale d‚ÄôArte: dAPERTutto. Venice: Marsilio. . = Pino Piercing Wears a Sculpture (1997) = In February 1997 Andrea Nurcis, together with the artist Enrico Corte, was invited by the art dealer Anna D‚ÄôAscanio to present their double solo exhibition in her gallery in Rome.Marziani, Gianluca (2008). Enrico Corte ‚Äì Spectrospective. Bologna: Damiani. . p. 48. Each of the two artists proposed a series of works on paper to be exhibited on two adjacent walls, while in the center of the gallery they placed a metal sculpture made by the two of them in 1996. The sculpture was designed by Corte and Nurcis to be ‚Äúworn‚Äù by a friend of theirs known under the pseudonym of Pino Piercing, one of the first professional piercers in the Roman area of the ‚Äò90s, who worked mainly in the alternative social centers. In practice, each pointed protuberance from the central body of the sculpture was designed to penetrate the various parts of Pino‚Äôs body where he already had piercings. On the evening of the inauguration, the two artists filmed a 20-minute video entitled Pino Piercing Wears a Sculpture by Enrico Corte and Andrea Nurcis,Pino Piercing Wears a Sculpture on vimeo.com which today also appears as a sort of document of the artistic scene of the Capital, as in the audience there are various representatives of the world of art, literature, cinema, music and even high- level prostitution from the early ‚Äò90s. Nurcis and Corte, with that particular event ‚Äì which combined design, sculpture and post-human performance art ‚Äì intended to renew the traditional, official environment of the art galleries of Rome, of which the D‚ÄôAscanio gallery was one of the representatives,Marziani, p. 48. bringing to the inauguration the ‚Äúcountercultural‚Äù world of the alternative social centers, from which many of the visitors to the exhibition came to celebrate their friend Pino. = Koprospheros (2005) = Koprospheros is the title of a 3 meter high sculpture made by Nurcis in fiberglass, polyester and synthetic plaster. It exemplifies the artist‚Äôs interest in the human figure in its physical imperfections and genetic deformations, as well as his humanistic syncretism through the contamination between various mythological (the classical myth of Atlas), naturalistic (the reference to the dung beetle and its ball of excrement ‚Äì and its capacity to orient itself using the Milky Way's band of lightNational Geographic, 2013) and philosophical themes (the texts of the contemporary German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk, in particular the so-called Sph√§ren trilogy made up of Blasen, 1998, Globen, 1999, and Sch√§ume, 2004). The work was selected by the sculptor Arnaldo Pomodoro and by the critic Marco Meneguzzo for the Italian Sculpture of the Twentieth Century exhibition at the Arnaldo Pomodoro Foundation in Milan in 2005. The show was intended as a historical survey of the most important sculptors of the 20th century at a national level and included works by Medardo Rosso, Umberto Boccioni, Lucio Fontana, Alberto Burri, Pino Pascali, Jannis Kounellis, Gilberto Zorio, Giuseppe Penone, Michelangelo Pistoletto, Mimmo Paladino, Maurizio Cattelan, and others. = Ghost Painting (2017) = Ghost Painting is a painting of 250x300x10 cm created by Nurcis in tempera and oil on wood with three- dimensional inserts in polyester resin. In this work the relationship between painting and sculpture, which the artist often fuses in the same creation, appears clearly. The classical quadrangular shape of the ‚Äúpainting‚Äù is itself violated by the irregularity of the contours of the work. Ghost Painting is based on the concept of ‚Äústratification‚Äù,A conversation between Cristiana Perrella and Andrea Nurcis (2003). Cat. Andrea Nurcis. Rome: 2RC Edizioni d'Arte. p. 6. Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Roma, inv. 003835595/1v. that is, of indefinite accumulation of pictorial levels: each successive layer deletes partly the previous one except for some details that continue to emerge according to the artist‚Äôs calculation that also includes a certain quotient of randomness.

In the late 18th century, Emma Hamilton is said to have frequently watched, from the tower, for Lord Nelson's ship arriving. This led to it being referred to by locals as ‚ÄúLady Hamilton‚Äôs Folly,‚Äù The tower was partly destroyed by fire in 1842 and the ruins were stabilised in 1982.

Stotzas had besieged Carthage shortly before with a force of 8,000 rebels, 1,000 Vandal soldiers (400 had escaped after being captured and sailed back to Africa while the rest were still resisting the Byzantines in Africa), and many slaves. Belisarius had only 2,000 men under his command. Upon Belisarius‚Äô arrival the rebels had lifted the siege. Before battle commenced Stotzas wanted to reposition his troops so the high wind would not aid the Byzantines in the fighting. Stotzas neglected to move any troops to cover this movement. Belisarius, seeing that much of the rebel force was disorganised and exposed, decided to charge the rebels, who almost immediately fled in disorder. Rebel casualties remained relatively light as the Byzantine force was too small to safely chase the fleeing rebels. Instead Belisarius allowed his men to plunder the abandoned rebel camp.

Kovalenko (born 1982) is a full professor of inorganic chemistry and the head of the Functional Inorganic Materials group at ETH Zurich. A part of the research activities of the group are conducted at Empa (D√ºbendorf). He is working in the fields of solid-state chemistry, quantum dots and other nanomaterials, surface chemistry, self-assembly, optical spectroscopy, optoelectronics and energy storage.  Early life and education  Maksym Kovalenko was born in 1982 in southern Ukraine. He grew up in the Ukrainian area of Bukovina. He studied chemistry at Chernivtsi National University. In 2007, Kovalenko obtained his Ph.D. at the Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Heiss. During this time, he focused on narrow band gap quantum dots, and published several articles on HgTe, SnTe, PbSe as well as iron oxide nanocrystals. A part of these works was carried out at the Molecular Foundry (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, USA).  Academic career and research  After the completion of his Ph.D., he moved to the University of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois as a post-doctoral research assistant in the group of Prof. Dmitri Talapin. In 2009, Kovalenko published an article in Science describing the use of inorganic ligands on colloidal nanocrystals. Such an all-inorganic design of semiconductor nanocrystals had enabled their integration into diverse electronic and optoelectronic devices. In 2011, Kovalenko accepted an assistant professorship at ETH Zurich in Zurich, Switzerland. Initially, the research group focused on the development of new synthetic approaches for nanocrystals and their utilization in rechargeable batteries and photodetectors. In 2015, the group introduced highly luminescent nanocrystals of cesium lead halide perovskites and shortly thereafter, in 2016-2017, formamidinium lead halide nanocrystals. In 2016, Kovalenko received tenure and became an associate professor at ETH Zurich and continued to lead his research group at both ETH Zurich and Empa. Since then, the research group of Kovalenko has focused on understanding and improving colloidal perovskite nanocrystals, their assembly into long-range ordered superlattices and their exploration as quantum light sources. Additionally, the group continues to investigate the surface chemistry of nanocrystals and novel electrode materials for Li-ion and non-Li battery technologies. The group is increasingly active in the discovery of novel semiconductors and light emitters. In 2018, the group received financial support from the ETH+ Initiative to establish a crystal growth and characterization facility for research purposes as well as for education and training of students. The expertise of the group now also includes single- particle spectroscopy, fabrication of light-emitting diodes and testing materials for hard radiation detection. In August 2020, Kovalenko was promoted to full professor at ETH Zurich. = Additional roles = Kovalenko currently serves as an associate editor for the journal Chemistry of Materials.

He reached the rank of colonel.  Childhood and youth  Nikolay Shmelkov was born at May 5, 1912, on Selivanovo railway station (now Krasnaya Gorbatka in Vladimir Oblast), to a family of a railwayman. In 1914 the family moved to Tulun station. Since 1928 till 1929 Nikolay studied in a school of factory and plant apprenticeship in Nizhneudinsk. Then he started working as a turner's apprentice at Sestroretsk instrumental factory.  Army service  Shmelkov was conscripted into the Army in November 1930. He graduated from 8th School of Aircraft Motorists of the Baltic Naval Depot of the Naval Forces of the Baltic Sea in 1931. Since April 1931 he served as aviation motorist in 21st Independent Aviation Squadron of Leningrad Military District in Petergof. In the end of 1931 Nikolay volunteered to become a pilot, was sent to a flight school and in 1933 graduated from 11th Military Pilot School of the Air Force of the Red Army (later Lugansk Higher Military Aviation School of Navigators) in Luhansk. Since July 1933 Shmelkov became a pilot in 16th Fighter Squadron of Air Force of the Ukrainian Military District, based at Kirovo (now Pivnichne in Donetsk Oblast), since June 1934 he became a pilot of 109th Fighter Squadron of 81st Aviation Brigade in Kiev. In September 1936 he volunteered to fight on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. He arrived to Spain in the first group of Soviet volunteer pilots. Shmelkov participated in the aerial defence of Madrid from October 1936 to January 1937, flying a Polikarpov I-15. He has made 49 combat sorties, spending 66 hours in total. The data on number of his aerial victories is highly contradictory.

In January 1937 he returned to USSR prematurely because of health issues (he was wounded). At December 31, 1936, lieutenant Nikolay Shmelkov was awarded the title of Hero of Soviet Union and Order of Lenin for his heroism. Since March till November 1937 he commanded a unit and ait detachment in 65th Fighter Squadron in Air Force of Kiev Military District, then he was sent to study. In 1938 he graduated from Lipetsk Higher Aviation Courses for Improvement of Command Staff of the Air Force of the Red Army. He was at once promoted from lieutenant to major in February 1938. He was elected as deputy into the Supreme Soviet of Russia. Since August 1938 Shmelkov served as the assistant commander of 54th Fighter Brigade in the Air Force of Leningrad Military District (headquartered at Gorelovo airbase). At this position he participated in the Winter War, showing himself as proactive commander and good organizer. For this he was awarde the Order of Red Banner. Since April 1940 he became the commander of the brigade. Since August 1940 Shmelkov became deputy commander of 1st Mixed Aviation Division (Leningrad Military District), since the beginning of June 1941 - acting commander of 145th Fighter Regiment of this division. At this position Shmelkov met the beginning of the war between Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. His regiment fought in the Air Force of the 14th Army (Northern Front, later Karelian Front), was based at Shonguy airbase, defending Murmansk and Kirov Railway. He flew a Polikarpov I-16. During a bombardment in August 1941 he suffered a concussion. His actions as regiment commander were judged unsatisfactory because of high casualties against Luftwaffe, so he was sent to study after the hospital. In 1942 Nikolay Shmelkov graduated from Courses of Improvement of Command Staff in Military Academy of Command and Navigator Staff of the Air Force of the Red Army. Since May 1942 he served as deputy commander of 5th Reserve Aviation Brigade of Air Force of Siberian Military District in Novosibirsk, in September‚ÄìOctober temporarily being its acting commander. Since October 1942 he commanded 297th Fighter Division of PVO of Transbaikal Zone of Anti-Air Defence, headquartered in Chita. Since April till June 1944 he was on probation in action in 311th Fighter Division of the 2nd Air Army, 1st Ukrainian Front on the position of deputy commander for flight operations. In July 1944 he was removed from the command for a lot of service drawbacks and low level of combat training in the division. After being in reserve for some time he was assigned to serve as deputy commander of 234th Fighter Division of 6th Fighter Corps (16th Air Army, 1st Belorussian Front). He participated in Vistula-Oder Offensive and East Pomeranian Offensive, but did not use his chance to restore reputation. In March 1945 he was again removed from command for \\"systematic drunkenness, unwillingness to follow the directions of higher commanders and Military Soviet of Front, unwillingness to work and fly, and also loss of authority among subordinates\\", and sent from the front to reserve of personnel department of Air Force of the Red Army.

Their colors are tunable across the entire visible spectrum by changing the halide from chloride (UV/blue) to bromide (green) and iodide (red; Nano Lett. 2015, 15, 6, 3692-3696). https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl5048779 Perovskite nanocrystals are a class of semiconductor nanocrystals, which exhibit unique characteristics that separate them from traditional quantum dots. Perovskite nanocrystals have an ABX3 composition where A = cesium, methylammonium (MA), or formamidinium (FA); B = lead or tin; and X = chloride, bromide, or iodide. Their unique qualities largely involve their unusual band- structure which renders these materials effectively defect tolerant or able to emit brightly without surface passivation. This is in contrast to other quantum dots such as CdSe which must be passivated with an epitaxially matched shell to be bright emitters. In addition to this, lead-halide perovskite nanocrystals remain bright emitters when the size of the nanocrystal imposes only weak quantum confinement. This enables the production of nanocrystals that exhibit narrow emission linewidths regardless of their polydispersity. The combination of these attributes and their easy-to-perform synthesis has resulted in numerous articles demonstrating the use of perovskite nanocrystals as both classical and quantum light sources with considerable commercial interest. Perovskite nanocrystals have been applied to numerous other optoelectronic applications such as light emitting diodes, lasers, visible communication, scintillators, solar cells, and photodetectors.  Physical properties  Perovskite nanocrystals possess numerous unique attributes: defect tolerance, high quantum yield, fast rates of radiative decay and narrow emission line width in weak confinement, which make them ideal candidates for a variety of optoelectronic applications. = Bulk vs. nano = The intriguing optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskites were first studied in single crystals and thin films.: From these reports, it was discovered that these materials possess high carrier mobility, long carrier lifetimes, long carrier diffusion lengths, and small effective carrier masses. Unlike their nanocrystal counterparts, bulk ABX3 materials are non-luminescent at room temperature, but they do exhibit bright photoluminescence once cooled to cryogenic temperatures. = Defect-tolerance = Contrary to the characteristics of other colloidal quantum dots such as CdSe, ABX3 QDs are shown to be bright, high quantum yield (above 80%) and stable emitters with narrow linewidths without surface passivation. In II-VI systems, the presence of dangling bonds on the surface results in photoluminescence quenching and photoluminescent intermittence or blinking. The lack of sensitivity to the surface can be rationalized from the electronic band structure and density of states calculations for these materials. Unlike conventional II-VI semiconductors where the band gap is formed by bonding and antibonding orbitals, the frontier orbitals in ABX3 QDs are formed by antibonding orbitals composed of Pb 6s 6p and X np orbitals (n is the principle quantum number for the corresponding halogen atom). As a result, dangling bonds (under- coordinated atoms) result in intraband states or shallow traps instead of deep mid-gap states (e.g. d in CdSe QDs. This observation was corroborated by computational studies which demonstrated that the electronic structure of CsPbX3 materials exhibits a trap-free band gap. Furthermore, band structure calculations performed by various groups have demonstrated that these are direct band gap materials at their R-point (a critical point of the Brillouin zone) with a composition dependent band gaps. = Photoluminescence = It was discovered in 2015 that the photoluminescence of perovskite nanocrystals can be post-synthetically tuned across the visible spectral range through halide substitution to obtain APbCl3, APb(Cl,Br)3, APbBr3, APb(Br,I)3, and APbI3; there was no evidence of APb(Cl,I)3. The change in band-gap with composition can be described by Vegard's Law, which describes the change in lattice parameter as a function of the change in composition for a solid solution. However, the change in lattice parameter can be rewritten to describe the change in band gap for many semiconductors. The change in band gap directly affects the energy or wavelength of light that can be absorbed by the material and therefore its color. Furthermore, this directly alters the energy of emitted light according to the Stokes shift of the material. This quick, post- synthetic anion-tunability is in contrast to other quantum dot systems where emission wavelength is primarily tuned through particle size by altering the degree of quantum confinement. Aside from tuning the absorption edge and emission wavelength by anion substitution, it was also observed that the A-site cation also affects both properties. This occurs as a result of the distortion of the perovskite structure and the tilting of octahedra due to the size of the A-cation. Cs, which yields a Goldschmidt tolerance factor of less than one, results in a distorted, orthorhombic structure at room temperature. This results in reduced orbital overlap between the halide and lead atoms and blue shifts the absorption and emission spectra. On the other hand, FA yields a cubic structure and results in FAPbX3 having red shifted absorption and emission spectra as compared to both Cs and MA. Of these three cations, MA is intermediate size between Cs and FA and therefore results in absorption and emission spectra intermediate between those of Cs and FA. Through the combination of both anionic and cationic tuning, the whole spectrum ranging from near-UV to near-IR can be covered.  Absorption Coefficient  Recent studies have demonstrated that CsPbBr3 nanocrystals have an absorption coefficient of 2x105 cm‚àí1 at 335 nm and 8x104 cm‚àí1 at 400 nm. = Single Dot Spectroscopy of Perovskite Nanocrystals =  Blinking and Spectral diffusion  Spectroscopic studies of individual nanocrystals have revealed blinking-free emission and very low spectral diffusion without a passivating shell around the NCs. Studies have also demonstrated blinking-free emission at room temperature with a strongly reduced Auger recombination rate at room temperature (CsPbI3 NCs).  Exciton fine-structure and the Rashba effect  It was observed that emission from perovskite nanocrystals may be the result of a bright (optically active) triplet state. Several effects have been suggested to play a role on the exciton fine structure such as electron-hole exchange interactions, crystal field and shape anisotropy, as well as the Rashba effect. Recent reports have described the presence of the Rashba effect within bulk- and nano- CsPbBr3 and CsPb(Br,Cl)3. While it has been reported that the Rashba effect contributes to the existence of a lowest energy triplet state CsPb(Br,Cl)3, recent work on FAPbBr3 has indicated the presence of a lower lying dark state, which can be activated with the application of a magnetic field.  Coherent emission  Numerous quantum optical technologies require coherent light sources. Perovskite nanocrystals have been demonstrated as sources of such light as well as suitable materials for the generation of single photons with high coherence. = Self-assembly and Superfluorescence = Monodisperse perovskite nanocrystals can be assembled into cubic superlattices, which can range from a few hundreds of nanometers to tens of microns in size. These superlattices have been reported to exhibit very high degree of structural order and unusual optical phenomena such as superfluorescence. In the case of these superlattices, it was reported that the dipoles of the individual nanocrystals can become aligned and then simultaneously emit several pulses of light.  Chemical properties  = Synthesis = Early attempts were made to prepare MAPbX3 perovskites as nanocrystals in 2014 by non-template synthesis. It was not until 2015 that CsPbX3 nanocrystals were prepared by the Kovalenko research group at ETH Zurich. by a hot-injection synthesis. Since then numerous other synthetic routes towards the successful preparation of ABX3 NCs have been demonstrated.  Hot-injection  The majority of papers reporting on ABX3 NCs make use of a hot injection procedure in which one of the reagents is swiftly injected into a hot solution containing the other reagents and ligands. The combination of high temperature and rapid addition of the reagent result in a rapid reaction that results in supersaturation and nucleation occurring over a very short period of time with a large number of nuclei. After a short period of time, the reaction is quenched by quickly cooling to room temperature. Since 2015, several articles detailing improvements to this approach with zwitterionic ligands, branched ligands and post-synthetic treatments have been reported. Recently, soy-lecithin was demonstrated to be a ligand system for these nanocrystals that could stabilize concentrations from several ng/mL up to 400 mg/mL.  Co-precipitation  A second, popular method for the preparation of ABX3 NCs relies on the ionic nature of APbX3 materials. Briefly, a polar, aprotic solvent such as DMF or DMSO is used to dissolve the starting reagents such as PbBr2, CsBr, oleic acid, and an amine. The subsequent addition of this solution into a non-polar solvent reduces the polarity of the solution and causes precipitation of the ABX3 phase.  Microfluidics  Microfluidics have been also used to synthesize CsPbX3 NCs and to screen and study synthetic parameters. Recently, a modular microfluidic platform has been developed at North Carolina State University to further optimize the synthesis and composition of these materials.  Other routes  Outside of the traditional synthetic routes, several papers have reported that CsPbX3 NCs could be prepared on supports or within porous structures even without ligands. Dirin et al. first demonstrated that bright NCs of CsPbX3 could be prepared without organic ligands within the pores of mesoporous silica. By using mesoporous silica as a template, the size of CsPbX3 nanodomains is restricted to the pore size. This allows for greater control over emission wavelength via quantum confinement and illustrates the defect tolerant nature of these materials. This concept was later extended to the preparation of ligand-free APbX3 NCs on alkali-halide supports that could be shelled with NaBr without deteriorating their optical properties and protecting the nanocrystals against a number of polar solvents. As a result of the low melting point and ionic nature of ABX3 materials, several studies have demonstrated that bright ABX3 nanocrystals can also be prepared by ball- milling. With NCs, the composition can be tuned via ion exchange i.e. the ability to post-synthetically exchange the ions in the lattice for those added. This has been shown to be possible for both anions and cations.  Anion exchange  The anions in the lead halide perovskites are highly mobile. The mobility arises from the diffusion of halide vacancies throughout the lattice, with an activation barrier of 0.29 eV and 0.25 eV for CsPbCl3 and CsPbBr3 respectively. (see: physical properties). This was used by Nedelcu et al. and Akkerman et al., to demonstrate that the composition of cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals could be tuned continuously from CsPbCl3 to CsPbBr3 and from CsPbBr3 to CsPbI3 to obtain emission across the entire visible spectrum. While this was first observed in a colloidal suspension, this was also shown in solid pellets of alkali halide salts pressed with previously synthesized nanocrystals. This same phenomenon has also been observed for MAPbX3 and FAPbX3 NCs.  Cation exchange and doping  Although several reports showed that CsPbX3 NCs could be doped with Mn2+, they accomplished this through the addition of the Mn precursor during the synthesis, and not through cation exchange. Cation exchange can be used to partially exchange Pb2+ with Sn2+, Zn2+, or Cd2+ over the course of several hours. In addition to these cations, gold was also shown to be a suitable candidate for cation exchange yielding a mixed-valent, and distorted, perovskite with the composition Cs2Au(I)Au(III)Br6. A-site cation exchange has also been shown to be a viable route for the transformation of CsPbBr3 to MAPbBr3 and from CsPbI3 to FAPbI3. = Morphology = Nanomaterials can be prepared with various morphologies that range from spherical particles/quantum wells (0D) to wires (1D) and platelets or sheets (2D), and this has been previously demonstrated for QDs such as CdSe. While the initial report of lead halide perovskite NCs covered cubic particles, subsequent reports demonstrated that these materials could also be prepared as both platelets (2D) and wires (1D). Due to the varying degrees of quantum confinement present in these different shapes, the optical properties (emission spectrum and mean lifetime) change. As an example of the effect of morphology, cubic nanocrystals of CsPbBr3 can emit from 470 nm to 520 nm based on their size (470 nm emission requires nanocrystals with an average diameter of less than 4 nm). Within this same composition (CsPbBr3), nanoplatelets exhibit emission that is blue shifted from that of cubes with the wavelength depending on the number of monolayers contained within the platelet (from 440 nm for three monolayers to 460 nm for 5 monolayers). Nanowires of CsPbBr3, on the other hand, emit from 473 nm to 524 nm depending on the width of the wire prepared with lifetimes also in the range of 2.5 ns ‚Äì 20.6 ns. Similarly to CsPbBr3, MAPbBr3 NCs also exhibit morphologically dependent optical properties with nanocrystals of MAPbBr3 emitting from 475 nm to 520 nm and exhibiting average lifetimes on the order of 240 ns depending on their composition. Nanoplatelets and nanowires have been reported to emit at 465 nm and 532 nm, respectively.  Structure and composition  Perovskite nanocrystals all have the general composition ABX3 in which A is a large, central cation (typically MA, FA, or Cs) that sits in a cavity surrounded by corner-sharing BX6 octahedra (B = Pb, Sn; X = Cl, Br, I). Depending on the composition, the crystal structure can vary from orthorhombic to cubic, and the stability of a given composition can be qualitatively predicted by its goldschmidt tolerance factor t={(r_a+r_x) \\\\over \\\\sqrt{2} (r_b+r_x)} where t is the calculated tolerance factor and r is the ionic radius of the A, B, and X ions, respectively. Structures with tolerance factors between 0.8 and 1 are expected to have cubic symmetry and form three dimensional perovskite structures such as those observed in CaTiO3. Furthermore, tolerance factors of t > 1 yield hexagonal structures (CsNiBr3 type), and t < 0.8 result in NH4CdCl3 type structures. If the A-site cation is too large (t >1), but packs efficiently, 2D perovskites can be formed. = Distortions and Phase transitions = The corner-sharing BX6 octahedra form a three-dimensional framework through bridging halides. The angle (Œ¶) formed by B-X-B (metal-halide-metal) can be used to judge the closeness of a given structure to that of an ideal perovskite. Although these octahedra are interconnected and form a framework, the individual octahedra are able to tilt with respect to one another. This tilting is affected by the size of the ‚ÄúA‚Äù cation as well as external stimuli such as temperature or pressure. If the B-X-B angle deviates too far from 180¬∞, phase transitions towards non- luminescent or all-together non-perovskite phases can occur. If the B-X-B angle does not deviate very far from 180¬∞, the overall structure of the perovskite remains as a 3D network of interconnected octahedra, but the optical properties may change. This distortion increases the band gap of the material as the overlap between Pb and X based orbitals is reduced. For example, changing the A cation from Cs to MA or FA alters the tolerance factor and decreases the band gap as the B-X-B bond angle approaches 180¬∞ and the orbital overlap between the lead and halide atoms increases. These distortions can further manifest themselves as deviations in the band gap from that expected by Vegard's Law for solid solutions. = Crystal structure and twinning in nanocrystals = The room temperature crystal structures of the various bulk lead-halide perovskites have been extensively studied and have been reported for the APbX3 perovskites. The average crystal structures of the nanocrystals tend to agree with those of the bulk. Studies have, however, shown that these structures are dynamic and deviate from the predicted structures due to the presence of twinned nanodomains. = Surface chemistry = Calculations as well as empirical observations have demonstrated that perovskite nanocrystals are defect-tolerant semiconductor materials. As a result, they do not require epitaxial shelling or surface passivation since they are insensitive to surface defect states. In general, the perovskite nanocrystal surface is considered to be both ionic and highly dynamic. Initial reports utilized dynamically bound oleylammonium and oleate ligands that exhibited an equilibrium between bound and unbound states. This resulted in severe instability with respect to purification and washing, which was improved in 2018 with the introduction of zwitterionic ligands. The stability and quality of these colloidal materials was further improved in 2019 when it was demonstrated that deep traps could be generated by the partial destruction of the lead-halide octahedra, and that they could also be subsequently repaired to restore the quantum yield of nanocrystals.  Applications and Devices  = Light-emitting Diodes = Perovskite NCs are promising materials for the emitting layer of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as they offer potential advantages over organic LEDs (OLEDs) such as the elimination of precious metals (Ir, Pt) and simpler syntheses. The first report of green electroluminescence (EL) was from MAPbBr3 NCs although no efficiency values were reported. It was later observed that MAPbBr3 NCs could form in a polymer matrix when the precursors for MAPbBr3 thin films were mixed with an aromatic polyidmide precursor. The authors of this study obtained green EL with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 1.2%. The first LEDs based on colloidal CsPbX3 NCs demonstrated blue, green and orange EL with sub-1% EQE. Since then, efficiencies have reached above 8% for green LEDs (CsPbBr3 NCs), above 7% for red LEDs (CsPbI3 NCs), and above 1% for blue LEDs (CsPb(Br/Cl)3). = Lasers = Perovskite MAPbX3 thin films have been shown to be promising materials for optical gain applications such as lasers and optical amplifiers. Afterwards, the lasing properties of colloidal perovskite NCs such as CsPbX3 nanocubes, MAPbBr3 nanoplatelets and FAPbX3 nanocubes were also demonstrated. Thresholds as low as 2 uJ cm‚àí2 have been reported for colloidal NCs (CsPbX3) and 220 nJ cm‚àí2 for MAPbI3 nanowires. Interestingly, perovskite NCs show efficient optical gain properties not only under resonant excitation, but also under two-photon excitation where the excitation light falls into the transparent range of the active material. While the nature of optical gain in perovskites is not yet clearly understood, the dominant hypothesis is that the population inversion of excited states required for gain appears to be due to bi-excitonic states in the perovskite. =Photocatalysis= Perovskite nanocrystals have also been investigated as potential photocatalysts.  Other phases  Cesium lead halide perovskites have multiple stable phases that can be formed; these include CsPbX3, Cs4PbBr6 , and CsPb2X5. Although all three have been prepared colloidally, disagreement within the community has arisen around the zero-dimensional Cs4PbBr6 phase. Two contradicting claims exist regarding the optical properties of this material: i) the phase exhibits high photoluminescent quantum yield emission at 510-530 nm and ii) the phase is non-luminescent in the visible spectrum. It was later demonstrated that pure, Cs4PbBr6 NCs were non-luminescent, and that these could be converted to luminescent CsPbX3 NCs and vice versa. A similar debate had occurred regarding the CsPb2Br5 phase, which was also reported as being strongly luminescent. This phase, like the Cs4PbBr6 phase, is a wide gap semiconductor (~3.1 eV), but it is also an indirect-semiconductor and is non-luminescent. The non- luminescent nature of this phase was further demonstrated in NH4Pb2Br5.  Lead-free perovskite nanocrystals  Given the toxicity of lead, there is ongoing research into the discovery of lead-free perovskites for optoelectronics. Several lead-free perovskites have been prepared colloidally: Cs3Bi2I9, Cs2PdX6, CsSnX3. CsSnX3 NCs, although the closest lead-free analogue to the highly luminescent CsPbX3 NCs, do not exhibit high quantum yields (<1% PLQY) CsSnX3 NCs are also sensitive towards O2 which causes oxidation of Sn(II) to Sn(IV) and renders the NCs non-luminescent. Another approach to this problem relies on the replacement of the Pb(II) cation with the combination of a monovalent and a trivalent cation i.e. B(II) replaced with B(I) and B(III). Double perovskite nanocrystals such as Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br, I), Cs2AgInCl6 (including Mn-doped variant), and Cs2AgInxBi1-xCl6 (including Na-doped variant) have been studied as potential alternatives to lead-halide perovskites, although none exhibit narrow, high PLQY emission.

Over several centuries of isolation, the Polynesian settlers formed a distinct culture that became known as the MƒÅori. Early MƒÅori history is often divided into two periods: the Archaic period () and the Classic period (). Archaeological sites such as Wairau Bar show evidence of early life in Polynesian settlements in New Zealand. Many of the crops that the settlers brought from Polynesia did not grow well at all in the colder New Zealand climate, although many native bird and marine species were hunted, sometimes to extinction. An increasing population, competition for resources and changes in local climate led to social and cultural changes seen in the Classic period of MƒÅori history. This period saw the emergence of a warrior culture and fortified villages (), along with more elaborate cultural art forms. One group of MƒÅori settled the Chatham Islands around 1500, forming a separate, pacifist culture known as the Moriori. The arrival of Europeans to New Zealand, starting in 1642 with Abel Tasman, brought enormous changes to the MƒÅori, who were introduced to Western food, technology, weapons and culture by European settlers, especially from Britain. In 1840 the British Crown and many MƒÅori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi, allowing New Zealand to become part of the British Empire and granting MƒÅori the status of British subjects. Initial relations between MƒÅori and Europeans (whom the MƒÅori called \\"PƒÅkehƒÅ\\") were largely amicable. However, rising tensions over disputed land sales led to conflict in the 1860s and large-scale land confiscations. Social upheaval and epidemics of introduced disease also took a devastating toll on the MƒÅori people, causing their population to decline and their standing in New Zealand to diminish. But by the start of the 20th century, the MƒÅori population had begun to recover, and efforts have been made to increase their social, political, cultural and economic standing in wider New Zealand society. A protest movement gained support in the 1960s seeking redress for historical grievances. In the 2013 census, there were approximately 600,000 people in New Zealand identifying as MƒÅori, making up roughly 15 per cent of the national population. Origins from Polynesia island-hopping voyages in the South Pacific Evidence from genetics, archaeology, linguistics, and physical anthropology indicates that the ancestry of Polynesian people stretches all the way back to indigenous peoples of Taiwan. Language-evolution studies and mtDNA evidence suggest that most Pacific populations originated from Taiwanese indigenous peoples around 5,200 years ago. These Austronesian ancestors moved south to the Philippines where they settled for some time. From there, some eventually sailed southeast, skirting the northern and eastern fringes of Melanesia along the coasts of Papua New Guinea and the Bismarck Islands to the Solomon Islands where they again settled, leaving shards of their Lapita pottery behind and picking up a small amount of Melanesian DNA. From there, some migrated down to the western Polynesian islands of Samoa and Tonga while others island-hopped eastward, all the way from Otong Java in the Solomons to the Society Islands of Tahiti and Ra'iatea (once called Havai'i, or Hawaiki). From there, a succession of migrant waves colonised the rest of eastern Polynesia, as far as Hawai'i in the north, the Marquesas Islands and Rapa Nui (Easter Island) in the east, and lastly New Zealand in the far south. Analysis by Kayser et al. (2008) discovered that only 21 per cent of the MƒÅori-Polynesian autosomal gene pool is of Melanesian origin, with the rest (79 per cent) being of East Asian origin. Another study by Friedlaender et al. (2008) also confirmed that Polynesians are closer genetically to Micronesians, Taiwanese indigenous peoples, and East Asians, than to Melanesians. The study concluded that Polynesians moved through Melanesia fairly rapidly, allowing only limited admixture between Austronesians and Melanesians. The Polynesian population experienced a founder effect and genetic drift. Evidence of an ancestral phase in the southern Philippines comes from the discovery that Polynesians share about 40 per cent of their DNA with Filipinos from this area. Settlement of New Zealand In New Zealand, there are no human remains, artefacts or structures which are confidently dated to earlier than the Kaharoa Tephra, a layer of volcanic debris deposited by the Mount Tarawera eruption around 1314 CE. The 1999 dating of some kiore (Polynesian rat) bones to as early as 10 CE was later found to be an error. New samples of rat bone (and also of rat- gnawed shells and woody seed cases) gave dates later than the Tarawera eruption except for three which dated to a decade or so before the eruption. Pollen evidence of widespread forest fires a decade or two before the eruption has led some scientists to speculate that humans may have lit them, in which case the first settlement date could have been somewhere in the period 1280‚Äì1320 CE which is now a widely quoted date. However, the most recent synthesis of archaeological and genetic evidence concludes that, whether or not some settlers arrived before the Tarawera eruption, the main settlement period was in the decades after it, somewhere between 1320 and 1350 CE, possibly involving a coordinated mass migration. This scenario is also consistent with a much debated third line of evidence ‚Äì traditional genealogies () which point to 1350 AD as a probable arrival date for many of the founding canoes () from which most MƒÅori trace their descent. MƒÅori oral history describes the arrival of ancestors in a number of large ocean-going canoes, or , from Hawaiki. Hawaiki is the spiritual homeland of many eastern Polynesian societies and is widely considered to be mythical. However, a number of researchers think it is a real place ‚Äì the traditionally important island of Raiatea in the Leeward Society Islands (in French Polynesia), which, in the local dialect, was called Havai'i.Buck (1960) Migration accounts vary among tribes (), whose members may identify with several waka in their genealogies. With them the settlers brought a number of species which thrived: the kumara, taro, yams, gourd, tƒ´, aute (paper mulberry) ‚Äì and dogs and rats. It is likely that other species from their homeland were also brought, but did not survive the journey or thrive on arrival. In the last few decades, mitochondrial-DNA (mtDNA) research has allowed an estimate to be made of the number of women in the founding population, of between 50 and 100.\\"Rethinking Polynesian Origins: Human Settlement of the Pacific\\", Michal Denny, and Lisa Matisoo-Smith\\"Maori Migration\\" , Bernard Carpinter, NZ Science Monthly  Archaic period (1300‚Äì1500)  An artist's rendition of a Haast's eagle attacking moa. Both species become extinct in the Archaic period. The earliest period of MƒÅori settlement is known as the \\"Archaic\\", \\"Moahunter\\" or \\"Colonisation\\" period. The eastern Polynesian ancestors of the MƒÅori arrived in a forested land with abundant birdlife, including several now extinct moa species weighing between and each. Other species, also now extinct, included the New Zealand swan, the New Zealand goose and the giant Haast's eagle, which preyed upon the moa. Marine mammals ‚Äì seals in particular ‚Äì thronged the coasts, with evidence of coastal colonies much further north than those which remain .Irwin (2006), pp 10‚Äì18 Huge numbers of moa bones ‚Äì estimated to be from between 29,000 and 90,000 birds ‚Äì have been located at the mouth of the Waitaki River, between Timaru and Oamaru on the east coast of the South Island. Further south, at the mouth of the Shag River (), evidence suggests that at least 6,000 moa were slaughtered by humans over a relatively short period of time.M King. Penguin History of NZ. Penguin, 2012 Archaeology has shown that the Otago region was the node of MƒÅori cultural development during this time, and the majority of archaic settlements were on or within of the coast. It was common for people to establish small temporary camps far inland for seasonal hunting. Settlements ranged in size from 40 people (e.g., Palliser Bay in Wellington) to between 300 and 400 people, with 40 buildings (such as at Shag River). Early Archaic period objects from the Wairau Bar archaeological site, on display at the Canterbury Museum in Christchurch. The best-known and most extensively studied Archaic site is at Wairau Bar in the South Island.\\"Maori Colonisation\\", Te Ara\\"Wairau Bar Excavation Study \\", University of Otago The site is similar to eastern Polynesian nucleated villages and is the only New Zealand archaeological site containing the bones of people who were born elsewhere. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal, human bone, moa bone, estuarine shells and moa eggshell has produced a wide range of date estimates, from the early 13th to the early 15th centuries, many of which might be contaminated by \\"inbuilt age\\" from older carbon which was eaten or absorbed by the sampled organisms. Due to tectonic forces, including several earthquakes and tsunamis since human arrival, some of the Wairau Bar site is now underwater.McFadgen and Adds (2018) Work on the Wairau Bar skeletons in 2010 showed that life expectancy was very short, the oldest skeleton being 39 and most people dying in their 20s. Most of the adults showed signs of dietary or infection stress. Anaemia and arthritis were common. Infections such as tuberculosis (TB) may have been present, as the symptoms were present in several skeletons. On average, the adults were taller than other South Pacific people, at for males and for females. The Archaic period is remarkable for the lack of weapons and fortifications so typical of the later \\"Classic\\" MƒÅori,\\"The Moa Hunters\\", 1966, An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, and for its distinctive \\"reel necklaces\\".\\"Nga Kakano: 1100 ‚Äì 1300\\", Te Papa From this period onward, some 32 species of birds became extinct, either through over- predation by humans and the kiore and (Polynesian Dog) they introduced;\\"Early human impact\\", Te Ara repeated burning of the vegetation that changed their habitat; or climate cooling, which appears to have occurred from about 1400‚Äì1450. For a short period ‚Äì less than 200 years ‚Äì the early MƒÅori diet included an abundance of large birds and fur seals that had never been hunted before. These animals rapidly declined: many, such as the various moa species, the New Zealand swan and the kohatu shag becoming extinct; while others, such as kakapo and seals were reduced in range and number. Work by Helen Leach shows that MƒÅori were using about 36 different food plants, although many required detoxification and long periods (12‚Äì24 hours) of cooking. D. Sutton's research on early MƒÅori fertility found that first pregnancy occurred at about 20 years and the mean number of births was low, compared with other neolithic societies. The low number of births may have been due to the very low average life expectancy of 31‚Äì32 years. Analysis of skeletons at Wairau Bar showed signs of a hard life, with many having had broken bones that had healed. This suggests that the people ate a balanced diet and enjoyed a supportive community that had the resources to support severely injured family members.  Classic period (1500‚Äì1642)  Model of a (hillfort) built on a headland. proliferated as competition and warfare increased among a growing population. The cooling of the climate, confirmed by a detailed tree-ring study near Hokitika, shows a significant, sudden and long-lasting cooler period from 1500. This coincided with a series of massive earthquakes in the South Island Alpine fault, a major earthquake in 1460 in the Wellington area, tsunamis that destroyed many coastal settlements, and the extinction of the moa and other food species. These were likely factors that led to sweeping changes in the MƒÅori culture, which developed into the \\"Classic\\" period\\"Te Puawaitanga: 1500 ‚Äì 1800\\", Te Papa that was in place at the time of European contact. This period is characterised by finely made (greenstone) weapons and ornaments, elaborately carved canoes ‚Äì a tradition that was later extended to and continued in elaborately carved meeting houses called Neich Roger, 2001.

They developed hillforts known as , practiced cannibalism,HONGI HIKA (c. 1780‚Äì1828) Ngapuhi war chief, the Encyclopedia of New Zealand.James Cowan, The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period: Volume II, 1922. and built some of the largest war canoes () ever. Around the year 1500, a group of MƒÅori migrated east to Rƒìkohu, now known as the Chatham Islands. There they adapted to the local climate and the availability of resources and developed into a people known as the Moriori, related to but distinct from the MƒÅori of mainland New Zealand. A notable feature of Moriori culture was an emphasis on pacifism. When a party of invading North Taranaki MƒÅori arrived in 1835, few of the estimated Moriori population of 2,000 survived; they were killed outright and many were enslaved.  Early European contact (1642‚Äì1840)  Murderers' Bay in Abel Tasman's travel journal (1642) European settlement of New Zealand occurred in relatively recent historical times. New Zealand historian Michael King in The Penguin History Of New Zealand describes the MƒÅori as \\"the last major human community on earth untouched and unaffected by the wider world\\". Early European explorers, including Abel Tasman (who arrived in 1642) and Captain James Cook (who first visited in 1769), recorded their impressions of MƒÅori. Initial contact between MƒÅori and Europeans proved problematic and sometimes fatal, with several accounts of Europeans being cannibalised.Ingram, C. W. N. (1984). \\"New Zealand Shipwrecks 1975‚Äì1982\\". Auckland: New Zealand Consolidated Press; pp 3‚Äì6, 9, 12. The Blowing Up of the Boyd by Louis John Steele, 1889 From the 1780s, MƒÅori encountered European and American sealers and whalers. Some MƒÅori crewed on the foreign ships, with many crewing on whaling and sealing ships that operated in New Zealand waters. Some of the South Island crews were almost totally MƒÅori. Between 1800 and 1820, there were 65 sealing voyages and 106 whaling voyages to New Zealand, mainly from Britain and Australia.R Bennett. Treaty to Treaty. 2007. P 193. A trickle of escaped convicts from Australia and deserters from visiting ships, as well as early Christian missionaries, also exposed the indigenous population to outside influences. During the Boyd Massacre in 1809, MƒÅori took hostage and killed 66 members of the crew and passengers of the sailing ship Boyd in apparent revenge for the captain whipping the son of a MƒÅori chief. Given accounts of cannibalism in this attack, shipping companies and missionaries kept their distance, significantly reducing their contact with the MƒÅori for several years. The runaways were of various standing within MƒÅori society, ranging from slaves to high-ranking advisors. Some runaways remained little more than prisoners, while others abandoned European culture and identified as MƒÅori. These Europeans \\"gone native\\" became known as PƒÅkehƒÅ MƒÅori. Many MƒÅori valued them as a means to acquire European knowledge and technology, particularly firearms. When Whiria (P≈çmare II) led a war-party against Tƒ´tore in 1838, he had 131 Europeans among his warriors.\\"Pakeha- Maori\\", New Zealand History online Frederick Edward Maning, an early settler, wrote two lively accounts of life in these times, which have become classics of New Zealand literature: Old New Zealand and History of the War in the North of New Zealand against the Chief Heke. European settlement of New Zealand increased steadily. By 1839, estimates placed the number of Europeans living among the MƒÅori as high as 2,000, two-thirds of whom lived in the North Island, especially in the Northland Peninsula. Between 1805 and 1840, the acquisition of muskets by tribes in close contact with European visitors drove a desperate need to acquire muskets to avoid extermination by, and allow aggression against, their neighbours; the recent introduction of the potato allowed more distant campaigns and more time for campaigning among MƒÅori tribes. This led to a period of particularly bloody intertribal warfare known as the Musket Wars, in which many groups were decimated and others driven from their traditional territory.1966 Encyclopaedia of New Zealand The absolute requirement for trade goods ‚Äì mostly New Zealand flax, though ' (tattooed heads) were also saleableOld New Zealand: being Incidents of Native Customs and Character in the Old Times by 'A Pakeha Maori' (Frederick Edward Maning), originally published 1863. http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33342 chapter 3 ‚Äì led many MƒÅori to move to unhealthy swamplands where flax could be grown, and there to devote insufficient labour to the production of food, until any survivors were fully equipped, first with musket and ammunition, and then with iron tools.Old New Zealand: being Incidents of Native Customs and Character in the Old Times by 'A Pakeha Maori' (Frederick Edward Maning), originally published 1863. http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33342 chapter 13 \\"every man in a native hapu of, say a hundred men, was absolutely forced on pain of death to procure a musket and ammunition at any cost, and at the earliest possible moment (for, if they did not procure them, extermination was their doom by the hands of those of their country-men who had), the effect was that this small hapu, or clan, had to manufacture, spurred by the penalty of death, in the shortest possible time, one hundred tons of flax, scraped by hand with a shell, bit by bit, morsel by morsel, half-a-quarter of an ounce at a time.\\" It has been estimated that during this period the MƒÅori population dropped from about 100,000 (in 1800) to between 50,000 and 80,000 by the wars' end in 1843. The picture is confused by uncertainty over how or if PƒÅkehƒÅ MƒÅori were counted, and by the near-extermination of many of the less powerful and (subtribes) during the wars. The pacifist Moriori in the Chatham Islands similarly suffered massacre and subjugation at the hands of some NgƒÅti Mutunga and NgƒÅti Tama who had fled from the Taranaki region. At the same time, the MƒÅori suffered high mortality rates from Eurasian infectious diseases, such as influenza, smallpox and measles, which killed an unknown number of MƒÅori: estimates vary between 10 and 50 per cent. The spread of epidemics resulted largely from the MƒÅori lacking acquired immunity to the new diseases. The 1850s were a decade of relative stability and economic growth for MƒÅori. A huge influx of European settlers in the 1870s increased contact between the indigenous people and the newcomers. Te Rangi Hƒ´roa documents an epidemic caused by a respiratory disease that MƒÅori called . It \\"decimated\\" populations in the early 19th century and \\"spread with extraordinary virulence throughout the North Island and even to the South... Measles, typhoid, scarlet fever, whooping cough and almost everything, except plague and sleeping sickness, have taken their toll of Maori dead\\". A korao no New Zealand; or, the New Zealander's first book was written by missionary Thomas Kendall in 1815, and is the first book written in the MƒÅori language. Contact with Europeans led to a sharing of concepts. The MƒÅori language was first written down by Thomas Kendall in 1815, in A korao no New Zealand. This was followed five years later by A Grammar and Vocabulary of the New Zealand Language, compiled by Professor Samuel Lee and aided by Kendall, Waikato MƒÅori and the chief Hongi Hika, on a visit to England in 1820. MƒÅori quickly adopted writing as a means of sharing ideas, and many of their oral stories and poems were converted to the written form. Between February 1835 and January 1840, William Colenso printed 74,000 MƒÅori-language booklets from his press at Paihia. In 1843, the government distributed free gazettes to MƒÅori called Ko Te Karere O Nui Tireni. These contained information about law and crimes, with explanations and remarks about European customs, and were \\"designed to pass on official information to MƒÅori and to encourage the idea that PƒÅkehƒÅ and MƒÅori were contracted together under the Treaty of Waitangi\\".  Treaty with the British Crown (1840)  With increasing Christian missionary activity and growing European settlement in the 1830s, and with growing lawlessness in New Zealand, the British Crown acceded to repeated requests from missionaries and some chiefs () to intervene. The British government sent Royal Navy Captain William Hobson with instructions to negotiate a treaty between the British Crown and the people of New Zealand. Soon after arrival in New Zealand in February 1840, Hobson negotiated a treaty with North Island chiefs, later to become known as the Treaty of Waitangi. In the end, 500 tribal chiefs and a small number of Europeans signed the Treaty, while some chiefs ‚Äì such as Te Wherowhero in Waikato ‚Äì refused to sign. The Treaty gave MƒÅori the rights of British subjects and guaranteed MƒÅori property rights and tribal autonomy, in return for accepting British sovereignty. Considerable dispute continues over aspects of the Treaty of Waitangi. The original treaty was written mainly by James Busby and translated into MƒÅori by Henry Williams, who was moderately proficient in MƒÅori, and his son William, who was more skilled.Orange, Claudia; Williams, Bridget (1987). The Treaty of Waitangi. They were handicapped by their imperfect MƒÅori and the lack of exactly similar words in MƒÅori, as well as by deep differences among the peoples on concepts of property rights and sovereignty. At Waitangi, the chiefs signed the MƒÅori translation. Land disputes and conflict Despite conflicting interpretations of the provisions of the Treaty of Waitangi, relations between MƒÅori and Europeans during the early colonial period were largely peaceful. Many MƒÅori groups set up substantial businesses, supplying food and other products for domestic and overseas markets. Some of the early European settlers learned the MƒÅori language and recorded MƒÅori mythology, including George Grey, Governor of New Zealand from 1845‚Äì1855 and 1861‚Äì1868. A portrait of MƒÅori man, by Gottfried Lindauer, 1882 TƒÅwhiao, the second MƒÅori King However, rising tensions over disputed land purchases and attempts by MƒÅori in the Waikato to establish what some saw as a rival to the British system of royalty ‚Äì viz. the MƒÅori King Movement () ‚Äì led to the New Zealand wars in the 1860s. These conflicts started when rebel MƒÅori attacked isolated settlers in Taranaki but were fought mainly between Crown troops ‚Äì from both Britain and new regiments raised in Australia, aided by settlers and some allied MƒÅori (known as kupapa) ‚Äì and numerous MƒÅori groups opposed to the disputed land sales, including some Waikato MƒÅori. While these conflicts resulted in few MƒÅori (compared to the earlier Musket wars) or European deaths, the colonial government confiscated tracts of tribal land as punishment for what were called rebellions. In some cases the government confiscated land from tribes that had taken no part in the war, although this was almost immediately returned. Some of the confiscated land was returned to both kupapa and \\"rebel\\" MƒÅori. Several minor conflicts also arose after the wars, including the incident at Parihaka in 1881 and the Dog Tax War from 1897‚Äì98. The Native Land Acts of 1862 and 1865 established the Native Land Court, which was intended to transfer MƒÅori land from communal ownership into individual household title as a means to assimilation and to facilitate greater sales to European immigrants. MƒÅori land under individual title became available to be sold to the colonial government or to settlers in private sales. Between 1840 and 1890, MƒÅori sold 95 per cent of their land (63,000,000 of in 1890). In total 4 per cent of this was confiscated land, although about a quarter of this was returned. 300,000 acres was returned to Kupapa MƒÅori mainly in the lower Waikato River Basin area. Individual MƒÅori titleholders received considerable capital from these land sales, with some lower Waikato Chiefs being given 1000 pounds each. Disputes later arose over whether or not promised compensation in some sales was fully delivered. Some claim that later, the selling off of MƒÅori land and the lack of appropriate skills hampered MƒÅori participation in developing the New Zealand economy, eventually diminishing the capacity of many MƒÅori to sustain themselves. The MƒÅori MP Henare Kaihau, from Waiuku, who was executive head of the King Movement, worked alongside King Mahuta to sell land to the government. At that time the king sold 185,000 acres per year. In 1910 the MƒÅori Land Conference at Waihi discussed selling a further 600,000 acres. King Mahuta had been successful in getting restitution for some blocks of land previously confiscated, and these were returned to the King in his name. Henare Kaihau invested all the money, 50,000 pounds, in an Auckland land company which collapsed; all 50,000 pounds of the Kƒ´ngitanga money was lost.Te Puea.M King.Reed.2003. P 59.

Decline and revival  By the late 19th century a widespread belief existed amongst both PƒÅkehƒÅ and MƒÅori that the MƒÅori population would cease to exist as a separate race or culture, and become assimilated into the European population.King (2003), p. 224 In 1840, New Zealand had a MƒÅori population of about 50,000 to 70,000 and only about 2,000 Europeans. By 1860 the Europeans had increased to 50,000. The MƒÅori population had declined to 37,520 in the 1871 census, although Te Rangi Hƒ´roa (Sir Peter Buck) believed this figure was too low. The figure was 42,113 in the 1896 census, by which time Europeans numbered more than 700,000.\\"Population ‚Äì Factors and Trends\\", An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, edited by A. H. McLintock, published in 1966. Te Ara ‚Äì The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 18 September 2007. Retrieved 18 September 2007. Professor Ian Pool noticed that as late as 1890, 40 per cent of all female MƒÅori children who were born died before the age of one, a much higher rate than for males.The Maori Population of New Zealand: 1769‚Äì1971. David Ian Pool, 1971. , 9780196479477 The decline of the MƒÅori population did not continue; it stabilised and began to recover. By 1936 the MƒÅori figure was 82,326, although the sudden rise in the 1930s was probably due to the introduction of the family benefit, payable only when a birth was registered, according to Professor Pool. Despite a substantial level of intermarriage between the MƒÅori and European populations, many ethnic MƒÅori retained their cultural identity. A number of discourses developed as to the meaning of \\"MƒÅori\\" and to who counted as MƒÅori or not. The parliament instituted four MƒÅori seats in 1867, giving all MƒÅori men universal suffrage, 12 years ahead of their European New Zealand counterparts. Until the 1879 general elections, men had to satisfy property requirements of landowning or rental payments to qualify as voters: owners of land worth at least ¬£50, or payers of a certain amount in yearly rental (¬£10 for farmland or a city house, or ¬£5 for a rural house). New Zealand was thus the first neo-European nation in the world to give the vote to its indigenous people.M King. Hist of New Zealand, Penguin. 2012. P 257 While the MƒÅori seats encouraged MƒÅori participation in politics, the relative size of the MƒÅori population of the time vis √† vis PƒÅkehƒÅ would have warranted approximately 15 seats. Sir ƒÄpirana Ngata became instrumental in the revival of traditional arts such as kapa haka and carving. From the late 19th century, successful MƒÅori politicians such as James Carroll, ƒÄpirana Ngata, Te Rangi Hƒ´roa and Maui Pomare, were influential in politics. At one point Carroll became Acting Prime Minister. The group, known as the Young MƒÅori Party, cut across voting-blocs in Parliament and aimed to revitalise the MƒÅori people after the devastation of the previous century. They believed the future path called for a degree of assimilation, with MƒÅori adopting European practices such as Western medicine and education, especially learning English. During the First World War, a MƒÅori pioneer force was taken to Egypt but quickly was turned into a successful combat infantry battalion; in the last years of the war it was known as the \\"MƒÅori Pioneer Battalion\\". It mainly comprised Te Arawa, Te Aitanga-a-MƒÅhaki, Te Aitanga-a-Hauiti, NgƒÅti Porou and NgƒÅti Kahungunu and later many Cook Islanders; the Waikato and Taranaki tribes refused to enlist or be conscripted. MƒÅori were badly hit by the 1918 influenza epidemic when the MƒÅori battalion returned from the Western Front. The death rate from influenza for MƒÅori was 4.5 times higher than for PƒÅkehƒÅ. Many MƒÅori, especially in the Waikato, were very reluctant to visit a doctor and went to a hospital only when the patient was nearly dead. To cope with isolation, Waikato MƒÅori, under Te Puea's leadership, increasingly returned to the old Pai MƒÅrire (Hau hau) cult of the 1860s.Te Puea. M King. Reed 2003. Pp. 77‚Äì100 \\"Conscription and Pai Marire.\\" Until 1893, 53 years after the Treaty of Waitangi, MƒÅori did not pay tax on land holdings. In 1893 a very light tax was payable only on leasehold land, and it was not till 1917 that MƒÅori were required to pay a heavier tax equal to half that paid by other New Zealanders.Treaty of Waitangi. An explanation. NZETC. Sir ƒÄpirana Ngata. 1922. P13 During the Second World War, the government decided to exempt MƒÅori from the conscription that applied to other citizens. The MƒÅori volunteered in large numbers, forming the 28th or MƒÅori Battalion, which performed creditably, notably in Crete, North Africa and Italy. Altogether 16,000 MƒÅori took part in the war. MƒÅori, including Cook Islanders, made up 12 per cent of the total New Zealand force. 3,600 served in the MƒÅori Battalion, the remainder serving in artillery, pioneers, home guard, infantry, airforce, and navy.  Recent history (1960s‚Äìpresent)  Whina Cooper leads the MƒÅori Land March through Hamilton in 1975, seeking redress for historical grievances Since the 1960s, MƒÅoridom has undergone a cultural revival concurrent with activism for social justice and a protest movement. Government recognition of the growing political power of MƒÅori and political activism have led to limited redress for confiscation of land and for the violation of other property rights. In 1975 the Crown set up the Waitangi Tribunal, a body with the powers of a Commission of Enquiry, to investigate and make recommendations on such issues, but it cannot make binding rulings; the Government need not accept the findings of the Waitangi Tribunal, and has rejected some of them. Since 1976, people of MƒÅori descent may choose to enrol on either the general or MƒÅori roll for general elections, and may vote in either MƒÅori or general electorates, but not both. During the 1990s and 2000s, the government negotiated with MƒÅori to provide redress for breaches by the Crown of the guarantees set out in the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. By 2006 the government had provided over NZ$900 million in settlements, much of it in the form of land deals. The largest settlement, signed on 25 June 2008 with seven MƒÅori iwi, transferred nine large tracts of forested land to MƒÅori control. As a result of the redress paid to many iwi, MƒÅori now have significant interests in the fishing and forestry industries. There is a growing MƒÅori leadership who are using the treaty settlements as an investment platform for economic development. Despite a growing acceptance of MƒÅori culture in wider New Zealand society, the settlements have generated controversy on both sides. Some MƒÅori have complained that the settlements occur at a level of between 1 and 2.5 cents on the dollar of the value of the confiscated lands; conversely, some non-MƒÅori denounce the settlements and socioeconomic iniatives as amounting to race-based preferential treatment. Both of these sentiments were expressed during the New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy in 2004.

From 1935 she led a campaign to reduce by ten years the retirement age for unmarried women from age 65 to age 55. The campaigning points were * the relative poverty, ill health, and shorter lifespan of older spinsters compared to married women * their continued need to work until 65, despite their increasing difficulty in finding employment with advancing age * their unrecognised role in caring for aged parents, analogous to the caring role of married women with children * their lesser (and often zero) return for contributions paid into the state pension compared to married women and widows The campaign ended with partial success in 1941, when all women were made eligible to receive the state pension at age 60, rather than 65. Early Life Florence was born on 11 June 1886 in Bradford, West Yorkshire to Caroline White (nee Hargreaves) and James White. She was the second of three children. The family lived in Furnace Street, Bowling Back Lane, an area of heavy industry and textile mills. Caroline White was illiterate, and had been employed as a weaver. James White had considerable education, and published poems and political tracts. He had held a variety of jobs in addition to being a musician, but according to Prickett \\"his real vocation ... was as radical propagandist and street entertainer\\". He travelled the country selling tracts he had written himself. Any personal influence he had on Florence must have been limited though, as he abandoned his family in 1989 when Florence was not more than three years old, leaving Caroline to support them by taking in washing and baking work. Some of his publications, however, stayed in the family's possession. (These documents were collected by Diana Prickett for her biography of Florence White, and are kept at the West Yorkshire Archive Service in Bradford, along with the manuscript of Diana Prickett's biography. The biography is accessible through a scanned copy on the History to Herstory website. ) The children attended Bowling Back Lane Board School, one of Bradford's first Board Schools after the Forster Education Act of 1870. Florence left school at age 12 to work in local industry (Tankard's carpet mill). This was the most usual form of employment for women in Bradford and other industrial areas at the time.  Political Activity  Florence joined the South Bradford Liberal Party and eventually became its Secretary. It was while canvassing for the Party that she became aware of the poor living conditions of some spinsters, who were straitened financially and often in poor health. As employees, spinsters made national health insurance contributions, but premature death before the age of 65 meant that many received no benefits in return. Responding to this need, Florence (a spinster herself, her fiance having died in the first world war) organised a first meeting for April 9th, 1935 at the Bradford Mechanics' Institute. She had arranged for posters and leaflets to be printed, and advertisements to be placed in the Bradford Telegraph & Argus. Interested friends from the Liberal Party were to join Florence on the platform. According to her niece's memoir Florence hoped for about 100 people to attend, but 600 turned out; 300 members were enrolled on the night, and officers elected. The National Spinsters' Pension Association (NSPA) was founded. One of their first steps was writing to all Bradford MP's to make them 'Spinster Conscious' (one of the campaign's enduring slogans). William Leach, MP for Central Bradford (Labour), became the campaign's chief Parliamentary spokesperson. Four months later 8,000 had joined, with sixteen branches across the north of England by December the same year. Membership grew very rapidly, reflecting the large number of women who had lost fiances in the first world war. By December 1938 membership was 140,000 across 104 branches. Scotland had its own Scottish Women's Pension League. The NSPA was notable for its energetic, imaginative and good-humoured campaigning methods. A first big rally was held in London in June 1937. Banners from all NSPA branches were paraded to the Kingsway Hall. Each branch was cheered and applauded as they entered, with Florence and supporting MP's on the platform. Tea was served, and parading continued four abreast, to another meeting at Hyde Park, singing Come Spinsters, Call attention And show that you're alive, Arise demand your pension When you are fifty-five. There is no earthly reason To wait another day, If you will get together Unitedly and say We Spinsters call attention To show that we're alive. Demand we all our pension When we are fifty-five. to the tune of God Bless the Prince of Wales. Soon after the first rally, a petition of over a million signatures was organised over just four weeks in July 1937. A decorated lorry set off from Bradford and presented the petition to the House of Commons after another rally in Hyde Park. In December the same year, spinsters showered Sir Kingsley Wood, the Minister of Health, with 12,000 Christmas cards bearing the message \\"Thinking of you this Christmastide and hoping you will be thinking of us\\". From 1938 a monthly journal The Spinster was circulated to members. Increasing support from MPs led to a deputation from the House of Commons to Kingsley Wood, asking for an enquiry. It was refused on grounds of expense and the likelihood of encouraging claims from other groups. William Leach MP put forward a Private Member's Bill in early 1938, again proposing an enquiry. By now the campaign had the support of nearly 300 MPs and had achieved widespread press coverage. In May 1938 an even bigger rally was held in London, with more than 2,000 supporters marching to Kingsway Hall. Florence persuaded Neville Chamberlain to come to a meeting in Birmingham, where he was presented with an umbrella for his seventieth birthday. The rider was that spinsters also needed protection from a rainy day. The last and biggest rally was held in London in 1939, attracting 3,000 people. Resolutions at an overflowing Kingsway Hall were proposed to the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Minister of Health. After a final meeting in Hyde Park, Florence and her sister Annie, also a worker for the campaign, went by car to Downing Street and succeeded in handing in the Resolutions, cheered on by hundreds of supporters who had marched from Hyde Park. The campaign pointed out the large rise in receipts to the National Health Insurance Fund from the corresponding rise in unmarried women who were obliged to work. This was one of many actuarial injustices suffered by spinsters who contributed to the Fund, yet drew little from it in return. In fact a definite formula for calculating the ratio of contributions to benefits was difficult to arrive at. There had been a shift to contributory funding in 1925 which \\"threw a veil of mystification over the pension scheme, consolidating the political power of the actuaries within Whitehall and providing scope for endless, wearisome arguments over the technical relationship between contributions and benefits\\" Little daunted by this, Florence and the campaigners continued to mount reasoned financial arguments for their cause. The requested Committee of Enquiry was finally held on 16 October 1939, and on 23 January 1940 the Chancellor announced that pensions would be paid to insured spinsters and married women at age 60.  Reception  The NSPA often used arguments from parity with other categories of women. This aroused some opposition, leading to accusations of sectionalism and therefore divisiveness, especially from feminists. For example, in parts of the country where women continued to work after marriage (as often happened in industrial areas) a woman who was widowed would receive a widow's pension in addition to her wages. A spinster of the same age working alongside her would likely experience this as unfair, especially since working was virtually compulsory for her in order to even survive. The war widow was seen as unfairly privileged by the NSPA. Florence cited cases of women who had been married for just one day before being widowed (during the first world war) yet were then financially supported for the rest of their lives, unlike the spinster who had to work to support herself. The NSPA was seen as anti- feminist for claiming that an unfairly high proportion of spinsters' contributions went to subsidise the wives and orphans of male pensioners. The NSPA argued that this subsidy came from the previous contributions of spinsters who had been forced to leave employment in middle age, thereby losing their entitlement to a pension. Others supposedly unfairly benefiting from spinsters' 'lost monies' were mothers receiving maternity benefits. In 1944 Florence protested at the unfairness of being required to pay tax which would fund the new family allowance scheme. This sectionalist attitude drew criticism from feminists, the Labour Party and the TUC. These sectionalist and divisive arguments were however encouraged by the individualising ideology of the social insurance system. Contributory funding had replaced questions of rights and needs with those of actuarial detail - \\"Benefits had to be 'paid for' by an individual's contributions; the corollary was that an individual would feel resentment if his or her contributions subsidised other beneficiaries\\" See also * References External links * Category:1886 births Category:1961 deaths Category:British activists ","title":"Florence White (campaigner)"},{"id":"61491544","text":"Dila Sangraula Pant is a Nepali politician and a member of the House of Representatives of the federal parliament of Nepal.

He is famous as a leading expert on the flora of Delaware and the \\"eastern shore\\" region of Maryland and as an epistolary correspondent with Charles Darwin concerning insectivorous plants. Biography After education at the Friends School at Westtown and from private tutors, William Marriott Canby conducted several successful businesses in Wilmington, Delaware. He used his business profits to finance botanical expeditions throughout North America. He was one of the founders of the Delaware Western Railroad, which became part of Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company. He was an active philanthropist in Wilmington. He was the first president of Wilmington's Board of Park Commissioners, served on the Board for over twenty years, and is credited as the person most responsible for creating Wilmington's city parks. His son Henry Mathews Canby (1871‚Äì1937) also served on the Board from 1913 to 1928. William P. Bancroft was a cousin of William Marriott Canby, Sr., and the two worked together on creating parks in Wilmington. From about 1858 to 1893, William M. Canby collected about 30,000 botanical specimens. In 1893 he sold the herbarium collection to the College of Pharmacy of the City of New York. He immediately began collecting more specimens and made a second collection with about 15,000 specimens, donated to the Natural History Society of Delaware. Family In the 1800s the Canby family of Philadelphia was a prominent Quaker family and had family connections to the Biddle family and to the Morris family. Henry Marriott Canby married Edith Dillon Mathews (born 1835 in Zanesville, Ohio) on 15 July 1870. The photographer Marriott Canby Morris (1863‚Äì1948) was a nephew of Henry Marriott Canby. The children of William Marriott Canby, Sr. and Edith Canby included William Marriott Canby, Jr. (1874‚Äì1937) and Henry Mathews Canby. Honors About 1930 the Wilmington City Council renamed Southwest Park as Canby Park in honor of William and Henry Canby. The Wilmington neighborhood Canby Park Estates is named in honor of the Canby family.

They consist of chokers and necklaces with a fringe of beads and other ornaments. More than one is usually worn, layered over each other. Their elements usually consist of metal or glass beads, hollowed seeds, seashells, mother-of-pearl, and copper or brass ornaments. Types =Lumad= Among the various Lumad peoples of Mindanao, particularly the inter-related Manobo groups, bali-og are bead necklaces composed chokers and necklaces fastened around the neck. A fringe of more beads and other ornaments (including copper or brass bells, amulets, and shells) are then attached to the lower edge of the chokers. The wearing of beadwork among the various Manobo tribes is culturally very important. The number, colors, and patterns vary by tribe and by status. The largest type of bali-og is a women's necklace known as ginibang. Its name means \\"monitor lizard\\" due to the resemblance of the patterns to monitor lizard scales. =Suludnon= Among the Visayan Suludnon people of Panay, bali-og are similar in construction to Mindanao bali-og but are instead made from strips of cloth with traditional embroidery known as panubok. They also have a fringe made of beads attached to coins. Archaeology In Surigao del Sur, a similar necklace was found in the \\"Surigao Hoard\\" in 1981. It consists of several layered collars with a fringe of successively smaller beads. It is made entirely of gold and has been dated to the 9th to 10th century AD. It has been named the tutubi (\\"dragonfly\\") collar, due to the resemblance of the fringes to dragonfly bodies.

He is also one of the Filipino-Chinese businessmen suspected of providing logistical and financial aid to the Katipunan during the Philippine Revolution. Early years Yangco was born in Bacoor, Cavite on August 19, 1841, the son of Regimio Yangco, a mestizo sangley, and Agatona Ronquillo, a Spanish-Filipino mestiza, Yangco was orphaned at the age of 12, and thereafter he began working for a living under the care of a kind hearted aunt who gave him a little education. At the Cavite waterfront, he did odd jobs as errand-boy for sailors and cargador of passengers‚Äô luggage. It was his exposure to life at the waterfront that set Yangco to dream of some day owning ‚Äúmany ships like those in the bay.‚Äù Shipping business Through hard work and thrift as a cargador, Yangco was able to save enough money to buy a banca, which he used for transporting drinking water, ferrying people across the bay. When the Carriedo waterworks began supplying water to Manila residents, the business of transporting drinking water across the bay dwindled. He shifted to transporting zacate (horse fodder), timber and other goods for residents along the Pasig River. In due time he was able to purchase a sailboat for inter-island trading. This became the nucleus of a fleet of 28 steamships, in addition to the other lucrative businesses he engaged in. Yangco also opened a modest store on Jaboneros Street in Manila and later became the sole agent of the Ayala distillery in the area. He also ventured into the lucrative rice and fuel trade, and a storage business at La Murallon Street. A just and generous businessman, he practiced the ‚Äúfixed price‚Äù policy in his stores and profit sharing with his employees. By 1870, his name became known in the business community of Binondo. His rise to success seemed unstoppable. He built several barges and engaged in the loading and unloading of merchandise for coast-wise and ocean-going ships. Around 1880, he bought a small steamship named La Mosca, which he put on the interisland shipping lane carrying both passengers and freight. His shipping business extended to Zambales in the north of Manila, the Laguna de Bay in east of Manila, and the coastal towns of Cavite, Batangas and Mindoro to as far south as Palawan. For his exceptional ability and rapid success, Yangco was referred to as the ‚ÄúKing of Manila Bay and Pasig River‚Äù among the shipping businessmen. Political career Yangco‚Äôs influence was extended to politics and public service. He became the capitan municipal of Binondo in 1893, and was later, appointed councilman of the Ayuntamiento de Manila. Being a respected businessman, his expertise was demanded by the business community as member of the permanent committees on public works, markets and slaughterhouses, police lighting, and designated inspector of the Divisoria market. Philippine Revolution Before the Philippine Revolution, Yangco along with other prominent Filipino-Chinese businessmen like Telesforo Chiudian, Mariano Limjap, and Doroteo Ongjunco, were known to have financed the La Liga Filipina, a fraternal society established by reformist Dr. Jose Rizal with the aim of promoting political and economic reforms in the country. This ended when Rizal was exiled to Dapitan, Zamboanga on July 6, 1892. Some members of the La Liga Filipina like Andres Bonifacio and Deodato Arellano established the secret society called Katipunan, which advocated for armed revolution against Spain. With the discovery of the Katipunan outbreak of the Philippine Revolution on August 23, 1896, Spanish authorities arrested Yangco and his son Teodoro on September 16, 1896. He was suspected of secretly supplying Filipino revolutionists with funds, foodstuffs, and other materials. After six months, he and his son were released from prison through a P10,000 bribe, and they promptly packed up their belongings and left for Spain. Yangco returned to the Philippines in 1898, after the outbreak of the Spanish- American War. He later joined the revolutionary government, and later, the Malolos Republic established by Emilio Aguinaldo. He became part of his cabinet as director general of the treasury. He and Pedro Paterno also had plans to establish a central bank for the republic. Yangco later survived the Philippine-American War that followed after availing of the American offer of amnesty. Personal life Yangco became a widower twice, and remarried two times. His first wife, Ramona Arguelles de Corpus, was from San Antonio, Zambales whom he met during his business trips in the province to transport textiles. Their son, Teodoro, who inherited his father's business acumen and shipping empire, later became a Resident Commissioner of the Philippines to the United States. After the death of his first wife, he married Dominga Lam who later died. His third marriage to Victoria Obin bore two daughters and one son. Yangco died on October 16, 1907.

However, her character is rooted on a real tradition of warrior women in North Africa held by several ancient chroniclers, lending her a degree of veracity. Herodotus spoke about the Ausean and Machlye tribes of Libya, which hosted martial tournaments between young girls and loathed those who died at them, and the Zaueces, whose war chariots were driven by women. Diodorus also believed the mythical Amazons had lived in Libya before moving to the Black Sea. Finally, Asbyte's very name seems to be a reference to the Asbytheans, known as great charioteers according to Herodotus and Pliny. Asbyte is introduced in the poem as a princess of the Marmarica and an ally to Hannibal during the Siege of Saguntum. She is described as a follower of the goddess Diana who enjoyed hunting, riding horses and warring with rival Libyan tribes, who led an entire contingent of Libyan horsewomen and female war charioteers, though not all virgins like her. According to the poem, Asbyte's forces were deployed against a sally of the Saguntines, during which they scored multiple deaths with their javelins. A Cretan mercenary archer named Mopsus tried to kill her from the city, but only hit her Nasamonic lieutenant Harpe, which provoked a response in which Mopsus's sons were killed in the walls, driving him to suicide. Afterwards, the priest of Heracles of the city, Theron, gave Asbyte chase, and eventually killed her when she tried to attack him. Theron was then killed by Hannibal's forces, who recovered Asbyte's beheaded corpse and looted chariot. Asbyte's brother Aquerras is later mentioned among Hannibal's forces in route to Italy, leading his Getuli vassals.Silius Italicus, Punica, 3 He later helps Hannibal to escape from Quintus Fabius Maximus and is finally felled in the Battle of Cannae. In fiction She appears in Vicente Blasco Ib√°√±ez's novel Sonnica the courtesan, where she is portrayed as Hannibal's lover.

This is the band's first material since their previous album Restarter, released in 2015. The album was produced, engineered and mixed by longtime bassist Jonathan Nu√±ez and is the first to feature Eric Hernandez on bass guitar after former guitarist Andrew Elstner's departure in November 2016. Admission was well received by music critics and scored 80/100 on Metacritic. Lineup changes After returning from a tour in November 2016 Andrew Elstner was asked to leave the band, possibly due to \\"differences of opinions\\" he noted in a May 2018 interview with Outlaws of the Sun's Steve Howe. \\"...to clarify ‚Äúleaving‚Äù was not my choice. Was a surprise for sure, but hindsight... it makes more sense man. Shame on me for forgetting how potentially tenuous my position was in the band and not making sure, as much as possible, that everything was cool. But ultimately no hard feelings man\\". Instead of searching for a new guitarist at the beginning of 2017, the band opted instead to find a new bass guitarist with longtime bassist Nu√±ez taking over guitar duties in the void left after Elstner's departure. Given that this was almost new territory for the recently appointed guitarist, Nu√±ez had the following to say in an interview with Dan Almasy of Miami New Times \\"Switching to guitar was almost like starting over, and there‚Äôs a lot that went into getting a sound that I was happy with and finding instruments that I was comfortable on having played bass in the band for all but these last couple years. It was still a little strange, a little alien at first, but now it‚Äôs feeling great.‚Äù Nu√±ez had 9 days to practice playing the instrument between finishing their European tour and starting a full U.S. tour. In early 2017 the band revealed that they had recruited Eric Hernandez of Miami noise rock band Wrong as their new bassist. Hernandez had drummed for the band previously while filling in for current drummer Rick Smith who had been experiencing some health issues. Background and release Steve Brooks During a July 2019 feature interview with Chris Steffen of AllMusic principal songwriter, vocalist and guitarist Steve Brookes touched on writing lyrics for the album stating that he absolutely hated writing them. \\"Back in the 90s, a lot of my songs didn't even have lyrics, I'd just hum melodies or yell or something, improvised. I'd be like, \\"Well, I don't know what I'm saying here, but I'm going to basically say what I'm saying on this recording again,\\" even though it's not a word, you just try to make words out of it in some ways. But I'm more of a melody maker. If there's something meaningful to me, I'll put it in, but most of the time I'm just playing with syllables\\". On May 14, 2019, four and a half years after the release of their previous album Restarter, the band released the song Slide as the lead single while announcing Admission's release. The song was written by new member Hernandez when he joined Torche and drummer Smith had the following to say about the bassist \\"Slide is one of the first songs Eric came to the table with, fully realized and arranged, Eric is a total beast of a songwriter. I suggested he use the first three Gary Numan records as inspiration and he came back at us with some melodically sound material that nailed the Torche vibe.‚Äù Critical reception Admission was met with generally favorable reviews scoring 80/100 on aggregate website Metacritic based on 13 critics. In his review for AllMusic James Christopher Monger gave the album 4 out of 5 stars and said \\"Combining combustive beats and face-melting blasts of doom, sludge, and stoner metal-worthy riffs with soaring, shoegazey melodies, Admission feels both punitive and uplifting; it's a stentorian call to arms that uses the sonic template set forth by bands like Earth and Sunn 0))), but tempers the acrid smoke and hellfire with clarion blasts of icy blue water\\". Giving the album a B rating in his review for Consequence of Sound, Langdon Hickman wrote in his final verdict \\"Admission has a handful of tracks that feel destined to stay deeply lodged in their setlist to come and, at its best, represent some of the brightest and most compelling songs the group has put to tape. Admission isn‚Äôt their greatest album, but its new ideas are more than worth the price of entry\\". In awarding the album a \\"superb\\" rating, SputnikMusic staff writer Simon noted \\"Admission sits comfortably at full throttle and rarely wastes a moment of your time. There‚Äôs little to fault here in all honesty; it plays everything right and does so with a near flawless execution. This is an excellent return to form that should please current fans, but I wouldn‚Äôt argue with it being a great place to start for first-time listeners of the band as well\\". In a more critical review of the album Pitchfork's Zach Schonfeld mentioned the album's incorporating elements of shoegaze and dream pop to mixed success. \\"...for the most part, Admission doesn‚Äôt amount to Torche‚Äôs most compelling songwriting, especially when you consider the four-and-a-half-year wait between albums. Pop-metal, stoner rock, doom metal‚Äîwhatever amalgam of buzzwords you favor, on Admission, Torche remain a reliable supplier of grizzled riffs to test the low end on your stereo.

The Biennale is an international contemporary art biennial in which countries organize their own representation through national pavilions. Multiple journalists named the American pavilion an overall highlight of the Biennale.  Background  The Venice Biennale is an international art biennial exhibition held in Venice, Italy. Often described as \\"the Olympics of the art world\\", participation in the Biennale is a prestigious event for contemporary artists. The festival has become a constellation of shows: a central exhibition curated by that year's artistic director, national pavilions hosted by individual nations, and independent exhibitions throughout Venice. The Biennale parent organization also hosts regular festivals in other arts: architecture, dance, film, music, and theater. Outside of the central, international exhibition, individual nations produce their own shows, known as pavilions, as their national representation. Nations that own their pavilion buildings, such as the 30 housed on the Giardini, are responsible for their own upkeep and construction costs as well. Nations without dedicated buildings create pavilions in venues throughout the city.  Description  The exhibition consists of eight wood sculptures. Big Phrygian, a large, red, cedar version of the French revolutionary cap, invokes a prior theme for which he was already known. In the opposite room, Tabernacle evokes an American Civil War-era soldier's hat, with a patterned fabric interior. And New Voortrekker is a wagon made of ash, cypress, and maple, evoking escape. Outside the pavilion, Puryear built a wooden lattice fa√ßade to enclose the building, Swallowed Sun (Monstrance and Volute). This symbolic cage was meant to show the dissonance of exhibiting in a building modeled after the neoclassical Monticello plantation estate of the slaveholding American figure Thomas Jefferson, letting visitors \\"peer through the barrier ... into the historical past\\". The lattice, like an upside-down basket, connects into snakelike black tube, inspired by an adornment on a Greek column. The work's title refers to the despairing total eclipse when values are unstable. Another new work inside also responds to Jefferson: A Column for Sally Hemings. The sculpture in the rotunda‚Äîan iron shackle mounted into an immaculate, white column‚Äîis named for a slave who worked and bore children for Jefferson.  Production  The Puryear exhibition marked the first time the American pavilion was organized by a public art institution. Its commissioner, Brooke Kamin Rapaport, is a curator and director of the Madison Square Park Conservancy.  Reception  Multiple journalists named the American pavilion an overall highlight of the Biennale. Artsy wrote that the lattice fa√ßade guarding the pavilion was bold even before entering the exhibition. The Financial Times suggested that it be permanently installed.

Mullach Glas is the 5th-highest mountain in the Maumturks range. Naming Irish academic Paul Tempan records that translates as \\"grey/green summit\\", and that the peak has also been called \\"Shannagirah\\". Geography Mullach Glas lies on a small massif in the southeast sector of the Maumturks range, which is separated from the main range by a deep east-west mountain pass called M√°m√©an, a site of pilgrimage dedicated to Saint Patrick since the 5th-century. To the north east is the minor subsidiary peak of Mullach Glas NE Top (), also known as (probably meaning \\"jug\\"). To the west is Binn Mh√≥r (), the 3rd-highest peak in the Maumturks range, while to the east is Corcogemore () Hill walking The most straightforward route to the summit Mullach Glas is the 10-kilometre 4‚Äì5 hour roundtrip route from the pass at M√°m√©an and back; however, because of its positioning on a high ridge of its own small massif, it can also be climbed as an alternative 10-kilometre 4‚Äì5 hour route from Corcogemore in the west, across Mullach Glas, to the summit of Binn Mh√≥r, and then finishing down at M√°m√©an (i.e. the route requires two cars). Mullach Glas is also climbed as part of the Maamturks Challenge, a 25-kilometre 10‚Äì12 hour walk over the full Maumturks range (from Maam Cross to Leenaun), which is considered one of the \\"great classic ridge-walks of Ireland\\", but of \\"extreme grade\\" due to the circa 7,600 feet of total ascent. Since 1975, the University College Galway Mountaineering Club has run the annual \\"Maamturks Challenge Walk\\" (MCW), and mans a checkpoint to the west of Mullach Glas in the M√°m√©an pass, and to the east of Mullach Glas on the neighbouring peak of Corcogemore.

For the year 1659, Schepers was for the first time in Rotterdam appointed as treasurer of the \\"Great Fishery\\", or whalery, an office he would hold in several subsequent years. Schepers accumulated much wealth as a ship owner and gained political influence. During this period, in the Dutch Republic political power was contested between the ruling States faction and the Organgists who wanted to make William III of Orange stadtholder. In the disaster year of 1672, Louis XIV invaded the Republic. The crisis situation was exploited by William III to force the States of Holland to appoint him stadtholder. Schepers with several other Orangists, on 25 Augustus 1672, took over the city council of Rotterdam. He would remain councillor until 1698. As such he had become a member of the Dutch ruling class, the regents. Between 1678 and 1696, he was repeatedly appointed burgomaster and held many other functions, as was usual among the regents.Unger, H. W.; Bezemer, W.; Engelbrecht, E. A. (1889). Bronnen voor de geschiedenis van Rotterdam, deel V: De vroedschap van Rotterdam, 1572‚Äì1795. (184) p. 230 The new Orangist regime attempted to purify all offices from opponents. In the Dutch navy, this was a slow process, as its officers were very popular naval heroes, whose expertise was sorely needed in the fight against France. After the Battle of Texel in 1673, Schepers was appointed lieutenant-admiral of the Admiralty of the Noorderkwartier on 6 October, succeeding the deceased Jan Meppel, despite never having served in the navy before.Eekhout, L. (1992). Het Admiralenboek, de vlagofficieren van de Nederlandse Marine, 1383‚Äì1991. Amsterdam. p. 69 At the time, this was seen as a predominantly political appointment, rewarding Schepers for taking the initiative to order the Rotterdam delegate in the States of Holland to propose the revocation of the Perpetual Edict, forbidding the appointment of any member of the House of Orange in the office of stadtholder. However, Schepers was not merely an Orangist figurehead. He actually sailed on the fleet the next year, until December 1674\\\\. In 1676, he first commanded, with Vice-Admiral Jan Jansse van Nes, a flotilla blocking the French corsair base Dunkirk and then supported the Danes against Sweden with a squadron. In 1677 he fought the Swedish forces in the Baltic and was knighted by Christian V of Denmark in the Order of the Dannebrog. When Cornelis Tromp became lieutenant-admiral-general of the confederate Dutch fleet, Schepers, on 25 February 1678, succeeded him as lieutenant-admiral of the important Admiralty of Amsterdam. In 1683, Schepers commanded a squadron observing French and Danish naval actions on the North Sea. Returning to the Texel on 11 November, the squadron was hit by a storm that sank eight vessels. The States General of the Netherlands appointed Schepers to head a commission, together with Cornelis Valckenier and Simon Velius, to formulate proposals for the improvement of the readiness of the Dutch fleet. Their recommendations would lay the foundation for the expansion of the Dutch fleet during the 1690s, reaching its largest size during the age of sail. In 1688, William III called upon Schepers to organise the transport and landing vessels of the invasion fleet in the Glorious Revolution. Schepers personally contributed twelve vessels and hired 93 more. At first it was considered to let Schepers command a squadron, but eventually it was decided that he should accompany William III on Den Briel, a frigate of 30 cannon under flag Captain Joan van der Esch, together with Vice-Admiral Fredrik Willem van Bronckhorst Stirum. On 28 March 1692, Schepers succeeded Lieutenant-Admiral Aert Jansse van Nes at the Admiralty of the Maze. In 1696, he hired fifteen ships to blockade Dunkirk, to prevent a return of James II of England. Schepers died on 21 January 1704, and was buried with great pomp four days later, in the chapel of the Lords of Kralingen in the Sint-Laurenskerk at Rotterdam. The chapel, acquired by the admiral in 1695, would be destroyed during the bombardment of Rotterdam in May 1940\\\\.

It is the best studied site in the hinterland of an ancient region, known to the Classical world as Colchis, and has been inscribed on the list of the Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance. Remains of fortifications and temples, locally produced and imported Greek pottery, and sophisticated local goldwork‚Äînow on display at the Vani Archaeoogical Museum and the Museum of Georgia in Tbilisi‚Äîindicate that Vani was a vibrant urban settlement from the 8th century down to the mid-1st century BC. An ancient name for Vani is unknown: two competing hypotheses identify the site with the Surium of Pliny the Elder or the Leucothea of Strabo.  Location  The Vani site is situated at the western outskirts of the modern town, on Akhvlediani Gora, a low terraced triangular hill of approximately 8.5 ha, flanked on two sides by deep ravines. The foothills around Vani form the point of the nearly triangular wetland region of Colchis, the base of which is along the eastern Black Sea coast, dotted by Greek colonies in antiquity. The site itself was located on the intersection of ancient trade routes, enjoying a commanding position over the adjoining plain.  Archaeological study  Occasional archaeological finds at Vani were first reported by the French scholar Marie-F√©licit√© Brosset in 1851, followed by a series of notes in the Georgian press in the 1870s. Preliminary archaeological survey was headed by Alexander Stoyanov in 1889, and on a larger scale, by Ekvtime Taqaishvili in 1896 and from 1901 to 1903. Further reconnaissance was conducted in 1936, followed by more systematic, but irregular digs under Nino Khoshtaria from 1947 to 1962. In 1966, the excavations resumed on a regular basis as part of the Center for Archaeology expedition, directed by Otar Lordkipanidze and, after his death in 2002, by Darejan Kacharava.  Features  Gold diadem from Vani, 5th century BC. Hellenistic bronze torso from Vani. Date uncertain. Vani is the most substantially excavated site in the Colchian hinterland and offers the best evidence of the development of this area throughout the period of Greek colonization of the coastline into the Roman period. Four phases have been identified at the Vani site from the 8th century down to the mid-1st century BC. = First and second phases = The most archaic Vani appears to have been a small settlement, containing the log- cabins, also known elsewhere in Colchis. Layers dated to the first phase (c. 800‚Äì600 BC) have yielded fragments of baked daub with wicker imprints, pottery‚Äîwheel-made, well-baked, black-fired, and polished on the surface‚Äîand terracotta figurines of various animals. At that time, Lordkipanidze believes, Vani was an emerging cult center and wielded significant influence over surrounding settlements. In the second phase (c. 600‚Äì350 BC) there was a tangible increase in wealth at Vani, as evidence by large locally produced earthenware storage-jars, rich burials with grave good such as fine gold work of local production‚Äîwith affinities to both the Greek and Middle Eastern cultures‚Äîand the appearance of imported Greek pottery, the earliest being a Chiot chalice from the early 6th century. Vani appears to have been a seat of the local elite which dominated a stratified social hierarchy. = Third phase = During the third phase at Vani (c. 350‚Äì250 BC), Changes in the material culture are prominent. The principal sanctuary on the hilltop had been destroyed and burnt and the ritual ditches had ceased to function; new stone buildings appear including a circuit wall. In addition, traditional Colchis pottery gives way to new forms, notably pear-shaped jugs with red paint on a light ground, familiar in eastern Georgia, anciently known as Iberia, and Greek influence becomes more prominent on the goldwork. Burial in storage-jars becomes the predominant mode. An important find is a 4th-century BC signet- ring bearing, in Greek letters, the name of \\"Dedatos\\", probably a local ruler. Lordkipanidze assumes some of these changes may reflect the infiltration of tribes from Iberia, which at that time experienced urbanization, state formation, and expansion. = Fourth phase = The fourth phase at Vani runs from c. 250 BC to c. 47 BC. This was the period of relative decline in central Colchis: many settlements disappeared as did rich burials. The Vani site saw the erection of a strong circuit wall, with towers and a heavily defended gate, built of mudbrick on a stone socle. Around 150 BC, much of the city was destroyed as evidenced by dating the stamped Rhodian amphorae unearthed at Vani. By the end of the 2nd century BC, there was renewed building activity: parts of the ruins were methodically levelled and new buildings were constructed. The northern part of the hill was dominated by the gate and defensive structures and the lower terrace housed a large temple complex. The large buildings of the city were decorated with Corinthian capitals and lion- head waterspouts. Hellenistic statues in bronze attest to the impact of Greek culture. According to Lordkipanidze, Vani became a city-sanctuary similar to the temple communities of ancient Anatolia; David Braund argues there is the lack of evidence and identification of the function of many buildings at Vani is problematic.  Destruction  In the middle of the 1st century BC, the ancient city at Vani was attacked and destroyed. The gate, sanctuary with its mosaic floor, the stepped altar, and the round temple on the central terrace of the hill exhibit signs of violence and conflagration: walls razed to the foundation, fired stones, baked tiles and mudbrick, and charred beams. It is unknown who was responsible for the destruction of the city: Pompey, who led the first Roman incursion into the Caucasian hinterland in 65 BC, Pharnaces II, who tried to conquer Colchis and Pontus in 49 BC, and Mithridates of Pergamon, who was made by Julius Caesar successor to Pharnaces in 47 BC, are all possible candidates. According to Lordkipanidze, two destruction layers can be observed within a few years of each other: one attributed to an invasion by Pharnaces and the other to that by Mithridates. Vani never recovered to its past level. Remains from the Roman and medieval periods are very fragmentary, such as a c. 200 AD robbed burial in a bronze sarcophagus, and the medieval ruins of a church, a hilltop kiln, and a warrior's burial.  Ancient name  The name of the city unearthed at Vani is unknown. Two competing hypotheses have been put forward. One, proposed by Nino Khoshtaria, identifies Vani with a Colchian city named Surium by the 1st-century AD Roman author Pliny the Elder. Surium is also mentioned by Ptolemy. A settlement named Surtum is located by the Ravenna Cosmography in the heartland of Colchis, somewhere between Rhodopolis and Sarapanis, the location roughly corresponding to that of Vani. The toponym Souris also occurs on a bronze inscription from Vani. An alternative hypothesis, suggested by Otar Lordkipanidze, has it that Vani is the site of the temple of Leucothea in Colchis reported by Strabo as being sacked by Pharnaces II of Pontus and then by Mithridates of Pergamum. Opponents point to the fact that, according to Strabo, the temple was close to the common border of Colchis, Iberia, and Armenia; the location does not suit Vani.

His harsh and unjust persecutions created a reign of terror, and eventually he was removed from office. Origins Emirate of Granada in 1462. The conquest was completed during the Granada War (1482‚Äì91). The birth date of Diego Rodr√≠guez de Lucero is unknown, but he seems to have been born in Moguer. This was a region where many of the people were converts from Judaisim or Islam, which perhaps helps explain his fanaticism. His parents were Juan Lucero and Marina Rodriguez. He received a bachelor's degree in Law and a degree in Theology. He became a prelate and a canon of Seville. There is an early reference to Rodr√≠guez de Lucero working as an inquisitor in Jerez de la Frontera, followed by a reference to him in mid-1492 in C√≥rdoba asking for a position as a schoolmaster in Almer√≠a. He may not have got that job, but in later documents he is given the title of schoolmaster. In 1495 he was a judge of confiscated assets in Jerez de la Frontera. Inquisitor The Spanish Inquisition was created in 1478 to persecute Jewish converts to Christianity and their descendants, accused of secretly retaining their ancestral faith. The Jews were expelled from Aragon and Castile in 1492, and the last secret synagogues were found and destroyed around 1500. In 1499 there were rumors among the conversos and crypto-Jewish people of C√≥rdoba that the end of the world would come in 1500. When the Inquisition heard of this, it opened an investigation. On 7 September 1499 the Grand Inquisitor, Diego Deza, appointed Diego Rodr√≠guez de Lucero inquisitor of C√≥rdoba. As described in the Catalog of the Bishop of Cordoba, \\"After the death of the first inquisitors, Diego Rodr√≠guez Lucero, schoolmaster, came from Almer√≠a in the year 1500\\". As inquisitor of the C√≥rdoba tribunal he gave his address as Encarnaci√≥n Street, very close to the Mosque‚ÄìCathedral. He launched a fierce persecution of Jews who had converted to Christianity, and created a reign of terror in Andalusia. His hardness and excesses in the trials became proverbial. The chronicler Peter Martyr d'Anghiera called him \\"the Dark One\\". Others at the time said he was an \\"exceptional monster, inspired by Lucifer.\\" G√≥mez Bravo wrote of him: Heretics before the 1481 tribunal in Seville (drawn in 1870) At this time the tribunal had jurisdiction throughout the new Archdiocese of Granada. Rodr√≠guez de Lucero undertook many investigations in the city of Granada. Lucero waited for Queen Isabel to die on 26 November 1504 before involving the archbishop of Granada, Hernando de Talavera and his family in a case of alleged heresy. Several hundred innocent people, many of them supporters of Queen Isabel, were executed at the stake. The Inquisitor General, supported by the king, suppressed all protest. Rodr√≠guez de Lucero celebrated an auto-da-f√© in C√≥rdoba in December 1504 that caused widespread fear. His testimony of the massacre said, \\"when he burned a hundred and seven men they were shouting to God and the Virgin to forgive them and saying that they never committed the sin of heresy, and called on the scribes to testify that they died as Christian Catholics and in the faith of Jesus Christ.\\" Growing opposition Due to Rodr√≠guez de Lucero's many excesses, the Count of Cabra wrote to Diego Deza, Archbishop of Seville and Grand Inquisitor, and to the municipal and ecclesiastical councils of Seville, asking that Rodr√≠guez de Lucero be removed from office. Deza rejected the allegations and would not act. Rodr√≠guez de Lucero stepped up his activities and ordered demolition of numerous houses in C√≥rdoba that he claimed were synagogues. There were many victims of new autos- da-f√©. After burning the defendants Rodr√≠guez de Lucero burned all the instruments of torture, leaving no trace of what had been done. Some nobles and knights went to King Ferdinand II of Aragon, at that time regent of Castile, but did not succeed. The King may have been influenced by the fact that all the confiscated assets became the property of the crown. The nobles even appealed to Pope Julius II. In November 1506 some nobles, including Diego Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba y Mendoza, Count of Cabra and Pedro Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba y Pacheco, Marquis of Priego, instigated a riot in which the inquisition's prison was assaulted and the prisoners released. Rodr√≠guez de Lucero fled on a mule to save his life. Downfall Francisco Jim√©nez de Cisneros became Grand Inquisitor in 1507. Cisneros imprisoned Rodr√≠guez de Lucero in 1508 and tried him. It was shown that his accusations had been false, and his victims were released from prison. Rodr√≠guez de Lucero was removed from office, and some of the houses he had destroyed were rebuilt. However, he was allowed to return to his post as canon in Seville, where he lived on for many years.

Latuharhary moved to Jakarta and worked under the Department of Home Affairs during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies to manage Moluccans in Java, being arrested three times for different reasons. He took part in the initial drafting of the Constitution of Indonesia through his membership of the BPUPK and PPKI, where he unsuccessfully championed federalism and opposed the inclusion of religion in government through the Jakarta Charter and later opposing the formation of the Ministry of Religious Affairs. Following the proclamation of independence, he was appointed Governor of Maluku, but could not take power and instead organized Moluccans in Java to join the revolutionary cause. He was for some time part of the Central Indonesian National Committee leadership and he participated in the Indonesian delegations of the Renville and the Roem‚ÄìVan Roijen Agreements. He eventually took office in 1950, where he attempted to establish the government and rebuild the ruined city of Ambon, before he was removed from his post. He died on 8 November 1959. Early life and education Latuharhary was born in Ullath, Saparua on 6 July 1900, from the couple of Jan Latuharhary and Josefin Hiarej. Jan was a school teacher in the neighboring village. Johannes initially studied at the local first grade school in Saparua which taught students Dutch, but he later moved to Ambon at the age of 9 to study at a Europeesche Lagere School there. Though the school was primarily designated for Europeans, Johannes was admitted as his father was a teacher. He studied there until 1917, before he moved to Batavia for higher education. He graduated from Batavia's Hogere Burgerschool in 1923. He later received a scholarship from the Ambonsch Studiefonds to study at the Leiden University. Latuharhary became the first Moluccan to receive a Meester in de Rechten (Master of Law) degree from Leiden in June 1927. Throughout his time at Leiden, Latuharhary did not directly participate within the student organization Perhimpoenan Indonesia (PI), but he had significant interactions with its members and is often considered as a member due to his connections with PI leaders such as Ali Sastroamidjojo and Iwa Kusumasumantri. When Latuharhary returned home, he had become a proponent of Indonesian nationalism and unity. Career =Dutch East Indies= Following his return to the Indies, Latuharhary (who had secured a recommendation letter from his professor Cornelis van Vollenhoven) was hired as an assistant at Surabaya's High Court, and he was later promoted to a judge there before being appointed chief judge in the district court at Kraksaan (in what is today Probolinggo Regency) in 1929. He also joined the Sarekat Ambon/SA (Ambon Association) and worked on its reorganization. He was also assigned as the chief editor of the SA's official newspaper Haloean, and applied for the SA to be granted legal status in 1930, though it did not receive it until 1933. Latuharhary also formed a trade cooperative for Moluccans in response to the economic hardships from the Great Depression. Several members of the SA had proposed for the organization to join the Association of Political Organisations of the Indonesian People (PPPKI), which consisted of various nationalist and local organizations such as the Indonesian National Party, Sarekat Islam and Budi Utomo. Latuharhary was, however, opposed to the inclusion of religious organizations in political movements, and the SA did not join the PPPKI initially. Eventually, however, in the SA's third congress in early 1932, the leadership made the decision to join the PPPKI. Latuharhary had previously participated in the PPPKI's congress in January 1932, where he delivered his preamble Azab Sengsara Kepoelauan Maloekoe (Suffering of the Mollucas) which described economic devastation by the Dutch East India Company. He also wrote that the Dutch education system for the Moluccans was geared towards creating \\"scribes and clerks, soldiers and sailors\\". Throughout this time, Latuharhary had leaned towards a more federalist structure for the future Indonesian state, in accordance to others such as Sam Ratulangi, Tan Malaka and Mohammad Hatta. In 1932, his preamble was published as a book, though it was censured by the colonial government. He later resigned from being chief judge following an ultimatum from the colonial government to pick between his job or being part of the nationalist movement, and he became a lawyer instead. As an advocate, one of his first cases was suing sugar factories for taking over local farmers' land. Latuharhary won the case and gained local renown in East Java, and he was elected a member of the Regentschapsraad (municipal council) of Kraksaan. Latuharhary moved with his family to Malang in 1934 and later was elected to East Java's Provinciale Raad (provincial council). He was a member of the council until 1942. Latuharhary was later named as chairman of the Jong Ambon (Ambon Youth) upon the organization's founding in 1936. In 1939, Latuharhary ran for a seat in the Volksraad, campaigning in Ambon. Throughout the campaigns, Latuharhary spread his nationalist views and set up or restored several SA branches. In the end, he lost to a candidate from the Regentenbond (nobles' association). He later joined Parindra, a pro-independence political party. =Japanese occupation and early independence= Following the Japanese invasion and takeover of the Dutch East Indies, Latuharhary and other Parindra leaders were arrested and imprisoned. After around four months, his wife managed to convince a Japanese admiral to arrange for their release. In September 1942, Latuharhary moved to the recently renamed Jakarta, where he took care of the wives and children of Moluccan and Timorese soldiers who were arrested or had evacuated to Australia. After moving to Jakarta, Latuharhary also began working for the Japanese under the Department of Home Affairs to manage the Moluccans in Java, and held responsibility for their actions. In 1944, a group of Ambonese including Latuharhary were arrested by the Kenpeitai and brought to Bogor as they were suspected of espionage for the Allied forces, and due to the fact that Latuharhary had partly used his position within the Japanese administration for political purposes. However, his wife and two others again managed to convince a Japanese Navy commander to arrange for their release. In late 1944, he was again arrested after a Moluccan prisoner escaped from a prison. Japanese authorities at the time were particularly suspicious of Ambonese after the Battle of Morotai and the strategic bombing of Ambon in 1944, further fueled by Allied espionage operations in the Moluccas led by Ambonese Julius Tahija. By early 1945, the Japanese began promising Indonesian independence, and the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (BPUPK) was formed with Latuharhary as a member representing the Moluccas. Latuharhary had called a meeting of Ambonese leaders in Java in May 1945 and informed them that Japanese authorities wanted the Ambonese to stop resistance activities and instead participate in the independence movement. At the BPUPK, Latuharhary proposed the formation of a federal state over a unitary state, but the proposal was shot down after only 2 out of 19 members of the constitutional body voted for federalism. He was also opposed to the inclusion of the seven words dengan kewajiban menjalankan syariat Islam bagi pemeluknya (an obligation of sharia for Muslims) due to its consequences for non-Muslims and to its impact on customary laws. Furthermore, Latuharhary also opposed a proposition by Wahid Hasyim that only Muslims would be allowed to become President and/or Vice President, noting that the majority Christian regions in Indonesia would not be willing to be part of an Islamic state. The proposal was also opposed by secular nationalists such as Wongsonegoro and . Eventually, Latuharhary (alongside the other Christian representative Alexander Andries Maramis) yielded following Sukarno's request. Latuharhary was further appointed to the BPUPK's successor, the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) on 14 August. The clauses preferring Islam were later removed from the Constitution of Indonesia and the Pancasila. This was preceded by a visit from a Japanese navy officer to Muhammad Hatta on the evening of 17 August (shortly after the proclamation of Indonesian independence that morning, where Latuharhary was present), warning Hatta that Christian nationalists from Eastern Indonesia \\"prefer to stand outside the Republic of Indonesia\\" unless the seven words were removed. Hatta called an emergency meeting and managed to convince the Muslim nationalists to yield on the clauses, and the assembly further removed several terms and clauses which was seen as favoring Islam. Latuharhary was also opposed to the formation of a religious ministry and proposed it be included as a bureau under the Ministry of Education and Culture instead ‚Äì the formation failed at first, though a religious ministry was eventually formed in January 1946. =Revolution= Latuharhary was appointed Governor of Maluku in the PPKI's 19 August 1945 meeting, alongside governors for seven other formed provinces. This appointment, however, did not come with any administrative duties as Latuharhary was unable to travel to the Moluccas at the time, due to Australian troops already establishing themselves in the region shortly after the surrender of Japan. Later on, Latuharhary joined the Central Indonesian National Committee (KNIP) and was elected as one of its deputy speakers in the body's first session. On 17 October, Latuharhary handed over KNIP's leadership to Sutan Sjahrir, after he and Sartono failed to defend the older leadership against a motion led by Sukarni to replace KNIP's leadership. Latuharhary formed the Angkatan Pemuda Indonesia Ambon/API-Ambon (Ambonese Indonesian Youth Movement) on 5 September. He then called for the community leaders of the Moluccan communities in Java for a meeting in Jakarta on 6 October 1945. The outcome of the meeting was to support the independence movement. Soon afterwards, however, the Dutch returned under the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration with KNIL soldiers, a number of whom were Ambonese. This resulted in significant distrust of the Ambonese in Java, and there were a considerable number of Ambonese who sided with the Dutch instead of with the nationalists. In the Moluccas itself, recruitment of Ambonese soldiers to the KNIL resumed as soon as the Dutch regained control of the region, and in Jakarta clashes occurred between the nationalist armed forces and KNIL's Ambonese soldiers, with reprisal attacks against Ambonese civilians in Jakarta. Latuharhary issued an appeal to the Ambonese to join the nationalist cause on 9 October, but on 13 October a nationalist-affiliated group issued a declaration calling for guerrilla and economic warfare against the Dutch, the Eurasians and the Ambonese, complicating affairs. Latuharhary spoke with Sukarno, requesting to be granted authority in Java and Sumatra to be able to manage Moluccans there, but he was initially denied. Later, Hatta intervened and Latuharhary's request was granted with the condition that the authority would be transferred to another appointed official upon Latuharhary's departure to Maluku. Shortly afterwards, Latuharhary issued another call for Moluccans to join the revolutionary cause and later in December 1945 established offices in urban centers across Java to arrange for the safety and return of Moluccans. USS Renville in January 1948, prior to the Renville Agreement Aside from those in the KNIL, there were Moluccan soldiers fighting on the side of the Indonesian government ‚Äì notably, in Surabaya, where the Ambonese youth had formed the Pemoeda Repoeblik Indonesia Maloekoe/PRIM (Republic of Indonesia Moluccan Youth), which fought during the Battle of Surabaya. These youths would later form the Pattimura Division in October 1946, to which Latuharhary was Chief Adviser. Latuharhary also arranged for a small expedition to the Moluccas ‚Äì which briefly seized power in Buru until Dutch authorities sent reinforcements from Ambon and captured or killed the pro-Indonesian soldiers. Due to the establishment of the United States of Indonesia in the Linggadjati Agreement, Sukarno abolished the Governor of Maluku's office in July 1947. Following a United Nations-brokered ceasefire, Latuharhary was part of the Indonesian delegation under Mohammad Roem which eventually led to the Roem‚ÄìVan Roijen Agreement in May 1949. Latuharhary also pushed for the Indonesian government to recognize the State of East Indonesia as part of the United States of Indonesia, which it did in January 1948 with Latuharhary being sent as the envoy. Politically, Latuharhary was affiliated with the Indonesian National Party (PNI), where he was a member of its central leadership in the organizational section. Within the party, he was considered part of a \\"Kaigun Group\\" ‚Äì largely comprising former law students in the Netherlands. In December 1948, following a split within the PNI over negotiations between Hatta and the Dutch, Latuharhary left the PNI and joined the Great Indonesia Unity Party (PIR) under Wongsonegoro. Governorship After the Dutch‚ÄìIndonesian Round Table Conference and the recognition of Indonesian sovereignty, Latuharhary assumed his post as the Governor of Maluku following the invasion of Ambon and the suppression of the Republic of South Maluku (RMS). Latuharhary arrived in an Ambon devastated by fighting between TNI and the RMS on 12 December 1950. Latuharhary began reestablishing the government, recruiting former SA members and some former colonial civil servants to fill in government positions. He also eliminated the South Maluku area and split it into two halves: the Central Maluku and Southeast Maluku regencies. The reconstruction of Ambon also commenced at the start of his term. Throughout his term, Maluku was placed under a \\"State of War Emergency\\" until 30 July 1952, when it was converted to a \\"State of War\\" just in Ambon and Ceram. Latuharhary pushed for the status to be removed in entirety. Latuharhary's tenure as governor ended following the split between the PIR and the ruling Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet, which was followed by pressure from PNI and Masyumi to replace Latuharhary. Eventually, the cabinet opted to replace Latuharhary with Indonesian Socialist Party member , and Latuharhary was reassigned to the Ministry of Home Affairs. Latuharhary maintained his post until 1955. Family Latuharhary married Yet Pattyrajawane on 26 September 1931, during his time at Kraksaan. The couple had seven children. Latuharhary was a Protestant Christian. Death Latuharhary died on 8 November 1959, after having fallen in a coma on 6 November. He fell comatose in his house as he was preparing to depart for a church meeting, and he was brought to the Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. Previously, he had just returned from an official trip to Riau. I. O. Nanulaitta, Latuharhary's biographer, wrote that Latuharhary's assignment in the Ministry of Home Affairs did not carry any particular tasks and had pressured him psychologically ‚Äì with both Nanulaitta and Latuharhary's brother-in-law noting that Latuharhary would become pensive often. He was buried in the Kalibata Heroes Cemetery the following day, with fellow Ambonese nationalist leader Johannes Leimena delivering his eulogy. Legacy After Latuharhary's death, the Government of Indonesia awarded him the Bintang Mahaputera Utama. A bridge and a road in Jakarta, alongside a road in Ambon, was named after him, in addition to a cargo vessel. The vessel was ca. 14,000 dwt general B-454 class cargo motor ship, built at Szczecin in Poland and handed over to her Indonesian owners early in October 1964. The class included as well two more, slightly smaller (ca. 10.500 dtw) ships for the same Indonesian owners - the mv \\"Sam Ratulangi\\" and the mv \\"Hadji Angus Salim\\", handed over late in 1962. There is also a \\"Mr. J. Latuharhary Foundation\\" based in Ambon which published a newspaper titled Sinar Harapan. In 1965, the cargo vessel Johannes Latuharhary was briefly detained in the United States during a period of tensions with Indonesia. Australian historian Richard Chauvel wrote that Latuharhary was \\"the first Ambonese leader to formulate an argument for Ambon's inclusion in an independent Indonesia and to consider Ambonese as Indonesians\\". One of his successors as the Governor of Maluku, , wrote the following about Latuharhary: Padang also credited Latuharhary with establishing the foundations for governance in Maluku during the difficult times of the RMS rebellion.

The song is a slower and more melodic piece, which features the prominent use of chorus- and tremolo-effects on guitar. Hendrix uses an idealized feminine figure that recurs in several of his lyrics. Commentators have seen the song as representative of his post-Band of Gypsys musical direction. \\"Hey Baby\\" was in development for over two years and Hendrix had recorded several demo and jam versions, before debuting it in concert on April 25, 1970. On July 1, he recorded a version live at the new Electric Lady Studios in New York City. It was one of the tracks Hendrix proposed for his planned, but never completed, fourth studio album. In 1971, longtime Hendrix recording engineer Eddie Kramer, and drummer Mitch Mitchell selected the Electric Lady version as the closing track for Rainbow Bridge. The song received mainly positive comments from critics, who saw it as expressing hope, along with new guitar textures. In 1997, \\"Hey Baby\\" was included on First Rays of the New Rising Sun, the most comprehensive attempt at presenting Hendrix's unfinished album. During the 1970 The Cry of Love Tour, Hendrix performed the song regularly. Several live recordings have been officially released along with videos of Hendrix performing it in concert. Compostion and lyrics As early as October 1968 at TTG Studios in Hollywood, California, Hendrix began recording demos for a song titled \\"The New Rising Sun\\". Although it is substantially a different song, Hendrix biographer John McDermott believed that \\"Hey Baby\\" was developed from ideas found in \\"The New Rising Sun\\". In the months following the TTG sessions, Hendrix attempted more recordings of the song at the Record Plant in New York City. Preliminarily titled \\"Hey Gypsy Boy\\" and \\"Hey Country Boy\\", they were closer to \\"Hey Baby\\" musically and lyrically. Hendrix used a minor-key chord progression reminiscent of \\"All Along the Watchtower\\", but they lacked the distinctive guitar intro section to \\"Hey Baby\\". In February 1970, Hendrix jammed on an informal \\"Hey Baby\\" at the Record Plant, with drummer Buddy Miles and percussionist Juma Sultan. Hendrix sang the song live and included some Spanish flamenco-style flourishes on electric guitar. After parting ways with Miles, Hendrix began preparing songs with original Jimi Hendrix Experience drummer Mitch Mitchell and Band of Gypsys bassist Billy Cox, for the upcoming The Cry of Love Tour. McDermott described Cox's and Mitchell's approaches as \\"delicate interplay... more subtle and intricate\\", which was needed for R&B-influenced; songs, such as \\"Hey Baby\\". The trio debuted the song at the Forum in Los Angeles on April 25, 1970. Unlike the later studio version, Hendrix begins the song with solo guitar reminiscent of \\"the acoustic-guitar introductions found in Spanish flamenco music as, unaccompanied, Hendrix explores arabesques and altered scales\\", according to music writer Keith Shadwick. The solo guitar became a regular feature of Hendrix's live performances of \\"Hey Baby\\" and its length varied to suit his mood and the audience reaction. Hendrix chronicler Harry Shapiro described Hendrix's guitar sound as having a \\"pitch and sway like waves gently rolling against a deserted sandy beach in early morning\\". During late-1969 and 1970, Hendrix was making extensive use of a Uni-Vibe guitar effects unit, which is able to emulate the wavering chorus- and tremolo-effects of a Leslie speaker. This effect had previously been used on the demos for \\"The New Rising Sun\\". Writers Dave Whitehill and Dave Rubin commented: \\"the thick chorusing does give it a lot more cohesiveness and depth [which a dry or straight sound would lack] it's very effective in the introduction, where the guitar has to carry the full musical weight itself.\\" \\"Hey Baby\\" is composed of an intro section and a main section with a bridge. The intro is one of the longest in a Hendrix song, lasting 51 measures. In the intro, Hendrix takes a chromatic approach with guitar runs and chords at a moderately slow tempo of 66 beats per minute (bpm). After several key and time signature changes, he lands on A minor, which begins the chord progression at a somewhat faster tempo of 81 bpm for the remainder of the song: A minor‚ÄìG‚ÄìF‚ÄìD. Lyrically, \\"Hey Baby\\" echoes a recurring Hendrix theme of an idealized feminine figure, as heard in \\"May This Be Love\\", \\"Little Wing\\", and \\"Angel\\". Journalist Charles Shaar Murray felt that the figure goes beyond \\"Hendrix's own personal saviour, but [as] a redeemer for all of humanity\\". Shapiro also described the hope of \\"a promised land, a new beginning\\": Poet David Henderson called the R&B-style; bridge section or refrain, which begins with \\"Girl, I'd like to come along\\", \\"the essence of the lyrics of this deceptively straightforward song\\". Recording and studio releases The released studio version of \\"Hey Baby\\" was recorded at Hendrix's newly constructed Electric Lady Studios in New York City's Greenwich Village on July 1, 1970. Supporting Hendrix on guitar and vocal were his regular Cry of Love touring partners; Cox on bass guitar and Mitchell on drums. Sultan and an unnamed second percussionist participated in the recording. The vocal was recorded live and Hendrix never completed a final finished vocal track; Hendrix rejected an earlier take of the song, in which he abandoned his vocal because it was flat. During the July 1 session, \\"Hey Baby\\" was preceded by \\"Bolero\\", an instrumental on which Hendrix had been working. \\"Bolero\\" also incorporates some Spanish flamenco-style flourishes and McDermott believed that Hendrix intended the instrumental and \\"Hey Baby\\" to flow together as a medley. In mid-1970, Hendrix included the song with the title \\"The New Rising Sun [Hey Baby]\\" on a list of potential tracks for his planned fourth studio album. When Mitchell and recording engineer Eddie Kramer were reviewing songs for The Cry of Love, Hendrix's first posthumous album release of studio recordings in 1971, \\"Hey Baby\\" was considered, though ultimately was unused. Instead, it became the closing track on Rainbow Bridge, the second posthumous album produced by Kramer and Mitchell in 1971. McDermott noted: \\"Because a finished vocal was never recorded, Jimi's original live take, including his question to Kramer 'Is the microphone on?', was left forward in the mix to convey the song's status as a work in progress.\\" Reprise Records issued the album in October 1971 in the US and the following month in the UK; it performed moderately well in the album charts, reaching numbers 15 on the US Billboard 200 and 16 on the UK Official Albums Chart. For several years, the studio version of \\"Hey Baby\\" was unavailable because Rainbow Bridge had gone out-of-print and the album was never released on CD. However, when Experience Hendrix, the family-run successor to Hendrix's recorded legacy gained control, \\"Hey Baby\\" was included on the 1997 compilation album, First Rays of the New Rising Sun. The album was the most complete attempt at realizing Hendrix's fourth album and the first to use one of his proposed titles. In 2001, the song was included on the compilation album Voodoo Child: The Jimi Hendrix Collection. An alternate mix, with \\"Bolero\\", was included on the posthumous box set West Coast Seattle Boy: The Jimi Hendrix Anthology in 2010. In 2014, the original Rainbow Bridge album was reissued in both CD and LP formats, with \\"Hey Baby\\" as the eighth track on the CD. Critical reception \\"Hey Baby\\" has been viewed favorably by most music journalists. In a contemporary review of Rainbow Bridge for Rolling Stone magazine, Tony Glover described \\"Hey Baby\\" as \\"simple but evocative... It‚Äôs a benediction and a hoping at once\\". He added that it is \\"filled with a pure lonesome yearning and introspection that often got squeezed out in favor of things with more flash\\". Henderson called it \\"the song that signified his [Hendrix's] new musical head direction\\" and Shapiro felt that it \\"might be called his theme song for the seventies\\". David Moskowitz commented on Hendrix's guitar playing: \\"Throughout the song, Jimi's guitar work was an exhibition of his skills at full strength. He made use of the Uni-Vibe guitar effect to enhance his sound and put some teeth into his guitar work.\\" On the other hand, Murray felt that the effect was overused and faulted the recording: \\"It's a shame that 'Hey Baby (The Land of the New Rising Sun)' was never recorded properly, because the song was clearly of considerable importance to Hendrix. The Rainbow Bridge version is diffident and tentative, little more than a sketch.\\" However, he described the song \\"as winsomely wistful as anything Hendrix ever wrote\\". Other recordings A demo titled \\"The New Rising Sun\\", recorded at the TTG Studios in Hollywood on October 28, 1968, was released on West Coast Seattle Boy: The Jimi Hendrix Anthology (2010). It is a solo instrumental, with multiple guitar overdubs and Hendrix on the drums. In an album review for AllMusic, Sean Westergaard commented: \\"'New Rising Sun' might be the jewel of the set. Briefly released in heavily edited form on the ill-conceived and atrocious Voodoo Soup compilation, it's a really cool studio collaboration between Jimi and Eddie Kramer that's like a cross between 'And the Gods Made Love' from Electric Ladyland and 'Little Wing' [from Axis: Bold as Love].\\" Another demo with the title \\"Hey Gypsy Boy\\", recorded at the Record Plant in New York City on March 18, 1969, was issued on People, Hell and Angels (2013). Hendrix provides a vocal and was backed by drummer Buddy Miles and an unnamed bassist. In a separate album review, Westergaard noted \\"'Hey Gypsy Boy' is very closely related to 'Hey Baby', and may have been an early version. On this cut, Jimi's whammy bar work is quite interesting and not his standard dive-bomb approach.\\" During The Cry of Love Tour in 1970, \\"Hey Baby\\" was added to Hendrix's repertoire. It was one of only two post-Band of Gypsys songs alongside \\"Freedom\\" that the trio performed regularly. Hendrix sometimes introduced the song as \\"The New Rising Sun\\", including at Berkeley. *April 25, 1970 ‚Äì The Forum, Los Angeles: Not officially released, but an amateur recording of the entire concert is available at the official Hendrix website.

Their performances and music challenge traditional understandings of art classifications and explore queerness through futuristic video, gender-bending costumes, and vocals and instrumentals drawing inspiration from a variety of musical genres.  History  = Early years = After meeting through artist friend Andy Meerow as undergraduate students in colleges in the Northeast, Gideon at Wesleyan University and O'Neill at Hampshire College, the duo experimented with improvisation, hip hop, and comedy, with projects including a rock opera with characters from Saved by the Bell. They explored a variety of musical styles, at one point entering a Battle of the Bands competition with songs and costume changes for five different fake groups performing a range from bossa nova to acid rock. In 2003, they moved to Chicago's DIY art space Texas Ballroom and formed the art band Princess. Their early sound was described by Sick Room Records as a \\"gauntlet of experimental math-rock,\\" with a wide variety of style inspirations and dozens of instrumental voices. Exploring ideas of femininity and masculinity, the pair frequently wore tutus, dresses, leotards, and other garments typically associated with women, incorporating gender fluidity into their performances. For the release of their 2005 self-titled album, the band toured nationally and shared stages with The Aluminum Group, Scream Club, Barr, and the Coughs, to promote their work. Reviewers commented on the album's genre-defying qualities, noting its experimental, mutant, and idiosyncratic characteristics and struggling to compare it to other contemporary music acts. = Hiatus = Princess dissolved in 2006. During the group's hiatus, both Gideon and O'Neill pursued other art- based paths. O'Neill moved to Brooklyn and was active with indie bands Hirsute, MEN, Ladybug Transistor, The Point,Grateful Dead tribute band, High Time, and CRICKETS with JD Samson and Roddy Bottum. Gideon made the switch into visual arts performing his animated video operas at art museums around the world including at Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston (2015), Moderna Museet in Stockholm, Sweden (2014), Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (2013), and New Museum of Contemporary Art. = Reinitiation = In 2017, O'Neill and Gideon reunited for a collaborative EP based on the Four Elements. As Gideon says, \\"Towards the end of working on this, we looked at each other and said, ‚ÄòI guess Princess is back together.‚Äô‚Äù The group's next project, a video album and live performance piece, continued their experimental thrust while responding to the political climate during its writing. Gideon and O'Neill cite the sci-fi genre, the cultural power of MTV, concept pieces like Deltron 3030, and activist movements like the Women's March and #metoo as inspiration for \\"Out There.\\" Continuing their earlier work engaging with themes of gender, the group stated the album put forward \\"the role men ought to be playing during the current cultural reckoning of misogyny.\\" This feminist political direction was reinforced in the rock opera, as the title card for the performance's video reads, ‚Äú2028: Proclaiming Earth to be a misogynistic dystopia, the art-pop super duo Princess prepares a rocket ship to find a better world. As only two white men could.‚Äù Narrative-forward lyrics present battles with misogyny and toxic masculinity, searching for a futuristic utopia. Accompanying stop-action animation showed the duo exploring a vividly hued outer space, while energetic rap overlays electric guitar and keyboard. Gender-defying costumes, at times recalling garments worn during the group's earlier work, extend themes of queerness and the power of the Divine Feminine explored throughout the video. Acknowledging the problematic nature of a male duo speaking on such a female-centered topic, Gideon and O'Neill invited collaborators, which included rock band TEEN, artist Jennifer Meyers, and singer JD Samson. Performed in costume with pre-recorded video and live music, the 16-song, 55-minute album premiered at the Andy Warhol Museum. With a focus on reaching art museum goers, many stops on their tour were booked at cultural institutions, including performances at 21c Museum Hotels, The Bass Museum, Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts, MIT List Visual Arts Center, Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland, Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, New Museum of Contemporary Art, and Wexner Center for the Arts.

Reception  Max Mertens, writing for Pitchfork, called the album Mighty's \\"most cohesive and narratively ambitious project to date\\". The album won the 2019 Polaris Music Prize, making Mighty the first hip-hop artist and first black woman to win the award.

She learned how to play shogi from her father as a young girl, but started to become really serious about the game as a second-grade elementary school student. Her father was fairly strict so she was not allowed to watch much television as a child, with the exception being when her family watched the recorded games from the NHK Cup TV Shogi Tournament together weekly.

She is a member of the FRETILIN party.  Personal life  Concei√ß√£o was born in Uatucarbau, Portuguese Timor, the daughter of Beatriz Ara√∫jo and Agustinho da Costa Pinto. She spent much of her childhood in Uatucarbau, Viqueque. As a daughter of a nobleman, she had access to a privileged education. From 1966 to 1971, she attended primary school at Oscar Ruas College in Ossu, and from 1971 to 1972 went to a pre-secondary school in Dili. Finally, from 1973 to 1975 she took a business administration course at the Prof. Silva Cunha Technical School Institute in Dili. In 1977, she married Reinaldo Freitas Belo (Kilik Wae Ga'e). He died in 1984 under unspecified circumstances, after he had led an unsuccessful overthrow attempt against the FALINTIL commander Xanana Gusm√£o. It is uncertain whether he was killed by FALINTIL members or by Indonesian forces. The marriage produced a daughter and a son. In her second marriage to Manuel Le√£o Gaio (Gelson Black), she had another daughter and son. Concei√ß√£o speaks the Portuguese, Tetum, Naueti and Makasae languages fluently.  Career  In 1975, Concei√ß√£o joined the newly established Organiza√ß√£o Popular de Mulheres Timorense (Popular Organisation of East Timorese Women) (OPMT), the women's organization of FRETILIN. At the time of the Indonesian invasion of East Timor in December 1975, she fled to the mountains. Here Concei√ß√£o began teaching women who did not have the opportunity to study. This included reading and writing as well as sewing and embroidery. Concei√ß√£o became leader of OPMT in Suco Bahatata, a village in the Uatucarbau Subdistrict. From 1976 to 1986 Lalo Imin, as she was called at that time, took part in the guerrilla struggle against the occupiers. In 1976 she was appointed Assistant to Zone 1912 in Baguia, and from 1977 to 1978 she was a commissariat delegate for the Eastern sector. Her husband Kilik Wai Gae was at the time commander of the Second Sector. In 1978 Concei√ß√£o, with Xanana Gusm√£o, was a member of the group that built the resistance network in Lospalos. In 1981, Concei√ß√£o was made a commando assistant. She changed her resistance name to Wairaha Gae Imin for safety reasons. In 1984, her husband was killed, and she herself was captured by the Indonesian army and taken to a town. Although under surveillance, she joined the inner-city resistance network, and was re-arrested in 1986 in Ossu. She was imprisoned in Baucau for two years. After her release, her freedom of movement was limited and she was suspected of being a member of the \\"movement of order disturbances\\" (GPK). In fact, Concei√ß√£o remained active in the resistance and disguised this by volunteering for the church, as she delivered religious education in the Viqueque parish. Her family's experiences are well-known in East Timor, and her story featured in the film The Uprise of the mauberes (Tetum: Maubere oan sira hamrik ba; Portuguese: O levante dos mauberes). Under the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, Concei√ß√£o was appointed deputy district administrator for Viqueque. She held the office from November 2000 to September 2001. From 2001 to 2006 she was elected representative for the Viqueque district in the Central Committee of FRETILIN. In the first National Parliament of East Timor, sworn in on 20 May 2002, Concei√ß√£o was Vice Minister of International Administration. Dismissed from that role on 4 March 2003, on 6 March 2003, she was sworn in as Vice-Minister of State Administration, and held that office until mid 2005. From 10 July 2006 to 8 August 2007, she was Vice Minister of Primary and Secondary Education. At the second National Congress of FRETILIN 2006, she was elected to the judicial commission of FRETILIN, to which she belonged until 2011, including a term as vice-president. Concei√ß√£o was elected to the National Parliament at the 2007 East Timorese parliamentary election, and took office on the 30 July 2007. She became a member of the Commission for Health, Education and Culture (Commission F), which was also responsible for veterans and gender equality from 2012. In the parliamentary elections in East Timor in 2017, Concei√ß√£o ran for FRETILIN on position 5 of the ballot and again returned to the national parliament. She was again a member of the Commission for Health, Education, Culture, Veterans and Gender Equality (Commission F) and substitute delegate of the national group of the National Parliament at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP). In the parliamentary elections in 2018 Concei√ß√£o was in position 35 on the ballot, and was unsuccessful at the election.

His father died when he was six, and he was adopted by a relative. Though he was ambitious to acquire an education, his opportunities to do so were meager given the schooling provided to farmers boys in the district school at that time. Stone was a major landowner along High Street in Dedham and lived at what is today 19 Mount Vernon Street in Dedham. He married Elizabeth Barrows on October 10, 1839. Business career He settled in Dedham, Massachusetts and engaged in a number of business pursuits. By 1833, he was largely engaged in the baking and grocery business, real estate and building, and for many years was the leading auctioneer in that part of Norfolk County. He was especially active in building residences in the east village of Dedham and labored earnestly to advance the interests of that part of the town. Agriculture From early youth, Stone manifested a lively interest in agriculture and horticultural pursuits. He wrote many valuable papers on fruit culture. Political career Stone represented Dedham, Massachusetts as a Republican in the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1861, 1862, 1863, and 1869. He served on the committee that established Brookdale Cemetery. Philanthropy It was said that benevolence was one of Stone's leading characteristics and no one was ever turned empty handed from his door. He donated the land upon which Dedham High School and Stone Park were built.Chapters 64 and 65 of the Acts of 1957 He also He donated a waiting room at the railroad stop, Stone Haven station, next to his home. He was also a great supporter of the men of Dedham who served in the American Civil War. During the war, it was said that no person was more interested in the welfare of the soldiers than Stone. He sacrificed his business interests to visit the soldiers in the field and made arrangements to provide for their families. After the war, he donated a choice plot of land upon a hill and a monument to their sacrifice in Brookdale Cemetery to the local Grand Army of the Republic chapter.

The Gorsedd is most prominent at the National Eisteddfod of Wales where it is responsible for the main ceremonies held. Name The word gorsedd (plural gorseddau) means \\"throne\\" in Welsh. Equivalent terms exist in Cornish (gorsedh) and Breton (goursez). When the term is used without qualification, it generally refers to the national Gorsedd of Wales, namely Gorsedd Cymru. Note that when referred to as simply \\"the Gorsedd\\" in Welsh, the initial g is dropped due to soft mutation, resulting in yr Orsedd. Other gorseddau exist outside of Wales, such as the Cornish Gorsedh KernowByrth Gorseth Kernow ‚Äì The Gorseth of the Bards of Cornwall and the Breton Goursez Vreizh.Home Until 2019, Gorsedd Cymru was known as Gorsedd Beirdd Ynys Prydain (\\"the Gorsedd of the Bards of the Island of Britain\\"), or Gorsedd y Beirdd (\\"the Gorsedd of the bards\\") for short. At the Chairing Ceremony of 2019 National Eisteddfod, Archdruid Myrddin ap Dafydd announced that the society was to change its name to Gorsedd Cymru (\\"the Gorsedd of Wales\\"). This was deemed more \\"suitable for the modern Wales\\" and less \\"misleading\\" as the Gorsedd consists of more than just bards. The name change was approved by the Board of the Gorsedd, the Gorsedd membership and the Court of the National Eisteddfod. In spite of this, some felt unhappy with the decision, with academic Simon Brooks declaring that \\"227 years of history are in the balance\\", calling for a public enquiry into the change. History The Gorsedd was originally founded as Gorsedd Beirdd Ynys Prydain in 1792 by Edward Williams commonly known as Iolo Morganwg, who also invented much of its ritual, supposedly based on the activities of the ancient Celtic Druidry.Gorsedd y Beridd ‚Äì Hanes (History). Accessed 5 December 2009. Welsh language page only. Nowadays, much of its ritual has Christian influence, and was given further embellishment in the 1930s by Archdruid Cynan (Albert Evans- Jones, 1950‚Äì1954 and 1963‚Äì1966). The Gorsedd made its first appearance at the Eisteddfod at the Ivy Bush Inn in Carmarthen in 1819, and its close association with the festival has continued since then. The fictitious origin of these ceremonies was established by Professor G.J. Williams in works touching on Iolo Morganwg.Traddodiad Llenyddol Morgannwg, 1948 Ranks There are three ranks of membership in the Gorsedd. Until 2012 they were, in ascending order of honour: * Ovates, who wear green robes, * Bards, who wear blue robes, and * Druids, who wear white robes.Gorsedd y Beirdd ‚Äì Urddo (Order) However, since 2012 all these ranks are treated as equal, with new members all being called 'druids' and with the colour of their robes reflecting the area of their contribution rather than an ascending order of honour. The head of a Gorsedd is known as an Archdderwydd (English: Archdruid), and wears a golden robe, and is elected for a term of three years, and is responsible for conducting the Gorsedd ceremonies during Eisteddfod week. These ceremonies are held to honour literary achievements amongst Welsh poets and prose writers. Admission In the Welsh Gorsedd, a person may become an ovate or a bard by passing an examination in the Welsh language.Gorsedd Cymru ‚Äì Arholiadau (Exams) Druids may only be nominated by existing druids. Often a new inductee will take a pseudonym, called a \\"bardic name.\\" To become an Archdruid, an individual must have won one of the Eisteddfod's three highest awards: the Crown, the Chair, or the Literature Medal. In 2003, Robyn L√©wis (Robyn Ll≈∑n) became the first winner of the Literature Medal to be elected Archdruid, and the first Archdruid to be elected by a vote of all Gorseddogion. Christine James was the first woman to become Archdruid of Wales and also the first woman to become Cofiadur (Recorder) of the Gorsedd. People are also made ovates or druids as an honour to reward their contributions to Welsh culture. In 1946, the future Queen Elizabeth II was inducted into the Welsh Gorsedd at the National Eisteddfod of WalesGorsedd of the Bards , though in 2019 Archdruid Myrddin ap Dafydd declared that the Queen was now ineligible because she does not speak Welsh (since in 2006 \\"it was made clear you had to speak Welsh to be a member\\").North Wales Chronicle In recent years, Ron Davies,His bardic name is Ron o FachenBBC News UK Politics  Davies dons druid robes Rowan Williams,BBC NEWS UK  When a druid isn't a druid; his bardic name is Rowan ap Neurin.

Ceremony Three Gorsedd ceremonies are held during the Eisteddfod week: * The Crowning (Coroni) of the Bard (awarded to the poet judged best in the competitions in free meter) * The Awarding of the Prose Medal (for the winner of the Prose competitions) * The Chairing (Cadeirio) of the Bard (for the best long poem in traditional strict metre). During these ceremonies, the Archdruid and the members of the Gorsedd gather on the Eisteddfod stage in their ceremonial robes. When the Archdruid reveals the identity of the winning poet, the 'Corn Gwlad' (a trumpet) calls the people together and the Gorsedd Prayer is chanted (the Corn Gwlad symbolically calls everyone from the four corners of Wales). The Archdruid partially withdraws a sword from its sheath three times, and cries \\"A oes heddwch?\\" (\\"Is there peace?\\"), to which the assembly reply \\"Heddwch\\" (\\"Peace\\"). The sword is then placed fully back into its sheath, and hence is never drawn fully. Then the Horn of Plenty is presented to the Archdruid by a young local married woman, who urges him to drink the 'wine of welcome'. A young girl presents him with a basket of 'flowers from the land and soil of Wales' and a floral dance is performed, based on a pattern of flower gathering from the fields. Symbolism Symbol of Gorsedd, the Awen. The symbol commonly used to represent a Gorsedd is a triple line, the middle line upright and the outer two slanted towards the top of the centre, thus: .Barddas of Iolo Morganwg, Vol I ‚Äì The Sacred Symbol This symbol, called \\"awen\\", is often explained as representing the sun..

Many South African gangs began, and still exist, in urban areas. This includes cities like Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg. History Gangs rose to prominence in South Africa due to the Group Areas Act, where rural residents were forcefully migrated. This caused an increase in poverty in coloured communities. In the 1960s and 1970s, coloured residents of Cape Town started forming gangs in Cape Flats and other areas. This is due to the breakdown of social control of the inner city, which caused severe unemployment and social marginalization. Former multi-racial suburbs of Cape Town, such as District Six, were either purged of unlawful residents or demolished. In Johannesburg in the mid-1950s and early 1960s, many African communities were relocated and resettled, in Soweto in the Meadowlands and Diepkloof.Lenasia and Laudium became the hub of South Africa's most notorious yet secretive mafia family globally known as RfMO(Rasool Family Mafia Organisation)originally from Pietersburg sanctuary of the infamous SAMA (South African Mafia Association) founded by Goolam Rasool aka Moonshie)in the early 1900s. Western Soweto complained of severe crime and juvenile delinquency during the 1960s. By the early 1960s gang violence escalated, which was counteracted by police action. In 2013, 12% of the 2,580 murders in Western Cape were gang-related, which was an 86% increase from 2012. Children as young as the age of 14 were arrested on gang-related murder charges. In 2019, 900 people have been murdered in the first half of the year in communities in Cape Flats in the Western Cape.  Typology  The Safety Lab has identified four distinct categories that Cape Town based gangs can be divided into: street gangs, crews, cliques, and prison gangs. = Street gangs = The largest and best known gang type in Cape Town are the street gangs that are mostly associated with poorer coloured communities. They tend to have hierarchical command structures and are thought to derive most of their income from the illicit drug trade. In Cape Town the two largest gangs are The Americans and the Hard Livings which function as umbrella organisations for many smaller gangs that are allied with the two super gangs. Smaller gangs in Cape Town that might be allied to one of the two larger umbrella gangs include Young Dixie Boys, Clever Kids, Naughty Boys, the Junky Funky Kids, Respectable Peacefuls, Wonder Kids, School Boys and Yuru Cats. = Prison gangs = Prison gangs in South Africa consist mostly of the Numbers Gangs, a grouping of prison based gangs named after the different numbers they are named after; namely the 26s, 27s, and 28s. These gangs tend to be highly structured with strong hierarchical command structures and high levels of organisation.

The palazzo is located in the San Polo district, overlooking the Grand Canal at the confluence with Rio della Frescada, between Palazzo Dandolo Paolucci and Palazzo Caotorta-Angaran. History The present palazzo was built in the 18th century on the site of a previous Gothic building built no later than the 15th century. The palace was renovated by an unknown architect: many historians of Venetian architecture, including Elena Bassi, attribute the authorship to Giorgio Massari. In 1818, the Grimani family moved there, after having lost ownership of the palace located in the parish of San Luca, which was transferred to the state domain. The Grimanis, after having sold this mansion, bought it back and kept it until modern times. The mayor Filippo Grimani lived here between 1895 and 1916. The building has been recently renovated. Architecture The facade is of post-Palladian style, continuing on the perpendicaular side, albeit with simpler forms. The mai facade presents many of the distinctive features of the 18th-century Neoclassical architecture. The massive ground floor is very visible because of its rusticated decoration. The noble floor offers seven single-light windows and the full-length front balcony, which also continues on the side facade. Other important elements include the water portal and the string course cornices. On the back there is a large garden in an excellent state.

This bilateral relationship has important permanent assets, such as the excellent relationship between the Royal Houses of both countries and the numerous personal contacts created by the flow of more than one million Norwegians who visit Spain annually (almost ¬º of the population), Spain being the main tourist destination of the Norwegians, which generates a stream of sympathy and a growing interest in Spanish culture and language.http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Documents/FichasPais/Noruega_FICHA%20PAIS.pdf Office of Diplomatic Information In addition, L'Alf√†s del Pi is the second largest colony of Norwegians in the world, just behind London. Spain and Norway also maintain a positive collaboration in multilateral organizations, especially in United Nations. Spain and Norway have also been the two co- sponsors of the V World Congress against the death penalty, which was held in Madrid in June 2013. Government-to-government relations, for their part, maintain a positive tone in all its dimensions, with some important elements of bilateral cooperation, such as defense. There is a certain mutual bilateral interest, since the Spanish armed forces are interested in using the training resources in conditions of extreme cold available to the Norwegian armed forces and, reciprocally, the Norwegian armed forces have an interest in training in arid climates such as those that exist in some areas of Spain. The good level of bilateral relations does not prevent, however, that there is a point where divergences are maintained: fishing in the Svalbard archipelago. Leaving the legal issue in the background safe, the fisheries authorities of both countries hold regular technical conversations to clarify the framework in which Spanish fishing activity takes place in Norway.  Economic relations  Traditionally there has been a trade imbalance between the two countries due to purchases of Norwegian oil and gas, which represent around 70% of Spanish imports. On the other hand, the Spanish export to Norway is very diversified in its products: ships, cars, machinery and the agri-food sector, among others. The balance of services partly compensates for the above, mainly thanks to tourism: 1,540,000 Norwegians (over a population of five million inhabitants) visit Spain annually (2014). Throughout 2014, 1,533,295 Norwegians visited Spain (over a population of five million inhabitants), which represents a growth of 1% compared to 2013. During the first five months of 2015 a certain decrease in the number of Norwegian tourists to Spain was observed, and in that period 521,778 Norwegians had visited Spain (decrease of ‚àí9.3% over the same period of the previous year).  Embassies  The Embassy of Norway is located in Madrid, Spain. The Embassy of Spain is located in Oslo, Norway.

Modern scholars have mostly accepted the string instrument classification while noting that the evidence from ancient texts \\"falls well short of proving it.\\" Scholars believe the word may be Lydian in origin. Background Archaic writers like Alkman and Anakreon mention both magadis and pektis. According to Aristoxenos magadis and pektis were the same instrument; if this is correct magadis would have been associated with dancing or serenades as the pektis was, however, direct literary evidence about the magadis and its role in society is lacking. Euphorion wrote that the magadis was an ancient instrument, but that in latter times it was altered, and had the name also changed to that of the Sambuca. Adding that it was popular on Lesbos and that a sculptor named Lesbothemis (ŒõŒµœÉŒ≤ŒøŒ∏Œ≠ŒºŒπœÇ), about whom little else is known, depicted one of the muses holding the magadis. Menaechmus (ŒúŒ≠ŒΩŒ±ŒπœáŒºŒøœÇ), in his treatise on Artists, said that the pektis (œÄŒ∑Œ∫œÑ·Ω∂œÇ), which he called identical with the magadis, was invented by Sappho. Scholars have said it is an invention of the Lydians or Thracians. There is a discussion in Deipnosophistae (\\"Sophists at Dinner\\") about whether the magadis is a harp- like string instrument or a woodwind similar to the aulos or kithara with those involved eventually reaching agreement that it was a string instrument. The gathered company then turn to the question of whether the instrument is of Lydian origin beginning a sharp dispute between Athenaeus and Posidonius. Verses Anakreon's verse indicates the magadis was a plucked string instrument:œàŒ¨ŒªŒªœâ Œ¥¬¥ Œµ·øêœáŒøœÉŒπ / Œ≥ŒøŒøŒ¥Œ±·øëœÉŒπ ŒºŒ¨Œ≥Œ±Œ¥ŒπŒΩ ŒµœáœâŒΩ / Œ© ŒëŒµœçœáŒ±œÉœÄŒπ, œÉœç Œø ŒÆŒ≤·æ∂ŒπœÇHolding the magadis I pluck its twenty strings; But you, Leukaspis, are in the bloom of youth According to Aristoxenos (as quoted by Athenaeus), the \\"twenty strings\\" mentioned by Anakreon would have been plucked without a plectrum.

In time, twelve streets in the Greater Johannesburg area were named after him.  Early life  Eloff was the seventh of the ten children of Sarel Johannes Eloff, commander of Rustenburg from 1864 to 1889, and his wife, Susanna Cornelia Jacobsz, and a younger brother of FC (Ryk Freek) Eloff, son-in-law of President Kruger through his marriage to Paul and Gezina Kruger's daughter Elsie. Jan Eloff received his first education at home in his hometown from a private teacher and later visited the school of the Hermannsburg Missionary Society on the Morgenzon farm near Rustenburg. At Graaff-Reinet he bought wagons and returned to the Transvaal, where he disposed of them at a reasonable profit. As a young man, he served under his father in the First War of Independence (1880-81).  Career  He became clerk in the office of the State Attorney in Pretoria. He accompanied the third deputation (according to Prof. PJ Nienaber the Second Freedom Deputation) to Europe (1883-84) as private secretary of President Kruger and get the opportunity to visit Britain and many other Western European states. The other members of this mission were Rev. Stephanus Jacobus du Toit (Totius 's father) and Gen. Nicolaas Smit. In 1884 he was named the first civilian commissioner of the republic in Pretoria and in this capacity gained direct knowledge of the events of the gold discovery and of the deployment of the Witwatersrand goldfield. In September 1886 he became public prosecutor and clerk of Captain Carl von Brandis in Johannesburg and succeeded Von Brandis in November as mining commissioner of the goldfield. In 1886 Eloff was already chairman of the seven-member Delvers Committee, and when the Delvers Committee was replaced by a Health Council in 1887, he was one of seven members. The Health Council remained in charge of local affairs until the establishment of the first city council in 1897. On 2 November 1889 he laid the cornerstone of the second building housing the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Eloff remained mining commissioner until the end of December 1892 and became so intimately involved with the origin and growth of Johannesburg and the early development of the Witwatersrand goldfield. With the survey of Johannesburg by surveyor Jos de Villiers named the first street after Eloff.  Later years and family life  After leaving Johannesburg, Eloff started farming near Standerton. In 1897, he traveled to Switzerland and Germany with his family, but he returned to the republic little more than a year later at the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899, when he became a member of the Rustenburg Boer Commandos. After the end of the war, on 31 May 1902, he returned to his birthplace, Waterkloof, to farm on his house and had a castle built there. In 1912, he left with his family for Switzerland, where he was trapped during World War I. In 1919, he returned to Pretoria for good, where he spent the rest of his life. Eloff married Catharina Cornelia de Ridder, daughter of Rev. Johannes de Ridder of the Rustenburg Reformed Church (GKSA), whose grandson Johan de Ridder went on to become the architect of GKSA churches such as that one. The couple had three sons and two daughters.

Nishiyama also participates in women's professional shogi tournaments and is the current holder of the Women's , and titles. Early life and education Nishiyama was born on June 27, 1995 in ≈åsakasayama, Osaka. She first was exposed to shogi as a three-year-old by watching her father and older sister play but really learned how to play the game as a five-year-old first-grade elementary school student. She soon started attending a neighborhood shogi school three times a week and playing practice games on the Internet. In 2009, she won the girls' division of the 30th as a junior high school second-grade student and thereafter was accepted into the Japan Shogi Association's training group in Osaka. Nishiyama quickly progress through the training group system and was eventually was accepted into the JSA's apprentice school at the rank of 6-ky≈´ under the tutelage of shogi professional Hirofumi It≈ç. After high school, Nishiyama moved to Tokyo to study environmental informatics at Keio University, but she has been on a leave of absence to focus on shogi since 2015. Apprentice shogi professional Nishiyama was promoted to the rank of apprentice professional 1-dan in January 2014, becoming just the second woman to achieve that rank after Kana Satomi. Later that same year in September 2014, she became the second woman to be promoted to the rank of apprentice professional 2-dan (once gain after Satomi). Nishiyama was 19 years and 2 months old when she was promoted, thus breaking Satomi's record of 21 years and 4 months. In December 2015, Nishiyama was promoted to the rank of apprentice professional 3-dan, thus beoming the second woman (yet again following Satomi) to achieve such a rank. At age 20 years and 5 months, she also broke Satomi's record of 21 years and 9 months. With Satomi having to leave the 3-dan league in 2018, Nishiyama is now the only woman competing in the league . Nishiyama finished the 66th 3-dan League (October 2019March 2020) in third place with a record of 14 wins and 4 losses. Going into the last day of league play, Nishiyama was in provisional third place with a record of 12 wins and 4 losses, trailing Hiroki Taniai (13 wins and 3 losses) and Shinichir≈ç Hattori (12 wins and 4 losses). Since Nishiyama's league seed was the lowest of the three, she needed to win both of her games and finish at least one game ahead of one of the other two to obtain automatic promotion to the rank of professional 4-dan. Taniai lost one of his two games, but Hatori and Nishiyama won both of theirs which meant that all three finished league play with the same record. Although Nishiyama missed out on being promoted due to her lower seed, her result was good enough to earn her a promotion point for future league play and means she needs only one more promotion point to qualify for full-professional status. Women's major title matches Nishiyama has appeared in women's professional shogi major title matches a total of four times. Her first appearance came in 2014 when she challenged fellow apprentice shogi professional Momoko Kat≈ç for the 4th title, but she lost the match 3 games to none. Nishiyama and Kat≈ç met again in May 2018 in the 11th and its Jo-≈å title. Nishiyama defeated the defending Jo-≈å Kat≈ç 3 games to 1 to win her first major title match.

He was nicknamed Malik al-'Ulama' (\\"King of the Scholars\\"). His major work entitled Bada'i' al-Sana'i' fi Tartib al- Shara'i' () is one of the most important Islamic legal manuals of the Hanafi tradition.  Life  = Early Life and Marriage = Al-KƒÅsƒÅnƒ´ came from the place of KƒÅsƒÅn (Kasansay, Kosonsoy) in the Ferghana and was a student of the Hanafi legal scholar 'Ala' al-Din al-Samarqandi (died 1144), who gave him his daughter Fatima al-Samarqandi, who was trained in fiqh, as a wife. As a bridal gift he was to gift her a commentary on the legal compendium of her father, Tu·∏•fat al-fuqahƒÅ. The book, Bada'i As-Sana'i, was accepted as a dowry. = Career = At an unknown date, he emigrated to Asia Minor, where he worked at the court of the Rum-Seljuk Turks in Konya. Here he made an argument with another Jurist, in which he appeared so violent that the ruler Mas'ud I considered it impossible to keep him at the court. The topic of the debate was Ijtihad. His opponent accused al-KƒÅsƒÅnƒ´ of representing Mu'tazilite teachings. When al-KƒÅsƒÅnƒ´ punched his opponent, the ruler intervened and ended the discussion.Vgl. al-QƒÅrƒ´: al-A'mƒÅr al-'anƒ´ya. Bl. 88a. Since al-KƒÅsƒÅnƒ´ had made himself impossible by his behavior at the court, the ruler sent him on the advice of his vizier as ambassador to Nur ad-Din Zengi at Aleppo. Here he was appointed as successor of Radƒ´ ad-Dƒ´n as-Sarachsƒ´ (died 1149) professor of Hanafi law at the Madrasa HallƒÅwƒ´ya. = Later Life and Death = Not much is known about his remaining life. Ali al-Qari reports that he was deeply attached to his wife FƒÅtima. Whenever he had any doubts and erred in issuing a fatwa, she would inform him the correct judgment and explain the reason for the mistake. Although al-Kasani was a competent jurist, Fatima corrected and edited his legal opinions. He visited her grave at the Abraham Sanctuary in the citadel of Aleppo every Thursday evening after her death. After his death in 1191 he was buried beside her.  Teachers  He studied under prominent scholars, such as Abu al-Mu'in al-Nasafi, and 'Ala' al-Din al-Samarqandi.  Students  Among his pupils was Jamal al-Din al-Ghaznawi.  Works  Al- Kasani's main work is his handbook Bada'i' al-Sana'i' fi Tartib al-Shara'i' (), which occupies seven volumes in the modern print edition. It is said to be the commentary al-KƒÅsƒÅnƒ´ wrote to the handbook of his teacher, as-Samarqandƒ´, but it does not have the character of a commentary, but rather a strictly systematic account of the various legal domains. Al-KƒÅsƒÅnƒ´ begins each chapter with an outline in which he explains which subjects he intends to deal with. However, despite its methodological clarity, the work had no major impact on the development of Hanafi law for a certain period of time. In contrast to the \\"Al-Hidayah\\" of his contemporary al-MarghinƒÅnƒ´ it has never been commented on. Only the appearance of the modern print edition in the early 20th century has given the work greater attention. Since then, it has been of central importance in the Hanafi Academic Institutions.Vgl.

He served with distinction during the war in which the Emirate of Granada was conquered by the forces of Castile and Aragon, and subsequently had great influence in Castile. Family Diego was son of Diego Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba y Carrillo de Albornoz (c. 1438‚Äì1487), 2nd Count of Cabra, Viscount of Izn√°jar, lord of Baena and of many other manors. His father was one of the most prominent men of late medieval Castile, and under Henry IV of Castile (1425‚Äì1474) played a leading role in the conquest of the Nasrid Emirate of Granada. His mother was Mar√≠a Hurtado de Mendoza, daughter of Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, 1st Duke of the Infantado, and also of the highest Castilian nobility. Diego's childhood education was mainly concerned with the art of war, and he accompanied his father in the Granada War (1482‚Äì1491). Diego's first wife was Beatriz Enriquez de Velasco, cousin of Ferdinand II of Aragon (1452‚Äì1516), daughter of Alonso Enr√≠quez de Qui√±ones (c. 1432‚Äì1485), third Admiral of Castile, Count of Melgar y Rueda and uncle of King Ferdinand, and Maria de Velasco, daughter of Pedro Fern√°ndez de Velasco, 1st Count of Haro. His second wife was Francisca de Z√∫√±iga and de la Cerda, daughter of Diego de Z√∫√±iga, claimant to be Duke of B√©jar, and Juana de la Cerda y Casta√±eda. He had many children, both legitimate and illegitimate. Military career Diego succeeded his father in 1487, and began to distinguish himself in his own right in the sieges of Granada. In 1488 he was instructed by the Catholic monarchs, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, to start an offensive against Grenada from Murcia, which he did with all the forces he could supply and won many victories, concluding with the capture of Baza and Hu√©scar. In 1489 he was told by the sovereigns to invade Grenada from Guadix in May. He provided 250 lances and 300 foot soldiers, and with his uncle Mart√≠n Alfonso de C√≥rdoba y Montemayor made the whole of the Alpujarras region fall to the Christian forces the next year. The fighting continued, with another attack on the Nasrid emirate and the Vega de Granada, defense of Baza, and on 23 April 1491 a fresh attack on the Vega de Granada to end the armed conflict. Don Diego Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, count of Cabra, Viscount of Izn√°jar, lord of Baena is listed among those present in December 1491 in the Capitulations of Santa Fe. Later career After the war the Catholic monarchs rewarded Diego in 1493 with the lordship of the towns of Canillas de Aceituno, √Årchez and Corumbela in the Sierra de Bentomiz and V√©lez-M√°laga area. He now had great influence in Castile. On 11 June 1499 he was appointed joint viceroy and governor of Castile with G√≥mez Su√°rez de Figueroa, Count of Feria and father of his relative the Marquis of Priego to represent them during his visit to Andalusia. Diego was one of the three ambassadors to England that left on 26 August 1501 to accompany princess Catherine of Aragon (1485‚Äì1536) on her marriage to Arthur, Prince of Wales (1486‚Äì1502). The others were Alonso de Fonseca (1440‚Äì1512), archbishop of Santiago de Compostela, and his cousin Antonio de Rojas Manrique (died 1527), bishop of Mallorca. In November 1506 some nobles, including Diego Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba y Mendoza and Pedro Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba y Pacheco (1470‚Äì1517), Marquis of Priego, instigated a riot in C√≥rdoba in which the Inquisition's prison was assaulted and the prisoners released. The inquisitor Diego Rodr√≠guez de Lucero fled on a mule to save his life. Diego was appointed Alcalde mayor (Chief justice) and Alcaide (Governor) of the fortress of Alcal√° la Real. In the last part of his life Diego Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba seems to have carried out important pacification work in C√≥rdoba, which earned him the gratitude of the Emperor Charles V (1500‚Äì1558).

Ponden was built as a compensation reservoir after the nearby Watersheddles Reservoir (upstream) was used to divert water away from the River Worth. Ponden was needed to regulate the flow of water down the river into the downstream mills in the valley. The reservoir is owned and managed by Yorkshire Water, and is used as a recreational waterbody by a sailing club. History Ponden Reservoir was completed in 1876 as a compensation reservoir on the River Worth in West Yorkshire. An estimate in 1853 accounted for 16 mills between the site of Ponden Reservoir and where the River Worth ended in Keighley. The tender for construction of Ponden (and Watersheddles) was awarded to Walker and Taylor of Crewe in June of 1870. But the construction was beset by problems with the puddle trench (needed for the dam wall), being sunk to a depth of before finding rock. Other issues with building the reservoir changed the original timeline from 1 year and nine months, to five years. By 1874, the height of the dam wall had been built to a height of , and 222 men were working on the project. The influx of navvies to construct both Watersheddles and Ponden reservoirs, created a separate local industry; brewing. It was said that the navvies needed two things; beef and beer, and a brewery was built to service their needs at Scar Top, which was at the north eastern end of the dam wall at Ponden Reservoir. Keighley Corporation Water Works operated the reservoir until 1959, when it was amalgamated into the newly created Craven Water Board (CWB). The CWB, itself, was subsumed into Yorkshire Water in 1974. Hydrology and wildlife The Worth Valley reservoirs and their drinking water supply. Water for Ponden Reservoir either flows downstream from Watersheddles reservoir, or through the streams that feed the reservoir separately. One of the major tributaries is Ponden Clough, which flows over sandstone beds, typically composed of grit, mudstone and Keighley Bluestone (a hard wearing stone used in road building locally). A catchment tower was built at the head of Ponden Clough which takes water away from the stream and straight into Watersheddles by the means of a conduit. The water quality of Ponden is rated as moderate for ecological purposes, and good for its chemical composition, by the Environment Agency. The surrounding peatland contributes to the discolouration of the water held in the reservoir. Water from Ponden is now supplied to two water treatment works at Oldfield and Sladen Valley, as well as regulating the flow of water into the River Worth. Water from Ponden is only pumped to Oldfield WTW if the supply from Watersheddles is disrupted in any way. The River Worth is noted for the presence of brook lamphrey, which have been recorded just south of Ponden Bridge. In 2017-2018, a fish pass was installed into the reservoir. Canada geese are often seen on the reservoir, and reports of mink on the edges have been prevalent since the 1980s.

Operations Operational aircraft are assigned to VX-1 including the P-8A Poseidon, E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, MH-60R and MH-60S. Additionally, VX-1 provides test and evaluation support for aircraft such as the KC-130J Hercules, E-6B Mercury, MQ-8B Fire Scout, and MQ-4C Triton Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. The squadron operated two specially equipped P-3 aircraft that were equipped to collect data from the large sonobuoy fields used by the Sonobuoy Missile Impact Location System (SMILS) which supported the Navy's fleet ballistic missile program testing. The aircraft modifications enabled the aircraft to receive and record more sonobuoys, had a special timing system and a data monitoring and quick look capability. The Air Force Advanced Range Instrumentation Aircraft could also operate with SMILS. Mission statement The principal mission of VX-1 is to test and evaluate airborne anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and maritime anti-surface warfare (SUW) weapon systems, airborne strategic weapon systems, as well as support systems, equipment and materials in an operational environment. The squadron also develops, reviews and disseminates new ASW/SUW tactics and procedures for fleet use. History A VX-1 P-8A Poseidon VX-1 formed during WWII in response to the German submarines threat. The response by the United States was the commissioning of the Air Antisubmarine Commander Air Force, Atlantic Fleet, on 1 April 1943 at Quonset Point, Rhode Island. The squadron left NAS Key West on 15 September 1973 when the squadron moved to its current home at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland.

It stands on a square also known as Sant‚ÄôAntonio Nuovo, at the end of the Grand Canal.Sant'Antonio Nuovo - Trieste, Italy - Yahoo! Travel The building project dates back to 1808, but work only began in 1825. The church has a facade of ionic columns with six statues sculpted by Francesco Bosa in 1842, representing Saint Justus, Saints Sergius and Bacchus, Saint Servulus, Saint Maurus, Saint Euphemia and Saint Tecla.  History  Saint Anthony in Glory (Odorico Politi) Until the middle of the eighteenth century, a private chapel dedicated to the Annunciation stood on the site of the present church. After Antonio Rossetti granted permission for the chapel to be opened to the public, the great number of worshippers soon made the space inadequate. As a result, it was decided to build a new church in the baroque style dedicated to Saint Anthony. The structure was completed in 1771 but fairly soon it became clear that this building in turn was too small. For this reason in 1808 a number of architects proposed an alternative building. The same year the neoclassical design of the Swiss architect Pietro Nobile won a competition. Construction began in 1827 and continued until 1842. It was not until 1849 however that the imposing new edifice (92 x 28 metres) was consecrated. it was known as ‚ÄòSant‚ÄôAntonio Nuovo‚Äô (new St. Anthony's) because it replaced the eighteenth-century church of the same name.

Leenaun Hill is the 6th-highest mountain in the Maumturks, and its grassy massif, constructed from sandstone and siltstone, contrasts with the rocky ridges and summits constructed from quartzites, grits, and graphitic, of the middle and southern sectors of the range. Naming Irish academic Paul Tempan records that Leenaun hill has also been called \\"Bunnaviskaun\\". The peak has been called Leenaun Mountain. Tempan notes the subsidiary peak of , it takes the term \\"b√∫c\\" from the dialect word \\"buc\\", which means \\"point\\" or \\"summit\\", and is found in Southern France in mountain names (e.g. Buc Pointu). Geography Leenaun Hill lies on its own massif in the northeastern sector of the Maumturk range, separated from the central spine of the range by a deep col at , which is known to hill-walkers of the Maumturks Challenge as the \\"Col of Despondency\\". The geology of this massif is derived from siltstone and sandstone, and contrasts sharply with the quartzite and grits of the central spine; while the summits on the massif of Leenaun Hill are grassy with peak hags, in contrast to the rocky ridges of the central spine. A long northwest to southeast grassy ridge runs through Leenaun Hill's massif, with Leenaun Hill lying close to the centre of the ridge. To the northwest are the subsidiary peaks of Meall Cheo (), , whose prominence of qualifies it as an Arderin Beg. Further north lies Leenaun Hill Far North-West Top (), , whose prominence of also qualifies it as an Arderin Beg. The most northerly subsidiary peak, and the most northerly peak in the Maumturk range, is B√∫c√°n (), meaning \\"spur\\", whose prominence of qualifies it as an Arderin. To the southwest of Leenaun Hill is a long grassy ridge with the minor subsidiary peak of Taobh Dubh , meaning \\"black hillside\\". Across the \\"Col of Despondency\\", lies another subsidiary peak of Maumturkmore , also known as (meaning \\"white peak\\"), whose geology is a complex mix of marbles, metavolcanics, schists, and grits. Immediately to the south of Maumturkmore is the steep \\"v-shaped\\" col of Maam Turk, (, meaning \\"pass of the boar\\"), from which the entire range bears its name, and south of which lies the quartzite peaks of the central spine of the Maumturks range, starting with Letterbreckaun, the 2nd-highest peak in the range at . Hill walking While the grassy and boggy massif of Leenaun Hill is less appealing to climbers than the rocky peaks of the rest of the Maumturks range, Leenaun Hill and its subsidiary peaks offer well-regarded views of Killary Harbour, Ireland's deepest fjord, and the Mweelrea mountain range. The most straightforward route to the summit of Leenaun is the 6-kilometre 2‚Äì3 hour roundtrip route from the village of Leenaun and back; however, because of its positioning on a high massif, it can also be climbed as an 11-kilometre 4‚Äì5 hour loop-route from Leenaun village in the north, summiting to the ridge south of Leenaun Hill, and then turning northwest to summit Leenaun Hill and most of its northerly subsidiary summits before returning to the village. Leenaun Hill is climbed as part of the Maamturks Challenge, a 25-kilometre 10‚Äì12 hour walk over the full Maumturks range (from Maam Cross to Leenaun), which is considered one of the \\"great classic ridge-walks of Ireland\\", but of \\"extreme grade\\" due to the circa 7,600 feet of total ascent. Since 1975, the University College Galway Mountaineering Club, has run the annual \\"Maamturks Challenge Walk\\" (MCW), and man a checkpoint at Meall Cheo; the summit of Leenaun Hill is optional being southeast of the MCW route as it crosses the \\"Col of Despondency\\" from Maumturkmore.

He studied Russian in high school and was interested in Russian literature. However, when he graduated in 1957, none of the Chinese universities accepted Russian majors in that year, and he ended up enrolling in the English program of Fudan University, despite having had virtually no exposure to that language. Upon graduation in 1962, Zhai pursued postgraduate studies at Fudan from 1962 to 1966. He later served as professor in English and vice chair of foreign languages at the university. He translated many works from English into Chinese, including Gone with the Wind, The Moneychangers, O Crime do Padre Amaro, and The Autobiography of Mao Tse-tung as Told to Edgar Snow, as well as short stories by Ernest Hemingway, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Samuel Beckett. In 1979, when Zhai was temporarily unable to teach following dental surgery, he was assigned to write a university English textbook. From then on, textbook writing became a major part of his career. His 5-volume College English and 16-volume 21st-Century College English have been adopted by most Chinese universities as textbooks. In 1991, College English won the Special Prize of the National University Textbooks Award. He also assisted with editing Great English-Chinese Dictionary (Ëã±Ê±âÂ§ßËØçÂÖ∏).

Early life Aldrich was born in 1899 in Taunton. He served in the United States Army during World War I. Prior to entering politics, he worked in a furniture store. He also worked for many years as a funeral director. Political career In 1930, Aldrich was appointed chief of police by the Taunton's new mayor, Wllis K. Hodgman. He was not retained by Hodgman's successor and in 1932 he ran for the Republican nomination for Sheriff of Bristol County. He finished fourth in the five candidate primary with 15% of the vote. The Republican nominee, Patrick H. Dupuis, defeated Democratic incumbent Edmond P. Talbot in the general election and appointed Aldrich as a deputy sheriff. In 1941, Aldrich ran in the special election held following the death of Taunton mayor John E. Fitzgerald. He finished second in the eleven candidate nonpartisan primary behind acting mayor Harold B. Johnston. Aldrich defeated Johnston 5,968 votes to 5,795 to finish Fitzgerald's term. He was elected to a full term in December 1947 - defeating Bernard Cleary 79% votes to 21%. Two years later he defeated city councilor Robert Heap to win a second term. In February 1944, Aldrich was indicted on charges of conspiracy to violate the Corrupt Practices act. He was alleged to have \\"corruptly promised to use his official authority\\" to reappoint Israel Louison to the office of License Commissioner during his reelection campaign. District Attorney Frank A. Smith's only piece of evidence was an undated letter signed by Aldrich stating that he would reappoint Louison. Judge John V. Sullivan instructed the jury that this was to enough to convict. On January 15, 1945, Aldrich, Louison, and a third defendant - county commissioner Leo Coughlin, were found not guilty. That December, Aldrich was reelected in a close race with city council president William Duffy. During the campaign, Aldrich donated a $10,000 ambulance to the city. In 1946, Aldrich was an unsuccessful candidate for both the Democratic and Republican nominations in a June special election for the Massachusetts Senate seat in the First Bristol District. On May 30, 1946, Aldrich fell ill with a heart condition after marching in a Memorial Day parade. On doctor's advice he went to his summer home in Falmouth, Massachusetts to rest. In July 1946, doctors told him that he had less than six months to live. Personal life On June 15, 1920, Aldrich married Irene A. Hewitt. On June 2, 1934 she filed for divorce on the grounds of \\"neglect to provide\\". The divorce was granted on June 22 and she was awarded $7 a week in alimony. Following the divorce, Aldrich was seen with Eileen Kelliher, a bookkeeper ten years his junior. It was believed that the two had married on a trip they took to Florida following Aldrich's divorce. On June 21, 1946, Kelliher filed a paternity suit against Aldrich, alleging that he had fathered her 2-year-old daughter out of wedlock. Records failed to show a marriage license, but showed a birth certificate issued May 10, 1944 listing Merrill D. Aldrich and Elieen L. Kelliher and the parents of Mary L. Kelliher. On July 8, 1946, Aldrich was arrested for \\"lewd and lascivious cohabitation\\". Aldrich admitted to living with Kelliher for several years. He also admitted being the father and offered to set up a trust fund for the child. After several postponements due to Aldrich's ill health, Aldrich and Kelliher were convicted of cohabitation and each sentenced to a year in jail. Aldrich appealed and was released on bail. He pled guilty on November 25, 1946 and his sentence was reduced to three months. He resigned as mayor after entering the guilty plea. Later life While in jail, Aldrich ran in the special election to finish his term. He finished fifth in the ten candidate primary. Aldrich also ran in the 1947 and 1951 elections, but lost both times to his successor, John F. Parker. Aldrich spent his later years residing in Falmouth, where he worked in the real estate business. Death On January 13, 1957, Aldrich, who was scheduled to undergo a serious abdominal operation. saw 2000 A.D. a television program on WBZ-TV about the Boston Eye Bank. When the program ended, he called the bank and donated his eyes to them. He died the following day. His eyes were donated to a 21-year-old mother of three from Saint John, New Brunswick, who had lost almost all of the vision in her left eye, and a 42-year-old Maine grandmother who had been totally blind for the past ten years.

Starting in October 2007, Lance Armstrong led a statewide bus tour to galvanize voters to support Proposition 15. \\"With the kind of shot in the arm this extra money will give us here in Texas, we're going to make discoveries and we're going to have new treatments,\\" said Armstrong. In November 2007 voters approved Proposition 15 to amend the state constitution and create funding for CPRIT. The proposition approved up to $3 billion in bonds to fund the agency. Lance Armstrong and the Texas-based Susan G. Komen foundation publicly supported the proposition. In early 2009 the 80th Texas Legislature passed House Bill 14 which created CPRIT and merged it with the old Texas Cancer Council. William ‚ÄúBill‚Äù Gimson was named the first executive director. Nobel laureate Alfred G. Gilman was named Chief Scientific Officer. In December 2012, CPRIT appointed former executive vide-president and chief academic officer of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Margaret Kripke as its new chief scientific officer. Within a few years the agency was afflicted with allegations of wrongdoing in the awarding of grant money. Observers protested that agency personnel did not follow appropriate scientific review. Law enforcement authorities began to investigate whether CPRIT officials broke the law in their distribution of grant funds. A press investigation alleged CPRIT made a $11 million grant to Peloton Therapeutics in 2010 without review. A $20 million grant the M.D Anderson Institute for Applied Cancer Science also drew attention and criticism. By 2012 the agency was being investigated by the Travis County district Attorney, the state Attorney General‚Äôs office, and was being reviewed by the state auditor‚Äôs office, which is overseen by the Legislature. The Associated Press reported ‚Äúat least seven scientists‚Äù had resigned in protest in October 2012. Alfred G. Gilman and fellow Nobel Laureate Phillip Sharp were among those who left. Gimson resigned as executive director in December 2012. He was replaced on an interim basis by Wayne Roberts, who was appointed permanent CEO in December 2013. In December 2012, CPRIT announced its new chief scientific officer was Margaret Kripke, a cancer immunologist who in 2007 retired as executive vice president and chief academic officer of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. A 2013 article in the Houston Chronicle stated CPRIT had made ‚Äúmisstep after misstep in awarding tens of millions of dollars to commercial interests.‚Äù In June 2013, Governor Perry signed Senate Bill 149 to clarify and strengthen conflict-of-interest and peer review procedures at CPRIT and implement all state auditor recommendations. In compliance with one of the Senate Bill 149 provisions, state leaders appointed new members to the CPRIT oversight committee in September 2013. CPRIT announced on June 15, 2015, that it reached a new milestone: more than 2 million cancer prevention services had been provided to Texans in all 254 counties of the state. In January 2016, CPRIT appointed James Willson as its new chief scientific officer. Previously, Dr. Willson was the director of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center's Harold C. Simmons Cancer Center. In June 2017 Governor Abbott signed into law Senate Bill 81, extending CPRIT‚Äôs Sunset Review date by two years from 2021 to 2023. In July 2018, The Texas State Agency Business Administrators‚Äô Association (TSABAA) named CPRIT CEO Wayne Roberts its Administrator of the Year. In October 2018, CPRIT grantee Jim Allison, Ph.D., chair of Immunology and executive director of the immunotherapy platform at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, was awarded the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for launching an effective new way to attack cancer by treating the immune system rather than the tumor. In October 2018, CPRIT grantee Livia S. Eberlin, assistant professor of chemistry at the University of Texas, was named as a MacArthur fellow, a prestigious award that includes a $625,000, no-strings-attached grant. She was recognized for leading a research team that developed a pen- sized device to detect cancer. Also in October 2018, another CPRIT grantee, UT Southwestern biochemist Dr. Zhijian ‚ÄúJames‚Äù Chen, won the 2019 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for his discovery of the cGAS enzyme that launches the body‚Äôs immune defense against infections and cancers. https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/newsroom/articles/year-2018/breakthrough- chen.html In February 2019, CPRIT named Cindy WalkerPeach, Ph.D., as its Chief Product Development Officer. Dr. WalkerPeach previously served as Innovation- Corps (I-Corps) Program Director at the National Science Foundation (NSF) in Alexandria, Virginia.  CPRIT Foundation  In 2009 the Texas legislature authorized the CPRIT Foundation, a privately funded charity to raise money in support of CPRIT. The non-profit foundation accepted donations and gave money to CPRIT executives in addition to the salaries they received as state employees. The foundation was criticized for lack of transparency by members of the Texas legislature. In 2013 the foundation announced it was shutting down.  Continuation  In May 2019, the Senate voted 31-0 to approve HJR 12 a month after the House voted 130-15 in favor of it. The measure called for a referendum to authorize another$3 billion in general bonds to fund CPRIT. Proposition 6 on the November 2019 statewide ballot in Texas would authorize an increase in the limit of state bonds issuance to fund CPRIT from $3 billion to $6 billion. A maximum of $300 million in bonds would be issued each year. On November 5, 2019, Texas voters approved Proposition 6 by a margin of 64% to 36%.

Early life and education Steele was born on October 20, 1906, in Savannah, Georgia, home to his father's family for several generations. His father, Alexander McPherson Steele, was a postal worker. Around age seven, Steele moved with his family to Boston, Massachusetts his mother's hometown. Steele‚Äôs mother, Minnie Sarah Ellis Steele, was the daughter of a Jamaican minister, Rev. Alexander Ellis, who served as a pastor in Boston. Steele‚Äôs brother, Joseph Alexander Ellis Steele, was a noted jazz musician. Steele attended Boston Latin School, graduated cum laude from Harvard University in 1929, and pursued graduate studies in social work in New York City. Social work career and mixed marriage Upon completion of his studies, Steele became director of Boston's Robert Gould Shaw Settlement House in Roxbury. There he met his future wife, Mary Bradley Dawes, who worked in the settlement's day nursery. Controversy associated with his impending mixed-race marriage forced Steele to resign his position at the Shaw Settlement. Students at Ward Belmont College in Nashville, Tennessee, where Mary Dawes studied prior to obtaining her BA from Boston University in early childhood education, hung two ‚ÄúNegroes‚Äù in effigy to protest the engagement. Following a discreet six-year courtship, the quiet May, 1938 wedding in New York City between a \\"Negro social worker\\" and the \\"daughter of an old New England family\\" generated nationwide press. In Congress, Mississippi Senator Theodore Bilbo commented that Mary Dawes \\"appears to be sustained in her mad insane determination to mingle blood impregnated with the highest genetic values of the Caucasian and the blood of an African whose racial strains have dwelt for six thousand years or more in the jungles of a continent.‚Äù Notwithstanding the controversy, in 1939 Julian Steele began work heading up Boston's new Armstrong Hemenway Foundation, focusing on affordable housing. Life in small town New England: Massachusetts' first African-American town moderator In 1943, Julian and Mary Steele purchased a farm in West Newbury, Massachusetts, a predominately rural North Shore town within commuting distance of Steele's work in Boston. They moved to that town when their daughter, born in 1944, was a baby. Steele, who established a dairy herd for his working farm, said that the countryside held appeal as a good place to have a family. He also stated,\\"In West Newbury a man can be an avid admirer of Senator Joe McCarthy and an equally avid advocate of racial and religious tolerance.\\" In March 1952, Julian Steele, the only African-American voter among some 1,500 residents, was elected West Newbury's town meeting moderator. He was the first African-American town moderator in Massachusetts. Townspeople credited him with \\"elevating the cultural life of the community.\\" Steele was a founder and the moderator of West Newbury's \\"wide-awake Town Hall Forum,\\" a weekly lecture series and he participated in the town's summer theater. Steele was instrumental in the decision of renowned African-American tenor Roland Hayes to purchase a summer home in West Newbury on Crane Neck Street, just up from the Steele farm. Hayes, in turn, performed at local events including a charity concert in West Newbury town hall. For at least a decade, Steele was Massachusetts' only African-American town moderator. In the direct democracy of New England town meeting, the moderator serves to supervise, guide, and referee townspeople's debate leading to votes determining the course of municipal budgets and agendas for the coming year. At the time of Steele's election, local writer Margaret Coit described town meeting as West Newbury's \\"favorite indoor sport,\\" where free speech was the rule and \\"controversy was cherished for its own sake.\\" Steele served as West Newbury's moderator until his death.  Career as a state and federal official  Julian Steele held a number of state and federal posts, often as the first African-American in the position. He was appointed to the Massachusetts Parole Board in 1954. During his tenure, Massachusetts conducted an evaluation of the death penalty. The state Attorney General supported repeal, those opposing capital punishment asserted that it usually reflected race or class prejudice, while the minority who favored it cited deterrence. The parole board was divided: Steele favored abolishment, saying \\"the state should not take a human life because the state cannot create it.\\" When Steele, the sole remaining Republican on the parole board, was passed over for reappointment in favor of a Democratic candidate, civic and religious groups protested the alleged politicization of the board. In 1960, Steele was appointed assistant administrator of the U.S. Housing and Home Financing Agency, with responsibility for New England and New York. Massachusetts Senator Leverett Saltonstall said at the time that Steele was the first African-American person appointed to such a high position in that agency. Steele became the Deputy Commissioner of Urban Renewal in Massachusetts' Department of Commerce and Development in 1965. When he was appointed commissioner of Massachusetts' new Department of Community Affairs in 1968, Steele became the first African American to head an agency in the state. At Steele's swearing in, Governor John Volpe called Steele the ‚Äúideal man to carry forth with the development, renewal and rehabilitation of the communities in the Commonwealth and the mobilization of state forces to fight poverty.‚Äù Civil rights advocacy and church leadership Steele's assertion, \\"Human progress can be measured largely in terms of acceptance of difference as interesting and our common humanity as profoundly important\\" informed his activism in civic and religious fields. Throughout his life, he advocated for a number of causes, among them civil rights and affordable housing. A 1937 profile in The Crisis, the magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, cataloged Julian Steele's activities as a young professional ranging from organizing aid for Ethiopia to working with Boston planners on housing‚Äîall in furtherance of his \\"cardinal principle . . . that Negroes must cooperate with whites.\\" Steele held several leadership posts with the NAACP beginning in the 1940s, including president of the Boston Branch. In 1958 he was elected president of Boston's Urban League. Julian Steele also assumed leadership positions in church groups. Active in his church in West Newbury, he became moderator for the Congregationalists of Essex County and then vice-moderator for Massachusetts. In 1954 Steele was named the first African-American moderator (principal layman) of the Massachusetts Congregational Christian Conference, a denomination descending directly from the Puritans. Death and legacy On January 17, 1970, Steele died of a heart attack in his sleep at home in West Newbury. After services in Roxbury attended by some 800 mourners, Steele was buried in West Newbury. Steele was the subject of an appreciation in the Congressional Record, and at its 1971 annual town meeting, the Town of West Newbury read a proclamation stating in part that \\"in the passing of Julian Steele who served the Town as Moderator, the Town has lost a valuable and faithful public servant who has left an example of a life worthy of the emulation of all.\\" An elders' housing center in Melrose, Massachusetts, was named after Steele in the months following his death. A 1950's-era housing project in Lowell, Massachusetts, since razed, was also named for him. In 2019, the Town of West Newbury voted to erect a historical marker in Steele's honor in front of Town Hall. A collection of his papers is housed in the Archival Research Center at Boston University.

Former Union Army soldiers of the American Civil War of 1861‚Äì65 established a fraternal organization called the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), while their Southern brethren would join together in the United Confederate Veterans (UCV).Marquis James ( 1923). A History of The American Legion. New York: William Green; p. 77. Both organizations emerged as powerful political entities, with the GAR serving as a mainstay of the Republican Party, which controlled the Presidency from the Civil War through William Howard Taft's administration except for the two terms of office of Grover Cleveland. In Southern politics the UCV maintained an even more dominant position as a bulwark of the Democratic Party which dominated there. The conclusion of the brief Spanish‚ÄìAmerican conflict of 1898 ushered in another soldiers' organization, the American Veterans of Foreign Service, today known as the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (VFW).Rumer 1990, p. 9.  20th century  = World War I = Concerned about the United States' absence from the world war and the preparedness of its army and navy, magazine editor Arthur Sullivant Hoffman and writer Stephen Allan Reynolds founded an organization also known as The American Legion in February 1915, inspired by a letter from reader E. D. Cook. They lobbied government to strengthen the military. They held a preparedness parade in New York City and made a film America Prepare Officers included Theodore Roosevelt, Arthur S. Hoffman, William Howard Taft, Elihu Root, Jacob M. Dickinson, Henry L. Stimson and Luke E. Wright, George von L. Meyer, Truman H. Newberry and Charles J. Bonaparte. Its officers were at 10 Bridge Street, New York City./ In 1917, when war was declared the Legion had 23,000 members skilled in 77 professions pledged to fight. Their pledge cards were shared with the government and ultimately used to raise two regiments of air mechanics. The Legion was discorporated in 1917.(via Google News) = Birth of the Legion = With the termination of hostilities in World War I in November 1918, some American officers who had been participants in the conflict began to think about creating a similar organization for the two million men who had been on European duty. The need for an organization for former members of the AEF was pressing and immediate. With the war at an end, hundreds of thousands of impatient draftees found themselves trapped in France and pining for home, certain only that untold weeks or months lay ahead of them before their return would be logistically possible.James, A History of The American Legion, p. 14. Morale plummeted. Cautionary voices were raised about an apparent correlation between disaffected and discharged troops and the Bolshevik uprisings taking place in Russia, Finland, Germany and Hungary. This situation was a particular matter of concern to Lt. Col. Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., eldest son of the 26th President. One day in January 1919, he had a discussion at General Headquarters with a mobilized National Guard officer named George A. White, a former newspaper editor with the Portland Oregonian.James, A History of The American Legion, p. 15. After long discussion, he suggested the establishment at once of a new servicemen's organization including all members of the AEF, as well as those soldiers who remained stateside as members of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps during the war without having been shipped abroad. He and White advocated ceaselessly for this proposal until ultimately they found sufficient support at headquarters to move forward with the plan. General John J. Pershing issued orders to a group of 20 non-career officers to report to the YMCA in Paris on February 15, 1919.James, A History of The American Legion, p. 16. The selection of these individuals had been made by Roosevelt. They were joined with a number of regular Army officers Pershing selected himself.Rumer 1990, p. 13. The session of reserve and regular officers was instructed to provide a set of laws to curb the problem of declining morale. After three days, the officers presented a series of proposals, including eliminating restrictive regulations, organizing additional athletic and recreational events, and expanding leave time and entertainment programs.James, A History of The American Legion, pp. 16‚Äì17. At the end of the first day, the officers retired to the Inter-Allied Officers Club, a converted home across the street from the YMCA building. There Lt. Col. Roosevelt told them his proposal for a new veterans' society.James, A History of The American Legion, pp. 17‚Äì18. Most of those present were rapidly won to Roosevelt's plan.James, A History of The American Legion, p. 18. The officers decided to make all of their actions provisional until an elected convention of delegates could be convened and did not predetermine a program for the unnamed veterans organization. Instead, they chose to expand their number with a large preliminary meeting which would consist of an equal number of elected delegates to represent both enlisted men and commissioned officers.James, A History of The American Legion, pp. 18‚Äì19. A provisional executive committee of four people emerged from the February 15 \\"Roosevelt dinner\\": Roosevelt in the first place, who was to return to the United States and obtain his military discharge when able, and then to gather assistants and promote the idea of the new veterans' organization among demobilized troops there; George White, who was to travel France touring the camps of the AEF explaining the idea in person; Secretary of the group was veteran wartime administrator Eric Fisher Wood, together with former Ohio Congressman Ralph D. Cole, Wood was to establish a central office and to maintain contact by mail and telegram with the various combat divisions and headquarters staffs, as well as to publicize activities to the press.James, A History of The American Legion, p. 20. Preparations for a convention in Paris began apace. A convention call was prepared by Wood and \\"invitations\\" distributed to about 2,000 officers and enlisted men and publicized in the March 14, 1919 issue of Stars and Stripes.Rumer 1990, p. 15. The convention call expressed the desire to form \\"one permanent nation-wide organization...composed of all parties, all creeds, and all ranks who wish to perpetuate the relationships formed while in military service.\\"Rumer 1990, p. 16. In addition to the personal invitations distributed, the published announcement indicated that \\"any officer or enlisted man not invited who is in Paris at the time of the meeting is invited to be present and to have a voice in the meeting.\\" The conclave was slated to begin on March 15. The site of Ferdinand Branstetter Post No. 1 is a vacant lot in Van Tassell, Wyoming, where the first American Legion post in the United States was established in 1919. The post was named after Ferdinand Branstetter, a Van Tassell resident who died in World War I. The structure housing the post has since been demolished. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. In 1969, it was hoped that an interpretative sign would be put up, and also possibly that a restored post building would be constructed. The first post of the Legion, General John Joseph Pershing Post Number 1 in Washington, DC, was organized on March 7, 1919, and obtained the first charter issued to any post of the Legion on May 19, 1919. The St. Louis caucus that same year decided that Legion posts should not be named after living persons, and the first post changed its name to George Washington Post 1. The post completed the constitution and made plans for a permanent organization. It set up temporary headquarters in New York City and began its relief, employment, and Americanism programs. On May 20, 1919, Colonel Ernest Lester Jones received a petition from twenty (20) of the enlisted women of the United States Naval Reserve Force, for a charter to organize a Post to be known as the \\"Betsy Ross Post No . l, composed entirely of Yeomen (F) of the U.S. Navy. In October of that same year, the post changed its name to U.S.S. Jacob Jones, which commemorated the Navy heritage of the members. Congress granted The American Legion a national charter in September 1919. China Post One, formed in 1919 one year after the \\"great war\\" and chartered by The American Legion on April 20, 1920, was originally named the General Frederick Townsend Ward Post No. 1, China. It is the only Post nominally headquartered in a Communist country, and has been operating in exile since 1948 ‚Äì presently in Fate, Texas.  Paris Caucus  Photograph taken by a photographer who slipped in a half-hour before the session began, with more than half the Paris caucus delegates absent Having immediately received a blizzard of acceptances to attend the opening of the \\"Liberty League Caucus\\", as he had begun to refer to it, Temporary Secretary Eric Fisher Wood began to search for use of a room of sufficient size to contain the gathering.Rumer 1990, pp. 18‚Äì19. The Cirque de Paris had been retained, a large, multisided amphitheater sufficient to accommodate a crowd of about 2,000.Rumer 1990, p. 19. Delegates began to assemble from all over France. The 10:00 am scheduled start was delayed due to various logistical problems, with a beginning finally made shortly after 2:45 pm.Rumer 1990, p. 21. As \\"Temporary Chairman\\" Teddy Roosevelt, Jr. had already departed for America, the session was gaveled to order by Eric Wood, who briefly recounted Roosevelt's idea and the story of the 20 AEF officers who had jointly helped to give the new organization form. In his keynote opening remarks Wood recommended to the delegates of the so-called Paris Caucus that they do three things: first, set up an apparatus to conduct a formal founding conference in the United States sometime in the winter; second, the body should draft a tentative name for the organization; and finally, the body should compose a provisional constitution to be submitted to the founding convention for its acceptance or rejection.Rumer 1990, p. 23. William G. Price Jr. was selected to preside. Convention rules were decided upon and four 15-member committees were chosen.Rumer 1990, p. 24. The Committee on Name reported back that they had considered a dozen potential names, including Veterans of the Great War, Liberty League, American Comrades of the Great War, Legion of the Great War, and The American Legion, among others.Rumer 1990, p. 25. This list was whittled down to five ranked choices for the consideration of the Caucus, with \\"The American Legion\\" the preferred option. It was noted in passing during the course of debate on the topic that Teddy Roosevelt, Jr. had been responsible for an earlier organization called \\"The American Legion\\" in 1914, a \\"preparedness\\" society with a claimed membership of 35,000 which had been absorbed into the Council of National Defense in 1916.Rumer 1990, p. 28. The Committee on Constitution reported with a report containing the draft of a Preamble for the organization, specifying organizational objectives. This document stated that the group > ... desiring to perpetuate the principles of Justice, Freedom, and Democracy > for which we have fought, to inculcate the duty and obligation of the > citizen to the State; to preserve the history and incidents of our > participation in the war; and to cement the ties of comradeship formed in > service, do propose to found and establish an Association for the > furtherance of the foregoing purposes.Rumer 1990, p. 26. The majority report of the Committee on Convention recommended that 11 am on November 11, 1919‚Äîone year to the hour after the termination of hostilities in World War I‚Äîbe selected as the date and time for the convocation of a national convention. No location was specified. The Committee on Permanent Organization recommended an organization based upon territorial units rather than those based upon military organizations, governed by an Executive Committee of 50, with half of these coming from the officer corps and the other half coming from the ranks of enlisted men.Rumer 1990, pp. 26‚Äì27.  St. Louis Caucus  The Paris Caucus in March was by its nature limited to soldiers of the AEF who remained in Europe; a parallel organizational meeting for those who had returned to the American preparatory to a formal organizational convention was deemed necessary. This was a conclave dominated by the presence of Theodore Roosevelt Jr., who called the convention to order amidst mass chanting akin to that of a Presidential nominating convention‚Äî\\"We Want Ted-dy! We Want Ted-dy!\\"James, A History of The American Legion, p. 44. A minor crisis followed when Roosevelt twice declined nomination for permanent chairman of the session, to the consternation of many overwrought delegates, who sought to emphasize the symbolism of President Theodore Roosevelt's son maintaining the closest of connections with the organization.James, A History of The American Legion, pp. 45‚Äì46. The work of the St. Louis Caucus was largely shaped by the fundamental decisions made by the earlier Paris Caucus. Its agenda was in addition carefully prepared by a 49-member \\"Advance Committee\\", which included at least one delegate from each fledgling state organization and which drew up a draft program for the organization in advance of the convention's opening.James, A History of The American Legion, pp. 47‚Äì48. As time before the scheduled start of the convention was short, delegation to the assembly was highly irregular. On April 10, 1919, Temporary Secretary Eric Fisher Wood mailed a letter to the Governor of every state, informing them of the forthcoming gathering and making note of the non-partisan and patriotic nature of the League.William Pencak, For God and Country: The American Legion, 1919‚Äì1941. Boston: Northeastern University Press, 1989; p. 58. Follow-up cables by Roosevelt and Wood encouraged the organization of state conventions to select delegates. This was, however, largely a failed formality, as states lacked sufficient time to organize themselves and properly elect delegates to St. Louis. In practice, the fledgling organization's provisional Executive Committee decided to allow each state delegation twice as many votes at that state had in the United States House of Representatives and left it to each to determine how those votes were apportioned. Participants at the St. Louis Caucus were enthusiastic although the session was not a productive one. Fully two days were invested choosing ceremonial officers and selecting Minneapolis as the site for the organization's formal Founding Convention in the fall.Pencak, For God and Country, p. 59. Over 1100 participants competed to gain the floor to speechify, leading one historian to describe the scene as a \\"melee\\" in which \\"disorder reigned supreme.\\"The words are those of Dorothy R. Harper, \\"Hawaii ‚Äì Department History\\", quoted in Pencak, For God and Country, p. 59. Consequently, passage of the program by the gathering was largely a pro forma exercise, rushed through during the session's last day, with the actual decision-making process involving such matters as the constitution and publications of the organization being done in committee at night. The preamble of the constitution adopted in St. Louis became one of the seminal statements of the Legion's orientation and objectives: > For God and Country we associate ourselves together for the following > purposes: > > To uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States of America; to > maintain law and order; to foster and perpetuate a 100 Percent Americanism; > to preserve the memories and incidents of our association in the Great War; > to inculcate a sense of individual obligation to the community, state, and > nation; to combat the autocracy of both the classes and the masses; to make > right the master of might; to promote peace and good will on earth; to > safeguard and transmit to prosperity the principles of justice, freedom, and > democracy; to consecrate and sanctify our comradeship by devotion to mutual > helpfulness. The St. Louis Caucus spent much of its time discussing resolutions: whether a stand should be taken on the League of Nations, Prohibition, or the implementation of universal military service, whether posts composed of Negro soldiers should be established, and whether Secretary of War Newton D. Baker should be impeached for his apparent leniency towards conscientious objectors in the months after the war.Pencak, For God and Country, pp. 59‚Äì60. A particularly hard line was taken towards the American radical movement, with one resolution passed on the final day calling on Congress to \\"pass a bill or immediately deporting every one of those Bolsheviks or Industrial Workers of the World.\\"Pencak, For God and Country, p. 60. Minneapolis, Minnesota was chosen for the site of the founding convention of the organization in November over the more centrally-located Chicago after much acrimonious debate about the perceived political transgressions of the Chicago city administration.  Founding Convention  segregated \\"Negro\\" posts, or exclusion of black soldiers from membership altogether up to the states and the posts themselves, often resulting in gross disparities of opportunity.Jones, A History of The American Legion, p. 349. The formal founding convention was held in Minneapolis, Minnesota from November 10 to 12, 1919. It was attended by 684 delegates from around the United States.Richard Seely Jones, A History of The American Legion. Indianapolis, IN: Bobbs-Merrill Co., 1946; p. 44. From the outset The American Legion maintained a strictly nonpartisan orientation towards electoral politics. The group wrote a specific prohibition of the endorsement of political candidates into its constitution,Quoted in Jones, A History of The American Legion, p. 49. declaring: > ... this organization shall be absolutely non-political and shall not be > used for the dissemination of partisan principles or for the promotion of > the candidacy of any person seeking public office or preferment; and no > candidate for or incumbent of a salaried elective public office shall hold > any office in The American Legion or in any branch or post thereof. One semi-official historian of the organization has noted the way that this explicit refusal to affiliate with one or another political party had the paradoxical effect of rapidly building great political power for the organization, as politicians from both of the \\"old parties\\" competed for the favor of the Legion's massive and active membership.Jones, A History of The American Legion, p. 45. One of the gathering's primary accomplishment was the establishment of a permanent National Legislative Committee to advance the Legion's political objectives as its lobbying arm.Jones, A History of The American Legion, p. 46. The first iteration of this official Washington, D.C.-based lobby for the Legion included only four members‚Äîtwo Republicans and two Democrats.Jones, A History of The American Legion, p. 47. After 1920 the National Legislative Committee was expanded to consist of one member from each state, with additional effort made at the state level to exert pressure upon various state legislatures. Chief on the Legion's legislative agenda was a dramatic improvement of the level of compensation for soldiers who suffered permanent disability during the war. At the time of the end of World War I, American law stated that soldiers who suffered total disability were to receive only the base pay of a Private‚Äî$30 per month.Jones, A History of The American Legion, p. 48. The Legion concentrated its lobbying effort in 1919 on passage of legislation increasing payment for total disability suffered in the war to $80 a month‚Äîa sum roughly sufficient in dollars of the day to provide a living wage. Those partially disabled by their wounds were to receive lesser payments. A flurry of lobbying by the Legion's National Legislative Committee in conjunction with cables sent to Congressional leaders by National Commander Franklin D'Olier helped achieve passage of this legislation by the end of 1919. The Legion's chief base of support during its first years was among the officers corps of the reserves and the National Guard.Jones, A History of The American Legion, p. 85. The size of the regular army was comparatively small and its representation in the League in its earliest days was even more limited. Consequently, for nearly two decades The Legion maintained a largely isolationist perspective, best expressed in three resolutions passed by the Minneapolis founding convention: > 1\\\\. That a large standing army is uneconomic and un-American. National > safety with freedom from militarism is best assured by a national citizen > army and navy based on the democratic principles of equality of obligation > and opportunity for all. > > 2\\\\. That we favor universal military training and the administration of such > a policy should be removed from the complete control of any exclusively > military organization or caste. > > 3\\\\. That we are strongly opposed to compulsory military service in time of > peace.Jones, A History of The American Legion, p. 86. Additional resolutions passed by the founding convention emphasized the need for military preparedness, albeit maintained through a citizens' army of reservists and National Guardsmen rather than through the costly and undemocratic structure of a vast standing army led by a professional military caste. This nationalist isolationism would remain in place until the very eve of American entry into the Second World War.  Centralia Massacre  In this political cartoon from the Portland Telegram a Legionnaire prepares to hit a ball labeled \\"Bolshevism\\" with a rifle butt labeled \\"100 per cent Americanism\\" beside a quote from Theodore Roosevelt: \\"Don't argue with the reds; go to bat with them and go to the bat strong!\\" November 11, 1919, the first anniversary of Armistice Day and the occasion of the Legion's formal launch at its Minneapolis Founding Convention, was also a historical moment of violence and controversy. On that day a parade of Legionnaires took place in the mill town of Centralia, located in Southwestern Washington.Tom Copeland, The Centralia Tragedy of 1919: Elmer Smith and the Wobblies. Seattle, WA: University of Washington Press, 1993; p. 40. Plans were made by some of the marchers at the conclusion of their patriotic demonstration to storm and ransack the local hall maintained by the Industrial Workers of the World, a labor union founded 14 years earlier at a convention of socialists, anarchists, Marxists and radical trade unionists from all over the United States, which had been the target of multiple arrests, large trials, and various incidents of mob violence nationally during the months of American participation in World War I. Plans for this violence had made their way to union members (commonly referred to as Wobblies), however, and 30 or 40 IWW members had been seen coming and going at their hall on the day of the march‚Äîsome of whom were observed carrying guns. At 2.00 pm the march began at the city park, led by a marching band playing \\"Over There.\\"Copeland, The Centralia Tragedy of 1919, p. 51. Marchers included Boy Scouts, members of the local Elks Lodge, active-duty sailors and marines, with about 80 members of the newly established Centralia and Chehalis posts bringing up the rear. As the parade turned onto Tower Avenue and crossed Second Street, it passed IWW Hall on its left. The parade stopped and Legionnaires surrounded the hall. Parade Marshal Adrian Cormier rode up on horseback and, according to some witnesses, blew a whistle giving the signal to the Legionnaires to charge the IWW headquarters building. A group of marchers rushed the hall, smashing the front plate glass window and attempting to kick in the door. Just as the door gave way, shots were fired from within at the intruders. This provided the signal to other armed IWW members, who were stationed across the street to set up a crossfire against potential invaders and they also began firing on the Legionnaires.Copeland, The Centralia Tragedy of 1919, pp. 51‚Äì52. In less than a minute the firing was over, with three AL members left dead or dying and others wounded.Copeland, The Centralia Massacre of 1919, p. 52. Taken by surprise by the armed defense of IWW headquarters, many Legionnaires rushed home to arm themselves, while others broke into local hardware stores to steal guns and ammunition. Now armed, a furious mob reassembled and charged the IWW Hall again, capturing six IWW members inside. The mob proceeded to destroy the front porch of the hall and a large bonfire was built, upon which were torched the local Wobblies' official records, books, newspapers and mattresses. One local Wobbly named Wesley Everest escaped through a back door when he saw the mob approaching the hall. He fled into nearby woods, exchanging gunshots with his pursuers. One of those chasing the fleeing IWW man was hit in the chest several times with bullets and was killed, running the death count of Legionnaires to four. Everest was taken alive, kicked and beaten, and a belt wrapped around his neck as he was dragged back to the town to be lynched. Local police intervened, however, and Everest was taken to jail, where he was thrown down on the concrete floor. At 7:30 pm, on cue, all city lights in town went out for 15 minutes and Legionnaires stopped cars and forced them to turn out their headlights.Copeland, The Centralia Tragedy of 1919, p. 53. The Elks Hall gathering entered the jail without meeting resistance and took Wesley Everest, dragging him away to a waiting car but leaving other incarcerated Wobblies in jail cells unhindered.Copeland, The Centralia Tragedy, pp. 53‚Äì54. A procession of six cars drove west to a railroad bridge across the Chehalis River.Copeland, The Centralia Tragedy of 1919, p. 54. A rope was attached to Everest's neck and he was pushed off the bridge, but the lynching attempt was bungled and Everest's neck was not snapped by the fall. Everest was hauled up again, a longer rope was substituted, and Everest was pushed off the bridge again. The lynch mob then shined their car headlights on the hanging Everest and shot him. Although a mob milled around the jail all night, terrorizing the occupants, no further acts of extra-legal retribution were taken. Everest's body was cut down the next morning, falling into the riverbed below, where it remained all day.Copeland, The Centralia Tragedy of 1919, p. 55. As night fell Everest's body was hauled back to town, the rope still around his neck, where it was refused by local undertakers and left on the floor of the jail in sight of the prisoners all night. No charges were ever filed in connection with the lynching.Copeland, The Centralia Tragedy of 1919, p. 59. Twelve IWW members were ultimately indicted by a grand jury for first degree murder in connection with the killing of the four Legionnaires and a local left wing lawyer was charged as an accessory to the crime. A January 1920 trial resulted in the conviction of six defendants on charges of second degree murder.Copeland, The Centralia Tragedy of 1919, pp. 65, 82‚Äì83. = Roaring Twenties = 1922 National Convention in New Orleans The Legion was very active in the 1920s. The organization was formally non-partisan, endorsing candidates of no political party. Instead the group worked to the spread of the ideology of Americanism and acted as a lobbying organization on behalf of issues of importance to veterans, with particular emphasis on winning a \\"soldier's bonus\\" payment from the government and for the alleviation of the unemployment to which many soldiers returned. The Legion also served a strong social function, building and buying \\"clubhouses\\" in communities across America at which its members could gather, reflect, network, and socialize. The Legion's efforts to promote Americanism during the 1920s included urging its members to report on publication materials perceived to be subversive, left-wing, or reflective of radical foreign political views, and established a National Americanism Commission to oversee its actions related to subversive activities. It commissioned the development of textbooks that promoted American patriotism, worked with members of the National Education Association to promote the teaching of history from an American perspective, and sought the removal of textbooks it saw as \\"un-American\\". It also supported legislation restricting immigration and seditious speech, and used its influence in an effort to deny public forums to speakers whose views it opposed. In 1924, the Legion, led by its lobbyist Col. John Thomas Taylor, and other veterans organizations won their battle for additional compensation for World War I veterans with the passage of the World War Adjusted Compensation Act. Most payments were scheduled to be paid in 1945.American Red Cross, \\"World War Adjusted Compensation Act\\", updated: July 19, 1926, pp. 363‚Äì74, Available online\\", accessed January 10, 2011 In 1923, Legion Commander Alvin Owsley cited Italian Fascism as a model for defending the nation against the forces of the left.William Pencak, For God and Country: The American Legion, 1919‚Äì1941 Northeastern University Press, 1989; p. 21. Owsley said: > If ever needed, The American Legion stands ready to protect our country's > institutions and ideals as the Fascisti dealt with the destructionists who > menaced Italy! ... The American Legion is fighting every element that > threatens our democratic government‚ÄîSoviets, anarchists, IWW, revolutionary > socialists and every other red ... Do not forget that the Fascisti are to > Italy what The American Legion is to the United States.Alec Campbell, \\"Where > Do All the Soldiers Go?: Veterans and the Politics of Demobilization\\", in > Diane E. Davis, Anthony W. Pereira, eds., Irregular Armed Forces and their > Role in Politics and State Formation. New York: Cambridge University Press, > 2003; pp. 110‚Äì11. The Legion invited Mussolini to speak at its convention as late as 1930. The Legion was instrumental in the creation of the U.S. Veterans' Bureau, now known as the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Legion also created its own American Legion Baseball Program, hosting national tournaments annually from 1926. Commander Travers D. Carmen awarded Charles Lindbergh its \\"Distinguished Service Medal\\", the medal's first recipient, on July 22, 1927. The Legion's national convention was held in Paris in September 1927. A major part of this was drum and bugle corps competition in which approximately 14,000 members took part. = Great Depression = The American Legion Memorial Bridge in Traverse City, Michigan, was completed in 1930. The Traverse City city commission decided to purchase dedication plaques for $100 at the request of the Legion in 1930. The Sons of the American Legion formed at the 14th National Convention in Portland, Oregon, on September 12‚Äì15, 1932. Membership is limited to the male descendants of members of The American Legion, or deceased individuals who served in the armed forces of the United States during times specified by the Legion. In the spring of 1933, at the very beginning of his presidency, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt sought to balance the federal budget by sharp reductions in veterans benefits, which constituted one quarter of the federal budget. The Economy Act of 1933 cut disability pensions and established strict new guidelines for proving disabilities. The Legion generally supported the FDR administration and the Act, while the VFW was loudly opposed. After a VFW convention heard speeches denouncing FDR's programs, the Legion invited Roosevelt to speak and he won the convention's support. Nevertheless, the Legion's stance was unpopular with its membership and membership plummeted in 1933 by 20% as 160,000 failed to renew their memberships. The VFW then campaigned for a \\"Bonus Bill\\" that would immediately pay World War I veterans what they were due in 1945 under the 1924 World War Adjusted Compensation Act. The Legion's failure to take a similar position allowed the much smaller, less prestigious VFW to rally support while accusing the Legion of ties to the FDR Administration and business interests. In 1935, the first Boys' State convened in Springfield, Illinois. The Legion's first National High School Oratorical Contest was held in 1938. After the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane, which killed about 480 former servicemen and women, the Legion was very critical of the government and the safety of the New Deal's Works Progress Administration camps. When Col. Taylor testified about the event in front of the House Committee on World War Veterans' Legislation in 1937, he tried to have the Legion's report \\"Murder at Matecumbe\\" read into the Congressional Record. He was stopped by Chairman John Elliott Rankin and asked to leave a copy for the committee to review. It was made clear that the copy would not be put into the record. = World War II = In 1942, the Legion adopted the practice of the VFW to become a perpetual organization, rather than die off as its membership aged as that of the Grand Army of the Republic was rapidly doing. The Legion's charter was changed to allow veterans of World War II to join.  The \\"G.I. Bill\\"  Throughout the 1940s, the Legion was active in providing support for veterans and soldiers who fought in World War II. The Legion wrote the original draft of the Veterans Readjustment Act, which became known as the G.I. Bill. The original draft is preserved at the Legion's National Headquarters. It was passed in 1944 by a conservative coalition in Congress that want to reach practically all wartime veterans, as opposed to the Roosevelt administration that wanted a much smaller program limited to a small elite.Suzanne Mettler, \\"The creation of the GI Bill of Rights of 1944: Melding social and participatory citizenship ideals.\\" Journal of Policy History 17#4 (2005): 345‚Äì74. The Legion mobilized its members across the country and secured passage in June 1944. Benefits included low-cost mortgages, low-interest loans to start a business, cash payments of tuition and living expenses to attend high school, college or vocational/technical school, as well as one year of unemployment compensation. It was available to veterans who had been on active duty during the war years for at least 120 days and had not been dishonorably discharged‚Äîexposure to combat was not required. The Legion helped veterans fill out the paperwork and obtain the benefits.Glenn C. Altschuler and Stuart M. Blumin, The GI Bill: a new deal for veterans (2009) p. 118 = The Cold War = As the new veterans returned home, membership soared to 3.3 million in 1946, triple the prewar number. There were another million members in the Women's Auxiliary. Its main objective after the war was to set up universal military service, but it had to settle for selective conscription,Morten Bach, \\"None so consistently right: The American Legion's Cold War, 1945‚Äì1950,\\" (PhD dissertation, Ohio University, 2007) p 8.The first Boys Nation program was held in 1946. Late in 1950, at least some local Legion organizations began to support Senator Joe McCarthy, sponsoring his appearance at an \\"Americanism\\" rally in Houston. During his speech, the senator falsely claimed there were 205 Communists in the State Department. The Legion also took a McCarthyist stance on film, threatening to boycott any theater that screened director Edward Dmytryk's Salt to the Devil (also known as Give Us This Day) (1949) because of Dmytryk's status on the blacklist. At the Legion's 1951 convention, it formally endorsed its \\"Back to God\\" movement.; Gast√≥n Espinosa, ed., Religion and the American Presidency: George Washington to George W. Bush (NY: Columbia University Press, 2009) pp. 278‚Äì79 When launching the program in 1953 with a national television broadcast that included speeches by President Eisenhower and Vice-President Nixon, the Legion's National Commander Lewis K. Gough said it promoted \\"regular church attendance, daily family prayer, and the religious training of children.\\" The Legion's Americanism activities continued through to the 1950s. It promoted the passage of state bills requiring loyalty oaths of school teachers, and supported the activities of anti-Communist newspaper publishers, including William Randolph Hearst, in identifying Communist sympathizers in academic institutions. It was also influential in the creation of state-level legislative investigations into communist or un-American activities,Ceplair, p. 120 and staged a mock Communist takeover of Mosinee, Wisconsin that garnered national headlines.Ceplair, p. 121 Its programs were rejuvenated by increased membership after World War II, and in its 1950 convention called for members of the American Communist Party to be tried for treason. Along with the VFW, it maintained files on supposed Communist sympathizers, and it shared the fruits of its research with government investigators. Local posts picketed films they perceived as anti-American, and the national organization was formally involved in Hollywood's efforts to clear films of such influence. The list of names and organizations the Legion provided to movie studios formed the basis for the Hollywood blacklist, and supported the work of the House Un- American Activities Committee and its predecessors before and during the Cold War. It was unsuccessful in applying pressure to the movie studios when the blacklist began to crumble in the late 1950s.Ceplair, pp. 28, 33, 38, 121, 123, 198‚Äì200 The Legion's political activities were opposed from an early date by organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which characterized them as a danger to political and civil rights. In a report issued in 1921, the ACLU documented 50 instances of what it described as illegal acts of violence by Legionnaires. In 1927, the ACLU reported that the Legion \\"had replaced the [Ku Klux] Klan as the most active agent of intolerance and repression in the country.Ceplair, p. 38 The Legion, for its part, branded the ACLU as an un-American organization at every convention it held between 1920 and 1962.Ceplair, p. 241 In 1952, the Legion asked for a congressional investigation into the ACLU to determine if it was a communist or communist front organization.William A. Donohue, The Politics of the American Civil Liberties Union (New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 1985), p. 182 Veterans of the Korean War were approved for membership in The Legion in 1950, and The American Legion Child Welfare Foundation was formed in 1954. Although the Legion paid very close attention to the threat of domestic communism, it paid little attention to foreign affairs before 1945. It ignored the League of Nations. It was hostile to the Washington Naval Conference of 1921 that rolled back the naval arms race in the 1920s. Pacifism was popular in the 1920s, and Legion locals ridiculed it and sometimes booed the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom During World war II it accepted the wartime alliance with Stalin against Nazi Germany. As the Cold War emerged in 1946‚Äì47, the Legion paid increasing attention to an anti-Soviet foreign policy.Morten Bach, \\"None so consistently right: The American Legion's Cold War, 1945‚Äì1950,\\" (PhD dissertation, Ohio University, 2007) Excerpt Its Counter-Subversive Activities Committee in 1946 began publishing the American Legion Firing Line, a newsletter for members which provides information on communist, fascist, and other extremist groups to its subscribers. It warned members against far-right groups such as the John Birch Society and anti- Semitic groups By the late 1950s the newsletter became much more interested in foreign affairs.Ronald Lora and William Henry Longton, The Conservative Press in Twentieth-Century America (1999) pp 479‚Äì88. The Legion's policy resolutions endorsed large-scale defense spending and the deployment of powerful new weapon systems from the hydrogen bomb in the 1950s to Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative in the 1980s. Harry Truman was the first Legionnaire to occupy the White House, but he came under Legion attack for waging a limited war in Korea and not following the advice of General Douglas MacArthur in attacking China. By 1961 the Legion outright rejected the policy of containment, and called for the liberation of the captive peoples in Eastern Europe. Legion members typically hailed Barry Goldwater as their hero, But like Goldwater they rejected the extremism of the John Birch Society. The Legion supported increased intervention in Vietnam As well as anti-Communist forces in Central America and Afghanistan. The Legion never saw much benefit in the United Nations, and like other conservatives worried about a loss of American sovereignty to international bodies. The collapse of Soviet-style communism in Eastern Europe and in Russia itself saw the Legion looking to new venues for militaristic action. Thus, it praised President George H.W. Bush is intervention in Kuwait against Iraq in 1990. After 9-11, it vigorously endorsed President George W. Bush's strategy of a global war on terror, and it supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Timothy J Lynch, ed. The Oxford Encyclopedia of American Military and Diplomatic History (2013) 1: 38‚Äì40. On May 30, 1969, the Cabin John Bridge, which carried the Capital Beltway (I-495) across the Potomac River northwest of Washington, was officially renamed to the \\"American Legion Memorial Bridge\\" in a ceremony led by Lt. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, director of the U.S. Selective Service System.\\"Cabin John Bridge Given a New Name\\", The Washington Post, Times Herald (Washington, DC): City Life Section, May 31, 1969 In 1976, an outbreak of bacterial pneumonia occurred in a convention of the Legion at the Bellevue Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia. This pneumonia killed 34 people at the convention and later became known as Legionnaires' disease (Legionellosis). The bacterium that causes the illness was later named Legionella. In 1988, after over 44 years of opposing U.S. Merchant seamen from receiving benefits under the G.I. Bill, they allowed Merchant seamen to join The American Legion.Brian Herbert, The Forgotten Heroes: The Heroic Story of the United States Merchant Marine (New York: Forge, 2005), p. 201 This followed Merchant seamen being granted limited veterans status by the United States Secretary of the Air Force on January 19, 1988.Christine Scott; Douglas Reid Weimer, Veterans Benefits: Merchant Seamen (Washington, DC, Congressional Research Service, May 8, 2007), p. 1 After a 1989 U.S. Supreme Court decision (Texas v. Johnson), The American Legion launched and funded an unsuccessful campaign to win a constitutional amendment against harming the flag of the United States. The Legion formed the Citizens' Flag Honor Guard and it later became the Citizens Flag Alliance. = Close of the 20th century = American Legion sign in Maine In 1993, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts renamed a bridge in the city of Chicopee to the \\"American Legion Memorial Bridge\\". Also in 1993, two members of Garden City, Michigan, Post 396 shared an idea that would bond motorcycle enthusiasts in the Legion from the idea of Chuck Dare and post commander Bill Kaledas, creating the American Legion Riders. Joined by 19 other founding members, the group soon found itself inundated with requests for information about the new group. As a source of information a website was set up, and it continues to be a source of information worldwide. By 2009, the Legion Riders program had grown to over 1,000 chapters and 100,000 members in the United States and overseas. In a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton in May 1999, the Legion urged the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Operation Allied Force in Yugoslavia. The National Executive Committee of the Legion met and adopted a resolution unanimously that stated, in part, that they would only support military operations if \\"Guidelines be established for the mission, including a clear exit strategy\\" and \\"That there be support of the mission by the U.S. Congress and the American people.\\"  21st century  = 9/11 and the War on Terror = In 2006, the Chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, Steve Buyer (R-Ind.), announced that he planned to eliminate the annual congressional hearings for Veterans Service Organizations that was established by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In response, National Commander Thomas L. Bock said, \\"I am extremely disappointed in Chairman Buyer's latest effort to ignore the Veterans Service Organizations. Eliminating annual hearings before a joint session of the Veterans Affairs Committees will lead to continued budgetary shortfalls for VA resulting in veterans being underserved.\\" The Legion has criticized the ACLU for using the threat of attorney fees to pressure locally elected bodies into removing religion from the public square. As such the Legion states that it \\"is leading a nationwide effort to combat the secular cleansing of our American heritage\\", stating that the phrase \\"separation of church and state\\" is nowhere mentioned in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution The American Legion released a document titled \\"In the Footsteps of the Founders ‚Äì A Guide to Defending American Values\\" to be available to the citizens of the United States of America. The veteran's organization has done this to curtail religious-establishment cases against the Boy Scouts and the official display of the Ten Commandments and other religious symbols on public property. In October 2011, National Commander Jimmie L. Foster objected to courts allowing homosexuals to serve openly in the military. = Recent events = On March 25, 2014, the Legion testified before Congress in favor of the bill \\"To amend title 38, United States Code, to reestablish the Professional Certification and Licensure Advisory Committee of the Department of Veterans Affairs (H.R. 2942; 113th Congress).\\" They argued that the legislation would \\"benefit service members, as well as those who eventually employ veterans in civilian work-force easing the placement of qualified veterans in civilian careers, and matching civilian employers with skilled veteran employees.\\" The American Legion argued that this committee was important to the process of matching military certifications with their corresponding civilian ones, smoothing that transition for veterans, and that the committee provided much needed expertise on these matters to the VA. The Legion said that \\"there is a definite need to resume this independent body with expertise in matters relating to licensing and credentialing which can present new solutions to VA's senior leadership and congressional members as well as other stakeholders.\\" In 2014, Verna L. Jones was appointed as the first female executive director of the Legion. In August 2017, Denise H. Rohan was elected as the first female national commander of the Legion.

After a supernatural disaster destroys most of North America, Navajo monster-slayer Maggie Hoskie must navigate a world of monsters and gods. The novel won the 2019 Locus Award for Best First Novel and was nominated for the Hugo, World Fantasy, and Locus Awards for Best Novel. Plot summary In the 21st century, a worldwide flood caused by multiple earthquakes along the New Madrid fault line destroys most of the United States as magic returns to the world. Din√©tah becomes an independent nation. Certain Navajo people develop clan powers based on their ancestral tribes. On Maggie Hoskie's sixteenth birthday, her grandmother is murdered by witches and monsters. This traumatic event activates her clan powers, giving Maggie superhuman speed and a propensity for killing. She attracts the attention of the immortal monster-slayer Neizgh√°n√≠ and becomes his apprentice. Neizgh√°n√≠ trains her in the art of combat, but abandons her when he perceives that she is becoming too violent. Maggie becomes a bounty hunter and monster-slayer. She seeks information about a new breed of monster from Tah, a local medicine man. Tah tells her that the monster was created by a powerful witch. He asks her to work with his grandson Kai Arviso, who also possesses clan powers, to destroy the witch. Maggie and Kai retrieve information about a relic known as a \\"fire drill\\", which may be related to the monsters. She is visited by MƒÖ ºii, the Coyote; MƒÖ ºii tells her that the drill belongs to M√≥s√≠, a cat goddess. He also requests that she complete a task for him, giving her magical rings. Tah's hogan burns down; Maggie suspects Neizgh√°n√≠. In the carnage, Maggie and Kai kill a corrupt police officer. They seek shelter with Grace Goodacre, a local bar owner. Maggie, Kai, and Grace's children begin working together. M√≥s√≠ promises to give the fire drill to the winner of a duel. Maggie agrees and is ordered to fight Neizgh√°n√≠. He brands her and almost kills her, but she is rescued by Kai. Maggie seeks revenge against Neizgh√°n√≠, believing him to be responsible for the death of Tah and the creation of the monsters. They return to Black Mesa, where Maggie last saw Neizgh√°n√≠. As Kai and the Goodacres are ambushed by monsters on Black Mesa, MƒÖ ºii appears and reveals to Maggie that he controls the monsters. He was responsible for the murder of her grandmother, leading to the activation of her clan powers; he was also responsible for Maggie's duel with Neizgh√°n√≠. He wants to forge Maggie into a powerful warrior. Furious at this revelation, Maggie kills him and returns to the battlefield, where Neizgh√°n√≠ has defeated the monsters and is now threatening Kai, whom he considers to be a rival. Neizgh√°n√≠ offers Maggie a choice: fight and die now, or betray Kai and return to him. Maggie kills Kai, believing that his clan powers will resurrect him. She then uses MƒÖ ºii's rings to bind Neizgh√°n√≠, temporarily incapacitating him and removing his powers. At Maggie's trailer, Tah and Maggie wait for Kai to return. Background Rebecca Roanhorse began writing fantasy as a hobby while pursuing a career as a lawyer. She stated that when she was unable to find a science fiction or fantasy novel with a Native American protagonist, she decided to write one. Roanhorse is black and Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo, but she decided to write a story based on Navajo culture because her daughter is Navajo on her father's side. Roanhorse believes that many Native American fictional characters are portrayed as stuck in the past, and she wanted to use her novel to show Native characters as \\"alive and thriving\\". Reception and awards Trail of Lightning received mostly positive critical reviews. The Verge called it a \\"much-needed perspective to the larger canon of fantasy fiction\\", praising it for its portrayal of Native American characters. Critics also praised Trail of Lightning for its fast-paced action and complex characters. Locus called the novel \\"immensely readable and very enjoyable\\" and praised it for its worldbuilding; it also criticized the novel for shallow dialogue and a disjointed plot structure. The Din√© Writers' Collective criticized the novel as cultural appropriation, stating that someone not of Din√© ancestry \\"does not have the authority or experience to write about our people and culture\\". They feel that important Navajo spiritual beliefs were portrayed inaccurately. They also criticized the way in which some book reviewers have conflated different tribes of Native Americans into one identity. Trail of Lightning was nominated for 2018 Nebula Award for Best Novel, the 2019 World Fantasy Award for Best Novel, and the 2019 Hugo Award for Best Novel. It won the 2019 Locus Award for Best First Novel.

History Overhead view from a Louisiana city park on top of the bluffs Another view looking east The overhead plaque Champ Clark Bridge was formerly a toll bridge.Map of Missouri Showing State Road System , January 1, 1930 The bridge was named after James Beauchamp Clark, a former Speaker of the House from Bowling Green, Missouri. Clark served as Speaker from 1911 to 1919. During construction, a span of the bridge collapsed on September 6, 1927 due to faulty false work. The second span from the Missouri shore collapsed without warning just after quitting time. Two workmen were on still the span resulting in one fatality and one serious injury. This span collapse caused the failure of the first company formed to finance construction of the bridge, delaying completion for at least one year. The bridge was designed by Harrington, Howard and Ash, with construction being completed by the Missouri Valley Bridge and Iron Co. of Leavenworth, KS, and Wisconsin Bridge and Iron Co. of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The bridge was narrow, allowing for two lanes of traffic on a deck. The bridge, originally painted silver, was repainted deep green in 1983, and repaired in 1999. In 2005, the Missouri Department of Transportation again rehabbed and repainted the bridge, replacing the green color of the bridge with gray. The bridge is 2,286.4 feet (697 m) in length. The span over the main channel of the Mississippi River is 418.5 feet (128 m) in length. In 2013, MoDOT heightened restrictions on oversized loads on the bridge, citing its age and width. Pull-off areas were constructed, and all wide/oversized loads were required to pull over and call the Louisiana police department for an escort. In 2014, a legal weight limit of 40 tons was put into place and the speed limit was reduced to 30 mph, due to accelerated deterioration. Until its replacement bridge opened, MoDOT affirmed that the bridge was safe to travel so long as motorists complied with the posted weight and speed limits. Replacement In 2015, MoDOT and IDOT were jointly awarded a federal TIGER grant to replace the bridgereduce the cost to each state and Illinois committed its share. In 2016, MoDOT announced inclusion of funding for its portion of the bridge replacement cost in its draft five-year plan.http://www.louisianapressjournal.com/modot-official-confirms-new-champ- clark-bridge/ The new bridge opened on August 3, 2019, and retained the name of the old span.

Its nearest higher neighbor is Mount Olympus, to the east. Due to heavy winter snowfalls, Mount Tom supports the massive White Glacier on its northeast slope, despite its modest elevation. This glacier is the westernmost glacier in the contiguous states, and the summit is the westernmost peak higher than 7000+ feet elevation. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Hoh River. History The mountain was originally named Mount Reid in 1890 by the Seattle Press Expedition for Whitelaw Reid, editor and proprietor of the New-York Tribune. The history of the mountain's present name has two competing stories. One has it named for Thomas M. Hammond, Jr., a surveyor active in the west end of the Olympic Peninsula from 1895 to 1904. The second version has it named after boy scout Thomas Martin, a member of the 1914 first ascent climbing party led by Edmond S. Meany. Meany, who was then the Commissioner of Scouting in Seattle, promised the party of scouts that the first to reach the summit would have it named for him, and the 13-year-old bested his companions. Tom Martin would later become Washington State Treasurer, and a candidate for governor in 1952. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Tom is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times. Gallery Mt. Tom from north.jpgMt.

She studied physics at the University of Mumbai, and earned her Bachelor's and master's degree there in 1990. As an undergraduate student she was disinterested in optics. Her professor, S.B. Patel, proposed that she applied to work in biomedical engineering. She moved to the University of Texas at Austin for her doctoral studies, where she completed a Master's and PhD in 1996. There, she began working with fluorescence spectroscopy under the supervision of Rebecca Richards-Kortum.  Research and career  Mahadevan-Jansen joined the faculty at Vanderbilt University in 1996 and is currently Orrin H. Ingram Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Professor of Neurological Surgery. She founded the Vanderbilt Biophotonics Center, where she works on optical diagnostics, surgical guidance, and neurophotonics. She is interested in translating optical technologies into in vivo diagnostic tools. Mahadevan-Jansen pioneered the use of in vivo Raman spectroscopy for non-invasive diagnostics cervical dysplasia. Her methodology is being developed for use in clinical medicine, for example, it may be used by surgeons in the treatment of breast and brain cancer. She created optical blood testing methodologies for neonatal babies, which was selected by the Vanderbilt University Center for Technology Transfer as one of the \\"coolest inventions\\" of the year. She developed sensors that can detect inflammation caused by bowel disease into a typical colonoscopy procedure. In 2005, Dr. Mahadevan-Jansen and collaborators (including her husband, Dr. E Duco Jansen) discovered the ability to control peripheral and central nervous system electrical activity label-free with short pulses of infrared light. Termed infrared neural stimulation (INS), the field of label- free neuromodulation has evolved over the last decade built on these initial findings. This technology has demonstrated as safe and clinically translatable in humans.

Relations between Spain and Sweden are mainly defined by their membership in the European Union.  Historical relations  Swedish interest in Spain comes from afar, especially, due to the fact that the Visigoths, from the current Swedish region of G√∂taland, were strongly linked to the social and political transformation of Hispania, the Visigothic Kingdom. Creating, what could be, the oldest state in Europe. Already for the year 840 the Vikings arrived in Galician coasts and then in Andalusian in search of fortune and good business. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Sweden had a keen interest in getting salt for food preservation. Some consuls of Sweden in C√°diz had this business as their absolute priority. In 1651 a free trade agreement was signed between Spain and Sweden. In those years, trade in Spain was basically limited to the sale of salt, wine and other foods, compared to wood, iron and copper from Sweden. Historically, relations have not been very close due to the opposition between Nordic and Protestant peoples against southern and Catholic peoples, also exalted by the confrontation with Spain in the religious wars of 17th century. The Civil War (1936-1939) generated a great debate at national level in Sweden about the attitude that the government should take, however, it was decided to maintain neutrality, which did not prevent more 500 Swedish volunteers will travel to Spain to be part of the International Brigades.El papel de Suecia en la guerra civil espa√±ola (1936-1939), Camacho Padilla, Fernando & Asunci√≥n Criado, Ana The years of 1978 and 1979 meant the full normalization of political relations between Spain and Sweden, leaving any reluctance at the level of political parties in relation to the Spanish political process.http://elpais.com/diario/1979/10/14/internacional/308703603_850215.html Actualidad pol√≠tica de Suecia y de sus relaciones con Espa√±a, El Pa√≠s, 14 de abril de 1979  Bilateral relations  Olof Palme and Felipe Gonz√°lez photographed in La Moncloa in September 1984 The most important events at the bilateral level were visits to Madrid by former Foreign Affairs Minister Karin Soder and Prime Minister Ullsten, the first time in the history of the two countries that a Foreign Minister and a Swedish Prime Minister were traveling officially to Spain. The results can be described as profitable due to the multiplier effect obtained in the other Scandinavian countries. Fruit of all this was the invitation of the Swedish monarchs to the Kings of Spain to officially visit this country in 1979. Spain and Sweden maintain a dialogue on the challenges facing the EU. The development of the European digital single market and other free trade agreements between the EU and countries such as US are common interests between both countries. At present, Sweden and Spain have excellent bilateral relations. Relations are characterized by cooperation within the EU and an important trade exchange. Spain is the main tourist destination of the Swedes.  Economic relations  In the 21st century, trade has more to do with high-tech products and innovation and sectors such as the environment, telecommunications and information technology. Also in the fashion sector, there is great competition between H&M; and Zara in this sector worldwide. The economic component of bilateral relations has been reinforced since Sweden's accession to the EU on January 1 of 1995 and has been an essential element of bilateral relations, due, above all, to the significant Swedish investments in Spain, both business and residential, as well as the large influx of tourists, consolidated for decades.http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Documents/FichasPais/suecia_FICHA%20PAIS.pdf Office of Diplomatic Information  Embassies  The Embassy of Spain is located in Stockholm, Sweden.

It is about a project headed by documentary filmmaker Steve Elkins that used lidar to search for archaeological sites in the R√≠o Pl√°tano Biosphere Reserve of the Gracias a Dios Department in the Mosquitia region of eastern Honduras. The expedition was a joint Honduran-American multidisciplinary effort involving Honduran and American archaeologists, anthropologists, engineers, geologists, biologists and ethnobotanists.https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/03/150302-honduras- lost-city-monkey-god-maya-ancient- archaeology/https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/deep-in-the-honduran- rain-forest-an-ecological-swat-team-explores-a-lost-world Elkins' search was inspired by rumors of La Ciudad Blanca, also known as the White City. Preston cites mentions by Spanish conquistadors and others. The title of the book derives from four expeditions launched in the 1930s by the Museum of the American Indian (Heye Foundation) in which Honduran informants described to explorers, including Theodore Morde, sensationalized stories of a lost city with a pyramid topped by a giant stone statue of a monkey god somewhere in the Mosquitia region. Preston's book debunks Morde's claim of having found a city. After a privately funded lidar survey revealed complex archaeological sites under the rainforest cover, Preston accompanied a joint Honduran-American expedition to do ground truthing of the lidar results. They were able to confirm the presence of large abandoned prehispanic settlements and to document plazas, terracing, canals, roads, earthen structures including a pyramid, and concentrations of artifacts, among them decorated cylindrical stone vessels and metates, confirming the existence of an ancient city. The official name of the principal archaeological site that was mapped has been changed to the City of the Jaguar. Preston also documents the travails of several members of the expedition who contracted severe cases of leishmaniasis, a disease caused by parasites that are transmitted by the bite of sandflies. The book describes decades of exploration and archaeological surveys in the region as early as the 1920s, as well as the searches of early adventurers for the mythical lost city. Prior to the publication of the book, Preston reported the findings in the New Yorker magazinehttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/10/20/the-lost-city and National Geographic magazine.https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2015/10/lost-city- mosquitia-honduras-monkey-god/ The discovery of the city generated criticism from some archaeologists who were not involved in the project.

Biography He finished elementary school and a six- year course at the high school in Baja. He completed his philosophy in Szeged and Gy≈ër, the seventh and eighth grades of high school. He began his law studies in Pest, but after one year of study, he decided to move to Sremski Karlovci to study theology instead. He completed his seminary in Sremski Karlovci, and then, at the invitation of Belgrade Metropolitan Peter, moved to Serbia in 1834. In the same year, he became a deacon and worked as a clerk in the metropolitan area. In 1835 he was elevated to proto-deacon. A seminary was founded in Belgrade in 1836 and Gavrilo became a professor of the newly- established Belgrade seminary. He remained in that service until 1839. From 1839 he was named professor at the Lyceum with five others (Aleksije Okolski, Atanasije Teodoroviƒá, Isidor Stojanoviƒá, Atanasije Nikoliƒá, Konstantin Brankoviƒá) in Kragujevac, then the capital of Serbia.

In March 1917, it was organized as Grubbs Vocational College (GVC), a junior college that was a branch campus of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (AMC), which later became Texas A&M; University. Open only to white students, the curriculum at GVC centered around the agricultural, industrial, and mechanical trades. In May 1923, the college was renamed North Texas Agricultural College (NTAC) due to the rapid expansion of its liberal arts curriculum, the fact that it was no longer just a vocational institution, and its quickly growing enrollment. During the Great Depression and World War II, NTAC survived major declines in enrollment and multiple attempts by the state government to close it. Beginning in 1937, there was a movement in Arlington to elevate NTAC to four-year college status, but this goal would not be realized for more than two decades. Student life during the NTAC era was vibrant, although there was a cultural split between the students who lived on campus and those who commuted for classes. In September 1949, the college was renamed Arlington State College (ASC), in part because agriculture was no longer a major course of study. During the 1950s, it was the largest state junior college in the Southwest, and it grew to be the 5th largest state- supported college or university in Texas by 1959. During the 1950s, enrollment in courses in the arts and sciences, business, and engineering grew substantially, while the college ended its agriculture program in 1957. Between 1950 and 1965, ASC conducted a major building campaign that resulted in the creation of 18 new buildings on campus at a cost of $14.225 million. On April 27, 1959, Governor Price Daniel signed the bill that made ASC a four- year college. After the addition of junior-level courses in fall 1959 and senior-level courses in fall 1960, ASC awarded its first 23 bachelor's degrees in 1961. In response to a legal challenge to its segregationist admissions policy, ASC announced its integration in July 1962 and admitted its first African American students in September. ASC experienced growing disillusionment with the Texas A&M; University System due to is supporters' belief that Texas A&M; subjugated ASC's interests, was too rigid in administrative style, and did not invest adequately in the Arlington college as it was growing quickly. ASC lobbied for separation from A&M; and ultimately admission into the University of Texas System, which occurred when Texas governor John Connally signed Senate Bill 401 into law on April 23, 1965. Athletics at ASC were dominated by the football team, which won back-to-back Junior Rose Bowls in 1956 and 1957, bringing the college national recognition for the first time. ASC also created a men's swimming program during the mid-1960s that featured Doug Russell, a collegiate national champion who would go on to win a gold medal at the 1968 Summer Olympics.  Grubbs Vocational College (1917‚Äì1923)  Vincent W. Grubbs, namesake of Grubbs Vocational College Grubbs Vocational College (GVC) was organized as a junior college in March 1917. It was established as a branch campus of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (AMC), which later became Texas A&M; University. The namesake of GVC was Vincent W. Grubbs, a judge from Greenville who was instrumental in the creation of the college. Grubbs was a strong supporter of the state's agricultural, industrial, and mechanical schools, which he believed provided a critical education \\"for the poor boys and girls of Texas\\". He was convinced that the existing system of higher education in the state was unfair to poor and rural children, particularly those growing up on farms. Grubbs himself was a native of Kentucky who moved to Texas during his childhood, eventually becoming a lawyer and a contributor and co-owner of a newspaper. In 1902, he was instrumental in the establishment of the College of Industrial Arts (later renamed Texas Woman's University) in Denton. In spring 1917, Grubbs lobbied the 35th legislative session in Austin to secure the establishment of what was to become GVC through House Bill 656 and Senate Bill 449. While he was at the capitol, his friend A. D. Jackson recommended the name \\"Grubbs Vocational College\\" for the school. On March 20, the parallel bills were passed by both the Texas Senate and House of Representatives, and on March 25 Texas governor James E. Ferguson signed them into law. The bills defined the mission of GVC to be \\"the education of white boys and girls\\" in Texas. They also established John Tarleton Agricultural College (JTAC) in Stephenville, likewise as part of the AMC system. GVC was established with its own advisory \\"local board of managers\\", but this body was placed under the direction and ultimate authority of the board of directors at AMC in College Station. Grubbs himself was never selected as dean of GVC, a snub that caused lasting resentment for him. From its establishment in 1917 through 1925 (after the college was renamed), Myron L. Williams served as the dean of GVC. He was a colleague and friend of AMC president William Bizzell, and he was given the title of dean instead of president because GVC was a branch campus of the school in College Station. Williams was a native of Oenaville, Texas, who was educated at Sam Houston Normal Institute, the University of Texas at Austin, and Columbia University. He had teaching experience in Amarillo, Clarendon, and Miami as well as at the College of Industrial Arts in Denton. The curriculum at GVC centered around the agricultural, industrial, and mechanical trades. Classes in bookkeeping, commercial law, home economics, and stenography were also taught. The college provided its students with two years of secondary education and two years of college-level education. When GVC first opened, it offered college-level agricultural courses for male students and household arts courses for female students. The curriculum closely resembled that at AMC so that male students could easily transfer to College Station. Students had to be 14 years of age in order to enroll. The college's cadet program was obligatory for all male students, and it comprised one battalion with four companies and eight platoons. In 1918, GVC established its Student Army Training Corps (SATC), which inducted students into the United States Army as privates. A total of 62 male GVC students participated in the SATC, although none saw active duty in Europe before Armistice Day in November 1918. The campus more broadly supported the war effort by donating to the American Red Cross and United War Work Fund, purchasing Liberty bonds and war savings stamps, and conserving food. In 1919‚Äì20, GVC created an entire program for disabled soldiers returning from World War I. In fall 1921, the college established its Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), to which the War Department assigned Captain Carl A. Bishop and Lieutenant L. W. Caine. Captain Bishop also established a rifle team at GVC. Sewing laboratory at GVC, undated Female students had to sew their own gingham dresses as part of their uniform while all students had to wear their uniforms while on campus and boarding students had to wear their uniforms at all times. Female students who lived on campus also had to cook their own meals and clean their dormitory. Students were given demerits for being out of uniform, being tardy to class, or breaking any of GVC's conduct rules. In 1919, GVC student Rosemary Ribbon complained that \\"you get demerits for everything you do and for everything you don't do\\". In early 1918, GVC survived a proposal by the state's Central Legislative Investigating Committee to abolish it or terminate its college farm, which was proposed largely due to the high cost of land in Arlington. While the proposal was not implemented, GVC responded to the threat by establishing automobile repair courses and additional commercial courses to diversify itself beyond an agricultural curriculum. GVC survived additional proposals by the state legislature to abolish it in 1921 and 1923. At first, GVC did not charge its students tuition, while room and board cost students $20 per month and textbooks cost approximately $15‚Äì20 per year. Fees increased substantially by the early 1920s, with maintenance fees for a semester reaching as high as $86.40. Students could in live in dormitories on campus, at home, or in approved boarding houses, but by 1922 Dean Williams admitted that the dormitories were in poor condition and needed to be replaced. During its first semester in 1917, the enrollment at GVC was just 66 students: 40 women and 26 men. Male enrollment was especially low due to American participation in World War I. During the 1918‚Äì19 academic year, enrollment grew to 192: 143 men and 49 women. By 1919‚Äì20, this number had grown to 444, with students representing 54 of the counties of Texas. During the 1920‚Äì21 academic year, GVC had 411 students, by 1921‚Äì22 it had 680, and by 1922‚Äì23 it had reached 808 students. In 1918, there were no graduates from GVC, while there were only eight in 1919 and five in 1920. The number of graduates grew slowly to 12 in 1921, 13 in 1922, and finally to 23 in 1923. Group photograph of GVC faculty, undated On its first day of classes in 1917, GVC had a faculty of 14 teachers. By 1920, this number doubled to 28. The faculty tended to be young and fairly inexperienced, and the college had difficulty retaining them due to its noncompetitive salary scale. This problem was compounded by the state's 30% reduction in GVC's appropriations over the course of its existence between 1917 and 1923, despite the substantial increase in the size of its student body. Nonetheless, state funding for GVC was described by historian and author Gerald Saxon as \\"relatively stable\\", noting that it provided a \\"basic level of support\\". By 1923, Dean Williams asked AMC to rename GVC, which had come to see the word \\"vocational\\" in its name as limiting to its future growth. Additionally, being named \\"Grubbs\\" seemed to incorrectly imply that it was a private school. In July 1923, the Texas Legislature changed the name of the school to North Texas Junior Agricultural College, which was soon officially shortened to North Texas Agricultural College (NTAC). By this point, Arlington's residents and leading citizens had demonstrated considerable support for the college. Saxon argues that, in 1923, \\"for the first time in the history\\" of the college, \\"the future looked bright\\". = Building development = Construction of the Administration Building, circa 1918‚Äì19 GVC inherited the campus of the defunct Arlington Military Academy. It also purchased an additional of farmland from James Fielder to create a demonstration farm. Fielder's land is where Maverick Stadium and the J. D. Wetsel Service Center were later constructed. Aside from Fielder's farmland, the GVC campus only measured in 1922. Upon arriving on campus in 1917, Dean Williams wrote that its condition was \\"badly neglected\\" and \\"in a state of decay\\". At the time, there were seven buildings in total: the academic building, two barracks, a women's dormitory, a mess hall, a gymnasium, and the dean's cottage. In 1919, GVC completed the construction of its new Administration Building at the cost of $112,500. In addition to administrative offices, it also housed an auditorium, classrooms, laboratories, and a library. Later renamed Ransom Hall, it is still standing on campus. Dean Williams also constructed an automotive shop, a machine shop, and a mess hall during the 1919‚Äì20 academic year. In December 1922, five state legislators pledged their support for an unrealized building program at GVC that would have allocated $150,000 for a dormitory with a dining hall and $100,000 for a science building. = Student life = Male students at GVC could join the Star Literary or Wilsonian debating societies, the Glee Club, or the Young Men's Christian Association. Female students could choose from the Chorus Club, Gro-Voco Club, and the Roundup Club. The Dramatic Club was open to both male and female students. The Shorthorn, the student newspaper, began as a monthly magazine in April 1919 before becoming a weekly newspaper in 1922. Students were required to attend chapel services three or four times per week, while dancing and smoking were both forbidden on campus during Dean Williams's tenure. Popular activities for GVC students included picnics and field trips, with destinations including Camp Bowie in Fort Worth, the Fort Worth Fat Stock Show, and the State Fair of Texas in Dallas. In 1995, Franklin Dowell, the oldest living graduate of GVC, recalled playing French horn in the college band, writing for The Shorthorn, and going to see shows at the Majestic Theatre in Dallas before he graduated in 1921. = Athletics = GVC required its students, regardless of gender, to participate in one hour of physical exercise every day. The school sponsored a women's basketball team. Men could participate in baseball, basketball, football, tennis, and track and field. The school colors were blue and white and GVC teams were nicknamed the Grubbworms from 1917 until 1921, when the nickname was changed to Hornets. GVC intercollegiate athletics teams competed in the Texas Junior College Athletic Association.  North Texas Agricultural College (1923‚Äì1949)  In May 1923, GVC was renamed North Texas Agricultural College (NTAC) due to the rapid expansion of its liberal arts curriculum, the fact that it was no longer just a vocational institution, and its quickly growing enrollment. GVC dean Myron L. Williams continued to serve in the same capacity for NTAC until 1925. That year, Edward Everett Davis succeeded him, and Davis would ultimately serve the college as dean until 1946. He had been born in 1881 in Williamsburg, Missouri, moved to Texas as a child in 1885, and graduated from JTAC and the University of Texas at Austin. Prior to being named dean of NTAC, he was the principal of the Lingleville public school and subsequently worked in the education department of Stephen F. Austin State Teacher's College in Nacogdoches. Upon beginning his tenure as dean in 1925, Davis inherited a campus in poor shape physically with a small student body and less than adequate faculty. After adopting the slogan \\"no dead-beats in faculty or student body\\", NTAC dismissed or witnessed the withdrawal of 102 out of 456 students in Davis's first year (1925‚Äì26), while by 1927‚Äì28 only 17 of the 40 faculty members he inherited in 1925 were still employed by NTAC. When hiring new faculty, Davis demonstrated his preference for young, energetic, and capable teachers. In 1925, NTAC offered two different educational tracks: a college track designed to prepare students to transfer to a senior college and a trades or vocational track designed to train students for working in fields such as agriculture, automotive repair, electrical trades, and stenography. Due to falling enrollment in the department by 1933, NTAC discontinued its high school-level, sub-college department, which dated back to the GVC era. Previously, it had served \\"under-privileged boys and girls from rural communities\\" mostly in Central Texas and West Texas, and their ages were, on average, older than students in the college track. A survey conducted by NTAC shortly after Davis arrived revealed North Texas to be in particular need of skilled workers in fields such as animal husbandry, aviation, dairying, the electrical trades, and mechanical engineering. In response to this survey, the college added courses in these areas. NTAC was also innovative in the large amount of summer classes and night classes it offered as well as marketing directly to married and older students. In fall 1925, 15 of the college's hogs won a total of 75 ribbons at state fairs in Alabama, Arkansas, and Louisiana in addition to at three fairs in Texas. More than 40% of NTAC's 1926 graduating class enrolled immediately in senior colleges across the state, including Southern Methodist University, Texas A&M;, and the University of Texas. Enrollment at NTAC grew markedly from 451 in 1925‚Äì26 to 821 in 1929‚Äì30, although Davis expressed concern over the quality of many entrants. He argued that a high school diploma was not sufficient and that an entrance exam should be required for all potential students. He even went as far as to claim that 25% of Texas's higher education appropriations were \\"practically wasted on inferior students\\". Fees at NTAC were relatively low in this era, with 1926‚Äì27 seeing a room and board fee of $125 and all of the other eight fees being less than $10. In 1931, NTAC advertised itself under the slogan \\"Free Tuition, Broad Curricula, High Standards, Easy Access\\", the latter of which emphasized its location between Dallas and Fort Worth and its accessibility by both road and rail transport. In 1930‚Äì31, enrollment fell to 657 students due to the Great Depression. NTAC would not surpass its 1929‚Äì30 enrollment figure until 1933‚Äì34, when the number of students reached 954. The depression particularly hurt NTAC's vocational program, especially its agriculture, home economics, and trades and industries departments. Furthermore, an innovative cooperative program partnering with local industries that NTAC developed based on a program at the University of Cincinnati and Antioch College was discontinued in 1933 due to a lack of available jobs. While its vocational program foundered, NTAC's college program grew tremendously, from 308 students in 1930 to 603 students in 1933. Davis speculated that this growth was due to an influx of transfer students from less-affordable private schools and a changing attitude during the depression that a liberal arts education was more adaptable and thus more marketable than a more specialized vocational education. NTAC also responded to the depression by increasing the average number of courses assigned to each faculty member, reducing the total number of faculty, and cutting salaries by 25%. However, in December 1932, the firm of Griffenhagen and Associates published a report for the state legislature on NTAC's operations, concluding that the Davis administration had not done enough in the face of the depression. The report found that the college was overwhelmingly a commuter school and recommended that the state \\"abandon\\" and cease funding it, instead proposing that Dallas County and Tarrant County operate it jointly as a junior college. The report made numerous other suggestions to NTAC, ranging from discontinuing all agriculture and education courses to eliminating 14 faculty positions, the associate dean, and most student assistants. It also admonished Davis for advertising NTAC excessively. However, the findings of Griffenhagen and Associates were ultimately unpopular across the state and had little impact on the college. One effect the 1932 report did have was in reducing the number of classes NTAC taught with 10 or fewer students enrolled in them. In 1932, when the report was issued, 36.1% of the college's classes fell into this category, but by 1940, just 7% did, which was the lowest such figure at any state college or university in Texas. After an aborted attempt to close the school surfaced in the state legislature in 1935, NTAC would never again face a serious threat of closure or termination of state support. NTAC had slowly recovered from the depression by the mid-1930s as its enrollment grew. In 1935‚Äì36, enrollment hit 1,007, the first time it had eclipsed 1,000, and by 1939‚Äì40 there were 1,632 students in total. Saxon concludes that the two key reasons for this growth in enrollment were NTAC's location between Dallas and Fort Worth and its financial support from the state. In the end, NTAC emerged from the depression with its curriculum still grounded in general and vocational studies. In summer 1937, NTAC was one of only four colleges or universities in the state to host a National Youth Administration rural farm education program for in-need youth, joining JTAC, Prairie View A&M;, and Texas A&M.; Also in 1937, Howard Joyner came to NTAC from the University of South Dakota to establish an art department. Trained at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, Joyner established NTAC's art department before one existed at the University of Texas. In 1939, the Denton Record- Chronicle described NTAC as essentially \\"a junior college of Dallas and Fort Worth students who want to get a portion of their education close to home before going to a senior college\\". Electrical shop at NTAC, circa 1940s After the United States entered World War II in 1941, NTAC experienced a major decline in enrollment and saw many faculty members leave to serve in the war, which forced the college to retool its course offerings. While female enrollment stayed steady at about 300 students per year throughout the war, male enrollment dropped precipitously by 47% from 1941 to 1945. During 1944‚Äì45, total enrollment had fallen to 1,041 students, down 782 from four years previously. The Davis administration tried to slow the decline in enrollment by recruiting more female students as well as male students under 18 years old. During the war, full-time faculty fell from 77 to 53, while those who remained on campus were required to take a loyalty oath. Courses changed due to the war as well, with new offerings in subjects such as aerial photography and camouflage along with a new flight training program, one of only 13 at colleges or universities that was conducted by the Civil Aeronautics Authority. Women were allowed to take engineering classes for the first time beginning in 1943 while NTAC's ROTC cadets learned commando techniques, Japanese, and jujutsu. In 1943, NTAC was designated as a Navy V-12 instructional center, and during 1944 and 1945 there were four Navy and three Marine platoons assigned to campus. A women's rifle team was also created during the war years. In April 1945, Davis prepared a report for Texas A&M;'s president and board that painted an optimistic picture of the future of NTAC, most notably predicting an enrollment of 2,500 shortly after the end of the war. Davis retired on June 1, 1946, at age 65, and by 1946‚Äì47 NTAC's enrollment did reach 2,500. Returning soldiers, assisted by the G.I. Bill, accounted for a large part of this growth and made up as much as 46% of the entire student body. Davis's legacy on campus includes Davis Street, which was named for him, and the grove of pine trees at the corner of Davis Street and Park Row Drive that he himself planted. In 1946, Ernest H. Hereford was named dean of NTAC at Davis's replacement, and he served as such until a reorganization of the college and the other Texas A&M-affiliated; schools made him NTAC's first president in October 1948. The reorganization formally created the Texas A&M; University System on September 1, 1948, and instituted the new position of chancellor as the head of the system. At the same time, the chief administrators at its four constituent schools (A&M;, JTAC, NTAC, and Prairie View A&M;) were named presidents. While the reorganization relieved the A&M; president of the additional duties of serving as the de facto chancellor of the system, in practice the system retained its rigid administrative structure and a commitment to keeping the three branch campuses subordinate to the main campus in College Station. Hereford had been educated at North Texas State Teachers College, Baylor University, Southwestern University, and the University of Texas at Austin. He served as superintendent of schools in Corpus Christi, president of Corpus Christi Junior College, state college examiner and curriculum director at the Texas Department of Education, and dean of staff at Dallas's Hockaday School before arriving at NTAC. While in Arlington, he was groomed to be Davis's successor and promoted from registrar to associate dean in 1943 before being named dean in 1946. Similar to Davis, Hereford was criticized by some faculty as being \\"autocratic\\" and \\"egotistical\\", while other faculty praised him as a \\"sophisticate\\" and for his requirement for doctoral degrees as prerequisites for most new faculty. = Four-year college status = Beginning in 1937, there was a movement in Arlington to elevate NTAC to four-year college status and change the name of the college. Davis started supporting this movement in 1938. He argued that NTAC's location in North Texas, large student body, and relatively low cost per credit hour made it a strong candidate for senior- college status. Throughout the 1940s, the NTAC administration petitioned the Texas A&M; University board of directors and the state government to upgrade it to a senior college, albeit without any success. Opposition came not only from Texas A&M;, which many NTAC alumni and supporters believed feared the Arlington branch campus would eventually overtake it in both prestige and size, but also from local private schools Southern Methodist University and Texas Christian University. While not immediately successful in obtaining four-year college status, NTAC supporters did succeed in convincing the A&M; system and the state government to rename the school. Many supporters thought the name \\"North Texas Agricultural College\\" was limiting and confusing due to the word \\"agricultural\\", and the preferred choice of Arlington State College was made the official new name in summer 1949. Many of its supporters thought that such a move would enhance the college's prestige as well as the perceived value of its degrees. = Building development = left Despite many of its proposals for new buildings ultimately not being approved or funded by the state government, NTAC did receive funds to build a new library (later renamed College Hall) in 1926 and a new science building (later renamed Preston Hall) in 1928. In its 1926 budget proposal, for comparison, NTAC asked for four new buildings and total funding of over $830,000. In addition to hosting the library, College Hall was also home to the NTAC Exchange Store (PX), which sold accessories, military uniforms, and school supplies. Much later, it would become home to the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA)'s Honors College. A circular building on the south perimeter of Preston Hall was also built in 1928. Over the years, it would serve as a cattle show room, an art studio, History Department offices, an art printing laboratory, and the UTA planetarium. During the 1930s, two new buildings were constructed on campus. The first was a brick gymnasium and auditorium located adjacent to the Administration Building that opened in 1934. The second was a men's dormitory built with federal Public Works Administration funding known as Davis Hall, which opened in 1936 and was eventually renamed Brazos House. This building later became the first coeducational dormitory in Texas. In the early 1940s, NTAC constructed a Mechanical Arts Building that provided space for classrooms, offices, and workshops. By the late 1940s, the campus had grown in size to eight city blocks. = Student life = Student life during the NTAC era was vibrant, although there was a cultural split between the students who lived on campus and those who commuted for classes. The Shorthorn continued as the student newspaper, while in 1923 the first edition of the college yearbook, the Junior Aggie, was printed. Freshman at NTAC, referred to as \\"fish\\", were subject to hazing by sophomores. Hazing persisted despite efforts by Dean Davis to ban it and expel those found guilty of it. The student body elected cheerleaders, class officers, representatives on the Student-Faculty Committee, and a homecoming court consisting of a king, queen, princess, and escorts. Sam Houston Rifles, 1939 Except for those who were married or over 30 years old, all male students were members of the ROTC cadet corps, which was created in August 1923. In 1933, it established a drill team, which became the Sam Houston Rifles (nicknamed the \\"Jodies\\") in 1937. The Sam Houston Rifles eventually became the oldest extant organization in the ROTC program, and went on to perform in the 1957 inauguration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1939, NTAC's 34-member college band, under the direction of Col. Earl D. Irons, toured 14 cities throughout West Texas. Student behavior was strictly controlled at NTAC: a curfew was enforced starting at 7:20 pm every night, dancing was forbidden, firearms were prohibited, and demerits were given for rules infractions. At NTAC, classes were held five days a week, with lectures generally occurring in the morning and labs in the afternoon. Campus clubs and organizations typically met on Thursday afternoons, while social functions were generally scheduled for Friday and Saturday nights. Student clubs were also popular during the NTAC era, and by 1933 there were 25 such clubs on campus. These included clubs based on geographic origin (such as Dallas County, Tarrant County, and West Texas), activities and subjects, an honor society (Phi Kappa Theta), music clubs, and social clubs for female students. Other student activities during the period included a Students' Council, dances, performances, and lectures. Among the noted guest speakers on campus during this era were Texas folklorist J. Frank Dobie, Texas governor Beauford H. Jester, U.S. Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins, and historians Arnold Toynbee and Walter Prescott Webb. Grand Ole Opry star Minnie Pearl also entertained NTAC students in 1947. = Athletics = NTAC men's basketball team, 1944 NTAC fielded intercollegiate athletics teams using the \\"Hornets\\" nickname. Its football team consistently drew the largest crowds and most overall support. The NTAC Hornets played against other junior colleges as well as junior varsity teams from senior colleges. Common opponents included Decatur Baptist College, Hillsboro Junior College, Paris Junior College, Texarkana Junior College, and NTAC's chief rival, John Tarleton Agricultural College (JTAC) in Stephenville. In 1943, NTAC fielded an unusually strong football team due to a contingent of Marines who had been recruited to play football at SMU and TCU being ordered to report to the Arlington college that year. The 1943 Hornets beat SMU 20‚Äì6, defeated Texas Tech 34‚Äì14, and played Texas A&M; to a scoreless tie. In the estimation of Fort Worth Star-Telegram writer Dick Moore, it was \\"one of the strongest football teams in the Southwest\\" that season. NTAC and JTAC typically played each other for homecoming, and both held an Aggie Bonfire and a pep rally before the game. Long-standing tradition held that both student bodies tried to prematurely light the other's bonfire, until an ill-fated 1939 attempt by two NTAC students to drop a phosphorus bomb on the JTAC bonfire from an airplane ended in a crash landing and hazing by JTAC students. After this event, Dean Davis ended the annual NTAC bonfire. The school's fight song in this period was \\"Northaggieland\\", with music by NTAC band director Earl D. Irons and lyrics by Enid Eastland. NTAC also offered intercollegiate basketball, tennis, and track and field for male students. In 1938, the men's tennis team won the Central Texas Conference tournament, defeating teams from Hillsboro Junior College, JTAC, and Weatherford College. After 1927, the Women's Athletic Association offered basketball, indoor baseball, gymnastics, tennis, and volleyball for female students at NTAC. However, there were no opportunities for them to compete at the intercollegiate level.  Arlington State College (1949‚Äì1965)  Arlington State College graduation ceremony, circa 1950s In September 1949, NTAC was renamed Arlington State College (ASC), in part because agriculture was no longer a major course of study at the college. During the 1950s, it was the largest state junior college in the Southwest. It also grew from the 14th largest state-supported college or university in Texas in 1951 to the 5th largest in 1959. Similarly, Arlington itself grew from 6,000 people to 45,000 between 1950 and 1960. During the 1950s, ASC students began enrolling in courses in the arts and sciences, business, and engineering en masse. Engineering majors nearly quadrupled from 445 to 1,635 between 1953 and 1956. Also during the 1950s, the agriculture and home economics programs experienced a noticeable decrease in students. As the college's administration came to realize this was part of a national trend, it ended the agriculture program in 1957 and the home economics program in 1959. During the 1950s, ASC offered students the ability to study for the first two years of a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in a wide variety of subjects or pursue a two-year associate degree in general studies. On November 24, 1958, President Hereford died in office unexpectedly due to a heart attack at the age of 63. During his tenure, enrollment at the college nearly quadrupled. Both the Hereford Student Center and its Rosebud Theater (named for Hereford's nickname of \\"Old Rosebud\\") were named in his memory. The Texas A&M; directors appointed ASC dean Jack Woolf as acting president and eventually permanent president in June 1959. Woolf had been born and raised in Trinidad in East Texas, educated at both Texas A&M; and Purdue University, and worked at Convair for five years before returning to A&M; to teach in 1956. In 1957, he was named the dean of ASC. In 1958, ASC began outreach programs, including a cooperative program that involved its foreign language department with the Summer Institute of Linguistics in Dallas County. By the time it was finally awarded senior- college status in 1959, ASC's student enrollment was 6,388. By that year it was also awarding undergraduate degrees in the arts, business administration, the sciences, and engineering. From fall 1959, ASC billed itself as a regional institution that offered degrees in business, engineering, liberal arts, and the sciences. According to Samuel B. Hamlett, the growth of Arlington as well as the larger Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex pushed the rapid development of ASC after 1959. Enrollment grew to 7,444 in fall 1960 and to 9,116 in fall 1963, which made ASC larger than Texas A&M.; During this period, ASC was overwhelmingly a commuter school; in 1962, just 338 male students and 144 female students lived in dormitories on campus. Roughly 20% of students were part-time students and 30% were enrolled in evening classes that year. From 1959 through 1965, ASC was composed of two constituent schools. The first was the School of Arts and Sciences, which was home to its business, liberal arts, and science programs. The second was the School of Engineering, home to five different engineering programs. Upon the establishment of the schools in 1959, S. T. Keim, Jr. was hired as the Dean of Arts and Sciences while Wendell Nedderman was hired as the Dean of Engineering. In 1959, ASC's total budget was $3.1 million. A 1963 Dallas Morning News article opined that the college was \\"geared to the space age and also to the North Texas business and cultural community\\". In 1960, various departments at ASC began offering lecture series and short courses. Similarly, in 1964 the ASC History Department commenced the annual Walter Prescott Webb Memorial Lectures for the purpose of attracting leading American history scholars to campus. In 1964, ASC was accredited fully by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). ASC was also similarly accredited by the Texas Association of Colleges and Universities in 1962 as well as subject-specific associations for its undergraduate programs in accounting, architecture, business administration, engineering, nursing, and social work. By the mid-1960s, the number of faculty members at ASC had grown to approximately 400. At that time, about 50% of engineering faculty held Doctor of Philosophy degrees and over 40% of liberal arts and science faculty did likewise. Among the greatest complaints of faculty members at the time were the low academic level and lack of intellectual engagement of many students. Faculty attempted to remedy this by improving faculty-student communication. Faculty also advocated for greater opportunities to research and write, graduate-level programs, a faculty forum, and a policy on academic freedom. In 1965, the A&M; board approved ASC's request to divide the School of Arts and Sciences into separate schools for its three major programs, resulting in the creation of the School of Business, the School of Liberal Arts, and the School of Science. = Building development = Interior of the Arlington State College Library, circa 1963 Between 1950 and 1965, ASC conducted a major building campaign that resulted in the creation of 18 new buildings on campus at a cost of $14.225 million. This followed eight years of no construction whatsoever and a 30-year period since the construction of the college's last permanent classroom building. With $6.5 million in funding from the Permanent University Fund via the Texas A&M; University System, ASC built a men's dormitory (Pachl Hall), a women's dormitory (Lipscomb Hall), an engineering building, a science hall, a student center, and a football stadium (Memorial Stadium) between 1949 and 1957. By the late 1950s, with the support of A&M; system chancellor M. T. Harrington and the City of Arlington, President Hereford began acquiring land on both sides of Cooper Street for a proposed ten-year, $10-million building program. The Texas Attorney General's office used eminent domain to force landowners who did not wish to part with their property to sell it to the college. In November 1960, ASC released a master plan that proposed acquiring more land both east and south of campus. The plan also effectively controlled placement of buildings on campus through the 1990s. In quick succession in the early 1960s, ASC built a new engineering building for $2.25 million (in 1960), a new science building for $2.1 million (in 1961), and a new library for $1.5 million (in 1964). The two-story library was designed by George Dahl to later be expanded to six stories, which ultimately occurred in 1967. ASC also built an addition to its student center in 1961, expanded its football stadium and built a new gymnasium in 1962, and augmented dormitory capacity for both men (with the new Trinity House) and women (with an expansion to Lipscomb Hall). After the completion of the addition to the Hereford Student Center in 1961, the total value of ASC's buildings reached $9 million. In 1965, ASC opened its new Arlington State College Multipurpose Auditorium (renamed Texas Hall in 1968) with a performance by jazz musician Louis Armstrong. It served as a multi-purpose venue for athletics, concerts, and theater. During the 1960s ASC also became one of the first institutions of higher education in Texas to build facilities with \\"revenue financing\\", which was funded by both income from room and board payments and building-use fees included in tuition payments. Rapid growth of the campus by the mid-1960s was fueled by ASC's senior-college status, its developing graduate programs, and its frequent acquisition of land. = Four- year college status = Throughout the 1950s, President Hereford and ASC supporters, including Arlington mayor Tom Vandergriff, tried without success to have ASC elevated to four-year college status. Three bills proposing such a change all failed to be voted upon by the state legislature in 1951, 1955, and 1957. The A&M; board of directors was also reluctant to support ASC's aspirations to be a four-year school until 1958, when it committed to funding campus expansion in Arlington by selling the college's farm, which was located east of campus. In February 1957, Metroplex business leaders and Vandergriff addressed the Texas Commission on Higher Education (TCHE) in support of four- year status for ASC. However, the TCHE only committed to further consideration of the proposal and postponed making a decision before an in-depth study that could take up to 15 months was conducted, effectively delaying ASC's senior- college ambitions. The TCHE released its findings in December 1958, recommending to the Texas Legislature that ASC be made a senior college starting in September 1959 with baccalaureate-level degree programs in business administration as well as for numerous liberal arts and science programs. The location and size of ASC were particular reasons for the TCHE's decision. Despite opposition from Alonzo Jamison of Denton, which was home to North Texas State College (NTSC) and Texas Woman's University, and William T. Moore of Bryan, home to Texas A&M;, ASC's four-year bill passed the house on March 4, 1959. Its counterpart passed the Senate on April 20, 1959. Writing for the Denton Record-Chronicle, Tom Kirkland noted many NTSC supporters believed four-year status for ASC would have a considerable negative effect on their school, but NTSC president J. C. Matthews downplayed these concerns. On April 27, Governor Price Daniel signed the bill that made ASC a four-year college in the presence of ASC president Woolf, Arlington mayor Vandergriff, and other dignitaries. When the news reached the ASC campus, classes were abruptly canceled and spontaneous celebrations erupted. The headline in The Shorthorn on April 28, the next day, was simply \\"Made it at Last\\". Vandergriff later described ASC's attainment of four-year college status as \\"one of the most satisfying moments of my life\\". Implementation of senior-college courses began in fall 1959 with the addition of junior-level courses and concluded in fall 1960 with the addition of senior-level courses at ASC. In 1961, ASC awarded its first bachelor's degrees, granting degrees to 23 students in electrical and mechanical engineering. = Integration = One of the first African American students accepted to Arlington State College in 1962 (name of the student not noted) In 1959, when it became a four-year college, ASC remained open only to white students. At the time this was the policy of all Texas A&M-affiliated; colleges and universities except for Prairie View A&M;, which was then the only state-supported college for people of color in Texas. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the ASC administration refused to accept African American students, referring them to Prairie View A&M; instead. In 1997, Dallas native Jesse Oliver recalled being offended at being referred to Prairie View when he applied for admission to ASC in spring 1962. He noted that ASC was a 20-minute drive from his home in Dallas, compared to Prairie View's campus being four hours distant. As early as 1956 a poll conducted by The Shorthorn revealed a clear majority of polled ASC students (72 of 96) responded that they would be willing to attend classes with African American students. In 1962, after Ernest Hooper, Jerry Hanes, and Leaston Chase III were denied admission to ASC on account of race, they sought legal representation. They were represented by the Legal Redress Committee of the Dallas branch of the NAACP and Dallas attorney Fred J. Finch, Jr. Not willing to go to court to defend segregation at ASC, the A&M; system board of directors and Chancellor Harrington allowed ASC president Woolf to change the admission policy immediately and become the first A&M; system school to integrate. ASC announced its integration on July 10, 1962, and admitted its first African American students in September, becoming the 9th out of 19 state-supported Texas colleges and universities to integrate. The majority of both students and faculty supported integration at ASC, as did both Arlington newspapers, the Daily News Texan and the Arlington Citizen-Journal. However, President Woolf received angry letters and hate mail from segregationists in the area. Approximately 25‚Äì30 students at ASC were African Americans in fall 1962, out of a student body of over 9,000. One of those first African American students was Jesse Oliver, who had been denied admission on account of race just the previous spring. By the late 1960s, African American students accounted for about 1‚Äì2% of enrollment every year. Not all components of ASC were fully integrated in September 1962, however. Athletics teams were integrated in 1963 and dormitories were not integrated until 1965, at which point ASC was deemed \\"fully integrated\\". However, even after \\"full\\" integration of the college, only 14 of ASC's 61 academic clubs, social clubs, fraternities, and other organizations had been integrated. Similarly, ASC did not prioritize hiring African American faculty or administrators during the mid-1960s. Unlike at some other Southern schools, such as the University of Mississippi, integration at ASC occurred peacefully. In August 1965, Oscar K. Chambers became ASC's first African American ROTC graduate. = Move to the University of Texas System = Students at Arlington State College during the Texas A&M; controversy, 1965 The major underlying factors in ASC's growing disillusionment with the Texas A&M; University System were ASC supporters' belief that the college's interests were subjugated to those of A&M; in College Station, the A&M; administrative style was too rigid and provided too few opportunities for faculty engagement and influence, and A&M;'s lack of adequate investment into ASC while it was growing quickly. In particular, A&M;'s lack of support for a graduate program at ASC and its unwillingness to construct new buildings on the campus in Arlington were among the largest points of contention. In December 1964, these long-standing tensions between ASC and the Texas A&M; board of directors reached a fever pitch, as many supporters of the Arlington college believed that their interests were being neglected when A&M; proposed a reorganization of its system inspired by the University of California System. A proposal made by four members of the A&M; board of directors would have renamed ASC \\"Texas A&M; University at Arlington\\", more closely integrated it into the A&M; system, created master's programs in eleven fields (including seven in engineering) that would be directed by the College Station graduate school dean, and shared A&M; facilities and faculty with the graduate programs at ASC. In the words of Saxon, A&M; administrators and board of directors members \\"were unprepared‚Äìand totally surprised‚Äìat the firestorm of protests and hostility these proposals generated\\". The proposed name change alone provoked furor from members of the community, including the Arlington Citizen-Journal and state representative Howard Green. President Woolf observed that the A&M; board did not ask for feedback or input from ASC administrators on the proposal, Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce member Marvin C. Nichols deemed it a public relations failure, and the reaction of the ASC community and Arlington residents was largely negative. The ASC student government passed a resolution against the A&M; system proposal and formed a \\"Save Our School Committee\\" to oppose it. The Ex- Students Association similarly organized a campaign to encourage alumni to contact A&M; board members and legislators to voice their opposition to the proposal. At an emergency meeting of the Dallas and Fort Worth chambers of commerce on December 22, 1964, the majority of those in attendance supported remaining in the A&M; system if College Station committed to developing ASC into a doctoral university. Of those in attendance, only Vandergriff was clearly in favor of separation, although the chamber members floated the idea of forming a regional university system with North Texas State University and Texas Woman's University (both located in Denton) if ASC did separate from A&M.; Texas A&M; president James Earl Rudder himself became a key factor, as his disapproval of ASC gaining four-year college status, his unhappiness with spending system money on building construction at ASC, and his insistence that ASC's name would be changed regardless of what its supporters thought alienated many ASC administrators, faculty, students, and alumni. In 1994, Vandergriff recalled Rudder telling him, \\"You were one of the best junior colleges anywhere. You can never be anything but a run of the mill senior college.\\" On January 6, 1965, Rudder met with key ASC officials and student government officers as well as Vandergriff, Tarrant County state senator Don Kennard, and members of the Dallas and Fort Worth chambers of commerce in an attempt to alleviate their fears. However, Rudder failed to commit to resolve any of ASC's three biggest concerns: how quickly it could offer graduate programs, its need for additional funds for building construction, and its role and level of autonomy in a restructured A&M; system. Rudder did promise that neither he nor the A&M; board would prevent ASC from leaving the system if it desired. This meeting served to polarize the increasingly divided two factions on the ASC campus. The first favored remaining in a modified A&M; system, which was supported by President Woolf, the deans at ASC, and many Dallas Chamber of Commerce members. The second preferred to leave the system entirely, which was supported by most of the students, alumni, and faculty as well as Vandergriff, the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, and state legislators representing the region. Shortly after the meeting with Rudder, a group of key ASC supporters (including Vandergriff and Kennard) met with Texas governor John Connally to lobby for his support of ASC leaving the A&M; system. After learning that Rudder did not oppose such a move, Connally agreed to assist ASC. A few weeks later, he unveiled a major plan for reorganizing all 22 public colleges and universities in the state into three \\"super systems\\". This plan proposed placing ASC into the University of Texas System with North Texas State, the University of Houston, and Texas Western University (in El Paso). Buoyed by Connally's proposed reorganization, Kennard assembled and managed a \\"wrecking crew\\" of ASC faculty members who met in secret to strategize how to separate ASC from the A&M; system. Ultimately, they created a position paper that Kennard would use to lobby state legislators to support ASC's goal of separation. Senate Bill 401 met with little opposition in either the Texas House of Representatives or Senate, and it was signed into law by Connally on April 23. It ended ASC's 48 years of affiliation with Texas A&M;, for which President Woolf expressed gratitude. ASC and Woolf were warmly welcomed to the UT System by chancellor Harry Ransom and UT Board of Regents chairman William Womack Heath, who celebrated by hosting a luncheon at the Commodore Perry Hotel in Austin. Upon hearing the news in Arlington, ASC students spontaneously celebrated by firing the school cannon and listening to speeches commemorating the occasion. In recognition of his contributions to the school, what would become the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) ultimately named Vandergriff Hall at College Park after Mayor Vandergriff. In the immediate aftermath of the marriage between ASC and the UT System, the system held a board meeting on the ASC campus as a gesture of good will, emphasized that the Arlington school would be an equal of the other five UT System institutions and not a branch campus, and committed to supporting ASC's growth and development. All of this contributed positively to the outlook of both students and faculty at ASC. On the eve of the signing of Senate Bill 401, President Woolf commented, \\"Arlington State College now becomes associated with a great university.\\" In the assessment of Saxon, \\"the break between A&M; and ASC was over money and status\\". The split between the two was ultimately satisfactory to both sides, underscored by an editorial in The Shorthorn that opined that it was \\"probably the first divorce in history where everybody concerned lived happily ever after\\". = Student life = Miss Dixie Belle candidates, 1962 Student life evolved rapidly during the ASC era. However, social and political issues were not a major part of the campus culture at the time. During the ASC era, the college encouraged the creation of student clubs and societies based on interest as well as professional and social organizations, which grew rapidly in number between the late 1950s and mid-1960s. In 1954, ASC made its cadet corps optional instead of mandatory for the first time in its history. The Shorthorn continued to serve as the student newspaper on campus while the Arlington Review was created in 1962 as a literary magazine publishing the works of students. In 1961, ASC created the Student Activities Program, which organized activities, dances, guest speaker appearances, and the screening of films at the Hereford Student Center. In fall 1965, its events were attended by over 5,000 people at a time when just 970 students lived in dormitories on campus. Featured performers included jazz musician Lionel Hampton, classical guitarist Andr√©s Segovia, and the Vienna Boys' Choir. Among the most popular student events on campus during the mid-1960s were dances, Western Day, and the Winter Olympics, which featured oddball events such as tricycle-pulled chariot races and pogo-stick jumping. Student government became more prominent and effective during the ASC era. In the 1950s, ASC had a 20-member Student Council whose members were all appointed by the college president. In 1962, the Student Council was enlarged to 30 members, 16 of whom were elected by ASC students and the remaining 14 of whom were appointed by the president. The Student Council's main aims were to improve services to students, facilitate better overall communications on campus, make the college's grounds safer and more aesthetically pleasing, and discuss issues of concern to the student body. = Athletics = ASC cheerleaders, circa 1964 After construction began during the NTAC era in 1946, in September 1951 ASC opened its new $60,000, all-steel War Memorial Stadium. It was dedicated to the 207 NTAC students who were killed in World War II. In 1956 and 1957, the ASC Rebels football team won back-to-back Junior Rose Bowls, which brought the college national recognition for the first time. In 1956, the football team finished the regular season 8‚Äì1‚Äì1 and as Pioneer Conference co-champions under the direction of head coach Chena Gilstrap. They were invited to play in the Junior Rose Bowl in front of 35,000 spectators against California's Compton College, entering the game as a substantial underdog. Behind the performance of running back Calvin Lee, ASC won the game 20‚Äì13. In 1957, ASC returned to the Junior Rose Bowl with an undefeated record and as the heavy favorite against California's Cerritos Junior College, which had only existed for a year. ASC won 21‚Äì12 with a team that consisted of eight All-Americans. In the estimation of Saxon, the 1957 ASC football team was \\"perhaps the best football squad in the school's history\\". Collectively outscoring its opponents 425‚Äì62 and winning four games with shutouts, it was the first team in school history to finish with a perfect season. The back-to- back Junior Rose Bowl victories would be the greatest accomplishments of the ASC football program. After it became a four-year college in 1959, ASC was competing against stronger opponents. In 1963, the college began integrating its athletics teams with African American players for the first time while also joining the newly formed Southland Conference. Although not emphasized by college presidents, the football program was heavily subsidized, as were other athletics programs at ASC. Fan support at football games was considerable through the end of the 1960s, with capacity crowds of 10,000 being common until the on-campus stadium was demolished and home games were moved to Turnpike Stadium. During the ASC era, the college's men's basketball team achieved only moderate success, competing in zone playoffs and post-season tournaments in both the Pioneer Conference and the Southland Conference but struggling to win the competitions. ASC also competed in intercollegiate men's golf, tennis, and track during this period. However, the college still did not have any women's intercollegiate team sports through the mid- to late 1960s. ASC also created a men's swimming program under head coach Don Easterling during the mid-1960s. Most notable among its athletes were Doug Russell, a collegiate national champion who would go on to win a gold medal at the 1968 Summer Olympics, and Dashell Maines, who became the first woman to earn a varsity letter swimming on a men's collegiate team in Texas. Both a park and a street on the school's campus are named in honor of Russell. The mid-1960s additionally saw the creation of an intramural sports program at ASC, which included sports such as basketball, bowling, touch football, and tug of war.

Musical style Grimm Grimm's music has been described by Folk Radio UK as \\"Otherworldly forays into baroque folk, futurist lyricism and electroacoustic oddities\\" The Quietus described his 2020 album, Ginormous, as \\"Accented with percussion that comes in small clicks and creaks, metronomic rhythms, clacking, cranking sounds like wind-up gears, which sometimes stand in for more conventional drumming, or, as on 'Kyowa Amenohidesu', can create a halting, glitchy tempo.\\"Clash also gave his album \\"Hazy Eyes Maybe\\" an 8/10 describing it as \\"On the surface, 'Hazy Eyes Maybe' might seem a simple, acoustic album, but scrape beneath the surface and there lies intricately crafted layers of mournful, morphing, melancholic hooks\\".
