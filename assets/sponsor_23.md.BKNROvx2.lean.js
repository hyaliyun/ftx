It was located in the Loire Valley on the south bank of the River Loire, downstream from the town of Amboise and about southwest of the royal Ch√¢teau d'Amboise. From 1761 to 1785 Chanteloup belonged to King Louis XV's prime minister, the Duke of Choiseul. The ch√¢teau was mostly demolished in 1823, but some features of the park remain, notably the Pagoda of Chanteloup, a significant tourist attraction.Pagode de Chanteloup website. History =Origins= In the 16th century the site was nothing more than a tenanted farm, but it was elevated to a fief in January 1668. Fran√ßois le Franc, a fruit seller to the Duke of Alen√ßon (youngest son of Henry II of France and Catherine de M√©dicis), purchased it on 7 June 1583 and erected a house with a chapel. He became the mayor of Amboise in 1588. Claude-Arnoul Poncher, who acquired the property by his marriage to Marie-Madeleine le Franc (daughter of Fran√ßois le Franc, grandson of Fran√ßois le Franc, the fruit seller), sold it on 21 October 1695 to Louis le Boultz, the Grand Master of Waterworks and Forests of Touraine, Anjou and Maine.Carr√© de Busserolle 1879, p. 110; Andr√© 1928, pp. 21‚Äì22; Chenu & Stainier 2014, p. 2. Around 1700 Louis le Boultz created large, well-ordered gardens and added other structures, so that it was no longer a simple country house.Chenu & Stainier 2014, p. 2.

D'Aubigny was the secretary for the Princesse des Ursins from 1701 to 1714, a period when she was very influential at the court of Philip V of Spain, the grandson of Louis XIV. D'Aubigny hired the well-known French architect Robert de Cotte in 1711 to remodel the house into a ch√¢teau. Robert de Cotte also worked on the Princess's apartments at the Royal Palace in Madrid and on designs for the Spanish king's country estate on the outskirts of Madrid, the Buen Retiro. The Ch√¢teau de Chanteloup was probably intended for her future use, but she was never to see it. At her death in 1722, as her sole heir, d'Aubigny retained sole possession of the ch√¢teau and its park.Chenu & Stainier 2014, p. 2; \\"Chanteloup History\\", Chanteloup website; Neuman 1994, p. 229 note 4; Gallet 1995, p. 289‚Äì290. D'Aubigny's focus in 1711, when construction began, was on Spain and the south. Robert de Cotte modified the central part, the corps de logis and the two pavilions at its ends (most of which already existed), and added the lateral wings flanking the cour d'honneur, a design typical of a ch√¢teau, so that the ensemble faced south. The principal entrance to the forecourt leading to the ch√¢teau was on the south side, on the road to Spain.Andr√© 1935, pp. 24‚Äì26. There was a passageway from the cour d'honneur through the west wing to the service court (basse cour) and stables on the west.Plan of the premier √©tage of the Ch√¢teau de Chanteloup. Biblioth√®que de l'Institut de France, Paris. Digital copy from the website of the Agence Photo de la RMN. The remodeling included the creation of an east-facing gallery in the east wing and a chapel in the northwest corner, both with a project of decoration entrusted to Henri de Favanne, d'Aubigny's favorite painter, who had already worked on d'Aubigny's Parisian h√¥tel.Moreau 2008, p. 1.

The park was divided into numerous geometrically arranged groves of tall trees (bosquets), bordered by alleys lined with a variety of species of trees, and decorated with ornamental ponds. It was enclosed on the east, west, and south by a wall and on the north by a moat, and encompassed an area of about 500 arpents ().Andr√© 1935, p. 26; Moreau 2008, p. 3.

A 1761 general site plan, from the French National Archives in Paris, shows that one of the first changes Choiseul made was to cut numerous tree-lined avenues and alleys in complex geometric patterns in the newly acquired Forest of Amboise to the south of the ch√¢teau, creating a Grand Park. Seven of the avenues converge on the half-moon (demi-lune) parterre of the Spanish Gate, forming a classic French patte d'oie (goose-foot pattern), a feature seen at several grand French ch√¢teaux of the 17th century, including the Ch√¢teau de Richelieu, Vaux- le-Vicomte, and Versailles.MBA Tours 2007, p. 9; Moreau 2008, pp. 3‚Äì4; Watson 1966, p. 157. Master plan Choiseul engaged the architect Louis-Denis Le Camus to modernize and enlarge the ch√¢teau.Gallet 1995, p. 290. A master plan (grand dessein) was developed which was never to be completely realized.Grateau 2015, p. 84.

For example, this plan shows a theatre wing running east from the southern end of the east lateral wing, which is not seen in numerous later representations of the ch√¢teau. Other features, which were realized in one form or another, included additional courtyards, stables, and service buildings to the west of the ch√¢teau. Six miniature paintings by Louis-Nicolas van Blarenberghe dated 1767, which decorate a gold snuffbox, show the architectural composition as intended by Choiseul and his architect, such as the theatre wing, rather than that which had actually been built.

Each was topped with a promenade enclosed with balustrades decorated with ornamental vases and terminated with rectangular pavilions, the one on the east with a Salle des Bains (Bath Hall), and the one on the west with a chapel. Each of the matching pavilions was raised by one storey and covered with a terrace with a balustrade.Andr√© 1935, pp. 28‚Äì29; Watson 1966, p. 156; Grateau 2015, p. 84.

The great entrance grille, the Grille Dor√©e (Golden Grille), was 12 toise (about 24 yards) in length and was flanked by two guard pavilions, which still exist. The gate was surmounted by the Choiseul arms. Although the Choiseul arms have been lost, the gate itself is now found at the prefecture of Indre-et-Loire in Tours. The forecourt contained a sunken central parterre, surrounded by a retaining wall (ha-ha), and in its center, an ornamental basin (pi√®ce d'eau) with two water-jet fountains (jets d'eau). The carriage drive forked, passing to either side of the parterre and crossing two parallel bridges over the moat into the entrance court, which had a long central parterre with broderie of cut grass and low bands of flowers and a circular central ornamental basin with a single jet d'eau.Andr√© 1935, pp. 28‚Äì29, 32‚Äì33; Moreau 2008, p. 5; Watson 1966, p. 156.

The demi-lune parterre itself was transformed into a lake.Grateau 2015, pp. 84, 86; Watson 1966, p. 157.

The canal is shown on a 1770 site plan attributed to Le Camus and is depicted in paintings by Louis-Nicolas Van Blarenberghe and Nicolas Perignon.Andr√© 1935, after p. 28; Watson 1966, p. 157, plate 750; Grateau 2015, pp. 82, 89 (Van Blarenberghe), 96 (Perignon).

Le Camus used them again to fill in the setback of one toise (about two yards) of the south facade of the corps de logis (facing the cour d'honneur) with a seven-bay colonnaded portico, including a central avant-corps of three bays with a wider set of steps (perron) leading down to the courtyard.Andr√© 1935, pp. 28‚Äì29; Watson 1966, p. 156. The portico can be seen in a view of the south facade of the ch√¢teau taken from the middle of the cascade, painted around 1770 by Nicolas Perignon.Grateau 2015, pp. 96‚Äì97. In the center of the corps de logis, Le Camus created a large entrance hall, through which one could pass to reach the courtyard on the south, the cour d'honneur. To the left of the entrance hall was a series of three large rooms, and to its right a large dining room with windows facing north, rather than the cour d'honneur as before.Andr√© 1935, pp. 28‚Äì29.

The one attached to the east wing contained a complete apartment, comprising an entrance foyer, antechamber, grand chamber (with windows facing east), and on the south, a boudoir, office (cabinet), closet (garde-robe), and a staircase leading to the floor above. This apartment was used by Choiseul's sister, the Duchess of Gramont, when she came to visit. The old part of the east wing contained the apartment for the duke, a large gallery, and the apartment for the duchess, Louise-Honorine Crozat, daughter of Louis-Fran√ßois Crozat, marquis du Ch√¢tel, and heir to many of the Italian paintings from the collection of her great-uncle, Pierre Crozat. Some of these paintings were displayed in the gallery. The matching pavilion attached to the west wing contained the apartment of the officier de bouche (chef), an office and a laundry. The old part of the west wing contained a new kitchen (closer to the main dining room), offices, and the servants' dining room.Andr√© 1935, pp. 28‚Äì29; Watson 1966, p. 156 (Italian paintings).

Jardin anglo-chinois and pagoda In December 1770, Louis XV banished Choiseul from court and ordered him to retire to Chanteloup. Before returning to Paris in 1775, after the lifting of his exile by Louis XVI, Choiseul introduced a large, informal jardin anglo-chinois (replacing the French formal gardens east of the main axis of the ch√¢teau) and commissioned the construction of what is now the former ch√¢teau's most famous feature, the seven-storey, -tall Pagoda of Chanteloup, built in 1775 by Le Camus.Watson 1935, p. 157; MBA Tour 2007, p. 4. The pagoda was located just to the north of the demi-lune lake. The garden cascade flowing down to the pi√®ce d'eau near the cour d'honneur was suppressed at this time and transformed into a bowling green (boulingrin), apparently due to a lack of sufficient water to keep it flowing.Moreau 2008, p. 9.

The French Revolution began a period of decline, the property becoming a public good in 1797 and sufferering abandonment until 1802, when it was bought by the chemist-industrialist Jean-Antoine Chaptal.MBA Tours 2007, p. 2; Crosland 2008. Chaptal, a rich man, was minister of the interior under Napoleon and became a member of the French Senate in 1804. He expended a considerable amount of money restoring the property and in 1808 declared \\"it was fit to receive a king.\\"Crosland 2008. He raised sheep, distilled brandy, and experimented with beet farming and the large-scale production of beet sugar.MBA Tours 2007, p. 4; Crosland 2008. In order to pay heavy debts owed by his son from investments in the chemical industry,Crosland 2008. Chaptal decided to sell. The Duke of Orl√©ans purchased the section of the park with the Pagoda, but declined to buy the entire domain. In 1823 Chaptal sold the remainder of the park and gardens and the ch√¢teau itself to a consortium of goods merchants, the \\"bande noire\\" (\\"black bandits\\"), including the socialist banker Barth√©lemy Prosper Enfantin and the speculator Baudrand, acting for the wealthy .

She is currently a full professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo, and has previously taught throughout the USA and in Chile. Her research primarily focuses on the shamans or machis of the Mapuche community of Chile, and the ways shamanic practices and beliefs are affected by and influence communal experiences of state power, mythical history, ethics, gender, justice, identity, and much more.  Education & Career  Ana Mariella Bacigalupo prior to her position at SUNY Buffalo had obtained her PhD from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) for Anthropology. For over 20 years, her experiences and observations on the Mapuche communities has become her main focus of study, observing their lifestyles from the perspective and guidance of her 'spiritual grandmother,' Francisca Kolipi, a Mapuche Shaman. Her major works regarding the Mapuche have been published since 1996 with the most notable being Shamans of the Foye Tree: Gender, Power and Healing Among Chilean Mapuche and Thunder Shaman: Making History With Mapuche Spirits in Chile and Patagonia, both published respectively in 2007 and 2017.  Work about Mapuche shamanism  = Thunder Shaman: Making History With Mapuche Spirits In Chile And Patagonia = This work completed in 2016 by Baciagalupo details the experience she had living with and studying the Mapuche people under the guidance of Francisca Kolipi. The primary objective of this book is to demonstrate the resiliency the Mapuche communities and machi had against the multiple forces of colonialism and dictatorships via the fluidity and spiritual guidance of the sages. By connecting themselves to the forces of nature around them, as shown by the machi, the Mapuche have been able to both preserve their ways of life and to empower both male and female members, with the guidance of women often being the predominant factor whilst placing emphasis on the concepts of mobility in both the spiritual and physical worlds. Bacigalupo primarily attempts to show how their worldview and interactions with nature and environment helped to both sustain and refine the resiliency of the Mapuche via the gender fluidity and spiritual experiences seen within Chile. Mapuche machis = Shamans of the Foye Tree: Gender, Power, And Healing Among Chilean Mapuche = Bacigalupo has written a book called Shamans of the Foye Tree, where she focuses on the shamans and discusses the importance of the foye tree and specifically discusses about gender. Mapuche shamans or machi are greatly influenced by sacred trees called foye trees. Foye trees are a ‚Äúsymbol of office for both male and female machi and the place where the machi‚Äôs spirit resides‚Äù. So machis could be seen as a community of people who simply don‚Äôt only communicate with humans but also want to be able to communicate with other aspects of the universe. They are able to communicate with the different aspects (spiritual, natural and human) of the universe by means of the foye trees. Foye trees also emphasize that machi rituals are co-gendered because the flowers are specifically hermaphroditic. Hence Mapuche Shamans have no gender restrictions in order to engage in the rituals. Most of the machi's are female because women usually tend to provide fertility to the land which helps promote agriculture and ultimately helps the community survive. So women could be seen as important people within the machi community because they are the ones who keep track of resources for the sake of everyone's well being.  Other research  In addition to her extensive work with Mapuche shamans, Bacigalupo's research has also extended to three other areas: #Developments in Mapuche spirituality, the telling of history, and political activity in connection with historical and ongoing Chilean state violence against the community: #*A crucial feature of this development has surrounded disembodied beings known, among other names, as \\"los no-finados (the unfinished or undead ones)\\", which are Mapuche individuals killed by the state who remain in this world to inflict pain (e.g. disease, blindness, death) on the living - Mapuche and non-Mapuche alike. According to Bacigalupo, these undead, besides creating various taboos and restrictions on everyday life, play two important purposes in contemporary Mapuche society. Firstly, they are conceived of as moral agents who enact retributive justice against the immoral (within and outside of the community), thus demanding action of the community against injustices within and against their community in order to rectify the moral order. Second, their infliction of suffering serves as a reminder of the continuum of historical violence perpetrated by the Chilean state from the nineteenth- century wars to annex Mapuche territory, through the especially violent period of the Pinochet dictatorship, to the present day and into the future, thus uniting Mapuche of the past, present, and future as one community. # Climate change's transformation of social values, politics, and activism, particularly in regards to the emerging ethics and politics of vulnerable and poor Peruvian mestizos that stress the significance of the environment for human communities and nature's moral agency # Law, morality, and human rights in the context of \\"shamanic notions of justice\\" and Chilean Catholic and LGBT families  Awards, accolades, & grants  Bacigalupo has earned several fellowships: * John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship * Radcliffe Institute Fellowship * School of Advanced Research fellowship * National Humanities Center fellowship Bacigalupo has also earned a few awards: * Outstanding Young Investigator Award * UB 2020 award for Excellence in Cultural, Historical and Literary/Textual Studies * Milton Plesur Teaching Award from the University at Buffalo (2007)  Bibliography  Among the works which Bacigalupo has written and to which she has contributed can be found the following: = Books = * 1995 (with Armando Marileo, Ricardo Salas, Ram√≥n Curivil, Cristi√°n Parker, Alejandro Saavedra): Modernizaci√≥n o sabiduria en tierra Mapuche?

Jennings (born February 10, 1963) is an American Oneness Pentecostal pastor who is best known as being the founder and current general overseer of the First Church of our Lord Jesus Christ (FCOOLJC) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Church originally started out as a fellowship of branch churches, organized by Jennings in 1984. Today, the church organization can be found in several locations in over 20 states across the continental United States, and around the world, with a radio and television broadcasting station in Philadelphia, called The Truth of God Broadcasting Network, and boasts of nearly 200 congregations across the Caribbean, and the continents of Africa, Asia, and Europe as well.  Biography  Jennings was born the fourth of eight siblings on February 10, 1963. Both his parents were ministerial clergy leaders at his father's uncle's church in Philadelphia. His father known as Ernest Jennings was a bishop and at the age of thirteen, after preaching his first sermon from Hebrews 11:6, the younger Gino was appointed an assistant pastor of the church in 1975. As a teenager, after claiming the baptism of the Holy Ghost, he began preaching regularly under the tutelage of his father and great-uncle, and also began evangelizing at revivals and crusades at other churches around the city of Philadelphia with his parents. In 1976-1978 when he was around the age of 15 he began preaching controversial sermons against the by-laws and doctrines of his great-uncle's teaching, much to his great- uncle's anger and dismay. After graduating from high school in 1981, he began preaching against his great-uncle's stances on Christian sanctification, holiness, and modesty in behavior, and clothing. Saying that the church and those in church leadership need to have stricter and more scripture based standards for such concepts. He also began preaching Nontrinitarian views, stating that he believed the Trinity perspective of God was false, and began preaching a distinct, Non-Trinitarian form of Modalistic Monarchianism. He also began preaching against and criticizing the stances and viewpoints that many people were starting to take within the church at the time. His great- uncle then temporarily suspended him of his ministerial duties, and made him take a one-year sabbatical leave of absence from preaching in the church. When he was finally given the opportunity to preach again, he told his great-uncle that he refused to back down from any of his viewpoints and teachings. Finally in 1984, at the age of 21, after going through repetitive cycles of being suspended from his ministerial duties and being forced to take sabbaticals from preaching, Jennings, his parents and his siblings left their great- uncle's church. He started the First Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ. (FCOOLJC) on May 21, 1984 in the basement of his family home, starting out with only 15 members, (family not included). Many of his teenage and young adult friends from high school and college, and their families also joined the church in 1984 as well. Between 1984 and 1988, several of the former members of his great-uncle's church began joining, and the congregation steadily grew. As time passed, several rooms of the basement and other areas of the house had to be used as overflow rooms. Between 1986 and 1988, many members of his great-uncle's church began to antagonize First Church and taunt Jennings; calling him a false teacher, saying that he was putting too much of a strict emphasis on legalism. Several church and ministry auxiliaries were formed around this time as well, allowing Jennings to rent out auditoriums of public facilities around Philadelphia to use for First Church worship services and meetings. Between 1988 and 1989, Jennings began planting branch churches in other cities in Pennsylvania, and in other states such as Illinois, Michigan, Tennessee, Maryland, New York, and Virginia. The Services at the headquarters church in Philadelphia were moved to the auditorium of the former Hunting Park Recreation Center. In April 1989, First Church began having its services in the fellowship hall of an old Episcopalian Church building. Because the fellowship hall of the church was very large, the location provided enough room to accommodate the growing congregation. As the Philadelphia congregation exponentially grew, it was also at this time that Jennings fell in love with Darlene Gayman, a fellow member of the church whom he had been courting with. The two were married on April 15, 1989 when Jennings was 27. And to not take away from the focus of the ministry he also conducted a revival service after the wedding for the wedding guests as well. By March 1990, Jennings and First Church had also set up their own local radio broadcasting equipment within their church and began broadcasting audio tapes and live recordings of their services on local Philadelphia radio stations. First Church was also given a thirty-minute international broadcast on WWCR Nashville, and a one-hour broadcast on WTMR Camden, New Jersey. Jennings then named the broadcasts, \\"The Truth of God\\" claiming that that was the name God gave him to give as a title to the radio broadcast, to help them reach souls and inspire interest in any Christians willing to tune in and listen. By 1991, over 11 radio stations across several states and even international radio stations in other countries in the Caribbean, Africa, and Europe were broadcasting Jennings' sermons to international listeners. Many people of other denominations and churches have criticized Jennings and the FCOOLJC for some of their stricter beliefs and views, such as the rejection of women in church clergy based on 1st Timothy 2:12, whereby specifically which many Christians have accused them of being \\"religiously misogynistic\\", and speaking in tongues (glossolalia) as a required sign of evidence of being baptized with the Holy Spirit. They also present a staunch advocacy for Nontrinitarianism, water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, or Lord Jesus only, requiring women to wear headcoverings and only long skirts or long dresses and rejection of the wearing of jewelry and makeup. Jennings also rejects the usage of the name \\"Christianity\\" for he believes that \\"Christianity\\" is a corrupted and tainted term. Instead the word that he believes more accurately describes the faith of the Saints, should be the term \\"Holiness,\\" or the \\"religion of Holiness.\\" On April 12, 1991, Jennings' father, Bishop Ernest Jennings died. The First Church Headquarters in Philadelphia hosted his funeral, and hundreds of people from all around the country came to pay their respects. Gino preached a very charismatic eulogy for his father which was heard on the radio and television across the country through the Truth of God broadcast. In November 1991, Jennings and First Church purchased an 18,000 square foot church building in the Kensington section of Philadelphia on 2431 Frankford Avenue. In February 1992, just after his 30th Birthday, the new headquarters was completed and dedicated. As time passed the ministries grew and flourished, and as of June 25, 2016, Jennings made settlement on a 200,000 square foot church facility on 5105 North 5th Street in the Olney section of Philadelphia, PA. The purchase was made after the building had been pursued by the church since 2014. The facility covers a whole city block and was previously owned by the Catholic Church. It also consists of two schools, a cafeteria, an administration building, and an old convent building that was converted into lodging quarters for members that could not afford anywhere to stay during large events held at the church. The main sanctuary can fit approximately 2,300 people and the lower autitorium can fit about 1,200. This building serves as the churches headquarters to this day. Throughout 1992 to 2016, Jennings also began going to other states around the country including Florida, California, Texas, Washington, Missouri, Colorado, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina, establishing branch churches and planting pastors in each state, further incorporating the ministries into its own stand-alone, independent church denomination. Today, the church can be found in over 20 states across the continental United States. Jennings is also continuing to work abroad establishing branch churches in Puerto Rico (which although it is a U.S. Territory, it is still considered foreign missions), England, Nigeria, the Philippines, Jamaica, Haiti, and New Zealand, and many more places around the world. His churches have also been dedicated to philanthropy and community services efforts. Between February and March 2018, Jennings entered the media spotlight for his controversial sermons against women wearing excessive makeup, fake hair, wigs, and jewelry in church ; comparing women who do such things to Jezebel and Delilah. Reverend Carla Dunbar called his comments erronous and degrading. Jennings defended his statements by saying not to listen to how he sounded, but to what he said in defense of the teachings of Biblical modesty in dress and clothing. Jennings agreed to meet with Jamaican entertainer \\"Mr. Vegas\\" to debate him. However he had Vegas escorted out of the building by security after an altercation that ensued between Vegas, the church's audio and visual team, and the other associate ministers on the pulpit. This later led to the debate going viral throughout Jamaica, and two other ministers that agreed to debate him canceled.

It is currently a department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MAI) and exercises its powers and policy in the accordance with the ministry. It was originally founded as the Border Guard Troops, and later the Border Guard Service of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Moldova. It would remain a military branch until a 2012 government reform, putting it under the control of the MAI. The Day of the Border Police is celebrated annually on 10 June. History Following the fall of the Soviet Union, the newly elected first President of Moldova, Mircea Snegur founded the border police on September 3, 1991. The administration of the border troops was entrusted to the Ministry of National Security of Moldova under the subordination of the entire subunit of the former Soviet Border Troops deployed on Moldovan territory. On January 11, 1992, Colonel Vasile Calmoi was appointed as the first commander of the boarder troops. In accordance with a government decree which was signed on June 15, 1992, the Moldovan Border Troops became an official separate branch of the armed forces, with the law \\"On the State Border of the Republic of Moldova\\", coming into force by November 1994. Border guards day was first celebrated in Moldova on May 27, 1995 as the professional holiday of the Border Guard Troops of Moldova, before later being celebrated annually on June 10, which marks the day that President Snegur handed the flag of the border troops to promoted Brigader General Calmoi. In December 1999, the Moldovan Border Guard was reorganized into the Department of the Border Guard Troops of the Republic of Moldova and was withdrawn from the Ministry of National Security a month and a half later. On December 1, 2005 the European Union Border Assistance Mission to the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine (EUBAM) was launched and on July 13, 2006, the EUBAM Territorial Office in Moldova and Ukraine was opened by the Border Guard Service. On January 10, 2007, the border service established the National Border Police College in Chisinau. On July 1, 2012, the Prime Minister Vlad Filat signed a law, which would shift the border service from the armed forces to the internal affairs ministry.http://www.border.gov.md/index.php/ro/politia-de- frontiera/istoriahttp://lex.justice.md/index.php?action=view&view;=doc‚ü®=1&id;=306988 Responsibilities In the field of border management, the border police's main purpose is to fight against illegal migration and cross-border crime. In order to fulfill these tasks, the border police finds and examines the contraventions, undertakes the judicial expertise of the documents, performs special investigative measures. The border police performs these duties within the boundaries of the Moldovan borders with Ukraine, and Romania. The basic principles of which the border police follows include: legality, impartiality, respect for human rights, transparency, personal responsibility, and professionalism. The MAI exercises control and coordinates the activity of the border police as well as elaborates and promotes the state policy of the service.

Situated within the Glacier Peak Wilderness, Mount Chaval is positioned west of the crest of the North Cascades Range, approximately 15 miles northeast of the town of Darrington. It has two subsidiary peaks, East Peak and Middle Peak, each 7040 ft. Its nearest higher peak is Snowking Mountain, to the northeast. Precipitation runoff from Mount Chaval drains into tributaries of the Skagit River. Mount Chaval seen from Darrington Climate Mount Chaval is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Mt. Chaval from the southeast Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. The rock of Mount Chaval is Chaval pluton, a pyroxene- bearing diorite and tonalite.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

It was built from 1879 to 1881. It is also known as Fowlers House. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Cranbrook was built in 1881 by Robert Fowler. Fowler, who had inherited a successful pottery business upon the death of his father Enoch Fowler in 1879, was a prominent businessman and variously mayor of the Municipality of Cook, Municipality of Camperdown and City of Sydney, a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1894 to 1895, and an appointed member of the New South Wales Legislative Council thereafter. Cranbrook featured gardens, ferneries and an orchard, the site of which is now the Camperdown Oval. A bathroom was added in the 1890s. Robert's brother, John, built the house next door at No. 10. It may have also served as a servants' or managers' house (occupied by manager Robert Tratham), and was connected by a common carriageway and courtyard to the main house at No. 14. Robert Fowler died of cerebral thrombosis on 12 June 1906 at Cranbrook. His wife, Susannah, continued to live there after his death. In 1919 Cranbrook was sold to Charles Daintree. The garden of Cranbrook was purchased by the Department of Education and added to the Camperdown Public School. In 1924 a strip of land, on which the ballroom and the orchard stood, was resumed from the house, for the Electricity Meter Manufacturing Co Ltd. In 1981 the two houses No. 10 and 14 were owned by the Brown family and let to Ken Robson who sublet rooms. At this time Marrickville Council applied to the Heritage Council for a section 130 order to prevent harm or demolition to the buildings. This was enacted on 12 March 1982 and again on 10 August 1984. By 1982, the property had a new owner, Garry Nicholls. In 1985, he nominated the two houses (as the Cranbrook Group) for a Permanent Conservation Order with the intention of restoring the properties. A Permanent Conservation Order was made over the property on 19 July 1985.  Description  No 10 Australia Street No. 10 - A terrace style two bedroom house featuring round-headed door and window with arched mouldings on the lower floor and another panelled door and cast iron fence with French doors on the upper floor. Roof is iron tiled. Much of the detail of the terrace matches the grander house Cranbrook at No. 14. No 14 Australia Street (Cranbrook) No. 14 (Cranbrook) - A large two-storey Italianate villa of five bedrooms with boxroom and rear courtyards. Retains cast iron fence and verandahs, dentillated trim to the verandah, large stuccoed chimneys and exterior steps with marble hand-rails and sandstone balusters. Interior features marble fireplaces and etched and coloured glass, elaborately carved staircase.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries The Cranbrook Group is of State historic significance as part of the last portion of the once-extensive Fowler estate, which at one time covered most of Camperdown. It is associated with Enoch Fowler and was the home of Robert Fowler owner of Fowler Pottery and Lord Mayor of Sydney and Camperdown. The Fowler family were early pioneers of the pottery industry in NSW producing pipes, tiles, chimney pots and items for residential and industrial use. The group is of aesthetic significance as they retain most of their original Italianate features. Cranbrook was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

While the train was advertised as going to San Francisco, it actually went to Oakland. Passengers completed the trip by ferry from Oakland Pier to the San Francisco Ferry Building at the foot of Market Street in San Francisco.'Official Guide of the Railways,' May 1946, pp. 864-65 (Southern Pacific section) History The Pacific Limited first ran on 3 April 1913 as train numbers 19 and 20 carrying standard and tourist sleeping cars on a 68-hour trip between San Francisco and Chicago over the SP, the UP, and the MILW railroads. Trains ran over the CNW east of Omaha rather than the MILW under United States Railroad Administration (USRA) control from 2 June 1918 to 14 November 1920. Routing east of Omaha returned to the CNW as a result of Great Depression service reductions in September 1930. Pacific Limited train numbers were changed to 20 and 21 on 11 December 1932, to 10 and 21 on 1 April 1933, to 14 and 21 on 1 April 1935, and to 21 and 22 on 7 June 1942.

Saint Louis Express Upon expiration of USRA control on 14 November 1920, the Wabash Railroad initiated the Saint Louis Express as train numbers 21 and 22 carrying coaches with standard and tourist sleeping cars between St. Louis and the Overland Route over which UP and SP took those trains to and from San Francisco. Six years later the Saint Louis Express was consolidated with the Pacific Limited on the Overland Route.

It is an unofficial term that encompasses a number of significant social and political movements related to secularism and secularization, which have occurred within the last thirty years, and involved no violence or force. It has been described as a period where \\"the people led, and the politicians followed\\". Taoiseach Leo Varadkar spoke of the country's contemporary era using the term \\"Quiet Revolution\\" following Ireland's historic repeal vote of the country's constitutional ban on abortion in 2018. This particular event which repealed the Eighth Amendment was labelled the tipping point. Other instances of secularized agenda and practice among the Irish public, figures, and the government have accumulated in the country to reflect the contemporary era of attitudinal change. One of these instances was in 2011 when then-Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny's parliamentary condemnation speech of the Vatican's response to clerical child abuse allegations during the Commission of Investigation into the Catholic diocese of Cloyne. Kenny's words; \\"dysfunction, disconnection, elitism ‚Äì and narcissism ‚Äì dominate the culture of the Vatican to this day\\", were met with nation-wide support in public, political and clerical domains.  History  = The Roman Catholic Church = The laws governing the Republic of Ireland, as well as Ireland's socio- cultural principles, had until the late 20th century been heavily influenced and dictated by the Roman Catholic Church. Long before and throughout pre- modern and modern history, the majority of Irish citizens were devout Catholics. Roman Catholicism as a religion values particular archaic practices and has impacted on Ireland's society and culture. The Church had extreme control of Irish society, through forms including its prohibition of followers to read from a list of banned literature, and through its influence on the constitution. For example, within the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979, the Catholic Church commanded the rule that prescription was necessary in order for access to contraception, rather than allowing citizens the right and free ability to access such human services. Prior to prescription-based access, people did not possess the right to access contraception under law. Under \\"pro-life\\" conscious, the Catholic Church supported the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Act of 1983, which recognised the equal right to life of the pregnant woman and the unborn. The Irish Education Act of 1831 derives from the Catholic Church, which influenced the teachings and philosophies in the public education system in Ireland until the post-modern era. The church has effective influence on primary school education today. Historically, in relation to the constitution and the general population, the Church maintained strong religious influence and subsequent control in the general order and operation of the Republic of Ireland. In more recent times, both quantitative and qualitative data shows that the country and its people are becoming secularized and are promoting ideologies of progressive and liberal natures. In 1973, Fine Gael supported a proposal to remove the Roman Catholic Church's status of \\"special position\\" in the constitution so that Ireland would become a secular state, which the voters approved. = Secularization = During the 21st century, census data has revealed decreases in religious activity in the Republic of Ireland, most prominently in recent years. Christianity, dominated by the Roman Catholic Church remains the largest in Ireland, with 78.3% of citizens identifying as Catholic as of 2016. The next largest group are non- believers ‚Äì people who declare that they are not religious ‚Äì which accounts for 10% of the population as of 2016. In comparison to data collected in 2011, these figures show a clear positive trend in the decline of religious gravity in the country. The census data from only 5 years earlier reports 84% of the population identifying as Catholic and only 6% as not religious. As acknowledged by scholar Louise Fuller in her piece, Contemporary Catholicism in Ireland: a critical appraisal, 2010, many of those who currently identify as Catholic in Ireland do not consider the Church's message relevant to their everyday practice. The census statistics acknowledge the growing existence of other religious attitudes in Ireland. The data represents the accommodation of other religions and their expression of religious freedom, as well as ideologies separate from religion in the Republic of Ireland. Notable event  Street art during Irish abortion referendum (Photo taken in Dublin in June 2018) The term Quiet Revolution embodies within it socio-cultural and socio- political events, movements and revolutions which have occurred over the last few decades to date. The following are claimed to be aspects that make up the Quiet Revolution in the Republic of Ireland, oftentimes involving \\"an Irish solution to an Irish problem\\": =New Age movement= The postmodern New Age movement which developed in the 1970s symbolises Mind, Body, Spirit. It shows an eclectic change in the way many people associate with religion and spirituality. New Age spiritualities are forms of religiosity, yet they reflect both secularization and \\"post-secularization\\". These co-exist in Ireland, as increased separation of religion from public life and from social institutions reflects secularization, and new age religions that are developing reflect a post-secular era of modernity in Ireland. =Feminist movement= Feminism in Ireland has involved much advocating and success for women's rights in the Republic of Ireland. The 2018 overturn of the Eighth Amendment in order to legalize abortion is one of the largest outcomes of this movement, exemplifying the (mostly Catholic identifying) population's secularized and liberalized attitudes in contemporary Ireland. Other issues which have undergone changes in policy and law under the banner of feminism include employment, marriage and divorce, politics and reproductive rights. =Sexual revolution= The sexual revolution has seen the millennials of Ireland behave in a liberated, expressionist manner in relation to their sexual development. The Catholic custom of being married and bearing children in Ireland no longer occurs as stringently as it did. Men and women are becoming sexually active earlier than at any other period in history, they are more likely to be single, and the attitudes towards commercial sex, prostitution and porn have widely changed to be accepted. The laws limiting access to contraceptives and family planning services gradually reformed over the late 20th century and early 21st century to allow the public free admission to purchase them. The Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act of 1993 saw the provision of sales to the public, which is legislation today. Over 50% of votes for the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Act referendum of 1995 to remove the constitutional prohibition on divorce meant the right for divorce was signed into law in 1996, despite the Catholic Church's strong disinclination towards the amendment. =LGBT rights= In 1993 homosexual acts was decriminalized in Ireland. In 2015, LGBT rights activism brought about an amendment to the Constitution of Ireland in terms of marriage laws. The Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Act 2015 meant that the prohibition of same-sex marriage was abolished and marriage between two persons without distinction as to their sex was permitted. =Blasphemy law= The publication or utterance of blasphemous matter was an offence specified by the Constitution of Ireland as an exception to general guarantee of the right of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions. In Corway v Independent Newspapers (1999), the Supreme Court held that the common law crime of blasphemous libel related to an established church and could not have survived the enactment of the Constitution. They also held that it was impossible to say what the offence of blasphemy consisted of. The matter came to public attention, in May 2017, when it was announced that English comedian Stephen Fry, along with broadcaster RT√â, were under criminal investigation for blasphemy under the Act, following a complaint from a member of the public about comments made by Fry in a 2015 broadcast interviewed with veteran Irish broadcaster Gay Byrne. The case was dropped after Garda√≠ confirmed that they had not been able to locate a sufficient number of offended people. In June 2018, Minister for Justice and Equality Charles Flanagan announced that the government would hold a referendum to simply remove the reference to the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution. In October 2018, citizens voted overwhelmingly to repeal Ireland's blasphemy law, effecting the Thirty- seventh_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_Ireland. Notable figures = Leo Varadkar = Taoiseach Leo Varadkar coined the term \\"Quiet Revolution\\" in reference to Ireland's recent policies. He has been the leader of Fine Gael since 2017 and has campaigned for policies related to equality of opportunity. It is notable that Leo Varadkar is an openly gay leader in a Catholic nation that supports his leadership status. = Enda Kenny = Enda Kenny has played a prominent political role in Ireland since 1975. In 2011 when he was Taoiseach, Kenny publicly condemned the Catholic Church in matters related to clerical child abuse and the values which dominate the culture of the Vatican. As reported by the media, the content of the Cloyne Report and Kenny's reaction speech caused controversy and acrimony amongst Irish citizens. Kenny's reaction in the D√°il √âireann marks a significant point as part of \\"Ireland's journey away from being a mono-Catholic state into a 21st century European republic‚Äù. = Garret FitzGerald = Although largely unsuccessful, Garret FitzGerald is notable for being the first Taoiseach to advocate for a more liberal version of Irish society and create what he called the non- sectarian nation of \\"Tone and Davis\\". His attempt to introduce divorce was defeated in a referendum, although he did liberalise Ireland's contraception laws. The controversial Anti-abortion amendment, which was stated to recognise the 'Right to Life of the Unborn, with due regard to the Equal Right to Life of the Mother' was added to the Irish constitution, against FitzGerald's advice, in a national referendum. Although begun by the previous Fianna F√°il administration, FitzGerald later said his decision to carry on with the referendum and resulting change to the constitution was one of his greatest regrets.  Reactions  Ireland's progressive changes in policy proclaimed by the Taoiseach under the banner of \\"Quiet Revolution\\" have caused upheaval amongst groups who have been actively contesting amendments of the constitution in Ireland for decades. Specifically, the feminist movement says that the term \\"Quiet Revolution\\" gently brushes off women's \\"screaming, shouting and singing for abortion rights‚Äù in their campaigning over the last few decades. Members of the feminist movement claim that the revolution is not over, with new human rights movements starting including the cervical cancer scandal, the treatment of sexual abuse victims, clerical child abuse (which is addressed openly in then-Taoiseach Enda Kenny's condemnatory speech regarding the Cloyne Report, 2011) and the homelessness crisis. In relation to abortion in Ireland, the Catholic Church continues to stand by its pro-life attitude, yet archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, is one of few clergymen who acknowledge that the Church must negotiate ways of existing in Ireland's newly secular society. The decline of institutional Church authority and observance reflects the decline of faith amongst the populace. Archbishop Martin suggests that the concept of pro-life should incorporate \\"Jesus's loving care for human life at any stage‚Äù or circumstance, including support for women who are in difficult or painful situations. In opposition to the idea of the Church renewing its commitment to supporting life is the backlash and outrage of the Catholic institution. He acknowledges that the stringency of this religious pro-life principle results in the Church losing their moral voice amongst the nation. The existence of both traditional theology and renewed ideology within the Catholic institution creates friction and inconsistencies, which ebbs church authority further and causes social policy to change. Following the 2018 abortion referendum in the Republic of Ireland, public campaigning has increased in Northern Ireland for complete rights to abortion. Secularized practices in the Republic are influencing the North to follow suit. According to 2011 Census data, 41.5% of the Northern Ireland population identifies as Protestant and 41% identifies as Roman Catholic. Despite reports of religious affiliation, these percentages do not represent the secular attitudes of the majority of citizens under 60 years old in Northern Ireland. Sinn F√©in advocates for \\"Europe-wide measures that promote and enhance human rights, equality and the all-Ireland agenda\\". One key social and cultural policy in their recent election campaign is to extend same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland. Although the party pledges support for minority rights, migrants' rights, and eradicating poverty, it is not in favor of extending legalized abortion to Northern Ireland. Only in certain cases, including incest, rape, sexual abuse, \\"fatal foetal abnormalities\\", or when risk or danger is threatening a woman's life, can abortion be permitted. Former Northern Ireland politician and 1998 Nobel Peace prize winner, John Hume, has said ‚Äúthe country [the land mass] is not divided; it‚Äôs the people who are divided...We must learn to spill our sweat together rather than spill our blood together‚Äù. Today, Protestants, Catholics and agnostics over the whole island - both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland - are calling for socio-cultural and socio-political change, despite Northern Ireland having a higher percentage of active and devout religious citizens.

No. 14 and the neighbouring building at No. 16 were jointly listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1939. History =Before the fire of 1728= Vestergade 14 was in 1388 part of a larger property owned by Herstedvester Church. The property was later divided into smaller lots, then merged and divided several times. Present dau No. 14 consisted of two lots when the entire area was destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1728. The (eastern) lot at the corner measured 6,25 metres towards Vestergade and 10 metres towards Larsbj√∏rnsstr√¶de. The western lot measured 7,50 metres towards Vestergade, 13.75 metres towards Larsbj√∏rnsstr√¶de and was 26 metres deep at its western boundary towards No. 16. =The eastern building, 1728-1795= The lot at the corner had since 1805 been owned by the surgeon Johann von Aspern. He was hit by a stroke during the fire and suffered from paralysis until his death in 1735. His step son, Christian Friedrich Reiser, who was also a surgeon, was hit by a psychiatric disorder during the fire and spent the rest of his life in constant fear of fire. He wrote a detailed but naive and unintentionally comical account of the fire which was published in 1784. Johann von Aspern's wife, Cathrine Adelgunde von Aspern, continued her husband's surgical business. It was later continued by Christian Friedrich Reiser until 1755. He then moved to Vestergade 10 where he died in 1785. The corner building was owned by a distiller named Jensen when it was destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. =The western building, 1728-1895= The western lot was the site of a tannery owned by Gert Eriksen Quitzows. It was rebuilt after the Fire of 1728 and was operated by the Quitzows family until 1782. It was then home to two merchants and a chair-maker until it was destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1805. =The new building = Valdemar Thaulow's hardware store The two lots were then merged into one property by tobacco manufacturer Hans Bredahl. He commissioned Lauritz Thrane (1757-1809) to construct in the building in 1796-97. He both lived there and ran his business from the premises. The building was later taken over by his widow. One of her many tenants was Counter admiral Lorentz Fjelderup Lassen (1756-1837), known from the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801, who was a resident in the building from 1822-1824. Tage Algreen-Ussing (1797-1872), a jurist, was a resident in the building in 1827. Another woman, Mrs. E. C. Gjestrup, acquired the building in circa 1830. She sold it to N. Christensen,a retired merchant, whose widow owned it until the early 1870s. Ludvig Colding (1815-1888). ab engineer and phtsicist, was a tenant in the building from 1848 to 1962. He was appointed to city engineer of Copenhagen (stadsingeni√∏r) in 1851. The navel officer and politician Otto H. L√ºtken (1813-1883) lived in the building from 1857. The new owner, A. Black, a physicist, did not live in Copenhagen. The property then changed hans a couple of times before it was acquired by Lemvigh-M√ºller & Munch, a wholesaler of iron based at No. 16.

It was built from 1847 to 1855, with the design attributed to Henry Robertson. It is also known as Pemell House. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  In 1847, businesswoman Mary Reibey bought the Pencilville house and estate from its financially beleaguered owner, William Manning, and took up residence in the house. In 1847, Reibey built Stanmore House nearby as a wedding present for her daughter, Elizabeth Long Innes, and her husband, Captain Joseph Long Innes. Mary Reibey died in May 1855, and the estate was left to her two surviving daughters, Eliza Thompson, and Elizabeth. Her mother's house was known as \\"Reiby House\\" after this time. In November 1855, Elizabeth and her husband formally separated; their marriage had been unhappy for some time. In January 1856, a \\"To Be Let\\" advertisement was placed in the Sydney Morning Herald. There are no records of the property from 1856 to 1861. It was rented to a succession of tenants thereafter: draper George Chisholm from 1861 to 1864, flour miller and politician James Pemell from 1864 to 1868, and Daniel Henry from 1868 to 1872. The Pencilville Estate was subdivided on 11 October 1871, and dense rows of Victorian terraces were built on its former land. The link - physically and visually - between the houses of mother (Reiby House) and daughter (Stanmore House) was broken. The open, semi-rural nature of the suburb disappeared, and the centre of Newtown, by now a major commercial centre, shifted to the east. On 3 July 1872, Daniel Henry bought Stanmore House. The sale documents are the first recorded reference to the name \\"Stanmore House\\". In 1876, he sold the property to James Pemell, his stepfather-in-law. On 11 November 1899, Pemell subdivided the estate; the eastern verandah and service wing were demolished at that time. In 1902 Sarah Rebecca Henry bought the house from her stepfather, Pemell, and demolished the western service wing to make Pemell Lane. In 1903, Dr Richard Trindall built a two-storey Queen Anne Federation house and surgery named Cronulla six feet away on the west side. In 1916, Dr Daniel Henry Beegling bought Stanmore House and uses it as a surgery; it passed to his widow Jean in 1926. In 1930 Margaret Finlay bought the house and divided it into four flats. A new brick facade was built upon the original stone front verandah, enclosing the verandah to form new kitchens. Three shops facing Enmore Road were built on the remaining pocket of garden. Edward Thomas Byrnes bought the house in 1935. It passed to his widow Elizabeth in 1960. A garage was added during their tenure. Reiby House was demolished in 1964. In 1970, Patris Projects bought Stanmore House and divided it into seven flats. Aluminium windows were put in, the back verandah was partially enclosed with fibro and the staircase balustrade was lost. The house was classified by the National Trust of Australia (NSW) in 1982. \\"Cronulla\\" was damaged in a fire and demolished in 1985. The cause of the fire was not found. The Heritage Council of NSW placed Permanent Conservation Order No. 662 on Stanmore House on 24 April 1989. In June 1995, the Heritage Council approved $3000 funding through its Heritage Assistance program to Marrickville Council for a Development Control Plan for the entire block bounded by Enmore Road, Reiby and Simmons Street and Pemell Lane.Long 1995  Description  Front doorcase with attached columns Stanmore House is a substantial two-storey brick house of late Colonial Regency design. It is symmetrical with a central entrance and gable. It has a gable \\"break\\" in its facade. The house when built has a one-storey verandah around its perimeter. There is a stone-constructed verandah to the rear of the house. It has an original basement. The interior contains original finely detailed cedar joinery, fireplaces, a geometrical staircase, fine entrance doorcase with attached columns, early ironwork and plaster ceilings.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Stanmore House is of State heritage significance for its associations with Mary Reibey. a noted emancipist entrepreneur and the Long Innes family. Constructed -1855 by Mary Reibey for her daughter Elizabeth Anne and son-in-law, Captain Joseph Long Innes. It is claimed that Innes' son Sir Joseph Long Innes, later Attorney General of New South Wales was born in Stanmore house in 1834. Stanmore House is a rare surviving architectural example of its period and has a unique ability to demonstrate a way of life when Newtown was considered a fashionable suburb. It is the last of the large suburban villas remaining in Newtown/Enmore from the period preceding the railway line, after which the suburb changed dramatically. The house has the ability to demonstrate the conscious attempts of the rich merchant class to recreate the marriage of architecture with landscape of the English Picturesque movement. Stanmore House is the last vestige of that era in Newtown and has unique social value in its ability to demonstrate a way of life. Stanmore House has been attributed to Henry Robertson who was a leading Sydney architect of the first half of the nineteenth century. It is the only known surviving house by him. The internal finishes of Stanmore House are of a high quality, and are largely intact.Long 1989 Stanmore House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Nicolosi globular projection distortion. Deeper tint means more distortion. Neutral color means distortion is balanced between angular deformation and areal inflation. Tissot indicatrix at 15¬∞ intervals. The Nicolosi globular projection is a map projection invented about the year 1,000 by the Iranian polymath al-Biruni. As a circular representation of a hemisphere, it is called globular because it evokes a globe. It can only display one hemisphere at a time and so normally appears as a \\"double hemispheric\\" presentation in world maps. The projection came into use in the Western world starting in 1660, reaching its most common use in the 19th century. As a \\"compromise\\" projection, it preserves no particular properties, instead giving a balance of distortions. History Ab≈´ Ray·∏•ƒÅn Mu·∏•ammad ibn A·∏•mad Al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´, who was the foremost Muslim scholar of the Islamic Golden Age, invented the first recorded globular projection for use in celestial maps about the year 1000. Centuries later, as Europe entered its Age of Discovery, the demand for world maps increased rapidly, sparking a vast experimentation with diverse map projections. Globular projections were one category that received early attention, with inventions by Roger Bacon in the 13th century, Petrus Apianus in the 16th century, and also in the 16th century by French Jesuit priest Georges Fournier. In 1660, Giovanni Battista Nicolosi, a Sicilian chaplain in Rome, reinvented Al-Biruni's projection as a modification of Fournier's first projection. It is unlikely Nicolosi knew of al-Biruni's work, and Nicolosi's name is the one usually associated with the projection. Nicolosi published a set of maps on the projection, one of the world in two hemispheres, and one each for the five known continents. Maps using the same projection appeared occasionally over the ensuring centuries, becoming relatively common in the 19th century as the stereographic projection fell out of common use for this purpose. Use of the Nicolosi projection continued into the early 20th century. It is rarely seen today. Description Nicolosi developed the projection as a drafting technique. Translating that into mathematical formulae yields: :begin{align} b &= frac{pi}{2 left(lambda-lambda_0 right)} - frac{2 left(lambda - lambda_0 right)}{pi}  c &= frac{2 varphi}{pi}  d &= frac{1 - c^2}{sin varphi - c}  M &= frac{frac{b sin varphi}{d} - frac{b}{2}}{1+frac{b^2}{d^2}}  N &= frac{frac{d^2 sin varphi}{b^2} + frac{d}{2}}{1+frac{d^2}{b^2}}  x &= frac{pi}{2} R left(M pm sqrt{M^2 + frac{cos^2 varphi}{1 + frac{b^2}{d^2}}}right)  y &= frac{pi}{2} R left(N pm sqrt{N^2 - frac{frac{d^2}{b^2}sin^2 varphi + d sin varphi - 1}{1 + frac{d^2}{b^2}}} right) end{align} Here, varphi is the latitude, lambda is the longitude, lambda_0 is the central longitude for the hemisphere, and R is the radius of the globe to be projected. In the formula for x, the pm sign takes the sign of lambda-lambda_0, i.e. take the positive root if lambda-lambda_0 is positive, or the negative root if lambda-lambda_0 is negative. In the formula for y, the pm sign takes the opposite sign of varphi, i.e. take the positive root if varphi is negative, or the negative root if varphi is positive. Under certain circumstances, the full formulae fail. Use the following formulae instead: When lambda-lambda_0 = 0, :begin{align} x &= 0  y &= R varphi end{align} When varphi = 0, :begin{align} x &= R left(lambda - lambda_0 right)  y &= 0 end{align} When lambda - lambda_0 = frac{pi}{2}, :begin{align} x &= R left(lambda - lambda_0 right) cos varphi  y &= frac{pi}{2} R sin varphi end{align} When varphi = frac{pi}{2}, :begin{align} x &= 0  y &= R varphi end{align} See also *List of map projections References External links *Image of Nicolosi's world map at the David Rumsey collection.

Interior view of Fukui Prefectural Varve Museum. Varve and various historical/archaeological evidence are discussed together. Lake Suigetsu, one of Five Lakes of Mikata, is located in Wakasa Town, Mikatakaminaka District, Fukui Prefecture. It is a brackish water lake, with an area of 4.06 km¬≤, a perimeter of 9.85 km, and a maximum depth of 38.0 m, making it the largest among the five. It lacks directly inflowing river which can disturb the precipitate on the lake bottom. Because of this, the sediments annually form varve and then remain undisturbed. In addition, the lack of oxygen in the water at the lake bottom make it inhabitable to lifeforms, which also helps to keep the varve undisturbed. Also, because of a fault running nearby, the lake gradually lowers its altitude and is never filled up with sediments. With these serendipitous conditions combined, the varve found in the Lake Suigetsu is now known as ‚ÄúMiraculous Sediments‚Äù. The investigation of Lake Suigetsu started on 1991. In boring expedition on 2006, it was not possible to recover 70 m-long varve as one continuous core. Therefore the boring was conducted from 4 different spots, each 1 m long at a time. By matching varve patterns between the core samples, a 70 m-long varve was reconstituted. This equals to a 160,000 year-long varve without any discontinuity and was named SG06 (from Suigetsu, 2006). A team of international collaboration members from Japan, UK, and Germany measured the ratio between radiocarbon 14C and stable isotope 12C throughout the layers of the varve and obtained calibration data of radiocarbon dating 11,200 ‚Äì 52,800 years ago. This result was published in Science . The error of this calibration is estimated to be about 170 years in 50,000. From this precision, the data obtained from Lake Suigetsu is determined to be the world de facto standard of the radiocarbon dating for geological science in International Radiocarbon Conference held in UNESCO Headaquater in France on July 13, 2014.Á¨¨10ÂõûÁí∞Â¢É„Çµ„Ç§„Ç®„É≥„Çπ„Ç´„Éï„Çß 7‰∏áÊú¨„ÅÆÁ∏ûÊ®°Êßò„Å®70‰∏áÁ≤í„ÅÆËä±Á≤â- Ê∞¥ÊúàÊπñ„ÅÆÂúü„ÅåË™û„ÇãÊ∞óÂÄôÂ§âÂãï7‰∏áÂπ¥„ÅÆÊ≠¥Âè≤ P.12-P.21Ôºà2013Âπ¥6Êúà26Êó•ÊôÇÁÇπ„ÅÆ„Ç¢„Éº„Ç´„Ç§„ÉñÔºâ - Êó•Á´ãÁí∞Â¢ÉË≤°Âõ£HPÊó•Êú¨‰∫∫„ÅÆÊ¥ªË∫ç„Åß5‰∏á2800Âπ¥Ââç„Åæ„ÅßÈÅ°„Çå„ÇãÂπ¥‰ª£ÁõÆÁõõ„Çä„ÅåÂÆåÊàê - Science„Åå‰ºöË¶ãÔºà2012Âπ¥10Êúà23Êó•ÊôÇÁÇπ„ÅÆ„Ç¢„Éº„Ç´„Ç§„ÉñÔºâ - „Éû„Ç§„Éä„Éì„Éã„É•„Éº„Çπ„ÄÅ2012Âπ¥10Êúà22Êó•„ÄÇ This museum introduces research on the varve in Lake Suigetsu.

He operated in the city of Yekaterinburg, in the area of the ferro-concrete products factory, for which he received the nickname \\"The Concrete Products Maniac\\".  Biography  Karimov worked as a bricklayer in Yekaterinburg when he committed his first offense in 2004. He attacked his girlfriend, punching her several times, then raped and strangled her with a rope. When she lost consciousness, Karimov, thinking he had killed her, took her cell phone and threw the body under a heater. The girl appealed to the police after she woke up, but did not report the rape and attempted murder, explaining that \\"she just got a job, and did not need any problems with the police\\". Karimov was convicted of robbery and infliction of bodily injuries, and was sentenced to two years imprisonment. The first murder he committed was in December 2005, on the territory of the Yekaterinburg Mayanovskoye Central Park of Culture. He killed a 15-year-old schoolgirl, who had just left school and was walking around the park. After killing her, Karimov took her cell phone, 700 rubles and a gold chain, as well as her ID, which he subsequently burned. All subsequent murders Karimov committed were during the next three months. After getting acquainted with future victims, Karimov introduced himself as a tourist who asked for them to show him the sights around Yekaterinburg, or would pose as a policeman who asked them to go with him to the police station. Sometimes he attacked without warning, and thus had no consistent modus operandi. In some cases, he would stab his victims with knives (one of them had been stabbed 20 times), and in others he strangled them with his bare hands or with a rope. All six subsequent murders were committed in the area of the concrete products plant, from which he earned his nickname. In March 2006, Karimov attacked two girls in the area of the concrete products factory. Despite the knife injuries, they managed to escape, and later identified Karimov, who was arrested on March 22, 2006. During the investigation, Karimov denied the rapes, claiming that his victims offered to have sex with him. He calmly admitted to the murders, however, and showed the crime scenes to the investigators. As a result, he confessed to seven murders and three attempted murders. The forensic psychiatric examination diagnosed Karimov as having a \\"mixed-mosaic personality disorder\\", and, as a result, was mentally unbalanced. Despite this, he was declared sane. At the trial, Karimov did not deny any charge, kept his head bowed and never made eye contact with his victims' relatives. On March 15, 2007, Dmitry Karimov was sentenced to life imprisonment. He was also ordered to pay 500,000 rubles to the victims' families, and 50,000 rubles to the victims of the attempted murders. The Supreme Court of Russia left the verdict unchanged, and is currently being enforced. Karimov is currently serving his sentence in the White Swan prison.

Life  Shilling joined the Nikolai Cadet Corps in 1888 and the 1st Pavel Military School in 1890. He served in the elite guard, the Izmailovsky Regiment, between 1888 and 1913, and reached the rank of colonel in 1909. During the First World War he commanded the 5th Finnish Rifles Regiment, until he was promoted in 1915 to major general and put in command of a brigade of the 2nd Finnish Rifle Division. In 1916 he went to command the Izmaylovsky Regiment and between July 1917 and February 1918, the 17th Army Corps. After the signing of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, Shilling entered in the service of the German-controlled Ukrainian State of Pavlo Skoropadskyi until its collapse in December 1918, when he joined the White Russian Volunteer Army. He commanded the 5th Infantry Division between February and June 1919, and then until August the 3rd Army Corps. He distinguished himself in that period by taking Kherson, Mykolaiv and Odessa. Between September 1919 and February 1920, he was military commander and governor of Ukraine and the Crimea, until he was forced out of Odessa by the Red Army's Odessa Operation (1920). He was widely criticised for the disastrous evacuation of the city on 6 and 7 February 1920, when thousands of White soldiers and civilians were left behind to fall into the hands of the Red Army and the Cheka. When Anton Denikin was replaced by Pyotr Wrangel at the head of the AFSR, Shilling was retired and emigrated to Czechoslovakia, where he temporarily led the Foreign Union of Russian War Veterans. When the Red Army entered that country in 1945, the SMERSH arrested him, although shortly after, he was released. He died the following year in Prague.  Sources  * Smele, Jonathan D. (2015).

Biography  Panchenko was born on January 27, 1968 in Svetlogorsk. In 1986, he was convicted for desertion from the military unit and theft. He was also twice convicted for the acquisition and possession of drugs, and for the murder of a colleague with whom he deserted together. After the murder, Panchenko was hiding in a dugout in the forest. After returning from the colony, Panchenko began his murder spree. On September 30, 1998, he shot his 18-year-old sister-in-law on the banks of the Kalaus River, then drowned the body. Four months later, he kidnapped his wife's 16-year-old younger sister, whom he held in the dugout for three years, repeatedly raping her before eventually killing her. Four months after that, he killed a 15-year-old friend of the second victim. However, Panchenko was soon detained and convicted for the murder of a colleague. He was released on parole in May 2007. On October 5, 2008, Panchenko's son brought home two girls, 8 and 11 years old, whom Ivan lured into the dugout and locked in. He began to torture the younger girl, in the end eventually brutally beating her and burying her alive. He then planted a seedling at the burial site. During the day, he raped the 11-year-old girl, forcing her to wear a dog collar around her neck, but the police officers called by her parents managed to locate him with the help of a service dog. Panchenko was arrested on October 6, 2008. Panchenko soon confessed to everything, including the murders from 10 years ago. During a search of his home, women's belongings were found which belonged to the victims. The forensic psychiatric examination recognized Panchenko as sane, and responsible for his actions. The investigation into the \\"Svetlograd Maniac\\" case was held in closed session and within the shortest time frame possible. On April 3, 2009, the Stavropol Regional Court sentenced Ivan Panchenko to life imprisonment and a fine of 800,000 rubles. The Supreme Court of Russia upheld the verdict without change.

In its early years the hotel had a stable attached on the Fifth Avenue side of the building. During the Great Depression the hotel was able to maintain its reputation as a \\"refined, well-kept hotel\\". The Wigwam Bar opened at the hotel in 1939 and contained images of the pilgrims and Native Americans. In 1949, the hotel was the headquarters of the National Council of the Arts, Sciences and Professionals. James Dean lived at the hotel for two years from 1951 to 1953 in room 83.

\\"Resort Maniac\\", is a Ukrainian-born Russian serial killer who killed 10 people and attempted to kill 2 others in St. Petersburg between 1996 and 1998. Before the murders, he always raped his victims, and always killed with particular cruelty, dismembering and decapitating bodies. In at least one case, cannibalism was involved.  Biography  Shemyakov was born in 1975. After school he joined the army, and served with the border troops in the town of Kuvshinskaya Salma. According to some reports, he was bullied by senior officials while in the army. Upon returning home to St. Petersburg he worked as a security guard and was fond of computer equipment. In his private life, however, Shemyakov had problems such as experiencing frequent headaches and having trouble socializing with girls. He also lived with his parents. After seeing the film \\"The Dawns Here Are Quiet\\", Shemyakov decided that he wanted to kill women. The film, most likely, had nothing to do with it, but it is believed that it influenced him through imprinting. Shemyakov committed all of his murders on the outskirts of St. Petersburg or outside the city, his youngest victim being 11 years old. In two cases, the assault did not end with murder - in the first case, Shemyakov was scared off by a passer-by, and in the second he released the victim voluntarily and asked her to inform the police of his deeds, probably realising the danger he posed. The maniac was caught after killing his sister's girlfriend. Shemyakov's mother also found in her refrigerator a half- eaten piece of human meat. She called the police, and upon returning home Shemyakov was arrested by the police. Although he was warned by a neighbor about the ambush in his apartment, he said that he did not care and went right into the hands of the authorities. Experts diagnosed Shemyakov as a paranoid schizophrenic (he himself said that he was ordered to \\"kill the people and drown their heads\\" with \\"eyes in the water\\"). As a result, he was found insane and to compulsory treatment in a psychiatric hospital in 2002. Relatives of the victims repeatedly tried to appeal the court's decision, but the verdict has remained unchanged.

The terrace houses were built from 1888 to 1891 by John Walsh. It is also known as Randwick Mansions. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. , the terrace houses are predominately used as domestic housing, with one of the terraces used as a boutique hotel.  History  The site was originally part of an 1864 land grant to the Church of England, most of which was used for St. Judes Church Cemetery on the west side of the Church and Municipal Council Chambers on Frenchmans Road (now Avoca Street) and bordering Frances Street and Johns Lane (renamed The Avenue in 1895). The land grant comprised three acres, three roods, and thirty seven perches, which is approximately 1.6 hectares. The 1864 map shows the present attractive park opposite the terrace was offered to five other denominations to provide a Cemetery for Wesleyans, Independents, Jews, other denominations, and the largest sections for Roman Catholics and Presbyterians. The land was not taken up by those religious bodies within the required time and was consequently resumed by the Government to be used as a cricket ground. In June 1886 a Select Committee of the NSW Legislative Assembly was set up to consider and report on the \\"Randwick Cemetery Unused Lands Sale Bill\\" and determine if there were any bodies buried in the unused section of the land proposed for sale by the Trustees of St. Jude's Church, and secondly to enquire as to what purposes the money from this sale would be put to. In 1868 an Act was passed prohibiting any more burials at Randwick except in the fenced Cemetery ground already taken up. Residents had expressed concern about pollution of the water supply from the Cemetery. Witnesses called included Geo. Bishop, a Surveyor and the Rev. W. Hough incumbent of St. Jude's, as well as one of the Cemetery Trustees and the Caretaker. They all agreed that there were no bodies left in the proposed section; as the remains of two infants and one adult had been removed two years before. The witnesses also agreed that money realised from such a sale would be spent on enlarging the Church; providing suitable accommodation for the caretaker; plus funds to keep the Cemetery in better order, and to give a grant towards erecting a new Church in Coogee. It was expected that about $6,000 would be raised as local land values at that time were between $36 and $32 per foot (0.304 m.) In May 1888 the Church sold off an area of one acre, one rood and one and a half perches - approximately .510 of a hectare to John Walsh. The first of the terraces to be built was the middle terrace - the largest of the nine terraces. It was built by John Walsh, a building contractor, as his own family home. It was commenced after May 1888, he then continued building the adjoining terraces. Which were completed by February 1891 with tenants in all but No. 8 according to the Randwick Rate books. The 1889 Randwick Rate records as at February are marked no residents. However Rates were charged to J. Walsh on Nos. 1 to 9, marked \\"Houses\\". They were Valued at $280 each for the eight smaller terraces and $320 for No. 5 - \\"Avonmore\\". Rates paid were $12.20 each for the 8, and $14.40 for \\"Avonmore\\". In 1890 Rate records show 3 residents - \\"John Walsh, Contractor, \\"Avonmore\\" - in No. 5 (now No. 34), No. 1 - Mr. Thompson and in No. 8 - James Angus - tenants. John Walsh was a successful Building and Railway Contractor who was born in County Galway, Ireland in 1843. He built railways in Queensland. In 1867 John married Margaret Jane Clohesy from Kilkenny, Ireland, at Brisbane. She was 22. Walsh built the Goulburn to Cooma Railway and apparently made enough money by 1888 to build the nine three storey terraces. John's wife Margaret produced six daughters in the twenty years up to 1888, consequently they needed a large residence with a bedroom for each girl, guests bedrooms, and servants quarters. It has been speculated that the large reception rooms on the ground floor were used for entertaining the local important families, and showing off the eligible daughters. \\"Avonmore\\" has about 16 rooms. In 1891 the Rate Books show some early citizens of note in Walsh's Terrace.

John Walsh died on 13 February 1893 aged 50 years and was buried in Waverley Cemetery. His widow, Margaret then moved to No. 2 and continued renting the eight terraces, via the Perpetual Trustees, until 1905 when they were all sold to the Estate of B.O. Holterman. Just prior to the First World War the terrace row was named 'Randwick Mansions.' From 1903 until 1908 Lotaville Private School for young ladies was conducted at Avonmore by Professor Patrick Henry Hughes, who was born in 1839 in Corfu, and his wife Mary Jane born in 1840. Boarders were also accommodated. High standards were apparently achieved as some pupils obtained university qualifications from Lotaville. From 1909 to Brighton College took over at Avonmore, under Miss Amos and Richard C.Amos. They probably took over the pupils from Lotaville School.June Moore 1998 No. 34 is currently run as a boutique hotel. The remaining terraces are all in private ownership.  Description  Avonmore is a group of nine three-storey Victorian Italianate terrace houses of imposing proportions with number 34 being the central and grandest one. It is constructed of load-bearing rendered brick and a timber framer roof. The central terrace (No. 34) is divided into five bays with a window or door opening in each bay and at each storey. Large tower providing centrepiece for the whole row. The central bay projects in front of the bays on either side and is unique to the central terrace. All of the other terraces in the row have only two bays with bullnose verandahs. The facade has a heavy balustraded parapet except at the central bay which has a broken pediment surmounted by an urn. The lettering 'AVONMORE\\" is set in the walling in the pediment. Interior contains carved staircase engraved with family initials, \\"W\\" may also be seen in the cornices of various rooms. Stained glass adorns the large front door. Marble and tiled fireplaces. Ornamental ceilings. Palisade fence. Magnificent cast iron lace work and elaborate mouldings. Some original tiled verandahs and pathways.Heritage Branch files. = Condition = As at 22 September 2011, the physical condition is good.  Heritage listing  As at 22 September 2011, Avonmore is a group of nine Italianate terrace houses of imposing proportions. It was built by John Walsh who completed it in 1888. The row is significant for its Victorian Italianate style fa√ßade, its decorative detail and large rooms. Being located opposite Alison Park, it is important for the contribution it makes to the St. Judes Precinct. The elements of the row considered to be of high significance are the entire fa√ßade including the central tower and the verandahs with cast iron balustrades and corrugated iron roofs. The interiors (hallways, front rooms, stairs and fireplaces) of some of the houses are of high significance. The row of terraces demonstrates the process of subdivision and development in Randwick in the late 19th century and the wealth and expectations of the period. Avonmore Terrace was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

She was among the most notable sculptors of 20th century, gaining international recognition between two world wars. Biography In her early youth, Vukosava Velimiroviƒá wrote songs, fairy tales, drew cartoons for children, rules of clay shape, which became clear at that time that her life would be marked by art. She grew up in an intellectual and patriarchal family, and she had two older brothers who studied in Moscow and St. Petersburg, the other members of the family received letters about all kinds of events and novelties in the world of sciences and arts that they were interested in. In 1911, the whole family moved to Belgrade, where Vukosava's father Milo≈° was transferred. Immediately after arriving in the Serbian capital, Vukosava enrolled at the Arts and Crafts School and there began her artistic life. It is told that Vukosava's generation of students was one of the most talented, such as Zora Petroviƒá, Jelisaveta Petroviƒá, Nada ƒêukanoviƒá, Olga Golemoviƒá, Dara Miƒáiƒá, Jelena Radakoviƒá and many other great artists who attended the same school. Patriarchal Belgrade society was changing at the turn of the century, providing a window of opportunity for the \\"creative power of women\\", whose rise was recognized by philosopher Ksenija Atanasijeviƒá in her 1924 essay. At the time Vukosava Velimiroviƒá, a woman sculptor was attracting great public attention. She was educated in Belgrade, Rome, and Paris, where she spent most of her life between 1918 and 1940 in the company of some great female sculptors, including Camille Claudel. She was a sculptor known for her energetic, small bronze sculptures depicting poor war orphans. As an artist, she had strong beliefs and felt a need for artists to create politically and socially conscious works of art that reflected current events and issues. She spent much of her life working toward equal rights for Serbian women and a widespread push for equality. Around 1924, her most famous pieces, five decorative sculptures caused a sensation when they were permanently exhibited on the facade of the Vraƒçar Holding Bank at 1 Krunska Street. Facade sculpture was considered a masculine applied discipline, though with Velimiroviƒá's creations that notion had to be put to rest for once and for all. https://books.google.ca/books?id=B5FRBwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA153&lpg;=PA153&dq;=vukosava+velimirovic&source;=bl&ots;=jbUmgA9KIZ&sig;=Vq1UTQIZbMUq34jnCIDGc_5tVxI&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiN_ZnahvbdAhWj7oMKHST7APo4ChDoATAHegQIABAB#v=onepage&q;=vukosava%20velimirovic&f;=false Velimiroviƒç also had a successful career as a portraitist of the European upper classes.

It targeted the remnants of the Japanese Combined Fleet located in and near the Japanese city of Kure. The attack by 321 aircraft was unsuccessful, as no Japanese warships were sunk though several were damaged. Japanese forces struck the American fleet on the morning of 19 March, and crippled one aircraft carrier and badly damaged another. Background As part of the planning for the invasion of Okinawa, the United States Navy's Fast Carrier Task Force (designated Task Force 58) was ordered to neutralize airfields in the Japanese home islands which could be used to attack the invasion force after the landings commenced on 1 April 1945. As part of these operations, the Task Force was also to attack Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) warships sheltering in ports. Two of Task Force 58's aircraft carriers at Ulithi atoll in mid-March 1945 Task Force 58 was the main striking element of the United States Pacific Fleet. It included 15 aircraft carriers, and was organised into four task groups. The March attacks would be the third time Task Force 58 had struck the Japanese home islands. The first had been a series of raids on airfields which took place on 16 and 17 February 1945, in which the American aviators claimed to have destroyed 341 Japanese aircraft in the air and 190 on the ground for the loss of 80 of their own to all causes. The second raid had been made against airfields in the Tokyo region on 25 February, in which the Americans claimed 46 Japanese aircraft while losing 16. After this attack, Task Force 58 returned to its base at Ulithi atoll to rest and prepare for further operations. By this stage of the war, the IJN was largely confined to port. Its major warships had suffered heavy casualties during 1944, and little fuel remained for those which survived. Most of the Combined Fleet, the IJN's main combat force, was stationed at the major naval base at Kure on the Seto Inland Sea. This port was defended by hundreds of anti-aircraft guns; USN intelligence estimated that these included 160 large- caliber weapons and hundreds more smaller-caliber guns. Prelude Task Force 58 departed Ulithi on 14 March to commence the pre-invasion attacks on the Japanese home islands. Japanese forces located and tracked the Task Force as it approached, but were unsure whether it was a precursor to the landing on Okinawa or another attack against airfields. On 18 March Task Force 58's aircraft attacked 45 airfields on Kyushu. Few Japanese aircraft were found on the airfields, but large numbers attacked the American aircraft in flight. Other Japanese aircraft attacked Task Force 58, and lightly damaged the aircraft carriers and . The suffered more extensive damage after being hit by a bomb which killed 5 of her crew and wounded 26. A total of 110 Japanese aircraft were destroyed. American photo reconnaissance aircraft also operated over Japan on 18 March, and located concentrations of IJN warships at Kure and Kobe. The ships identified as being at Kure included the battleships Yamato and Haruna as well as three light aircraft carriers. The ships located on 18 March were selected as Task Force 58's main objective for the next day's attacks. Task Groups 58.1, 58.3 and 58.4 were to attack Kure, and Task Group 58.2 was to strike Kobe. Fighter aircraft were directed to sweep ahead of the American dive bombers and torpedo bombers and attack Japanese aircraft. The main target specified for the attack on Kure was the port's oil storage tanks and other naval installations, but the strike coordinator, Commander George M. Ottinger, was authorised to redirect the USN aircraft against other targets. Attacks =Japanese attacks on Task Force 58= USS Franklin on fire after being struck by two bombs on 19 March 1945 Japanese aircraft were dispatched at dawn to strike Task Force 58, with their attacks being focused on Task Group 58.2. At 7:10 AM a Japanese aircraft arrived undetected over the Task Group, and hit the aircraft carrier with a single bomb. The bomb penetrated deep into the ship, and exploded in her galley. This killed many of the cooks and mess attendants who were preparing breakfast, and started fires. Due to efficient damage control, the fires were extinguished within 15 minutes, and the carrier resumed flying operations at 8:00 AM. However, 101 of her crew were killed and 269 wounded. A near-miss by a kamikaze shortly after 8 AM caused minor damage. The aircraft carrier was also attacked. While she was launching her second strike of the day at 7:08 AM, the ship was struck by two bombs dropped from a Japanese aircraft which had also avoided detection. Huge fires rapidly broke out throughout Franklin, and weapons which had been loaded onto her strike aircraft exploded as the fire reached them. Franklins crew managed to save the ship, but 724 were killed and 265 wounded. =Air to air combat= Task Force 58 began flying off fighter aircraft which were to sweep over the airfields around Kure at 6:18 AM on 19 March. As they approached Kure, the 20 Grumman F6F Hellcats of VBF-17 encountered 40 fighters from the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service's elite 343rd K≈çk≈´tai. In a battle which lasted 25 minutes, six American and four Japanese fighters were shot down. Other engagements between American and Japanese fighters were fought around the Kure area throughout 19 March. Some of the Japanese pilots flew two sorties. The total casualties from this fighting, including the engagement between VBF-17 and the 343rd K≈çk≈´tai, was 14 American and 25 Japanese aircraft shot down. =Attack on Kure= A large force of aircraft was dispatched to attack Kure. It was made up of 158 Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bombers and Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers, escorted by 163 Hellcats and Vought F4U Corsair fighters. At least some of the Corsairs were armed with rockets which could be used to attack ground targets. This was almost as many aircraft as the IJN had employed in the attack on Pearl Harbor which brought the United States into the Pacific War on 7 December 1941. Yamato under attack off Kure on 19 March Ottinger arrived over Kure with the first wave of aircraft. After sighting multiple warships, he ordered that half of the bombers target ships instead of the planned attacks on shore installations. After further consideration, he directed all of the bombers to attack the three Japanese battleships, four aircraft carriers and ten other warships which were at anchor in the Kure area. 's air group commenced the attack on Kure. They concentrated on the aircraft carrier Ry≈´h≈ç, which was struck by three bombs and two rockets. These caused considerable damage, and killed 20 of her crew. Two of Bunker Hills Helldivers were shot down. All four of the battleships at Kure were targeted. Wasps air group focused on Hy≈´ga, but only hit her with a single bomb which killed about 40 sailors. Her sister ship Ise was struck by two bombs. The Haruna, which was anchored in the roadstead off Kure, was hit by one bomb which caused little damage. The huge battleship Yamato was targeted by aircraft from Intrepid, but only struck by a single bomb which exploded on her bridge. The other three aircraft carriers were also struck. The escort carrier Kaiy≈ç was worst-hit, and caught fire after being attacked. This caused flooding which almost capsized the ship; to avoid this fate she was towed into shallow water. The aircraft carrier Katsuragi was hit by a bomb, and a near miss opened her hull and caused flooding. A single bomb struck the flight deck of her sister ship Amagi. As well as the capital ships, the light cruiser ≈åyodo was heavily hit. The ship began flooding after being struck by three bombs, and was towed to Etajima and beached to prevent her from sinking. Kure's anti-aircraft defenses fired on the American aircraft throughout the attack. This was the most intense anti-aircraft fire experienced by Task Force 58's aviators up to that time, and eleven Helldivers and two Avengers were shot down. These losses were lighter than what had been expected by most of the Task Force's officers, however. Aftermath The attack on Kure was unsuccessful. Despite the large size of the attack force and its achievement of air superiority, Task Force 58's aircraft achieved few hits on Japanese warships. No Japanese warships were sunk, and only an escort carrier and a light cruiser were badly damaged. The American airmen were disappointed with the results of the attack, but knew that they would strike Kure again. Ottinger and 35 other airmen were awarded the Navy Cross for their roles in the attack. After completing the attacks on Kure and Kobe, Task Force 58 withdrew south. It flew further fighter sweeps over southern Kyushu on 19 and 20 March. Task Group 58.2 was attacked again by Japanese aircraft on the afternoon of 20 March, with destroyer being hit by a kamikaze and Enterprises flight deck being rendered unusable after she was accidentally struck by anti- aircraft fire from other American warships. On the afternoon of 21 March, 48 Japanese aircraft attempted to attack Task Force 58, but the raid was driven off with heavy casualties after it was intercepted by 150 American fighters. The damaged carriers Franklin, Enterprise and Yorktown were subsequently detached, and departed for repairs. The damage to Franklin was so extensive that she never saw active use again. The Fast Carrier Task Force operated in Japanese waters for the remainder of the war. On 18 July 1945 it attacked Yokosuka. This raid was focused on the battleship Nagato, which was lightly damaged. The Task Force and the British Pacific Fleet attacked Kure and the Inland Sea area again on 24 and 28 July. These raids sunk or crippled three battleships, three aircraft carriers, two heavy cruisers and two other cruisers, and damaged several other warships. Allied casualties in this operation were high, with 126 aircraft being destroyed and 102 aircrew killed.

He was then director of the Conservatoire de Lille for 33 years, until his death.  Life  Born in Saint-Amand-les-Eaux, Nord department of France in a family of carillonneurs, Lannoy was quickly introduced to the bell tradition. He began his musical studies at the Conservatory of Valenciennes where he studied harmony, violin and bassoon with master Fernand Lamy. He was accepted at the Conservatoire de Paris and obtained the supreme awards in the writing classes. He presented himself in vain for the first time for the Prix de Rome in 1938. During his studies at the conservatory, he was also a soldier-musician in the 5th Line Infantry Regiment of Courbevoie. Lannoy was taken prisoner at the beginning of the Second World War and remained so for 5 years despite a few escapes. Sent to Czechoslovakia, he escaped but could not resist visiting Bayreuth, the city of Wagner and was retaken. Sent to Ukraine, in the disciplinary camp of Rawa Ruska, he attempted another escape in 1942, which led to his internment at the citadel of Lemberg. Then sent to Austria in 1943 in a Stalag, he was appointed Kapellmeister and organized orchestras, choirs and even a ballet- mime,Pygmalion, played by prisoners in Poland. He was rewarded for these facts by the m√©daille de la R√©sistance, the medal of and the Escapees' Medal. Freed by the American army, he returned to Paris in 1945. At the request of the Americans, he composed the music for the documentary film Homecoming, recounting the return of prisoners after the Second World War and directed by Henri Cartier-Bresson. For the radio, and at the request of Henri Dutilleux, he composed La l√©gende des pays alli√©s by Louise de Vilmorin He competed again for the Prix de Rome in 1946 and obtained a second major prize, which earned him the position of director of the Conservatoire de Lille. It was during this period that he married pianist Lola Delwarde, who had a brilliant career as a concert pianist. He conducted many concerts and introduced a whole generation of Lille students to music. Lannoy died in Lille in June 1979.

It is one of the top 10% of most downloaded R packages.  R datasets  R functionality is extendible using extensions call R packages. The central place from which to install packages is the Central R Archive network (CRAN). From CRAN, R packages can be installed using the command (here to install datasets.load): install.packages('datasets.load') Once installed, R packages can be loaded using the command: library(datasets.load) After a package has been loaded, objects available from the package - such as functions and datasets - can be accessed. The datasets from all the loaded packages can listed using the command: data() However, datasets from packages that are not loaded, are not listed. As a result, many R users have access to datasets on their local install that are never used. The datasets.load packages addresses this by listed all datasets that are in any packages installed (loaded or not loaded).  Usage  datasets.load GUI demonstration A video demonstrating the GUI usage is available via the thumbnail on the right and on YouTube.

Reception  The initial release on CRAN of version 0.1.0 took place in December 2016, and averaged a download rate of 1,000 times per month, from the RStudio servers alone. With the release of version 0.3.0 in 2018, the download rate increased to 2,000 times per month, putting the package in the 9th percentile of most popular R packages. The package was reviewed in the 2017 article \\"R Packages worth a look\\" on Data Analytics & R, which further increased usage. It is also frequently preinstalled on university computers, in order to help make R more accessible to students. Version 1.0.0 was released on 12 December 2019, with a version 1.4.0 which was built against R 4.0.0 being released on 27 April 2020. The RStudio CRAN mirror download logs show that the package is downloaded more than 2,000 times per month from those servers , with a total of over 65,000 downloads since the first release , according to RDocumentation.org, this puts the package in the 9th percentile of most popular R packages.

At Sedbergh he was an assistant under Dr. Wynne Bateman from 1768 to 1771. Wilson was ordained deacon at Westminster on 13 January 1771, and priest at Chester on 2 August 1772. In the following June he was licensed as headmaster of Slaidburn grammar school, and in June 1775 became master of Clitheroe grammar school, Lancashire, and incumbent of the parochial chapel of the town. In 1779 Wilson entered Trinity College, Cambridge, and he took the degree of B.D. there in 1795, as a ten year man under an Elizabethan statute. In 1807 he was appointed rector of Claughton, near Lancaster. The living was provided by Thomas Fenwick of Borough Hall, Westmorland, a former pupil. Towards the end of the eighteenth century Wilson became friends with Thomas Dunham Whitaker, and joined his literary club. He was a successful schoolmaster, a versifier, and a social favourite, wit and raconteur, fond of punning.

The church was designed by Sir John Sulman and built from 1889 to 1890 by George Gale. The property is owned by the Randwick Presbyterian Church and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 8 May 2008.  History  =Indigenous history= Pre-1780s the local Aboriginal people in the area used the site for fishing and cultural activities; rock engravings, grinding grooves and middens remain in evidence. In 1789 Governor Arthur Phillip referred to \\"a long bay\\", which became known as Long Bay. Aboriginal people are believed to have inhabited the Sydney region for at least 20,000 years.Turbet, 2001. The population of Aboriginal people between Palm Beach and Botany Bay in 1788 has been estimated to have been 1,500. Those living south of Port Jackson to Botany Bay were the Cadigal people who spoke Dharug,Randwick Library webpage, 2003. while the local clan name of Maroubra people was \\"Muru-ora-dial\\".City of Sydney webpage, 2003. By the mid-19th century the traditional owners of this land had typically either moved inland in search of food and shelter or had died as the result of European disease or confrontation with British colonisers. =Colonial history= One of the earliest land grants in this area was made in 1824 to Captain Francis Marsh, who received 12 acres bounded by the present Botany and High Streets, Alison and Belmore Roads. In 1839 William Newcombe acquired the land north-west of the present town hall in Avoca Street. Randwick takes its name from the town of Randwick, Gloucestershire, England. The name was suggested by Simeon Pearce (1821‚Äì86) and his brother James. Simeon was born in the English Randwick and the brothers were responsible for the early development of both Randwick and its neighbour, Coogee. Simeon had come to the colony in 1841as a 21-year-old surveyor. He built his Blenheim House on the 4 acres he bought from Marsh, and called his property \\"Randwick\\". The brothers bought and sold land profitably in the area and elsewhere. Simeon campaigned for construction of a road from the city to Coogee (achieved in 1853) and promoted the incorporation of the suburb. Pearce sought construction of a church modelled on the church of St. John in his birthplace. In 1857 the first St Jude's stood on the site of the present post office, at the corner of the present Alison Road and Avoca Street.Pollen & Healy, 1988. Randwick was slow to progress. The village was isolated from Sydney by swamps and sandhills, and although a horse-bus was operated by a man named Grice from the late 1850s, the journey was more a test of nerves than a pleasure jaunt. Wind blew sand over the track, and the bus sometimes became bogged, so that passengers had to get out and push it free. From its early days, Randwick had a divided society. The wealthy lived elegantly in large houses built when Pearce promoted Randwick and Coogee as a fashionable area. But the market gardens, orchards and piggeries that continued alongside the large estates were the lot of the working class. Even on the later estates that became racing empires, many jockeys and stablehands lived in huts or even under canvas. An even poorer group were the immigrants who existed on the periphery of Randwick in a place called Irishtown, in the area now known as The Spot, around the junction of St. Paul's Street and Perouse Road. Here families lived in makeshift houses, taking on the most menial tasks in their struggle to survive. In 1858 when the NSW Government passed the Municipalities Act, enabling formation of municipal districts empowered to collect rates and borrow money to improve their suburb, Randwick was the first suburb to apply for the status of a municipality. It was approved in February 1859, and its first Council was elected in March 1859. Randwick had been the venue for sporting events, as well as duels and illegal sports, from the early days in the colony's history. Its first racecourse, the Sandy Racecourse or Old Sand Track, had been a hazardous track over hills and gullies since 1860. When a move was made in 1863 by John Tait, to establish Randwick Racecourse, Simeon Pearce was furious, especially when he heard that Tait also intended to move into Byron Lodge. Tait's venture prospered, however, and he became the first person in Australia to organise racing as a commercial sport. The racecourse made a big difference to the progress of Randwick. The horse-bus gave way to trams that linked the suburb to Sydney and civilisation. Randwick soon became a prosperous and lively place, and it still retains a busy residential, professional and commercial life. Today, some of the houses have been replaced by home units. Many European migrants have made their homes in the area, along with students and workers at the nearby University of NSW and the Prince of Wales Hospital. The founder and promoter of the village of Randwick was Simeon Pearce who envisaged the area as a \\"New Brighton\\" by the sea but also as a place that had many of the traditional English village qualities of his birthplace of Randwick in Gloustershire. As a Commissioner of Church and School lands he was well placed to have areas of land set aside for church and school use, and in 1854 a large area of land was granted on the east side of Alison Park for Church of England use then in 1857 on the west side for the Presbyterian Church. Between the church lands, Simeon proposed a general cemetery but because of residents objections this became a cricket ground (later renamed to Alison Park). =The establishment of the Randwick Presbyterian Congregation= Up until the 1880s Sydney's Presbyterians had worshipped in Presbyterian churches located in Sydney City. However, in the 1880s this trend changed with a preliminary meeting of the Randwick Congregation in the Randwick Town Hall on 17 November 1884; the first Presbyterian service in Waverley was held on 17 January 1885; and in Woollahra on 12 February 1888. An interim session was appointed by the Presbytery to assist the Randwick parishioners in establishing a church there and the Moderator Rev. Dr Gilchrist conducted the first session at the Town Hall on 4 August 1885. As a result, a committee of management was set up acting on the Church Code and considered a number of potential Ministers. The Rev Dr Will Scott Frackelton who arrived in Sydney from the United Kingdom in 1885, was appointed as the first Randwick Minister. He was inducted on 23 November at the Randwick Town Hall. The new Minister, supported by the congregation, was convinced that a new church was required and initially the land granted for that purpose in 1857 was put aside in favour of private land in Avoca Street, however, the original grant was eventually taken up with part of the northern allotments being sold as unnecessary and the project for the new church was put in hand. =The selection of the church design= In 1886 the recently arrived English architect, John Sulman, made an offer to the new Randwick Presbyterian Congregation to draw up plans for a church to house the congregation. Sulman had excellent architectural credentials and came from an established and respected architectural practice in England which had designed at least 66 churches in England, many of them combining church schools, for non conformist churches including Presbyterian and Congregational denominations. It is noted that Sulman and his family travelled to Australia on the Orient Line ship RMS Austral in 1885, and it is likely that on this voyage he made the acquaintance of the first resident Minister of the Randwick congregation, the Rev. Will Scott Frackelton. The initial design submitted by Sulman was subsequently published in the report of the Presbyterian Church Annual Meeting of 1886. While it is similar in design to the extant church this initial design was much larger in scale. Sulman subsequently submitted a revised design on 8 October 1888, with his professional practice partner Joseph Porter Power. A short period later a new Building Committee met and accepted Sulman and Power's design on condition that: it was built for A‚Ç§4,000; that the church width be reduced to by six feet; and that it be built of brick with stone dressings instead of stucco on the front facade. =The church design= The church design as accepted by the Randwick Presbyterian Church was essentially a neo-classic design of Baroque derivation having its entrance facade dominated by two tall towers. A perspective of this design published in a number of newspapers is all that is known to remain of the architect's drawings. While the towers displayed in this plan were not undertaken (due to economic considerations) the extant church appears to be consistent with this plan. A newspaper article of the period stated that \\"its internal arrangement which is at once novel and excellent, and will be found to be, so far as its acoustic properties are concerned, one of the best buildings of its class in the colony, whilst the congregation will have from every part an uninterrupted view of the preacher\\". It was also said that seating was provided on the ground floor for 441 and in the gallery for 226, allowing for the accommodation of 667 parishioners. Randwick Presbyterian Church is attributed to John Sulman who designed churches in a number of styles including English Gothic (Springwood); Romanesque (Manly and Woollahra), and was well known for preparing a large number of alternative styles for banks. It is speculated, however, that the final design may be due in part to the influence of the Minister Will Frackleton, who had travelled, preached and studied extensively in the United States of America. Its derivation is also most likely based on the standard Scottish T-Plan Church with galleries, a famous Sydney example being James Barnet's Chalmers Presbyterian Church in Surry Hills. The interior with its gallery is also similar to St Andrew's Presbyterian Church at Evandale and the Pitt Street Congregational Church in Sydney. It has been noted that the first design submitted by Sulman in 1886 bears a striking resemblance to the First Scots Presbyterian Church of Charleston, South Carolina, with its large central portico, twin Baroque towers and a transverse classroom wing at the rear. It is noted that Sulman also travelled widely in Britain and Europe and may have been aware of a similar church built in Glasgow in 1870, being the Govan United Presbyterian Church designed by James Thomson. It is considered that although the Sulman and Power design of the church was not of the usual Gothic revival style favoured at the time, it is related to a school of church architectural design based on neoclassic, particularly Greek Revival and Georgian designs that can be traced back to the churches of the convict architect Francis Greenway. It was of a style not uncommon in Sydney up to that time although the proposed twin towers (not built) were a departure in the design for a suburban parish church. =Sir John Sulman= John Sulman was born on 29 August 1849 at Greenwich, Kent, England, third son of John Sulman, jeweller, and his wife Martha, n√©e Quinton. He was educated at Greenwich Proprietary School and in 1863 passed the Oxford junior examination. After his family moved to Croydon next year, he was articled to Thomas Allom, a London architect; he learned the use of oils and water-colour, and executed perspective drawings for Sir George Gilbert Scott. Following illness, Sulman resumed work in London in 1868. While articled to H. R. Newton, he attended classes at the Architectural Association and at the Royal Academy of Arts, winning the Pugin travelling scholarship in 1871. An associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1872 (fellow, 1883), Sulman designed the Congregational Church at Caterham, Surrey: the first wedding there was his own, to Sarah Clark Redgate on 15 April 1875. They moved to Bromley, Kent. He lectured on applied art and formed the Nineteenth Century Art Society. In Italy in 1882 he contracted typhoid at Naples; two years later Sarah showed signs of tuberculosis. Although president-elect of the Architectural Association, Sulman sold his practice (which had produced over seventy churches and other buildings) and left with his wife and son for Australia, due to his wife's health. Reaching Sydney on 13 August 1885, he paid ¬£3,000 in 1886 next to enter a partnership with C. H. E. Blackmann in Sydney. Some months later Blackmann fled the country with a Sydney barmaid, leaving Sulman liable for his debts. From 1889 to 1908 Sulman practised with Joseph Porter Power. Sulman's commissions included The Armidale School (1889), Women's College, University of Sydney (1890‚Äì94), and Presbyterian churches at Woollahra (1889), Manly (1889‚Äì92) and Randwick (1890) and the Thomas Walker Convalescent Hospital at Concord, designed in Federation free classical style. Always ready to discuss art and architecture, Sulman founded the Palladian Club in 1887 and became an honorary corresponding secretary of the R.I.B.A. He was asked by Aston Webb to \\"clean up\\" the Institute of Architects of New South Wales: Sulman had joined the institute in 1887 and been elected vice- president, but John Horbury Hunt foiled his attempt to become president; Sulman resigned in 1892 and did not rejoin until 1912 when he was again vice- president. In 1887-1912 he also lectured part-time in architecture in the faculty of engineering at the University of Sydney; he visited Britain and the United States of America in 1892 to report on architectural schools. In 1890 A. B. Smith, minister for public works, had convened a \\"secret committee\\" of six architects (including Hunt, W. L. Vernon and Sulman) to investigate complaints that the colonial architect James Barnet had a monopoly on the design of large, and therefore lucrative, public buildings. They recommended that such work be open to competition. As Barnet was to retire, Smith sought to replace him with Sulman, who declined. In October Sulman formed the Parramatta half-squadron of lancers, but resigned his commission as first lieutenant four years later. Sulman's first wife Sarah died in 1888. At St Luke's Anglican Church, Burwood, on 27 April 1893, he married Annie Elizabeth Masefield, the childhood companion of (Dame) Eadith Walker. Annie took up photography and published collections of her studies of Australian wildflowers. Sulman again became seriously ill in 1896 and took his family to Europe. Returning in 1897, he made the cottage he had begun for his parents at Turramurra into a rambling family house, \\"Ingleholme\\". A visit to Paris in 1873 had impressed on Sulman the need for town planning. In 1890 his paper, \\"The laying-out of towns\\", delivered to the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science, advocated the 'spider's web' plan in preference to the grid; he used the motto 'convenience, utility and beauty'; his paper marked the beginning of town planning in Australia as a formal discipline. In 1907 the Daily Telegraph published his series of articles on the need for a plan for Sydney; on eleven occasions he gave evidence before the royal commission for the improvement of the city of Sydney and its suburbs (1908‚Äì09). Many of his proposals are evident in Sydney today: the extension of Martin Place, the location of Circular Quay railway station and the widening of Elizabeth, Oxford and William streets (with a tunnel under King's Cross). He considered Australia's architectural heritage insignificant and at various times recommended the demolition of Hyde Park Barracks, St James' Church, Darlinghurst Gaol, Victoria Barracks and Sydney Hospital. After retiring from practice in 1908, Sulman held influential positions as director of the Daily Telegraph Newspaper Co. Ltd from 1902 (chairman 1922-25), president of the Town Planning Association of New South Wales (1913‚Äì25) and chairman of the Town Planning Advisory Board to the Department of Local Government (1918). At the University of Sydney, he endowed a lectureship in aeronautics, and gave the Anzac memorial bursary (1922) and ¬£2,500 to encourage the teaching of town planning (1926). He was Vernon memorial lecturer in town planning at the university in 1919‚Äì26. A supporter of Walter Burley Griffin's plan for Canberra, Sulman gave evidence at the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in 1915. As chairman of the Federal Capital Advisory Committee (1921‚Äì24), he nonetheless advocated departures from the Griffin plan wherever he saw fit. Sulman was a trustee of the National Art Gallery of New South Wales from 1899 and its President from 1919 - ?? In 1930 he established the annual Sir John Sulman award for architectural merit in New South Wales. Sulman died at North Sydney on 18 August 1934 and was cremated with Presbyterian forms. His second wife and his surviving children endowed the Sir John Sulman prize for genre painting or mural decoration. His estate was sworn for probate at ¬£171,615. Versatile, gifted and energetic, Sulman was forceful and decisive in action and in speech. By turns polished and aggressive, he was seldom deflected from any task. Driven by ambition and a virile ego, he was politically adroit, able to cultivate useful acquaintances to become the central figure of any organization with which he was connected. His taste was essentially conservative (he considered much modern art to be 'awful rubbish'), but his interests ranged from painting to town planning: \\"the former seeks art in small framed spaces, the latter in wide, prettily and properly-planned places\\".Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 12, Melbourne University Press, 1990, pp 137-138 =The construction of the church= The building contract was awarded to the prominent Sydney builder and resident of Randwick, Mr George Gale, who had been responsible for building many projects including works for the noted Melbourne architect, William Pitt, who designed the Princess Theatre and the Rialto Buildings amongst many during Melbourne's building boom. The foundation stone for the church was laid by the Hon. Henry Clarke MP, on 9 March 1889, and the official opening took place on 16 March 1890. Sulman was in the congregation for the service delivered by the Rev Dr Frackleton and the address given by Rev Dr Steel. It was reported that the interior fittings and furniture were provided by Messrs Eaton Brothers and that the total cost of the project was 5,790 Pounds. This amount exceeded the available funds available such that the church had to borrow ‚Ç§2,000 to cover the debts. =Pipe organ= The extant pipe organ was installed in 1903 as a gift of Mrs Jane Fischer in memory of her son Albert Fischer who drowned at Inverell. It replaced the American organ initially purchased for the church. The organ was assembled by W. G. Rendall of Bondi Junction and is thought to contain part of an instrument built by Alfred Monk, of London, in 1854. =The Manse= The Ministers to the Parish resided in rental accommodation until the Manse was completed in 1900. The Federation style manse was designed by a member of the congregation A. A. Lewis and built under the direction of W. Webster. The building cost ‚Ç§1,270. The manse was modified by architects Clark, Gazzard and Partners in 1967 to create two separate residences in order to accommodate both the Minister and the Pastor. =The School Hall= The single-storey church Sunday School which is connected to the church was designed by Mr A. A. Lewis and completed in 1903. It connects with the rear elevation of the church and is aligned with the wall of the church on the Abbey Street boundary. In 1934, the 50-year jubilee of the congregation in Randwick, a second floor for the school hall was proposed, and this was completed in February 1936 by the builders, Elvey and Company. The cost these alterations amounted to 1,809 Pounds. Coogee Boys' Preparatory School A nondenominational Christian independent boys' school opened its doors on 21 July 1914, with 27 students in the single-storey school hall that adjoins the rear of the church. The school's founder and first Headmaster, Mr William Nimmo, chose the Randwick area owing to the large number of boys travelling into the city of Sydney for their education. William Nimmo remained Headmaster until retired in 1965. A second floor was added to the school hall in 1936. =Indonesian congregation= The Rev Clements was instrumental in opening the doors of the church to a wider congregation, hence, in March 1979, the first regular service was held for the Indonesian community. Pastor David Silas was the first preacher in the Indonesian Language Section. The Church is known as the Indonesian Presbyterian Church - Randwick. =Ministers of the Randwick Presbyterian Church= The following individuals have served as ministers of the Randwick Presbyterian Church, or equivalent titles: #Will Scott Frackleton 1885‚Äì1896 #William Gibson Maconochie 1896‚Äì1898 #Charles Henry Talbot 1898‚Äì1922 #William James Grant 1922‚Äì1949 #C. J. Vernon McKeown 1949‚Äì1967 #Douglas Graham Ritchie 1968‚Äì1970 #Stuart John Clements 1971‚Äì1985 #John Lambertus Bracht 1987-1991 #Ronald Sydney Keith 1992-1996 #Conrad A D Hor-Kwong 1998-1999 #Grant Spurgeon Thorp 2000-2011 #Ian Neil Stenhouse 2013‚Äì2019  Description  The Victorian Academic Classical style building consists of three distinct building forms being the centre church structure with splayed southern walls flanked at each end by taller wings, the south wing being the two-storey main entrance and stair towers and the north wing being the three-storey wing containing the vestry and classrooms. The structure consists of load-bearing decorative brickwork in English Bond relieved at the Entrance Wing with sandstone attached columns, carved architraves and pediments to the main windows and doors and string courses, cornice moulds and balustrading at the upper levels. Elsewhere on the other wings, the window architraves, sills and the horizontal mouldings are of painted cement which relieve the face brickwork walls. The ribbed galvanised steel roofing is placed behind horizontal parapets in either pitched or skillion roof forms. At the northeastern corner of the building is a later two-storey stair tower and entrance which links with the school addition. The rear or north elevation of the church is treated in a simple way with windows and doors and the steel stairways attached for fire escape purposes. = Condition = As at 19 October 2006, the building is in sound condition, though the stonework on the southern facade has generally weathered with localised erosion and friable stone. The church facade and interior fabric demonstrates a high degree of integrity. = Modifications and dates = *March 1890 - Randwick Presbyterian Church opened. *1900 - Detached Manse designed by of A. A. Lewis, completed under the direction of W. Webster. *1903 - Pipe organ fitted by W. G. Rendall and single-storey Sunday School Hall designed by A. A. Lewis completed. *1911 - Church records indicate that the pipe organ was reconstructed and that repairs were carried out to the church, manse and fence. *1914 - Coogee Boys' Preparatory School opened in the single- storey church hall. *1936 - First-floor addition to School Hall designed by (?) was completed by the builders Elvey & Co. *1962 - Toilet building completed to the rear of the church. *1967 - A kitchen an bathroom were added to the Manse in 1967 so that the building could be divided into two residences, in order to accommodate both the Minister and the Pastor. In addition, the front porch was partly screened. These works were performed to the designs of architects Clark, Gazzard and Partners. *1983 - External staircases fitted to Church, Manse and School to comply with fire regulations. These works were designed by Architects Finn & McKinley Pty Ltd. The original fence around the church was a timber picket fence as evidenced by a number of early photographs. It is not known when the fence was removed or when the present main entrance steps with flanking brick garden beds were built. As built it was reported that the main church roof was of slate but this has subsequently been replaced by a metal roof. In the years after World War II, the present stained glass windows were installed, possibly replacing plain glass windows.  Heritage listing  The Randwick Presbyterian Church is of State significance for its association with the influential English Architect, Sir John Sulman (1849‚Äì1934). Ecclesiastical architecture in New South Wales in the 19th century was predominantly designed in the Gothic Revival and Romanesque Revival styles, however, the landmark Randwick Presbyterian Church represents a significant departure from these prevailing styles. It is one of only a small number of churches designed in the Victorian Academic Classical style, and the only example of the prominent architectural firm Sulman and Power's ecclesiastical architecture designed in this particular idiom. The church which was the first designed by Sir John Sulman in his Australian practice was originally conceived in 1886, revised in 1888 and completed in 1890. Though incomplete (the two towers were never built) it demonstrates the innovation of adapting ecclesiastical architecture to the climatic conditions of Sydney. The highly intact church interior designed in the form of a Greek theatre is considered to be Sir John Sulman's finest non-Gothic church interior, and one of the best non-Gothic church interiors in NSW. Randwick Presbyterian Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 8 May 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Randwick Presbyterian Church is of local significance for its ability to demonstrate: the establishment of the Presbyterian church in the municipality of Randwick from 1884; the spread of Presbyterianism in the suburbs of Sydney; and the architectural presence that was considered appropriate by the church during this period in NSW. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Randwick Presbyterian Church is of State significance for its association with the influential English born architect Sir John Sulman (1849‚Äì1934). The church designed by Sulman in the Victorian Academic Classical style represents a rare departure from the Gothic Revival and Romanesque Revival style churches that prevailed in 19th century New South Wales. In addition, the Randwick Presbyterian Church is considered to be the first church designed by Sulman in NSW. Sulman, whose practice in England had produced over seventy churches and other buildings, arrived in Australia with his family in late 1885. Sulman initially entered into a short-lived partnership with C. H. E. Blackman in 1886 and later formed a highly successful partnership with the architect Joseph Porter Power, from 1889‚Äì1908, under the title of Sulman Power Architects. Sulman became a highly influential figure in NSW in matters of architecture and town planning, giving evidence to Royal Commissions, providing advice to NSW Government Ministers, and writing at length on town planning. Many of his proposals are evident in Sydney today: the extension of Martin Place, the location of Circular Quay railway station and the widening of Elizabeth, Oxford and William streets. Sulman considered Australia's architectural heritage insignificant and at various times recommended the demolition of Hyde Park Barracks, St James's Church, Darlinghurst Gaol, Victoria Barracks and Sydney Hospital. Sulman founded the Palladian Club in 1887 and became an honorary corresponding secretary of the R.I.B.A. In the same year he was elected vice-president of the Institute of Architects (NSW), however, his attempts to become president were thwarted by the controversial architect J. Horbury Hunt and he resigned in 1892, rejoining in 1912. Between 1887‚Äì1912 he also lectured in architecture in the faculty of engineering at the University of Sydney. After retiring in 1908, Sulman held influential positions as director of the Daily Telegraph Newspaper Co. Ltd from 1902 (chairman 1922‚Äì25), president of the Town Planning Association of New South Wales (1913‚Äì25) and chairman of the Town Planning Advisory Board to the Department of Local Government (1918). He was the Vernon Memorial Lecturer in town planning at the University of Sydney 1919‚Äì26. Sulman was also a trustee from 1899 (president from 1919) of the National Art Gallery of New South Wales. In 1930 he established the annual Sir John Sulman award for architectural merit in New South Wales. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Randwick Presbyterian Church is of State significance as an aesthetically distinctive and highly intact ecclesiastical example of the Victorian Academic Classical style in NSW. The church interior designed in the form of a Greek theatre is considered to be Sir John Sulman's finest non-Gothic church interior, and one of the best non- Gothic church interiors in NSW. The imposing two storey brick and stone building located at a prominent intersection on one of the highest points of Randwick represents a significant departure from the dominant Gothic Revival and Romanesque Revival ecclesiastical architecture of 19th century NSW. The Randwick Presbyterian Church is significantly the only example of a Victorian Academic Classical style church designed by the firm of Sulman and Power Architects. Furthermore, it is considered to be the first church designed by Sir John Sulman in his Australian practice. The church designed by Sulman though incomplete (the two towers were never built) demonstrates the innovation of adapting ecclesiastical architecture to the climatic conditions of Sydney. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Randwick Presbyterian Church possesses local social significance to the Presbyterian community of the Randwick municipality and past students of the Coogee Boys' Preparatory School. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Randwick Presbyterian Church is of State significance as an important reference site demonstrating the adaption of European ecclesiastical architecture to the climate of the Southern Hemisphere. Sir John Sulman (1849‚Äì1934) who is attributed with the design of the church was a proponent of building churches in keeping with Sydney's climate. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The c.1890 Randwick Presbyterian Church is of State significance as one of only a very small group of Victorian Academic Classical styled churches in New South Wales, and the only example of the prominent architectural firm Sulman and Power's ecclesiastical architecture designed in this particular idiom. Ecclesiastical architecture in New South Wales in the 19th century was predominantly designed in the Gothic Revival and Romanesque Revival styles, and the Randwick Presbyterian Church represents a significant departure from these prevailing styles. The church designed by the English architect Sir John Sulman (1849‚Äì1934) was originally conceived in 1886 and subsequently revised in 1888. It is considered to be the first church designed by Sulman in his Australian practice. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Randwick Presbyterian Church is representative of the architecturally impressive churches built by the Presbyterian Church in the late 19th century in the suburbs of Sydney.

The event took place on October 8, 2018 at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan in Tokyo. This was the seventh event under the King of Pro-Wrestling branding. Storylines King of Pro-Wrestling will feature professional wrestling matches that involve different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The main event of King of Pro-Wrestling will be a three-way match for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. At Fighting Spirit Unleashed, Kenny Omega decided his next opponent for the championship will be Kota Ibushi, his tag partner in the Golden‚òÜLovers. This is due to Ibushi beating Omega in the 2018 G1 Climax. Immediately after the announcement, IWGP United States Champion and Bullet Club stablemate Cody stated he wanted to help both of them out and lessen the burden on them and asked for a triple threat match involving him. Omega granted his wish. This is only the third time in NJPW history that the IWGP Heavyweight Championship will be defended in a three-way match. At the 2018 G1 Climax, Hiroshi Tanahashi won the Tokyo Dome IWGP Heavyweight Championship challenge rights certificate for the right to challenge for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship at Wrestle Kingdom 13. Tanahashi successfully defended the certificate against Kazuchika Okada at Destruction in Kobe. However, Chaos stablemate Jay White with the help of Okada's former manager Gedo, attacked both Tanahashi and Okada after the match; turning heel. Gedo claimed that the certificate belongs to White not Tanahashi nor Okada as White defeated both of them at the G1 Climax, setting up a match between Tanahasi and White for the Tokyo Dome IWGP Heavyweight Championship challenge rights certificate at King of Pro-Wrestling. On October 2, Chaos member Will Ospreay, tweeted the names of current Chaos members; White and Gedo's names were not included, indicating that they have left the stable. At G1 Special in San Francisco Hiromu Takahashi successfully defended his IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Dragon Lee. However, during the match, Hiromu injured his neck and was forced to relinquish the championship. The news led to NJPW announcing a four-man single-elimination tournament to crown a new champion. At Destruction in Kobe 2018, Kushida defeated Bushi, and at Fighting Spirit Unleashed, Marty Scurll defeated Will Ospreay. Kushida and Scurll will now face off at King of Pro-Wrestling for the vacant IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship. On October 1, Los Ingobernables de Japon released a video on New Japan's YouTube page. In it, Tetsuya Naito made it clear that the faction will wait for member Hiromu Takahashi to return. But, Naito made a surprise announcement, saying \\"5, not 4 of us will wait for Hiromu's return\\" and \\"On October 8, we will introduce our new 'pareja'\\", indicating that a new member of Los Ingobernables de Japon will debut at King of Pro-Wrestling. Other matches at King of Pro-Wrestling include an IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship match between Suzuki-gun (El Desperado and Yoshinobu Kanemaru) and the team of Jyushin Thunder Liger and Tiger Mask IV and a singles match between Suzuki-gun's Zack Sabre Jr. and Los Ingobernables de Japon's EVIL.

Early life  Megugorac was born in Santa Monica, California, on February 5, 1928. In his early teens, he began working on cars, starting before he got his driver's license; he joined the Low Flyers Racing Club whose members included Stu Hilborn, Jack Engle, George Barris, and Jack McGrath. He spent 18 months with the American occupation forces in Japan after World War II as a mechanic's instructor, and returned to settle in Los Angeles, setting up a garage there.  Customizing career  In the 1960s, Megugorac and brother-in-law Carl Riggen co-founded Riggen Slot Cars to capitalize on the fad at the time; the company became one of the most successful makers of slot cars. In the 1960s, he opened Magoo's Street Rods in Canoga Park, California; he would be aided by his (later) wife, Lois, who did upholstery work. Megugorac built \\"some of rodding's most prominent hot rods\\", including a number of entries for the Grand National Roadster Show at Oakland, among them the winning car of the 1979 America's Most Beautiful Roadster trophy. Known as Deucari, and built for Brian Burnett, this was a highboy Deuce powered by a Ferrari V-12, and is still running. Megugorac provided the first-ever Goodguys giveaway car, a '29 roadster, and built early giveaway cars for the National Street Rod Association. Megugorac customized almost all aspects of his cars, including chassis fabrication, engine building, body work, and custom paint, although he left upholstery to his wife. Megugorac focused on getting the details correct when car customizing, and had a reputation for building cars that had \\"bomb-proof reliability\\" and \\"could be driven anywhere, anytime\\". \\"Lil' John\\" Buttera said that if he wanted a custom car to actually drive, he would go to Megugorac. Many of Megugorac's project cars were featured in major magazines, including Hot Rod, Rod & Custom, Street Rodder, and others. Megugorac was named to Darryl Starbird's National Rod & Custom Hall of Fame. Among his admirers, and a longtime friend, was Tom Medley, creator of Stroker McGurk, who drove a signature '29 highboy roadster. \\"Magoo builds really bitchin' '29s,\\" Medley once said. \\"Stroker would have approved!\\"  Personal life  Megugorac met Lois Riggen, Carl Riggen's sister, in Los Angeles in the 1940s. They were married for 40 years and had two sons. Megugorac died on January 13, 2016, in Phoenix, Arizona, age 87.

Early life and family Hoare was born on 18 July 1945 to Reginald Hoare, a Norfolk landowner, soldier, and official in the British War Office. He was educated at Eton College and then, after travels in Persia, at the Sorbonne in Paris. Career In 1967, he joined Christie's in London where he was initially charged with overseeing Russian art. After spotting some carpets left lying in a corridor and recognising them as Persian, Oliver used them as the basis of a successful auction, which led to the launch of the Islamic Art Department, the first of its kind in a major auction house. He left Christie's in 1975 and opened Ahuan, a gallery in Pimlico, in partnership with David Sulzberger. As a private dealer, Oliver worked with most of the Islamic art collectors and museums throughout the Middle East, as well as in Europe, the US and Japan. In the 1970s and 1980s, he was instrumental in building the collection of Sheikh Nasser Sabah al-Ahmed and his wife Sheikha Hussah Sabah al-Salem al-Sabah, for the Kuwait National Museum, including the acquisition of Islamic art from the legendary collection of Comtesse de Behague. He advised the Nuhad Es-Said Collection in Beirut, one of the finest groups of Islamic metalwork in private hands, and in the 1990s he started working as an advisor to Sheikh Saud bin Mohammed Al-Thani of Qatar, the greatest collector of his time, as they worked for over a decade on building museum collections for Qatar. The Qatar Museum spent $1 billion on Islamic art during this time. This project came to a halt when the sheikh was placed under house arrest in 2005 amid accusations of financial misappropriation; the charges were later dismissed, but not before Hoare was caught in the confusion. In 1994, he negotiated the return to Iran of part of a 16th century Persian manuscript, the Houghton Shahnameh (the most important illustrated manuscript ever created in Persia) in exchange for Willem de Kooning's Woman III which had been in Iran since that country's Islamic revolution. The Shahnama, or \\"Book of Kings,\\" was a 10th century verse epic by Persian poet Firdausi chronicling the mythological adventures of Persia's pre-Islamic rulers. At some time around the turn of the 20th century, the Shahnama mysteriously disappeared from Istanbul and in 1903 resurfaced in the possession of Baron Edmond de Rothschild. In 1959, Arthur Houghton Jr. acquired it and 1964 he contacted Oliver to sell the manuscript and Oliver negotiated its repatriation to Iran. The objects were exchanged at Vienna airport. In 2012, Hoare hosted a small exhibition of items from his personal cabinet of curiosities at Jean-Claude Ciancimino's gallery in Pimlico. He returned in 2015 with a much larger edition at 33 Fitzroy Square, former home of the Omega Workshops. Entitled Every Object Tells a Story, it was the first time in decades that he had held a major exhibition and it included an eclectic array of objects ranging from antiquities to dodo bones and erotic scrimshaw. It was accompanied by a catalogue in which he practiced his love of storytelling with entertaining and often semi-autobiographical notes, one of which was to his former friend and client, the late Sheikh Saud al-Thani of Qatar, in which he gave the \\"other account\\" of the accusations which had seen the prince placed under house arrest. \\"The story of this disaster needs to be told, because there are two different versions.\\" Another exhibition took place in 2017, this time at Sir John Lavery's old studio in Cromwell Place where his choice of objects ranged from unicorn horns to Bactrian treasures. It gave him a chance to tell stories and gave visitors another opportunity to experience Oliver Hoare, a private dealer with a very public persona, and an unquenchable thirst for new adventures.Oliver Hoare obituary. The Times, 13 September 2018. Retrieved 16 September 2018. Personal life In 1976, he married Diane de Waldner de Freundstein, who came from a wealthy French oil family. Diane's mother was Baroness Louise de Waldner, a \\"close friend\\" of the British Queen Mother. Hoare and his wife had three children: Tristan, Damian and Olivia. In the 1990s, he had an affair with Diana, Princess of Wales. One night, Hoare was found by a policeman hiding behind a potted tree smoking a cigar after the fire alarm sounded at Kensington Palace where Diana had her apartment. On another occasion, he was said to have been seen entering the boot of Diana's car. Death Hoare died of cancer on 23 August 2018.

History The Salisbury Infirmary had a long history as a hospital. The first Lord Feversham, who died in 1763, left a sum of ¬£500 towards the establishment of a county hospital and at a general meeting on 23 September 1766 a committee was established. The Earl of Pembroke was nominated as visitor, the Earl of Radnor as president, and Robert Cooper as treasurer, while Dr Henry Hele and Dr Jacob were appointed as physicians.Richard Hoare, History of Modern Wiltshire, Volume VI, City of Salisbury (ed. Benson and Hatcher), London 1843 A site was purchased and the existing houses on it were opened for the reception of patients on 2 May 1767. Meanwhile, plans were drawn up by John Wood, the Younger of Bath for a new four-storey building on the site with over 100 beds. When the new red-brick building was completed and opened in 1771, the existing houses were removed. The hospital was later much enlarged, with a wing added on one side in 1845 and the other side in 1869, and further 20th-century extensions. A new outpatients department, dedicated to T. E. Lawrence, the British military officer, was opened in 1936. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948. The building was recorded as Grade II listed in 1972, under the name General Infirmary. It was in the intensive care unit at the Infirmary that the Thin Lizzy singer Phil Lynott died from an alcohol and drugs related illness in January 1986. After services transferred to the Salisbury District Hospital in 1991 the Infirmary closed in 1993. The building was converted for residential use in 1997.

CadZZilla attracted considerable attention. Hot Rods Gray Baskerville called CadZZilla \\"the most incredible transformation he'd ever witnessed\\", and in their \\"History of Hot Rods & Customs\\" the auto editors of Consumer Guide praised it as \\"the first really new type of custom since the heyday of the 1950s\\".

The very first sketches were done on a bar napkin. The top was chopped. The hood and front fenders were sectioned and combined into a tilt nose. Headlights were frenched and late-model Cadillac taillights frenched into the rear fins. The front bumper is fitted with high-mounted dagmars, with a Moon tank between them in the grille opening.

She is a powerful New York City-based editor-in-chief of the fictional fashion magazine Runway. She is known as much for her icy demeanor and diva attitude as for her outstanding power within the fashion world.  Fictional biography  Miranda Priestly was born Miriam Princhek in the East End of London in October 1949. Her family members were poor but devout orthodox Jews. The family relied on the community for support, because her father worked odd jobs occasionally and her mother died in childbirth. Miriam's grandmother moved in with the family to assist in raising the children. Miriam saved the small bills that her siblings would give her and worked as an assistant to a British designer. She made a name for herself in London's fashion world and studied French at night and was made junior editor of the Chic magazine in Paris. When she was twenty-four Miriam changed her name to Miranda Priestly and replaced her rough accent with a sophisticated one. Miranda spent ten years at French Runway before Elias-Clark transferred her to American Runway. She, her twin daughters, and her husband moved to a penthouse apartment on Fifth Avenue and 76th Street. She is the editor-in-chief of Runway, a very chic and influential fashion magazine published by the Elias-Clark company. She is known for wearing a white Herm√®s scarf in her everyday outfit and treating her subordinates in a manner that borders on emotional and psychological abuse. While she reminds employees \\"a million girls would kill for this job\\", Priestly's cruel treatment of staff causes a high turnover rate among personal assistants; the focus of her characterization in the book and the film being her newest assistant, recent journalism graduate Andrea Sachs. Priestly has twin daughters (from her second of three husbands), Caroline and Cassidy, who one review suggested \\"look like extras from The Omen.\\"Peter Howell, \\"The devil in Ms. Streep\\", Toronto Star, Toronto ON: Torstar, 30 June 2006. Page C3, 6 columns. In the film version, her past is not mentioned at all. Characterization Miranda Priestly's personality comes in ranking as an ENTJ according to the Myers‚ÄìBriggs Type Indicator.https://bookriot.com/2018/09/28/which-literary-heroine-shares-your- personality-type/ Her personage has been reviewed as 'Bossy' and 'Diva', referring her as an arrogant, megalomaniac and egomaniac person. Comparisons of the character Anna Wintour, one of the celebrities who have constantly been compared and often believed to have been based on. =Novel= Weisberger denies that Miranda Priestly is modeled on Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, saying in the publicity material for the bookWeisberger, Lauren; Q and A; randomhouse.com; retrieved September 3, 2006. that her antics and demands are partially fictional and partially a composite of actual experiences she and her friends had in their first jobs, however in the sequel the writer describes Miranda at a basketball game with Rafael Nadal (a reference to Wintour‚Äôs friendship with Roger Federer) and mentions that she‚Äôs now the editorial director of the whole of Runway‚Äôs parent company (a reference to Wintour's role of Cond√© Nast artistic director). =Film= In the film she is a more sympathetic character than portrayed in the book. Whilst she remains just as ruthless and manipulative as she was in the book she is seen in a few moments of vulnerability three quarters of the way into the film in she confides to Andrea her distress about her failing marriage and the effect she is worried it will have on her daughters. The film incarnation of Priestly also speaks with an American accent, which strongly suggests the film character is not a Briton as portrayed in the novel. Most, if not all reviews and articles of the movie made reference to Wintour. Nicknamed \\"Nuclear Wintour\\", Anna has been known to possess most of the same traits as Priestly, although she has shown more redeeming traits. Streep has told multiple reporters that she did not personally base her portrayal on Wintour, but instead on men she has known; Streep actually didn't meet Wintour until a pre- release screening of the movie. Other inspirations for Streep's portrayal include Martha Stewart and the ghost of Joan Crawford from Mommie Dearest.. Nearly all critics of the film raved about Meryl Streep's performance as the cold, calculating Miranda Priestly. Meryl Streep received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress but lost to Helen Mirren in The Queen. It was Streep's 14th nomination, furthering her impressive record. Streep received a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy for her portrayal of Priestly, that being her sixth Golden Globe. Critical reception Streep's performance was praised for making an extremely unsympathetic character far more complex than she had been in the novel. \\"With her silver hair and pale skin, her whispery diction as perfect as her posture, Ms. Streep's Miranda inspires both terror and a measure of awe,\\" wrote A. O. Scott in The New York Times. \\"No longer simply the incarnation of evil, she is now a vision of aristocratic, purposeful and surprisingly human grace.\\" Kyle Smith agreed at the New York Post: \\"The snaky Streep wisely chooses not to imitate Vogue editrix Anna Wintour, the inspiration for the book, but creates her own surprisingly believable character.\\" Liz Jones, former editor of British Marie Claire, wrote that the movie was \\"a chilling reminder of the most surreal three years of my life.\\" The only detail she found inaccurate was the absence of flowers in Miranda's Paris hotel room‚Äîduring her tenure as editor, her rooms there or in Milan received so many flowers from designers that she thought she \\"had died prematurely.\\" She personally vouched for Miranda's personality: \\"It took only a few weeks in the job for me to mutate into that strangely exotic and spoilt creature: the magazine maven, whose every whim, like those of Miranda ... must be pandered to.\\" Janet Brennan Croft of the University of Oklahoma reads the movie as a modern retelling of the Psyche myth, with Miranda in the role of Aphrodite, in which the character matures under the tutelage of an older female who at first seems purely to be tormenting her. \\"This authoritative female figure may even appear to be an enemy, at least at times, but actually mentors and guides [Psyche]'s growth into full participation in society.\\" She compares the seemingly pointless tasks Miranda assigns Andy with those Aphrodite requests of Psyche: \\"By working through the conflict, the daughter/mentee also reaches a healthy balance of independence from and respect or love for the mother/mentor.\\" Impact and legacy In May 2007, the popular American soap opera General Hospital introduced a new character Kate Howard patterned after the character of Miranda Priestly. Kate is much like Miranda, the only noticeable difference being age. Later that year, the \\"Money\\" episode of the US version of The Office began with Michael Scott (Steve Carell), who had just been watching the film, yelling \\"Steak!\\" and \\"Get me Armani!\\" to the Dunder-Mifflin receptionist, Pam. On Episode 18 Season 14 of the Keeping Up With the Kardashians Kris Jenner dressed as Miranda, channeling her 'Boss Lady' persona. On the film's 10th anniversary, Alyssa Rosenberg wrote in The Washington Post that Miranda anticipated female antiheroines of popular television series of the later 2000s and 2010s such as Scandal's Olivia Pope and Cersei Lannister in Game of Thrones. Like them, she observes, Miranda competently assumes a position of authority often held by male characters, despite her moral failings, that she must defend against attempts to use her personal life to remove her from it, to \\"prov[e], as a creature of sentiment, that she never belonged there in the first place.\\" In doing so, however successfully to herself and others, \\"she has zipped herself into a life as regimented and limited as a skintight pencil skirt.\\" Variety' observed that \\"[the characterization] showed Hollywood that it was never wise to underestimate a strong woman's worth.\\" In 2020, The Huffington Posts Monica Torres wrote about how much more she appreciated Miranda upon watching the film for the first time since her teens. Then, she had identified strongly with Andrea and hated Miranda. \\"But after rewatching as a working adult, I'm struck to find I have a much more complex understanding of [her], and of how many missteps her Runway staff take in their careers.\\" Despite Andrea's dramatic break with her, Torres notes, Miranda still gives her a favorable job recommendation at the end. \\"That's better than most people would do for an employee who burnt a bridge!\\" References External links * Miranda Priestly role was the 14th nomination of Meryl Streep to the Academy Awards Comedy film characters Fictional businesspeople Fictional characters from New York City Fictional American people Fictional immigrants to the United States Fictional magazine editors Fictional English people ","title":"Miranda Priestly"},{"id":"58497723","text":"Mir Najaf Ali Khan is a grandson of the last Nizam of Hyderabad, Mir Osman Ali Khan.

The former post office was designed by Walter Liberty Vernon in his capacity as NSW Government Architect and was built from 1897 to 1898 by W. B. Chessell. It is also known as Randwick Post Office (former) and Jubilee Fountain. The property is owned by Australia Post (Federal Government). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 23 June 2000.  History  =Indigenous history= Pre-1780s the local Aboriginal people in the area used the site for fishing and cultural activities - rock engravings, grinding grooves and middens remain in evidence. In 1789 Governor Arthur Phillip referred to \\"a long bay\\", which became known as Long Bay. Aboriginal people are believed to have inhabited the Sydney region for at least 20,000 years.Turbet, 2001. The population of Aboriginal people between Palm Beach and Botany Bay in 1788 has been estimated to have been 1500. Those living south of Port Jackson to Botany Bay were the Cadigal people who spoke Dharug,Randwick Library webpage, 2003. while the local clan name of Maroubra people was \\"Muru- ora-dial\\".City of Sydney webpage, 2003. By the mid nineteenth century the traditional owners of this land had typically either moved inland in search of food and shelter, or had died as the result of European disease or confrontation with British colonisers. =Colonial history= One of the earliest land grants in this area was made in 1824 to Captain Francis Marsh, who received bounded by the present Botany and High Streets, Alison and Belmore Roads. In 1839 William Newcombe acquired the land north-west of the present town hall in Avoca Street. Randwick takes its name from the town of Randwick, Gloucestershire, England. The name was suggested by Simeon Pearce (1821‚Äì86) and his brother James. Simeon was born in the English Randwick and the brothers were responsible for the early development of both Randwick and its neighbour, Coogee. Simeon had come to the colony in 1841as a 21 year old surveyor. He built his Blenheim House on the he bought from Marsh, and called his property \\"Randwick\\". The brothers bought and sold land profitably in the area and elsewhere. Simeon campaigned for construction of a road from the city to Coogee (achieved in 1853) and promoted the incorporation of the suburb. Pearce sought construction of a church modelled on the church of St. John in his birthplace. In 1857 the first St Jude's stood on the site of the present post office, at the corner of the present Alison Road and Avoca Street.Pollen & Healy, 1988. Randwick was slow to progress. The village was isolated from Sydney by swamps and sandhills, and although a horse-bus was operated by a man named Grice from the late 1850s, the journey was more a test of nerves than a pleasure jaunt. Wind blew sand over the track, and the bus sometimes became bogged, so that passengers had to get out and push it free. From its early days Randwick had a divided society. The wealthy lived elegantly in large houses built when Pearce promoted Randwick and Coogee as a fashionable area. But the market gardens, orchards and piggeries that continued alongside the large estates were the lot of the working class. Even on the later estates that became racing empires, many jockeys and stablehands lived in huts or even under canvas. An even poorer group were the immigrants who existed on the periphery of Randwick in a place called Irishtown, in the area now known as The Spot, around the junction of St.Paul's Street and Perouse Road. Here families lived in makeshift houses, taking on the most menial tasks in their struggle to survive. In 1858 when the NSW Government passed the Municipalities Act, enabling formation of municipal districts empowered to collect rates and borrow money to improve their suburb, Randwick was the first suburb to apply for the status of a municipality. It was approved in February 1859, and its first Council was elected in March 1859. =Establishment of a post office= In April 1859 a number of residents of Randwick petitioned the Postmaster General for the opening of the mail service to the locality and establishment of a post office in Randwick. Thus, the first mail service to Randwick began in 1859, with a local store owner, John Grice, acting as the postmaster from his store and inn in Avoca Street. In April 1887 Randwick Municipal Council decided to apply to have a purpose-built post office erected in Randwick. Following inspection of a number of sites, a portion of Church Land at the corner of Alison Road and Avoca Street was secured at a cost of ¬£30 per square foot. The land was resumed in April 1891, with a total cost of ¬£4,137 being paid. Tenders for construction of the building were called for in 1897, and WB Chessell was the successful tenderer. Work then began to a design by Walter Liberty Vernon, the New South Wales Government Architect. The Federation Free Classical style office was opened on 23 March 1898. The new building comprised a general office and vestibule occupying 38 ft by 37 ft, which included a postmaster's room and a telephone room. The postmaster's private residence comprised two living rooms, five bedrooms and a bathroom.  Description  Randwick Post Office is a two-storey dark red double brick building of stretcher bond construction, in Free Classical style, with tuck pointed ashlar sandstone facing to street facades up to first floor balustrade level. It has a predominantly hipped, complex terracotta shingled roof, fanned over the eastern faceted bay, with a crowning louvred gablet at the centre. Two brick and sandstone chimneys with terracotta pots penetrate at the north and south sides of the main building, with a third to the northern single-storey section. There are pediments over the south and east stone mullioned windows on the ground floor, with an arcade to Alison Road and a continuous dentilled string course running through the pediment base level. There is scroll detailing below the leadlight oculus to the eastern facade and downpipes have been chased into the sandstone to the southern facade. Some segments of the pediment to the south facade have been replaced. The roofline, with shaped rafter ends continues over the first-floor balcony, which is partially enclosed at the western end of the south side. The balcony roof is supported by squat brick and sandstone pillars, the walls have been rough cast rendered and painted cream and it has a bituminous floor covering.Andrew Ward & Associates and Clive Lucas Stapleton and Associates, 2000 = Condition = As at 22 June 2000, The Post Office is in generally good condition and appears largely structurally intact.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004.  History  Cockatoo Island became a gaol in 1839, following advice by NSW Governor George Gipps to the British Secretary of State for the Colonies that convicts would be sent to the island after the closure of the Norfolk Island convict establishment. The convict precinct (Prison Barracks Precinct) was built over several years. Quarrying of grain silos (see below, and also Biloela House) was one of the early convict activities. In order to service Royal Navy ships, the Fitzroy Dock was built on the island and completed in 1857. Cockatoo Island Dockyard became the major government dockyard in Australia. In 1869 prisoners were transferred from the island to Darlinghurst, and the prison buildings became an industrial school for girls and a reformatory from 1871. The dockyard area was now separated from this institutional area on the top of the island by a fence. Following the departure of the females in 1888, prisoners were again sent to the island, and the gaol function continued until about 1909. Meanwhile, the dockyard function expanded, and the Sutherland Dock was built in 1890. The New South Wales Public Works Department declared Cockatoo the state dockyard. Following Federation, in 1913 Cockatoo became the Commonwealth Dockyard, and the island, both through ship-building and servicing, played an important role both in the development of the Royal Australian Navy and during the First World War. The former prison buildings were now used for offices. From 1933 the dockyard was leased from the Australian Government by the Cockatoo Docks & Engineering Company and the island played a very significant role during the Second World War. After the war the dockyard (now known as Vickers) continued, and submarine facilities were introduced. The dockyard closed in 1992, and some demolition took place. Sale of the island was proposed. The island is now vested in the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. Due to the uncertain grain supplies available in the early colony of NSW, Governor Gipps in 1839 decided to embark on a silo construction program on Cockatoo Island. In this way grain could be stored for future use. The silos, designed by Commanding Royal Engineer Colonel George Barney (who played a significant role in the colony), were excavated into the island's sandstone rock by convict work gangs and, being well sealed, the silos were weevil-free. By November 1840 20,000 bushels of wheat were stored in the completed silos, and other silos were underway. Gipps hoped to increase storage up to 100,000 bushels if the low price of wheat then prevailing continued. Over twenty silos were eventually quarried into the sandstone of Cockatoo. However, as grain storage (and hence regulation of the market) was at odds with Britain's subsequent free market policies, Gipps was instructed to sell the grain. Later, either in the 1870s or the early 1880s, the silos were re-used for water storage purposes. Some of the silos were subsequently destroyed by building construction. The surviving silos on the Island are believed to be the only group of convict-cut rock silos in the nation. The other major group of convict constructed underground silos are located on Norfolk Island, but these are cut into the earth.  Description  The Underground Grain Silos are about 65m south-east of Biloela and immediately between the cottage marked Robb (Clerk of Petty Sessions Cottage) and the cliff, Cockatoo Island, Sydney Harbour. This group of silos, sited on the crown of the Island, consists of three complete and two half (the half ones were \\"halved\\" by excavation of the cliff face during the Second World War). The perfectly symmetrical silos are bottle-shaped, and an incision on the surface of the rock indicates the diameter of the silo below ground. The mouth is square and provided with a lip to exclude water; there is also a metal plate over the mouth. The \\"bottle\\" is circular in plan and approaching 5.5 metres in diameter. The silos held from 3000 to 5000 bushels of grain each. Visible evidence of thirteen silos remains on the island (the other silos are near Biloela House). = Condition = As at May 2001, the intact silos are understood to be in good condition.  Heritage listing  The Underground Grain Silos were listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Excavated during 1839-40, the grain silos are historically highly significant for their direct association with the convict era in New South Wales. They are also associated, as water storage facilities, with the other phases of Cockatoo Island's history, when the island was used as an industrial school and as a major government shipyard. Further, the silos reflect aspects of food supply and government administration in the early years of the colony. Criterion B: Rarity The silos on the island are believed to be the only major group of convict-cut rock silos in Australia. Criterion F: Technical achievement The silos are finely excavated and reflect a high degree of stonemasonry skills on the part of their builders. Criterion H: Significant people The silos also have significance for their association with Colonel George Barney, who played a notable engineering role in colonial NSW for a number of years.

Therefore there are 10 paper mills with 50 workers and a product of 22377 fl. of which for 2463fl. go abroad again.\\"Philip Heffner: Bericht der k√∂niglichen Landesdirektion in W√ºrzburg an die kgl. Hofkommission √ºber das Etatsjahr 1814/15. Published in: Anton Chroust: Dem W√ºrzburger Lande. Zur Jahrundertfeier seiner Vereinigung mit dem K√∂nigreich Bayern. W√ºrzburg 1914, p. 127. Until the middle of the 19th century, rags and clothes from linen, hemp or cotton were used as pulp material for making paper, which were collected by rag pickers and sorted, washed and shredded in the paper mill. In order to ensure the supply of the coveted raw material, rags export prohibitions were issued. On the other hand, the processing of unsanitary textile waste posed a threat to mill workers suffering from infectious diseases such as anthrax, typhus or cholera. In particular, the health of women engaged in rag sorting was at risk. Therefore, infected textiles should be incinerated in accordance with a sanitary regulation, although this was associated with a reduction in the supply of raw materials.Anton Chroust: W√ºrzburger Lande. Zur Jahrhundertfeier seiner Vereinigung mit dem K√∂nigreich Bayern. W√ºrzburg 1914, p. 127 :\\"The export of the rags is prohibited by law. One should, therefore, think that there is enough material inland, without the necessity of bringing in from abroad. However, many rags are used as fertilizers and are therefore removed from the paper mills; Also, under more stringent supervision of the health police, many old burlap cloths and clothing are being burned to lessen the contagion that was brought to the paper mills. For the same reason but should also be kept on the introduction of rags from abroad the strictest supervision.\\" The papers produced were still handmade at the time. In 1823, Leinzigers son Conrad set up a sales office in W√ºrzburg and offered \\"all sorts\\" of Homburger \\"paper products for extremely cheap prices in best quality bale, crack and book way for sale\\".Intelligenzblatt f√ºr Unterfranken und Aschaffenburg des K√∂nigreichs Bayern, p. 504. A commercial note book (\\"Calculationsbuch\\") of Johann Follmer, the subsequent owner of the paper mill, is preserved, which dates from 1853 \\"Calculationsbuch\\" and provides information about the paper qualities produced. It lists writing and printing papers of various qualities, packaging papers and also tobacco paper. = Building, mill race and mill wheel = The building of the paper mill, which dates back to 1807, was built as a two- storey two-winged building in half-timbered construction above a high basement floor. It contains also the entrance to the museum. The main building is equipped with a three-level hipped roof, whereby the windows to the two dry floors are located between the individual roof steps. The side wing is equipped with a pagoda roof. The age of the woodwork used for the truss using was assessed by the radiocarbon method and shows that it originated from an older mill. The outbuilding from the 19th century, a two-storey quarry stone construction with sandstone framing and pitched roof serves today as a venue for celebrations. In addition, there are changing exhibitions. Upstairs, a covered passageway leads to the main building. The upper mill-ditch fed by the spring dates from the beginning of the 19th century. It ends directly above the mill wheel in a channel, in which the flow direction of the water is diverted. The effluent at the bottom water thus drives the overshot mill wheel, which is made from iron. This has the advantage that forms less spray water on the path located in front of the waterwheel. The waterwheel originally served to drive the pug mill stones to break up the fibers. The mill trench also provided the paper mill with clean process water for washing the rags and dispersing the pulp. Later, the hydropower also powered papermaking machinery. Today, the waterwheel is mainly used for regenerative energy generation. An electric generator generates 4.5 kilowatts of electricity and feeds it into the public grid. At museum demonstrations, it continues to drive the system. = Machinised card board production = With the increasing consumption of paper, wood pulp and cellulose broadened the raw material base and with the invention of the paper machine and the associated large paper mills, stiff competition affected the smaller paper mills. Follmer's mill had sufficient capital through the associated farm to secure the existence of the mill by investing in a simple round screening machine and specializing in paperboard production. Thanks to its compact design, the machine could be set up without any structural expansion of the production facility. The machine was built in 1883 Joachim & Sohn machine works in Schweinfurt. The prices of such a machine depended on the type of machine and was according to the Schweinfurt price list of 1900 in the range 1875 and 2600 marks for a rotary screen machine. So it was a substantial investment, compared to the previous value of Follmer's possessions, which were listed as 30,000 marks in 1887.Preisverzeichnis √ºber Papier- und Pappen- und Holzstoff- Fabrikations-Maschinen etc. der Maschinfabrik, Eisengie√üerei & Kesselschmiede C. Joachim&Sohn; Schweinfurt a. Main. 1 January 1900, p. 31. The finished paper sheets were placed in the attic to dry over clothesline or hung-up with special pegs. This work was mostly done by children. Special ventilation flaps ensured adequate air exchange. The mill specialized in folder and packaging paper production prior to World War II. The Homburg assortment consisted in 1955 of colored, embossed cardboard, colored folders and ribbed folders.Invoice by Darmst√§dter Verlagsgesellschaft to the paper mill of 7.

In the latter case, a special round cylinder mimicked the ribs in the cardboard caused by the scoop during the hand-made bows. While mechanical file-to-blanket production ran until it was shut down in 1975, packaging paper production was discontinued soon after 1955.Information provided by the Sp√§th family. The paper drying was done in the attics from the founding of the paper mill until 1975. There, the entire dry floor facility is preserved with paper clips, dry bars and hemp rope covering. To be able to work independently of the capacity of the dry floors and the weather, Johann Hermann, the son of Johann Follmer, built a heated, separate drying hall in 1913. Today, only plans give the structural shape of that building, since the hall was demolished after production ceased. Format cutting machine The folders were smoothed in a colander equipped with two cylindrical rollers. Satin-finished folders were pressed until 1975 in a wooden screw press, which was equipped with two pressing devices and had already belonged to the pre-industrial workshop equipment. For the trimming of the folder a format cutting machine from the 1930s was used, which was acquired in the 1950s. Homburg folders and card board were sold both in Germany and abroad. Domestic customers of the paper mill complemented paper wholesalers, for instance, the State Archives W√ºrzburg, folder manufacturers or the printing department of the penal institution in Straubing. In 1956, a Hamburg paper exporter expressly requested the delivery of the \\"extra toughened air-dried handmade blanket cover\\" in \\"seaworthy full board packaging\\".Letter of Josef P.

Privately owned. It was recognised and appreciated that the quality of the cardboard produced on the rotary screen machine was high, because it was not glued, but \\"particularly tough and well glued\\". Although manual paper production was never completely discontinued, the mill increasingly specialized in folder and packaging paper production. Wrapping paper production was discontinued in 1955, while machine-file production ran until plant shutdown. After 186 years, the Homburger paper mill ceased operations in 1975. The two main reasons for the shutdown were the comparatively labor-intensive mode of production and higher sanitation requirements, so a new treatment plant would have been needed, with no space and no resources available.  Museum  Paper museum, 2018 After decommissioning in 1975, the building was listed as a historical monument (File No. D-6-77-154-6), but its renovation began only 20 years later. In the meantime, the Follmer family continued to take care of the preservation of the building. Great emphasis was placed on original fidelity. The original equipment of pre-industrial production such as water wheel, dry floor and wooden screw press are preserved, as well as the functional papermaking machines. After three years of renovation, the paper mill was opened in 1997 as a historical and technical museum . In addition to the old production facilities, it shows the working and living situation at the time of the shutdown of the factory. The entire manufacturing process at the time of plant shutdown can still be understood based on the historical machinery and equipment preserved. There are both pre-industrial facilities such as waterwheel drive, dry floors and a wooden screw press, as well as industrial machinery. In the authentically preserved production rooms, the production process, working life and workplace situation in the paper mill are vividly informed. Furthermore, the museum presentation includes the environment of the people who worked and lived in the mill. The living rooms are kept in their original state during the shutdown. Documentation exhibitions on the different paper raw materials, watermarks and preindustrial hand-paper production complete the exhibition.  Today's manual paper production  Johannes Follmer The papermaker Johannes Follmer, the youngest member of the family, continues the papermaking tradition that has existed in Homburg for almost two centuries in the fifth generation in the 21st century. The decision to work with paper evolved from the long-standing family tradition, which should receive new validity through the further development of the products and production methods. He has acquired the necessary know-how from various teachers. This included, among other things, the stay of several weeks in the B√ºttenpapierfabrik Gmund and a basic study in the papermaking school Gernsbach near Baden-Baden. In the outbuilding of the museum he runs a modern papermaking workshop. There, the classical papermaking industry is experiencing a renaissance: Each sheet of handmade paper is drawn by hand and dried in air as it was then. The paper differs from the machine-made papers in its finely grained surface and four-sided deckle edge. The basis for paper production in his workshop are historical and modern scoops, various presses and a paper Dutchman for processing the fibers. Depending on the desired paper quality, today high quality raw materials are used. In addition to fabric scraps, various fibers are used: cotton, flax, hemp or abaca. Pigments, mottling and inclusions in handmade paper complete the range of different paper types. In addition, papers are produced for high-quality printmaking. In collaboration with various artists, large bows with elaborate watermarks are created by hand. Bringing handmade paper closer to a wider audience in its original environment is a goal pursued by the Homburg papermaker. Paper should regain importance as an independent medium. The Homburg paper making tradition strives also in the computer age, to persist and defy by craftsmanship the new Zeitgeist.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004.  History  Cockatoo Island became a gaol in 1839, following advice by NSW Governor George Gipps to the British Secretary of State for the Colonies that convicts would be sent to the island after the closure of the Norfolk Island convict establishment. The Prison Barracks Precinct was built over several years. Quarrying of grain silos (see also Underground Grain Silos) was one of the early convict tasks. In order to service Royal Navy ships, the Fitzroy Dock was built on the island and completed in 1857. Cockatoo became the major government dockyard in Australia. In 1869 prisoners were transferred from the island to Darlinghurst, and the prison buildings became an industrial school for girls and a reformatory from 1871. At this time the name of the island became Biloela. The dockyard area was now separated from this institutional area on the top of the island by a fence. Following the departure of the females in 1888, prisoners were again sent to the island, and the gaol function continued until about 1909. Meanwhile, the dockyard function expanded, and the Sutherland Dock was built in 1890. The New South Wales Public Works Department declared Cockatoo the state dockyard. After Federation, in 1913 Cockatoo became the Commonwealth Dockyard, and the island, both through ship-building and servicing, played an important role both in the development of the Royal Australian Navy and during the First World War. The former prison buildings were now used for offices and other purposes. From 1933 the dockyard was leased from the Australian Government by Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Co Ltd and the island played a very significant role during the Second World War. After the war the dockyard (now known as Vickers) continued, and submarine facilities were introduced. The dockyard closed in 1992, and some demolition took place. Sale of the island was proposed. The island is now vested in the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. There are four elements to this precinct: Biloela House, a modest cottage adjacent, Clerk of Petty Sessions Cottage, and some of the island's grain silos. Biloela House was built c.1841 as a superintendent's residence and it was designed by Colonel George Barney, the Commanding Royal Engineer who played a notable engineering role in New State Wales during the period. The building was soon enlarged. Again in 1859-60 extensions were erected to accommodate the new Engineer in Chief and Superintendent, Gother Kerr Mann. During the period of the girls school, the residence was occupied by the new registrar of the Sydney water police who stayed until 1896. By 1898 the house had become two barrack quarters for the unmarried male and female gaol warders. With the Commonwealth takeover in 1913, the northern quarters became the shipyard manager's home and the southern became offices. Little historical information is available for the small cottage adjacent to Biloela House. Clerk of Petty Sessions Cottage was built prior to 1845 and was also designed by the Commanding Royal Engineer. Extensions were soon added and the building's orientation changed. In the early 1890s extensive changes were made and the building was also re-roofed; the building today is basically the 1890s plan. It has always been a residence. By 1892 it was the foreman shipwright's house and then, upgraded, the dock master's residence. The main buildings in the group, along with the Prison Barracks Precinct, form the only imperial-funded (as opposed to colonial-funded) convict public works complex in NSW. Due to the uncertain grain supplies available in the early colony of NSW, Governor Gipps in 1839 decided to embark on a program of silo construction on the Island. In this way grain could be stored for future use. The silos were designed by Barney and were excavated into Cockatoo's sandstone by convict work gangs and, being well sealed, the silos were weevil-free. By November 1840 20,000 bushels of wheat were stored in the completed silos, and other silos were underway. Gipps hoped to increase storage up to 100,000 bushels if the low price of wheat then prevailing continued. Over twenty silos were eventually quarried. However, as grain storage (and hence regulation of the market) was at odds with Britain's subsequent free market policies, Gipps was instructed to sell the grain. Later, either in the 1870s or early 1880s, the silos were re-used for water storage purposes. Some of the silos were subsequently destroyed by building construction. The surviving silos on the Island are believed to be the only group of convict-cut rock silos in the nation. The other major group of convict constructed underground silos are located on Norfolk Island, these are cut into the earth.  Description  The Biloela House precinct includes: * Biloela House, the former superintendent's quarters and extensions (stone enclosure of western corner excluded) * the stone cottage to west of Biloela House * remaining underground silos to south- east of Biloela House * north-east part of small sandstone cottage south-east of Biloela house (Clerk of Petty Sessions Cottage) The Biloela House precinct is located on the summit of the island and consequently the precinct possesses notable aesthetic qualities given its site on Sydney Harbour's biggest island and its harbour outlook. Biloela House is Old Colonial Georgian in style. It is \\"L\\" shaped, and the small cottage adjacent is rectangular, thus the two form a courtyard. The buildings are of similar style and are constructed of unpainted sandstone. Windows are mainly casements. The roofs are hipped and clad in corrugated iron. There is a picket fence. The Clerk of Petty Sessions Cottage is modest and single storey. It was originally constructed of sandstone, but has been extended in brick and fibreboard. Here the roof is again hipped and clad with corrugated iron; there are several chimneys. An infilled verandah faces a grassed area with walled garden near the escarpment. The silos appear to be nine in number, though not all are necessarily intact or complete. The perfectly symmetrical silos are bottle-shaped, and an incision on the surface of the rock indicates the diameter of the silo below ground. The mouth is square and provided with a lip to exclude water; there is also a metal plate over the mouth. The \\"bottle\\" is circular in plan and approaching 5.5 metres in diameter. The silos held from 3000 to 5000 bushels of grain each. Visible evidence of thirteen silos remains on the island (the other silos are part of the Underground Grain Silos). = Condition = The 1997 Conservation Management Report commented that Biloela House had been re- roofed. The stonework of the north and south wings was in mainly good condition. The north wing interior was generally good, though the south was in need of work. The Clerk of Petty Sessions Cottage was in very good condition and had been recently re-painted and re-roofed. The fireplace in the front room had been blocked. As at May 2001, the surviving silos are understood to be in good condition.  Heritage listing  The Biloela House precinct was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Constructed mainly in the early 1840s, the elements of the Biloela Group are historically highly significant for their direct association with convict administration in the Australian colonies. The group is also associated with Cockatoo Island's role as a major government shipyard. Criterion B: Rarity The group, along with the separately registered prison barracks precinct, is the only remaining imperially funded convict public works complex in NSW. The silos on the island are believed to be the only major group of convict-cut rock silos in Australia. Criterion D: Characteristic values The group, along with the separately registered prison barracks precinct, is the only remaining imperially funded convict public works complex in NSW. As such, the buildings in the group are important examples of convict structures of the period. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics Located on the summit of Cockatoo Island (the largest island in Sydney Harbour), the group has an impressive harbour outlook and is evocative of the convict era. As such, the group with its sandstone forms has significant aesthetic qualities. Criterion F: Technical achievement The silos are finely excavated and reflect a high degree of stonemasonry skills on the part of their builders. Criterion H: Significant people The group has a close association with Colonel George Barney, the commander of the Royal Engineers, who played a notable engineering role in NSW during the period.

It is administratively part of the city of Sorong, specifically the Sorong Islands district. The island served as an administrative center of Dutch Empire administration in West Papua, and continued to become the core of Sorong for some time before the city grew in mainland Papua. Geography and administration The island is located around away from mainland Sorong. It has a perimeter of around . The island is part of two administrative villages (kelurahan): West and East Doom. The two villages also include other small islands close to Sorong. As of 2016, the two villages have a population of 9,143. History Prior to European colonization, the island had been part of the Sultanate of Tidore. First appearing in Dutch records by 1863 through a study by Heinrich Agathon Bernstein, the island was colonized by the Dutch early in the establishment of Netherlands New Guinea, with a colonial post being officially established in 1906 and a Minahasan being appointed as the head. The island later served as an administrative post, with multiple office buildings, a prison, and a \\"pleasure building\\" being constructed on the island. A diesel-powered electrical generator was installed on the island to supply electricity for the buildings. The island acted as an administrative center for the onderafdeling ( subdivision) of Sorong between 1935 and 1950 or 1952. During the Second World War, Japanese forces occupied and fortified the island, building a network of tunnels and bunkers. The island was attacked by American and Australian aircraft throughout the war. Following the war, a fishing station was briefly established on the island before it was moved to Manokwari. After the takeover of West Papua by Indonesia, growth of Sorong forced the movement of the city to the mainland around 1965, although the island initially remained developed relative to mainland Sorong until the latter grew, with Doom being called the \\"star island\\" in the 1970s and 80s due to its relatively bright lights. Access and facilities Due to its short distance from Sorong, Doom is reachable by boat within 10 minutes from the mainland. The island has a reverse osmosis seawater processing facility, capable of processing 9,000 liters per hour. There is a high school on the island, which used to be a Dutch prison complex, and a football field.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004.  History  Cockatoo Island became a gaol in 1839, following advice by New South Wales Governor George Gipps to the British Secretary of State for the Colonies that convicts would be sent to the island after the closure of the Norfolk Island convict establishment. The convict precinct (see also Barracks Block) was built over several years; the buildings beginning to be occupied from October 1841. Quarrying of grain silos (at the Underground Grain Silos and Biloela House) was one of the early convict activities. In order to service Royal Navy ships, the Fitzroy Dock was built on the island and completed in 1857. Cockatoo Island Dockyard became the major government dockyard in Australia. In 1869 prisoners were transferred from the island to Darlinghurst, and the prison buildings became an industrial school for girls and a reformatory from 1871. The dockyard area was now separated from this institutional area on the top of the island by a fence. Following the departure of the females in 1888, prisoners were again sent to the island, and the gaol function continued until about 1909. Meanwhile, the dockyard function expanded, and the Sutherland Dock was built in 1890. The New South Wales Public Works Department declared Cockatoo the state dockyard. Following Federation, in 1913 Cockatoo became the Commonwealth Dockyard, and the island, both through ship-building and servicing, played an important role both in the development of the Royal Australian Navy and during the First World War. The former prison buildings were now used for office purposes. From 1933 the dockyard was leased from the Commonwealth by Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Co Ltd and the island played a very significant role during the Second World War. After the war the dockyard (now known as Vickers) continued, and submarine facilities were introduced. The dockyard closed in 1992, and some demolition took place. Sale of the island was proposed. The island is now vested in the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. The precinct includes the former convict barracks block, mess hall, military guard room and detached kitchen, officers' quarters, free overseers' quarters (and a second quarters to the east), and the north-west escarpment including various trees. Further buildings from the convict period are included in the separately registered Biloela House precinct. The barracks block was erected c.1839-42. It was designed by the Commanding Royal Engineer Colonel George Barney, who played a major engineering role in the colony during the period. The building included hospital wards, a cookhouse and mess shed. Due to overcrowding, a second storey was proposed in 1849, but was not proceeded with. Various extensions were added (a latrine and office block formed infill when built later). The barracks was later used by the industrial school, and by prisoners again in 1888. Following the Commonwealth's takeover, the building was used as offices. The military guard room, with detached kitchen and toilet, was erected in 1842, and a cell block (later demolished) was completed three years later. The buildings were designed by Barney. During the female occupation phase, the guard room was used as a sewing room, then as a store and office. After the females' departure, the room became offices and accommodation for the resident engineer, before a new wing was added and the building reverted to prison purposes. After Commonwealth assumption of control, the room was used as a residence by the 1920s. After the Second World War the buildings' roofs were removed; stone was also cannibalised for use elsewhere on the island. In 1980 parts of the room were removed and the walls were topped with cement render. The mess hall was erected after Gother Kerr Mann was appointed engineer on the island. Construction took place between about 1847 and 1851. The mess hall was built west of the convict barracks and, with further walling to the southwest and northwest, completed the enclosed nature of the convict precinct. Following the Industrial School and later prison period, and after the Commonwealth took over, the mess hall was altered for office purposes and the windows were enlarged. The building though is generally intact. The military officers' quarters or guard room was erected c.1845-57 and was designed by the Commanding Royal Engineer. It has always been used as a residence, firstly by officers, then by the superintendent of the girls school, then for a time by the governor of the later prison (which was known as Biloela). After this, in 1912, the building became the home of the engineering superintendent, and shortly after the general manager's residence. In 1984 the building was being used as two units for Vickers staff. Various alterations and extensions were built during the building's lifetime. The free overseers' quarters was erected between about 1850 and 1857. It has been a residence almost continuously since it was built. There have been many alterations, including quite a number of poor twentieth century ones. The second quarters to the east was built at the same time. Later it was used for battery storage, and then for chemistry and photographic purposes. During the Second World War it was converted to an air raid shelter, later it held archival drawings and later still part of it became a latrine. The buildings of the precinct (together with the Biloela House) form the only remaining imperial-funded (as opposed to colonial-funded) convict public works complex in New South Wales and form one of the most complete groups of convict structures in Australia.  Description  The Prison Barracks Precinct comprises: * barracks complex of prison and hospital wards, cook house and mess shed and its enclosed court * former Officer's guard room; * former military guard room, kitchen and grassed enclosure * cottage, former free officer's quarters * north-west escarpment, including trees. The precinct occupies the top ridge on the south-west corner of Cockatoo Island, Sydney Harbour. The style of the these generally sandstone buildings is mostly Old Colonial Georgian or Victorian Georgian (though there have been many changes over the years), and all the structures are important as early and often rare examples of their type. Single storey, the barracks block is built in a U-shape, and with an enclosed court. As mentioned above, the building includes former hospital wards, a cookhouse and a mess shed, plus later additions. The roof (variously corrugated iron, fibro and concrete) is pitched and the building has a verandah. During the Second World War two wards in the building were converted to air raid shelters. Various other modifications were made at other times. The military guard room is single storey, rectangular, with a separate kitchen. Both buildings are roofless. Window and door openings are rectangular. The walls finish at the roof line with stone slab eaves. inside, the guard room features iron wall-rods which would have supported timber boards upon which rifles were laid. Underneath are iron hat-pegs. There is also a reconstructed stone chimney at the south-west end. The guard room and the kitchen have stone slab floors. Finely detailed, the mess hall was originally freestanding. With its fine gable and east end, it is a dominating feature in the precinct. On the ground floor, openings are square, while on the upper floor (above simple verandah supports on timber posts) are two attic windows with rounded heads. The gabled roof is clad with corrugated iron. The military officers' quarters is a one and two storey structure, and is built of painted masonry. The roof is clad with iron and is hipped in form, there are verandahs to ground and first floors, and there is very little ornamentation. Again, there have been many extensions and other alterations. The original section of the free overseers' quarters is built of stone, which has been partly painted. Single storey, the building is quite small. Double-hung windows are multi-paned. The roof is gabled and clad with corrugated iron. Alterations include partial filling-in of the northern verandah, and weatherboard and fibro extensions to the south. The second quarters to the east was drastically altered when converted to an air raid shelter; a concrete roof and blast walls were added at this time. The precinct has aesthetic significance for the buildings' sandstone construction, early Georgian styling, and the evocative nature of the group which is a strong reminder of the convict era. Sited high on the island, the precinct's qualities are preserved above the surrounding industrial areas. = Condition = The barracks block has been modified for different uses at different times during its history. During the Second World War particularly destructive alterations were made. Some inappropriate materials remain, though in the 1990s a new roof was fitted, and other repairs and painting work was completed. Some decay of stonework was noted in the 1997 conservation management plan (CMP). The military guard room and detached kitchen are both roofless. Walls have varying levels of intactness. The CMP noted that the stonework was generally in good condition, while there was some corrosion to the ironwork. There was some weed and other vegetation growth. The mess hall was substantially intact, and the stonework is in mainly good condition and the interior was generally satisfactory. The CMP noted that the roof of the central hall would require renewal, that some repairs had recently been made internally (but that more work was needed) and that the tie-rods in the roof trusses might need re- tightening. The officers' quarters was in fair to good condition. The building is divided into two units. Some damp and roofing iron problems were noted by the CMP, and some repairs were done in the 1990s. The free overseers' quarters was painted in the 1990s. The CMP noted some rising damp problems, and that some timbers had been replaced due to termites. The eastern quarters building has good stonework, but the building's integrity was drastically reduced during conversion to an air raid shelter. This work saw a concrete roof and blast walls added.  Heritage listing  The Prison Barracks Precinct was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Dating from c.1839-57, the barracks precinct is historically highly significant for its direct association with convict administration in the Australian colonies. It is also associated with the other phases of Cockatoo Island's history, as an industrial school and as a major government shipyard. Criterion B: Rarity The precinct, together with the separately registered Biloela House precinct, is the only remaining imperially funded convict public works complex in NSW, and is one of the most complete groups of convict structures in Australia. Criterion D: Characteristic values The precinct is one of the most complete groups of convict structures in Australia and as such, the buildings in the precinct are important as examples of convict structures of the period. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics Sited high on the island, the precinct has important aesthetic qualities despite later alterations. The buildings' sandstone construction, Georgian styling and the evocative nature of the group as a strong reminder of the convict era all contribute to the place's significance. Criterion H: Significant people Several of the buildings in the precinct were designed by Colonel George Barney, who as Commanding Royal Engineer played a significant engineering role in the colony for a number of years.

History The Johntown camp was first established in the early 1850s when teamster, James Fenemore, set up a mining camp next to the Gold Canyon road. Two years earlier, emigrants journeying to California, had discovered gold at the entrance to Gold Canyon near Dayton. Johntown site, 1880s For the next 10 years, miners worked the area, \\"sluicing the placer deposits with primitive rockers and long toms, recovering limited amounts of gold.\\" The canyon was populated just a few months out of the year, when water was available for sluicing. Johntown settlement was the site of the first newspaper published in Nevada. In the mid 1850s and handwritten on foolscap, a single copy of the Gold Canyon Switch, was passed from miner to miner to deliver the local news. Joe Webb edited the newspaper between 1854 and 1858. From 1857 to 1859, Johntown was the largest mining camp in the western Utah Territory and its most important mining area. The Comstock silver rush began with this small camp in the winter of 1859, when miners traveled up Gold Canyon and became the earliest to mine gold at Gold Hill. In June of that year, Gold Hill was the site where the Comstock silver discoveries were made. By the early 1860, the Johntown mining camp was abandoned. There are no original buildings to mark the site of the original settlement. The Johntown Nevada historical marker is located on the east side of Nevada State Route 341, south of Silver City.

Bad Salzelmen has been a district of Sch√∂nebeck (Elbe) since 1932 and is a state-approved spa in the Salzlandkreis in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It was founded in 1894 when the towns of Gro√ü Salze and Elmen merged to form the town of Gro√ü Salze. The town of Gro√ü Salze was renamed Bad Salzelmen in 1926. History Bad Salzelmen can look back on more than 800 years of salt production history. In Elmen brine was already mined in the 12th century. With the \\"white gold\\" the Pf√§nner, or later also called Salzgrafen, gained great influence on the town. As a Pf√§nnerschaft, they were not only a commercial association, but also spoke the law as authorities. Parts of the town wall from the 14th century, the former town hall from the 15th century and the Johanniskirche from the middle of the 15th century still bear witness to the wealth and power of the Pf√§nners. Today the Salzlandmuseum is located in the town hall. In 1680 the town of Gro√ü Salze went to the Brandenburg-Prussian Duchy of Magdeburg. Gro√ü Salze as a so-called Immediatstadt was directly subordinated to the government of the duchy and lay in the wood circle. Between 1756 and 1765, the graduation house was built with a total length of 1837 metres, making it the largest ever built. The \\"K√∂niglich Preu√üische Saline\\" (Royal Prussian Salt Works) was the largest state enterprise in Prussia at that time. In 1776 the 32 meter high brine tower was built near the graduation house. It served the brine production by means of a Dutch \\"wind art\\". The saltworks were connected to the port of Sch√∂nebeck by a company railway. The discovery of the healing effect of brine by Johann Wilhelm Tolberg marked the beginning of the history of the spa town of Bad Salzelmen. Germany's first brine spa was opened here in 1802. In 1815 Ernst Leopold Fabian was appointed salt inspector. The brine was extracted by underground flushing. The caverns thus created (\\"Graf-Moltke- Schacht\\") were later used as underground inhalation rooms and during the last years of the Second World War to store, among other things, museum collections of the Berlin State Museums and archives of the Deutsche Akademie and the Prussian Privy State Archives. The extraction of brine for the purpose of salt production was stopped in 1967, but the brine is still the basis for the spa operation. 300.4 metres of the original graduation house are still preserved today, which serve as an open-air inhalatorium. An inhalatorium is attached to the graduation house in a south-westerly direction. The \\"brine park\\" with the recreational pool \\"Solequell\\", the spa centre \\"Lindenbad\\" and the \\"Kunsthof\\" (partly in the brine tower) are today attractions for those seeking relaxation and spa guests.

History  = Daqi Tongbao = It is widely believed by Chinese numismatists that when the Kingdom of Southern Tang was established by Xu Zhigao under the name Great Qi that Xu Zhigao,Bian Xiaoxuan (ÂçûÂ≠ùËê±) (1992), \\"Nantang (ÂçóÂîê)\\", in Zhongguo da baike quanshu (‰∏≠ÂúãÂ§ßÁôæÁßëÂÖ®Êõ∏), Zhongguo lishi (‰∏≠ÂúãÊ≠∑Âè≤). (Beijing / Shanghai: Zhongguo da baike quanshu chubanshe), Vol. 2.) (in Mandarin Chinese) the Prince of Qi or by the founder of the Southern Tang with the original name of the Tang kingdom issued cash coins with the inscription Daqi Tongbao (Â§ßÈΩäÈÄöÂØ∂), however only 2 specimens of this cash coin are believed to exist and the whereabouts of both of these are currently unknown as they have disappeared.Hartill, David (September 22, 2005). Cast Chinese Coins. Trafford, United Kingdom: Trafford Publishing. . Pages 119‚Äì120. Another variant of the Daqi Tongbao cash coins has 4 holes and is therefore known under the name of \\"four eye Daqi cash coins\\" (ÂõõÁúºÂ§ßÈΩäÈå¢, s√¨ y«én d√† q√≠ qi√°n). A large number of imitation Daqi Tongbao cash coins are also known to exist which were cast from the moulds of Taiping Tongbao (Â§™Âπ≥ÈÄöÂØ∂) cash coins and feature a calligraphic style similar to them. It is very likely that during this period the cash coins of the earlier dynasties remained in use as the main currency in the Southern Tang kingdom. = Cash coins issued under Li Jing = Under the reign Emperor Li Jing who first used the reign title Baoda (‰øùÂ§ß), cash coins were cast both in bronze and iron with the inscription Baoda Yuanbao (‰øùÂ§ßÂÖÉÂØ∂) from the year 943 until 957, however the bronze variants are extremely rare. In the year Xiande 5 (962) Li Jing cast the Yongtong Quanhuo () which had a nominal value of 10 smaller bronze cash coins, however they only weighed 40% of how much value 10 cash coins usually weight. Li Jing was short of funds for his army at that time. These cash coins were cast in both clerical (\\"official style\\", Èö∏Êõ∏, l√¨ sh≈´) and seal script (ÁØÜÊõ∏, zhu√†n sh≈´). Some of the cash Coins with inscriptions in seal script are diminutive in size and lightweight. Li Jing‚Äôs minister Zhong Mo obtained permission to cast large coins, one of them being equal to ten smaller coins, with this inscription. In 964, the coin was withdrawn when Zhong Mo incurred the displeasure of the Emperor. It is also possible that the Yongtong Quanhuo cash coins were cast at a later date. As the people weren't used to fiduciary coinages they weren't accepted on the marked with their intended value. The Datang Tongbao () cash coins which have their inscriptions written in li script were produced in the year 959.Chester L. Krause and Clifford Mishler. Standard Catalog of World Coins. These cash coins are not as well-made as the later produced Tangguo Tongbao. There is exists a rare variety of the Datang Tongbao cash coins which is large in size and has a very broad rim. Usually a cash coin that bears the name of the dynasty would be cast immediately after its establishment however these Datang cash coins were minted as its second official series, it is possible that this was done as a form of propaganda as 960 was the year that the Song dynasty was established around that time these cash coins started being manufactured. From the year Xiande 6 (963) Li Jing produced the Tangguo Tongbao () which are written in seal, li, and regular script. Initially the Tangguo Tongbao cash coins were cast in two different denominations,Fredrik Schj√∏th. Chinese Currency. Oslo, 1929 one had a weight of 12 grams and a nominal value of 10 w√©n (Áï∂ÂçÅ, dƒÅng sh√≠), these cash coins had their inscription written in seal script.

It is notable that the 2 w√©n Tangguo Tongbao cash coins were cast as \\"matched coins\\" (Â∞çÈå¢, du√¨ qi√°n, Â∞çÂìÅ, du√¨ p«ên, ÂíåÂêàÈå¢, h√© h√© qi√°n) where they were released with inscriptions written in multiple types of Chinese calligraphy which in this case were li script and seal script although some versions tend to have a large star above the square center hole on the reverse side of the coin, other than there difference in calligraphy \\"matched coins\\" tend to have the same weight, composition, thickness, diameter, size of the square center hole, Etc. This technique which was first introduced under the Southern Tang would become very popular in the succeeding Song dynasty. Only a few years later the Tangguo Tongbao cash coins were cast in regular and seal scripts, these variants tend to have their inscriptions written in very small characters while they have a broad rim. Some versions of the seal script Tangguo Tongbao are quite rare such as a variety where there are large unusual characters while another variety has the \\"Tang\\" (Âîê, tang) character written with abbreviated strokes. A variant of the Tangguo Tongbao cash coin with the character \\"Wu\\" (‰∫î) has been reported to exist, however the authenticity of these specimens is doubtful. Over the years both the Datang Tongbao and Tangguo Tongbao cash coins were being manufactured in lighter and smaller sizes, so it very unlikely that these cash coins would‚Äôve maintained a nominal value of two Tang dynasty era Kaiyuan Tongbao cash coins. = Cash coins issued under Li Yu = A Kaiyuan Tongbao (ÈñãÂÖÉÈÄöÂØ∂) cash coin of the Southern Tang written in seal script.

(in Mandarin Chinese) and the resources of the country being exhausted, his minister Han Xizai obtained permission to cast coins. These were Kaiyuan Tongbao () cash coins and are written in both clerical (or li) and seal script and date from 961. These distinguished from Tang dynasty period Kaiyuan Tongbao cash coins by the broader rims, and the characters being in less deep relief. The seal script writing was devised by the scholar Xu Xuan. This coin was slightly larger than the old Kaiyuan Tongbao cash coins, and had broader rims, and was found convenient by both the government and the people. As they were massively produced these Kaiyuan Tongbao cash coins still exist in large quantities today. As the Tangguo Tongbao cash coins also exist in very large quantities today it's suspected that they continued to be manufactured during the first two years of the reign of Li Yu. Among the variants of the Southern Tang era Kaiyuan coins are a variety which is large and appear to be very similar in appearance to the official script version of the Yongtong Quanhuo cash coins. Another variety of Southern Tang era Kaiyuan Tongbao cash coins is slightly smaller than the aforementioned coin but is actually still larger than a common type of cash coins. This version of the coin is believed to have been a 3 w√©n (Áï∂‰∏â, dƒÅng sƒÅn) cash coin that may in fact have been a reduced weight version of a 10 w√©n cash coin. This variety is actually very rare.  Vault protector coins  The earliest known vault protector coin (ÈéÆÂ∫´Èå¢) known to exist is the Datang Zhenku (Â§ßÂîêÈïáÂ∫ì) which translates as \\"the Vault Protector of the Tang Dynasty\\" and was cast during the Baoda period of Li Jing. The diameter of these Datang Zhenku vault protector coins is 6 cm, and they have a thickness of 0.6 cm, the diameter of the square center hole is 1.24 cm and the Datang Zhenku coin weighs 93.7 grams.‚ÄúCoins in China‚Äôs History‚Äù published in 1936 by Arthur B.

Biography  Since August 1, 1992, Pavlenko worked as a junior investigator of the Leninsky District Department of Internal Affairs of Barnaul, later beginning to work as a driver for a medical center in the Oktyabrsky District Department of Internal Affairs. Since 1999, Pavlenko lured victims into his apartment, raping them and filming it for his porno album. Subsequently, the girls declared that he was obsessed with sexual sadism, and were afraid to tell the militsiya anything. In 2000 Pavlenko nearly got caught, when a girl raped by him wrote an application to the police. His colleagues, defending the \\"honor of the uniform\\", did not stir up the case. Pavlenko also escaped dismissal and conviction because he gave the girl a bribe of 5000 rubles, and she took the application. Refusing to turn in the maniac, death soon followed. At the end of 2000, Pavlenko brutally dealt with two girls, whom he had taken to his apartment. After they refused his sexual advances, he struck them with a knife and then an axe, killing both of them. Pavlenko then dismembered their bodies in his own bathroom, packing the body parts in bags, putting them in the trunk of his car and disposing of them in the Ob River near the village of Gongba, where he loved to swim since childhood. Although the body parts were disposed of, they were soon discovered and quickly identified. In addition to the double murder, Pavlenko was charged with the murder of two other girls.  Arrest and trial  Pavlenko was arrested after a victim of his jumped out the window, breaking her leg, and writing a statement on rape on a hospital bed. In his apartment, a large amount of women's underwear, blood traces, hacksaws, knives, needles, tongs, handcuffs, axes, several albums and about 20 negative films with pornographic material were found during the search. After his detention, Pavlenko was questioned not only for the crimes he had confessed to. Over the past summer in Barnaul, five abiturs of the Altai State Technical University had disappeared. Soon, on suspicion of committing the murders, a market trader named Alexander Anisimov was detained, who soon confessed to everything. However, Anisimov threw himself out the window during the investigative experiment, and the case remained undisclosed.–í–µ—Ä–Ω–µ—Ç—Å—è –ª–∏ –º–∞–Ω—å—è–∫ –≤ –ë–∞—Ä–Ω–∞—É–ª —ç—Ç–∏–º –ª–µ—Ç–æ–º? At his trial Pavlenko retracted all the previous testimonies, arguing that investigators of the prosecutor's office had beaten him into confessing. However, such a statement was refuted by the fact that after each interrogation the maniac had undergone a medical examination. The Altai Regional Court sentenced former senior police sergeant Alexander Pavlenko to 24 years in prison on November 22, 2001, the first five of which he would serve in normal prison, and the rest in a strict-regime colony. The Supreme Court of Russia upheld the verdict without change.  Case aftermath  Subsequently, the verdict was annulled by the Supreme Court of Russia on the recommendation of the European Court of Human Rights. On November 1, 2011, the Altai Regional Court issued a new conviction, to which Pavlenko was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment and 4 months. In January 2012, the Supreme Court of Russia again reversed the verdict and sent the criminal case for a new trial. On the charges of killing two girls and committing sexual acts against one of them, Pavlenko was acquitted. In connection to the case's revision, his sentence was reduced to 13 years and expired in February 2014. In connection to the case of the \\"Maniac Policeman\\", which received a great public response in Barnaul, cleansing of the ranks of law enforcement agencies were carried out.

It was released in February 1996 on Reflective Records in the United Kingdom and on Astralwerks in the United States. After establishing himself as a techno producer but then moving to an ambient style on his previous album Sea Biscuits (1994), Sharp's music on Emit Ecaps balances his techno and ambient styles with influences of drum and bass and jungle music. The name of the album reverses the term 'space time'. Emit Ecaps was a radio success and received acclaim from music journalists who praised Sharp's change in direction. The album was followed in November 1996 by Remit Recaps, a remix album of material from Emit Ecaps, created with the involvement of several producers. Background and production London-born Jonah Sharp (Spacetime Continuum) began his career as a professional jazz drummer before moving to the United States in 1992. In his home city San Francisco, he established his Reflective Records and recorded the majority of his ensuing work. He signed a record deal with Astralwerks in 1992, who released his techno-styled live debut album Alien Dreamtime in 1992 and the ambient music-styled follow-up Sea Biscuit in 1994, The latter album was released in Europe via Fax Records. Emit Ecaps was the follow-up to Sea Biscuit, and was recorded and produced by Sharp at Room 202. The album was mastered at The Compound, San Francisco, with Mixture 151 credited for providing mastering assistance. Sharp wrote the entire album alone. Composition Emit Ecaps moves Sharp away from ambient music and returns him to his dance music roots, incorporating styles of techno, house and jungle. Kurt B. Reighley of Trouser Press writes that, although still \\"perfectly suitable as listening music,\\" Emit Ecaps is Spacetime Continuum's first album \\"that actually invites the listener to dance.\\" He considers Emit Ecaps to move Sharp away from the \\"intersection of ambient and techno\\" and instead experiment with the rhythms of drum and bass and jungle. The techno and drum and bass grooves are treated with jazz-styled tension that Prasad Bidaye of Exclaim! considered to better resemble \\"the feeling of hard bop\\" than acid jazz. Sharp's previous ambient style is nonetheless represented on Emit Ecaps via its atmospheric backdrops, unusually clipped waveforms, \\"3-D mixing\\" and \\"the way he can make a hi-hat sizzle 50 different ways in the space of a single song,\\" according to Will Hermes of Spin magazine. The producer's extensive sound palette on the album incorporates juxtaposed timbres and rhythms, applying light breakbeats to slower-moving ambient textures. The album's \\"elemental electronica\\" style also incorporates syncopated elements and unusual noises. The resulting musical style has been described as \\"cyber- step\\" and \\"[j]azzed-up breakbeat.\\" Writer Tim Barr writes that some tracks, like \\"Iform\\", provide \\"relatively straight\\" extrapolations of 'midwest techno', whereas others like \\"Simm City\\" and \\"Movement #2\\" resemble \\"peak-era Derrick May vibing out on ambience.\\" Opening track \\"Iform\\" starts the album in a slow fashion until the emergence of a funky bassline after two minutes. \\"Kairo\\" begins with elements of ambient music before moving into trip hop territory and then incorporating an acoustic bass line and abstract keyboard work, followed by techno blips. Reighley says that the musical elements on the track slowly move around each other, citing the \\"jazz bass, staccato keyboard blips, a smidgen of banjo, the fluttering of double-time programmed drums.\\" According to Hermes, the track is closer to acid jazz as a term than musicians working in the genre. The track shares its \\"devastating beat work\\" and elements of jungle and electro with \\"Funkyar,\\" which contains \\"deftly serene symphonics.\\" \\"Twister\\", meanwhile, features different sounds spiralling around space music beats and heavy, thunderous basslines. Release and reception Released on 6 February 1996, Emit Ecaps was issued via Reflective Records in the United Kingdom, and via Astralwerks in the United States. The name Emit Ecaps is \\"space time\\" backwards. The British version of the record features a hologram sleeve. A radio success, the album reached number one on the CMJ Dance top 25 chart, compiled from weekly reports from an array of radio reporters. The album was promoted with the release of the Kairo EP by Reflective Records; this release also contained the track \\"Room Kick\\". In a contemporary review, Will Hermes of Spin felt that \\"Kairo\\" was the album's best track, describing it as a \\"brilliant seduction\\" and \\"among the most visionary 'club' singles of the past year or two.\\" He felt that the rest of the album \\"still pushes the idea of an electronic music as propulsive and articulate as rock, that speaks in the open codes of improv and looks beyond the limits of sequencers to see what's going on in the rest of the world.\\" Emma Warren of Select noted the warmth and \\"sense of geographical dislocation\\" that runs through the album, feeling that the record has a \\"heart-rendering\\" core beneath its \\"strange noises and syncopations.\\" She concluded that \\"Reflective never tire of turning electronic music as we know it on its head.\\" John Bush of AllMusic retrospectively named Emit Ecaps an \\"Album Pick\\" and wrote that it retains much of the \\"atmospheric beauty\\" of Sea Biscuit, but added that \\"the material usually works only as an introduction to devastating beat work on tracks like 'Kairo' and 'Funkyar,' both of which recall the chunkier side of jungle and electro quite convincingly.\\" He concluded that the album \\"is a fascinating fusion of hard and soft.\\" Kurt B. Reighley of Trouser Press said that Emit Ecaps finds Sharp \\"experimenting successfully with the rhythms of jungle/drum and bass culture.\\" Prasad Bidaye of Exclaim! consider the album to be \\"a colourful offering of optimistic drum & bass and techno grooves.\\" Charles Aaron of Spin wrote in late 1996 that Emit Ecaps was among several electronic albums that bore \\"mystifying creativity\\" from the previous few years. In his book Techno: The Rough Guide, Tim Barr considers the album to be a \\"solid follow-up to Sea Biscuit.\\" He wrote that although Emit Ecaps was \\"[l]ess unrelentingly strange than [Sharp's project] Reagenz, it nevertheless boasted some star-tlingly original moments.\\" He also described \\"Movement #2\\" as \\"gorgeous\\". Corey Moss of MTV News writes that Emit Ecaps is \\"considered a landmark of organic ambient electronic music.\\" Writer Paul Morley included the album in a list of 100 great albums \\"that map out the universe as it is because of Kraftwerk.\\" The album was followed-up with a remix album of its material, Remit Recaps, featuring remixes from producers including Autechre and Plaid. It was released on 7 November 1996 as a CD and two separate twelve-inch singles. Option called Emit Ecaps a \\"pretty outstanding established template\\" for the remix album.

He won the 1952 English Greyhound Derby. Early life He was bred by Henry Ernest Gocher, a retired cattle breeder. The choice of sire and dam was determined by Gocher's belief that greyhounds could be bred using the same genetic theories he had used for many years in raising prize beef cattle. He purchased the 1949 English Greyhound Derby champion Narrogar Ann and mated her to the 1948 English Greyhound Derby champion with the idea that this would result in a champion litter. The litter was whelped in March 1950 and they were given names with the initials EG after his own name. Both the sire and dam had been trained by Leslie Reynolds, which was also his chosen trainer for his pick of the new litter. Racing career One of the first targets for Endless Gossip was the English Greyhound Derby and he caused a sensation during the first round when winning in 28.52 seconds by ten lengths and recording a sectional time of 15.94, the first ever greyhound to break 16 seconds for a split time. He went on to win the Derby which culminated in the final on 28 June. Just one week later he won the Welsh Greyhound Derby at Cardiff Arms Park and was denied the chance to win the Triple Crown when the Scottish Greyhound Derby was cancelled. The fine form continued during the season when he then won the Laurels at Wimbledon Stadium. In 1953 he competed in the Waterloo Cup coursing event, which was rare for a champion track racing greyhound before he headed back to White City to defend his Derby title. The campaign finished at the second round stage before he made a second Welsh Derby final. He finished his career with wins in the Select Stakes, at Wembley beating his great rival, Magourna Reject and the Wimbledon Champion Stakes, which he again won from Magourna Reject. This brought his winnings to more than ¬£5,000. He later won a prize in the show ring at Crufts and was sold to Miss Joan Hunt, an American breeder, in Miami and was put to stud.

It was designed and built by George Raffan during 1887. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Colonial history= One of the earliest land grants in this area was made in 1824 to Captain Francis Marsh, who received bounded by the present Botany and High Streets, Alison and Belmore Roads. In 1839 William Newcombe acquired the land north- west of the present town hall in Avoca Street. Randwick takes its name from the town of Randwick, Gloucestershire, England. The name was suggested by Simeon Pearce (1821‚Äì86) and his brother James. Simeon was born in the English Randwick and the brothers were responsible for the early development of both Randwick and its neighbour, Coogee. Simeon had come to the colony in 1841 as a 21 year old surveyor. He built his Blenheim House on the he bought from Marsh, and called his property \\"Randwick\\". The brothers bought and sold land profitably in the area and elsewhere. Simeon campaigned for construction of a road from the city to Coogee (achieved in 1853) and promoted the incorporation of the suburb. Pearce sought construction of a church modelled on the church of St. John in his birthplace. In 1857 the first St Jude's stood on the site of the present post office, at the corner of the present Alison Road and Avoca Street.Pollen & Healy, 1988. Randwick was slow to progress. The village was isolated from Sydney by swamps and sandhills, and although a horse-bus was operated by a man named Grice from the late 1850s, the journey was more a test of nerves than a pleasure jaunt. Wind blew sand over the track, and the bus sometimes became bogged, so that passengers had to get out and push it free. From its early days Randwick had a divided society. The wealthy lived elegantly in large houses built when Pearce promoted Randwick and Coogee as a fashionable area. But the market gardens, orchards and piggeries that continued alongside the large estates were the lot of the working class. Even on the later estates that became racing empires, many jockeys and stablehands lived in huts or even under canvas. An even poorer group were the immigrants who existed on the periphery of Randwick in a place called Irishtown, in the area now known as The Spot, around the junction of St.Paul's Street and Perouse Road. Here families lived in makeshift houses, taking on the most menial tasks in their struggle to survive. In 1858 when the NSW Government passed the Municipalities Act, enabling formation of municipal districts empowered to collect rates and borrow money to improve their suburb, Randwick was the first suburb to apply for the status of a municipality. It was approved in February 1859, and its first Council was elected in March 1859. Randwick had been the venue for sporting events, as well as duels and illegal sports, from the early days in the colony's history. Its first racecourse, the Sandy Racecourse or Old Sand Track, had been a hazardous track over hills and gullies since 1860. When a move was made in 1863 by John Tait, to establish Randwick Racecourse, Simeon Pearce was furious, especially when he heard that Tait also intended to move into Byron Lodge. Tait's venture prospered, however and he became the first person in Australia to organise racing as a commercial sport. The racecourse made a big difference to the progress of Randwick. The horse-bus gave way to trams that linked the suburb to Sydney and civilisation. Randwick soon became a prosperous and lively place, and it still retains a busy residential, professional and commercial life. Today, some of the houses have been replaced by home units. Many European migrants have made their homes in the area, along with students and workers at the nearby University of NSW and the Prince of Wales Hospital. =Rathven= Rathven was constructed by George Raffan as a residence on land that extended to the bottom of Glebe Gully, with its gardens featuring Norfolk Island pines (Araucaria heterophylla), huge bamboos (probably Bambusa balcooa) and two Port Jackson fig trees (Ficus rubiginosa). George Raffan was a prominent Sydney businessman and grazier. He was a northern Scot, born in the county of Banffshire and arrived in New South Wales in 1874. After his arrival he had a shop on Bridge Street, Sydney near the Tank Stream. He commenced business as a building contractor, and within five years became one of the leading contractors of Sydney. He pioneered the cement industry and became a pastoralist, owning Lue and Cooyal stations at Mudgee. He died suddenly in Sydney in 1915.

During this period a large two-storey classroom wing was added and the billiard room demolished. The school vacated the property in 1977/78 and was sold to a developer in 1979. In January 1979 community representations were received from the Randwick and Districts Historical Society, Randwick Residents Action Group and the Randwick Glebe Gully Preservation Group concerned that Rathven was to be demolished as part of a proposed development of the Glebe Gully. An Interim Heritage Order placed over the property on 4 May 1979. A Permanent Conservation Order under the NSW Heritage Act was placed on the property on 23 October 1981 by then Minister for Planning, Paul Landa, after 72 residential apartments were proposed for the site. It was purchased in 1982 by Terry Bolin and his wife Robin who with the financial assistance of the Heritage Council Heritage Incentives Programme completed a considerable schedule of works conserving and restoring Rathven. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.Randwick and District Historical SocietyHeritage Office files  Description  Rathven is a large two-storey house of high Victorian domestic architecture. The roof has an unusual mansard and dormer design with a central tower, which is not part of the perimeter walls, with surrounding 'widow's walk'. In elevation the house is asymmetrical with a rounded projecting bay on the southern end. Rathven's interior details includes cornices, ornate ceilings and fine joinery remaining intact and in good condition.

Incidents  This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. For natural gas alone, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987. A \\"significant incident\\" results in any of the following consequences: * fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization * $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars * liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel) * releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances.

Two more leaks were found at locations where the electricity left the transmission line. The pipe was manufactured in 1947.PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 2002-2009, PHMSA Pipeline Incident Flagged Files, https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident- flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10. * On January 24, an Enbridge crude oil pipeline ruptured at a terminal in Douglas County, Wisconsin. Some of the crude oil flowed into the Nemadji River. Over were spilled. * On February 2, a natural gas pipeline ruptured near Viola, Illinois, resulting in the release of natural gas which ignited. A l6-foot section of the pipe fractured into three sections, which were ejected to distances of about 300 yards from the failure site. The 24-inch diameter natural gas transmission pipeline ruptured and a fire resulted on the ANR southwest mainline about 5 miles upstream of the New Windsor compressor station. Thirty people were evacuated as a precaution. Investigators found that the failure occurred in part due to cold weather acting on a major sag bend passing under a creek bed. The ambient temperatures contributed to pipe contraction and saturated soil over the pipe increased frost heave, apparently flexing the pipe until it separated around its circumference at a seam. The pipe was manufactured in 1949. * On February 20, a 24-inch gas transmission pipeline started leaking in Scott County, Missouri, underneath the Mississippi River. A shifted pipeline weight has caused damage to the pipeline. * On or about February 22, 2003, approximately 788 barrels of gasoline were discharged from a portion of Plantation Pipeline in Hull, Georgia, some of which entered into an unnamed tributary of East Sandy Creek and its adjoining shorelines. The spill resulted from a failed gasket on a buried block valve. * On February 27, dropping temperatures caused an Enbridge pipeline to fail in Samaria, Michigan. 130 barrels of crude oil were spilled. * On March 13, a seam failed on an 8-inch Dixie Pipeline propane line near Appling, Georgia, releasing about 110,000 gallons of propane. There were no injuries. The pipe split due to seam failure. * On March 23, a 24-inch El Paso Natural Gas pipeline near Eaton, Colorado exploded. The explosion sent flames 160 meters in the air, forcing evacuations. No one was injured. The heat from the flames melted the siding of two nearby houses and started many smaller grass fires. * On April 1, a 12-inch ConocoPhillips petroleum products pipeline ruptured, spilling about 1,000 barrels of diesel fuel near Ponca City, Oklahoma, with most of the fuel getting into Doga Creek. There were no injuries. Low Frequency ERW pipe seam failure was suspected as the cause. * On April 2, 2003, at Playa del Rey, California, atmospheric corrosion caused a pinhole leak on a Southern California Gas instrument gas supply line, resulting in an unplanned emergency shutdown. After shutdown, the blowdown released natural gas and liquids (crude oil and water) into the atmosphere, causing mist damage to neighboring homes, landscaping and vehicles. The faulty part was installed in 1970. Public and private property damage was $2,395,000. * On May 1, a 26-inch Williams Companies natural gas transmission pipeline failed near Lake Tapps, Washington. About 120 people were evacuated from a neighboring elementary school, a supermarket, and 30 to 40 houses in approximately a area. There was no fire or injuries. Land movement was suspected at first, but the failure was later determined to be from stress corrosion cracking. There were four previous failures on this pipeline in the preceding eight years. The pipe was manufactured and installed in 1956. * On May 8, an 8-inch LPG pipeline failed near Lebanon, Ohio. About 80 houses and one school in the area were evacuated. There was no fire or injuries. * On May 20, a 30-inch gas transmission pipeline exploded and burned near Nederland, Texas. The cause of the failure was internal corrosion, and the damages were estimated to be $6,901,322. The Houston Pipeline Company explosion did public and private property damage of $5,170,000. The cause of the leak was galvanic corrosion on the part installed in 1975. The rupture and fire damaged nearby electric lines and several unoccupied buildings that were part of the Sunoco terminal facility. * On June 17, 2003, at West Salem, Wisconsin, a canoeist reported seeing bubbles in the Lacrosse River and noted the pipeline signs. Investigators found a Northern Natural Gas pipe exposed in the river bottom. The leak was from a circumferential crack that appears to have started to crease in the pipe during its original installation in 1963. * On July 2, 2003, a small single engine aircraft had mechanical failure shortly after takeoff from the Linden, New Jersey airport and was forced to attempt an emergency landing at the Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Duke) compressor station. The aircraft collided with some pipeline facilities resulting in nearly $60,000 damage to the natural gas compressor station. * On July 2, excavation damage to a natural gas distribution line resulted in an explosion and fire in Wilmington, Delaware. A contractor hired by the city of Wilmington to replace sidewalk and curbing, dug into an unmarked natural gas service line with a backhoe. Although the service line did not leak where it was struck, the contact resulted in a break in the line inside the basement of a nearby building, where gas began to accumulate. A manager for the contractor said that he did not smell gas and therefore did not believe there was imminent danger and that he called an employee of the gas company and left a voice mail message. At approximately 1:44 p.m., an explosion destroyed two residences and damaged two others to the extent that they had to be demolished. Other nearby residences sustained some damage, and the residents on the block were displaced from their houses for about a week. Three contractor employees sustained serious injuries. Eleven additional people sustained minor injuries. * On July 3, a jury found Texas-New Mexico Pipeline (TNMP) Company guilty of fraud, gross negligence and willful misconduct in concealing a 1992 crude oil pipeline leak beneath a Midland, Texas residential subdivision, before selling the pipeline to EOTT Energy in 1999. Oil was discovered in the water table in late 2000, and in March 2001 a group of Midland residents sued EOTT, TNMP and Equilon. Residents living on affected land also received settlements. The spill was estimated in 2003 to be 9,000‚Äì13,000 barrels. 190 boxes full of TNMP documents about the pipeline dating from the late 1980s to early 1990s (prior to EOTT Energy taking over the pipeline) were dug up from a 45-foot-deep hole at a site along the company's pipeline in New Mexico. * On July 10, a 16-inch diameter Citgo petroleum products pipeline failed in Cook County, Illinois. About 25 barrels of gasoline were spilled from the pipeline. A crack in the pipe had developed at a dent. There was no fire or injuries reported. * On July 16, a 12 3/4-inch pipeline burst in Barnes County, North Dakota, releasing 9,000 barrels of propane, which ignited. There were no casualties. During repairs, mechanical damage was seen on 2 nearby sections of this pipeline. * On July 30, a Kinder Morgan pipeline in Tucson, Arizona ruptured and sprayed 16,548 gallons of gasoline on five houses under construction, flooding nearby streets with gasoline. The resulting pipeline closure caused major gas shortages and price increases in the state. The failure at first was thought to be from LF ERW flaws, but tests showed it was due to stress corrosion cracking. A hydrostatic test that was performed on this pipeline after repairs failed again from the first failure. * On August 8, a 26-inch Kinder Morgan and Myria Holdings Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America transmission pipeline ruptured in Caddo County, Oklahoma, releasing about 84,000 MCF of natural gas. A 54-foot long section of 26\\" diameter pipe had blown out and landed 30 feet from the ditch. Evacuations took place within 3/4 of a mile from the release, but there was no fire or casualties. Stress corrosion cracking was identified as the pipe failure's cause. The 26-inch diameter pipe was manufactured in 1956. * On September 26, a propane pipeline at the Phillips Petroleum storage facility in Cahokia, Illinois ruptured, sending flames high into the air and sparking small grass fires in the area. * On October 6, a 12-inch petroleum products pipeline ruptured in Johnson County, Kansas, spilling about 100 to 200 barrels of diesel fuel. Some of the fuel contaminated a nearby waterway. There were no injuries. * On October 13, a failure on an Enbridge pipeline near Bay City, Michigan spilled 500 barrels of crude oil. * On October 14, a leak on what was originally the Big Inch 24-inch diameter natural gas transmission pipeline occurred in Orange County, Indiana. There were no injuries or evacuations. The longitudinal crack was attributed to external corrosion; the pipe had been installed in 1943. * On November 2, a Texas Eastern Transmission Pipeline natural gas pipeline exploded, in Bath County, Kentucky, about 1.5 km south of a Duke Energy pumping station. A fire burned for about an hour before firefighters extinguished it. No one was injured and no property damage was reported. Investigators found that the pipe, manufactured in 1957, had two separate manufacturing defects. * On November 9, an 8-inch Buckeye Partners pipeline failed near Mazon, Illinois. While repairs were being tested on this pipeline on November 14, another section of this pipeline failed about 1500 feet from the first leak. About ten barrels of gasoline and diesel fuel were spilled by the two leaks, requiring soil removal. External corrosion caused both failures. There were no injuries. * On December 13, another section of the same Williams Companies gas transmission pipeline that failed on May 1, 2003, failed in Lewis County, Washington. There was no fire this time. Gas flowed for three hours before being shut off. Gas pressure had already been reduced 20% on this pipeline after the May 1 explosion. External corrosion and stress corrosion cracking were seen in this 26-inch diameter pipe, which had been manufactured in 1956.

They were built from 1893 to 1894. They are also known as Corana & Hygeia Victorian Terraces, Corona, Randwick Lodge and has recently re-branded to The Lurline. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Indigenous history= Pre-1780s the local Aboriginal people in the area used the site for fishing and cultural activities; rock engravings, grinding grooves and middens remain in evidence. In 1789 Governor Arthur Phillip referred to \\"a long bay\\", which became known as Long Bay. Aboriginal people are believed to have inhabited the Sydney region for at least 20,000 years.Turbet, 2001. The population of Aboriginal people between Palm Beach and Botany Bay in 1788 has been estimated to have been 1,500. Those living south of Port Jackson to Botany Bay were the Cadigal people who spoke Dharug,Randwick Library webpage, 2003. while the local clan name of Maroubra people was \\"Muru-ora-dial\\".City of Sydney webpage, 2003 By the mid nineteenth century the traditional owners of this land had typically either moved inland in search of food and shelter, or had died as the result of European disease or confrontation with British colonisers. =Colonial history= One of the earliest land grants in this area was made in 1824 to Captain Francis Marsh, who received bounded by the present Botany and High Streets, Alison and Belmore Roads. In 1839 William Newcombe acquired the land north-west of the present town hall in Avoca Street. Randwick takes its name from the town of Randwick, Gloucestershire, England. The name was suggested by Simeon Pearce (1821‚Äì86) and his brother James. Simeon was born in the English Randwick and the brothers were responsible for the early development of both Randwick and its neighbour, Coogee. Simeon had come to the colony in 1841 as a 21 year old surveyor. He built his Blenheim House on the he bought from Marsh, and called his property \\"Randwick\\". The brothers bought and sold land profitably in the area and elsewhere. Simeon campaigned for construction of a road from the city to Coogee (achieved in 1853) and promoted the incorporation of the suburb. Pearce sought construction of a church modelled on the church of St. John in his birthplace. In 1857 the first St Jude's stood on the site of the present post office, at the corner of the present Alison Road and Avoca Street.Pollen & Healy, 1988. Randwick was slow to progress. The village was isolated from Sydney by swamps and sandhills, and although a horse-bus was operated by a man named Grice from the late 1850s, the journey was more a test of nerves than a pleasure jaunt. Wind blew sand over the track, and the bus sometimes became bogged, so that passengers had to get out and push it free. From its early days Randwick had a divided society. The wealthy lived elegantly in large houses built when Pearce promoted Randwick and Coogee as a fashionable area. But the market gardens, orchards and piggeries that continued alongside the large estates were the lot of the working class. Even on the later estates that became racing empires, many jockeys and stablehands lived in huts or even under canvas. An even poorer group were the immigrants who existed on the periphery of Randwick in a place called Irishtown, in the area now known as The Spot, around the junction of St.Paul's Street and Perouse Road. Here families lived in makeshift houses, taking on the most menial tasks in their struggle to survive. In 1858 when the NSW Government passed the Municipalities Act, enabling formation of municipal districts empowered to collect rates and borrow money to improve their suburb, Randwick was the first suburb to apply for the status of a municipality. It was approved in February 1859, and its first Council was elected in March 1859. Randwick had been the venue for sporting events, as well as duels and illegal sports, from the early days in the colony's history. Its first racecourse, the Sandy Racecourse or Old Sand Track, had been a hazardous track over hills and gullies since 1860. When a move was made in 1863 by John Tait, to establish Randwick Racecourse, Simeon Pearce was furious, especially when he heard that Tait also intended to move into Byron Lodge. Tait's venture prospered, however and he became the first person in Australia to organise racing as a commercial sport. The racecourse made a big difference to the progress of Randwick. The horse-bus gave way to trams that linked the suburb to Sydney and civilisation. Randwick soon became a prosperous and lively place, and it still retains a busy residential, professional and commercial life. Today, some of the houses have been replaced by home units. Many European migrants have made their homes in the area, along with students and workers at the nearby University of NSW and the Prince of Wales Hospital. =Corona and Hygeia= Corona and Hygeia, pictured in 2014. The site of Corona and Hygeia is part of an original crown grant purchased in 1853 by Judge Callaghan, Chairman of the Court of Quarter Sessions, Sydney. Judge Callaghan built and occupied Avoca which stood opposite Nugal Hall at 16-18 Milford Street Randwick. He died in 1863. His widow, Elizabeth and his daughter Mary Milford Auber Jones, built the two large attached houses at 211-215 Avoca Street, Randwick apparently for rental. According to Randwick Municipal Rate Books the two houses were under construction in 1893 and were completed in 1894. From 1894 until 1897, only one of the houses was occupied that on the corner of Mears Avenue. From 1895 to 1898, it was used as a house and post office before the Present post office in Randwick was opened. The occupant was J A Kelly, the postmaster. In 1898, the post office and Mr Kelly moved, and for the first time the other house was occupied. In 1898, both houses were occupied and the occupants listed in the Sands Directory were J. Mills, Corona and J. Middleton Hygeia. 1898 was the first year the names Corona and Hygeia appear. Other occupiers listed in the Sands directory include: *1918 ‚Äì Doctors G. Lindeman and G.H Broniowski Corona *1911-1944 ‚Äì A.E. Booth Dentist After 1919, the names Corona and Hygeia are no longer used. In 1925, Hygeia was listed as flats. On 20 November 1984, the property was sold at auction. In January 1984, the Heritage Branch received representations from the National Trust of Australia (NSW) concerned at the deteriorated state and vacancy of the building. An Interim Conservation Order was placed over the building on 31 August 1984 to provide time to investigate its significance and to determine whether its conservation was warranted. On 9 April 1986, the Minister gave public notice of an intention to make a Permanent Conservation Order over the property. An objection was subsequently lodged by the owners of the property and a Commission of Inquiry was held on 10 September 1986. Following further discussion with the owner the objection was withdrawn. A Permanent Conservation Order was made over the property on 22 January 1988. On the 2 April 1999, it was transferred to the State Heritage Register. The building is currently used as rental accommodation.Heritage Branch files  Description  Corona and Hygeia are an attached pair of large semi-detached mansions designed in the late Victorian Italianate style. Stucco finished with heavily decorated balustered roof parapets and classically derived pediments over the bowed section of the front fa√ßade and as decoration over the window lintels. Deep string course mouldings extend around the side elevations. The verandahs at the front and back retain richly decorative iron lace valances and cast iron columns. Ground floor front verandahs are attractively tiled. Original roof believed to be of slate and now covered in tiles. Internal joinery to the main rooms mainly intact. Stair halls to both house and balustrades. A distinguishing feature of the houses is the use of native bird motifs in the internal d√©cor. These occur in the coloured leadlight windows at the stair half landings and in the highlights above the front windows. Bird motifs are also found in the keystone of the arch of one of the fireplace surrounds and in the hearth tiles.Heritage Office files = Condition = As at 15 September 2011, the archaeological potential is low. = Modifications and dates = *1985 ‚Äì approval for interior/exterior painting; repair to damaged plaster, architraves, skirting boards and flooring; repair roofing and guttering and tiling to front verandah. *1994 ‚Äì restoration and adaptive reuse into residential accommodation  Heritage listing  As at 19 September 2011, Corana and Hygeia are of State heritage significance as two semi-detached mansions in the late Victorian style and constructed in 1898.

He also represented England at amateur level, scoring a hat- trick on his debut in 1938. Early life Anderson was born in Peckham in 1916 to William Thomas Anderson and Ellen Leete Anderson (n√©e Strickland). He grew up in Dulwich, attending Wilson's School. He later became a teacher. Career After playing football for his local school, he joined Dulwich Hamlet at the age of eighteen in 1934. Two years later, he made his debut for the club's first team and quickly established himself in the squad, winning the FA Amateur Cup final 2‚Äì0 against Leyton in 1937. His form for Dulwich led to him being called up to the England national amateur football team, scoring a hat-trick in his first match during an 8‚Äì2 victory over Wales playing alongside Dulwich teammate William Parr. He made two further appearances for the side in the following year, both in matches against Scotland, without scoring. His performances for the England amateur side attracted attention from several Football League clubs and he eventually joined Third Division South side Cardiff City. He made his professional debut on 15 April 1939 in a match against Notts County. Two days later, he played in the reverse fixture against County, scoring once during a 4‚Äì1 victory for Cardiff. Following the outbreak of World War II, the Football League was suspended and Anderson was briefly retained as an amateur with Cardiff before rejoining Dulwich. World War II Anderson enlisted with the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, being assigned to 106 squadron as a Sgt. Observer.

Biography  Tartu University, 1860. Henzi was born on 7 September 1794 in Bern, Switzerland, where he received his primary and university education. During his stay at the University of Bern, he spent three years studying philosophy, then theology. In 1816, according to the Swiss custom of ordination, he was accepted as a candidate for church duties, after which he studied theology in T√ºbingen for another year, and from 1817 to 1818 studied the history in G√∂ttingen. Upon his return, he was appointed vicar in Unterseen, but in the fall of 1818 he resigned his post and, wishing to fill his knowledge of the Eastern languages, went to Paris, where he studied Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit languages under Sylvestre de Sacy. After spending some time in Great Britain, Henzi returned to his homeland in the summer of 1819, wishing to devote himself to academic activity. At this time, the Department of Exegesis and Oriental Languages was inaugurated at the University of Tartu, where he was elected to the University Council, and on 5 March 1820, he was appointed Ordinary Professor. Even before his departure, Henzi received a degree as a Doctor of Theology at University of T√ºbingen for processing part of the still unreleased Arabic commentary of Al-Baydawi on the Quran. On 30 August 1820, he delivered an introductory lecture: \\"√úber Verh√§ltniss der Schriften des Alten und Neuen Testaments zu einander nach Inhalt und Form\\". In addition to lectures on Exegesis, he also gave lectures on Eastern languages, led practical exercises on Exegesis in the theological seminary, and during the 1822‚Äì1823 academic year Henzi temporarily supervised practical classes \\"on the Gospel pericopam\\". In 1821, he became director of the Tartu Branch of the Russian Bible Society, and in 1822, a member of the school commission. He was elected dean of the theological faculty four times.

It was built from 1847 to 1848. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Indigenous history= Pre-1780s - local Aboriginal people in the area used the site for fishing and cultural activities; rock engravings, grinding grooves and middens remain in evidence. In 1789 Governor Arthur Phillip referred to \\"a long bay\\", which became known as Long Bay. Aboriginal people are believed to have inhabited the Sydney region for at least 20,000 years.Turbet, 2001. The population of Aboriginal people between Palm Beach and Botany Bay in 1788 has been estimated to have been 1500. Those living south of Port Jackson to Botany Bay were the Cadigal people who spoke Dharug,Randwick Library webpage, 2003. while the local clan name of Maroubra people was \\"Muru- ora-dial\\".City of Sydney webpage, 2003 By the mid nineteenth century the traditional owners of this land had typically either moved inland in search of food and shelter, or had died as the result of European disease or confrontation with British colonisers. =Colonial history= One of the earliest land grants in this area was made in 1824 to Captain Francis Marsh, who received bounded by the present Botany and High Streets, Alison and Belmore Roads. In 1839 William Newcombe acquired the land north-west of the present town hall in Avoca Street. Randwick takes its name from the town of Randwick, Gloucestershire, England. The name was suggested by Simeon Pearce (1821‚Äì86) and his brother James. Simeon was born in the English Randwick and the brothers were responsible for the early development of both Randwick and its neighbour, Coogee. Simeon had come to the colony in 1841 as a 21 year old surveyor. He built his Blenheim House on the he bought from Marsh, and called his property \\"Randwick\\". The brothers bought and sold land profitably in the area and elsewhere. Simeon campaigned for construction of a road from the city to Coogee (achieved in 1853) and promoted the incorporation of the suburb. Pearce sought construction of a church modelled on the church of St. John in his birthplace. In 1857 the first St Jude's stood on the site of the present post office, at the corner of the present Alison Road and Avoca Street.Pollen & Healy, 1988. Randwick was slow to progress. The village was isolated from Sydney by swamps and sandhills, and although a horse-bus was operated by a man named Grice from the late 1850s, the journey was more a test of nerves than a pleasure jaunt. Wind blew sand over the track, and the bus sometimes became bogged, so that passengers had to get out and push it free. From its early days Randwick had a divided society. The wealthy lived elegantly in large houses built when Pearce promoted Randwick and Coogee as a fashionable area. But the market gardens, orchards and piggeries that continued alongside the large estates were the lot of the working class. Even on the later estates that became racing empires, many jockeys and stablehands lived in huts or even under canvas. An even poorer group were the immigrants who existed on the periphery of Randwick in a place called Irishtown, in the area now known as The Spot, around the junction of St.Paul's Street and Perouse Road. Here families lived in makeshift houses, taking on the most menial tasks in their struggle to survive. In 1858 when the NSW Government passed the Municipalities Act, enabling formation of municipal districts empowered to collect rates and borrow money to improve their suburb, Randwick was the first suburb to apply for the status of a municipality. It was approved in February 1859, and its first Council was elected in March 1859. Randwick had been the venue for sporting events, as well as duels and illegal sports, from the early days in the colony's history. Its first racecourse, the Sandy Racecourse or Old Sand Track, had been a hazardous track over hills and gullies since 1860. When a move was made in 1863 by John Tait, to establish Randwick Racecourse, Simeon Pearce was furious, especially when he heard that Tait also intended to move into Byron Lodge. Tait's venture prospered, however and he became the first person in Australia to organise racing as a commercial sport. The racecourse made a big difference to the progress of Randwick. The horse-bus gave way to trams that linked the suburb to Sydney and civilisation. Randwick soon became a prosperous and lively place, and it still retains a busy residential, professional and commercial life. Today, some of the houses have been replaced by home units. Many European migrants have made their homes in the area, along with students and workers at the nearby University of NSW and the Prince of Wales Hospital. =Hooper Cottage's land= 19th century image of George and Mary Hopper, and son. Land originally a Crown grant to Captain Marsh in 1824. In 1847 Alderman, Council auditor and one of area's first residents, market gardener George Hooper bought the of land for orchards and market gardens, and built the first (single storey) cottage in the same year on about as a farmhouse. In 1848 Hooper builds vernacular two-storey Georgian house with courtyard, and converts original cottage to kitchen/servants' quarters. the name Figtree Avenue first appears on a map (street to west of cottage). In 1864 George Hooper leaves for Queensland, making Simeon Pearce his trustee. The estate and house left in trust to Hooper's wife Mary. Pearce was actively trying to entice wealthy residents to the Randwick area, and Hooper was a friend of the Pearce family. George's brother, James Hooper, worked as a market gardener on Randwick Road in 1858/9 (Sands Directory), and from 1865-1880 James was listed as living in Orange Street; name changed to Gilderthorpe Avenue sometime after 1925. In the 1840-80 period of market gardens and orchards in area, supplying close by City Markets. Occupants of Hooper's cottage were market gardeners. 1887 the cottage was bought by Catherine Hooper, widow of James Hooper, and her daughter Mary Ann McQuigan.

During 1979 the cottage (deceased estate of Elizabeth Aveline McGuigan) was put on the market for sale and the Heritage Council of NSW received representations from the Randwick and District Historical Society and Randwick Council seeking a conservation order. On 4 January 1980 an Interim Conservation Order was placed over the property. On 12 February a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the property. In 1985 Randwick Council closes off southern end of Figtree Avenue and makes road closure park, 2 Hill's figs (Ficus hillii) in park outside Hooper's Cottage date from -40.

Heritage listing  As at 14 September 2011, Hooper Cottage has historic significance as the second-oldest building remaining, the oldest farmhouse building and the only remaining building illustrative of working class cottages in the Randwick Municipal Area in what was once a rural setting. Hooper Cottage has the ability to demonstrate a way of life in early Randwick and Sydney through its role in housing market gardeners who supplied the City's markets. The cottage has social significance for its ability to illustrate 19th century lifestyles and perceptions. The contrasts in scale and finishes between the kitchen area to the rear (which may have been servant's quarters) and the vernacular Georgian house market gardener George Hooper built illustrate perceptions of social status in the 19th century. Architecturally and aesthetically significant as an increasingly rare sandstone worker's cottage which was converted to servant's quarters/kitchen block, and an intact example of vernacular Georgian domestic architecture.J.

One of the largest rebel factions active in Aleppo Governorate during the early civil war, the militia played a major part in the fighting for Aleppo city and other battles. As result of conflicts with government forces, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and the Syrian Democratic Forces, it declined after 2013. The Conquest Brigade became part of the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army (TFSA) in 2016.  History  = Early civil war = Colonel Haytham Darwish (left) and First Lieutenant Rifaat Khalil (right) announce the formation of the Conquest Brigade in Tell Rifaat, north of Aleppo, 31 July 2012. The Conquest Brigade was founded at Tell Rifaat in late July 2012 as unification of three rebel groups that had previously operated in the countryside of northern Aleppo Governorate. Its initial member groups included 1st Lt. Rifaat Khalil's relatively powerful Muthanna ibn Haritha Battalion, the Ghuraba al-Sham (Strangers of the Levant) Battalion, and the Dir al-Wafa (Shield of Loyalty) Battalion. From its beginning, the Conquest Brigade declared its membership in the Free Syrian Army and Aleppo Military Council, and also joined the Syrian Islamic Liberation Front in September 2012. The group was initially only active in the rural northern Aleppo Governorate, and one of its first actions was the Battle of Anadan. It also helped to lay siege to the government-held towns of Nubl and al-Zahraa. The Conquest Brigade later expanded its operations, taking part in the Battle of Aleppo (2012‚Äì2016). It also fought in Raqqa Governorate and al-Hasakah Governorate; its Ghuraba al-Sham Battalion took part in the capture of Tell Abyad and its border crossing with Ak√ßakale in September 2012. By the end of August 2012, a Conquest Brigade commander, Major Anas Ibrahim (\\"Abu Zeid\\"), claimed to have 1,300 fighters on 6 fronts in Aleppo city, who contributed to the rebel capture of more than half of the city, and 500 more around the governorate. By late 2012 and early 2013, the Conquest Brigade was already close to various radical rebel factions, fighting and working alongside them. It cooperated with the al-Tawhid Brigade, and three Salafist / Salafi jihadist groups (al-Nusra Front, Ahrar al-Sham, and Harakat Fajr ash-Sham al-Islamiya) to establish al-Hay'a al-Sharia in Aleppo. This was a unified judicial and religious authority that was supposed to implement the Sharia in the city. Furthermore, the Conquest Brigade also grew close to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), for example cooperating with ISIL's JAMWA sub-unit during the Siege of Menagh Air Base in rural Aleppo. In contrast to its good relations with various Islamist factions, the Conquest Brigade's relationship with the Syrian opposition's leadership, including the civilian SNC and the FSA's chief commanders, was more ambivalent. The group reportedly did not \\"listen to the orders of the regional leaders of the FSA\\", though was ready to meet with SNC senior member Samir Nashar in September 2012 to discuss a stronger cooperation with other rebel factions, such as the al-Nusra Front and the al-Tawhid Brigade. The Conquest Brigade did also not support a public statement by 14 Aleppo rebel groups in the same month that denounced the SNC. When rebel groups in Aleppo eventually released another, more moderate video statement in November, however, the Conquest Brigade officially supported it. A commander in the group, Captain Ismail Nadef (\\"Abu Mahmoud\\"), also said in October 2012 that several of the Conquest Brigade's subgroups included Kurds in their ranks, and the group itself had established contacts with the leftist Democratic Union Party (PYD); it nonetheless disagreed with the PYD due to its ideology and affiliation with the PKK. The militia's Ghuraba al-Sham Battalion reportedly took part in the rebel conquest of Raqqa in March 2013, though left the Conquest Brigade some time later. In August 2013, the group was prominently involved in the final rebel assault on Menagh Air Base, and produced \\"slick\\" propaganda videos about the base's fall. = Conflict with ISIL and the SDF = A T-62 tank jointly operated by the Conquest Brigade and the al-Tawhid Brigade in September 2013 Though it had enjoyed cordial relations with ISIL during the early civil war, the Conquest Brigade distanced itself from the jihadists after disagreeing with their harsh policies toward civilians in course of late 2013. The group consequently fought alongside other rebel groups against ISIL. In September 2013, it and the al-Tawhid Brigade sent some of their forces from Aleppo to al-Salameh to fortify it against an expected ISIL attack. Around this time, the Supreme Military Council's head Salim Idris brokered a merger of the Conquest Brigade and the al-Tawhid Brigade, with the two units holding a ceremony to facilitate their unification. They claimed to have a united strength of 13,000 fighters across all of Syria. On 3 February 2014, the Conquest Brigade and the al-Tawhid Brigade unsuccessfully attempted to defend al-Rai from ISIL. Later that month, the militia took part in a counter-offensive against ISIL in the northern Aleppo Governorate, fighting alongside the Kurdish Front Brigade and Descendants of Messengers Brigade to recapture some areas near Menagh. The group became part of the Fatah Halab joint operations room sometime before October 2015, and joined the Ahrar al-Sham movement in November 2015. In February 2016, the Conquest Brigade was expelled from some of its territory in the northern Aleppo countryside, including its main bases in Tell Rifaat and Menagh Air Base, by the Syrian Democratic Forces' YPG, YPJ, and Army of Revolutionaries in the course of a Russian-backed offensive. This event caused great resentment among the Conquest Brigade, and resulted in a lasting enmity toward the SDF. The loss of its main bases might have also contributed to the group's decision to leave Ahrar al-Sham on 24 February. In the following months, ISIL also launched an offensive against the FSA forces in the northern countryside of Aleppo. As result, elements of the Conquest Brigade were put under siege in Mare', with the SDF cutting them off from the west, while ISIL forces were located to the east. The siege was broken in June 2016, with a newly formed FSA alliance evicting ISIL from the town's outskirts. The Conquest Brigade was one of 20 rebel factions that rejected the ceasefire between government and opposition groups in September 2016, arguing that the agreement aided the government and also denouncing the exclusion of the al- Nusra Front (by then \\"Jabhat Fatah al-Sham\\") from the ceasefire. By August 2016, the Conquest Brigade had become part of the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army (TFSA), and aided the Turkish Armed Forces during Operation Euphrates Shield against ISIL. The militia joined the Levant Front in March 2017, while also becoming part of the Division 33, a Levant Front-affiliated unit within the TFSA's 3rd Legion. The unit then took part in the Turkish-led conquest of the DFNS' Afrin Canton from the SDF in early 2018. At the time, it was commanded by \\"Abu Ahmad Aleppo\\". After occupying Afrin city, members of the militia took part in large-scale looting of civilian properties. Thereafter, the Conquest Brigade conducted counter-insurgency operations in the Afrin area, and was reportedly targeted by YPG/YPJ guerrilla attacks.  Ideology  Video of the militia's official foundation The Conquest Brigade's stated aim has been to overthrow the al-Assad family's rule over Syria, and to establish a \\"Free Syrian government\\". The group is \\"religiously conservative\\" and follows a Sunni Islamist and Syrian nationalist ideology. By late 2012, it was not yet Salafist, but still supported a declaration in November 2012 that called for the establishment of a \\"state that rules according to the law of God\\" in Syria. By 2013, the militia was considered to be \\"moderate Islamist\\" in its views by some observers, though it already exhibited strong links to ISIL by this stage. While besieging Menagh Military Airbase in August 2013, the group's members voiced their support for ISIL's plan to exterminate all Alawites (a religious minority) in a propaganda video. The Conquest Brigade had partially adopted the ideology of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant by this point, though distanced itself from Salafi jihadism after its violent split with ISIL. Despite this, the group continued to be sympathic toward radical Islamist groups, even joining the hardline Salafist Ahrar al-Sham movement for four months in 2015/16. Nonetheless, a regional expert claimed in February 2016 that the Conquest Brigade was neither Jihadist nor Salafist, and just a \\"nationalist group unconnected to Nusra\\", though also described Ahrar al-Sham (of which the militia was a part at the time) as \\"close battlefield ally of Nusra's\\". The militia claims to respect human rights and protect civilians, but is known for violently suppressing opposing political activists. The Conquest Brigade's views on an international intervention against the Syrian government changed over time. A commander of the Conquest Brigade stated in 2013 that his unit was not in favour of American-led invasion, though also said that the United States would find a \\"very powerful ally on the ground\\" in form of the militia in case they should enter the Syrian Civil War. By late 2016, however, the unit was considered loyal to the Turkish government and fully supported the Turkish occupation of northern Syria.  Organization  = Constituent militias = Fighters of the \\"Secret of √ñmer Seyfettin\\" unit, one of the sub-groups of the Conquest Brigade The Conquest Brigade is an umbrella formation for various sub-units of varying strength. By August 2012, the militia claimed to consist of 27 battalions. Of these, the following are known: *Muthanna ibn Haritha Battalion *Ghuraba al- Sham Battalion *Dir al-Wafa Battalion *Bara ibn Malik Battalion *Turkman Bareh Battalion * Missile and Engineering Battalion * Arfad Martyrs' Battalion * Secret of √ñmer Seyfettin unit = Military strength = The Conquest Brigade in combat in al-Midan neighborhood of Aleppo, September 2012 Though eclipsed in its prominence and military prowess by several other rebel groups, the Conquest Brigade was a relatively powerful and influential fighting force during the early civil war. It claimed to have about 2,500 fighters in August 2012, of which 1,800 were active in Aleppo Governorate. The group was one of the largest armed opposition militias in Aleppo city at the time. At least one of its sub-groups, the Muthanna ibn Haritha Battalion, possessed tanks, technicals, and PK machine guns in 2012, while the militia as whole had anti- tank warfare capabilities and produced its own homemade rockets and improvised explosive devices. By December 2015, the Conquest Brigade had just 600 fighters left. It had increased in strength by late 2018, with about 500 fighters stationed in the Afrin area, while 300 were posted in the northern Aleppo area. The militia received foreign aid in form of weapons and other military equipment, most prominently by Turkey and Saudi Arabia. By 2012/13, the group also had links to the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Syrian businessman Firas Tlass organized a meeting of the group's representatives with CIA agents in Gaziantep in August 2012, with the latter promising the former telecommunications equipment, and possibly weapons in case that the Conquest Brigade proved itself to be reliable. By 2018, the Afrin-based Conquest Brigade troops were supplied by Turkey, though those in the northern Aleppo countryside were not.

She was married to fellow collector John Bowes. She is one of the founders of the Bowes Museum.  Early life  The Bowes Museum records that her father was a clockmaker. She became an actress in Paris under the stage name Mlle Delorme. She was a vaudeville performer - an actress, comedienne, and singer - in the Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s during the period when John Bowes purchased and managed the theatre. She found they had a mutual love of the arts, and it is believed that they began a relationship soon after they met in 1847. After their marriage in 1852 she retired from the stage to concentrate on her painting and art collecting, and she is known to have commissioned plays from playwrights.Illingworth, J. (2017). The French Library of John and Jos√©phine Bowes. Published in: French Studies Library Group Annual Review. Illingworth, J. (2017). URL: https://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/files/153741105/The_French_Library_of_John_and_Jos_phine_Bowes.pdf As a wedding present, John Bowes bought her the former home of one of King Louis XV's mistresses, the Chateau du Barry.  Artist and patron of the arts  Coffin-Chevallier was a talented amateur artist who studied under the landscape painter Karl Josef Kuwasseg. Her work was exhibited at both the Paris Salon on four occasions in the late 1860s, and once at the Royal Academy, which was an unusual achievement for a woman of the time. The Bowes Museum still holds fifty-five of her paintings in its collection, most of which are landscapes. After her marriage to John Bowes she became a noted hostess, as well as a patron of the arts on a grand scale. The Revue Critique wrote of her 1860s gatherings of artists, intellectuals, and French society that 'the salons of Madame Bowes are counted among the most brilliant in Paris'. She was celebrated for her taste in fashion and jewellery, and an 1872 bill from one of her visits to the foremost couturier of the day, Charles Worth, comes to the equivalent of ¬£114,000 in modern currency. She is known to have sold some of the most valuable of her diamonds in order to fund the completion of the Bowes Museum. In 1868 Bowes purchased the title of Countess of Montalbo for his wife, from the nation of San Marino, to elevate her status.  Founding the Bowes Museum  In the 1860s, Coffin-Chevallier conceived the idea of founding a museum filled with the already substantial collections of her husband. Her vision was to create a place where the local coal miners and farmers could encounter fine art and improve their lives. She sold the Chateau du Barry, in order to raise funds for the project, and is widely credited by the museum as the driving force behind the project. The pair began the collection specifically destined for a museum in Bowes' ancestral lands in Teesdale in 1862. The couple commissioned the architect Jules Pellechet, who had already worked with them in France, to design a museum in Barnard Castle, which was the town nearest to John's family home, Streatlam Castle. In the next twelve years, fifteen thousand objects were purchased to fill the projected building; as with other female collectors of the time Coffin-Chevallier collected pieces across a broad spectrum. From the records that are left, Bowes collection archivists surmise that Coffin- Chevallier used her own artistic eye in collecting decorative arts pieces such as ceramics, silverware, and tapestries. She also made extensive purchases from the International Exhibitions held in Paris in 1862, 1867, and in London in 1871. Her purchases of paintings benefited from her friendships with young artists, and she also worked with two Parisian dealers, Mme Lepautre and A. Lamer, who left annotated records of their dealings, which are still held by the museum. She purchased works by artists as diverse as El Greco, Cannaletto, Boucher, Anne Vallayer-Coster, Courbet, and Charles Joshua Chaplin. At the ceremony to mark the laying of the foundation stone in 1869, Coffin-Chevallier reportedly said to her husband: ‚ÄòI lay the bottom stone, and you, Mr Bowes, will lay the top stone‚Äô. The museum building, in the style of a French chateau, was not to be completed until 1892. Coffin-Chevallier would not live to see it completed. She had experienced bouts of ill health since the 1850s, and died of lung disease at the age of forty-eight in Paris on 9 February 1874. Even in the last days of her life she is known to have spent time ensuring new items of the museum collection were sent to Teesdale.

The business was Northampton's largest employer for decades.The Invention of Machine Twist: the Nonotuck Silk Company, from moths to millions University of Nebraska - Lincoln, DigitalCommons@University of Nebraska - Lincoln, Textile Society of America Symposium Proceedings Textile Society of America, 2002, by Marjorie Senechal, Smith Colleg Print of the Nonotuck Silk Company exhibition at the 14th Exhibition of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association in Boston, Massachusetts September-October 1881 In 1855, Samuel L. Hill, the spiritual leader of the Northampton Association of Education and Industry, invented a machine that could spin silk smooth enough to be used in sewing machines. After the commune dissolved, Hill took over the factory and ran it as the Nonotuck Silk Company. Hill's home at 31-35 Maple Street in Florence served as a stop for the Underground Railway. The company changed its name again and as the Corticelli Silk Company grew to be one of the world's largest producers of silk thread. The thread was made with raw silk imported from Japan. In New York City, the Corticelli logo‚Äîa kitten playing with a spool of thread‚Äîloomed over Broadway from a huge electrical sign at 42nd Street between 1910 and 1913. In 1922, the Nonotuck Silk Company and the Brainerd and Armstrong Company merged and ten years later the Corticelli Silk Company merged with the Belding-Hemingway Company. The company went out of business in 1930. Grove Hill Mansion was built in 1880 for one of the company's directors. The Smithsonian Museum of American History has a collection of their trade catalogs.

The smaller guyot in the lower left corner is Gelendzhik Guyot. Ita Mai Tai is a Cretaceous-early Cenozoic seamount northwest of the Marshall Islands and north of Micronesia. One among a number of seamounts in the Pacific Ocean, it is part of the Magellan Seamounts which may have a hotspot origin although Ita Mai Tai itself may not have formed on a hotspot. The seamount is formed by volcanic rocks which form two adjacent volcanic centres that erupted between the Aptian-Albian and possibly as late as the Pliocene. Reef systems developed on the seamount after its formation and led to the deposition of limestones. Especially during the Oligocene the seamount subsided and lies now at depth below sea level. Ferromanganese crusts as well as pelagic oozes were deposited on the submerged rocks.  Name and research history  The name Ita Mai Tai comes from the Tahitian language and means \\"no damn good\\". The name was coined by Bruce C. Heezen and is probably a reference to unsuccessful attempts to obtain drill cores during the early research history of the seamount. The seamount has also been named OSM1, Ita Matai and Weijia Guyot. The Deep Sea Drilling Project drill cores 202, 201 and 200 were taken at Ita Mai Tai, a drill site selection that was motivated in part by technical problems in the drilling equipment. In addition, in 2016 the submersible Jiaolong sampled the seamount.  Geography and geology  = Regional = The Pacific Ocean seafloor is characterized by a striking contrast between the relatively flat floor of the Eastern Pacific and the Western Pacific whose seafloor is dotted by oceanic plateaus and seamounts. These structures may have formed on top of large Cretaceous uplift episodes, moving hotspots, mid-ocean ridges and transform faults. Ita Mai Tai is considered to be part of the Magellan Seamounts, a chain of seamounts that extends northwest away from this seamount, and one of their best studied members. The activity of the Magellan Seamounts has been attributed to a hotspot in the South Pacific, but attributing Ita Mai Tai to such a hotspot is difficult as Ita Mai Tai appears to be too old in comparison to the other Magellan Seamounts to be a product of the same hotspot. The Rarotonga hotspot, Samoa hotspot and Society hotspot appear to coincide with the reconstructed location of the Magellan Seamounts hotspot; one of these may have formed the Magellan Seamounts. = Local = Ita Mai Tai has a flat summit with a surface area of , and a slope break at about depth. Unconsolidated sediments cover the summit platform. There is evidence that the flat summit was a lagoon surrounded by a coral reef, and the volcanic basement forms an uplift in the central section of the flat summit. Volcanic cones form swells on the western part of the summit plateau of Ita Mai Tai, and structures such as domes, ridges, scarps, steps and terraces are dispersed all over the seamount. The seamount is about high and reaches a depth of below sea level. On the seafloor, it occupies a surface of , making it much larger than other Pacific seamounts, and is surrounded by a shallow moat on the northern and southeastern side. The outer slopes of the seamount have a step-like appearance and feature radial grabens formed presumably by subsidence. At their foot, sediments descending from the seamount have formed talus deposits. The seamount has several rift zones crosscut by dykes and sills and features an \\"L\\"-shaped ridge to the west with a width of . South of the \\"L\\"-shaped ridge lies another seamount which is also considered to be part of Ita Mai Tai; it is uneroded and features parasitic vents. The ridge that connects the two may be the western edge of a collapse caldera. This wide and deep southern seamount is also known as Gelendzhik Seamount after a research ship of the same name and forms a volcano-tectonic massif with Ita Mai Tai; thus it consists of two separate volcanoes. The seamount lies on the eastern margin of the Mariana Basin. The lack of magnetic lineations on the seafloor surrounding Ita Mai Tai makes it difficult to tell how old the ocean crust is. However, during the Aptian neighbouring volcanic islands deposited volcanic rocks on the seafloor and the crust is now considered to be of Jurassic age. The Ogasawara Fracture Zone passes just north of Ita Mai Tai; seamounts in the neighbourhood are Butakov in the south, Arirang in the southeast, Zatonskii east, Gramberg northeast and Fedorov north-northwest. = Composition = Among the rocks found at Ita Mai Tai are alkali basalts, basalts, clays, hawaiites, limestone, muds, picrites, tholeiites, trachytes and trachybasalt; volcanic rocks contain potassium feldspar and plagioclase. The volcanic rocks have been subdivided into a lower tholeiitic subunit and an upper more trachytic unit; there are also compositional differences between various parts of the seamount. Some of the volcanic rocks take the form of breccia, lava, tuffs and tuffites. The limestone takes the form of siltstone, sandstone, gravelstone and coquina. In drill cores of the summit region the limestone reaches a thickness of and the mud of ; the mud formed in lagoonal settings. Terrigenous rocks have also been encountered within the limestones. Guyots such as Ita Mai Tai often accumulate ferromanganese crusts. These are generated by the oxidative precipitation of manganese salts which also include iron and absorb trace elements such as cobalt, copper, molybdenum, nickel, platinum, rare earth elements and zinc from the water through as-yet unknown processes. In the case of Ita Mai Tai these crusts have been found all over the seamount and sometimes reach thicknesses of over , with geochemical differences between the various sectors of the seamount. These ferromanganese crusts have aroused scientific interest in the seamount. Some evidence of hydrothermal alteration has been found in the form of barite deposits within the ferromanganese crusts.  Geologic history  Ita Mai Tai erupted first during the Albian and Aptian periods. Another episode of volcanic activity may constitute late stage volcanism; it might be represented by Campanian volcaniclastic rocks, an Eocene dome and Pliocene cones on Gelendzhik seamount. such late volcanism has been observed in other neighbouring seamounts as well. An uplift episode took place during the Cretaceous. Radiometric dating has yielded ages of about 118-120 million years ago. At least during the Paleocene, Ita Mai Tai emerged above sea level. From the Aptian to the Miocene, carbonates were deposited on the seamount and reached an eventual thickness of about . Additionally, the seamount has subsided by about , albeit with time periods where this subsidence was interrupted by the growth of coral reefs. Most of the subsidence occurred during the Oligocene when sedimentation rates were depressed, but the carbonate platform drowned no later than the Eocene, with oolithes forming underwater. During three different episodes in the Aptian-Turonian, Santonian-Maastrichtian and Paleocene-Eocene, oolithic limestones were deposited on Ita Mai Tai, presumably by reefs and living organisms in shallow water. Lifeforms that inhabited the seamount included algae, belemnites, bivalves, bryozoans, corals, decapods, echinoderms, foraminifera, gastropods, ostracods, pogonophora, rudists and sea urchins; their fossils have been recovered in the limestone from Ita Mai Tai and the rudists are the most commonly encountered reef builders on this seamount. The oolith-containing limestone was formed by a coral reef. The reef was affected by wave activity and there were lagoonal environments as well. Bioherms developed on the Gelendzhik seamount as well, where cephalopods including belemnites have been found. During the Eocene to Quaternary, foraminiferal ooze accumulated on the guyot at a rate of but with occasional erosional periods which show up as hiatuses in the sedimentary record, the ooze also contains fish teeth and radiolarian fossils. This sediment layer is unusually thick by the standard of other Pacific Ocean seamounts, its thickness reaching -. Presently, scleractinian corals without zooxanthelles form \\"meadows\\" and \\"patches\\" on the surface of Ita Mai Tai. The deep sea sponge Spongicoloides weijiaensis was discovered near Ita Mai Tai and named after an alternative name of the seamount.

History  While the exact dates of the establishment of the village are unknown, it is estimated that the village was founded in the 1800s after Chaudhri Ghasiram Singh, ‚Äúthe chief landholder in the district [of Muzaffarnagar]\\", established a fort here. Chaudhri Ghasiram Singh belonged to one of the most prominent families in Western Uttar Pradesh ‚Äî the Maulaheri Jats (Panwar gotra). It is said that the fort was built for better administration of the area, as during the monsoon it was difficult for people on horses and elephants to cross the Kaali river that flowed between present day Ghasipura and Chaudhri Ghasiram Singh's primary residence, Maulaheri Palace. The original fort, which largely remains dilapidated, featured one gateway, five havelis and four watchtowers (burj) built according to Indian architecture.

Completed in 1936, the ship was assigned to the Baltic Fleet and played a minor role in the Winter War against Finland in 1939‚Äì1940. After the start of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Leningrad covered minelaying operations, laid mines herself, and provided naval gunfire support to Soviet units. She escorted ships during the evacuation of Tallinn, Estonia, in August and then bombarded German troops during the Siege of Leningrad. The ship was assigned to evacuate Soviet troops from their enclave in Hanko, Finland, in November, but was badly damaged by mines en route and forced to return to Leningrad for repairs. After they were completed, Leningrad resumed shelling German positions and continued to do so until the Leningrad‚ÄìNovgorod Offensive drove them away from the city in January 1944. After the war, the ship was modernized in 1951‚Äì1954. She became a target ship in 1958 and was renamed TsL-75. The ship was transferred to the Northern Fleet the following year and was disarmed in 1960. She was converted into an accommodation ship that year and was renamed PKZ-16. The hulk was reconverted into a target ship, SM-5, in 1962. The following year the ship was used to test anti-ship missiles and sank afterwards. Design and description Impressed by the French large destroyer (contre-torpilleur) designs such as the of the early 1930s, the Soviets designed their own version. The Leningrads had an overall length of and were long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of , and a draft of at deep load. Built in two batches, the first batch (Project 1) displaced at standard load and at deep load. Their crew numbered 250 officers and sailors in peacetime and 311 in wartime.Breyer, pp. 218, 220 The ships had three geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller, designed to produce using steam from three three-drum boilersBudzbon, p. 329 which was intended to give them a maximum speed of . The Leningrads carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at .Breyer, p. 220 As built, the Leningrad-class ships mounted five B-13 guns in two pairs of superfiring single mounts fore and aft of the superstructure and another mount between the bridge and the forward funnel. The guns were protected by gun shields. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by a pair of 34-K AA guns in single mounts on the aft superstructure and a pair of 21-K AA guns mounted on either side of the bridge as well as four DK machine guns. They carried eight torpedo tubes in two rotating quadruple mounts; each tube was provided with a reload. The ships could also carry a maximum of either 68 or 115 mines and 52 depth charges. They were fitted with a set of Arktur hydrophones for anti- submarine detection. =Modifications= In 1943, Leningrad exchanged her two 21-K mounts for four 70-K AA guns, a twin-gun mount for the 34-K known as the 81-K and two twin-gun mounts for ex-German 37 mm SK C/30 AA guns, although these latter guns were later replaced by a pair of 70-K guns.Hill, p. 26 She received a British Type 128 asdic systemBreyer, p. 217 and was fitted with a Type 291 early-warning radar and an American SF-1 radar. After the war, all of the 76- and 37-millimeter guns were replaced by a dozen water-cooled V-11M versions of the 70-K gun in twin mounts. During the 1950s, the radars were replaced by Top Bow, EWS Top, Plum Jar and Ball End radars and the pole foremast was replaced by a tripod mast to support them. Construction and career Leningrad, named after the capital of the former Russian Empire under its new Soviet name, was laid down on 5 November 1932 at Shipyard No. 190 (Zhdanov) in Leningrad as yard number 450Rohwer & Monakov, p. 232 and launched on 17 November 1933. Commissioned on 5 December 1936, she was assigned to the Red Banner Baltic Fleet.Breyer, p. 216 After the Winter War began on 30 November, Leningrad and her sister ship bombarded Finnish coastal defense positions on Saarenp√§√§ Island, part of the Beryozovye Islands, on 10 December and again on 30 December‚Äì3 January 1940.Rohwer, pp. 11‚Äì12 During these missions she was badly damaged by ice and was under repair until 31 May 1941.Hill, p. 27 The beginning of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June found Leningrad in Tallinn, Estonia, as part of the 4th Destroyer Division and she was ordered to cover minelaying operations at the entrance to the Gulf of Finland between Hanko and Osmussaar on 23‚Äì27 June. On 3 July she helped to lay minefield covering the approached to Tallinn. The ship bombarded German positions around Tallinn on 23‚Äì27 August, firing 227 shells from her main guns. The Soviets began evacuating the port on the night of 27/28 August with Leningrad providing covering fire until the early morning. After Minsk was badly damaged by a mine on the 28th, Rear Admiral Y. A. Panteleyev transferred his flag to Leningrad the following day. On 30 August, Leningrad was assigned to provide gunfire support to Soviet troops in the Kronstadt/Oranienbaum area from the Leningrad Sea Canal together with the heavy cruisers and Petropavlovsk and the destroyers , , , and . On 1 and 3 September, Leningrad helped to lay minefields covering the approaches to Kronstadt and Leningrad.Platonov, p. 130; Rohwer, pp. 81‚Äì82, 94‚Äì95, 97 The ship moved to the Leningrad Sea Canal on 17 September to bombard German troops and then steamed to the Leningrad Trade Port. On 22 September, she was slightly damaged by shell splinters and moved to Kanonersky Island. Leningrad was struck by one shell and near-missed by another on 12 October. They damaged fuel and fresh- water tanks and started a small fire by igniting the propellant for a 130 mm round. The ship was repaired at Shipyard No. 196 (Sudomekh).Platonov, p. 130 On 9 November she departed Kronstadt for Hanko as part of the third convoy to evacuate Soviet troops together with the destroyer Stoyky and the minelayer . Bad weather forced them to seek shelter behind Gogland Island on the morning of 11 November, although they were able to resume movement that evening. Later that evening Leningrads paravanes detonated one mine at a distance of , but the ship was not damaged. Early in the morning of 12 November, another mine detonated in her paravanes, but only at a distance of . The explosion disabled both turbines and flooded many of her fuel tanks. The ship was able to get underway again, but was forced to return to Kronstadt, escorted by two minesweepers and the transport . She was repaired in Leningrad where she resumed providing gunfire support; the ship fired a total of 1,081 rounds from her 130 mm guns during 1941.Platonov, pp. 130‚Äì131; Rohwer, p. 114 On 14 May 1942, near misses by artillery shells wounded four crewmen, disabled a searchlight and damaged a torpedo tube.

She was refitted and modernized between 19 December 1951 and 25 November 1954. After brief service, the destroyer was withdrawn from combat duty and reclassified as the target ship TsL-75 on 18 April 1958. She was assigned to the Northern Fleet on 13 October 1959. The former Leningrad was disarmed on 15 September 1960 and converted into a floating barracks, PKZ-16, then target ship SM-5 on 10 August 1962. She was used to test the new P-35 anti-ship cruise missiles of the guided missile cruiser in May 1963 while anchored in the Kandalaksha Gulf, and was hit by two missiles, but remained afloat with a slight list. After an unsuccessful attempt to tow her back to Severodinsk, she sank in shallow water east of the island of Sennaya Luda in the Solovetsky Islands.Kachur, pp. 131‚Äì132 References  Bibliography    Further reading Leningrad-class destroyer leaders Ships built in the Soviet Union 1933 ships World War II destroyers of the Soviet Union ","title":"Soviet destroyer Leningrad"},{"id":"58499883","text":"thumb Farid Gayibov (born April 24, 1979) is the President of European Gymnastics.

He committed murders to obtain the weapons of the victims.  Life before the murders  Gerashchenko served in the special unit of the Marine Corps, and was given the military specialty of \\"diver scout\\". After demobilization, Gerashchenko got a job as a firefighter, and by 2006 was an assistant to the chief of the 16th fire station. Gerashchenko did not drink alcohol, coffee or tea, did not smoke, eat meat or use a mobile phone, but did do sports, read classical literature and teach foreign languages. By his own admission, he dreamed of permanently settling in Spain.  Murders  The first murder committed was on July 13, 1998, when Gerashchenko killed a conscripted soldier guarding the \\"Ural\\" plant. He shot him with a small rifle, hitting him in the head. Gerashchenko stole an AK-47 with a spare magazine. Soon afterwards Gerashchenko made an attempt to attack the Interdistrict Department of private security at the Office of Internal Affairs of Solikamsk. But he was found in time hiding in some bushes, where he was ambushed. However, he managed to flee, and fell off the radar for two years.

As it later turned out, Gerashchenko made an attempt to break into the store in order to entice the police, but could not steal a weapon, as he was overwhelmed during the shootout, and had to surrender.  Arrest, trial and sentence  The trails left behind were purely coincidental. A fire once broke out in Solikamsk, and after it was extinguished, an AK-47 and pieces of a fireman's belt were discovered. On the site of the last murder, Gerashchenko had lost a LED light. The seller in a Salikamsk store, in which such lights were sold, said that they had been supplied by his acting fireman, who, in turn, claimed that he received them from Gerashchenko. Gerashchenko, sensing the increased interest of law enforcement agencies, decided to flee abroad. He wrote a report on his dismissal from the service, but failed to deceive the militiamen, and was detained on the outskirts of Solikamsk. During the search, false documents, money, weapons, and maps of European countries were found in Gerashchenko's possession. He acted calmly, immediately agreeing to cooperate with the investigation. Gerashchenko revealed all the weapons caches and confessed to committing seven murders in eight years. He explained his motives saying \\"I was not going to sell weapons, I had no personal advantage\\"...\\"Honest Detective\\" from 08.02.2009 (RTR, Russia) Relatives and colleagues of Gerashchenko were very surprised that he was the \\"Solikamsk Shooter\\".

Completed in 1939, the ship was assigned to the Baltic Fleet and played a minor role in the Winter War against Finland in 1939‚Äì1940. After the start of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Minsk covered minelaying operations and provided naval gunfire support to Soviet units. She escorted ships during the Soviet evacuation of Tallinn, Estonia, in late August. The ship was sunk by German dive bombers on 23 September, although her wreck was salvaged in 1942 and repaired. Minsk was recommissioned in 1943 but the repairs were not completed until the following year. The ship was reclassified as a training ship in 1951, then became a target ship in 1958 and was sunk that year. Design and description Impressed by the French large destroyer () designs such as the of the early 1930s, the Soviets designed their own version. The Leningrad class had an overall length of and were long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of , and a draft of at deep load.

The guns were protected by gun shields. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by a pair of 34-K AA guns in single mounts on the aft superstructure and a pair of 21-K AA guns mounted on either side of the bridge as well as six DShK machine guns. They carried eight torpedo tubes in two rotating quadruple mounts; each tube was provided with a reload. The ships could also carry a maximum of either 68 or 115 mines and 52 depth charges. They were fitted with a set of Arktur hydrophones for anti- submarine work. =Modifications= During the war, Minsk exchanged her two 21-K mounts for six 70-K AA guns.Hill, p. 26 She received a British Type 128 ASDIC systemBreyer, p. 217 and was fitted with a Type 291 early-warning radar. After the war, all of the 76- and 37-millimeter guns were replaced by a dozen water-cooled V-11M versions of the 70-K gun in twin mounts. During the 1950s, the radars were replaced by Top Bow, EWS Top, Plum Jar and Ball End radars and the pole foremast was replaced by a tripod mast to support them.

On 3 July she helped to lay minefield covering the approached to Tallinn. The ship bombarded German positions around Tallinn on 23‚Äì27 August, firing 563 shells from her main guns. One of those guns was struck by a German shell on 27 August. That night, the Soviets began evacuating the port, covered by Minsk, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Y. A. Panteleyev, the fleet chief of staff. The ship continued to provide gunfire support until all of the evacuees were loaded by the morning of 28 August. Later that night, a mine detonated in one of her paravanes, damaging the ship's hull. The explosion flooded three compartments with of water and Captain 2nd rank Peter Petunin ordered her to be anchored for the night lest she strike anymore mines; the ship reached Kronstadt the following day.Platonov, pp. 135‚Äì136; Rohwer, pp. 81‚Äì82, 94‚Äì95 On 30 August, Minsk was assigned to provide gunfire support to Soviet troops in the Kronstadt/Oranienbaum area together with the battleships Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya and Marat, the heavy cruiser and the destroyers , , , and and the gunboat Volga. Junkers Ju 87 dive-bombers of StG 2 attacked the ships in Kronstadt harbor on 23 September. Minsk was initially hit with three bombs that knocked out all her power, set her on fire and flooded part of the ship. She drifted until her stern grounded near the Leningrad lighthouse, although she was pulled off by tugboats and towed to the harbor. Later in the day, a large bomb exploded away and further damaged the hull. Minsk sank in shallow water later that night. She was refloated in August 1942 and received temporary repairs at the Kronstadt Marine Plant. The ship steamed under her own power to Shipyard No. 190 on 9 November for permanent repairs.

History Christianity was first brought to modern- day Switzerland's Z√ºrcher Oberland by the Roman Empire, who built the region's first Christian church at Irgenhausen Castrum on the Pf√§ffikersee. After the collapse of the Roman Empire, Christianity returned to eastern Switzerland because of the work of the monks Gallus and Columbanus. The first church in Wetzikon, perhaps mentioned in a document from 857, was destroyed by fire in 1320. The township replaced it a decade later, but it was under the control of the Abbey of Saint Gall. Worship in the Catholic rite was forbidden in 1524 in the wake of the Swiss Reformation and it henceforth became Protestant, and then Wetzikon fell under the control of Zurich in 1563. From 1711 to 1713, the construction of the town's present Reformed church took place. Construction and use Beginning in 1923 and lasting into 1924, the current church building was constructed by Josef Steiner, who designed Saint Francis's after earlier Romanesque churches. A smallscale renovation took place in 1966, and in 1975 a pipe organ was added. In 2013‚Äì14, Saint Francis's underwent a total remodeling carried out by Frank Roskothen, Pius Bieri, and Barbara Ziegenfuss.

In event of a Romanian attack on the Soviet Union, Moskva, as part of the Black Sea Fleet squadron, was to destroy or capture the Romanian fleet and cut communications, blockade the Romanian coast, support a potential amphibious landing and Soviet troops advancing along the Black Sea coast. To practice this plan, she participated in exercises with the Red Army's 9th Special Rifle Corps between 4 and 19 June, supporting a mock amphibious landing on the west coast of Crimea, near Tendra. =Raid on Constan»õa= Following the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the squadron of the Black Sea Fleet was tasked with disrupting Axis supply lines by bombarding the Romanian port of Constan»õa and its oil tanks. The time of the bombardment was set for 05:00 on 26 June, to be preceded by a 30-minute airstrike by aircraft of the fleet beginning an hour earlier. For the raid, the heavy cruiser and Moskva were to cover the bombardment of the port by the latter's sister ship and the destroyers and . To prevent Axis air attack, the ships began to depart Sevastopol at night, at 18:00 on 25 June. However, before exiting the bay, the ships were ordered back to port because the plan was changed by the People's Commissar for the Navy, Vitse-admiral (Vice Admiral) Nikolay Kuznetsov, who ordered that the two destroyer leaders conduct the bombardment, with the other ships in support. Moskva and Kharkov departed Sevastopol Bay at 20:10, initially heading towards Odessa as a deception measure and then turning towards their destination slightly more than an hour later, followed by the support group.Kachur, p. 75 On the morning of 26 June, Moskva and Kharkov bombarded the port as scheduled, although the airstrike was not carried out. The former contributed 196 out of the 350 rounds fired between them at oil tanks and railway stations from a range of about , blowing up an ammunition train and inflicting considerable damage. As they were preparing to depart after having fired for 10 minutes, they were engaged by German coastal artillery and the Romanian destroyers and at ranges between . Silhouetted against the dawn, the Axis fire soon bracketed Moskva and hit her mainmast. Shortly afterwards, she struck a mine, probably laid by the Romanians on 16‚Äì19 June, which broke the ship in half; prior to the raid, the ships conducting it were not given precise charts of minefield locations. Moskva sank quickly, but German Heinkel He 50 floatplanes and Romanian motor torpedo boats were able to rescue 69 survivors, including seven officers.Hervieux, pp. 70‚Äì71 Among those captured was Tukhov, who was reported by Soviet accounts to have later escaped and been killed while fighting as a partisan.Kachur, pp. 76‚Äì78 In 2011, the wreck of Moskva was discovered by Romanian divers at a depth of from Constan»õa.

Completed in 1938, she was slightly damaged during the Raid on Constan»õa a few days after the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June and covered the evacuation of the Danube Flotilla to Odessa the following month. During the Siege of Odessa and the Siege of Sevastopol in 1941‚Äì1942, the ship ferried reinforcements and supplies into those cities, evacuated wounded and refugees and bombarded Axis troop positions. Damaged by German aircraft a few weeks before the surrender of Sevastopol on 4 July, Kharkov was under repair until the beginning of August. During the Battle of the Caucasus, the ship performed the same missions as she did earlier, bombarding Axis positions and ferrying troops into and wounded men out of ports threatened by the German advance along the Black Sea coast. In February 1943, she supported Soviet forces as they made an amphibious landing behind German lines and then provided naval gunfire support later in the month. Over the next several months Kharkov bombarded German-held ports in the Caucasus and Crimea. While returning from one such mission in October, the ship was damaged by German dive bombers and was sunk while under tow later in the day, together with two other destroyers. Design and description Impressed by the French large destroyer (contre-torpilleur) designs such as the of the early 1930s, the Soviets designed their own version.

The guns were protected by gun shields. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by a pair of 34-K AA guns in single mounts on the aft superstructure and a pair of 21-K AA guns mounted on either side of the bridge as well as a dozen M2 Browning machine guns in six twin-gun mounts. They carried eight torpedo tubes in two rotating quadruple mounts; each tube was provided with a reload. The ships could also carry a maximum of either 68 or 115 mines and 52 depth charges. They were fitted with a set of Arktur hydrophones for anti-submarine detection. =Modifications= Before her loss in 1943, Kharkov exchanged her two 21-K mounts for six 70-K AA guns.

Kharkov bombarded Axis positions multiple times during the Siege of Odessa and helped to escort the evacuation convoys from Odessa to Sevastopol in October.Rohwer, pp. 94, 98 During the Siege of Sevastopol she provided gunfire support and evacuated cut-off troops from elsewhere in the Crimea into Sevastopol and brought in reinforcements from Caucasian ports. The ship helped to transport the 388th Rifle Division from Novorossisk and Tuapse to Sevastopol between 7‚Äì13 December, the 79th Naval Rifle Brigade on 19‚Äì20 December and the 354th Rifle Division between 21‚Äì22 December, bombarding German positions in the interim.Rohwer, pp. 112, 122, 140‚Äì141 Between February and July 1942, Kharkov bombarded German troops many times and brought in reinforcements and supplies for Sevastopol, evacuating wounded and refugees as she returned to port. On 18 June, the ship's steering was knocked out by near misses by German bombers and she had to be towed by the flotilla leader .Rohwer, pp. 154, 156, 161, 164, 166, 169‚Äì170, 172 After repairs Kharkov bombarded Axis positions near Feodosiya on 2‚Äì3 August and provided fire support for the defenders of Novorossiysk on 1‚Äì4 September. Between 8‚Äì11 September she ferried the 137th and 145th Rifle Regiments along with the 3rd Naval Rifle Brigade from Poti to Tuapse and Gelendzhik and a month later she transported 12,600 men of the 8th, 9th and 10th Guards Rifle Brigades from Poti to Tuapse to reinforce the defenses there between 20 and 23 October.Rohwer, pp. 184, 193‚Äì194, 204 On 29 November 1942 she escorted Voroshilov on a mission to bombard Axis positions on Feodonisi and bombarded Yalta during the night of 19/20 December. On the night of 4 February 1943, the Soviets made a series of amphibious landings to the west of Novorossiysk, behind German lines. Kharkov, the light cruisers and , and Besposhchadny and Soobrazitelny provided fire support for the main landing, but the Soviet troops there were wiped out by 6 February, although one secondary landing was successful. Kharkov bombarded German positions near Novorossiysk again on the night of 21‚Äì22 February. Anapa was bombarded on the night of 13/14 May and Feodosiya on 22/23 May.Rohwer, pp. 215, 219, 229, 231, 251 During the night of 5/6 October 1943 Kharkov and the destroyers Besposhchadny and bombarded Yalta, Alushta and Feodosia and were attacked by Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers of III./StG 3 on their return voyage. Kharkov was damaged by their first attack and had to be towed by Sposobny. The second attack damaged all three ships and Sposobny took Besposhchadny under tow as well. The next attack sank both Kharkov and Besposhchadny. Sposobny was sunk by the fourth wave while trying to rescue survivors.

It is also known as Cranbrook Stables; (adjacent to site of Newmarket House; The Sale Ring; Training Stables/old Tramway & Omnibus Co. Stables). The property is owned by William Inglis & Son Pty Ltd. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Indigenous history= Pre-1780s the local Aboriginal people in the area used the site for fishing and cultural activities; rock engravings, grinding grooves and middens remain in evidence. In 1789 Governor Arthur Phillip referred to \\"a long bay\\", which became known as Long Bay. Aboriginal people are believed to have inhabited the Sydney region for at least 20,000 years.Turbet, 2001. The population of Aboriginal people between Palm Beach and Botany Bay in 1788 has been estimated to have been 1500. Those living south of Port Jackson to Botany Bay were the Cadigal people who spoke Dharug,Randwick Library webpage, 2003. while the local clan name of Maroubra people was \\"Muru-ora-dial\\".City of Sydney webpage, 2003 By the mid nineteenth century the traditional owners of this land had typically either moved inland in search of food and shelter, or had died as the result of European disease or confrontation with British colonisers. =Colonial history= One of the earliest land grants in this area was made in 1824 to Captain Francis Marsh, who received bounded by the present Botany and High Streets, Alison and Belmore Roads. In 1839 William Newcombe acquired the land north-west of the present town hall in Avoca Street. Randwick takes its name from the town of Randwick, Gloucestershire, England. The name was suggested by Simeon Pearce (1821‚Äì86) and his brother James. Simeon was born in the English Randwick and the brothers were responsible for the early development of both Randwick and its neighbour, Coogee. Simeon had come to the colony in 1841as a 21 year old surveyor. He built his Blenheim House on the 4 acres he bought from Marsh, and called his property \\"Randwick\\". The brothers bought and sold land profitably in the area and elsewhere. Simeon campaigned for construction of a road from the city to Coogee (achieved in 1853) and promoted the incorporation of the suburb. Pearce sought construction of a church modelled on the church of St. John in his birthplace. In 1857 the first St Jude's stood on the site of the present post office, at the corner of the present Alison Road and Avoca Street.Pollen & Healy, 1988. p. 217-8. Randwick was slow to progress. The village was isolated from Sydney by swamps and sandhills, and although a horse-bus was operated by a man named Grice from the late 1850s, the journey was more a test of nerves than a pleasure jaunt. Wind blew sand over the track, and the bus sometimes became bogged, so that passengers had to get out and push it free. From its early days Randwick had a divided society. The wealthy lived elegantly in large houses built when Pearce promoted Randwick and Coogee as a fashionable area. But the market gardens, orchards and piggeries that continued alongside the large estates were the lot of the working class. Even on the later estates that became racing empires, many jockeys and stablehands lived in huts or even under canvas. An even poorer group were the immigrants who existed on the periphery of Randwick in a place called Irishtown, in the area now known as The Spot, around the junction of St.Paul's Street and Perouse Road. Here families lived in makeshift houses, taking on the most menial tasks in their struggle to survive. In 1858 when the NSW Government passed the Municipalities Act, enabling formation of municipal districts empowered to collect rates and borrow money to improve their suburb, Randwick was the first suburb to apply for the status of a municipality. It was approved in February 1859, and its first Council was elected in March 1859. =Racing in Randwick= The presence of Randwick racecourse, where racing was first held in 1833, brought to the suburb trainers, jockeys and stablehands, and from them developed a local racing industry which continues to this day. In 1833 horse racing moved from Hyde Park in the city to a Randwick track known as Sandy Course, because of its sandy soil.Murray, 2017, 7 Randwick had been the venue for sporting events, as well as duels and illegal sports, from the early days in the colony's history. Its first racecourse, the Sandy Racecourse or Old Sand Track, had been a hazardous track over hills and gullies since 1860. When a move was made in 1863 by John Tait, to establish the Randwick Racecourse, Simeon Pearce was furious, especially when he heard that Tait also intended to move into Byron Lodge. Tait's venture prospered, however and he became the first person in Australia to organise racing as a commercial sport. The racecourse made a big difference to the progress of Randwick. The horse-bus gave way to trams that linked the suburb to Sydney and civilisation. Randwick soon became a prosperous and lively place, and it still retains a busy residential, professional and commercial life. Today, some of the houses have been replaced by home units. Many European migrants have made their homes in the area, along with students and workers at the nearby University of NSW and the Prince of Wales Hospital. =Newmarket House, the Big Stables & Show Ring= Newmarket House was built on the site of the 1861 Newmarket Hotel. It is expected that the house's eastern section incorporates the remains of the original 1861 hotel structure. To this section it is believed that the southern, single storey wing was added in 1880-83 when the Fennelly /James White interests began in earnest the training of thoroughbred horses for racing. The house forms a precinct bounded by Barker and Young Streets and the adjoining sites of Randwick High School and Randwick Primary Schools. Newmarket House, along with the \\"Big Stables\\", Sale Ring, Training Stables on the site of the old Tramway and Omnibus Company Stables (on Barker Street) demonstrates the evolving importance of this precinct from the \\"Struggle Town\\" origins of the 1850s.National Trust (NSW), 1976. Newmarket House has remained a residence and managerial centre since that time. In 1976 it provided the host headquarters for at least four major selling events of Australian blood horse stock each year. Horses offered for sale in January 1976 consisted of 500 yearlings and 800 other types, for April 1976 offers were 800 yearlings, 400 brood mares and 200 other mixed types. The Big Stable was built on land at the rear of the original 1861 Newmarket Hotel. The design of the Stables has been attributed by the official history of Randwick's first 50 years (1859-1909) to \\"an artist named Fowler\\" (possibly Fowles) and the actual date of construction is not known precisely, . The stables is the most important building in a precinct with four important buildings: Newmarket House, The Big Stables, The Sale Ring and the Training Stables, on the site of the Old Tramway and Omnibus Company Stables (facing Barker Street). Stabling at the Barker Street (eastern) end of the site has included areas established for the accommodation of Randwick - Sydney coaching horses in 1877-8. This Training Stables is on the site of the Old Tramway and Omnibus Company Stables. The introduction of racehorse training began in 1878 when the noted trainer Michael Fennelly and his patron owner the Hon. James White MLC acquired interests at the site, then named \\"Cranbrook Stables\\". Construction of the \\"Big Stable\\" appears to have commenced shortly after this date. William Inglis & Son started selling livestock in 1906 out of rented premises in Randwick. When Arthur Inglis was a boy, trainers would exercise their horses by walking them around the streets near his family's thoroughbred sales complex in Randwick every afternoon. \\"There were trainers who had stables in the streets between here and Randwick Racecourse\\", Inglis said. After buying the site in 1917 for ¬£50,000, William Inglis & Son developed the property to include a sales arena and four stables accommodating up to 620 horses. Arthur Inglis is now deputy chairman of the company.Murray, 2017, 6 The Sale Ring enclosure is the hub of historic racehorse sales which have been continued without interruption of their direction by the family firm of Inglis & Sons since 1906.Aubusson, Laura. Wentworth Courier, 15 April 2015. The racehorse \\"Phar Lap\\" won the AJC Derby at Randwick in 1929. This champion racehorse won 37 of 51 races he ran. A number of prominent racing men including Thomas Payten, Jim Pike, William Inglis and Son and W.J. Smith owned and leased The Stable. During World War II it was used as a Detention Barracks and after the war as a laminex factory. In 1954 Queen Elizabeth attended the races at Randwick, returning in 1992, when she put the \\"Royal\\" into the racecourse's name. The \\"Big Stable\\" was used as a set in some scenes in the box office hit-film, Phar Lap. The Stables were restored in the mid 1980s and received a Royal Australian Institute of Architecture Award, the Greenway Award, for conservation. They have been returned to their original use. Some of Australia's top race horses were trained from this stable. A plaque has been erected on the site by the Randwick City Council, detailing the history of the site, the horses and trainers. Racing royalty and quality thoroughbred horses have walked through Inglis Stables for over 100 years but it has also been the venue for fashion, celebrities and red-carpet events. The Newmarket site is home to internationally-renowned horse sales attended by leading traniners around the world. With The Championships carnival to continue this Saturday and the Schweppes Stakes, the venue's role continues (sic). The heritage-listed buildings on the 11ha site have been the backdrop for photo shoots, fashion shows, charity dinners and TV show launches. Over the years, guests to the complex have included Gracie Otto, TV chippie Scott Cam, models Rachael Finch and Megan Gale and carcing ambassador Emma Freedman, daughter of five-time Melbourne Cup winning trainer Lee Freedman. Now the renowned auction centre and function venue will be turned into a residential and commercial development with up to 700 dwellings, and buildings up to 25m high. In 2011 William Inglis and Sons announced it would move its operation to Warwick Farm and sought to rezone the land to develop. The rezoning went through Randwick Council on 4 April 2015 with maximum heights down from and dwellings reduced from 900 to 700. The Big Stable was recently restored and returned to its original use by its present owners William Inglis and Son. In April 2017 the final sale was held at the Newmarket complex. The Inglis empire is about to shift to new headquarters near Warwick Farm Racecourse in south-west Sydney, where there will be plenty of space, easy access for out-of-towners, a new auditorium and luxury hotel. 'In simple terms, we've grown out of context with our surroundings', says Arthur Inglis. 'In the early days, Randwick was quite a long way from the city centre, but it was a horse centre. The University of New South Wales site used to be a racecourse. Now there isn't a horse between us and Randwick Racecourse'. Developer Cbus property bought the 5 hectare site in 2015 for a reported $250 million. Next month, the first homes at Newmarket Randwick will hit the market. By the time it's finished, the medium density development will include about 650 residences, more than of retail or commercial space and of public open space. Bates Smart, Neeson Murcutt Architects, Smart Design Studio and SJB architects will be responsible for different stages of the development. Grand old fig trees will be retained. The Inglis family has donated items from its thoroughbred business to be incorporated into the public space. Big Stable will be given to Randwick Council, though its future has yet to be confirmed. The auction ring will become a recreation space.Murray, 2017, 6-7  Description  'The Big Stable' was built behind the Newmarket Hotel. Measuring approximately on plan, it is of timber frame construction with external walls of painted weatherboard and a roof of painted corrugated iron. The core of the design is a large central space roofed at a high level with clerestory glazed sashes on both sides, for the full length of the building. Stabling boxes open from each side of this space. Above each row of stabling extends a wide gallery space with open balustrading between the posts of the main structure. Galleries give access to service compartments for feed, harness and grooms' accommodation. The atmosphere on entering this building, with its only external light from the glazing between above floor level, with free standing timber posts, is very impressive. An American influence in the design has been suggested and could derive from familiarity with buildings of similar function in the blood stock states of the Southern Mississippi. = Modifications and dates = *1939-45: World War II it was used as a detention barracks *After the war as a laminex factory *Mid 1980s: The Stables were restored and returned to their original use.  Heritage listing  The \\"Big Stable' is significant on the grounds of architectural quality, unusual function and building type of historic importance. The Newmarket Precinct (Big Stable, Newmarket House, Sale Ring and Training Stables) will assist in the preservation of an historic asset of unusual value to the national heritage and to the municipality of Randwick. The graceful, homely and unpretentious structure of this site survive almost intact from the 19th century amid well kept trees, lawns and pavements. The occupants of the site continue today the horse breeding and training activities traditionally associated with Randwick and give support to complementary activities in the neighbourhood, in complete harmony with the residential character of the area once known as \\"Struggle Town\\". Respect for Newmarket's prestige in its associations with Australia's thoroughbred horse breeding industry also extends beyond national borders. Big Stable Newmarket was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

They carried eight torpedo tubes in two rotating quadruple mounts; each tube was provided with a reload. The ships could also carry a maximum of either 68 or 115 mines and 52 depth charges. They were fitted with a set of Arktur hydrophones for anti-submarine detection. =Modifications= During the war, Tbilisi exchanged her two 21-K mounts for eight 70-K AA guns.Hill, p. 26 She received a British Type 128 asdic systemBreyer, p. 217 and was fitted with a Type 291 early-warning radar, a Type 284 gunnery radar and an American SF-1 radar. After the war, all of the 76- and 37-millimeter guns were replaced by a dozen water-cooled V-11M versions of the 70-K gun in twin mounts. During the 1950s, the radars were replaced by Top Bow, EWS Top, Plum Jar and Ball End radars and the pole foremast was replaced by a tripod mast to support them. Construction and career Named after the capital of Georgia, major components for the ship that became Tbilisi were laid down at Shipyard No. 198 (Marti South) in Nikolayev on 15 January 1935 as yard number 268Rohwer & Monakov, p. 232 and were then railed to Shipyard No. 199 in Komsomolsk-on-Amur where the ship was laid down again on 10 August 1936. Originally named Tiflis, she was renamed Tbilisi on the day of her launching, 24 July 1939. To free up space for new construction, the destroyer leader was moved to Lake Silinskoye near the plant for completion. Tbilisi was commissioned on 11 December 1940 as part of the Pacific FleetBreyer, p. 216 after a series of tests; she had cost 41.2 million rubles due to her lengthy construction.Kachur, pp. 26, 30 Due to the numerical inferiority of the Pacific Fleet to the Imperial Japanese Navy, the Soviet ships were tasked with coast defense. Used as a testbed for new technologies from the beginning of the war, she laid the first mines in Peter the Great Gulf off Vladivostok on 12 July and then began laying mines off other naval bases in the Far East. By late 1941, Tbilisi was equipped with a degaussing system, and was used to train officers in ship handling due to the peaceful conditions in the Far East. When the Light Forces Detachment of the Pacific Fleet was formed in November 1942, she became the leader of the 2nd Destroyer Division. In July and August 1943, she had degaussing coils placed on the upper deck to examine the effect of the steel hull on the coils; these studies helped to develop methods for the optimal placement of coils on ships.Kachur, pp. 128‚Äì129 A day before the Soviet Union declared war on Japan on 9 August 1945, the flotilla leader, transferred to the 1st Destroyer Division of the Light Forces Detachment, entered the active fleet. On 9 August, she was located in the Ulysses (Uliss) Bay off Vladivostok, and was ordered to move to the northerly anchorage of Zolotoy Rog off the same port. Under the flag of fleet commander Admiral Ivan Yumashev, she transported a hundred-man company of naval infantry from the 354th Naval Rifle Battalion to Vityaz Cove in Posyet Bay on 12 August. From there, the company was loaded onto torpedo boats for an amphibious landing at the Korean port of Rason.Rohwer, p. 427 This was her only major operation during the war, but did not involve contact with the Japanese. Yumashev slated Tbilisi to serve as flagship for a projected invasion of Hokkaido in an order of 19 August, but the operation was cancelled.Glantz, p. 406Tbilisi while converted into a target ship, photographed in the Pacific in 1958 She continued to serve with the Pacific Fleet postwar and on 12 January 1949 was reclassified as a destroyer like her surviving sister ships. Between 1951 and 24 January 1955 she underwent a major refit and modernization at Dalzavod. Tbilisi was withdrawn from active service on 18 April 1958, disarmed, and converted into the target ship TsL-50. A year later, the ship was renamed TSP-50, before being struck on 31 January 1964 and scrapped at Vladivostok by the Main Directorate for the Procurement, Processing and Sale of Secondary Ferrous Metals.Kachur, p. 137 References  Bibliography    Further reading Leningrad-class destroyer leaders Ships built in the Soviet Union 1939 ships World War II destroyers of the Soviet Union ","title":"Soviet destroyer Tbilisi"},{"id":"58500187","text":"NRP Bartolomeu Dias has been the name of more than one Portuguese Navy ship, and may refer to: * , an launched in 1934 and hulked in 1965 * , formerly the HNLMS Van Nes acquired in 2009 Portuguese Navy ship names ","title":"NRP Bartolomeu Dias"},{"id":"58500199","text":"April Kihlstrom is an American genre novelist specializing in regency romance novels.

She published two more romance novels with contemporary settings before switching to novels set during the English Regency era. She wrote a series of murder-mystery set in the Regency period with a recurring secondary character, the governess, Miss Tibbles, that enabled her to explore the limited choices available to women in the early 1800s, although, as the series became popular, Miss Tibbles became the lead character and found a traditional happy ending by marrying in middle age. Maelstrom and Gerver have two children, one of whom has Downs syndrome. this led her to take the unusual step of including characters with Downs syndrome in her novels, beginning with a romance entitled Twice Betrothed.

When the governor arrived the two men began quarreling, La Grange was imprisoned on a charge of high treason, and later was shipped back to France. Family Ren√© de Bethoulat √©cuyer, seigneur de La Grange-Fromenteau, was from a noble family of Champagne. He was appointed page of Fran√ßois de Bourbon, Duke of Montpensier (1542‚Äì1592), then squire of Henri, Prince of Cond√© (1588‚Äì1646), in 1611. He was made governor of the Ch√¢teau d'Amboise in 1614, and governor of the town of D√©ols in 1616. On 26 February 1620 he married Marie Jumeau, daughter of Denis Jumeau, artillery engineer. Their children were Charles de B√©toulat, seigneur de la Petitiere, Andr√© de B√©toulat, Comte de la Vauguoin, and Fran√ßoise de B√©toulat, who married Gabriel Imbert, seigneur de Petitval, cavalry captain. La Grange made a second marriage with Fran√ßoise Boyer. Appointment La Grange was aide de camp in the king's army in 1638. The governor of Saint Christophe, Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc, had died in 1636. Pierre du Halde had reluctantly taken over as acting governor. The Compagnie des √éles de l'Am√©rique agreed to make La Grange governor of Saint Christophe, but he found he did not have enough money to cover his travelling expenses. He met with Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy in Brest and offered to act as lieutenant to Poincy, who would be governor, if Poincy would cover his costs. The Company accepted the arrangement and on 6 January 1638 made Poincy captain general of Saint Christophe and La Grange lieutenant general. Poincy was also appointed the king's governor and lieutenant general of all the Islands of America for a three year period. Saint-Christophe Poincy lent La Grange 4,500 livres to fit himself out. La Grange left La Rochelle in April 1638 and arrived in Saint Christophe in June 1638 with his wife and family. He was to make preparations for Poincy's arrival. Du Halde could now return to France. While acting as governor La Grange gave his protection to the Capuchin friars, who prospered in Saint Christophe. La Grange planted and cultivated grape vines, from which he collected grapes at the end of six months. Two crops a year were normal, but wine production was not practical because the birds would eat the fruit. Poincy sailed from France on 11 January 1639 on Le Petite Europe and arrived in Martinique on 11 February 1639, where the governor Jacques Dyel du Parquet promised his obedience. He landed in Guadeloupe on 17 February 1639, where he met the governor Charles Li√©nard de L'Olive, then went on the Saint Christophe. There he found that La Grange had not prepared a house for him, but had only looked after himself. La Grange further antagonized him by sending him 18 African slaves as his share of the prize from a Dutch ship, while keeping 78 for himself. Relations quickly deteriorated between Poincy and La Grange, who thought himself the real leader of Saint Christophe, and La Grange's wife made matters worse. She insinuated that despite Poincy's vow of celibacy as a Knight of Malta he had a seraglio. According to Captain Thomas Southey (1827), On 16 October 1639 Poincy had La Grange and his wife tried and found guilty of high treason. Their slaves were all confiscated and they were taken to Basseterre. They could easily have escaped but feared that if they did they might be ambushed and killed. The island's council appealed to the king and the Company, and after eleven months in prison La Grange and his family were released. Poincy soon found an excuse to ship them back to France. Aftermath La Grange Fromenteau returned to France at the start of 1641. He began a lawsuit which was still not resolved after both La Grange an Poincy had died. In 1664 his children Andr√© and Fran√ßoise asserted their rights and claims on the island of Saint Christophe against the Order of Malta, which they had previously asserted against Poincy.

She was designed and constructed specifically for Robert Peary‚Ä≤s polar exploration expeditions, and she supported the 1908 expedition in which he claimed to have discovered the North Pole. After her career with Peary, Roosevelt saw commercial use as a tug. She also operated as a United States Bureau of Fisheries supply ship and served as a United States Navy patrol vessel during World War I.  Design and construction  United States Navy Commander Robert Peary designed Roosevelt specifically for operations in support of his Arctic exploration expeditions. His design attempted to incorporate the best features of previous polar exploration ships with innovations that would give her first-of-their-kind capabilities.Grigore, p. 14. Peary designed the ship along the same lines as the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen's schooner , with the capability both to push through large floating ice packs and squeeze through and between ice fields. Roosevelt was a schooner with an ice-strengthened flexible wooden hull sheathed in steel and braced by a unique system of trusses. The wooden construction of her hull gave it both strength and the flexibility to bend rather than break when ice struck it or pressed against it, and her hull planking was assembled through a lamination process that gave her hull greater strength than a single piece of wood could provide. Her hull was thick in places and was egg-shaped, a design that would allow her to rise and ride above sea ice that pushed against her below the waterline ‚Äì almost popping up out of the ice ‚Äì rather than be crushed by it.Grigore, pp. 14, 15 Her bow and stern both had steel plating; the bow plating extended from her keel to above the waterline and aft, while the stern plating also extended from the keel to above the waterline and extended forward. Between the bow and stern plating, a layer of steel of an inch (0.95 cm) thick and tall extended along the waterline. Previous Arctic exploration ships had relied on sails for their primary propulsion, with engine power secondary, but Roosevelt became the first such ship to reverse that principle. She had three masts, all of which could carry sails for auxiliary propulsion, but relied for propulsion primarily on a powerful compound steam engine ‚Äì equipped with a special system that allowed it to generate for brief periods if she encountered particularly massive ice concentrations ‚Äì that drove a single, large propeller in diameter on a -diameter shaft designed to generate powerful thrust that could push her through drift ice. She had a sharply raked stem intended to increase her ramming and cutting power against sea ice, and a short length at the waterline and narrow beam to give her increased maneuverability when steering between ice packs. Her rudder was of a special design that gave her the maximum possible steering capacity while exposing the rudder as little as possible to ice damage. Her design minimized auxiliary structures, both to allow the stowage of sufficient fuel, supplies, and provisions for lengthy stays in the Arctic and to give her a relatively shallow draft so that she could operate in shallow waters and close to shore. Roosevelt was the first ship ever built in the Western Hemisphere for Arctic exploration. Her construction cost was US$150,000 and was funded in part by a US$50,000 gift by George Crocker, the youngest son of banker Charles Crocker. The McKay and Dix Shipyard laid her keel at Bucksport, Maine, on 19 October 1904. Sponsored by Peary's wife, Josephine Peary,Grigore, p. 15. who broke a bottle of champagne encased in ice across Roosevelts bow, the ship was launched on 23 March 1905 and christened SS Roosevelt in honor of President Theodore Roosevelt, who had openly supported Peary and played an instrumental role in arranging for the U.S. Navy to grant Peary a leave of absence so that he could continue his Arctic explorations. After fitting out, she was delivered to her owner, the Peary Arctic Club, in July 1905. She drew considerable attention because of her innovative design and at the time of her construction she was considered the strongest wooden vessel ever built. Operational history =Peary expeditions= First Mate Thomas Gushue, Chief Engineer George A. Wardwell, and the crew of Roosevelt during the 1905‚Äì1906 polar expedition. On 16 July 1905, Roosevelt, captained by Robert Bartlett, set out from New York City on what was called the Roosevelt Expedition, sponsored by the Peary Arctic Club, with Peary and his party aboard. Roosevelt withstood a fire, rudder damage, and encounters with fog and icebergs and proceeded northward to Cape Sheridan in the north of Ellesmere Island. Made fast to the ice on 5 September 1905, she remained there through the winter of 1905‚Äì1906, becoming the second- largest ship ever to spend a winter in the Arctic. Peary and his party disembarked in January 1906 to head northward across the ice, and set a record for Farthest North, reaching a latitude of 87 degrees 6 minutes North before turning back. Roosevelt broke out of the ice on 4 July 1906, prior to the return of the expedition. Carried south, she crashed against an ice foot a few days later, losing propeller blades, her rudder, and her sternpost. On 30 July 1906, Peary and his party returned to her after a six-month absence, and on 24 August 1906 Roosevelt broke free and turned southward. By mid-September 1906 she was far enough south to assure her escape from the ice before the winter freeze and in December 1906 she arrived at New York City. On 8 July 1908, Roosevelt, again captained by Robert Bartlett, cleared New York Harbor and began a voyage north via Baffin Bay, Smith Sound, Kane Basin, Kennedy Channel, Hall Basin, and Robeson Channel into the Arctic Ocean. In early September 1908 she again made fast to the ice at Cape Sheridan to wait out the winter of 1908‚Äì1909 as Peary and his party tried for the North Pole. Departing Cape Sheridan in February 1909, Peary determined that he had reached the North Pole on 6 April 1909, and he and his party returned to Roosevelt. In July 1909, Roosevelt began the return voyage. In mid-August 1909 she left Smith Sound, and in September 1909 she rounded Cape Breton and Newfoundland and steamed to New York City. She arrived in New York flying the North Pole flag, the first ship ever to enter a harbor flying the flag. Not long afterward, she participated in a naval parade on the Hudson River as part of the 1909 Hudson- Fulton Anniversary Celebration. After his return to New York, Peary proposed that the Peary Arctic Club and the National Geographic Society jointly undertake an expedition to the Antarctic, with the Peary Arctic Club contributing Roosevelt to the expedition. However, Roosevelt required expensive repairs because of ice damage she had suffered, and the Antarctic expedition never took place.Grigore, pp. 15‚Äì16. =John Arbuckle= In August or November 1910, the Peary Arctic Club sold Roosevelt to Brooklyn, New York, tea, coffee, and sugar merchant John Arbuckle, for US$37,500. Arbuckle operated a fleet of vessels for salvaging wrecked ships and towing. Arbuckle had Roosevelt modified significantly, removing her foremast and transforming her into an oceangoing wrecking tug that successfully recovered several large steamships, including , as well as other wrecked ships. After Arbuckle died in 1912, Roosevelt was sold to H. E. J. McDermott and appeared as a \\"fishing vessel\\" in shipping lists of 1912, 1913, and 1914,Grigore, p. 16. but apparently she remained inactive with the rest of Arbuckle‚Ä≤s salvage fleet near the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City for three years. On 3 March 1915, the New York Times reported that John W. Sullivan and Company had purchased Roosevelt. That company made improvements to the ship which may have included replacing her coal-burning machinery with oil-fired propulsion, although sources differ on whether this conversion took place before or after the company sold her. =U.S. Bureau of Fisheries= On 21 April 1910, the United States Congress assigned the responsibility for the management and harvest of northern fur seals, foxes, and other fur-bearing animals in the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea, as well as for the care, education, and welfare of the Aleut communities in the islands, to the United States Bureau of Fisheries (BOF). Since then, the BOF had chartered commercial vessels to transport passengers and cargo to and from the Pribilof Islands. By 1915, the BOF had decided that a more cost-effective means of serving the islands would be to own and operate its own \\"Pribilof tender,\\" a dedicated cargo liner responsible for transportation to and from the Pribilofs. The BOF estimated that constructing a new ship capable of meeting its needs would cost at least US$100,000. Exploring cheaper alternatives, the BOF decided the idle Roosevelt would fulfill its requirements and purchased her from John W. Sullivan and Company in 1915 for US$40,000 to serve as its first \\"Pribilof tender.\\" On 19 July 1915,Grigore, p. 22. Roosevelt departed New York City bound for Norfolk, Virginia, to pick up coal for the Pribilofs, but during the voyage to Norfolk she suffered significant mechanical failures that required repairs at the Norfolk Navy Yard in Portsmouth, Virginia. A thorough inspection of her at the shipyard revealed that she needed additional repairs and a general overhaul, replacement of the foremast Arbuckle had removed, and the installation of a more efficient three-bladed propeller; this may also have been when the need to convert her from burning coal to burning fuel oil was identified. At the end of the summer of 1916, the demand for steel for use in World War I created a delay in forging Roosevelts new tail shaft, delaying her departure from Norfolk for several more months. While she was lying idle, the eighth annual Convention of the Southern Commercial Congress took place in Norfolk in December 1916, and she and the BOF steamer participated in it, exhibiting several fishery-related items and devices. Ultimately, the total cost of the ship and her repairs came to US$72,000, but it was still a significant saving compared to the estimated cost of constructing a new vessel. With her repairs finally complete, Roosevelt departed Norfolk on 23 January 1917, bound for Seattle, Washington, but endured further delays en route, first impeded by an international incident which detained her for over a month at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, followed by yet another delay of three weeks for repairs at Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone. She finally arrived at Seattle on 23 April 1917, carrying supplies for the United States Navy and the United States Lighthouse Service. On 4 July 1917, a dedication ceremony took place in Seattle to mark the opening of the Government Locks, which connected Puget Sound with the Lake Washington Ship Canal and Lake Washington, and Roosevelt ‚Äì leading a flotilla of hundreds of boats that included the newly built BOF boat USFS Auklet ‚Äì became the first large ocean-going vessel to enter the canal and the first such ship to enter Lake Washington. On 7 July 1917, Roosevelt began her duties as the first \\"Pribilof tender,\\" departing Seattle for the Pribilof Islands and Unalaska in the Aleutian Islands, the beginning of the 58-year history of the United States Government-operated \\"Pribilof tenders.\\" She made two voyages to the Pribilof Islands during 1917, carrying personnel, building materials, and supplies. On her return trip in August 1917, she hauled 4,882 sealskins and 606 fox skins to Seattle for rail shipment to St. Louis, Missouri, where they were prepared for auction. The BOF calculated that the money it saved by operating Roosevelt as its \\"Pribilof tender\\" rather than chartering commercial vessels in Roosevelt‚Ä≤s first year alone more than made up for the cost of purchasing Roosevelt. When Roosevelt made a voyage to the Pribilofs in January 1918, it marked the first time that it was possible to sail reliably to the Pribilof Islands in the winter. =United States Navy= Meanwhile, the United States had entered World War I on 6 April 1917, and on 18 March 1918 Roosevelt was transferred to the United States Navy for war service. The Navy commissioned her the same day as the patrol vessel USS Roosevelt (SP-2397). Armed with three 3-pounder guns and based at Seattle, she was assigned to the section patrol in the Thirteenth Naval District. She patrolled in the waters of the Pacific Northwest and Territory of Alaska through the end of the war on 11 November 1918. While in naval service, Roosevelt continued her \\"Pribilof tender\\" duties, making voyages on behalf of the BOF between Seattle, Unalaska, and the Pribilof Islands. On 27 April 1918, she departed Seattle bound for the Pribilofs filled with a load of cargo that included three one-ton trucks. The ship was unloading supplies at the Pribilofs when diphtheria broke out among her crew. After the physician on Saint Paul Island administered an antitoxin, she steamed to Unalaska in the Aleutian Islands for quarantine. The disease was confined to the ship, with no cases of diphtheria reported among people in the Pribilofs. While Roosevelt was quarantined at Unalaska, several cannery vessels carrying workers became stuck in pack ice in Bristol Bay. The ice threatened to sink the vessels and kill many of those aboard them. The Navy sent Roosevelt to render assistance. She was delayed by her quarantine for three days, but departed Unalaska on 27 May 1918. She encountered ice as thick as , but her hull, designed for Peary‚Ä≤s expeditions in the Arctic, allowed her to cut through it. She saved 21 people who had abandoned the sunken vessel Tacoma and taken refuge on an ice floe. The other 115 passengers from Tacoma had boarded the vessel St. Nicholas, but St. Nicholas, with over 300 people aboard, was herself within an estimated 12 hours of sinking when Roosevelt arrived to tow her to safety. Over the next few weeks she also towed Centennial, carrying 161 persons and probably within a week of sinking, Star of Chile, with 220 people aboard, and two other vessels out of danger. As a result, the cannery associations sent letters of appreciation and commendation to Roosevelts captain and crew. Roosevelt received only minimal damage during the rescue operation. On 17 January 1919, a little over two months after the conclusion of World War I, it was reported that Roosevelt needed extensive repairs and an overhaul, and the Steamboat Inspection Service later confirmed it. She arrived at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, on 21 April 1919, where she was discovered to have dry rot. After additional inspections, the cost of repairs was estimated at US$186,000, which the BOF deemed prohibitive. Roosevelt was condemned on 4 June 1919, and the Navy transferred her to the BOF on 11 June 1919. The BOF moved her to Seattle for auction. Her crew remained aboard her long enough to transfer equipment from her to her replacement, , which the BOF had purchased in the summer of 1919 to serve as its next \\"Pribilof tender\\". On 15 July 1919, Roosevelt was sold in an auction at Salmon Bay Wharf in Seattle for US$28,000 to the high bidder, Captain M. E. Tallakson. =Later career= After her sale, Roosevelt was resold several times but ultimately was rebuilt and issued a certificate of seaworthiness by the Steamboat Inspection Service. She operated in the Pacific Northwest as a 700-ton-capacity cargo ship. In April 1923, the West Coast Tug Company acquired her and modified her into a powerful oceangoing towing tug, and she became what was considered the largest commercial tug on the United States West Coast. Over the next 18 months, she established a reputation for successfully towing vessels in all weather and in record times and in June 1924 she set a record for the largest tow by a single tug in history when she towed the decommissioned 16,000-ton U.S. Navy battleship from Seattle to Oakland, California. In November 1924 the Washington Tug and Barge Company of Seattle acquired Roosevelt and put her to work towing lumber barges between Puget Sound and California. She averaged two round trips per month, considered an impressive tempo of operations. On a six-day trip from Puget Sound to San Pedro, California, in August 1925, she averaged while towing the ocean-going barge Decula loaded with 2.4 million feet of lumber. While operating as a tug, Roosevelt had a number of mishaps. During the winter in early 1926 she lost her rudder while towing two barges from Seattle to Miami, Florida, and she drifted for days in the Pacific Ocean before the Panama Canal tug Tavernilla found her and towed her to Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone. On 24 December 1929, she was towing the ex-mail vessel Starr in a heavy gale off the Territory of Alaska when the tow line parted and tangled in her propeller, disabling her. Starr set anchor, but Roosevelt nonetheless drifted dangerously close to Wessels Reef near Middleton Island. The halibut-fishing schooner Attu arrived on the scene and towed Roosevelt to safety. In late December 1931, she was towing the racing schooner Commodore in a violent gale off Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, when her towline apparently parted and her radio room flooded. Her seven-man crew sent out a distress signal before her radio failed, but she managed to reach Neah Bay on the northwest coast of Washington, where she rode out the storm. The Steamboat Inspection Service inspected Roosevelt for the final time on 22 May 1936 and did not renew her license. Shortly afterwards, the California Towing Company of San Francisco, California, purchased her. In what turned out to be her last voyage, she left Seattle on 31 October 1936 bound for New York City, towing the decommissioned 19,250-ton U.S. Navy collier , She encountered heavy seas in the Pacific Ocean that strained her aging hull, and a leaking condenser forced her to put into San Francisco for three days for repairs. She resumed her voyage, but on 8 December 1936 her chief engineer reported to her captain that her engine needed to be stopped; the captain ordered him to keep it running, and Roosevelt limped into Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone on 12 December 1936. After undergoing repairs at Balboa, she transited the Panama Canal on 23 December 1936, and on 24 December 1936 she left Crist√≥bal in the Panama Canal Zone and set out into the Caribbean Sea. By that evening, a leaking fuel tank and filled her bilge with fuel oil and, due to the danger of a fire breaking out, she returned to Crist√≥bal. After more repairs, Roosevelt again departed Crist√≥bal on 8 January 1937. She had steamed about into the Caribbean Sea when, on 14 January 1937, she reported herself unable to handle her tow due to heavy seas, a leaking hull, and engine and boiler problems. The Panama Canal tug Tavernilla set out on 15 January 1937 to rendezvous with Roosevelt and relieve her of her tow of Jason, but when Tavernilla met Roosevelt on 16 January 1937, she was unable to take over the tow due to heavy seas. Tavernilla returned to Crist√≥bal shortly before midnight on 16 January, and Roosevelt arrived there with Jason in tow early on 17 January 1937. During her ordeal, Roosevelt‚Ä≤s forward topmast had fallen and the booms had been carried away. With her hull still leaking, Roosevelt arrived at Mount Hope Shipyard in the Panama Canal Zone for repairs on 20 January 1937. No repairs were made, however, and to keep her from sinking alongside the pier she was beached on a mud bank in the Old French Canal on 21 January 1937. Her crew, whose pay was long overdue, salvaged equipment from her to compensate for unpaid wages, and she was abandoned on the mud bank. An effort to have her salvaged and preserved as a museum failed, and she subsequently rotted away where she had been beached.Grigore, pp. 14, 22  References  =Footnotes= =Bibliography= Grigore, Julius Jr. ‚ÄúPeary and the Roosevelt: When Man and Ship Were One.‚Äù Panama Canal Review, Vol. 16, No. 5, August 1965, pp. 14-16, 22.

Masiello was elected as a Fellow of the Geological Society of America in 2017. She currently leads an interdisciplinary team of scientists who are developing microbial sensors for earth system science.  Early life and education  Masiello moved several times as a child, attending high school in Indiana, Pennsylvania. Here she attended the Pennsylvania's Governor's School for Sciences. She majored in Physics and Math at Earlham College, where she played soccer and graduated with honors in 1991. She went onto earn a Master of Science in Environmental Sciences from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1993 and a Master of Science in Physical Chemistry from the University of California, Irvine in 1996. While at UC- Irvine Masiello worked with Ellen R.M. Druffel, developing biogeochemical tools to examine carbon pools. Her thesis, Radiocarbon measurements of black carbon in sediments of a small river, examined the temporal shifts of the particulate and dissolved carbon exported from the Santa Clara River, CA. using Œî14C, earning her a Ph.D. in Earth System Science from UC-Irvine in 1999.  Career and research  After her graduate studies, Masiello worked as a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (1999-2002) and with the Geography Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara (2002-2004). She was appointed to the faculty at Rice University in 2004 where she serves as a member of the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences. Masiello's research focuses on developing tools that allow her to understand how elements are cycling around the planet, this includes tools that track how cells communicate to one another (e.g.) to others that allow us to follow organic carbon pools from the atmosphere to mountain slopes to the ocean (eg.). In particular, her group focuses on how carbon is stored, transformed, and transported in and through soils, rivers, and oceans; thus it has contributed to basic and applied research in the fields of organic geochemistry and biogeochemistry. In particular her work has advanced our knowledge of black carbon (and biochar) within both aquatic and terrestrial environments (e.g.).

The show, like all of CMLL's major shows took place in Arena M√©xico, Mexico City, Mexico, CMLL's home venue. The event was to honor and remember CMLL founder Salvador Lutteroth, who died in March 1987. Starting in 1999 CMLL honored not just their founder during the show, but also a second lucha libre legend, making it their version of a Hall of Fame event. For the 2018 show CMLL commemorated the life and career of wrestler Mil M√°scaras. This was the 20th March show held under the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas name, having previously been known as Homenaje a Salvador Lutteroth from 1996 to 1998. The main event of the show was a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match, where El Cuatrero defeated √Ångel de Oro, after which √Ångel de Oro was forced to unmask and reveal his real name to everyone: Miguel √Ångel Ch√°vez Velasco. In the semi-main event the Sky Team duo of Valiente and Volador Jr. defeated the team of El Terrible and Rey Bucanero in the finals of a tournament for the vacant CMLL World Tag Team Championship. The show included four additional Six-woman \\"Lucha Libre rules\\" tag team matches. Production =Background= Since 1996 the Mexican wrestling company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (Spanish for \\"World Wrestling Council\\"; CMLL) has held a show in March each year to commemorate the passing of CMLL founder Salvador Lutteroth who died in March 1987. For the first three years the show paid homage to Lutteroth himself, from 1999 through 2004 the show paid homage to Lutteroth and El Santo, Mexico's most famous wrestler ever and from 2005 forward the show has paid homage to Lutteroth and a different leyenda (\\"Legend\\") each year, celebrating the career and accomplishments of past CMLL stars. Originally billed as Homenaje a Salvador Lutteroth, it has been held under the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (\\"Homage to two legends\\") since 1999 and is the only show outside of CMLL's Anniversary shows that CMLL has presented every year since its inception. All Homenaje a Dos Leyendas shows have been held in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \\"home\\". Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, which means the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas shows replace their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. The 2018 show was the 24th overall Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show produced by CMLL. =Storylines= The Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. =Homage to Salvador Lutteroth and Mil M√°scaras= In September 1933 Salvador Lutteroth Gonz√°lez founded Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL), which would later be renamed Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre. Over time Lutteroth would become responsible for building both Arena Coliseo in Mexico City and Arena Mexico, which became known as \\"The Cathedral of Lucha Libre\\". Over time EMLL became the oldest wrestling promotion in the world, with 2018 marking the 85th year of its existence. Lutteroth has often been credited with being the \\"father of Lucha Libre\\" introducing the concept of masked wrestlers to Mexico as well as the Luchas de Apuestas match. Lutteroth died on September 5, 1987. EMLL, late CMLL, remained under the ownership and control of the Lutteroth family as first Salvador's son Chavo Lutteroth and later his grandson Paco Alonso took over ownership of the company. The life and achievements of Salvador Lutteroth is always honored at the annual Homenaje a Dos Leyenda' show, since 1999 CMLL has also honored a second person, a Leyenda of lucha libre, in some ways CMLL's version of their Hall of Fame. For the 2018 show CMLL honored the life and career of Mil M√°scaras (\\"Thousand Masks\\") who, despite being 76 years old, was still a semi-active wrestler at the time of the event. Mil M√°scaras made his wrestling debut in 1964 for what was then EMLL, quickly gaining attention as a very physically imposing but fast heavyweight wrestler in an era where most heavyweights were slower and often not Mexican. While other lucha libre legends like El Santo or Blue Demon worked most of their careers in Mexico, Mil M√°scaras worked extensively in both the United States and Japan, leading to his high international exposure. His popularity led to several matches at Madison Square Garden for the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF; now known as WWE). At the time wrestlers were not allowed to wear masks that fully covered their face when working in New York, but the popularity of Mil M√°scaras and his refusal to work unmasked led to that rule being abandoned after overwhelming pressure from promoters and fans alike. He is also a lucha film star, having appeared in over 20 films since the eponymous Mil M√°scaras in 1966, the latest being the 2015 film Aztec Revenge. After the conclusion of the third match of the evening, Mil M√°scaras was honored by CMLL in the ring. As part of the ceremony Sofia Alonso, great-granddaughter of Salvador Lutteroth presented Mil M√°scaras with a special Commemorative plaque for his career achievements. Mil M√°scaras thanked Sofia Alonso specifically for bringing him back to Arena M√©xico for the first time since 2010.

JMSDF was eager to introduce automated GFCS that supported automatic radar tracking, such as the American Mk 56, but it was rejected by the US Navy. Under the FY1955 program, a budget for purchasing one automated FCS overseas was approved. Jaberg (manufactured by Contraves) was selected and installed in in 1958. It was used for testing and research. Based on the results, the began development of a domestic GFCS. In FY1965, a prototype was installed on . This system got a good result and was titled Type 68. However, it was too advanced for the fleet, so a simplified model was developed and installed on in 1968, named Type 72, which became a mass-production model. Design The prototype used a combination of unmanned radar director and manned electro-optical director, and was capable of track while scan (TWS). These two directors were integrated into one manned director as American Mk 56. TWS capability was omitted in the mass-production models. An electromechanical analog computer was used for fire-control. In the mass-production models, transistors were introduced for their radar and computer (replacing vacuum tubes). The prototype model measured the angular velocity of the line of sight by gyroscopic means (relative-rate) systems, and in the mass-production models, linear-rate systems were introduced.

Biography Hochschild was born to a Jewish family, the son of Justina (n√©e Bendheim) and Koppel Jakob Hochschild. His brother was Berthold Hochschild (1860‚Äì1928) who later founded the American Metal Company. Zachary worked as a youth for the Frankfurt metal company, Philipp Abraham Cohen and received in 1878, procuration or the authority to act on behalf of the company. In 1881, Hochschild along with his brother-in-law Leo Ellinger and Wilhelm Merton took over the activities of Philipp Abraham Cohen and co-founded Metallgesellschaft AG in Frankfurt with 2 million Marks in share capital. As Hochschild was a long term executive at Cohen, he was its sole member of the board. Responsibilities were divided: Hochschild focused on marketing, trading, and international activities; Merton was responsible for business strategy; and Ellinger for operations. Their main competition were the two other large metal trading companies of Germany: Aron Hirsch & Sohn in Halberstadt, and Beer, Sondheimer & Co in Frankfurt am Main, also closely held Jewish family companies. Although Metallgesellschaft was a joint stock company, it was operated like a family business with key positions allocated to long-time loyal employees who were gradually rewarded with stock in the company. He is credited with opening up the company to international sources of metals which satisfied German demand. In 1884, Hochschild sent his brother Berthold to the United States to establish an operation.Stack, Elizabeth.

Specifically, they are the cellular devices used by pathogenic bacteria to secrete their virulence factors (mainly of proteins) to invade the host cells. They can be classified into different types based on their specific structure, composition and activity. These major differences can be distinguished between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. But the classification is by no means clear and complete. There are at least eight types specific to Gram-negative bacteria, four to Gram-positive bacteria, while two are common to both. Generally, proteins can be secreted through two different processes. One process is a one-step mechanism in which proteins from the cytoplasm of bacteria are transported and delivered directly through the cell membrane into the host cell. Another involves a two-step activity in which the proteins are first transported out of the inner cell membrane, then deposited in the periplasm, and finally through the outer cell membrane into the host cell.

Secretion systems in diderm bacteria Sec system The general secretion (Sec) involves secretion of unfolded proteins that first remain inside the cells. In Gram-negative bacteria, the secreted protein is sent to either the inner membrane or the periplasm. But in Gram-positive bacteria, the protein can stay in the cell or is mostly transported out of the bacteria using other secretion systems. Among Gram-negative bacteria, Vibrio cholerae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Yersinia enterocolitica use the Sec system. Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes are Gram-positive bacteria that use the Sec system. The Sec system utilises two different pathways for secretion: the SecA and signal recognition particle (SRP) pathways. SecA is an ATPase motor protein and has many related proteins including SecD, SecE, SecF, SegG, SecM, and SecY. SRP is a ribonucleoprotein (protein-RNA complex) that recognizes and targets specific proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes and to the cell membrane in prokaryotes. The two pathways require different molecular chaperones and ultimately use a protein-transporting channel SecYEG for transporting the proteins across the inner cell membrane. In the SecA pathway, SecB acts as a chaperone, helping protein transport to the periplasm after complete synthesis of the peptide chains. Whereas in the SRP pathway, YidC is the chaperone, and transport proteins to the cell membrane while they are still undergoing peptide synthesis. =SecA or post-translational pathway= Proteins are synthesised in ribosomes by a process of serially adding amino acids, called translation. In SecA pathway, a chaperone trigger factor (TF) first bind to the exposed N-terminal signal sequence of the peptide chain. As elongation of peptide chain continues, TF is replaced by SecB. SecB specifically maintains the peptide in an unfolded state, and aids in the binding of SecA. The complex can then bind to SecYEG, by which SecA is activated by binding with ATP. Driven by ATP energy, SecA pushes the protein through the secYEG channel. SecD/F complex also helps in the pulling of the protein from the other side of the cell membrane. =SRP pathway= In this pathway, SRP competes with TF and binds to the N-terminal signal sequence. Proteins from inner membrane stops the process of chain elongation. The SRP then binds to a membrane receptor, FtsY. The peptide chain-SRP-FtsY complex is then transported to SecY, where peptide elongation resumes. Tat system The twin arginine translocation (Tat) system is similar to Sec in the process of protein secretion, however, it sends proteins only in their folded (tertiary) state. It is used by all types of bacteria, as well as archaea, and chloroplasts and mitochondria of plants. In bacteria, the Tat system exports proteins from the cytoplasm across the inner cell membrane; whereas in chloroplasts, it is present in the thylakoid membrane where it aids the import of proteins from the stroma. Tat proteins are highly variable in different bacteria and are classified into three major types, namely TatA, TatB, and TatC. For example, while there are only two functional Tat proteins in Bacillus subtilis, there can be over a hundred in Streptomyces coelicolor. Signal peptides that can recognise the Tat proteins are characterised by a consensus motif Ser/Thr-Arg-Arg-X-Phe-Leu-Lys (where X can be any polar amino acid). It is the two successive arginines from which the name twin arginine translocation came from. Replacement of any of the arginine leads to slow down or failure of secretion.  Type I  Type I secretion system (T1SS or TOSS) is found in Gram-negative bacteria. It depends on chaperone activity using Hly and Tol proteins. The system activates as a signal sequence HlyA binds HlyB on the cell membrane. This signal sequence is an ABC transporter. The HlyAB complex activates HlyD which uncoils and moves to the outer cell membrane. The terminal signal is recognised by TolC in the inner membrane. The HlyA is secreted out of the outer membrane through a tunnel-like protein channel. T1SS transports various molecules including ions, carbohydrates, drugs, proteins. The secreted molecules vary in size from the small Escherichia coli peptide colicin V, which is 10 kDa, to the Pseudomonas fluorescens cell adhesion protein LapA, which is 520 kDa. Among the most well known molecules are RTX toxins and lipase enzymes. Type II  Type II (T2SS) secretion system depends on the Sec or Tat system for initial secretion inside the bacterial cell. From the periplasm, proteins are secreted out of the outer membrane secretins. Secretins are multimeric (12‚Äì14 subunits) complex of pore-forming proteins. Secretin is supported by 10‚Äì15 other inner and outer membrane proteins to constitute the complete secretion apparatus. Type III  Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS) is structurally similar and related to the basal body of bacterial flagella. Seen in some of the most virulent Gram- negative bacteria such as Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Vibrio, it is used for injecting toxic proteins into eukaryotic cells. For its structure, it is often described as injectisomes or needle and syringe-like apparatus. Discovered from Yersinia pestis, it was found that T3SS can injected toxins directly from the bacterial cytoplasm into the cytoplasm of its host's cells. Type IV  Type IV secretion system (T4SS or TFSS) is related to bacterial conjugation system, by which different bacteria can exchange their DNAs. The participating bacteria can be of the same or different Gram-negative bacterial species. It can transport single proteins, as well as protein-protein and DNA- protein complexes. Secretion is transferred directly from the recipient cell through the cell membranes. Agrobacterium tumefaciens, from which it was originally discovered, uses this system to send the T-DNA portion of the Ti plasmid into plant cells, in which a crown gall (tumor) is produced as a result. Helicobacter pylori uses it for delivering CagA into gastric epithelial cells, to induce gastric cancer. Bordetella pertussis, the causative bacterium of whooping cough, secretes its pertussis toxin partly through T4SS. Legionella pneumophila that causes legionellosis (Legionnaires' disease) has a T4SS called icm/dot (intracellular multiplication/defect in organelle trafficking genes) that transport many bacterial proteins into its eukaryotic host. More recently, it has been shown that the phytopathogen Xanthomonas citri utilizes its T4SS to secrete effectors that are lethal to other bacterial species, thus placing this system as a major fitness determinant of interspecies bacterial competition. The prototypic Type IVA secretion system is the VirB complex of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.  Type V  Type V secretion systems (T5SS) are different from other secretion systems in that they secrete themselves and only involves the outer cell membrane. For secreted protein to pass through the inner cell membrane, T5SS depends on Sec system. They have a Œ≤-barrel domain, which inserts into the outer cell membrane and forms a channel that can transport secreted protein along with it. For this activity, they are also called the autotransporter systems. When the secreted proteins are exposed outside, the autotransporters are cut off (cleaved), releasing the protein from the Œ≤-barrel domain. An example of autotransporter is the Trimeric Autotransporter Adhesins. Type VI  Type VI secretion systems (T6SS) were discovered by the team of John Mekalanos at the Harvard Medical School in 2006 from Vibrio cholerae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They were recognised when mutations in the Vibrio Cholerae Hcp and VrgG genes caused diminished virulence and pathogenicity. In addition to their classic role as the pathogenicity factor, T6SS are also involved in defense against simple eukaryotic predators and in inter-bacteria interactions. The gene for T6SS form a gene cluster that consists of more than 15 genes. Hcp and VgrG genes are the most universal genes. Structural similarity of T6SS with the tail spike of the T4 phage suggest that the process of infection is similar to that of the phage. Type VII  Type VII secretion system (T7SS) is present in Gram-positive bacteria and Mycobacteria such as M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, Streptomyces coelicolor and S. aureus. It is also called T7b system in Bacillus subtilis and S. aureus. It is composed of two basic components: a membrane-bound hexameric ATPase that is member of the FtsK/SpoIIIE protein family, and any one of the EsxA/EsxB-related protein such as EsaA, EsaD, EsxB, EsxD, as well as Ess system (EssA, EssB, and EsxC found in S. aureus). EsxA and EsxB belong to a superfamily of WXG100 proteins that form dimeric helical hairpins. In S. aureus, T7SS secretes a large toxin called EsaD, which is a member of nuclease enzymes. EsaD is made harmless (detoxified) during its biosynthesis with the help of its counterpart antitoxin EsaG. The EsaD-EsaG complex then binds with EsaE. The EsaE portion binds to EssC, which is the an enzyme ATPase of the T7SS complex. During secretion, EsaG is left in the cytoplasm, and only EsaD and EsaE are secreted together. But in some strains of S. aureus, EsaD is not produced, but two copies of EsaG-like proteins are formed instead. This might explain the occurrence of T7SS in non-pathogenic species such as B. subtilis and S. coelicolor. Type IX  Type IX secretion systems (T9SS) are found regularly in the Fibrobacteres-Chlorobi-Bacteroidetes lineage of bacteria, where member species include an outer membrane. The system is involved variably in one type of gliding motility, in the proper targeting of certain virulence factors to the cell surface, and the degradation of complex of biopolymers. T9SS has also been known as Por secretion, after the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis. At least sixteen structural components of the system have been described, including PorU, a protein-sorting transpeptidase that removes the C-terminal sorting signal from cargo proteins and mediates their attachment instead to lipopolysaccharide.

She championed nuts through the museum, and by creating portraits of a variety of nuts and nutcrackers. She was the daughter of aristocratic Armenian immigrants and studied at the New York school of Applied Design for Women as well as the National Academy of Design. Later in life, she appeared on the shows of Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Jay Leno, Howard Stern and Chevy Chase among others, to promote nuts and the Nut Museum. At the age of seven, her parents divorced. By the age of nine, Tashjian was a concert violinist living with her mother in New York City's Upper West Side. Tashjian remained unmarried throughout her life. In middle age, Tashjian followed her mother in becoming a Christian Science healer. She also espoused a tongue-in-cheek theory that humans had possibly evolved from nuts. In 1950, Tashjian and her mother moved into a large Gothic Revival mansion in Old Lyme. Upon her father's death in 1958 she learned he had left her nothing. She continued to live alone in her mansion following her mother's death in 1959. Nuts were a lifelong passion. At the New York School of Applied Design for Women and the National Academy of Design, Tashjian created many paintings of nuts and nutcrackers - themes she would continue throughout her life. In 1972, Tashjian founded the Nut Museum in the mansion. The collection contained only twenty nuts, and was composed largely of her own artwork including over one hundred paintings, twenty aluminum sculptures, nut art, nut jewelry and a Nativity scene made completely of nuts. Many specimens were donated by visitors. The Nut Anthem and Nuts Are Beautiful, two songs composed by Tashjian, were performed for all visitors. She hoped to expand the museum into a theme-park larger than Disneyland. Tashjian claimed she did not know the pejorative use of the word \\"nut\\" until after establishing her museum, but made frequent comments suggesting she wanted to de-stigmatize the word and the people associated with it. In 2002, after falling in to a coma, Tashjian was declared incompetent and a ward of the state. Despite religious beliefs refusing medical treatment, she recovered, but was confined to a nursing home. The contents of the Nut Museum were removed by Christopher B. Steiner, a professor of Art History and Museum Studies at Connecticut College, after he successfully petitioned the Old Lyme Probate Court to recognize the historic and artistic significance of the collection. The mansion was sold to pay her debts. Steiner remained a supporter and advocate for the rest of her life. In 2004, an exhibition of Tashjian's artwork, The Nut Museum: Visionary Art of Elizabeth Tashjian was held at the Lyman Allyn Museum in New London. It was organized by Steiner. In 2005, Tashjian was declared competent. Her house had at this point twice been sold, when she began proceedings to have it returned. The nut trees on the property had all been removed. She died in 2007. In popular culture Tashjian was a popular guest on talk shows throughout the 1980s. In a Nutshell, a 2005 film by Don Bernier, documented Tashjian's life. After her death, Steiner resumed work on a book, Performing the Nut Museum: Elizabeth Tashjian and the Art of the Double Entendre, which has yet to be published.

The six guns built were held in reserve between the wars and were not mobilized by France during World War II. History Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. Two sources of heavy artillery suitable for conversion to field use were surplus coastal defense guns and naval guns. However, a paradox faced artillery designers of the time; while large caliber naval guns were common, large caliber land weapons were not due to their weight, complexity, and lack of mobility. Large caliber field guns often required extensive site preparation because the guns had to be broken down into multiple loads light enough to be towed by a horse team or the few traction engines of the time and then reassembled before use. Building a new gun could address the problem of disassembling, transporting and reassembling a large gun, but it did not necessarily address how to convert existing heavy weapons to make them more mobile. Rail transport proved to be the most practical solution because the problems of heavy weight, lack of mobility and reduced setup time were addressed. Design The mle 75/79 started life as Canon de 370 mod√®le 1875/1879 naval guns which were the primary armament of the two Amiral Baudin- class ironclads of the French Navy. The guns were typical built-up guns of the period with several layers of steel reinforcing hoops. The guns used an interrupted screw breech and fired separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. To load the gun barrel was lowered and a shell was brought forward by an elevated hoist on the rear of the carriage. The guns consisted of a large rectangular steel base, which was suspended on two eight-axle articulated rail bogies manufactured by Schneider. The number of axles was determined by the weight limit for European railways of 17 tonnes per axle. The carriage was similar to that used by the contemporary Obusier de 520 mod√®le 1916 produced by Schneider. Since the carriage did not have a traversing mechanism it was aimed by drawing the guns across a section of curved track. Once in firing position, a section of rail bed was reinforced with wood and iron beams to support the weight of the gun. Five steel beams under the center of the carriage were then lowered to lay across the tracks and the carriage was jacked up to take weight off the bogies and anchor the gun in place. There were another two beams located between the quadruple bogies on each end of the carriage. When the gun fired the entire carriage recoiled a few feet and was stopped by the friction of the beams on the tracks. The carriage was then lowered onto its axles and was either pushed back into place with a shunting locomotive or a windlass mounted on the front of the carriage pulled the carriage back into position. This cheap, simple and effective system came to characterize Schneider's railway guns during the later war years and is known as the Glissement system. Comparison to other French heavyweight guns * Unlike the earlier Obusier de 370 mod√®le 1915 and Obusier de 400 Mod√®le 1915/1916 the barrels for the mle 75/79 were not shortened or bored out to . * The mle 75/79 were classified as cannons rather than howitzers so their maximum elevation of +40¬∞ gave their projectiles a different trajectory. * The mle 75/79 had higher muzzle velocity and greater range than either of the previous two howitzers mentioned. *Due to the greater weight of the mle 75/79 , its carriage was longer and more elaborate than previous railway guns. In order to distribute this weight, there were more axles and the bogies were articulated to reduce stress on the tracks. *The ammunition hoists, shell rammers, and elevation controls were all electrically powered and according to Railway Artillery, vols. I and II they may have not been reliable enough to withstand the stress of firing. World War I The six guns were delivered too late to participate in the First World War and remained in reserve between the wars. World War II At the outbreak of the Second World War the six guns remained in reserve and were not mobilized. The Germans assigned the designation 37cm H(E) 714(f) but what use they made of them is unknown.

Life  Roger Keith Kelsall was born at Milngavie in Scotland on 23 January 1910, the son of a Scottish civil engineer and his English wife. He attended Kelvinside Academy, then the University of Glasgow where he studied history and political economy. After briefly working for the Distribution Society and as a tutor at Bonar Law College, Kelsall was appointed an assistant lecturer at Hull University College in about 1935. In 1942, he moved to the new Ministry of Town and Country Planning; after the Second World War, he worked under David Glass at the London School of Economics on Glass's study of social mobility. In 1951, Kelsall was involved in the establishment of the British Sociological Association; in 1956, he joined the University of Sheffield as head of the School of Social Studies, which then ran non-graduate social studies programmes. The School became the Department of Sociological Studies in 1960, and Kelsall was appointed to the university's first Chair of Sociological Studies; he and Peter H.

It occurs in the tropical and subtropical western Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. It was first described in 1802 by the French naturalist Louis Augustin Guillaume Bosc, one of fourteen marine invertebrates described and named by him. Description Bunodosoma cavernatum A. Live specimen in natural habitat, B. Oral view, C. Lateral view, D.-I. Sections, J.‚ÄìT. Cnidae Bunodosoma cavernatum is a robust species with a muscular trunk covered with 96 vertical rows of small, rounded, wart-like vesicles. The oral disc is smooth and the approximately 96 tentacles are arranged in five cycles. Each tentacle is of moderate length, smooth and tapering, the inner tentacles being longer than the outer ones. At their base are about 48 rounded lobular projections called acrorhagi which are armed with stinging cells. The colour of the trunk varies, being some shade of olive green, orange, red or brown. The tentacles are olive green, pale orange or reddish, with the oral disc being yellowish-brown, reddish-brown or olive green, sometimes with faint pale radial striping. When fully extended this sea anemone can reach in height, and the tentacles and oral disc when extended can reach in diameter. Distribution and habitat Bunodosoma cavernatum is native to the tropical and subtropical western Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, its range extending from North Carolina to Texas, including Florida and the West Indies. It occurs in the lower part of the intertidal zone on rocks and jetties, and on other hard substrates underlying gravelly or sandy bottoms. Ecology Bunodosoma cavernatum is nocturnal; during the night it expands and spreads out its tentacles to feed but during the day, it contracts into a reddish gelatinous blob. It feeds on small fish and any invertebrates that are encountered by its tentacles. The remains of a scorched mussel (Brachidontes exustus) have been found inside one individual.

It is based on William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, and focus on the Jewish Shylock character, that play's principal antagonist. Wesker began writing the play after seeing a 1973 performance by Laurence Olivier. It premiered in Stockholm in 1976 and was later renamed Shylock. The play was meant to premiere on Broadway in 1977, but the Broadway production was cancelled due to the death of the plays' lead, multiple Tony Award winner Zero Mostel. Wesker had high hopes that the play would make a big profit, but this did not happen. He wrote a book about the play in 1999, The Birth of Shylock and the Death of Zero Mostel. In this play, Shylock is a good man and Antonio's, the title character in Shakespeare's play, good friend. They bond in their love of knowledge and mutual dislike of the antisemitism in their community. Shylock's demand for a pound of flesh is meant as a jest, but he can not retract it. Both Shylock and Antonio are relieved when the demand is denied in court. Reviewing The Merchant, critic Michael Billington wrote \\"Wesker‚Äôs point comes across clearly: that anti- Jewish prejudice is ingrained in English life.\\" John Gross, another critic, stated that \\"As a humanistic sermon, The Merchant has much to recommend it.

This was the most senior Chinese position in the colonial civil bureaucracy of the Dutch East Indies. As Majoor, Tan was also the Chairman of the Chinese Council of Batavia (Dutch: Chinese Raad; Indonesian: Kong Koan), the city's highest Chinese government body. Life =Background and early career= A litograph of Batavia, based on a drawing by C. Deeleman (1859). Born in 1816 in Batavia into a Peranakan Chinese family, the names of Tan Tjoen Tiat's antecedents have been lost to posterity. His wife, Oey Tan Nio, is nonetheless recorded as the daughter of Kapitein Oey Eng Liok (appointed to his position in 1838), thus linking the future Majoor by marriage to the Cabang Atas aristocracy of colonial Indonesia. In 1850, during the mayoralty of his predecessor Majoor Tan Eng Goan (the first to hold the mayoral office in Batavia), Tan Tjoen Tiat was himself raised to the Chinese officer class as a Luitenant. This was the most junior rank in the Chinese officership, part of the civil bureaucracy of the Dutch East Indies. Despite having the same surname as Majoor Tan Eng Goan, the two Tans were not related. Indeed, Luitenant Tan Tjoen Tiat did not hide his disappointment in the Majoor's meek handling of the scandalous case of the playboy Oey Tamba Sia (1827‚Äì1856). Later in the 1860s, the future second Majoor purchased his financially troubled predecessor's particuliere landen or private domains of Kramat and Kapoek in the Ommelanden (rural hinterland) of Batavia. =Mayoralty= Baron Sloet van de Beele (1806‚Äì1890), Governor- General at the time of Tan's elevation to the post of Majoor in 1865. In 1865, after 15 years of service as an officer, Luitenant Tan Tjoen Tiat was raised to the rank his father-in-law had held, that of Kapitein. That same year, upon the resignation of the first Majoor, Kapitein Tan Tjoen Tiat was appointed by Ludolph Anne Jan Wilt, Baron Sloet van de Beele, the 19th Governor-General, to succeed as the second Majoor der Chinezen of Batavia. This mayoral elevation went against existing tradition, which favoured the longest-serving Kapiteins from long-established officer families, and thus showed the confidence in which the colonial government held the new Majoor. In 1870, a colonial government commission was formed, consisting of the civil servant Maximilian von Faber, the Majoor and Kapitein Ko Se Tjoan. Their task was to determine whether a woman, as a widow or a mother, may act as a guardian for minors under Chinese law. All three answered in the negative, with von Faber assigning the responsibility of custodianship to the Boedelkamer, or Estate Chamber; and the two Chinese officers, to a respected male relative of the minors. Tan served in office until 1879, when he asked for, and was granted by the colonial government, an honourable discharge from his position. Allowed nonetheless to retain his mayoralty on an honorary, titular basis, the former second Majoor died a year after his resignation in 1880, and was buried at his family mausoleum in Gaboes. His son, Luitenant- titulair der Chinezen Tan Keng Soei, was married to a niece of Kapitein Ko Se Tjoan and Kapitein Ko Tjoen Kiat. His daughter, Tan Im Nio, was married to Luitenant Souw Siauw Keng, son of Luitenant Souw Tian Pie.

He was a co-designer of the first two- stage Soviet thermonuclear device, the RDS-37, and became a chief of laboratory at Arzamas-16, now known as the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics. Early life and Career Feodoritov was born in Sasovo, Ryazan Oblast, 319 km south-east of Moscow. He graduated with honours from the Faculty of Physics and Technology of Moscow State University in 1952. Straight from graduation, he became a researcher in the theoretical sector known as KB-11 in Arzamas-16, which was based in the closed city of Sarov, working under Yakov Zel'dovich. Employees were only allowed leave on officially sanctioned or organised days off work, on trips such as for hunting or fishing. Feodoritov became lost on one such trip and - fearful for his future - was aided in his return by locals (who were well aware of the function of Sarov), later finding from his boss (Andrei Sakharov) that the KGB had been informed and had organised a search party. He worked in this secret institution until the end of his life, starting as a senior laboratory assistant and progressing through to engineer, researcher, head of the research group, senior research fellow and chief of laboratory. He took part in the testing of nuclear weapons and was the scientific lead in a number of tests. Along with his project lead, Yevgeny Zababakhin, and in addition to his work on the RDS-37, he worked on calculations for the core part of the RDS-6s bomb, the first Soviet thermonuclear weapon, and also worked on a design which became the first Soviet serial tactical nuclear weapon, RDS-4. Both devices were successfully completed in 1953. For this work he received the Stalin Prize, third degree and the Medal \\"For Labour Valour\\". He also worked on civilian nuclear projects. For further significant theoretical work and following successful weapons testing in 1954 and 1955, leading to a new generation of Soviet nuclear weaponry, he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. In 1956, he originated further design improvements which helped lead to a new direction in Soviet nuclear weapons. He was part of the team which developed the RDS-220 thermonuclear weapon, the largest ever tested. With German Goncharov, he worked on the construction scheme of these types of weapons, and with Sakharov he analysed the efficiency of the theoretical model of the RDS-220. He received his PhD in Physical and Mathematical Sciences in 1968. For his role in the projects to develop nuclear weapons he was awarded the State Prize of the USSR in 1973. Later in his career, Feodoritov was one of the compilers of the Atomic Project of the USSR, specifically Documents and materials. Volume II. Atomic bomb. 1945 - 1954 Book 1 (published in 1999). He was honoured for his contributions as a scientist in 2000. In his personal life, he was admired for his humanity and cordiality and was the chair of the parent committees throughout his children's education. He was regarded as a Father Frost figure, referred to as \\"Uncle Slava\\" by friends of his children and the children of colleagues.

Queensland Police reported that by November 2018, there had been 186 reports of contamination nationally. Contamination On 9 September 2018, several days prior to any official announcement of contamination, a Facebook user posted a warning about Berry Obsession strawberries purchased from Woolworths Strathpine Centre in Moreton Bay, north of Brisbane. The user reported that his friend had swallowed part of a needle and was in the emergency department at hospital. A second victim had called Woolworths on 11 September. The affected strawberries were not withdrawn and the contamination first publicly reported until 12 September. In the following days, dozens of contaminated punnets of strawberries grown in Queensland and Western Australia were discovered in NSW, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. Some cases are believed to be hoaxes. A South Australian man was arrested on 21 September after faking a contamination, and faced court in November 2018. Affected brands By 16 September 2018, the following brands had been identified by authorities as being involved in the contamination: Strawberries grown in Queensland: *Donnybrook Berries *Love Berry *Delightful Strawberries *Oasis brands *Berry Obsession *Berry Licious Strawberries grown in Western Australia: *Mal's Black Label *Australian Choice Police and state health authorities recommended consumers to either dispose of affected brands or return them to the place of purchase. They also recommended consumers to cut up other brands before eating. Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young stated that \\"If they do have any strawberries it would be safest to dispose of them.\\" Both Coles and Aldi removed all strawberries from their shelves, but planned to restock after 18 September. Woolworths had removed affected brands only. Woolworths later removed sewing needles from sale as a temporary measure. On 23 September, needles were found in \\"Australian Choice\\" brand strawberries sold in Auckland, New Zealand. Response =Investigation= The Queensland Strawberry Growers Association initially stated they had \\"reason to suspect\\" a \\"disgruntled\\" former packing employee was responsible for the contamination. Queensland Police Acting Chief Superintendent Terry Lawrence subsequently cast doubt upon that theory, stating \\"This was an earlier comment by the Strawberry Growers Association, it's something we don't subscribe to\\". Adrian Schultz, the vice-president of the Queensland Strawberry Growers Association described the contamination as an act of \\"commercial terrorism\\". Tony Holl, a strawberry grower from Western Australia told the ABC that he believed someone had a \\"vendetta\\" against the strawberry industry, suggesting otherwise the contamination could be a \\"terrorist act\\". The ABC reported on Thursday that \\"Police believe they have contained the threat and assured consumers would be able to safely buy strawberries again from Thursday, when stock is replaced.\\" As of 19 September, Queensland Police had more than 100 officers, including 60 detectives, working on the investigation into the contamination. However, by 15 October Queensland Police scaled this back to one full time detective amid a lack of clear leads. =Government response= On 15 September 2018, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone responsible for the sabotage. On 18 September, Palaszczuk announced a $1 million assistance package for the strawberry industry in the state, telling State Parliament that \\"This past week, Queensland has been the victim of an ugly, calculated and despicable crime.\\" Also on 18 September, Premier of Western Australia Mark McGowan announced a $100,000 reward for information leading to a prosecution. The two largest food retailers in New Zealand, Woolworths NZ and Foodstuffs announced they would be removing Australian-grown strawberries from their shelves. On 18 September 2018, Senator Bridget McKenzie, the Minister for Regional Services, issued a media statement, describing the contamination as \\"deliberate sabotage\\" and urging consumers to \\"exercise caution and cut up their fruit before consumption.\\" Criticism of response As of 17 September 2018, a consumer-level food recall of any affected brands had yet to be issued. Instead, only a \\"trade recall\\" had been issued. Food Standards Australia New Zealand describes a trade recall as a recall \\"conducted when the food has not been sold directly to consumers. It involves recovery of the product from distribution centres and wholesalers\\". Professor Melissa Fitzgerald, a food safety expert at the University of Queensland, told the ABC she was \\"surprised\\" there had not been a consumer-level recall given the products had been sold to individual customers. The recall was not mentioned on supermarket or government food safety websites‚Äîsomething Professor Fitzgerald would have expected. Professor Fitzgerald said \\"I would expect people to go to the websites for information...People may be quite surprised not to find any information on the websites where they normally would.\\" Professor Fitzgerald criticised the delay between the first incident on 9 September and the public warning on 12 September. Queensland Strawberry Industry Development Officer Jennifer Rowling accused \\"some authoritative spokespeople\\" of mishandling the response to the incident. She also criticised a \\"sometimes hysterical media\\" and accused them of costing agricultural businesses millions of dollars. Rowling insisted only three brands had been affected and said \\"All other reported cases have either been copycats or unsubstantiated claims.\\" = Grower measures and responses = On 15 September, Suncoast Harvest farm of the Sunshine Coast announced on Facebook that they were ceasing growing strawberries for the remainder of the year, resulting in job losses for 100 workers. Some growers started ordering and installing metal detectors to protect their strawberries from contamination. Some farms had to dispose of strawberries in response to the crisis. Donnybrook Berries of Queensland, one of the brands affected, dumped truckloads of berries, sharing the resulting video footage which went viral with over a million views in a day. One Queensland farm burned off 500,000 strawberry plants deemed unsellable, as it was cheaper than harvesting. = Arrest = On 11 November 2018, My Ut Trinh, a 50-year-old farm supervisor, from Caboolture, was arrested in Brisbane and charged with seven counts of contaminating goods, relating to one of the initial cases of contamination involving the Berry Licious brand. Ms Trinh worked at the Berrylicious/Berry Obsession fruit farm north of Brisbane as a picking supervisor. Related incidents On 17 September 2018, a 62-year-old woman suffering from a mental illness was cautioned after she allegedly contaminated a banana with a metal object at a supermarket in Maryborough, Queensland. Queensland Police stated the incident was not linked to the contamination crisis. On 18 September, New South Wales Police announced needles had been discovered in bananas and apples in two separate incidents in the Sydney area. Detective superintendent Daniel Doherty reminded the public of the importance to report incidents of contamination and \\"to be vigilant and exercise caution when buying strawberries and other fruit in NSW.\\" Doherty confirmed police were investigating \\"more than 20 incidents in New South Wales, but nationally, the number is much higher.\\" The apple was part of a pack of six, purchased from a Woolworths at The Ponds. On 20 September, New South Wales Police reported that a young boy had been arrested after admitting to hiding sewing needles in strawberries as part of what police consider to be \\"a prank\\". The current penalty in New South Wales for the deliberate contamination of food is up to 10 years in jail; however, Australia's Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, has stated that \\"the government plans to increase the maximum jail term to 15 years. Also on 20 September, a customer in West Gosford on the New South Wales Central Coast discovered a needle inside a mango. In the wake of the needle crisis, Foodstuffs NZ made the decision to halt the distribution of Australian strawberries in all their New Zealand stores including New World, Pak'nSave, and Four Square. Countdown said that strawberries grown in New Zealand had not been affected, but it was in contact with New Zealand and Australian authorities.

Miasto z Morza i Marze≈Ñ, Alter Ego, Gdynia 1997, p. 157-203.  Family history  The Tutkowski's were originally most likely of Lithuanian descent. This theory is supported by parochial documents from Ko≈õcierzyna County, which indicate that the last name's original form was Tutkus. The original last name is still common in the Anyk≈°ƒçiai area in Lithuania. One of Tutkowski family's first major income properties, Starowiejska 11 The pivotal point in the family's history was the rapid transformation of the village of Gdynia into one of Poland's major cities in the interwar period thanks to the construction of a nearby port. The local branch of the Tutkowski family owned vast fields at the site of the current downtown area of the city, the port, and the villa district of Kamienna G√≥ra. Because the family was one of the main families involved in the construction of the port of city of Gdynia, they are commonly referred to as one of the Four Big Families of Gdynia, along with the clans of Skwiercz, Grubba, and Dorsz.Boles≈Çaw Kie≈Çbratowski, Nowe plans dla Kamiennej G√≥ry, Dziennik Gdy≈Ñski, p. 14, April 2, 1933. Along with their substantial growth in wealth, the Gdynia branch of the Tutkowski family, once local Pomeranian nobility (which historically wasn't strictly tied to any nation-state), became part of the Polish elite, marrying into established families of Wittstock, the owners of the village of Wittstock in the Free City of Danzig (nowadays the Wysoka district in Gda≈Ñsk); Brygman, owners of several estates in the ≈ªu≈Çawy region (the Vistula delta); and Przes≈Çawski, one of the greatest families of Greater Poland.Edward Oberty≈Ñski, Saga rod√≥w gdy≈Ñskich, , 2004. After WWII, the Tutkowski family lost most of its estates in the Gdynia area due to expropriations executed by the communist government against landowners. The government motivated the expropriations with the provisions of eminent domain laws; their illegality stemmed from the lack of reasonable compensation offered. The Tutkowski's and other families in the city were only able to keep some of their built-up parcels. After the communist era, another blow was dealt to the Tutkowski family when their grand villa in the Kamienna G√≥ra district was torn down before being returned to the family. It was only in the 2010s that the family started recovering its land and getting compensation for illegal expropriations of the 1960s.Szymon Szadurski, Gdynia - miasto prawie prywatne, https://gazetakrakowska.pl/gdynia-miasto-prawie- prywatne/ar/302810/4, accessed 2018-09-15.  Coat of arms  According to 19th century heraldist Teodor ChrzƒÖ≈Ñski, the coat of arms of the House of Tutkowski is a variation on the ≈Åuk coat of arms, which was fairly common in Poland. The theory is supported not only by the presence of the namesake bow on the shield, but also the crest's three ostrich feathers. In the seemingly chaotic Kashubian heraldry, coats of arms often functioned more as a connector to one's region, rather than to particular lineage, which explains the abundance of common heraldic elements such stars, moons, and arrows, connecting their bearing families with Kashubia. As a consequence of contacts with Polish nobility, it was quite common in Kashubia to either include Polish elements in one's coat of arms or completely replace it with a Polish one, such as the popularized Na≈Çƒôcz and Brochwicz. The House of Tutkowski coat of arms is fairly typical for Kashubia, with its classic Kashubian star and a bow as per ChrzƒÖ≈Ñski most likely derived from Polish heraldry.Teodor ChrzƒÖ≈Ñski, Tablice odmian herbowych ChrzƒÖ≈Ñskiego, A.

During 1909 and 1910 there were movements by Young Turks supporters to adopt an Arabic alphabet, as they considered the Latin script to be un-Islamic. In Elbasan, Muslim clerics led a demonstration for the Arabic script, telling their congregations that using the Latin script would make them infidels. In 1911, the Young Turks dropped their opposition to the Latin script, and the Latin alphabet was invented. In order to eliminate ambiguity in the pronunciation of the Arabic script, Rexhep Voka developed a customized Arabic alphabet consisting of 44 consonants and vowels, which he published in 1911.

He is best known for being the founder and first pastor of St. Patrick's Church, the first Catholic church in Washington, D.C.  Biography  He was born near Newport, County Mayo, Ireland, and entered the Dominican Order in Esker in County Galway in 1777. Following his ordination, Father Caffry received a Doctor of Divinity degree from the Sorbonne in Paris. In 1794, he traveled to the United States and was charged by Bishop John Carroll with erecting the first Catholic parish in the City of Washington. Caffry's decision to undertake this project was likely influenced by Irish architect James Hoban, who asked Caffry to consider the Irish who worked to build the new federal capital. He first began holding services in rented spaces in the beginning of the year, but later built a modest, one-and-a-half story wood-frame church with the meager funds the parish had. The land on which it was built was purchased by Caffry on April 17, 1794 as two lots (numbers 5 and 6) on block 376 of the original plan of the District of Columbia between 9th and 10th Streets and F and G Streets. For these two lots, he paid 80 pounds to its seller, the United State government. During its establishment, he insisted that Leonard Neale, the coadjutor bishop of Baltimore, order the entire City of Washington be included within the territory of the parish. For ten years, Caffry resided as pastor of St. Patrick's in Washington. He resigned in 1804 when the parish required construction of a larger church, and was succeeded by William Matthews. He was then reassigned to New York, staying only three years before returning to Ireland. In 1811, he died suddenly in Dublin.

Description and history The William Hurd House is located in a rural-residential setting in Southbury's Southford area, on the south side of Hulls Hill Road just north of its crossing of Jeremy Brook. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, end chimneys, and clapboarded exterior, with ells extending to the right and rear. The main facade is five bays wide, with windows arranged in a somewhat asymmetrical manner around a nearly centered entrance. The entry has a fine Federal surround, with sidelights that have pilasters on both sides, and a corniced entablature. The interior of the main block is largely a reconstruction performed after a 1950 fire, but cased timbers attest to its age and construction history. With The oldest portion of the house was probably built in the late 18th century by William Hurd, a sixth-generation descendant of an early settler of the area. It was enlarged about 1820, at which time it was given its Federal period features. It was sold out of the Hurd family in 1834. In the 1920s it was turned into a country house and underwent some restoration, which turned it a more complete reconstruction of the interior after the 1950 fire. The house is believed to be one of the oldest in Southbury, predating the town's incorporation.

He served on the faculty in History departments at several universities, becoming department head at three. He was a founding member of the Society for French Historical Studies. In later years he developed a keen interest in botany, and wrote extensively on that subject, especially its early history in France. Williams did not marry and left his estate to the Wyoming Community Foundation. Education Williams graduated from Greeley High School in Greeley, Colorado, then attended Colorado College. After an interruption to serve in the U.S. Army (1943-1946) he obtained his AB degree in 1947. He earned his MA in 1948 and PhD in European history in 1951 at the University of Michigan. Academic positions Beginning his career he served as assistant professor or visiting professor at three institutions: Minnesota State University, Mankato (1950-1952), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1952-1955), Michigan State University (1955-1956). He then became associate professor and later History department head at Antioch College(1956-1965), and professor and subsequently head of the History Department at University of California, Santa Barbara (1965-1971). In 1971, when offered the position of Chancellor at UC Santa Barbara, he declined, preferring to return to Wyoming, and accepted the position of Professor and Department Head at the University of Wyoming. He \\"built the department into the region‚Äôs leading history department.\\" In 1978 he was honored with the title Distinguished Professor (UW's first such). He retired in 1988, and became a Research Associate of the Rocky Mountain Herbarium. Upon Williams' death, a colleague wrote of him: \\"Undergraduates were attracted by his high standards, carefully crafted lectures, and subtle humor. His graduate students, who now live and work throughout the United States and Canada, fondly recall his gifts as advisor and mentor.\\" Professional activities History Napoleon III Williams was encouraged by historian friend Jacques Barzun to explore French cultural history, which led Williams to produce a series of books on Napoleon III and the Second French Empire, and the times leading up to and following that epoch. The first book, Gaslight and Shadow, adopted a style followed by many of his later works: he \\"abandons the more orthodox chronological approach in favor of a mosaic ... of ten vignettes chosen to portray the many facets of the Second Empire\\". Each chapter focuses on a person who thrived in or influenced the era - including Jacques Offenbach and Louis Pasteur. In the Preface he notes the human proclivity which often leads to times of turmoil in history: \\"Great wealth can patronize creativity, or it can stimulate a greed for more wealth and power.\\" Later books covered this period in great detail. In a vein similar to Gaslight and Shadow, Manners and Murders in the World of Louis-Napoleon consists of a series of chapters, each \\"concerned with a single crime and its trial\\". The Jacques Barzun Prize in Cultural History, one of two prizes awarded by the American Philosophical Society, was established and funded by Williams in 1993. Botany A few years before retiring as Distinguished Professor and Department Head of the University of Wyoming, Williams began his first scholarly work in botany. In 1979 he began his biography of the botanical taxonomist Aven Nelson with help from his family; the book was published in 1984. Bernard de Jussieu A short while later he produced a treatise on botanist George Everett Osterhout in the botanical journal Brittonia. In 1988, using his extensive knowledge of French history, he began to delve into the beginnings of modern botany. His 2001 book \\"Botanophilia in Eighteenth Century France\\", consists of chapters on Carl Linnaeus, members of the De Jussieu family, Augustin Pyramus de Candolle, the contributions of the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and other persons and events. The book covers a significant era in the History of botany, specifically in the area of plant taxonomy. It depicts the transformation of botany from an adjunct to medicine, into a mature science on its own merits. He also contributed to the knowledge of the flora of the Rocky Mountains, publishing revisions of a classic identification aid. His 2003 book, A Region of Astonishing Beauty, deals with many botanical explorers of the Rocky Mountains, including the first to explore the high country Edwin James, whose words were used by Williams for the title. \\"Williams covers every serious collector who spent even part of their collecting time in the Rocky Mountains.\\"  Works  French political history     Botany     References 1923 births 2017 deaths 20th-century American historians University of Michigan alumni Antioch College faculty University of California, Santa Barbara faculty American botanical writers ","title":"Roger Lawrence Williams"},{"id":"58501708","text":"Gerta von Ubisch (1882‚Äì1965) was a German physicist, geneticist, and botanist.

He then returned to the LSE as a lecturer, and secured promotion to a readership in sociology in 1970. In 1975, he was appointed as Keith Kelsall's successor to the Chair in Sociological Studies at the University of Sheffield. He retired in 1986 amid funding cuts and declining student numbers which had led to the sociology honours degree course falling into abeyance at Sheffield. His early retirement ‚Äì and that of Eric Sainsbury (Chair in Social Administration) ‚Äì was carried out to ensure that junior staff did not lose their jobs. In the meantime, he had also been Deputy Dean and Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences at Sheffield between 1982 and 1986. In retirement, he remained associated with the university as an emeritus professor; he also held visiting posts and served as president of the British Sociological Association from 1991 to 1993. He was also an Academician of the Academy of Social Sciences.Alan Walker, \\"John Westergaard obituary\\", The Guardian, 23 May 2014.

Westergaard's research focused on social class and inequality in capitalist societies; his Marxist interpretation was unorthodox in its focus on income distribution rather than productive relations. With Henrietta Resler, he co-wrote Class in a Capitalist Society in 1975, arguing that class inequalities had persisted in post-war Britain; his book Who Gets What?: The Hardening of Class Inequality in the Late Twentieth Century (1995) articulated his belief that inequalities had persisted in the meantime. Alan Walker wrote that \\"He championed the study of class inequality as a defining feature of capitalism, long before its importance became more widely acknowledged, and played key roles in the development of the sociology profession.\\" Westergaard was married twice and had four children (one of whom died in infancy) and a step-son.

This ferry was in use until the bridge was built.Bac √† traille du Robinet ou bac √† traille de Donz√®re at patrimoine.rhonealpes.fr In 1833 there was a plan to replace the ferry with a suspension bridge. In 1845 Hubert Fourn√©ry was given authorisation to build the bridge and receive tolls from it for 99 years. The construction began in the same year and finished in 1847. The bridge was badly damaged by a storm in 1854 and floods in 1856. The ferry was used again until the bridge was repaired in 1859. In the following decades the bridge was once again damaged by storms and improvements were made to stiffen the bridge. In 1902 the road was renewed and additional trusses and beams added. In the Second World War the bridge was destroyed by the Resistance to impede the German retreat. The rebuild was completed in 1950 and at the same time discussions began about a connection to the newly built Canal de Donz√®re- Mondragon. In 1974, it was decided on safety grounds to dismantle the bridge. But the citizens of Donz√®re secured its reopening in 1979. The Pont du Robinet has been a protected monument since 1985.

Nine vessels of the class are on order, and upon delivery will be operated by Stena Line, Brittany Ferries, and DFDS Seaways. Stena Line are to take five vessels of the class, Brittany Ferries three (two of which will be powered by LNG), and a single vessel will go to DFDS. All of the vessels will be delivered to Stena RoRo with the Stena Line vessels transferred to that company and the Brittany Ferries and DFDS examples long- term chartered to those operators. History Following about two years of design work, Stena ordered the first four vessels of the class from Chinese shipbuilder AVIC Weihai in April 2016, with options for four more ships. Stena originally planned to utilize the four ferries on Irish Sea services out of Belfast, but later agreed to charter the third ship in the series to Brittany Ferries. In February 2018, the keel was laid for the first ship, with her delivery scheduled for early 2020. Stena RoRo ordered a fifth ship in April 2018, which will enter service with DFDS Seaways on a ten-year charter upon delivery. The following month, Stena RoRo ordered a sixth ship, to be placed with Brittany Ferries on a ten-year charter beginning in late 2021. Construction on the second ship in the class began in June 2018. In July, Stena Line ordered two more ships, accounting for all the options in the original 2016 order, while Stena RoRo announced that it had agreed to take new options for four more vessels. =Service= The first ship in the class, named Stena Estrid, was launched in January 2019 and was delivered in China on 15 November. On arrival in Holyhead, faulty seals on over 20 windows were discovered. Repairs were carried out prior to her maiden voyage, which took place on 13 January 2020. She is regularly operated on Stena's route between Holyhead and Dublin. Stena Edda, the second E-flexer earmarked for Stena Line's fleet, was delivered to Stena RoRo on 15 January 2020. Following bunkering in Singapore and Gibraltar, and an outside port limits call at Galle, the crew travelling from Weihai were also checked by local authorities for coronavirus infection, with no evidence of the disease being present. She entered service on Stena's route between Belfast and Liverpool, where Stena Embla, the fourth ship of the series, is planned to operate upon her delivery in early 2021. Galicia was delivered on 3 September 2020, with her entry into service expected sometime in late 2020 or early 2021. She will operate out of Portsmouth, England, to Santander, Spain and Cherbourg, France. Brittany Ferries plans to take delivery of Salamanca in 2022, followed by Santo√±a in 2023. The fourth ship in the series, to be operated by DFDS, will be named Cote d' Opale. She will differ significantly from the other E-Flexer vessels as she will have additional public spaces in areas where passenger cabins are located on the Stena Line and Brittany Ferries ships. She will operate across the Strait of Dover upon delivery. Design E-Flexer-class ships were designed by Stena and Deltamarin. The first six ships of the type measure approximately and are in length, with a beam of and a draft of . Their freight deck has a capacity of 3,100 lane meters, with additional space for about 120 cars, apart from on the Brittany Ferries examples where additional passenger cabins are provided in the area occupied by the dedicated car deck on the other examples. The seventh and eighth ships will be long, with 3,600 lane meters of freight capacity. Passenger capacity is about 1,000 people, though the interior layout is built to the requirements of the operator. The first five ships to be built are each powered by two MaK M43C diesel engines, with a total power output of , driving two propellers that give the ships a service speed of . Those engines are designed to be compatible with liquefied natural gas (LNG) fuel after modifications. Brittany Ferries' second (Galicia) and third (Santo√±a) examples will be able to run on LNG from delivery, though both will have reduced freight capacity as a result of the space occupied by their LNG tanks. All of the E-Flexer vessels ordered to date will be ice-classed, either to 1A or 1C requirements.

Perpetrators of violence may use coercion tactics to keep the partner in the home. These tactics could include threatening harm to a family pet or threatening to take custody of children if the partner attempts to leave. IPV is a serious public health concern in the United States and one that has the potential to affect an individual‚Äôs medical readiness. Within the military community, intimate relationships may be particularly vulnerable to occupation-stress that is specific to military operations. These demands might include frequent moves to undesirable locations or overseas, separation from extended family for unknown lengths of time, frequent variability in work schedule, long hours, career uncertainty, mission ambiguity, training environments meant to simulate varying operational environments, and risk that is inherent to the field . Although there are programs in place designed to support the family unit (i.e., Family Readiness Group (FRG), Family Advocacy Program (FAP)), the stress of multiple deployments, combat exposure, and exposure to traumatic events (i.e., combat, IED, mortar rounds, witnessing death or atrocities) cause additional strain on the family unit as service members reintegrate into the home environment following the return home from a deployment. Deployments bring additional stress on the family unit as two-parent homes transition to one-parent homes while attempting to maintain their semi-regular schedules. Theories of IPV There are several theories that attempt to explain the use of force within an intimate relationship. Cultural spill-over effect posits that the more a culture supports the use of violence to achieve their objectives, the more likely individuals in that culture will legitimize violence and generalize those beliefs across multiple domains, which include those where the use of violence or aggression is not socially appropriate. Occupational stress spill- over theory posits that male-dominated, hypermasculine occupations may inadvertently emphasize control though the use of physical force, which generalizes across domains where the use of force is socially unacceptable. = Types and severity = The Department of Defense (DoD) Defense Task Force on Domestic Violence categorizes violence severity into three categories: severe, moderate, and mild. The behaviors categorized under each level of severity are relatively similar between branches of service. Severe physical abuse is defined as choking or strangulation, any injury during sustained while pregnant, threat of harm with a knife or firearm, emotional abuse and intimidation (i.e., ‚Äúbattered spouse syndrome‚Äù), sexual abuse, and major physical injuries that require long-term medical treatment such as inpatient care. Moderate abuse includes objects thrown at spouse, physical abuse (i.e., pushing, biting, kicking, hitting shoving, or punching) and injuries that require short-term medical treatment (i.e., one visit to the hospital). Mild abuse involves verbal threats and physical injuries that don‚Äôt require medical treatment. Prevalence The prevalence rates of IPV across military populations ranges from 13.5‚Äì58% with lower rates observed in military samples not selected based on psychopathology. In 2001, over 18,000 incidents of abuse were reported to the DoD Family Advocacy Programs. Of those incidents reported, 84% involved physical abuse, 66% of victims were spouses of military community and less than 25-years-old. From 1995‚Äì2001, there were 217 domestic homicides in military communities. Physical abuse is more likely to be reported than psychological abuse (i.e., emotional and verbal abuse.) Children exposed to IPV may exhibit more behavioral problems, lower performance in school, and aggressive behavior across multiple settings than those not exposed to violence in the home. IPV perpetration among veteran populations with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is up to three times higher than those without PTSD. Analysis of violence Violence can be further characterized by directionality. Bi-directional violence is defined as violence that is committed by both individuals in the relationship, which include violence committed in anger or retaliation. Unilateral violence is defined as violence perpetrated by one individual in the relationship and has been connected to dissociative violence, parasomnia, and hypnopompic violence (i.e., violence due to hyperarousal during sleep) in the literature. Risk factors Research suggests that individuals experiencing psychopathology are at a greater risk of perpetration or victimization of IPV compared to veterans without a formal clinical diagnosis. Individuals who experience symptoms associated with PTSD are at a greater risk of perpetrating IPV and being victimized than civilians and veterans without PTSD symptoms. Intrusive negative thoughts, flashbacks, feelings of generalized distress, lack of connection with family or community, and hyperarousal are symptoms that have been shown to influence the relationship between combat exposure and IPV perpetration. This relationship varies with type and level of combat exposure (i.e., witnessing atrocities). History of traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been associated with higher rates of IPV perpetration. Additional risk factors include heavy alcohol and drug use, which has been shown to increase the risk of violence among couples who score high in verbal aggressive conflict communication style. Childhood trauma was found to be correlated with increased risk of violence with Air Force and Navy FAPs reporting 11‚Äì25% of service members experiencing physical or emotional abuse by a parent and 49% of treatment-mandated active duty service member samples reporting childhood abuse. Research suggests a positive correlation between length of deployment and severity of self-reported IPV following a deployment. Being junior in rank and marrying at a young age (i.e., below 25-years of age) were also identified. IPV protocol and programs DoD Directive 6400.1, which required each branch of service to establish FAP, also required each military installation to have at least one victim advocate. The role of the victim advocate is to help individuals obtain a military protective order, collaborate with unit commanders, help prepare safety plans, connect victims to civilian resources, and provide 24-hour service availability to victims. FAP advocates, chaplains, and medical professionals must maintain the victims‚Äô confidentiality when cases of IPV are reported by the victim, except in specific cases when confidentiality must be broken to ensure the safety of children, older adults, and vulnerable adults. Reports made to other staff (i.e., direct leadership or FRG members) are not confidential and may be reported to military law enforcement or commanders. = Available programs = There are multiple programs designed to support military families. FAP was developed to support the specific needs of military families and currently provides several programs designed to reduce IPV. These programs include new parent support, individual counseling, couples counseling, workshops, and seminars. Strength at Home-Men‚Äôs Program (SAH-M), a 12-week cognitive- behavioral and trauma-informed group intervention designed to reduce IPV, has been shown to help individuals limit psychical and psychological IPV, and improve emotional processing, which has been associated with violence.

Background  Bhad Bhabie was first discovered on the Dr. Phil show, where she said the phrase \\"cash me outside, how 'bout dah?\\" This later became a meme which went viral, turning her into an Internet star. She gained a following on Instagram and YouTube, and on August 23, 2017, TMZ leaked what would be her first song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, \\"These Heaux\\". She became the second youngest female artist in music history to enter the Hot 100 with her debut single, debuting and peaking at 77, and a few days later, she was signed to Atlantic Records. She later released \\"Hi Bich\\", which also charted on the Hot 100 at number 68, the highest new entry for that week. It was later certified Gold by the RIAA. She released more singles over the course of eight months. On March 26, 2018, Bhabie released \\"Gucci Flip Flops\\", which reached a peak of 79 on the Hot 100, making her the youngest female to have three songs enter the Hot 100 since LeAnn Rimes. The single went on to be certified Platinum in the US, making it her first single to achieve Platinum status. On April 14, 2018, she began her international tour Bhanned in the USA with opener Asian Doll, where she previewed many songs like \\"Affiliated\\". After she was nominated at the 2018 Billboard Music Awards for Top Rap Female Artist, she announced she would be releasing a single called \\"Trust Me\\" featuring Ty Dolla Sign, as well as a mixtape. She released the single a few weeks later, and while it failed to chart on the Hot 100, it peaked at number nine on the Bubbling Under R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles chart. On August 14, 2018, she announced the release date for the mixtape, and released the intro track for the mixtape, \\"15 Freestyle\\". A promotional single featuring City Girls, ‚ÄúYung and Bhad‚Äù was released on August 30. The following month, she released the artwork for the mixtape, and a few days later she revealed the track list, announcing guest appearances from many rappers such as YG and Lil Baby. One day later she previewed the track \\"Thot Opps (Clout Drop)\\" on her social media, and the next day she released \\"Thot Opps (Clout Drop)\\" and a new track, \\"Bout That\\". She released the music video for her collaboration with Lil Baby, \\"Geek'd Up\\", the mixtape's fourth single, on September 20.  Critical reception  15 received mixed reviews. Writing for Pitchfork and rating the album a 5.5 out of 10, Michelle Kim stated that \\"Danielle Bregoli's leap from meme to rapper continues with her debut mixtape that leans heavily on mimicry and trails dreadfully behind the current sound of hip-hop. On 15, her first mixtape as Bhad Bhabie, Bregoli doesn't show much versatility past her well-established tough-girl character. She's successful in imitating the sound of today's rap hits; most of the songs on 15 come across like they're specifically engineered to be placed onto Spotify's 'RapCaviar' playlist.\\" AllMusic's Neil Yeung rated the mixtape a 3 out of 5, stating that \\"For what it's worth, buried beneath the posturing and obnoxiousness lies a glimmer of promise. However, Bhad Bhabie requires some polishing and maturity if she's ever going to grow beyond a mere novelty.\\" For The New York Times, John Caramanica gave the album a mixed review and states that \\"On the entertaining if erratic '15,' Bhad Bhabie raps like someone who is learning to rap in real time, which to be fair, she is. Her default mode is taunt, and she's effective at it [...] At its best, '15' is appealing both as straight-ahead hip-hop and also novelty ‚Äî a rap album made by a rap fan given all the resources of an actual rapper.\\"  Track listing  Credits adapted from BMI and Tidal.

She was the first woman licensed by the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) to race competitively. She was also the first woman to win a national title, in the 1962 U.S. Nationals at Indianapolis, in the J/S class. In 2002, shortly before her death, she received a lifetime achievement award at the World Finals at Pomona.  Racing career  Leighton started drag racing in 1952. Along with other family members, she was a member of the Dust Devils Car Club, which ran Inyokern Dragstrip in the high desert of Southern California. Leighton became interested in cars at age 10 around her father who was a mechanic. Leighton, like fellow racers Carol Cox and Shirley Shahan, campaigned to allow women to compete equally with men. Leighton, in 1963, was the first woman licensed to compete in NHRA's Gas class. She was good friends with fellow racer Shahan, and shared a sense of camaraderie with the other women racers, including Cox, Shirley Muldowney, Barbara Hamilton, and Paula Murphy. Leighton's husband, Robert (commonly called Gus) served with a number of sanctioning bodies, including the Southern California Timing Association(SCTA). Her sister, Phillys (\\"P.J.\\"), married well-known racer Bernie Partridge, a friend of NHRA founder Wally Parks and himself a later NHRA Vice President. Leighton was uniquely well placed to get changes made. In 1962, Leighton won her class (J/Stock) at the U.S. Nationals at Indianapolis, in a 1960 Chevrolet El Camino. She later turned the Camino into an injected alky-burner. Her son, David, still owns the 1960 J/S-winning Camino, which he hopes to put back on the strip some day. Leighton suffered third-degree burns in a 1963 house fire, keeping her out of racing until 1965.

The Hollywood Reporter, September 8, 2018. An examination of sexism in the Hollywood film industry, the film interviews a variety of actresses and women filmmakers on their experiences in the industry.\\"TIFF review: This Changes Everything\\". Now, September 9, 2018. Release The film premiered at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival. The film received multiple standing ovations and was only the second documentary to be shown in Toronto's iconic 2600-seat Roy Thomson Hall. The film was created in association with Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, Artemis Rising Foundation, David Yurman and Lyft Entertainment. The film explores the issues surrounding gender inequality in Hollywood and has since screened in over 20 film festivals in North America and Europe. On January 17, 2019, Deadline Hollywood announced that the film's theatrical, streaming, and broadcast rights for North America had been acquired by Good Deed Entertainment, and that the film would be released theatrically in the first half of 2019.\\"‚ÄòThis Changes Everything‚Äô Docu About Hollywood Discrimination Acquired By Good Deed\\".

The film had its cable premiere on Starz on December 16, 2019. Reception In her review for the New York Times, Aisha Harris called the film ‚Äúpassionate... a crucial Cri de Coeur‚Äù and Ashley Lee from the Washington Post called it ‚Äúsearing‚Äù. Pete Hammond from Deadline called the film ‚Äúpowerful and fascinating‚Äù. He writes, ‚ÄúSome might believe that this movie especially, considering the subject matter, should be helmed by a woman. Donahue, however, is the one who got it made and feels correctly that it is as much if not more important to open the eyes of men in this regard.‚Äù In his Variety review, Peter Debruge writes, \\"There‚Äôs something to be said for solidarity shown by those who have nothing to gain from their support beyond the advancement of the greater good. So, like white people at a Black Lives Matter rally or straight folks at a Gay Pride parade, Donahue deserves credit for proactively going out of his way to make a movie that tells it like it is ‚Äî and paints it as it could be.\\" Accolades This Changes Everything was named first runner- up for the Toronto International Film Festival People's Choice Award: Documentaries.\\"'Green Book' boosts awards season prospects with TIFF audience award win\\".

The programme of the group was largely similar to that of the Menshevik-Internationalists, and politically it placed itself between the Menshevik-Internationalists and the Bolsheviks. They were critical of Bolshevik tactics but would remain supportive of the Soviet government. They were a relatively small organization of leftist intellectuals, largely identified with its newspaper Novaya Zhizn ('New Life'). Whilst the group was quite small, Novaya Zhizn had a significant readership. It was published by the well-known author Maxim Gorky, although Gorky broke with the party in July 1917. Gorky had been the only prominent figure in the organization. In December 1917 Solomon Lozovsky was expelled from the Bolshevik Party, after which he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (of Internationalists) and became its main leader.Lenin, V. I.. Concerning the Expulsion from the Party of S. A. Lozovsky In March 1918 he became the party chairman. He also edited the new party organ Proletarii ('Proletarian'). In May 1918 the party underwent a split, with a minority group (who favoured closer relations with the Bolsheviks) broke away and formed their own group. At the Second All RussianTrade Union Congress in January 1919, the party delegation supported the call for unions independent from the Communist Party. In April 1919, the minority that had split in 1918 reunited with the party. The party adopted the name Russian Social Democratic Labour Party and took a more conciliatory approach towards the Bolsheviks. The 4th congress of the party decided to dissolve the party and called on its membership to join the Communist Party. In December 1919 Lozovsky was readmitted to the Communist Party. Soviet historiography labelled the party as \\"the far left of the petty bourgeoisie\\", arguing that the party had a contradictory position in calling for a socialist government whilst rejecting the notion of an armed uprising.

Her most notable work was with the St John Ambulance Brigade and being a co-founder of the Children's Sunshine Home at Stillorgan, County Dublin with Ella Webb. Early life and family Letitia Overend was born at 11 Herbert Road, Dublin on 15 July 1880. She was the elder daughter of a solicitor, Trevor Overend and Bessie Anna \\"Lily\\" Overend (n√©e Butler). She had two younger sisters, Constance born in 1894 who died in infancy, and Naomi born in 1900. In 1894, the family moved to Airfield House, where the Overend sisters were educated by a governess at home. Career Overend joined St John's Ambulance Brigade in 1913, training in first aid. In the Easter Rising of 1916, she was one of the first aiders who worked under the direction of John Lumsden, attended to the wounded of both sides of the conflict. She went on to attain the rank of chief superintendent, serving the Brigade for the rest of her life, eventually being awarded dame of justice of the Order of St John of Jerusalem in 1955. She was a member of the Irish Red Cross Society committee of the emergency hospitals‚Äô supplies depot on Merrion Square during World War II. This work involved the purchasing of shirting, wool, pyjama and bandage material for the making of these supplies. The clothing was for refugees that came to Ireland, and the medical supplies were sent to Finland and Turkey primarily. Overend was offered an OBE for this work, but refused as \\"it would be impossible that everyone who did good work during the War can be recognised.\\" In 1923 Overend and Ella Webb purchased the first premises of the Children's Sunshine Home, largely using a ¬£5,000 donation from Overend's uncle, Tommy Overend. The home was a rehabilitation centre for children suffering with rickets. In 1961 Trinity College Dublin awarded her an honorary doctorate for her public service work. Motoring Trevor Overend purchased one of the first cars the Dundrum area, and it was from him that Overend and her sister developed an interest in motoring. She bought a blue Rolls Royce 20 Tourer in 1927, having attended a four-week course on maintenance at the Derby Rolls Royce factory. During this course she learnt to strip and clean the engine, and how to maintain and repair the car herself. This earned her the nicknames \\"Miss Rolls Royce\\" or \\"Tot\\", and the Garda√≠ apparently turned a blind eye to her illegal parking around Dublin. Both sisters were frequent visitors to the Automobile Club in Dawson Street. Both Overend sisters were members of the Irish Veteran and Vintage Car Club (IVVCC) and the Leinster Motor Club, travelling around Ireland to motor rallies. They were both awarded honorary life memberships of the IVVCC in 1973, recognising their contribution to vintage car motoring. The mechanic who took over the maintenance of Overend's car in later years, Vincent Hallinan, called her the sergeant-major. With her sister, Overend travelled extensively, in Europe and internationally to India, Australia, and America. Later life and legacy The sisters established Airfield Trust as an educational facility in 1974. An archive of the Airfield Estate, including Overend papers, from 1805 to 2001 is now housed at the OPW-Maynooth University Archive and Research Centre at Castletown House. Overend died on 3 October 1977. In 2006 D√∫n Laoghaire Rathdown Co. Council renamed Wyckham Way as Overend Way in recognition of the contribution of both the Overend sisters.

In 1916, he became a member of the Literary Commission of Shkod√´r, which established the first standard form of the Albanian language.  Early life  Pekmezi was born in Tushemisht, Pogradec (modern day Albania). He began his initial studies in Ohrid and Monastir, moving on to Belgrade from 1890‚Äì1894. He later graduated from the University of Vienna in philosophy and philology in 1898. After his graduation, Pekmezi returned to Albania.  Career  In 1903, Pekmezi was elected to direct the Albanian language cathedra at the Oriental University of Vienna. He founded the cultural-patriotic society Dija (Knowledge) in 1904 with Hile Mosi, Kol√´ Rrota and other Albanian intellectuals. In the late Ottoman period, Austria-Hungary subsidized two of Pekmezi's works: Albanesische Bibliographie and Albanianische Grammatik. During the autumn of 1913, Pekmezi worked for the border commission in southern Albania and in March 1914 was appointed dragoman (interpreter/secretary) at the new Austro‚ÄìHungarian mission in Durr√´s. In 1916, he was a leading member of the Albanian Literary Commission in Shkod√´r under the auspices of Austro‚ÄìHungary. In April 1917 he accompanied and facilitated the delegation of Albanian chieftains and leaders who visited Vienna and met with the Imperial authorities with an invitation by Ignaz Freiherr Trollmann. From 1920 to 1924 and 1926 to 1928, he served as Albanian consul in Austria. In 1924 he published a new edition of Thimi Mitko's Bleta Shqip√´tare using the modern Albanian alphabet. Pekmezi's work became at that time the best-known edition of Bleta Shqip√´tare. From 1928 until his death, he taught Albanian at the University of Vienna.

It is now a part of a district called Aberdeen in North East St Elizabeth and is not extinct as believed. Located at 430 metres above sea level, it was founded by runaway slaves escaping from estates in Trelawny Parish at the start of the nineteenth century.Michael Siva, After the Treaties: A Social, Economic and Demographic History of Maroon Society in Jamaica, 1739-1842, PhD Dissertation (Southampton: Southampton University, 2018), p. 191. Origins In 1812, a community of runaways started when a dozen men and some women escaped from the sugar plantations of Trelawny into the Cockpit Country, and they created a village named Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come. It is located near some cliffs and boasted fertile soils in its valleys. The community grew from its start of less than 20 runaway slaves to a large village that supported 14 buildings with shingle roofs and wood floors, raised poultry, hogs and nearly two hundred acres of cultivated land, thickly planted with provisions.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 191-2.Mavis Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), p.159. It is believed that runaway slaves who secured their freedom during the Second Maroon War, and had been a part of the community of Cuffee (Jamaica), joined Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come in succeeding years. Conflict with colonial authorities By the 1820s, Me-no-Sen-You-no- Come housed between 50 and 60 runaways. The headmen of the community were escaped slaves named Warren and Forbes. Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come also conducted a thriving trade with slaves from the north coast, who exchanged their salt provisions with the runaways for their ground provisions.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 191-2.Mavis Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), p.159. In October 1824, the colonial militias tried to destroy this community.Cynric Williams, A Tour through the island of Jamaica, from the Western to the Eastern End, in the Year 1823 (London: Thomas Hurst, 1827), p. 244. Some historians believe that the Maroons of Accompong Town successfully crushed this runaway community.Campbell, Maroons of Jamaica, p. 159.Orlando Patterson, Sociology of Slavery, p. 264. However, recent research shows that these Maroons had limited success, because after they left Me-no-Sen-You-no- Come to return to Accompong Town, a number of the runaways returned to the village and rebuilt huts. The Accompong Maroons succeeded only in killing one man, and capturing two women and three children.Siva, After The Treaties, pp. 192-3. https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/423482/1/LIBRARY_COPY_After_The_Treaties_Final.pdf Legacy The community of Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come continued to thrive in the Cockpit Country until Emancipation in the 1830s. It is located in the southwest corner of the Cockpit Country, which is called \\"The District of Look Behind,\\" now a part of the Upper Aberdeen community, because the redcoats rode two to a horse, one man facing the rear and nervously scanning the trees. Today, Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come is called Upper Aberdeen. Jamaican poet Kei Miller wrote a poem about Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come.

Family  The father of Ratko Pare≈æanin, Vidak Pare≈æanin, was Serb Orthodox priest hanged by the Austrians during the WWI. His mother Mileva gave birth to Ratko in Konjic, then in Austria-Hungary, on 24 February 1898.  Early life  Pare≈æanin was the youngest member of the Young Bosnia movement whose roommate in Belgrade in one period was Gavrilo Princip. After the Assassination of Ferdinand on 28 June 1914, Par≈æanin, who was 16 at that time, was arrested and put into Arad prison.  During the WWI   Interwar period  In period between 1929 and 1933, Pare≈æanin was an attach√© for journalists at Yugoslav embassy in Wien. In 1934 Pare≈æanin was responsible for scholarly profile of newly founded Institute for Balkan Studies. Pare≈æanin was director of the Institute since its founding in 1934 until it was disbanded by German occupying authorities in 1941.  During the WWII  When German occupying authorities approved publishing of the new daily newspaper \\"Our Struggle\\" () on 25 August 1941, Pare≈æanin was appointed as its editor. = Mission in Montenegro = In the end of 1944 Milan Nediƒá and Dimitrije Ljotiƒá sent Pare≈æanin and 30 members of his mission to visit Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá and convince him to retreat to Slovenia and to use the retreat of the German troops to do so. Pare≈æanin left Belgrade on 4 October 1944. He travelled via Ra≈°ka, Prizren and Skadar to reach ƒêuri≈°iƒá's headquarter in mid-October. ƒêuri≈°iƒá refused Pare≈æanins proposal because he believed that German troops will remain in Montenegro. For some time Pare≈æanin and 32 members of his mission stayed with ƒêuri≈°iƒá in his headquarter in Donja Gorica near Podgorica. When in mid-November 1944 German troops began their retreat to Sarajevo via Kola≈°in, Prijepolje and Vi≈°egrad, ƒêuri≈°iƒás Chetniks were concerned because they perceived German units as their support against the Communist forces. On 27 November 1944 ƒêuri≈°iƒás troops were informed about the order of Mihailoviƒá who requested that all Chetnik forces should concentrate on the line Vi≈°egrad - Foƒça - Gora≈æde - Kalinovik in Bosnia and wait for Allied forces who were expected to penetrate into Bosnia after invading of the Adriatic coast. On the other hand, Pare≈æanin continued to follow the plan set by Dimitrije Ljotiƒá, to gather all national forces in Slovenia and with help of the Allies liberate Yugoslavia from Communist forces. That is why Pare≈æanin insisted that ƒêuri≈°iƒá and his troops retreat to Slovenia. Germans refused the proposal of ƒêuri≈°iƒá to retreat together. At the end ƒêuri≈°iƒá decided to refuse proposal of Pare≈æanin and decided to follow orders of Mihailoviƒá to retreat to Bosnia and wait for Allied forces with other Chetnik forces. Pare≈æanin and his mission stayed in Montenegro for more than two months. At the beginning January, when Pare≈æanin realised that he failed to convince ƒêuri≈°iƒá to follow Ljotiƒás plan, he and members of his mission split with ƒêuri≈°iƒás forces in Prijepolje and Pare≈æanin and his mission reached Slovenia on 15 January 1945, after travelling through Sarajevo, Slavonski Brod and Zagreb. In Slovenia they joined forces of Ljotiƒá and Nediƒá. According to some sources, Germans selected five groups of men among national forces, each with ten to forty members. They sent them to training for terrorist actions to Kaiserwald and Nojshterlitz. Pare≈æanin was leader of one the groups. In March 1945, ƒêuri≈°iƒá regretted because he chose the wrong retreat route stating:\\"If I have followed advice of Pare≈æanin I would already been in Slovenia with my people, probably even before ƒêujiƒá.

She specializes in designing statistical models for research projects. During her academic career, Ford has worked as a professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine Collaborative Clinical Psychology Program. In September 2018, Ford alleged that then-U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in Bethesda, Maryland, when they were teenagers in the summer of 1982. She testified about her allegations during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing regarding Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination later that month.  Early life and education Ford grew up in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. Her parents are Paula K. and Ralph G. Blasey Jr., registered Republicans. She has two brothers, Tom and Ralph III. From 1978 through 1984, she attended the Holton- Arms School, a private, all-girls university-preparatory school in Bethesda, Maryland. While on her regional sports team for diving, she accompanied diver Greg Louganis on a trip to the White House to discuss the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott. She earned an undergraduate degree in experimental psychology in 1988 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She received a master's degree in clinical psychology from Pepperdine University in 1991. In 1996, she received a PhD in educational psychology from the University of Southern California. Her 1995 dissertation was entitled Measuring Young Children's Coping Responses to Interpersonal Conflict. In 2009, she earned a master's degree in epidemiology, with a focus on the subject of biostatistics, from Stanford University School of Medicine. Career Ford has worked in the academic and private sector as a biostatistician and research psychologist. Since 1998, she has worked as a research psychologist and biostatistician in the Stanford School of Medicine psychiatry department. Since 2011, she has been a psychology professor in the Stanford-PGSP Consortium for Clinical Psychology, a collaborative program between Palo Alto University and Stanford. Ford teaches subjects including psychometrics, study methodologies, clinical trials, and statistics to doctoral students and serves on dissertation committees. She has also performed consulting work for multiple pharmaceutical companies. She formerly worked as a director of biostatistics at Corcept Therapeutics, and as a biostatistical consultant for Titan Pharmaceuticals, and Brain Resource. She has collaborated with FDA, academic and industry statisticians, including leading roundtable discussions at the American Statistical Association‚Äôs Annual FDA-Industry meetings that focus on statistical analyzes in industry-FDA interactions. She is widely published within her field. Ford \\"specializes in designing statistical models for research projects in order to make sure they come to accurate conclusions,\\" as summarized by Helena Chmura Kraemer, a Stanford professor emeritus in biostatistics who co-authored a book and several articles with Ford. Ford has written or co-written several books about psychological topics, including depression. Her other research topics published in academic journal articles have included child abuse and the September 11 attacks. In 2015, she co- authored a book entitled How Many Subjects? Statistical Power Analysis in Research. Her research into the social impact of hiding one's sexual orientation was published in 2016 in the journal Behavior Therapy, and reviewed by psychologist William Gibson of the American Psychological Association, who found their research \\"demonstrates that issues of identity have relevance to mental health outcomes in ways that much of previous work misses.\\" Since coming forward with allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh, Ford has been unable to resume her teaching at Palo Alto University. Sexual assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh Ford being sworn in Ford's written testimony In early July 2018, after Judge Brett Kavanaugh was reported to be on Donald Trump's shortlist to become an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, Ford contacted both The Washington Post and her congresswoman, Anna Eshoo. On July 20, eleven days after Trump nominated Kavanaugh, Eshoo met with Ford, becoming convinced of her credibility and noting that Ford seemed \\"terrified\\" that her identity as an accuser might become public. Eshoo and Ford decided to take the matter to Senator Dianne Feinstein, one of Ford's senators in California and the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which would deliberate Kavanaugh's nomination. In a July 30, 2018 letter to Feinstein, Ford alleged that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when both were in high school in Bethesda, Maryland, and stated that she expected her story to be kept confidential. In August that year, Ford took a polygraph test with a former FBI agent who concluded Ford was being truthful when attesting to the accuracy of her allegations. Feinstein said that owing to her confidentiality commitment to Ford, she did not raise the issue in the initial Kavanaugh confirmation proceedings. On September 12, The Intercept reported (without naming Ford) that Feinstein was withholding a Kavanaugh-related document from fellow Judiciary Committee Democrats. On September 13, Feinstein referred Ford's letter to the FBI, which redacted Ford's name and forwarded the letter to the White House as an update to Kavanaugh's background check. The White House in turn sent the letter to the full Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator Dick Durbin asks Ford about her certainty of Brett Kavanaugh's identity in the alleged 1982 attack. On September 16, after media reported anonymous allegations and reporters started to track down her identity, Ford went public. Ford had wrestled with the choice to make her identity known, weighing the potential negative impact it could have on her, but ultimately spoke to The Washington Post, alleging that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in the summer of 1982 when she was 15 and he was 17. She said that, while his friend Mark Judge watched, Kavanaugh, intoxicated, held her down on a bed with his body, grinding against and groping her, covering her mouth when she tried to scream and trying to pull her clothes off. Finding it hard to breathe, she thought Kavanaugh was (her emphasis) going to kill her. She recounted escaping when Judge jumped on the bed and toppled them. As corroboration of her account, Ford provided the Post with the polygraph results as well as session notes from her couples therapist written in 2012. The therapist's notes do not name Kavanaugh but record Ford's claim of being attacked by students \\"from an elitist boys' school\\" who went on to become \\"highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington\\". The therapist's notes also say four boys were involved, which Ford attributed to an error by the therapist; Ford said in 2018 that four boys were at the party but only two were involved in the incident. Ford's husband recalled that she had used Kavanaugh's last name in her 2012 description of the incident. In an individual therapy session in 2013, Ford described a \\"rape attempt\\" that occurred in her late teens. Kavanaugh denied Ford's allegations. Attorneys Debra Katz, Lisa Blanks and Michael Bromwich represented Ford pro bono in the process of going public with her statements about Kavanaugh. Democratic adviser Ricki Seidman, who helped prepare Anita Hill for her testimony against Clarence Thomas during his 1991 Supreme Court nomination hearings, was brought in to personally advise Ford in navigating a potential hearing. On September 18, Ford's attorneys sent a letter to Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley requesting that the FBI investigate the incident before the Senate holds a hearing on Ford's allegations to \\"ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner, and that the Committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decisions\\". The letter additionally noted the significant public support Ford had received, but also severe harassment including death threats, forcing her to leave her home. The same day, a crowdfunding campaign was created to defray Ford's security costs, surpassing its $100,000 goal in less than 24 hours. On September 21, President Trump tweeted about Ford, saying that if Ford's allegations were true, either she or her parents would have reported them at the time of the event. Fortune called the tweet an attempt \\"to undermine her allegation\\" and Republican Senator Susan Collins‚Äîconsidered a key swing vote on Kavanaugh's nomination‚Äîsaid she is \\"appalled\\" by Trump's tweet, calling it \\"inappropriate and wrong\\". Trump's statements about Ford prompted sexual assault victims to start Tweeting using the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport to share reasons for silence. Trump issued several more statements, including a tweet alleging that Kavanaugh was \\"under assault by radical left wing politicians\\". Trump's attacks on Ford were widely characterized as victim blaming. On September 27, the Senate Judiciary Committee held an additional day of public hearings to discuss her allegations. Ford and Kavanaugh were the only witnesses scheduled. Ford testified that Kavanaugh \\"groped me and tried to take off my clothes\\", and that \\"I believed he was going to rape me.\\" Kavanaugh had previously denied all allegations of sexual assault as \\"totally false and outrageous\\" and testified separately later in the day. Republican members of the committee did not question Ford directly; that was done by Rachel Mitchell, a career prosecutor from Arizona retained by the committee's Republican majority to question Ford on their behalf. Alternating with Mitchell's questions, Democratic committee members questioned Ford themselves. Following the hearing, Mitchell produced a report stating that she did not believe a reasonable prosecutor would bring a case against Kavanaugh based on the evidence presented to the Committee and adding that there were multiple inconsistencies in Ford's testimony. Mitchell asserted that Ford's case was \\"even weaker than\\" the standard \\"he said, she said\\" case, because other witnesses identified by Ford \\"either refuted her allegations, or failed to corroborate them\\". In response to Mitchell's memo detailing her conclusions, several former prosecutors and legal analysts published rebuttals, arguing that Mitchell erred in questioning Ford without there having been an impartial and full investigation. Others noted that Mitchell's role was \\"akin to [that of] a defense attorney\\", and therefore she should not have submitted a prosecution report. Two MSNBC legal analysts characterized Mitchell's assertions that Ford had \\"no memory of key details\\" and that others had not corroborated her account as flawed arguments, even going so far as to describe Mitchell's conclusions as \\"reek[ing] of desperation\\" and \\"misleading at best and disingenuous at worst\\". On September 28, following requests from U.S. Senator Jeff Flake and from the Senate Judiciary Committee, President Trump ordered a supplemental FBI background investigation concerning the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh. On October 3, NBC News reported that Ford, Kavanaugh, and dozens of other witnesses were not interviewed by the FBI. The confidential FBI report was shown privately to members of Congress on October 4; Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said there was nothing new in the report and no corroboration of the allegations. On October 5, Ford's attorneys said she had no regrets about coming forward, and did not want Kavanaugh impeached if Democrats took control of Congress. The Senate confirmed Kavanaugh's nomination by a vote of 50‚Äì48 on October 6, 2018. By the time it was closed to further donations, the GoFundMe account set up on Ford's behalf had raised $647,610. As of November 21, 2018, Ford had used some of the money to cover security costs to protect herself and her family, but said that she would donate the remainder to organizations that support trauma survivors. Ford received a number of threatsincluding death threatsfor coming forward with her allegations against Kavanaugh. During her testimony, Ford stated, \\"I have been called the most vile and hateful names imaginable. People have posted my personal information on the internet. This has resulted in additional emails, calls, and threats. My family and I were forced to move out of our home.\\" , Ford stated that she was still being harassed and threatened and had to move four times as well as hire private security; furthermore, she had not been able to resume her teaching at Palo Alto University. In their 2019 book The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation, authors Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly interviewed Leland Keyser, a close friend of Ford's from high school, who, according to Ford, was at the party where the alleged assault took place (although not in the same room). Keyser initially stated through her attorney that while she did not recall the evening in question, she believed Ford, but in a later interview she stated that she no longer does. The interview revealed that Keyser, who is a Democrat, had felt pressured earlier to corroborate Ford's account.  Recognition  The Wing, a co-working network and club for women, named the conference room in its San Francisco headquarters after Ford. In November 2018, a GoFundMe started by Georgetown Law professor Heidi Li Feldman raised $30,000 towards endowing a professorship or scholarship in Ford's name. That same year, Time magazine included Ford on its shortlist for Person of the Year. On December 11, 2018, Ford presented the Sports Illustrated \\"Inspiration of the Year\\" award to Rachael Denhollander. In 2019, she was named one of that year's 100 most influential people in Time 100, having been nominated by Senator Kamala Harris. Additionally, Ford has been nominated for a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Distinguished Alumna Award for \\"speaking truth to power\\" when she went public with her sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh.  Selected works  = Books = * = Book chapters = = Journal articles =  * Personal life Before coming forward with allegations against Kavanaugh, Ford lived in Palo Alto, California, with her husband Russell Ford (whom she married in 2002) and their two sons. Since coming forward, she says that she has moved multiple times. Ford is the aunt of actress and singer Bridgit Mendler. Ford is a registered Democrat who has made small contributions to political organizations. In 2017, she participated in a local Women's March protesting President Trump and attended a March for Science in San Francisco to protest the Trump administration's cuts to research.

It is home to an extensive collection of Patsy Cline memorabilia as well as real-life artifacts once owned by the country singer, who died in a plane crash in 1963 at the age of 30. Patsy Cline at the Mint Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. Circa 1962  History  Born Virginia Patterson Hensley, Patsy Cline recorded three studio albums and had two number one songs on the country music chart before her untimely death, but death didn't actually stop her rise to fame. Her recorded music continued to chart, and her fan base continued to grow in the decades following her death, and she became the first female inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame ‚Äì 10 years posthumously. Shannon and Bill Miller, who also founded the Johnny Cash Museum, wanted to create a similar museum for Patsy Cline. They had the opportunity to do so after Charlie Dick ‚Äì Patsy Cline's husband ‚Äì died in 2015, leaving behind a collection of his and Patsy's belongings that he had previously kept hidden away.  Location  The 4,000-square-foot museum is located in the SoBro (South of Broadway) neighborhood on Third Avenue South in Nashville. It is open daily, with exceptions for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Admission is free for children under age 6, and children 6 to 15 pay reduced admission prices. Limited parking is available nearby on the surrounding streets.  Exhibits  The Patsy Cline Museum focuses on the relatively modest life Cline and her family led, in spite of her growing success and fame. Her husband, Charlie Dick, saved a lot of her personal possessions, including the sewing machine used by Cline's mother, Hilda Hensley, to sew the signature cowgirl costumes she wore early in her career, a custom cigarette lighter, and her salt and pepper shaker collection. He also kept the telegram he received from Colonel Tom Parker ‚Äì Elvis Presley's manager ‚Äì offering condolences after Cline's death. The halls in the museum include several exhibits that focus on specific stages in Cline's life. For example, one exhibit includes the sign, a wooden booth, and a milkshake maker from the pharmacy ‚Äì Gaunt's Drug Store ‚Äì where she worked during her teen years in Winchester, Virginia. Visitors can also see the porch seat from her childhood home in that same town. A recreated version of the dining room in the home she later shared with Charlie Dick in Nashville includes her Filter Queen vacuum cleaner and the canceled check she used to buy it. A replica of the home's rec room includes a hi-fi console and record player, various vinyl LPs, and a reel-to-reel tape player along with a black and white TV playing Cline's performances and a Norge refrigerator that still works. The red padded faux leather bar in the room has \\"Patsy & Charlie\\" printed on it. Interactive stations allow visitors to listen to Cline's music, watch clips of her performances, and read full copies of some of her handwritten letters. Many recognizable stage costumes, such as the sequined dress from her series of shows at Mint Casino in Las Vegas in 1962, are on display throughout the museum. Some of the costumes were designed by Cline herself and sewn by her mother. Various mementos are on display in the museum, including a large number of items that personally belonged to Cline and a few that tend to have an emotional impact, such as the Elgin watch ‚Äì a gift from her husband ‚Äì worn by Cline at the time of her death, her silver engraved wedding ring, the ID bracelet (with photos inside) that she gave to Charlie Dick, and the handkerchief used by her mom at her funeral. An AMI jukebox commemorates Cline's two songs that are on the list of Top 20 Jukebox Hits of All Time: #1 \\"Crazy\\" and #17 \\"I Fall to Pieces\\". Other exhibits include: * Wall of 45s displaying both A and B sides * Key to New York City given to Cline by Mayor Robert F. Wagner in 1961 * Canceled check used to pay the deposit for the furniture in her home * Oriental black jewelry box with costume jewelry * Boot-shaped cigarette lighter * Clock shaped like a pocket watch * Handwritten letters to family and fans * Wedding photo album and scrapbook * Album covers * Awards * Sketches of costume designs personally drawn by Cline * Jimmy Dean fan club card * Gold lam√© pants and shoes * Costumes and memorabilia from Sweet Dreams, the movie about Cline's life * Biopic hosted by Beverly D'Angelo, the actress nominated for a Golden Globe for her portrayal of Cline in Coal Miner's Daughter. The exhibits in the museum are arranged in chronological order, with the last one featuring the costumes designed by Cline that she asked Nudie Cohn ‚Äì a famous designer who created rhinestone-studded \\"Nudie suits\\" for many stars ‚Äì to make for her. She sent her request along with measurements to Cohn on February 28, 1963. His reply agreeing to do the job arrived after she passed away less than a week later on March 5, 1963.

History K√∏benhavns M√∏llestensfabrik was founded by Ferdinand Jensen (1844-1898) on 10 November 1868. The company was located on Toldbodvej (now Esplanaden). Jensen had recently returned from Germany and France where he had worked for some of the leading manufacturers of mill stones. The French mill stones were very sought after in Denmark at the time. The company published \\"Ferdinand Jensen's Handbook for the Mill Industry\\" (\\"Ferd. Jensens Haandbog i M√∏lleindustrien\\",) in 1893. The company was represented and won medals at a number of international exhibitions: 1879 (Berlin), 1880 (Malm√∏), 1888 (K√∏benhavn), 1896 (Malm√∏), 1897 (Stockholm). The growing company soon relocated to new and larger premises on Norgesgade (now Bredgade). It also started an import of Rheinich mill stones and later established a production of artificial mill stones. In 1775, Jensen established a sister company in Malm√∂. In 1994, he published a 75-page, bilingual (Danish and Swedish) \\"Illustreret Katalog over Maskiner og Artikler til M√∏llebrug fra Kj√∏benhavns M√∏llestensfabrik og Malm√∏ franska Qvarnstensfabrik\\". When the company's factory in Norgesgade also became too small, it relocated to a new site at Vodroffsvej 61 in Frederiksberg. A new factory was built in 1890. The ground floor contained the workshop. The first floor was used for offices and design studio. Hensen's father lived in an apartment of the second floor. Gerdinand Jensen lived with his family on the other side of the street in No. 56. The workshop in 1903 Ferdinand Jensen died from a stroke on 19 November 1898 The company was then continued by his widow Agnes Elisabeth Jensen (m√©e Gr√∏nberg) until 1916 in a partnership with Carl Hemmerth who served as managin director. The company received more medals on international exhibitions in 1901 (Gefle), 1903 (Helsingborg), 1906 (Nork√∂bing) and 1907 (Lund). It was converted into a limited company () in 1921. On 17 May 1922, it was merged with N. Nielsen & Co., a company founded on 13 July 1871 by Niels Nielsen. The company was now located at Rentemestervej.

It was designed by the architect Ricardo Mira in 1929 who in 1941 would also design La Moderna Poesia bookstore on Obispo Street for the same owner. It is often compared to the Bacardi Building in Old Havana, built two years before the L√≥pez Serrano Building, because of their similarity in massing and central tower. The congressman, senator and presidential candidate Eduardo Chib√°s was living on the fourteenth floor penthouse when he committed suicide in August 1951 on the air at CMQ Radio Station.  History  Lobby terrazzo floor The construction of the building was promoted by Jos√© Antonio L√≥pez Serrano, a publisher who ran La Moderna Poes√≠a. He was the son of Ana Lu√≠sa Serrano and Jos√© L√≥pez Rodr√≠guez, \\"Pote\\", a banker with ties to publishing. Pote arrived in Cuba as a poor and illiterate teenager who became an influential banker with ties to the government. In 1890 Pote married Ana Lu√≠sa Serrano, a wealthy widow who owned one of the best bookstores in Havana, La Moderna Poes√≠a. After the marriage, Pote took charge of the business opening several branches in other locations in Cuba. Jos√© L√≥pez's fortune was due not only to his advantageous marriage to Ana Lu√≠sa but also from supporting the Cuban independence cause. Relations with the main Cuban leaders would bring important economic benefits. Among these political alliances was the figure of General Jos√© Miguel G√≥mez, whom Pote financed the 1907 electoral campaign that would propel G√≥mez to the Presidency of the Republic. In 1908 Pote got an exclusive contract to print the tickets of the National Lottery, which translated into extensive financial benefits. He monopolized the printing of official documents such as bonds, stocks, stamps and bank notes, printed in La Casa del Timbre. Later, he would obtain from the Government of G√≥mez the concession for the construction of an iron bridge over the Almendares River connecting Calle Calzada with Miramar. Jos√© L√≥pez Rodr√≠guez committed suicide on March 28, 1921, at the time, he had accumulated 93 million dollars.

As a result, the most common welding methods for A36 are the cheapest and easiest: shielded metal arc welding (SMAW, or stick welding), gas metal arc welding (GMAW, or MIG welding), and oxyacetylene welding. A36 steel is also commonly bolted and riveted in structural applications. Tower Steel frame and location of brick walls. Tower above showing twelve support columns.Above the ten stories in the main body of the building, centrally located, is a tower of four apartments supported by ten steel columns that protrude from the main mass. The ten-story block is subdivided into four aisles to allow for a stair, three elevators and a brick wall down the middle which further subdivides the block into two apartments. The two apartment blocks to the east and west, have a line of structural columns running down the middle which in turn subdivide the apartment. An interior public corridor runs perpendicular to the three blocks, parallel to Calle 13, and links to the stair and three elevators. There is secondary stairs near the east entrance with windows at every landing. There were no fire stairs required by the Havana building code. The four luxury tower apartments were occupied by Jos√© Antonio L√≥pez Serrano who lived on the top floor, it was later occupied by Eduardo Chib√°s. Walls The exterior walls are brick with one inch, integral color cement plaster finish. There are raised plaster ornaments on the exterior walls and inscribed lines in the plaster suggesting a masonry bond in the lower part of the wall. There are also terracotta design panels inserted over some of the openings. All the windows and doors of the building are wood and glass in a wood frame. The floor of the apartments are covered with tiles with red and green geometric designs, there are tile baseboards. The interior walls are terracotta tile and covered in cement plaster. The floor of the lobby, the porch, and entrances to the building have ornate designs in red and black or red and green terrazzo. The walls of the lobby are Moroccan, book matched, red marble panels.. There is a nickel-silver relief El Tiempo (‚ÄòTime‚Äô) by graphic designer Enrique Garc√≠a Cabrera on the elevator wall of the lobby. The elevator doors are pivot hinged and originally were nickel silver with various Art Deco designs.  Distribution  Room distribution within apartments. Typical floor plan Apartment distribution per floor As per Havana zoning laws, the ground floor was required to have a porch facing 13th Street. It also had to provide public, commercial establishments. To this end, the building had various stores, a barbershop, restaurants and coffee shops. The distribution of the upper floors is as follows: from the second to the tenth floor, the building has eight apartments per floor, six with a separate service entrance opening directly into the kitchen and service area. Each apartment has access from the kitchen to what is called in Havana a \\"patio\\" (dark blue), this is an area equipped with a sink for doing laundry. A similar room labeled a patio can also be found in other modernist buildings such as the FOCSA Building of 1956 and the apartments at the Edificio del Seguro M√©dico of 1958 on La Rampa. The four apartments in the center have two bedrooms each. The east and west apartments have three bedrooms each and an extra small maid's bedroom located next to the kitchen with a toilet and a shower. Each apartment has a small bathroom with a window close to the bedrooms. The main entrance door to the apartment opens directly into the living room. Only the apartments in the center block have a short corridor connecting the bedrooms. This shortage of corridors in the design mandates that the circulation occurs mostly through the rooms thus decreasing their effective square footage. The dining room is connected to the kitchen and the patio. The center apartments on the south side have a smaller entry vestibule. Every apartment was originally provided with modern amenities: hot and cold water, gas, radio, and telephone service.

It displaced the more complex Carcel lamp which used a clockwork pump. Its mechanism was simpler and required less maintenance or repair. The moderator lamp was invented in 1837 by Charles-Louis-F√©lix Franchot (1809-1881) .Mechanic's Magazine, Publisher R. A. Brooman, 1855, Volume LXII, \\"The Moderator Lamp\\" pages 73-76 Like the Carcel lamp the oil reservoir was below the burner and it allowed 360 degree illumination. Earlier oil lamps such as the Argand had a reservoir above the burner which made them top heavy and obscured some of the light. The reliability of the mechanism led to them being adopted in lighthouses. Description A moderator lamp provides a pressurized supply of oil to the lamp wick by use of a spiral spring-loaded piston operating on a cylindrical oil reservoir. A regulating mechanism, the \\"moderator\\", compensates for the varying force of the spring as the piston descends. The moderator is a wire that runs through a tube in the center of the piston. When the spring is near the top of the reservoir, the wire runs through the full length of the tube. As the piston and tube lowers, and the spring force decreases, the wire is withdrawn from the tube and the flow of oil encounters less resistance. A steady stream of oil flows upward to the wick, with excess oil falling back into the reservoir above the piston.\\"New Lamps for Old Ones\\", \\"The Living Age\\", volume 77, 1863, page 106 The piston, made of leather discs clamped between metal washers, was also fitted with a valve to allow the piston to be withdrawn and the reservoir to be filled with oil. A winding key was provided with a rack, so that the piston could be raised and tension placed on the spring. These lamps were fueled by vegetable oil such as colza oil or rapeseed oil. These oils would be too thick to travel up a lamp wick without some applied pressure. A disadvantage of the lamp was that the weight mechanism had to be manually raised several times in one evening. If this was not done the wick burned. Moderator lamps replaced the more complex clockwork-driven Carcel lamps and were widely used by the end of the 19th century, for both residential lighting and for lighthouses.

While Two Door focuses on the compel of authoritative forces on the evictees, The Remnants dives in the life of the protesters after their release from the jail and scrutinizes the interpersonal relationships among them.  Background: The Yongsan Tragedy  On January 20, 2009, after failing to appeal to the government for protection against loss of homes and businesses, around 40 renters occupied an abandoned 4-story building in Yongsan District to protest against the insufficient compensation, as a result of urban redevelopment. The protesters were in possession of a considerable amount of incendiary materials and were throwing down Molotov cocktails in defense of the police suppression. In response to the protest, the police department swiftly despatched the SWAT team without prior run-through of the action or verbal negotiation with the protestors and the police was only equipped with one crane, one pump fire truck, and no air mattresses. During the clash between protestors and the police, a fire broke down and eventually took the life of five protestors and one police officer.  Film synopsis  Unsatisfied with the compensation of relocation offered by the government, a group of protestors made up of renters and small business owners organized a sit-in demonstration on the abandoned building. The demonstration soon called the attention of the local police force, and the riot police was deployed to repress the protest. The riot police used water cannon to expel the evictees but failed as the protesters ran into a lookout built prior to the demonstration. The SWAT team quickly reacted to this action by attempting to enter the building from the rooftop, but instantaneously an unknown fire broke down in the lookout and caused the death of five evictees and one police officer. The protestors were brought to trial and sentenced to jail for four years. Besides the unstated facts, the documentary film focuses heavily on the personal life, the reunion and the conflicts of the evictees after their release.  Captured Evictees  Ju-hwan Kim: Kim lived by himself and had serious drinking problems as a defense mechanism to get away from the traumatic memory. Kim was the person who was in charge of building the lookout and later admitted in the film that he dropped a firebomb, which might have led to the fire. Chang-su Kim: After the release, Kim found out that his wife had cancer during his time in jail and faced the suspicion from his daughter on his integrity, which made him image the life he would have if he did not participate in the demonstration. Kim was also one of the protestors who urged to reunite the evictees and form a support system within themselves. Chung-yeon Lee: Lee was the Chair of the committee of evictee before the tragedy and opened a new bar after his release. He had been actively participating in civil rights demonstrations across the nation by himself since the release for the tragedy to be remembered and equity to be restored. Yet all he got out of the demonstrations were frustration and infuriation from the misunderstandings and opposition from the other evictees. Lee's father also died in the tragedy and Lee said that he had long been remorseful for jumping off the building by himself first after pushing away his father. Seok-jun Ji: Ji feels extremely traumatized by the incident as he could still hear the sounds and voices from that night and oftentimes had to cure his sorrow and fear with alcohol. Ji is one of the most active evictees in organizing a reunion and starting a support group for the evictees as he believed that the mental insurity could be alleviated by talking to people who had gone through the same tragedy. Ju-seok Chun: Chun was heavily injured after the tragedy and had been living off the belief that two of the other evictees who died in the incident helped him escape and he must pursue and restore justice for the two evictees. However, at the end of the movie when all five evictees gathered together to rewatch a video from the night, Chun found out that he was not helped by the two other evictees who he long believed to have saved his life.  Festivals and Awards  The film received the following awards: *2016, The Association of Korean Independent Film & Video *2016, Best Korean Independent Film Awarded *2016, The 8th DMZ Korean International Film Festival Best Korean Documentary Award and Audience Award *2016, The 21st Busan International Film Festival *2016, The Seoul Independent Film Festival *2019, 6th Wildflower Film Awards: Grand Prize  Controversy and Policy Implication  The controversy on Yongsan tragedy lies not only in the unpreparedness and recklessness of the police action, but also in the biased judicial judgment and its violation to human rights. While the protestors were sent to jail, all police officers were related government official were exonerated. The trial result showed a perception of the protesters as ‚Äúurban terrorists‚Äù but not ‚Äúvictims of forced eviction‚Äù. Despite the resistance of the National Human Rights Commission in Korea to take actions against the trial result, the UN Committee on Economic and Social Rights agitated the Korean government to entrench sufficient compensation and fair relocation for the evictees. On January 31, 2018, five protesters from Yongsan Tragedy were pardoned from jail by the president. On the same evening, a cultural protest claiming to advocate for the underrepresented was held in Gwanghwamun and welcomed the evictees. Aligned with the protest, two National assembly members proposed the ‚ÄúProtection from Eviction Act‚Äù, which aimed to assure the rights of the evictees and to hold government and businesses accountable for the guarantee of means of living and housing for the evictees. Since 2016, a complex has been constructed on the site of Yongsan Tragedy, and there will no longer be any tangible remnants of Yongsan tragedy.

Situated within the Glacier Peak Wilderness, Snowking Mountain is positioned west of the crest of the North Cascades Range, approximately 18 miles northeast of the town of Darrington. It has two subsidiary peaks, West Peak (7425 ft), and Middle Peak (7400 ft). Its nearest higher peak is Mount Misch, to the southeast. A broad unnamed glacier known colloquially as Snowking Glacier rests on the north face. Downslope of that glacier are Snowking Lake, Found Lake, and Cyclone Lake. Precipitation runoff from Snowking Mountain drains into tributaries of the Skagit River. Climate Snowking Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Jaynes and starring C. Thomas Howell. The film is based on Eric S. Brown's book series of the same name. Plot After the mayor of Boggy Creek is murdered by an unknown assailant, local news reporter Kendall Sharp for KRKR-8 News delivers a special report on a series of disappearances and unsolved murders. After first suggesting that Sasquatch may be responsible for the murders, Sharp suggests that local criminal Eddie Justertin, a member of a \\"self-styled, Dixieland mafioso family,\\" may be the one to blame. The following day, six young adults (Steve, Heather, Amanda, Danny, Jo, and Collyn) trespass into a closed section of a state park, where they plan to camp for the weekend. After playing volleyball and drinking some beer, the teens separate. Moments later, they are attacked by Bigfoot. Some (but not all) of the campers are killed on screen. The next day, Sheriff Jim Taylor and Deputy Walton arrive to investigate the murders. While there, an unidentified police official arrives on the crime scene and informs the sheriff that one of the victims (Steve McTee) is the son of a local oil tycoon, who is putting pressure on the department to solve the murder. The sheriff believes the teens have been attacked by a bear, but his deputy believes in Bigfoot. Through a phone call, the sheriff learns that only five bodies were found, and that one of the campers, a female, is missing. On the other side of town, ex-deputy Mark Kline (who was fired for being an alcoholic) discovers a missing and disheveled woman named Dakota running through the woods. While rescuing her, Kline spots a Bigfoot in the woods before driving off and delivering Dakota to the local hospital. At the hospital, Sheriff Taylor interviews his drunk ex- deputy, who swears he saw a Bigfoot. In a separate interview, the local doctor (Dr. Leonard Evans) tells the sheriff that the wounds do not look like they came from a bear, but that is what he will put on the death certificate. The sheriff visits Dakota's home in an attempt to tell the girl's father Zeke that she has been located, but is met with hostility by the girl's family. That evening, the sheriff's daughter Savannah goes to the local drive-in with her boyfriend Billy. While the two are making out in Billy's car, Bigfoot enters the drive-in and crushes Billy's head by stomping on it before dragging Savannah off into the woods. The next day, news reporter Sharp along with her camera man (Aaron) head into the woods in search of Bigfoot. They find him, and the monster chases them through the woods. Back at the sheriff's office, sheriff Taylor, Deputy Walton, and Dakota's father Zeke form a posse to enter the woods and find the sheriff's daughter. While fleeing from Bigfoot, reporter Sharp and cameraman Aaron stumble upon the hideout of Eddie Justertin. Eddie fires a warning shot followed by a second shot from point blank range that misses the two. The two flee the shed but cameraman Aaron is quickly killed after stepping on a landmine. Reporter Sharp fires several shots at Bigfoot with Aaron's handgun and fails to kill the beast, but then the sheriff and his posse arrive and Deputy Walton shoots Bigfoot several times with a tactical shotgun, killing it. The deputy then turns around and is impaled by a spear thrown by someone/something off screen. Zeke performs a Bigfoot call and a second Bigfoot emerges from the woods, which Zeke promptly shoots in the head. During a long speech, Zeke explains to the sheriff and the reporter that all female Bigfoot have gone extinct, and Bigfoot must now survive by kidnapping human females and impregnating them. Back at the hospital, Dr. Evans discovers that Dakota is indeed pregnant. Later, Dakota gives birth, and asks to see her baby. Back in the woods, the sheriff's posse discover Bigfoot's lair, where the creatures rape their human victims. There they discover the sheriff's daughter Savannah alive, and free her. While the sheriff frees his daughter, Zeke finds a Bigfoot, attacks it with a sledgehammer, cuts its head off, and carries it around. The two girls escape from the lair and are seen running through the woods, but when Zeke uses explosives to try and close up the cave, he accidentally separates the two parties. Zeke and Sheriff Taylor emerge from another exit and enter a clearing. There, many Bigfoot (six or more) emerge from the woods and surround the two men. The men are able to shoot a couple of Bigfoot, but there are too many. Zeke produces a rocket launcher and shoots more, but more than half a dozen remain. Armed with only a machete and a sledgehammer, the two men hold their ground until more than a dozen Bigfoot pounce on them, ripping the two men to shreds. Cast *C.

Sunday, the seventh day, finds the merry crowd aboard the yacht playing \\"put and take\\" while John, Betty, their elderly relatives, and the \\"hired girl\\" are getting ready for church. Patricia and one of the crowd from the yacht go ashore to get some supplies and she is enticed to go to church, which is a novel experience for her. John takes her back in a row boat. Later, he calls on her in a motorboat and tells her that he loves her. It is then that he learns that she is engaged to Reggie. Disillusioned and hurt, he is told by Donald Peabody (Young) that Reggie has taken Betty aboard the yacht. John goes for his sister, knocking down Reggie when he objects. Reggie and Patricia decide to end their engagement, and Reggie manfully telling Betty of his love for her. At the end of the film Patricia is going to John.

She began serving Southeast Alaska Communities in 2019.  Construction and characteristics  In late 2006, the Alaska Marine Highway System began a study for a new Lynn Canal ferry. A number of different concepts were explored over the years and succeeding governors had different ideas for new ferries. In 2010 the Alaska legislature appropriated $60 million for the first \\"Alaska- class\\" ferry. This was to be matched by $68 million of federal funding. Later in 2010 Governor Sean Parnell made the decision to forgo any federal funding of the ferry, opting instead to give the contract to an Alaskan firm in order to bring jobs to the state and stimulate the local shipbuilding industry. The legislature backed the governor, appropriating an additional $60 million for the ferry in 2011 to make up for lost federal funding. In April 2012 the Alaska Department of Transportation contracted with Alaska Ship and Drydock, later acquired by Vigor Industrial, to assist in the design of the ship with the expectation that it would bid on its construction at the shipyard it managed in Ketchikan. By the end of 2012 cost estimates for the proposed vessel significantly exceeded the $120 million that had been appropriated. Governor Parnell ordered a halt to the project and redirected the effort towards two smaller, cheaper day-use vessels. The Elliott Bay Design Group of Seattle, Washington delivered a preliminary design study for the smaller day boat Alaska-class ferries in the summer of 2013 and a final design in 2014. Based on this design, a request for proposal was sent to Vigor Alaska on August 1, 2014. Negotiations between the state and Vigor resulted in a contract signing on October 16, 2014 for the construction of two ferries for a guaranteed maximum price of $101,513,651. Tazlina's keel was laid in a ceremony attended by Governor Bill Walker on December 13, 2014. The vessel was built as 23 prefabricated modules that were assembled into the ship. She was the first Alaska ferry and the largest vessel ever built in the state. She was launched on May 16, 2018 with little fanfare. The public ceremony came on August 11, 2018 when she was christened in Ketchikan by former Alaska First Lady Donna Walker. Tazlina is long, with a beam of , and a full-load draft of . Her hull is constructed of welded steel plates. She displaces 3,016 long tons. Her gross tonnage under international rules is 5,304, while her U.S. gross register tonnage is 3,217. She has vehicle loading doors in her transom, bow, and port side to accommodate different port configurations. Stern loading on M/V Tazlina She cruises at 16.5 knots, at which speed she burns 250 gallons of diesel fuel per hour. Her maximum speed is 17.9 knots. She has two Electro- Motive Diesel 12-710G7CT3 engines which produce 3,000 bhp each. They drive two four-bladed variable-pitch propellers which are in diameter. The ship also has a bow thruster. Electrical power on the ship is provided by three Caterpillar C-18 generators capable for producing 500kW each. Her tanks hold of diesel fuel and of potable water. She has a vehicle deck with of lanes which can accommodate 53 standard-sized vehicles. She has a single passenger deck which can carry 300 passengers. The passenger deck is equipped with a cafeteria, solarium, quiet room, and children's play area. Tazlina was built as a day boat, so she has no crew quarters for overnight accommodation or passenger staterooms. She normally carries a crew of 14. All Alaska Marine Highway Ferries are named after glaciers. Tazlina's namesake is the Tazlina glacier. She received her name in 2016 through an essay contest for Alaska school children. Seventh-grader Malea Voran of Port Alsworth nominated Tazlina because it is an Athabaskan word for \\"swift river\\", which she thought appropriate for the ferry.  Operating history  Tazlina made her maiden voyage on May 7, 2019 from Juneau to Haines. Her regular schedule during the 2019 summer season was to sail from Juneau to Haines to Skagway and back to Haines where she spent the night. The crew went ashore and stayed in a hotel. The next day Tazlina reversed her route and returned to Juneau. She was scheduled to complete this round-trip three times a week. Tazlina replaced M/V Fairweather on this route. Tazlina and the rest of the Alaska Marine Highway System was idled when ferry workers struck on July 24, 2019. A settlement was reach and she returned to service on August 4, 2019. She was idled again at the end of the summer season but returned to service in Lynn Canal on November 22, 2019 as a replacement for two ferries with maintenance issues. She was idled again in mid-January for repairs and warranty work, returning to service on March 5, 2020. The cost of Tazlina's overnight crew accommodations in Haines during her summer 2019 runs exceeded budget by $400,000. This overnight stop was the result of the fact that Tazlina is too slow to complete a Juneau- Haines-Skagway-Juneau round-trip in a single 12-hour shift. U.S. Coast Guard regulations specify that ship crews can work no more than a 12-hour shift. The lack of quarters for a second crew on Tazlina effectively limits her to routes that can be completed in 12 hours or less. The Alaska Marine Highway System proposed to retrofit crew quarters into Tazlina and Hubbard. This would allow them to complete longer routes, but at a cost of over $30 million. The legislature appropriated almost $17 million to retrofit one of the ships, but Governor Mike Dunleavy vetoed the appropriation in April 2020. Instead, the ship was scheduled for separate Juneau-Skagway and Juneau-Haines roundtrips during the summer of 2020. In the face of state budget cuts and reduced ridership due to Covid-19, Tazlina did not sail during the summer 2020 season. As of August 2020, Tazlina remained idle, moored at the Auke Bay ferry terminal.

This slow-growing palm grows up to 10m, although it is often less tall. It is identifiable by its feather palm pinnate leaves that arch inwards towards a thick stout trunk. Nomenclature These palms are often called Butia capitata in horticulture. It was seen as a synonym of that more tropical species until 2011, and many botanical gardens, collectors, and those in the nursery trade have not yet changed their labelling. Even more confusingly; plants with the invented name B. capitata var. odorata have circulated in the horticultural trade which were actually the in 2010 newly named B. catarinensis, from further north along the Brazilian coast. In Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, local vernacular names for this plant in Portuguese are buti√°-da- praia, or just buti√°. =Etymology= The specific epithet odorata is derived from the Latin word for 'perfumed' and was chosen by Jo√£o Barbosa Rodrigues in 1891 to reflect the highly aromatic nature of the fruit, considered among the best palm fruit for consumption in Brazil at the time. Taxonomy Until 2011 this species was lumped together with Butia capitata, a species first described by Karl Friedrich Philipp von Martius in 1826 in montane grasslands in the inner country in Minas Gerais. During fieldwork in the southeast of the state of Bahia, the US palm botanist Larry R. Noblick observed the real B. capitata in situ, and being quite familiar with cultivated B. odorata in Florida where he worked, and having visited the coastal population in 1996, became convinced that they could not represent one of two very disjunct populations of the same species. Noblick incorrectly attempted to separate the taxa twice, in 2004 and 2010, before finally succeeding in 2011, choosing the oldest name which had unambiguously been given to this population: Cocos odorata by Jo√£o Barbosa Rodrigues (C. pulposa was described in the same work, but O comes before P in the alphabet, so C. odorata has priority). Odoardo Beccari subsumed this taxon as a variety under B. capitata in 1916 (as B. capitata var. odorata) along with a number of other taxa such as Cocos pulposa, C. elegantissima, C. erythrospatha and C. lilaceiflora, which he all made different varieties of B. capitata. He also named two new taxa as varieties of B. capitata: B. capitata var. subglobosa and B. capitata var. virescens. In 1936 Liberty Hyde Bailey added two more varieties, B. capitata var. nehrlingiana and B. capitata var. strictior. J. R. Mattos added yet another in 1977, B. capitata var. rubra, B. capitata thus having eleven different varieties at the time (see below). All except the nominate form are now considered synonyms of B. odorata. In 1970 Sidney Fredrick Glassman moved this taxon (as B. capitata), along with all other Butia, to Syagrus, but in 1979 he changed his mind and moved everything back. Description =Description= Habit Younger tree in Sert√£o Santana, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. This is a solitary-trunked palm with a stout erect to slightly inclined trunk, occasionally being subterranean, growing up to 2 to 10m high and 0.32 to 0.6m in diameter. The trunks narrow to 20 cm diameter towards the crown. Leaves It has 13 to 32 pinnate, glaucous to dark-green coloured leaves arching down towards the trunk and arranged spirally around the crown. The petiole is 30‚Äì75 cm long, 1-1.2 cm thick, 3.3-3.9 cm wide, and has both stiff rigid fibres and spines up to 5 cm long along the margins (edges) of the petiole. The top of the petiole is flat or slightly convex, the underside is rounded. The rachis of the leaf is 70‚Äì200 cm long and has 35 to 60, exceptionally 66, pairs of pinnae (leaflets). Unlike other species of Butia (except B. catariensis), these are inserted in groups of 2 to 4 at slightly divergent angels along the rachis, but without giving the leaf a plumose aspect such as in Syagrus. The pinnae are clustered slightly together near the base of the leaf blade. These pinnae are opposite each other in a pair; each pair forms a neat 'V'-shape. The pinnae in the middle of the leaf blade are 31‚Äì60 cm long and 1.2-2.5 cm wide. Basal pinnae are 30‚Äì40 cm long and 0.3-0.6 cm wide; apical pinnae are 18‚Äì22 cm long and 0.4-0.5 cm wide. Flowers The developing inflorescence is protected in a woody spathe, 60‚Äì180 cm in total length, which is usually hairless but may rarely be densely pruinose (covered in waxy flakes) or tomentose (furry); the spathe has a swollen part at the end 33‚Äì150 cm long and 6‚Äì16 cm wide, and ends in a sharp apex (tip). The inflorescence is branched to the first order. The rachis of the inflorescence is 20‚Äì104 cm long and has 35-141 rachillae (flowering branches) 15‚Äì132 cm in length. The flowers may be coloured yellow, reddish-orange, purple, yellow & purple, or greenish-yellow. The pistillate (female) flowers are 5-6mm in length; the staminate (male) flowers are 5-7mm in length. Like all species of Butia studied, this species has relatively larger pollen grains than that of other genera of palm present in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. These grains are bilaterally symmetrical, suboblate, monosulcate, and with the end piriform (pear-shaped). The surface is covered in minute 2Œºm-large reticulate patterns. Fruit The fruit are usually wider than they are long. They are very variable in size; most fruit are 2-3.5 cm by 1.4-4.3 cm. The ripe fruit have a persistent perianth and may be coloured yellow, orange, red, greenish-yellow or purple. The flesh is often yellow but may also be coloured in different hues. The taste is variable, generally sweet and sour, but may be more of one or the other depending on the tree. The fruits are highly aromatic. It has a hard nut which is usually round in shape, sometimes more ovoid, 1.3-2.2 cm by 1.3‚Äì2 cm in size, and containing 1 to 3 seeds and a homogeneous endosperm. =Similar species= It is similar to B. capitata, a smaller plant of the inland cerrado with a less thick trunk and which is not hardy. It has much more elongated, less globose, fruit, and can also be distinguished by tiny details of the leaves. =Infraspecific variability= Comparison of fruit by Jo√£o Barbosa Rodrigues in 1901. B. odorata is 'B' (as Cocos pulposa) & 'C' (as C. odorata) -note the somewhat flatter fruit, which is much larger in the cultivated pulposa race. Butia yatay is 'A', B. eriospatha is 'D', and Syagrus coronata is 'E'. These palms exhibit much variability in both their native homeland as well as in cultivated specimens. Many of these variable forms were originally described as distinct species. Odoardo Beccari subsumed these as varieties of Butia capitata in 1916. Modern botany would consider these variations to be cultivars or landraces. *B. capitata var. odorata [1891] - nominate form, yellow fruit. *B. capitata var. elegantissima, C. elegantissima [1906] *B. capitata var. erythrospatha, C. erythrospatha [1906] - red-coloured spathes *B. capitata var. lilaceiflora, C. lilaceiflora [1906] *B. capitata var. nehrlingiana [1936] *B. capitata var. pulposa [1891] - much larger fruit (see illustration), often in local cultivation in Brazil and Uruguay. *B. capitata var. rubra [1977] - red fruit, described from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, but forms with this colour fruit also occur in Uruguay. *B. capitata var. strictior [1936] - cultivated in USA, leaves lacking typical arch except at the very end of the leaf, thus standing almost vertical from the crown. *B. capitata var. subglobosa [1916] *B. capitata var. virescens [1916] *glaucous blue leaves described by Soares & Witeck [2009].

Vorster (Mule palm) - This is a hybrid of Butia odorata with Syagrus romanzoffiana found both naturally in the wild as well as in cultivation, it was first described from garden examples in Europe. Distribution Palms growing in the wild in Ca√±ada del Paso del Ba√±ado near the Laguna Negra, Palmares de Castillos, Rocha Department, Uruguay. It is native to southern Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, from the municipalities of Palmares do Sul and Porto Alegre south to Treinta y Tres and Rocha Department in northern Uruguay. Bauermann et al. investigated the possibility of using palm pollen, including this species, in palynology, in order to try to provide more detail about the ancient changes in habitat in the state Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil by tracking the changes in distribution and abundance of the palms, but were unable to provide much detail on the subject. =Habitat= It is distributed in a band along the coast of southernmost Brazil, extending into Uruguay. In this region it is found in restinga habitat in fields on top of the hills hugging the coast. It may also occur in grasslands (pampa), seasonally semi-deciduous Atlantic forest, and rocky outcrops. It grows in sandy and rocky soils which are often dry, such as stabilised dune formations. It does not occur in more humid habitats. It commonly is found growing in small aggregated clusters; these palm groves are known locally as butiazais or butiatubas. It grows from 0-500m in altitude. =Non-native distribution= Despite being extensively planted in several areas across southern Europe, the United States, and elsewhere, this species is rarely recorded as escaping from gardens or naturalising. In 2000 in Flora of North America Scott Zona stated that B. odorata showed little inclination for escaping cultivation, but as of 2018 the USDA PLANTS database has it as naturalized in the states of Florida, North and South Carolina of the United States. In 1996 the unpublished Flora of the Carolinas and Virginia, used as the reference in the PLANTS database, stated the species (as B. capitata) to be present in coastal North and South Carolina. In 2004, 2005 & 2008 the same flora, expanded to Georgia by 2004 and northern Florida in 2008, stated that this palm (as B. capitata) is not naturalised in the region, but that it is widely planted along the coastal strip of southeastern North Carolina, eastern South Carolina, eastern Georgia and northern Florida, and that these garden plants often persist despite neglect and can appear naturalised in superficially semi-natural locations. Flora of the Carolinas, Virginia, and Georgia, Working Draft of 17 March 2004 In 2018 the first instance of this palm (now identified as B. odorata) naturalising in this region was published, based on specimen vouchers collected in 2007 from young plants some distance from human habitation in Camden Co., in the far southeast corner of Georgia. By at least 2009 an anonymous source considered this palm naturalised in Florida and it was included in the USDA PLANTS database. In 2010 this opinion was validated when the first instance of a naturalised palm was published, recording a 2005 collection of a specimen in the dunes of the Chinsegut Wildlife and Environmental Area in Hernando Co., a former farm and estate with some plantings of Butia palms. Another instance of this palm naturalising was recorded in literature (no voucher) in 2013 in Silver River State Park, Marion Co.. As of 2018, the Atlas of Florida Plants shows voucher specimens (identified as B. capitata (with a caveat)) have been collected in the central and northern counties of Hernando, Volusia, Washington, Liberty, Gadsden, Leon and Wakulla.Atlas of Florida Plants http://florida.plantatlas.usf.edu/Plant.aspx?id=4222 Ecology Butia odorata frequently serves as a host for the epiphyte fig species Ficus cestrifolia (locals sometimes believe that fruit from these trees is much more sweet). It is also host to two lichens: Cladonia ahtii and C. palmicola. C. palmicola was first collected in 1989, described in 1995, and as of 2012 has only been found on the trunks of Butia trees growing along the coast from Santa Catarina State to Uruguay. Butterfly caterpillars recorded feeding in Uruguay in 1974 on this palm (B. odorata identified as Syagrus capitata in this study) are Blepolenis batea and Opsiphanes invirae, either the nominate form or possibly subspecies remoliatus. The caterpillars of the Indonesian butterfly Cephrenes augiades augiades and the Australian C. trichopepla may also feed on the leaves this palm. Uses =In prehistory= Around 4750 BC, as the climate started to dry out for a prolonged period, an agricultural civilisation began to develop in the extensive wetlands around Mer√≠n Lagoon in Rocha department, Uruguay, as evidenced today by thousands of mounds, known as cerritos, strewn over the landscape. These peoples lived in sedentary villages that accumulated household refuse such as broken tools, stone flakes, shells, pieces of charcoal or bone, other remains of foods, and pottery sherds and graves in a later archaeological stage, eventually forming mounds, which during a later stage were expressly enlarged and heightened with such materials as burnt termite mounds and gravel. These people survived on a diet based on some hunting and fishing along with the cultivation of maize and gourds, and later beans, and collection of tuberous marsh plants such as Typha, Canna, Marantha and Araceae. Nuts and phytoliths of Butia odorata are abundant here in association with the traces of human occupancy from even before the first evidence of the adoption of agriculture throughout many millennia of the mound-builder villages, thus indicating that the fruit and fronds were used, but it is unclear if the nearby palm groves were wild, cultivated or encouraged to spread (either by design or not). Around approximately AD 0 a new people moved into the north of this region from the Amazon, the ancestors of the Tupi-Guaran√≠ peoples, which initially settled in the dense woodland along the margins of the larger rivers, where they practised slash-and-burn agriculture using crops such as cassava, peanuts, gourds, beans, potatoes and sweet potatoes. These peoples lived in sedentary to semi-permanent villages of numerous family longhouses arranged in circles around the centre, and had a culture including managing fallow lands for further agricultural production, wearing lip discs, ritual anthropophagic feasts with fermented beverages, long distance trade using roads, exclusive use of bark for fuel in pottery kilns and funerary hearths, and cremation with the remains buried in urns in the village centre. Nuts of B. odorata have been found in the remains of such a village dating from 1460‚Äì1800 AD. =As an ornamental= The approximate cultivation range of pindo palms in the US with little to no winter protection. B. odorata is frequently grown in Mediterranean Europe, the southern USA, Australia and southern Brazil as an ornamental garden plant. It is notable as one of the hardiest feather palms, sometimes tolerating brief drops in temperature down to about ‚àí10 ¬∞C at night; it is often cultivated in subtropical climates. In Europe, this palm can be found close to the Mediterranean, though some specimens are cultivated as far north as southern U.K. In the United States, B. odorata is grown along the West Coast from San Diego to Seattle, and along the East Coast from Florida to Virginia Beach. In climates in the far north, such as the coastal areas of the Netherlands it is advised to plant the palms in full sunlight. Larger specimens are said to take -10 to -12 ¬∞C, but should be protected at -5 ¬∞C, for example by wrapping heating strips around the trunk. It should be protected from excess rain during the winter, for example with a small, open tent. The substrate should be very porous so that water drains away from the roots quickly. In the summer this palm demands lots of water and should be watered regularly. It is possible to harvest fruit in as far north as the Netherlands. =As food= It is cultivated as a fruit tree in Brazil and Uruguay, and especially the larger-fruited, semi-domesticated, pulposa-type plants are reasonably common in local orchards. In the type most often grown in the USA, the ripe fruit are about the size of large cherry, and yellowish/orange in colour, but can also include a blush towards the tip. The taste is a mixture of pineapple, apricot, and vanilla. Taste can vary depending on soil conditions, and the tastes of apple, pineapple, and banana together is also common. It is tart and sweet at the same time, with a flesh similar to a loquat, but slightly more fibrous. Chemistry The triterpenes cylindrin and lupeol methyl ether can be isolated from Butia odorata leaf epicuticular waxes. Conservation Noblick in 1996 notes that the population he visited growing in a cattle pasture that had once been restinga was unhealthy as there was no recruitment (growth of new individuals). Rejuvenation of the population was hindered by fires and cattle grazing. Noblick also notes that much of its former habitat was being converted to rice fields. As of 2018 the conservation status has not been evaluated by the Centro Nacional de Conserva√ß√£o da Flora in Brazil. As of 2017, like all four species of Butia native to Uruguay, it is protected by law. Adult palms may not be felled or moved without government permission.

The government was supported by the same right-of-center alliance of Christian Social Party and Greater German People's Party that had underpinned the first Schober government. In terms of personalities, it was virtually identical to the Breisky government that had replaced Schober's first cabinet for a single day after the alliance had temporarily broken down, the People's Party having become disaffected with Schober over his foreign policy. Schober never fully regained the People's Party's trust and was unseated for a second time a mere four months later.  Background  = Economy = In the final decades of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the region that would later become the Republic of Austria had been dependent on Bohemian industry and on Bohemian and Hungarian agriculture for its standard of living. The Austria of 1921 was structurally weak and forced to import large amounts of food and coal from Czechoslovakia. The poor tax base and brutal trade imbalance prompted the Austrian government to print too much money. By 1921, the country had exhausted its reserves and inflation was galloping. Austria relied on foreign loans to keep buying Czechoslovak food and coal and to generally just keep running; it would require even more foreign loans, drastically larger ones, to reform its currency and to actually restructure. The list of potential creditors was short and consisted essentially of the Allies of World War I and of Czechoslovakia itself. None of these countries would loan the necessary amounts to Austria, however, as long as there were still worries that Austria might try to join the German Reich or to restore the Habsburgs to power in defiance of the Treaty of Saint-Germain. In late 1921, the first Schober government negotiated the Treaty of Lana, an agreement with Czechoslovakia in which Austria promised to honor the Treaty of Saint-Germain, to refrain from interfering in Czechoslovak internal affairs, and to remain neutral in the event on an attack on Czechoslovakia by a third party. Czechoslovakia made equivalent promises in return. Czechoslovakia also promised to put in a good word for Austria in London and Paris and, in fact, committed to a generous loan itself. There finally seemed to be light at the end of the tunnel. = Political climate = Ignaz Seipel, the Christian Social leader who first installed, then unseated Schober The Christian Social Party held the plurality but not the majority of the seats in the National Council. A grand coalition of Christian Socials and Social Democrats had already been tried and failed; unable to reconcile their fundamentally different visions for the future of the country, Christian Social and Social Democratic leaders had achieved little but mutual deadlock. The failure of the grand coalition left the Greater German People's Party as the only plausible coalition partner. The Republic of German-Austria had been proclaimed with the understanding that it would eventually join the German Reich, a vision shared by a clear majority of its population at the time. The treaties of Versailles and Saint-Germain prohibited a union of the two countries, but unification remained popular. In particular, the accession of Austria into the Reich was one of the two defining platform planks of the Greater German People's Party. In the Treaty of Lana, Austria reconfirmed its commitment to independence. Austria also reconfirmed its renunciation of all its claims to the Sudeten Germans, the German-speaking former Habsburg subjects living in what used to be Bohemia, another offense to the pan-German sensitivities of the People's Party. The same treaty that looked like it might turn the Austrian economy around thus also prompted the People's Party to withdraw its support from Schober, the decision that eventually brought down the first Schober government and lead to the installation of the Breisky government on January 26, 1922. = Personalities = The Christian Social Party being the plurality party, a coalition involving the Christian Socials would ordinarily have been led by Ignaz Seipel, their national chairman. In 1921, however, Seipel had declined to assume the chancellorship because of the difficult decisions and general hardship he knew still lay ahead; he had wanted someone else to do the dirty work. It had been Seipel's refusal that had made Schober chancellor for the first time in June 1921. Schober, career civil servant and long-time Vienna Chief of Police, enjoyed wide name recognition and was respected across party divides for his competence and effectiveness. He also enjoyed a reputation for personal integrity, an important point in a country sick of corruption and nepotism. Schober was known to be close to the pan-German cause but still considered nonpartisan. He had earned the trust of the Social Democrats during the transition from monarchy to republic in 1918, the trust of the political right through his energetic and proactive suppression of a planned Communist insurrection in 1919. Within hours of Schober's resignation on January 26, 1922, Christian Social representatives, and possibly politicians of other parties as well, began lobbying for Schober's return behind the scenes; it was widely felt that there simply was no alternative. Schober let himself be persuaded and was made chancellor for a second time the very next day.  Composition  The second Schober government consisted of the chancellor, the vice chancellor, and nine ministers. It featured the same peculiarities as the original Schober cabinet. The two bureaucrats leading the Ministry of Foreign Affair and the Ministry of Nutrition of the Population, respectively, were not actually ministers but merely \\"in charge of affairs\\" (\\"\\"), making them ministers for the purposes of cabinet meetings. The Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Education, historically independent but merged since the second Renner government, were not yet separated again, but in addition to the actual minister there was a state secretary () in charge of education affairs (). The original Schober government of June 1921 had been a \\"cabinet of civil servants\\" (\\"\\") and had included only three members with formal party affiliations: Walter Breisky and Carl Vaugoin as representatives of the Christian Socials, Leopold Waber as the sole representative of the Greater German People's Party. Vaugoin had been replaced by in independent in October 1921; Waber had departed the cabinet when the People's Party withdrew support from Schober and did not return now that the People's Party was grudgingly resuming support. The second Schober government thus included exactly one Christian Social and no Greater German at all. Department:  Office:  Officeholder:  Party: The minister of finance resigned on May 10; Schober took over from him:  Department:  Office:  Officeholder:  Party:  Activity  van Karnebeek at the 1922 Genoa Conference Schober's main concerns were still Austria's dire financial situation in general and its lack of creditworthiness in particular. The Treaty of Lana was an important first step in creating goodwill for the struggling country on the world stage, but there was a second problem. Article 197 of the Treaty of Saint-Germain stipulated that \\"[s]ubject to such exceptions as the Reparation Commission may make, the first charge upon all the assets and revenues of Austria shall be the cost of reparation and all other costs arising under the present Treaty\\". This so-called General Lien (\\"\\") meant that the Allies could confiscate any revenue Austria earned, from any sources, or any property Austria owned, at any time and with little notice. The article could in fact be read to imply that even property held by Austrian was subject to seizure. Austria was unable to secure any loans, in other words, because it was unable to offer up any collateral. The Austrian economy would not recover unless and until the Allies could be persuaded to grant \\"exceptions\\" to the General Lien, pursuant to the right to do so that they had reserved for themselves in Article 197. By 1922, the Austrian political classes were well aware of this fact. Luckily for Schober, the Allies were in the process of convening the Genoa Conference, a congress of some thirty nations meant to devise and formalize a comprehensive plan for the economic reconstruction of Europe, to be opened on April 10, 1922. The main topic of the conference was going to be the integration of the Soviet Union, still isolated and treated as a pariah by the international community in early 1922, into the international economic order. The Western powers demanded that the Soviet Union assume the heavy debts racked up by the Russian Empire it had replaced. When the Soviets objected that they could not afford to take on the Tsarist debt, the Western powers suggested that the Soviets extract the money necessary from Germany, by way of reparations payments. When the Soviet Union and Germany instead relinquished all claims against each other in the Treaty of Rapallo, the conference ended in failure. By the time the conference broke up, however, Schober and his minister of finance, Alfred G√ºrtler, had already extracted significant concessions. The General Lien was going to be suspended. France, the United Kingdom, and Italy would grant substantial loans.  Replacement  Reluctant support in the National Council nonwithstanding, the Greater German People's Party had never fully forgiven Schober for the Treaty of Lana. When Seipel decided that the time had come for him to take over, the Greater Germans happily agreed to help him into the saddle. While Schober was Schober was out of the country to participate in the Genoa Conference, the two parties found a pretext to withdraw confidence in the chancellor ‚Äì apparently Schober had technically overstepped his authority in connection with some minor fiscal matter. Schober learnt that he was in the process of being unseated again, and this time for good, during his return trip from the congress. Schober formally resigned on May 24; he agreed to stay on in a caretaker capacity until the first Seipel government could be sworn in on May 31.

Done in oil and graphite on canvas, the painting depicts the mythical figure Ariadne as she lays sleeping in an empty public square; this is in reference to the myth that birthed the character, in which Ariadne is abandoned on Naxos by her lover Theseus. According to sources provided by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, this reflects de Chirico's personal feelings of isolation after moving to Paris in 1911. The painting, currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was donated to the museum as part of the bequest of Florene Schoenborn in 1995.

His uncle, Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy, was commander of the French colonies in the Antilles from 1639 to 1651, then commander of the colonies of Saint Christophe, Saint Croix, Saint Barth√©lemy, and Saint Martin for the Knights of Malta. Longvilliers reestablished French control of the northern part of Saint Martin after the Spanish withdrew and the Dutch tried to take over the whole island. Family Robert de Longvilliers de Poincy was born in 1611. The Poincy family derived from Jean de Longvilliers, seigneur de Longvilliers, two leagues from Montreuil-sur-Mer, who founded the seigneury of Poincy in Brie near Meaux. His son, Jean II, captain of a company in the army, married Sophie de Choiseul on 18 November 1586. They had three children, Charlotte (born c. 1570), Christophe (born 1576) and Philippe (born 1584). Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy, the younger son, became a squadron commander, commander of the Order of Malta, and Lieutenant general of the French Antilles. He did not marry and died on Saint Christophe on 11 April 1860. The older son, Christophe de Longvilliers de Poincy, married Marie- Catherine de Joigny in 1608 and after 42 years of military service died in Poincy around 1636. He had five children. The first was Philippe, who became local governor of Saint Christophe and married Anne-Marie de Rossignal, daughter of one of the richest colonists of that island. The second was Robert, the subject of this article. The others were Charles, sieur de Tr√©val, Louise and Henri, sieur de B√©n√©vent. Saint Christophe (1639‚Äì48) 240px A treaty of 17 May 1627 had partitioned Saint Christopher Island. The English had the center part around Fort Charles and the French had the north part around Pointe de Sable (Sandy Point) and the south around Basseterre. Robert de Longvilliers came to Saint Christophe with his uncle Phillippe de Poincy in 1639. They sailed from France on 11 January 1639 on Le Petite Europe and arrived in Martinique on 11 February 1639, where the governor Jacques Dyel du Parquet promised his obedience. Poincy landed in Guadeloupe on 17 February 1639, where he met the governor Charles Li√©nard de L'Olive, then went on the Saint Christophe. There he found that his lieutenant Ren√© de B√©thoulat de La Grange-Fromenteau had not prepared a house for him, but had only looked after himself. Poincy bought the Grande Montagne property on Saint Christophe and at once subdivided it and sold about 20 lots between 1639 and 1640. He charged seigneurial rents of 1-10 pigs and 1-5 capons per year. The transactions were all done in the name of his nephew, Robert de Longvilliers, who also bought property for himself. Poincy was a quarrelsome man and a harsh authoritarian and earned many enemies. The company therefore decided to terminate his commission and look for a replacement. No√´l Patrocles de Thoisy was chosen as the governor general to replace Poincy. The company appointed Thoisy governor general on 26 December 1644. On 16 February 1645 the company arranged for a lettre de cachet from the king that ordered Poincy to return to France. Poincy's nephew, Robert de Longvilliers, who was ready to embark at La Rochelle, was handed the order to be delivered personally to Poincy. Poincy received the order to return on 13 March 1645. In July 1645 he expelled the intendant general, Clerselier de Leumont, who retired to Guadeloupe, and sent his most troublesome opponents back to France. In August 1645 the king issued another lettre de cachet in which he ordered Poincy to leave Saint Christophe. Robert de Longvilliers was confirmed as governor of Saint Christophe. On 1 September 1645 the assembly of lords of the company directed Robert de Longvilliers, governor of Saint Christophe, to receive No√´l Patrocles de Thoisy as the king's lieutenant general for the American islands. Thoisy left Le Havre on 16 September 1645, reached Martinique on 16 November and on 23 November was off Saint Christophe, but neither Poincy or the English governor would recognise him. In January 1646 Thoisy, with the support of Governor Jacques Dyel du Parquet of Martinique, led an expedition against Poincy and captured Poincy's two nephews (Longvilliers and Tr√©val). Poincy's forces, supported by militia provided by the English governor Thomas Warner, then defeated the company from Martinique at the cost of 60 deaths. Du Parquet was taken prisoner. Thoisy escaped to Guadeloupe. On 16 and 28 October 1646 the king ordered Poincy and Thoisy to exchange prisoners, thus implicitly giving Poincy an amnesty for his revolt since he was opposed to the company and its abuses rather than opposed to the king. On 17 January 1647 Thoisy was arrested by the people of Martinique and delivered to Poincy in exchange for Du Parquet. Thoisy was taken to Saint Christophe, where he arrived on 24 January 1846. While passing Guadeloupe La Vernade embarked one of Poincy's nephews, Longvilliers, against the promise that Du Parquet would be released. The other nephew, Charles de Tr√©val, remained as a hostage. Thoisy was held prisoner in Saint Christopher, but due to expressions of sympathy for him by the population Poincy embarked him for France at night at the end of April, where he arrived on 17 May 1646. At the start of 1647 Robert de Longvilliers held the title of governor for the king of Saint Martin and was commander of Saint Christophe in the absence of his uncle. He held an assembly at the Anse of Louvet in which he consented to the establishment of a number of Carmelite monks from the province of Touraine. They could celebrate services and administer the sacrament in Cabesterre (northwest region) and Anse √† Louvet (extreme west). The Carmelites began to build a chapel and monastery at Anse- √†-Louvet on 10 June 1649. With the agreement of Poincy and Longvilliers another establishment was built by the settlers at Anse-des-Ouignes for the monks from Touraine. Saint Martin (1648‚Äì51) 240px The Spanish under the Marquis of Cadereyta drove the French and Dutch settlers from Saint Martin in 1633. In June 1647 they evacuated the Spanish garrison. Early in 1648 they returned with some French and Dutch laborers to destroy the fort and other structures on the island. Five of the Dutch, four of the French and one mulatto escaped and hid until the Spanish had left. The Dutch made a makeshift raft on which they reached Sint Eustatius and told the governor Abraham Adriensen of what had happened. He sent a small group of Dutch settled to take possession on the island. The French got word to Poincy, who sent 30 men, but they were turned back by the Dutch. Poincy then sent 300 men under Robert de Lonvilliers, governor of Saint Christophe, who landed without meeting resistance. The French and Dutch ratified a treaty on 22 March 1648 on a hill that became called the \\"Mont des Accords\\". The Treaty of Concordia was signed by the two governors of the island, Robert de Longvilliers for France and Martin Thomas for the States General of the Netherlands. The French would keep the area they occupied and the coast facing Anguilla, while the Dutch would have the area of the fort and the land around it on the south coast. The inhabitants would share the natural resources of the island. Robert de Lonvilliers was governor of Saint Martin from 1648 to 1651. There had been no French governor on the island since 1633, when Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc left. He was replaced on Saint Martin in 1651 by his uncle, Philippe de Poincy. Saint Christophe (1651‚Äì66) Robert de Lonvilliers married Ren√©e Giraud, daughter of the first captain of Saint Christophe in Saint Christophe on 1 August 1649. They had three children, Philippe (born 1652), Constance and Catherine Marie. After Poincy died in 1660 the Order, which had still not paid all the purchase money, appointed Charles de Sales the new governor. The Second Anglo-Dutch War formally began in March 1665. In January 1666, with a growing threat of war between France and England, Sales made a treaty with Governor William Watts of the English part of the island under which they agreed that when one party heard that war had been declared they would notify the other, and they would delay for three days before launching an attack. However, hostilities between the French and English on Saint Christopher broke out before the official declaration of war was received. Robert de Lonvilliers was killed at Pointe Sable on 1 April 1666 at the age of 55.

It has also been covered by other artists, including Linda Ronstadt, Robin Zander and Rita Coolidge. Coolidge's version was released as a single and was a minor hit in Canada. Lyrics and music \\"I Believe in You\\" is a slow love song. Music critic Johnny Rogan describes it as being the closest Young came to writing an MOR ballad during this phase of his career. Rogan described the arrangement as being \\"sparse.\\" To Allmusic critic Denise Sullivan, the \\"restraint\\" of Young's piano melody as well as the rest of the instrumentation adds to the song's poignancy. Music author Nigel Williamson describes \\"I Believe in You\\" as being the song on After the Gold Rush which best fits the \\"confessional singer-songwriter mode,\\" suggesting that it is similar to some James Taylor songs. Sam Inglis regards it as one of the best of Young's songs in which he tries to rationalize his behavior to women he has left. Although the title of the song seems to be positive, the lyrics suggest that he is unsure of his ability to love and reluctant to enter the new relationship. Ken Bielen describes the dilemma of the song as being \\"a matter of trust\\" and that the singer isn't even sure where love fits into his life. In an interview with Spin Magazine Young stated: > What am I talking about? \\"Now that you've made yourself love me do you think > I can change it in a day?\\" That's a heavy one. That song has the most > haunting lyrics. \\"Am I lying to you when I say I believe you?\\" That's the > difference between the song and the poem. The song makes you think of the > hook and the hook is \\"I believe in you,\\" but the rest of it is in a whole > other place. On the other hand, Sullivan finds some of the lyrics to be reassuring to the woman he is addressing, such as the line \\"Now that you found yourself losing your mind are you here again?\\" Neil Young version \\"I Believe in You\\" was one of the first songs recorded for After the Gold Rush. It was one of two songs from the album that Young was able to finish recording with Crazy Horse during the 1969 sessions at Sunset Sound in Hollywood, CA. \\"I Believe in You\\" was later included on Young's 1975 compilation album Decade. Cover versions Rita Coolidge released a cover version of \\"I Believe in You\\" for her self-titled debut album in 1971. Rogan described Coolidge's version as being more \\"sultry\\" than Young's. Coolidge also released it as a single, which was unsuccessful in the U.S. but charted at No. 38 in Canada. It also reached No. 16 on Canada's Adult Contemporary chart. Linda Ronstadt covered it on her 1973 album Don't Cry Now. Robin Zander covered the song on his 1993 self- titled album. Allmusic critic Tom Demalon described it as a \\"tasty cover.\\" Fellow Allmusic critic Sullivan praised Zander's vocals but criticized the synthesizers and \\"cold\\" drum sounds on his version.

He is accused of killing four women, all sex workers, in September 2018. He was caught and arrested after a woman escaped and alerted police. Personal life Ortiz was a member of the United States Border Patrol for ten years, where he worked as an intelligence operator. He is also a United States Navy veteran. He had no reported disciplinary issues while he served. He was married and had three children. He earned a bachelor's degree from American Military University and a master's degree from St. Mary's University in Texas. The Sheriff's Chief Deputy said Ortiz planned to commit suicide by cop, stocking up on weapons and trying to goad police with his phone when arrested. In the hours before his arrest, he posted two goodbyes to people he knew on Facebook. Arrest On September 15, 2018, a woman who knew Ortiz and a sex worker named Melissa Ramirez, who had disappeared while allegedly in Ortiz's company, got into his vehicle according to reports. After talking to Ortiz about her friend, Ortiz allegedly pulled out a firearm and tore off her shirt. The women escaped by jumping out of the truck and then found a state trooper nearby refuelling their car, to whom the victim reported the incident. At 2:30 a.m. the next day Ortiz was arrested by Texas police in a hotel parking lot where he was allegedly hiding. Victims Ortiz has confessed to and is suspected of the following homicides: :Melissa Ramirez, 29, killed on 3 September 2018 :Claudine Anne Luera, 42, killed on 13 September 2018 :Griselda Alicia Hernandez Cantu, 35, killed on 15 September 2018 :Humberto \\" Janelle\\" Enriquez Ortiz, 28, killed on 15 September 2018 He is also suspected of kidnapping a woman. The five victims were sex workers, all women, one transgender. Ortiz confessed after his arrest that he had started killing on September 3 and that he personally knew the first two victims. He allegedly killed the other two on the morning of September 15 in the five hours between the assault on the escaped woman and his capture. Ortiz confessed to picking up a mother of two named Melissa Ramirez on September 3. She was 29 years old. After driving down a rural county road in Webb County, two miles outside the city, Ramirez got out of the vehicle to urinate, when Ortiz says he shot her multiple times. Her body was discovered the next day. Ten days later, Ortiz allegedly picked up 42-year-old Claudine Anne Luera, a mother of five. After she confronted him about the disappearance of her friend Ramirez, she got out of his vehicle when he shot her in the head. She was found alive and died hours later in the hospital. The last two victims were found on a five-mile stretch of Highway 35. Ortiz confessed to investigators that he took them in two trips from Laredo and killed them in similar manners. He led police to the site of the crime. Unlike Ramirez and Luera, he had no prior contact with these victims. Aftermath Ortiz has been charged by the Webb County court with four counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and was later indicted on one count of capital murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, unlawful restraint and evading arrest. Ortiz has confessed to the four murders and fifth attempted murder to investigators, and allegedly has led investigators to one of the bodies. During interviews with investigators, Ortiz reportedly expressed a hatred of prostitutes. Investigators have stated that they have not ruled out the possibility that Ortiz had additional victims. In January 2019 Ortiz pleaded not guilty on four counts of murder and one count of assault, despite giving a taped confession to investigators. References External links *Juan D.

The resulting trial was one of the most notorious in Victorian Ireland. Early life William Bourke Kirwan was born in Dublin in 1814 into an artistic family. He studied art under the portrait painter Richard Downes Bowyer, and exhibited various pieces of art at the Royal Hibernian Academy in the 1830s and 1840s. He later worked as an engraver, picture cleaner, and anatomical draughtsman. He married Sarah Maria Louisa Crowe (1824-1852), and they resided together on Merrion Street in Dublin. They had no children. Murder and Aftermath Portrait of Sarah Maria Louisa Kirwan, ca. 1845The couple went on an outing to the small island of Ireland's Eye, off the coast of Dublin, on September 6, 1852. Kirwan claimed not to be able to find his wife after she had swam while he sketched. Her body was later found on a rock on the island, covered in blood. While at first it was believed that she had died in an accidental drowning, a later exhumation and autopsy showed signs of manual asphyxiation. Kirwan's subsequent arrest and trial caused a media sensation across the United Kingdom. The trial, which took place in Dublin's Green Street courthouse in December 1852, attracted large crowds. Kirwan‚Äôs defence was headed by the noted barrister and MP Isaac Butt. Kirwan had long maintained a separate home in Sandymount with his mistress, Maria Teresa Kenny and their eight children, which was presented as a motive for him to murder his wife. Kirwan was found guilty and sentenced to death, but this was commuted to life imprisonment and transportation after appeals by reputable citizens, including ten doctors who stated that his wife's death was consistent with drowning. He was freed in 1879, and may have emigrated to the United States.Ireland‚Äôs Eye sees notorious murder. By Dan MacCarthy. Irish Examiner.

It is notable as the site for the first arc-welded gasholder in the world. History In 1856 the first gas supply had been instigated in Melbourne, Australia, with the construction of the West Melbourne Gasworks. In the same year, residents of the Fitzroy Ward of the Corporation of Melbourne met at Clarke's Hotel, Smith Street, for the purpose of considering on the best means of obtaining a supply of gas within the ward.R Proudley. Circle of Influence: A History of the Gas Industry in Victoria, Hargreen/Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria, Melbourne, 1987. p. 40-49. Public concern that the City of Melbourne Gas and Coke Company monopoly resulted in excessive price for gas led to the establishment of several local gas companies, the first of which was the Collingwood, Fitzroy and District Gas and Coke Company formed in 1859. The company supplied gas to an area within a six mile radius of the works, which were erected on Reilly Street (now Alexandra Parade), North Fitzroy in 1861. The original part of the works was on the north side of Alexandra Parade and West of Smith Street, was designed by engineer William Elsdon.Obituary: William Elsdon, 1830‚Äì1904, Minutes of the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Volume 125, Issue 1904, pages 427‚Äì8, Thomas Telford-ICE Virtual Library The works was extended across Gore Street to the west as far as George Street. Opposite the works was the Gasometer Hotel.‚ÄòHalf-Drowned or Half-Baked Essays in the History of North Fitzroy‚Äô, proceedings of a seminar at North Fitzroy, 3 December 2017 editor: Miles Lewis, Fitzroy History Society, The company amalgamated with the Melbourne and South Melbourne companies in 1878 to form the Metropolitan Gas Company, and the gasworks were known as the Fitzroy Station. The Fitzroy works was not as profitable as the other Metropolitan company's plants as so gas production was gradually reduced and the site redeveloped to accommodate the company's construction workshops and gas storage. The only riveted gasholder erected by the Metropolitan Gas Company was built at Fitzroy in 1919. The Chief engineer Joseph Newell Reeson undertook a number of experiments with gas manufacture, including the application of electric arc welding to fabrication of large structures, and was responsible for the first arc welded large steel structure in the world, the No 3 gasholder, completed in 1923.The Metrogram: The Staff Journal of the Metropolitan Gas Company, no. 17, December 1939. p. 15.

(2008) Experimental Philosophy of Science // Philosophy Compass, 3 (3):507-721. Education and career Stotz was born in Neum√ºnster in Schleswig-Holstein. She received her Magister Artium in Biology and Social Sciences (Anthropology) in 1993 (University of Mainz) and her PhD in Philosophy from the University of Ghent, Belgium, in 1999 under the supervision of Gertrudis Van de Vijver and Werner Callebaut. In the period between 1999-2007 she worked at different universities of Australia and the United States of America. From 2008 until 2013, Stotz was Australian Research Fellow and, later, Bridging Support Fellow at the Department of Philosophy, University of Sydney. In 2014 she received the position of Senior Lecturer at the Department of Philosophy, Macquarie University, Australia. From 2014 to 2017, with her partner Paul Griffiths, Stotz worked on a Templeton World Charity Foundation project entitled: \\"Causal Foundations of Biological Information\\".https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects/causal- foundations-of-biological-information#project-details Non-genetic inheritance and the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis In different papers Stotz argues for an Extended Evolutionary Synthesis through the inclusion of non-genetic (extended, exogenetic) inheritance mechanisms and processes in the explanation of evolution. According to Stotz, the Modern Evolutionary Synthesis should go beyond the antinomy of biological vs cultural and revise more inclusive theories of gene-culture coevolution and niche construction. Such a revised theory of evolution should take into account genetic, epigenetic (molecular and cellular), behavioral, ecological, socio-cultural and cognitive-symbolic legacies.Stotz, K. (2014) Extended evolutionary psychology: the importance of transgenerational developmental plasticity // Frontiers in Psychology 5: 908. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00908 Stotz argues that: \\"Environments, particularly in the form of developmental environments, do not just select for variation, they also create new variation by influencing development through the liable transmission of non-genetic but heritable information.\\"Stotz, K.

P.2 Developmental Niche Construction Stotz introduced the concept of Developmental Niche Construction as an integrative framework for the study of various non-genetic (exogenetic) inheritance mechanisms and for an explanation of how the environment (physical, biological or social) can construct new heritable variations during individual development. This concept originated in the idea of the ‚Äòontogenetic niche‚Äô introduced in 1987 by developmental psychobiologists Meredith West and Andrew King,West, M. J., King, A. P. (1987). Settling nature and nurture into an ontogenetic niche // Developmental Psychobiology: The Journal of the International Society for Developmental Psychobiology, 20(5): 549-562. and theory of 'niche construction' presented by biologist John Odling-Smee in 1988.Odling-Smee F. J. (1988). Niche- constructing phenotypes. In H. C. Plotkin (Ed.), The role of behavior in evolution (pp. 73-132). Cambridge, MA, US: The MIT Press.

(2010) Human Nature and Cognitive-Developmental Niche construction // Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences 9 (4): 483-501. Extended Evolutionary Psychology According to Stotz, there is a natural afÔ¨Ånity between the theoretical view of the nature of the mind and an understanding of how the mind developed and evolved. \\"Which kind of evolutionary theory you apply matters deeply to which kind of (evolutionary) psychology you get.\\"Stotz, K.

P.2 For example, the ideas of nativist's evolutionary psychologists are often based on the Modern Evolutionary Synthesis which explains the origin of behavioral, social and cognitive capacities by the sudden appearance of genetically determined mental modules or representational systems. As an alternative, Stotz proposes an Extended Evolutionary Psychology based on ideas of an Extended Evolutionary synthesis, Developmental Systems Theory, and embodied, embedded, enacted and extended models of cognition. She states that these approaches are a more appropriate alternative to traditional cognitivism and methodological individualism because they emphasise the importance of external scaffolding of cognition through developmental, ecological, cognitive and cultural niche construction.Stotz, K.

Some examples of this include predator‚Äìprey interactions, host‚Äìpathogen interactions, and brood parasitism. In exploitative interactions, the enemy and the victim may often coevolve with each other. How exactly they coevolve depends on many factors, such as population density. One evolutionary consequence of exploitative interactions is antagonistic coevolution. This can occur because of resistance, where the victim attempts to decrease the number of successful attacks by the enemy, which encourages the enemy to evolve in response, thus resulting in a coevolutionary arms race. On the other hand, toleration, where the victim attempts to decrease the effect on fitness that successful enemy attacks have, may also evolve. Exploitative interactions can have significant biological effects. For example, exploitative interactions between a predator and prey can result in the extinction of the victim (the prey, in this case), as the predator, by definition, kills the prey, and thus reduces its population. Another effect of these interactions is in the coevolutionary \\"hot\\" and \\"cold spots\\" put forth by geographic mosaic theory. In this case, coevolution caused by resistance would create \\"hot spots\\" of coevolutionary activity in an otherwise uniform environment, whereas \\"cold spots\\" would be created by the evolution of tolerance, which generally does not create a coevolutionary arms race.

Proposed in 2001, the TN model suggests increased stress sensitivity observed among individuals experiencing psychotic symptoms may be attributed to trauma-induced neurodevelopmental changes during key developmental periods. Proposed as a partial explanation for the association between childhood adversity and psychosis, the TN model suggests observed increases in stress reactivity among individuals diagnosed with psychotic disorders may be attributed to trauma- induced neurological changes during sensitive developmental periods. As a result, the TN model underscores the importance of routine comprehensive assessments of childhood trauma histories when evaluating individuals presenting with psychotic symptoms for mental health services.  Background  At the time of its original publication, the TN model suggested traumatic events experienced in early life may facilitate neurodevelopmental changes responsible for the increased stress sensitivity observed among individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia. This contrasted the popular Diathesis-Stress Model of Schizophrenia, which suggested the disorder results from the interaction of predisposed individual vulnerability and external stressors. Although both models have a biopsychosocial framework, they differ in the emphases placed on each component (i.e., biological, psychological and social factors). While authors of the TN model acknowledged the diathesis-stress model does account for situational and interpersonal stressors, they argued that research aimed at testing the model rarely investigated psychosocial explanations, lending to an overemphasis of the biological component of the model. Thus, at the time in which the TN model was proposed, diatheses contributing to the onset of schizophrenia were principally presumed to be heritable vulnerabilities. This resulted in stress (as a component of the conceptualization of psychosis) often being relegated to a natural consequence of the illness rather than its cause per se. The TN model proposed a more integrative approach to biopsychosocial formulations of schizophrenia that are consistent with multifactorial etiological models. Although the original TN model specifically focused on the relationship between early traumatic events and schizophrenia symptoms it has since expanded to include all psychosis and psychotic disorders. Since its proposal, research of links between childhood trauma and psychosis has proliferated, resulting in numerous studies (using both human subjects and animal-models) providing both direct and indirect support of the TN model. Importantly, while the TN model suggests the psychological sequelae of childhood trauma may initiate neurodevelopmental changes resulting in psychopathology, it is not indicative of brain disease. This is a marked contrast from previous popular beliefs that the biological etiology of psychosis rendered it largely irreversible and untreatable, aside from pharmacotherapy-based symptom management. This model also reveals important clinical implications in the primary prevention of psychosis. Proponents of the TN model of psychosis suggest that targeting populations at- risk for experiencing childhood trauma with prevention-focused interventions would lead to profound decreases in the incidence of psychosis. Similarly, the TN model has also emphasized promotion of childhood trauma screening among individuals presenting with psychotic symptoms, as it can help to inform and adapt evidence-based trauma-informed therapeutic interventions aimed at addressing the specific needs of individual clients.  Overview  The central hypothesis of the TN model suggests that for some individuals experiencing psychosis, heightened sensitivity to stress may be mediated by childhood trauma. Alterations in increased stress reactivity are expected to manifest as dysregulation of physiological mechanisms responsible for maintaining adaptive stress responses (i.e., allostasis). This is supported by evidence of analogous irregularities in stress reactivity among individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and children who have experienced trauma. More specifically, both individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and traumatized children exhibit hyperresponsivity of the hypothalamic-adrenal-pituitary (HPA) axis, which when activated results in a concomitant hormone cascade that regulates the physiological stress response. In addition to abnormal endocrine stress responses, neurotransmitter abnormalities are also observed among both individuals experiencing psychosis and those with a history of childhood trauma. For example, alterations are observed in dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) receptor expression, in addition to increased catecholamine (epinephrine, norepinephrine and DA) synthesis. Further, many similarities in structural brain changes are also observed among these groups (e.g., hippocampal damage, enlarged ventricles, cerebral atrophy and asymmetry). Criticisms A criticism of the TN model is that most individuals who experience childhood trauma do not develop psychotic symptoms. Many survivors of childhood trauma recover without persistent adverse effects. Further, childhood trauma is a known predictor of both medical and psychological disorders, many of which often co-occur with psychosis. Whether childhood trauma is robustly linked to a specific diagnosis relative to others remains to be elucidated. Despite this ambiguity in its strength as a predictor, the relationship between childhood trauma and psychosis is remains significant even after controlling for psychological comorbidities. Though equifinality may seem counter-intuitive, it is consistent with multifactorial etiological conceptualizations of psychosis to which the TN model is compatible. Similarly, not all individuals presenting with psychotic symptoms have experienced childhood trauma. As noted, childhood trauma is associated with many deleterious psychological outcomes, including affect, substance use, and personality disorders. The multifinality of trauma may be explained by moderating variables such as type, frequency, duration, severity, and/or age at time of trauma. In addition to being dose-dependent, the effect of trauma has also been shown to be cumulative, in which multiple traumatic experiences can aggregate, enhancing downstream adverse consequences. Protective factors, such as social support and resiliency, have been shown to ameliorate the effects of trauma, thereby altering its potential long-term outcome. Trauma by itself is neither required nor independently capable of inducing psychotic symptoms. Though viewed as a criticism of the TN model, this lack of specificity has been cited by proponents as having important theoretical implications. While the TN model may not suggest trauma is necessary for the development of psychotic disorders, research supporting this model opposes previous paradigms that the etiology of psychosis is purely biological in origin. Rather, the TN model suggests psychosis may be as influenced by psychosocial factors as other mental health illnesses (e.g., major depression) with the strength of the relationship varying across individuals and life experiences. This supports integrative multifactorial models and transdiagnostic approaches in the investigation of the etiology of psychosis, suggesting significantly more research investigating psychosocial influences in the relationship between trauma and psychosis should be conducted.

Before the war, the Oversteegen family harbored people from Lithuania in the hold of their ship, hidden. After the divorce of her parents, Oversteegen was raised by her mother, who taught her communist principles. She moved from the barge to a small apartment. Oversteegen's mother would later remarry and give birth to her half-brother. The family lived in poverty. World War II During the war, the Oversteegen family hid a Jewish couple in their home. Freddie Oversteegen and her older sister Truus began handing out anti-Nazi pamphlets, which attracted the notice of Haarlem Council of Resistance commander Frans van der Wiel. With their mother's permission, the girls joined the Council of Resistance, which brought them into a coordinated effort. Freddie was fourteen years old at the time. Oversteegen, her sister, and friend Hannie Schaft worked to sabotage the Nazi military presence in the Netherlands. They used dynamite to disable bridges and railroad tracks. Additionally, they aided Jewish children by smuggling them out of the country or helping them escape concentration camps. The Oversteegens and Schaft also killed German soldiers, with Freddie being the first of the girls to kill a soldier by shooting them while riding her bicycle. They also lured soldiers to the woods under the pretense of a romantic overture and then killed them. Oversteegen would approach the soldiers in taverns and bars and ask them to \\"go for a stroll\\" in the forest. Post-war Oversteegen served as a board member on the National Hannie Schaft Foundation, which was established by her sister, Truus. In 2014, Freddie and Truus were awarded the Mobilisation War Cross (Mobilisatie-Oorlogskruis) by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte for their acts of resistance during the war.

Settlement began around 1718 with the establishment of a trading post by the British on the Congaree River. Many small farms were settled by German, Swiss, and Scots-Irish immigrants. Granby was the largest town and county seat of Lexington County until the early 19th century, when the town began to gradually decline as Columbia, the state capital, grew. The once thriving colonial town was mostly unoccupied after the first quarter of the 19th century. Today, the area is part of present-day Cayce. Settlement The site was first used because it is located just downstream from the rapids and junction on the Congaree where the Broad River and Saluda River merge to form the Congaree, beyond which river transportation was difficult. Granby developed on the west shore of the Congaree. The area was also referred to as \\"the Congaree's lands\\", and later \\"the Congarees\\" after the Congaree Indians, who had been decimated by smallpox and conflict. The survivors moved farther inland after the Yamasee War of 1715. A 1716 agreement between the British and the Cherokee called for a trading post to be built there for the convenience of the Cherokee who otherwise traveled to Charleston. The British trading post was called Ft. Congaree and existed from 1718 to 1722. The first town in the area, Saxe Gotha, was laid out in 1733 as 70 square parcels. Saxe-Gotha failed primarily due to frequent flooding and Granby was then plotted on slightly higher ground just south in the 1750s. In 1748, a second post was built more to the east to accommodate the Catawaba Indians, who by that time had absorbed the remaining Congaree. This post/fort became a refuge for white settlers during the Anglo-Cherokee War. Many early settlers came directly from Germany or Switzerland, or relocated from Pennsylvania (the Pennsylvania Dutch) and Virginia. The town had many successful small farms, producing corn, wheat, tobacco, hemp, flax, beeswax, and livestock. The Cherokee Indian War of 1760 and the subsequent War of the Regulation did not impede growth and prosperity of the area. The first public ferry across the river began in 1754, operated by Martin Friday (originally Fridig), an immigrant from Z√ºrich. A trading post was founded by James Chesnut and Joseph Kershaw in 1765. It was known as the \\"Congaree Store\\" and became one of the first important trading posts in the interior of the colony. It was used to store cotton and other products to be shipped by boat to coastal towns. American Revolution After Charleston fell to the British on May 12, 1780, the British began a campaign to take control of the entire state and Lord Cornwallis seized the Congaree Store. It was fortified with trenches, earthworks, and a magazine, and surrounded by a timber stockade and watchtowers. Fort Granby or \\"the post at the Congarees\\" (the British name) became a British stronghold in the state and was defended by over 300 British soldiers and Hessians. Cornwallis named the post after John Manners, Marquess of Granby, the Commander-in-Chief of the British army. The fort was ineffectively attacked by a small rebel force led by Brigadier General Thomas Sumter on February 19, 1781. The next day Sumter tried again with a Quaker gun and was again unsuccessful. On the 21st, a superior army under the command of Lord Francis Rawdon arrived from Camden on the eastern side of the river and Sumter abandoned the siege. Before retreating, he was able to ignite the magazine and destroy other provisions. Sumter returned in May with a six-pound cannon requisitioned from the Continental Army at Fort Motte. Sumter attacked nearby Orangeburg while the main force, now led by Lt. Colonel Henry Lee III, began a siege of Fort Granby. The fort was under the command of Loyalist Major Andrew Maxwell, who had stored significant plunder at the fort. Upon being attacked by infantry musket fire supported by one six-pound cannon, Maxwell agreed to surrender the fort and its 352 defenders if he was allowed to keep two wagon loads of \\"personal loot\\". The captured men, which included sixty German dragoons, were exchanged in Charleston for Patriot prisoners of war. Post war era After the war, Lexington county (named in honor of the Battle of Lexington) was formed in 1785 from the area previously known as Saxe-Gotha Township and Granby Township, and Granby became the capital. The county courthouse was built there. Friday's Ferry was purchased by Richard and Wade Hampton in 1785. Wade Hampton replaced the ferry with an unusual river bridge built of wood and iron with an arch exceeding , and had legislative authority to collect tolls for 100 years. In the early 1800s Granby was still much larger than Columbia with a post office, large stores and other buildings of commerce. It was reported in 1802 to have nearly 200 houses, twice as many as Columbia. As land upriver was cleared for cotton farming, Granby became prone to flooding and the county seat was relocated in 1818 to Lexington. Meanwhile, Columbia, on the opposite side of the river, was made South Carolina's capital in 1786 spurring its growth and the further decline of Granby. Many of Granby's residents relocated to Columbia. Many of the building were also moved there. By 1822, the town was nearly deserted. The county courthouse was moved to Columbia where it served as a Presbyterian church for over forty years. (Another source says the building was torn down and its lumber was used to build the church.) Granby remained mostly uninhabited until the Civil War, when an earthen fortification erected there by the Confederates was attacked in the 1864 Battle of Congaree Creek. Growth led to incorporation of the new and much larger town of Cayce in 1914, which included the former Granby townsite. The area was resettled in 1960 when the Riverside Park area of the city of Cayce was built. Archaeological project A volunteer research project named \\"Finding Granby\\" has been active at the site in the 2010s. Over 15,000 artifacts have been unearthed. Legacy Granby Cotton Mill The original trading post and later fort was purchased in 1817 by the Cayce (originally Cacey) family who used it as a residence for almost 100 years. A replica of the building now serves as the Cayce Historical Museum. A granite commemorative marker was installed at the Granby cemetery in 1929 by \\"The South Carolina society, Colonial Dames of America\\". Since the cemetery is inaccessible to the public as it is surrounded by private property, the marker was moved in 2012 to the Cayce Riverwalk, a walking and jogging trail along the river. The Granby name has been given to a nearby park, on the opposite side of the river, in Columbia and the Granby Mill Village Historic District also in Columbia which includes an 1897 cotton mill and surrounding community. An archaeological site including the 1718 and 1748 trading posts was designated the Congarees and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. John Taylor, the 51st Governor of South Carolina, was born on May 4, 1770 in Granby.

The Neptune Herring Oil Factory () is a former industry in the town of Melbu in Norway's Vester√•len district. It has been given cultural heritage status. The factory was set up in 1910. For a long time, production was based on herring. When herring was no longer available as raw material, the factory switched to using capelin. In the 1980s, the supply of this fish as raw material also failed, and the factory shut down in 1987. All of its equipment was sold to Morocco. During the 1900s there were many factories of this type in the Norwegian fisheries, and few of them are preserved today. Many of them, like the Neptune factory, were established at the beginning of the century and were shut down in the 1980s. The Neptune Herring Oil Factory was added to the list of priority technical and industrial cultural heritage by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage. This list comprises several facilities of different types, and it is based on extensive registration work. The conservation of the factory in Melbu focuses on preserving herring oil factories. Starting in 1991, the buildings were managed as part of the Norwegian Fishing Industry Museum, which was established in the spring of 1991.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004.  History  Cockatoo Island became a gaol in 1839, following advice by New South Wales Governor George Gipps to the British Secretary of State for the Colonies that convicts would be sent to the island after the closure of the Norfolk Island convict establishment. The Prison Barracks Precinct was built over the next few years, the buildings being able to be occupied from October 1841. Quarrying of grain silos at Biloela House and the Underground Grain Silos was one of the early convict tasks. In order to service Royal Navy ships, the Fitzroy Dock was built on the island and completed in 1857. Cockatoo became the major government dockyard in Australia. In 1869 prisoners were transferred from the island to Darlinghurst, and the prison buildings became an industrial school for girls and a reformatory in 1871. The dockyard area was now separated from the institution by a fence. Following the departure of the girls in 1888, prisoners were again sent to the island, and the gaol function continued until about 1909. Meanwhile, the dockyard function expanded, and the Sutherland Dock was built in 1890. The New South Wales Public Works Department declared Cockatoo the state dockyard. After Federation, in 1913 Cockatoo became the Commonwealth Dockyard, and the island, both through shipbuilding and servicing, played an important role both in the development of the Royal Australian Navy and during the First World War. The former prison buildings were now used for office purposes. From 1933 the dockyard was leased from the Australian Government by Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Co Ltd and the island played a very significant role during the Second World War. After the war, now known as Vickers, the dockyard continued, and submarine facilities were introduced. The dockyard closed in 1992, and there was some demolition. Sale of the island was proposed. The island is now vested in the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. The convict barracks block was erected c.1839-42. It was designed by the Commanding Royal Engineer Colonel George Barney, who played a notable role in the colony. The building included hospital wards, a cookhouse and mess shed. Due to overcrowding a second storey was proposed in 1849, but was not proceeded with. Various extensions were added (a latrine and office block formed infill when built later). The barracks was later used by the Industrial School, and by prisoners again in 1888. Following the Commonwealth's takeover, the building was used as offices. The barracks and the other convict-era buildings form the only remaining imperial-funded (as opposed to colonial-funded) convict public works complex in NSW and form one of the most complete groups of convict structures in Australia.  Description  The Convict Barracks Block is a part of Prison Barracks Precinct, Cockatoo Island, Sydney Harbour. The barracks is a single storey sandstone building, built in a rare U-shape, and with an enclosed court. The building includes former hospital wards, a cookhouse and mess shed, plus other later additions. The roof (variously corrugated iron, fibro and concrete) is pitched and the building has a verandah. During the Second World War two wards in the building were converted to air raid shelters. Various other modifications were made at other times. The style is Old Colonial Georgian. = Condition = The barracks has been modified for different uses at different times during its history. During the Second World War particularly destructive alterations were made. Some inappropriate materials remain, though in the 1990s a new roof was fitted, and other repairs and painting work was completed. Some decay of the stonework was noted in the 1997 Conservation Management Plan.  Heritage listing  The Convict Barracks Block was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes The convict barracks block, completed in the early 1840s, is historically highly significant for its association with early convict administration in the Australian colonies. It is also associated with the other phases of Cockatoo Island's history, as an industrial school and as a major shipyard. Criterion B: Rarity The block is part of a group of convict buildings which is the only remaining imperial convict public works complex in NSW, and is important as a rare example of a convict barracks block of the period. Criterion D: Characteristic values The block is part of one of the most complete groups of convict structures in Australia and is important as a rare example of a convict barracks block of the period. Criterion H: Significant people The block was designed by Colonel George Barney, who as Commanding Royal Engineer played a notable role in the colony.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004.  History  Cockatoo Island became a gaol in 1839, following advice by New South Wales Governor George Gipps to the British Secretary of State for the Colonies that convicts would be sent to the island after the closure of the Norfolk Island convict establishment. The convict precinct (see also Cockatoo Island Prison Barracks Precinct, 1951, 1953 and 1859) was built over the next few years, the buildings beginning to be occupied from October 1841. Quarrying of grain silos (Biloela House and Underground Grain Silos) was one of the early convict tasks. In order to service Royal Navy ships, the Fitzroy Dock was built on the island and completed in 1857. Cockatoo became the major government dockyard in Australia. In 1869 prisoners were transferred from the island to Darlinghurst, and the prison buildings became an industrial school for girls and a reformatory in 1871. The dockyard area was now separated from this institutional area on the top of the island by a fence. Following the departure of the girls in 1888, prisoners were again sent to the island, and the gaol function continued until about 1909. Meanwhile, the dockyard function expanded, and the Sutherland Dock was built in 1890. The NSW Public Works Department declared Cockatoo the state dockyard. After Federation, in 1913 Cockatoo became the Commonwealth Dockyard, and the island, both through ship-building and servicing, played an important role both in the development of the Royal Australian Navy and during the First World War. The former prison buildings were now used for office purposes. From 1933 the dockyard was leased from the Australian Government by Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Co Ltd and the island played a very significant role during the Second World War. After the war, now known as Vickers, the dockyard continued, and submarine facilities were introduced. The dockyard closed in 1992, and there was some demolition. Sale of the island was proposed. The island is now vested in the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. The military guard room, with detached kitchen and toilet, was erected in 1842, and a cell block (later demolished) was completed three years later. The buildings were designed by the Commanding Royal Engineer, Colonel George Barney, who played a notable role in the colony. During the female institution phase, the guard room was used as a sewing room, then as a store and office. After the females' departure, the room became offices and accommodation for the resident engineer, before a new wing was added and the building reverted to prison purposes. After Commonwealth assumption of control, the room was used as a residence by the 1920s. After the Second World War the buildings' roofs were removed; stone was also cannibalised for use elsewhere on the island. In 1980 parts of the room were removed and the walls were topped with cement render. The guard room and the other convict-era buildings form the only remaining imperial-funded (as opposed to colonial) convict public works complex in New South Wales and form one of the most complete groups of convict structures in Australia.  Description  Military Guard Room is a part of the Prison Barracks Precinct, Cockatoo Island, Sydney Harbour. The guard room is single storey, rectangular, and built of sandstone blocks, with a separate kitchen. The style is Old Colonial Georgian. Both buildings are roofless. Window and door openings are rectangular. The walls finish at the roof line with stone slab eaves. Inside, the guardroom features iron wall-rods which would have supported timber boards upon which rifles were laid. Underneath are iron hat- pegs. There is also a reconstructed stone chimney at the south-west end. The guard room and the kitchen have stone slab floors. = Condition = The 1997 Conservation Management Plan noted that the stonework was generally in good condition, while there was some corrosion to the ironwork. As at May 2001, both buildings were roofless and the walls had varying levels of intactness. There was some weed and other vegetation growth.  Heritage listing  Military Guard Room was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes The military guard room (and detached kitchen), completed in 1842, is historically highly significant for its association with early convict administration in the Australian colonies. It is also associated with the other phases of Cockatoo Island's history, as an industrial school for females and as a major shipyard. Criterion B: Rarity The building is the only remaining imperial convict public works complex in NSW, and is one of the most complete groups of convict structures in Australia. The building is a rare and important example of a guard house of the period, still exhibiting features directly related to its use. Criterion D: Characteristic values The building is part of a group of convict buildings which is the only remaining imperial convict public works complex in NSW, and is one of the most complete groups of convict structures in Australia. As such, the building is also a rare and important example of a guard house of the period, still exhibiting features directly related to its use. Criterion H: Significant people The building was designed by Colonel George Barney, who as Commanding Royal Engineer played a notable role in the colony.
