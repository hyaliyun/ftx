Day graduated from Cathedral Preparatory Seminary in New York City, and attended Manhattan College in the Bronx, where he sang in the glee club. In 1939 Gene McNulty, as Day was then known, sang on network radio with bandleader Larry Clinton. The Clinton broadcasts were aimed at the collegiate audience, and were often broadcast from a college campus. The 23-year-old McNulty won an audience poll as a favorite vocalist. Radio Day appeared for the first time on Jack Benny's radio show on October 8, 1939, taking the place of another tenor, Kenny Baker. He remained associated with Benny's radio and television programs until Benny's death in 1974. He was introduced (with actress Verna Felton playing his overbearing mother) as a young (nineteen-year-old), naive boy singer ‚Äì a character he kept through his whole career. Mary Livingstone, Benny's wife, brought the singer to Benny's attention after hearing Day on the radio during a visit to New York. She took a recording of Day's singing to Benny, who then went to New York to audition Day. The audition resulted in Day's role on the Benny program. Day's first recorded song was \\"Goodnight My Beautiful\\". Besides singing, Day was a mimic. On the Benny program, Day performed impressions of various celebrities of the era, including Ronald Colman, Jimmy Durante and James Stewart. Sam Berman's caricature of Dennis Day for a 1947 NBC promotional book From 1944 through 1946 he served in the United States Navy as a Lieutenant. While in service he was temporarily replaced on the Benny radio program by fellow tenor Larry Stevens. On his return to civilian life, he continued to work with Benny while also starring on his own NBC show, A Day in the Life of Dennis Day (1946‚Äì1951). On Benny's show, Day's having two programs in comparison to Benny's one was the subject of numerous jokes and gags, usually revolving around Day rubbing Benny's, and sometimes other cast members' and guest stars' noses in that fact (e.g., \\"Dennis, why do you have two horns on your bicycle?\\" \\"Why shouldn't I? I've got two shows!\\"). His last radio series was a comedy and variety show that aired on NBC's Sunday afternoon schedule during the 1954‚Äì55 season. A Day in the Life of Dennis Day When Day got his own radio sitcom, he continued to play essentially the same character that he originated on Benny's program. However, for this series, Day lived in the fictional town of Weaverville. He stayed at a boarding house run by Clara Anderson, played by Bea Benaderet. Her henpecked husband, Herbert Anderson, was voiced by Dink Trout. Day was engaged to their daughter Mildred, played by Barbara Eiler. His character worked at Willoughby's Drug Store, where his boss was Mr. Willoughby. The show was sponsored by Colgate-Palmolive. Verne Smith was the announcer, while music was provided by Bud Dant and his orchestra. The format of the show would begin with a song by Day, followed by the first half of the plot, a second song by Day in the middle of the episode, the rest of the plot, and then a third song by Day to finish the episode. Episodes can be heard regularly on the Sirius XM Radio Classics Channel. Television An attempt was made to adapt A Day in the Life Of Dennis Day as an NBC filmed series (Sam Berman's caricature of Dennis was used in the opening and closing titles), produced by Jerry Fairbanks for Dennis' sponsor, Colgate-Palmolive, featuring the original radio cast, but got no farther than an unaired 1949 pilot episode. In late 1950, a sample kinescope was produced by Colgate and their ad agency showcasing Dennis as host of a projected \\"live\\" comedy/variety series (The Dennis Day Show) for CBS, but that, too, went unsold. He continued to appear as a regular cast member when The Jack Benny Program became a TV series, staying with the show until it ended in 1965. Eventually, his own TV series, The Dennis Day Show (aka The RCA Victor Show), was first telecast on NBC on February 8, 1952, and then in the 1953‚Äì1954 season. Between 1952 and 1978, he made numerous TV appearances as a singer and actor (such as NBC's The Gisele MacKenzie Show and ABC's The Bing Crosby Show and Alfred Hitchcock Presents) and voice for animation. During the final season of The Jack Benny Program (1964‚Äì65), Day was nearly 49 years old, although Benny was still delivering such lines as \\"That crazy kid drives me nuts ...\\" His last televised work with Benny was in 1970, when they appeared in a public service announcement together to promote savings and loans. This was shortly after the whole cast and crew of The Jack Benny Show had joined for Jack Benny's Twentieth Anniversary Special. In 1972, he co-starred with June Allyson and Judy Canova in the First National Tour of the Broadway musical No, No, Nanette. In 1976, Day was the voice of \\"The Preacher\\" in the Rankin-Bass production Frosty's Winter Wonderland and again worked with them in 1978, when he voiced Fred in The Stingiest Man in Town, which was their animated version of Charles Dickens' novel A Christmas Carol. He also appeared in Date with the Angels ‚Äì Season 1, Episode 13 as himself. Aired Friday 9:30 pm October 25, 1957 on ABC ‚Äì some records show it was episode 19, titled Star Struck. Film Although his career was mainly radio and TV-based, Day also appeared in a few films. These included Buck Benny Rides Again (1940) opposite Jack Benny, Sleepy Lagoon (1943), Music in Manhattan (1944), I'll Get By (1950), Golden Girl (1951), The Girl Next Door (1953), and Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood (1976) as a singing telegraph man. For the soundtrack of My Wild Irish Rose (1947), a biopic about Chauncey Olcott, Day provided the singing voice to the acting of Dennis Morgan. Day also provided the voices of Johnny Appleseed, Johnny's Angel and the Old Settler in the Johnny Appleseed segment in Walt Disney's Melody Time (1948). Personal life In 1948, Day married Peggy Almquist; the marriage lasted until his death in 1988. The couple had ten children. His brother Jim McNulty, two years younger, was married to actress and singer Ann Blyth. A Republican, Day was supportive of Dwight Eisenhower's campaign during the 1952 presidential electionMotion Picture and Television Magazine, November 1952, page 34, Ideal Publishers and Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election. Day died on June 22, 1988, of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease), in Los Angeles, California. His star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is at 6646 Hollywood Boulevard. He is interred in Culver City's Holy Cross Cemetery.

The player controls one of 24 different fighter jets through 21 different missions with certain objectives to fulfill, such as protecting a base from enemy fire, intercepting a squadron of enemies, or taking down an aircraft carrier. It is the sequel to Air Combat and the second in the Ace Combat franchise, with gameplay being presented in a more arcade- like format. Conceived by Namco designer Masanori Kato, Ace Combat 2 was created out of Kato's dissatisfaction with the original Air Combat, feeling from a technical standpoint it was severely lacking. Along with a small group of others, Kato set out to create a follow-up that greatly improved on the original, featuring improved graphics, a variety in missions, and providing a true sense of flight for the player. Missions were created to be exciting and fun to play, with the gameplay itself being designed to mimic the typical style of arcade games. The team used aircraft books and aviation magazines as reference material when designing new aircraft. Fighters were intentionally made to not be exact replicas of real-world fighters as it would make the game overly-complex for their target audience. Much of the music was provided by Kohta Takahashi, being heavily inspired by Top Gun. Ace Combat 2 was a commercial success, selling over 500,000 copies in Japan alone by May of 1998. It was commended by critics for its gameplay, graphics, variety in missions and for being a major improvement over its predecessor. Some also called it one of the best flight-sim games on the PlayStation. The lack of a multiplayer mode and its high-difficulty level were the subject of criticism. It was re- released as a budget title in Japan in 1999 under Sony's The Best label, and was included in the 2005 compilation NamCollection for the PlayStation 2. A remake for the Nintendo 3DS, Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy, was released in 2011. Gameplay In-game screenshot, showing the player targeting a squadron of enemies. The player's fuel meter is shown at the top-left. Ace Combat 2 is a combat flight simulator video game. It is presented in a more arcade-like format in contrast to other flight-sim games. The player controls one of 24 different fighter jets through 21 different missions, each having different objectives to complete; these include intercepting a squadron of enemies, destroying a specific aircraft carrier, or protecting a base from enemy fire. Completing missions awards the player money which can be spent on new aircraft in their personal hangar. Beginning at the game's fourth mission is the ability to allow a wingman to fly with the player, which provide additional support and will help them in completing the objective. The game begins in a mostly linear format, with branching mission paths being available later on. A fuel meter acts as a time limit and will deplete as the player flies around the level and attacks enemies; the mission will automatically end if the meter fully depletes. New to this game are \\"aces\\", elite enemy pilots that can be fought to unlock special medals and their special aircraft for play later. Two difficulty options are present, \\"Novice\\" and \\"Expert\\", with Expert allowing for realistic aircraft maneuvers such as rolls and high-g turns. Development The development team of Ace Combat 2 intentionally chose not to use the exact statistics for real-world aircraft as they felt it would make the game too complex for their target audience. Ace Combat 2 was the creation of Namco designer Masanori Kato, who previously worked on the game's predecessor Air Combat, and a small team of others. The idea for the game came from Kato's dissatisfaction with the outcome of Air Combat, which he saw as incomplete from a technical point of view. Kato and his team decided to create a follow-up to make the best use of the PlayStation's hardware as possible, with an emphasis on graphics and making the player feel as if they're really flying a fightercraft. One of the first things the team wanted to improve on were the graphics, doing technical research on how many polygons the console could display. The team created a program that was able to output as many polygons as possible without causing restraint on the hardware, which allowed the graphics to be of significantly higher-quality than most other games. The team also looked into including a large variety of missions, as opposed to Air Combats two mission types. Missions were designed to be exciting and fun to play, and when new fighters were added the team determined if they would make the missions more interesting or not. The gameplay itself was designed in the style of an arcade game instead of being strictly a flight-simulation game, which they felt made the game much more fun. Kato and his team used books on planes and aviation-related magazines as reference when creating new fighters. They also watched several films on air combat and traveled to the American Armed Force airshow to take photographs of the planes on display. To make the game less complex for their target audience, the team decided that the fighters would have different data from that of their real- world counterparts. A simplistic law of physics system was implemented in their place, which kept the game's realism while still providing a user- friendly experience. The team looked into getting advice from a real airplane pilot to refine the gameplay, but were unable to do so. Ideas for missions were from Kato and the team's imaginations, although he stated he wished they were able to travel to real-world places to gather data and references. Environments were created to be visually-impressive and interesting. The development team experimented with a level design that would involve the player attempting to de-rail a trail through a mountain valley, but it was ultimately dropped due to technical and graphical restraints. The overall level structure was tweaked slightly so that the strategy in missions would not feel awkward or unnatural. At the beginning of development, the team wanted the game to support analogue control, adding support for both the PlayStation DualShock and the Namco NeGcon, and later the PlayStation Analog Joystick. The soundtrack for Ace Combat 2, composed by Kohta Takahashi and a team of five others, was heavily inspired by Top Gun. Takahashi wanted the music to be 'simulating' and intense, but made sure it had its own distinct flare to prevent it from sounding too similar to Top Gun. The composers also made sure it reflected the designs and objectives of each mission. Most of the sound effects were directly taken from a special-effects CD one of the composers had, while others were entirely original. Ace Combat 2 was released in Japan on May 30, 1997, later released in North America on July 31 and in Europe on October 24. The game was re-released as a budget title in Japan on July 29, 1999 as part of Sony's The Best budget label. It is included in the 2005 video game compilation NamCollection for the PlayStation 2 alongside four other Namco PlayStation game ports, in celebration of the company's 50th anniversary. Reception Ace Combat 2 was a commercial success; in May 1998, Sony gave the game the \\"Gold Prize\\" award for selling over 500,000 copies in Japan. It won several awards from video game publications, including the \\"Silver Hall of Fame\\" from Famitsu, \\"Editor's Choice\\" from IGN, and \\"Game of the Month\\" from Electronic Gaming Monthly. It holds an 83 out of 100 on reviewer aggregator website Metacritic, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The game was well-received by critics. Crispin Boyer of Electronic Gaming Monthly applauded the draw distance, while Computer and Video Games called it \\"The most intense flight experience to ever grace a console\\". Next Generation said that it would \\"keep a whole bunch of weekend warriors strapped in to the TV\\", while IGN labeled it \\"one of the best flight simulators ever to come to the PlayStation\\" and said that Namco went \\"all out\\" with its visuals. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly felt the game's strongest point was its variety, with multiple planes to choose from and unlock and widely varying mission objectives. Publications commended the quality of the gameplay for its fast-pace and variety in missions, although AllGame and Computer and Video Games felt it became \\"monotonous\\" and tiring after a while. Jeff Gerstmann of Gamespot argued that the low difficulty level ensures the game is over too quickly in spite of the large number of missions. However, the majority of critics contended that the enemy artificial intelligence is extremely advanced and responds to player movements, making the game's difficulty, if anything, overly high. The game's consistently high frame rate and environmental visuals were subjects of praise. Many publications agreed that Ace Combat 2 was a vast improvement over its predecessor, with IGN, Electric Playground and GamePro all commending Namco for successfully updating the gameplay in the original to make it much more action-packed and entertaining. Next Generation said it was an excellent follow-up to Air Combat, with Famitsu adding that it made for one of the best sequel games the company had put out on the PlayStation. Several also liked the game's controls for being responsive and smooth; Next Generation credited the game's support for the PlayStation Analog Joystick, which they felt made the game even more realistic than it was before. While some criticized the lack of a multiplayer mode, Computer and Video Games argued that the removal of a two-player option was a good idea, feeling that it allowed Namco to refine the gameplay and stages in general. Electric Playground and AllGame both praised the large selection of playable fighters, with AllGame also applauding its usage of secrets and unlockable extras. Remake A remake for the Nintendo 3DS, Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy, was released in 2011 in North America and Europe, and in 2012 in Japan, where it was renamed Ace Combat 3D: Cross Rumble. Assault Horizon Legacy features a complete revamp of the game's storyline, alongside the addition of cutscenes, voice acting and remade level designs. It also adds several new fighters not found in the original, including the Boeing F-15SE Silent Eagle and the Sukhoi PAK FA. Despite its namesake, it has very little in common with its predecessor Ace Combat: Assault Horizon. It was followed by a 2015 update called Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy +, adding amiibo support and updated control handling for the New Nintendo 3DS.

It is presented in a more arcade-like format in stark contrast to other flight sim games. The player controls one of sixteen different aircraft, including the F-4 Phantom, Su-27 Flanker, and even Stealth aircraft, and must complete each of the game's seventeen levels, each having mission objectives that must be fulfilled. Missions range from destroying a squadron of enemy fighters, protecting an allied base from enemy fire, or destroying a massive battleship. Completing missions awards the player money, which can be used to purchase new fighters in their own personal hangar. Extra money can also be earned by destroying optional, \\"non-target\\" enemies. Beginning at the game's fourth mission, a wingman can be employed into battle that will help protect the player and fight alongside them. Additional wingmen can be hired by earning additional money during combat. The game progresses in a linear format. Alongside the main single-player campaign, there is also a split-screen multiplayer deathmatch mode, where two players attempt to destroy each other in the quickest time possible. Players can also unlock new fighters and special minigames by completing specific objectives at various points throughout the game. Players can also swap between a first-person and third-person camera option. Plot A terrorist force starts an uprising (and inflicts massive damage across an unidentified country, later retconned to Skully Island which is part of the continent of Usea); efforts to defeat these terrorists through conventional means have failed and the situation turns desperate. In response, a mercenary air force is assembled to take the fight against the enemy and free the nation from the terrorist forces. Reception Air Combat proved to be a commercial success for Namco. In Japan alone, the game sold over 246,000 copies in its first week, and nearly 600,000 overall. By 2008 the game sold over 2.23 million copies, making it the second best-selling game in the franchise behind Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies. Famitsu awarded it the \\"Silver Hall of Fame\\" award, while Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded it \\"Best Flight Sim of 1995\\". Critics focused primarily on the gameplay, who felt it had an addictive, arcade-like nature. GameFan described it as \\"easily the ultimate flight simulator\\". IGN, who compared it favorably to Warhawk, praised its gameplay for being action-packed, as did Allgame and Coming Soon. Allgame also liked the game's addictiveness and longevity. Famitsu stated that the game was fun and had a lot of variety and action, but could have used additional levels. Several critics argued that the game started off at a slow and boring pace at the beginning, but became very fun after a while; GamePro wrote that patient players would \\"gradually get caught up in the gripping gameplay\\". In their brief coverage of the game in 1997, Next Generation argued that the game didn't hold up well in comparison to other games, saying that it was a decent flight sim but not as fun as its competitors. The controls were also praised, with Coming Soon and Famitsu saying it made it one of the most realistic flight sims for a console. Air Combat was also praised for its cinematic cutscenes, realistic sound effects, and amount of unlockables. The graphics and presentation of Air Combat were criticized, with reviewers finding them to be of poor quality. Allgame showed confusion towards this, due to Namco's other PlayStation games from the time having high-resolution graphics. IGN said the graphics, which they criticized for their constant flickering, were the game's weakest point, alongside its poor presentation. GamePro also criticized the visuals for being bland and unappealing. By a stark contrast, both GameFan and Coming Soon praised them for their realism and detail. Like IGN, Famitsu also stated the graphics were the game's low point, arguing that its arcade predecessor Air Combat 22 had much better visuals. Critics liked the game's mission variety in later levels for not simply repeating previous ones. Allgame in particular said that it gave the game a lot of replay value for this reason, as did Famitsu. GamePro labeled them as being \\"polished\\", but argued that the earlier ones were rather boring. The soundtrack also received praise, with Allgame listing it among the game's best features. Legacy Air Combat spawned one of Namco's most-successful franchises, which retained the Japanese name of Ace Combat for all regions. It laid down the basic foundations for the series, and is seen as an important and influential game in the combat flight simulator genre. The first sequel was Ace Combat 2 in 1997, adding new missions, fightercraft, and the ability to perform high-g turns. It was followed by the futuristic-themed Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere in 1999, which employed a branching storyline that changed based on player decision. Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies was published for the PlayStation 2 in 2001, succeeded by Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War in 2004, the final Ace Combat game developed by Namco. The then-newly-formed Namco Bandai Games released Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War in 2006 for the PlayStation 2, and Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation for the Xbox 360 in 2007, the latter being the first in the series to incorporate online multiplayer and downloadable content. Ace Combat: Assault Horizon was released in 2011 for multiple platforms, followed by the online multiplayer game Ace Combat Infinity in 2012. Bandai Namco Entertainment released Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown in 2019, which added virtual reality support. Several handheld spin- offs were also produced. Ace Combat Advance was released in 2005 for the Game Boy Advance in North America and Europe, being the only game in the series to not see a release in Japan. In 2006, Ace Combat X: Skies of Deception was released for the PlayStation Portable, utilizing the system's download play functionality to support multiplayer. Ace Combat Xi: Skies of Incursion was published in 2009 for iOS devices; it has since been removed from the App Store. A sequel to Ace Combat, titled Ace Combat: Joint Assault, was released in 2010 for the PlayStation Portable. Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2012; despite the title, it bears little to no relation with the original Assault Horizon. Legacy was re-released in 2015 as Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy +, adding support for amiibo and control handling for the New Nintendo 3DS.

Gran Turismo 2 was developed by Polyphony Digital and published by Sony Computer Entertainment in 1999. It is the sequel to Gran Turismo. It was well-received critically and financially, shipping 1.71 million copies in Japan, 20,000 in Southeast Asia, 3.96 million in North America, and 3.68 million in Europe for a total of 9.37 million copies as of April 30, 2008, and eventually becoming a Sony Greatest Hits game. The title received an average of 93% in Metacritic's aggregate. Gameplay Gran Turismo 2 is a racing game. The player must maneuver an automobile to compete against artificially intelligent drivers on various race tracks. The game uses two different modes: Arcade Mode and Simulation Mode (Gran Turismo Mode in PAL and Japanese versions). In the arcade mode, the player can freely choose vehicles they wish to use, and can enable damage, while the simulation mode requires the player to earn driver's licenses, pay for vehicles, and earn trophies in order to unlock new and returning courses. Gran Turismo 2 features nearly 650 automobiles and 27 racing tracks, including rally tracks. Compared with Gran Turismo, the gameplay, physics and graphics are very similar: the only real noticeable difference in vehicle dynamics was the brakes, which became much less likely to lock up and cause the vehicle to oversteer. The major changes are the vastly expanded number of cars, tracks and races in simulation mode. Other differences include that the player can race events separately, if they do not want to enter the whole tournament. The player is no longer able to \\"qualify\\" for each race entered.

For example, in version 1.0 of the NTSC-U version of the game, the maximum attainable completion percentage was 98.2%. Another glitch was that no matter what, even if a player saves the game, cars can disappear from their garage.\\"Gran Turismo 2 glitches before its release\\". A third glitch was that certain cars would appear in the wrong races. This was most significant in the 30-lap Trial Mountain endurance race, where a 680 bhp Vector M12 LM edition may appear despite a 295-horsepower entry restriction, effectively making the race nearly impossible to win. The reason for the maximum completion percentage falling short is due to a planned drag racing mode that was never implemented.

It is an intermodal hub served by four BART routes, three Muni Metro lines, and a number of Muni bus routes. The station complex also includes two rail yards, Cameron Beach Yard and Green Light Rail Center, where Muni maintains Muni Metro trains and heritage streetcars. BART uses a below-grade island platform on the west side of the complex; Muni Metro routes use several smaller side platforms located on surface-level rail loops around the yards. The San Francisco and San Jose Railroad opened in 1863, with Elkton station located near the modern site. Passenger service on the line (later the Southern Pacific Railroad Ocean View Branch) ran until about 1922. Electric streetcar service at Balboa Park began in 1892 with the San Francisco and San Mateo Electric Railway, which built a still-standing office building designed by Reid & Reid there in 1901. The United Railroads conglomerate built its Elkton shops on an adjacent parcel in 1907. In the 1960s, BART decided to use the Ocean View Branch right-of-way for part of a rapid transit system. The San Francisco portion of BART, including Balboa Park station, opened on November 5, 1973. Both streetcar facilities were replaced by modern yards in the 1970s and 1980s. Muni Metro service to the Balboa Park complex began with the K Ingleside line in 1979, followed by the M Ocean View line in 1980 and the J Church line in 1991. In the early 2000s, BART and Muni began planning renovations to improve the accessibility of the station and its connections to the surrounding neighborhoods. A new BART entrance was completed in 2011, followed by new Muni platforms in 2015 and 2017 and an additional footbridge in 2018. Additional improvements like more elevators and modernized headhouses are proposed. The 1901-built office building and an adjacent powerhouse, both abandoned since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, are planned to be renovated as a community center. Station layout and services Map of the Balboa Park station complex The Balboa Park station complex is centered around an irregular quadrilateral bounded by Ocean Avenue to the north, the Interstate 280 (I-280) cut to the west, Geneva Avenue to the south, and San Jose Avenue to the east. The BART platform‚Äîa island platform‚Äîis located below grade on the west side of the complex. It stretches from Ocean Avenue to slightly south of Geneva Avenue. The northern third of the platform, plus a small section at the southern end, is in an open trench; the remainder is under Geneva Avenue and the headhouse structure. The main entrance, located on the north side of Geneva Avenue, leads to a below-street-level fare control area in a mezzanine over the middle of the BART platform. Additional entrances from the south side of Geneva Avenue (via an underpass) and from San Jose Avenue at Geneva Avenue (the Muni entrance) also lead to the fare control area. From the two paid areas in the mezzanine, stairs and escalators connect to the platform. An accessible ramp from Ocean Avenue runs along the west side of the station to a secondary fare control area at the north end of the north paid area. An elevator on the north side of Geneva Avenue connects to the south paid area and the platform. A Muni Metro rail yard, the Curtis E. Green Light Rail Center, takes up the rest of the block. The east half is occupied by a maintenance building and the west half by open storage tracks, with an administrative building at the south end. Muni J Church and K Ingleside trains loop around the outer edge of the yard. Trains enter from Ocean Avenue and drop off passengers at a high-level platform (which is connected to the BART fare mezzanine and the path top San Jose Avenue with a ramp) on the west side of the yard. They lay over on a pair of tracks on the south side of the yard, then pick up passengers at a high-level platform on the east side of the yard adjacent to San Jose Avenue. J Church trains exit the yard there onto tracks on San Jose Avenue (with a separate stop at Ocean Avenue), while K Ingleside trains continue around the loop and exit where they entered. A second Muni rail yard, the Cameron Beach Yard, is located south of Geneva Avenue and east of San Jose Avenue. It includes a maintenance building, a storage shelter for historic streetcars, open storage tracks, and a currently-abandoned office building and powerhouse. M Ocean View loop around Cameron Beach Yard; the last stop for outbound trains is at San Jose and Niagara, one block to the south of Geneva Avenue. The stop does not have a platform; if a passenger needs an accessible platform to alight, the train will proceed across Geneva Avenue to a mini-high platform located at Seneca Avenue. Inbound trains pick up passengers at San Jose and Geneva, which has a concrete platform with a wayside lift for accessibility, after proceeding around the yard loop. An unused set of storage tracks, the Upper Yard, is located on the west side of San Jose Avenue. Balboa Park is a major transfer point for Muni buses, with over 13,000 daily boardings by a 2008 survey. Routes , , , , , , and stop on Geneva Avenue next to the BART station entrances.

History =Southern Pacific Railroad= Freeway construction on the former SP right-of-way in 1964. Elkton Shops is at left. The San Francisco and San Jose Railroad (SF&SJ;) opened through San Francisco on October 16, 1863, and was merged into the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) in 1868. The line had several stops within San Francisco, including Elkton, located on the east side of the tracks south of Ocean Avenue. It was primarily a freight station for nearby farms, though it also served the nearby Industrial School as well as residential neighborhoods that were laid out in the 1860s. However, the railroad was not very useful to local residents: high fares discouraged both passengers and freight, and on- street running in the Mission District made the ride slow. After the SP opened the faster Bayshore Cutoff in 1907, the original mainline through San Francisco was reduced to a minor freight branch (the Ocean View Branch) with minimal passenger service. SP passenger service on the Ocean View Branch was limited to a few daily locals after 1907, and just one daily round trip after June 1919. Regular passenger service on the branch ended around 1922, though freight service continued. The tracks were abandoned north of Ocean Avenue (up to 23rd Street) on August 10, 1942, and south of Ocean Avenue (to at least Daly City) after a 1956 excursion train. The Southern Freeway was constructed partially on the abandoned right-of-way in the 1960s; the section through Balboa Park was completed in 1964. As part of the highway, pedestrian ramps were built at Ocean Avenue to allow passengers on highway express buses to transfer to local transit. =Streetcars= Electric streetcar service began with the San Francisco and San Mateo Electric Railway (SF&SM;) on San Jose Avenue on April 27, 1892. It was followed in December 1895 by a Market Street Railway spur on Ocean Avenue, branching off their Mission Street line. In 1900, the SF&SM; bought land on the southeast corner of San Jose Avenue and Geneva Avenue to construct its main facilities. Construction began on July 14, 1900. A office building along San Jose Avenue‚Äîdesigned by Reid & Reid‚Äîopened on April 22, 1901, followed by an adjacent powerhouse in 1903. The SF&SM; and the Market Street Railway were both absorbed into the United Railroads (URR) conglomerate in 1902. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the URR rerouted the San Mateo line to Mission Street; Embarcadero‚ÄìDaly City route 26 continued to operate on San Jose Avenue. In 1907, while expanding its streetcar network after the previous year's earthquake , the URR hurriedly opened its Elkton shops next to the SP's Elkton station. The shops occupied a parcel bounded by San Jose Avenue to the east, the SP line to the west, Ocean Avenue to the north, and Geneva Avenue to the south. The SP line was used to deliver materials to the yard. On September 16, 1909, the SF&SM; yard was renamed Geneva Yard. The powerhouse, damaged in the earthquake, was rebuilt in 1910. In 1917, during a violent strike of URR operators, strike-brakers were temporarily housed in the office building. A wooden staircase was constructed from the second floor directly to the carbarn. The URR was renamed as the Market Street Railway in 1921, and purchased by the city-owned San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni) in 1944. The merger and the impending end of World War II (which had limited the availability of rubber tires) prompted the conversion of many streetcar routes to bus or trolleybus. Route 26 had previously been discontinued in 1938 and soon replaced by a branch (itself closed on November 5, 1939) of the route 9 streetcar. Route 26 service resumed on September 23, 1944, but was replaced by buses on February 4, 1945, ending streetcar service on San Jose Avenue. Muni's K Ingleside line was extended on Ocean Avenue and Onondaga Street to Mission Street on April 8, 1945, as the ex-MSR line on Ocean Avenue was converted to bus. K Ingleside service was cut back to Phelan Loop on October 10, 1952; however, Geneva Yard was retained as the yard for the remaining streetcar system. The southern portion of the Elkton lot, as well as the parcel across Geneva Avenue to the south, were used for bus storage. =BART station= South end of the station platform showing the natural lighting, textured walls, and overhead conduit design praised by critics Even before the Ocean View Branch was abandoned, several proposals for rapid transit aimed to use the Ocean View Branch route (usually in conjunction with a Mission Street subway) and its Bernal Cut to avoid expensive tunneling through San Francisco's hills. Early plans for BART around 1960 considered several different routings for the Peninsula Line (then planned to extend to Palo Alto): the Bayshore Cutoff, the existing Twin Peaks Tunnel, a new bored tunnel crossing diagonally under the Mission District, and a Mission Street tunnel continuing via Alemany Boulevard. By 1961, the Mission Street tunnel and reuse of the Ocean View Branch was favored, with a station at Ocean Avenue. The plan was approved by voters in 1962. Early BART plans referred to many stations by the cross street, but most stations were ultimately named for the surrounding neighborhood or city. The Ocean Avenue station was named Balboa Park after the nearby municipal park by 1967. The station was sandwiched between I-280 and Elkton shops, a sliver of which was taken for construction. Construction of the station was 60% complete by mid-1970, with work expected to be finished the next year. The San Francisco portion of BART, including Balboa Park station, opened on November 5, 1973. Rather than having a single architecture firm design every station, BART had a number of architects (mostly local) design one or several stations each \\"so that each station will achieve a character of its own, suitable to its own unique environment\\". Balboa Park and Glen Park were designed by Ernest Born (who also designed the systemwide station signage) and Corlett & Spackman, with landscape work by Douglas Bayliss. Both stations were designed in the brutalist style, with Balboa Park the \\"smaller and more intimate\\". It has headhouses on each side of Geneva Avenue, sized to be appropriate to the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Original plans called for a bus parking deck over the platform, but a late decision to omit it (Woods Division in the Dogpatch neighborhood was built instead) allowed for the north and south ends of the platform to be in open air. The walls of the platform area are covered with linear precast concrete forms, with five patterns repeated eightfold to generate \\"an apparently infinite variety\\". Other elements praised by architectural critics included overhead power conduits on the platform level, and the interplay of light and shadow among the geometric forms of the mezzanine. =Muni service= K (left) and J streetcars laying over at Balboa Park in 1997 As Muni began transitioning from aging PCC streetcars to the Boeing USLRV in the 1970s, Elkton shops and the old car barn in Geneva Yard (which had been Muni's only rail yard since 1956) required modernization. Elkton Shops was closed on May 30, 1977, and replaced with a new facility. This Metro Rail Center included a loop track around its periphery, with an alighting area adjacent to the BART fare mezzanine in the southwest corner and a boarding area near San Jose Avenue in the southeast corner, plus a stop in the northeast corner of the yard. Some K Ingleside shuttle service was extended to Balboa Park on April 23, 1979, and all weekday service ran to Balboa Park after the line was converted to Muni Metro light rail operation on December 17, 1980. The Metro Rail Center was named the Curtis E. Green Light Rail Center in 1987. Green had become after Muni's general manager in 1974‚Äîthe first African-American to lead a major transit system in the US‚Äîand retired in 1982. A second Muni Metro line, the M Ocean View, was extended to the station complex on August 30, 1980; it usually looped around Green Yard, but used the Geneva Yard loop at times. For some time beginning in 1982, the K and M lines were through-routed to avoid the yard loop. The Geneva Yard car barns were demolished in January 1983. The old Geneva Car Barn on its final day of operation for streetcars in service, Sep. 19, 1982 In 1972, Muni began planning a long-proposed extension of the J Church line along San Jose Avenue (a section of which was built along the former Ocean View Branch through the Bernal Cut) to Balboa Park. The extension was intended to provide transit service to the Outer Mission, allow J Church and N Judah trains to access the carhouses via San Jose Avenue rather than a roundabout route via the K Ingleside line, and allow future through-routing of the J and M lines. Construction on the extension began in January 1989, but was delayed by the earthquake later that year. On August 31, 1991, J and N streetcars began using the extension to access the yards, thus providing revenue J service to Balboa at limited hours. Full-time revenue service began June 19, 1993. The extension included a new stop for the J line at San Jose and Ocean; inbound K trains also stopped at a plaza near that intersection. A small accessible platform was built east of Green Yard, next to the northbound track on San Jose at Seneca, to allow the planned through-routing. (Southbound trains were to use the existing alighting and boarding area on the Green Yard loop; a small accessible platform was available on the west side of the yard loop, north of the main alighting area.) However, although some weekday J and M service was through-routed from 1995 to 1998, full through-routing was never implemented. Instead, J trains shared the revenue loop around Green Yard with K trains, using the same boarding and alighting areas. J trains were diverted onto an inner track between the accessible platform and the boarding area; an underpass under the K track connected the J alighting area to the fare mezzanine. This allowed J and K trains to lay over separately so that irregular operations on one line would not impact the other. =Modern renovations= The completed Eastside Connector in December 2018 In 2002, BART released the Comprehensive Station Plan, which indicated a need for improved entrances and access at the station. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors approved the Balboa Park Area Plan in May 2009, setting the stage for a number of transit and pedestrian improvements to the station complex. Three projects‚Äîthe Westside Walkway, the Eastside Connector, and new Muni boarding and alighting platforms‚Äîwere prioritized and funded. As constructed, the BART station only had direct access from Geneva Avenue; a non-accessible pathway on the west side of the station was the only official route from Ocean Avenue, though many passengers took a shorter but dangerous route through the Muni yard instead. The Westside Walkway replaced the northern half of the path with a concrete ramp that leads to a new set of faregates at the north end of the headhouse, thus providing a shorter and fully accessible entrance from Ocean Avenue and the nearby City College of San Francisco (for which the station is the main transit access.) The walkway was opened on April 15, 2011. In September 2014, Muni began construction of an accessible 1-car-length high- level platform on the east side of the yard, adjacent to San Jose Avenue, to allow level boarding for all inbound J and K riders. This platform replaced a narrow, non-accessible boarding area on the south end of the yard loop. The J and K lines were rerouted onto San Jose Avenue during construction. The new platform was opened on April 27, 2015, with both lines immediately rerouted back to the loop around the yard. The K stop at the northeast corner of the yard was permanently closed on April 25. Red-painted bus lanes were added on westbound Geneva Avenue between Delano Avenue and I-280 in March 2016. On May 31, 2016, BART began construction of the Eastside Connector project, a northward expansion of the headhouse over the open BART platform with improved connections between Muni and BART. In September 2016, Muni began construction of its section of the project‚Äîa longer high-level deboarding platform to replace the mini-high platform on the west side of the yard. This work was coordinated with rail replacement in the yard and widening the pedestrian walkway to San Jose Avenue. The J Church line was rerouted onto San Jose Avenue, while the K Ingleside was cut back to City College Pedestrian Bridge. The K was returned to the loop on May 20, 2017, while the J remained on San Jose Avenue until November 18. The steel deck beams were lifted into place on July 16, 2017. The renovations were completed with the opening of the Eastside Connector on November 30, 2018. The opening of the Muni Metro East facility on the T Third Street line in 2008 reduced storage needs at Geneva Yard. The Upper Yard was closed, and the main yard increasingly dedicated to Muni's historic streetcar fleet. On December 2, 2010, Muni and the Market Street Railway nonprofit organization opened a 6-track shelter at the yard to house 24 historic streetcars. The $10.1 million structure forms the primary storage and maintenance area for the historic fleet. On October 25, 2011, the yard was renamed Cameron Beach Yard after a recently deceased member of the SFMTA Board of Directors. From June 21, 2014 to June 16, 2018, the historic streetcar fleet was stored at Muni Metro East rather than Cameron Beach Yard, as the latter was needed for LRVs displaced by Green Yard rail replacement work. =Proposed renovations= The existing entrance on the south side of Geneva Avenue, which is proposed to be modernized with an elevator and a glass headhouse In 2012, Muni released the Balboa Park Station Capacity and Conceptual Engineering Study, which analyzed a number of possible improvements to the station area to guide future project choices. Projects recommended by the report (along with those discussed above) included: *Improvements to wayfinding signage, lighting, real-time information screens, and bus shelters *An additional elevator on the south side of Geneva Avenue *Extension of the J line along San Jose Avenue, taking over M service east of 19th Avenue. A new K-only platform would be built at the southern end of the yard, with new retail space above. Previous proposals for a stub-end or loop terminal over I-280 for the J and K lines were deemed infeasible. *Full-length high-level platforms for the M or extended J in the median of San Jose Avenue at Geneva Avenue. The report recommended farside platforms (served after trains pass the intersection), rather than having both platforms north of Geneva Avenue. *Creation of a kiss-and-ride cul-de-sac on the existing access road on the west side of the Upper Yard *New westbound transit-only lane and bus stop island on Ocean Avenue north of the station *A deck over I-280 (estimated to cost between $1.3 and $2 billion), including a possible single-point urban interchange The 2011 plan for a rerouting of the M Ocean View through Parkmerced assumed that the M would continue to terminate at Balboa Park. Initial plans in 2014 for a 19th Avenue subway had the M divide into two branches, one terminating at Parkmerced and the other at Balboa Park. A 2016 update to the plan called for the J Church to continue on San Jose Avenue at Balboa Park and take over existing M service as far as San Francisco State University station. In March 2018, BART released preliminary plans for the next round of modifications to the station. The project would include modern headhouses on both sides of Geneva Avenue, an elevator connecting the south side of Geneva Avenue to the pedestrian underpass and the platform, an elevator connecting the north side of Geneva Avenue to the Muni platform level and fare mezzanine, platform canopies and seating, and new interior finishes and public art. =Geneva Yard buildings restoration= The office building at Geneva Yard was designated a San Francisco Landmark by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1985. After being damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the office building and powerhouse were red-tagged and abandoned. In 1998, Muni planned to demolish the structures to create a parking lot; the agency dropped the plans the next year due to community opposition and the intervention of mayor Willie Brown. The nonprofit group Friends of the Geneva Office Building (later Friends of the Geneva Car Barn and Powerhouse) was formed with the intention of instead renovating the buildings for community use. Muni completed initial stabilization of the structures in 1999. In March 2004, control of the buildings was transferred to the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department. Over the next 11 years, the Department and the Friends spent $3.98 million on repairs, design, and other work related to the buildings. Additional stabilization and seismic refit of the structures was begun in 2004 and completed in 2006. The buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 31, 2010 as Geneva Office Building and Power House. The city gave the Friends of the Geneva Car Barn control of the building in 2014, but reclaimed it in 2015 when the group had difficulties raising funds. In June 2017, the Department budgeted $3 million from a 2012 parks bond, bringing available funding to $11 million. The next month, the city announced that it would receive $3.5 million in state funds for the project‚Äîenough to complete renovations of the powerhouse. The city accepted the grant in December. A groundbreaking ceremony for the $14 million powerhouse renovation was held in March 2018. The car barn restoration is estimated to cost $38.5 million; the city intends to begin in 2020, but funding has not been obtained.

Publication history The character first appears in Fantastic Four #211 (Oct. 1979) and was created by Marv Wolfman and John Byrne. Fictional character biography =The Birth of a Herald= The character first appears as a Birjan named Tyros, the ruler of the city-state of Lanlak on the planetoid Birj. The cosmic entity Galactus selects Tyros as his next Herald, but first wishes for the superhero team the Fantastic Four to humble him. In return the cosmic entity agrees to travel to Earth to aid the heroes against a new threat, the villain Sphinx. Tyros is defeated, and brought before Galactus, who changes the petty tyrant into Terrax the Tamer. His minor control over stone was augmented to an incalculable degree. Now, he could affect all matter of rock and stone on nearly a planetary scale. His body was changed so that it would withstand the vacuum of space. Finally, Galactus gave Terrax a weapon called the cosmic axe capable of generating waves of cosmic force. Terrax travels with Galactus to Earth and, while his new master battles the Sphinx, attacks the Fantastic Four‚Äîstill resenting the heroes for their role in his transformation. Terrax, however, is tricked and defeated by the Human Torch, and leaves with a victorious Galactus.Fantastic Four #210‚Äì213 (Sep. ‚Äì Dec. 1979) =Rebellion= As Galactus's new herald, Terrax found more worlds for his master than any of the previous heralds. Terrax likened the discovery of new planets to the feeling of conquest. On several occasions, Terrax annihilated large segments of the population himself using his cosmic powers. As Galactus had hoped, Terrax's lack of morality made him a successful herald. But whereas Galactus's other heralds had a sense of loyalty to their master, Terrax had none. Indeed, he served Galactus out of fear for his master's power, but even conquered that fear on several occasions to defy Galactus' wishes. Shortly after being transformed into Galactus' herald, Terrax fled from his master and overthrew the ruling body of a small- unnamed planet. He enslaved the entire population and set himself up as the planet's deity. Huge segments of that world's people died erecting temples and cities to glorify Terrax. Terrax planned to use the survivors of his reign as the first wave of a planned universe conquering army. But before Terrax could proceed any further, Galactus summoned his herald. Fearful of his master's wrath, Terrax hid in a black hole. Utilizing the powers of the Earth mutant Dazzler, Galactus freed Terrax and made him obedient to his will again.Dazzler #10‚Äì11 (Dec. 1981 ‚Äì Jan. 1982) Terrax reappears in the title Rom, and after leading Galactus to the planet Galador, battles its champion, Rom, and his fellow Spaceknight, Terminator.Rom #26‚Äì27 (Jan. ‚Äì Feb. 1984) But Terrax's rebellious nature could not be totally stifled, and after a while, Terrax again fled his master. This time, he went to Earth. Utilizing his power, Terrax levitated the entire island of Manhattan into earth orbit and used the lives of its millions of inhabitants to bargain with the Fantastic Four. To spare Manhattan, Terrax demanded that they destroy Galactus by attacking his ship. Galactus had by now realized that his herald had become a liability to him, Returning Manhattan to Earth, Galactus stripped Terrax of his cosmic power and the transformed alien was sent hurtling from the top of the World Trade Center down to the street below. Although seriously injured, Terrax's alien physique enabled him to survive the fall. An unidentified passerby took Terrax's broken form, unknown to both the Fantastic Four and the Avengers, who were present at the site, to a nearby hospital. He remained there for several months in a semi comatose state.Fantastic Four #242‚Äì243 (May ‚Äì June 1982) Victor Von Doom, looking for a pawn to use in a plot against the Fantastic Four, discovered that Terrax had survived. Terrax was kidnapped from the hospital and brought back to Doom's kingdom of Latveria by a squad of robots dispatched by Doom. There, after six weeks of Doom's advanced treatments, Terrax recovered. But, having been stripped of cosmic power, Terrax had no memories of having been the herald of Galactus, and thus called himself Tyros once more. Doom had recently perfected a device that was capable of endowing an individual with limited cosmic power. Tyros readily agreed to be exposed to the device's energies, as he wished revenge against the Fantastic Four. Garbed in a special suit that would channel and regulate the cosmic energies in his body, Tyros set off for New York. Unknown to him, the power Doom gave him would consume Tyros's body within a matter of hours. Thus, Doom would not be faced with an adversary whose power was vaster than his own, once Tyros had served his purpose.Fantastic Four #258‚Äì259 (Sep. ‚Äì Oct. 1983) Tyros defeated the Fantastic Four at a shopping mall and, detesting the fact he was in the service of any master, he turned on Doom and immobilized the Latverian monarch in his armor. At Tyros's moment of seeming triumph, the Silver Surfer, the first of Galactus's heralds, arrived to save the lives of his friends. Tyros believed that his power level was equal to that of the Surfer's, but he soon learned that he was no match for someone who had received the Power Cosmic from Galactus himself. Tyros was forced to use his powers to their limit in order to combat the Surfer. This only served to hasten his inevitable deterioration. As the two former heralds of Galactus engaged in battle, Tyros was totally consumed by the Power Cosmic.Fantastic Four #260 (Nov. 1983) When Tyros and Silver Surfer crash to the ground, they land on and obliterate the helpless Doctor Doom. Suddenly a shopper speaks arrogantly to an elderly woman, who turns out to be Spider-Man's Aunt May. Doctor Doom had, unknown to anybody, transferred his mind into the body of a shopper while leaving the shopper to die in Doctor Doom's body. It is left to the Beyonder to undo this confusing chain of events. In an Avengers annual Terrax is temporarily resurrected to become a member of the second Legion of the Unliving by the Elder of the Universe the Grandmaster.Avengers Annual #16 (1987) Tyros reforms his physical form as Terrax in the title New Warriors, and battles the fledgling superhero team. Terrax is defeated when the heroes, deducing that his form is unstable and that constant contact with earth is required, separate him and thereby his form.New Warriors #1 (Jul. 1990) Terrax reappears when reformed once again by a rogue scientist attempting to steal his power.

In the episode \\"Silver Surfer and the Coming of Galactus\\" Pt. 2, Galactus summons Terrax and Firelord to hold off three of the Fantastic Four while he assembles his machine that will enable him to consume Earth. Terrax fought Thing in battle. Once Galactus finished assembling the device, he sent Terrax and Firelord away. In the episode \\"To Battle the Living Planet\\", Terrax was seen with Galactus when the Fantastic Four arrive to beg Galactus to help them defeat Ego the Living Planet. In the episode \\"When Calls Galactus\\", Terrax tricks Galactus into consuming a poisonous planet and then tries to manipulate the Fantastic Four into finishing off Galactus while in his sick and vulnerable state. The Fantastic Four ultimately choose to help Galactus instead and defeat Terrax. As punishment for Terrax's treachery, Galactus transforms Terrax into a colony of earthworms, which Galactus banishes to Earth. * Terrax appears in The Super Hero Squad Show, voiced by Ted Biaselli.

It is the sequel to the 1996 game Jet Moto. It was released in North America on October 31, 1997, in Europe in April 1998, and in Japan on August 6, 1998. In January 2008 Jet Moto 2 was made available for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network. The PlayStation Greatest Hits version, branded within the game as Jet Moto 2: Championship Edition, is slightly different from the original in that the framerate is increased, the number of competitors is limited to four, and all the original Jet Moto tracks are unlocked from the start. As with Jet Moto, gameplay in Jet Moto 2 revolves around the use of hoverbikes to traverse a race course, similar to modern day motorcross, but with the added ability to traverse water. Reviews for Jet Moto 2 were mixed. Some reviewers were satisfied with the improved controls and variety of tracks over the original, but some found the changes insufficient for what is normally expected of a sequel, and the unusual physics still drew some criticism. Jet Moto 2s popularity would spawn one additional sequel, Jet Moto 3. Gameplay splitscreen gameplay from the original while adding more diversified locales in which to race. Jet Moto 2 retains all of the basic gameplay from its predecessor. Players control hoverbikes which sit close to the ground and can be ridden over land and water. The courses in the game are designed to take advantage of this ability. Characters are split into teams, and bikes are adorned with logos of products such as Mountain Dew and JetSki, similar to real-life sponsored racing. The riders received an overhaul, with only a total of ten selectable characters being available, and subsequently only ten racers on the track at any given time. The number of tracks available greatly increased, with ten new tracks added plus the ability to unlock all of the tracks from the original game. Track designs are more varied in Jet Moto 2, with each level containing a unique theme rather than the shared themes of the original. The courses range from earthquake-damaged cities, to desert canyons, ice-covered mountains, a roller coaster, and several other themes. The difficulty was also increased in Jet Moto 2. In order to conserve CPU cycles for other things the developers used gameplay recordings in place of fully developed racer AI. As a result, most AI racers have a perfect run and any mistakes made by the player result in a quick loss of top racing positions. The PlayStation Greatest Hits version of the game, dubbed Jet Moto 2: Championship Edition further changed the gameplay mechanics. All Jet Moto tracks were immediately unlocked for the player. Additionally, the number of in-game racers would be reduced from ten to only four to allow the game to run at 30 frames per second. Development An unused cover for the Greatest Hits version, with art and text depicting it as the Championship Edition. Jet Moto 2s original cut from 20 competitors to 10 was \\"to open the game up to a broader market, one that wasn‚Äôt driven by hardcore.\\" Chef Boyardee was one of the new sponsors in the game, however the game's producer, Brian Wiklem fought to ensure the sponsor would not be a rider's sponsor. As a result, Chef Boyardee's logo was added to track advertisements throughout the tracks. Of the ten new tracks created for the game, five concepts were designed by SingleTrac, and five by Wiklem and his assistant. Dual Analog Controllers and the accompanying vibration functions were supported for the first time, but DualShock Controllers were not. As with the first Jet Moto, Axiom Design created the user interface shell for the game. Pinnacle Music Group composed the music for the game. Jet Moto 2 would receive localized renames in Europe and Japan. Its European title is Jet Rider 2, and its Japanese title is Jet Moto '98. The Greatest Hits version of the game was never meant to be released in its current form. As the game's production cycle was ending, Wiklem asked SingleTrac to modify the game for him a modified version of Jet Moto 2. This version increased the framerate to 30 frames per second by removing six competitors from races, thus putting less strain on the PlayStation hardware. Additionally, Wiklem requested that all of the original Jet Moto tracks be unlocked at the start of the game. It was branded in-game as Jet Moto 2: Championship Edition. Due to their master disc being destroyed, Sony contacted Wiklem for a copy to use as a master disc for burning. Wiklem sent the altered disc SingleTrac had made for him, notifying Sony of the change and petitioning it be used as the Greatest Hits version. Sony replied that Greatest Hits titles must be the same as the original release version. Dismayed, Wiklem burned a copy of the original version and sent it to Sony for duplication. Due to a mixup in the duplication process, the modified version of the game was duplicated and not the original version. Sony Digital Audio Disc Corporation contacted Sony Computer Entertainment about the mix up, and eventually the discussions trickled down to Wiklem himself. He told vice president of marketing Jeff Fox that he \\"did send the right disc, it was properly labeled, and it‚Äôs not my fault that DADC couldn‚Äôt read.\\" The situation was put to rest shortly thereafter, with the decision being made not to make any further changes to the Greatest Hits disc. Reception Jet Moto 2 received mixed reviews from critics. It held a 70.08% at GameRankings, a video game aggregator, based on 12 reviews. Like Jet Moto, the games popularity would earn it a spot in the PlayStation Greatest Hits. Between the original version and the Greatest Hits Championship Edition, Jet Moto 2 sold over 800,000 copies. Reviewers disagreed on many points about the game. While many praised the new variety of tracks offered, all four reviewers for Electronic Gaming Monthly complained that the tracks are frustratingly confusing and unfair, and Next Generation opined that the track design \\"is not nearly as impressive as the first, if only because it's more of the same.\\" On the positive side, GameSpot stated that the variety of courses \\"take the Jet Moto series yet another step away from the traditional racer.\\" Likewise, while IGN called the physics system \\"even more over-the-top\\" and was pleased that \\"The bike flies about everywhere,\\" GameSpot considered the unexpected results of maneuvers and collisions to be a problem. Though most critics, even in the more negative reviews for the game, cited improved graphics over the original, Next Generation commented that \\"what's most distressing is that the graphics haven't been improved. ... Had Singletrac succeeded in making Jet Moto 2 a brand new game with a look to reflect the year between titles, it would've deserved a higher score. As it is, it's just more of the same, with less innovation.\\" A number of critics also found that it is easy to get disoriented and lose track of where the edges of the course are. Overall opinions also varied to an extent. Contrary to Next Generation, GamePro concluded that while Jet Moto 2 is flawed, it has enough novel features over its predecessor to be worth buying. GameSpot deemed it not quite as good as the original, but still a worthy follow-up. Game Revolution was enthusiastic about the game's play control, though they found the split screen makes the two-player mode too difficult to enjoy. On the more negative end, all four Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewers gave it a 6/10 or lower, with Dan Hsu remarking, \\"It can't be a good thing when, while playing this game, all I can think of are ways to improve it.\\" IGN praised the bike design and challenging A.I., but felt the game was not unique enough from the original, calling it \\"Jet Moto 1.5\\". Legacy Jet Moto 2 was the last game developed by SingleTrac for publisher Sony Computer Entertainment. Pacific Coast Power & Light developed Jet Moto 3, with 989 Sports publishing the third title. Jet Moto 3 was released August 31, 1999 exclusively in North America. To date it is the last title in the series to be released. Two other titles were cancelled during their development. Pacific Coast Power & Light was also developing Jet Moto 2124 for the PlayStation, set over a century after the first three games, however the game was cancelled when Jet Moto 3 showed poor sales. Jet Moto: SOLAR, developed by RedZone Interactive, was also cancelled. SOLAR would have been the first title in the series to appear on the PlayStation 2.

Maurice Ravel apparently said of Antonio Jos√©: \\"He will become the Spanish composer of our century\\", however, his music lay forgotten until the 1980s. Career Born in Burgos, Antonio Jos√© became a music teacher at a Jesuit school and conducted the city choir in Burgos. The sheer volume of his work (he died at 33) was prodigious. He penned his first composition when he was 14. He was hired as a director of a musical review in Burgos at the age of 18. He wrote extensively for voice in his quest to present the melodies of his native Burgos to the world. His compositions, especially the Sinfon√≠a castellana and Suite Ingenua, put his orchestration on a par with anything at the time in the twentieth century. His most famous work is a sonata for guitar. His harmonic understanding put him in the forefront of post-impressionist composers, and though a disciple of Ravel, his particular voice and choice of medium set him distinctly apart. His chief biographer, Miguel √Ångel Palacios Garoz, points out that Antonio Jos√© was not only a prolific composer but a writer with an intellectually facile mind that was open to influences from all fronts of contemporary music. He met the same fate as Federico Garc√≠a Lorca: he was executed by a Falangist firing squad in 1936 at Est√©par (Burgos). References *Gilardino, Angelo (1990).

As with spaulders, pauldrons cover the shoulder area. Pauldrons tend to be larger than spaulders, covering the armpit, and sometimes parts of the back and chest. A pauldron typically consists of a single large dome-shaped piece to cover the shoulder (the \\"cop\\") with multiple lames attached to it, to defend the arm and upper shoulder. On some suits of armour, especially those of Italian design, the pauldrons would usually be asymmetrical, with one pauldron covering less (for mobility) and sporting a cut-away to make room for a lance rest.  Jousting  The pauldron of a knight was also important in jousts. While the most points in a jousting competition were scored by unhorsing the opponent or striking the lance, points could also be scored if a lance was to hit the enemy pauldron, albeit for lesser points than a true strike. Many pauldron styles made use of a lance rest to assist in the joust, allowing the knight an area to ready the lance for stronger blows. The pauldron would typically be cut shorter to allow for this rest, without restricting the arm mobility or the protection of the rider. Typically only the right pauldron would support this cut-away, as this was the lance arm of the knights contending in a joust. Typical tournament armor for jousting would be padded with cloth to minimize injury from an opponent's lance and prevent the metal of the pauldron from scraping against the breastplate. This protective cloth padding would extend about half an inch from the rolled edge of the armor, and it was secured in place with rivets along the entire edge. In battle, this cloth protection could not be too thick, else the knight would have no arm mobility. However, in a safer tournament setting, mobility was less important compared to safety, thus leading to heavier padding. In fact, knights in this era could be padded to the point where they look \\"more wide than tall\\", as compared with contemporary depictions of jousting armor.  In popular culture  Plate pauldrons tend to be found as a common armor type in many fantasy or science fiction worlds. This can be done for in-world reasons such as denoting a character's rank or culture, or merely due to aesthetic reasons by the artist. A well-known example of this is in the Star Wars universe, where colors of the pauldrons may denote a clone or stormtrooper's rank or role. An orange-colored pauldron is used to identify a stormtrooper officer, compared to the plain white of the regular forces. Additionally, a White pauldron denotes a sergeant or similar- ranked soldier. The pauldron in The Mandalorian's first episode is the first upgrade made to the Mandalorian's armor in the series and a legacy of Boba Fett's original armor. Another more aesthetic example would be the space marines from the Warhammer 40,000 universe, famous for their strong builds and oversized armor. These massive armor pieces it seems would be used both for deflection of enemy fire and housing important components to the exoskeleton as a whole.

It was the only Jet Moto title released by developer Locomotive Games and publisher 989 Sports. It has been released only in North America. It was released on the PlayStation Network on February 21, 2008 but was removed shortly thereafter for undisclosed reasons. The game received moderately positive reviews, averaging 75.75% at video game aggregate site GameRankings. Reviewers generally praised the game's visuals, considering them an improvement over the previous installments. Jet Moto 3 is the last title to date in the Jet Moto series. Two additional sequels, Jet Moto 2124 and Jet Moto: SOLAR were cancelled during development. Gameplay Weather effects, along with other graphical improvements were included in Jet Moto 3. Gameplay in Jet Moto 3 differs from that of a traditional racing game with cars or motorcycles. Players instead control hoverbikes which sit close to the ground and can be ridden over land and water. Most of the courses in the game are designed to take advantage of this ability. Characters are split into teams, and bikes are adorned with logos of products such as Mountain Dew and Doritos, similar to real-life sponsored racing. Ten characters are available from the beginning of the game with two more unlockable. This Jet Moto is notable for the inclusion of new stunt tracks. The objective of these tracks is to perform stunts to gain higher points and to collect coins scattered throughout the track. Another notable inclusion is the \\"hop\\" button, which is used to boost your player above the ground to avoid obstacles. The physics of the jet moto bikes were also changed, with the bikes reaching much higher speed than the two previous games. Weather was also introduced into the series, with jet moto riders racing in the rain and in other weathered environments. Track themes vary greatly, with tracks taking places in volcanic islands, catacombs, the heights of Machu Pichu, and a thick Sequoia forest. Development Jet Moto 3 would be the first and only released Jet Moto title by developer Pacific Coast Power & Light and publisher 989 Sports. SingleTrac had been purchased by GT Interactive, and the original developers had no interest in doing a third Jet Moto title. According to former 989 Sports president Kelly Flock, Pacific Coast Power & Light was \\"nearby and cheap\\" and was headed by Don Traeger, who had formerly worked on the Road Rash series, so the decision was made to use that studio for development. Unlike its predecessor, the game supported the DualShock Controller. The previous game only supported the Dual Analog controller with Rumble feedback. The Jet Moto 3 graphics engine and developer toolkit were built from the ground up by lead programmer Ming Lee. Lee was challenged to increase the framerate and graphic quality of the game. To do so he decomposed the opcodes of the PlayStation's graphics processor and rewrote some of the PlayStation's library calls. This in essence allowed Lee to access the PlayStation hardware as he saw fit, allowing him to optimize his code specifically to his hardware calls. In doing so, however, the developers broke compatibility with first generation PlayStation consoles, something that was not caught until after the game was released. Fellow programmer Matt Gaston focused his energies on AI, physics and user interface programming. With programming optimizations in place, developers were able to use the additional power to add weather effects previously unheard of. Lee noted in an interview with PlayStation Museum that rain particles \\"actually streak in 3D according to your camera speed\\", noting that other games used a 2D effect on the game's HUD to produce the effect of rain. Colored fog was also shown in one level, something that the PlayStation console could not do natively, and had only previously been seen in one game, Spyro the Dragon. Real time lighting was also added to the game. Jet Moto 3 would also use CGI cutscenes for the game's introduction, a first for the Jet Moto series. It was released on the PlayStation Network on February 21, 2008 but was removed shortly thereafter for undisclosed reasons. Reception Jet Moto 3 was fairly well received, averaging 75.75% at gaming aggregate site GameRankings. It ranked tenth in the top ten racing titles for June 2000 according to the NPD Group, however sales did not continue to hold strong. Doug Trueman reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"In a season with relatively new worthwhile PlayStation racing games, Jet Moto 3 proves to be fast, furious racing fun.\\" Reviewers were mixed on the opinion of the game's visuals. Game Revolution called the graphics \\"a vast improvement over the grainy, somewhat choppy visuals of Jet Moto and Jet Moto 2.\\" IGN also praised the Jet Moto 3s visuals, citing a vastly improved framerate and draw distance than Jet Moto and Jet Moto 2. GameSpot, however felt the graphical details were poor, citing that the game's environments were \\"nice and pretty unless you get too close.\\" The CGI cutscenes were also panned by GameSpot, calling it \\"frightful\\" and stating \\"none of the characters look even fractionally human.\\" Game Informer praised the new stunt tracks, stating that they \\"will capture hours of your playtime.\\" Electric Playground spoke highly of the game's soundtrack, stating that the varied types of music fit each track's location and environment. They further praised Jet Moto 3 as superior to the other titles, calling the first two games \\"notoriously bug- ridden.\\" The Official UK PlayStation Magazine said the opposite, giving the game 3/10, while the previous game received 8/10. Legacy Jet Moto 3 would be the last game in the series to be released. 989 Studios and Pacific Coast Power & Light were working on a fourth Jet Moto title, dubbed Jet Moto 2124, for the PlayStation; however, the game was cancelled when Jet Moto 3 showed poor sales. Jet Moto 2124 was to be set over a century after the first three games. Jet Moto: SOLAR, developed by RedZone Interactive, was also cancelled. SOLAR would have been the first title in the series to appear on the PlayStation 2.

It is also an important consideration for people who are creating time capsules, family history, historical documents, scrapbooks and family trees. Common storage media are not permanent, and there are few reliable methods of preserving documents and pictures for the future. Paper/prints (photos) Color negatives and ordinary color prints may fade away to nothing in a relatively short period if not stored and handled properly. This happens even if the negatives and prints are kept in the dark, because ambient light is not the determining factor, but heat and humidity are. The color degradation is the result of the dyes used in the color processes. Because color processing results in a less stable image than traditional black-and-white processing, black-and-white pictures from the 1920s are more likely to survive long-term than color films and photographs from after the middle 20th century. Black-and-white photographic films using silver halide emulsions are the only film types that have proven to last for archival storage. The determining factors for longevity include the film base type, proper processing (develop, stop, fix and wash) and proper storage. Early films used a Cellulose nitrate base which was prone to decomposition and highly flammable. Nitrate film was replaced with acetate-base films. These Cellulose acetate films were later discovered to outgass acids (also referred to as vinegar syndrome). Acetate films were replaced in the early 1980s by polyester film base materials which have been determined to be more stable than film stocks with a nitrate or acetate base. Color prints made on most inkjet printers look very good at first but they have a very short lifespan, measured in months rather than in years. Even prints from commercial photo labs will start to fade in a matter of years if not processed properly and stored in cool, dry environments. Documents/books With documents for which the media are not so critical as what the documents contain, the information in documents can be copied by using photocopiers and image scanners. Books and manuscripts can also have their information saved without destruction by using a book scanner. Where the medium itself needs to be preserved, for example if a document is a crayon sketch by a famous artist on paper, a complex process of preservation may be used. Depending on the condition and importance of the item this can include gluing the media onto more stable media, or protective enclosing of the media. Polyester sleeves, acid-free folders, and pH buffered document boxes are common supportive protective enclosures whose selection must match the media's chemical and physical properties. Other considerations in preserving paper/books are: * Damaging light, particularly UV light, which fades and destroys media over time by breaking down the molecules. * Atmosphere contains small traces of sulfur dioxide and nitric acid which turn media yellow and break the fibers down. * Humidity and moisture also aid in the breakdown of media. If there is too much, the document can be attacked by bacteria, and if too little, cellulose material breaks down. * Temperature, particularly elevated ones, can destroy some media. Low temperatures can cause the water to form crystals which expands destroying the structure of paper- based documents. Online photo albums Although there are many websites that allow the upload of photographs and videos, digital preservation for the long- term is still an issue.

Technologists have pointed to internet streaming media, where services such as video-on- demand have contributed to the 33 percent decline in DVD sales the past 5 years, as a challenge for digital preservation. Magnetic media - video cassettes, tapes, hard drives Magnetic media such as audio and video tape and floppy disks also have limited life spans. Audio and video tapes require specific care and handling to ensure that the recorded information will be preserved. For information that must be preserved indefinitely, periodic transcription from old media to new ones is necessary, not only because the media are unstable but also because the recording technology may become obsolete. A badly molded VHS tape. Mold can grow due to humidity on the storage space, and then prevent modern usage. Magnetic media also deteriorates naturally with typical shelf lives between 10 and 20 years.Broadway Video Digital Media, \\"Causes and Measurement of Videotape Decay,\\" http://sportsvideo.org/main/files/2010/08/video-tape-white-paper.pdf Magnetic tape can degrade from binder hydrolysis or magnetic remanence decay. Binder hydrolysis, also known as sticky-shed syndrome, refers to the breakdown of binder, or glue, that holds the magnetic particles to the polyester base of the tape. Tapes which have been stored in hot, humid conditions are particularly vulnerable to this phenomenon and may suffer from accelerated degradation. Severe binder can cause the magnetic material to fall off or sheds from the base, leaving a pile of dust and clear backing. Archivists can bake the tape, which evaporates water molecules on the tape, to temporarily restore the binder before making a copy. Magnetic tape can also be destabilized by magnetic remanence decay, which refers to the weakening of the tape's magnetization over time. This weakens the affect tape's readability, leading to reduced sound clarity and volume or picture hue and contrast. Baking the tape will not restore magnetization. Archivists might instead digitally encode a copy of the tape, preserving its content as a digital data file. Media at risk include recorded media such as master audio recordings of symphonies and videotape recordings of the news gathered over the last 40 years. Threats to media that must be considered when archiving important record media include accidental erasure, physical loss due to disasters such as fires and floods, and media degradation. Along with the actual media being degraded over the years, the machines that are available to play back or reproduce the audio sources are becoming archaic themselves. Manufacturers and their support (parts, technical updates) for their machines have disappeared throughout the years. Even if the medium is vaulted and archived correctly, the mechanical properties of the machines have deteriorated to the point that they could do more harm than good to the tape being played. Many major film studios are now backing up their libraries by converting them to electronic media files, such as .AIFF or .WAV-based files via digital audio workstations. That way, even if the digital platform manufacturer goes out of business or no longer supports their product, the files can still be played on any common computer. There is a detailed process that must take place previous to the final archival product now that a digital solution is in place. Sample rates and their conversion and reference speed are both critical in this process. In floppy disks, the lubricants inside the plastic jackets of many older floppies promote the decay of the magnetic medium. Also, the alignment of the magnetic particles of the disk substrate may gradually degrade, leading to a loss of formatting and data. Early laser disk media were prone to degradation as the layers of the disk substrate were bonded with an adhesive that was vulnerable to decay and would crumble over time. This would lead the different layers of the disk to peel apart, damaging the pitted data surface and rendering the disk unreadable.

It is the sequel to The King of Fighters '94 and the second game in The King of Fighters series. It is also the first game in the series to be ported to other home consoles besides the Neo Geo AES and Neo-Geo CD thus making SNK a second-party developer, with versions released for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn and Game Boy. It was also rereleased in The King of Fighters Collection: The Orochi Saga in 2008 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Wii. The game features a similar cast to KOF '94 with the exception of the USA Team, which was replaced by the Rival Team. The plot features a new King of Fighters tournament once again promoted by the criminal Rugal Bernstein, who wants to take revenge against Kyo Kusanagi, who defeated him in last year's tournament. The game also introduces a sub-boss character, Saisyu Kusanagi, who is the father of Kyo. KOF '95 also introduces the fighter Iori Yagami, who becomes Kyo's rival in the series. One of the main focuses in the creation of The King of Fighters '95 was the introduction of the Rivals Team, most notably Iori, who became one of the favorite characters from the staff. The game has received mixed reviews from various video games publications. Most writers have complained about the response from controls and long loading times from the PlayStation port. However, the introduction from the enhanced version of Rugal, Omega Rugal, as well as the differences between all the characters have been noted to be one of the best parts from the game. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot showcasing a match between Athena Asamiya and Iori Yagami. The gameplay and rules are mostly unchanged from The King of Fighters '94. The main addition is the introduction of the Team Edit feature, allowing the player to create a custom team from any of the game's twenty-four characters in addition to the pre-defined teams in the game. Through the main play mode, players must defeat all of the teams from the game in order to fight the bosses: the brainwashed Saisyu Kusanagi, followed by a stronger Rugal Bernstein. Plot and characters The King of Fighters '95 marks the beginning of a story arc that later became known as the \\"Orochi Saga\\". However, the only elements from the Orochi Saga known in this game is the introduction of Kyo's rival, Iori Yagami, and Rugal's use of the Orochi power. Rugal Bernstein, thought to have perished in an explosion in the previous game, had in fact survived and sent out invitations to the teams from the previous game signed simply ‚ÄòR'. Only one of the previous teams failed to attend the new tournament: the American Sports Team, now replaced by the \\"Rival Team\\" consisting of Iori Yagami, Billy Kane (from Fatal Fury: King of Fighters), and Eiji Kisaragi (from Art of Fighting 2). Saisyu Kusanagi, Kyo's father, appears as a fighter for the first time (having made a non-playable cameo in KOF '94) as a computer-controlled sub-boss character. After defeating Saisyu in the arcade mode, it is revealed that Saisyu was being brainwashed and that Rugal will fight once again as a boss character, but as an enhanced version named \\"Omega Rugal\\". Development The KOF '95 project began with the concept of introducing Iori Yagami as Kyo Kusanagi's rival. As such, developers gave him traits to expand that relationship such as similar abilities and ancient rivalry between both of their clans. During the initial location tests to determine the popularity of the game, Iori was the character who stood out most, also becoming a favorite of the developers. The creation of the Rival Team was one of the things developers worked the hardest, focusing in their moves and lines. The character of Eiji Kisaragi was originally from Art of Fighting 2 and the staff had to adjust most of his moves to balance him with the other characters. Following this game, several Art of Fighting characters were removed from each sequel with developers saying it was \\"thanks to KOF jinx.\\" The sub-boss character, Saisyu Kusanagi, was never meant to appear in the game as the staff wanted to make so that he died in The King of Fighters '94 during one of the cut-scenes from the Hero Team. However, Saisyu was added at the last moment to the game, becoming the sub-boss character. Fatal Fury boss character Geese Howard was meant to be playable in the game; various considerations at the time, however, led developers to abandon this plan. The King of Fighters '95 was one of the first titles from SNK to be ported to the Sony PlayStation system. Chad Okada, a former member from SNK, mentioned it was one of his first works. He commented that he had to improve its marketability to the North American market. As a result, he added new options to the game that were not present in the original Japanese version such as selection from stages and improve the grammar and spelling, which was one of the biggest issues from the Neo Geo version. Release The original Japanese arcade version was released on July 25, 1995 and it was ported to the Neo Geo and Neo-Geo CD later that year. A port of the Neo Geo release was added to Wii's Virtual Console service on April 26, 2010. It is slightly edited, however; the blood is removed and Mai lacks her signature bounce, both in her fighting stance and win animation. Both of these aspects can be activated with a code, however. In 1996, the game was ported to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. The PlayStation version was published on August 31, 1996 in North America and the PAL region by Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.. It featured a remixed soundtrack which took advantage of the Redbook audio format. The Saturn version (which required a ROM cartridge that came packaged with the game disc) was also released in Europe by Sega. The bundled ROM cartridge contains the majority of the character animations. It was the first video game to use a CD-ROM and a ROM cartridge in tandem. The PlayStation version appeared in Europe ahead of the Saturn version due to a timed exclusivity deal between SNK and Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. The \\"Playstation the Best\\" version was also re-released on March 28, 1997. It was also compiled in The King of Fighters Collection: The Orochi Saga in 2008 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Wii. A Game Boy game based on The King of Fighters '95 (Nett≈ç The King of Fighters '95 in Japan) was published by Takara in Japan and by Nintendo in North America. It featured compatibility with the Super Game Boy, as well as introducing Nakoruru from the Samurai Shodown series as a secret character. A Nintendo Switch port of \\"The King of Fighters '95\\" was released worldwide on October 12, 2017. =Related media= The game received a variety of licensed media released in Japan in 1994‚Äì1995:The King of Fighters '95 at Arcade Gear. *Original soundtrack The King of Fighters '95 (PCCB-00187) and arranged soundtrack The King of Fighters '95 Arrange Sound Trax (PCCB-00189), both released by Pony Canyon. *Guide books The King of Fighters '95 Graphical Manual (GMC-14) by Shinseisha, The King of Fighters '95 Neo Geo Hissh≈ç H≈ç Special () by Keibunsha, and The King of Fighters '95 Perfect Guide Book () by Shinseisha. *4-koma manga collections The King of Fighters '95 4-Koma Ketteiban () and The King of Fighters '95 4-Koma Ketteiban Side 2 (), created by fans and professional artists and published by Shinseisha. *VHS video The King of Fighters '95 () by Shinseisha. *Guide/art books The King of Fighters '95: Official Guide Book for the Ultimate Fighters () by Aspect and The King of Fighters '95 Complete Manual by Shinseisha. *Manga short story compilation The King of Fighters '95 Comic Anthology (), created by various artists and published by Shinseisha. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed The King of Fighters '95 on their September 1, 1995 issue as being the second most-successful arcade game of the year. The King of Fighters '95 was awarded Best Neo-Geo Game of 1995 by Electronic Gaming Monthly in 1996. During its release week, the Sega Saturn port of the game sold 135,214 copies in Japan. As of 2004, the game remained with 257,294 copies sold. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly declared the Neo Geo AES version a solid improvement over the previous King of Fighters, particularly applauding the addition of the team edit feature. Major Mike of GamePro agreed that this was the game's best feature, but also expressed approval for the replacement of the U.S. team with the new \\"Rival\\" team and the control modifications. He did criticize that the game \\"didn't improve '94's graphics, it just added to them\\", but concluded King of Fighters '95 to be \\"one of the best brawlers out there\\". A reviewer for Next Generation was unimpressed, however, remarking that \\"The idea behind fighting as a three- person team ... adds an interesting flare to the game, but the final result is still a one-on-one fighting game with nothing much new to offer the seasoned fighter.\\" Reviewing the Neo Geo CD version, Maximum deemed that \\"SNK remain masters of the sprite-based one-on-one fighting genre, leaving all competitors way behind with King of Fighters '95.\\" They elaborated that the team combat makes for greater variety than the average fighting game, the team edit feature greatly increases the game's enjoyability and longevity, the unusually high difficulty of executing combos makes pulling them off more satisfying, and the animations are greatly improved from The King of Fighters '94. The PlayStation version, however, was much less well received, as reviewers stated it has poor design in comparison to other fighting games from the same year. IGN criticized that the characters are not very responsive to controls and \\"even though these are difficult hurdles to jump, they're not impossible\\". However, they noted it to be a likeable game, saying it has \\"that 2D anime look that everyone loves\\". A reviewer for Next Generation said that the PlayStation version compounded the game's lack of fresh and original gameplay with long load times. Jeff Gerstmann from GameSpot also criticized the long loading times from the PlayStation version as well as how frequent they are since every round requires loading time. Game Revolution noted the game to be very entertaining but still not as good as other fighting games from the year it was released in North America. They criticized that the fighting system is very similar to other SNK games such as Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting. However, Scary Larry defended the PlayStation version in GamePro, saying it \\"plays well, looks good, and sounds the same as the arcade version. You could do worse.\\" 1UP.com praised the introduction of Omega Rugal, noting him to be \\"one of the most stylish boss designs in fighting history\\", although players could hate him due to how difficult it is to defeat him. Rich Leadbetter of Sega Saturn Magazine stated that the Saturn port is nearly arcade perfect, the ROM cartridge enabling it to recreate the look of the arcade version with only brief load times. He found the level of skill and technique involved in the game to be both its strongest point and the main limiting factor on its appeal: \\"SNK fans swear blind that King of Fighters is far superior to Street Fighter Alpha (and its sequel) simply because the element of skill required is that much tougher - making the rewards that much sweeter. The majority of us are unlikely to reach that pinnacle of skill ... but the fact is that if you're good enough, it remains one of the greatest fighting games of all time.\\" He added that while The King of Fighters '96 was already out for the Saturn in Japan, the two installments are different enough from each other that it is worth getting both. IGN commented that the characters' designs and abilities are very similar to the ones from Street Fighter Alpha. Jeff Gerstmann complained that the characters have unattractive moves as well and over pixelated sprites. 1UP.com praised SNK's characters designs and the addition of the team edit option, making the game a good competition for Street Fighter Alpha. However, Game Revolution liked the large number of playable characters and the several options featured in the game such as the team fights and special moves. Game designer Masahiro Sakurai regarded the game as one of his favorite competitive experiences when being young. However, after realizing he had been defeating rookies, Sakurai decided that fighting games should also be accessible to newcomers.

Prototypes of the unit were deployed at large test markets in parts of the United States and Europe in 1994 and 1995, but the product was canceled shortly thereafter, and was never mass-produced or marketed. Overview Back side of the unit The AITB was designed as an interface between a consumer and an interactive television service. The unit's remote control would allow a user to choose what content would be shown on a connected television, and to seek with fast forward and rewind. In this regard it is similar to a modern satellite receiver or TiVo unit. The box would only pass along the user's choices to a central content server for streaming instead of issuing content itself. There were also plans for game shows, educational material for children, and other forms of content made possible by the interactive qualities of the device. Early conceptual prototypes have an unfinished feel. Near-completion units have a high production quality, the internal components often lack prototype indicators, and some units have FCC approval stickers. These facts, along with a full online manual suggest the product was very near completion before being canceled. =Infrastructure= Because the machine was designed to be part of a subscription data service, the AITB units are mostly inoperable. The ROM contains only what is required to continue booting from an external hard drive or from its Ethernet connection. Many of the prototypes do not appear to even attempt to boot. This is likely dependent on changes in the ROM. The ROM itself contains parts of a downsized Mac OS 7.1 enabling it to establish a network connection to the media servers provided by Oracle. The Oracle Media Server (OMS) initially ran on hardware produced by Larry Ellison's nCube Systems company, but was later also made available by Oracle on SGI, Alpha, Sun, SCO, Netware, Windows NT, and AIX systems. These servers also provided the parts of the OS not implemented in ROM of the AITB via the OMS Boot Service. Therefore, an AITB must establish a network connection successfully in order to finish the boot process. There have been cases of users entering in a command key combination, to get the AITB to boot off of a preinstalled System 7.1 on an external SCSI hard drive, using a PowerBook SCSI adapter (not a SCSI Disk Mode-enabled adapter, but one just for external hard drives). In July 2016, images were published on a video game forum that appear to show a Super Nintendo Entertainment System cartridge designed to work with the British Telecom variant of the AITB. The cartridge is labeled \\"BT GameCart\\" and includes an 8-pin serial connector designed to connect to the Apple System/Peripheral 8 port on the rear of the box. A BT promotional film for the service trial discusses a way users could download and play Nintendo video games via the system. =Specifications= The Apple Interactive Television Box is based upon the Macintosh Quadra 605 or LC 475. Because the box was never marketed, not all specifications have been stated by Apple. It supports MPEG-2 Transport containing ISO11172 (MPEG-1) bit streams, Apple Desktop Bus, RF in and out, S-Video out, RCA audiovideo out, RJ-45 connector for either E1 data stream on PAL devices or T1 data stream on NTSC devices, serial port, and HDI-30 SCSI. Apple intended to offer the AITB with a matching black ADB mouse, keyboard, Apple 300e CD-ROM drive, StyleWriter printer, and one of several styles of remote controls. The hard drive contains parts of a regular North American Mac OS 7.1.1 with Finder, several sockets for network connection protocols, and customized MPEG1 decoding components for the QuickTime Player software. History A few units contain a special boot ROM which allows the device to boot locally from a SCSI hard drive that has the OS and applications contained within the box; these devices were used primarily by developers inside Apple and Oracle, and for limited demonstration purposes. In normal network use, content and program code was served to the box by Oracle OMS over the network to implement the box's interactivity. A few hundred to a few thousand units were deployed at Disneyland California hotels and provided in room shopping and park navigation. Approximately 2500 units were installed and used in consumer homes in England during the second interactive television trial conducted by British Telecom and Oracle, which was in Ipswich, UK. The set-top applications were developed using Oracle's Oracle Media Objects (OMO) product, which is somewhat similar to HyperCard, but was enhanced significantly to operate in a network-based interactive TV environment.

It is the fourth game in The King of Fighters series. It was ported to the Neo-Geo CD, as well as the PlayStation and the Sega Saturn in Japan only. An updated version \\"Global Match\\" featuring online multiplayer was released in 2018 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita and Steam. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot showcasing a match between Shermie in Extra Mode battling Ralf Jones in Advanced Mode. KOF '97 follows the same format as the previous KOF games, but introduces two distinct playing styles which the player can select before choosing their team: Advanced and Extra. Advanced mode is based on the previous game in the series, KOF '96, but features a revamped Power Gauge. Instead of charging the Power Gauge, the Power Gauge is now filled whenever the player strikes the opponent or by performing Special Moves. The player can stock up to three Power Gauges. The player can use one stock of the Power Gauge to perform a Super Special Move or enter a \\"MAX\\" mode, in which the players defensive and offensive strength are increased. Performing a Super Special Move while in MAX mode will make the player perform a more powerful Super Special Move. Extra mode is based on the first two games in the series, KOF '94 and KOF '95. Like in those games, the player fills the Power Gauge by charging it or defending against the opponents attacks. After the gauge is filled, the player enters MAX mode and like in Advanced, their character's offense and defense will increase. The player can only perform Super Special Moves in MAX mode or when the life gauge is near empty and flashing red. When the player performs a Super move in MAX mode while the life gauge is flashing red, then the Super move will be even more powerful. The Emergency Roll maneuver from KOF '96 used in Advanced mode is replaced by the side-step from KOF '94 and KOF '95. Plot and characters Despite the events at the end of the previous game, the KOF tournament was a huge commercial success and sparked a worldwide fighting craze. Within a few months of the tournament ending, various large corporations had held smaller KOF tournament qualifiers and constructed special KOF stadiums around the world, building the excitement up for the next tournament. News of the tournament spread through every form of media and fans and new fighters from across the globe come to watch the preliminary matches. All of the characters from the previous game return, with the exception of the Boss Team (which was disbanded after its first appearance), Kasumi Todoh (who went off to search for her father), and Mature and Vice (who were killed by Iori Yagami after he was possessed by the Riot of Blood at the conclusion of the previous game). Chizuru Kagura, the sub-boss in the previous game, takes Kasumis place in the Women Fighters Team, while Geese Howard's underling Billy Kane, who previously participated in The King of Fighters '95 tournament, returns to join forces with female agent Blue Mary and wanted felon Ryuji Yamazaki (both from Fatal Fury 3) to form the unlikely \\"'97 Special Team\\". Iori returns as a Team Edit character along with Shingo Yabuki, a high school student who patterns his fighting style after his idol and reluctant mentor Kyo Kusanagi. An alternative version of Kyo with his pre- KOF '96 moveset also appears as a hidden character. Iori and Leona will fight as mid-boss characters in the Riot of the Blood curse depending of which characters the player is using. A team of all new characters also appears in the form of the \\"New Faces Team\\", consisting of bandmates Yashiro Nanakase, Shermie, and Chris. The New Faces Team will be revealed to be the last three servants from Orochi during the Arcade Mode. Additionally, they fight as sub- boss characters having enhanced abilities than their common forms. Once they are beaten, Orochi will possess Chris' body to fight as the final boss character. Development In order to decide who would become the members of the '97 Special Team, three polls were conducted by the video game journals Weekly Famitsu, Gamest and Neo Geo Freak, in which readers voted who was the character they wanted to see in the team. The Neo Geo Freak's winner was Billy Kane and Famitsu's winner was Ryuji Yamazaki. Blue Mary was first in the Gamest poll, barely beating Duck King from the Fatal Fury series who was second in the poll via a few mere votes. Additionally, the three journals created a team, which players can view an image of them after beating the game in the Japanese version. The special team created by the Neo Geo Freak's staff was a team of fire wielders: Billy, Kyo Kusanagi, and Mai Shiranui. The Gamest's team created was composed of Terry Bogard, Blue Mary and Joe Higashi, while Famitsu created a team composed of Chang Koehan, Choi Bounge and Ryuji Yamazaki. Although Blue Mary already had two designs in the Fatal Fury series at this point (her original Fatal Fury 3 design and her Real Bout Special design), her designer wanted to use her Fatal Fury 3 design as he liked it more. In order to have all of the eight servants from Orochi confirmed by this game, Yamazaki was chosen to be the new member as the staff noted him to be a good villain and liked that he was similar to a snake (as the ancient Orochi was a giant snake). In order to adapt him to KOF, the game planner had to provide new moves to Yamazaki. The new moves were initially noted to be failures, but designers later thought of them as successful. The New Faces Team was created to offset the remaining top three characters. Their members were developed to be the Hero Team's counterparts; Chris manipulates fire like Kyo, Shermie uses lightning like Benimaru Nikaido and Yashiro Nanakase is a giant man like Goro Daimon. The plot element of Chris acting as Orochi's new body was developed since initial stages of production, but the staff had already thought of using other ideas. At the inception of production, the plan was for Chris to use the \\"Flame of Darkness (Black Flame),\\" but due to difficulties of seeing the black flame in the screen it was changed to the purple ones. The final boss character, Orochi, was first meant to be \\"a buck- naked Chris\\" fighting with a shining energy ball. However, it was opted to his current design after developers made a survey in which there were only two votes in favor of the first design. His design codename was \\"Chief\\", but several people were against of giving him the name of \\"Orochi\\". Iori Yagami in his Orochi form was originally meant to be the final boss of the game after the player beats the New Faces Team in their Orochi forms. However, it was later decided to make Orochi Iori the mid-boss with Orochi becoming the final boss and the New Faces Team as the sub-bosses. Series flagship director, Toyohisa Tanabe, states that the staff was initially reluctant to add this version of Iori to the series' roster ‚Äî worried about fans' reactions ‚Äî but did so to add more impact to the Orochi Saga's climax. He was particularly pleased to see surprised reactions from female fans to this form during KOF '97's location testing. After deciding Iori as the mid-boss character, developers also were focused in adding Leona as an alternative mid-boss character if players were already using Iori in the game. As such, several advertisements were added such as televisions broadcasts, sent to be given as a message to the player about a \\"fork in the game\\" to give hints about Orochi Leona. In The King of Fighters '96, several moves from Kyo were changed in order to adapt him to the new game system. However, the original moveset was still popular between gamers and as such, an alternative version from Kyo was added to KOF '97. The introduction of this version was noted to be \\"a hit\\" with gamers. The staff kept adding new alternative versions of other characters to the sequels. This later led to the creation of the Kyo clones (Kyo-1 and Kyo-2) from The King of Fighters '99. Release The King of Fighters '97 was first released in Japanese arcades on July 28, 1997. It was ported to the Neo Geo and Neo-Geo CD on September 25, 1997 and October 30, 1997, respectively. A PlayStation version was also released on May 28, 1998. The Sega Saturn version was published on March 26, 1998 and it requires the same 1MB RAM cartridge utilized by the previous game. A \\"Saturn Best Collection\\" was released on October 1, 1998, adding a new cover and a lower price. It was also compiled in The King of Fighters Collection: The Orochi Saga in 2008 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Wii. During its release week, the Sega Saturn port of the game sold 94,327 copies in Japan. As of 2004, the sales went to 156,717. The PlayStation port sold 160,124 units. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed The King of Fighters '97 on their September 1, 1997 issue as being the second most-successful arcade game of the year.

It was advertised by SNK as a \\"special edition\\" of the series, as it featured most of the characters who appeared in the previous games (from KOF '94 to '97). KOF '98 was ported to the Neo-Geo CD in 1998 and for the PlayStation in Japan in 1999. A Dreamcast version titled The King of Fighters: Dream Match 1999 was released in 1999, which featured much of the background remade in 3D. The game was also remade for the PlayStation 2 as The King of Fighters '98: Ultimate Match, which expanded the number of playable characters, further tweaked the gameplay and featured a third fighting style option. KOF '98 has been commonly praised by several video game publications as the best KOF from the series due to its graphics and gameplay.  Gameplay  A match between Rugal Bernstein and Yashiro Nanakase battling in Advanced Mode. The gameplay does not differ much from the previous game, KOF '97. Like in KOF '97, the player has a choice between two playing styles: Advance and Extra, with a few slight modifications to Advanced mode (unlike in KOF '97, the character will resume to normal if the player performs a Super Special Move in MAX state). This time when one character loses a round, the losing team is given a handicap in its favor. In Advanced mode, this means that the players stock capacity for Power Gauges is increased by one. In Extra mode, the time it takes to charge ones power gauge to maximum level is shortened, and the maximum remaining health requirement for a MAX Super Special Move is increased. Characters All the regular characters from the previous game return, along with several characters from preceding installments such as Vice and Mature (Iori's teammates from KOF '96), the American Sports Team (Heavy D!, Lucky Glauber, and Brian Battler) from KOF '94, and the Old Men Team (or Veteran Fighters Team) composed of Heidern, Takuma Sakazaki, and Saisyu Kusanagi, all characters whose last appearances were in KOF '95. Rugal Bernstein from KOF '94 also returns as a Team Edit character, with his alter- ego Omega Rugal (the cyborg version of Rugal from KOF '95) serving as the game's final boss in the Single Player Mode. Shingo Yabuki (who originally appeared in KOF '97) continues as a Team Edit character, but also appears as a mid-boss character during the Arcade Mode. Additionally, the characters of Kyo Kusanagi, Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, Joe Higashi, Ryo Sakazaki, Yuri Sakazaki and Robert Garcia are playable with movesets from previous titles of KOF, while the alternate ones of Mai Shiranui and Billy Kane are based on their moveset from Real Bout Fatal Fury 2: The Newcomers. Development In The King of Fighters '96, several moves from Kyo Kusanagi were changed in order to adapt him to the new game system. However, the original moveset was still popular between gamers and as such, an alternative version of Kyo was added to The King of Fighters '97. The introduction of this version was noted to be \\"a hit\\" within gamers, the staff kept adding new alternative versions of other characters in KOF '98. Since this game did not have a storyline, the SNK staff decided to return Rugal Bernstein as the boss character noting that \\"he's the only character who truly represents the ultimate KOF boss.\\" Additionally, some of his special moves were redesigned, which the staff found to have made him the strongest version of Rugal as well as one of their favorites. Release Example of an arcade cabinet of the game. The cabinet's screen shows Kyo Kusanagi performing the 100-shiki: Oniyaki on Iori Yagami KOF '98 was originally released for arcades on July 23, 1998. It was ported to the Neo Geo AES on September 23, 1998, the Neo-Geo CD on December 23, 1998 and the PlayStation on March 25, 1999. The PlayStation version was published in North America and the PAL region by Agetec, becoming the first PlayStation installment in the series to be released outside Japan since The King of Fighters '95. The original game is also included in The King of Fighters Collection: Orochi Saga compilation released in North America and the PAL region for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Wii (the game was not included in the Japanese Orochi Hen compilation). The game was later re- released for iOS and Android. =Dream Match= A Dreamcast version was also released on June 24, 1999 under the title The King of Fighters: Dream Match 1999, reflecting the year the version was released. This game was released in North America on September 30, 1999. It featured remade 3D backdrops and ran at 60 frames per second. =Ultimate Match= KOF '98 was remade under the title of The King of Fighters '98: Ultimate Match released in 2008, ten years after the original games release. It was released in Japan as an arcade game for the Taito Type X hardware on March 2008. The PlayStation 2 port released on June 26, and was also published on the NeoGeo Online Collection The Best on June 18, 2008. The game was released in North America by Ignition Entertainment on March 3, 2009. In the European Union it was released on June 10, 2009. A version for the IGS PolyGame Master 2 arcade hardware was also released in 2009, which was called The King of Fighters '98: Ultimate Match Hero. Ultimate Match includes additional characters not featured in the original version of the game, such as Eiji Kisaragi from KOF '95, along with Kasumi Todoh and the Boss Team (composed of Geese Howard, Wolfgang Krauser, and Mr. Big) from KOF '96, as well as the boss characters Goenitz and Orochi, essentially including all the characters featured in the KOF series prior to KOF '98. New moves were added to the USA Sports Team to improve their playability, and EX versions of certain characters not featured in the original version were added, including King with her Art of Fighting 2 moveset, and Ryuji Yamazaki, Blue Mary and Geese Howard with their Real Bout Fatal Fury 2 moveset. The Orochi versions of Leona and Iori Yagami are also playable, and both also appear as mid-bosses in the Arcade Mode. New stages were added to the game such as China and Hong Kong to show appreciation for KOF's high popularity in such regions; it is also the only fighting game to feature an accurate representation of Saudi Arabia in one stage, as the country was a major market for the NEO GEO line in the early 1990s. A third fighting style is also introduced in addition to Advance and Extra, dubbed \\"Ultimate\\" mode. Ultimate mode is a customizable style that allows the player to choose between features from Advance or Extra mode, such as which kind of Power Gauge to use. It also includes a 'Neo Geo' mode, which is a direct port of the original Neo Geo console version. A mobile game based on Ultimate Match, called The King of Fighters '98UM OL, was released by Chinese company Ourpalm for the iOS and Android platforms on July 9, 2016. An updated version titled The King of Fighters '98: Ultimate Match Final Edition, featuring balance changes for most characters, was released for Microsoft Windows on Steam on December 16, 2014, and on GOG.com on June 1, 2018. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed The King of Fighters '98 on their September 1, 1998 issue as being the most-successful arcade game of the year. During its release week, the Dreamcast port of the game sold 58,354 copies in Japan. As of 2004, the sales increased to 104,049. Famitsu magazine scored the Dreamcast port of KOF '98 a 30 out of 40,„Éâ„É™„Éº„É†„Ç≠„É£„Çπ„Éà ‚Äì „Ç∂„Éª„Ç≠„É≥„Ç∞„Éª„Ç™„Éñ„Éª„Éï„Ç°„Ç§„Çø„Éº„Ç∫ DREAM MATCH 1999. Weekly Famitsu. No.915 Pt.2. Pg.49. June 30, 2006. and GameRankings gave it a 71% based on a total of 18 reviews. Various reviewers from video game publications have commented on KOF '98. While reviewing the compilation The King of Fighters: The Orochi Saga, Matt Edwards from Eurogamer noted KOF '98 to be the most enjoyable game from the collection as well as the most famous game from the series \\"that really made people stand up and take an interest in the series. We'd disagree in favor of some of the later games, but for its time KOF '98 was reasonably well balanced for a 2D fighter. And there's no denying it was a blast.\\" The game also received praise by 1UP.com writer Richard Li who found it to be the most balanced game from the KOF series due to the fact it improved the game mechanics from the previous titles. Jeremy Dunham from IGN gave the game an 8.4, praising, apart from the gameplay and characters, the graphics, the music as well as the backgrounds design added for the Dreamcast version. However, he was disappointed with the lack of story in the game, noting the ones from previous games to be very entertaining. GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann found it to be one of the best 2D fighting games, noting that although new players may find it hard to play due to the difficulty in executing various special moves and how difficult the opponent AI is. Although Andy Chien from Gaming Age found that the Dreamcast port of the game was well done since it does not have the disadvantages that it had in other consoles, he noted it \\"could have been a lot better.\\" He also found that the game had a bug when he tried to perform a special move from Mai Shiranui, which unlike the other ports, is very inconsistent. Tom Russo reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"Not bad, but with so many other high-quality fighters available, this one only makes sense for players nostalgic for old NeoGeo fighting games.\\" GameRankings gave Ultimate Match a 77% based on 14 reviews for the PlayStation 2 version and 74% based on 5 reviews for the Xbox 360 version. Metacritic gave it a 73 out of 100 for both the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 versions based on 11 reviews and 4 reviews respectively. Various publications for video games and other media have commented on Ultimate Match with IGN writer Ryan Clements giving it a 7.8, saying that probably this game should only be recommended to fans of The King of Fighters due to how old its graphics are as well as the little balance it has with 60 characters being playable. James Mielke from 1UP.com complained on how the game is very similar to KOF '98, but found the controls to be comfortable and intuitive for any fans of 2D fighting games. However, Heath Hooker from GameZone found that the gameplay and sound from the game make up for the graphics even though there is not much difference between KOF '98 and KOF '98: Ultimate Match. In 2013, KOF '98 Ultimate Match was ranked as the 15th best arcade game of the 1990s by Complex, who also called it \\"possibly the greatest SNK fighting game of them all,\\"Rich Knight, Hanuman Welch, The 30 Best Arcade Video Games of the 1990s , Complex.com, August 28, 2013. and included it on their list of 25 best 2D fighting games of all time in 2013. In 2017, the Chinese mobile game King of Fighters '98UM OL grossed () in Japan.

It is the sixth installment in The King of Fighters series, introducing a new story arc known as the \\"NESTS Chronicles\\" which is centered around a young man named K', who is formerly associated with a mysterious yet threatening organization known only as NESTS. The game introduces several changes to the established KOF format, most notably an assisting character labeled \\"Striker\\". The game was ported to the Neo-Geo CD and the PlayStation. Dreamcast and Microsoft Windows versions were also released under the title whose stages were remodeled into 3D. SNK had originally planned to remove main characters Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami, who had previously appeared in earlier installments of the series, from The King of Fighters '99, but they ended up as hidden characters instead. The popularity of Kyo's previous incarnations resulted in him being given \\"clones\\" that wear his original clothes and perform his moves. SNK had difficulty balancing the age of the characters and teams. The Neo Geo and Dreamcast versions are both included in The Kings of Fighters NESTS Hen compilation released for the PlayStation 2 in Japan as well as other ports. Critical response to The King of Fighters '99 has generally been positive because of its fighting system and its use of Strikers. The Dreamcast port of the game has had a more favorable reception than the PlayStation version thanks to its loading times and graphics. The Nintendo Switch port has garnered a similar response, with reviewers finding it modern and praising its gameplay. While the game has sold well, overall sales have been less than those of the series' previous game because of poor sales of the console versions. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot showcasing K' and Robert Garcia calling their respective Striker to attack. The bottom bars indicate how many Strikers the player can use. Instead of the three-character teams from earlier The King of Fighters (KOF) games, each team now has four members. Before a match, the player chooses three of the characters to use in the fights. The fourth member becomes the Striker the player summons during battle to help their character by performing one of their Special Moves against the opponent. A Striker can be summoned only a limited number of times during a single match. This is determined by the number of \\"Strike Bombs\\" at the bottom of the screen. The selectable fighting styles, Advanced and Extra, from The King of Fighters '98 have been removed. Instead, the game has a single playing style modeled after the Advanced mode from the previous game, where the player fills their power gauge by attacking the opponent or performing special moves. This time, there are two powered-up states the player can choose during battle depending on the button combination used. Counter Mode increases the player's offensive strength and allows them unlimited use of their character's Super Special Move. There is also a combo that transitions from a Special Move into a Super Special Move by using a \\"Super Cancellation Attack\\" or a \\"Moving Attack\\". The other powered-up mode is Armor Mode, which increases the character's defensive strength, allowing them to take more damage from the opponent; however, the player cannot use Super Special Moves in Armor Mode. Depending on the player's performance, a score is given when the fight is finished. Should a high score be reached, the arcade mode will offer the player an extra fight following the final boss. The Dreamcast version had different stages and a few new selectable Striker characters. The new Strikers had consisted of Kyo Kusanagi (in a different outfit), Athena Asamiya (in her school outfit), Goro Daimon, Billy Kane, Ryuji Yamazaki, Chizuru Kagura, Syo Kirishima, Alfred Airhawk, Vanessa, Seth, Fiolina Germi, and Gai Tendo. As well, the game can be connected to the Neo Geo Pocket Color game The King of Fighters: Battle de Paradise. Points won in Battle de Paradise can be transferred to The King of Fighters '99: Evolution to speed up the leveling process for the Extra Strikers. Plot and characters Two years have passed since the last King of Fighters tournament. Nobody has seen Kyo Kusanagi or Iori Yagami since they defeated the evil being Orochi at the climax of the 1997 tournament. Invitations are sent to many characters inviting them to a new tournament, which this time around is more of a secretive affair and away from the public eye than the ones in both '96 and '97, with each team now having an additional member. However, the tournament's host remains unknown. The increased number of characters per team, and the story element of the missing Kyo and Iori, lead to a reshuffling of the character roster. K' is introduced as the game's new protagonist with his partner, Maxima, who joins forces with Kyo's former teammates Benimaru Nikaido and Shingo Yabuki to form the new Hero Team. Takuma Sakazaki rejoins the Art of Fighting Team as its fourth member. Mai Shiranui finally becomes an official member of the Fatal Fury Team for the first time in the series. King joins forces with Blue Mary (formerly a member of the \\"'97 Special Team\\") to form the new Women Fighters Team with Kasumi Todoh (last seen in KOF '96) and Li Xiangfei (from Real Bout Fatal Fury 2: The Newcomers). The three returning teams also gain a new member: Whip for the Ikari Warriors Team, Bao for the Psycho Soldier Team, and Jhun Hoon for the Korea Justice Team. The game also introduces two clones of Kyo Kusanagi, Kyo-1 and Kyo-2, as Team Edit characters based on previous playable incarnations of the character. The real Kyo also returns with his rival, Iori, but they are only secret playable characters. The game's antagonist is Krizalid, an agent from the mysterious organization NESTS who uses the data he obtained from his enemies to activate an army of Kyo clones that NESTS themselves had created after the fight against Orochi. He is faced in two states: first he appears with a special coat that analyzes an opponent's data. Once he's defeated, he burns away his coat and increases his strength while having stronger moves. After Krizalid's defeat, his superior kills him via falling debris while other members of NESTS attack K' and Maxima, who are revealed to be former NESTS agents and that the duo succeed in defeating their enemies before making their escape from the collapsing location of their battle against Krizalid. It's also revealed that K' is a test subject designed to replicate Kyo's techniques.

Instead, they ended up as unlockable hidden characters after fans responded negatively to their removal at location tests. Kyo was redesigned for this game, but the developers still liked his school uniform. As a result, based on the practice of adding earlier versions of various characters to games, the staff created the Kyo clones that featured him with classic movesets: Kyo-1 uses Kyo's movesets from the first two games, while Kyo-2 uses his movesets from KOF '96 and KOF '97. To contrast with the previous series' protagonist, Kyo, K' was designed to be the \\"dark hero\\". The staff wanted to create a Robo Army Team. This idea was abandoned, but they later created a tribute to it in The King of Fighters 2000 by introducing Rocky, a character from Robo Army, as a Striker for Maxima. The character Whip was originally meant to appear in KOF '96, but due to Leona Heidern's introduction in that game, the staff decided to wait until KOF '99. Like the earlier games the artwork was done by Shinkiro. The large number of young characters appearing in the game represented a problem for the developers; as a result, the staff introduced older characters such as Seth and Vanessa (who appeared only in the Dreamcast version as Strikers and would not officially debut until the following game) to balance the game. Bao was added to reduce the average age of the Psycho Soldiers Team from 42 to 34. The boss character, Krizalid, was designed \\"with a straight, stylish appearance and earnest strength\\"; however, the designer in charge mentioned he \\"overdid it\\". Due to the large number of unused graphics accumulated on the Neo Geo version, some of Krizalid's graphics were removed. With the release of the Dreamcast port, the staff could add Krizalid's graphics because of the console's capacity. Vanessa was meant to be a playable character, but due to time constraints, she was only a Striker in the Dreamcast port. Release KOF '99 was originally released for the Neo Geo arcade on July 22, 1999. A port to the Neo Geo and Neo-Geo CD consoles was released on September 23, 1999, and December 2, 1999, respectively. The PlayStation port was published on March 23, 2000, in Japan, and on April 22, 2001, in North America. In Japan, it was later republished for the PlayStation SNK Best Collection on March 29, 2001, and once again on July 25, 2002. The North American port was the subject of censorship and blood was omitted. Whip's firearm is edited out of the game's American arcade release, but is uncensored in home release versions. After being released on Wii Virtual Console between 2012 and 2013, the game was released as a part of the ACA Neo Geo range on the Nintendo Switch eShop on May 25, 2017, adding an online mode. The game was remade for the Dreamcast as The King of Fighters '99: Evolution. It was published in Japan on March 30, 2000, and reprinted on October 25, 2001, with the \\"SNK Best\\" logo. In North America, Agetec published it on May 10, 2001. In this port, players can change the audio to listen to arranged tracks of the soundtrack. The game was released during the PlayStation 2's launch and the Dreamcast's ending, and it did not achieve very good sales. On its release week, the Dreamcast port sold 41,387 units, later reaching 67,833 in Japan in 2000. The PlayStation port sold 96,484. Two CD soundtracks and a drama CD were also released. The Neo Geo and Dreamcast versions are included in the compilation The Kings of Fighters NESTS Hen released for the PlayStation 2 in Japan. The game was also made available for the PlayStation 4 but only in Japan by Hamster Corporation. Reception and legacy The King of Fighters '99 was very popular after its release. In GameSpots article \\"The History of SNK\\", KOF '99: Evolution was described as one of the best fighting games on the Dreamcast with Garou: Mark of the Wolves. Various video game publications have commented on the game. While the fighting system has been well-received, critics have expressed mixed feelings about the Striker system. A Gaming Age writer viewed the sequel's changes as a step in the right direction despite finding assisting characters useless. He said that SNK had created proper balances such as making Kyo Kusanagi less overpowered than in previous games. The inclusion of K', the new lead, has been well-received because of his distinct fighting style. IGNs Anthony Chau commented that although \\"people are probably tired of 2D fighting games, saying that they all play the same\\", he found KOF '99: Evolution to be very distinct. He found the new gameplay very entertaining despite knowing that some \\"KOF purists hate the Striker system\\". A GameSpot reviewer described the Striker system as \\"clearly derived from the tag system from Capcom's Marvel fighting games\\". They complained there were popular characters who only appeared as Strikers, and wished they were fully playable. GamePro criticized the game because the Strikers' new gameplay \\"simply [does not] fit in the King of Fighters series\\" and \\"is more of a novelty than a game mode\\". There were mixed responses to the ported versions. German magazine Video Games praised the Neo Geo port, giving it a score of 80%. There have also been multiple comparisons between the Dreamcast port and the PlayStation port, with the Dreamcast version being regarded as better. The use of 3D backgrounds in all versions has been praised. A GamePro writer felt that the Neo Geo's quality was not handled well by the PlayStation, resulting in issues with the graphics and long loading times. Nevertheless, he found the additional material to be pleasing for series' fans. Andrew Seyoon Park of GameSpot found the PlayStation port very good considering the console's limitations. Despite this, he complained about the animation and the voices, and found the reduced number of characters from KOF '98 disappointing. He felt that the boss Krizalid is very hard to beat. HardcoreGaming noted that while the Dreamcast port of the game was superior based on its graphics and loading times, the PlayStation version was still worth playing. Both Uvejuegos stated that while the game did not have a major update of its characters, except Kyo Kusanagi's redesign, it still managed to maintain its quality due to its fighting system. The new lead, K', and the final boss, Krizalid, were described as entertaining. Gaming Age felt the graphic update was more noticeable than the Uvejuegos did but was critical of Krizalid. Gaming Age found him so difficult to defeat they characterized the previous bosses‚Äî Rugal Bernstein and Orochi‚Äîas easy by comparison. GameSpot agreed, feeling that the boss fight removed the entertainment value from the game due to its difficult challenge. Greg Orlando reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"This King of Fighters should consider abdicating the throne.\\" The game's Nintendo Switch port received positive responses with critics saying its gameplay and graphics were ahead of their time. Nintendo Life praised the varied cast and the new gameplay mechanics but did not find it as appealing as its predecessor. GameSpew felt the port's mechanics, and multiple options prevented the game from being dated. The combat was described as fast enough to appeal to gamers. Bonus Stage found the graphics appealing and praised SNK's focus on giving the game a storyline, despite it being an arcade fighting game. In retrospect, 1UP.com said that while players were bothered by Kyo and Iori's exclusion from teams, and by the Striker system, K's inclusion was one of SNK's best decisions due to his fighting style. The series' writer, Akihiko Ureshino, wrote a novelization of the game titled Beyond the \\"K\\". It was released in November 1999 by ASCII. SNK also released a sequel titled The King of Fighters 2000 a year after KOF '99s release for multiple consoles. In the spin-off game The Rhythm of Fighters, Kyo's character theme, \\"Tears\\", was used for the game to work as a rhythm game.

On the hill situated above the cave, lie the remnants of an ancient temple dedicated to the sea god Poseidon (ŒùŒµŒ∫œÅŒøŒºŒ±ŒΩœÑŒµ·øñŒøŒΩ Œ†ŒøœÉŒµŒπŒ¥·ø∂ŒΩŒøœÇ). Under the Byzantine Empire, the temple was converted into a Christian church, and Christian rites are conducted there to this day. Cape Matapan was once the place where mercenaries waited to be employed. At Cape Matapan, the Titanic's would-be rescue ship, the SS Californian, was torpedoed and sunk by German forces on 9 November 1915. In March 1941, a major naval battle, the Battle of Cape Matapan, occurred off the coast of Cape Matapan, between the Royal Navy and the Italian Regia Marina, in which the British emerged victorious in a one-sided encounter. The encounter's main result was to drastically reduce future Italian naval activity in the Eastern Mediterranean. General Info More recently a lighthouse was constructed, but it is now in disuse. As the southernmost point of mainland Greece, the cape is on the migration route of birds headed to Africa.

Scope The ManKind Project has 12 regions: Australia, Belgium, Canada, French Speaking Europe, New Zealand, Nordic (Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland), South Africa, Switzerland, Germany, The United Kingdom, Ireland, and the United States. There are also 7 developing regions: Costa Rica, Mexico, The Netherlands, China, Singapore, India, Central Africa (Cameroon, DRC) and Israel. History MKP has its origins in the mythopoetic men's movement of the early 1980s, drawing heavily on the works of Robert Bly, Robert L. Moore, and Douglas Gillette. In 1984, Rich Tosi, a former Marine Corps officer; Bill Kauth, a social worker, therapist, and author; and university professor Ron Hering, Ph.D. (Curriculum Studies); created an experiential weekend for men called the \\"Wildman Weekend\\" (later renamed \\"The New Warrior Training\\"). As the popularity of the training grew, they formed a New Warrior Network organization, which would later become The Mankind Project. New Warrior Training Adventure Hero's Journey. MKP states: MKP states that those who undertake this journey pass through three phases characteristic to virtually all historic forms of male initiation: descent, ordeal and return. Participants surrender all electronic devices (cell phones, watches, laptops, etc.), weapons (guns, knives, etc.) and jewelry for the weekend. This was explained as way of removing the \\"noise of a man's life\\", separating the man \\"from what he is comfortable with,\\" and ensuring the safety of all participants. Participants agree to confidentiality of the NWTA processes, to create an experience \\"uncluttered by expectation\\" for the next man and to protect the privacy of all participants. MKP encourages participants to freely discuss what they learned about themselves with anyone. Training courses usually involve 20 to 32 participants, and some 30 to 45 staff. The course usually takes place at a retreat center, over a 48-hour period, with a one-to- one ratio of staff to participants. =Research= Researchers reported on data from 100 men, whom they interviewed and administered a battery of questionnaires, before the men participated in a New Warrior Training Adventure during 1997-1999. The same men completed a set of follow-up questionnaires 18 months after they had completed the NWTA. The men endorsed changes such as \\"... [becoming more] assertive and clear with others about what I want or need\\" and \\"... accept[ing] total responsibility for all aspects of my life\\". The study findings also indicated that the men had more social support and experienced more life satisfaction 18 months after the NWTA. The authors acknowledge limitations to their research, since they did not have a comparison or control group, which results in various \\"threats to internal validity\\" mentioned by the researchers, primarily history, maturation, and selection bias. A second study accumulated data from 45 trainings held between 2006-2009, indicated that the psychological well-being of participants, as well as other indicators, improved after the initial weekend of participation in an NWTA. Many of the initial changes endured across a 2-year follow-up period. Integration Groups (I-Groups) MKP co-founder Bill Kauth's 1992 book A Circle of Men: The Original Manual for Men's Support Groups details how groups of men can assemble to help one another emotionally and psychologically. Men who have completed the NWTA are encouraged to consider joining such a group. An optional \\"Integration Group\\" training is offered shortly after each NWTA; a fee is charged for this training (fees vary by community and format). Some training courses are part of a small integration group on their own with qualified leaders, other training courses take place over an entire weekend and can cost between $100 and $250 depending on lodging, location, and number of men attending. The \\"I-Group\\" is for participants to engage in ongoing personal work and to apply the principles learned on the NWTA to their lives. I-Groups are available to all men who complete the NWTA, and sometimes to men who want to explore the Mankind Project. Many I-Groups meet one evening per week. A typical I-Group meeting includes conversation and sharing in a series of \\"rounds\\" that allow each man to be heard. In both the New Warrior weekend and the follow-up groups, Mankind Project \\"... focuses on men's emotional well-being, drawing on elements like Carl Jung's theories of the psyche, nonviolent communication, breath work, Native American customs, and good old-fashioned male bonding\\". A study conducted in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area collected retrospective survey data from members of 45 I-groups that met between 1990 and 1998. At the end of the study period (1998), 23 groups were active and 22 had disbanded. Groups were active for 4.5 years (median), and the median length of individual participation was 26.2 months (2.2 years). Each group consisted of about six men. Survey participants rated their groups as moderately effective. Other training courses MKP is affiliated with several similar training programs: * Becoming a Man (BAM) - a program in Chicago for inner-city adolescent boys * Boys to Men, for adolescent boys * Inner King, for \\"initiating men into sovereign, kingly energy\\" * Inside Circle, for convicts in maximum security prisons * Underground Railroad Training Odyssey, sponsored by the Inward Journey African American Council * Vets Journey Home (formerly \\"Bamboo Bridge\\"), for combat veterans * Warrior Monk, for \\"men and women who are in a transition phase of life\\" * Woman Within International, for women Public figures My Morning Jacket frontman (vocals, guitar) Jim James, told Pitchfork magazine: > There's this group called ManKind Project, they lead retreats to try and > help men feel more OK with all the different sides of being a man. I went on > one of those retreats because I was so intrigued. It was fucking amazing. > The experience was about taking accountability for yourself and your actions > ... Actor Wentworth Miller, in an address to the Human Rights Campaign during an event in 2013, describes his involvement with MKP as vital to his coming out process, and his introduction to being part of an accepting community.http://www.hrc.org/blog/entry/video-wentworth-miller-talks-about- coming-out-overcoming-struggles-at-hrc-d In his letter rejecting an invitation to the Festival of Festivals, Saint Petersburg on grounds that he as a gay man could not support the event while Russian law prohibits homosexuality, Miller signed as a member of the ManKind Project as well as member of the HRC and GLAAD. Actor Eka Darville told the New York Times that MKP helped him become a better father, commenting, \\"There is no way I could have done that without a brotherhood telling me all the bull I was projecting onto my wife . ... \\" Frederick Marx, a film director, writer, and producer (Hoop Dreams, Journey from Zanskar) talks openly about his involvement with MKP, and has made documentary films involving the organization, e.g., The Tatanka Alliance about a \\"Hunka\\" ceremony to consecrate an alliance between the ManKind Project USA and the Pine Ridge Oglala Lakota elders community. Criticism A 2007 Houston Press article detailed criticisms of the ManKind Project. Anthropology associate professor Norris G. Lang said that some of the groups' exercises that he attended were \\"fairly traumatic\\" and were \\"dangerous territory for an unprofessional\\"; and Anti-cult advocate Rick Alan Ross said that The ManKind Project appears to use coercive mind-control tactics, such as limiting participants' sleep and diet, cutting them off from the outside world, forcing members to keep secrets, and using intimidation. The ManKind Project responded stating that their organization does not exhibit characteristics of a cult as commonly defined, such as having \\"a single charismatic leader\\" and \\"separation from the outside world.\\" =Wrongful death lawsuit= A 2007 wrongful death lawsuit filed by the parents of Texan Michael Scinto charged that MKP was responsible for his suicide. The parents said that he had struggled with alcohol and cocaine addiction in the past. Scinto was a 29-year-old adult who had been sober for a year and a half prior to his attending MKP's New Warrior Training Adventure in July 2005. Two days after Scinto returned from the NWTA retreat, he sought psychiatric help at Ben Taub Hospital. He subsequently resumed drinking and taking drugs, and he then committed suicide. The parties settled in 2008. The terms of the settlement were not publicly disclosed, although a copy of the court documents were posted online by Warren Throckmorton,Certified Document Number 37853765 (20 pages), certification signed by Theresa Chang, District Clerk, Harris County, Texas (June 3, 2008), containing three documents: Defendants' Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement (May 20, 2008) (pp. 1‚Äì4); Settlement Agreement (Exhibit A, April 10, 2008) (pp. 5‚Äì9); and Full and Final Release and Settlement Agreement (Exhibit B, undated) (pp. 10‚Äì20); Harris County, Texas, District Court, 333rd Judicial District, Cause No. 2007-43994; https://www.wthrockmorton.com/wp- content/uploads/2009/01/nwtascinto.pdf and aspects of the settlement were reported in the press.

Biography Born after his parents had been crowned Emperor and Empress of Ethiopia, he was the only one of the Emperor's children to have been born with the title of Prince. Since his older brothers, Prince Asfa Wossen and Prince Makonnen, had both been born before the 1930 coronation, Prince Sahle Selassie was also the first legitimate child born to a reigning Emperor since the birth of Dejazmach Alemayehu Tewodros, son of Emperor Tewodros II. Prince Sahle Selassie was married to Princess Mahisente Habte Mariam, the daughter of Dejazmach Habte Mariam Gabre-Igziabiher, the heir to the old Oromo kingdom of Leqa Naqamte in Welega Province, and later served as governor of Welega province. They had a son, Prince Ermias Sahle Selassie,\\"Prince Sahle Selassie featured in The Washington Post\\", 2 November 201. The Institute of World Politics. who currently is the President of the Crown Council of Ethiopia. The Prince was a man of an artistic bent, who is said to have made a movie which was banned from publication by the Imperial Government censor despite the fact the Prince was a member of the Imperial family. It was believed that the movie indirectly questioned the fast pace of development, and the strains it caused on rural society, and was thus unflattering to the policies of the Imperial government. Prince Sahle Selassie died in 1962, months after the death of his mother Empress Menen Asfaw.

The smut fungus Tilletia indica, a basidiomycete, invades the kernels and obtains nutrients from the endosperm, leaving behind waste products with a disagreeable odor that makes bunted kernels too unpalatable for use in flour or pasta. While Karnal bunt generally does not lead to devastating crop losses, it has the potential to dramatically decrease yield and poses additional economic concerns through quarantines which limit the export of suspected infectious wheat products from certain areas, including the U.S. Several chemical control methods exist for Karnal bunt of wheat, but much work remains to be done in identifying resistant host varieties. Hosts and symptoms Karnal bunt attacks durum wheat, rye, and triticale, a hybrid of wheat and rye. Despite its preference for a common crop, Karnal bunt can be extremely difficult to diagnose in the field for many reasons. First, not all kernels on a plant head will be infected, and thus infected plants are not as readily identifiable. This distribution is the reason for Karnal bunt's being referred to as partial bunt. Another factor which makes Karnal bunt difficult to readily diagnose in the field is the fact that most infected kernels do not show symptoms prior to maturity. The disease produces dark color and a fishy smell on infected kernels. Usually only the germ end of the kernel will show symptoms, but occasionally the entire kernel may appear diseased. The darkening of the kernel is a result of the kernel tissue being converted in a teliospore mass by the fungus. Another symptom is referred to as the \\"canoe symptom\\" as in the process of replacing the healthy kernel with teliospores, the disease tends to hollow out host kernels, resulting in a canoe shape.U.S. Department of Agriculture 2001. http://www.invasive.org/publications/aphis/karnel.pdf While the dark teliospores of the fungus may be diagnostic, diagnosis of Karnal bunt poses the added difficulty of differentiating between Karnal bunt from other infections which also result in the aforementioned symptoms, such as black point, common bunt, and dwarf bunt.R. L. Forster and B. J. 1996. Goates.http://www.uiweb.uidaho.edu/ag/plantdisease/kbwheat.htm Disease cycle The disease is primarily spread through contaminated seed or farm equipment, although it may also be carried short distances by the wind, especially following the burning of wheat fields. Evidence of the importance of airborne dispersal of Tilletia indica was demonstrated by Halasz et al. in 2014 when they discovered a strong correlation between teliospore concentration in the air above a wheat crop and the subsequent number of infected wheat kernels. The researchers concluded that this airborne spread of teliospores could also result in post-harvest disease development.Halasz, A. 2014 Aerobiological aspects of quarantine risks in grain warehouses: a study on bunt (Tilletia spp.) dispersal The fungal spores can then remain viable for several years, germinating when weather conditions become favorable for development.U.S. Department of Agriculture 2007 http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import_export/plants/manuals/domestic/downloads/kb.pdf Once the spores germinate, they infect the wheat flowers and develop large masses of spores on the embryo end of the kernels (the entire kernel is not usually affected).Karnal bunt Disease. Texas Department of Agriculture. Retrieved on 2008-10-26. In preferred weather conditions, a teliospore which has successfully attached to a susceptible host will germinate to produce what is known as a promycelium. At the apex of this structure, then, can be found 65‚Äì180 primary sporidia. Secondary sporidia can then either bud from the primary sporidia or from the fungal threads of the mycelium itself. These secondary sporidia are responsible for infecting young host plants through the ovary wall in the flowering stage. Secondary sporidia accomplish this by penetrating the epidermis of host glumes via germ tubes. Sporidia are then able to enter the maturing kernels and leave vast numbers of teliospores where healthy kernel tissue used to be. During harvest teliospores fall from the kernels to the soil from which point they may be carried elsewhere by wind or tools, thereby restarting the disease cycle.Division Plant Health Promotion, Directorate of Plant Health and Quality (DPHQ), Department of Agriculture. 2001. http://www.nda.agric.za/docs/GenPub/karnalbunt.htm Environment Karnal bunt is named after Karnal, India, where the disease was first discovered on a wheat crop in 1931. Since then, the disease has been reported in all major wheat-growing states of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Mexico, and certain areas of the Southwestern United States such as New Mexico, Arizona, and parts of Texas. Karnal bunt pathogenesis is heavily dependent on weather conditions. Relative humidity over 70% favors teliospore development. Furthermore, daytime temperatures in the range of 18‚Äì24 ¬∞C, and soil temperatures in the range of 17‚Äì21 ¬∞C also increase the severity of Karnal bunt. Management Control of Tilletia indica has proven challenging for many reasons. First, since teliospores do not infect kernels systematically, chemical control via seed treatments has not been a viable solution. Several other methods, such as delaying planting so as to avoid the weather conditions which favor teliospore germination, have been proven to be effective to some extent, but also pose the risk of reducing yield. Other cultural controls such as crop-rotation may be practical as the planting of non-host species for several years may reduce the number of teliospores in given field significantly.Mike Ottman. University of Arizona 2002. http://cals.arizona.edu/pubs/crops/az1287/ Chemical control methods also hold promise for controlling Karnal bunt of wheat. In a 1986 study, Smilanick et al. were able to eradicate over 80% of Tilletia indica infection in wheat following two foliar applications of the fungicide propiconozole. The researchers had the same success using four foliar applications of the fungicides mancozeb or copper hydroxide. These chemical treatments were most effective when applied to host foliage 72 hours post-infection, but were not effective at all when applied to host seeds.Smilanick, J.L. 1986 http://www.apsnet.org/publications/plantdisease/backissues/Documents/1987Articles/PlantDisease71n01_94.pdf In 2009 researchers investigated the Muscodor albus fungus as a biocontrol agent for Karnal bunt of wheat. While biofumigation with this fungus was effective in reducing the capacity of other species of Tellitia to cause disease, this method was ineffective against the dormant teliospores of Tellitia indica.Goates, B. 2009 http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/w08-104#.VF5MzvnF-So In a similar effort, researchers tested a variety of plant extracts in the hopes of finding a non-chemical control method of Karnal bunt of wheat. The researchers found extract of Acalypha indica and Lantana camara, when sprayed on wheat leaves, to reduce the number of infected plants by 65%.Sharma, B. 1999 http://apps.webofknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=WOS&search;_mode=GeneralSearch&qid;=4&SID;=4E6SNK4fm4ooAcbQgqe&page;=2&doc;=15 As is likely the case for any plant disease, host resistance is the most practical and desired control method. Researchers analyzed the HD29 cultivar of Triticum aestivum, or common wheat, in order to explore the possibility of control via host resistance. Researchers identified three genes coding for resistance to the Ni8 isolate of the disease, and two coding for resistance to the Ni7 isolate. The two genes coding for Ni7 resistance also code for Ni8 resistance, meaning that it may be possible to identify a common gene which may confer resistance to T. indica. Importance Karnal bunt accounts for yield losses of approximately 0.5% annually, which is negligible. Some fields of particularly susceptible wheat cultivars in India, however, have suffered losses of up to 40% in the past, but such events are rare. Significant economic losses in wheat crops occur due to quarantine and other export restrictions placed on infected areas.Karnal Bunt: A Fungal Disease of Wheat . USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, March 2004. Retrieved on 2008-10-26. Furthermore, Karnal bunt of wheat poses no threat to human life in the United States as regulations deem wheat containing more than 3% bunted kernels unfit for human consumption and these crops are instead used in animal feed. Appearance of the disease in the United States in early 1996 resulted in the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) implementing an emergency quarantine, inspection, and certification program for wheat moving out of the infested areas, along with regulations on sanitizing machinery and storage facilities. Many foreign countries have a zero tolerance for karnal bunt in import shipments. As one of the world's top exporters of wheat, such restrictions negatively impact the U.S. economy.CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition ‚Äì Order Code 97-905  References   External links  * Karnal Bunt Questions and Answers *Karnal Bunt SOPs for Harvest Equipment *Karnal Bunt SOPs for Seed Procurement and Planting *Species Profile - Karnal Bunt (Tilletia indica), National Invasive Species Information Center, United States National Agricultural Library.

It features John Madden on the cover. It was the last version of the Madden series to be released for the Super NES, Genesis and Sega Saturn platforms, as well as the last Madden game to utilize the 2D sprites for the players and referee, on 3D playing fields. The Green Bay Packers had the best team overall in the game with a 95. The worst team overall was the Baltimore Ravens with a score of 71. A 3-way tie between the Dallas Cowboys, the New England Patriots and the Green Bay Packers for the best offense with a perfect score of 100. There is also a 3-way tie for the best defense in the game between the San Francisco 49ers, the Seattle Seahawks and the Green Bay Packers with a score of 97. The San Diego Chargers had the best special teams in the game with a score of 96. Publisher EA Sports licensed the Super NES and Genesis versions of the game to THQ, who published it for those platforms. Gameplay Madden NFL 98 introduced touch passing to the series, which allows players to control the speed of a pass by how hard they push the button. Control can be switched to any football player at any time. The PC version of Madden NFL 98 allowed players to download the latest NFL rosters from EA's website, thereby keeping the game up-to-date. Development In response to a longstanding criticism of the Madden series, that the AI is too vulnerable, the development team made improving the AI their main emphasis with Madden NFL 98. The AI architects dubbed their new system \\"Liquid AI\\". A version for the Panasonic M2 was in the works, but never released due to the system's cancellation. A version for the Game.com was also planned, with Tiger Electronics as the developer, though Tiger producer Allen Richardson admitted that the game would be difficult to do on the Game.com due to the 16 megabit size of the cartridges. Reception Madden NFL 98 was positively received, with the overwhelming majority of critics agreeing that the new \\"liquid AI\\" had eliminated the longstanding Madden NFL series problem of \\"money plays\\" that could be used to successfully run the ball in any situation, making the game more challenging and the final scores more comparable to those of real football games. Kraig Kujawa of Electronic Gaming Monthly called it \\"the smartest football game I've played\\", and Gary Cutlack of Sega Saturn Magazine said the new AI \\"Makes the game a lot harder, but a well earned victory is much more satisfying, don't you think?\\" Next Generation dissented with the majority, contending that while the AI was improved from the previous installment of the series, they had managed to find some \\"money plays\\". However, other aspects of the game were widely praised as well, particularly the lively audio commentary, realistic animations, and wide selection of options. Several reviewers made particular mention of the new \\"fantasy draft\\" option. By far the largest source of criticism was the use of sprite-based rather than polygon-based players. While full polygonal football video games were unexplored territory (the first fully polygonal football game, NFL GameDay 98, was released the same month as Madden NFL 98, and GameSpot acknowledged that polygonal graphics are a much greater drain on processing power in football games than other genres, due to the large number of players), most critics felt that the Madden series, as the leader in the football genre, should have advanced into it by this time. Next Generation in particular felt that the Madden series had unequivocally been dethroned by its failure to beat NFL GameDay to fully polygonal graphics, concluding that \\"despite some problems, at least the gameplay is solid ‚Äì a distinct improvement over last year. However, it's too little too late, and stacked against the jaw-dropping GameDay, good is no longer good enough.\\" GameSpot countered that \\"Although some might scoff at Madden 98 not using polygons like its chief competitor GameDay 98, these player sprites are well animated and detailed.\\", and pointed out several impressive graphical features accomplished with the sprites. Arguing that the excellent gameplay and AI outweigh the graphical shortcomings, Kujawa deemed Madden NFL 98 \\"the best PlayStation football game\\", while his co-reviewer Dean Hager, like Next Generation, held that GameDay 98 had edged it out with its polygonal players. While most reviewers did not compare versions, GamePro noted that the Saturn version has greater pixelation than the PlayStation version and uses an antiquated \\"gliding sprites\\" method of animation. Despite this, the Saturn's much smaller library of football games (Sega's only answer to Sony's NFL GameDay was the critically panned NFL '97) left critics with few reservations about declaring the Saturn version of Madden NFL '98 the best football game on the system. In the same issue in which they reviewed the Saturn version (and just a month after reviewing the PlayStation version), Electronic Gaming Monthly ranked the Saturn and PlayStation versions as the 19th best console video game of all time, saying that the AI was the best of any football game yet. Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article (on page 100) explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible.

To win the player must dominate the chosen market (getting 55% to 65% of the market share depending on the number of opponents). The Corporate Machine is a follow up to the game Business Tycoon, which was itself a sequel to the game Entrepreneur, all developed by Stardock.  Gameplay  = Starting Out = When starting a game, the player picks a company specialty. Three specialties are available: marketing, labor and research. Each specialty doubles productivity in that area. After picking a specialty, the start screen allows choice of how many opponents to be faced, the difficulty of the game, what map will be used (both real and fictional maps are available), starting funds, and what industry is to be competed in. = Exploring = The game is started at the home site (which is randomly chosen on the map) and with one sales executive. To introduce and sell the product to other regions, the region must be investigated. This process can take from 3 to 10 weeks depending on how far they are from the sites. After an area is explored, the player will know the market leader, if opponents have sites or units there, if the region has a resource, as well as statistics like what the targeted area desires in a product, their concerns with price, and how rich the region is. = The Sales Executives = The sales executives increase market penetration (the percentage of stores carrying the product) in their regions and all regions up to two spaces away from each executive. The sales executive can be moved around the map freely by plane; however, while in transit he will not grant any penetration benefit. To gain more sales executives the profit must be increased to a certain level by the end of a year. This gets harder later on as the amount to gain a new executive increases. It is also possible to get them through the use of Direct Action Cards. = Your Company Sites = These places are the player's base of operations. Manufacturing, research, and marketing buildings can be built and upgraded. Additional sites can be purchased but they become progressively more expensive. On the player's first site there will be a sales office and a garage, but every site after will only have a sales office and everything else has to be built. Other buildings include an intelligence facility, which will generate and display information in the form of graphs. Company stores can be built at any site to decrease employee expenses (and therefore lower employee cost). To get better performance a training center will increase employee efficiency. Employee happiness becomes a factor as well, as an unhappy employee's performance will suffer, so a recreation center will boost morale. If market leadership is lost in an area where a site is, the employees' morale will drop sharply. Marketing, manufacturing, and researching buildings can be accessed in order to make adjustments to the multiple operations within the company. Sales buildings act similarly to sales executives that cannot be moved from region to region. = The Marketing Department = When a marketing building is built, it will be possible to hire and fire marketers. Marketing associates can be used to create marketing campaigns. As campaigns are created, marketing associate availability drops and the player is forced to build more marketing buildings in order to have more campaigns. These buildings can be upgraded to have more employees and to have more powerful marketing campaigns. Positive campaigns will boost the qualities of the player's product, or negative marketing campaigns to decrease the appeal of an opponents product. For media, there are advertisements to print, and radio and television campaigns. Marketing campaigns can be moved from region to region similarly to a sales executive. = The Manufacturing = Starting with a simple garage, the player can upgrade to factories. Larger factories, and hire of additional employees, increase efficiency. Employees can be hired or fired as demand rises or falls. The production screen is where the price of the product is set. If the product is better compared to other companies then an overcharge can be made. The price should not be raised too far as demand will drop quickly if there are different companies in the same area and market leadership could be lost. = Research = This is where scientists develop new technologies to upgrade the product. The bigger the research building, the more scientists can be hired. Four projects can be queued so the player does not have to constantly have to come back to the screen and choose new technologies. Different projects also give different bonuses, such as decreasing the cost to manufacture or increase the appeal to consumers. = Direct Action Cards = Different regions may or may not have a resource in them. There are five resource types: Labor, Government, Intelligence, Marketing, and Underworld. Every year that a region is controlled that has a resource is one resource point. Having resource points allows the play of direct action cards. The game is started with two cards and an additional card is received every year. Direct action cards cost resources, and may have a monetary cost in addition. Cards have effects such as receiving money from the government, a research boon, revealing large blocks of regions, twisting the desires of consumers, physical destruction of competitors assets, cutting costs through illegal activities, and publicity boosts. The direct action card system has been likened to the card game Magic: The Gathering.  Community  The Corporate Machine's popularity has decreased over the years since the game was first introduced. Recently a fan of the game (known as Money) has tried to reunite the TCM community by creating a forum, tutorials, help, and support. The problem that the community is facing is that Stardock's TCM server (which allows users to play online) is down often, disabling internet play. The community is considering creating a new, more reliable server on which to play (see external links).  Reception  The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba on three occasions: from 1915 to 1920, 1922 to 1936, and 1941 to 1945. Early life Sigfusson was born to an Icelandic family living in Nordfjordur, Iceland. He was educated at home and came to Canada in 1887 to work as a farmer and rancher. He married Gudrun Arnason, daughter of Arnor Arnason, of Chicago, in January 1908. They had seven children: Arthur F. Sigfusson, E. Maria Sigfusson, Svein O. Sigfusson, Skuli A. Sigfusson, Sigurdur Jon (Siggi) Sigfusson, Olaf Sigfusson(McMahon), Thomas Sigfusson. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1914 provincial election. Professional life As Liberal, he lost the constituency of St. George to Conservative Edmund L. Taylor by 101 votes. The Conservative government of Rodmond Roblin was forced to resign amid scandal in early 1915. Sigfusson ran again in that year's provincial election, and defeated his Conservative opponent Paul Reykdal by 460 votes. The Liberals won a landslide victory in this election, and Sigfusson served as a backbench supporter of Tobias Norris's government. Manitoba's political culture changed significantly between 1915 and 1920, after the Winnipeg General Strike and the rise of labour politics. Sigfusson lost his seat to Albert Kristjansson of the Labour Party in the 1920 provincial election, as the Liberals were reduced to a precarious minority government. The Liberals were defeated in the 1922 provincial election. Despite the provincial trend against his party, however, Sigfusson was returned to the legislature via a convincing victory over Kristjansson, who had left the Labour Party to join the United Farmers of Manitoba. He was re- elected over both Reykdal and Kristjansson in the 1927 election. In 1932, the Liberals joined with the Progressive Party of Manitoba to create a \\"Liberal- Progressive\\" alliance. Sigfusson was re-elected under this banner in the 1932 provincial election, defeating a Conservative opponent by 500 votes. He again served as a government backbencher, supporting the government of John Bracken. In the 1936 provincial election, Sigfusson was upset by Salome Halldorson of the upstart Social Credit League. He ran again in the 1941 election, however, and defeated Halldorson by a significant margin. Later Years Sigfusson retired from the legislature in 1945. He died in 1969, at age ninety-nine.

It forms a lagoon of the Caspian Sea and has a variable surface area, being about . The Caspian Sea proper sits immediately to the west, mostly divorced by a narrow, rocky ridge having a very narrow opening through which the Caspian waters flow, overwhelmingly, into it. This prompts the Turkmen reading of gara as \\"mighty\\". There is likely to be a subterreanean highly saline flow, if only when evaporation is less fierce in winter, as in the case of the Turkish Straits year-round. The lagoon's volume fluctuates seasonally, accentuated by its shallow (quasi-salt pan) nature. The city of Garabogaz (formerly Bekda≈ü) lies on the ridge, about north of the channel between the main Caspian basin and the Garabogazk√∂l lagoon. The town has a population of about 10,000. Salinity The salinity of the lagoon averages about 35%, compared to the Caspian Sea's 1.2%, and 3‚Äì4% for the bulk of the world's oceans. Because of the exceptionally high salinity, comparable to the Dead Sea, it has practically no marine vegetation. Large evaporite, mostly salt deposits accumulated at the south shore, were harvested by the local population since the 1920s, but in the 1930s manual collection stopped and the industry shifted northwest to its present center near Garabogaz. From the 1950s on, ground water was pumped from levels lower than the bay itself, yielding more valuable types of salts. In 1963 construction began at Garabogaz on a modern plant for increased production of salines all the year round and independently of natural evaporation. This plant was completed in 1973. In March 1980, workers blocked the Caspian link, due to concerns evaporation was accelerating a fall in Caspian Sea. The resulting \\"salt bowl\\" caused widespread problems of blowing salt,Micklin, Philip P. Environmental Resources and Constraints in the Former Soviet Republics (1994).

In 1935 the film director Aleksandr Razumny made a film Kara-bugaz (–ö–∞—Ä–∞-–ë—É–≥–∞–∑) based on the above book, with music by Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov. French communist journalist Henri Barbusse was given a sneak preview of the almost-finished film, which he praised in an article in Izvestia. The film should have been shown first to Stalin, who became unhappy when he learned of its existence. Thus it was never generally released in the Soviet Union.

The cover features Tim Hardaway of the Miami Heat. The game was developed by EA Sports and released on November 30, 1997 for the PlayStation, October 31, 1997 for the PC and December 31, 1997 for the Sega Saturn. It was the final version of NBA Live released for the Super NES, Genesis and Sega Saturn. The game introduced various innovations to the series, including the now standard feature of passing to any teammate with a single button press. The game also made various graphical improvements, with new player models and faces modeled after actual player photographs. The PC version introduced support for 3D acceleration, utilizing 3dfx's Glide API. The PlayStation, PC and Saturn versions have Ernie Johnson as studio announcer and TNT/TBS color analyst Verne Lundquist doing play-by-play commentary. However, the Saturn version does not include play-by-play commentary. NBA Live 98 is followed by NBA Live 99.  Gameplay  The game features rosters from the 1997‚Äì98 NBA season. New features include the \\"Total Control\\" system, that allows players to choose between a dunk or layup or pass to any teammate with the press of a button. \\"Tight\\" player moves allow players to spin, crossover, back down, ball fake and more on command. Player lock lets players always control a specified player on court. Though playing during the 1997‚Äì98 season, Chicago Bulls superstar Michael Jordan is not featured in the game. (This was because Jordan was not part of the National Basketball Players Association and at the time the cost of licensing his individual name and likeness for video games was approximately $15 million a year, beyond the total budget of most video games.) Jordan is replaced by the fictional \\"Roster Player\\" in the Bulls lineup. However, Charles Barkley made his first appearance in Live 98 as a member of the Houston Rockets. The motion capture of the game was done by NBA players Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, Larry Johnson, Joe Dumars and Christian Laettner. =Features= Various new modes were introduced. A new GM Mode lets players choose franchises, draft players and play custom seasons. The game also features the Three-Point Shootout, which could be played using full or split screen. Four difficulty levels are available, including a new Superstar difficulty level, along with improved AI with smarter players and more accurate stats. With the introduction of 3D players, courts, and jerseys came an opportunity to patch and update these aspects of the game. Programs such as the EA Graphics Editor allowed patchers to update almost every visual aspect of the game with ease. This greatly improved gameplay and sold more NBA live games than any before it. Reception The game's original release for the PlayStation received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Critics praised the detailed player graphics, new animations, interface, music, and even the full motion video sequences. GamePro commented, \\"What makes Live '98 so enjoyable to play is its fantastic mixture of NBA realism and wild arcade action.\\" GameSpot assessed it as an across-the-board improvement over NBA Live 97. Critics particularly hailed the number of new gameplay features in NBA Live 98, with the three-point competition, custom team feature, icon passing, and direct ducking all earning particular mention. A few criticisms were voiced, but they did little to impact the critic's overall recommendation. For example, Jay Boor of IGN found the dunks were not as dramatic as they should be, but still concluded NBA Live 98 to be the best basketball game presently on the market. Sushi-X wrote in Electronic Gaming Monthly that weak A.I. makes it \\"the easiest basketball game I've ever played.\\" However, his three co- reviewers were more laudatory, with Kraig Kujawa summing up, \\"NBA Live 97 was easily the best basketball game last year, and now Live 98 has done it again.\\" As with NBA Live 97, critics reported the Saturn port to have much lower- resolution textures and jerkier frame rate than the PlayStation version, to the point where the action is sometimes hard to follow. Critics also found the absence of play-by-play commentary in the Saturn port a severe shortcoming. Kraig Kujawa and John Ricciardi of Electronic Gaming Monthly, who both gave the PlayStation version a 9/10, gave the Saturn version a 5.5/10 and 6/10 respectively, with Kujawa remarking, \\"Obviously, this was a quick and easy port that was paid very little attention. ... EA could and should have done a better job.\\" GameSpot and Sega Saturn Magazine, while noting that the Saturn port retains many strong aspects of the PlayStation original, judged that it compared unfavorably with NBA Action 98, another Saturn basketball game which was released at the same time. Gary Cutlack of Sega Saturn Magazine summarized, \\"Live '98 isn't that bad, it's just unfortunate for EA that Sega are releasing their better NBA game at the same time.\\" NBA Live 98 was a runner-up for Computer Gaming Worlds 1997 \\"Sports Game of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to Baseball Mogul and CART Precision Racing (tie). The editors called NBA Live 98 \\"the latest and best [...] in EA's awesome action- oriented\\" series.

It is a part of the Need for Speed series and is the second installment, following The Need for Speed. Gameplay Need for Speed II features country-themed tracks from North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Like its predecessor, Need for Speed II allows players to race exotic cars in country-themed tracks from North America, Europe, Asia and Australia, either against computer-controlled opponents or human opponents via a LAN, modem, serial connection, or in split screen. There are three distinct gameplay modes: Single Race mode in which a player simply chooses a car and a course and completes a single race. In this mode, the player can customize both the number and type of opponents as well as the number of laps to be completed. Tournament Mode in which the player must complete a series of races successfully to unlock a bonus car. The Knockout Mode consists of a series of 2-lap races with 8 opponents; the last- place finisher at the end of each race is eliminated from the competition. The game features eight real life high-end sports cars and concept cars which the player can drive and race against. The \\"Special Edition\\" release of the game added four additional cars. In addition, the game features a \\"showcase\\" which provides photos, videos, and technical information about the cars as well as the history of each company and background of each car's development. The game also features several new elements compared to the previous game in the form of customizable car paint and components of their car including gear ratios, tires, and spoilers. Development Need for Speed II was developed by EA Canada. The lead programmer for the game was Laurent Ancessi with Wei Shoong Teh and Brad Gour as senior programmers. EA abandoned the Road & Track license used with the original game in favor of licensing with each automobile manufacturer individually. To ensure the physics of fast car handling and performance were as accurate as possible, the programmers collaborated with the manufactures of each vehicle. The sound effects were created by installing microphones in various positions on each car and recording onto eight track digital tape while the car was driven. A version for the Panasonic M2 was in the works but it was never released due to the cancellation of the system. Reception Need for Speed II was met with mixed reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PlayStation version 71.39% and 71/100 and the PC version 68.25%. Critics were universally impressed with the selection of expensive cars and the huge number of tracks. However, most found that other issues interfered with enjoyment of the game. IGN, for instance, remarked that \\"All the right elements are there - cool cars, inventive tracks, decent control - but the execution has been seriously flawed by poor graphics and frame rate.\\" The most commonly cited problem with the graphics was the high amount of pop-in, which Next Generation said \\"is actually irritating enough to obfuscate what could be a good time.\\" The Official PlayStation Magazine said the game had \\"atrocious handling\\" and that it soon got boring. Several critics noted, usually in the form of a complaint, that the game's handling requires players to frequently brake during turns. There was considerable disagreement over the game's blend of realistic and arcade-style racing. In Electronic Gaming Monthly, Kraig Kujawa and Dean Hager's criticism of the game stemmed from its being easier to play and therefore less realistic than its predecessor. Kujawa added that the game \\"has been given an arcade edge that simply doesn't fit. The cartoony-looking graphics are subpar, because they ruin the realistic feel of driving these real, exotic cars.\\" GamePro, however, stated the reverse, that the gameplay was too realistic to appeal to fans of arcade-style racing, and could only be recommended to players who enjoyed games like Formula 1 and the original Need for Speed. GameSpots Glenn Rubenstein offered a third opinion, saying it provides a unique middle-ground between realism and arcade style by allowing players to drive real cars with realistic handling into exotic populated areas. He also praised the music and sound effects, and while acknowledging the issues with the graphics, he found them overall impressive, and concluded Need for Speed II to be \\"the PlayStation's slickest racer yet\\". The PC version was slightly less well-received. An issue was that the game required a fast computer at the time, to display the graphics at the highest setting. A reviewer for Computer and Video Games didn't appreciate the combination of super realist cars being driven on fantasy tracks and thought that the crashes \\"look and feel wrong\\". Tasos Kaiafas of GameSpot liked the game but felt most of the roads were \\"outrageous\\" and that the cars would be unfamiliar to many. An Adrenaline Vault review described the game as a \\"good overall driving experience\\" with easy installation, realistic sound effects and both an excellent interface and music. A 2007 retrospective review in The Game Goldies praised the crisper graphics, smoother animation, rich colors and increased detail compared to the original. =Special Edition= Released on October 29, 1997 in the United States \\"Three games from Electronic Arts: ...and Need for Speed II -- Special Edition.\\" and February 2, 1998 in Japan and Europe, the special edition of Need for Speed II includes one extra race track, three extra cars, three bonus cars, a new driving style called \\"Wild\\", and 3dfx Glide hardware acceleration support.

The first game in the V-Rally series, it is based on the 1997 and 1998 World Rally Championship seasons, and features officially licensed cars and tracks inspired by real locations of rally events. Players drive rally cars through a series of stages spread over eight different locations, ranging from European countries like England, Spain or Sweden, to island countries such as Indonesia and New Zealand. As a simulation game, V-Rally places a strong emphasis on replicating the behavior physics of real cars and generally requires more practice than arcade-style racers. The game was developed over the course of nearly two years by a team that would later be known as Eden Studios. Ex-rally world champion Ari Vatanen gave the developers insight on how the cars should handle collisions and drifts. Upon release, the game was critically and commercially successful in Europe, selling more than two million copies as of November 1998. However, the game was not very successful in North America. Critics generally praised its large number of tracks and challenging yet rewarding gameplay, but some criticized its overly-sensitive and difficult controls. After its release on the PlayStation console, V-Rally was ported to multiple platforms, including the Nintendo 64, Game Boy Color, and Microsoft Windows. A sequel, V-Rally 2, was released in 1999. Gameplay computer-controlled opponents on a track set in Corsica, France. The player's position is shown at the top right corner. V-Rally is a racing simulation game where players drive rally cars through a series of stages or tracks. The game places a strong emphasis on replicating the behavior physics of real cars and generally requires more practice than arcade-style racers. Aspects such as the weather conditions, the road surfaces, and the drive wheel configurations have a significant impact on the car handling. Weather conditions include rain and snow, while road surfaces range from asphalt to gravel or dirt. Races can take place at night or during the day. The game features both Kit Cars and World Rally Cars for players to choose from. Kit Cars are two-wheel drive and include cars such as the Peugeot 306 Maxi or Renault Maxi Megane, while World Rally Cars are four-wheel drive and include cars such as the Subaru Impreza WRC or Mitsubishi Lancer WRC. Before starting a race, players have the option to tweak their car setup with tighter suspensions, quicker gear ratios, understeer or oversteer sensitivity, and choice of manual or automatic transmission. The game features three gameplay modes: Arcade, Championship, and Time Trial. In Arcade, players race against opponents controlled by the game's artificial intelligence in three series of stages. Each series must be completed in a linear fashion and its stages have multiple checkpoints that must be reached in a specified time. Players start with three credits and, if they lose a stage or fail to reach a checkpoint, they will lose one credit. If players run out of credits, the game will be over. However, players can get additional credits by winning individual stages. Championship is similar to Arcade, but stages have no checkpoints and players are awarded points based on the rank they finish courses. The game offers more than 40 stages spread over eight different locations, ranging from European countries like England, Spain or Sweden, to island countries such as Indonesia and New Zealand. Time Trial allows players to race on any stage and record the fastest lap time. All three modes support one or two players. If two players compete against each other, a split screen feature is used. Development and release V-Rally supports the NeGcon controller by Namco. V-Rally was developed for the PlayStation console by an Infogrames team based in Lyon, France. This team, composed of 20 full-time people, would later be known as Eden Studios. Because the PlayStation development kits did not cover the requirements needed for the game, the developers decided to create their own programming tools, including the game engine. The game's environments and cars are fully rendered in 3D, while the Gouraud shading method was used to give 3D objects a smoother surface. All the cars that are featured in the game were officially licensed, including their stickers. Former rally world champion Ari Vatanen gave the developers insight on how the cars should handle collisions and drifts. Vatanen noted that, although each car practically features the same control concepts, there are significant differences between two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive vehicles. The game supports the NeGcon controller by Namco, allowing players to steer their car around curves in an analog manner. Originally, the game was intended to feature a level editor where players could create their own tracks by modifying variables such as road surface, road curves, and weather conditions. It would take the PlayStation between 30 and 60 seconds to render these tracks, which could be saved in a memory card. This option would allow players to update their game with additional tracks. Eventually, an editor would be included in the 1999 sequel V-Rally 2. Although the game's tracks are fictitious, they were inspired by real locations of rally events, such as the Rally Costa Brava in Spain. With the use of the PlayStation Link Cable, a 4 player multiplayer mode was initially planned. Similarly, developers considered the possibility of adding a rear-view mirror to the HUD, but it was ultimately discarded due to the memory constraints of the PlayStation hardware. The game's hard rock score was recorded at the Moby Dick club in Madrid. The overall development of the game took almost two years to complete. The V in the game's title stands for \\"Virtual\\". Based on the 1997 World Rally Championship, V-Rally was first released in Europe in July 1997 as V-Rally: 97 Championship Edition. In North America, the game was published by Electronic Arts and released on November 4, 1997 as Need for Speed: V-Rally. Although the game has no connection to the Need for Speed series, it is presumed that the reason for the title change was to draw more attention to the American market, as rallying is much more popular in Europe than in America. Unlike the European version, the American version includes the Toyota Corolla WRC as a new car. A Platinum version that supports the DualShock controller and includes the Toyota Corolla WRC was released in Europe in 1998 as V-Rally: Championship Edition. Reception In Europe, V-Rally received very positive reviews from critics, who compared it favorably to Sega Rally Championship, praising its large number of tracks and challenging yet rewarding gameplay. Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine described V-Rally as \\"a huge game, by far the most comprehensive racer on [the PlayStation] or any other platform since Psygnosis' F1\\", while Edge credited it for adopting a different style from other PlayStation racing games such as Rage Racer, a market the magazine considered overcrowded at the time. Editors of the French video game magazine Consoles + considered V-Rally the most effective rally simulation game they had ever played. Computer and Video Games editors felt that the simulation aspects give V-Rally a lot of depth, but remarked that the game is not as instantly accessible as Sega Rally and that its highly sensitive controls can frustrate some players. They also considered V-Rally a more attractive game due to its better-looking graphics, which were highlighted for their details and long draw distance. The replay value was seen as one of the game's strongest points, mainly because of the variety of tracks and weather conditions. The Spanish video game magazine HobbyConsolas noted the game's varied scenery, stating that each track offers unique challenges. The magazine said that, although it can take some time to get used to the controls, the effort is ultimately rewarding due to the game's \\"impressive\\" sense of speed. In North America, reviews were not as positive. GameSpot condemned the controls, saying that the cars \\"spin out much, much too easily, and even with understeering turned all the way up in the options, the cars still tend to go wild.\\" Although the website highlighted the game's \\"impressive\\" number of cars and tracks, especially when compared to most games of the time, it concluded that the game is not worth playing due to its \\"shoddy control\\". Electronic Gaming Monthly editors agreed, describing the car physics and collision detection as wacky and unnatural. Other publications were more positive towards the game. GameRevolution enjoyed the fact that weather conditions impact the gameplay experience, stressing that \\"once you understand that you actually need to use your brakes and concentrate on the race, the realism proves to be a great asset\\", while IGN felt that the game was highly rewarding and fun, and that it is best experienced when played on higher difficulty settings. =Sales= In Europe, V-Rally was a commercial success, selling 15,000 copies during its first weekend of release. In the UK, the game was a bestseller for three months, and in August 1998, the game received a \\"Gold\\" sales award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland, indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. As of November 1998, V-Rally had sold more than two million copies worldwide. It took home a \\"Gold\\" prize at the 1999 Milia festival in Cannes, for revenues above ‚Ç¨22 million in the European Union during 1998. Ports and adaptations After its release on the PlayStation console, V-Rally was ported to multiple platforms. An updated version based on the 1998 World Rally Championship, developed by Eden Studios and entitled V-Rally: Edition '99, was released for the Nintendo 64 console in Europe on December 1998, and in North America in September 1999. Presented at the 1998 European Computer Trade Show and later at the 1999 Nintendo Space World show, the Nintendo 64 version features several improvements over the original, including a revised physics engine for better vehicle feel and control. Unlike the PlayStation version, the Nintendo 64 version fits in a 96-megabit cartridge, but does not feature any music during gameplay. The game generally received more positive reviews in Europe than in North America. Criticism was targeted at its late draw-in graphics and floaty car physics, but some critics highlighted the fact that the game includes more than 50 tracks. Because the North American version was released nearly one year later than the European version, IGN felt that Nintendo 64 standards improved significantly with racing games such as World Driver Championship or Beetle Adventure Racing, and that the game would certainly have been judged differently one year earlier. A single-player, portable adaptation of the game was released for the original Game Boy in Europe in July 1998, featuring Mode 7-like graphics and the Arcade and Championship modes, with a total of four cars and ten tracks. An updated version of the Game Boy game was released for the Game Boy Color in Europe in April 1999 as V-Rally: Championship Edition, and in North America in July 1999 as V-Rally: Edition '99. Although the Game Boy Color version is not backward compatible with the Game Boy, it is essentially the same as the Game Boy version, but offers colorful graphics and 20 tracks. Both versions were developed by VD- dev. A Microsoft Windows version, entitled V-Rally: Multiplayer Championship Edition, was released in Europe in June 1999. It is similar to the original PlayStation version, but features sharper textures and supports online play. Later, a Symbian version of the game developed by Ideaworks3D was released for mobile phones such as the Sony Ericsson P800 and P900.

It was originally planned for release as a Nintendo 64 title, however it was cancelled during the early development phases of the game and was never officially announced . Gameplay The game features rally cars that competed in the 1999 World Rally Championship season. There are 26 cars in Championship Edition and 27 in Expert Edition. There are over 80 original tracks which represent all of the rallies of the 1999 season, excluding Greece and Safari. The game modes include a time trial mode, an arcade mode which follows the traditional style of arcade games, V-Rally Trophy where the player completes against 3 AI opponents to see who can get the least time in all of the rallies. The championship mode follows the actual example of rallying with different stages in the rallies featured in the game. V-Rally Trophy and Championship Mode feature 3 distinct championships: European, World and Expert. Weather conditions like snow, rain, and rallying in daytime, sunset and night are included. The racing tracks are essentially stored as curved lines in 3D space. Instead of designing and storing the entire track environment as a 3D model, the game engine generates each track segment based on the 3D line and several parameters, such as track theme, weather, incline/decline, degree of curvature etc. There is also a track editor where the player can design their own rally tracks. There is Multiplayer mode which supports up to 4 Players. The PlayStation version of the game features support for DualShock analog controllers and Namco's neGcon and Jogcon racing controllers. Reception Max Everingham reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"It looks good, it plays fine, and it has a lot of tracks. Only a few annoying quirks keep it from really flying.\\" The Dreamcast version received \\"favourable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, where the PlayStation version was ported for release under the name and published by Spike on 27 January 2000, Famitsu gave it a score of 27 out of 40. Jim Preston reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"A colorful, fun, and realistic driving sim.\\" Cars WRC * 1998 Subaru Impreza * 1999 Toyota Corolla * 1999 Ford Focus * 1999 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution * 1998 Peugeot 206 * 1999 SEAT C√≥rdoba * 1998 Hyundai Coupe * 1998 ≈†koda Octavia  2L Kit-Cars  * 1999 Peugeot 306 Maxi * 1993 SEAT Ibiza * 1999 Vauxhall Astra * 1999 Citro√´n Xsara * 1994 Renault M√©gane  1.6L Kit-Cars  * 1998 Citroen Saxo * 1997 Peugeot 106 * 1996 Nissan Micra  Auto Bonus  * 1998 Ford Escort RS Cosworth V-Rally edition * 1977 Lancia Stratos * 1995 Toyota Celica GT4 * 1978 Fiat 131 Abarth * 1983 Peugeot 405 Turbo 16 * 1986 Peugeot 205 Turbo 16 * 1967 Renault R8 Gordini * 1983 Renault 5 Turbo 2 * 1983 Audi Quattro * 1971 Renault Alpine A110 References External links * Category:1999 video games Category:Dreamcast games Category:Infogrames games Category:Cancelled Nintendo 64 games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Need for Speed games Category:Off-road racing video games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Rally racing video games Category:Test Drive (series) Category:Video games developed in France Category:Video games set in Argentina Category:Video games set in Australia Category:Video games set in Corsica Category:Video games set in England Category:Video games set in Finland Category:Video games set in Indonesia Category:Video games set in Italy Category:Video games set in Monaco Category:Video games set in New Zealand Category:Video games set in Portugal Category:Video games set in Spain Category:Video games set in Sweden Category:Video games with user-generated gameplay content Category:Windows games de:V-Rally#V-Rally 2 ","title":"V-Rally 2"},{"id":"2146562","title":"Colma station"},{"id":"2146577","text":"Rayman Brain Games, also known as Rayman Junior, is an educational video game published and developed by Ubisoft. It is an entry in the Rayman series and stars the titular character. It was originally published as \\"Amazing Learning Games with Rayman\\" in 1996, and \\"Rayman Learning Center\\" in 1999. Gameplay and premise Rayman Brain Games is based in the Rayman series and stars protagonist Rayman. Other characters featured in the game from the series include Betilla the Fairy, the unnamed Magician, and the villain Mr. Dark. The story involves Rayman retrieving the Magic Book of Knowledge, which has been stolen by Mr. Dark. The game features exercises in phonics and mathematics with three difficulty modes for each. Each exercise is presented as a fork in the road. A phonics or math question will be posed, and the player must travel along the path marked with the correct answer. Travelling along an incorrect path will lead to Rayman's death. Non-educational platforming challenges, including bottomless pits, enemies, and spikes, fill the gaps between educational questions. Reception Rayman Brain Games has received mixed reception since its release. Writer Bonnie James felt that the game mixed educational elements with gameplay well and that kids who enjoy playing games will enjoy this, though they noted that it requires game playing experience to maximize enjoyment. They went on to praise the game's aesthetic and conceptual variety and the quality of the game's visuals. They felt that the game should have more choice to what players can do from the beginning, comparing the idea to how one can do questions out of order on a test. Writer Jennifer Beam felt that the experience may captivate players, but noted that its learning elements developed too slowly. They also criticized sound issues, which may hamper a child's ability to hear instructions or questions clearly. Active Learning Associates praised it for its addictive, action-oriented gameplay. Writer George Kalmpourtzis noted that the educational approach of \\"modifying and extending their game mechanisms\\" that Rayman Brain Games takes is a risky one, arguing that such games can result in no educational impact on players. They went on to argue that such a game does not lend itself to being used in classrooms due to being unhelpful as educational games. Writer Andrzej Sitek felt that it was an interesting approach to platform games, commenting on their issues with children's educational video games being unrefined.

He enjoyed a high-profile club and international career in the 1980s and 1990s. Prior to the 2013‚Äì14 season Hodge was appointed Development Squad Coach at Notts County.http://www.nottscountyfc.co.uk/team/backroom-staff/ On 27 October 2013 Hodge was appointed caretaker manager, reverting to his position as Development Squad Coach on 6 November 2013 with the appointment of Shaun Derry as manager. Playing career =Nottingham Forest= Hodge, a left-footed midfielder who was comfortable in a central or wide position, was born in Nottingham, England and joined his boyhood club Nottingham Forest as an apprentice in 1980 and made his debut against Ipswich Town on the final day of the 1981‚Äì82 season. A favourite of Forest's charismatic manager Brian Clough, Hodge became a first-team regular the following season as the club tried to build a new young team after the side which won two European Cups began to age and disintegrate. Hodge was a frequent goalscorer from midfield as Forest consolidated their League position were unable to push for trophies other than a semi-final in the UEFA Cup in 1984, where they lost in controversial circumstances to Anderlecht. In the summer of 1985, Forest surprisingly accepted an offer of ¬£450,000 from Aston Villa and Hodge ‚Äì whose nickname was Harry ‚Äì made his move from the East Midlands to the West Midlands. =Aston Villa= However, the move to Villa did work initially but really the team was in decline and once he had got England recognition it was perceived by the Villa fans that he was not committed to the Villa cause which was typified during a 4‚Äì1 home defeat by Norwich City where he his intended back pass to Kevin Poole was slotted in by a Norwich player ‚Äì the boos ringing round the ground signalled the beginning of the end for his Villa career. Hodge signed for Tottenham in December 1986 for ¬£650,000. =England= Though he was only three caps into his international career by the time Robson announced his squad, Hodge was given a place on the plane to Mexico, coming on as a substitute in the first two group games against Portugal and Morocco, which England lost and drew respectively. Making urgent changes for the final group game against Poland, Robson put Hodge in the side and he responded with an outstanding personal display within a crushing team performance. Hodge's superb left wing cross on the run gave Gary Lineker his second goal in a first half hat-trick which eased England's passage to the second round. There they faced Paraguay, and it was a sliding, stretching Hodge who kept in an over-hit cross from Glenn Hoddle, by pushing the ball into the path of Lineker to tap home. Again England were 3‚Äì0 victors, with Argentina awaiting ominously in the last eight. Here Hodge would earn his own mildly dubious place in England's history ‚Äì inadvertently setting up Maradona's 'Hand of God' goal ‚Äì and a highly prized memento, Maradona's No. 10 shirt.Argentina_v_England_(1986_FIFA_World_Cup)#The_\\"Hand_of_God\\" Hodge retained his place in the team as England began their qualification campaign for the 1988 European Championships with victories over Northern Ireland and Yugoslavia. =Tottenham Hotspur= Tottenham manager David Pleat put Hodge wide on the left of a vibrant, attacking five-man midfield which also included England teammates Hoddle and Chris Waddle, Argentinian veteran Osvaldo Ardiles and hardworking ballwinner Paul Allen. Each were expected to contribute goals and assists behind one main centre forward, Clive Allen, and it worked. Hodge scored on his debut on Boxing Day 1986 in a 4‚Äì0 thrashing of West Ham United and scored three times more while creating plenty for others as Spurs chased three trophies. Sadly for Hodge, his quest for domestic success eluded him again as Spurs were knocked out by fierce rivals Arsenal in the semi finals of the League Cup, tailed off in their First Division title charge and came third, and lost a thrilling FA Cup final at Wembley against Coventry City, following an outstanding 4‚Äì1 semi-final win over Watford in which Hodge scored twice. =Return to Forest= Robson recalled Hodge for the first game after the European Championships ‚Äì a 1‚Äì0 win over Denmark at Wembley ‚Äì as Hodge had been back on form after an astute Clough paid Spurs ¬£550,000 to take him back to Nottingham Forest. Hodge was again cast aside internationally afterwards, but his club form improved dramatically and he found himself regularly called up by Robson as a result, though actual appearances were scarce. Forest won the Full Members Cup in 1989 and then reached the League Cup final, with Hodge finally winning a major domestic medal. The 3‚Äì1 win over Luton Town at Wembley saw Hodge play a crucial part as it was he, making a foraging run from deep, who was brought down for the penalty which Nigel Clough converted, setting Forest on the road to victory. A week later, however, Hodge was one of the Forest players who had to cope with the horrors of the Hillsborough disaster during the opening minutes of their FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool. Hodge played in the rescheduled game at Old Trafford, which Liverpool won 3‚Äì1. The following season, Hodge played as Forest retained the League Cup with a 1‚Äì0 win over Oldham Athletic, having managed to force his way back into the England reckoning with a strong appearance as a substitute against Italy at Wembley, by which time England's place at the 1990 FIFA World Cup was secured. Hodge subsequently played in the final four warm-up matches before the tournament itself. To his delight, Hodge then made the final squad but he then suffered an injury and, as a consequence, the ignominy of being the only outfield England player not to kick a ball during the tournament, even though England reached the semi-finals. He didn't even regain his fitness in time to get on the pitch for the third-place play-off game. Robson quit after the World Cup and Hodge was not selected initially by successor Graham Taylor. At the time he was struggling to hold down a regular place in the Forest midfield after the emergence of teenage Irish phenomenon Roy Keane to partner Garry Parker, who had become the first-choice central midfielder despite being the only one of the three never to play international football. Taylor brought Hodge back for a 2‚Äì0 win over Cameroon early in 1991 and he was then given his 24th cap in a 1‚Äì0 win against Turkey in ƒ∞zmir in a qualifier for the 1992 European Championships. He had, however, lost his Forest place by then and was only named as a substitute by Clough for the 1991 FA Cup Final against his old club Tottenham Hotspur. Hodge came on as a second-half substitute but Spurs ran out 2‚Äì1 winners after extra time. =Leeds United= In the summer, Clough sold him to Leeds United for ¬£900,000 ‚Äì the highest transfer fee Hodge had commanded even though he was seemingly past his best and had seen his international career almost certainly brought to an end. He struggled to win a regular place at Elland Road, though played enough times in his first season to earn a First Division championship medal. That season he made 23 appearances and scored 7 goals; his goal tally included two braces in games against Sheffield United (won 4-3) and Southampton (drew 3-3) and the only goal in a 1-0 win over Liverpool. He had a loan spell with Derby County. =Late career= He joined Queens Park Rangers for a nominal fee in 1994. Two seasons followed with Hodge playing just 15 times. Next he joined Watford. He played twice for them in the 1995‚Äì96 season. An unsuccessful trial at Walsall came in the autumn of 1996, followed by a brief spell playing in Hong Kong. He signed for Division Three side Leyton Orient in March 1998, playing just once before finally retiring from playing at the end of the season. Coaching career Having gained an A coaching licence Hodge worked with Roy McFarland at Chesterfield. He had brief roles at Notts County as development squad manager, and as caretaker manager of the first team.

It is the PlayStation sequel of Ridge Racer (the arcade sequel is Ridge Racer 2). Like the original Ridge Racer, the player races computer-controlled cars with the objective of winning a series of races, and supports Namco's NeGcon controller. Ridge Racer Revolution adds two hidden cars, and two-player support via the PlayStation Link cable, and took roughly the same time to develop as the first. The intention was to increase the depth and add features. The game borrows most of its soundtrack from Ridge Racer 2. Ridge Racer Revolution was re-released in Japan for the PlayStation The Best range in June 1997, and for the Platinum Range in PAL regions the following year. The game received generally positive reviews, although some criticised its similarity to the original. Ridge Racer Revolution was followed by a sequel, Rage Racer, in 1996.  Gameplay  A race in progress. The gameplay system remains unchanged from Ridge Racer, the checkpoint and time limit system remain the same; running out of time ends the race and passing through checkpoints grants additional time,100 Per Cent Guide, p. 4. although the car drifting is more like Ridge Racer 2. The player drives using automatic transmission or manual transmission.Winning Strategy Guide, p. 6. Ridge Racer Revolution supports Namco's NeGcon controller,Special Extended Play, p. 71. and adds a rear-view mirror when using the in-car view. The game consists of three courses: 'Novice', 'Intermediate' (also called 'Advanced'), and 'Expert', each having different sections opened,Special Extended Play, p. 65. and incorporates modes from the original game; Race, against eleven opponents, and Time Trial, against one. Ridge Racer Revolution adds a mode: Free Run, in which there are no other cars and the player practises driving. There is no lap limit. How fast the cars run depends on which speed grade is used, selectable in Free Run, and can be unlocked for Race. It is not available in Time Trial. A new feature is the option to select the time of day in which the race takes place, although this is not available at the start of the game.Perfect Guide, p. 73. Ridge Racer Revolution features a two-player link-up mode which allows the players access to the original Ridge Racer's courses known as 'Special 1' and 'Special 2'.Special Extended Play, p. 70. There are two modes in two-player link-up: Race, identical to its single-player counterpart, and Versus, where only the players race against each other. Versus features a handicap option, increasing the speed of the trailing car. Like the first Ridge Racer, the player normally starts with four cars. The remaining eight are selectable on winning the mini game before the title screen (the mini game is Galaga '88 instead of the original game's Galaxian). They are mostly unchanged; their names (certain cars are named after other Namco titles) and specifications are similar to the first game.Perfect Guide, pp. 8-24. After the player wins the first three circuits, reversed versions are unlocked, and Time Trial features an additional opponent driving a secret car. There are three secret cars; the '13th Racing' (from the first Ridge Racer) of the Novice course, and the new '13th Racing Kid' (of the Intermediate course) and 'White Angel' (of the Expert course).Winning Strategy Guide, pp. 90,91. These cars are unlocked upon winning the respective course's Time Trial race.Certain Victory Guide, pp. 8,85. Ridge Racer Revolution features two hidden modes; 'Drift Contest', where points are earned according to how well spins are performed on certain corners,100 Per Cent Guide, pp. 68,69. and 'Pretty Racer' (also known as 'Buggy mode'), in which the cars size appears with deformed body sizes, similar to Choro-Q cars, which led to the arcade game Pocket Racer.Winning Strategy Guide, p. 94. Mirrored tracks that function identically to the original game are accessible.Perfect Guide, p. 76. Like the first game, a music CD can be inserted and listened to instead of the soundtrack. Unlike the first game, only the last course played is loaded into the PlayStation's memory; to switch, the game disc needs to be reinserted before loading.Certain Victory Guide, p. 82.  Development  Ridge Racer Revolution was developed over eight months by a team of more than twenty people, most of whom joined just for Ridge Racer Revolution. The biggest difficulties were the link-up mode, rear-view mirror, and running the game at high speeds. Each member had worked on other console games, and they commented that the graphics detail showed the improvements in skill and technique. The team wanted players to enjoy a more in-depth game than the original, so rather than develop a port of Ridge Racer 2, as many features as possible were added. The early designs for the new courses were made in a 'free run' programme, and used to see how fast the cars went. The rear-view mirror was added primarily with the two player link-up mode in mind. The music was mostly taken from Ridge Racer 2, and as a result, the sound was finished more quickly than the game. Soundtrack composition for Ridge Racer 2 involved Shinji Hosoe, Nobuyoshi Sano, Ayako Saso, and Takayuki Aihara, although new tracks were composed by Hiroshi Okubo and Nobuhide Isayama. The team kept exploring the PlayStation's capabilities to solve the high speed problem, although were confident it was possible. The designer, Hiroyuki Onada, commented that designing an original course was a challenge, and director Kazumi Mizuno believed that graphics quality would be degraded with a split-screen multiplayer mode, so the team decided to focus on the PlayStation's link-up instead.  Reception  The game was a bestseller in the UK. The additional features and improvements over the original in particular were given high praise. Coming Soon Magazine praised its multiplayer mode, saying it \\"will furnish many hours of competitive fun!\\", and in their conclusion remarked that the game \\"is an excellent racing game that will yield much excitement and challenges\\". A reviewer from Absolute PlayStation concurred with this by praising its playability, its \\"greatly\\" improved artificial Intelligence, and the two-player link-up feature. Both of Electronic Gaming Monthlys sports reviewers thought that Ridge Racer Revolution is better than the original, due to the cleaner graphics and improved handling on the cars, which it was believed makes them easier to control. David Hodgson of Maximum acknowledged the similarity to the original Ridge Racer but gave it a strong recommendation, arguing that removal of the slowdown and track updating of the original, the unlockables, and the two-player mode make it worth buying. His conclusion was that the game is \\"an instantly playable arcade racer that oozes options and playability\\". The Electric Playground reviewer complimented the additions and improvements, including the \\"much improved\\" graphics and the scene changes, about which it was commented that it was a \\"serious improvement\\". It was commented that the colours are \\"sharp and pretty\\", and the link-up multiplayer mode was lauded, although the remixed music tracks were criticised because they \\"pale greatly in comparison to the original tracks\\". The new tracks were complimented as \\"always challenging and fun to race\\" by Gamezilla's Mark Skorupa, who also praised Free Run, saying it's a \\"great way to learn the tracks\\". Major Mike of GamePro believed the game surpassed the first and upheld the Ridge Racer tradition, and Computer and Video Games Magazine reviewer commented that the game is \\"Everything Ridge Racer maniacs could have wanted from a sequel\\". Hugh Sterbakov of GameSpot was more critical. He called it \\"a clone of the original\\", and criticised the lack of split-screen multiplayer. Another critical reviewer was from Edge; he described the game as \\"virtually indistinguishable\\" from the first Ridge Racer, and commented that Ridge Racer Revolution does not fulfil the expectations evoked by the original. It was also stated that it is simply a \\"jazzed-up\\" Ridge Racer 2, and the visuals were criticised as \\"antiquated\\". Despite these criticisms, the handling was praised, and the gameplay was described as \\"varied\\". A reviewer for Next Generation contended that the original Ridge Racer was rushed in order to make it out for the PlayStation launch, and that whereas rival Sega had done an exceptional job of fixing their own launch day rush job with Virtua Fighter Remix, \\"Namco has simply released a disc with a new track, using the same flawed game engine\\". He particularly felt that the price was much too high for what was essentially an expansion pack, and concluded that anyone who bought the game would be \\"a half-step away from being conned\\". Will Groves of the Official UK PlayStation Magazine described the game as \\"a poor sequel\\", but liked the range of options provided. He described the game itself as \\"great\\", but further criticised it for not being fun, as he thought the feel is aggressive.

The over park includes the valley floor and parts of surrounding plateaus. Rivers originating on nearby Mount Gorongosa () water the plain. Seasonal flooding and waterlogging of the valley, which is composed of a mosaic of different soil types, creates a variety of distinct ecosystems. Grasslands are dotted with patches of acacia trees, savannah, dry forest on sands and seasonally rain-filled pans and termite hill thickets. The plateaus contain miombo and montane forests and a spectacular rain forest at the base of a series of limestone gorges. This combination of unique features at one time supported some of the densest wildlife populations in all of Africa, including charismatic carnivores, herbivores and over 500 bird species. But large mammal numbers were reduced by as much as 95% and ecosystems stressed during Mozambique's long civil conflict at the end of the 20th century. The Carr Foundation/Gorongosa Restoration Project, a U.S. non-profit organization, has teamed with the Government of Mozambique to protect and restore the ecosystem of Gorongosa National Park and to develop an ecotourism industry to benefit local communities.  History  = Hunting Reserve: 1920‚Äì1959 = The first official act to protect the Gorongosa region, Portuguese Mozambique, came in 1920, when the Mozambique Company ordered 1,000 square km set aside as a hunting reserve for company administrators and their guests. Chartered by the government of Portugal, the Mozambique Company controlled all of central Mozambique between 1891 and 1940. In 1935, Mr. Jose Henriques Coimbra was named warden and Jose Ferreira became the reserve's first guide. That same year the Mozambique Company enlarged the reserve to 3,200 square km to protect habitat for nyala and black rhino, both highly prized hunting trophies. By 1940 the reserve had become so popular that a new headquarters and tourist camp was built on the floodplain near the Mussicadzi River. Unfortunately, it had to be abandoned two years later due to heavy flooding in the rainy season. Lions then occupied the abandoned building and it became a popular tourist attraction for many years, known as Casa dos Le√µes (Lion House). After the Mozambique Company's charter ended, management of the reserve was transferred to the colonial government. Alfredo Rodriques was appointed Warden, replacing Jose Coimbra. Over the next 14 years Rodrigues initiated the first steps towards banning hunting and establishing a viable tourism business. In 1951 construction began on a new headquarters and other facilities at Chitengo camp, including a restaurant and bar. By the end of the 1950s more than 6,000 tourists were visiting annually and the colonial government had awarded the first tourism concession in the park. In 1955 the Veterinary and Animal Industry Services division of the colonial government assumed control of all wildlife management in Mozambique, including Gorongosa. Gorongosa was named a national park by the Government of Portugal in 1960. = National Park: 1960‚Äì1980 = Waterbucks Many improvements to the new park's trails, roads and buildings ensued. Between 1963 and 1965 Chitengo camp was expanded to accommodate 100 overnight guests. By the late 1960s it had two swimming pools, a bar and banquet hall, a restaurant serving 300-400 meals a day, a post office, a petrol station, a first-aid clinic, and a shop selling local handicrafts. The late 1960s also saw the first comprehensive scientific studies of the Park, led by Armando Rosinha, Director of Gorongosa, and Kenneth Tinley, an Australian ecologist. In the first-ever aerial survey, Tinley and his team counted about 200 lions, 2,200 elephants, 14,000 African buffalo, 5,500 wildebeest, 3,000 zebras, 3,500 waterbuck, 2,000 impala, 3,500 hippos, and herds of eland, sable and hartebeest numbering more than five hundred. The great development of Gorongosa until 1975 was made by Armando Rosinha. Tinley also discovered that many people and most of the wildlife living in and around the park depended on one river, the Vundudzi, which originated on the slopes of nearby Mount Gorongosa. Because the mountain was outside the park's boundaries, Tinley proposed expanding them to include it as a key element in a \\"Greater Gorongosa Ecosystem\\" of about 8,200 square kilometers. He and other scientists and conservationists had been disappointed in 1966 when the government reduced the park's area to 3,770 square kilometers. Meanwhile, Mozambique was in the midst of a war for independence launched in 1964 by the Mozambique Liberation Front (Frelimo). Fortunately the war had little impact on Gorongosa National Park until 1972, when a Portuguese company and members of the Provincial Volunteer Organization were stationed there to protect it. Even then, not much damage occurred, although some soldiers hunted illegally. In 1974, the Carnation Revolution in Lisbon overthrew the Estado Novo regime. When the new Portuguese authorities decided to abdicate power in their overseas territories, Mozambique became an independent republic. In 1976, a year after Mozambique won its independence from Portugal, aerial surveys of the Park and adjacent Zambezi River delta counted thousands of elephants in the region and a healthy population of lions, numbering in the hundreds. It was the largest lion population recorded in the greater Gorongosa region to date. = Civil War: 1981‚Äì1994 = Grey Crowned Cranes In 1977, the People's Republic of Mozambique, under the leadership of Samora Machel declared itself a Marxist-Leninist state.William Finnegan, A Complicated War: The Harrowing of Mozambique, Volume 47 of Perspectives on Southern Africa; University of California Press, 1993. A rebel army known as RENAMO sprung up to oppose the new government. Feeling threatened by FRELIMO's new one-party government in Mozambique, neighbouring Rhodesia and South Africa began arming and supplying RENAMO.Alex Vines, Renamo: Terrorism in Mozambique, Centre for Southern African Studies, University of York, 1991. Once Rhodesia became Zimbabwe in 1980, direct support for RENAMO came from South Africa with the intention of destabilizing Machel's government. Initially dismissed by Machel as a group of \\"armed bandits\\", RENAMO's war developed into a full-scale national threat by 1981.Michael Radu, The New Insurgencies: Anti-Communist Guerrillas in the Third World, A Foreign Policy Research Institute book; Transaction Publishers, 1990. In December 1981 the Mozambican National Resistance (MNR, or RENAMO) fighters attacked the Chitengo campsite and kidnapped several staff, including two foreign scientists. The Mozambican Civil War lasted from 1977 to 1992. The violence increased in and around the Park after that. In 1983 the park was shut down and abandoned. For the next nine years Gorongosa was the scene of frequent battles between opposing forces. Fierce hand-to-hand fighting and aerial bombing destroyed buildings and roads. The park's large mammals suffered huge losses. Both sides in the conflict slaughtered hundreds of elephants for their ivory, selling it to buy arms and supplies. Hungry soldiers shot many more thousands of zebras, wildebeest, African buffalo, and other ungulates. Lions and other large predators were gunned down for sport or died of starvation when their prey disappeared. A cease-fire agreement ended the civil war in 1992 but widespread hunting in the park continued for at least two more years. By that time many large mammal populations‚Äîincluding elephants, hippos, buffalo, zebras, and lions had been reduced by 95 percent. Surveys counted just 15 buffalo, 5 zebra, 6 lions, 100 hippos, 300 elephants and just a handful of wildebeest. The cheetahs, leopards, hyenas, wild dogs and rhinoceros were nearly extinct. Young male bushbuck = Post-war: 1995‚Äì2003 = A preliminary effort to rebuild Gorongosa National Park's infrastructure and restore its wildlife began in 1994 when the African Development Bank (ADB) started work on a rehabilitation plan with assistance from the European Union and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Fifty new staff were hired, most of them former soldiers. Baldeu Chande and Roberto Zolho, both employed by the Park before the Civil War, returned to take leadership positions. Chande was director of the emergency program and Zolho was wildlife coordinator and warden. Over a five- year period this ADB initiative reopened about 100 kilometers of roads and trails and trained guards to slow illegal hunting. = Restoration: 2004-present = In 2004 the Government of Mozambique and the US-based Carr Foundation agreed to work together to rebuild the park's infrastructure, restore its wildlife populations and spur local economic development‚Äîopening an important new chapter in the park's history. Between 2004 and 2007 the Carr Foundation invested more than $10 million in this effort. During that time the restoration project team completed a wildlife sanctuary and reintroduced African buffalo and wildebeest to the ecosystem. They also began the reconstruction of Chitengo Safari Camp. Due to the success of this initial three-year project, the Government of Mozambique and the Carr Foundation announced in 2008 that they had signed a 20-year agreement to restore and co- manage the park. Several thousand visitors now enter the park each year, most staying overnight at Chitengo Safari Camp. Some of these visitors go to see the progress being made in the restoration project, and many others are seeing the park for the first time. In July 2010, the Government of Mozambique made public the decision to increase the area of the Gorongosa National Park and to incorporate Mount Gorongosa (above 700 m) making true an old desire that had been presented in the 60s by the then Park ecologist, Kenneth Tinley. The Government also announced the official establishment of a Park buffer zone of 3,300 square km. Since the beginning of the project, aerial surveys of wildlife have shown sharp increases in the number of large animals. In the aftermath of Cyclone Idai, park rangers conducted rescue missions using their helicopter, boat, and tractor. According to Gorongosa Project president Gregory Carr, the park was \\"right in the middle of the impacted area.\\" Roughly half the park was flooded due to the cyclone, but impacts to wildlife were expected to be minimal as the animals would be able to migrate to higher ground. The protection of this area was cited as a reason that the impacts of the flood on the human population were less severe, as the protected wilderness area can moderate the flow of water. In March 2018, a leopard was captured by camera after 14 years.  Ecology  = Geology = The Park is in a 4,000-square-km section of the Great African Rift Valley system. The Rift extends from Ethiopia to central Mozambique. Massive tectonic shifts began forming the Rift about 30 million years ago. Other warpings, uplifts, and sinkings of the Earth's crust over millennia shaped the plateaus on both sides and the mountain to the west. Mozambique's tropical savanna climate, with an annual cycle of wet and dry seasons, has added another factor to the complex equation: constant change in soil moisture that varies with elevation. The valley is located 21 km west of Mount Gorongosa at 14 m above sea level. = Hydrology = Lake Urema in the dry season (late September) Gorongosa National Park protects a vast ecosystem defined and shaped by the rivers that flow into Lake Urema. The Nhandungue crosses the Barue Plateau on its way down to the valley. The Nhandue and Mucombeze come from the north. Mount Gorongosa contributes the Vunduzi. Several smaller rivers pour down off the Cheringoma Plateau. Together they comprise the Urema Catchment, an area of about 7,850 square km. Lake Urema is located in the middle of the valley, about three- quarters of the way down from the Park's northern boundary. The Muaredzi River, flowing from the Cheringoma Plateau, deposits sediments near the outlet of the lake slowing its drainage. This \\"plug\\" causes the Urema River to greatly expand in the rainy season. Water that makes its way past this alluvial fan flows down the Urema River to the Pungue and into the Indian Ocean. In the flooded rainy season, water backs up into the valley and out onto the plains, covering as much as 200 square km in many years. During some dry seasons, the lake's waters shrink to as little as 10 square km. This constant expansion and retraction of the floodplains, amidst a patchwork of savanna, woodland, and thickets, creates a complex mosaic of smaller ecosystems that support a greater abundance and diversity of wildlife than anywhere else in the park. = Vegetation = Scientists have identified three main vegetation types supporting the Gorongosa ecosystem‚Äôs wealth of wildlife. Seventy-six percent is savanna ‚Äî combinations of grasses and woody species that favour well-drained soils. Fourteen percent is woodlands ‚Äî several kinds of forest and thickets. The rest is grasslands subjected to harsh seasonal conditions that prevent trees from growing. All three types are found throughout the system, with many different sub-types and varieties. Tree cover increased throughout the park in the decades following the Mozambican Civil War, likely due to the dramatic declines of large herbivores such as elephants during that period. Mount Gorongosa has rainforests, montane grasslands, riverine forests along its rivers, and forests and savanna woodlands at lower elevations. Both plateaus are covered with a kind of closed-canopy savanna, widespread in southern Africa, called ‚Äúmiombo,‚Äù after the Swahili word for the dominant tree, a member of the genus Brachystegia. About 20 percent of the valley‚Äôs grasslands are flooded much of the year. = Mount Gorongosa = More than 2,000 people live on Mount Gorongosa. In July 2010 the government of Mozambique and the Gorongosa Restoration Project (headed by the U.S.‚Äìbased Carr Foundation) announced that Gorongosa Mountain would be added to the park bringing its total size to 4067 km2. This designation has contributed to an ongoing conflict between long-term residents of the mountain and representatives of the park. = Wildlife = Warthogs Gorongosa is home to a large diversity of animals and plants‚Äîsome of which are found nowhere else in the world. This rich biodiversity creates a complex world where animals, plants and people interact. From the smallest insects to the largest mammals, each plays an important role in the Gorongosa ecosystem. The park includes termite mounds used as shade by bushbuck and kudu. Many of the park's large herbivore populations were greatly reduced by years of war and poaching. However, almost all naturally occurring species‚Äîincluding more than 400 kinds of birds and a wide variety of reptiles‚Äîhave survived. With effective management and reintroductions of key species, wildlife populations will regain their natural numbers and help restore the park's ecological balance. In 2018, 14 African wild dogs from South Africa were reintroduced to Gorongosa National Park. The wild dogs had become extirpated from the park during the 1977-1992 civil war.

Plot summary The story follows an unnamed narrator who reads a story about a man who died after accidentally sucking a needle down his throat. He rages at the gullibility of humanity for believing such a hoax. He vows to never fall for such odd stories. Just then, a strange-looking creature made of a keg and wine bottles appears. The creature announces in a heavy accent that he is the Angel of the Odd ‚Äî and that he is responsible for causing such strange events. The man, unconvinced, drives the angel away and takes an alcohol-induced nap. Instead of a 20-minute nap, he wakes up two hours later, having missed an appointment to renew his fire insurance. Ironically, his house has caught fire and his only escape is out a window using a ladder the crowd below has provided for him. As he steps down, a hog brushes against the ladder, causing the narrator to fall and fracture his arm. Later, the narrator's attempts at wooing a rich woman to be his wife end in failure when she realizes he is wearing a wig which he must wear since the fire in his apartment singed off his hair. Then, he tries to woo another woman who also leaves him, scoffing at him for ignoring her as she passes. In reality, a particle had gotten into his eye, momentarily blinding him, just as she passed. Finally, the narrator decides his ill fortune is cause for him to end his life. He decides to commit suicide by drowning himself in a river after removing his clothes (\\"for there is no reason why we cannot die as we were born\\", he says). However, a crow runs off with \\"the most indispensable portion\\" of his clothes and the man chases after it. As he is running, he runs off a cliff. However, he grabs on to the long rope of a hot air balloon as it happens to be floating by. The Angel of the Odd reappears to him and makes him admit that the bizarre really can happen. The narrator agrees, but is unable to physically perform the pledge that the Angel of the Odd demands because of his fractured arm. The Angel then cuts the rope and the man falls down onto his newly-rebuilt house through the chimney and into the dining room. The man then realizes this was his punishment. \\"Thus revenged himself the Angel of the Odd.\\" Allusions The introductory paragraph of the story alludes (by last name only) to several authors, particularly Glover and Wilkie.

It is the fourth game in the R-Type series and the first to feature 3D graphics. The game received generally positive reviews from critics. Gameplay In-game screenshot, showing the player exchanging shots with ground-stationed enemies in the first stage. R-Type Delta is a shoot 'em up set in 2164. The game offers different fighters, with different Force and Wave Cannon combinations for the player to choose from. It also introduces the Dose System, which allows Forces to absorb energy through collisions with projectiles or enemies. Every Force has a Dose Gauge, and when the Dosage becomes 100%, the player can use the fighter's Delta Attack, a superweapon attack whose form depends on the fighter being used. Development Irem began development of R-Type Delta in early 1998. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). Around the beginning of its development, Taito released a conversion of their arcade game RayStorm for the PlayStation, whose 3D visuals caught the eye of several video game developers and lead to the release of several 3D shooting games for the console. Being rather impressed with its fast-paced action and polygonal graphics, Irem began to create a new R-Type game that could potentially rival the success of Taito's game. Lead by director Hiroya Kita, Delta was the team's first attempt at a 3D video game, which in early test versions proved problematic as many of their ideas were ineffective in 3D compared to the 2D gameplay that Irem had primarily focused on. Designer Koichi Kita recalls the 3D perspective being difficult to work with, notably with its level terrain as it made it difficult to determine the player's hitbox and often lead to the unintended destruction of their ship. Kita also claims the Force pod was a frustrating ordeal as the polygonal visuals made it look \\"fake\\" and unappealing. The idea for multiple playable ships was one of the team's most requested features, as they felt it would add replayability. Originally the player had two different ships to choose from, with a third being added later on to make it more \\"satisfying\\" and worthwhile. The goal of the playable ships idea was for each of them to be distinctively different from one another without disrupting the core R-Type gameplay, to make it feel like the player was playing an entirely new game with each ship. The R-9 from the original R-Type was chosen at the very start, followed by an updated version named the R-X. The R-13 ship was made to appeal towards more \\"hardcore\\", skilled players, with the \\"13\\" added to make it feel more sinister, due to the number's connection with superstition. The \\"blue\\" weapon for the R-X was revised several times as the team was unable to decide on what kind of lasers the ships' tentacle-laced Force could shoot. Stage designs were first created with the R-9 in mind, then later altered slightly to accommodate for the two new ships. Kita came up with the name R-Type Delta based on the fact three different ships were playable, which reminded him of the Greek symbol delta. Early planning documents for the game referred to it as R-Type EVE, a titled named after the novel Parasite Eve and met with a mixture of confusion from the production team. Other members suggested R-Type IV or simply R-Type, which they argued made it more recognizable. Kita created a questionnaire sheet with several possible names and sent it to other Irem employees, with Delta receiving the most votes. He also said the symbol represented the number 4, which alluded to it being the fourth mainline R-Type game. Towards the end of development, programmer Takayasu Itou added in the series' traditional \\"Kid's Mode\\" and \\"Human Mode\\" difficulties, with Kid's being the easiest and Human the hardest. The difficulty itself was made much harder than previous R-Type games as the team wanted the player to memorize stage patterns and learn from their mistakes, which they claimed made the game much more worthwhile to play. Reception R-Type Delta received positive reviews from critics, who generally praised its addictive gameplay and detailed graphics. Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewer Che Chou described the game as \\"the best R-Type [title] ever\\", while Peter Bartholow of GameSpot commented, \\"If there's one PlayStation shooter to own, R-Type Delta is that shooter.\\" The game's graphics were highlighted for their diversity, colors, details, and complex polygon models, with GameSpot noting that each enemy offers unique explosions and attacks. The publication also praised the \\"top- notch\\" and dynamic soundtrack for giving the game \\"a catchy fusion of rock and techno that changes with the game's surroundings.\\" Although the gameplay was praised for being both hard and rewarding, some reviewers found it unnecessarily difficult and frustrating. GameSpot highlighted the game's different ships, stating that each offers a strategic use of their weapons and abilities. Edge, however, noted the lack of innovation, concluding: \\"Deltas central gameplay remains a product of the '80s. Your performance upon entering a new level depends largely on trial and error, and the game is as much a test of memory as it is joypad dexterity. As such, it's refreshing and frustrating at the same time [...] A fine shoot 'em up.\\" Tom Russo reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Overall, a fantastic looking effort, but proof that the gameplay limits of this genre will soon relegate all 2D shooters to classic collections.\\" Notes References Category:1998 video games Category:Horror video games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:R-Type Category:Science fiction video games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games set in the 22nd century Category:Irem games Category:Horizontally scrolling shooters Category:Single-player video games ","title":"R-Type Delta"},{"id":"2146622","text":"is a 1998 shoot'em up video game compilation developed and published by Irem for the PlayStation. It was published by ASCII Corporation in North America, and by Virgin Interactive in Europe. R-Types contains two games from Irem's R-Type franchise - the original R-Type (1987) and its direct sequel R-Type II (1989) - alongside bonus material such as promotional artwork and a gallery spanning the series' history. Kazumi Kujo, the chief producer for the series, suggested R-Types to Irem executives whilst in talks of a potential new R-Type game. Having fallen into heavy financial difficulties and being weary of the current console game market, Irem proposed that Kujo and staff create a collection of early R-Type games as a way to test the market if a sequel was suitable. Both games were reprogrammed from scratch via reverse-engineering the original hardware, as opposed to using software emulation. R-Types allowed Irem to familiarize themselves with the hardware of the PlayStation console. R-Types sold well, and gave Irem hope in a new R-Type game returning a profit. The game was praised by critics for its quality and extra content, although some argued that it could have benefited from additional games and that the difficulty of the two games could turn off potential players. It was re- released as a budget title in 2003, and as a digital download for the PlayStation Network in 2006. Gameplay R-Types hosts several pieces of extra content, such as an \\"R Museum\\" containing information on the series' history. R-Types includes conversions of the arcade game R-Type (1987) and its direct sequel R-Type II (1989). In both games, the player controls a starship named the R-9 that must eradicate the Bydo, a powerful extraterrestrial race bent on the destruction of mankind. Gameplay involves shooting down enemies and avoiding collision with enemies, projectiles and obstacles. The R-9 can perform a charge shot by holding down the fire button, which when release will disperse a powerful blast that cuts through enemies. Destroying small \\"POW Armor\\" enemies will cause them to leave behind a power-up item, which will grant the player with one of several unique abilities when collected. The most notable of these is the \\"Force\\", an orange-colored pod that acts as a shield for the R-9 as well as being able to provide additional firepower. The Force can be attached to either the front or back of the R-9, and can also be launched forwards or backwards to fly freely. R-Type II adds a number of additional features and mechanics, including new weapon types and a new type of charge shot that creates a barrage of shots that home in on enemies. Alongside the ports of the first two games, R-Types includes several pieces of bonus content. The most notable of these is the \\"R Museum\\", an extensive gallery features models and information ships, characters, enemies and locations spanning the history of the R-Type series up to that point, as well as a history of the series and promotional artwork. A demo for the then- upcoming R-Type Delta can be played, which ends upon completion of the second level. Two FMV cutscenes can be unlocked by getting a certain score in R-Type and R-Type II. High-scores are saved to a PlayStation memory card. Controls for the Delta demo and the arcade ports can be modified to the player's liking. Development and release By the late 1990s, Japanese video game company Irem, known for several early arcade hits such as R-Type and Moon Patrol, were suffering greatly from financial difficulties, attributed to a severe lack of major money-making hits compared to their golden years. Shortly after the release of R-Type III: The Third Lightning for the SNES, Irem closed all of its video game production lines in 1994 to focus on restructuring itself and becoming more stable. After the company emerged as Irem Software Engineering in 1997, R-Type series chief producer Kazumi Kujo proposed a new R-Type game to executives. In an interview with Retro Gamer magazine, Kujo remembers Irem executives being very hesitant towards the idea, saying they felt the shoot‚Äôem up genre was a niche market. After several discussions, Irem proposed that Kujo and other employees create a compilation of early R-Type games as a way to test the market and see if a new sequel would be profitable. Kujo agreed, and got to work on what later became R-Types. As opposed to using software emulation like other classic game compilations used, Irem instead reprogrammed both of the included games from scratch via reverse-engineering the original arcade boards. R-Types allowed Irem programmers to familiarize themselves with the internals of the PlayStation console, which became useful for later projects. R-Types was completed by early 1998, and was released in Japan on February 5. As a way to create bonds with international publishers, and to rake in additional much-needed profit, Irem worked with European publisher Virgin Interactive and the American branch of the Japanese ASCII Corporation to bring R-Types overseas. Virgin released the game in Europe in October 1998, while ASCII America released it in North America a year later in March 1999. On October 21, 2001, Irem re-released R-Types in Japan as a budget title, published under the \\"R's Best\\" brand alongside R-Type Delta. R-Types was digitally re-released for the PlayStation Network service on December 21, 2006 in Japan, later released on April 24, 2008 in Europe and North America; due to Sony's license with Irem expiring, this version of the game is no longer available for purchase. Reception According to Kujo, R-Types sold well and gave Irem hope in a new R-Type sequel performing well financially in the market. Original copies have greatly risen in price over the years, and is seen as a collector's piece among R-Type fans. The game received mostly positive reviews. Computer + Video Games said \\"Although we've had some great shooting games recently, R-Types still stands out as one of the very best on the PlayStation.\\" The quality of the collection itself has been mixed, with some saying it could have benefited from additional titles. GameSpot said that Irem should have included additional games to make the price point justified, such as Super R-Type and R-Type Leo, which Famitsu agreed with. Official US PlayStation Magazine thought the game had a nice selection of bonus features, as did PSX Magazine. GameSpot said the presentation was good, but felt outside the CG movies it was rather basic. The included games, R-Type and R-Type II, were liked by several. Many applauded the conversions for being arcade- perfect, and the best ways to play them. Official US PlayStation Magazine said their quality was the standout among the collection, saying that ports as well-done as these made it one of the best classic game collections released for the system. IGN, GameSpot and PSX Magazine all stated that the games were fun to play and had an addictive quality to them \\\\- GameSpot in particular wrote that they offered plenty of gameplay time. Most publications agreed that the game's grand difficulty could put off players. GameSpot said: \\"For gamers less enamored of the past, you'll definitely want to rent before you buy.\\" CVG said that both games were just as fun as they were back in their heyday, saying it made for one of the best classic game collections released. They wrote: \\"While it's easy to write off classic game compilations as a waste of time and money, the good ones give you the chance to play the very best examples of video gaming excellence. R-Types is one of these.\\" In 2007, IGN re-reviewed R-Types for its \\"Retro Roundup\\" segment of articles, describing it as \\"a perfectly cool pairing of some very classic shooters\\". They liked the collection for its graphics, precise controls and spot-on emulation quality, saying that it makes for one of the best PSone Classic releases yet. IGN also said that both R-Type and R-Type II hold up very well, making it a great recommendation for fans of the genre.

It is mentioned by Homer in the Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad, and is said to have been destroyed by the Dioscuri, who hence derived the surname of Lapersae. There was also a mountain in Laconia called Lapersa.  History  The Peloponnese (Morea) in late medieval times, with major towns and fortresses In ancient times Las was a Spartan possession and in 218 BC the citizens of the city fought and routed a part of Philip V of Macedon's army. Las became part of the Union of Free Laconians in 195 BC when it separated from Sparta. The Spartans however recaptured the city in 189 BC. Sparta was then taken over by the Achaean League and Las gained its independence again. When the Romans took over most of Greece in 146 BC, Las and the other Free Laconian cities continued to be recognized as free cities. In Roman times, Las had a bath and a gymnasium. In the later period it was a place of no importance. Livy speaks of it as \\"vicus maritimus\\", and Pausanias mentions the ruins of the city on Mt. Asia. Before the walls he saw a statue of Heracles, and a trophy erected over the Macedonians who were a part of Philip V of Macedon's army when he invaded Laconia; and among the ruins he noticed a statue of Athena Asia. The modern town was near a fountain called Galaco (ŒìŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ∫œé), from the milky colour of its water, and near it was a gymnasium, in which stood an ancient statue of Hermes. Besides the ruins of the old town on Mt. Asia, there were also buildings on the two other mountains mentioned above: on Mt. Ilium stood a temple of Dionysus, and on the summit a temple of Asclepius; and on Mt. Cnacadium a temple of Apollo Carneius. Las is spoken of by Polybius and Strabo under the name of Asine; and hence it has been supposed that some of the fugitives from Asine in Argolis may have settled at Las, and given their name to the town. The site is not mentioned in Byzantine times until after the Frankish conquest of the Peloponnese, when Mani was given to John of Nully, who built a castle at Las sometime after 1218. This castle became known as Passavant or Passavas in Greek, a name probably related to the motto or war-cry Passe-Avant, \\"move forward\\", or to one of the similar toponyms in northeastern France. Nully's Barony of Passavant comprised four knight's fiefs, but virtually nothing is known about it. It was apparently short-lived, with the castle itself falling to the Byzantines during their first offensives in the Peloponnese in ca. 1263. The castle was in use once again during the second Byzantine domination. The castle of Passavas was occupied by the Ottomans for a short time when they took over the majority of the Peloponnese, in a failed attempt to keep control over the Maniots who refused to accept Ottoman rule. In 1601, a Spanish fleet led by Alonso de Contreras that was raiding in the area surprised the Ottoman garrison and sacked the city. It was regarrisoned in 1669, by the Ottoman general Kuesy Ali Pasha. The castle was captured again in 1684 by the Venetians and the Maniots. The Venetians carried off the cannons and destroyed the city so it would not be used again. When the leader of the Maniots was executed by the Ottomans, his mother led the men of Skoutari who dressed up as priests on Easter Sunday and were allowed entry to the castle. When they got in they took out their hidden weapons and not many of the 700 families inhabiting the castle escaped. The castle was abandoned after that and has not been inhabited since. Situation Las stood upon the hill of Passavas (), which is now crowned by the ruins of a fortress of the middle ages, among which, however, William Martin Leake, who visited the site in the 19th century, noticed, at the southern end of the eastern wall, a piece of Hellenic wall, about 50 paces in length, and two-thirds of the height of the modern wall. It is formed of polygonal blocks of stone, some four feet long and three broad. The fountain Galaco is the stream Turk√≥vrysa, which rises between the hill of Passavas and the village of K√°rvela, the latter being one mile and a half (2.5 km) west of Passavas.William Martin Leake, Morea, vol. i. p. 254, et seq., p. 276, et seq.; Peloponnesiaca, p. 150  Castle  Sketch of the castle by the Venetian Vincenzo Coronelli, 1689 The present castle on the site dates after the 13th century, perhaps even after the Middle Ages. It is of a quadrilateral shape, some 180 m long and 90 m wide. The castle originally featured large round towers on the northwestern, southeastern, and southwestern corners, but only the northwestern one survives. A square tower was located on the northeastern corner, the highest point of the castle; two other square towers were located in the middle of the northern and eastern walls. The wall surrounding the castle was not very tall‚Äîthe chemin de ronde is barely 2 m higher than the castle's interior‚Äîand its north-eastern side is particularly feeble, as it was protected by its location on the top of the rocky hill. The entrance was probably in the south. Unidentified structures were built adjoining the walls on the interior, while during the later Ottoman occupation a mosque was built in the centre.

The vocal part, including the melody notes and the text, is in the top stave. The two staves below are the piano part. An art song is a vocal music composition, usually written for one voice with piano accompaniment, and usually in the classical art music tradition. By extension, the term \\"art song\\" is used to refer to the collective genre of such songs (e.g., the \\"art song repertoire\\").Meister, An Introduction to the Art Song, pp. 11‚Äì17. An art song is most often a musical setting of an independent poem or text, \\"intended for the concert repertory\\"Art Song, Grove Online \\"as part of a recital or other relatively formal social occasion\\".Randel, Harvard Dictionary of Music, p. 61 While many pieces of vocal music are easily recognized as art songs, others are more difficult to categorize. For example, a wordless vocalise written by a classical composer is sometimes considered an art song and sometimes not.Kimball, Introduction, p. xiii Other factors help define art songs: *Songs that are part of a staged work (such as an aria from an opera or a song from a musical) are not usually considered art songs.Kimball, p. xiv However, some Baroque arias that \\"appear with great frequency in recital performance\\" are now included in the art song repertoire. *Songs with instruments besides piano (e.g., cello and piano) and/or other singers are referred to as \\"vocal chamber music\\", and are usually not considered art songs.Meister calls it \\"a variety of art song\\" (p. 13); Kimball does not include these works in her study of art songs.(p. xiv) *Songs originally written for voice and orchestra are called \\"orchestral songs\\" and are not usually considered art songs, unless their original version was for solo voice and piano.Meister, p. 14, and Kimball, p. xiv *Folk songs and traditional songs are generally not considered art songs, unless they are art music-style concert arrangements with piano accompaniment written by a specific composerMeister refers to them as a \\"hybrid medium\\", p. 14 Several examples of these songs include Aaron Copland's two volumes of Old American Songs, the Folksong arrangements by Benjamin Britten,Benjamin Britten, Complete Folksong Arrangements (61 Songs), edited by Richard Walters, Boosey & Hawkes #M051933747, and the Siete canciones populares espa√±olas (Seven Spanish Folksongs) by Manuel de Falla. *There is no agreement regarding sacred songs. Many song settings of biblical or sacred texts were composed for the concert stage and not for religious services; these are widely known as art songs (for example, the Vier ernste Ges√§nge by Johannes Brahms). Other sacred songs may or may not be considered art songs.Neither Meister nor Kimball mention sacred songs generally, but both discuss the Brahms songs and selected other works in their books on art song. *A group of art songs composed to be performed in a group to form a narrative or dramatic whole is called a song cycle. Languages and nationalities A recording of singer Helge Rosvaenge (Tenor) and Gerald Moore, Pianoforte, performing Der Feuerreiter. Art songs have been composed in many languages, and are known by several names. The German tradition of art song composition is perhaps the most prominent one; it is known as Lieder. In France, the term m√©lodie distinguishes art songs from other French vocal pieces referred to as chansons. The Spanish canci√≥n and the Italian canzone refer to songs generally and not specifically to art songs.  Form  The composer's musical language and interpretation of the text often dictate the formal design of an art song. If all of the poem's verses are sung to the same music, the song is strophic. Arrangements of folk songs are often strophic, and \\"there are exceptional cases in which the musical repetition provides dramatic irony for the changing text, or where an almost hypnotic monotony is desired.\\" Several of the songs in Schubert's Die sch√∂ne M√ºllerin are good examples of this. If the vocal melody remains the same but the accompaniment changes under it for each verse, the piece is called a \\"modified strophic\\" song. In contrast, songs in which \\"each section of the text receives fresh music\\" are called through-composed. Most through-composed works have some repetition of musical material in them. Many art songs use some version of the ABA form (also known as \\"song form\\" or \\"ternary form\\"), with a beginning musical section, a contrasting middle section, and a return to the first section's music. In some cases, in the return to the first section's music, the composer may make minor changes. Performance and performers Performance of art songs in recital requires special skills for both the singer and pianist. The degree of intimacy \\"seldom equaled in other kinds of music\\" requires that the two performers \\"communicate to the audience the most subtle and evanescent emotions as expressed in the poem and music.\\" The two performers must agree on all aspects of the performance to create a unified partnership, making art song performance one of the \\"most sensitive type(s) of collaboration\\". As well, the pianist must be able to closely match the mood and character expressed by the singer. Even though classical vocalists generally embark on successful performing careers as soloists by seeking out opera engagements, a number of today's most prominent singers have built their careers primarily by singing art songs, including Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Thomas Quasthoff, Ian Bostridge, Matthias Goerne, Wolfgang Holzmair, Susan Graham and Elly Ameling. Pianists, too, have specialized in playing art songs with great singers. Gerald Moore, Geoffrey Parsons, Graham Johnson, Dalton Baldwin, Hartmut H√∂ll and Martin Katz are six such pianists who have specialized in accompanying art song performances. The piano parts in art songs can be so complex that the piano part is not really a subordinate accompaniment part; the pianist in challenging art songs is more of an equal partner with the solo singer. As such, some pianists who specialize in performing art song recitals with singers refer to themselves as \\"collaborative pianists\\", rather than as accompanists.

Marimba translates to \\"a xylophone-like instrument\\" from an African language, probably Bantu. The glass keys are made of either hard glass (plate glass) or soft glass (stained glass). The keys are resonated with either a single open top box or individual resonators for each key. Mallets used to play the marimba can be constructed using a compressed silicone ball (bouncy ball) attached to one end of a wooden or synthetic dowell. These mallets bring out the purest sound from glass marimba. Other types of mallets are used for different effects. The tuning system of a glass marimba can be whatever is desired. Glass marimbas are utilised by the Brazilian percussion ensemble, Uakti. Construction Glass marimba can be constructed in a variety of ways. How one resonates the keys governs the construction method and design. Resonation can be accomplished using a single resonator which all the keys resonate into, such as an open top box, or individual resonators for each key which can be a tube, box, or sphere. Single box resonators can be constructed from wood, glass, or metal among a variety of materials. Individual resonators can be made from gourds, wood, bamboo, clay, glass, pvc, or metal, to name a few. The keys also govern the design of the marimba due to the fact that the keys are supported at points called nodes and these dictate the shape of the marimba due to the graduated lengths of the keys and how one supports them. Also, the width of the keys, which can be graduated, determines the overall length. Keys can be made from plate glass or stained glass. With stained glass, two pieces must be fused together in a kiln to obtain the necessary thickness of 1/4\\" for the most common glass marimba tunings, though thinner and thicker keys can be used for low and high tunings. Tuning is accomplished most commonly by removing glass from the end of the key which causes the note to go up. Removing glass from the bottom of the key will cause the note to go down but is only feasible if one is using opaque glass for the keys. The keys are best supported on a pad of open cell foam mounted to a thin piece of wood and encased in cloth. The keys are attached with double sided clear tape. Silicone glue is also used. An alternate method of attachment is to use posts between each key on one side and a single post going through a hole in the key on the other side.

It is the third game in the Syphon Filter series. Plot Secretary of State Vince Hadden brings in Gabriel Logan, Lian Xing, and Lawrence Mujari to testify in Congress about their relationship to the Agency. He believes all three to be guilty, and questions them after they assassinate Shi-Hao from a hotel in Japan. The three do not realize that Hadden is involved in the conspiracy, and is looking for scapegoats. Gabe begins by describing the first Syphon Filter investigation. He and Lian went to Costa Rica to find missing Agent Ellis. When they arrive, the two see that Erich Rhoemer has ordered Ellis killed, but Gabe must continue his mission and identify what Rhoemer was doing at the drug plantation. Gabe chases Rhoemer onto an airplane despite his Agency superior Edward Benton denying him permission. Gabe did not know back then that Benton and the Agency controlled Rhoemer, who escaped from the plane. Mujari testifies next, and tells Hadden how he once worked for a resistance during the Apartheid era in South Africa. At the Pugari Gold Mine, he discovered that mining slaves had caught a deadly plague and the mine owners were covering it up. Mujari retrieved samples and gave them to Teresa Lipan. When it's Lian's turn to testify, she details her first encounter with Gabe during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War and her role in the Costa Rica operation. Meanwhile, Gabe goes to Ireland with MI-6 agent Maggie Powers in an effort to scuttle a shipment of Syphon Filter, denying possession to the consortium and the local IRA cell. On board the S.S. Lorelei, Gabe plants several explosives and finds a document that will point to a virus test site in Australia. He also looks for any information on the mysterious arms consortium that controls the Agency. Gabe uncovers a mole in MI-6, Nigel Cummings, who is aiding them. He kills Nigel and secures the last viral transport on the docks. The Lorelei is sunk with all hands. Back in Washington, D.C., Gabe talks about his first meeting with Benton during the Soviet-Afghan conflict. Benton claimed to be a CIA agent transporting weapons to Afghans rebelling against the Soviets, but when Gabe and Ellis escort the convoy, the Afghans attack them. Gabe gets into Kabul and meets Lian, who sets up the diversion. However, a tank gets in their way, so Gabe destroys it. He learns that Benton was supplying arms to the Soviets, and was really an Agency operative. As Hadden questions Gabe, Lian teams up with Maggie to abduct Dr. Elsa Weissenger from the Australian test site. Elsa is ready to betray the conspirators since Aramov left her behind, and she has Lian assemble a vaccine for aborigines held captive by Commander Silvers. Silvers plans to kill the test subjects, so Lian kills him first. When she returns to Elsa, Lian finds her gone. Hadden accuses Gabe of lying and corruption. He believes Gabe murdered Teresa, but Teresa surprises him by appearing herself. Agency operative Jason Chance had only injured her, not killed. She describes her first meeting with Gabe during her time as an officer with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. A group of NSA agents headed by Colonel Silvers were posing as FBI to eradicate a private militia that had recovered data from a government satellite. Gabe, as an Agency operative, saved her life, and helped her when she rescued the wife and son of the militia leader. She left the ATF and joined the Agency. Teresa faked her death to find the people behind the Agency. Her investigations into Aramov yielded a connection to Hadden himself. Before Gabe can apprehend him, Mara kills Hadden. She and several consortium terrorists take over the Senate building, but Gabe prevents her from detonating any explosives. He chases her onto a train full of hostages, and wounds her. In a post-credits cutscene, Mara escapes despite being incarcerated. Gabe decides to find her, but for now the Syphon Filter crisis appears to be over with the death of Hadden. Gabe will become the new Agency director, and free it from corruption. Little does he know that an operation is ongoing near the S.S. Lorelei's wreck site. People are recovering the viral crates, and Mara is heard laughing, setting the stage for Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain. Release The game was originally slated for release on 25 September 2001. However, the fallout of the September 11 attacks forced Sony to postpone the release while modifying the marketing campaign. The game was released on 6 November. The game's original cover had Gabe and Lian in action inside a courtroom that had a U.S. flag in the background amidst a swirl of gas. The anthrax scare following the attacks resulted in the cover being changed to a simple one showing Gabe and Lian's faces, while the header line \\"United States Federal Bureau of Investigation\\" on the back cover was changed to \\"Agency Mission Briefing\\". Reception Tommy Layton reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Graphically solid, slickly presented, and sporting a solid selection of mission types in a complex storyline, Syphon Filter 3 is perhaps the last great PSX action title.\\" Syphon Filter 3 received mixed reviews. It received a score of 74.64% on GameRankings based on 28 reviews and 73/100 on Metacritic based on 19 reviews.

He became associated with the louche and bohemian atmosphere that existed in London's Soho district and was later immortalised in the comical play Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell by Keith Waterhouse. Life Bernard was born in Hampstead, London, and was one of three sons of the English architect Oliver Percy Bernard (1881‚Äì1939) and his opera singer wife Edith Dora Hodges (1896‚Äì1950). His siblings were the poet Oliver Bernard, and the photographer Bruce Bernard.Adrian Searle Obituary: Bruce Bernard, 31 March 2000 He was a paternal cousin to the actor Stanley Holloway.\\"He was the nice one: farewell to Oliver Bernard\\", London Evening Standard, 4 June 2013Holloway and Richards, pp. 74‚Äì75. Bernard attended Pangbourne College for two years before his parents responded to the college's protest that he was \\"psychologically unsuitable for public school life\\".Waterhouse (2004) Even while at school, Bernard had begun to explore Soho and Fitzrovia with his brother Bruce. Seduced by the area's lurid glamour, he moved there at 16, supporting himself in a variety of jobs that were at odds with his middle- class background, including boxing booth attendant, building labourer, kitchen assistant and coal miner, but still managed to build a circle that embraced Dylan Thomas, Francis Bacon, John Minton, Nina Hamnett, Daniel Farson and the lowlife of bohemian London. In his youth Bernard was considered extremely good-looking and supplemented his earnings with gifts and loans from wealthy older women. Some acquaintances suggested he did the same with older men but Bernard always vehemently denied this. Elizabeth Smart suggested that he try journalism and he started to write about his interest in horseracing in Queen magazine. Bernard continued to submit writing to various papers. He became Racing Correspondent for satirical magazine Private Eye, and even had work accepted by ex-employer Sporting Life. He was given a column in The Spectator in 1975. His column, entitled \\"Low Life\\" was contrasted with the \\"High Life\\" column by wealthy socialite Taki Theodoracopulos, writing as \\"Taki\\". While Taki's column described a life of yachts, casinos, and grand hotels, Bernard's was described by Jonathan Meades as a \\"suicide note in weekly instalments\\" and principally chronicled his daily round of intoxication and dissipation in the Coach and Horses public house and its fateful consequences. This was mixed with anecdotes, many of which were repeated in the play Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell, and ponderings on life.Bernard (1996) is a collection of his Low Life pieces from the Spectator. His lifestyle had an inevitable effect on his health and reliability, and the magazine often had to post the notice \\"Jeffrey Bernard is unwell\\" in place of his column. Though married four times (Anna Grice in 1952, Jackie Heard, Jill Wilsworth and Sue Gluck), he often remarked, only half in jest, that alcohol was the other woman. Over time his drinking affected his health more seriously; he was hospitalised for detoxification, he suffered from pancreatitis and then diabetes. His right leg was amputated, three years before his death. Instead of the regular notice, The Spectator announced, \\"Jeffrey Bernard has had his leg off\\". He died at his home in Soho at age 65 of renal failure after refusing further treatment by dialysis.

The station is the terminal station for BART on the San Francisco Peninsula, served by two lines: The SFO‚ÄìMillbrae line at all times and the Richmond‚ÄìDaly City/Millbrae line on weekdays before 9 pm. It is served by all Caltrain service except for a small number of limited-stop trains. The station is also served by SamTrans bus service, Alliance and Caltrain shuttle buses, and other shuttles. Rail service to the area began with 17 Mile House station, which opened in 1864 on land deeded by Darius Ogden Mills; it was renamed Millbrae the next year. The station was rebuilt in 1890 and 1907 after twice burning down. The 1907-built station was threatened with demolition in 1976, but was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. A modern intermodal terminal opened in 2002, connecting BART and Caltrain for the first time. The older station building was restored for use as a railway museum, which opened in 2004. Station layout Two BART trains at Millbrae, with the left train in revenue service Millbrae station has five tracks and three platforms at ground level, with a fare concourse on a mezzanine level above. The Caltrain tracks are on the west side of the station. The westernmost (southbound) track has a side platform; the northbound track uses half of an island platform shared with BART. South of the Millbrae Avenue bridge, the northbound track splits in two to form a triple-track section to allow passing trains. The northbound platform extends past the BART area as a side platform, and curves to serve the diverging track. BART has three tracks; the western track serves the east side of the northbound Caltrain platform (with faregates between the two systems), allowing a cross-platform connection between northbound service. The other two tracks serve an island platform. Because ridership at Millbrae is lower than expected, only the western track is used in regular service; the other two tracks are used for train storage. A 2,200-space parking garage (with direct access to the mezzanine), busway, and surface parking lots are located on the east side of the station. A smaller busway and parking lot for Caltrain are on the west side. The BART platform at Millbrae has six sculptures partially embedded in concrete blocks, with each figure representing a different era in community history. Forty-two terrazzo benches installed at the station show scenes of local nature and history. History =Former stations= The old Southern Pacific station near the current intermodal terminal In 1862, after buying a section of Rancho Buri Buri from Jos√© de la Cruz S√°nchez, Darius Ogden Mills deeded land to the under- construction San Francisco and San Jose Railroad in exchange for a station to allow guests to visit his estate. The line opened in October 1863; the adobe 17 Mile House station opened in 1864 and was renamed Millbrae the next year. The line was soon taken over by the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) for its Peninsula Commute service. The station burned in 1890. The station burned again in 1906 and was replaced with a two-story colonnade-style depot of standard SP design the next year. It was located on the west side of the tracks just south of Millbrae Avenue. In 1976, preparing to discontinue the money-losing Peninsula Commute (which instead became publicly funded as Caltrain), the SP proposed to tear down the station. However, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Southern Pacific Depot on September 1, 1978 after efforts by the newly formed Millbrae Historical Society. In August 1980, the building was moved south to make room for a widening of Millbrae Avenue. =Modern station= BART faregates which exit directly onto the northbound Caltrain platform Civic Center on display in 2018 As part of the BART SFO Extension, a new intermodal terminal for BART, Caltrain, and Samtrans was built in Millbrae just north of Millbrae Avenue. BART service to the $70 million facility began on June 22, 2003. The station was initially served by the Pittsburg/Bay Point line, plus a shuttle service to San Francisco International Airport station (SFIA). The shuttle service was discontinued on February 9, 2004. The Richmond line began serving Millbrae at weekday peak hours, with the Pittsburg/Bay Point line providing service at other times. BART service to stations in San Mateo County is funded by SamTrans, rather than county tax revenues. As ridership stayed below expectations, SamTrans had to pay a larger-than-planned operating subsidy to BART. On September 12, 2005, in order to lower these subsidies, BART reduced service so that only the Dublin/Pleasanton line served SFIA and Millbrae stations. SamTrans and BART reached an agreement in February 2007 in which SamTrans would transfer control and financial responsibility of the SFO/Millbrae extension to BART, in return for BART receiving additional fixed funding from SamTrans and other sources. On January 1, 2008, BART increased service to the San Mateo stations. Service to Millbrae station was provided by the Richmond line on weekdays, and the Dublin/Pleasanton line on weeknights and weekends. Direct service between SFIA and Millbrae was discontinued. On September 14, 2009, the Pittsburg/Bay Point line was extended to Millbrae on nights and weekends (with the Dublin/Pleasanton line cut back to Daly City station), restoring direct service at those times. On February 11, 2019, SFO‚ÄìMillbrae line service resumed on weekdays and Sundays. The station continues to be served by the Richmond line on weekdays, with the Antioch line (formerly the Pittsburg/Bay Point line) serving both SFIA and Millbrae on weeknights and Saturdays. On February 10, 2020, the SFO‚ÄìMillbrae line begna running during all operating hours, with the Antioch line operating only to SFIA. Millbrae station was expected to have some 16,500 daily BART boardings by 2017, but has consistently fallen well short of projections, with under 7,000 daily boardings by then. Caltrain no longer needed the historic station building after operations moved to the modern station. The Millbrae Historical Society negotiated with Caltrain to use the building as a museum in exchange for maintaining it. The Millbrae Train Museum opened in October 2004. In 2006, Pullman car Civic Center, built in 1941 for the City of San Francisco, was moved adjacent to the station and opened as an exhibit. The Society plans to acquire a locomotive and construct a section of track to run excursion service. =Future= Millbrae is planned to be a California High-Speed Rail station. Senate Bill 1029, passed in 2012, provided funds to lengthen the Caltrain platforms for future high-speed rail trains. The station is to be expanded to accommodate the service. Transit connections The east busway at Millbrae Millbrae station is served by a number of bus routes and shuttles: *Commute.org: Burlingame-Bayside Shuttle, Burlingame-North Shuttle, Foster City Shuttle *Caltrain: Broadway Millbrae Shuttle *SamTrans: ECR, SFO, 397, 713 *Sierra Point Shuttle A large busway is located on the east side of the station. It is used by the Burlingame-Bayside Shuttle, Foster City Shuttle, SamTrans routes 397 and 713, the Sierra Point Shuttle, and private shuttles serving Genentech's South San Francisco campus and various airport hotels. A smaller busway adjacent to the southbound Caltrain platform is used by the Burlingame-North Shuttle, Broadway Millbrae Shuttle, and SamTrans route SFO. SamTrans route ECR stops on El Camino Real to the west of the station.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1929 to 1945, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of John Bracken and Stuart Garson. Welch was born in Brechin, Scotland, the son of James Welch and Mary Ingram, and came to Canada with his parents in 1874. He was educated in Stratford, Ontario. He trained as a shoemaker with his father and followed that trade until 1893 when he moved to Manitoba and entered business as a merchant. In 1896, he married Hester Graham. Welch served as mayor of Boissevain, Manitoba from 1905 to 1906 and was chair of the Boissevain School Board from 1916 to 1929, also serving as president of the Conservative Association in the Turtle Mountain constituency during the same period. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a by-election held on June 22, 1929, following the death of former Conservative leader Richard Gardiner Willis. Welch defeated W.E. Campbell of the Progressive Party by 332 votes. The Conservatives were the main opposition party in Manitoba during this period, and Welch sat with his party on the opposition benches. Welch was narrowly re-elected in the 1932 provincial election, defeating a Liberal- Progressive candidate by only 55 votes. He was returned by an increased margin in the 1936 election. In 1940, the Conservatives joined with the Liberal- Progressives in a coalition government. Welch was chosen as one of his party's cabinet representatives, and was named a minister without portfolio on November 4, 1940. He was returned without opposition in the 1941 provincial election. Welch did not seek re-election in 1945, and resigned from cabinet on November 15 of that year. He died in Brandon and was buried in Boissevain.

Following Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, series protagonist Lara Croft is presumed dead, and a group of friends attend a memorial service at her home to recount tales of her earlier exploits. Gameplay follows Lara through linear levels, solving puzzles and fighting enemies. Some levels incorporate additional gameplay elements such as stealth. Despite the presumed death of Lara Croft in The Last Revelation, Core Design was told by Eidos to continue the series; while a new team worked on The Angel of Darkness for the PlayStation 2, a veteran team developed Chronicles based on concepts cut from The Last Revelation. Chronicles received mixed reviews from critics, being cited as running out of ideas for the series on the original PlayStation engine, and is remembered as one of the weakest Tomb Raider games, and at 1.5 million copies is one of the worst-selling games in the series. Gameplay The gameplay of Tomb Raider Chronicles is closely tied to that of Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation. Lara now can walk on a tightrope, grab and swing on horizontal bars, and somersault forwards from a ledge while crouching. Lara sports a new camouflage snow-suit and a black catsuit suitable for infiltration. The crossbow and grenade launcher from Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation have not returned, but the MP5 submachine gun and Desert Eagle from Tomb Raider III are revived. New equipment consists of a TMX-Timex that Lara uses to track her statistics and grappling gun, which fires a grappling hook into perishable surfaces and produces a rope from which Lara can swing. It is used to latch on certain areas of the ceiling and swing across vaults. Only one vehicle (of sorts) appears: a high-tech diving suit designed to penetrate deep waters. The ability to save wherever one desires returns from The Last Revelation as does the combining system of puzzle items used to progress in the level. Lara also uses a crowbar and a torch to progress through the virtual world. Secrets in Tomb Raider Chronicles are represented by a golden rose (much like the dragons in Tomb Raider II). In total there are 36 scattered throughout the game and when the player has found every one of them, a new special features menu is unlocked from the Options screen. Plot Following the events of Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, Lara Croft is presumed dead, buried under the collapsed Great Pyramid of Giza. At Lara's home of Croft Manor, three former friends and associates‚ÄîLara's butler Winston, Father Patrick Dunstan and Charles Kane‚Äîreminisce over some of Lara's early exploits following a memorial service. The first story follows Lara's quest through the catacombs of Rome in search of the Philosopher's stone. She is pursued by Larson Conway and Pierre DuPont, adversaries she would later encounter during the events of Tomb Raider. The second story, recounted by Kane, sees Lara hunting the Spear of Destiny, lost on the ocean floor since World War II. Infiltrating Zapadnaya Litsa, she smuggles herself aboard a Russian Naval submarine commanded by Admiral Yarofev and his Mafia handler Sergei Mikhailov, who also seeks the Spear. Lara recovers the Spear, but she is ambushed by Mikhailov. The Spear's power is unleashed, killing Mikhailov, damaging the submarine and wounding Yarofev. Lara escapes the submarine, but Yarofev remains behind as the Spear destroys the submarine. The third story, told by Dunstan, follows a teenage Lara when she secretly follows Dunstan to an island apparently haunted by demonic forces. Lara confronts several apparitions and monsters which inhabit the island, including a horse- riding humanoid demon called Vladimir Kaleta who was trapped in a prison of running water by the island's former monastic community. Dunstan is taken hostage by Kaleta, who forces Lara to block the river imprisoning him. Using a book discovered in the ruined monastery's library, Lara says Kaleta's demon name \\"Verdelet\\", taking control of him and banishing him from Earth. The fourth story, related by Winston, shows Lara infiltrating the corporate headquarters of her former mentor Werner Von Croy to retrieve the Iris, the pursuit of which first caused the schism between Lara and Von Croy. Their stories completed, the three toast Lara. In parallel to these events, Von Croy digs through the rubble of the Great Pyramid in a desperate attempt to find her. He finally discovers Lara's backpack among the ruins of the Great Pyramid but no sign of her body: he declares \\"We've found her!\\", presuming that Lara is alive. Development Core Design, developers of Tomb Raider since its inception, had grown fatigued of the series after producing three games successively since completing the original game. The team had attempted killing off Lara in The Last Revelation, but Eidos insisted that the series continue. Core Design split into two teams; one new team worked on Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness for PlayStation 2, while a veteran team developed Chronicles. Most of the team from The Last Revelation returned to create Chronicles. Designer Andy Sandham, speaking in a 2016 retrospective on the Core Design Tomb Raider games, called Chronicles \\"a load of old shit\\", saying that the staff created the game to earn a living rather than having any passion for it. In a different interview, he called it the hardest Tomb Raider title he worked on. Each area was designed around a different gameplay theme; Rome emulated classic Tomb Raider platforming, Russia was focused on action and stealth elements, Ireland forced players to handle a version of Lara without weapons, and the fourth area brought more stealth elements and new elements such as a companion helping Lara remotely. Several level ideas were originally pitched for The Last Revelation before Jeremy Heath-Smith, the head of Core Design, insisted that the latter game focus on tomb-based environments. As with The Last Revelation, a separate tutorial area based in Lara's home was removed to reduce the workload. Several gameplay elements were expanded and refined, including new moves including the tightrope walk and refining the inventory UI. For the PC version, Core Design released the level building tools as a level editor on a second disc. This was done as Chronicles would be the last game using that generation of technology, and they wanted to allow fans the freedom to create levels of their own. Chronicles continued the narrative from The Last Revelation, continuing to assume that Lara was dead. Due to this style, the narrative structure broke away from the linear style used in earlier titles in favour of an anthology format, with four separate adventures loosely tied together by framing sequences. Sandham wrote the game's script after the game's level structure was finalised. There were several continuity errors in the Rome segment of Chronicles related its chronological placement and Pierre's death, attributed by Sandham to not referring to the original game's script beforehand. The use of flashbacks rather than a continuous contemporary narrative allowed Core Design to create very different levels without being tied together with an overarching story. It was also designed to close off the original era of Tomb Raider‚Äîincluding its technology and storyline‚Äîprior to the release of The Angel of Darkness. The Irish levels were included by Sandham, who had a love of Irish folklore and was inspired by the cover art of The Black Island, a book from The Adventures of Tintin. Jean-Yves, a character from The Last Revelation, was originally part of the narrative and narrator of the Russian section. Due to a controversy about the character's similarity to real-life archaeologist Jean- Yves Empereur, Jean-Yves was replaced with Charles Kane. The music was composed by Peter Connelly, who returned from The Last Revelation. As with other his other projects, Connelly used early level builds as inspiration for his compositions. Taking inspiration from the narrative's gloomy tone, Chronicles used a darker musical style while retaining established Tomb Raider musical motifs. The main theme is very short compared to earlier Tomb Raider games, but Connelly had wanted something \\"epic\\". Time constraints meant that Chronicles did not have a proper main theme, with the closest being an opening segment that was inspired by Connelly's original plans. Reception It received mixed reviews from critics, although some reviews for Tomb Raider Chronicles were highly positive. IGN were primarily mixed, rating it a 6.5/10 and saying \\"Lara Croft's last adventure on PlayStation is also her very best. Still, it's just more of the same.\\" They went on to add \\"If you haven't liked any of the games or got tired of the series after the 2nd, 3rd or 4th games, then there's nothing here in Chronicles that will revitalise your passion for the series or get you to like it for the first time. Tomb Raider Chronicles is basically more of the same, so you probably know better than anyone else whether or not it's something that you'll like. GameSpot were mixed, claiming \\"The main problem is that the Tomb Raider series hasn't grown with the times\\". They were particularly complimentary of the graphics and said \\"Regarding the PlayStation version specifically, the graphics look better than ever before. The environments in the first Tomb Raider were very sparse and bland, but over the years the developers have been able to squeeze more and more out of the PlayStation. For a game on an aging system, there's a surprising degree of detail in Tomb Raider Chronicles -without a significant sacrifice of level size.\\" One particularly scathing review came from Electronic Gaming Monthly, who said \\"It should be illegal for you to own money if you even considered buying this crap.\\"Electronic Gaming Monthly [Jan 2004, p.189] While, GamePro awarded the game a score of 3.5/5, echoing the view that Tomb Raider was somewhat in need of an update, remarking \\"Despite the improved graphics and imaginative story, Tomb Raider Chronicles has the same controls as previous Tomb Raider games, and they feel as antiquated as any relic Lara ever unearthed.\\" David Chen reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Got 'em all? Go ahead ‚Äì you'll love it.\\" Retrospective staff opinions of Chronicles have been mixed, with many staff feeling it was their worst Tomb Raider project at that time due to a lack of enthusiasm and franchise fatigue. Also known as Ten Years of Tomb Raider: A GameTap Retrospective In journalistic retrospectives, Chronicles has been ranked as the weakest 32-bit entries, and one of the worst Tomb Raider entries prior to the notoriously poor The Angel of Darkness. In their financial report in February 2001, Eidos included Chronicles among the successful titles published during the late 2000 period. The game has sold 1.5 million copies worldwide; this made Chronicles the worst-selling Tomb Raider game up to that point and the second worst-selling main title in the franchise.

The interior of the Church of S√£o Pedro da Lourosa (Lourosa, Portugal). Church of St. Margaret of Antioch, Kopƒçany (Kopƒçany, Slovakia, 9th‚Äì10th century). Pre-Romanesque art and architecture is the period in European art from either the emergence of the Merovingian kingdom in about 500 AD or from the Carolingian Renaissance in the late 8th century, to the beginning of the 11th century Romanesque period. The term is generally used in English only for architecture and monumental sculpture, but here all the arts of the period are briefly described. The primary theme during this period is the introduction and absorption of classical Mediterranean and Early Christian forms with Germanic ones, which fostered innovative new forms. This in turn led to the rise of Romanesque art in the 11th century. In the outline of Medieval art it was preceded by what is commonly called the Migration Period art of the \\"barbarian\\" peoples: Hiberno- Saxon in the British Isles and predominantly Merovingian on the Continent. In most of western Europe, the Roman architectural tradition survived the collapse of the empire. The Merovingians (Franks) continued to build large stone buildings like monastery churches and palaces. The unification of the Frankish kingdom under Clovis I (465‚Äì511) and his successors, corresponded with the need for the building of churches, and especially monastery churches, as these were now the power-houses of the Merovingian church. Two hundred monasteries existed south of the Loire when St Columbanus, an Irish missionary, arrived in Europe in 585. Only 100 years later, by the end of the 7th century, over 400 flourished in the Merovingian kingdom alone.http://www.all-art.org/history128-2.html The building plans often continued the Roman basilica tradition. Many Merovingian plans have been reconstructed from archaeology. The description in Bishop Gregory of Tours' History of the Franks of the basilica of Saint-Martin, built at Tours by Saint Perpetuus (bishop 460‚Äì490) at the beginning of the period and at the time on the edge of Frankish territory, gives cause to regret the disappearance of this building, one of the most beautiful Merovingian churches, which he says had 120 marble columns, towers at the East end, and several mosaics: \\"Saint- Martin displayed the vertical emphasis, and the combination of block-units forming a complex internal space and the correspondingly rich external silhouette, which were to be the hallmarks of the Romanesque\\".V.I. Atroshenko and Judith Collins, The Origins of the Romanesque (Lund Humphries, London) 1985, p. 48. The Merovingian dynasty were replaced by the Carolingian dynasty in 752 AD, which led to Carolingian architecture from 780 to 900, and Ottonian architecture in the Holy Roman Empire from the mid-10th century until the mid-11th century. These successive Frankish dynasties were large contributors to Romanesque architecture.

Carolingian art is the roughly 120-year period from about 780 to 900, during Charlemagne's and his immediate heirs' rule, popularly known as the Carolingian Renaissance. Although brief, it was very influential; northern European kings promoted classical Mediterranean Roman art forms for the first time, while also creating innovative new forms such as naturalistic figure line drawings that would have lasting influence. Carolingian churches generally are basilican, like the Early Christian churches of Rome, and commonly incorporated westworks, which is arguably the precedent for the western facades of later medieval cathedrals. An original westwork survives today at the Abbey of Corvey, built in 885. After a rather chaotic interval following the Carolingian period, the new Ottonian dynasty revived Imperial art from about 950, building on and further developing Carolingian style in Ottonian art. =Ottonian art= Germanic pre-Romanesque art during the 120-year period from 936 to 1056 is commonly called Ottonian art after the three Saxon emperors named Otto (Otto I, Otto II, and Otto III) who ruled the Holy Roman Empire from 936 to 1001. After the decline of the Carolingian Empire, the Holy Roman Empire was re-established under the Saxon (Ottonian) dynasty. From this emerged a renewed faith in the idea of Empire and a reformed Church, creating a period of heightened cultural and artistic fervour. It was in this atmosphere that masterpieces were created that fused the traditions from which Ottonian artists derived their inspiration: models of Late Antique, Carolingian, and Byzantine origin. Much Ottonian art reflected the dynasty's desire to establish visually a link to the Christian rulers of Late Antiquity, such as Constantine, Theoderich, and Justinian as well as to their Carolingian predecessors, particularly Charlemagne. Ottonian monasteries produced some of the most magnificent medieval illuminated manuscripts. They were a major art form of the time, and monasteries received direct sponsorship from emperors and bishops, having the best in equipment and talent available. Regional styles =Croatia= St Donatus in Zadar, from the 9th century. In the 7th century the Croats, with other Slavs and Avars, came from Northern Europe to the region where they live today. The first Croatian churches were built as royal sanctuaries, and the influence of Roman art was strongest in Dalmatia where urbanization was thickest. Gradually that influence was neglected and certain simplifications and alterations of inherited forms, and even creation of original buildings, appeared. All of them (a dozen large ones and hundreds of small ones) were built with roughly cut stone bounded with a thick layer of malter on the outside. Large churches are longitudinal with one or three naves like Church of Holy Salvation () at the spring of the river Cetina, built in the 9th century, along with the Church of Saint Cross in Nin. The largest and most complicated central based church from the 9th century is dedicated to Saint Donatus in Zadar. Altar rails and windows of those churches were highly decorated with transparent shallow string-like ornament that is called pleter (meaning to weed) because the strings were threaded and rethreaded through itself. Motifs of those reliefs were taken from Roman art; sometimes figures from the Bible appeared alongside this decoration, like relief in Holy Nedjeljica in Zadar, and then they were subdued by their pattern. This also happened to engravings in early Croatian script ‚Äì Glagolitic. Soon, the Glagolitic writings were replaced with Latin on altar rails and architraves of old-Croatian churches. From the Crown Church of King Zvonimir (so called Hollow Church in Solin) comes the altar board with figure of Croatian King on the throne with Carolingian crown, servant by his side and subject bowed to the king. By joining the Hungarian crown in the twelfth century, Croatia lost its full independence, but it did not lose its ties with the south and the west, and instead this ensured the beginning of a new era of Central European cultural influence. =England= Benedictional of Saint Aethelwold, an Anglo-Saxon illuminated manuscript. Anglo-Saxon art covers the period from the time of King Alfred (885), with the revival of English culture after the end of the Viking raids, to the early 12th century, when Romanesque art became the new movement. Prior to King Alfred there had been the Hiberno-Saxon culture, producing in Insular art the fusion of Anglo-Saxon and Celtic techniques and motifs, which had largely ceased in Ireland and Northern England with the Viking invasions. Anglo-Saxon art is mainly known today through illuminated manuscripts and metalwork. =France= After the demise of the Carolingian Empire, France split into a number of feuding provinces, so that lacking any organized Imperial patronage, French art of the 10th and 11th centuries became localised around the large monasteries, and lacked the sophistication of a court-directed style. Multiple regional styles developed based on the chance availability of Carolingian manuscripts (as models to draw from), and the availability of itinerant artists. The monastery of Saint Bertin became an important centre under its abbot Odbert (986‚Äì1007) who created a new style based on Anglo-Saxon and Carolingian forms. The nearby abbey of Saint Vaast created a number of works. In southwestern France at the monastery of Saint Martial in Limoges a number of manuscripts were produced around year 1000, as were produced in Albi, Figeac and Saint-Sever-de-Rustan in Gascony. In Paris there developed a style at the abbey of Saint Germain-des-Pr√©s. In Normandy a new style developed from 975 onward. =Spain and Portugal= Saint Frutuoso Chapel in Braga, Portugal. The first form of Pre-Romanesque in Spain and Portugal was the Visigothic art, that brought the horse-shoe arches to the latter Moorish architecture and developed jewellery. After the Moorish occupation, Pre-Romanesque art was first reduced to the Kingdom of Asturias, the only Christian realm in the area at the time which reached high levels of artistic depuration. (See Asturian art). The Christians who lived in Moorish territory, the Mozarabs, created their own architectural and illumination style, Mozarabic art. The best preserved Visigothic monument in Portugal is the Saint Frutuoso Chapel in Braga. =Italy= Southern Italy benefited from the presence and cross- fertilization of the Byzantines, the Arabs, and the Normans, while the north was mostly controlled first by the Carolingians. The Normans in Sicily chose to commission Byzantine workshops to decorate their churches such as Monreale and Cefal√π Cathedrals where full iconographic programmes of mosaics have survived. Important frescos and illuminated manuscripts were produced. See also * Asturian architecture References * Joachim E. Gaehde (1989). \\"Pre-Romanesque Art\\".

The lake is commonly known for the clean and cold Appalachian mountain rivers that feed the lake to keep its waters cool and clear year-round. The Jocassee Dam, which forms the lake, is high and long. The lake is within Devils Fork State Park. Although most manmade structures were demolished before the creation of the lake, divers recently discovered the remains of a lodge which was left intact until the lake rose; it is now below 300 feet of water. Mount Carmel Baptist Church Cemetery was a setting for a scene in the film Deliverance (1972), starring Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight, produced before the lake was flooded. The site is now covered by 130 feet of water in the lake.CNN.com: \\"Divers find hotel 300 ft. down\\", February 25, 2009; accessed February 25, 2009. Several Waterfalls flow directly into the lake, including Laurel Fork Falls, Mill Creek Falls, Wright Fork Falls, and Moondance Falls. Hydrology Lake Jocassee and the surrounding bodies of water. A confluence of four rivers supplies Lake Jocassee's water. The farthest west of the rivers, the Whitewater River, flows southeast until it meets the northwest corner of Lake Jocassee. The Thompson River flows due south until it too reaches the lake in the northwest corner. The Horsepasture River feeds the lake from the northeast corner, along with the Toxaway River, which is directly east of the Horsepasture River. The Jocassee Hydro Station, located in the southeast corner of Lake Jocassee, separates it from the beginning of Lake Keowee, also known as the Keowee River. Lake Keowee's furthest extent to the south brings it close to the city of Seneca, with the old mill town of Newry actually on it. Unlike Lake Jocassee, Keowee is heavily settled, primarily because most of the land adjacent to Lake Jocassee is owned by Duke Power and the State of South Carolina. Natural history Devils Fork State Park portion of Lake Jocassee A rare wildflower, the Oconee Bell (Shortia galacifolia), native to only a few counties in the Blue Ridge area, was discovered in the area in 1788 by French botanist Andr√© Michaux. The creation of Lake Jocassee is said to have caused the destruction of the heart of the species' range. More recently, biologists have documented the occurrence of a number of rare, threatened and endangered species. The Eastatoee Gorge Heritage Preserve was transferred from Duke Power Company to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources in 1979 due to the extremely diverse flora occurring there. Wildlife management efforts in the Jocassee Gorges area began as early as the 1930s when the Chief Game Warden managed the stocking of trout from the Cleveland State Fish Hatchery, Table Rock State Hatchery, and the Walhalla National Fish Hatchery. This led to the investigation and improvement of fish populations in the area. People hiking, hunting, fishing, or nature watching benefit from the fish stocking and law enforcement of the Game Management Program (now WMA). History The name Jocassee comes from the legend of a Cherokee maiden. An Oconee tribe, the \\"Brown Vipers\\" led by Chief Attakulla, inhabited the west side of the Whitewater river, while a rival tribe, \\"The Green Birds\\", lived on the east. Legend says that a young Green Bird warrior, Lake Jocassee from the Bad Creek entrance to the lake. Nagoochee was not afraid to enter Brown Viper hunting grounds. On one occasion, he fell and broke his leg and was convinced he was going to die. Then he heard Jocassee, Attakulla's daughter, who brought him back to her father's lodge and nursed him back to health. Jocassee eventually fell in love with him, but in a later battle, Cheochee, Jocassee's brother, killed and brought Nagoochee's head back on his belt. Legend has it that Jocassee went into the water and did not sink but walked across the water to meet the ghost of Nagoochee. The name Jocassee means \\"Place of the Lost One.\\" The Jocassee Gorges area was once home to the part of the Cherokee Nation; it now lies beneath the surface of the lake, near the Toxaway River. Nearby Keowee Town was a major hub in the Cherokee Path that connected Cherokee towns and villages throughout the area. Early 18th Century traders delivered as many as 200,000 deerskins annually to Charleston, South Carolina and local Indians became well supplied with European firearms, ammunition, tools and clothing as a result. However, mounting discord between Europeans and Cherokees led to war in 1759. In 1785, General Andrew Pickens hosted a large gathering of Indian chiefs leading to a treaty that gave all of the Jocassee gorges area, with the exception of northern Oconee County, to the United States; the Oconee mountains were not ceded until 1815. European settlers, mostly of Scottish and Irish descent, came from Virginia and Pennsylvania as well as from Charleston. Land grants in the Jocassee area go back to 1791. Fishing Lake Jocassee holds state records for 5 species of fish, including three in the sunfish family (Centrarchidae). In 2001 a Redeye bass and a Smallmouth bass were caught. An Spotted bass was caught in 1996. The last two came from the salmon family (Salmonidae). A Brown trout was caught in 1987 and an Rainbow trout was caught in 1993.Freshwater Fish Records for South Carolina Economy The Jocassee Hydro Station, owned by Duke Power, in between Lake Jocassee and Lake Keowee, is a 610 megawatt pumped storage facility. Also, just off the Whitewater River, Bad Creek Hydroelectric Station is a 1,065 megawatt pumped-storage facility that started generating electricity in 1991 and is also owned by Duke Power.

The Maniots fought against a combined Egyptian and Ottoman army under the command of Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt. On March 17, 1821, the Maniots (residents of the central peninsula on the southern part of the Peloponnese) declared war on the Ottoman Empire, preceding the rest of Greece in joining the revolution by about a week. The various Greek forces won a quick string of victories. However, disputes broke out amongst the leaders and anarchy ensued. The Ottomans seized this chance and called for reinforcements from Egypt. The reinforcements came under the command of Ibrahim Pasha, the son of the leader of Egypt, Muhammad Ali. With the Greeks in disarray, Ibrahim ravaged the Peloponnese and after a four months siege he captured the city of Missolonghi in April. He then went back to the Peloponnese and turned his attention in June to Mani. Ibrahim tried to enter Mani from the north-east near Almiro on June 21, 1826, but he was forced to stop at the fortifications at Vergas. His army of 7,000 men was held off by an army of 2,000 Maniots and 500 refugees from other parts of Greece. Despite Egyptian and Ottoman artillery, the outnumbered Maniots managed to hold off the Ottomans. Ibrahim sent 1,500 men to attempt a landing near Areopolis and go north to threaten the Maniot rear. This force was initially successful; however they were repelled with heavy losses. When the Egyptians at Vergas heard that Theodoros Kolokotronis was advancing on their rear they retreated. In August, Ibrahim renewed the offensive and he sent a group of regular soldiers down the coast and they reached Kariopoli before they retreated. Ibrahim sent a force of 8,000 men down to Polytsaravo and on the way they destroyed a tower that was opposing them. When they reached Polytsaravo, they were faced by the Maniots in their forts. The Egyptians and the Ottomans were forced to retreat with significant losses. This was the last time Mani was invaded during the War for Independence, as Greece was liberated in 1828. Prelude The Greek War of Independence had started on the March 17, 1821, when the Maniots declared war on the Ottoman Empire at Areopoli.K. Kassis, Mani's History, 39. On March 21, the Maniot army of 2,000 men under the command of Petros Mavromichalis which also included Theodoros Kolokotronis, marched from Areopolis and headed for Messenia. The next day, they reached Kalamata, which had an Ottoman garrison and they captured the city on March 23. Victory or Death); TŒ±ŒΩ ŒÆ ŒµœÄŒπ œÑŒ±œÇ (With the shield or on the shield). The rest of Greece joined the war when Bishop Germanos of Patras declared Greece in rebellion on March 25.Peter Harold, Paroulakis, The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence, 56 At Kalamata, the Greeks established the Messenian Senate which governed affairs in the southern Peloponnese.P. Paroulakis, 57. Kolokotronis wanted to attack Tripoli but Petros Mavromichalis convinced him to attack the smaller towns first. Petrobey also sent letters to the courts of Europe telling them of the Greeks' plan.P. Leigh Fermor, Mani, 51 Petrobey finished off the letters by signing it with Petrobey Mavromichalis, Prince and Commander-in-Chief. On April 28, the Maniot army joined Kolokotronis forces at Karytainia.P. Paroulakis, 76. From there they went to Tripoli and started to besiege the city.P. Paroulakis, 77 The city eventually fell on September 23, 1821 and was sacked by the Greeks.P. Paroulakis, 82 Due to the unrelenting losses and stories of Greek atrocities in Tripolis, the Sultan became desperate and in 1824 he called on his Viceroy in Egypt, Muhammad Ali, to aid him.P. Paroulakis, 113 Ali promised to aid him in return for cession of the island of Crete, Cyprus, as well as making his son Ibrahim Pasha, Pasha of the Peloponnese. After his offer was accepted, Ali sent his son in command of the expedition. Meanwhile, the Greeks were in disarray because of political rivalries which had caused a civil war. Kolokotronis was arrested, his son Panos was killed, and his nephew Nikitaras forced to flee.P. Paroulakis, 120‚Äì121. Ibrahim used the confusion to land at Methoni in the Peloponnese.P. Paroulakis, 125 From Methoni, Ibrahim started pillaging the Peloponnese and taking many people as slaves.P. Paroulakis, 126 Ibrahim captured Tripolis but was stopped from capturing Nauplion by Kostantinos Mavromichalis and Dimitrios Ypsilantis. In retaliation, Ibrahim burnt down Argos before returning to Tripoli. Ibrahim decided to go with his army and join Reshid Pasha at Missolonghi in Central Greece.P. Paroulakis, 127 The Egyptians reached the city on December 12, 1825 and helped the Ottomans with the siege. On April 10, 1826, the city fell to the invaders and the city was sacked.P. Paroulakis, 128. Battle of Vergas The Battle of Vergas as depicted by Peter von Hess. Ibrahim sent an envoy to Mani demanding its surrender or else he would pillage it.K. Kassis, 40 He received the Maniotic reply of: > From the few Greeks of Mani and the rest of Greeks who live there to Ibrahim > Pasha. We received your letter in which you try to frighten us saying that > if we don't surrender, you'll kill the Maniots and plunder Mani. That's why > we are waiting for you and your army. We, the inhabitants of Mani, sign and > wait for you. Ibrahim, furious with the response, ordered an attack on northwestern Mani from Kalamata on June 23, 1826. Under his command was a force of 7,000 men, a mixture of infantry and cavalry. The invaders were forced to stop at the fortifications of the Maniots at Vergas near Almiro. Defending the walls were 2,000 Maniot soldiers and 500 Greek refugees. The Egyptian artillery failed to breach the walls, so Ibrahim decided to launch two ships with cannons and have them bombard the Maniot defences from the sea. He also combined this attack with infantry assaults, however these failed as the invaders were driven back from the walls eight times. The attacks lasted for a few more days before the Egyptians and Ottomans were forced to retreat when news arrived that Kolokotronis was approaching their rear with 2,000 men.B. Barrow, The Mani, 21. The Maniots chased the Egyptians up to Kalamata before withdrawing.K. Kassis, 41. Ibrahim lost 2,500 men at Vergas and the Greek losses are unknown. Battle of Diro Maniot woman. During the Battle of Vergas, Ibrahim decided to attack the Maniots from the rear. His plan was to send a small fleet with a few soldiers to land at the Bay of Diros, 2 kilometers south of Areopolis.P. Greenhalgh and E. Eliopoulos, Deep into Mani, 62. The aim of this was to capture the unguarded Areopoli, which cut the communication lines of the defenders at Vergas and demoralize them as well. He would then be able to attack the Maniots from the rear and control the mountain passes to eastern Mani and Gytheio. Authors Peter Greenhalgh and Edward Eliopoulos describe this plan as excellent. On June 23, he sent a small fleet carrying 1,500 to land at the Bay of Diros and to capture Areopolis. Aid came from other villages. On June 26, the surviving Egyptians were rescued by Ibrahim's fleet from the beach and those who were not rescued had to swim to the ships or be killed by the Maniots. This battle cost Ibrahim 1,000 men and he was forced to retreat from Mani after being defeated at Vergas.B. Barrow, 63. Battle of Polytsaravo After his retreat from Mani due to the defeats at Vergas and Diros Pasha renewed his offensive in August. Ibrahim's army was led by a Laconian from Bardounia named Bosinas who had assistance from the Egyptian fleet. On August 27, he reached Kariopoli in an attempt to take a safe path through the mountains. Before he reached the town of Polytsaravos, his army of 8,000 Egyptians was delayed by Theodoros Stathakos and his family of thirteen men who refused to let the invaders past their tower. Bosinas tried to negotiate with Stathakos. Stathakos, feigning surrender, told Bosinas to come and take his family's guns. As Bosinas came to retrieve the guns, the Stathakos family killed him. In retaliation, the Egyptians used their two cannons and blew up the tower. The Egyptians then proceeded towards the town of Polytsaravos and reached it on August 28. Awaiting them there were 2,000 Maniots behind their fortifications. The Maniots had chosen Polytsaravos as their position of defence as it was on high ground and was surrounded by rocky slopes.B. Barrow, 102 This would have meant that the Egyptians could have been stopped before they arrived at the town.B. Barrow, 103 As part of their defence plan the villages sent all the women and children to the mountains before improving the fortifications. As the Egyptians arrived at the walls, the Maniots sallied out and caught the Egyptians by surprise. The Egyptians, suffering losses, withdrew from Mani and back into the Laconian plain. The Egyptians had lost 400 men during the battle and the Maniots only lost 9. This was the last invasion launched against Mani. Aftermath Map of the boundaries of the independent Greek Kingdom. Even though this campaign is overshadowed by other battles of the revolution, it was one of the most important. The Maniates stopped the Egyptians and Ibrahim Pasha who had not been defeated this decisively before. The women who defeated the Egyptians at Diros have been given the name of 'The Amazons of Diros'.P. Greenhalgh and E.

Schubert chose to set the text of a poem by Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart, first published in the ' in 1783. The full poem tells the story of a trout being caught by a fisherman, but in its final stanza reveals its purpose as a moral piece warning young women to guard against young men. When Schubert set the poem to music, he removed the last verse, which contained the moral, changing the song's focus and enabling it to be sung by male or female singers. Schubert produced six subsequent copies of the work, all with minor variations. Schubert wrote \\"\\" in the single key of D-flat major with a varied (or modified) strophic form. The first two verses have the same structure but change for the final verse to give a musical impression of the trout being caught. In the Deutsch catalogue of Schubert's works it is number 550, or D. 550. The musicologist Marjorie Wing Hirsch describes its type in the Schubert lieder as a \\"lyrical song with admixtures of dramatic traits\\". The song was popular with contemporary audiences, which led to Schubert being commissioned to write a piece of chamber music based on the song. This commission resulted in the Trout Quintet (D. 667), in which a set of variations of \\"\\" are present in the fourth movement. Context Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart, who wrote the poem in 1783 The lyrics of the lied are from a poem by Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart. Opinion is divided on his abilities: The Musical Times considers him to be \\"one of the feeblest poets\\" whose work was used by Schubert, and comments that he \\"was content with versifying pretty ideas\\", while the singer and author Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau considered Schubart to be \\"a very talented poet, musician and orator\\". Schubart wrote \\"\\" in 1782, while imprisoned in the fortress of Hohenasperg; he was a prisoner there from 1777 to 1787 for insulting the mistress of Charles Eugene, Duke of W√ºrttemberg. The poem was published in the Schw√§bischer Musenalmanach of 1783, consisting of four stanzas. The Schubert scholar John Reed thought the poem to be \\"sentimental\\" and \\"feeble\\", with the final stanza of the poem consisting of a \\"smug moral\\" that \\"pointedly advises young girls to be on their guard against young men with rods\\". The academic Thomas Kramer observes that \\"\\" is \\"somewhat unusual with its mock-naive pretense of being about a bona fide fish\\", whereas he describes it as \\"a sexual parable\\". Fischer-Dieskau saw the poem as \\"didactic ... with its Baroque moral\\". Schubert did not set this final stanza, however, and instead concentrated on a person's observation of the trout and the reaction to its being caught by a fisherman. { + Final stanza of \\"\\", omitted by Schubert: original and translation  You who tarry by the golden spring Of secure youth, Think still of the trout: If you see danger, hurry by! Most of you err only from lack Of cleverness. Girls, see Seducers with their tackle! Or else, too late, you'll bleed. } Creation Schubert, by Wilhelm August Rieder, after an 1825 watercolour In 1815 Schubert wrote a series of twenty songs based on the works of Ludwig Gotthard Kosegarten (1758‚Äì1818). Among them was \\"\\" (D 229), written in July that year; John Reed sees the song as a forerunner to \\"\\", observing that \\"\\" and other similar songs, \\"convey an intensity of feeling that belies their small scale\\". From the following year to 1821 Schubert composed four songs using the poems of Schubart, \\"\\" (D518), \\"\\" (D342), \\"\\" (D550) and \\"\\" (D454). Although the first draft of \\"\\" was lost and the exact date of composition is unknown, the lied is known to have been written in early 1817, the same year he composed \\"Der Tod und das M√§dchen\\" and \\"An die Musik\\". After Schubert completed the song, one of his friends, Johann Leopold Ebner, recounted that Schubert was told that \\"\\" unconsciously quoted Beethoven's Coriolan Overture; on hearing the comparison, Schubert decided to destroy the manuscript, but he was stopped by Ebner and others. On 9 December 1820 the song was published in a supplement to the Wiener Zeitung, along with a number of others of Schubert's lieder. He received no payment for publishing his songs, but was provided with free publicity. Composition \\"\\" is written for solo voice and piano in the key of D major. The song is written with a varied (or modified) strophic structure, meaning the \\"verse music\\" is generally the same, with one different verse. According to the American historian Mark Ringer, Schubert used a \\"musical structure that reflects both the life cycle of the earth and the progress from innocence to experience\\". Schubert directed the piece to be played \\"Etwas lebhaft\\", or at a \\"somewhat lively\\" pace. The different verse is the third, and it demonstrates the \\"admixture of dramatic traits\\" in the lyrical song, which Fischer-Dieskau calls \\"a classic example of the strophic song with Abgesang ... 'after- strain'.\\" The \\"after-strain\\" comes at the final stanza; the composer and Schubert scholar Brian Newbould observed that for three-quarters of the song's final stanza, Schubert departed from the strophe to give a musical impression of the trout being caught, but returned to the strophe for the final couplet. The primary rhythmic figure in the piano accompaniment suggests the movement of the fish in the water. When the fisherman catches the trout, the vocal line changes from major to minor, the piano figuration becomes darker and the flowing phrases are \\"broken by startled rests\\". According to Mark Ringer, the melody evokes a \\"folklike na√Øvet√©\\" that \\"delivers both delight and emotional power\\". Schubart's poem takes the viewpoint of a male speaker, advising women to be careful of young men. By removing the stanza, Schubert removes the moral and creates uncertainty in the sex of the narrator. Variations After completing his original in 1817, Schubert made six subsequent autographs. These differing versions were not necessarily an attempt to improve a work, with some later versions being written from memory with only minor variations; Newbould considers that Schubert's close replication was a \\"feat of musicianship ... and a sign that Schubert spoke the language of music with the naturalness of conversation.\\" The differences between the autographs are small: according to Reed, they \\"are concerned ... with the tempo indication and the prelude ‚Äì postlude.\\" The first version, marked M√§ssig, has no introduction, although \\"the shape of the familiar introduction is already adumbrated in a seven-bar postlude\\". The draft is undated, although is from 1817 and is kept in the Stadler, Ebner and Schindler collection in Lund. A second copy, written in May or June 1817, was for Franz Sales Kandler's album: this version was marked Nicht zu geschwind (not too fast). A third variation was written during the night of 21 February 1818. Schubert and Anselm H√ºttenbrenner, a friend and fellow composer, had finished a few bottles of Hungarian wine when Anselm commented that his brother Josef was an aficionado of Schubert's work. Schubert completed a copy of \\"\\" that was \\"somewhat messy\\". The messiness was partly accounted for by Schubert's drunken state, but also explained by the accompanying note he wrote to Josef: \\"Just as, in my haste, I was going to send the thing, I rather sleepily took up the ink-well and poured it calmly over it. What a disaster!\\" The manuscript was held by the H√ºttenbrenner family for a number of years and was photographed in 1870, before being lost. Schubert wrote a further version in 1820 for publication in the Wiener Zeitung, and a final copy in October 1821 for publication in the Neue Ausgabe. The final version has \\"a five-bar piano prelude\\" and is presently in the Gertrude Clarke Whittall Foundation Collection of the Library of Congress. In 1819 Sylvester Baumgartner‚Äîa music patron and amateur cellist in Steyr‚Äîcommissioned Schubert to write a piece of chamber music based on \\"\\"; Schubert then wrote a quintet for piano and strings in which he quoted the song in a set of variations in the fourth movement. The piece later became known as the Trout Quintet (D. 667). Franz Liszt transcribed and paraphrased \\"\\" in two versions for solo piano. The first was in 1844 as the sixth part of his composition Sechs Melodien von Franz Schubert (S 560); the second transcription was in 1846 (S 564). Reception Information regarding the contemporary reception to \\"\\" is scant. Reed relates that the song had \\"immediate popularity\\", and that Schubert composing the Trout Quintet was evidence that \\"\\" \\"was already widely known\\" by 1819. Newbould agrees, pointing out that the quintet was \\"acknowledging the song's meteoric rise up early nineteenth-century Vienna's equivalent to the charts\\". Fischer-Dieskau takes a longer-term view of the song's popularity, writing that \\"the vividness of the imagery, with the alternate troubling and smoothing of the surface of the water along with the exuberance of the melody itself, account for the song's universal appeal\\".

Story Final takes place after several long wars against the Bydo, the main antagonist in the R-Type series. The player's first mission is to investigate a mysterious enemy inside a crashed space colony, the remnants of a large battle codenamed Operation Last Dance, a previous attempt to wipe out the Bydo once and for all. This investigative theme is incorporated throughout the game as each level is considered 'research' on the Bydo and unlocks a gallery of in- universe artwork and additional playable ships. Levels are prefaced with hints of the R-Type universe in the form of poetry. Eventually the player is tasked with finishing where Operation Last Dance left off, and their success with their task is determined by which route the player takes. The primary route sees the player confront the heart of the Bydo, sacrificing themselves and their ship to destroy it in a last stand. One of the alternate routes turns the player ship into a Bydo, and pits the player against their former allies. The final alternate route sees the player taken to the future to fight against an unrelenting wave of Bydo forces with no way to continue once they die. Gameplay Final provides 101 playable ships, including altered versions of ships appearing in previous R-Type games, together with many original ones. They are unlocked through a branching system accessed via the R Museum, which was originally featured in R-Types. The PlayStation 2's internal clock is incorporated into each ship's development history (shown through a commemorative plaque) when certain in-game tasks are completed. For example, ships unlocked in 2008 will be seen in the game as having been rolled out in 2168. The level physicality and enemies change size and character depending on the difficulty setting chosen by the player, providing different flight paths and playing experience for each level. Reception R-Type Final received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to a review aggregator website Metacritic.

Early life Scott-Ford was born in Plymouth, Devon, with the name Duncan Alexander Croall Smith, the son of Duncan Scott Smith who worked as a sick bed orderly in the Royal Navy. His father died on 23 March 1933 after catching pneumonia from the effects of taking an overdose of morphine in a suicide attempt, and Scott-Ford changed his surname in an attempt to improve his social status. He was educated at the Royal Hospital School, Holbrook from 1933 to 1937, and then on turning 16, enlisted in the Royal Navy and joined the shore establishment HMS Impregnable in Devonport in December 1937. Service career =Royal Navy= In June 1939 Scott-Ford was serving on HMS Gloucester which had called at Dar-es- Salaam on a goodwill visit. He met and became infatuated by a German girl; the Security Service later came to believe that he may have told her secret naval codes. Later in 1940 his ship was stationed in Egypt and Scott-Ford became obsessed with a prostitute whom he often visited; he was discovered to have altered the book of his Post Office Savings account and sent to a court martial which convicted him. He was sentenced to two years' imprisonment and dismissed from the service with ignominy but, after a successful appeal by his mother, the sentence was remitted to six months' imprisonment and an honourable discharge. =Merchant Navy= Repatriated to Britain to serve his sentence, Scott-Ford was released in July 1941 and stayed briefly with his mother. They quarrelled over his mother's use of the allowance from his Royal Navy pay which he sent home, with Scott-Ford accusing his mother of using it to buy a fur coat. Shortly afterwards he joined the Merchant Navy. He was on board the SS Finland, which arrived in Lisbon on 10 May 1942. Espionage Soon after his arrival in Lisbon, he was met in a bar by a man who told him that his name was Rithman and that he could get a letter to the girl he had known in Dar-es-Salaam. Rithman offered Scott-Ford 1,000 Portuguese escudos if he would confirm the rumour that all British ships had been ordered to be in port on 28 June. Scott-Ford undertook to try to find out and to meet again the following day. Although unable to find confirmation, Scott-Ford met with Rithman and a man who called himself Captain Henley and appeared to be Rithman's superior. Confessing to not having supplied the information wanted, the group nevertheless discussed issues such as the state of morale in Britain, public opinion of Winston Churchill, and the extent of air raid damage. Henley gave him a 1,000-escudo note and arranged another meeting a few days later. At this meeting, Scott-Ford was driven around in a car to disorient him and then taken to a room where he was asked to obtain more information about the location of British minefields, the arrival of American servicemen in Britain, and up-to-date copies of Jane's Fighting Ships and Jane's All the World's Aircraft. Henley asked Scott-Ford to sign a receipt for the 1,000 escudos, which Scott-Ford did, using his real name. His ship sailed the next day; all the crew were interrogated on arrival at Liverpool to ask if they had been approached by German agents. Scott-Ford stated that he had been approached but had not cooperated. =Blackmail= The Finland sailed for Lisbon again in July, arriving on 26 July. Scott-Ford again met up with the Germans, receiving another 500 escudos for expenses (again signing a receipt) although he had been unable to get the books which they had requested. The Germans threatened to give the receipts to the British Embassy. Scott-Ford did give details of the convoy he had sailed in and its protection, the location of an aircraft factory, and the training of troops for an invasion of Europe. At the end of the meeting, he was told to keep a record of the movement and speed of the convoy and given another 100 escudos. Another meeting was arranged, but Scott-Ford was unable to keep it as the Finland sailed for Manchester. =Confession= On arriving at Salford Docks on 18 August, Scott- Ford was again routinely asked about approach attempts from German intelligence, and this time described a man who had asked him about communism in Britain. The authorities had already had word from Lisbon that an agent codenamed 'RUTHERFORD' by the Germans had been talking and therefore arranged to see him again the next day. Scott-Ford admitted that he had received 1,600 escudos (about ¬£18 in 1942) for information. He was taken into custody and sent to the 'London Reception Centre', where refugees were routinely screened for German agents. The notes which Scott-Ford had made about the convoy were found in a search of his quarters on the Finland. Trial and execution In order to keep Scott-Ford in custody, an order was issued under Defence Regulation 18B for him to be detained. He was sent to Camp 020, an interrogation centre based at Latchmere House on Ham Common in southwest London where he complied with the authorities, although he became increasingly alarmed as he began to understand the seriousness of his situation. Professor A. W. B. Simpson, a historian of detention without trial, has speculated that Scott-Ford was offered his life in return for additional information on the Germans' intelligence system, but had no more to give. Scott-Ford was charged under the Treachery Act 1940, and after an in camera trial before Mr Justice Birkett, was convicted on 16 October. The only sentence on conviction under the Treachery Act was death; it was the first occasion on which Birkett had found himself pronouncing a death sentence. Interviewed in 1959 by John Freeman on Face to Face, Birkett said that he \\"had always rather dreaded it, but when the actual moment came, I did it without the slightest trace of emotion\\".\\"John Freeman brings you Face to Face with the great men of our time: Lord Birkett\\", BBC Television, 4 February 1959. Camp 020 were asked for their recommendation on whether Scott-Ford should be reprieved. The commandant wrote that there were no reasons for a reprieve: \\"Indeed, there may well be many who will agree that death by hanging is almost too good for a sailor who will encompass the death of thousands of his shipmates without qualm.\\"Hoare, Oliver Camp 020: MI5 and the Nazi spies (Public Record Office, London, 2000) Scott- Ford was hanged by Albert Pierrepoint at 9.00am on 3 November 1942 at Wandsworth Prison.Sailor Hangs As Traitor Reading Eagle, 3 November 1942.

Ali gave his daughter a striped garment and instructed her: \\"Take this to the Commander of the Faithful and tell him: 'My father says, \\"If you like this garment, keep it; if you don't like it, return it.\\"'\\" When Umm Kulthum brought this message to Umar, she reported, \\"He did not undo the garment nor look at anything except at me.\\" He told her that he was pleased, and so Ali consented to the marriage.

Two of her sons died while married to me, but I did not fear this for the third.\\" Umm Kulthum had no children by any of her three latter marriages. Battle of Karbala She is reported to have been present at the Battle of Karbala, during which her earings were taken from her by an attacking soldier.

The Islamic Prophet Muhammad was her maternal grandfather, and thus she is a member of his Ahl al-Bayt. She is often revered not only for her characteristics and actions, but also for her membership in, and continuation of, the biological line of Muhammad. Like other members of her family, she is considered to be a figure of sacrifice, strength, and piety in both the Sunni and Shia sects of Islam. Zaynab married ‚ÄòAbdullah ibn Ja‚Äòfar and had four sons and one daughter with him. When her brother, Husayn, fought against Yazid ibn Mu‚Äòawiyah in 680 CE (AH 61), Zaynab accompanied him. She played an important role in protecting her nephew, ‚ÄòAli ibn Al-Husayn, and because of this, she became known as the \\"Heroine of Karbala\\". Zaynab died in 681 CE, and her mosque is located in Damascus, Syria.Esposito, J.L., The Oxford Dictionary of Islam, New York:2003. Early life Zaynab was the third child of Ali ibn Abi Talib and his wife Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad. She was born in Medina in AH 5 (AD 626) on 5 Jumada al- Awwal (3 August Julian calendar). Like her two elder brothers, Hasan and Husayn ibn Ali, Zaynab was named by Muhammad. The name \\"Zaynab\\" means \\"the adornment of her father\\". Three of ‚ÄòAli's daughters were in fact named Zaynab, so sometimes this Zaynab was referred to as \\"Zaynab the Elder\\".Mufƒ´d, Mu·∏•ammad Ibn Mu·∏•ammad. KitƒÅb Al-irshƒÅd: The Book of Guidance into the Lives of the Twelve Imams. Trans. I.K.A. Howard. Partridge Green, Horsham: Balagha, 1981. Print. In appearance she resembled both her father and her grandfather. Fatimah died in 632 when Zaynab was six years old. As per her mother's request, Zaynab took on somewhat of a maternal role to her brothers. As a result, the siblings developed an especially close relationship. Marriage and family life When Zaynab came of age, she was married to her first cousin ‚ÄòAbdullah ibn Ja'far, a nephew of ‚ÄòAli, in a simple ceremony. Although Zaynab's husband was a man of means, the couple is said to have lived a modest life. Much of their wealth was devoted to charity. He maintained a reputation for liberality and patronage in Medina, earning him the nickname ‚Äúthe Ocean of Generosity‚Äù (Bahr al jud in Arabic). online ref: The marriage of Zaynab did not diminish her strong attachment to her family. Ali felt a great affection for his daughter and son-in-law, so much so that in 37 AH (657/65/8) when he became caliph and moved the capital from Medina to Kufa, Zaynab and Abdullah moved with him. Zaynab bore four sons ‚Äì ‚ÄòAli, Aun, Muhammad, and Abbas ‚Äì and one daughter, Umm Kulthum.. It is also believed that she had one more daughter called Umm Abdullah. Some sources suggest that Zaynab held sessions to help other women study the Quran and learn more about Islam. According to one of her biographies, The Victory of Truth, she started this practice in Medina and later continued it when she moved with her father and family to Kufa. Battle of Karbala Sayyidah Zaynab-ul-Kubra Mosque, Damascus, Syria Sometime after the death of the Muawiyah I, Husayn went to Kufa by the invitation of the people of Kufa for him to claim the leadership of the Muslim community. Zaynab accompanied him, as did most of his household. By the time Husayn's army arrived, the people of Kufa had changed their minds and betrayed and did not join Husayn's army at the Battle of Karbala. In many ways, Zaynab functioned as a model of defiance against oppression and other forms of injustice. When her nephew, Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin, was sentenced to death by the governor of Kufah (Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad), she threw herself over him in a protective embrace yelling \\"By God, I will not let go of him. If you are going to kill him, you will have to kill me along with him.\\" Moved by Zaynab's action, the captors spared Zayn al-Abidin's life. Because Zayn al-Abidin was the only one of Husayn's sons to survive the Battle of Karbala, this courageous action was pivotal in preserving the survival of an important part of Ali genetic line and thus the future Imams in Shia Islam. Zaynab and the other survivors of Husayn's army, most of them women and children, were marched to Damascus, Yazid's capital, where they were held captive. Tradition says that Zaynab, already in anguish due to the death of her brother Husayn and her sons Aun and Muhammad, was forced to march unveiled. This was an extreme indignity to inflict on a high-ranking Muslim woman, the granddaughter of Muhammad. While captive in Damascus, Zaynab held the first majlis, or lamentation assembly in the palace of Yazid to mourn the loss of her beloved brother Husayn.Pinault, David. \\"Zaynab Bint 'Ali and the Place of the Women of the Households of the First Imams in Shi'ite Devotional Literature.\\" Women in the Medieval Islamic World: Power, Patronage, and Piety. Ed. Gavin Hambly. New York: St. Martin's, 1998. Print. Another illustration of Zaynab's pious defiance was when a Syrian in Yazid's court demanded that he be given one of the younger captive girls, Fatimah bint Husayn.*4 Zaynab countered by suggesting that Syrian man was not worthy and did not have that type of authority. When Yazid claimed he had the authority to decide either way, Zaynab issued a scathing retort, answering ‚ÄúYou, a commander who has authority, are vilifying unjustly and oppress with your authority.\\"·π¨abarƒ´, Mu·∏•ammad Ibn-«¶arƒ´r A·π≠-. The History of Al-Tabarƒ´: The Caliphate of Yazid B. Mu'awiyah. Trans. I.K.A. Howard. Vol. XIX. Albany, NY: State Univ. of New York Pr., 1990. Print. This comment is representative of a larger sermon attributed to Zaynab in which she condemns Yazid and many of his actions, specifically focusing on his treatment of the household of Muhammad. The sermon is very eloquent and is reminiscent of the work in the Quran's exegesis, Zaynab did with other women in Medina and Kufa. The full text of this sermon is linked in the external links section below. Eventually, Yazid released his captives and allowed them to return to Medina. On the way back, the party stopped once again at Karbala to mourn the loss of Husayn and the others that died there. =Sermon at Yazid's court= At the first day of Safar, according to a narration of Turabi, when they arrived at Damascus, they and the heads of fallen ones were taken into Yazid's presence. The identity of each head and killed persons were explained to him. Then he paid attention to an objecting woman. Yazid asked: \\"Who is this arrogant woman?\\" The woman rose to answer and said: \\"Why are you asking them [the women]? Ask me. I will tell you. I am the granddaughter of Muhammad. I am the daughter of Fatimah.\\" People at the court were impressed and amazed by her. At this time, Zaynab gave her khutbah (, sermon). According to the narration of Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid, in Yazid's presence, a man with red skin asked Yazid to give one of the captured women as a bondwoman. Death The exact date and place of her death are not clear but it is probable that she died in the year 62 AH (681/682) some six months after her return to Medina. Some sources state that she died of illness during a journey with her family from Medina to Syria, at a location known as \\"Zaynabia\\". Others suggest she was assassinated by Yazid's soldiers while being extradited from Egypt. The anniversary of her death is said to be either the 11th or 21st of Jumada al-Thani, the 24th of Safar, or the 16th of Dhu al- Hijjah. Some suggest that her grave can be found within Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque in Sayyidah Zaynab, Syria. Alternatively, many Sunnis believe her grave can be found within Al-Sayeda Zainab Mosque, a different mosque that is located in Cairo. The Fatimid/Dawoodi Bohra support the claim that Zaynab is buried in Cairo. Their 52nd Dai, Mohammed Burhanuddin, made zarih (a cage-like structure surrounding the tomb) for the shrine in Cairo. The Fatimids and some others believe that the Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque in Damascus is actually the burial site of one of her sisters, Umm Kulthum bint Ali (perhaps caused by confusion between \\"Sugra\\" and \\"Kubra\\"). There is some historical evidence suggesting Zaynab lived in Cairo near the end of her life.\\"Balaghatun Nisa\\", by Abul Fazl Ahmad bin Abi Tahir =Ritual mourning= From the first days of the month of Muharram up to the tenth day of Ashura, during the mourning custom which includes sermons, reviewing narrations of the Battle of Karbala, not only the death of people who were killed in Karbala is commemorated but also the role of women in battle particularly Zaynab as \\"transmitter of Husayn ibn Ali's message\\" is done in Shia towns. The ritual of majlis, or lamentation assembly mourning the deaths of the Prophetic line, is still practiced as an integral part of Shia Islam. Historical Impact According to Rawand Osman, during the Battle of Karbala Zaynab is introduced as a woman who stood against cruelty, so this role has been practiced by women in the Iranian Revolution and also in the Lebanon in the last three decades. =Nurse's Day= In Iran, her birthday is recognized as Nurse's Day because she nursed children such as Husayn's son Ali among others but also because of her taking care of those wounded in the Battle of Karbala. As Rawand Osman mentioned, Zaynab's caring for Ali, who was among the survivors, shows the unusual role her she took on which went against traditional behavior. In addition to this, the author noted her devotional and political role.

The first national tallgrass prairie ever designated in the U.S. and the largest conservation site in the Chicago Wilderness region, it is located on the site of the former Joliet Army Ammunition Plant between the towns of Elwood, Manhattan and Wilmington in northeastern Illinois. Since 2015, it has hosted a conservation herd of American bison to study their interaction with prairie restoration and conservation. Ecology The tallgrass prairie reserve is in the central forest-grasslands transition ecoregion of the temperate grasslands, savannas and shrublands biome. Midewin remains the only federal tallgrass prairie preserve east of the Mississippi River, where surviving areas of that habitat are extremely rare. With the adjacent Des Plaines Fish and Wildlife Area and a number of other state and county protected areas in the immediate area, Midewin forms the heart of a conservation macrosite totaling more than 40,000 acres of protected land. The pre-European settlement vegetation map of Midewin shows most of the site was prairie prior to the arrival of European settlers. The northwestern corner of the site along Jackson Creek was forest. Another small, forested area existed in the extreme southwest corner of Midewin along the Kankakee River and Prairie Creek. Several not-for-profit conservation organizations have played active roles in the restoration of high-quality tallgrass prairie, dolomite prairie, sedge meadows, swales and related communities at Midewin. These include the Wetlands Initiative, Openlands, and the Illinois chapter of The Nature Conservancy and several other members of the Chicago Wilderness collaborative. History The name Midewin (, ) is a Potowatomi Native American word referring to the tribe's healers, who it was believed also kept the tribal society in balance. Research since the establishment of the park has found evidence of a pre-European‚Äìcontact village (c. 1600) from the Oneota culture in a place on the site called Middle Creek. =Establishment= The Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie was established by federal law in 1996. Major proponents of the prairie establishment and restoration included World War II flying ace William J. Cullerton. The Illinois Land Conservation Act (Public Law 104-106) created the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, designated the transfer of of land in Illinois from the U.S. Army to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service. The Illinois Land Conservation Act mandates that Midewin be managed to meet four primary objectives: :# To conserve, restore, and enhance the native populations and habitats of fish, wildlife, and plants. :# To provide opportunities for scientific, environmental, and land use education and research. :# To allow the continuation of existing agricultural uses of lands within Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie for the next 20 years, or for compatible resource management uses thereafter. :# To provide recreational opportunities that are compatible with the above purposes. =Land= MNTP entrance The first land transfer from the Army to the Forest Service took place on March 10, 1997, and included of land that was believed to be free from contamination. Subsequent land acquisitions place the current size of Midewin at about . =Bison= Bison at Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie in June 2016 In 2015, the prairie approved the use of 1,200 acres to establish a conservation herd of American Bison. The 20-year plan will study the relationship between the historic large grazing animal, which almost became extinct, and prairie restoration and health. In October, a herd of 27 bison were introduced. Four bulls were transferred from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Fort Collins, Colorado, and 23 cows were obtained from a ranch in Gann Valley, in Buffalo County, South Dakota. This is the first U.S. Forest Service project of its kind. By late spring 2017, births had increased the size of the herd to around 50. Access After a period of ecological restoration, part of the prairie opened to visitors in 2004. Today, over of the reserve are open, with public trails for non-motorized recreation. The MNTP headquarters entrance and visitors center is located on Illinois Route 53, near the center of the preserve.

He was born, died, and lived most of his life in Middleborough, Massachusetts, but traveled extensively down the Atlantic coast and lived far from home for months at a time while pursuing his career as a portraitist. Thompson married Olive Leonard on March 18, 1802 (his full-length portrait of her survives in the Metropolitan Museum of Art). Their son, Cephas Giovanni Thompson, became a painter of portraits and landscape in his own right, and a friend of the author Nathaniel Hawthorne. Cephas and Olive's daughter Florantha married missionary Granville Sproat and, after spending time teaching at La Pointe, Wisconsin, moved to California during the gold rush. Florantha and Granville's daughter Elvira (Cephas Thompson's granddaughter) married James Hutchings, an early promoter of Yosemite National Park. Although Thompson lived most of his life in Middleborough, he produced portraits at several locations in southeastern New England. From 1800 to 1825 he made many seasonal trips to the south to paint in Baltimore, Alexandria, Norfolk, Charleston, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Georgia. Between 1805 and 1821 Thompson also paid five extended visits to Bristol, Rhode Island, where he painted over 132 portraits of merchants, ship-owners, sea captains, and their wives and children. Approximately 65% of Thompson's Bristol sitters derived wealth from their head-of-households' participation in the African-Caribbean- Carolina slave-trade. In April 1817 Thompson advertised his presence in Providence, Rhode Island, where he intended to paint portraits \\"in the Hall of Blake's Hotel\\". Thompson may well have painted portraits in Providence during this visit; but none has yet been identified. At about age 50, Thompson retired from itinerant painting to reside year-round on his Middleborough farm. Among Cephas Thompson's portrait subjects are John Marshall, Stephen Decatur, David Ramsay of South Carolina, John Howard Payne, Elizabeth Wirt, James DeWolf, and George Washington Parke Custis, who was his pupil. As Deborah Sisum has noted and Keith Arbour has extensively documented, the most important patrons of Thompson's early career were members of the DeWolf family of Bristol, Rhode Island. The largest collection of Thompson's work is in the Boston Athen√¶um, which also holds some of the artist's papers. Portraits by Thompson are also in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Rhode Island School of Design Museum, the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum, Linden Place Museum, the Bristol Historical and Preservation Society Museum, and the Newport Historical Society. The amateur historian George Decas, devoted chapters 16 and 17 of his biography of Col. Peter Peirce to Cephas Thompson. Local historian James Blachowicz has shown that from about 1788 to 1805 Cephas Thompson engraved over 50 slate gravestones near his Middleborough home. One of these stones, for Robert Strobredge (d. 1790) in the Thompson Hill cemetery in Lakeville is signed ‚ÄúCephas Tomson, sculpt.‚Äù Blachowicz suggests that Thompson may have taken up this distinct art because of a kinship connection with Middleborough attorney and state senator Isaac Thompson (1746‚Äì1819), whose own relations included at least 8 gravestone carvers. Isaac Thompson was Cephas's uncle-by-marriage, that is, Cephas's mother Deborah's sister Lucy Sturtevant's husband. For additional details see James Blachowicz, From Slate to Marble: Gravestone Carving Traditions in Eastern Massachusetts, 1770‚Äì1870 (Graver Press, 2006), pp. 91‚Äì93.

Some of the water is treated by the MID and used as drinking water in Modesto. The two irrigation districts and the BLM control the land above the high lake level.

The reservoir could easily be tied into the Hetch Hetchy Project in the future, and the efforts of the Restore Hetch Hetchy group to drain the reservoir in the Hetch Hetchy Valley depend largely on that possibility. The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC), of which Hetch Hetchy Water and Power is a division, provided about 45% of the funds for construction of the 1971 New Don Pedro Dam and so has the right to store of water in the reservoir. Each year, San Francisco takes about . The rights of the MID and the TID are senior to those of SFPUC, however, so in dry years MID and TID can draw down the reservoir to meet their own needs before providing water to San Francisco's Hetch Hetchy Water and Power.

The intent is that when expressed in new variables, the problem may become simpler, or equivalent to a better understood problem. Change of variables is an operation that is related to substitution. However these are different operations, as can be seen when considering differentiation (chain rule) or integration (integration by substitution). A very simple example of a useful variable change can be seen in the problem of finding the roots of the sixth degree polynomial: :x^6 - 9 x^3 + 8 = 0. \\\\, Sixth degree polynomial equations are generally impossible to solve in terms of radicals (see Abel‚ÄìRuffini theorem). This particular equation, however, may be written :(x^3)^2-9(x^3)+8=0 (this is a simple case of a polynomial decomposition). Thus the equation may be simplified by defining a new variable u =x3. Substituting x by \\\\sqrt[3]{u} into the polynomial gives :u^2 - 9 u + 8 = 0 , which is just a quadratic equation with the two solutions: :u = 1 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad u = 8. The solutions in terms of the original variable are obtained by substituting x3 back in for u, which gives :x^3 = 1 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad x^3 = 8. Then, assuming that one is interested only in real solutions, the solutions of the original equation are :x = (1)^{1/3} = 1 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad x = (8)^{1/3} = 2. Simple example Consider the system of equations :xy+x+y=71 :x^2y+xy^2=880 where x and y are positive integers with x>y. (Source: 1991 AIME) Solving this normally is not very difficult, but it may get a little tedious. However, we can rewrite the second equation as xy(x+y)=880. Making the substitution s=x+y, t=xy reduces the system to s+t=71, st=880. Solving this gives (s,t)=(16,55) or (s,t)=(55,16). Back-substituting the first ordered pair gives us x+y=16, xy=55, which gives the solution (x,y)=(11,5). Back-substituting the second ordered pair gives us x+y=55, xy=16, which gives no solutions. Hence the solution that solves the system is (x,y)=(11,5). Formal introduction Let A, B be smooth manifolds and let \\\\Phi: A \\\\rightarrow B be a C^r-diffeomorphism between them, that is: \\\\Phi is a r times continuously differentiable, bijective map from A to B with r times continuously differentiable inverse from B to A. Here r may be any natural number (or zero), \\\\infty (smooth) or \\\\omega (analytic). The map \\\\Phi is called a regular coordinate transformation or regular variable substitution, where regular refers to the C^r-ness of \\\\Phi. Usually one will write x = \\\\Phi(y) to indicate the replacement of the variable x by the variable y by substituting the value of \\\\Phi in y for every occurrence of x. Other examples =Coordinate transformation= Some systems can be more easily solved when switching to polar coordinates. Consider for example the equation :U(x, y) := (x^2 + y^2) \\\\sqrt{ 1 - \\\\frac{x^2}{x^2 + y^2} } = 0. This may be a potential energy function for some physical problem. If one does not immediately see a solution, one might try the substitution :\\\\displaystyle (x, y) = \\\\Phi(r, \\\\theta) given by \\\\displaystyle \\\\Phi(r,\\\\theta) = (r \\\\cos(\\\\theta), r \\\\sin(\\\\theta)). Note that if \\\\theta runs outside a 2\\\\pi-length interval, for example, [0, 2\\\\pi], the map \\\\Phi is no longer bijective. Therefore, \\\\Phi should be limited to, for example (0, \\\\infty] \\\\times [0, 2\\\\pi). Notice how r = 0 is excluded, for \\\\Phi is not bijective in the origin (\\\\theta can take any value, the point will be mapped to (0, 0)). Then, replacing all occurrences of the original variables by the new expressions prescribed by \\\\Phi and using the identity \\\\sin^2 x + \\\\cos^2 x = 1, we get : V(r, \\\\theta) = r^2 \\\\sqrt{ 1 - \\\\frac{r^2 \\\\cos^2 \\\\theta}{r^2} } = r^2 \\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\cos^2 \\\\theta} = r^2\\\\left\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\right. Now the solutions can be readily found: \\\\sin(\\\\theta) = 0, so \\\\theta = 0 or \\\\theta = \\\\pi. Applying the inverse of \\\\Phi shows that this is equivalent to y = 0 while x ot= 0. Indeed, we see that for y = 0 the function vanishes, except for the origin. Note that, had we allowed r = 0, the origin would also have been a solution, though it is not a solution to the original problem. Here the bijectivity of \\\\Phi is crucial. The function is always positive (for x,y\\\\in\\\\reals), hence the absolute values. =Differentiation= The chain rule is used to simplify complicated differentiation. For example, consider the problem of calculating the derivative : \\\\frac d {d x}\\\\sin(x^2). Writing : y = \\\\sin u \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad u = x^2 we get : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\frac d {dx} \\\\sin(x^2) = \\\\overbrace{ \\\\frac {dy}{dx} = \\\\frac{dy}{du}\\\\, \\\\frac{du}{dx} }^{\\\\text{This part is the chain rule.}} = \\\\left( \\\\frac d {du} \\\\sin u \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac d {dx} x^2 \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] = {} & \\\\big( \\\\cos u \\\\big) (2x) = \\\\cos(x^2) \\\\cdot 2x. \\\\end{align} =Integration= Difficult integrals may often be evaluated by changing variables; this is enabled by the substitution rule and is analogous to the use of the chain rule above. Difficult integrals may also be solved by simplifying the integral using a change of variables given by the corresponding Jacobian matrix and determinant. Using the Jacobian determinant and the corresponding change of variable that it gives is the basis of coordinate systems such as polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinate systems. =Differential equations= Variable changes for differentiation and integration are taught in elementary calculus and the steps are rarely carried out in full. The very broad use of variable changes is apparent when considering differential equations, where the independent variables may be changed using the chain rule or the dependent variables are changed resulting in some differentiation to be carried out. Exotic changes, such as the mingling of dependent and independent variables in point and contact transformations, can be very complicated but allow much freedom. Very often, a general form for a change is substituted into a problem and parameters picked along the way to best simplify the problem. =Scaling and shifting= Probably the simplest change is the scaling and shifting of variables, that is replacing them with new variables that are \\"stretched\\" and \\"moved\\" by constant amounts. This is very common in practical applications to get physical parameters out of problems. For an nth order derivative, the change simply results in :\\\\frac{d^n y}{d x^n} = \\\\frac{y_\\\\text{scale}}{x_\\\\text{scale}^n} \\\\frac{d^n \\\\hat y}{d \\\\hat x^n} where :x = \\\\hat x x_\\\\text{scale} + x_\\\\text{shift} :y = \\\\hat y y_\\\\text{scale} + y_\\\\text{shift}. This may be shown readily through the chain rule and linearity of differentiation. This change is very common in practical applications to get physical parameters out of problems, for example, the boundary value problem :\\\\mu \\\\frac{d^2 u}{d y^2} = \\\\frac{d p}{d x} \\\\quad ; \\\\quad u(0) = u(L) = 0 describes parallel fluid flow between flat solid walls separated by a distance Œ¥; Œº is the viscosity and d p/d x the pressure gradient, both constants. By scaling the variables the problem becomes :\\\\frac{d^2 \\\\hat u}{d \\\\hat y^2} = 1 \\\\quad ; \\\\quad \\\\hat u(0) = \\\\hat u(1) = 0 where :y = \\\\hat y L \\\\qquad \\\\text{and} \\\\qquad u = \\\\hat u \\\\frac{L^2}{\\\\mu} \\\\frac{d p}{d x}. Scaling is useful for many reasons. It simplifies analysis both by reducing the number of parameters and by simply making the problem neater. Proper scaling may normalize variables, that is make them have a sensible unitless range such as 0 to 1. Finally, if a problem mandates numeric solution, the fewer the parameters the fewer the number of computations. =Momentum vs. velocity= Consider a system of equations : \\\\begin{align} m \\\\dot v & = - \\\\frac{ \\\\partial H }{ \\\\partial x } \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] m \\\\dot x & = \\\\frac{ \\\\partial H }{ \\\\partial v } \\\\end{align} for a given function H(x, v). The mass can be eliminated by the (trivial) substitution \\\\Phi(p) = 1/m \\\\cdot p. Clearly this is a bijective map from \\\\mathbb{R} to \\\\mathbb{R}. Under the substitution v = \\\\Phi(p) the system becomes : \\\\begin{align} \\\\dot p & = - \\\\frac{ \\\\partial H }{ \\\\partial x } \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] \\\\dot x & = \\\\frac{ \\\\partial H }{ \\\\partial p } \\\\end{align} =Lagrangian mechanics= Given a force field \\\\varphi(t, x, v), Newton's equations of motion are :m \\\\ddot x = \\\\varphi(t, x, v). Lagrange examined how these equations of motion change under an arbitrary substitution of variables x = \\\\Psi(t, y), v = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Psi(t, y)}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Psi(t, y)}{\\\\partial y} \\\\cdot w. He found that the equations : \\\\frac{ \\\\partial{L} }{ \\\\partial y} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} \\\\frac{\\\\partial{L}}{\\\\partial{w}} are equivalent to Newton's equations for the function L = T - V, where T is the kinetic, and V the potential energy. In fact, when the substitution is chosen well (exploiting for example symmetries and constraints of the system) these equations are much easier to solve than Newton's equations in Cartesian coordinates.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Conservative representative from 1932 to 1945. Biography Ketchen was born to a Scottish family living in Sholopore, India. His father, Major James Ketchen, served in the Indian Army. The younger Ketchen was educated at Wellington College and Royal Military College, Sandhurst, England, and was commissioned into the British Army as a second-lieutenant in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, but resigned after a couple of years. He came to Canada in 1894, serving for a time with the North-West Mounted Police. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War, Ketchen volunteered for service with Lord Strathcona's Corps, a privately funded unit of Canadian soldiers, and was commissioned a lieutenant on 17 March 1900 as the corps embarked for South Africa. He later saw active service in World War I, commanding the Sixth Canadian Infantry Brigade in France from 1915 to 1918. Ketchen was nearly dismissed after being used as a scapegoat for following orders from the British. The Battle of St-Eloi in April 1916. After British troops had taken a large crater near the ruins of the Belgian town of St Eloi, his brigade was ordered to hold the gain against German counter-attacks.90 Years and Counting , Military Communications and Electronics Museum, Kingston, Ontario, Retrieved 5 November 2007 Due to dreadful mismanagement of the Canadian forces by Ketchen and his divisional commander Richard Turner, German soldiers overran the crater, causing 1,400 Canadian casualties and retaking the land around the crater, negating the gains made at heavy cost just a few days before.Sources are divided over who was responsible for the defeat, some retrospectively blaming Alderson as the senior commander. The Dictionary of Canadian Biography indicates that Turner and Ketchen were to blame, a stance seemingly corroborated by the actions of Plumer. General Sir Herbert Plumer, the commander of the Second Army who wasresponsible for the front, demanded Ketchen's immediate dismissal. When Turner claimed that if Ketchen was dismissed he would resign, the commander of the Canadian Corps, Lieutenant- General Alderson, sought Turner's dismissal as well. Both officers were supporters of Militia Minister Sir Sam Hughes, who made it clear in no uncertain terms to Commander in Chief, Sir Douglas Haig, that if Turner went then Haig could no longer rely on Canadian support. This led to the diplomatic compromise of Alderson being relieved of his command and replaced by Julian Byng, while Turner and Ketchen retained their commands.Alderson, Sir Edwin Alfred Hervey, Dictionary of Canadian Biography article by Desmond Morton, Retrieved 5 November 2007 Ketchen reached the rank of Major-General in the Canadian Army and retired on pension in 1929. From 1920 to 1923, he served as president of the Canadian Legion in Manitoba and was also president of the South Winnipeg Conservative Association. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1932 provincial election for the constituency of Winnipeg, which elected ten members by a single transferable ballot. Ketchen finished seventh on the first ballot, and was declared elected. Running for re-election in the 1936 election, he finished eighth on the first ballot and was declared elected on the sixteenth count. The Conservative Party was the primary opposition party in Manitoba during this period, and Ketchen sat with his party caucus on the opposition benches. In 1940, the Conservative Party joined with the Liberal-Progressive Party and other parties in a coalition government. Ketchen initially sat as a government backbencher, but soon became disillusioned with the coalition arrangement. In the 1941 provincial election, he ran as a dissident Conservative opposing the coalition. He finished sixth on the first count, and was again declared elected on the sixteenth. The coalition supporters won 50 of 55 seats in the legislature in the 1941 election. Ketchen appears to have served as Leader of the Opposition in the legislature from 1941 to 1943. The Conservative Party remained a part of the coalition throughout the 1940s. Ketchen did not run for re-election in 1945. He died in hospital in Winnipeg at the age of 87. He married, in 1905, Margaret Elizabeth Robinson.

Booth owned eight newspapers in the state of Michigan. Founded by George Gough Booth with his two brothers, Booth Newspapers was sold to Advance Publications (a Samuel I. Newhouse property), which purchased it in 1976 for $305 million, a record at the time. Booth Newspapers owned The Ann Arbor News which ceased printing in July 2009 and was re-established as AnnArbor.com with a Thursday and Sunday newspaper and website independent of the other Booth properties. In 2013 AnnArbor.com joined MLive Media Group, which was established in 2012 as the Michigan brand for Advance Publications. At that time, AnnArbor.com's web presence was integrated with the other Michigan properties under the MLive.com URL and the AnnArbor.com newspaper returned to its historical identity as The Ann Arbor News. Other MLive Media Group newspaper publications include The Bay City Times, The Flint Journal, The Grand Rapids Press, Jackson Citizen Patriot, Kalamazoo Gazette, Muskegon Chronicle, The Saginaw News, and Advance Newspapers. The company also maintains newsrooms in Lansing and Detroit. All of Advance Publications' Michigan content is published on Mlive.com. History Booth Newspapers was founded by George Gough Booth and his brothers in 1893. In 1976, Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr. of Advance Publications acquired Booth Newspapers for $305 million. The Herald Company, Inc. merged with Booth Newspapers, Inc. in July 1987. In September 2002, Booth Newspapers acquired 21st Century Newspapers, Inc.'s Heritage Newspapers' Suburban Flint Newspaper Group which has nine local papers: Clio Messenger, Davison Flagstaff, Fenton Press, Grand Blanc News, Flint Township News, Flushing Observer, Holly Press, Suburban Burton, and Swartz Creek News, and included Suburban Flint Shopper. All of these operate with The Flint Journal as the Community Newspapers. In December 2006, the Herald Company, Inc. merged with Advance Magazine Publisher, Inc. but continues to operate under the Booth Newspapers name in Michigan. On November 3, 2008, the day before the 2008 presidential election, many copies of Booth newspapers were delivered inside a white advertising wrapper, paid for by the National Rifle Association, with \\"Defend Freedom, Defeat Obama\\" written across the outside. The bags were mostly reported with The Flint Journal, but there were also similar reports from customers of The Saginaw News and The Bay City Times. The Flint Journal posted a short apology on its website that stated that \\"The wrapper was supposed to be inserted into the newspaper.\\" The Journal also told WJRT-TV, who also received a flood of calls about the incident, that there was \\"some miscommunication\\" with the paper carriers. The three papers mentioned endorsed Barack Obama for president. On March 23, 2009, Booth Newspapers announced in The Ann Arbor News that it would end the paper's 174-year print run in July 2009, due to economic difficulties, and be replaced by AnnArbor.com, a daily web paper that will have a twice-weekly print edition. Also on this date, Booth announced that beginning June 1, 2009, The Bay City Times, The Saginaw News, and The Flint Journal would reduce publishing to three times a week (Thursday, Friday, and Sunday) while increasing their web presence; the three newspapers would add a Tuesday edition in March 2010, with The Bay City Times and The Saginaw News sharing an edition. On February 2, 2012, Booth Newspapers split into two companies: MLive Media Group and Advance Central Services Michigan. MLive Group handles advertising and news for all newspapers and websites. Advance Central Services handles human resources, production, and distribution. At the same time, home delivery of Booth's remaining daily newspapers was reduced to Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays with subscribers receiving e-editions on the other days on which they print. Also in 2012, Mlive contracted with former WEYI-TV meteorologist Mark Torregrossa to run the website's weather section with the expectation of increasing the section's views from 900,000 to 1 million. Instead by 2014, the section received on average 5 million to 6 million page views with a high in January 2014 of 13 million.

It is thought to have last erupted in the 1860s. Its name is derived from the Maasai word Oloonong'ot, meaning \\"mountains of many spurs\\" or \\"steep ridges\\". Mount Longonot is protected by Kenya Wildlife Service as part of Mount Longonot National Park. A 3.1 km trail runs from the park entrance up to the crater rim, and continues in a 7.2 km loop encircling the crater. The whole tour (gate-around the rim-gate) of 13.5 km takes about 4‚Äì5 hours allowing for necessary rest breaks - parts of the trail are heavily eroded and very steep. The gate elevation is around 2150 m and the peak at 2780 m but following the jagged rim involves substantially more than the 630 m vertical difference. Flora and fauna A forest of small trees covers the crater floor, and small steam vents are found spaced around the walls of the crater. The mountain is home to various species of wildlife, notably plains zebra, giraffe, Thomson's gazelle, buffaloes and hartebeest. Mount Longonot is 60 kilometres northwest of Nairobi and may be reached from there by a tarmac road. A nearby town is also named Longonot. The Longonot satellite earth station is located south of the mountain. Geology Longonot is a stratovolcano which contains a large 8 x 12 km caldera formed by vast eruptions of trachytic lava some 21,000 years ago. The current summit cone was developed within the earlier caldera. This cone itself is capped by a 1.8 km crater. The Mountain has several parasitic cones and effusive lava eruptions occur on the flanks and within the caldera floor. Periodic geodetic activity recorded at Longonot in 2004‚Äì2006 demonstrated the presence of active magmatic systems beneath this volcano. , geothermal projects struggle to explore the potential.

He and Suzanne have eight sons, who perform as the Osmond Brothers Second Generation: Michael Alan (1975); Nathan George (1977); Douglas Kenneth (1978); David Levi (1979); Scott Merrill (1981); Jonathon Pinegar (1983); Alexander Thomas (1988); and Tyler James (1990). Alan, like all the Osmonds, is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; seven of his sons have served LDS missions, while the youngest son Tyler did not serve. In 1987, Osmond was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a demyelinating disease which damages the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. His son, David Osmond, lead singer of the group Osmonds 2nd Generation, who was also diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2005, participated in the eighth season of American Idol on January 28, 2009 with a pass to Hollywood.For Some, American Idol is a Second Chance at Fame, Yahoo News, February 4, 2009 However, due to laryngitis, he was not able to make it past Hollywood week.

SCR operates from the international coaling piers on Sydney Harbour in Sydney to the Lingan Generating Station, a coal-fired electrical generating station near New Waterford. The railway's trackage, the piers, and the generating station are owned by Nova Scotia Power, a subsidiary of Emera Inc. History The railway line was completed in 1895 by the Dominion Coal Company (DOMCO) between Sydney and Louisbourg. The trackage was organized as the Sydney and Louisburg Railway (S&L;) in 1910. The S&L;, along with other assets of the corporate successor to DOMCO, Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (DOSCO), were expropriated by the Cape Breton Development Corporation (DEVCO) on March 30, 1968. DEVCO operated the railway as an unincorporated department of its Coal Division, however it was informally known as the Devco Railway. DEVCO built a coal preparation and coal wash plant and storage facility, along with new locomotive shops at Victoria Junction, a location midway between Sydney and the Lingan Generating Station near New Waterford. On November 23, 2001, DEVCO closed its last underground coal mine, the Prince colliery, after the company failed to entice any private sector investors to purchase the mine. DEVCO was out of the coal mining business, however for a period of approximately 1 month, it was in the coal importation business, with trains operating from the international coaling piers to the storage facility and on to the Lingan Generating Station. SCR Coal Train leaving the Lingan Generating Station The federal government moved swiftly to sell off assets, transferring the mine properties and mineral rights back to the provincial Department of Natural Resources. DEVCO subsequently decommissioned the Victoria Junction coal wash plant and began to immediately prepare remediation of the mine sites. On December 18, 2001 DEVCO sold all surface assets, including the international shipping piers, railway track, railway rights-of-way, locomotives and rolling stock, and a coal storage facility and locomotive shops at Victoria Junction to 510845 New Brunswick Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary of Emera, the holding company which owns Nova Scotia Power and operator of the Lingan Generating Station. Emera subsequently contracted the operation of its newly acquired DEVCO surface assets to Logistec Corporation. Logistec sub-contracted operation of the railway to the Soci√©t√© des chemins de fer du Qu√©bec (Quebec Railway Corporation), a Quebec-based railway holding company and short-line operating company. The new railway was called Sydney Coal Railway, although ownership of the track and other assets remains with Emera's subsidiary, 510845 New Brunswick Inc. Despite SCR having been created by SCFQ as an operating company in December 2001, the railway itself was actually legally chartered to 510845 N.B. Inc. until January 1, 2003, when the Sydney Coal Railway was formally recognized by the federal government. On 3 November 2008 Logistec announced that it was purchasing the SCR from Quebec Railway Corporation. Current operations Current SCR operations consist of running coal imports which arrive at the international coaling piers on Sydney Harbour by bulk carrier from the United States and South America. Coal is unloaded from ships and stored at the pier, and is then loaded onto trains and delivered directly to the Lingan Generating Station. Typical trains consist of a pair of ex-DEVCO GMD GP38-2 locomotives and 21 ex-DEVCO Ortner 5 bay rapid discharge hopper cars. The shop facility at Victoria Junction is still in use, but the wash plant and storage facilities are no longer used. SCR also maintains an interchange connection with the North American railway network at Sydney where it connects to the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway, with the latter operator possessing a connection with Canadian National at Truro; however, this connection is currently threatened as CBNS has discontinued service on the line from Sydney to St. Peter's Junction (near Port Hawkesbury), and will apply to abandon the line April 1, 2016.

Fisher has served as the head coach at the University of Michigan, where he won the national championship in 1989, and was an assistant at Michigan, Western Michigan University, and the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association. From 1999 to 2017, Fisher was head coach at San Diego State. Fisher attended Illinois State University, where he helped lead the Redbirds to the Final Four of the 1967 NCAA College Division Basketball Tournament. University of Michigan Fisher moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1982 and took an assistant coaching job at the University of Michigan after serving as an assistant coach at Western Michigan University since 1979. In 1989, during the final week of the regular season, Michigan head coach Bill Frieder agreed to take the coaching job at Arizona State University beginning the next season. Frieder intended to coach Michigan through the end of the 1989 NCAA tournament. However, when he told athletic director Bo Schembechler of his intentions, Schembechler ordered Frieder to leave immediately and named Fisher as interim head coach. When announcing the promotion of Fisher, Schembechler famously said, \\"I don't want someone from Arizona State coaching the Michigan team. A Michigan man is going to coach Michigan.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/16/sports/frieder-is-dropped-for- taking-a-new-job.html Initially, Fisher was not expected to retain the position after the season. However, Fisher led the Wolverines to an improbable NCAA championship that season, thanks to a strong performance by forward Glen Rice. Schembechler hired him as the school's permanent head coach a week after the championship game. Michigan credits the 1988‚Äì89 regular season to Frieder and the NCAA tournament to Fisher. Because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the timing of Fisher's hiring, he is the only person to win the NCAA Men's Division I national championship without having ever experienced a loss as the team's head coach. The next two seasons of the Fisher era were struggles. However, in 1991, Fisher signed one of the most talented incoming freshman classes of all time. High school stars Chris Webber, Jalen Rose, Ray Jackson, Jimmy King, and Juwan Howard all signed with Fisher and Michigan, forming what became known as the \\"Fab Five\\". Together, they helped lead the Wolverines to the national title game in their freshman year, only to lose to Duke. As sophomores, they again reached the title game, this time losing to North Carolina. In that game, Webber was called for a technical foul with 11 seconds remaining in the game when he signaled for a timeout when the Wolverines had none left. After the title-game loss to the Tar Heels, Webber went pro; Rose and Howard followed after an elite eight loss to the eventual National Champion Arkansas Razorbacks. The Wolverines would not reach the same heights until 2013, although they reached the postseason each of the next five seasons and won the 1997 National Invitation Tournament. In October 1997, Michigan fired Fisher as a result of an off-court scandal (see section below). Fisher was out of coaching for the 1997‚Äì98 season before taking a job as an assistant with the Sacramento Kings. In 1999, Fisher took over as coach of a San Diego State program that had suffered losing records in 13 of the previous 14 years. In the season before he arrived, the Aztecs had won just four games, but within two seasons Fisher had brought the team up to a .500 record, and led them to a 21‚Äì12 record and an NCAA Tournament appearance in year three of his regime. He has since led them to seven other NCAA tourneys, and five appearances in the National Invitation Tournament. Ed Martin scandal In 1997, after it was revealed that Maurice Taylor had visited Ed Martin, a retired Ford electrician, the school launched an investigation. After the investigators questioned Fisher's role in arranging complimentary tickets for Martin, Fisher was fired a week before practice began for the 1997‚Äì98 season. Later, additional facts surfaced that further damaged the program's reputation. In 2002, an indictment unsealed in a Detroit federal court charged Ed Martin with running an illegal gambling operation and money laundering. Additionally, it claimed that Martin gave Webber $280,000 in illicit loans while Webber was in high school and college, with another $336,000 allegedly going to three other former Wolverine players ‚Äì Taylor, Robert Traylor and Louis Bullock. Martin ultimately pleaded guilty, but died in February 2003. As a result of the revelations, Michigan imposed its own sanctions on the basketball program in 2002, vacating its two Final Four games from the 1992 NCAA Tournament and its standing as the tournament's runner-up. It also vacated the entire 1992‚Äì93 season, as well as every game from 1995‚Äì96 to 1998‚Äì99. Michigan also withdrew from postseason consideration for the 2002‚Äì03 season, and removed the banners hanging in Crisler Arena that commemorated their post-season appearances and removed references to the named players' records. The move came because the payments may have compromised the four players' amateur status. The NCAA accepted Michigan's sanctions, and additionally placed the school on probation until 2006. It also ordered Michigan to disassociate itself from the four players until 2013. The discoveries did not impact Fisher's career with San Diego State (and no new allegations have occurred in conjunction with that program). Fisher denied any knowledge of the Martin misconduct. The NCAA ultimately faulted Fisher for allowing Martin access to his players (though his ties to Michigan dated to the Frieder era), but otherwise cleared him of wrongdoing. San Diego State In 1999, Fisher took over the basketball program at San Diego State University. The Aztecs had not been to the postseason since their NCAA appearance in 1984‚Äì1985. In his third year, Fisher led the Aztecs to their first Mountain West Conference tournament title, and finished with a 21‚Äì12 record and continued the upward surge of the program. They returned to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since that same '84‚Äì85 team. During the 2002‚Äì2003 season (his fourth year), Steve Fisher's Aztecs returned to the post-season when they hosted an NIT First round match against UCSB. The Aztecs earned their first ever Division 1 post-season win. After two rebuilding seasons (2003‚Äì2004 and 2004‚Äì2005), the Aztecs returned to the NCAA Tournament in the 2005‚Äì2006 season; Steve Fisher's seventh season. That year the Aztecs began a present 10-year streak of consecutive 20+ win seasons while capturing their first ever Mountain West Conference Regular Season Championship, and winning their second ever Mountain West Conference Tournament Championship. In 2009, the Aztecs earned a school-record 26 victories and reached the semifinals of the NIT. It was their third consecutive trip to the NIT, and fourth consecutive post-season appearance. In the 2009‚Äì2010 season, the Aztecs won another 20+ games, won the Mountain West Conference Tournament, and earned their third NCAA Tournament trip under Fisher. In 2010‚Äì2011, the Aztecs, ranked #25 in the pre-season AP poll and were ranked #4 late in the season, the highest ranking in school history. SDSU even received three first place votes in the Coaches' Poll at one point. They spent nearly the entire season in the top 10 and won their first NCAA Tournament game ever en route to the Sweet 16. SDSU set a school record in the 2010‚Äì11 season with 34 wins. They had 3 total losses, the first 2 against Sweet 16 team BYU (who they went on to beat in MWC Tournament Championship game) and their 3rd loss was to future NCAA Tournament winner UConn. Overall Fisher has guided SDSU to the NCAA Tournament in 2002, 2006, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 and the postseason NIT in 2003, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2016 to go along with twelve 20-win seasons (eleven consecutive from 2005‚Äìpresent). Additionally, under Fisher, the Aztecs have won or shared six MWC regular season titles (2006 outright, 2011 shared with BYU, 2012 shared with New Mexico, 2014 outright, 2015 shared with Boise State, 2016 outright), and won four MWC tournaments (2002, 2006, 2010, 2011). Since the 2005‚Äì2006 season, Steve Fisher has led the Aztecs to eleven consecutive post-season appearances, including six consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances‚Äîthe first time the Aztecs have done this as a Division I team.

It is the fifth and final Bloody Roar game as well as the second game in the series to appear on the PlayStation 2 and the only game in the series to have received an M rating by ESRB due to the blood effects. Gameplay Like the previous games in the series, characters can transform into beasts during battle, using the beast gauge, slightly increasing their power. Unlike the other games, however, the beast gauge acts as its own separate health meter. Plot After the events of Bloody Roar 3, Xion, who is possessed by the Unborn, an evil spirit, attacks the dragon temple, awakening the dragon. The dragon is a weapon of Gaia, the Earth's will, and is supposed to awaken in the presence of evil. However, if freed too long, it can inadvertently destroy the world itself. The dragon is successfully resealed by the temple's head miko at the cost of her life, leaving the late miko's sister, Mana, to watch over the seal in Ryoho, the temple's priest and the vessel of the dragon. Other than attacking the temple, Xion also stabs a woman named Nagi, imbuing her with his power as well as that of Gaia's, making her both his lifesaver and enemy. A year later, the dragon is about to break free again, causing disturbances among the zoanthropes triggering earthquakes. Each of the zoanthropes investigate and eventually find the source in the dragon temple. In some cases, Ryoho and Mana invite them to help strengthen the seal, while others come on their own accord. In most of the characters' endings, Mana manages to seal the dragon and Ryoho comes out alive. In Nagi's ending, in addition to sealing the dragon and saving Ryoho, she kills Xion and the Unborn. In Xion's ending, the Unborn is killed, but not before murdering Ryoho and the dragon. In Reiji's ending, the confrontation at the temple ends with him murdering Ryoho and the dragon. Characters The game features eighteen playable characters. Four are new additions: * Nagi Kirishima, the Spurious: A human who becomes entangled with the zoanthrope conflict when Xion stabbed her during his rampage on the dragon temple. The incident not only bequeathed her with Xion's essence, thus branding her his clone, but also the power of Gaia, the Earth's will who opposes Xion. * Reiji, the Crow: A former member of the Yatagarasu, a clan protecting the dragon temple. He went fugitive after killing his father and became a hedonist who messes around zoanthropes for fun. * Ryoho and Mana: Two guardians of the dragon temple. Ryoho is a priest who is secretly a vessel for Gaia's dragon, whereas Mana is a young nine- tailed fox tasked to keep the dragon's seal. In gameplay, the two work in tandem, with Mana serving as the zoanthrope transformation. * Ryoho, the Dragon: The character is Ryoho after he is possessed by the dragon. He is no longer accompanied by Mana and instead has his own zoanthrope transformation. The other fourteen return from previous games: * Yugo Ogami, the Wolf. * Alice Tsukagami, the Rabbit. * Alan Gado, the Lion. * Long, the Tiger. * Uriko Nonomura, the Cat. * Bakuryu, the Mole. * Stun, the Insect. * Shina, the Leopard. * Jenny Burtory, the Bat. * Hajime Busuzima, the Chameleon. * Shenlong, the Tiger. * Xion, the Unborn. * Kohryu, the Iron Mole. * Uranus, the Chimera.

He was a member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1929 to 1931, representing the electorate of Martin for the Australian Labor Party (1929‚Äì1931) and the splinter Lang Labor party (1931). Eldridge was born in Kolkata, India. He educated at the Cootamundra, Marrickville and Fort Street schools in New South Wales and studied economics at the University of Sydney and social sciences and administration at the University of London. He became a public servant, and was assistant superintendent of the State Labour Bureau for many years; he also served as secretary of the British Empire League in Australia. Eldridge enlisted for service in World War I as a gunner in 1916, but was not deployed overseas until June 1918. Among his later public service roles was Executive Secretary of the New South Wales Commission for the British Empire Exhibition and Secretary of the New South Wales Commission for the New Zealand Exhibition; during the mid-1920s, he was an officer with the state Department of Labour and Industry. He founded the Social Science Service of Australia, was president of the New South Wales Pedestrians Association and patron of the League of New South Wales Wheelmen, and was a member of the Returned Soldiers' Association. An active member of the Labor Party, Eldridge wrote articles for Labor journals across a range of subjects, was an unsuccessful candidate for the Senate at the 1925 federal election and directed the party's radio campaign at the 1929 election. He was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1929 federal election, when he unexpectedly won the seat of Martin amidst Labor's large victory that year. Eldridge was a prominent supporter of Premier of New South Wales Jack Lang and his \\"Lang Plan\\" for responding to the Great Depression, and was heavily involved in the bitter divisions leading to the Lang section of the 1931 Labor split. As the split progressed, he was seen as the Lang Labor federal deputy leader under Jack Beasley. Given that Martin was thought to be unwinnable for a second term, Eldridge sought to contest Barton, held by official Labor incumbent James Tully at the forthcoming federal election. On 25 November 1931, Eldridge moved for the vote that, when Eldridge and his Lang colleagues voted with the opposition, brought down the Scullin Labor government. Both Eldridge and Tully lost to a United Australia Party candidate at the resulting 1931 election. He was a Commonwealth Arbitration Inspector from August 1940. Eldridge also made a series of unsuccessful attempts to re-enter politics over many years: he contested the state seat of Croydon at the 1932 state election for Lang's State Labor Party, recontested Barton for Lang Labor in 1934, and following Lang Labor's collapse unsuccessfully sought Labor preselection in his old seat of Martin in 1942 and for the Senate in 1945. He died in 1954 at his daughter's residence in Rockdale, aged 82.

She is notable for having been the wife of three of Muhammad's close companions. = First husband = Her first husband was Ja'far ibn Abu Talib from the Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe. In 616 she emigrated with him to Abyssinia, where she gave birth to three sons, Abdullah, Muhammad and Awn.

Ja'far fought at the Battle of Mu'tah against Byzantium in September 629 and, along with Zayd ibn Harithah and \`Abd Allah ibn Rawahah, was killed there. Asma narrated how she heard the news of her husband's death. \\"The Prophet came to me. I had prepared forty mann of 'dip' [tanned forty skins] and kneaded the dough. I took my two sons and I washed their faces and put oil on them. The Messenger of God came to me and said, 'O Asma, where are the sons of Ja'far?' I brought them to him and he embraced them and smelt them, then his eyes welled up and he cried. I said, 'Why, Messenger of God, perhaps [you have news] about Ja'far.' He replied, 'Yes, he was killed today.' I stood up and screamed, and the women came to me. The Prophet began to say, 'O Asma, do not speak obscene words or beat your chest!'\\" Her son Abdullah remembered: \\"He said, 'O Asma, will you not rejoice? Indeed, God most high has made two wings for Ja'far, that he may fly with them in Paradise!'\\" Then Muhammad told his daughter Fatimah, \\"Prepare food for the family of Ja'far, for they are preoccupied today.\\" = Second husband = After Ja'far's death Asma married Abu Bakr. She gave birth to his son Muhammad in 632 at al-Baydaa while on the way to The Farewell Pilgrimage. Abu Bakr planned to send Asma and their child back to Medina, but Muhammad told him to let her make the major ablution and then rededicate herself in offering the pilgrimage. The dying Abu Bakr left instructions that Asma should wash his corpse and that she should not fast on that day. She only remembered this instruction towards sunset, when she called for water to drink so that she would not have technically disobeyed him. As it was a very cold day, it was agreed that she did not have to perform an ablution after washing the body. = Third husband = When Abu Bakr died, Umar allotted Asma a pension of 1,000 dirhams. Soon afterwards, however, she married Ali, the brother of her first husband Ja'far, who brought up Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr as his own son. Asma bore Yahya and Awn to Ali.Muhammad ibn Saad. Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir vol. 3. Translated by Bewley, A. (2013). The Companions of Badr. London: Ta-Ha Publishers. One tradition tells of a squabble that broke out between Muhammad ibn Ja'far and Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, each of them boasting that his own father had been better. Ali told Asma to settle the quarrel. She told the boys: \\"Ja'far was the best young Arab, and Abu Bakr was the best old Arab.\\" Ali said: \\"That's a good answer. But you haven't said anything about me!\\" Asma replied, \\"Of the three, you are the most to choose.

This is a historical problem that has not yet been solved despite the various attempts made by Majlisi in Bihar al-Anwar vol. 10. It is also narrated that she was present during the marriage of Aisha. One theory states that Asma Bint Umais had actually immigrated with her husband to Abyssinia, but repeatedly returned to Mecca and Medina. The distance between Jeddah and Abyssinia is limited to that of the width of the Red Sea, which is not very difficult for a journey.

Scan of the birth certificate, Public Record Office Frith was born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, attending Quaker schools at Ackworth and Quaker Camp Hill in Birmingham (ca. 1828‚Äì1838), before he started in the cutlery business. He suffered a nervous breakdown in 1843, recuperating over the next two years. In 1850 he started a photographic studio in Liverpool, known as Frith & Hayward. A successful grocer, and later, printer, Frith fostered an interest in photography, becoming a founding member of the Liverpool Photographic Society in 1853.The current organisation called \\"Liverpool Photographic Society\\" claims to have been founded in 1952. The South Liverpool Photographic Society . Accessed 15 June 2008. Frith sold his companies in 1855 in order to dedicate himself entirely to photography. He journeyed to the Middle East on three occasions, the first of which was a trip to Egypt in 1856 with very large cameras (16\\" x 20\\"). He used the collodion process, a major technical achievement in hot and dusty conditions. Early life Francis Frith Jr was born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, the second child and only son of Francis Frith Sr and his wife Alice, n√©e Walker. He was born into a merchant Quaker family. He was originally apprenticed in the cutlery trade, but eventually became a grocer, supplying ships at Liverpool. He appears to have learned photography sometime in the 1850s, and in 1859 was one of the founding members of the Liverpool Photographic Society.

Hannavy, J., Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography, Routledge, 2012, p. 1031 During his travels he noted that tourists were the main consumers of the views of Italy, but armchair travellers bought scenes from other parts of the world in the hope of obtaining a true record, \\"far beyond anything that is in the power of the most accomplished artist to transfer to his canvas.\\" These words express the ambitious goal that Frith set for himself when he departed on his first trip to the Nile Valley in 1856 with his inventive friend Francis H. Wenham, who acted as lighting technician. He also made two other trips before 1860, extending his photo-taking to Palestine and Syria.Hannavy, J., Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography, Routledge, 2012, p. 1031 In addition to photography, he also kept a journal during his travels elaborating on the difficulties of the trip, commenting on the \\"smothering little tent\\" and the collodion fizzing - boiling up over the glass. Frith also noticed the compositional problems regarding the point of view from the camera. According to Frith, \\"the difficulty of getting a view satisfactorily in the camera: foregrounds are especially perverse; distance too near or too far; the falling away of the ground; the intervention of some brick wall or other common object... Oh what pictures we would make if we could command our point of views.\\" An image he took known as the \\"Approach to Philae\\" is just one example which elaborates his ability to find refreshing photographic solutions to these problems. (cited from \\"A World History of Photography\\") When not taking photographs in the Middle East, he was back in England, printing them and reproducing them in delightful illustrated books - including his Egypt and Palestine photographed described by Francis Frithm 1858-60 and Egypt, Palestine and Sinai (1860) with text by Mrs Sophia Poole and Reginald Stuart Poole - both of which became very popular.Williams, C., \\"The Visual Image of Nineteenth Century Cairo,\\" in Abdullah, T., Serag, M., Jones, M., Sakk≈´t, H. and O'Kane, B.

In 1860, he married Mary Ann Rosling (sister of Alfred Rosling, the first treasurer of the Photographic Society) and embarked upon a colossal project‚Äîto photograph every town and village in the United Kingdom; in particular, notable historical or interesting sights. Initially he took the photographs himself, but as success came, he hired people to help him and set about establishing his postcard company, a firm that became one of the largest photographic studios in the world. Within a few years, over two thousand shops throughout the United Kingdom were selling his postcards. Work Many of his photographs were collected into published volumes. Initially these works were compiled by established publishing companies. However, by the 1860s, Firth realised that he could profit from publishing his own images and established the publishing company F. Frith & Co.

He served on numerous committees, and frequently spoke in favour of pacifism and abstinence. He was an occasional contributor of philosophical and religious articles and poems to the Quaker journal, the Friends' Quarterly Examiner.FQE was published 1867 to 1946 under that title and from 1946 as Friends Quarterly. In his sixties, Frith positioned himself at the extreme liberal wing of society. In 1884, he published (with William Pollard and William Turner) A Reasonable Faith, a highly controversial pamphlet which challenged evangelical orthodoxy by questioning the factuality of the Bible. Although the liberal views expressed in A Reasonable Faith were quickly and vociferously attacked by leading evangelical Quakers, liberal theology rapidly gained support and within ten years became the majority view. Thus it was Francis Frith and his co-authors who began the liberalisation of the Quaker movement and paved the way for the philanthropic and educational reforms for which the movement is well known today. Personal life Frith married Mary Ann Rosling, and they had five children: Mary Alice, Eustace, Francis Edgar, Mabel and Cyril. Death Frith died at his villa in Cannes, France, on 25 February 1898, aged 75.  Francis Frith & Co. continues His family continued the firm, which was finally closed in 1971. Following closure of the business, Bill Jay, one of Britain's first photography historians, identified the archive as being nationally important, and \\"at risk\\". Jay managed to persuade McCann-Erikson the London advertising agency to approach their client Rothmans of Pall Mall on 14 December 1971 to purchase the archive to ensure its safety. Rothmans went ahead and acquired the archive within weeks. Frith was re- launched in 1975 as \\"The Francis Frith Collection\\" by John Buck, a Rothmans executive, with the intention of making the Frith photographs available to as wide an audience as possible.Frith company records. On 25 August 1977, Buck bought the archive from Rothmans, and has run it as an independent business since that time ‚Äì trading as The Francis Frith Collection. In 2016 the company completed a two-year project to scan the entire archive and now holds over 330,000 high resolution digital images. The company website enables visitors to browse all 330,000 Frith photographs, depicting some 7,000 cities, towns and villages.

Some sports and events have greater historical and cultural significance whilst others are played for entertainment or competition. British influence The football team of 95 Company, Royal Garrison Artillery, victors in the 1917 Governor's Cup football match, pose with the cup. The cup was contested for annually by teams from the various Royal Navy, British Army Bermuda Garrison, and Royal Air Force units stationed in Bermuda. HMS Caradoc football team on Moresby Plain at the Royal Naval Dockyard, circa 1928 Many sports popular today were formalised by British public schools and universities in the Nineteenth Century. These schools produced the civil servants and military and naval officers required to build and maintain the British empire, and team sports were a vital tool for training their students to think and act as part of a team. Former public schoolboys continued to pursue these activities, and founded organisations such as The Football Association (FA). Today's association of football with the working classes began when the FA changed its rules to allow professional players in 1885. They soon displaced the amateur ex-Public schoolboys. The armed forces encouraged competitive and team sports for all ranks for the same reasons public schools did. Bermuda's role as the primary Royal Navy base in the Western Hemisphere, with an army garrison to match, ensured that the naval and military personnel quickly introduced the newly formalised sports to Bermuda, including cricket, football, Rugby football, golf, and even tennis and rowing (rowing did not adapt well from British rivers to the stormy Atlantic, and the officers soon switched to sail racing, founding the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club). Once these sports reached Bermuda, they were eagerly adopted by Bermudians. In Bermuda, cricket and football (soccer) are the most popular sports. Cricket in particular now has a two-day (not including the weekend) holiday dedicated to it, called Cup Match. This tournament began in 1872 when Captain Moresby of the Royal Navy introduced the game to Bermuda, holding a match at Somerset to mark \\"forty years since the unjust thraldom of slavery\\". The East End versus West End rivalry resulted from the locations of the St. George's Garrison (the original army headquarters in Bermuda) on Barrack Hill, St. George's, and the Royal Naval Dockyard at Ireland Island. Moresby founded the Somerset Cricket Club which plays the St. George's Cricket Club in this game (the membership of both clubs has long been mostly civilian).Stranack The whole of Bermuda ground to a complete halt for two days every summer to turn its attention to this cricket game. Venues of the game change yearly between both clubs. The popularity of the annual game was such that it caused continued absences from employment. As a direct result, the 2-day public holiday was first introduced in 1947 and has been in effect ever since. The two days (currently called Emancipation Day and Somers Day) feature a single Cricket match between teams from both ends of the island, a match has been played for over a century. The Island's national Cricket team has also competed internationally. Football did not become popular with Bermudians 'til after the Second World War, though teams from the various Royal Navy, British Army Bermuda Garrison, and Royal Air Force units of Bermuda had competed annually for the Governor's Cup introduced by Major- General Sir George Mackworth Bullock in 1913. Although most of its members had never played football before joining the army, a combined team of the Bermuda Militia Artillery (BMA) and the Bermuda Militia Infantry (BMI) defeated to win the cup on 21 March, 1943, becoming the first team of a locally raised unit to do so, and the third British Army team to do so since 1926.Bermuda Militia Win Governor's Football Cup. The Recorder. Page 1. City of Hamilton, Bermuda. 24th of March, 1943. Golf Bermuda holds the most golf courses per square mile in the world. The golf courses on the island are quite distinct as they are generally short, and their turf hard and sandy. The wind is also higher as unblocked gusts from the sea-facing side of a course can sometimes affect the accuracy of a golf swing. Bermuda's hilly terrain is apparent at some of the island's golf courses. Bermuda holds number of golf tournaments and events annually held by the Bermuda Golf Association. One of the most popular annual tournaments is the Bermuda Open. Bermudian Quinn Talbot, who lost an arm in a motorcycle crash in 1969, was both the United States National Amputee Golf Champion for five successive years and the British World One-Arm Golf Champion.Ocean View Golf Course Staff Water sports Bermuda being an island with a history of sailing and a number of sailing clubs, it is no surprise that sailing has been historically a popular sport. Namely, dinghy racing is seen as the main competitive sport. Unsurprisingly, most Bermudians swim, and Bermudians compete in swimming competitions in the Caribbean. Bermudians also enjoy non-competitive sports like diving and fishing. In 2017, Bermuda hosted the America's Cup being the 35th staging of the America's Cup yacht race. The challenger, Emirates Team New Zealand, won by a score of 7 to 1 over the defender, Oracle Team USA. It was held on the Great Sound in Bermuda from June 17 to June 26. The sporting event brought a major increase in jobs and tourism to the island. Squash Squash has seen a surge in popularity since the squash world championships were held on the island in 2017. Additionally, junior squash has flourished on the island with many junior Bermudian squash players applying their trade overseas in top squash organisations. At the Caribbean Area Squash Championships, Bermuda tends to place well fending off countries such as Jamaica and Guyana that are many times the countries respective population size. Basketball In Bermuda, Basketball is played competitively nationally and internationally. At the Caribbean Basketball Championship Bermuda beat countries with many times its population size. The country has access to multiple basketball facilities. International sport Generally, Bermudians match poorly in international competition due to their small population size, and mostly compete in individual events in international competition Bermuda is often represented in the Olympic Games, though it has only won a single medal (in boxing). Bermuda also participates in the Americas' Cup Sailing Competitions with some success. Other Other popular sports include various equestrian forms including pony-cart racing and dressage, Futsal, rugby, squash and tennis. See rugby union in Bermuda. Motorsports are gaining in popularity, particularly after the construction of Bermuda Motorsports Park. Australian rules football is also gaining popularity and the island will host the Australian Rules Football Championships in April 2007, an international tournament featuring sides from Canada, the United States, Europe and the Bermuda Lions national team.Bermuda Australian Rules Football Association Bermuda welcomes footy with International Tournament on the Island from World Footy News Bermuda Fitted Dinghy racing ‚Äì in which a number of small punts outfitted with huge sails and a crew of six race each other and frequently sink ‚Äì has been declining in popularity over the years. Lacrosse grew in popularity on the island, but is now declining in popularity. In 2006 Bermuda was represented at the ILF world championships of lacrosse in Ontario, Canada. Bermuda is an affiliate nation of the International Lacrosse Federation. Competitive Netball has grown popular within schools.

It is part of Space Delta 6 and is located at Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado. Prior to July 2020 it was a United States Air Force unit of the 50th Network Operations Group, itself a part of the 50th Space Wing. Mission and operations The 22nd Space Operations Squadron (22nd SOPS) operates the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) by developing, executing and enforcing the Space Access Tasking Order (SpATO) and providing space safety analysis to conduct satellite operations. The 22nd SOPS coordinates the launch and on-orbit operations of more than 190 Department of Defense, national intelligence, civil and Allied nation's satellites, including in support of global warfighters, intelligence community users, the President and Secretary of Defense. The 22nd SOPS's Operations Center at Schreiver AFB, Colorado, develops, publishes and enforces the SpATO, and directs and monitors all aspects of enterprise operations for AFSCN users through a combination of military commanders, civilian professionals and contract support. The squadron's orbit analysts coordinate ephemeris data, launch and early orbit analysis determination, and tracking station look angles to support space operations for some 29 different space operations centers. The 22nd SOPS also provides a limited predictive and investigative radio frequency interference and collision avoidance capability to all AFSCN users. It also implements defensive counter-space actions to ensure continued \\"access to space\\" and protect the ability to create \\"space effects\\". The unit staffing consisted of officers, enlisted, DOD civilians and contractor personnel performing AFSCN operations and maintenance 24/7 around the global. History Constituted 22d Space Operations Squadron on 10 July 1991, it was activated on 1 Oct 1991. It operated as part of the 2d Satellite Tracking (later, 750th Space) Group. In 2004 it changed from being under the 50th Operations Group to the 50th Network Operations Group. As part of 22 SOPS, the Colorado Tracking Station enjoyed a unique status as the only on-base satellite tracking facility. Originally built in the late 1980s, the station underwent a number of upgrades. In 2004, the 50th Network Operations Group brought together all the 50th Space Wing's squadrons responsible for Air Force Satellite Control Network operations and maintenance as well as communications. In late 2006, the station is scheduled to receive a new equipment core, which will allow further automation of the satellite operations. The new core, part of the Remote Tracking Station Block Change includes computer processor upgrades, and new hardware/software to allow the tracking station equipment to better interface with the upgraded satellite operations centers. This system also involves a 13-meter diameter, 3-axis antenna. This new antenna adds the capability to track low earth orbiting satellites \\"over the top\\". The squadron operated several detachments at tracking stations around the globe, each forming part of the Air Force Satellite Control Network. * Detachment 1: Vandenberg Tracking Station (COOK), Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. * Detachment 2: Diego Garcia Tracking Station (REEF), Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory * Detachment 3: Thule Tracking Station (POGO), Thule Air Base, Greenland * Detachment 4: Hawaii Tracking Station (HULA), Kaena Point Satellite Tracking Station, Hawaii * Detachment 5: Guam Tracking Station (GUAM), Guam * OL-AE: Telemetry and Command Station (LION), RAF Oakhanger, United Kingdom *New Boston Tracking Station (BOSS) New Hampshire Beginning October 1, 2006, the Colorado Tracking Station began reduced operations, owing to \\"fiscal constraints\\".

It is a sequel to Fatal Fury: King of Fighters and the second game in the Fatal Fury franchise. Its updated version, Fatal Fury Special, was released in 1993.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot showcasing a match between Mai Shiranui and Big Bear in Australia. Fatal Fury 2 was the second game in SNK's 100-Mega Shock series, offering improved graphics and gameplay over the original Fatal Fury: King of Fighters. The play controls were modified, this time making full use of the Neo-Geo's four button configuration, by including four attack buttons (Light Punch, Light Kick, Strong Punch, and Strong Kick). The player can also dash back from the opponent to retreat by quickly tapping the lever backwards twice.Fatal Fury 2 user's manual (Neo Geo AES, US) The two-plane battle system from the first Fatal Fury has been retained. This time, the player can move freely to the adjacent plane by pressing the Light Punch and Light Kick buttons simultaneously for the \\"Plane Move\\". The player can also perform a \\"Power Attack\\" that will knock the opponent to the other plane. When the opponent is on the other plane, the player can press either a punch button to jump towards the opponent with a \\"Low Plane Move Attack\\" or either a kick button for a \\"High Plane Move Attack\\". Certain stages have hazards in the background plane, such as electrified wires or a stampede of bulls, and thus the player cannot change planes but can knock the opponent to the other plane to cause extra damage. Other specialized techniques have been added as well. After the player guards an opponent's attack, they can follow it up with a special counterattack technique known as an \\"Evasion Attack\\". The player can also taunt the opponent by pressing the Strong Punch button from a distance. Fatal Fury 2 also introduces the \\"Desperation Move\\" (or \\"Fury\\"), a powerful type of Special Move which causes massive damage that can only be used when the player's life gauge is at 25% and flashing red. The single-player mode has the player facing against all eight characters (including a clone of the player's character), followed by four non-playable boss characters. After every fourth match, the player will participate in a bonus round for more points. Plot After Geese Howard's death in the original Fatal Fury, a mysterious nobleman becomes the sponsor of the new \\"King of Fighters\\" tournament. This time, the tournament is held worldwide with fighters around the globe competing. As the single-player mode progresses, the mysterious challenger begins defeating the participants from the first Fatal Fury game, searching for the man responsible for defeating Geese. Fighters The character roster consists of eight selectable warriors: Terry, Andy and Joe from the original Fatal Fury, plus five new playable newcomers. After defeating all eight playable characters in the single player tournament (including a clone of the player's character), the player faces four non- playable bosses. Playable fighters: * Terry Bogard - an American street fighting champion from South Town. * Andy Bogard - Terry's younger brother and ninjutsu practitioner. * Joe Higashi - a Japanese Muay Thai champion. * Big Bear - an Australian wrestler formerly known as Raiden (from the first Fatal Fury). * Jubei Yamada - an elderly Japanese judo master once known as \\"Yamada the Demon\\" during his youth. * Cheng Sinzan - an obese master of taiji from Taiwan who is seeking to open his own training hall. * Kim Kaphwan - a taekwondo master from South Korea. * Mai Shiranui - a beautiful kunoichi who is the daughter of the Shiranui ninja clan's leader and Andy's love interest.

Release =Home versions= In addition to the Neo-Geo AES and Neo-Geo CD home versions, a port of Fatal Fury 2 was released for the Sharp X68000 in Japan in 1993, followed by versions for the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive, PC Engine CD, SNES and Game Boy in early 1994. The SNES and Genesis versions were published by Takara, while the X68000 version, released only in Japan, was published by Mahou Kabushikigaisha (Magical Company). All three versions allow the player to control the four boss characters via their own respective codes. The PC Engine version was published by Hudson Soft only in Japan and was one of the first games to require the Arcade Card add-on. To coincide with the Japanese release of the SNES version, Hori Electric released a special controller called the Fatal Fury 2 Commander which has the power and super power moves of all the game's playable characters programmed in so that they can be triggered with a single button. The original Neo Geo version of the game was later included in 2006's Fatal Fury: Battle Archive Volume 1 for the PlayStation 2 (with a choice between the original AES and CD soundtrack).

Fatal Fury 2 was generally very well received by Western game critics upon its release. GamePro review of the Neo Geo version praised the \\"action- packed\\" gameplay, \\"Street Fighter-tough\\" challenge, \\"great\\" character graphics and animation, \\"slick scrolling\\" backgrounds, and \\"fantastic\\" sound, concluding it to be an \\"awesome sequel\\" that \\"ranks up there with the Numero Uno fighting game.\\"GamePro, issue 44, March 1993, page 164. GamePro also praised the Genesis version for its six-button controller support and character graphics. They regarded the music as dull but assessed that the game \\"faithfully mimics the Neo Geo version and knocks Fatal Fury Genesis out of the ring.\\" Reviewing the Genesis version, Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) criticized the sound effects but gave the overall assessment that \\"all the fighters, all the stages, and extra options not in the arcade (like a speed setting) make this another fine conversion of a Neo Geo title.\\" Reviewing the SNES version of the game, EGM called it \\"one of the better fighting games ported to the SNES\\" and awarded it Game of the Month.Electronic Gaming Monthly, issue 58, May 1994, page 28 GamePro gave the SNES version a more mixed review, comparing it favorably with its predecessor, but stating that the graphics are inferior to the Neo Geo version, the audio is terrible, the controls are unreliable, and the gameplay is unbalanced. The magazine recommended that Fatal Fury fans instead hold out for the upcoming SNES port of Fatal Fury Special, which they felt to be far superior judging by the pre- release version they had seen. In a retrospective review, Maximum assessed that while still not as strong as Street Fighter II, Fatal Fury 2 was a dramatic improvement over the first game: \\"the number of characters selectable had been extended to eight, and all of them received a full complement of moves and fought with a much greater fluidity than in Fatal Fury.\\" They also noted better background graphics and greater interaction with the scenery. In 2011, Complex ranked Fatal Fury 2 as the 35th best fighting game of all time, largely for introducing Mai Shiranui.Peter Rubin, The 50 Best Fighting Games of All Time, Complex.com, 30 April 2014.

It is an updated version of 1992's Fatal Fury 2, introducing several changes to the gameplay system while expanding the available character roster.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot showcasing a match between Mai Shiranui and Andy Bogard in Italy. Fatal Fury Special is an updated version of Fatal Fury 2. It features many of the same graphics and gameplay, although some slight changes were made to the system, including faster game speed and an all new combo system. Unlike the previous Fatal Fury games, Special allows the player to combine their attacks. When an attack lands, the player will have a brief moment of invincibility. The number of Line Move Attacks have also increased; pressing the Light Punch or Light Kick button while the opponent is on an opposite line will perform a Low Line Jump Attack.Fatal Fury Special user's manual (Neo Geo AES, US) The single-player mode has the player fighting all of the playable characters, beginning with the eight regular characters from the previous game, as well as Tung and Duck, with the player given a choice in their first opponent. After the first ten opponents, the player will fight against Billy, Axel, Laurence, Geese, and Krauser, in that order. If the player wins every match in two rounds, then the player will be challenged by Ryo in a special \\"Dream Match\\". Characters The character roster of Fatal Fury 2 returns. The four AI-only characters from the previous game (Billy Kane, Axel Hawk, Laurence Blood, and Wolfgang Krauser) can now be controlled by the player, and three characters from the original Fatal Fury (Tung Fu Rue, Duck King, and Geese Howard) return, increasing the number of playable characters to fifteen. Ryo Sakazaki, the protagonist of Art of Fighting, appears as a hidden opponent at the end of the Single Player Mode and is playable in the home versions. Release =Home versions= In addition to the home versions for the Neo Geo and Neo Geo CD, ports of Fatal Fury Special were produced for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega CD and Game Gear, as well as the PC Engine game console (in Arcade CD-ROM¬≤ format), and the X68000 and FM Towns computer platforms in Japan between 1994‚Äì1996. The game is included in 2007's Fatal Fury: Battle Archives Volume 1 for the PlayStation 2. Fatal Fury Special for the Neo Geo was later released on the Virtual Console in 2010. An emulation of the Neo Geo arcade game was also released for the Xbox Live Arcade in 2007. Furthermore, mobile versions were released for Android and iOS based devices. It was later ported to Nintendo Switch in July 2017 by a Japanese game publisher HAMSTER. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Fatal Fury Special on their October 15, 1993 issue as being the most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Reviewing the Neo Geo version, GamePro praised the variety of characters, the addition of new moves for the older characters, the combos, the detailed graphics, and the humorous touches to the backgrounds, though they felt the ability to jump between the foreground and background tended to be an annoyance. All four reviewers for Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) referred to it as \\"one of the best tournament fighting games out there\\" (with insignificant changes in wording between each reviewer). They praised the new characters, the improved backgrounds and animations, and the music, and gave it a score of 34 out of 40 (average 8.5 out of 10). GamePro gave the Game Gear version a rave review, stating that though it has fewer characters and vastly inferior graphics and sounds compared to the Neo Geo version, it \\"is arguably the best handheld fighting game ever released\\" due to the responsive action and the inclusion of \\"extra elements you never thought you'd see in a handheld fighter\\". The magazine particularly applauded the presence of a combo system and the numerous special moves. On release, Famicom Ts≈´shin scored the Mega-CD version of the game a 21 out of 40.NEW GAMES CROSS REVIEW: È§ìÁãº‰ºùË™¨ SPECIAL. Weekly Famicom Ts≈´shin. No.329. Pg.32. 7 April 1995. GamePro declared it \\"yet another Neo Geo arcade game that's been poorly converted for a home system.\\" Although they complimented the inclusion of all the characters, moves, and music of the arcade version, they felt that the removal of key animation frames and distinctive background elements would make the conversion a major disappointment to anyone used to the arcade game. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly instead judged it to be an overall solid conversion, remarking that the sound effects are weak and garbled, but the music, play controls, and graphics all replicate the original with reasonable accuracy. They scored it 29.5 out of 40 (an average of 7.375 out of 10). All four reviewers of EGM complained of the severe echo effect in the audio of the SNES version, and two of them said that some of the moves are hard to pull off. However, they commented that the graphics, while a step down from the Neo Geo version, are still relatively sharp, and judged it an overall good conversion. They scored it 29.5 out of 40 (an average of 7.375 out of 10). GamePro was less pleased with the conversion, and remarked that the graphics and controls are vastly inferior to those of the Neo Geo version. They also criticized the special moves which are activated when a character is near death as a \\"cheesy way of evening things out between players of varying skill levels.\\" A reviewer for Next Generation also gave it a negative review, though almost solely for its perceived lack of originality, commenting that \\"sprite-based 2D fighting games are a dime a dozen, and in spite of the impressive Dolby Surround, all this one really has going it is sheer size: 15 characters ... and five special moves apiece, some of which are slick, but none of which you haven't pulled off it some other game of its ilk.\\" Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot gave the Xbox Live Arcade release a 6.5 out of 10. He remarked that the game is emulated well, and approved of the fact that it emulates the Neo Geo home version rather than the arcade version. He stated that the game itself is good compared to other Neo Geo fighters of its time, but would probably not appeal to modern players who are not already familiar with the Fatal Fury franchise. In a 1996 retrospective review, Maximum commented that Fatal Fury Special \\"tweaked the gameplay of Fatal Fury 2 overly very superficially, and the main selling point lay with the number of combatants.\\" However, they praised the more hectic pace of the game, and gave it 3 out of 5 stars.

She served as the president of the Iowa Equal Suffrage Association in 1913. She headed the Roadside Settlement House in Des Moines, Iowa. Dunlap was the first woman to ever serve on the Board of Education of Des Moines. She was a friend of Jane Addams and a supporter of the Women's Suffrage Movement. Early life and education Dunlap was born in 1872 to Mary and Samuel W. Dunlap. Growing up in Circleville, Ohio, she attended school in nearby Columbus. She graduated from Cincinnati Wesleyan College.  Settlement houses  Dunlap earned an apprenticeship at the Kingsley Settlement House a year later. Following the apprenticeship, Dunlap went on to live in the Goodrich House in Cleveland, as well as the Hull House in Chicago. Dunlap found the widespread fame of the Hull House to be ‚Äú‚Ä¶a stimulating, an absorbing, and a bewildering place in which to live and work.‚Äù However, she wished to work in a smaller city rather than staying in Chicago despite her love for Hull House. After Dunlap resigned her position at the Roadside Settlement House in September 1916, she headed the Neighborhood Guild House in Brooklyn, New York. Dunlap ultimately returned to the Roadside Settlement in 1918, where she maintained head resident until 1924. = Roadside Settlement = Jane Addams referred Dunlap to the Roadside Settlement in Des Moines, and Dunlap accepted the position of head resident in 1904. Dunlap had been offered to go to another house in the east, however Addams believed she would have more autonomy in the western area. The settlement was located in a commercial neighborhood, causing a decrease in clientele to serve. The settlement board voted to relocate the home to South Bottom near the Des Moines River. Dunlap oversaw the construction of this three-story brick building. The new home opened in 1906 and was regarded by Dunlap as one of her greatest achievements. As the Roadside house became open to the public, Dunlap established several programs including sewing and cooking classes, as well as manual training and literary clubs. Dunlap served as head resident of the Roadside Settlement House for two decades.  Elected office and activism  = Board of Education = In 1912 Dunlap ran for the Des Moines school board. Her community involvement earned Dunlap the support of local women‚Äôs clubs who endorsed her candidacy and distributed her campaign advertisements in various local establishments. Dunlap won the election as the first woman to ever serve on the board. After three years of serving, Dunlap reported it was ‚Äúthe most unpleasant and most futile task‚Äù she had managed. Dunlap concluded the board was not ready for women and neglected to run for re-election after complaining none of the other male members would speak or listen to her opinions. = Iowa Equal Suffrage Association = During this same time period, Dunlap served as legislative chair of the Iowa Federation of Women‚Äôs Clubs. In 1913 Dunlap won the presidency of the Iowa Equal Suffrage Association. She held office for this position until 1916. During her three years of presidency, Dunlap took to the streets and visited 30 towns to hold educational open-air meetings. In 1916 Dunlap led a campaign in which an amendment to the state constitution was submitted to voters to allow women the right to vote. In 1917 and 1918, Dunlap maintained the position of regional director of the girls division of the War Camp Community Service.

It was the first game in the Madden series with an official National Football League team license, as well as the first Madden game that allowed players to play a full regular season (via a password system). However, the game is not licensed by the NFL Players Association, so all of the players are identified by number only (the game would get the Players' Association license in next year's edition). It was the first Madden game to use the famous \\"EA Sports ‚Äì It's in the Game\\" audio tag. It also introduced the \\"Flip play\\", \\"Play-call mode\\", \\"Pass-catch mode\\" and \\"Bluff play\\" options to the series. This was the first Madden title to pause the action and rotate the screen during punts, kickoffs and turnovers, rather than instantly reversing P.O.V. to the opposite side of the field, which could be disorienting to players. The field could also be rotated to view plays from any angle in instant replay. This was also the first of the Madden games to have Super Bowl teams available for play without any special codes. Due to an error, the entire rosters for the New York Giants and New York Jets were reversed. For example, the quarterback for the Jets was #11 (Phil Simms of the Giants) while the quarterback for the Giants was #7 (Boomer Esiason of the Jets). This error affected at least the copies for SNES available during the Christmas shopping season of 1993. Certain versions of the game were labeled as \\"Limited First Round Editions\\".

Features The Genesis version of Madden NFL '95 was the first Madden game to have both the NFL team logo and NFLPA licenses, thus allowing players to be identified by their names in addition to their squad numbers for the first time. The game reflects all NFL rosters and attributes for the 1994 season. This version of Madden NFL was also the first Madden to showcase no passing windows, though passing windows can be retained using the options menu. Previously included \\"Past Championship Teams\\" and \\"All-Franchise\\" teams are not included. Player stats are tracked individually both in-game, and throughout a season. The cover has John Madden on it, but it also features two actual NFL players, Dallas Cowboys left tackle Erik Williams and San Francisco 49ers defensive lineman Karl Wilson who has his number edited to show the fictional number 70 which was not worn by anyone on the 49ers roster in the 1994 season. It was released on the Game Boy, Game Gear, Genesis and Super NES. The game features the theme song from the NFL on Fox, which John Madden joined on shortly before the game's release. Reception The two sports reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Super NES version scores of 85% and 90%, citing the improved animations and sounds from previous Madden games and the new rules and plays. GamePros Weekend Warrior gave the Super NES version a positive review, expressing approval for both the game's many new features (particularly the ability to substitute players in any position) and the retention of the same user- friendly mechanics as previous Madden games. Reviewing the Genesis version in GamePro, Athletic Supporter noted that \\"unlike its SNES counterpart, Madden '95 on the Genesis doesn't always generate high-scoring games.\\"[emphasis in original] Ben D. Rules, also of GamePro, commented that the Game Boy version, while having unavoidable portable limitations such as tiny, unrecognizable sprites and mediocre sound effects, has a surprisingly strong selection of teams and stats and well-designed gameplay. He concluded \\"While football on handhelds will probably never take off, this one's still a worthy effort.\\" Fellow GamePro reviewer Tommy Glide similarly praised the Game Gear version as a worthy handheld effort which retains most of the options, teams, and plays of the home versions. However, he concluded that despite being \\"the best football game available for the Game Gear\\", it is not a worthwhile purchase due to the tiny, squint-inducing graphics and lack of multiplayer. In 2012, Madden NFL '95 was listed on Time's All-TIME 100 greatest video games list.

The AI has been boosted and can now hurry in two-minute drill situations, spike the ball, and cover the receivers with better efficiency. It was the last to explicitly be endorsed by the NFL on Fox, although a knock-off/rendition of the NFL on Fox's iconic theme would continue to be used in Madden for several years afterward. Additions The Create A Player feature was added, which includes many position specific mini-games that determine the ability of the player. The game also was the first in the Madden series to include secret \\"classic\\" teams, which are unlocked by playing any of the 28 pre-expansion NFL franchises in the playoffs and by winning Super Bowl XXX with that team (a rather easy feat as the playoff tournament system allows a player to abort the game while in the lead and still win). The 28 pre-expansion teams are each represented by a classic era equivalent, which range from 1960 (Philadelphia Eagles) to 1986 (New York Giants), although all players on those classic era teams are identified by their squad numbers only. The Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Panthers, having debuted in 1995, do not have a secret classic team revealed in this manner, nor do the All-Madden team. However, Carolina is attached to the blank slate NFLPA team used for Create-A-Player, and Jacksonville and All-Madden hide the \\"superteams\\" with players named after the developers; these teams are accessed using unstated cheat codes. PlayStation version Madden '96, developed by Visual Concepts, was originally planned to be the first NFL game on the PlayStation shortly after the console's launch in 1995.

But after several delays, the game was canceled because it did not meet EA's quality assurance standards. Visual Concepts would later go on to make the NFL 2K series of games. Reception The two sports reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Genesis version scores of 9.5 and 9.0 out of 10, stating that \\"EA listened to players and has come up with the best 16-bit football game ever made.\\" They praised the \\"hard as hell\\" AI and the addition of speed bursts. A reviewer for Next Generation deemed it \\"a definite improvement from last year's poor effort\\", citing the more solid player graphics, faster play, and tougher AI. He further remarked that while Sega's Prime Time NFL was still the best football video game in single player, Madden NFL '96 was the best two-player experience. He gave it four out of five stars.

He judged the SNES version to be superior to the Genesis version due to its faster animation and inclusion of drills specific to each position, and called it \\"the top-ranked SNES football cart\\". GamePro panned the Game Boy version in a brief review, stating, \\"This Madden features no NFL license, old lineups, and none of the improvements made to the '96 SNES version.

The flora and fauna of Bermuda form part of a unique ecosystem due to Bermuda's isolation from the mainland of North America. The wide range of endemic species and the islands form a distinct ecoregion, the Bermuda subtropical conifer forests. Setting Located 900 km off the American East Coast, Bermuda is a crescent-shaped chain of 184 islands and islets that were once the rim of a volcano. The islands are slightly hilly rather than having steep cliffs, with the highest point being 79m. The coast has many bays and inlets, with sandy beaches especially on the south coasts. Bermuda has a semi-tropical climate, warmed by the Gulf Stream current. Bermuda is very densely populated. Twenty of the islands are inhabited. Wildlife that could fly to the island or were carried there by winds and currents formed the species. There are no native mammals other than bats, and only two reptiles, but large numbers of birds, plants, and insects. Once on the island, organisms had to adapt to local conditions, such as the humid climate, lack of fresh water, frequent storms, and salt spray. The area of the islands shrank as water levels rose at the end of the Pleistocene epoch, and fewer species were able to survive in the reduced land-area. Nearly 8,000 different species of flora and fauna are known from the islands of Bermuda. The number is likely to be considerably higher if all microorganisms, cave-dwellers and deep-sea species were counted. Today the variety of species on Bermuda has been greatly increased by introductions, both deliberate and accidental. Many of these introduced species have posed a threat to the native flora and fauna because of competition and interference with habitat. Plants Bermuda palmetto Oreodoxa oleracea in an 1895 photo Over 1000 species of vascular plant are found on the islands, the majority of which are introduced. Of the 165 native species, 17 are endemic. At the time of the first human settlement by shipwrecked English sailors in 1593, Bermuda was dominated by forests of Bermuda cedar (Juniperus bermudiana)https://archive.org/stream/floraofbermuda00brit#page/n7/mode/2up.htm / with mangrove swamps on the coast. More deliberate settlement began after 1609, and colonists began clearing forests to use for building and shipmaking, and to develop agricultural cultivation. By the 1830s, the demands of the shipbuilding industry had denuded the forests, but these recovered in many areas. In the 1940s the cedar forests were devastated by introduced scale insects, which killed roughly 8 million trees. Replanting using resistant trees has taken place since then, but the area covered by cedar is only 10% of what it used to be. Another important component of the original forest was Bermuda palmetto (Sabal bermudana), a small palm tree. It now grows in a few small patches, notably at Paget Marsh. Other trees and shrubs include Bermuda olivewood (Cassine laneana) and Bermuda snowberry (Chiococca alba). The climate allows for the growth of other palms such as royal palm (Roystonea spp.) and coconut palm (Cocos nucifera), although the lack of very warm temperatures does not usually allow coconuts to fruit properly. Bermuda is the farthest north location in the Northern Hemisphere where coconut palms will grow naturally.International Palm Society Remnant patches of mangrove swamp can be found around the coast and at some inland sites, including Hungry Bay Nature Reserve and Mangrove Lake, Bermuda. These were important for moderating the effects of storms and providing transition habitats. Here black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) and red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) are the northernmost mangroves in the Atlantic. The inland swamps are particularly interesting as mangroves thrive in salty water; in this case, the saltwater arrives through underground channels rather than the usual tidal wash of coastal mangrove swamps. Areas of peat marsh include Devonshire, Pembroke, and Paget marshes. Bermuda has four endemic ferns:http://www.conservation.bm/endemic-ferns/ Bermuda maidenhair fern (Adiantum bellum), Bermuda Shield Fern (Thelypteris bermudiana), Bermuda cave fern (Ctenitis sloanei) and Governor Laffan's fern (Diplazium laffanianum). The latter is extinct in the wild but is grown at Bermuda Botanical Gardens. The endemic flora of the island also include two mosses, ten lichens and forty fungi. Among the many introduced species are the Casuarina (Casuarina equisetifolia) and Suriname cherry (Eugenia uniflora). =Endemic= File:Bermuda Cedar-01.jpgBermuda cedar (Juniperus bermudiana) Image:Bermuda Olivewood-00.JPGBermuda olivewood (Elaeodendron laneanum) Image:Sabal- bermudana.jpgBermuda palmetto (Sabal bermudana) Image:Bermuda Snowberry-00.JPGBermuda snowberry (Chiococca bermudiana) Image:Hypericum macrosepalum-00.JPGSt. Andrew's cross (Hypericum macrosepalum) Image:Hypericum macrosepalum-01.JPGSt. Andrew's cross leaf Image:Peperomia septentrionalis-00.JPGWild Bermuda pepper (Peperomia septentrionalis) Image:Carex bermudiana-00.JPGBermuda sedge (Carex bermudiana) Image:Carex bermudiana-01.JPGBermuda sedge (Carex bermudiana) flower Image:Bermuda Maidenhair Fern-00.JPGBermuda maidenhair fern (Adiantum bellum) Bermudiana (Sisyrinchium bermudiana) Darrell's fleabane (\\"Erigeron darrellianus\\") Bermuda campylopus (moss) (\\"Campylopus bermudianus\\") Bermuda bean (\\"Phaseolus lignosus\\") Bermuda spike rush (\\"Elecharis bermudiana\\") Bermuda trichostomum (moss) (\\"Trichostomum bermudanum\\") Governor Laffan's fern (\\"Diplazium laffanianum\\") =Native= Image:Uva de playa (Coccoloba uvifera).jpgBay grape (Coccoloba uvifera) Image:Randia aculeata2924971286.gifBox briar (Randia aculeata) Image:Starr 010330-0598 Conocarpus erectus.jpgButtonwood (Conocarpus erectus) Image:Dodonea viscosa flowers1.JPGJamaica dogwood (Dodonaea viscosa) Image:Plody mangrovnika (Rhizophora mangle).jpgRed mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) Image:Cayos pict101.jpgSeven year apple (Casasia clusiifolia) Image:Plucheaodorata.jpgShrubby fleabane (Pluchea odorata) Image:Sugarberry Celtis laevigata 2009-04-05.jpgSouthern hackberry (Celtis laevigata) Image:Suriana maritima flowers.JPGTassel plant (Suriana maritima) * Forestiera (Forestiera segregata) * Lamarcks trema (Trema lamarckiana) * Black mangrove (Avicennia nitida) * White stopper (Eugenia axillaris) * Wild coffee shrub (Psychotria undata) * Yellow wood (Zanthoxylum flavum) Animals =Amphibians= Bermuda has no native amphibians. A species of toad, cane toad (Rhinella marina), and two species of frog, Antilles coqui (Eleutherodactylus johnstonei), and Eleutherodactylus gossei were introduced by humans and subsequently became naturalized. R. marina and E. johnstonei are common, but E. gossei is thought to have been recently extirpated. =Reptiles= Four species of lizard and two species of turtle comprise Bermuda's non-marine reptilian fauna. Of the lizards, the Bermuda skink (Plestiodon longirostris), also known as the rock lizard , is the only endemic species. Once very common, the Bermuda skink is critically endangered. The Jamaican anole (Anolis grahami) was deliberately introduced in 1905 from Jamaica and is now by far the most common lizard in Bermuda. The Leach's anole (Anolis leachii) was accidentally introduced from Antigua about 1940 and is now common. The Barbados anole (Anolis extremus) was accidentally introduced about 1940 and is rarely seen. The diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) is native to Bermuda. The red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) was introduced as a pet, but has subsequently become invasive.\\"Red-eared slider\\", Conservation =Mammals= All mammals in Bermuda are human introductions, except for four species of migratory North American bats of the genus Lasiurus: the hoary bat, eastern red bat, Seminole bat and silver-haired bat. Early accounts refer to wild or feral hogs, descendants of pigs left by the Spanish and Portuguese as feedstock for ships stopping at the islands for supplies. The house mouse, brown rat and black rat were accidentally introduced soon after the settlement of Bermuda, and feral cats have become common as another introduced species. =Birds= Over 360 species of bird have been recorded on Bermuda. The majority of these are migrants or vagrants from North America or elsewhere. Only 24 species breed; 13 of these are thought to be native. One endemic species is the Bermuda petrel or cahow (Pterodroma cahow), which was thought to have been extinct since the 1620s. Its ground-nesting habitats had been severely disrupted by introduced species and colonists had killed the birds for food. In 1951, researchers discovered 18 breeding pairs, and started a recovery program to preserve and protect the species. An endemic subspecies is the Bermuda white-eyed vireo or chick-of- the-village (Vireo griseus bermudianus). The national bird of Bermuda is the white-tailed tropicbird or longtail, which is a summer migrant to Bermuda, its most northerly breeding site in the world. Other native birds include the eastern bluebird, grey catbird and perhaps the common ground dove. The common moorhen is the most common native waterbird; very small numbers of American coot and pied-billed grebe are breeding. Small numbers of common tern nest around the coast. The barn owl and mourning dove colonized the island during the 20th century, and the green heron has recently begun to breed. Of the introduced birds, the European starling, house sparrow, great kiskadee, rock dove, American crow and chickenhttp://www.conservation.bm/feral-chickens/ are all very numerous and considered to be pests. Other introduced species include the mallard, northern cardinal, European goldfinch and small numbers of orange-cheeked and common waxbills. The yellow-crowned night heron was introduced in the 1970s to replace the extinct native heron. A white-tailed tropicbird or longtail Fossil remains of a variety of species have been found on the island, including a crane, an owl and the short-tailed albatross. Some of these became extinct as the islands' land-mass shrunk, while others were exterminated by early settlers. The Bermuda petrel was thought to be extinct until its rediscovery in 1951. Among the many non-breeding migrants are a variety of shorebirds, herons and ducks. In spring many shearwaters can be seen of the South Shore. Over 30 species of New World warbler are seen each year, with the yellow-rumped warbler being the most abundant. The arrival of many species is dependent on weather conditions; low-pressure systems moving across from North America often bring many birds to the islands. Among the rare visitors recorded are the Siberian flycatcher from Asia and the fork- tailed flycatcher and tropical kingbird from South America. =Terrestrial invertebrates= Monarch butterfly More than 1100 kinds of insects and spiders are found on Bermuda, including 41 endemic insects and a possibly endemic spider. Eighteen species of butterfly have been seen; about six of these breed on the islands, including the large monarch and the very common Bermuda buckeye (Junonia coenia bergi). More than 200 moths have been recorded; one of the most conspicuous is Pseudosphinx tetrio, which can reach in length. Bermuda has lost a number of its endemic invertebrates, including the Bermuda cicada (Neotibicen bermudianus), which became extinct when the cedar forests disappeared. Some species feared extinct have been rediscovered, including a Bermuda land snail (Poecilozonties circumfirmatus) and the Bermuda ant (Odontomachus insularis). Marine life Humpback whale Bermuda lies on the western edge of the Sargasso Sea, an area with high salinity, high temperature and few currents. Large quantities of seaweed of the genus Sargassum are present and there are high concentrations of plankton, but the area is less attractive to commercial fish species and seabirds. Greater diversity is present in the coral reefs which surround the island. A variety of whales, dolphins and porpoises have been recorded in the waters around Bermuda. The most common of these is the humpback whale, which passes the islands in April and May during its northward migration. Threats and preservation Bermuda was the first place in the Americas to pass conservation laws, protecting the Bermuda petrel in 1616 and the Bermuda cedar in 1622. It has a well-organised network of protected areas including Spittal Pond, marshes in Paget and Devonshire and Pembroke Parishes, Warwick Pond and the hills above Castle Harbour. Only small areas of natural forest remain today; much was cleared since colonisation began in the 17th century, and recovered forest was lost in the 1940s due to insect infestation. The Bermuda petrel and Bermuda skink are highly endangered, and Bermuda cedar, Bermuda palmetto and Bermuda olivewood are all listed as threatened species. Some wild plants, including a spike rush, have disappeared. Introduced plants and animals have had adverse effects on the wildlife of the islands. The thriving tourist industry creates its own challenges to preserve the wildlife and habitat that attract visitors. References * Amos, Eric J. R.

It was responsible for the administration of SS-Junkerschulen (SS-Junker Schools), medical services, logistics, and rates of pay. It was also the administrative and operational headquarters for the Waffen-SS that was responsible for its organisation and equipment and Order of battle of SS combat units. Formation The SS-F√ºhrungshauptamt, which was under the command of Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, was formed in August 1940 from certain departments of the SS-Hauptamt (SS-HA) and the Allgemeine SS. Its main duty was the operational and administrative control of the Waffen-SS, including developing general policy on recruiting and handling special personnel requirements. It also oversaw the Kommandoamt der Allgemeine SS (General SS HQ). Hans J√ºttner was promoted to the position of chief-of-staff of the SS-FHA and handled the day-to-day operations. When Himmler stepped down as SS-FHA chief in 1943, J√ºttner took over as chief of the department till the end of the war. Recruiting members for the Waffen-SS was handled through the SS-HA and its chief, Gottlob Berger. This caused overlapping jurisdiction and friction between the two SS branches. Berger's SS-HA had a problematic relationship with the SS-FHA, which was responsible for organising, training and equipping the Waffen-SS. J√ºttner's initial efforts at integrating the recruits from western Europe and Scandinavia were inadequate with insufficient emphasis on training and appointing officers and non-commissioned officers from the ranks of the new recruits. The SS-FHA also wanted the Waffen-SS to be a small elite corps, but Berger and Himmler knew that Adolf Hitler needed as many divisions as possible, even if that meant some Waffen-SS formations would be of lesser quality. During the war years, to meet the high casualty rates and expansion needs of the Waffen-SS, members of the Allgemeine SS and other personnel working for SS organisations were used for compulsory recruitment drives by the SS-HA to meet the manpower needs of the Waffen-SS.

He retired as the all-time leader in victories at the University of Illinois with 423 victories and New Mexico State with 289 victories. Overall Henson won 779 games, putting him in sixteenth place on the all-time list. Henson was also one of only four NCAA coaches to have amassed at least 200 total wins at two institutions. On February 17, 2015, Henson was selected as a member of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. In August 2015, prior to the reopening of the newly renovated State Farm Center at the University of Illinois, the hardwood floor was dedicated and renamed Lou Henson Court in his honor. The court at the Pan American Center at New Mexico State University is also named in his honor. Early life and education Born in Okay, Oklahoma, Henson graduated from Okay High School in 1951 and matriculated at Connors Junior College before transferring to New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (New Mexico A&M;, now New Mexico State University). He lettered in basketball for the New Mexico A&M; Aggies from 1953 to 1955 and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1955 and master's degree in 1956. Career Henson began his coaching career at Las Cruces High School in Las Cruces, New Mexico in 1956. After two years as junior varsity coach, Henson was head coach of the varsity team from 1958 to 1962 and won state championships in 1959, 1960, and 1961. He started coaching in the college ranks in 1962 at Hardin-Simmons University. As a condition of taking the Hardin-Simmons job, Henson insisted that the team (and thus the school) be racially integrated, a condition to which the university agreed. In 1966, he took over at his alma mater, New Mexico State University. In his first season at NMSU, the Aggies rebounded from a 4‚Äì22 record in the prior season to finish 15‚Äì11 and went to the NCAA Tournament. In 1970, Henson would help lead the Aggies to the Final Four for the only time in the school's history. Henson and future NBA players Jimmy Collins, Sam Lacey, and Charlie Criss lost in the tournament semifinal to eventual champion UCLA, the third time in three years the Aggies lost to UCLA in the tournament. Henson coached at New Mexico State for nine seasons, with six trips to the NCAA Tournament and four twenty-win seasons. In 1975, Henson moved to the University of Illinois to replace Gene Bartow, after Bartow left Illinois to replace John Wooden at UCLA. In 21 years at Illinois, Henson garnered 423 wins and 224 losses (.654 winning percentage), and with a record of 214 wins and 164 losses (.567) in Big Ten Conference games. The 214 wins in Big Ten games were the third highest total ever at the time of his retirement. His best Fighting Illini team was the 1988-89 unit, which won a then-school record 31 games and went to the Final Four. At Illinois, Henson coached many future NBA players, including Eddie Johnson, Derek Harper, Ken Norman, Nick Anderson, Kendall Gill, Kenny Battle, Marcus Liberty, Steve Bardo, and Kiwane Garris, and was known for his trademark Lou-Do. Henson retired from Illinois at the end of the 1996-1997 season. In 1997, Henson returned to New Mexico State as interim head coach after Neil McCarthy was abruptly fired before the start of the season. Henson wanted to donate his time, but was told that state law didn't allow him to coach for free. He finally accepted a nominal salary of $1 per month. After a successful season, he was given his old job back on a permanent basis. His 1998‚Äì99 team won the Big West regular season and tournament titles‚Äînotably, the first time in Henson's career that he had won a conference tournament. He retired for good midway through the 2004‚Äì05 season due to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. His second stint allowed him to regain his standing as New Mexico State's all-time winningest coach, passing McCarthy. Health problems In July 2007, Henson announced that he was again undergoing chemotherapy for the same strain of lymphoma that he had battled four years previously. He was undergoing treatment in Champaign, Illinois, where he lived in the summer. In July 2015, Henson once again entered chemotherapy for \\"bone marrow problems.\\" Henson \\"returned to coaching\\" at age 82 as coach of the New Mexico House of Representatives team in a charity contest versus the New Mexico State Senate team on February 7, 2014. Henson died on July 25, 2020 at the age of 88.

The persona is mostly used by writers as a parody of Marvel's Captain America with exaggerated \\"patriotic values\\" and a sidekick called Ernie (aka Ernie The Battling Boy), who was similar to Bucky. General Glory first appeared in Justice League International #46 as a 1940s style hero placed in a modern world, resulting in cultural differences and personality issues. Whereas Captain America is patriotic, heroic, and rational, General Glory is so blindly patriotic that it approaches the point of fault, unwilling and psychologically unable to believe that his country or international peacekeeping organizations have a dark side. He was introduced as a comic foil for the jingoistic Green Lantern corps member Guy Gardner in the early 1990s. Fictional character biography =Joseph Jones= Joseph Jones was a soldier in World War II who was granted superior abilities by Lady Liberty herself upon saying the words: > \\"Lady of Liberty, hear my plea ‚Äî > For the land of the brave ‚Äî > And home of the free!\\" He became a government agent, under the authority of an Agent Newkirk Sharp. Sharp arranged for General Glory comic books to be published, so that people would believe he was a fictional character. In England, his adventures were published in the pages of Tuppenny Fun.Justice League Europe #20 (November 1990) During his many adventures in World War 2, General Glory worked with the original Beefeater, an English-based super hero. One mission saw him working with the time-travelling hero Booster Gold- who had come to 1943 looking for his missing adopted daughter- when a Nazi scientist was attempting to create a time machine, although Booster regarded Glory as mentally unbalanced at best.Booster Gold (vol. 2) #38 (January 2011) As with Marvel Comics' Captain America, General Glory disappeared in an Arctic mission. Rather than be encased in ice, however, he returned to America with little memory of his past. He would later learn that Sharp had drugged him and given him a new identity. Many years later, he was outbid for a General Glory comic book by Guy Gardner. He persuaded Gardner to let him read the book by offering him the refund price of the bid. Reading the comic, Jones shouts out the magic words and became General Glory again. Shortly after this, he was arrested for treason by Ernest E. Earnest. It eventually transpired that Sharp had framed Glory to divert suspicion from himself. Ernie confronted him and was shot. Sharp was brought to justice by Glory and the Justice League, and General Glory became a member of the team. Maxwell Lord considered that a true Golden Age hero might be good for their image, and Glory thereafter assists the team from time to time. For example, Glory and the JLA defeat a revenge-crazed elderly Nazi that had been plaguing Jones with technologically advanced threats for some time; often chasing him out of the latest home Jones had created. Said Nazi is finally defeated in issue #50.Justice League of America (vol. 1) #50 (May 1991) In this time period, Glory owns a dog named 'Liberty'; the pet is featured in a later Justice League Quarterly issue. The dog unintentionally helps save the JLA who were having miniaturization issues.Justice League Quarterly #3 (Summer 1991) Glory assists the League in saving Ice from demonic possession. At the same time he tries to help Maxwell Lord with his seeming drinking problem.Justice League Quarterly #4 (fall 1991) =Donovan Wallace= During one of Jones's transformations into his elderly self, he suffered a cardiac episode and ended up in the hospital next to New York City policeman Donovan Wallace, who had become paralyzed risking his life to save a child from gangsters. By this point, Jones was too weak to change into his alter ego, but he regaled Wallace with inspiring stories about his adventures as Glory (the stories paralleled thematic trends in superhero comics). Initially skeptical, Donovan eventually came to believe in the spirit of glory and he was able to tap into the same energies that once powered Jones. He manifested great strength and agility, wings and throwing razors. He left his hospital bed and crushed the gangs that had crippled him. When he returned to the hospital, Jones was in cardiac arrest. In order to keep his legacy alive, Jones bequeathed his powers to Donovan, whose full mobility was restored. As Donovan becomes the second General Glory, Jones passes away.Justice League Quarterly #16 (September 1994) Wallace was known to be estranged from his wife and child, but in Justice Society of America vol. 3 #3 it is revealed that Wallace and everyone attending his wedding was dismembered during the ceremony by a Nazi-themed team called the Fourth Reich. This group's mission, backed up by the villain Vandal Savage, was to destroy the legacy of all American heroes whose identities were closely tied to America itself.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #3 (April 2007) During the 52 series, Martian Manhunter constructs a JLA memorial in the hills above Happy Harbor, a statue dedicated to each fallen JLA member, Glory included. Powers and abilities *General Glory was mystically endowed with enhanced strength and durability, but only in his \\"General Glory\\" persona, otherwise he was a frail 80-year-old man. He has demonstrated enough strength to lift objects as heavy as tanks. He was in peak physical condition in all other aspects and a capable military tactician. He seemed impervious to the effects of old age in his superhero persona, but when he decided to go back to being an ordinary human he would die of old age. *He seldom utilized his abilities, instead choosing to give long winded patriotic speeches. This was actually useful as it drew fire away from other Justice League members, as villains quickly wanted to kill General Glory to avoid having to endure his dissertations on morality. *The second General Glory demonstrated some different powers and weapons than the first. He had a sharp throwing star that would return to him after being released, and also had golden bird wings that enabled him to fly. Other versions *One possible future shows an older Power Girl traveling back in time to World War II and meeting with Ernie and Glory. Distracted by Power Girl's attractiveness, Ernie is slain by a falling bomb. Glory somehow convinces Power Girl to become his new, bowl-headed sidekick. *Another possible future stays in the future, where a Glory-influenced League, bowl- haircuts for all, is reformed. This and the older Power Girl event take place in the second JLE annual.Justice League Europe Annual #2 (1991) *In one future-past event, Lobo arrives in the wrong time and gender from Heaven.

He was executed as a traitor in 1938, following a \\"purge\\" of the Soviet film industry, and much information about him was expunged from the public record as a consequence. Life and career Shumyatsky was born in Verkhneudinsk (now Ulan-Ude) in the vicinity of Lake Baikal in Russian Siberia. He appears to have been active in communist circles by 1903. He was a member of the Bolshevik committee in Krasnoyarsk during the 1905 revolution, and was arrested for his role in organising a rail strike. He escaped and by 1907 was working underground in Vladivostok. Arrested again, he was deported to the same region of Siberia where Joseph Stalin was in exile. Following the Russian Revolution he was a party functionary in Soviet Siberia, including a stint as premier of the Far Eastern Republic from November 1920 to April 1921. From 1923 to 1925, he represented Soviet interests in Iran, and after that was in charge of the Communist University of the Toilers of the East, and then a member of the Central Asian Bureau of the Party Central Committee back in Siberia. In none of these capacities did he evidently have anything to do with film-making. Nonetheless, following a reorganization of the Soviet film industry he was selected by Stalin to become the head of Soyuzkino in December 1930. When Soyuzkino was dissolved and replaced by GUKF on February 11, 1933, he remained in charge and even with expanded powers over all matters of production, import/export, distribution and exhibition. He took over the film industry at a time when it was going through major technological changes, and rapid expansion. The number of cinemas in the USSR almost quadrupled under his supervision, to around 30,000, and silent movies were supplanted by 'talkies'. The first Soviet film with a full sound track was released in October 1931. He was also expected to end import of foreign equipment, and blank film when Soviet factories were not well equipped to supply demand, and he had to contend with tightening censorship and Stalin's personal obsession with cinema, which made it expedient to show new films to Stalin before they went on release, and in many cases to submit scripts to Stalin before shooting began. After visiting Hollywood, he also conceived the idea of creating a similar centre for the film industry at a spot near Odessa, where the climate and geography were similar to those of Hollywood and thus more amenable to year-round film-making. This vision extended to the building of an entire film community, to be called Kinograd‚Äîa highly expensive proposition. The output of Soviet films certainly deteriorated in quantity under his supervision: only 35 new films were completed in 1933, compared with 148 in 1928; in 1935, of a planned 130 feature films, only 45 were completed; in 1936, only 46 of 165; in 1937‚Äî his final year‚Äî only 24 of 62. This may have been because he was operating under impossible conditions. Alexander Barmine, who worked with Shumyatsky in Tehran, found him \\"gifted with astounding energy, capable of working all day and all night, eager and uncompromising... the stuff of which leaders are made\\" and believed that his job as head of the film industry was made impossible by the political demands made on him. By contrast, Jay Leyda, an American student who worked with Sergei Eisenstein, claimed that on the day Shumyatsky was eventually sacked \\"all of Moscow's film makers gave parties\\" to celebrate. Leyda's hostility to Shumyatsky resulted from what he saw as the systematic persecution of Eisenstein, who was prevented from completing a film for the entire time that Shumyatsky headed the film industry. Shumyatsky had a role in the suppression of Eisenstein's unfinished film Bezhin Meadow in 1937, though in the end it was Stalin's decision to ban it. On 18 March 1937 Shumyatsky delivered the opening speech at a three-day conference on cinema, which consisted mainly of an attack on Eisenstein, and on 28 March wrote a letter to Molotov denouncing seven people by name for conspiring to rescue the banned film and \\"discredit me as the stifler of the 'brilliant work of S. Eisenstein'\\". Four of those he named were arrested and shot. On 16 April, he sent Stalin a note suggesting that Eisenstein should never be allowed to make another film. Shumyatsky was arrested on 8 January 1938. On the same day, Pravda carried an excoriating account of his record as the head of the cinema industry. He was accused of collaborating with saboteurs within the film industry. On 28 June 1938 he was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad. His reputation was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956.

Bates stamping can be used to mark and identify images with copyrights by putting a company name, logo and/or legal copyright on them. This process provides identification, protection, and automatic consecutive numbering of the images. History The Bates Automatic Numbering-Machine or Bates stamper is named after the late 19th century inventor Edwin G. Bates of New York City. He obtained several United States patents for the device from 1891 to 1901, and the patents were assigned to the Bates Manufacturing Company. ‚Äî Consecutive- Numbering Machine (October 18, 1892) ‚Äî Automatic Numbering-Machine (June 11, 1901) ‚Äî Automatic Numbering-Machine (June 11, 1901) The earliest patent claimed a \\"new and useful improvement in Consecutive-Numbering Machines\\", indicating that Bates was not the originator of the idea. Bates' objective was \\"generally to increase the effectiveness, simplicity and compactness of machines of this general character\\". Each time the machine was pressed down onto a sheet of paper, a rotating wheel was moved incrementally. The original machine described by Bates allowed numbering with a four-digit sequence, ranging from 0000 to 9999. For example, page 852 in a document set would be 0852. Courts and law firms quickly adopted this system. General Binding Corporation (now General Binding LLC) acquired Bates Manufacturing Company in 1993. Usage Bates numbering is commonly used as an organizational method to label and identify legal documents. Nearly all American law firms use Bates stamps, though the use of manual hand-stamping is becoming increasingly rare because of the rise in electronic numbering ‚Äî mostly in Portable Document Format (PDF) files rather than printed material. During the discovery phase of litigation, a large number of documents might require the use of unique identifiers for each page of each document for reference and retrieval. Bates numbering, named for the Bates Automatic Numbering-Machine, assigns an arbitrary unique identifier to each page. Such identification may be solely numeric or may contain a combination of letters and numbers (alphanumeric). There is no standard method for numbering documents, nor is there a standard type face used for such numbers. Manual Bates stampers use a self-inking mechanism with four to seven numbered wheels. Some stampers allow for consecutive, repeat, duplicate, and triplicate numbering. Self-adhesive labels printed with Bates numbers are common today, as is electronic discovery (eDiscovery) software that can electronically \\"stamp\\" documents stored as computer files by superimposing numbers onto them. Bates numbering is neither universally used nor consistently applied; for example, The Bluebook style guide does not reference it. But, consistent with The Bluebook, the first citation should make it very clear what is being referenced, such as (Bates Jones000001) or (Bates d123-002), and subsequent consecutive cites should follow the usual practice of Id. followed by the page number, such as (Id. 000017) or (Id. -017).

He dedicated himself to very simple jobs: tailor, secretary of a judge, storekeeper in a mine, and worker at the Ministry of Public Works. He was an avid reader, and one of the most original Colombian literary writers, greatly influencing the younger generation of his time and later generations. Carrasquilla was little known in his time, according to Federico de On√≠s, a scholar of Carrasquilla's works. It was only after 1936, when he was already 68 years old, when he was awarded with the National Prize of Literature, that Carrasquilla got a national recognition. Tom√°s Carrasquilla Library Park is named in his honor. The Colombian civil wars of the second part of the 19th century prevented young Carrasquilla from continuing his studies at the University of Antioquia. A committed intellectual, Carrasquilla organized tertulias‚Äîsocial gatherings to read books and discuss them‚Äîin his Medell√≠n house. Many young writers and intellectuals of his time joined those tertulias; from that time he was called \\"Maestro Tom√°s Carrasquilla.\\" Among Carrasquilla's admirers was Colombian philosopher Fernando Gonz√°lez Ochoa. De On√≠s argues that Carrasquilla's work passed unknown in Colombia and abroad at the time because he lived during two different periods of Latin American literature: Costumbrismo and Romanticism, that had representatives like Jos√© Asunci√≥n Silva in Colombia, and the coming of Modernism as a reaction against Costumbrismo. As many classify the work of Carrasquilla as Costumbrist, so De On√≠s classifies him.  Context  Melit√≥n Rodr√≠guez. Carrasquilla's life straddled two centuries, becoming a link between two epochs in Colombia's history. When he was born in 1858, the country was called the Republic of New Granada, newly independent of Spain. In his work La Marqueza de Yolomb√≥, Carrasquilla described how the most simple people of the end of the 18th century saw the events that broke the Colombia's political dependence on Spain. He was also a citizen of the once-called United States of Colombia (1863‚Äì1886), a time when the Paisa Region saw the colonization of the current coffee areas. He also saw the Colombian industrial revolution at the beginning of the 20th century, the Thousand Days War, and many other changes in his country. The Colombian civil wars of the 19th century were the reason why Carrasquilla could not finish his studies of Law at the University of Antioquia. One of those civil wars was reflected in his works Luterito and El Padre Casaf√∫s (in English, \\"The Reverend Casaf√∫s\\"). Those books were set in the context of the civil war of 1876, started by the Conservative partisans of Antioquia, Cauca and Tolima against the Liberal government of president Aquileo Parra, who intended to secularize the education. The story develops in the town of Ca√±asgordas, where a group of fighters prepare themselves to \\"defend the Faith.\\" In this case, Carrasquilla's work is an approach to the deepest feelings of people during historical events.  Life  = First years = Carrasquilla was born in Santo Domingo, an Andean town north-east of Medell√≠n, on the Antioquean Mountain. He was the son of Isaza Carrasquilla and Ecilda Naranjo Moreno. His family owned some gold mines, and this allowed him to live well enough and dedicate himself to writing. One of his friends, also born in Santo Domingo, was the writer Francisco de Paula Rend√≥n. At the age of 15, he moved to Medell√≠n to finish his secondary education at the University of Antioquia; he continued his study of law there. He had to abandon his law studies in 1877 because of the start of the civil war. He returned to Santo Domingo, where he worked as a tailor and did some jobs in the municipality. Carlos Eugenio Restrepo invited him to the Caf√© Literario (\\"literary caf√©\\"), where he had to write a story in order to be admitted. He wrote Sim√≥n el Mago (\\"Simon the Mage\\"), one of his most popular stories. Sim√≥n was published in 1890, and brought to the cinema by Colombian director V√≠ctor Gaviria in 1993. = Writer = Bust of Tom√°s Carrasquilla in the Little Paisa Town Park in Medell√≠n. In 1896, Carrasquilla traveled to Bogot√° for the publication of his first novel, Frutos de Mi Tierra (\\"Fruits of my Land\\"), written to demonstrate that any subject can be the matter of a story, which was very well received by critics. On that trip, he came to know Jos√© Asunci√≥n Silva, to whom he would some years later dedicate the essay \\"For the Poet.\\" He returned to Antioquia and had an accident, falling from a horse, which made him stay in Medell√≠n for a time. When he returned to Santo Domingo, he dedicated himself to writing, until 1904, when he lost his fortune due to the Banco Popular bankruptcy. He then gained work as a storekeeper in a Sons√≥n gold mine until 1909. After Carrasquilla returned to Medell√≠n, he had a very lively social and cultural life, associating with young intellectuals like Fernando Gonz√°lez Ochoa, who became one of his best friend for the rest of his life. Gonz√°lez was one of Carrasquilla's biggest admirers. Carrasquilla also knew also the cartoonist Ricardo Rend√≥n, and the skeptic group Los Panidas (whom he supported, but never joined). In 1914, Carrasquilla did some work for Colombia's oldest newspaper, El Espectador, when that publication was edited in Medell√≠n. But soon thereafter, he moved to Bogot√°, where he worked for the Ministry of Public Works until 1919. Returning to Medell√≠n, he continued studying literature, and in 1928 published La Marqueza de Yolomb√≥ (\\"The Marchioness of Yolomb√≥\\"), one of the best-known works of Colombian literature.La Marqueza de Yolomb√≥ was made into a television series in the 1980s. = Last years = The writer stayed in Medell√≠n when his health began to decay and he started to go blind. In 1934, surgery gave him back limited vision; his blindness was not an obstacle to his writing, however, as he began to dictate his works. In 1935, Carrasquilla was decorated with the Cross of Boyac√°, an award that gives the recipient the same privileges as the president or ex-president of Colombia. He wrote Hace Tiempos (\\"Long Time Ago\\") by dictation between 1936 and 1937; that work won him the Jos√© Mar√≠a Vergara y Vergara National Prize of Literature and Science from the Colombian Academy of Language. This recognition gave him national fame, and attracted international critics, who admired his work and rescued his name from near-anonymity. In December 1940, Tom√°s Carrasquilla died among a large group of friends and admirers, who called him \\"Don Tom√°s\\" or \\"Maestro Tom√°s Carrasquilla.\\"  Between Costumbrism and Modernism  Tom√°s Carrasquilla Library in Medell√≠n. Carrasquilla is usually seen as a Costumbrist author, due to the cultural context of his world. The traditional details of the simple folk and the descriptions of scenery in his work are characteristic of Costumbrismo, which was developed in Spain and Latin America during the 19th century. The objective of the Costumbrist author is the description of the frame of the traditions of a people without any further comment to the respect and as a consequence of Romanticism. At the end of the 19th century, Modernism started to appear in Latin America and Spain. In Colombia, Modernism had authors, journalists, artists, and photographers like Gonz√°lez, Greiff, Rend√≥n, and Matiz. Modernism developed as a counter against Costumbrismo. According to Federico de On√≠s, Carrasquilla knew, and even shared, the new tendencies of Modernism; for example, he gave support to Los Panidas, but kept his own style and originality. In this sense, the classification of Carrasquilla as a Costumbrista is not exact. According to De On√≠s, Carrasquilla's work departs from the static Costumbrismo of the 19th century, that described through description of detail : For Colombian journalist Carlos Uribe de los R√≠os, Carrasquilla's classification as a Costumbrist author caused him a long marginalization within Colombian literature:  Fernando Gonz√°lez  Gonz√°lez, el fil√≥sofo de Otraparte, was a great admirer and friend of Carrasquilla. They had a regular correspondence and comments of their works. If there is one thing that proves that Carrasquilla was more than a Costumbrist, and that he used elements of realistic modernism in his work, it is his intellectual relationship and great friendship with the Fernando Gonz√°lez Ochoa, the fil√≥sofo de Otraparte (\\"Philosopher from somewhere else\\"). 39 years apart in age, Gonz√°lez knew Carrasquilla at the time he was founding Los Panidas with Rend√≥n and De Greiff in Medell√≠n . Gonz√°lez, another master of Colombian writing, said in one of his essays about the author in Hace Tiempos de Carrasquilla:  Works  Although Carrasquilla's works were only widely available in the Paisa Region during his life, it does not mean that he was completely ignored elsewhere in Colombia and abroad. Especially since 1936, with the recognition of the National Prize of Literature and Science, his work attracted the attention of foreign literary critics, like the Chileans Arturo Torres Rioseco and Mariano Latorre. He kept up a good friendship, by correspondence, with writers like Jos√© Mart√≠ and Miguel de Unamuno. Carrasquilla's works are divided into novels, stories, essays, articles, and letters. In 1906, he confessed in a letter to a friend that he was writing because of his economic problems, being in bankruptcy, although all his life he enjoyed a well-off lifestyle and he never married. Some of the articles he wrote in El Espectador made some observers suggest that he was a journalist, but his contributions to that field were rather limited. = Novels = * (1896) Frutos de mi tierra * (1897) En la diestra de Dios padre * (1897) Dimitas Arias * (1903) Salve, Regina * (1906) Entra√±as de ni√±o * (1910) Grandeza * (1920) Ligia Cruz * (1920) El Padre Casafus * (1920) Superhombre * (1925) El Zarco * (1928) La Marquesa de Yolomb√≥ * (1935‚Äì1936) Hace tiempos * Ligia Cruz * (1864‚Äì1866) Los malos h√°bitos * El Rifle = Stories = * (1890) Sim√≥n El Mago * (1890) Palonegro * (1897) Blanca (short story) * (1898) El √°nima sola * (1899) San Anto√±ito * (1926) Rogelio = Collections = Carrasquilla's articles and stories that appeared in different publications from Medell√≠n at the beginning of the 20th century were gathered in two collections: * (1914) Homil√≠as * (1934) Dominicales = The Marquess of Yolomb√≥ = La Marqueza de Yolomb√≥ (1926), a historical novel, is one of Carrasquilla's most popular novels.

Calvin Crest was established by the San Joaquin Presbytery of California in 1954. A brief history of Calvin Crest The Miwok Indians were the first people to live in the area of the Calvin Crest grounds, during the warm months and moving to the foothills and valley during the winter. In 1873 the California Lumber Company set up operations near here and built a flume which sent lumber to Madera. Completed in 1876, the flume was 53 miles (85 km) long. By 1907, 35 million board feet (82,000 m¬≥) were shipped each year. Much of the timber industry was shut down with the Great Depression of the 1930s. Remnants of the industry can be seen in the old narrow gauge railroad ties and the stumps of the giant sequoia that were left behind. Hills Speckerman, a German immigrant, homesteaded the Calvin Crest area. His first cabin was located by the current Maintenance parking lot where he planted the first apple trees, grew potatoes and bred pigs and dogs. After his cabin burned to the ground, he moved to the area known as Speckerman's Meadow. Following his death in 1909 at the approximate age of 90 years, the land reverted to the government for back taxes. John Nelder, a hermit living in the area among the giant sequoia, was visited by the naturalist, John Muir in what is now Nelder Grove which sits adjacent to Calvin Crest. A man named Darnold owned the property after Speckerman and he built the original Ranch House. Later, Dr. Clarence Wells homesteaded and then traded for an additional 300 acres (1.2 km¬≤). Working as a physician to the lumber companies, Dr. Wells expanded the Ranch as well as enlarged the apple orchard and planted roses and other exotic plants. In the early fifties, the San Joaquin Presbytery began looking for a property to purchase to establish a camping program. They had been renting the YMCA camp at Lake Sequoia. After some searching, they learned the property of Dr. Wells was for sale. The presbytery voted to purchase the 340 acres (1.4 km¬≤) in December 1954 with the price tag of $86,000. The summer of 1955 brought the first campers to Calvin Crest. There were two one-week sessions where the campers slept on the ground in the apple orchard and swam in Bass Lake. There were 65 campers and the annual budget was $25. In 1956, the first major building phase began when construction started on the Dining Hall and the swimming pool. Camping programs Calvin Crest designs and hosts Christian camping programs throughout the summer season. Programs are designed for third grade students through recent high-school graduates, as well as family camping programs. Calvin Crest offers High School Camp, Junior High Camp, Sherwood Camp (Third- Fifth Graders), Outdoor Adventure, and AIM (Assistants in Mission). Each program is organized and run by the Calvin Crest Summer Staff. Among several recreational activities, Calvin Crest offers: boating, hiking, swimming, fishing, rock climbing, arts and crafts, and a ropes course. From September to the late Spring, Calvin Crest hosts an Outdoor education program designed and taught by the Calvin Crest Outdoor Education staff. These programs are designed for fifth or sixth grade students.

The term portastudio is exclusive to TASCAM, though it is generally used to describe all self- contained cassette-based multitrack recorders dedicated to music production. The Portastudio, and particularly its first iteration, the Teac 144, is credited with launching the home-recording wave, which allowed musicians to cheaply record and produce music at home, and is cited as one of the most significant innovations in music production technology. The Teac 144 Portastudio made its debut in 1979, at the annual meeting of the Audio Engineering Society. It was followed by several other models by TASCAM, and eventually by several other manufacturers. For the first time it enabled musicians to affordably record several instrumental and vocal parts on different tracks of the built-in four-track cassette recorder individually and later blend all the parts together, while transferring them to another standard, two-channel stereo tape deck (remix and mixdown) to form a stereo recording. The Tascam Portastudio 244, introduced in 1982, improved upon the previous design with overall better sound quality and more features, including: dbx noise reduction, dual/concentric sweepable EQ's, and the ability to record on up to 4 tracks simultaneously. In general, these machines were typically used by musicians to record demos, although they are still used today in lo-fi recording. The analog portastudios by TASCAM (a division of TEAC) and similar units by Fostex, Akai, Yamaha, Sansui, Marantz, Vestax, Vesta Fire, TOA, Audio-Technica, Peavey, and others generally recorded on high-bias cassette tapes. Most of the machines were four-track, but there were also six-track and eight-track units. Some newer digital models record to a hard disk, allowing for digital effects and up to 32 tracks of audio. Function The Portastudio supported the bouncing of content between tracks, such as creating a mix of three tracks and recording the sum onto the fourth track. By carefully balancing the volume and equalization, this could be done multiple times to create very lush tracks, reminiscent of the complex four- track production of late-sixties Beatles compositions. A limitation was the introduction of tape hiss, which was a particular issue with early models. This was eliminated with more recent digital models. Unlike standard audio cassette machines that recorded a pair of stereo channels per side, the cassette-based Portastudios recorded four channels in one direction. If you played back a standard two-sided stereo cassette, the second two channels would play in reverse. One interesting (but unpublished) feature was that you could record a track in reverse by flipping the cassette, then flip it back and record additional material. Thanks to the speed control, it was also possible to create a classic flanging effect by recording one track, then recording a second copy of the same track while varying the pitch control, creating a sweeping sound at points where the two tracks converged. An additional feature was support for external signal processing during recording and on final output.

Named in honour of Saint Edmund Campion, Campion College offers a Bachelor of Arts in the Liberal Arts and welcomed its first intake of students in February 2006. The founding president was bioethicist Father John Fleming, and the first graduation ceremony was held in December 2008.  Courses  Campion offers a Bachelor of Arts in the Liberal Arts as its sole undergraduate degree. The key disciplines are history, literature, philosophy and theology. The program is structured (loosely) chronologically: with students studying the ancient world in first year, the Middle Ages and Enlightenment in second and finishing with modernity and postmodernity in the third and final year. Students may opt to complete a major in any of the four disciplines. Students are also required to complete two science subjects in their final year. They may also elect to study Latin and Greek above their normal study load. The focus of this course is the development of Western culture. The Campion program offers an integrated approach to study. Individual units are not taught in isolation, but as part of the broader framework of the development of Western culture. Campion College is classed as a Non-Self-Accrediting Institution. Its registration as an institution, and accreditation of courses, are completed through the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA). Accreditation is completed in accordance with the Australian Qualifications Framework. Approval was granted by NSW Department of Education & Training in April 2006 to enrol international students in the Bachelor of Arts. The college is also approved by the Australian Government as a Higher Education provider and as such, eligible students have access to FEE-HELP loans for tuition fees. The college plans to introduce postgraduate education through a Graduate Certificate, Graduate Diploma and a Master of Arts in the Liberal Arts. In 2011, the college had an external quality audit by the Australian Universities Quality Agency (AUQA), with commendations received in relation to the academic and quality culture that have been established. In 2011, the college established the Centre for the Study of Western Tradition to encourage critical reflection and research on the history, literature, languages, philosophy and theology that characterise Western civilisation and culture, in order to raise the profile of these vital disciplines in Australian tertiary education. The Centre holds conferences and symposia relating to its central research themes.  History  In its first year of operation, the college's intake was 16 students. Since then, new enrollments have averaged 20‚Äì30 per year, for a total student body of around 80. A total of 78 students were enrolled in 2017. A total of 77 students were enrolled in 2018. Campion College publishes a quarterly newsletter, Campion's Brag. The Campion College Student Association (CCSA) publishes a quarterly magazine called The Sextant.  Campus  The college's campus and grounds had been a Marist Fathers seminary which was dedicated to, and at one time held relics of, Saint Peter Chanel. The campus houses a chapel, library, accommodation, lecture and tutorial rooms, kitchens, and student areas. In 2018, the college constructed two new residential houses on-site, providing accommodation for an additional 34 students.

Early life and education  Young was born in Monroe County, Iowa. His early education was acquired in the public schools and in printing offices at Albia, Iowa and Des Moines, Iowa.\\"History of Iowa From the Earliest Times to the Beginning of the Twentieth Century,\\" Vol 4 (Biography of Lafayette Young). His first business establishment was a newspaper in Atlantic, Iowa, which he named the Telegraph.  Career  In 1873, he was elected as a Republican to a seat in the Iowa State Senate representing Adair, Cass, Adams and Union counties, and was re-elected in 1877, and (after a six-year absence) in 1885. In all, he served in the Iowa Senate from 1874 to 1880, and 1886 to 1888. In 1890 Young moved to Des Moines and purchased a daily newspaper known as the Daily Iowa Capital or (after 1901) the Des Moines Capital. In 1893, Young was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for Governor of Iowa, losing to Frank D. Jackson. He served as a war correspondent during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. When Iowa Senator Jonathan P. Dolliver died suddenly in October 1910, Young was appointed by Iowa Governor Beryl F. Carroll as Dolliver's immediate replacement. Soon after his appointment, his position was up for election in the 1911 Iowa General Assembly, where the Republicans held a large majority but were deeply divided among a long list of candidates for Young's seat. The inability of any candidate to receive the required majority of 76 legislators forced the General Assembly to re-vote each morning of the session. Young was the principal Republican opponent of Fort Dodge attorney William S. Kenyon until the 23rd ballot, when Young lost most of his support to other candidates. Kenyon was ultimately elected on the final day of the session on the 67th ballot.\\"Judge Kenyon is Elected Senator as Session Ends,\\" Cedar Rapids Evening Gazette, 1911-04-13 at p.1. In all, Young served in the U.S. Senate from November 1910 to April 1911. After his Senate service, Young returned to Des Moines and his newspaper. He again became a war correspondent, travelling to southeastern Europe in 1913 to cover the Second Balkan War.\\"Most Brutal of Wars,\\" New York Times, 1913-07-29 at p. 2. In 1915, he again returned to Europe, this time to assess the early stages of World War I (before the United States' entry). During that trip he was detained in Innsbruck by Austria-Hungary, but was later released.\\"'America is Hated by all Germans,'\\" New York Times, 1915-05-30 at p. 4 (Photo section). After the United States declared war in 1917, he was appointed chairman of the Iowa State Council for Defense. As the Council's chairman, Young urged that \\"disloyal\\" persons should be impoverished and imprisoned, arguing that \\"[a]ny man who has lived under the protection of our laws and has accumulated wealth and is now disloyal should be deprived of every dollar he possesses and he should be interned in a stockade until the end of the war and at that time his fate should be considered carefully.\\"\\"His Platform, Good for All,\\" The Lake Park News, 1918-08-01 at 1.

In recognition of his work in raising funds in Iowa for the children of Belgium, Young was made a Knight of the Order of Leopold II of Belgium. He continued to edit his newspaper until his death in Des Moines on November 15, 1926. He was interred there in Woodland Cemetery. References External links Editorial Cartoons of J.N.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest football players in Michigan history. He was selected by Sports Illustrated as the fourth greatest athlete in the history of the U.S. state of Michigan in 2003 and one of the eleven greatest college football players of the first century of the game (ending in 1968). During his collegiate athletic career he was a Big Ten batting champion in baseball, Big Ten scoring champion in basketball, and Big Ten touchdown leader in football. He was the first University of Michigan athlete to become a first-team All- American in basketball and the first three-time first-team football All- American. In high school, he had been an All-American basketball player, a state champion in track and field, and an All-state player in baseball and football. In addition to his All-American collegiate performances as an end, Oosterbaan threw three touchdown passes in the dedication game of Michigan Stadium. After his playing career ended, Oosterbaan spent several decades working for the University of Michigan Athletic Department until the 1970s. Oosterbaan served as the football, basketball, and baseball coach for the University. Oosterbaan's 1948 Michigan Wolverines football team won an Associated Press national championship, and his 1950 squad won the 1951 Rose Bowl. He later served as the director of athletic alumni relations. Athletic career Born in Muskegon, Michigan, Oosterbaan began his athletic career at Muskegon High School where he was selected by the Detroit News as an All-State end. In his junior year (1923), he led the Muskegon basketball team to a state championship and was named a High School All-American in basketball. He was also an All-State baseball player and state champion discus thrower. According to a Michigan Today article, he probably could have made the 1928 Summer Olympics team in the discus. At Michigan, Bennie Oosterbaan earned nine letters‚Äîthree apiece in football, basketball, and baseball. In its obituary of Oosterbaan, The Sporting News described him as a phenomenal student-athlete who in his senior year at Michigan \\"was captain of the football team, led the Big Ten Conference in scoring in basketball and was the league's leading hitter in baseball, a sport he had not pursued while in high school.\\" Oosterbaan was both a scholar and an athlete. In 1928, he was awarded the Western Conference Medal of Honor for proficiency as a scholar-athlete. That season, he was captain, most valuable player, and an All-American in football; Big Ten scoring champion and All-American in basketball; and Big Ten batting average champion in what may be the most dominant three sport performance in any conference in a single year. =Football= 250px After a year on the freshmen football team, he was invited to varsity tryouts. A star receiver and defensive end in a time when the forward pass was still evolving, Oosterbaan united with quarterback Benny Friedman as a passing combination. As a sophomore in 1925, Oosterbaan led the Big Ten with eight touchdowns. That year, the Wolverines outscored their opponents 227‚Äì3. The team shut out every team they faced, except a 3‚Äì2 defeat to Northwestern at Soldier Field late in the season. Oosterbaan's defensive play was outstanding as well, and he was key in shutting out the Fighting Illini and Red Grange 3‚Äì0 in 1925 a year after he scored four touchdowns in the first twelve minutes. Five players from the 1925 team were named All-Americans, including Benny Friedman and Oosterbaan. He was briefly kicked off of the team during the year by an assistant coach for lining up incorrectly before coach Fielding H. Yost brought him back. In 1926, Friedman and Oosterbaan were both named All- Americans after leading the Wolverines to a 7‚Äì1 record and their second consecutive Big Ten Conference championship. That year, his 60-yard run with a recovered fumble helped Michigan to a 7‚Äì6 victory over Minnesota in the annual Little Brown Jug game. The Wolverines outscored their opponents, 191‚Äì38, and suffered their only loss to Navy, 10‚Äì0, in front of 80,000 fans at Baltimore Stadium. The following year, Friedman had moved on to the NFL, and Oosterbaan was named the team's captain and Most Valuable Player. Oosterbaan was a skilled passer, once throwing for three touchdowns passes in the Michigan Stadium dedication game against rival Ohio State University on October 22, 1927. Oosterbaan was also selected as an All-American for the third consecutive season. He is one of only two players at Michigan ever to receive consensus All-American honors three times‚ÄîAnthony Carter being the other. The Wolverines went 20‚Äì4 in Oosterbaan's career at Michigan. =Basketball= In addition to football, Oosterbaan was an All-American basketball forward. He led the Big Ten Conference in scoring (178 points) in his senior year. He was named All-American in both 1927 and 1928 and was a member of Michigan's first back-to-back Western conference champions under E. J. Mather during the 1925‚Äì26 and 1926‚Äì27 seasons (the latter being Michigan's first outright champion and Oosterbaan's first basketball All-American selection). Oosterbaan was the first Michigan All-American in basketball. He twice recorded double- doubles in this low scoring era. =Baseball= Oosterbaan was also an All- Conference baseball player who won the Big Ten batting title in 1927. He played both First baseman and pitcher. Coaching career Oosterbaan (left) with Alvin Wistert, 1949 After graduating, Oosterbaan declined offers to play professional football and baseball. According to friend and player Ron Kramer, Oosterbaan grew up in the Dutch Reformed Church and did not sign a professional football or baseball contract \\"because of his religious background and his mother. Dutch Reformed didn't play football on Sundays.\\" Instead, Oosterbaan stayed on at the University of Michigan as an assistant coach for the football and basketball teams. He began as an assistant football coach immediately after graduating, and he remained an assistant coach of the football team for twenty years before succeeding Fritz Crisler. After serving 10 seasons as an assistant coach, he also became the head basketball coach in 1938 and served in that capacity until 1946. The basketball team had an 81‚Äì72 record while Oosterbaan was the head coach. Oosterbaan employed an uptempo style of play that differed from that of his predecessor Franklin Cappon. Oosterbaan was also head coach of the freshman baseball team. Oosterbaan from 1957 Michiganensian In 1948, Oosterbaan took over as head coach of the football team at Michigan. Crisler named Oosterbaan as his successor after the 1948 Rose Bowl in which Michigan beat the USC Trojans by a score of 49‚Äì0. Crisler described Oosterbaan as \\"the best offensive mind in college football.\\" Oosterbaan led the Wolverines to an Associated Press (AP) national championship in his first season and won Coach of the Year honors. His 1950 team won the 1951 Rose Bowl after Oosterbaan obtained consent from the Conference to hold extra practices. His teams won Big Ten championships in each of his first three seasons but did not win another under his tenure. He coached at Michigan until 1958, compiling a 63‚Äì33‚Äì4 record. Oosterbaan believed success was fleeting. He once was quoted in Time Magazine as saying, \\"I'm on top now, and there is a lot of backslapping. But what of seasons to come? Let me lose the opener or a couple of other games next fall, and then watch how I'm blasted.\\" As coach, he had a reputation as a mild-mannered man who aspired to live by the maxims of his own college football coach, Fielding Yost. Oosterbaan had a mild-mannered coaching style. \\"Poise\\" was his favorite word when it came to inspiring his team. He coached without using a lot of yelling and screaming. Oosterbaan motivated his players without using sarcasm or losing his temper, and rarely used locker room pep talks. Oosterbaan resigned as the head football coach in 1958. At the time, he said: \\"The pressure finally got to me. Not the kind that comes from outside. Not from my bosses or the fans. I mean the pressure that builds up inside a head coach whether he wins or loses.\\" After Oosterbaan quit as football coach he was succeeded by Bump Elliott. In 1959, Oosterbaan became Michigan's director of athletic alumni relations and held that position until he retired in 1972. Personal life Oosterbaan died in 1990, having spent his entire career associated with the University of Michigan. As one of his obituaries noted, he \\"went to Ann Arbor as a freshman in 1924‚Äîand never left.\\" All-American Ron Kramer said of his former coach: \\"Bennie Oosterbaan is the Michigan tradition. The man gave his whole life to Michigan.\\" When he died he was the most recent Michigan football coach to have a team ranked #1 in the nation at the end of the season. Oosterbaan's wife of 57 years, Delmas, had predeceased him a few months earlier on July 23. He was survived by his sister, Grace Hedner; his daughter, Anna Wilson; and two grandsons. Two of his brothers, Guy and Andy, died when Oosterbaan was a young man. Oosterbaan is no relation to John Paul Oosterbaan who was a member of the 1989 NCAA Championship basketball team. While at the University of Michigan he was a member of Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. Don Lund, Michigan's associate athletic director for alumni relations who also played basketball for Oosterbaan said: \\"There's no question he was the greatest athlete we ever had here at Michigan.\\" Ohio State Buckeyes football coach Woody Hayes once said of Oosterbaan: \\"If he weren't from Michigan, I'd like to have my own son play for him.\\" Honors and awards Jake Ryan wearing the Oosterbaan legend jersey in 2012 Bennie Oosterbaan's jersey number 47 was the first Michigan football jersey number retired, and until 2011, it was one of only five numbers retired by the Michigan football program. In 2012, the Michigan Football Legends program led to the reissue of the No. 47 jersey to linebacker Jake Ryan, bearing a patch (pictured at right) honoring Oosterbaan. Each player to wear the jersey will also dress at a locker bearing a plaque with Oosterbaan's name and his time of tenure at Michigan. In 1954, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. He was a member of the fourth class of inductees into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1958. Oosterbaan was a member of the inaugural 1978 class of inductees into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor. The Michigan football indoor practice facility was named Oosterbaan Field House. In 2000, he was selected to the Michigan All-Century team. American sports-writer, Grantland Rice selected him and Don Hutson as the ends for the all-time All-American team of the first half of the 20th century. A poll of Michigan alumni and friends in 1979 selected Oosterbaan as Michigan's greatest all-time football player. In 1969, Sports Illustrated named him to the eleven-man All-Century team for the period 1869‚Äì1968.

Unlike the rest of his family, including his father Abu Bakr and sister Aisha, he did not convert to Islam until the Treaty of Hudaybiyah in 628 AD.Siddiq-e-Akbar Hazrat Abu Bakr by prof. Masud ul Hassan Printed and Published by A.

It was believed that no other family held this distinction. Participation in battles While still a non-Muslim, Abdul-Rahman fought from the side of Quraish in the Battles of Badr and Uhud. In the Battle of Badr, he had an opportunity to kill his father, Abu Bakr, but he turned in another direction. Years later, after becoming Muslim, he told his father about it. Thereupon Abu Bakr replied: \\"If I had had such an opportunity, I would not have spared you.\\"As-Suyuti, Tarikh al-Khulafa. Translated by Jarrett, H. S. (1881). The History of the Caliphs, p. 35.

He was one of the Mubarizun champions and fought duels in the battles for the Muslim army. The mubarizun unit of the Rashidun army was composed of elite warriors who were champion swordsmen, lancers and archers. In the battlefield his role was to undermine the morale of the enemy before the beginning of the battle by slaying their champions in duels. In the Battle of Yamama he killed Muhakkam al-Yamama, the General commanding the forces of Musaylima. In the Battle of Yarmouk, the Commander in chief of Byzantine force chose five selected warriors from Byzantine side, and they challenged the Muslims to duel. It was Abdul-Rahman who accepted the challenge. Scores of duels were fought on the plains of Yarmouk. Abdul-Rahman killed all of them one after the other.Hadrat 'Umar Faroo By prof.

He was best known for his legal problems arising from his conflict with the oil and gas industry. He was convicted in R v Ludwig [2000] AJ v509 at 293 on several counts (see infra) for sabotaging oil and gas wells. From the early 1990s until the time that he died, Ludwig consistently accused the industry of poisoning his family and farm through their attempts to extract toxic sour gas from the Peace River region of Alberta. Background Ludwig was born during World War II and emigrated to Canada with his family from Friesland in the northern part of the Netherlands shortly after the war. He had seven older siblings. The family maintained strong religious beliefs and most kept ties with the Dutch Reformed Church or held some form of Baptist beliefs.Wittmeier In his early life, Ludwig worked as a carpenter and as a drywaller.Christopher, \\"Wiebo's Final Battle\\" He later studied pastoral ministry at Iowa's Dordt College which is associated with the Christian Reformed Church. While studying at Dordt, Wiebo met his future wife, Mamie, with whom he later had eleven children. Ludwig completed his pastoral education at the Calvin Theological Seminary in Grand Rapids, Michigan. After Ludwig completed his pastoral education, his initial application for ordination was rejected, possibly because his leadership style was perceived as being too authoritarian. He successfully appealed the decision and went on to lead two churches in Goderich, Ontario. Ludwig's leadership of the churches was controversial. In 1985, he led a group (His wife, their kids with another married couple and their children.) of his supporters to settle in a remote farming community near Hythe, Alberta, approximately 500 km northwest of the provincial capital of Edmonton. The small farming community started with a quarter section (160 acres), eventually added another, and grew into a self- sustaining community.Nikiforuk, \\"Saboteurs: Wiebo Ludwig's War Against Big Oil\\" The property contains several dozen buildings, including a biodiesel refinery, a greenhouse, and a mill. After the addition of windmills and solar panels, the community became capable of generating its own power, and a large computer-controlled boiler generates heat for the community's houses. Ludwig named the community \\"Trickle Creek\\". In 1985, there was only one sour gas well within a 2-mile radius of Trickle Creek; in the intervening 15 years, there were at least 10. Confrontations with authority In the early 1990s, oil companies in northern Alberta began building sour gas wells on land they owned near Trickle Creek. Ludwig believed he had linked the flared hydrogen sulfide sour gas and leaks from the wells with stillbirths, deformations, and miscarriages that began to occur in the community at the time, and began to protest sour gas development near his community. He appealed to both levels (eg.AGC Environmental Petition on \\"Sour gas leaks and emissions in Alberta\\") of government to regulate sour gas extraction near the community, but the government did not respond. Ludwig then produced a video titled \\"Home Sour Home\\" in order to gain broader attention. In an effort to gain the attention of the government he appeared at the government offices of Grande Prairie and poured sour crude oil on the lobby carpet. His appeals for government intervention were not successful. Latterly, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has acknowledged that \\"hydrogen sulfide in the air is an irritant and a chemical asphyxiant that can alter both oxygen utilization and the (human) central nervous system\\".Bloomberg report NP 13 August In 2013, Enbridge won the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's permission to refuse delivery of any oil with hydrogen sulfide that exceeded 5 parts per million, half the maximum exposure recommended by federal regulators, finding levels as high as 1,200 parts per million in some crude oil shipments from Bakken formation crude oil. =AEC West bombings= There were hundreds of acts of vandalism against natural gas sites across northern Alberta in the 1990s. Many of these attacks were against AEC West, the main company operating near Trickle Creek. The company negotiated with Ludwig in an attempt to buy his farm; but, two days after these negotiations failed, two of its wells 30 km from the farm were destroyed by explosions. A few days after these explosions, Ludwig stated: \\"If the oil companies run roughshod over your lives, you have to take defensive action against them, whatever is necessary... You can't just let them kill your children.\\" In 1998 the RCMP charged Ludwig for an attack on a Suncor well that occurred days after one of Ludwig's grandchildren was delivered stillborn. At a January 1999 bail hearing, the lawyer for Ludwig and another defendant revealed that RCMP officers had bombed an oil installation as part of a dirty tricks campaign during their investigation of acts against oil industry installations. The information was confirmed by crown prosecutors.CBC Online: RCMP bombed oil site in 'dirty tricks' campaign In April 2000 Ludwig was convicted and sentenced to 28 months in jail. He was convicted of five offenses, including blowing up one well, vandalizing another by pouring concrete into it, and counseling an undercover police officer to buy dynamite.Blackwell In October 2000 he attempted to run for the leadership of the Alberta Social Credit Party, but was forced to withdraw from the leadership contest after a judge refused to waive the conditions of his bail.Mertz He served time at a minimum security prison in Grande Cache, and was eventually released after only 19 months. He maintained his innocence after being released. =Death of Karman Willis= A teenage girl, Karman Willis, was killed in Trickle Creek in an incident that occurred in 1999 when a pickup truck full of adolescents trespassed on the Trickle Creek farm. Some residents of the farm, who were camping in the path of the truck, feared for their safety, and an unidentified person shot at the truck. Ludwig called 911, explaining to the operator that shots had been fired. The subsequent police investigation suggested that the bullet hit the bottom of the truck, then ricocheted up and hit Willis in the chest. A bullet also hit a second teen in the arm, but he survived.Stueck Police were never able to identify the shooter, and were not able to recover the weapon. No one was ever charged with the death, and local residents still refer to the exact nature of events that happened on the night of the shooting as \\"a mystery\\". =Indictments and convictions= On 11 February 2000, 18 charges were laid against Ludwig and Boonstra. Of these charges, on 20 April Judge Sanderman found that Ludwig had * counselled another to possess an explosive substance; * attempted the possession of fake dynamite; * done mischief by interfering with the lawful use and enjoyment of property, sec 430.1.c;Text of Criminal Code of Canada * done mischief by destroying property; * possessed an explosive substance; and sentenced him to 28 months in jail. At the time in Canada, sentences of over 24 months required that time be spent in a Federal penitentiary. Boonstra was sentenced to 21 days. After being released from prison Ludwig largely faded from media attention. In 2002 journalist Andrew Nikiforuk wrote a book on Ludwig, Saboteurs: Wiebo Ludwig's War Against Big Oil. In 2003 a made-for-TV movie was produced, Burn: The Robert Wraight Story, which was based on the life of an informant who had cooperated with the RCMP to provide evidence supporting Ludwig's conviction.Wilton =Encana bombings= In 2008, a series of letters threatening local gas companies was anonymously sent to the Dawson Creek Daily News and Coffee Talk Express in Chetwynd, B.C.. The letters threatened Encana to cease its operations near the small town of Tomslake, B.C., just south of Dawson Creek, and close to Trickle Creek. Following these letters local pipelines were hit by six explosions. Because these explosions were similar to other acts of vandalism which had occurred around Ludwig's farm, police suspected his involvement. Following the bombings Encana offered a reward of up to a million dollars for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of the bomber.News1130 Staff In September 2009 Ludwig wrote an open letter to the bomber(s) supporting their cause but encouraging them to stop their bombings.Canadian PressAssociated Press After forensics experts found Ludwig's DNA on two of the letters, Police arrested Ludwig in 2010 at a Super 8 Motel in Grande Prairie, where Ludwig had been invited on the pretext of helping with the investigation. After arresting Ludwig the RCMP then conducted a four-day search of Trickle Creek involving over a hundred RCMP officers. The RCMP found evidence which they believed was incriminating during the search, including potassium nitrate (an explosive chemical), 75 grams of marijuana, some chemistry books, handwritten notes which police believed detailed the location of hidden weapons, and notebooks full of information on Dawson Creek, the Canadian government, oil pipelines, and the oil and gas industry. Ludwig explained that the potassium nitrate was for toy rockets, that the marijuana was an anaesthetic, and that the chemistry texts were for homeschooling the community's children. A book on property terrorism was also found on Ludwig's nightstand, but Ludwig explained that it had been a gift. Ludwig was held in custody for a day. He was told that he would be charged with extortion, but was eventually released without being charged. Death Ludwig was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in 2011. He used an alternative medicine regimen that included injections of vitamin C and hydrogen peroxide.Canadian Press He also received conventional pain relievers and a stent in his throat enabling him to swallow. In the same year Ludwig was also the subject of a documentary, Wiebo's War, which treated his life and conflict with the oil and gas industry sympathetically. In February 2012, Ludwig built his own coffin, and he did his final media interview with journalist Byron Christopher. Ludwig died two months later, on April 9, in his log cabin. His last words were a request that his family not quarrel, and that they keep their faith. He was buried almost immediately in an above-ground crypt in a forest near his home. The funeral ceremony was private. The day after Ludwig died, RCMP officers asked his family if they could open Ludwig's coffin to take his body's fingerprints in order to verify his death, but Ludwig's family refused, calling the request \\"'odd,' 'invasive' and 'a terrible disrespect and interference' with human remains\\". RCMP officers explained that it is common for police to take fingerprints from a recently deceased person if that person has a criminal record, but third-party experts disputed this claim.Christopher, \\"A Dead Man's Prints\\"  References  Bibliography *Blackwell, Tom. \\"Sympathy for an Eco-warrior\\".

The plan was for the government to buy the wheat and then store it or export it at a loss. It was co-authored by Charles L. McNary (R-Oregon) and Gilbert N. Haugen (R-Iowa). Despite attempts in 1924, 1926, 1927, and 1931 to pass the bill, it was vetoed by President Calvin Coolidge, and not approved. It was supported by Secretary of Agriculture Henry Cantwell Wallace and Vice President Charles Dawes. According to the bill, a federal agency would be created to support and protect domestic farm prices by attempting to maintain price levels that existed before the First World War. By purchasing surpluses and selling them overseas, the federal government would take losses that would be paid for through fees against farm producers. Background The war had created an atmosphere of high prices for agricultural products as European nations demand for exports surged. Farmers had enjoyed a period of prosperity as US farm production expanded rapidly to fill the gap left as European belligerents found themselves unable to produce enough food. When the war ended, supply increased rapidly as Europe's agricultural market rebounded. Overproduction led to plummeting prices which led to stagnant market conditions and living standards for farmers in the 1920s. Worse, hundreds of thousands of farmers had taken out mortgages and loans to buy new equipment and land to expand and were now unable to meet the financial burden. The cause was the collapse of land prices after the wartime bubble when farmers used high prices to buy up neighboring farms at high prices, saddling them with heavy debts. Farmers, however, blamed the decline of foreign markets and the effects of the protective tariff. They demanded relief as the agricultural depression grew steadily worse in the middle 1920s while the rest of the economy flourished. Instability in the agricultural marketplace in the mid-1920s kept the bill afloat, along with other plans for government-implemented price and wage controls in various industries.Willard W. Cochrane, The development of American agriculture: A historical analysis (U of Minnesota Press, 1979). pp 100-121. Bill A plan suggested by George Peek and Hugh S. Johnson, of the Moline Plow Company, called for new tariffs to protect farmers from foreign producers and a federal program for price supports. Wallace and Henry C. Taylor, head of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, rallied behind the plan, which formed the basis for the bill introduced by McNary of Oregon and Representative Haugen of Iowa, both Republicans. The basic idea of the bill was an equalization fee. The government was to segregate the amounts required for domestic consumption from the exportable surplus. The former were to be sold at the higher domestic price (the world price plus the tariff), using the full advantage of the tariff rates on exportable farm products, and the latter at the world price. The difference between the higher domestic price and the world price received for the surplus was to be met by the farmers of each commodity in the form of a tax or equalization fee, which would be paid by American consumers in the form of higher food prices.John D. Black, \\"The McNary-Haugen Movement.\\" American Economic Review 18.3 (1928): 406-427. online The legislation was before Congress from 1924 to 1928. It received powerful and united support from agricultural interests in 1927 and in 1928, respectively, when it passed both houses. Gleason (1958) shows that most leading businessmen opposed the bill on the grounds that it was contrary to economic law and would cost money and involve the government in business. Farmers were urged to reduce production, practice crop diversification, and support the cooperative movement. The plan was opposed also on the moral ground that it would destroy the farmer's self-reliance. President Coolidge vetoes the bill President Calvin Coolidge listened to business and killed the bill twice with vigorous vetoes. Coolidge instead supported the alternative program of Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover and Agriculture Secretary William M. Jardine to modernize farming, by bringing in more electricity, more efficient equipment, better seeds and breeds, more rural education, and better business practices. Hoover advocated the creation of a Federal Farm Board, which was dedicated to restriction of crop production to domestic demand, behind a tariff wall, and he maintained that the farmer's ailments were because of defective distribution. Coolidge finally committed himself to a farm board plan for price stabilization by co-operatives. Rejecting the McNary‚ÄìHaugen plan, so popular in Congress, the Hoover plan was adopted in 1929.C. Fred Williams, \\"William M. Jardine and the Foundations for Republican Farm Policy, 1925-1929.\\" Agricultural History 70.2 (1996): 216-232 online. As president of Kansas State Agricultural College from 1918, Jardine developed a free-market program of education and co-operative marketing for Kansas farmers. His advice was increasingly sought in Washington and led in 1922 to the formation of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, meant to assist farm cooperatives. As Secretary of Agriculture after 1925, after the death of Wallace, Jardine made proposals that offered relief for farmers but preserved a free market, which led to Hoover's Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929, too far into the worsening farm crisis to succeed after the onset of the Great Depression.Williams 1996 Henry Agard Wallace, the son of the elder Wallace, was furious over Coolidge's vetoes of the McNary‚ÄìHaugen Bill and supported Alfred E. Smith against Hoover for the presidency in 1928. He was pleased by enactment of the Agricultural Marketing Act in the Hoover administration but cited its lack of provisions for checking overproduction, and he wrote hard- hitting editorials against the Hawley‚ÄìSmoot Tariff, which passed in 1930. The younger Wallace established himself as the preeminent Farm Belt leader, wrote the major farm speech of the Franklin D. Roosevelt presidential campaign, and in 1933, he became Secretary of Agriculture in his father's footsteps.Malcolm O. Sillars, \\"Henry A. Wallace's Editorials on Agricultural Discontent, 1921-1928.\\" Agricultural History 26.4 (1952): 132-140 online. Porter (2000) follows the growth of activity among the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation (IFBF) membership and leadership on behalf of the legislation. It was the first farm organization to endorse the McNary‚ÄìHaugen plan and also supported other groups working toward the plan's passage and paid the costs of sending its president, Charles E. Hearst, to Washington on extended lobbying trips. Though the legislation ultimately failed, twice in Congress and twice by presidential veto, the adoption of the idea by mainstream farm organizations laid the groundwork for farmer support of New Deal farm policy, where they applauded Roosevelt's appointment of Peek and Johnson, authors of the McNary‚ÄìHaugen plan, as well as advocate Wallace Jr. to powerful positions, where they began large-scale subsidy programs.Kimberly K.

Prior to those posts he served as Minister of War in 1923. Political origin Carmona was a republican and a freemason, and was a quick adherent to the proclamation of the Portuguese First Republic on 5 October 1910. He was, however, never a sympathizer of the democratic form of government and ‚Äì as he would later confess in an interview to Ant√≥nio Ferro ‚Äì he only voted for the first time at the National Plebiscite of 1933. During the First Republic, he briefly served as War Minister in the government of Ant√≥nio Ginestal Machado in 1923. Unlike the popular marshal Gomes da Costa, Carmona had not seen action in World War I. Presidency √ìscar Carmona by Henrique Medina Carmona was very active in the 28th May coup d'√©tat of 1926 that overthrew the First Republic. The first Council President, commandant Jos√© Mendes Cabe√ßadas, a democratic sympathizer supported by the last republican president, Bernardino Machado, was succeeded in June by Manuel de Oliveira Gomes da Costa. Carmona, who had been the Minister for Foreign Affairs between 3 June and 6 July, was the leader of the most conservative and authoritarian wing of the military regime, which considered the more moderate Gomes da Costa a liability. On 9 July, he led a countercoup together with general Jo√£o Jos√© Sinel de Cordes, named himself President, and immediately assumed dictatorial powers. He was formally elected to the office in 1928, as the only candidate. In 1928 Carmona appointed Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar as Minister of Finance. Impressed by Salazar's charisma and qualities, Carmona nominated Salazar as Prime Minister in 1932, and largely turned over control of the government to him. In 1933, a new constitution officially established the \\"Estado Novo\\". On paper, the new document codified the dictatorial powers Carmona had exercised since 1928. However, in practice he was now little more than a figurehead; Salazar held the real power. On paper, the president's power to dismiss Salazar was the only check on his power. However, Carmona mostly allowed Salazar a free hand. He was reelected without opposition in 1935 and 1942 for seven-year terms. In 1935, he signed the law that forbade Freemasonry in Portugal reluctantly, due to his own Freemason past. Although the democratic opposition was allowed to contest elections after World War II, Carmona was not on friendly terms with it. When the opposition demanded that the elections be delayed in order to give them more time to organize, Carmona turned them down. However, there were widespread rumours that Carmona supported the failed military uprising in 1947, which was led by general Jos√© Marques Godinho to overthrow Salazar, under the condition that he would remain as President of the Republic. Probably to end these rumours, Carmona finally accepted the title of Marshal. In 1949, Carmona, 79 years old, sought his fourth term as president. For the first time, he actually faced an opponent in General Jos√© Norton de Matos. However, after the regime refused to allow Matos to actually run a campaign, he pulled out of the race on 12 February, handing Carmona another term. Carmona died two years later, in 1951, after 24 years as the President of the Republic. He was buried in the Church of Santa Engr√°cia, National Pantheon, in Lisbon. Personal life He was born to Alvaro Rosario Teixeira Carmona, a Portuguese Naval officer from Felgueiras, based in Brazil and part of the Portuguese Military Attache's staff in Brazil. In January 1914, Carmona married Maria do Carmo Ferreira da Silva (Chaves, 28 September 1878 ‚Äì 13 March 1956), daughter of Germano da Silva and wife Engr√°cia de Jesus. With this marriage he legitimized their three children. He is the grand-uncle of the former Mayor of Lisbon Carmona Rodrigues (2004‚Äì2007).

His narrative verse was highly popular in his lifetime. Life He was born Thomas Robert Edward McInnes in Dresden, Ontario. He moved to New Westminster with his family in 1874, and grew up there. His father, Thomas Robert McInnes, served in the Senate of Canada from 1881 to 1897, and as Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia from 1897 until 1900. MacInnes was educated at University College, Toronto, graduating with a B.A. from the University of Toronto in 1887.John W. Garvin, \\"Tom McInnes,\\" Canadian Poets (Toronto: McClelland, Goodchild & Stewart, 1916), 248, Web, May 25, 2011. He studied law at Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto, Ontario, and was called to the bar in 1893. McInnes served as secretary to the Bering Sea Claims Commission in 1896 and 1897, and for part of 1897 was a member of the Yukon special police and customs force at Skagway. He acted as private secretary to his father, the Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia, from 1898 until 1900 (when the elder McInnes was dismissed from the office). He was still spelling his surname \\"McInnes\\" as of 1916. MacInnes spent long periods in China, where he had business interests, between 1916 and 1927.Donald Stephens, \\"Tom MacInnes Biography,\\" Encyclopedia of Literature, 8275, JRank.org, Web, May 25, 2011.\\"Macinnes, Tom,\\" ABC Bookworld, Web, May 25, 2011. One source says that he \\"returned to Canada with a lifelong hatred of Communists and Chinese.\\" MacInnes wrote a series of articles on his Chinese experiences, published in 1926 in the Vancouver Morning Star and Vancouver Province, that became the basis of his 1927 book, Oriental Occupation of British Columbia. According to more than one sources, the book proposes that British Columbia adopt apartheid-like policies in dealing with what MacInnes perceived to be an undesirable influx of Chinese immigrants. Another source, though, calls Oriental Occupation... \\"a pamphlet,\\" says that MacInnes had \\"developed a sympathy for Orientals living in British Columbia,\\" and says that the pamphlet reflects his \\"views of British Columbia prejudice\\" against Orientals. In Vancouver, MacInnes joined the Canadian Union of Fascists. He became a leading activist in the fascist scene, founding the Nationalist League of Canada. Writing MacInnes's poetry was popular in Canada in the first half of the 20th century. He wrote \\"light, easy verse that dismissed smugness and respectability with unconcerned humour ... an amused detachment underlies his work, as though poetry were merely one form of expression, as good as any other.\\" He believed \\"that joy and delight, rather than the prevalent melancholic outpourings of the soul, were essential to poetry.\\" MacInnes can be compared to Robert Service, not least in the fact of their popularity in Canada at the time. Like Service in his Yukon and war poems, MacInnes, \\"was especially interested in examining man within a natural landscape, on the fringes of society.\\" Also like Service, \\"his rhythms are often forced and pedantic, his rhyme-schemes careless and rough.\\" In some ways MacInnes seems to have modeled his career on that of Service. His first published work, A Romance of the Lost (1908), is a long yarn in rhyme about the Klondike Gold Rush, in the manner of the poems in Service's 1907 breakthrough work, Songs of a Sourdough. In 1913 MacInnes released Rhymes of a Rounder, on the heels of Service's 1912 Rhymes of a Rolling Stone. Unlike Service, though, MacInnes \\"was intrigued with elaborate poetic forms, such as the villanelle,\\" and actually invented \\"a five-line stanza of his own he called the ‚Äòmirelle‚Äô.\\" Katherine Hale, reviewing Macinnes's first book in The Mail and Empire, pronounced that \\"the best poem is 'The Damozel of Doom,' an eerie, dreamlike, passionate piece, suggested by the teaching of old Tao, who believed that there are regions where dead souls may be awakened by desires so strong that they are drawn outward again to Earth, where, through finer desires, they again pass into Paradise. Then 'the peace of a thousand years may be theirs in Limbo'.... The coming of this desire, which shall ultimately free, or banish the soul to ages of 'utter vanishment' is depicted in 'The Damozel of Doom' ‚Äì a poem worthy of the genius of Poe.\\" John Garvin included three MacInnes poems, including \\"The Damozel of Doom,\\" in his 1916 anthology Canadian Poets, and wrote of MacInnes's poetry: \\"Originality, constructive imagination, felicitous fancy, and delightful humour (if sometimes grim), combined with philosophic subtlety, much experience of life, and skilled artistry, are the outstanding qualities of this poet, so little known to Canadian readers, so worthy of their appreciation.\\" In a 1933 talk, on Canadian poets who had become known in the early 20th century, Charles G.D. Roberts said: \\"Preeminent among these is Tom MacInnes, standing somewhat apart from the stream of our poetry, and tracing the inheritance of his very individual talent to Fran√ßois Villon and Edgar Allan Poe, with an occasional dash of Keats.\\"Charles G.D.

The modern bass saxophone is a transposing instrument pitched in B, an octave below the tenor saxophone. The bass saxophone is not a commonly used instrument, but it is heard on some 1920s jazz recordings; in free jazz; in saxophone choirs; and occasionally in concert bands. The instrument was first used in 1844, both by Hector Berlioz in an arrangement of his Chant sacre, and by Georges Kastner in his opera Le Dernier Roi de Juda. In the 1950s and 1960s it enjoyed a brief vogue in orchestrations for musical theater: Leonard Bernstein‚Äôs original score for West Side Story includes bass saxophone, as does Meredith Willson‚Äôs Music Man and Sandy Wilson‚Äôs The Boy Friend. Australian composer Percy Grainger and American composer Warren Benson have championed the use of the instrument in their music for concert band. Although bass saxophones in C were made for orchestral use, modern instruments are in B. This puts them a perfect fourth below the baritone and an octave lower than the tenor. Music is written in treble clef, just as for the other saxophones, with the pitches sounding two octaves and a major second lower than written. As with most other members of the saxophone family, the lowest written note is the B below the staff‚Äîsounding as a concert A in the first octave (~ 51.9 Hz). German wind instrument maker Benedikt Eppelsheim has made bass saxophones to low A, similarly to the extension in the baritone saxophone. This sounds as a concert G in the first octave (~ 49 Hz). Until the start of the 21st century, the largest existing member of the saxophone family was the rare contrabass, pitched in E, a perfect fifth lower than the bass. Inventor Adolphe Sax had a patent for a subcontrabass saxophone (or bourdon saxophone), but apparently never built a fully functioning instrument. In 1999, Benedikt Eppelsheim introduced the subcontrabass tubax, a modified saxophone pitched in B an octave below the bass saxophone. In jazz The bass saxophone enjoyed some measure of popularity in jazz combos and dance bands between World War I and World War II, primarily providing bass lines, although players occasionally took melodic solos. Notable players of this era include Billy Fowler, Coleman Hawkins, Otto Hardwicke (of the Duke Ellington orchestra), Adrian Rollini (who was a pioneer bass sax solos in the 1920s into the 1930s), Min Leibrook, Spencer Clark, Charlie Ventura and Vern Brown of the Six Brown Brothers. The bass sax became more scarce in standard jazz band instrumentation during the mid-to-late 1920s. Sheet music of the period shows many bands photographed with a bass sax in their collection of instruments. It was sometimes played by the tuba or string bass player rather a member of the sax section. American bandleader Boyd Raeburn (1913‚Äì1966), who led an avant-garde big band in the 1940s, was a sometime bass saxophonist. In Britain, the leader of the Oscar Rabin Band also played it. Harry Gold, a member of Rabin's band, played bass saxophone in his own band, Pieces of Eight. American bandleader Stan Kenton's \\"Mellophonium Orchestra\\" (1960‚Äì1963) featured fourteen brass players and used a saxophone section of one alto, two tenors, baritone, and bass on Johnny Richards' compositions. Joel Kaye played baritone and bass saxophone in that band. The ensemble recorded several successful albums, winning two Grammys. The Lawrence Welk Band featured Bill Page soloing on bass sax on several broadcasts during the 1960s. Shorty Rogers's Swingin' Nutcracker (recorded for RCA Victor in 1960) featured a bass saxophone on four of the movements (played by Bill Hood). The 1970s traditional jazz band The Memphis Nighthawks built their sound around diminutive bass saxophonist Dave Feinman. Some revivalist bass saxophonists performing today in the 1920s‚Äì1930s style are Vince Giordano and Bert Brandsma, leader of the Dixieland Crackerjacks. Jazz players using the instrument in a more contemporary style include Roscoe Mitchell, Anthony Braxton, Peter Br√∂tzmann, J. D. Parran, Hamiet Bluiett, James Carter, Stefan Zeniuk, Michael Marcus (musician) Vinny Golia, Joseph Jarman, Brian Landrus, Urs Leimgruber, Tony Bevan, and Scott Robinson, although none of these players use it as their primary instrument. Jan Garbarek plays a bass sax on the 1973 album Red Lanta. In rock Bass saxophonists in rock include: *Angelo Moore of the American band Fishbone *Rodney Slater in the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band (1960s) *Ralph Carney of the avant-garde rock band Tin Huey (1970s) *John Linnell of They Might Be Giants (formed 1982) *Dana Colley of Morphine (formed 1989) *Kurt McGettrick in Frank Zappa's band in the late 1980s *Alto Reed, of Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band, often plays bass sax during live shows on songs without a prominent sax part. *Colin Stetson ‚Äì touring member of Arcade Fire and Bell Orchestre. He has performed and recorded with dozens of other artists, including Tom Waits, TV on the Radio, Bon Iver, Feist and LCD Soundsystem. *Blaise Garza ‚Äì touring member of Violent Femmes since 2004. *Kellie Everett ‚Äì member of The Hooten Hallers since 2014. In classical music The bass saxophone is sometimes used as an instrument in concert bands, typically in arrangements made before 1950. It is used most frequently in saxophone choirs, specifically those in the direct legacy of teacher- soloist Sigurd Rascher. It is rarely used in orchestral music, though several examples exist. The earliest extant work to employ it is William Henry Fry's \\"sacred symphony\\" Hagar In the Wilderness (1853), which also calls for soprano saxophone and was written for Louis-Antoine Jullien's orchestra during its American tour. It was also used by Richard Strauss in his Sinfonia Domestica, where included in the music are parts for four saxophones including a bass saxophone in C. Arnold Schoenberg wrote for the bass sax in his one-act opera Von Heute auf Morgen, and Karlheinz Stockhausen includes a part for it in the saxophone section of Lucifer's Dance, the third scene of Samstag aus Licht.

Biography Born in Pinner, Ellis was educated at the Harrow County School for Boys in Middlesex until he left aged 16, determined to be a writer. Two years later, his first book, Jiving to Gyp, a sequence of poems, was published. He performed his poetry on stage and TV to backing by Cliff Richard's original group, the Shadows, as well as Jimmy Page,{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVi6rMo2Ppo{cndate=May 2019}} and featured in a 1960 TV documentary, Living for Kicks, presented by Daniel Farson, which brought him to national attention and controversy through his remarks on teenage lifestyle, and as a spokesman of his generation. He wrote two books in 1959 and 1961 about touring with Cliff Richard and The Shadows, republished in 2014 by Tomahawk Press as a rock and roll memoir. In June 1960, he travelled to Liverpool, England to perform a poetry reading at Liverpool University. As he usually read his poetry with backing from jazz musicians, Ellis searched among the locals for suitable musicians to accompany him and met the young group comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Stuart Sutcliffe. Ellis bonded with Lennon in particular, both sharing an enthusiasm for the American Beat poets, and spent the week at 3 Gambier Terrace with Lennon, Sutcliffe, et al. Lennon saw Ellis as \\"the converging point of rock 'n' roll and literature\\". Ellis said of the meeting, \\"I was quite a star for them at that time because I had come up from London and that was a world they didn't really know about\\". According to Lennon in the International Times: \\"The first dope, from a Benzedrine inhaler, was given to the Beatles (John, George, Paul and Stuart) by an English cover version of Allen Ginsberg ‚Äî one Royston Ellis, known as 'beat poet' ... So, give the saint his due.\\" Ellis also claimed that he suggested the re-spelling of Beetles to Beatles. In 1961 his book survey of pop music at the dawn of the \\"Swinging Sixties\\", The Big Beat Scene was published. It was reprinted with additional comments in 2010 by Music Mentor Press. Ellis's novel, Myself For Fame (1964), about a fictional pop star, has a chapter set in Liverpool that seems to recount his experiences with The \\"Beetles\\" in 1960. Ellis is one of the people the song \\"Paperback Writer\\" was based on, quoting a comment he had made years earlier while in Liverpool, and was also present at a liaison between Lennon and \\"Polythene Pam\\" in Guernsey in 1963. In 1980, John Lennon said: > That was me, remembering a little event with a woman in Jersey, and a man > who was England's answer to Allen Ginsberg .. I met him when we were on tour > and he took me back to his apartment and I had a girl and he had one he > wanted me to meet. He said she dressed up in polythene, which she did. She > didn't wear jack boots and kilts, I just sort of elaborated. Perverted sex > in a polythene bag. Just looking for something to write about.\\" At 20, Ellis retired from the teenage beatnik and rock and roll scene and left England permanently for a life of travel that took him to East Berlin and Moscow, where he read his poetry on stage with the Russian poet Yevgeni Yevtushenko. Then, via Guernsey where he became a registered ferry boat engineer, he sailed to the Canary Islands, and acted as an Arab with Cliff Richard in the movie Wonderful Life. He stayed in Las Palmas for three years, becoming the editor of the islands' English language newspaper, The Canary Islands Sun, and wrote three novels. He hiked around West Africa, then landed up in the British Virgin Islands before settling, in 1966, in Dominica where he wrote the best-selling Bondmaster series of historical novels as Richard Tresillian; as well as becoming President of the Dominica Cricket Association, a member of the MCC and of the Windward Islands Cricket Board of Control, and a Life Fellow of the Royal Commonwealth Society. In 1979, after his hillside log cabin in Dominica was blown down by Hurricane David, he moved to Sri Lanka where he lives in a colonial cottage overlooking the Indian Ocean. The author of over 60 published books (guides, novels, biographies and volumes of poetry) he also writes travel features for inflight, international and Sri Lankan magazines. A collection of his beat poetry called Gone Man Squared, was published by in the United States by Kicks Books, an associate of Norton Records in 2013. A selection of his oeuvre was being published by Kicks Book for Kindle as ebooks during 2014. For his literary achievements Royston Ellis was awarded the title Duke Gypino y Tintinabulation de Redonda by the purported king of Redonda.

In 1892, John Froelich developed the first stable gasoline/petrol-powered tractor with forward and reverse gears. John Froelich attended school in Galena, Illinois, and at the College of Iowa. There he learned a lot about machinery. After college, he decided he would build the very first gasoline-powered tractor to go both forward and reverse. Designed by his blacksmith Will Mann and himself, Froelich was able to build a 16-horsepower (12 kW) tractor that could go both forward and backward by the year 1892. After completing the tractor, Froelich and Mann brought it to Langford, South Dakota, where they would connect it to a J.I. Case threshing machine, and thresh 72,000 bushels in 52 days. Around 1895, he left Froelich, Iowa, and settled in Marshalltown, Iowa, then moved to St. Paul, Minnesota. He later developed a new type of clothes-washing machine he named the Froelich Neostyle Washer.

Based in Waterloo, Iowa, the company was created by John Froelich and a group of Iowa businessmen in 1893, and was originally named the Waterloo Gasoline Traction Engine Company. In 1892, Froelich had invented the first practical gasoline-powered tractor, and the new company was given the opportunity to manufacture and sell the tractor Froelich designed. The tractor was not successful commercially, and of the four tractors built by the company only two were purchased, and these were later returned to the company by unsatisfied customers. In 1895, the company was sold to John W. Miller and renamed the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company. Miller decided to stop producing tractors and instead focus on building plain gasoline engines. Background Following several years of research and development, the company once again began to manufacture tractors in 1911, but none would sell well until 1913, when twenty ‚ÄúWaterloo Boy‚Äù tractors were produced. In 1914 the company introduced the Model R Waterloo Boy. This tractor proved immensely popular, and over eight thousand were sold before the line was discontinued in 1923. The company also had great success with the Model N, which was introduced in late 1916. Despite the company's name, both the Model R and Model N burned kerosene for fuel. History of Waterloo Gasoline Traction Engine Company By this time, several other companies had begun to build and sell tractors, but the Waterloo Boy was easily one of the most popular. In 1918, Deere & Company, a farm equipment company based in Moline, Illinois purchased the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company for $2,100,000. Deere & Company had been anxious to enter the growing tractor market, but its own initial designs had proved unsuccessful. Executives at Deere & Company decided to purchase the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Co. because field tests indicated that the Waterloo Boy tractor had the best performance. After the sale was completed, the company became known as the John Deere Tractor Company, but tractors produced by the company continued to be sold under the Waterloo Boy name until 1923, when the John Deere Model D was introduced.

Eisenhower in 1960. The Formosa Resolution of 1955 was a joint resolution passed by the U.S. Senate and signed by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower on January 29th, 1955 to counteract the threat of an invasion of Formosa by the People‚Äôs Republic of China (PRC). The resolution gave the U.S. President the authority ‚Äúto employ the Armed Forces of the United States as he deems necessary for the specific purpose of securing and protecting Formosa and the Pescadores against armed attack [by the Communists]‚Äù. The resolution was formulated amid the Taiwan Strait Crisis (1954‚Äì1955), which was a brief period of armed conflict that involved incursions made by the Communist Party of China (CPC) on the islands in the Taiwan Strait controlled by the Kuomintang (KMT) led Republic of China (ROC). A latent response by the United Nations Security Council regarding these developments prompted U.S. President Eisenhower to request the resolution in January of 1955.  Background  = Early Sino-American Relations = July 3rd 1884 marked the beginning of Sino- American relations when the Treaty of Wanghai, the first treaty signed between the United States and Qing China, established a peaceful relationship between the two nations. Formosa and its nearby islands remained under Qing rule until ceded in full sovereignty to Japan in the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki following the 1884-1885 Sino-Japanese War. Half a century later Japan was on the losing side of the Second World War, and the Cairo Declaration of 1943 established that jurisdiction over the islands would be returned to China should Japan surrender. Fighting as allies in the Pacific War, the United States formally acknowledged China‚Äôs right to all territories stolen from China by the Japanese, including Formosa. In a statement of neutrality given by U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson in January 1950, the U.S. Government declared it was ‚Äúnot going to get involved militarily in any way on the Island‚Äù. = Deteriorating circumstances = In the early 1950s however, peaceful relations between the United States and the People‚Äôs Republic of China began to deteriorate. In the months succeeding the declaration of neutrality, the PRC seized all U.S. consular property in Beijing, signed the 1950 Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance with the Soviet Union, and began growing its forces at Chekiang and Fukien, opposite Formosa. These developments, along with the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, prompted the order of an American fleet to position itself in the Taiwan Strait to prevent a possible attack on Formosa by the PRC. The ROC had always been perceived by Western powers as China‚Äôs only legitimate government and had thus held it‚Äôs seat at the United Nations since the organization's establishment. Following the Communist Party of China‚Äôs victory in the Chinese Civil War, the official establishment of the PRC raised questions of who China‚Äôs legal representative at the UN should be, and the U.S. vote against a seat for the PRC at the UN further intensified Sino-American tensions. In the early- to mid-1950s, the United States launched a trade embargo and began a policy of isolation and containment towards the PRC. Between 1952 and 1954, the Eisenhower administration increased its diplomatic, economic, and military aid to Taiwan, with economic aid valued at USD $527 million and military aid at USD $940 million. On September 3rd, 1954, the CPC began a heavy artillery bombing of the Chinese islands of Quemoy and Matsu, a smaller group of islands just off the mainland that ROC officials considered optimal for strategic positioning and reinvasion of the mainland. The PRC additionally held thirteen American prisoners and was threatening their execution, prompting further action by the Eisenhower administration. On December 2nd, 1954, the Sino- American Mutual Defense Treaty was signed between the U.S. and the ROC, in addition to other mutual security agreements in the Pacific.  Resolution  On January 6th 1955, President Eisenhower submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratify the Mutual Defense Treaty between the U.S. and the ROC, which outlined that an armed attack in the West Pacific area directed against Formosa and the Pescadores territories. When the Communist Party of China's forces seized control of Inchaing Island, located 210 miles north of Taiwan in mid-January 1955, calls for U.S. military intervention intensified as the CPC's continued attacks towards Quemoy and Matsu, extending armed skirmishes between the two governments as far as mainland Chinese ports. These developments prompted action from President Eisenhower. On January 24th, Eisenhower requested permission from Congress to use military force to defend Taiwan. By the next day, January 25th of 1955, the House approved a resolution requested by President Eisenhower that authorized the president to defend Formosa (Taiwan) and the Pescadores Islands by a vote of 410-3 in the House of Representatives. On January 28th, 1955, the Senate approved the resolution. On the same day the U.S. Senate approved this resolution, the Formosa problem had finally gained the attention of the U.N. Security Council. However, due to the PRC's refusal to join the discussion, the issue was effectively dropped from the agenda of the U.N. Regardless, with the approval of the House and the Senate, President Eisenhower moved forward by signing the Resolution on January 29th, 1955. The U.S. officially adopted the Formosa Resolution, a purported mechanism to prevent another crisis in the Taiwan Strait, as was experienced in the First Taiwan Strait Crisis (1954‚Äì1955). The Resolution empowered President Eisenhower to fully defend Formosa by granting him the authority to employ U.S. armed forces in the Taiwan Strait. While the Resolution authorized the U.S. president to use force to defend Formosa, it did not explicitly express an overt support for the ROC's government. The Resolution was an attempt to prevent further military conflict between the People‚Äôs Republic of China and the Republic of China without explicitly siding with Formosa.  Aftermath  = Immediate aftermath = The Joint Resolution did not resolve the Taiwan Strait Crisis, nor did it alleviate the hostility between the PRC and the ROC. Instead, the Resolution broadened the scope of the Mutual Defense Treaty by extending U.S. commitments to defend from PRC incursions of the offshore islands, in addition to Taiwan. As the crisis continued into early spring, U.S. officials warned publicly of the potential use of nuclear weapons when in March of 1955, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles called for stronger U.S. intervention. Tensions were temporarily alleviated in April 1955 when the PRC announced that they were prepared to negotiate on Taiwan and ceased bombardment of Quemoy and Matsu. In May the PRC officially halted its shelling and agreed to a negotiated truce. On September 12th, 1955, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consulted President Eisenhower, suggesting nuclear weapons should be used against the PRC if it launched a full-scale invasion of Taiwan. Making certain that Beijing was aware of this, the Eisenhower administration reached a temporary truce with the PRC until the conflict was revived when Taiwan began military reinforcement of the two islands. By 1957, the United States provided Taiwan with missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. When the second Quemoy crisis broke in 1958, which involved another deployment of U.S. air and naval forces, President Eisenhower threatened to use nuclear weapons once again. = The 1970s = Over a decade after the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, the U.S. broke their relations with the ROC when the U.S. abrogated the mutual security pact and withdrew U.S. forces and military installations from Taiwan in January 1970. The year 1971 marked the beginning of positive relations between the U.S. and the PRC. These positive relations formulated in Ping-Pong Diplomacy, when the Chinese ping- pong team invited members of the U.S. team to the People‚Äôs Republic of China on April 6, 1971. The U.S. players, as well as the Journalists accompanying them, were among the first Americans allowed to enter the PRC since 1949. In July of the same year, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger made a secret trip to China. Following the secret trip, the United Nations began to recognize the PRC and endowed them the permanent Security Council seat, effectively removing the Republic of China who had held the seat since 1945. Relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States continued to improve when in February of 1972, U.S. President Richard Nixon spent eight days in the PRC. During his visit, Nixon met with Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the PRC, and signed the Shanghai Communiqu√© with Premier Zhou Enlai. The communiqu√© set the stage for improved Sino-American relations by allowing People's Republic of China and the United States to discuss sensitive issues, particularly Taiwan. However, normalization of relations between the two countries made slow progress throughout the decade. By 1979, U.S. President Jimmy Carter recognized the legitimacy of the People‚Äôs Republic of China. In doing so, the U.S. acknowledged mainland China's One China principle and severed their ties with Taiwan. However by April, Congress rekindled their relations with Taiwan with the approval of the Taiwan Relations Act, which allowed the continuation of commercial and cultural relations between the U.S. and Taiwan as well as requirement of the U.S. to provide Taiwan with defensive arms. The act also did not officially violate the One-China policy. The Carter Administration's approval of the act neutrally positioned the U.S. in the Taiwan Pacific strait as the act restored U.S. relations with Taiwan while maintaining its recognition of the People's Republic of China as the legitimate representative of China. = The 1980s = In the 1980s, the U.S. President Ronald Reagan and his administration issued the ‚ÄúSix Assurances‚Äù to Taiwan. The \\"Six Assurances\\" included pledges by the U.S. to honour the Taiwan Relations Act, to not intervene in ongoing disputes between Taiwan and China, and to not terminate arms sales to Taiwan. By August 1982, the Reagan administration signed the third joint communiqu√© agreement with the PRC's government. The signing of this agreement effectively normalized relations between the U.S. and China, and reiterates the U.S.' allegiance to the One China policy. President Reagan had voiced support for stronger ties with Taiwan, however, due to fears of Soviet expansion in the Cold War era, President Reagan's administration was pressured to strengthen ties with China. As such, by June of 1984, President Reagan's administration permitted the sale of U.S. military equipment to Beijing. = The 1990s = Despite the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1996, which involved Chinese missile tests in the waters near Taiwan, Taiwan held their first free presidential vote in 1996. These missile tests were meant to sway Taiwanese voters to vote against the pro-independence candidate, which was the Nationalist Party leader, Lee Teng-hui. Ultimately, Teng-hui won the election by a large margin in March 1996. = The 21st Century = By the 2010s, the U.S. had recognized the PRC's China as the one and only China for decades. However, when Donald J. Trump won the U.S. presidential election in 2016, Trump broke the U.S. code of conduct towards China when he spoke with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen in a telephone call. This rose questions over the U.S.' commitment to its One-China policy. President Trump attempted to alleviate these doubts during a call on February 9th, 2017 with China's paramount leader Xi Jinping, in which he restated he would honor the One China policy. Despite honoring this policy, the U.S. still maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan, including the provisions of defense aid.

Front right is Telford Taylor (Chief Counsel). Across the table from him is Clark Denny (Chief Trial Counsel). Immediately to Taylor's right is Henry T. King (Assistant Counsel). Henry T. King Jr. (born May 27, 1919, Meriden, Connecticut, died May 9, 2009 Cleveland, Ohio) was an attorney who served as a U.S. Prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials in 1946-47. Late in his career, he became a law professor and an activist, writer, and lecturer working on international law and war crimes; David M. Crane has described King as \\"the George Washington of modern international law\\". Life and work King received his B.A. degree in 1941 from Yale College, and his LL.B. in 1943 from Yale Law School (1943). A heart murmur excluded him from military service during World War II. After practicing law for several years with the firm Milbank, Tweed & Hope, King became one of the United States prosecutors at the Nuremberg Trials, serving from 1946 to 1947. He was initially assigned to the prosecution of the German General Staff and the High Command, preparing cases against Walther von Brauchitsch, Heinz Guderian, and Erhard Milch for trial before Nuremberg Military Tribunals. Guderian was never tried, and von Brauchitsch died while awaiting trial. The Milch Trial convicted Milch on two of three counts, and he was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. King also worked on the Ministries Case and the Justice Case. Transcript of remarks made on November 17, 1995 during \\"Nuremberg and the Rule of Law: A Fifty-Year Verdict,\\" a conference held at The Judge Advocate General's School, United States Army, Charlottesville, Virginia, November 17‚Äì18, 1995. Following his service at Nuremberg, King had a long career as counsel for several corporations, including the TRW Corporation, from which he retired in 1981. In the 1990s, King was a member of the American Bar Association Task Force on War Crimes in the former Yugoslavia. He subsequently influenced the charter of the International Criminal Court. When delegates from 131 nations established the criminal court in 1998, they did not initially include initiating wars of aggression as a war crime. With Whitney Harris and Benjamin Ferencz, two of the other prosecutors from Nuremberg, King traveled to the convention in Rome to successfully lobby for the court's jurisdiction over the instigators of such wars. Michael Scharf described their role in Rome: \\"They used their moral authority; they were persistent, and ultimately the delegates included a reference to the crime of war of aggression in the court's statute.\\" As a part of preparing for the trial of Erhard Milch in 1946, King interviewed Albert Speer, one of the defendants who had been prosecuted at Nuremberg and convicted by the International Military Tribunal (the trial of the major war criminals). They later became friends. In 1997 King published a book with Bettina Elles, The Two Worlds of Albert Speer: Reflections of a Nuremberg Prosecutor.King, Henry T. and Elles, Bettina (1997). The Two Worlds of Albert Speer: Reflections of a Nuremberg Prosecutor, Lanham (US-MA), University Press of America 1997. . King wrote there that, \\"In a technological world, the magic concoction for evil consists of blind technocrats such as Speer led by an evil and aggressive leader such as Hitler.\\" King wrote more than 60 journal articles. From the mid-1980s until his death, King was a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, where he also served as the U.S. Director of the Canada-United States Law Institute. King also was a senior advisor to the Robert H. Jackson Center in Jamestown, New York; Jackson was the chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials. King was interviewed for the 2006 BBC docudrama Nuremberg: Nazis on Trial. King was married for fifty years to the former Betty May Scranton. The couple had three children: Suzanne Wagner, Henry T King III, who died in 1993, and Dave King, a novelist.  Honors  In 2002, The University of Pittsburgh School of Law named King a Fellow honoris causa of the Center for International Legal Education. Also in 2002, King was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Laws by the University of Western Ontario. Mr. King was a guest of the government of The Netherlands on March 11, 2003, for the inauguration of the International Criminal Court at The Hague.

He was unrelated to the blues musician Robert Johnson. Early life Johnson was born near Terry, Mississippi, and in about 1910 moved to Crystal Springs, where he lived for most of his life. He learned to play the guitar and, by 1914, was supplementing his income by playing at local parties with his brothers Major and LeDell. In 1916 Johnson married and moved to Webb Jennings' plantation near Drew, Mississippi, close to the Dockery Plantation. There he met other musicians, including Charlie Patton and Willie Brown.\\"Tommy Johnson - Delta School\\". Career By 1920, Johnson was an itinerant musician based in Crystal Springs but traveling widely around the South, sometimes accompanied by Papa Charlie McCoy. In 1928, he made his first recordings, with McCoy, for Victor Records, including \\"Canned Heat Blues\\", in which he sang of drinking methanol from the cooking fuel Sterno. The song features the refrain \\"canned heat, mama, sure, Lord, killing me.\\" The blues group Canned Heat took their name from this song. Johnson's \\"Big Road Blues\\" inspired Canned Heat's song \\"On the Road Again\\". A significantly different version of the song appears as \\"Canned Heat\\" on the album Big Road Blues by K. C. Douglas. Johnson recorded two further sessions, for Victor in August 1928 and for Paramount Records in December 1929. He did not record again, mistakenly believing that he had signed away his right to record. Some suggest he had been intentionally given this misimpression by people at Paramount Records. This resulted in a legal settlement with the Mississippi Sheiks, who had used the melody of Johnson's \\"Big Road Blues\\" in their successful \\"Stop and Listen\\". Johnson was party to the copyright settlement but was too drunk at the time to understand what he had signed.Evans, David (1971). Tommy Johnson. Studio Vista, p. 68. , Johnson's recordings established him as the premier Delta blues vocalist of his day, with a powerful voice that could go from a growl to a falsetto. He was an accomplished guitarist. He also performed tricks with his guitar, playing it between his legs and behind his head and throwing it in the air while playing. His style influenced later blues singers, such as Robert Nighthawk and Howlin' Wolf (whose song \\"I Asked for Water [She Brought Me Gasoline]\\" was based on Johnson's \\"Cool Drink of Water Blues\\"), and the country singer Hank Williams. Johnson was a talented composer, blending fragments of folk poetry and personalized lyrics into set guitar accompaniments to craft striking blues compositions such as \\"Maggie Campbell\\".Barlow, William (1989). \\"Looking Up at Down\\": The Emergence of Blues Culture. Temple University Press, p. 42. . To enhance his fame, Johnson cultivated a sinister persona. According to his brother LeDell, he claimed to have sold his soul to the devil at a crossroads in exchange for his mastery of the guitar.Evans, David (1971). Tommy Johnson. Studio Vista, p. 22. . This story was later also associated with Robert Johnson, to whom Tommy Johnson was unrelated. Johnson remained a popular performer in the Jackson area through the 1930s and 1940s, sometimes performing with Ishman Bracey. He influenced other performers, partly because he was willing to teach his style and his repertoire. His influence on local traditions is described by David Evans in the books Tommy Johnson (1971) and Big Road Blues: Tradition and Creativity in the Folk Blues (1982).Evans, David (1982). Big Road Blues: Tradition and Creativity in the Folk Blues. Da Capo. . Death Johnson died of a heart attack after playing at a local party in 1956. He is buried in the Warm Springs Methodist Church Cemetery, outside Crystal Springs, Mississippi. In April, 2000, Johnson family members gave permission for a headstone to be placed on Johnson's grave organized through the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund, a Mississippi nonprofit corporation active in historic African American cemetery preservation since 1989. Underwriting for the memorial was obtained through the support of blues musician Bonnie Raitt. The large granite memorial engraved with Johnson's portrait and including several of Johnson's best known songs, added at the family's request, was unveiled in October, 2001 in Crystal Springs, but was not placed on Johnson's actual grave for another 10 years however, because of a dispute between Johnson's family (led by his niece, Vera Johnson Collins), the owners of farm property encircling the cemetery, and the Copiah County Board of Supervisors over a deteriorated road that led to the burial site. The dispute was resolved in October 2012 thanks in large part to research work done by University of Mississippi researcher T.D.Moore. It was finally announced that the headstone would be erected on October 26 of that year. The headstone had been on public display in the Crystal Springs Public Library since being unveiled on October 20, 2001. On the night of Saturday, February 2, 2013, the headstone fell and was damaged. It is a matter of dispute whether it fell because it was inadequately secured or because it was pushed over or deliberately smashed. The Tommy Johnson Blues Festival is held annually in Crystal Springs on the third weekend in October. The inaugural festival was held in Jackson and Crystal Springs in 2006. In fiction In the film O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), a character named Tommy Johnson, played by Chris Thomas King, describes selling his soul to the devil to play guitar. The Tommy Johnson character in the film plays a number of songs originally recorded by the blues musician Skip James and accompanies the Soggy Bottom Boys, a band consisting of the film's three main protagonists plus Johnson, on \\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\". The story of Johnson's selling his soul to the devil was first told by his brother, LaDell Johnson, and reported by David Evans in his 1971 biography of Johnson. This legend was subsequently attributed to the blues musician Robert Johnson.

Extraction is usually from a solid matrix, but can also be from liquids. SFE can be used as a sample preparation step for analytical purposes, or on a larger scale to either strip unwanted material from a product (e.g. decaffeination) or collect a desired product (e.g. essential oils). These essential oils can include limonene and other straight solvents. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most used supercritical fluid, sometimes modified by co-solvents such as ethanol or methanol. Extraction conditions for supercritical carbon dioxide are above the critical temperature of 31 ¬∞C and critical pressure of 74 bar. Addition of modifiers may slightly alter this. The discussion below will mainly refer to extraction with CO2, except where specified. Advantages =Selectivity= The properties of the supercritical fluid can be altered by varying the pressure and temperature, allowing selective extraction. For example, volatile oils can be extracted from a plant with low pressures (100 bar), whereas liquid extraction would also remove lipids. Lipids can be removed using pure CO2 at higher pressures, and then phospholipids can be removed by adding ethanol to the solvent. The same principle can be used to extract polyphenols and unsaturated fatty acids separately from wine wastes. =Speed= Extraction is a diffusion-based process, in which the solvent is required to diffuse into the matrix and the extracted material to diffuse out of the matrix into the solvent. Diffusivities are much faster in supercritical fluids than in liquids, and therefore extraction can occur faster. In addition, due to the lack of surface tension and negligible viscosities compared to liquids, the solvent can penetrate more into the matrix inaccessible to liquids. An extraction using an organic liquid may take several hours, whereas supercritical fluid extraction can be completed in 10 to 60 minutes. Limitations The requirement for high pressures increases the cost compared to conventional liquid extraction, so SFE will only be used where there are significant advantages. Carbon dioxide itself is non-polar, and has somewhat limited dissolving power, so cannot always be used as a solvent on its own, particularly for polar solutes. The use of modifiers increases the range of materials which can be extracted. Food grade modifiers such as ethanol can often be used, and can also help in the collection of the extracted material, but reduces some of the benefits of using a solvent which is gaseous at room temperature. Procedure The system must contain a pump for the CO2, a pressure cell to contain the sample, a means of maintaining pressure in the system and a collecting vessel. The liquid is pumped to a heating zone, where it is heated to supercritical conditions. It then passes into the extraction vessel, where it rapidly diffuses into the solid matrix and dissolves the material to be extracted. The dissolved material is swept from the extraction cell into a separator at lower pressure, and the extracted material settles out. The CO2 can then be cooled, re-compressed and recycled, or discharged to atmosphere. Figure 1. Schematic diagram of SFE apparatus =Pumps= Carbon dioxide () is usually pumped as a liquid, usually below 5 ¬∞C (41 ¬∞F) and a pressure of about 50 bar. The solvent is pumped as a liquid as it is then almost incompressible; if it were pumped as a supercritical fluid, much of the pump stroke would be \\"used up\\" in compressing the fluid, rather than pumping it. For small scale extractions (up to a few grams / minute), reciprocating pumps or syringe pumps are often used. For larger scale extractions, diaphragm pumps are most common. The pump heads will usually require cooling, and the CO2 will also be cooled before entering the pump. =Pressure vessels= Pressure vessels can range from simple tubing to more sophisticated purpose built vessels with quick release fittings. The pressure requirement is at least 74 bar, and most extractions are conducted at under 350 bar. However, sometimes higher pressures will be needed, such as extraction of vegetable oils, where pressures of 800 bar are sometimes required for complete miscibility of the two phases. The vessel must be equipped with a means of heating. It can be placed inside an oven for small vessels, or an oil or electrically heated jacket for larger vessels. Care must be taken if rubber seals are used on the vessel, as the supercritical carbon dioxide may dissolve in the rubber, causing swelling, and the rubber will rupture on depressurization. =Pressure maintenance= The pressure in the system must be maintained from the pump right through the pressure vessel. In smaller systems (up to about 10 mL / min) a simple restrictor can be used. This can be either a capillary tube cut to length, or a needle valve which can be adjusted to maintain pressure at different flow rates. In larger systems a back pressure regulator will be used, which maintains pressure upstream of the regulator by means of a spring, compressed air, or electronically driven valve. Whichever is used, heating must be supplied, as the adiabatic expansion of the CO2 results in significant cooling. This is problematic if water or other extracted material is present in the sample, as this may freeze in the restrictor or valve and cause blockages. =Collection= The supercritical solvent is passed into a vessel at lower pressure than the extraction vessel. The density, and hence dissolving power, of supercritical fluids varies sharply with pressure, and hence the solubility in the lower density CO2 is much lower, and the material precipitates for collection. It is possible to fractionate the dissolved material using a series of vessels at reducing pressure. The CO2 can be recycled or depressurized to atmospheric pressure and vented. For analytical SFE, the pressure is usually dropped to atmospheric, and the now gaseous carbon dioxide bubbled through a solvent to trap the precipitated components. =Heating and cooling= This is an important aspect. The fluid is cooled before pumping to maintain liquid conditions, then heated after pressurization. As the fluid is expanded into the separator, heat must be provided to prevent excessive cooling. For small scale extractions, such as for analytical purposes, it is usually sufficient to pre-heat the fluid in a length of tubing inside the oven containing the extraction cell. The restrictor can be electrically heated, or even heated with a hairdryer. For larger systems, the energy required during each stage of the process can be calculated using the thermodynamic properties of the supercritical fluid. Simple model of SFE Figure 2. Concentration profiles during a typical SFE extraction There are two essential steps to SFE, transport (by diffusion or otherwise) of the solid particles to the surface, and dissolution in the supercritical fluid. Other factors, such as diffusion into the particle by the SF and reversible release such as desorption from an active site are sometimes significant, but not dealt with in detail here. Figure 2 shows the stages during extraction from a spherical particle where at the start of the extraction the level of extractant is equal across the whole sphere (Fig. 2a). As extraction commences, material is initially extracted from the edge of the sphere, and the concentration in the center is unchanged (Fig 2b). As the extraction progresses, the concentration in the center of the sphere drops as the extractant diffuses towards the edge of the sphere (Figure 2c). Figure 3. Concentration profiles for (a) diffusion limited and (b) solubility limited extraction The relative rates of diffusion and dissolution are illustrated by two extreme cases in Figure 3. Figure 3a shows a case where dissolution is fast relative to diffusion. The material is carried away from the edge faster than it can diffuse from the center, so the concentration at the edge drops to zero. The material is carried away as fast as it arrives at the surface, and the extraction is completely diffusion limited. Here the rate of extraction can be increased by increasing diffusion rate, for example raising the temperature, but not by increasing the flow rate of the solvent. Figure 3b shows a case where solubility is low relative to diffusion. The extractant is able to diffuse to the edge faster than it can be carried away by the solvent, and the concentration profile is flat. In this case, the extraction rate can be increased by increasing the rate of dissolution, for example by increasing flow rate of the solvent. Figure 4. Extraction Profile for Different Types of Extraction The extraction curve of % recovery against time can be used to elucidate the type of extraction occurring. Figure 4(a) shows a typical diffusion controlled curve. The extraction is initially rapid, until the concentration at the surface drops to zero, and the rate then becomes much slower. The % extracted eventually approaches 100%. Figure 4(b) shows a curve for a solubility limited extraction. The extraction rate is almost constant, and only flattens off towards the end of the extraction. Figure 4(c) shows a curve where there are significant matrix effects, where there is some sort of reversible interaction with the matrix, such as desorption from an active site. The recovery flattens off, and if the 100% value is not known, then it is hard to tell that extraction is less than complete. Optimization The optimum will depend on the purpose of the extraction. For an analytical extraction to determine, say, antioxidant content of a polymer, then the essential factors are complete extraction in the shortest time. However, for production of an essential oil extract from a plant, then quantity of CO2 used will be a significant cost, and \\"complete\\" extraction not required, a yield of 70 - 80% perhaps being sufficient to provide economic returns. In another case, the selectivity may be more important, and a reduced rate of extraction will be preferable if it provides greater discrimination. Therefore, few comments can be made which are universally applicable. However, some general principles are outlined below. =Maximizing diffusion= This can be achieved by increasing the temperature, swelling the matrix, or reducing the particle size. Matrix swelling can sometimes be increased by increasing the pressure of the solvent, and by adding modifiers to the solvent. Some polymers and elastomers in particular are swelled dramatically by CO2, with diffusion being increased by several orders of magnitude in some cases. =Maximizing solubility= Generally, higher pressure will increase solubility. The effect of temperature is less certain, as close to the critical point, increasing the temperature causes decreases in density, and hence dissolving power. At pressures well above the critical pressure, solubility is likely to increase with temperature. Addition of low levels of modifiers (sometimes called entrainers), such as methanol and ethanol, can also significantly increase solubility, particularly of more polar compounds. =Optimizing flow rate= The flow rate of supercritical carbon dioxide should be measured in terms of mass flow rather than by volume because the density of the changes according to the temperature both before entering the pump heads and during compression. Coriolis flow meters are best used to achieve such flow confirmation. To maximize the rate of extraction, the flow rate should be high enough for the extraction to be completely diffusion limited (but this will be very wasteful of solvent). However, to minimize the amount of solvent used, the extraction should be completely solubility limited (which will take a very long time). Flow rate must therefore be determined depending on the competing factors of time and solvent costs, and also capital costs of pumps, heaters and heat exchangers. The optimum flow rate will probably be somewhere in the region where both solubility and diffusion are significant factors.

Life She was born in 1828 to John Parker and Henrietta Borrows. Her father died after a horse riding accident when she was eleven and she was brought up in London. She came from a distinguished Essex family, and married the art and literary critic Alexander Gilchrist in 1851 after a two year engagement. Five years later, in Chelsea, west London, the couple became next-door neighbours of Thomas Carlyle and Jane Welsh Carlyle, both of them notable writers. The Gilchrists' marriage, one of intellectual equals, was cut short when Alexander died of scarlet fever in 1861. Her daughter Beatrice had originally caught the disease and then her son, Percy, suffered it as his sister recovered. Her husband caught the disease from his son. She was left with their four children: Percy, Beatrice, Herbert, and Grace. One of the reasons for the family's move to Philadelphia in 1876 was Beatrice's desire to attend medical school. Beatrice eventually became a physician in Edinburgh, but she killed herself shortly thereafter. Percy had a successful career developing a new and economic way of making steel and Herbert was a minor painter. Work After her husband's death in 1861, Anne completed his Life of Blake and was an active contributor to magazines. She is perhaps best known for developing a deep attachment to Walt Whitman when she read Leaves of Grass in 1869, and for writing the first great criticism of that work, A Woman's Estimate of Walt Whitman; their correspondence was initiated through William Michael Rossetti. When she eventually travelled to Philadelphia, in 1876, she met Whitman and they formed a lasting friendship. She moved to New England in 1878, but returned to England the following year. In 1883, she published a biography of the writer Mary Lamb. References Further reading * Alcaro, Marion Walker. (1991). Walt Whitman's Mrs. G: A Biography of Anne Gilchrist. . * Cavitch, Max.

Originally published in April 1919 in the journal New Youth (Êñ∞ÈùíÂπ¥), it was later included in his first collection of short stories, Call to Arms (Âê∂Âñä). The story's narrator reminisces about Kong Yiji, an alcoholic failed scholar who frequented the tavern where the narrator worked when he was a boy. The story expresses Lu Xun's rejection of Classical Chinese in favour of the written vernacular Chinese which he helped pioneer. It is one of Lu Xun's best known and most analysed works. Plot The narrator reminisces about the time twenty years ago when he worked as a waiter in a tavern in Luzhen (È≠ØÈéÆ), a fictional town where many of Lu Xun's stories are set. Working class men wore short coats and drank standing at the counter, whereas the richer customers who wore long gowns sat and ate inside. Kong Yiji was the only customer who wore a long gown and stood. Kong Yiji is a self-styled scholar who has failed to pass the xiucai examination but arrogantly fills his speech with muddled classical tags, refuses to perform menial work and steals to avoid starvation. He is treated with cruelty and contempt by the other customers, one of whom gave him the nickname \\"Kong Yiji\\" based on his real surname Kong and a meaningless sequence of characters from a children's elementary text. Although Kong Yiji is a thief, he makes a point of always settling his debts with the tavernkeeper. He tries to teach the narrator orthographic trivia, but the boy rejects him; when he ingratiates himself with the town's children, they laugh at him and cadge food. Later, Kong Yiji is caught stealing and beaten until his legs break. He drags himself to the tavern and orders some wine, after which he is not seen again and presumably dies as a result of his injuries. The tavernkeeper remembers Kong Yiji's unpaid bills for a while, but he is otherwise forgotten. Background Written before the May Fourth Movement, this piece is the second Vernacular Chinese story written by Lu Xun after writing A Madman's Diary. Some people believe that Lu Xun wrote this story to express the unhappiness of the university students at that time. Others have suggested that Lu Xun wrote the story to explain the problems with China's feudal society, where people could waste their entire lives trying to pass meaningless examinations and where people were selfish and completely indifferent to the plight of others. Lu Xun rejected the traditional Chinese system of education geared towards the imperial examinations, and of the cruelty of Chinese society.

After distrustful farmers tried and failed to repeal the testing program, they gathered in numbers to block tests from taking place. Such confrontations sometimes led to violence. Subsequently, the Republican Governor Dan Turner of Iowa declared martial law and called out Iowa National Guard troops to restore peace and to assist in capturing the ringleaders Jake Lenker and Paul Moore. The State of Iowa required the tests to reduce the frequency with which dairy cattle with tuberculosis would contaminate the milk supply and cause milk-drinking humans to contract the disease.George Mills, \\"Threw Rocks, Eggs In 'Cow War,'\\" Des Moines Register, 1971-09-22. An Iowa law passed in 1929 required all dairy and breeding cattle be tested by veterinarians. Any animal that showed signs of infection was to be destroyed. The owner was paid an indemnity. The program was financed by a property tax levy of up to 3 mills. The adoption of the testing program unfortunately coincided with the Great Depression. Farmers already impoverished by low prices for their milk and beef viewed the testing program as another threat to their livelihood. They claimed that the test was unreliable and caused abortions in cattle. They also asserted that the test lowered the quality of milk and reduced a cow's milk output. In February 1931, two years after the adoption of the testing law, an estimated one thousand farmers went by special train from Tipton, Iowa (in Cedar County, Iowa) to Iowa's Capitol in Des Moines. On arrival, they demanded that Iowa Legislature make the tests optional rather than mandatory. After the Legislature refused to act, farmers began to take things into their own hands. In rural areas of southeast Iowa, veterinarians attempting to test cattle were increasingly met by large groups of farmers mobilized to obstruct the tests. They were subjected to minor levels of violence, such as thrown eggs or mud, and kicks from farm wives. In areas where testing had been frustrated, Iowa officials responded by providing veterinarians with escorts from law officers. This came to a head on September 21, 1931 at the Jake Lenker farm south of Tipton.\\"State Moves in Test War: Hints of Militia Heard as Farmers Voice Opposition,\\" Muscatine Journal, 1931-09-21, at 1. Two veterinarians convoyed by 65 officers appeared at the farm. Barring the way were 400 farmers. Violence flared. The following day, Iowa Governor Dan Turner declared martial law and sent 31 Iowa National Guard units to Tipton. The effect of this show of force was dramatic. As Iowa historian George Mills explained decades later, \\"Objecting farmers gave in almost without exception to the show of force.\\" When all of the tests were completed (often under armed guard), the conflict also ended. Ultimately, Lenker and another leader of the revolt, Paul Moore, were arrested and convicted of criminal conspiracy, and sentenced to three-year terms in the Iowa State Pentitentiary in Fort Madison, Iowa. Each was paroled well before the end of his sentence. The Iowa Cow War had ended by 1935 .

Biography Daniel Webster Turner, named after the famed antebellum senator and orator, was born on a farm near Corning, Iowa. As a boy, he did farm chores and clerked at the general store owned by his father, a civil war veteran. Graduating from the Corning Academy in 1898, he enlisted in the Army and served in the Philippines during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. He boxed in the division championship fights and won, but suffered a broken nose that became a permanent facial feature. Returning from the war, he joined the National Guard and rose to the rank of major. In 1903, at age 26, he was elected to the Iowa Senate. His political activism and boxer‚Äôs nose led the press to dub him, ‚ÄúFighting Dan Turner.‚Äù As a representative of the progressive wing of the Republican Party during the era of ‚Äúprairie populism,‚Äù when the Midwest was a font of radicalism, Turner advocated for many reforms. In a 1912 address to the Republican State Convention, he defended the anti-trust law and called for direct election of U. S. senators, income and corporate taxes as more equitable than property taxes, and an end to corrupt leadership, saying, ‚ÄúWe must cleanse our party of complacent plutocrats and corpulent freebooters, masquerading as Republicans.‚ÄùAddress of Dan W. Turner as Temporary Chairman of Republican State Convention, Des Moines, Iowa, July 10, 1912. Elected to the Governorship in 1931, he attacked lobbyists in his inaugural address and demanded fair congressional districts, measures to promote child welfare, and establishing a state conservation commission: ‚ÄúThe professional lobbyist . . . should be ejected from the presence of honest men . . . . He is not interested in the well being of the people we represent.‚Äù ‚ÄúOur streams are rapidly degenerating into open sewers, receiving the waste drainage of private industry and municipalities. We must terminate this practice.‚ÄùCited in an editorial, \\"Iowa‚Äôs Courageous Reformer,\\" Des Moines Register, April 18, 1969. In a prelude to the Great Depression, the farming economy collapsed during the 1920s, with many related bank failures. Turner, as a \\"Son of the Wild Jackass\\" and one of four speakers at the Republican National Convention of 1928, urged the party to support farm relief.See ‚ÄúSons of the Wild Jackass,‚Äù Cedric B. Cowing, Populists, Plungers and Progressives: A Social History of Stock and Commodity Speculation 1890-1936 (Princeton University Press, 1965) pp. 127-154. ‚ÄúRight up to the 1929 precipice Senate progressives from the Midwest warned the public of the dangerous situation.‚Äù (p. 153) He traveled twice to Washington to unsuccessfully plead the same cause with President Hoover during the 1930s. =Governorship and Cow War= Turner played a decisive role in the Iowa Cow War of 1931. To keep people from contracting bovine tuberculosis, a State law mandated testing of dairy cows and destroying diseased animals. Farmers across Iowa responded with suspicion and hostility. When some banded together near Tipton, Iowa to prevent the tests from taking place and violence broke out, Turner as governor restored peace by calling out the Iowa National Guard. This act earned him the enmity of many farmers and may have contributed to his re-election defeat in 1932 by Democrat Clyde L. Herring, though this was the year of the Roosevelt-led Democratic sweep, when Republicans were removed from office nationwide. =Later years= Returning to the race for governor of Iowa in 1934, Turner was defeated a second time by Herring. He did not run for office again but remained active in politics. He supported fellow Republican Dwight Eisenhower in the presidential race of 1952, but turned against Eisenhower after a meeting with the President yielded disappointment on farm-related matters. In the election of 1956, he crossed party lines and supported Democrat Adlai Stevenson for president. Still advocating for farmers‚Äô interests at age 78, he was active in founding the National Farmers Organization, recalling Thomas Jefferson when he cited the ‚Äúyeoman farmer, who has been the bulwark of our nation.‚ÄùCited in the Iowa City Press Citizen, April 16, 1969. At the end of his life, remembering his part in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Turner was heard to say, ‚ÄúThey gave us the Springfield rifle. I wish I had never learned to shoot it. They said we were fighting for liberty, but it was cruel, it was cruel.‚ÄùIn conversation, 1968.

She also speculates on whether Perikles might have been responsible for the overall conception of the Parthenon's sculptural program, see note 3, p.17. The frieze consists of 378 figures and 245 animals. It was 160 meters (524 ft) in length when complete, as well as 1 meter in height, and it projects 5.6 cm forward at its maximum depth. It is composed of 114 blocks of an average 1.22 meters in length, depicting two parallel files in procession. It was a particular novelty of the Parthenon that the cella carries an Ionic frieze over the hexastyle pronaos rather than Doric metopes, as would have been expected of a Doric temple. Judging by the existence of regulae and guttae below the frieze on the east wall this was an innovation introduced late in the building process and replaced the ten metopes and triglyphs that might otherwise have been placed there.Neils, 2001, p.38 Alma-Tadema's 1868 'Phidias Showing the Frieze of the Parthenon to his Friends', reflecting contemporary reconstructions of the frieze's colour The marble was quarried from Mount Pentelicus and transported 19 km to the acropolis of Athens. A persistent question has been whether it was carved in situ.Neils, 2001, p.77, also note 8 for the historiography of the problem. Just below the moulding and above the tenia there is a channel 17 mm high that would have served to give access to the sculptor's chisel when finishing the heads or feet on the relief; this scamillus or guide strip is the best evidence there is that the blocks were carved on the wall. Additionally, on practical grounds it is easier to move a sculptor than a sculpture, and to use a crowbar to put them into place, potentially, could have chipped the edges.Neils, 2001, p.77 No information is recoverable on the workshop, but estimates range from three to 80 sculptors on the basis of style. However, American archeologist Jenifer Neils suggests nine, on the grounds that this would be the least number necessary to produce the work in the time given.Neils, 2001, p.87 It was finished with metal detailing and painted. No colour, however, survives, but perhaps the background was blue, judging by comparison with grave stelae and the paint remnants on the frieze of the Hephaisteion.Neils, 2001, p.88 \\"It is generally assumed that the background of the frieze was painted blue, on analogy with the blue background of other fifth-century relief sculptures, namely, grave stelae. Perhaps the closest comparison is with the Hephaisteion frieze, which according to several early travellers to Greece preserved traces of a blue background in addition to other paint‚Ä¶The Elusinian limestone used for the background of the Erechtheion frieze is also dark blue in colour. Thus, we can safely assume that at least the background of the Parthenon frieze was more or less as the nineteenth-century Dutch painter Alma-Tadema depicted it.\\" Possibly figures held objects that were also rendered in paint such as Poseidon‚Äôs trident and the laurel in Apollo‚Äôs hand.Neils, 2001, p.90 The many drill holes found in Hera‚Äôs and Apollo's heads indicate that a gilded bronze wreath would probably have crowned the deities.Neils, 2001, p.91 The system of numbering the frieze blocks dates back to Adolf Michaelis's 1871 work Der Parthenon, and since then Ian Jenkins has revised this scheme in the light of recent discoveries.Jenkins, 1994, pp.50‚Äì1Particularly the manuscript of Francis Vernon of 1675, describing the frieze prior to the Venetian bombardment which shed new light on the \\"Carrey drawings\\" of 1674, see Bowie, Thimme, 1971, and B. D. Meritt, The Epigraphic notes of Francis Vernon, in Commemorative Studies in Honor of Theodore Leslie Shear (Hesperia Suppl. 8, Princeton 1949) The convention, here preserved, is that blocks are numbered in Roman and figures in Arabic numerals, the figures are numbered left to right against the direction of the procession on the north and west and with it on the south. Description West frieze, XLVII, 132‚Äì136, British Museum The narrative of the frieze begins at the southwest corner where the procession appears to divide into two separate files. The first third of the west frieze is not part of the procession, but instead, seems to be the preparatory stages for the participants. The first figure here is a marshal dressing, W30, followed by several men preparing the horses W28‚Äì23 until figure W22 who, it has been suggested,Robertson, Frantz, 1975, notes to plate 9. may be engaged in the dokimasia, the tryout or enrollment of the knights.however Bugh, 1988 however, has argued that the scene is unrelated to the military and specific to the religious procession, see Neils, 2001, p.128 W24 is an ambiguous figure who might be either the protesting owner of a rejected horse or a keryx (herald) whose hand held part of an otherwise lost salpinx (trumpet), but either way this point marks the beginning of the procession proper.Neils, 2001, p.132 The following ranks W21‚Äì1 along with N75‚Äì136 and S1‚Äì61 are all of horsemen and constitute 46% of the whole frieze. They are divided into two lines of ten ranks ‚Äì the same number as that of the Attic tribes.The Athenian cavalry was organised by tribe of phylai and commanded by ten officers known as phlyarchs All figures are beardless youths with the exception of two, W8 and W15, who along with S2‚Äì7 wear Thracian dress of fur cap, a patterned cloak, and high boots; these have been identified by Martin Robertson as hipparchs.Robertson, Frantz, 1975, p.46 Next are the four-horse chariots, each with charioteer and armed passenger, there are ten on the south frieze and eleven on the north. Since these passengers are sometimes depicted as dismounting they may be taken to represent the apobatai, participants in the ceremonial race found in Attica and Boeotia.Kyle, 1993, see Neils, 2001, p.138 By N42 and S89 the equestrian parade is at an end, and the following 16 figures on the north and 18 on the south are taken to be the elders of Athens judging by their braided hair, an attribute of distinguished age in Classical art. Four of these figures raise their right hand in a clenched fist gesture suggestive of a pose associated with the thallophoroi (olive branch bearers) who were older men chosen in competition for their good looks alone. No drill holes, however, exist for any branch to be inserted in their hands. Next in line (S107‚Äì114, N20‚Äì28) are the musicians: four kithara (a variant of the lyre) and four aulos (flute) players. N16‚Äì19 and S115‚Äì118 (conjectured) perhaps, as hydriaphoroi, the water-vessel carriers, here men, rather than metic girls mentioned in the literature on the Panathenaia. N13‚Äì15, S119‚Äì121 are the skaphephoroi, the tray bearers of the honeycombs and cakes used to entice the sacrificial animals to the altar. N1‚Äì12, S122‚Äì149 are the four cows and four sheep on the north and ten cows on the south meant for sacrifice on the acropolis, presumably an abbreviated form of the hecatomb usually offered on this occasion ‚Äì there is an a-b-a rhythm of placid and restive cows.Neils, 2001, p.154 Weavers section of the frieze, East VII, 49‚Äì56, Louvre, (MR 825) As the files converge on the east frieze we encounter the first women celebrants E2‚Äì27, E50‚Äì51, E53‚Äì63. The priestesses carry the sacrificial instruments and paraphernalia including the phiale (phial or jug), oinochoai (wine jars), thymiaterion (incense burner), and in the case of E50‚Äì51, evidently they have just handed the marshal E49 a kanoun, making the girl the kanephoros.Roccos, 1999, pp.641‚Äì66. The next groups E18‚Äì23, E43‚Äì46, are problematic. Six on the left and four on the right, if one does not count two other figures who may or may not be marshals, then this group might be taken to be the ten eponymous heroes who gave their names to the ten tribes. Their proximity to the deities indicates their importance, but selecting differently, then nine of them may be the archons of the polis or athlothetai officials who managed the procession; there is insufficient iconographic evidence to determine which interpretation is correct. Interpretations of the figures varies. The twelve seated deities are taken to be the Olympians, they are one third taller than any other figure on the frieze and are arranged in two groups of six on diphroi (backless) stools, common forms of ancient furniture, with the exception of Zeus who is enthroned. Their backs are turned to what must be the culminating event of the procession E31‚Äì35; five figures (three children and two adults, and although badly corroded, the two children on the left appear to be girls bearing objects on their heads,Either baskets, Wesenberg, 1995, or stools, Boardman, 1999, pp.305‚Äì330 while a third, perhaps a boy,Brommer,1977, pp.269‚Äì70 may identify the existence of a temple boy of Athena in Athens, see also Harrison, The Web of History: A conservative reading of the Parthenon Frieze in Neils, 1996, p.204 assisting an adult who may be the archon basileus, in folding a piece of cloth. This frieze often is interpreted as the presentation of Athena‚Äôs peplos, perhaps by the arrhephoroi, but debate exists regarding who the figures represent more than what ritual is represented.While it is largely uncontroversial (pace Connelly) that this scene is the presentation of the peplos, since that was the purpose of the Panathenaic procession, the identification of these figures is not. It may be that the two girls, E 31-2, are the diphrophoroi, metic girls who carried the stools for the kanephoroi, but Neils, 2001, p.168 dismisses this argument since they evidently play a central role in the cult of Athena here. She also notes that the arrephoroi were involved in the weaving of the peplos, specifically warping the looms for it during the festival of Chalkeia nine months earlier. The figure E35 was identified as a girl by Stuart and Revett, an ascription repudiated by Adolf Michaelis in 1871. That this figure was a boy was the orthodox interpretation until Martin Robertson pointed out the presence of venus rings on her neck, Robertson, Frantz, 1975. See also Neils, 2001, p.169. Style Cavalcade south frieze, X XI, 26‚Äì28, British Museum The Parthenon frieze is the defining monument of the High Classical style of Attic sculpture.As Neils, 2001, p.95 notes, \\"for many it represents the epitome of the high Classical Style\\", however Cook, 1976, p.124 makes the useful qualification, \\"For the character of the High Classical Style it is easy to rely too much on the architectural sculpture of the Parthenon, since they form the only large body of original work of first-rate quality that has survived\\". It stands between the gradual eclipse of the Severe style, as witnessed on the Parthenon metopes,Ridgway, 1981, p.16, \\"it is certainly true that most of the South metopes... retain distinctive traits of the Severe style. This feature is best explained, however, in terms of lingering tradition, and it is quite possible that the various Fifth century styles developed in the process of carving, since highly advanced details can be noticed in whatever remains of some other metopes, or, for that matter, in some of the South series as well.\\" and the evolution of the Late Classical Rich style, exemplified by the Nike balustrade. What sources the designer of the frieze drew upon is difficult to gauge, certainly large scale narrative art was familiar to 5th-century Athenians as in the Stoa poikile painting by Polygnotos of Thasos. While there is an overall coherence to the work there are design differences on opposing sides of the frieze that has suggested to some scholars the possibility of more than one designer and a pattern of influence amongst them.Neils, 2001, p.70 There is greater nudity and frontally on the north than the south, the massing and distribution of figures is greatly different on the east than the more widely spaced west, and the east and north generally exhibit greater innovation. This evidence, along with the frequency with which Greek artists are thought to have collaborated, has led Jenifer Neils to hypothesize the existence of two designers working on the sculpture.Neils, 2001, p.71 This would admit the possibility of a later designer comparing and competing with the earlier, and so, explain the observable changes in composition. Geographical orientations also may have dictated what would be represented on one side versus another, i.e., Amazons to the west, and so forth. This artistic period is one of discovery of the expressive possibilities of the human body; there is a greater freedom in the poses and gestures, and an increased attention to anatomical verisimilitude, as may be observed in the ponderated stances of figures W9 and W4, who partially anticipate the Doryphoros of Polykleitos. There is a noticeable ease to the physiques of the frieze compared with the stiffness of the metopes along with an eye for such subtleties as knuckle joints, veins, and the careful articulation of musculature. One important innovation of the style is the use of drapery as an expression of motion, or to suggest the body beneath; in archaic and early classical sculpture, clothing fell over the body as if it were a curtain obscuring the form below, in these sculptures there is the billowing chlamydes of the horsemen and the multi-pleated peploi of the women that lends a surface movement and tension to their otherwise, static poses. Variation in the manes of the horses has been of particular interest to some scholars attempting to discern the artistic personalities of sculptors who laboured on the frieze or perhaps, indicating deliberate representation of different regional traditions,Schuchhardt, 1930, pp.218‚Äì80, detects 79 individual sculptors. so far this Morellian analysis has been without conclusion. Interpretation and conjecture  Cattle led to sacrifice, South XLV, 137‚Äì140, British Museum As no description of the frieze survives from antiquity and many religious rituals involved secret symbolism and traditions left unspoken, so the question of the meaning of the sculpture has been a persistent and unresolved one. The first published attempt at interpretation belongs to Cyriacus of Ancona in the 15th century, who referred to it as the ‚Äúvictories of Athens in the time of Pericles‚Äù.Cyriacus of Ancona, 2003, p.19 What is now the more accepted view of the piece, however, namely that it depicts the Greater Panathenaic procession from the Leokoreion by the Dipylon Gate,Robertson Athena's Shrines and Festivals p.58 in Neils 1996. Before the construction of the Pompeion c. 400 BC the Leokoreion was the marshalling point for the festival procession, Thucydides 6.57. However the ritual space may have changed as the city's topography developed, \\"this side of the city, the northwest sector, was only developed in the sixth century, and mostly in the second half under the tyrants. Early Athens lay elsewhere, and until the sixth century the Panathenaic parade took quite a different route.\\" Robertson in Neils 1996 p.58. to the Acropolis, was mooted by Stuart and Revett in the second volume of their Antiquities of Athens, 1787.Stuart, Revett, 2002, p.31 Subsequent interpretations have built largely on this theory, even if they disallow that a temple sculpture could represent a contemporary event rather than a mythological or historical one. It has only been in recent years that an alternative thesis in which the frieze depicts the founding myth of the city of Athens instead of the festival pompe has emerged. Procession of tributes from the Apadana, Persepolis, first half of the fifth century. Possibly an inspiration for the Parthenon Frieze The contention that the scene depicts the festival for Athena is fraught with problems. Later sources indicate that a number of classes of individual who performed a role in the procession are not present in the frieze, these include: the hoplites, the allies in the Delian League, the skiaphoroi or umbrella bearers, the female hydraiphoroi (only male hydrai bearers are portrayed), the thetes, slaves, metics, the Panathenaic ship, and some would suggest the kanephoros, although there is evidence that she is accounted for.Ross Holloway, 1966, pp.223‚Äì226 lists the testimonia for the Panathenaic procession That what we now see was meant to be a generic image of the religious festival is problematic since no other temple sculpture depicts a contemporary event involving mortals. Locating the scene in mythical or historical time has been the principal difficulty of the line of inquiry. John Boardman has suggested that the cavalry portray the heroization of the Marathonomachoi, the hoplites who fell at Marathon in 490, and that, therefore these riders were the Athenians who took part in the last pre-war Greater Panathenaia.J. Boardman, The Parthenon Frieze ‚Äì another look, in Festschrift fur Frank Brommer, p.39‚Äì49, 1977 In support, he points out the number of horsemen, chariot passengers (but not charioteers), grooms, and marshals comes to the same as the number Herodotos gives for the Athenian dead: 192. Equally suggestive of a reference to the Persian Wars is the similarity several scholars have noted of the frieze to the Apadana sculpture in Persepolis. This has variously been posited to be democratic Athens counter-posing itself to oriental tyranny,Lawrence, 1951, pp.116‚Äì19, also Ashmole, 1972, p.117 or, aristocratic Athens emulating the Imperial East.Root, 1989, pp.103‚Äì20. Further to this zeitgeist argument there is J.J. Politt‚Äôs contention that the frieze embodies a Periclean manifesto, which favours the cultural institutions of agones (or contests, as witnessed by the apobatai), sacrifices, and military training as well as a number of other democratic virtues.Pollitt, 1972, p.87. More recent scholarship pursuing this vein has made the frieze a site of ideological tension between the elite and the demos with perhaps, only the aristocracy present, and merely veiled reference to the ten tribes.See L. Maurizio, The Panathenaic Procession:Athens' Participatory Democracy on Display?, in Boedeker, 1998 The so-called peplos scene, East V, 31‚Äì35, London The pediments, metopes, and shield of the Parthenos all illustrate the mythological past and as the deities are observing on the east frieze, it is natural to reach for a mythological explanation. Chrysoula Kardara,Kadara, 1964, pp.62‚Äì158, see also Brommer, 1977, p.149. has ventured that the relief shows us the first Panathenaic procession instituted under the mythical King Kekrops. This explanation would account for the absence of the allies and the ship, as these post-date the original practice of the sacrificial rite. In evidence she offers E35 as the future King Erichthonios presenting the first peplos to his predecessor Kekrops, iconographically similar to the boy‚Äôs depiction on a fragmentary kylix of the 450s.Acropolis 396 A recent interpretation by Joan Breton Connelly identifies the central scene on the east frieze (hence above the door to the cella and focal point of the procession) not as the handing over of Athena‚Äôs peplos by the arrhephoroi, but the donning of sacrificial garb by the daughter of King Erechtheus in preparation for the sacrifice of her life.Connelly, 1993, pp.58‚Äì80 An interpretation suggested by the text of the fragmentary papyrus remains of Euripides‚Äôs Erichtheus,Fragments are preserved in Lycurgus Against Leocrates, 101 and on papyrus Sorbonne 2328 wherein her life is demanded in order to save the city from Eumolpos and the Eleusinians. Thus, the deities turn their backs to prevent pollution from the sight of her death. A contentious subject in the field, Connelly's solution to the problem of meaning poses as many problems as it answers.\\"Revolutionary\\" in the words of Sarah Peirce in the report on the symposium on \\"Parthenon and Panathenaia.\\" at Princeton University, September 18, 1993. accessed 15.8.2010, it was also the context of Neils's book. See Neils, 2001, p.8. Influence Gemma Augustea, Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna The earliest surviving works of art that exhibit traces of the influence of the Parthenon frieze belong to the media of vase painting and grave stelae where we may find some echo not just of motifs, themes, poses, but tenor, as well. Direct imitation, and indeed quotation, of the frieze begins to be pronounced around 430 BC. One example, an explicit copy, is a pelike attributed to the Wedding Painter of a youth ‚Äúparking up‚Äù a horse exactly in the manner of figure W25 on the frieze.Berlin F 2357 While those vase paintings that resemble the frieze cluster around 430, the vases that quote the pediments are datable nearer to the end of the century, giving further evidence of the priority of the sculptural program.Niels, 2001, p.204 More accomplished painters also found inspiration in the sculpture, namely Polygnotos I and his group, especially the Peleus Painter, the Kleophon Painter and the late work of the Achilles Painter. Later painters of talent also managed to capture the mood of eusebeia, or thoughtful piety of the procession, as, for example, on the volute krater of the Kleophon Painter of a sacrifice to Apollo,Ferrara T57 which shares the quiet dignity of the best of High Classical sculpture.Robertson, 1992, p.223, \\"One of the artist's masterpieces‚Ä¶[i]n the pictures on this vase the Kleophon Painter is still Periklean in the happiest sense\\". The impact of the frieze may be sought in the Attic relief sculpture of the late fifth century; this resonance also may be discovered to some degree in the public works of the Hephaisteion frieze and the Nike Athena balustrade, where the imagery of the seated deities and the sandal-binder respectively, likely owes a debt to the Parthenon. There also are traces found on the private commissions of grave stelae from the period, for example, the ‚Äúcat stele‚Äù from Aegina bears a distinct similarity to figures N135‚Äì6.NAMA 715 As does the Hermes of the four-figure relief known from a Roman copy.Louvre MA 854 Later classicizing art of the Hellenistic and Roman eras also looked to the frieze for inspiration as attested by the Lycian Sarcophagus of Sidon, Phoenicia, the Ara Pacis Augustae, the Gemma Augustea, and many pieces of the Hadrianic generation.For example the marble relief from Hadrian's villa BM 2206 See also *Parthenon *Acropolis of Athens *Age of Pericles *Panathenaic Festival References Sources *Ashmole, B.

Arthur Andrews Collins (September 9, 1909 ‚Äì February 25, 1987) was a radio engineer and entrepreneur. He first gained national recognition as a teenager for significant advances in radio communication. He later founded his own radio engineering and manufacturing company in 1933, Collins Radio Co.. Rapidly expanding during World War II, Collins Radio eventually grew into a Fortune 500 leader in avionics, telecommunication, and military, space and commercial radio communications. Collins and his company ultimately became pioneers in melding computer and communication technology. Widely considered a genius in electronics innovation, he shunned personal publicity and is relatively little known today, even within the electronics community. Early history A young Arthur Collins' attic ham station; his radio communication was a critical link to the outside world for the 1925 MacMillan Expedition to the subarctic. Arthur A. Collins was born in Kingfisher, Oklahoma to Merle H. Collins (a mortgage banker) and Faith Andrews Collins (a graduate of Rockford College in Illinois). The family moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa when Arthur was 7. Merle founded Collins Farms Company in 1925,Collins Farms Company. 1930. A Bulletin of the Collins Farms Company. 24pp. which combined inefficient small farms into one collective enterprise, using the best available equipment and modern practices (contour plowing and erosion control, crop rotation, newly available hybrid seed corn) to achieve greatly increased productivity. This novel approach was initially successful but faltered as the Great Depression hit. His son Arthur was intensely interested in radio, became a licensed amateur radio operator at age 14, and designed and built his own equipment, purchasing expensive vacuum tubes with his father's help. Arthur Collins became an expert in circuit design and wave propagation, publishing several articles in specialty journals. Collins became friends with fellow amateur radio \\"hams\\", including John Reinartz, who shared a special interest in radio wave propagation. Within the radio spectrum only longer waves were thought to be refracted by the atmosphere (\\"skip\\"), allowing long-distance communication at night, but not so the shorter wavelength relegated to amateurs. Reinartz and Collins discovered that such \\"skip\\" did occur in the 20-meter range and during the daytime, which allowed long-distance communication with this type of equipment. When Reinartz became the ship's radio operator on the National Geographic-sponsored MacMillan Arctic expedition in 1925 only he and Collins were able to maintain reliable communication, unlike the U.S. Navy using longer wavelengths. Collins gained national recognition.A Culture of Innovation: the Arthur A. Collins Legacy. 2015. Antique Wireless Association & Arthur A. Collins Legacy Association.

Privately publ. 394pp.  Formal Education  Arthur Collins graduated from high school in Cedar Rapids and attended college at Amherst in Massachusetts, but returned at the end of his freshman year. He never obtained a degree, but rather took courses at the University of Iowa and at Coe College in Cedar Rapids. His own studies, and research done during the early years of his own company, typically outpaced advances in electronics coursework in academia. Yet he valued higher education, promoting programs for his employees to further their education, and even establishing courses with in-house instructors at Collins Radio.  Personal Family History  In 1930 Arthur Collins married Margaret (Peg) Van Dyke in Cedar Rapids, a noted artist within her community and a former student of Grant Wood. They had two children, Susan, born in 1939, and Michael, born in 1943. Margaret died suddenly of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1955. Arthur remarried in 1957, to Mary Margaret Meis, assistant director of dietetics at Mercy Hospital. They had two sons, Alan, born 1963, and David, born 1966. Arthur Collins maintained two residences, one in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and another in Dallas, Texas, where he lived following the sale of Collins Radio to Rockwell International. Collins also kept his boat, 70-foot custom-built fiberglass yacht, The Peregrine, in Newport Beach, California. This was his office and home during visits to the Newport Beach facility, and featured a large central \\"conference room\\".  Founding of Collins Radio  Collins founded Collins Radio Co. in 1933, building high quality amateur and commercial transmitters (not receivers for the domestic market). With recognition from success with the MacMillan expedition, Collins equipment was selected for the Byrd Expedition to the Antarctic (1933‚Äì1934).Collins Radio Company. 1934. The Byrd Antarctic Expedition II sails with a complete Collins short wave broadcasting station aboard. Collins Signal, January: 1-12 Beginning manufacturing in his basement, Arthur Collins soon rented building space and eventually constructed the first Collins Radio factory in Cedar Rapids in 1940. At this time the company had sales of about $500,000 and 150 employees. Collins Radio was recognized for excellence in design and manufacture of amateur and commercial transmitters and receivers, and began building aircraft radios in 1935.Braband, K.C. 1983.

Rockwell International. 218 pp.  Goddard, RCA, and the Collins vacuum tube patent suit  The heart of a radio transmitter, the oscillator, at that time used a vacuum tube to generate a radio frequency. RCA claimed it had exclusive rights to the de Forest vacuum tube oscillator circuit patent, and brought suit against Collins Radio and other purported infringers. In addition to rockets, Robert Goddard was also an electronics innovator, and when Arthur Collins discovered that Goddard's 1915 oscillator patent predated the de Forest patent Collins met with Goddard to explain that RCA's tube monopoly was a serious impediment to competitive innovation in electronics. With Goddard's help, the practicality of the Goddard design was demonstrated in court and the suit was dropped in 1938, allowing Collins and others to freely develop new technology. Goddard and Collins remained friends until Goddard's death in 1945.McElroy, G. 1997. The Collins 45A-How Arthur Collins met Robert Goddard. QST Feb. 44-46.Anderson, A.E.

World War II  During World War II Collins Radio became a key supplier of ground, ship, and aircraft communication equipment, expanding from about 350 to a peak of about 3700 employees. Arthur Collins was a co-designer of the Autotune device.Collins, A.A. 1944. History of the Autotune. Address to Collins Radio Technical Association, May 2, 1944. Invented for commercial aviation shortly before the war, it allowed the pilot to remotely switch to preset frequencies. Autotune precisely adjusted the radio in about 40 seconds, without the lengthy hand- tuning normally required by a designated radio operator. The ART-13 100-watt HF military radio was highly prized for this feature and for its rugged and reliable construction. Over 90,000 were built for B-24, B-25, B-29, TBF, and other aircraft. Collins gear was also extensively used for tactical ground communication and aboard ships. Following the Pearl Harbor attack, the Corregidor station in the Philippines used Collins equipment to reach the outside world, as did the USS Missouri during the surrender ceremonies in Tokyo Bay.Goodyear, Arlo C. 1954. The Collins Story. Privately published, Cedar Rapids, IA. 12pp.  Post-War Avionics  Advances in aviation during World War II led to the rapid post-war expansion of commercial and private aviation. Collins Radio quickly shifted from war-time projects to building communication equipment for the airlines and corporate fleets. A licensed pilot in his 20s, Arthur Collins led the pioneering development of the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) and other integrated flight instruments that combined in one display the pitch, roll, and yaw attitudes of the aircraft as well as its compass heading. Collins Radio became a world leader in avionics during the 1950s and 1960s. The 618T HF transceiver was a mainstay for the airlines and the ARC-27, with automatic tuning and 1750 channels, was the first practical UHF military transceiver, in service for over two decades.Haerle, J.M. 1961. Collins Firsts. Internal memo, Oct. 20, 1961. Collins Radio Co.Lamb, T.R. 1974. History of flight control systems at Collins Radio Company. TR 74-26A Rockwell International.  Telecommunication  Arthur Collins expanded his operations to Dallas and Burbank, California in the 1950s. In California he formed a research group under the direction of Mel Doelz to develop new methods of encoding or modulating voice and data signals with precisely shaped pulses that formed a binary code. Such techniques make very efficient use of bandwidth and virtually eliminate the noise and signal distortion that often plagues conventional radio. Based on this research, the Collins KINEPLEX long-distance telecommunication system offered in 1955 up to 40 channels compared to one voice or data channel in the same bandwidth with conventional telephone service. A key component of KINEPLEX was the world's first practical, mass-produced MODEM (modulator/demodulator), in essence, a translator between binary and analog signals. The classified Collins Navy Tactical Data System (NTDS) derived from this work. Arthur Collins was among the first to predict the coming computer and telecommunication revolution and led his engineers to combine the lessons of KINEPLEX with communication expertise to establish in the early 1960s a data and message switching facility in Cedar Rapids, using Collins C8400 computers to process a reservation and other data traffic for the airlines. Collins Radio also designed and built microwave communications systems, supplying both the basic equipment and also relay towers, often in remote, mountain top locations, to transmit the line-of-sight signal over long distances.

Kineplex: Collins High Speed Data Transmission System. 25pp.  SSB and Amateur Radio  Amateur radio was never a dominant segment within the Collins Radio product line, but held a special interest for Arthur Collins since childhood and provided a key catalyst in the design of other equipment. Collin's amateur gear was always built to the highest standards and demanded a premium price. As part of KINEPLEX Collins developed the mechanical filter, a small device (about ¬æ inch by 4 inches) using a series of precisely ground metallic discs linked mechanically and electrically. Determining the exact dimensions of these discs was critically important, and not easily discovered through empirical experimentation. A bright, young Indian mathematician named Roshan Sharma was fortuitously hired, based partly on his recent mastery of the necessary underlying mathematics needed to produce the resonating discs. An input signal causes the first disc to mechanically resonate at a very precise and stable frequency, which passes an induced electrical oscillation to the next disc and in turn sequentially through the device. By filtering out unnecessary portions of the radio signal, the mechanical filter (a kind of \\"bandpass filter\\") allows the use of a very stable, precise single sideband frequency. (Previously, single sideband operation required a large, complex piece of equipment.) The mechanical filter was the heart of Collins single sideband (SSB) technology and made SSB practical for the first time. SSB offered clear, efficient radio communications, even during conditions that would disrupt and distort conventional radio signals. In 1956 a SAC C-97 transport was fitted with Collins 75A-4 / KWM-1 SSB amateur gear for a demonstration of the superiority of SSB, leading to contracts for Collins SSB military equipment on B-52 and other aircraft, as well as ground stations. Sales far exceeded that of amateur sets. Collins Radio Company. 1960. Fundamentals of Single Side Band. 3rd ed. esp. Ch. 1, 12.Johnson, Fred. 1993. The Elements of Collins Quality. Electric Radio. December 56:4-7,35.  Antenna Design  Collins antenna design and development began in 1951 with the challenging design and construction of a 50-ft. diameter parabolic \\"dish\\" antenna for the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington DC. Collins antenna expertise expanded in the following years to include pioneering designs for satellites, deep space ground stations, HF ground communication, aircraft communication and navigation, spacecraft, commercial broadcast, microwave, and other special applications. Shanklin, J.R. 2010. Leading Antenna Engineer. Privately publ. 87pp.  Space Communication  Collins Radio entered the field of space communications very early when in 1951 it designed and built an ultra-high frequency 20-kW transmitter on 418 MHz coupled to a high gain antenna with an unusual tapered horn shape, installed at its facilities at the Cedar Rapids Airport. On November 8, 1951, two-way communications with a similar station at Sterling, Virginia was established for the first time by reflecting the UHF signal off the moon. The message \\"What hath God wrought?\\" was exchanged several times using Morse code over the half-million-mile path. Collins Radio pioneered satellite communications in 1960 by constructing two large ground stations at its facilities in Cedar Rapids, IA, and Richardson, TX. NASA launched the balloon-like ECHO I passive satellite on August 12, 1960. On its third orbital pass over the Midwest, Collins became the first to establish two-way satellite voice communications by reflecting 10 kW signals at 810 MHz off the satellite. Six days later Collins became the first to transmit an image - of President Eisenhower - via satellite between its two stations. Beginning with the X-15 experimental rocket plane, Collins Radio supplied radio communication equipment to NASA for Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo spacecraft, as well as ground stations and HF links to Mission Control. All American voices from space, as well as TV and data, were transmitted by Collins equipment. Peak sales for space communication systems were $69 million in 1966.  Computer Systems  Collins circa 1970 Arthur Collins' interest in computers predated his company's entry into this field. He is known to have traveled in the late 1930s to Iowa State College to visit John V. Atanasoff, the acknowledged inventor of the first digital computer, although unfortunately, no records exist of their discussions. Arthur Collins had predicted in 1957 the need to combine computers with communication, using some of the technology developed as part of KINEPLEX and related work. Company sales increased through the 1960s, by 1968 reaching $440,000,000 (approx. $3 billion in today's currency) and employing 24,000. With this available capital, Collins Radio entered the computer market in the 1960s. Under Collins' supervision, Collins Radio introduced the C8400 computer system, built using rack-mounted circuit cards, an unusual feature for computers of the day. A large computer communication center was established in Cedar Rapids in the 1960s, switching reservation data for the airlines, as well as in-house company data, with links to Dallas, Texas, and Newport Beach in California. The next generation of C8500 computer used units similar to \\"black boxes\\" in avionics as part of a modular design. A Process Division was formed that combined the design and manufacture of planar circuit boards into one organization. Collins integrated circuits and other microelectronic components were mounted on Collins-built circuit boards. Modular construction allowed an easy expansion of computer capability in response to demand and provided benefits in manufacture and maintenance (boxes could be swapped). The Process Division and modular construction concepts were revolutionary, examples of the culture of innovation at Collins Radio, and a direct result of Arthur Collins' vision. Arthur Collins was intensely involved in these efforts, bringing in outside telecommunication experts, and setting up classes for the study of computer architecture and software design. The result was the \\"C-System\\", a distributed, ring network linking processors and peripheral equipment and functions, including manufacturing devices, inventory control, purchasing, and other administrative activities. Contemporary systems used IBM 360 or similar computers in highly centralized centers, serving only a few functions, and not linked to other similar centers. The C-System was designed to be flexible, able to expand to meet diverse needs, and accessible by a variety of users, not just computer specialists. The C-System was extraordinarily innovative but as a consequence, its scope and costs could not be predicted. Eventually, it disrupted other programs and led to serious cost overruns, beyond funding sources. One of the main difficulties was the large size, relatively low density, and very high cost of computer memory, as demanded by the C-System. Arthur Collins' vision of the potential for the C-System exceeded that of most of his staff, and certainly that of bankers or other funding sources. In spite of the negative effect on the company's finances, he insisted on continuing the development of the C-System, certain that it would be an eventual success. Unfortunately, the overall economy was in recession in the late 1960s, especially for highly specialized commercial and defense electronics. (For example, employment at Boeing dropped from 100,000 in 1968 to 32,500 in 1971. Lights out, Seattle; Seattle Times, November 3, 1996). A difficult decision was made to form an alliance with North American Rockwell. Unable to meet short-term financial goals, Arthur Collins was forced to leave the company in 1971. Ironically, his vision of a distributed network of relatively small processors and computer work stations was exactly prescient. The seeds of the linked personal computers and of the Internet were to be found in the C-System. Computer memory quickly became faster, of higher capacity, and cheaper, but not soon enough to rescue the C-System. Collins Radio Company. 1969. Collins C-System. Sept. 22pp.Johnson, Fred. 1995. Project \\"COMO\\". CQWA Journal, Fall: 42-49.  A.A.C. Inc.  After leaving Collins Radio Arthur Collins formed a private research and development firm in Dallas, Texas, called Arthur A. Collins Inc. He hired a few key people, some from the old Collins Radio C-System group. His interest was in telecommunication and computer networks, specifically digital switch design for telephone networks, and later computer network design, which he titled \\"Integrated Service Network\\" (ISN). AACI developed its own internal email system in 1981, called \\"Command I\\". [\\"I\\" may stand for 'interconnect'.] Collins published a book on telecommunication entitled \\"A Time for Innovation\\", co-authored with Robert Pedersen, and his firm eventually was awarded several patents, some posthumously. Arthur Collins worked until his death from a stroke, having lived long enough to see the advent of the personal computer, the fiber optic cable, and the beginning of the internet. Collins, A.A. 1985.

Merle Collins Foundation.184pp.  Personality: work habits and design philosophy Those who worked with Arthur Collins invariably mention his extraordinary work ethic, his penchant for long days and total concentration on fixed goals, and his expectation that others on his team should similarly put in long hours. He was skeptical of the concept of holidays, except perhaps for Christmas Day. Collins would ask his library assistant to compile books, journal articles and other select reading material. In a matter of only a few days these would be returned; he would by then have completely adsorbed their content, in preparation for the next phase of a project, and would then request a new batch. He did not welcome dissent, unless accompanied by facts and logical argument, yet he sought out expertise outside his background. One mathematician and personal friend noted that Collins once described how he could visualize new and revolutionary concepts. He described his ideas in such detail and correctness that the underlying math could then be generated by others and would seem obvious in retrospect. There is no doubt that part of the company's success was due to Arthur Collins' ability to seek out and recognize talented engineers and administrative staff. Collins Radio was known as a demanding workplace, but with the reward that absolutely cutting-edge work was being done. Probably his most significant personal trait was Collins' ability to forecast society's future technological needs, to then define goals and begin developing the systems and devices necessary to achieve these goals. In this way he anticipated a customer's future needs, and would often have working models available well in advance of competitors. Examples would include the navigation aids and integrated flight control instruments build by Collins Radio following World War II, the binary modulation scheme of KINEPLEX and similar systems, SSB HF communication, and the melding of computers and communication - built on earlier work with telecommunication. Under Arthur Collins' leadership Collins Radio devoted great resources to research and development and continually strove to advance the state of the art in concepts and technology, rather than producing consumer electronics with prolonged product lives and high income potential. The commercial aviation and defense electronic markets were inherently fickle and uncertain, often with relatively low profit margins, yet Collins Radio maintained its status as a premier company for four decades during Arthur Collins' tenure. The consensus among his peers is that this longevity was due in large part to his imagination, vision, and genius for innovation. For an expert in communication, Arthur Collins was inherently shy and soft-spoken, comfortable in his authority without bluster. He had a rich sense of humor, fully expressed only in the company of close friends and associates. He avoided undue publicity, and extended this demeanor to his company by cautioning restraint in advertising and public relations. When the CBS anchor Walter Cronkite called asking for an interview during the Apollo landings, Collins demurred and told Cronkite that he didn't want to take personal credit for the hard work of many others at Collins Radio. \\"It is necessary that we marshal the combined powers of many scientific and engineering disciplines together with man's other creative and spiritual faculties in an effort to build a decent and meaningful world. Whatever your field may be, your progress will depend upon your individual imagination. I urge you to give it free rein.\\"‚ÄîArthur A. Collins This article is provided by the Arthur A.

It was unmarked and supposedly untraceable to country of origin or manufacture in order to maintain plausible deniability of covert operators in the event of their death or capture.Pacella, Gerard (2002), 100 Legendary Knives, Iola, USA, Krause Publications, p 99. . Design The SOG Knife was designed by Benjamin Baker, the Deputy Chief of the U.S. Counterinsurgency Support Office (CISO). A chrome-moly steel known as SKS-3 was chosen for the blade and hardened to a Rockwell hardness of 55-57. The blade pattern featured a convex false edge on the clip point of a Bowie knife. The stacked leather handle was inspired by a Marbles Gladstone Skinning Knife made in the 1920s owned by Baker, into which finger grooves were molded. The blade was typically parkerized or blackened to reduce glare. This was done so by applying a dark gun-blue finish (similar to those used on guns) on this SK-3 carbon steel knife. The knife was carried in a leather sheath which contained a sharpening steel or whetstone. The first contract was awarded to Japanese Trading Company Yogi Shokai, Okinawa for 1,300 seven-inch blades designated \\"Knife, indigenous, RECON, 7\\", w/scabbard & whetstone\\" at $9.85 each. In 1966, SOG ordered 1,200 sterile knives with six- inch blades and black sheaths and in March of the following year an additional lot of 3,700 was ordered. This second lot was serial numbered for accountability purposes and was designated \\"Knife, indigenous, hunting, 6\\", w/black sheath and whetstone\\". Further knives were ordered from Japan Sword, Tokyo as well. The orders were actually fulfilled by a number of knifemakers and as a result, the various lots had minor differences such as blade bluing color and guard color or shape. Although the SOG office based at Kadena and Yogi Shokai were in Okinawa, it is believed that only a major knifemaking source like Seki could have fulfilled all these orders, In 1986, a company named SOG Specialty Knives based in Santa Monica, California marketed a knife very similar to the original SOG knife manufactured in Seki City, Japan and marked it with the US Army Special Forces Crest., and named it the \\"S1 Bowie\\", using blued SK5 carbon steel for the blade. It was a replica of the commemorative versions of the original MACV-SOG knives, rather than the actual sterile unmarked knives used in combat. SOG made a version with an Aus8 stainless steel blade and black micarta handle in commemoration of the U.S. Navy SEALs., known as the \\"SOG S2 Trident\\". The other Vietnam replica knife is known as the \\"Recon Bowie\\" by SOG with a distinctive banana shaped 7 inch blade. This type of knife was actually the first to go into service in Vietnam. The last replica knife is the \\"SCUBA/Demo\\" which was introduced in 2001, and represents the rarest knife in this group as only one true original is reported to exist, It was created for and assigned to the USN Advisory Detachment, which operated coastal gunboats. The S1 and S2 knives were manufactured by Hattori of Seki under contract to SOG Knives USA from 1986 to 2005, after which SOG shifted to Taiwan manufacture. Hattori also manufactured the three commemorative SOG bowies for Boker, for sale in the European market. Replicas of the SOG knife have also been made by Al Mar Knives, Ek Knives, Tak Fukuta for Parker, and Strider Knives. SOG also contracted with Kinryu Co. Ltd of Seki Japan to manufacture the Recon Bowie and the Scuba Demo until 2007. None of these knives, however, are currently used by any branch of the US Military in an official capacity. Original models are extremely valuable collector's items among both knife collectors and militaria collectors. The later replicas are also in high demand by collectors, especially the early ones made in Seki.

There were no legal options to take, so in April 2005 \\"National Vanguard\\" was formally organized by some former National Alliance Unit Coordinators and five members of the Executive Committee.\\"National Vanguard: Our Cause Reborn\\" The main issues cited for the split with the National Alliance were over the creation of an expanded Board of Directors, prompt and professional publishing of a news-magazine and open accounting of all funds collected. The new organization picked Kevin Alfred Strom as its new leader, but a Board of Directors was not created. Within 8 months half of all National Vanguard members had either resigned or formed another new group. Most of the key leaders who planned the initial coup from the National Alliance group quit the National Vanguard within 15 months, but without all the open Internet airing of \\"internal laundry.\\" In January 2007 Strom was arrested by the FBI and Federal Marshals for child pornography related charges. In 2008 he pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography (although he maintains that the possession was inadvertent) and was sentenced to 23 months in prison. As of May 2015, National Vanguard maintains an active website featuring daily articles and updates. Activities Since the reorganization of National Vanguard, the group has been focused upon unit meetings and the distribution of fliers. A boycott against the hardware chain The Home Depot was started because of its stance on illegal immigrants. Units in Florida, Nevada, and New Jersey appear to be the most active. Members are attempting to form a new political party in Nevada: the White People's Party.\\"Nevada NV Activists Defy Show Ban\\".

Their decision to help only white victims has been described as reprehensible. In 2005, National Vanguard showcased the pop-music duo Prussian Blue, twin sisters from Bakersfield, California, Lynx and Lamb Gaede, whom the organization hoped would \\"be breaking new ground... creating an entire genre of pro-White music\\" that will cross over to mainstream audiences.Prussian Blue Their mother, April, is a writer and activist for National Vanguard.

A lens hood is designed so that it does not block the angle of view of the lens. Lens hoods block the Sun or other light source(s) to prevent glare and lens flare. In photography, a lens hood or lens shade is a device used on the front end of a lens to block the Sun or other light source(s) to prevent glare and lens flare. Lens hoods may also be used to protect the lens from scratches and the elements without having to put on a lens cover. The geometry of a lens hood is dependent on three parameters: the focal length of the lens, the size of the front lens element and the dimensions of the image sensor or film in the camera. Cause of lens flare Flare occurs when stray light strikes the front element of a lens and then bounces around within the lens. This stray light often comes from very bright light sources, such as the Sun, bright studio lights, or a bright white background. If a light source is in the lens' angle of view, a lens hood will hardly have any effect, but the light does not have to cause lens flare. It is sufficient that stray light from a bright light source enters the lens. Multi-layer coatings in newer lenses also help to reduce lens flare. Types A selection of lens hoods: one cylindrical, one conical and three petal ones (one of them is chopped). The shape of a lens hood can vary from a plain cylindrical or conical section (much like a lamp shade) to a more complex shape, sometimes called a petal, tulip, or flower hood. These more complex shapes take into account the final image's shape and aspect ratio. This allows the lens hood to block stray light with the longer portions of the lens hood, while allowing more light into the corners of the image through the shorter portions of the hood, thereby reducing the amount of mechanical vignetting (reduction of light around the periphery) in the final image. The geometry of a lens hood is dependent on three things: * focal length of the lens, * size of the front lens element, * dimensions of the image sensor or film in the camera. Ideally, lens hoods should increase in length, and therefore in efficiency, as the focal length of the lens increases and the angle of view reduces. Lens hoods are more prominent in long focus lenses because they have a smaller viewing angle than that of wide-angle lenses. For wide angle lenses, the length of the hood (away from the end of the lens) cannot be as long as those for telephoto lenses, as a longer hood would enter the wider field of view of the lens. Maximum aperture also affects the shape of a lens hood. As the aperture gets larger the amount of light and consequentially the amount of the frame the sensor \\"sees\\" increases. This can be seen when comparing two lens hoods of the same focal length but with differing apertures ‚Äì compare the lens hood of a telephoto 4 lens with that of the same lens but with a maximum aperture of 2.8. Correctly made rectangular or square lens hoods are generally more efficient than cylindrical or conical ones because those shapes closely resemble the shape of the photograph. However, rectangular or square lens hoods should not be used with zoom lenses whose front elements rotate as the focal length is changed, as the hood will rotate as well, blocking parts of the angle of view. The same also applies to petal lens hoods. For these types of lenses, only cylindrical or conical lens hoods will work effectively. In addition, lens hoods can offer some degree of physical protection for the lens due to the hood extending farther than the lens itself.Harmer, Jim, \\"What does a lens hood do?\\", Improve Photography, 15 Jun 2011 File:Pentax K-5 4773 06.jpgThe \\"box\\" or \\"cut-out\\" type lens hood of a Pentax DA 21 mm 3.2 Limited lens.

Lens hoods with an extending bellows design (much like the bellows of a medium or large format camera) can be adjusted for depth. This means that the depth can be increased when used on longer focal length lenses, and reduced as necessary for shorter focal length lenses. Storage Lens hoods that are supplied by the manufacturer of the lens are often designed to fit onto the matching lens facing either forward, for normal use, or backwards, so that the hood may be stored with the lens without occupying much additional space. Rubber lens hoods are flexible and generally collapse for storage. However other lens hoods must be removed if these features are not available and length extension of the lens is not preferred during storage.

He was the second and last Secretary General of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) who organised the party during the Lancaster House talksLancaster House Agreement Race and History and served in government before his popularity as a potential rival to Robert Mugabe caused their estrangement.R. W. Johnson, \\"Lessons of Zimbabwe\\", Letters, London Review of Books, Vol. 30, No. 24, 18 December 2008. Pre-Independence During the war, Tekere served on the ZANU high command, or Dare reChimurenga. He was detained by the Rhodesian government at Gonakudzingwa.Martin, D., and P. Johnson, 1981. The Struggle for Zimbabwe. Faber & Faber. Early life Edgar Zivanai \\"2-Boy\\" (nom de guerre) Tekere was an early ally of Robert Mugabe within the Zimbabwe African National Union (of which he was a founder member in 1964) during the fight for independence and against the Rhodesian Front government of Ian Smith. Mugabe and Tekere, having served eleven and a half years in Hwa-Hwa Penitentiary & Gonakudzingwa State Prison as political prisoners of Ian Smith's government, immediately left upon release and crossed the Eastern Highlands Border in Mutare through the mountains by foot, following the Gairezi river trail to Seguranza military camp in Mozambique, to mastermind and kickstart guerilla warfare, aided by Samora Machel, in 1975. The Bush War or Second Chimurenga raged on. harassment of Tekere's close family members and relatives by the platoon of Rhodesian Front Soldiers, Selous Scouts, Police Special Branch and Central Intelligence Organisation, under the auspices of Ian Smith. During these trying times Edgar Tekere received the code name/nickname (\\"Mukoma\\") by close family members and relatives. Tekere was elected by a democratic process to be the first ZANU-PF Secretary-General following Zimbabwe's independence.  Independence celebration and Bob Marley  Edgar Tekere being the ZANU-PF Secretary General, personally invited Bob Marley to perform at Rufaro Stadium, for the official Zimbabwean Independence Celebration. Marley's music was inspirational to the guerilla fighters whilst they were in the bush fighting. More than 100,000 Zimbabweans attended the concert, and Bob Marley performed the song \\"Zimbabwe\\", an unofficial Zimbabwean anthem. He also stayed with Edgar Tekere during this tour date.Moskowitz, D. (2007), Blackman Redemption, Greenwood, p. 109. Murder charge When ZANU won the 1980 elections, Tekere was appointed as Minister of Manpower Planning in Mugabe's Cabinet. He followed his appointment by making a series of outspoken speeches that went far beyond government policy. Shortly after his appointment, on 4 August 1980 he greeted then-Prime Minister Mugabe and visiting President of Mozambique Samora Machel in combat fatigues, announcing that he was going \\"to fight a battle.\\" Tekere and his bodyguards went looking for supporters of Joshua Nkomo's ZAPU outside Harare but, failing to find them, went onto a neighbouring farm and shot white farm manager Gerald Adams..\\" =Trial= Tekere retained his government post when he went on trial together with seven bodyguards who were all former guerrilla fighters in the independence war. On 8 December the High Court, on a majority decision, found him not guilty of murder. Both assessors, over-ruling the judge, held that while Tekere had killed Adams, he was acting in terms of an utter conviction that State Security was at risk.State v. Tekere and others, Zimbabwe Law Reports 1980, p. 489. It is important to note that now with Twenty First Century global research on war veterans it is believed that Tekere suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) which led to his erratic behaviour. At the trial, there was a lack of evidence led that Edgar Tekere and his platoon had first gone looking for ZAPU operatives before conducting a military style sweep of the farm on which the farmer was killed. There was also no evidence that he had said that he was proud to have killed Gerald Adams. State Counsel Chris Glaum did not put this to any of the defendants. The trial was presided over by Judge John Pitman J. There were two assessors, Christopher Navavie Greenland, a provincial magistrate, and Peter Khumbuyani Nemapare, a senior magistrate. The court was especially constituted to present as racially balance in that Judge Pitman was white, Greenland is mixed race, and Nemapare is black. It was the first and last time that a court was constituted in this way. Tekere was represented by Louis Blom-Cooper QC, a flamboyant English counsel, and there were many confrontations between him and the presiding judge. The court was unanimous that Tekere was guilty of murder. However, by a majority, it found that as he had acted in \\"good faith\\" at the time, he was entitled to indemnification under a law that Ian Smith, the previous Rhodesian Prime Minister, had ironically enacted despite widespread opposition to protect his security forces during the Bush War. Any member of the country's security forces was exempt from conviction in respect of any crime committed if, at the time of commission, such member was acting in \\"good faith\\", acting in terms of a genuinely held conviction that the State's security interests were being served. Greenland wrote the judgement in which the two assessors over-ruled Pitman on this issue. It was the first time in the history of the country that assessors over-ruled a judge. The assessors found that Tekere presented with a personality and mindset which was completely consistent with an unreasonable but genuinely held belief that he was acting in the interest of state security with the confrontation between one of his men and the farmer, in which the latter was killed, an unfortunate consequence of the security sweep which Tekere genuinely believed needed to be conducted. In his book \\"The Other ‚Äì without fear, favour or prejudice\\" Greenland reveals, for the first time in 2010, that Judge Pitman made a surprising and inexplicable \\"about-face\\", having first been firmly of the view that Tekere was entitled to the indemnity and then changing his mind without proffering good reason.Judge Chris N. Greenland, The Other ‚Äì without fear, favour or prejudice, published by Lulu.com and Amazon.com, 2010. Rivalry with Mugabe Tekere was dismissed from the government on 11 January 1981, a decision he was reported to be happy with; he retained the Secretary- Generalship of ZANU. In April 1981 he was detained by Kenyan security forces to prevent him from speaking to students after giving a newspaper interview in which he said he was proud of the killing of Gerald Adams. In July, Tekere referred to some ZANU representatives as having \\"inherited the colonial mentality,\\" which was straining relations between them and the party's supporters. Mugabe hit back by saying \\"Those who are complaining that the revolution is not continuing... are the most immoral and laziest in the party.\\" Tekere was increasingly seen as a leader of a rival faction to Mugabe, and was dismissed as Secretary-General on 9 August with Mugabe taking the post himself. After criticising corruption in the party, in August 1984 Tekere was elected to the Central Committee of ZANU-PF and carried shoulder-high from the Congress; he was also being supported by the Whites in Zimbabwe after opposing the farm squats by ZANU-PF supporters which he described as \\"donga watonga\\" (chaotic government). He was provincial chairman of ZANU-PF in Mutare. Zimbabwe Unity Movement Tekere supported Mugabe at the 1985 elections but by October 1988 his consistent criticism of corruption resulted in his expulsion from the party. When Mugabe voiced his belief that Zimbabwe would be better governed as a one party state, Tekere strongly disagreed, saying \\"A one-party state was never one of the founding principles of ZANU-PF and experience in Africa has shown that it brought the evils of nepotism, corruption and inefficiency.\\" He ran against Robert Mugabe in the 1990 Presidential race as the candidate of the Zimbabwe Unity Movement, offering a broadly free market platform against Mugabe's communist-style economic planning. Edgar Tekere received unprecedented support for his opposition to Mugabe which led to massive election rigging by ZANUhttp://www.thezimbabwetimes.com/page533.htm in order for Mugabe to win the election on 1 April 1990 receiving 2,026,976 votes while Tekere only got 413,840 (16% of the vote). At the simultaneous Parliamentary elections the ZUM won 20% of the vote but only two seats in the House of Assembly. Zimbabwe Unity Movement supporters were the targets of violent attacks from supporters of ZANU (PF) and five candidates were murdered. Later career Tekere dropped out of sight after the election, which fuelled rumours that he had been planted as an opposition figure. In 2005, he voiced his wish to stand as a ZANU (PF) candidate for the Senate of Zimbabwe but was rebuffed. In 2006 it was reported that he had rejoined ZANU (PF). A letter sent to him by ZANU (PF) national chairman John Nkomo dated 7 April 2006 said, \\"You will not exercise your right to be elected to any office in the party for a period of five years. You will be required to uphold all the duties of a member listed in Article 3, Section 18 of the amended Zanu PF constitution\\". At a rally on 2 March 2008 in Highfield, a suburb of Harare, Tekere endorsed Simba Makoni, an independent candidate who was running against Mugabe in the March 2008 presidential election. Tekere said that he was \\"appointing [him]self principal campaigner for Mugabe's downfall\\". On Sunday, 16 August 2009, at Sakubva Stadium in Mutare in Manicaland, Tekere was the guest of honour for the MDC in front of a crowd of 40,000 people that gathered to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the MDC, led by Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai. Death Edgar \\"2-Boy\\" Zivanai Tekere died noon on Tuesday 7 June 2011, at Murambi Clinic, in Mutare, Manicaland. This occurred following a long battle with prostate cancer, and had a medical history of suffering from undiagnosed post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a military war veteran which brought about erratic intermittent alcoholism behaviour tendencies. With recent evidence based research on PTSD military veterans from the Iraqi & Afghanistan Wars, there is more understanding of PTSD and how it affects the military veterans when they integrate into civil society post-war. Tekere was 74 years old. National hero status Edgar 2-Boy Tekere was unanimously declared a national hero by the ZANU-PF Politburo.

A highly collaborative effort, it was Dylan's second consecutive album to receive almost unanimously negative reviews. Released during a period when his recording career was experiencing a slump, sales were disappointing, reaching only number 61 in the US and number 32 in the UK. Recording and reception \\"Even by Dylan standards, this album has had a strange, difficult birth,\\" wrote Rolling Stone critic David Fricke. \\"Its release was delayed for more than half a year, and the track listing was altered at least three times. If the musician credits are any indication, the songs that made the final cut come from half a dozen different recording sessions spread out over six years.\\" Like its predecessor Knocked Out Loaded, Dylan once again used more collaborators than normal. Rick Griffin's original design for the cover of Down in the Groove. In a review published in his Consumer Guide column, Robert Christgau wrote, \\"Where Self Portrait was at least weird, splitting the difference between horrible and hilarious, [Dylan is now] forever professional‚Äînot a single remake honors or desecrates the original. All he can do to a song is Dylanize it, and thus his Danny Kortchmar band and his Steve Jones-Paul Simonon band are indistinguishable, immersed in that patented and by now meaningless one-take sound.\\" Christgau would later call Down in the Groove \\"horrendous product\\". Recently coming off of the album Knocked Out Loaded, Dylan took the opportunity to further work on his collaborative efforts. The album features several guest appearances for the first time. Most prominent was the appearance of The Grateful Dead, who provided the album with one of its notable high spots with the single \\"Silvio\\". The track was later included on Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Volume 3 and The Essential Bob Dylan. As stated in the Encyclopedia of Popular Music, the album shares no single recording session. This created a tone that the Encyclopedia described as, \\"raucous to pensive to sombre in a heartbeat.\\" In the book Bob Dylan: The Recording Sessions, 1960-1994, author Clinton Heylin offers an explanation for the style and layout of the album's tracks. He states, \\"As it is, Dylan's intent all along may have been to show the rich vein of music he listened to when growing up in Hibbing.\\" The author goes on further to describe how the album was a sensible step for Dylan, suggesting his issues with creative writing had hampered his ability to produce new material. A unique aspect of the album was the \\"garage rock\\"-type tour that followed. Dylan's previous tour had placed a heavy emphasis on guest appearances to allow for a more variety-themed show. The intimate nature of the smaller band allowed the artists to interpret songs differently each time they played. Often the performances held little resemblance to prior shows. In his review for Rolling Stone magazine, Fricke noted that \\"a highly anticipated‚Äîif somewhat unlikely‚Äîcollaboration with Full Force, the top Brooklyn hip-hop posse, turned out to be an old Infidels outtake, 'Death Is Not the End,' newly garnished with some tasty but rather superfluous Full Force vocal harmonies.\\" \\"Death Is Not the End\\" was covered by Nick Cave in 1996. In 2007, Rolling Stone labeled Down in the Groove as Bob Dylan's worst album. In 2017, the magazine added that \\"Dylan fans will forever argue about the precise moment when [Dylan's] career hit rock-bottom but most pin it somewhere around the time that Down in the Groove landed with a thud in record stores in May 1988.\\" Artist Rick Griffin, primarily known for the Grateful Dead's logos and poster art, was commissioned to design the cover of the record jacket. Griffin's drawing of a man playing a guitar while riding a horse backwards was rejected by Columbia Records who instead used a photograph of Dylan. Tour Soon after Down in the Groove's release, Dylan embarked on a summer tour of North America, presumably in support of the album. The first show was on June 7, 1988, at Concord Pavilion in Concord, California, and it was a dramatic shift from previous tours. In recent years, Dylan had relied on larger ensembles, often staffed with high-profile artists like Mick Taylor, Ian McLagan, the Grateful Dead and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. This time, Dylan organized his concerts around a small, \\"garage rock\\"-type combo, consisting of guitarist G.E. Smith (of Saturday Night Live fame), bassist Kenny Aaronson and drummer Christopher Parker. (There was a notable exception in the early June shows; those concerts featured a second, lead guitarist in Neil Young, whose own career was also in a downturn at the time.) Song selection also became more adventurous, with setlists from different nights offering little resemblance to one another. The concerts would also alternate between full-band, electric sets and smaller, acoustic sets (with Smith providing Dylan's only accompaniment); it was during the acoustic sets that Dylan incorporated an endless variety of traditional cover songs, a marked departure from previous shows that depended heavily on his own compositions. The concerts initially received modest attention, but they would soon receive a generous amount of praise. The tour schedule was also surprising for a man of Dylan's age, as Dylan was spending most of his time on the road. Just as one leg of the tour would end, Dylan would schedule another leg soon after, and this would continue for many years to come. As a result, Dylan's shows are now often referred to as the \\"Never Ending Tour\\". Though the supporting personnel would undergo a number of changes for years to come, the basic format begun in the summer of 1988 would continue to this day.

Ultrasonic motors differ from piezoelectric actuators in several ways, though both typically use some form of piezoelectric material, most often lead zirconate titanate and occasionally lithium niobate or other single-crystal materials. The most obvious difference is the use of resonance to amplify the vibration of the stator in contact with the rotor in ultrasonic motors. Ultrasonic motors also offer arbitrarily large rotation or sliding distances, while piezoelectric actuators are limited by the static strain that may be induced in the piezoelectric element. One common application of ultrasonic motors is in camera lenses where they are used to move lens elements as part of the auto-focus system. Ultrasonic motors replace the noisier and often slower micro-motor in this application. Mechanism An illustration of the \\"Inchworm\\" piezo motor, which moves the normally free red- and-white striped rod longitudinally from right to left. When power is being applied on the piezo element, denoted by colour, it expands. By cyclically expanding the four parts, the rod is moved from right to left. 1 housing, 2 motive crystal, 3 locking crystal, 4 rotary part. Dry friction is often used in contact, and the ultrasonic vibration induced in the stator is used both to impart motion to the rotor and to modulate the frictional forces present at the interface. The friction modulation allows bulk motion of the rotor (i.e., for farther than one vibration cycle); without this modulation, ultrasonic motors would fail to operate. Two different ways are generally available to control the friction along the stator-rotor contact interface, traveling-wave vibration and standing-wave vibration. Some of the earliest versions of practical motors in the 1970s, by Sashida, for example, used standing-wave vibration in combination with fins placed at an angle to the contact surface to form a motor, albeit one that rotated in a single direction. Later designs by Sashida and researchers at Matsushita, ALPS, and Canon made use of traveling-wave vibration to obtain bi-directional motion, and found that this arrangement offered better efficiency and less contact interface wear. An exceptionally high-torque 'hybrid transducer' ultrasonic motor uses circumferentially-poled and axially-poled piezoelectric elements together to combine axial and torsional vibration along the contact interface, representing a driving technique that lies somewhere between the standing and traveling-wave driving methods. A key observation in the study of ultrasonic motors is that the peak vibration that may be induced in structures occurs at a relatively constant vibration velocity regardless of frequency. The vibration velocity is simply the time derivative of the vibration displacement in a structure, and is not (directly) related to the speed of the wave propagation within a structure. Many engineering materials suitable for vibration permit a peak vibration velocity of around 1 m/s. At low frequencies -- 50 Hz, say -- a vibration velocity of 1 m/s in a woofer would give displacements of about 10 mm, which is visible. As the frequency is increased, the displacement decreases, and the acceleration increases. As the vibration becomes inaudible at 20 kHz or so, the vibration displacements are in the tens of micrometers, and motors have been built that operate using 50 MHz surface acoustic wave (SAW) that have vibrations of only a few nanometers in magnitude. Such devices require care in construction to meet the necessary precision to make use of these motions within the stator. More generally, there are two types of motors, contact and non-contact, the latter of which is rare and requires a working fluid to transmit the ultrasonic vibrations of the stator toward the rotor. Most versions use air, such as some of the earliest versions by Hu Junhui. Research in this area continues, particularly in near- field acoustic levitation for this sort of application. (This is different from far-field acoustic levitation, which suspends the object at half to several wavelengths away from the vibrating object.) Applications Canon was one of the pioneers of the ultrasonic motor, and made the \\"USM\\" famous in the late 1980s by incorporating it into its autofocus lenses for the Canon EF lens mount. Numerous patents on ultrasonic motors have been filed by Canon, its chief lensmaking rival Nikon, and other industrial concerns since the early 1980s. Canon has not only included an ultrasonic motor (USM) in their DSLR lenses, but also in the Canon PowerShot SX1 IS bridge camera. The ultrasonic motor is now used in many consumer and office electronics requiring precision rotations over long periods of time.

The album was largely greeted as a strange and disappointing follow-up to 1989's critically acclaimed Oh Mercy. Most of the criticism was directed at the slick sound of pop producer Don Was, as well as a handful of tracks that seem rooted in children's nursery rhymes. It is a rarity in Dylan's catalog for its inclusion of celebrity cameos by Jimmie Vaughan, Slash, Elton John, George Harrison, David Crosby, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Bruce Hornsby. Dedication The album is dedicated to \\"Gabby Goo Goo\\", later explained to be a nickname for Dylan's four-year-old daughter. This has led to the popular assumption that the album's more childlike songs were for her entertainment, something that has never been confirmed nor denied by Dylan. Recording Four songs from the album, \\"Handy Dandy\\", \\"10,000 Men\\", \\"God Knows\\", and \\"Cat's in the Well\\", were recorded in a single session in Los Angeles on 6 January 1990, before Dylan commenced a four-week tour. (\\"Handy Dandy\\" received overdubs subsequently.)Heylin, C., (2010), Still on the Road: The Songs of Bob Dylan, 1974-2006. Chicago Review Press. p. 374 Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin writes that Dylan finished recording the basic tracks for the album in mid-March 1990, but added new vocals to some tracks the following month, with instrumental overdub sessions extending into May 1990.Heylin, C., (2010), Still on the Road: The Songs of Bob Dylan, 1974-2006. Chicago Review Press. pp. 391-392, 502 Unlike the rest of his discography, the album features numerous guest appearances by established artists, such as Bruce Hornsby, Elton John and George Harrison. Additionally, session musicians like pianist Al Kooper and guitarist Waddy Wachtel appear throughout the album. The album opener, \\"Wiggle Wiggle\\", also features Slash on guitar, while \\"10,000 Men\\" features Stevie Ray Vaughan. The title track features a \\"fine guitar solo\\" by George Harrison; Heylin has called this track an \\"important song\\", noting that it has been a staple of Dylan's live performances.Heylin, C., (2010), Still on the Road: The Songs of Bob Dylan, 1974-2006. Chicago Review Press. pp. 383-385. Two songs, \\"Born in Time\\" and \\"God Knows\\", are reworkings of material originally recorded at the previous year's Oh Mercy sessions. Versions of these songs from the Oh Mercy sessions are included on The Bootleg Series Vol. 8: Tell Tale Signs. The intro to \\"Unbelievable\\" (which was released as a single, with an accompanying promotional video) is very similar to the intro on Carl Perkins's \\"Honey Don't\\", as sung by The Beatles on Beatles for Sale. According to producer Don Was, there were two outtakes from the album: \\"Shirley Temple Doesn't Live Here Anymore\\" (which Dylan co-wrote with Was and David Weiss) and \\"Heartland\\" (which Dylan later sang with Willie Nelson on Nelson's 1993 album Across the Borderline). \\"Shirley Temple Doesn't Live Here Anymore\\" was later recorded by Don Was's group Was (Not Was) for their 2008 album Boo! as \\"Mr. Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\\". Reception Dylan has echoed most critics' complaints, telling Rolling Stone in a 2006 interview that the album's shortcomings resulted from hurried and unfocused recording sessions, due in part to his activity with the Traveling Wilburys at the time. He also claimed that there were too many people working on the album, and that he was very disillusioned with the recording industry during this period of his career. Dylan critic Patrick Humphries, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Bob Dylan, was particularly harsh in his assessment of Under the Red Sky, stating the album \\"was everything Oh Mercy wasn't‚Äîsloppily written songs, lazily performed and unimaginatively produced. The first bridge of \\"2 X 2\\" (\\"How much poison did they inhale?\\") was reminiscent of the menace which pervaded Oh Mercy, but otherwise, where before there had been certainty and sureness, here was confusion and indecision.\\" Humphries saved his harshest attack for the album's opening song, \\"Wiggle Wiggle\\": The album did have some critical support, particularly from Robert Christgau of The Village Voice, who wrote: \\"To my astonishment, I think Under the Red Sky is Dylan's best album in 15 years, a record that may even signal a ridiculously belated if not totally meaningless return to form ‚Ä¶ It's fabulistic, biblical ‚Ä¶ the tempos are postpunk like it oughta be, with [Kenny] Aronoff's sprints and shuffles grooving ahead like '60s folk-rock never did.\\" And Paul Nelson, writing for Musician, called the album \\"a deliberately throwaway masterpiece\\". When the Voice held its Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 1990, Under the Red Sky placed at #39. In the end, album sales were disappointing, peaking at #38 on the US charts and #13 in the UK. According to the book Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan, the disappointing record sales of this album made him depressed. On top of that, Dylan's second wife had just signed for divorce in August 1990. Legacy Dylan continued the style of the album with his recording of the nursery rhyme \\"This Old Man\\", which was released on the Disney charity album For Our Children in 1991. For his follow-up album, Good As I Been to You (1992), Dylan went back to his acoustic roots, recording more serious songs. In 2005, Q magazine included the lead-off track \\"Wiggle Wiggle\\" in a list of \\"Ten Terrible Records by Great Artists\\". Time Magazine placed \\"Wiggle Wiggle\\" on the list of The 10 Worst Bob Dylan Songs, noting that it \\"sounds like the theme song to one of those tripped-out television shows beloved by toddlers and drug users\\". The song was covered on the 2014 tribute album Bob Dylan in the 80s: Volume One by Slash and Aaron Freeman.Widespread Panic, Marco Benevento, Slash, Tea Leaf Green, Deer Tick, Gene Ween, Craig Finn, Built to Spill and Members of My Morning Jacket Confirmed for 80s Dylan Its lyrics were also the namesake for the Danish pop/rock band Big Fat Snake.

On August 3, 1529, this agreement ended a war between the French king Francis I and the Spanish Habsburg emperor Charles V. The treaty temporarily confirmed Spanish (Habsburg) hegemony in Italy.Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Margaretha [Nederlanden] ¬ß Margaretha van Oostenrijk\\". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum. The peace was negotiated and signed at Cambrai by two ladies: Margaret of Austria for the emperor, and Louise of Savoy for the king. The treaty renewed the Treaty of Madrid (1526), except that it did not exact the surrender of Burgundy to Charles.  Background  The Peace of Cambrai ended France's involvement in the War of the League of Cognac, which had lasted since 1526. It was signed in the city of Cambrai, the center of the principality-bishopric in the Netherlands (now the French department Nord). This treaty is also called \\"Ladies' Peace\\", since women played an important role in its preparation: the mother of Francis I Louise of Savoy and the aunt of the emperor Margaret of Austria. They represented both monarchs in negotiations, helping them not to lose face.  Terms  Under the terms of the peace signed in Cambrai, Francis renounced his claims to Italian lands, Artois and Flanders, but retained Burgundy, from which Charles V had abandoned. The treaty provided for the return of Dauphin Fran√ßois and Prince Henry, the future Henry II, to France. in exchange for a ransom of 2 million √©cu.

During periods where this segment of U.S. Route 27 (US 27) has been signed as I-124, it has served as a spur route of I-24 to downtown Chattanooga. The road segment has not been signed as I-124 since the late 1980s (it is marked on overhead signs and mile markers as US 27), and the Tennessee Department of Transportation official map no longer designates it as I-124, but some DOT publications still make reference to the designation. Route description The US 27 freeway diverges from I-24 just before the Moccasin Bend in the Tennessee River, continues north through downtown Chattanooga, and then across the Tennessee River as a limited-access freeway on the P. R. Olgiati Bridge. The river is the point at which the I-124 designation ends. After crossing the river, the freeway continues under the US 27 designation for another (beyond which the spur continues under the Tennessee State Route 111 designation for a further ). The entire length of I-124 is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. History The route that is now I-124 was proposed in the 1950s by then-mayor of Chattanooga P.R. \\"Rudy\\" Olgiati to provide a secondary access across the Tennessee River and relieve congestion which had developed on the Market Street and Walnut Street Bridges. The section of highway between Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard was built between 1955 and 1959. The southern portion, located between I-24 and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, was built between 1961 and 1963, when that corresponding section of I-24 was built. The interchange with I-24, known as the \\"Big Scramble,\\" was reworked in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and the I-124 signage was removed at this time. A major reconstruction project commenced in December 2015 to widen and modernize I-124, which will reconstruct all interchanges, provide adequate shoulders and median divider, widen the route to six lanes, and remove the s-curve at the 4th street interchange. It is scheduled to be completed by July 2019.

Poetic themes Ammons wrote about humanity's relationship to nature in alternately comic and solemn tones. His poetry often addresses religious and philosophical matters and scenes involving nature, almost in a Transcendental fashion. According to reviewer Daniel Hoffman, his work \\"is founded on an implied Emersonian division of experience into Nature and the Soul,\\" adding that it \\"sometimes consciously echo[es] familiar lines from Emerson, Whitman and Dickinson.\\" Life Ammons grew up on a tobacco farm near Whiteville, North Carolina, in the southeastern part of the state.

He received an M.A. in English from the University of California, Berkeley. In 1964, Ammons joined the faculty of Cornell University, eventually becoming Goldwin Smith Professor of English and Poet in Residence. He retired from Cornell in 1998. His students who went on to achieve acclaim as poets include Alice Fulton and Jerald Bullis. Ammons had been a longtime resident of the South Jersey communities of Northfield, Ocean City and Millville, when he wrote Corsons Inlet in 1962.Laymon, Rob. \\"NOTED POET TO INJECT LIFE INTO WORKS IN O.C.

Among his major honors are the 1973 and 1993 U.S. National Book Awards (for Collected Poems, 1951-1971 and for Garbage); the Wallace Stevens Award from the Academy of American Poets (1998); and a MacArthur Fellowship in 1981, the year the award was established. The A. R. Ammons Poetry Contest in his boyhood home Columbus County, NC was begun in 1992. http://arammonspoetrycontest.org/about-the-contest/ Ammons's other awards include a 1981 National Book Critics Circle Award for A Coast of Trees; a 1993 Library of Congress Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry for Garbage; the 1975 Bollingen Prize for Sphere; the Poetry Society of America's Robert Frost Medal; the Ruth Lilly Prize; and fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978. Poetic style Ammons often writes in two- or three-line stanzas. Poet David Lehman notes a resemblance between Ammons's terza libre (unrhymed three-line stanzas) and the terza rima of Shelley's \\"Ode to the West Wind.\\" Lines are strongly enjambed. Some of Ammons's poems are very short, one or two lines only, a form known as monostich (effectively, including the title, a kind of coupletHirsch, Edwatd ' A Poets Glossary' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Boston 2014 ), while others (for example, the book-length poems Sphere and Tape for the Turn of the Year) are hundreds of lines long, and sometimes composed on adding-machine tape or other continuous strips of paper. His National Book Award-winning volume Garbage is a long poem consisting of \\"a single extended sentence, divided into eighteen sections, arranged in couplets\\". Ammons's long poems tend to derive multiple strands from a single image.Lehman, David - Interview 'The Art of Poetry' Paris Review no 73 Summer 1996 Many readers and critics have noted Ammons's idiosyncratic approach to punctuation. Lehman has written that Ammons \\"bears out T. S. Eliot's observation that poetry is a 'system of punctuation'.\\" Instead of periods, some poems end with an ellipsis; others have no terminal punctuation at all. The colon is an Ammons \\"signature\\"; he uses it \\"as an all-purpose punctuation mark.\\" According to critic Stephanie Burt, in many poems Ammons combines three types of diction: Such a mixture is nearly unique, Burt says; these three modes are \\"almost never found together outside his poems\\". In contrast, critic J. Mark Smith notes that in long poems such as Garbage, with their \\"improvised, no-stopping, 'one-time event' compositional procedures,\\" \\"Ammons works with a continuum of utterance whose central furrows are the most frequently repeated words and phrases in the contemporary American vulgate, but whose far outcastings register the faintest traces of anomalous use.\\" That is, Ammons subjected his own poetic style and its relation to contemporary speech to considerable scrutiny. As Smith puts it, \\"Ammons's premise is that the process of sorting and grouping (or abstracting) that produces what we commonly call 'garbage' also powers the appearances, disappearances, and re-appearances of words.\\" Bibliography =Poetry= *Ommateum, with Doxology.

He began exploratory excavations on the mound at Hisarlik (the site of the ancient city of Troy), seven years before the arrival of Heinrich Schliemann.  Biography  Frank was the youngest of seven children born to James Calvert (1778‚Äì1852), of Malta, and Louisa Ann Lander (1792‚Äì1867). Calvert was raised in Malta, at that time a British naval base. He was overshadowed by his elder siblings and became involved with the careers of his elder, more flamboyant brothers. He remained unmarried, and had an enduring passion for the Homeric epics and a firm belief that the myths were history, not fiction. As early as 1822, Hisarlik was identified by Charles Maclaren as a possible site of Homeric Troy.Hisarlƒ±k ‚Äì Britannica Online Encyclopedia at www.britannica.com In 1847, his brother Frederick bought a farm of over 2,000 acres (8 km¬≤) at Akca Koy which included part of Mount Hisarlik. This was to be a momentous acquisition. Frank continued to support his brothers' careers. In 1855, while Frederick was completely engrossed in affairs related to the Crimean War, Frank continued to produce the bulk of official consular correspondence in French and English. On occasion in 1856 and 1858, Frank stood in for Frederick as acting British consul. After standing in for his brother James, Frank eventually succeeded him as United States consular agent in 1874, an unpaid position that he held for the rest of his life. Occasionally, he served on local mixed European and Turkish tribunals, assuming from time to time the title of acting British consul. Apart from performing his consular duties, Calvert carried on careful, exploratory excavations on the family-owned land which incorporated the mound of Hisarlik. He was convinced that this was the site of the ancient city of Troy, but in 1908 he died and was never officially associated with the discovery of Troy. In a twist of fate, descendants of the Calvert brothers are now pursuing claims to the treasure recovered from Hisarlik.  Troy  In the field of archaeology, Calvert has been a mere shadow compared to his partner Heinrich Schliemann, who was later accused of manipulating and taking advantage of Calvert. Schliemann had a significantly larger budget than Calvert, and frequently used it to his advantage. Calvert was also shy about his educational experience because he was self-taught. At an early age he began visiting ancient sites, understanding different cultures and learning how they lived. In his teens he visited sites such as Corfu, Athens, Egypt, Brindisi and others, but he mostly stayed in the Troad, the region of Asia Minor believed to have been under Trojan rule. At the time Schliemann began excavating in Turkey, the site commonly believed to be Troy was at Pƒ±narba≈üƒ±, a hilltop at the south end of the Trojan Plain. Schliemann performed soundings at Pƒ±narba≈üƒ±, but was disappointed by his findings. Schliemann did not know where to look for Troy and was about to give up his exploration altogether. It was not until Calvert suggested excavating the mound of Hissarlik that Schliemann made any moves to dig at the site. Calvert had already searched in the mound, but he never made it down to the Bronze Age layers; still, he was determined Troy was buried somewhere within the mound.Sture Linn√©r, \\"Europas Ungtid\\" (Wahlstr√∂m och Widstrand), 2002 Schliemann and Calvert found not only the possible site of Troy but thousands of artefacts such as diadems of woven gold, rings, bracelets, intricate earrings and necklaces, buttons, belts and brooches as well as anthropomorphic figures, bowls and vessels for perfumed oils. In 1996 American and British heirs to Calvert sought ownership of a portion of the treasure found by Schliemann on Calvert's land (Calvert only owned half the mound). Media Calvert's work on Troy is mentioned in the 1985 BBC TV series In Search of the Trojan War, written and presented by Michael Wood.

It first aired on Comedy Central April 23, 2003. In the episode, Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny start a Junior Detective's Club and are soon recruited by the Park County police department, naming them \\"junior deputies\\". However, the boys soon find out that being real detectives isn't as fun as they thought. Plot Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny decide to play detective; they go around the town solving minor \\"crimes\\" for a dollar. They first investigate the disappearance of a pie left sitting on the windowsill of an elderly couple's home. After examining the scene of the crime, they come to the conclusion (based on no evidence at all) that the husband planned to murder and dismember his wife to have the pie for himself; however, before he could go through with the plan, the pie had already been eaten by their dog, where the boys found it. Horrified by their outrageous accusations, the couple hurriedly send them away, but not before giving them the dollar they had promised. The boys' next case involves the recovery of a little girl's stolen doll. After bringing Butters in for \\"questioning\\" and ordering him produce a semen sample, they get a tip-off that Bill and Fosse have the doll. They manage to recover the doll from them, despite the interference of another group of kids playing FBI who attempt to assert jurisdictional privilege and take over the case. The successful recovery gets the boys recognized by the Park County PD, and they are made Junior Detectives. However, Lieutenant Dawson, the department's head detective, immediately orders them to bust a meth lab, complaining that that mayor has been pressuring the department to take care of it. Ignorant as to the nature of a meth lab and naive to any danger, Stan knocks on the door of the lab and simply calls out, \\"Uh, police. Open up.\\" The criminals open fire at the \\"police,\\" but end up killing themselves, destroying the lab, and causing a great deal of property damage to the surrounding area. Following this incident, Dawson chews the boys out for 'getting careless'. Meanwhile, other detectives mock the boys, and it is revealed that many of the cops on the force are corrupt. After a confrontation in the locker room, Kyle and Cartman admit they no longer want to \\"play Detective\\" and suggest they return to playing laundromat owners. Stan passionately counters that he wasn't happy playing laundromat and wants his play time to \\"mean something.\\" The boys agree not to quit, and rededicate themselves to the force. The boys are next sent to a strip club owned by Gino, the leader of Colorado's largest drug cartel, which operated the original meth lab. Gino and the cartel members quickly discover that the boys are undercover cops, and another intense shoot-out ensues. Once again, despite their only weapons being finger guns and yelling \\"bang bang,\\" the boys remain unharmed while nearly all of the criminals are shot or killed, while outside Lieutenant Dawson starts chewing the real FBI for arriving and taking over the situation. Three cops show up to give the boys backup, but it is revealed that two of them, Murphy and Jenkins, are working with Gino. They shoot Hopkins, the one good cop who earlier defended the boys, though he survives. Murphy and Jenkins turn on Gino and kill him, so that they can take his share of the money. However, Murphy then kills Jenkins, claiming that he was untrustworthy. Turning to the boys, Murphy announces that the only person he now cannot trust is himself, and commits suicide. The rest of the force arrives, and the boys are credited by Dawson with cleaning up the police force and are offered positions as full detectives. The boys, however, find the reality of detective work more intense than what they envisioned, and decide to go back to playing laundromat instead. As they play in Cartman's basement, Butters emerges from the bathroom and proudly announces that he was finally able to produce a semen sample by imagining Stan's mom's breasts. The boys inform him that they aren't playing detective anymore, and no longer need a semen sample. Cartman, though, offers Butters to have his pants cleaned for $4.95. Production The episode is a parody of crime drama shows like CSI. On the DVD commentary, Trey Parker said that the episode is based on his childhood, where he had a desk and a rolodex in his parents basement and played Jr. detective. Home release \\"Lil' Crime Stoppers\\", along with the fourteen other episodes from The Complete Seventh Season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on March 21, 2006. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode. IGN gave the season an 8/10.

Titanic is a British-American 1979 television movie that depicts the doomed 1912 maiden voyage from the perspective of three distinct groups of passengers in First, Second, and Third Class. The script was written by James Costigan and directed by William Hale (credited as Billy Hale). It is the first Titanic film filmed and released in color. First Class passengers include a May‚ÄìDecember couple, multi-millionaire John Jacob Astor IV (David Janssen) and his new wife Madeleine Talmage Force (Beverly Ross); their friend, Molly Brown (Cloris Leachman); another pair of honeymooners, Daniel and Mary Marvin (Jerry Houser and Deborah Fallender); and Benjamin Guggenheim (John Moffatt), returning to his wife and children after a scandalous affair. One plot line relates the tentative shipboard romance of two schoolteachers, Lawrence Beesley (David Warner, later appearing in the James Cameron 1997 film Titanic) and the fictional Leigh Goodwin (Susan Saint James). In steerage, the plot focuses on the experiences of eight Irish immigrants, who are first depicted approaching the ship from a tender in the harbor of Queenstown (now Cobh), Ireland. These characters, all based on real people, include Katie Gilnagh (played by Shevaun Bryers), Kate Mullens, Mary Agatha Glynn, Bridget Bradley, Daniel Buckley, Jim Farrell, Martin Gallagher, and David Chartens. During the voyage, Martin Gallagher falls for an unnamed \\"Irish beauty.\\" The cast also includes Helen Mirren in a small role (as Mary Sloan, a real-life surviving Titanic stewardess) early in her career. Themes One of the film's major themes is class distinctions. Second Class passengers Beesley and Goodwin discuss their ambiguous position \\"in the middle\\" and debate whether class distinctions are uniquely British. Goodwin briefly encourages Beesley to pursue his apparent attraction to a young Irish beauty in Third Class, but he rejects this advice. The Third Class passengers, mostly from poor backgrounds, do not show any resentment at their meager accommodation‚ÄîKatie Gilnagh comments that sleeping four-to-a-room is far more comfortable than the situation she experienced in her overcrowded childhood home‚Äîbut on the night of the sinking, they struggle to evade the efforts of ship's personnel to keep them below decks and away from the lifeboats. Led by Jim Farrell, they successfully sneak up to the First Class restaurant, where Farrell persuades the Master-at-Arms to allow the women‚Äîbut only the women‚Äîto pass up to the boat deck. Another major theme is the happy, hectic atmosphere aboard ship. Young Mary Marvin comments that many of the First Class passengers are honeymooners, and that she does not want to land, but simply to go on sailing and dancing forever. In much simpler surroundings, the Third Class passengers also engage in music, dancing, winning, and whirlwind romances. Meanwhile, Beesley and Goodwin toy with the possibility of embarking on an illicit affair in an empty cabin but decide not to. Goodwin comments that shipboard romances, like shipboard friendships, are meant to end with the voyage. A third theme is who deserved, or accepted, responsibility for the wrecking of the RMS Titanic. Captain Edward Smith, a veteran White Star captain nearing retirement, is depicted as a masterful leader who nevertheless failed to slow down in spite of being well aware that he was traveling into ice-laden waters. Shipbuilder Thomas Andrews radiates an almost saintly quality, seeing to the final details of construction and repairs himself, tenderly looking after passengers and crew, and even conversing with a young stewardess about their common hometown of Belfast. He fully understands the implications of the collision, and his knowledge that he cannot save the ship clearly breaks his heart. Meanwhile, White Star Line director J. Bruce Ismay wavers between a stance of command and an unwillingness to take responsibility for the sinking. Identifying himself as a passenger, he defiantly boards a lifeboat, only to experience a nervous breakdown later aboard the R.M.S. Carpathia rescuing ship. Ismay is the only one of these three men who survives, and it is clear that he will never fully recover from the psychological effects and blow to his reputation from the fabled sinking. Principal differences with other film versions The film includes roles on RMA Carpathia (particularly the radio operator, Harold Cottam) and shows this ship more fully than other film versions. It shows survivors going onto the Carpathia. The seascape is shown heavy with ice floes. Rather than the sacred \\"Nearer, My God, to Thee\\", the ship band plays jaunty, secular ragtime tunes by Scott Joplin. Survivors discuss the silence of the disappearance of the ship and absence of screaming. Several philosophise regarding their losses.

Los Angeles Times 6 May 1979: se_a1. =Locations= RMS Queen Mary, which in the movie was partly used as the RMS Titanic Several of the scenes on the exterior decks, as well as those in the ship's wheelhouse, were filmed on board the later British ocean liner from the 1930s, the retired RMS Queen Mary in Long Beach, California. Some interior scenes were filmed at the Waldorf and Adelphi historic hotels in London and Liverpool, respectively. The town of Peel on the Isle of Man served as the Queenstown backdrop. Some external shots were filmed aboard, and of, the TSS Manxman which also appears as the R.M.S. Carpathia in some of the opening sequences and as the R.M.S. Titanic in a few shipboard scenes. Versions *S.O.S. Titanic was originally broadcast as a television film on ABC on September 23, 1979. It ran for 3 hours, or approximately 144 minutes, excluding commercials.

During its run it was hosted by Dave Aizer, Jonah Travick and Jessica Holmes and produced/directed by Jason Harper. It was located outside (inside if either weather did not permit, or the outdoor area had become too messy from earlier in the day) of the former Nickelodeon Studios at Universal Studios Florida (the third-to-last show to do so). It mainly aired as filler during regular commercial time. The show holds two Guinness World Records - most people pied in three minutes (1000, in 2001), and most people slimed (762, on the finale). The sliming was done outdoors, in front of the studios. Sliming The show was known to have slimed their audience; when they did this they would pick someone, sit them in a chair, and ask them a question. If they answered correctly, they would get a bucket of slime (eventually changed to two buckets, then three) poured on top of them. Pieing The show was also known to have their audience members, contestants, hosts (notably Jessica), celebrity guests, and staff caught on- camera pied in the face. When it was cancelled, Nick's pieing trademark was forgotten. It was later revived through the Nick-themed resort and cruise line. Interactive games During the show, viewers would phone in to play interactive games with players on the show. The most common game was to make a match of Nicktoons from off of a Tic-tac-toe grid. The board was scrambled before game play and if a match was made, the home player would win a prize and the contestant would be slimed and often pied as well. If they did not make a match, host Dave Aizer would receive a pie in the face. Later when the mystery bucket was introduced, if no match was made, only the mystery bucket would drop on the player. In addition to Nicktoons, the board included a pie tile (the contestant would shove the pie they are holding in their face), a \\"cream blaster\\" tile (where the contestant would be blasted with whipped-cream by the two side cannons), a bonus tile (where the home player gets another try) and an \\"instant slime\\" tile or a wild card (which triggered an automatic match, an instant sliming & an instant win). On some occasions, an overload of slime is used. And slime-u-lator 2.0 where they have to hand pedal and slime in the red blue bins can travel upward through the yellow tubes into those two bins and filling the plastic tubes with slime and one bins with high point will fall down to which team and which team gets slime from one those bins is filled they‚Äôll win and move on to big shaboozie showdown round. More interactive games would be played as the run progressed. Many celebrities from other Nick shows appeared often. =The Big Shaboozie= First known as \\"Super Sloppy Slime-Off,\\" The Big Shaboozie was the show's end game. Below are changes made, over the years, to it while the show was on-air. 2000/01 In \\"Super Sloppy Slime-Off,\\" two out of three teams (each team had three contestants), Jessica led one team and Jonah led the other, would stand under a trough filled with slime. Dave would ask a Nick-related question, if one of the in-house players answered the question, one of the contestants from the home player's team would be pied by their team leader; if they answered wrong, a contestant from the opposing team would be pied by their team leader. The team to have all three of their members pied would be slimed and (along with the home player) receive a grand prize. 2002 Renamed \\"The Big Shaboozie,\\" changes to the game included Dave asking Nick-related questions on the given topic (instead of random questions); all players would now wear goggles during the game‚Äîwhether it was getting pied, slimed, etc. -- in addition to getting slimed (they often got slimed with other substances besides that), the members of the winning team would be blasted (front and back) with whipped cream. =Changes unrelated to the game= *The logo has been changed. *An audience member would introduce the game. 2003 This time, there are only two players on each team. Each team takes turns deciding which number to pick on a Tic-tac-Toe board; if one team finds \\"The Big Shaboozie\\" they will win the game, but if they find \\"The Whammy,\\" the opposing team wins. =Changes unrelated to the game= *The logo has been changed. *An audience member introducing the game would be pied.

Nickelodeon had tried to gain young viewers in that time through this, but ratings declined shortly thereafter. The show would often \\"connect\\" (Florida to New York) with U-Pick Live, which would replace it later in the year. On the grand finale, the show broke the world record for most people slimed at one time. Friday Night Slimetime One year after the show's cancellation, Friday Night Slimetime premiered on Nickelodeon, but unlike the original version, its segments were prerecorded. It lasted for two back to back seasons and was hosted by Lil' JJ and Chloe Dolandis (who had previously hosted Splat! on Nickelodeon). Nickelodeon had a talent hold on Lil' JJ and was forced to give him a show to finish out his contract. Because of this, Dave Aizer was brought on board as a writer and also occasionally announced the prizes. The most common prizes on it were either a bicycle or athletic balls. This ran from September 23, 2005 to March 24, 2006.

Career Born in 1896, Fritz von Scholz served in World War I with the Austro-Hungarian Army in 1914. Discharged from the army in 1919, Scholz was a member of the paramilitary Freikorps since 1921. He joined the Austrian branch of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in 1932 (Nr. 1304071), and then the Austrian SA. Following his involvement in street violence, Scholz fled to Nazi Germany in late 1933 to avoid arrest. He joined the SS in 1937 (Nr. 135638), serving with the Austrian SS Legion. Scholtz started World War II as a battalion commander in the SS- Regiment Der F√ºhrer, taking part in the Western campaign of 1940 and later taking command of the SS Regiment Nordland, which in 1941 became part of a new SS Division Wiking. Attached to Army Group South, the division took Tarnopol in Galicia in late June, 1941. In early 1943, he took command of first 1 SS Infantry Brigade, attached to Army Group Centre, then 2 SS Infantry Brigade composed of mostly Latvian recruits, under Army Group North. On 20 April, Scholz was appointed commander of a new SS Division Nordland. The division was soon moved to Croatia where it saw action against Yugoslav partisans. In January 1944, the division was transferred to the Oranienbaum front near Leningrad and attached to the III SS Panzer Corps under Army Group North. The division retreated to Narva and participated in the battles for the Narva bridgehead. Scholz was awarded the Oakleaves to the Knight's Cross on 12 March 1944. In late July, after the launch of the Soviet Narva Offensive, the Corps retreated from the city of Narva and the Narva river in general, to the Tannenberg defences at the Sinim√§ed Hills. On 27 July 1944, Scholz was wounded in an artillery barrage and died the next day. He was posthumously awarded the Swords to the Knight's Cross on 8 August 1944.

After the March on Rome, he continued his political activities and became a major political force in Mussolini's administration until 1943. Along with Alfredo Rocco and Giuseppe Bottai, Rossoni is considered to have played a large role in the development of Italy's Fascist State. His program of corporativismo integrale was seen as a \\"cosmetically altered version of sindacalismo integrale\\" that was to assist in the transformation of Italy into a \\"Fascist syndicate\\" state.Franklin Hugh Adler, Italian Industrialists from Liberalism to Fascism: The political development of the industrial bourgeoisie, 1906‚Äì1934, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 349 Regarded as one of the founders of ‚ÄúFascist syndicalism‚Äù,Zeev Sternhell, The Birth of Fascist Ideology, Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 189 Rossoni had learned in the United States to distrust both the capitalists and various orthodox socialist movements that urged internationalism, recalling his conversion to social nationalism at the first congress of Fascist unions in June 1922: > We have seen our workers exploited and held in low regard not only by the > capitalists but also by the revolutionary comrades of other countries. We > therefore know from experience how internationalism is nothing but fiction > and hypocrisy.‚ÄùDavid D. Roberts, The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian > Fascism, University of North Carolina Press, 1979, p. 108 One of Rossoni‚Äôs first syndicalist ventures in Italy was helping to found the Unione Italiana del Lavoro (UIL) in June 1918. With some support of Mussolini‚Äôs Italian Fasces, he led the occupation of the Franchi e Gregorini steelworks plant in Dalmine in March 1919 under the tricolor Italian flag in contrast to the red flag.Franklin Hugh Adler, Italian Industrialists from Liberalism to Fascism: The political development of the industrial bourgeoisie, 1906‚Äì1934, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 212Ferdinando Cordova, Le origini dei sindacati fascisti, (Bari: Laterza, 1974, p. 16 Fascist syndicates in Italy Considered a firebrand on labor and corporatist issues, Rossoni became the secretary-general of the Confederation of National Syndicates in January 1922, which went through a series of merges and negotiations and ended up renamed the General Confederation of Fascist Syndical Corporations by December 1922.Martin Blinkhorn, edit., Fascists and Conservatives: The Radical Right and the Establishment in Twentieth-Century Europe, chap. 2: Roland Sarti, ‚ÄúItalian fascism: radical politics and conservative goals,‚Äù London/New York, Routledge, 2001, pp. 22‚Äì23 He also helped launch a Fascist trade union journal in March 1922, Il lavoro d‚ÄôItalia, which was renamed Il lavoro fascista in the wake of Rossoni‚Äôs reorganization of the fascist syndicate movement in 1928.David D. Roberts, The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism, University of North Carolina Press, 1979, p. 370 With state backing, Rossoni greatly expanded membership in the Fascist Syndicate, where membership rose from 250,000 to 1.8 million between 1920 and 1924, surpassing every other labor organization.Martin Blinkhorn, edit., Fascists and Conservatives: The Radical Right and the Establishment in Twentieth-Century Europe, chap. 2: Roland Sarti, ‚ÄúItalian fascism: radical politics and conservative goals,‚Äù London/New York, Routledge, 2001, p. 23 By 1924 Rossoni‚Äôs Fascist Syndicate had even more members than the National Fascist Party, which claimed only 650,000 members. The high numbers of members alarmed Fascist party leaders who were determined to keep Rossoni‚Äôs power somehow checked. Seeking to control the revolutionary direction of Fascist movement, Rossoni made it clear that Fascist syndicalism should be at the forefront, proclaiming in Mussolini‚Äôs Il Popolo d'Italia newspaper that ‚Äúonly the Fascist syndicates could complete the revolution.‚Äù.Martin Blinkhorn, edit., Fascists and Conservatives: The radical Right and the Establishment in Twentieth-Century Europe, chap. 2: Roland Sarti, ‚ÄúItalian fascism: radical politics and conservative goals,‚Äù London/New York, Routledge, 2001, p. 23.

Such a monopoly was finally institutionalized under Alfredo Rocco's syndical law of April 3, 1926 that \\"legally authorized the fascist syndicates' monopoly over worker representation.\\"Simonetta Falasca-Zamponi, Fascist Spectacle: The Aesthetics of Power in Mussolini's Italy, 1997, p. 131 The Fascist syndicates became the sole representatives of labor.

Roberts, The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism, University of North Carolina Press, 1979, p. 290 Other historians have suggested that Fascist party leaders were attempting to clip Rossoni‚Äôs power base since his fascist syndicate sought ‚Äúconcrete provisions on labor contracts, minimum salaries, working hours and terms for employment,‚Äù positions that employers were usually unwilling to accept.Franklin Hugh Adler, Italian Industrialists from Liberalism to Fascism: The political development of the industrial bourgeoisie, 1906‚Äì1934, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 391 Later years Despite being forced to resign from the leadership of the General Confederation of Fascist Syndical Corporations, Rossoni continued to serve in Mussolini‚Äôs administration in a number of capacities; a member of the Fascist Grand Council, 1930‚Äì43, undersecretary of state, 1932‚Äì35, and minister of agriculture and forestry 1935‚Äì39.Roland Sarti, Italy: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present, New York, NY, Facts on File, Inc., 2004, p. 534 In his capacity as minister of agriculture and forestry, Rossoni ordered the replanning and reconstruction of his native town of Tresigallo along rationalist lines, intending to transform it into a \\"new town\\" of Italy. Rossoni made himself famous on July 25, 1943, by voting against Mussolini's leadership inside the Grand Council (thus siding with the coup d'√©tat initiated by Dino Grandi). When Mussolini regained power in northern Italy, creating the Italian Social Republic, Rossoni was sentenced to death in absentia. After escaping to Canada, he returned to Italy in 1947 when his sentence had been commuted to life imprisonment.

At first they kept their faith secret because Fatima's brother Umar was a prominent persecutor of Muslims. Khabbab ibn al-Aratt often visited their house and read the Qur'an to Fatima. One day Umar entered their house while Khabbab was reading and demanded to know what the \\"balderdash\\" was. When they denied that anything had been read, Umar seized Sa'id and knocked him to the floor. Fatima stood up to defend her husband, and Umar hit her so hard that she bled. The couple admitted that they were Muslims. At the sight of the blood, Umar was sorry for what he had done, and asked to see what they had been reading. It was Ta-Ha, later to become the twentieth Surah of the Qur'an. Impressed by the beauty of the words, Umar decided to become a Muslim. Emigration to Medina Sa'id joined the general emigration to Medina in 622 and at first lodged in the house of Rifa'a ibn Abdul-Mundhir. He was made the brother in Islam of Rafi ibn Malik of the Zurayq clan; but an alternative tradition names his brother in Islam as Talha ibn Ubaydallah. Sa'id and Talha missed the Battle of Badr because Muhammad sent them ahead as scouts to report on the movements of Abu Sufyan's caravan. When they heard that they had missed the caravan, they returned to Medina, only to find that Muhammad and his army had already reached Badr. They set out for Badr and met the returning victorious army at Turban. However, Muhammad gave them a share of the Maal e Ganimat (spoils of war) as if they had been present. Sa'id participated in all the other battles in which Muhammad personally fought. He served as Muhammad's secretary and recorded the verses of the Quran.  During the time of the Caliphs  Once he was appointed Governor of Damascus without his consent. He wrote to Abu ‚ÄòUbayda, \\"I am unable to offer such a sacrifice. You will perform Jihad while I will be deprived of it. Please send someone else to replace me as soon as you receive this letter. I am coming to you soon.\\" Later, he fought as an ordinary soldier in all the battles of the Islamic army. In the time of Muawiyah I he was Governor of Kufa.  Death  He died in 671 AD (51 AH) during the reign of Muawiyah I at al-Aqiq. His body was carried back to Medina and buried there by Sa\`d ibn Abi Waqqas and Abdullah ibn Umar. Sa'id said that Muhammad once guaranteed Paradise to ten men who were then present and named nine of them. Then he hinted that the tenth man had been himself.Abu Dawud 40:4632.

It originally aired on December 4, 2002 and is rated TV-MA in the United States. In the episode, a man claiming to be Stan's future self shows up to his house. Stan's future self is an unemployed drug addict, but Stan suspects that it is a hoax put on by his parents, while South Park's own little entrepreneur, Eric Cartman, is at the helm of a new money-making venture, and Cartman is in the business of revenge.  Plot  The children have found a joint that has been left behind by the high schoolers. They are afraid, because according to commercials you die when you touch it and marijuana causes terrorism. Stan is not afraid and throws away the joint. That night, in the middle of a thunderstorm, a man claiming to be an older version of Stan appears at the Marsh family's door. This future Stan has spent time in juvenile hall, used large amounts of drugs and alcohol, which Stan decides must have begun when he first touched the marijuana cigarette. He is convinced that the only way to safeguard his future is for his present self to avoid drugs and alcohol, do well in school, and stay motivated in life. Stan even asks Butters to tutor him. While the two boys are talking, Stan discovers that Butters also has a slovenly \\"Future Self\\" living with him. Stan finds the whole situation suspicious, and the two find an employee card in the \\"future\\" Stan's personal effects labelled \\"Motivation Corp.\\" leading them to finding out it is where parents hire actors to pose as their children's future self to make them avoid drugs and alcohol. Stan is appalled at the way these parents have all deceived their children and he and Butters decide to look in the phone book to find a place to run away to. However, they discover a \\"Parental Revenge Center\\" hotline with guaranteed results, which is run by Cartman who agrees to help the two. However, Cartman's revenge plan for both boys involves going to both of their houses to smear all of the walls with feces. Butters is delighted by this offer and gladly accepts it, while Stan believes that it isn't adequate payback. Cartman then tries to convince Stan by taking it up a notch and offering to kill his parents and slice them into pieces. Stan refuses this offer as well, and decides to worm the truth out of his parents himself in order to force them to acknowledge that they lied to him. Stan tries to get the truth out of his parents by pretending to cut off his own hand so that his future self's hand would also come off as a way of seeing if he really is Stan's future self, but Randy improvises by deliberately cutting off the actor's hand after doing so. Though Stan reveals that he didn't actually cut his hand off at all, Randy ends up pretending that the actor's hand has never been cut off while trying to attach it back on him, causing Stan to storm out of his home in frustration. Meanwhile, the Parental Revenge Agency does its job at Butters' house as Cartman and a group of Hispanic day workers smear feces all over the living room and bedroom of the Stotch household. Upon returning home, Chris and Linda actually acknowledge that they deserve it for lying and finally tell the truth about the \\"future self\\" thing and apologize to Butters. Randy and Sharon Marsh arrive and continue blatantly lying to Stan, insisting that more future selves must be coming back in time to the present, which finally causes Stan to snap and tell them that he knows all about Motivation Corp., and that he was trying to get them to admit they lied to him. Randy and Sharon come to the realization that if they just keep lying to him, he might not ever trust them again; Randy finally apologizes to Stan and gives him the whole truth about drug abuse, saying that it probably won't kill him or fund terrorism but still may ruin his future. Stan adds he really wishes they had just told him that in the first place instead of lying to him. The Stotches and Marshes then all agree that what Motivation Corp. does is wrong, and hires Cartman to smear their walls with feces. At that point, Stan thanks Cartman, saying that he really came through. Cartman says that the whole experience has taught him that he should think about his own future and start taking better care of himself. Moments later, a thin and handsome man, claiming to be Cartman's future self, shows up and tells Cartman that this was the turning point in his life. From this day forward, he turns his life around, and will become the famous CEO of a time-traveling company. Cartman is not convinced, believing it to be yet another Motivation Corp. actor and immediately changes his mind, vowing to do \\"whatever I want!\\" from then on, which includes eating unhealthy and doing drugs. As it turns out, the man really is Cartman's future self and immediately changes into a dirty, morbidly obese mechanic. Future Cartman then exclaims, \\"Oh, goddamn it!\\" Theme The episode delivers a direct anti-drug message while simultaneously poking fun at all the anti-drug commercials and propaganda that were airing during most teen and young adult oriented television blocks at the time (specifically, the dubious claims many were making about the consequences of marijuana use). In the DVD commentary, Parker and Stone stated that they were inspired to do the episode after seeing an advertisement by The Partnership For A Drug-Free America which linked marijuana use to terrorism. Parker stated that they had originally intended for the episode to include a spoof of the commercial but decided against it when they could not think of anything more ridiculous than saying, \\"If you smoke pot, you become a terrorist\\". Butters' \\"Future Self\\" only watches Becker, a series the young Butters finds \\"stupid\\". Home release \\"My Future Self 'n' Me\\", along with the sixteen other episodes from South Park's sixth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on October 11, 2005. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode. IGN gave the season a rating of 9/10.

History The hospital traces its history back to the first colonial hospital, which was established in a tent on Garden Island, just off the coast of Western Australia, in 1829. In June 1830, the hospital tent was re-erected in Cathedral Avenue, Perth. From 1833 a more substantial colonial hospital operated for a short time from a rented room in a private house. Six years later, in December 1840, this was re-opened in a building formerly used as stables on the corner of St Georges Terrace and Irwin Street. The hospital commenced operations on the corner of Murray Street and Victoria Square on 14 July 1855, and was formally named the Colonial Hospital. In the years since, it has expanded north to Wellington Street. It has been known variously as the Perth Public Hospital, the Perth Hospital and finally, from 1946, as Royal Perth Hospital. = Future = Initial plans in 2005 were to close down operations at RPH in response to the opening of Fiona Stanley Hospital;WA Health Infrastructure Development - Projects www.health.wa.gov.au. Retrieved 2007-02-10. however, the Western Australian government's South Metropolitan Services have changed plans since. The main campus on Wellington Street will retain its role as a major adult trauma centre and centre for complex surgeries. The Shenton Park campus (a tertiary rehabilitation centre) has closed down and rehabilitation services moved to Fiona Stanley Hospital. Facilities Royal Perth Hospital. Visible buildings are Colonial House (left) and South Block behind Royal Perth Hospital employs over 6000 people and sees over 70,000 patients each year. Some of the services offered are imaging, trauma and neurosciences, a wide variety of surgical options, critical and emergency care, dermatology, internal medicine, and haematology. As well as providing a comprehensive array of medical services for adults, Royal Perth exists as a teaching hospital, having close associations with Western Australia's four major universities and TAFE institutions. This allows tertiary institutions to provide practical, professional education opportunities and ensures Royal Perth has well-trained and capable staff. Royal Perth also fosters relationships with WA's other hospitals, including Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Fiona Stanley Hospital and Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, ensuring all services are available to inpatients, even if RPH doesn't provide them itself. Research The head of research at Royal Perth Hospital is Professor Peter Leedman, and RPH is a leading researcher into both patient recovery and improvements in staff practices. RPH shares its campus with several other major research foundations, including the Western Australian Institute for Medical Research, ensuring several research projects are taking place at any one time. The high standing of RPH researchers is demonstrated by their significant contribution to the annals of international scientific literature each year. In 1998, a total of 158 articles and 114 abstracts were published in refereed medical, nursing and scientific journals. In addition, staff presented a total of 190 papers at national and international professional conferences.  Shenton Park  The Royal Perth Rehabilitation Hospital was first established as an isolation tent hospital in the bush at Shenton Park during the outbreak of smallpox in April 1893. This hospital, variously known as the Isolation Hospital, the Victoria Hospital, the Infectious Diseases Branch and finally as the Royal Perth Rehabilitation Hospital, commenced its role as a major rehabilitation hospital with the rehabilitation of polio patients following the epidemic of 1948-56.  Personalities  Several well-known practitioners and medical researchers have worked at Royal Perth Hospital over the years, including Dr Fiona Wood, winner of the 2005 Australian of the Year Award, and Professor Barry Marshall and Dr Robin Warren, winners of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology. The Royal Perth Hospital motto is \\"Servio\\". The hospital logo is based on the arms of the City of Perth and was first introduced in 1935. It comprises the St George's Cross on a white shield with a black swan in the top left canton and a banner inscribed with the word \\"Servio\\".

It is the first installment in the Dylan bootleg series, comprising material spanning the first three decades of his career, from 1961 to 1989. It has been certified with a gold record by the RIAA as of August 1997, and peaked at on the Billboard 200 and in the UK.RIAA website retrieved 02-12-10. Background Dylan has been subject to bootleg recordings throughout his career; the first bootleg of the rock era, Great White Wonder, consisted of pirate recordings drawn from various sources. With the approach of Dylan's 30-year mark in the record industry, Columbia Records initiated the proper release of material that had circulated regularly on Dylan bootlegs, starting with this box set in 1991 to satisfy demand for Dylan's unissued material. Content The Bootleg Series Volumes 1‚Äì3 contains rarities and unreleased works from the sessions for 1962's eponymous debut Bob Dylan to 1989's Oh Mercy. Of the 58 total tracks, 45 are session outtakes from recording sessions for Dylan studio albums. Of the remaining 13 tracks, one is an outtake from the session for the \\"George Jackson\\" single of 1971, two are further releases from the Basement Tape sessions of 1967, five are live recordings, and five are demo records, three of latter being later duplicated on Volume 9 of the series. The material is spread across three compact discs, five vinyl records, or three cassette tapes. In the case of the compact disc and cassette versions, each individual disc or cassette is labeled in the set as a distinct volume. Subsequent albums in the Bootleg Series were standardized to a double- disc volume in their primary non-limited edition format, excepting for Volumes 14 and 15, and all continue the compact disc volume numbering. Unlike ensuing installments in the series, none of Volumes 1‚Äì3 are available individually in physical form. A remastered version in smaller packaging was issued on August 19, 1997, on Legacy Recordings, the reissue imprint of Sony Records. Reception Reviews of this set were generally positive, with exceptions. Robert Christgau gives it only cursory assessment on his website.Robert Christgau Consumer Guide website retrieved 12 November 2017. In his 2006 Bob Dylan Encyclopedia, author Michael Gray states that \\"most artists couldn't muster a single outtake to hold alongside any of this; Dylan can provide 58 recordings almost every one of which is of numinous excellence.\\"Gray, Michael. The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia. Continuum International Publishing: London, 2006, , p. 73. As of February 2020, a dozen further installments in this series have been released.

The pieces avoid the lead- time of manufacturing custom pieces, and of requiring special training or design time to construct complex systems. This makes them suitable for temporary structures, or for use as children's toys. One very popular brand is Lego. Categories Construction sets can be categorized according to their connection method and geometry: * Struts of variable length that are connected to any point along another strut, and at nodes. ** Tesseract connection points are initially flexible but can be made rigid with the addition of clips. * Struts of fixed but multiple lengths that are connected by nodes are good for building space frames, and often have components that allow full rotational freedom. **D8h (*228) nodes are used for K'Nex, Tinkertoys, Playskool Pipeworks, Cleversticks and interlocking disks in general. **D6h nodes are used for interlocking disks. **Ih (*532) nodes are used for Zometool * Panels of varying sizes and shapes ** Panels of varying sizes and shapes are connected by pins or screws perpendicular to the panels, which are good for building linkages such as an Erector Set, Mini Unit Beams Meccano, Merkur, Steel Tec, Lego Technic, Trix, FAC-System, and √úberstix ** Panels of varying sizes and shapes with flexible panels or hinges between panels such as Tog'l, Jovo Click 'N Construct, Zaks, and Polydron. * Struts and panels **Girder and Panel building sets **Synestructics (does not make pentagonal structures) **Ramagon (some panels include studs for connecting with Lego clones) **Geomag (components are magnetic) **Bayko * Building components with various methods of connection include: ** No connection: toy blocks, Anchor Stone Blocks, KEVA planks, Kapla, and Unit Bricks ** Studs: Engino, Rokenbok, Lego, Lego clone, Coco, Rasti, Tente, Mega Bloks, Fischertechnik, Playmobil, Loc Blocs, Cobi blocks, Betta Builda, Guangdong Loongon (and its subbrands: Cogo, Lepin, Xingboa) and Oxford, Kre-O. ** Notches: Lincoln Logs, GIK, and Stickle bricks ** Sleeves: Capsela *Spherical magnets Psychological benefits Construction toy play is beneficial for building social skills and building trust in others because it acts as a collaborative task where individuals have to cooperate in order to finish the task ‚Äî building an object out of Legos, for example. The effect was found in high school students. For children specifically, children who complete models using toy building blocks have much better spatial ability than children who do not complete such models. Spatial ability also predicts completion of models. Construction toy play is also beneficial for autistic children when both individual and group play with building blocks is incorporated. Autistic children who played with building blocks were motivated to initiate social contact with children their age, they were able to maintain and endure contact with those children, and autistic children were also able to surpass the barriers of being withdrawn and being highly structured.  Influence on architecture  Renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright credited his childhood building blocks designed by Friedrich Fr√∂bel as a major influence, and his son John Lloyd Wright created the widely known Lincoln Logs building set. In addition to teaching architectural concepts such as modularity and load-bearing construction, many architects credit construction set play as influencing their later design.

Point processes can be used as mathematical models of phenomena or objects representable as points in some type of space. There are different mathematical interpretations of a point process, such as a random counting measure or a random set. Some authors regard a point process and stochastic process as two different objects such that a point process is a random object that arises from or is associated with a stochastic process, though it has been remarked that the difference between point processes and stochastic processes is not clear. Others consider a point process as a stochastic process, where the process is indexed by sets of the underlying space on which it is defined, such as the real line or n-dimensional Euclidean space. Other stochastic processes such as renewal and counting processes are studied in the theory of point processes. Sometimes the term \\"point process\\" is not preferred, as historically the word \\"process\\" denoted an evolution of some system in time, so point process is also called a random point field. Point processes are well studied objects in probability theoryKallenberg, O. (1986). Random Measures, 4th edition.

Point processes on the real line form an important special case that is particularly amenable to study,Last, G., Brandt, A. (1995).Marked point processes on the real line: The dynamic approach. Probability and its Applications. Springer, New York. , because the points are ordered in a natural way, and the whole point process can be described completely by the (random) intervals between the points. These point processes are frequently used as models for random events in time, such as the arrival of customers in a queue (queueing theory), of impulses in a neuron (computational neuroscience), particles in a Geiger counter, location of radio stations in a telecommunication network or of searches on the world-wide web. General point process theory In mathematics, a point process is a random element whose values are \\"point patterns\\" on a set S. While in the exact mathematical definition a point pattern is specified as a locally finite counting measure, it is sufficient for more applied purposes to think of a point pattern as a countable subset of S that has no limit points. =Definition= To define general point processes, we start with a probability space (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal{F}, P), and a measurable space (S, \\\\mathcal{S}) where S is a locally compact second countable Hausdorff space and \\\\mathcal{S} is its Borel œÉ-algebra. Consider now an integer-valued locally finite kernel \\\\xi from (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal{F}) into (S, \\\\mathcal{S}), that is, a mapping \\\\Omega \\\\times \\\\mathcal{S} \\\\mapsto \\\\mathbb{Z}_{+} such that: # For every \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega, \\\\xi(\\\\omega, \\\\cdot) is a locally finite measure on S. # For every B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S}, \\\\xi(\\\\cdot, B): \\\\Omega \\\\mapsto \\\\mathbb{Z}_+ is a random variable over \\\\mathbb{Z}_+. This kernel defines a random measure in the following way. We would like to think of \\\\xi as defining a mapping which maps \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega to a measure \\\\xi_\\\\omega \\\\in \\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\mathcal{S}) (namely, \\\\Omega \\\\mapsto \\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\mathcal{S})), where \\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\mathcal{S}) is the set of all locally finite measures on S. Now, to make this mapping measurable, we need to define a \\\\sigma-field over \\\\mathcal{M}(\\\\mathcal{S}). This \\\\sigma-field is constructed as the minimal algebra so that all evaluation maps of the form \\\\pi_B: \\\\mu \\\\mapsto \\\\mu(B), where B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S} is relatively compact, are measurable. Equipped with this \\\\sigma-field, then \\\\xi is a random element, where for every \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega, \\\\xi_\\\\omega is a locally finite measure over S. Now, by a point process on S we simply mean an integer-valued random measure (or equivalently, integer-valued kernel) \\\\xi constructed as above. The most common example for the state space S is the Euclidean space Rn or a subset thereof, where a particularly interesting special case is given by the real half-line [0,‚àû). However, point processes are not limited to these examples and may among other things also be used if the points are themselves compact subsets of Rn, in which case Œæ is usually referred to as a particle process. It has been noted that the term point process is not a very good one if S is not a subset of the real line, as it might suggest that Œæ is a stochastic process. However, the term is well established and uncontested even in the general case. =Representation= Every instance (or event) of a point process Œæ can be represented as : \\\\xi=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\delta_{X_i}, where \\\\delta denotes the Dirac measure, n is an integer-valued random variable and X_i are random elements of S. If X_i's are almost surely distinct (or equivalently, almost surely \\\\xi(x) \\\\leq 1 for all x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d ), then the point process is known as simple. Another different but useful representation of an event (an event in the event space, i.e. a series of points) is the counting notation, where each instance is represented as an N(t) function, a continuous function which takes integer values: N:{\\\\mathbb R}\\\\rightarrow {\\\\mathbb Z^+}: : N(t_1, t_2)=\\\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\\\xi(t) dt which is the number of events in the observation interval (t_1,t_2]. It is sometimes shown as N_{t_1,t_2} and N_T or N(T) means N_{0,T}. =Expectation measure= The expectation measure EŒæ (also known as mean measure) of a point process Œæ is a measure on S that assigns to every Borel subset B of S the expected number of points of Œæ in B. That is, :E \\\\xi (B) := E \\\\bigl( \\\\xi(B) \\\\bigr) \\\\quad \\\\text{for every } B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B}. =Laplace functional= The Laplace functional \\\\Psi_{N}(f) of a point process N is a map from the set of all positive valued functions f on the state space of N, to [0,\\\\infty) defined as follows: : \\\\Psi_N(f)=E[\\\\exp(-N(f))] They play a similar role as the characteristic functions for random variable. One important theorem says that: two point processes have the same law if their Laplace functionals are equal. =Moment measure= The nth power of a point process, \\\\xi^n, is defined on the product space S^n as follows : : \\\\xi^n(A_1 \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times A_n) = \\\\prod_{i=1}^n \\\\xi(A_i) By monotone class theorem, this uniquely defines the product measure on (S^n,B(S^n)). The expectation E \\\\xi^n(\\\\cdot) is called the n th moment measure. The first moment measure is the mean measure. Let S = \\\\mathbb{R}^d . The joint intensities of a point process \\\\xi w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure are functions \\\\rho^{(k)} :(\\\\mathbb{R}^d)^k \\\\to [0,\\\\infty) such that for any disjoint bounded Borel subsets B_1,\\\\ldots,B_k : E\\\\left(\\\\prod_i \\\\xi(B_i)\\\\right) = \\\\int_{B_1 \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times B_k} \\\\rho^{(k)}(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_k) \\\\, dx_1\\\\cdots dx_k . Joint intensities do not always exist for point processes. Given that moments of a random variable determine the random variable in many cases, a similar result is to be expected for joint intensities. Indeed, this has been shown in many cases. =Stationarity= A point process \\\\xi \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^d is said to be stationary if \\\\xi + x := \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\delta_{X_i + x} has the same distribution as \\\\xi for all x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d. For a stationary point process, the mean measure E \\\\xi (\\\\cdot) = \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\ for some constant \\\\lambda \\\\geq 0 and where \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\ stands for the Lebesgue measure. This \\\\lambda is called the intensity of the point process. A stationary point process on \\\\mathbb{R}^d has almost surely either 0 or an infinite number of points in total. For more on stationary point processes and random measure, refer to Chapter 12 of Daley & Vere-Jones. Stationarity has been defined and studied for point processes in more general spaces than \\\\mathbb{R}^d. Examples of point processes We shall see some examples of point processes in \\\\mathbb{R}^d. =Poisson point process= The simplest and most ubiquitous example of a point process is the Poisson point process, which is a spatial generalisation of the Poisson process. A Poisson (counting) process on the line can be characterised by two properties : the number of points (or events) in disjoint intervals are independent and have a Poisson distribution. A Poisson point process can also be defined using these two properties. Namely, we say that a point process \\\\xi is a Poisson point process if the following two conditions hold 1) \\\\xi(B_1),\\\\ldots,\\\\xi(B_n) are independent for disjoint subsets B_1,\\\\ldots,B_n. 2) For any bounded subset B, \\\\xi(B) has a Poisson distribution with parameter \\\\lambda \\\\B\\\\, where \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\ denotes the Lebesgue measure. The two conditions can be combined together and written as follows : For any disjoint bounded subsets B_1,\\\\ldots,B_n and non-negative integers k_1,\\\\ldots,k_n we have that :\\\\Pr[\\\\xi(B_i) = k_i, 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n] = \\\\prod_i e^{-\\\\lambda \\\\B_i\\\\}\\\\frac{(\\\\lambda \\\\B_i\\\\)^{k_i}}{k_i!}. The constant \\\\lambda is called the intensity of the Poisson point process. Note that the Poisson point process is characterised by the single parameter \\\\lambda. It is a simple, stationary point process. To be more specific one calls the above point process, a homogeneous Poisson point process. An inhomogeneous Poisson process is defined as above but by replacing \\\\lambda \\\\B\\\\ with \\\\stackrel{}{} \\\\int_B\\\\lambda(x) \\\\, dx where \\\\lambda is a non-negative function on \\\\mathbb{R}^d. =Cox point process= A Cox process (named after Sir David Cox) is a generalisation of the Poisson point process, in that we use random measures in place of \\\\lambda \\\\B\\\\. More formally, let \\\\Lambda be a random measure. A Cox point process driven by the random measure \\\\Lambda is the point process \\\\xi with the following two properties : #Given \\\\Lambda(\\\\cdot), \\\\xi(B) is Poisson distributed with parameter \\\\Lambda(B) for any bounded subset B. #For any finite collection of disjoint subsets B_1,\\\\ldots,B_n and conditioned on \\\\Lambda(B_1),\\\\ldots,\\\\Lambda(B_n), we have that \\\\xi(B_1),\\\\ldots,\\\\xi(B_n) are independent. It is easy to see that Poisson point process (homogeneous and inhomogeneous) follow as special cases of Cox point processes. The mean measure of a Cox point process is E \\\\xi(\\\\cdot) = E \\\\Lambda(\\\\cdot) and thus in the special case of a Poisson point process, it is \\\\lambda\\\\\\\\cdot\\\\. For a Cox point process, \\\\Lambda(\\\\cdot) is called the intensity measure. Further, if \\\\Lambda(\\\\cdot) has a (random) density (Radon‚ÄìNikodym derivative) \\\\lambda(\\\\cdot) i.e., :\\\\Lambda(B) \\\\stackrel{\\\\text{a.s.}}{=} \\\\int_B \\\\lambda(x) \\\\, dx, then \\\\lambda(\\\\cdot) is called the intensity field of the Cox point process. Stationarity of the intensity measures or intensity fields imply the stationarity of the corresponding Cox point processes. There have been many specific classes of Cox point processes that have been studied in detail such as: *Log Gaussian Cox point processes: \\\\lambda(y) = \\\\exp(X(y)) for a Gaussian random field X(.) *Shot noise Cox point processes:,Moller, J. (2003) Shot noise Cox processes, Adv. Appl. Prob., 35. \\\\lambda(y)= \\\\sum_{X \\\\in \\\\Phi} h(X,y) for a Poisson point process \\\\Phi(\\\\cdot) and kernel h(\\\\cdot , \\\\cdot) *Generalised shot noise Cox point processes:Moller, J. and Torrisi, G.L. (2005) \\"Generalised Shot noise Cox processes\\", Adv. Appl. Prob., 37. \\\\lambda(y)= \\\\sum_{X \\\\in \\\\Phi} h(X,y) for a point process \\\\Phi(\\\\cdot) and kernel h(. , .) *L√©vy based Cox point processes:Hellmund, G., Prokesova, M. and Vedel Jensen, E.B. (2008) \\"L√©vy-based Cox point processes\\", Adv. Appl. Prob., 40. \\\\lambda(y)= \\\\int h(x,y)L(dx) for a L√©vy basis L(\\\\cdot) and kernel h(. , .), and *Permanental Cox point processes:Mccullagh,P. and Moller, J. (2006) \\"The permanental processes\\", Adv. Appl. Prob., 38. \\\\lambda(y) = X_1^2(y) + \\\\cdots + X_k^2(y) for k independent Gaussian random fields X_i(\\\\cdot)'s *Sigmoidal Gaussian Cox point processes:Adams, R. P., Murray, I. MacKay, D. J. C. (2009) \\"Tractable inference in Poisson processes with Gaussian process intensities\\", Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Machine Learning \\\\lambda(y) = \\\\lambda^{\\\\star}/(1+\\\\exp(-X(y))) for a Gaussian random field X(\\\\cdot) and random \\\\lambda^\\\\star > 0 By Jensen's inequality, one can verify that Cox point processes satisfy the following inequality: for all bounded Borel subsets B, : \\\\operatorname{Var}(\\\\xi(B)) \\\\geq \\\\operatorname{Var}(\\\\xi_{\\\\alpha}(B)) , where \\\\xi_\\\\alpha stands for a Poisson point process with intensity measure \\\\alpha(\\\\cdot) := E \\\\xi(\\\\cdot) = E \\\\Lambda(\\\\cdot). Thus points are distributed with greater variability in a Cox point process compared to a Poisson point process. This is sometimes called clustering or attractive property of the Cox point process. = Determinantal point processes = An important class of point processes, with applications to physics, random matrix theory, and combinatorics, is that of determinantal point processes.Hough, J. B., Krishnapur, M., Peres, Y., and Vir√°g, B., Zeros of Gaussian analytic functions and determinantal point processes. University Lecture Series, 51. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2009. = Hawkes (self-exciting) processes = A Hawkes process N_t, also known as a self-exciting counting process, is a simple point process whose conditional intensity can be expressed as \\\\begin{array}{ll} \\\\lambda (t) & = \\\\mu (t) + \\\\int_{- \\\\infty}^t u (t - s) d N_s\\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\mu (t) + \\\\sum_{T_k < t} u (t - T_k) \\\\end{array} where u : \\\\mathbb{R}^+ \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^+ is a kernel function which expresses the positive influence of past events T_i on the current value of the intensity process \\\\lambda (t), \\\\mu (t) is a possibly non- stationary function representing the expected, predictable, or deterministic part of the intensity, and \\\\\\\\{ T_i : T_i < T_{i + 1} \\\\\\\\} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} is the time of occurrence of the i-th event of the process. = Geometric processes = Given a sequence of non-negative random variables : \\\\\\\\{X_k,k=1,2, \\\\dots\\\\\\\\} , if they are independent and the cdf of X_k is given by F(a^{k-1}x) for k=1,2, \\\\dots , where a is a positive constant, then \\\\\\\\{X_k,k=1,2,\\\\ldots\\\\\\\\} is called a geometric process (GP) . The geometric process has several extensions, including the Œ±- series process and the doubly geometric process . Point processes on the real half-line Historically the first point processes that were studied had the real half line R+ = [0,‚àû) as their state space, which in this context is usually interpreted as time. These studies were motivated by the wish to model telecommunication systems,Palm, C. (1943). Intensit√§tsschwankungen im Fernsprechverkehr (German). Ericsson Technics no. 44, (1943). in which the points represented events in time, such as calls to a telephone exchange. Point processes on R+ are typically described by giving the sequence of their (random) inter-event times (T1, T2, ...), from which the actual sequence (X1, X2, ...) of event times can be obtained as : X_k = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{k} T_j \\\\quad \\\\text{for } k \\\\geq 1. If the inter-event times are independent and identically distributed, the point process obtained is called a renewal process. = Intensity of a point process = The intensity Œª(t  Ht) of a point process on the real half-line with respect to a filtration Ht is defined as : \\\\lambda(t \\\\mid H_t)=\\\\lim_{\\\\Delta t\\\\to 0}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta t}\\\\Pr(\\\\text{One event occurs in the time-interval}\\\\,[t,t+\\\\Delta t] \\\\mid H_t) , Ht can denote the history of event-point times preceding time t but can also correspond to other filtrations (for example in the case of a Cox process). In the N(t)-notation, this can be written in a more compact form: \\\\lambda(t \\\\mid H_t)=\\\\lim_{\\\\Delta t\\\\to 0}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta t}\\\\Pr(N(t+\\\\Delta t)-N(t)=1 \\\\mid H_t). The compensator of a point process, also known as the dual-predictable projection, is the integrated conditional intensity function defined by \\\\Lambda^{} (s_{}, u) = \\\\int_s^u \\\\lambda^{} (t  H_t) \\\\mathrm{d} t  Related functions =Papangelou intensity function= The Papangelou intensity function of a point process N in the n-dimensional Euclidean space \\\\mathbb{R}^n is defined as : \\\\lambda_p(x)=\\\\lim_{\\\\delta \\\\to 0}\\\\frac{1}{B_\\\\delta (x)}{P}\\\\\\\\{\\\\text{One event occurs in } \\\\,B_\\\\delta(x)\\\\mid \\\\sigma[N(\\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\setminus B_\\\\delta(x))] \\\\\\\\} , where B_\\\\delta (x) is the ball centered at x of a radius \\\\delta, and \\\\sigma[N(\\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\setminus B_\\\\delta(x))] denotes the information of the point process N outside B_\\\\delta(x). = Likelihood function = The logarithmic likelihood of a parameterized simple point process conditional upon some observed data is written as \\\\ln \\\\mathcal{L} (N (t)_{t \\\\in [0, T]})=\\\\int_0^T (1 - \\\\lambda (s)) d s + \\\\int_0^T \\\\ln \\\\lambda (s) d N_s Point processes in spatial statistics The analysis of point pattern data in a compact subset S of Rn is a major object of study within spatial statistics. Such data appear in a broad range of disciplines,Baddeley, A., Gregori, P., Mateu, J., Stoica, R., and Stoyan, D., editors (2006). Case Studies in Spatial Point Pattern Modelling, Lecture Notes in Statistics No. 185. Springer, New York. . amongst which are *forestry and plant ecology (positions of trees or plants in general) *epidemiology (home locations of infected patients) *zoology (burrows or nests of animals) *geography (positions of human settlements, towns or cities) *seismology (epicenters of earthquakes) *materials science (positions of defects in industrial materials) *astronomy (locations of stars or galaxies) *computational neuroscience (spikes of neurons). The need to use point processes to model these kinds of data lies in their inherent spatial structure. Accordingly, a first question of interest is often whether the given data exhibit complete spatial randomness (i.e. are a realization of a spatial Poisson process) as opposed to exhibiting either spatial aggregation or spatial inhibition. In contrast, many datasets considered in classical multivariate statistics consist of independently generated datapoints that may be governed by one or several covariates (typically non-spatial). Apart from the applications in spatial statistics, point processes are one of the fundamental objects in stochastic geometry. Research has also focussed extensively on various models built on point processes such as Voronoi Tessellations, Random geometric graphs, Boolean model etc.  See also  *Empirical measure *Random measure *Point process notation *Point process operation *Poisson process *Renewal theory *Invariant measure *Transfer operator *Koopman operator *Shift operator Notes References Category:Statistical data types Category:Spatial processes ","title":"Point process"},{"id":"2147686","title":"Canadian federal election results in Eastern Ontario"},{"id":"2147690","text":"Ammar may refer to: * Ammar (name), given name of Arabic origin * Ammar, Iran * Ammar, Khuzestan, a village in Iran Given names * Ammar ibn Yasir, one of the companions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad  Surname  * Al-Hasan ibn Ammar, Arab commander and statesman for the Fatimid Caliphate. * Michael Ammar, American magician * Muhammad ibn Ammar, Muwallad poet from Silves * Rachid Ammar, chief of staff of the Tunisian Armed Forces  See also  * Amar (disambiguation) ","title":"Ammar"},{"id":"2147693","text":"Good as I Been to You is the 28th studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on November 3, 1992, by Columbia Records. It is composed entirely of traditional folk songs and covers, and is Dylan's first entirely solo, acoustic album since Another Side of Bob Dylan in 1964. It is also his first collection not to feature any original compositions since Dylan in 1973. On the charts, Good as I Been to You reached in the US and in the UK, and helped to restore Dylan's critical standing following the disappointing Under the Red Sky. Recording sessions Since launching the Never Ending Tour in June 1988, traditional covers became a feature at virtually every concert, often as part of an acoustic set. After recording Under the Red Sky in 1990, Dylan would not release an original song until 1997, and during that time, he would increasingly rely on his stockpile of covers for 'fresh' material. Dylan called these covers \\"the music that's true for me.\\" According to Dylan's friend Susan Ross, Good as I Been to You began life as a contractual filler. Dylan had scheduled two weeks at Chicago's Acme Recording Studio sometime in 1992, hiring long-time associate David Bromberg as his producer. An album's worth of songs, including the contemporary Christian ballad \\"Rise Again,\\" were recorded at those sessions with the accompaniment of a full band. The recording engineers on the sessions where Blaise Barton and Dan White.The Land of Words music review Bromberg was left to mix the recordings while Dylan completed a brief, 11-show tour in mainland Europe. There are several songs known to have been recorded during these sessions, including \\"I'll Rise Again\\" (trad.), \\"Nobody's Fault but Mine\\" (Blind Willie Johnson), \\"Lady From Baltimore\\" (Tim Hardin), \\"Polly Vaughan\\" (trad.), \\"Casey Jones\\" (trad.), \\"Duncan and Brady\\" (trad.), \\"Kaatskill Serenade\\" (David Bromberg), \\"World Of Fools\\" (David Bromberg), \\"Sloppy Drunk\\", and \\"Miss the Mississippi.\\" Prior to the release of The Bootleg Series Vol. 8: Tell Tale Signs: Rare and Unreleased 1989‚Äì2006, the only songs known to be circulating from these sessions are \\"Kaatskill Serenade\\", \\"Sloppy Drunk\\", \\"Polly Vaughan\\", and \\"Miss the Mississippi\\". \\"Duncan and Brady\\" was included in that set. When he returned to Malibu in mid-July, Dylan decided to record some solo acoustic material in his garage studio. The intention was to break up the Bromberg recordings with a few solo performances in between. As those garage sessions progressed, plans were changed, and the Bromberg recordings were pulled from the album. Neither Dylan nor Bromberg have explained why the Bromberg recordings were rejected and put away‚Äîthey have never been released‚Äîand whether Dylan actually disliked them is unknown. It was made clear that Dylan was pleased with the results he was getting in his garage studio, particularly in the minimal production work given to the recordings. Producer credit was given to Debbie Gold, a friend of Dylan's who took a hands-off approach to the entire proceedings. Song selection Without the use of notes or lyrics, Dylan recorded a wide range of traditional songs. \\"Froggy Went A-Courtin',\\" \\"Blackjack Davey,\\" and the anti- recruiting \\"Arthur McBride\\" were part of the British and Irish tradition of folk songs. \\"Little Maggie\\" was a popular bluegrass standard. \\"Diamond Joe\\" was well-known thanks to fellow folk revivalist Ramblin' Jack Elliott. \\"Frankie and Albert\\" and \\"Sittin' on Top of the World\\" both had long, deep roots in folk-blues. Dylan also covered songs that weren't authentically traditional, such as \\"Tomorrow Night\\" (best known for Lonnie Johnson's hit version in 1947 and a version by Elvis Presley released in 1965) and Stephen Foster's \\"Hard Times.\\" Though Dylan is credited with all of the arrangements, several arrangements clearly belong to other artists, including the Texas songster Mance Lipscomb. A number of publications, including Folk Roots, criticized the album for making this error. Lipscomb's posthumous oral biography, I Say Me for a Parable, edited by Glen Alyn, claims that Dylan listened to Mance play backstage at Newport in the early 1960s and then later took the stage and sang Mance's songs as his own. Outtakes When time came to sequence the album, producer Debbie Gold was unable to convince Dylan to include \\"You Belong to Me\\". Though it wasn't authentically traditional, it was popular enough to be covered by Jo Stafford, Patti Page, and Dean Martin. The most popular version was recorded by the Duprees, one of the final Italian doo wop groups to make a wave in the early 1960s. Two years later, the recording appeared in Oliver Stone's controversial film, Natural Born Killers. Aftermath The response to Good as I Been to You was surprisingly positive, particularly for an album with very modest ambitions. It drew comparisons with the acoustic sets featured in Dylan's \\"Never Ending Tour\\" shows, drawing much praise for his interpretive skills. A number of critics pointed out that Dylan's voice was now physically ravaged, but the focus was often on the phrasing. \\"Dylan sounds now, in comparison to his younger self, like one of those ghosts,\\" wrote David Sexton of The Sunday Telegraph, \\"but a powerful ghost. The effect is not so much nostalgia...as deeply inward.\\" The inaccurate song credits created some controversy for Dylan. Nearly half of the songs were incorrectly credited, and in one case, Dylan faced legal action when Australian folksinger Mick Slocum sued Dylan's music publisher over the arrangement credit in \\"Jim Jones.\\" Slocum recorded his arrangement with his band, The Original Bushwackers, in 1975, and Dylan's publisher was forced to concede their error. Good as I Been to You was successful enough to warrant a sequel, and in less than a year, Dylan returned to the studio to record World Gone Wrong. Track listing All songs are Traditional, arranged by Bob Dylan, except where noted. ;Notes # the original album notes incorrectly credit all song arrangements to Bob Dylan. # the original album notes correctly identify \\"Hard Times\\" as public domain, as it was published in 1855, but the author's name has now been listed for complete accuracy. # the original album notes incorrectly identify \\"Tomorrow Night\\" as public domain.

From 614 he was tortured in Mecca in an attempt to force him to recant his faith. His persecutor is not directly named; but the persecution stopped when Abu Bakr bought him from Al-Tufayl and manumitted him. As was usual for freed slaves, Amir remained in Abu Bakr's service and had the special care of grazing his milking ewe. Emigration to Medina When Abu Bakr and Muhammad escaped from Mecca in 622, Amir grazed Abu Bakr's flocks by day, then brought them at evening to the cave where Abu Bakr and Muhammad were hiding, presumably so that the sheep would cover their tracks. When they left the cave to travel to Medina, Amir accompanied them.He was the one to write the note to Surraqah bin Mallik that no harm would come to them from Prophet side edit :Ayaan khanMuhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari.

Muhammad made a pact of brotherhood between Amir and Al-Harith ibn Aws ibn Muadh. Soon after their arrival, Amir, Abu Bakr and Bilal were all struck by Medina fever. When the young Aisha came to inquire after their health, Amir replied, apparently rambling: I have experienced death before actually tasting it: The coward‚Äôs death comes upon him as he sits. Every man resists it with all his might like the ox who protects his body with his horns. Amir fought at the battles of Badr and Uhud. Death He participated in the Battle of Bir Ma'una in July or August 625. When he was stabbed by Jabbar in Sulma from the Kalb tribe, he exclaimed, \\"I have been successful, by Allah!\\" He was among the first to die in the battle. Urwa reported that his body was never found, for \\"the angels had buried him\\" and he was raised directly to Heaven. Later Jabbar asked what Amir had meant by saying, \\"I have won.\\" When he was told that Amir had gained Paradise, Jabbar also became a Muslim.

He had a weekly column for Newsweek online that ran from 2001-2005. In 2005, Kuntzman became editor of The Brooklyn Paper, a group of community newspapers covering Kings County, New York. During his tenure, he won awards for Editor of the Year and Columnist of the Year from the Suburban Newspapers of America. His editorial writing also won awards from the Independent Free Papers of America. That organization also gave The Brooklyn Paper its Vic Jose Award in 2009. In that same year, The Brooklyn Paper was bought by the Community Newspaper Group, a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Kuntzman gave mainstream coverage to the 2008 Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest at Coney Island. In 2010, CNG named him editor of four more print editions, including the Park Slope Courier. In 2011, those editions were consolidated under one name, Brooklyn Courier. In 2012, Kuntzman became deputy managing editor for news at the New York Daily News, where he later became a columnist until 2016. In 2016, Kuntzman became the center of widespread attention when he wrote an article titled \\"Firing an AR-15 is horrifying, menacing, and very very loud.\\" In the article, Kuntzman says that he traveled to a gun range in Philadelphia to shoot a \\"military-style weapon\\" so that he could better understand such weapons' appeals in the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting. He said, \\"It felt to me like a bazooka - and sounded like a cannon.\\" Kuntzman further described the experience by saying that \\"The recoil bruised my shoulder\\" and \\"The smell of sulfur and destruction made me sick.\\" The most controversial part of the article was when Kuntzman claimed, \\"The explosions - like a bomb - gave me a temporary form of PTSD.\\" Kuntzman faced widespread criticism for the article, particularly the claim that he suffered from PTSD, with some critics saying such a claim diminished the severity of PTSD suffered by veterans.

Approximately long, the trail ran through areas of high mountains, arid deserts, and deep canyons. It is considered one of the most arduous of all trade routes ever established in the United States. Explored, in part, by Spanish explorers as early as the late 16th century, the trail saw extensive use by pack trains from about 1830 until the mid-1850s. The name of the trail comes from the publication of John C. Fr√©mont‚Äôs Report of his 1844 journey for the U.S. Topographical Corps., guided by Kit Carson, from California to New Mexico. The name acknowledges the fact that parts of the trail had been known to the Spanish since the 16th century.History of The Old Spanish Trail MuseumTrail.org, San Luis Valley Museum Association. Retrieved on 2008-08-05.Old Spanish Trail Association. Retrieved on 2008-08-05 Fr√©mont's report named a trail that had already been in use for about 15 years. The trail is important to New Mexico history because it established an arduous but usable trade route with California. History leftThe trail is a combination of known trails that were established by Spanish explorers, trappers, and traders with the Ute and other Indian tribes. The eastern parts of what became called the Old Spanish Trail, including southwest Colorado and southeast Utah, were explored by Juan Maria de Rivera in 1765. Franciscan missionaries Francisco Atanasio Dom√≠nguez and Silvestre V√©lez de Escalante unsuccessfully attempted the trip to California, which was just being settled, leaving Santa Fe in 1776 and making it all the way into the Great Basin near Utah Lake before returning via the Arizona Strip. Other expeditions, under another Franciscan missionary, Francisco Garc√©s, and Captain Juan Bautista de Anza, then explored and traded in the southern part of the region, finding shorter and less arduous routes through the mountains and deserts that connected Sonora to New Mexico and California, but did not become part of the Old Spanish Trail, with the exception of some of the paths through the Mojave Desert. The Mohave Trail, first traveled by Garc√©s, from the Mohave villages on the Colorado River westward across the Mojave Desert, between desert springs, until he turned northwestward to the Old Tejon Pass into the San Joaquin Valley looking for a route to Monterey. Garc√©s then returned to the Colorado following the whole length of the Mohave Trail from the San Bernardino Valley over the San Bernardino Mountains at Monument Peak, down the Mojave River and eastward to the Colorado River. The same trail was used by the first Americans to reach California by land, the expedition led by Jedediah Smith in November 1826.Smith, Jedediah S., [Harrison G. Rogers], and George R. Brooks (ed.). The Southwest Expedition of Jedediah S. Smith: His Personal Account of the Journey to California, 1826‚Äì1827. Lincoln and London, University of Nebraska Press, [1977] 1989. The Mojave desert section of the Mohave Trail is now a jeep trail called the Mojave Road. A route linking New Mexico to California, combining information from many explorers, was opened in 1829-30 when Santa Fe merchant Antonio Armijo led a trade party of 60 men and 100 mules to California. Using a short cut discovered by Rafael Rivera the previous year, the Armijo party was able to stitch together a route that connected the routes of the Rivera and Dom√≠nguez-Escalante Expeditions and the Jedediah Smith explorations with the approaches to San Gabriel Mission through the Mojave along the Mojave River. Upon the return of Antonio Armijo, the governor of New Mexico immediately announced the success to his superiors in Mexico City. As a reward, the governor officially named Armijo \\"Commander for the Discovery of the Route to California\\". Armijo's route was documented by him in a report to the governor, and published by the Mexican government in June 1830.Diario que formo yo el ciudando Antonio Armijo, como comandante, para el descubrimiento del camino para el punto de las Californias (Diary made by citizen Antonio Armijo as commandant for the discovery of the route to the Californias), Official Register of the Government the United States of Mexico, 1830, pp. 205-206 from Old Spanish Trail Association website, oldspanishtrail.org accessed February 14, 2016 After this date, the route began to be used by traders for usually a single annual round trip.Warren, Elizabeth von Till. \\"The Old Spanish National Historic Trail.\\" Old Spanish Trail Association. Reproduced from Pathways Across America. (Summer 2004) by the Partnership for the National Trail System. Word spread about the successful trade expedition and some commerce began between Santa Fe and Los Angeles. However, in 1830, due to resumed hostilities with the Navajo, the Armijo route west to the Colorado River Crossing of the Fathers was not practical, and a new route north of the river had to be found, which used the trails of the fur traders and trappers of New Mexico through the lands of the Utes. This route ran northwest to the Colorado and Green Rivers, then crossed over to the Sevier River, which it followed until crossing westward over mountains to the vicinity of Parowan, Utah. It then passed southward to the Santa Clara River, linking up with Armijo's route to California. This commerce usually consisted of one mule pack train from Santa Fe with 20 to 200 members, with roughly twice as many mules, bringing New Mexican goods hand-woven by Indians, such as serapes and blankets, to California. California had many horses and mules, many growing wild, with no local market, which were readily traded for hand-woven Indian products. Usually two blankets were traded for one horse, more blankets were usually required for a mule. California had almost no wool processing industry and few weavers, so woven products were a welcome commodity. The trading party usually left New Mexico in early November to take advantage of winter rains to cross the deserts on the trail and would arrive in California in early February. The return party would usually leave California for New Mexico in early April to get over the trail before the water holes dried up and the melting snow raised the rivers too high. The return party often included several hundred to a few thousand horses and mules. Low-scale emigration from New Mexico to California used parts of the trail in the late 1830s when the trapping trade began to die. New Mexicans came to settle in Alta California by this route, some first settled in Politana then established the twin settlements of Agua Mansa and La Placita on the Santa Ana River the first towns in what became San Bernardino and Riverside Counties. The family of Antonio Armijo moved to Alta California and his father acquired the Rancho Tolenas. A number of Americans, most naturalized Mexican citizens in New Mexico, formerly in the California trade over the Old Spanish Trail or in the fur trade settled in Alta California and became important citizens in later years, like Louis Rubidoux, John A. Rowland, William Workman, Benjamin Davis Wilson, and William Wolfskill. The trail was also used for illicit purposes, namely to raid the California ranchos for horses and for an extensive Indian slave trade. These horse raids were made by Mexicans, ex-trappers and Indian tribes, primarily the Utes, most famously Walkara, who together stole hundreds to thousands of horses in one raid. Native Americans, especially the Paiutes along the route of the trail, usually women and children, were captured and sold to Mexican ranchers, etc., in both California and New Mexico for domestic servants. Mexican traders and Indian raiding parties both participated in this slave trade. The consequences of this human trafficking had a long-standing effect for those who lived along the trail, even after the trail was no longer in use. Intermittent Indian warfare along the trail often resulted from these slave raids by unscrupulous traders and raiding Indians. John C. Fr√©mont, \\"The Great Pathfinder\\", took the route, guided by Kit Carson, in 1844 and named it in his reports written up in about 1848. New Mexico-California trade continued until the mid-1850s, when a shift to the use of freight wagons and the development of wagon trails made the old pack trail route obsolete. By 1846 both New Mexico and California had become U.S. territories as a result of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War of 1846‚Äì1848, and after 1848 large numbers of Mormon immigrants were settling in Utah, Nevada, and California all along the trail, affecting both trade interests and tolerance for the slavery of American Natives. Place names used in this article refer to present-day states and communities. Few (if any) settlements existed along the trail, except in the coastal plains of Alta California, before 1850, although many of the geologic features along the Trail retain their Spanish designations. Description of the trail route Old Spanish Trail Historic Routes (National Park Service) =Armijo Route= The Armijo Route of the Old Spanish Trail was established by an expedition led by Antonio Armijo in 1829‚Äì1830. Leaving on November 7, 1829 Armijo's expedition traveled a route northwest and west of Santa Fe from Abiquiu, following the Chama River and the Puerco River, and he crossed to the amazing San Juan River basin. From the San Juan they entered the Four Corners area, passed north of the Carrizo Mountains to Church Rock,and to the Colorado River (then called the Rio Grande), where the travelers forded at the Crossing of the Fathers above present day Glen Canyon Dam. Then east of present-day Kayenta, where the trail then ran to Marsh Pass and north through Tsegi Canyon into canyon country. Continuing west to Pipe Spring and on to Virgin River above present day St. George, Utah, the expedition then followed the Virgin to the mouth of the Santa Clara River, which they followed up to the vicinity of the Shivwits Reservation. They then crossed southward over the Beaver Dam Mountains, at Utah Hill Summit to the Virgin River again, which they followed for three days down to the Colorado River, before turning west parallel to the river, over difficult terrain in the Black Mountains, to avoid the deep narrow gorge of Boulder Canyon, to the riverside oases of Callville Wash and Las Vegas Wash. Armijo waited there for his scouts to return, especially Rivera who had visited the Mohave villages down river before. Rivera returned, having recognized the Mohave Trail that led westward to Southern California. Perhaps because of the belligerence of the Mohave to parties of mountain men in recent years, or merely to save time, Armijo attempted a short cut route southwest to the mouth of the Mojave River. From Las Vegas Wash on the Colorado River, Armijo's expedition passed southwestward to Eldorado Dry Lake in Eldorado Valley and the spring at Goodsprings Valley, then through Wilson Pass, across Mesquite Valley and California Valley, through Emigrant Pass to Resting Springs, then along the Amargosa River from near Tecopa to Salt Spring. From Salt Spring they crossed a two-day-long waterless stretch up Salt Creek to Laguna del Milagro (\\"Lake of the Miracle\\"), (probably Silver Lake), then to Ojito del Malpais (\\"little spring of the badlands\\") on Soda Lake, then another waterless day beyond Soda Lake, where they reached the only intermittently dependable Mojave River and the Mohave Trail leading up river.Warren, Elizbeth von Till (1974). \\"Armijo‚Äôs Trace Revisited: A New Interpretation of the Impact of the Antonio Armijo Route of 1829-1830 on the Development of the Old Spanish Trail.\\" (MA thesis). Las Vegas, Nevada: University of Nevada, Las Vegas. By now short of food, Armijo sent some of his scouts ahead to get more food in the settlement at San Bernardino de Sena Estancia. They followed the river for six days (110 miles to its head from the mouth), having to kill a mule or horse each day to eat. Probably at Summit Valley at the top of the river, east of Cajon Pass they met vaqueros of the San Bernardino de Sena Estancia with food. Armijo did not cross over the mountains by the Mohave Trail route over Monument Peak, but followed a route he called \\"Ca√±on de San Bernardino\\" from the upper Mojave River west through Cajon Pass and down Crowder Canyon and Cajon Canyon to the mouth of Cajon Pass, where the trail reached the coastal plain of San Bernardino Valley, a route no doubt known to the vaqueros of San Bernardino Estancia.LeRoy R. Hafen and Antonio Armijo, Armijo's Journal, Huntington Library Quarterly, Vol. 11, No. 1 (Nov., 1947), pp. 87-101, Published by: University of California Press, DOI:10.2307/3816035 Once through the pass, they turned west along the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains for two days to San Jose Creek, then following it to cross the San Gabriel River at the Rancho La Puente, reaching Mission San Gabriel Arc√°ngel on January 30, 1830. Armijo returned by the same route between March 1 and April 25, 1830. He submitted a brief journal of his journey (itemizing the days with names of places where camps were made but with no distances) to the government of New Mexico, and it was published by the Mexican government in June 1830. LeRoy R. Hafen and Antonio Armijo. \\"Armijo's Journal\\", Huntington Library Quarterly, Vol. 11, No. 1, (Nov., 1947), pp. 87-101, University of California Press, DOI: 10.2307/3816035 from jstor.org accessed 10/28/2015 =Main Northern Route= The Main Route (also referred to as the Central Route or the Northern Route) of the Old Spanish Trail avoided territory of the Navajo, (who had returned to a state of hostilities after Armijo's trip), and the more difficult canyon country traversed by the Armijo Route around the Colorado River. First traveled in 1830 by a party led by William Wolfskill and George Yount, this route ran northwest from Santa Fe through southwestern Colorado, past the San Juan Mountains, Mancos, and Dove Creek, entering Utah near present-day Monticello. The trail then proceeded north through difficult terrain to Spanish Valley near today's Moab, Utah, where a ferry crossed the deep and wide Colorado River and then turned northwest to a ferry crossing on the similarly sized and dangerous Green River near present-day Green River, Utah. The route then passed through (or around) the San Rafael Swell, the northernmost reach of the Trail. Entering the Great Basin in Utah via Salina Creek Canyon, the trail turned southwest following the Sevier, Santa Clara, Virgin Rivers to the north bank of the Colorado River. There they could follow the Colorado River to Las Vegas Wash, then south through the Eldorado Valley and Piute Valley to join the Mojave Trail, west of the Mohave villages (below modern Laughlin) and followed the route between the springs along the Mojave Trail to Soda Lake and the Mojave River. Later caravans could alternatively follow the Armijo Route diverting southwestward from the Colorado at Las Vegas Wash, to Resting Springs and to the Mojave River where it joined the Wolfskill/Yount Route, following that river upward to and over the San Bernardino Mountains through Cajon Pass, Crowder Canyon and lower Cajon Canyon and across the coastal valleys to Mission San Gabriel and Los Angeles. Keith Myhrer, William G. White, Stanton D. Rolf, ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE OLD SPANISH TRAlL/MORMON ROAD, From Las Vegas, Nevada to the California Border, TECHNICAL REPORT 17, BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT, NEVADA, FEBRUARY 1990 =Northern Branch= The North Branch of the Old Spanish Trail was established by traders and trappers using Indian and Spanish colonial routes. It ran from Santa Fe north to Taos and on north into the San Luis Valley of Colorado. Caravans then headed west to today's Saguache, crossing over the Continental Divide at Cochetopa Pass, and then through present day Gunnison and Montrose to the Uncompahgre Valley. The trail then followed the Gunnison River to today's Grand Junction, where the Colorado River was forded, and then on west to join the Main Northern Route just east of the Green River. The North Branch later became an interest of explorers seeking viable routes for a transcontinental railroad along the 38th parallel. In 1853 alone, three separate expeditions explored the North Branch over Cochetopa Pass. These groups were led, in order, by Lieutenant Edward Fitzgerald Beale, Captain John Williams Gunnison, and John C. Fr√©mont. =Modifications to the Trail before 1844= Use of the Old Spanish Trail between 1829 and 1848 resulted in numerous variations as travelers adopted or blazed easier paths. But regardless of the route taken, the Old Spanish Trail crossed several mountain ranges, passed through dry sections with limited grass and sometimes limited water, crossed two deserts, and was often littered with the bones of horses that had died of thirst.Hafen, LeRoy, op. cit; pp131‚Äì154; Trail Makers The western portions of the Old Spanish Trail could only be used semi-reliably in winter when rains or snows deposited water in the desert. In summer, there was often no water and the oppressive heat could kill. A single round trip per year was about all that was feasible. After 1848, the western parts of the trail were used for winter access between Utah and California when other trails were closed by snow. Lower Narrows Crossing ‚Äì Cajon Pass Cutoff Sometime before 1844, perhaps as early as 1830, a cut off developed on the Old Spanish Trail that cut the distance traveled along the upper Mojave River, by cutting across what is now Victor Valley, from the Cajon Pass to a crossing just below the Lower Narrows of the river. On April 20, 1844, following the advice of his guide, John C. Fr√©mont intercepted this route to the river, riding east southeast from Lake Elizabeth, north of the San Gabriel Mountains.John Charles Fr√©mont, John Torrey, James Hall, Report of the Exploring Expedition to the Rocky Mountains in the Year 1842: And to Oregon and North California in the Years 1843-44, Gales and Seaton, printers, Washington, 1845 Salt Spring ‚Äì Fork of the Road Cutoff Another cutoff to the Armijo route of the Old Spanish Trail had developed before 1844, where the trail forked northeastward from the Mojave River and Mohave Trail, east of what is now Yermo, California, running up Spanish Canyon over Alvord Mountain, to Bitter Spring, then through Red Pass to join the Armijo route near Salt Spring in the Silurian Valley. Fr√©mont also used this route in 1844. The fork of the trails there on the Mojave River, later became known as Fork of the Road. New Map Of The Territory Of Arizona, Southern California And Parts Of Nevada, Utah And Sonora., Payot, Upham & Company, San Francisco, 1877. from davidrumsey.com accessed November 19, 2015. =Fr√©mont's Cutoff= One last modification to this route was that followed by John C. Fr√©mont eastward in 1844. His expedition left the Armijo Route at Resting Spring and turned northeastward after crossing the Nopah Range through Emigrant Pass, through California Valley and across Pahrump Valley to Stump Spring and into the mountains to Mountain Springs, to Cottonwood Spring, to Las Vegas Springs. He then crossed the dry 50 miles to the Muddy River before rejoining the Main Route on the Virgin River at Halfway Wash after crossing what later became known as Mormon Mesa. This route saved the large distances caused by the diversion of the Armijo and Main routes to follow the Colorado River, and would later become the route of the Mormon Road, the wagon road through southern Nevada between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles.

In 2001, the section of the Trail that runs across Nevada from the Arizona border to California was placed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Old Spanish Trail/Mormon Road Historic District. The Old Spanish Trail became the fifteenth national historic trail after Congress adopted Senate Bill 1946 and President George W. Bush signed the legislation in December 2002. Although few traces of the early traders' trail remain, the Trail is now commemorated in many local street and road names, and numerous historical markers in the states that it crossed.

It was Dylan's second consecutive collection of only traditional folk songs, performed acoustically with guitar and harmonica. The songs tend to deal with darker and more tragic themes than the previous outing, Good as I Been to You. The album received a warm, if not excited, reception from critics. Despite earning a Grammy award for Best Traditional Folk Album, it peaked at number 70 in the U.S., and at number 35 in the UK. The recording sessions Like its predecessor Good as I Been to You, World Gone Wrong was recorded to fulfill the terms of his January 18, 1988, contract. It would be the final album released under that contract. In May 1993, Dylan once again held sessions at his Malibu home inside his garage studio. Recorded solo in a matter of days, a total of 14 songs were recorded without a single change in guitar strings. Marked by distortion, the recording quality was very primitive by modern standards, with very casual microphone placement and very little tuning. There were some rumors that Dylan had mastered the album from cassette tapes, as Bruce Springsteen had done with Nebraska, but those rumors have been as difficult to prove as they have been to dismiss. Possibly influenced by the controversy surrounding Good as I Been to You, Dylan wrote a complete set of liner notes to World Gone Wrong, citing all possible sources. It had been decades since Dylan had written his own liner notes, and they were always surrealistic; these notes, while still playfully written, were actually informative. Song information The balance of songs in World Gone Wrong swung more towards rural blues. Two had been recorded by the Mississippi Sheiks, two more by Blind Willie McTell, one by Willie Brown, and another by Frank Hutchison. Songs popularized by Tom Paley and Doc Watson were also recorded. In the case of \\"The Two Soldiers\\", Dylan had been performing it live since 1988. As Clinton Heylin writes, on World Gone Wrong Dylan invested it \\"with that classic impersonality the true traditionalist seeks\\". Outtakes Five songs were left over from the sessions, including versions of \\"Goodnight My Love\\", \\"Twenty-One Years\\", Robert Johnson's \\"32-20 Blues\\" and the Carter Family's \\"Hello Stranger\\". In 2008, \\"32-20 Blues\\" and another outtake from these sessions, \\"Mary and the Soldier\\", were released on The Bootleg Series Vol. 8: Tell Tale Signs. Album artwork The album cover depicts Dylan wearing a top hat, seated at a table at Flukes Cradle Cafe bar in Camden Town, London. Hanging on the wall behind Dylan is a painting, \\"L'Etranger\\" by artist Peter Gallagher. Reception The response to World Gone Wrong was mixed-to- positive, with many regarding it as superior to Good as I Been to You. Robert Christgau gave it an A‚Äì in his Consumer Guide column published in The Village Voice. \\"Dylan's second attempt to revive the folk music revival while laying down a new record without writing any new songs is eerie and enticing,\\" wrote Christgau. Ira Robbins wrote in Newsday that \\"the record expresses as much about Bob Dylan's art as any collection of originals.\\" Even music critic Bill Wyman, who dismissed Good as I Been to You, wrote that \\"it's a testament to his unpredictability that [Good as I Been to You] is tedious and World Gone Wrong is a signal document, a mesmerizing and sanguinary walk down the blood- soaked history of folk and blues. It also has his best liner notes since the 1960s.\\" Wyman was not the only critic enamored with the liner notes, which are written in strange, verbose prose. Andy Gill of The Independent wrote, \\"it's the liner notes that offer the most interesting aspect of the album ‚Ä¶ [With] the songs steeped in deceit, treachery, venality and despair‚Äînot to mention his sometimes slightly berserk annotations‚Äîthe picture builds up of the Blues as Bible Study, a series of lessons to be interpreted.\\" Christgau, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, and many others expressed their enjoyment in reading the liner notes. World Gone Wrong went on to place 23rd on The Village Voices Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 1993. Following its release, Dylan was temporarily a freelance artist. As possible promotion for World Gone Wrong, Dylan arranged for an acoustic television special to be accompanied by a live album release. Scheduled for mid-November at Manhattan's Supper Club, Dylan was accompanied by his current touring band, pedal steel and slide guitarist Bucky Baxter, guitarist John Jackson, bassist Tony Garnier, and drummer Winston Watson. After a series of rehearsals, Dylan performed four shows in front of a live audience, \\"invest[ing] 'Jack-A-Roe,' 'Delia,' and Blind Boy Fuller's 'Weeping Willow' with a power and passion that had been missing from a whole year of lackluster performances,\\" wrote Clinton Heylin. In addition to songs from his two most recent albums, the group performed acoustic renditions of \\"Ring Them Bells\\" and \\"Queen Jane Approximately\\" \\"that spoke with all the hurt that inner voice felt when left crying to be heard\\". For reasons never explained, the TV broadcast and CD planned from these performances were all scrapped. It was an expensive decision, as Dylan had paid all expenses out of his own pocket, including those for a film crew and a multitrack digital console. Everything was filmed and recorded, but the results were shelved indefinitely (and are now widely bootlegged.) At the end of 1993, Sony signed Dylan to another contract good for ten albums. A compilation and a live album would follow, but Dylan would take four years before releasing his next studio album, Time Out of Mind, a collection of originals that won far more media attention than World Gone Wrong.

Family Abu Quhafa was the son of 'Amir ibn 'Amr ibn Ka'b ibn Sa'd ibn Taym ibn Murra ibn Ka'b ibn Lu'ayy ibn Ghalib ibn Fihr. He lived in Mecca, and married his cousin Salma bint Sakhar ibn Amr, who was known as Umm Al-Khayr (\\"Mother of Goodness\\"). They had several sons who did not survive infancy. When Abu Bakr was born in 573, he was therefore known as Atiq (\\"exempted\\" from death), while his subsequent brothers were given the related names Muataq and Muaytaq. Abu Quhafa later married a younger woman, Hind bint Nuqayd. She bore him three daughters: Umm Farwa, Qurayba and Umm Amir. Islam When Abu Bakr became a Muslim in 610, Abu Quhafa remained a pagan. When he spoke disparagingly of Muhammad, Abu Bakr struck his father‚Äôs chest and rendered him unconscious.Qurtubi, Tafsir on Q58:22, vol. 17 p. 307. Cited in Radtke, B., & O‚ÄôKane, J. (1996).

When Abu Bakr ransomed Muslim slaves who were being persecuted in 613614, Abu Quhafa said to him: \\"My son, I see that you are freeing weak slaves. If you want to do what you are doing, why don‚Äôt you free powerful men who could defend you and protect you?\\" But Abu Bakr replied: \\"I am only trying to do what I am attempting for Allah‚Äôs sake.\\" In old age, Abu Quhafa lost most of his sight. In September 622 Abu Bakr emigrated to Medina, taking all his money with him \\"to the amount of five or six thousand dirhams.\\" Abu Quhafa went to call on the family and said that he thought Abu Bakr ‚Äúhad put them in difficulty by taking off all his money.\\" His granddaughter Asma said that Abu Bakr had left them plenty. \\"I took some stones and put them in a niche where Abu Bakr kept his money; then I covered them with a cloth and took his hand and said, 'Put your hand on this money, Father.' He did so and said: 'There's nothing to worry about; he has done well in leaving you this, and you will have enough.' In fact he had left us nothing, but I wanted to set the old man's mind at rest.\\" Conversion In January 630 Abu Quhafa heard that Muhammad's army was on the way to Mecca. He asked his young daughter to lead him to Mount Abu Qubays, and there he asked her what she could see. She told him, \\"A mass of black.\\" He said they were the cavalry. His daughter added that she could see a man running up and down in front of them, and he said that this was the army adjutant. Then his daughter announced that \\"the black mass had spread.\\" Abu Quhafa told her that the cavalry had been released so they must go home quickly. However, they met the army before they could reach their house, and a mounted warrior tore off his daughter's silver necklace. No other violence was done to them, for the conquest of Mecca was almost bloodless. Abu Bakr sought out his father and led him to the mosque. Muhammad greeted them with the words: \\"Why did you not leave the old man in his house so that I could come to him there?\\" But Abu Bakr replied that this way was more fitting. Muhammad sat Abu Quhafa down, \\"and stroked his chest and asked him to accept Islam, and he did so.\\" Abu Quhafa had white hair, so Muhammad told them to dye it. Abu Bakr then appealed to the army for the return of his sister‚Äôs necklace, but nobody admitted to taking it, so the family had to accept that, \\"There is not much honesty among people nowadays.\\" Death It is said that when Abu Bakr died in Medina in August 634, Mecca was convulsed by an earthquake. Abu Quhafa asked, \\"What is that?\\" and was told that his son was dead. He replied, \\"It is a terrible calamity. Who has arisen in authority after him?\\" On being advised that Umar was now Caliph, he said, \\"He was his companion,\\" implying approval. Abu Quhafa returned his inheritance from his son to his grandson. Abu Quhafa died only a few months later, in March 635, \\"at the age of 97.\\" This age was calculated in lunar years; by the solar calendar, he would have been only 94 or 95.

Biography  Peggy Glanville Hicks, born in Melbourne, first studied composition with Fritz Hart at the Albert Street Conservatorium in Melbourne. There she also studied the piano under Waldemar Seidel. She spent the years from 1932 to 1936 as a student at the Royal College of Music in London, where she studied piano with Arthur Benjamin, conducting with Constant Lambert and Malcolm Sargent, and composition with Ralph Vaughan Williams. (She later asserted that the idea that opens Vaughan Williams' 4th Symphony was taken from her Sinfonietta for Small Orchestra (1935), and it reappears in her 1953 opera The Transposed Heads). Her teachers also included Egon Wellesz, in Vienna, and Nadia Boulanger, in Paris. She was the first Australian composer whose work, her Choral Suite, was performed at an International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) Festival (1938). From 1949 to 1955 she served as a critic for the New York Herald Tribune, succeeding Paul Bowles, working under Virgil Thomson. At the same time she continued composing and was musical director at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. She was granted U.S. citizenship in 1949.Covell, Roger. 'U.S. Citizen but the Music is Australian'. The Sydney Morning Herald Weekend Magazine, 13 June 1970. After leaving America, she lived in Greece from 1957 to 1975. In the United States she asked George Antheil to revise his Ballet M√©canique for a modern percussion ensemble for a concert she helped to organize.American Mavericks, Program Notes In 1966, after years of failing eyesight, she was diagnosed with a brain tumour, which was surgically removed, and she regained her sight. However, a result of this operation was her loss of a sense of smell. She died in Sydney in 1990. She had returned to Australia at the encouragement of James Murdoch and others. Murdoch also wrote her biography. Her will established the Peggy Glanville-Hicks Composers' House in her home in Paddington, Sydney, as a residency for Australian and overseas composers. The organisation New Music Network established the Peggy Glanville-Hicks Address in her honour in 1999.The Peggy Glanville-Hicks Address , New Music Network Music Her instrumental works include the Sinfonia da Pacifica, Etruscan Concerto (piano and orchestra), Concerto romantico (viola and orchestra), and the Sonata for Harp, premiered by Nicanor Zabaleta in 1953; performed by Marshall Maguire on the CD Awakening, the work was named the Most Performed Contemporary Classical Composition at the APRA Music Awards of 1996. Her best known operas are The Transposed Heads and Nausicaa. The Transposed Heads is in six scenes with a libretto by the composer after Thomas Mann and premiered in Louisville, Kentucky, on 3 April 1954.Radic, Th√©r√®se (1992).\\"Transposed Heads, The\\". The New Grove Dictionary of Opera. Online version retrieved 1 March 2018 (subscription required for full access). Nausicaa was composed in 1959‚Äì60 and premiered in Athens in 1961. The libretto is from the novel Homer's Daughter by Robert Graves and supports the theory that The Odyssey, attributed to Homer, is actually a story told by women. Glanville-Hicks visited Graves on Majorca in 1956 and worked with his friend Alastair Reid to complete the libretto. The premiere was a major event in the operatic calendar, and was considered a triumph for Glanville-Hicks, but the opera has never been re- staged. Her last opera, Sappho, was composed in 1963 for the San Francisco Opera, with hopes that Maria Callas would sing the title role. However, the company rejected the work and it has never been produced.\\"Buried symphonies score a chance at resurrection\\", The Age, 27 July 2007. This opera was recorded in 2012 by Jennifer Condon conducting the Gulbenkian Orchestra and with Deborah Polaski in the title role. Private life She was married to British composer Stanley Bate, who was homosexual, from 1938 to 1949, when they divorced. She married journalist Rafael da Costa in 1952; the couple divorced the following year. She was also involved with Mario Monteforte Toledo and Theodore Thomson Flynn. Like Bate, many of the men with whom Glanville-Hicks was close were gay; she had few intimate female friends, and often dressed in male attire. She was an intimate friend of the expatriate U.S. writer and composer Paul Bowles, and they remained very close all their lives, although their relationship was mainly epistolary after his move to Morocco in 1947.

Michel Bauwens is a theorist in the emerging field of P2P theory and director and founder of the P2P Foundation, a global organization of researchers working in collaboration in the exploration of peer production, governance, and property. He has authored a number of essays, including his seminal thesis The Political Economy of Peer Production. Biography Bauwens regularly lectures internationally on P2P theory, the Commons and their potential for social change. In the first semester of 2014 Bauwens was research director with the FLOK (Free Libre Open Knowledge) Society at IAEN, the National Institute of Advanced Studies of Ecuador. The FLOK Society developed a first of its kind Commons Transition Plan for the Ecuadorian government. Over fifteen policy papers the plan outlines policy proposals for transitioning Ecuador to what is described as a social knowledge economy based on the creation and support of open knowledge commons. One version of the plan is available online. He currently lives in Chiang Mai, Thailand. P2P theory In The Political Economy of Peer Production Bauwens regards p2p phenomena as an emerging alternative to Capitalism, although he argues that \\"Peer production is highly dependent on the market for peer production produces use-value through mostly immaterial production, without directly providing an income for its producers.\\" However, Bauwens goes on to argue that the interdependence is mutual: the capitalist system and market economies are also dependent on p2p production, particularly on distributed networks of information processing and production. Consequently, p2p economy may be seen as extending or already existing outside the sphere of free/open source software production and other non-rival immaterial goods. This idea is explored also in the essay Peer to Peer and Human Evolution that expands the P2P meme beyond computer technology. It argues that egalitarian networking is a new form of relationship that is emerging throughout society, and profoundly transforming the way in which society and human civilization is organised. The essay argues that this new form of non-representational democracy is a crucial ingredient in finding the solutions to current global challenges; as well as a new and progressive ethos representing the highest aspirations of the new generations.

Rassenhygiene is a form of eugenics. Life and career Alfred Ploetz was born in Swinem√ºnde, Germany (now ≈öwinouj≈õcie, Poland) and he grew up and attended school in Breslau (now Wroc≈Çaw). At this time he began his friendship with Carl Hauptmann, brother of the famous author Gerhart Hauptmann. In 1879 he founded a secret racist youth society. In Gerhart Hauptmann's Drama \\"Vor Sonnenaufgang\\" (Before Sunrise) which was first performed on October 20, 1889, in Berlin, the key figure of the journalist Loth is based on Ploetz. After school Ploetz at first studied political economy in Breslau. There he joined the \\"Freie wissenschaftliche Vereinigung\\" (free scientific union). Among his friends were ‚Äì besides his brother ‚Äì his former school friend Ferdinand Simon (later son-in-law of August Bebel), the brothers Carl and Gerhart Hauptmann, Heinrich Laux, and Charles Proteus Steinmetz. This circle enthusiastically read the works of Ernst Haeckel and Charles Darwin. Carl Hauptmann was a student of Ernst Haeckel, and Gerhart Hauptmann and Ploetz attended some of his lectures. The group expanded and developed a plan of founding a colony in one of the pacific states and established itself as the \\"Pacific association\\". They planned a \\"community on friendly, socialist and maybe also pan-Germanic basis\\". In consequence of the prosecution of socialistically minded persons in application of Otto von Bismarck's anti-socialist laws (1878‚Äì1890), in 1883 Ploetz fled to Zurich, where he continued to study political economy with Julius Platter (1844‚Äì1923). In his memoirs Ploetz states as an important reason for his choice of Zurich that in his studies in Breslau socialist theories were only incidentally mentioned. After living for a half a year in the United States, Ploetz returned to Zurich and began to study medicine. In 1886, he fell in love with a fellow student Agnes Bluhm despite being involved with Pauline R√ºdin. They decided to get married early in 1887. Ploetz was also seeing an American named Mary Sherwood who was studying hypnotism. In 1890 Ploetz became medical doctor and married his former girlfriend Pauline, though the two never had children. Bluhm however kept Ploetz as a close friend throughout her life and they both shared similar views on racial purity and the benefits of eugenics. Ploetz and his wife lived in the US for four years, and divorced in 1898. Ploetz later married Anita Nordenholz. This marriage produced three children: Ulrich (called Uli), Cordelia (called Deda) and Wilfrid (called Fridl, 1912‚Äì2013). Nazi Germany This poster (from around 1938) reads: \\"60,000 Reichsmark is what this person suffering from a hereditary defect costs the People's community during his lifetime. Fellow citizen, that is your money too. Read '[A] New People', the monthly magazine of the Bureau for Race Politics of the NSDAP.\\" Ploetz first proposed the theory of racial hygiene (race-based eugenics) in his \\"Racial Hygiene Basics\\" (Grundlinien einer Rassenhygiene) in 1895. In 1904 Ploetz founded the periodical \\"Archiv f√ºr Rassen-und Gesellschaftsbiologie\\" with Fritz Lenz as chief editor, and in 1905 the German Society for Racial Hygiene (De Berliner Gesellschaft fur Rassenhygiene) with 31 members. page Schafft, Gretchen Engle: \\"From Racism to Genocide: Anthropology in the Third Reich\\". University of Illinois Press. 2004. Pg. 42. In 1907 the society became the \\"International Society for Racial Hygiene\\". In 1930 he became an honorary doctor of the University of Munich. Ploetz was a supporter of the Nazi Party, which took power in 1933. Ploetz wrote in April 1933 that he believed Hitler would bring racial hygiene from its previous marginality into the mainstream. In 1933 Reich Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick established an \\"expert advisory committee for population and racial policy,\\" which included Ploetz, Fritz Lenz, Ernst R√ºdin and Hans F.K. G√ºnther. This expert advisory committee had the task of advising the Nazis on the implementation and enforcement of legislation regarding racial and eugenic issues.Anahid S.

He died at the age of 79 and is buried at his home in Herrsching on the Ammersee in Bavaria. After his death, Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer praised his \\"inner sympathy and enthusiasm [with] the National Socialist Movement\\".Otmar von Verschuer, \\"Alfred Ploetz,\\" in The Erbarzt, Bd 8 p.69-72, 1940, p.71 Ernst R√ºdin, also a committed National Socialist, praised Ploetz two years before as a man \\"by his meritorious services has helped to set up our Nazi ideology.\\"Ernst Rudin: \\"Honor of Prof. Dr. Alfred Ploetz,\\" in ARGB, Bd 32 / S.473‚Äì474, 1938, p.474 Theories In his book The efficiency of our race and the protection of the weak (1895) he described a society in which eugenic ideas were applied. Society would examine the moral and intellectual capacity of citizens to decide on marriage and the permitted number of children. It may also include a prohibition on reproduction. Disabled children are euthanized at birth, while every young person would undergo an examination at puberty to determine if they would be permitted to marry and have children. Society would be regulated strictly to insure equal opportunity. Those who failed would starve. Ploetz found this idea horrible, and suggested as a humane alternative simply encouraging only \\"fit\\" people to reproduce, though he said this was a weak proposal.\\"Die T√ºchtigkeit unserer Rasse und der Schutz der Schwachen\\", 1893, p. 144-47. cited by The descent of Darwin: the popularization of Darwinism in Germany, 1860-1914, Alfred Kelly, Chapel Hill, University of North Carolina Press 1981, , p. 107 Along with many other eugenicists in Europe and America, Ploetz believed in the superiority of the Nordic race. His writings were a major influence on Nazi ideology. His opinion of the Jewish Question changed during the course of his life, but his view and the doctrine of the NSDAP were in accord by the time the party came to power in 1933. In his early writings Ploetz credited Jews as the second highest cultural race after Europeans.\\"Wir haben frueher die Juden neben den Westariern als hoechstentwickelte Culturrasse angefuehrt.\\" Ploetz, 137 He identified no substantial difference in \\"racial character\\" between Aryans and Jews, arguing that the mental abilities of Jews and their role in the development of human culture made them indispensable to the \\"process of racial mix\\" which would enhance humanity. > The high aptitude of the Jews and their outstanding role in the progress of > mankind considering men like Jesus, Spinoza, Marx has to be kindly > acknowledged without hesitation...

He stressed that the distinctiveness of Jews indicated that their mental characteristics would adversely affect Aryans by introducing individualism and lack of love for the military and the nation. He favored the global dominance of the Aryan race.Julia Sch√§fer: \\"Vermessen ‚Äì gezeichnet ‚Äì verlacht Judenbilder in popul√§ren Zeitschriften 1918‚Äì1933.\\" Campus Verlag, 2005, , p. 182 Bibliography * (Alfred Hoche, Alfred Ploetz, Alfred Vierkandt, Carl Hans Heinze Sennhenn) German Eugenicists: ' * (Alfred J Ploetz) Die T√ºchtigkeit unsrer Rasse und der Schutz der Schwachen ' * (Alfred J Ploetz) Archiv f√ºr Rassen- und Gesellschafts-Biologie, einschliesslich Rassen- und Gesellschafts-Hygiene 1908, Fuenfter Jahrgang '  See also  *Ernst Rudin *Eugen Fischer *Eugenics *Karl Binding *Racial hygiene *Wilhelm Schallmayer References External links * Category:1860 births Category:1940 deaths Category:People from ≈öwinouj≈õcie Category:Physicians in the Nazi Party Category:German biologists Category:German eugenicists Category:People from the Province of Pomerania ","title":"Alfred Ploetz"},{"id":"2147759","text":"Eldorado High School is a public high school in Clark County, Nevada, United States. The school is a part of the Clark County School District, located in Sunrise Manor, an unincorporated area on the northeast part of the Las Vegas Valley, south of Nellis Air Force Base. Its team mascot is the Sundevils and its school colors are maroon and gold. History Eldorado High School was established in 1973 on an open desert lot just west of the Las Vegas Wash between Washington and Bonanza Roads. The school opened in September 1973 along with Chaparral High School, which brought the total number of major high schools in the Las Vegas Valley to eight, including Bishop Gorman, a private Catholic high school. For the first 15 years, Eldorado's zoning covered all of the Sunrise Mountain area north of Charleston Boulevard and east of Pecos Road, which resulted in a total school attendance of more than 2,000. The largest known class to graduate from Eldorado to date was in 1985, graduating about 550 student). The majority of the students are former students of Dell H. Robison Middle School, O'Callaghan Middle School, Monaco Middle School and Bailey Middle School. In the 1980s, Eldorado received former students from Robison and Von Tobel Middle Schools as well as a handful from Roy Martin Middle School. Today, its zoning border covers areas east of Nellis Boulevard, north of Bonanza Road and south of Owens Avenue. School layout Its campus is bordered by Washington Avenue, Linn Lane, Harris Avenue and Christy Lane, built with an enclosed building (no windows), an American football stadium with an asphalt running track (one of the first high schools in Las Vegas to have such a track) and a state of the art \\"sportatorium\\", used for basketball, volleyball and wrestling as well as assemblies and other school-related activities. Three other Las Vegas area schools were built this way: Basic High School, Bonanza High School and the Southeast Career Technical Academy (also known as Vo-Tech); all built in the early to mid-1970s along with Eldorado. Basic and Bonanza were built according to the same blueprints as Eldorado. In 2007, the former facilities of Bishop Gorman were purchased by CCSD to house the rising number of freshmen and to ease overcrowding at the main campus. Eldorado Preparatory Academy, the name of the temporary ninth grade campus, closed in spring 2009 when students were rezoned to Sunrise Mountain High School. Sundevil Theater The campus is the location of the Sundevil Theater. The theater has put on many plays, including The Curious Savage and Carousel. Extracurricular activities The Sundevils compete in the Sunrise 4A Region and are classified as a 4A school, the largest classification in Nevada according to the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association. =Athletics= Wrestling One of the most successful athletics program at Eldorado has been wrestling; the school has won 12 state championships. The Sundevils were ranked 12th of the High School Scholastic Dynasty Teams of the Last Decade. Other sports The school has held a state championship in each of American football (1991), boys' basketball (1985), baseball (1990) and soccer (2013). Eldorado also holds Nevada state championships in track and field. Naval Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps Eldorado High School's Naval Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps (NJROTC) Unit, established not long after the school opened, is a part of Naval District 13, and has received multiple awards recognizing the Sundevil Battalion as both an Honor Unit (top 10% of units in the Naval District) and a Chief of Naval Education and Training Command Honor Unit (top 10% of all NJROTC Units) over the years. =Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association State championships= * American football ‚Äì 1991 * Baseball ‚Äì 1990 * Basketball (boys) ‚Äì 1985 * Basketball (girls) ‚Äì 1978 * Cross country (boys) ‚Äì 1979, 1980, 1981 * Track & field ‚Äì 1988, 1990, 1991, 1992 * Soccer (boys) - 2013 * Wrestling ‚Äì 1980, 1981, 1982, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995 =The Merlin Olsen Cleat= Every year, since 1974, Eldorado and Chaparral hold their rivalry game, in which the winner takes possession of a bronzed cleat once owned by the former Los Angeles Rams star Merlin Olsen. \\\\- Notable alumni * Arianny Celeste, UFC Ring Girl and Fitness model * Leah Dizon, singer and model * Steven Jackson, American football player for the St. Louis Rams * Casey Kingsland, NASCAR driver * Ricardo Laguna, BMX professional * Eric Ludwick, baseball player for the Oakland Athletics, St. Louis Cardinals, Florida Marlins * Brandon Rock, US track and field NCAA 800 meter champion, participated in the 1996 Olympics at Atlanta References Category:Clark County School District Category:Educational institutions established in 1973 Category:High schools in Clark County, Nevada Category:School buildings completed in 1973 Category:Buildings and structures in Sunrise Manor, Nevada Category:Public high schools in Nevada Category:1973 establishments in Nevada ","title":"Eldorado High School (Nevada)"},{"id":"2147769","text":"National Economic Security and Recovery Act (NESARA) was a set of proposed economic reforms for the United States suggested during the 1990s by Harvey Francis Barnard. Barnard claimed that the proposals, which included replacing the income tax with a national sales tax, abolishing compound interest on secured loans, and returning to a bimetallic currency, would result in 0% inflation and a more stable economy. The proposals were never introduced before Congress. NESARA has since become better known as the subject of a cult-like conspiracy theory promoted by Shaini Candace Goodwin, doing business as \\"Dove of Oneness\\", who claimed that the act was actually passed with additional provisions as the National Economic Security and Reformation Act, and then suppressed by the George W. Bush administration and the Supreme Court. Goodwin's conspiracy emails have been translated into several languages and have a large following online. Monetary reform proposal Harvey Francis Barnard (1941‚Äì2005), a Louisiana State University graduate in systems philosophy, and an engineering consultant and teacher, created the NESARA proposal during the late 1980s and early 1990s. He printed 1,000 copies of his proposal, titled Draining the Swamp: Monetary and Fiscal Policy Reform (1996), and sent copies to members of Congress, believing it would pass quickly on its merits. Based on a theory that debt is the number one economic factor inhibiting the growth of the economy, and compound interest the number one \\"moral evil\\" and reason for debt, Barnard made several other attempts during the 1990s to draw political attention to the problems he saw in the US economy, and his suggested economic recovery proposal based on the root causes he determined. After these did not succeed, he decided in 2000 to release the proposal to the public domain and publish it on the internet. Barnard established the NESARA Institute in 2001, and published the second edition of his book in 2005, retitling it Draining the Swamp: The NESARA Story ‚Äì Monetary and Fiscal Policy Reform. Also reproduced here by the Cult Education Institute. Retrieved 21 April 2020. Dove of Oneness Soon after Barnard released NESARA on the internet, a user known as \\"Dove of Oneness\\" began posting about it in internet forums. \\"Dove of Oneness\\" was later identified as Shaini Candace Goodwin, a former student of The Ramtha School Of Enlightenment, referred to in the media as a \\"cybercult queen.\\" According to Goodwin's website, the NESARA bill languished in Congress before finally being passed by a secret session in March 2000 and signed by President Bill Clinton. It is claimed that the new law was to be implemented at 10 a.m. on September 11, 2001, but that the computers, and data (of the beneficiaries of the trillions of dollars of \\"Prosperity funds\\") were destroyed on the second floor of one of the World Trade Center towers in New York City during the terrorist attacks. Supposedly an earlier gag order issued by the Supreme Court had prohibited any official or private source from discussing it, under penalty of death. Goodwin referred to \\"White Knights,\\" most of them high-ranking military officials, who have since been struggling to have the law implemented despite opposition by President George W. Bush. Goodwin allegedly believes and purports that Bush orchestrated the September 11 attacks and the Iraq War as distractions from NESARA. Goodwin's description of NESARA goes far beyond Barnard's proposal by cancelling all personal debts, abolishing the Internal Revenue Service, declaring world peace, and requiring new presidential and congressional elections. Goodwin often claimed that Bush officials were attempting to hack into and bring down her web site to prevent her from publicizing the law. Goodwin began commenting on NESARA in connection with Omega Trust, a fraudulent investment scheme whose creator, Clyde Hood, was on trial at the time. According to Goodwin, Omega Trust investors would receive their returns after NESARA was announced. Goodwin repeatedly predicted that the NESARA announcement would occur in the very near future, although in later years she became more reserved in these predictions. =Other developments= After Goodwin began commenting on NESARA, other internet-based conspiracy theorists latched onto it. One supporter, Sheldan Nidle, ties the imminent NESARA announcement into his years-old prophecy of an imminent large scale UFO visitation by benevolent aliens (occasionally on his website reports, but more prominently in his videos, seminars and public appearances). Jennifer Lee, who used to publish internet NESARA status reports almost daily on her now defunct site, discussed a host of other-worldly and \\"interdimensional\\" beings who are helping behind the scenes to get NESARA announced. Internet evangelist Sherry Shriner, who operates many websites, sees NESARA as linked to malevolent reptiloid aliens she feels have long controlled the U.S. Government. NESARA groups are known for certain to exist and to have attracted press attention in Utah, and the Netherlands. Members of these groups get together to discuss the status of NESARA, read the various reports, hold protests, and pass out fliers about NESARA to the public. Goodwin claims that NESARA groups exist throughout several nations and US states including California, Washington, Arizona, and Texas, and provides hundreds of pieces of photographic evidence of people in public protests holding NESARA banners, includes several photo galleries: NTAT in action - July 4th 2005; but it is not clear to what degree the people holding the banners are aware of what NESARA is, or for how long these groups were active. The News Tribune has traced the story behind at least some of these photos (photos of trucks driving around Washington, D.C. bearing the words \\"NESARA Announcement Now!\\"), and found that they were part of a $40,000 advertising campaign allegedly paid for an elderly San Francisco resident who had made donations to Goodwin. Criticism and comparison to a cult Barnard became aware of Goodwin's description of NESARA before his death in 2005. He denied that NESARA had been enacted into law or even assigned a tracking number, and condemned Goodwin's allegations as a disinformation campaign. Goodwin, for her part, dismisses the NESARA Institute as a disinformation front for the Bush family. Critics consider NESARA to be a cult. Pointing to the fact that Goodwin, Lee, and Nidle frequently solicited donations from their readers, they accuse these leaders to be primarily interested in securing a steady stream of income for themselves. Goodwin, who also asked readers to donate their frequent flyer miles, claimed that she needed and had used the funds to travel to various locations around the world to secretly meet with high-level government officials about getting NESARA announced. Some NESARA supporters also make the claim that otherworldly beings are working to get NESARA announced. These include a \\"channeled\\" cosmic being called \\"Hatonn\\" Ward claims to write books that are \\"channeled\\" from her son, Matthew, who died in April, 1980 at the age of 17. The message cited is claimed to be channeled through a higher level cosmic being named Hatonn (an android Pleiadean), and another named Sananda. According to some proponents of Ascended Master Teachings, such as Joshua David Stone, Sheldan Nidle, and Luis Prada, Sananda is the \\"galactic name\\" of Ascended Master Jesus, which he uses in his role as Commander-in-Chief of the Ashtar Command flying saucer fleet. Pallas Athena is regarded as being the Vice-Commander of the saucer fleet. Ashtar (Ashtar Sheran) is regarded in these teachings as being third-in- command. The designation of George W. Bush as a disguised reptilian often co- occurs with this claim. Goodwin has claimed that Ascended Master Saint Germain has come down from the etheric plane to physically meet with heads of banks and world leaders regarding the NESARA announcement. The prominence of failed prophecy also lends support to the cult theory. NESARA supporters often tell their readers that the NESARA announcement is going to happen in a matter of days. These claims have been made too many times to enumerate, without ever coming to fruition. According to the documentary Waiting For NESARA, the claim was also made prior to March 2003 that George Bush was planning the war with Iraq only to further delay the NESARA announcement. It was prophesied that spiritual beings and UFOs would intervene with Bush's plans and prevent the war. A June 2006 complaint to the Washington consumer protection division accused Goodwin of using the NESARA story to defraud a 64-year-old San Francisco woman of at least $10,000. The woman's daughter said the actual amount is much larger, in the hundreds of thousands.

Rhythmic contemporary never uses rock or country in its airplay, but it may occasionally use a reggae, Latin, reggaeton, or a Christian/gospel hit. Essentially, the format is a cross between mainstream radio and urban contemporary radio formats. Format history Although some top-40 stations such as CKLW in Windsor/Detroit made their mark by integrating a large amount of R&B; and soul product into their predominantly pop playlists as early as 1967, such stations were still considered mainstream top 40 (a cycle that continues to dominate the current Top 40/CHR chart). It was not until the disco era of the late 1970s that such stations came to be considered as a format of their own as opposed to top-40 or soul. This development was largely spurred by the highly successful \\"worst-to-first\\" debut of the disco-based format on WKTU on 92.3 FM in New York City (now WNYL) in 1978. That station was classified as disco but actually played a blend of disco, dance music, and pop crossovers. At that time, stations playing strictly R&B; tracks were known as \\"black\\" or \\"soul\\" stations. Stations such as WKTU came to be known as urban contemporary in the early 1980s as the disco era ended. In the 1980s, many urban contemporary stations began to spring up. Most of these leaned more towards R&B; than dance music. These urban stations began sounding identical to so-called black stations and by 1985, stations that played strictly R&B; product were all known as urban stations. Still, some urban outlets continued adding artists from outside the format onto their playlist. In most cases it was dance and rhythmic pop but in other cases they added a few rock songs. For example, Detroit's successful WDRQ included artists such as Cyndi Lauper, Culture Club and The Romantics in its urban format circa 1984. But it wasn't until January 11, 1986 that KPWR in Los Angeles, a former struggling adult contemporary outlet, began to make its mark with this genre by adopting this approach. It would be known as crossover because of the musical mix and the avoidance of most rock at the time. Shortly afterward WQHT in New York adopted a similar crossover format and enjoyed similar ratings success. The new breed of crossover stations broke a number of popular artists, including Expose and The Cover Girls, but such artists couldn't reach either the Billboard Hot 100 or Hot Black Singles charts because their airplay was split between a handful of mainstream top-40 and black reporting stations. Billboard magazine thus debuted its first rhythmic top-40 airplay chart, the \\"Hot Crossover 30,\\" in its February 28, 1987 issue. The Crossover panel's initial lineup of 18 stations included five exclusive Crossover reporters (KPWR, WQHT, WHQT Miami, WMYK Norfolk, and WOCQ Ocean City, MD) as well as 13 stations which also retained their prior CHR or black reporter status (among them WPOW Miami, WHRK Memphis, KMEL San Francisco, WHYT Detroit, WQUE New Orleans, WLUM Milwaukee. and XHRM Tijuana/San Diego). This was the first rhythmic top-40 airplay chart in any radio/records trade magazine. The chart's first number one song was \\"Lean on Me\\" by Club Nouveau.Freeman, Kim. \\"Hot 30 Crossover Chart Tracks New Breed of Radio.\\" Billboard magazine, 28 February 1987, p. 1. Today, Mega 97ONE in Santa Maria broadcasts such a format. For years since its inception, the rhythmic name has been a source of confusion among music trades, especially in both Billboard (which used the Rhythmic Top 40 title) and Radio & Records (which use the CHR/rhythmic title for their official charts). In August 2006 Billboard dropped both the \\"top 40\\" and \\"CHR\\" name from the rhythmic title after its sister publication Billboard Radio Monitor merged with Radio & Records to become the \\"New\\" R&R; as part of their realignment of format categories. The move also ended confusion among the radio stations who report to their panels, which was modified by the end of 2006 with the inclusion of non-monitored reporters that were holdovers from the \\"(Old) R&R;\\" days. Still, over the years since its inception, the genre has grown and evolved in its position between traditional R&B; outlets (who claim that the Rhythmic contemporary format does not target or serve the African-American community properly) and the traditional Top 40 hit stations. However, both R&B; and mainstream top 40 outlets have taken cues from the Rhythmic contemporary format through the years; as of 2018, the cycle continues to dominate the current Top 40/CHR playlist as more Rhythmic and EDM songs are making their way onto the Mainstream chart. An offshoot format of rhythmic contemporary is rhythmic adult contemporary, which targets an adult audience with a mix of current rhythmic hits and gold tracks (often termed \\"Throwbacks\\") which may date as far back as the 1980s or even the disco era of the 1970s. As with Rhythmic CHR, Rhythmic AC may vary depending on the market as to how much hip- hop and R&B; product are included in the playlist; for example, the current WKTU (one of the late 1990s pioneers of the recent crop of Rhythmic AC stations) leans toward pop and dance, while WBQT in Boston is very hip-hop heavy.

He was a Quraysh leader and a member of the Banu 'Abdu Shams clan of Quraish tribe. Family =Family lineage= ‚ÄòUqbah was the son of Abu Mu‚Äòay·π≠ ibn Abu ‚ÄòAmr ibn Umayyah ibn ‚ÄòAbd Shams and of Shayma bint Abd-al-Uzza from the Banu Amir. Abu Mu'ayt's mother was Kabsha bint Abd al-Manat from Banu Amir.

London: Ta-Ha Publishers. All of his children became Muslims. Role of 'Uqbah in opposing Muhammad Uqbah was one the neighbors of Muhammad. Yet he assaulted Muhammad verbally and physically as he was preaching monotheismSahih Bukhari: Volume 6, Book 60, Number 339 He also constantly ridiculed Muhammad when the latter was preaching in Mecca. On one occasion, when Muhammad was praying in the courtyard of the Ka'ba, Uqba brought the waste of a slaughtered camel (intestines, blood, dung, etc.) upon the suggestion of other Quraysh leaders who were gathered there, and placed it upon Muhammad's back while he was in prostration. They laughed so much so that they fell on each other. He remained in that position due to the weight, unable to lift his head from prostration until his daughter came and removed it.Sahih Bukhari: Volume 1, Book 9, Number 499 On another occasion, Uqba spat on Muhammad's face at the incitement of his friend Ubay ibn Khalaf. According to the Islamic tradition, the Quranic verse was revealed at that moment to Muhammad regarding Uqba and Ubay.Ibn Ishaq, Sirat Rasul Allah (The Life of Muhammad), A. Guillaume, tr. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1980), pp. 164-165. Uqbah was also one of those enemies of Muhammad who rejoiced at the news of the death of Muhammad's second son 'Abdullah. Ubayy ibn Khalaf ibn Wahb ibn ·∏§udhƒÅfa was a very close friend of ‚ÄòUqbah. When Ubayy came to know that ‚ÄòUqba had sat and listened to the apostle, he told ‚ÄòUqbah, ‚ÄòDo I hear that you have sat with Muhammad and listened to him? I swear I will never see you or speak to you again if you do the same again, or if you do not go and spit in his face.‚Äô ‚ÄòUqba indeed did this so that Allah sent down concerning the pair of them: ‚ÄúOn the day that the sinner bites his hands, saying, would that I had chosen a path with the apostle.‚Äù (Sura 25: 27) The Life of Mu·∏•ammad: A Translation of ibn Is·∏•ƒÅq‚Äôs Sƒ´rat Rasul AllƒÅh with introduction & notes by Alfred Guillaume, Oxford University Press, 1955, page 164 Death According to numerous authentic and trustworthy sources such as a number of narrations in Sahih Bukhari, and Ibn Sa'd's biographical compendium, the Tabaqat Al-Kubra, Uqba was killed in the field of battle, during the Battle of Badr and was among those Quraysh leaders whose corpses were buried in a pit.Sahih Bukhari: Volume 1, Book 4, Number 241Sahih Bukhari: Volume 1, Book 9, Number 499Al Tabaqat-al-Kubra, Muhammad Ibn Sa'd, Volume 2, p.260, ghazwatul Badr, Darul Ihya'it-Turathil-'Arabi, Beirut, Lebanon, First Edition, (1996) However, according to Ibn Hisham's biography, Uqba was executed on the order of Muhammad by Asim bin Thaabit as a prisoner after the Battle of Badr.

He undertook three voyages up this river from 1875 to 1877. The first was conducted in the steamer SS Ellengowan and the other two in a smaller ship named the \\"Neva\\" which was chartered from the Government of New South Wales. Throughout the three voyages, D'Albertis was consistently involved in skirmishes with the various indigenous people living along the river, using rifle-fire, rockets and dynamite to intimidate and, on occasions, kill these local people. He also frequently employed destructive dynamite fishing as a technique of obtaining aquatic specimens for his collection. His expedition stole many ancestral remains, tools and weapons from the houses of the locals. He also collected specimens of birds, plants, insects and the heads of recently killed native people. Contemporary explorers and colonial administrators of d'Albertis were almost universally critical of the methods employed by D'Albertis in his expeditions up the Fly and more modern accounts, such as Goode's \\"Rape of the Fly\\" are equally condemnatory. Early life D'Albertis was born in 1841, in Voltri, Italy. At the age of eighteen he joined Garibaldi's army and later joined Odoardo Beccari in November 1871 on an expedition to western New Guinea. He reached the peak of Mount Arfak Geb but was compelled by fever to retreat and return to Sydney to recover. In 1874, D'Albertis returned to New Guinea to set up a base on Yule Island. Here he obtained notoriety for publicly kissing the most attractive young native women and passing it off as a customary sign of peace. He also, with a shell full of burning methylated spirits, ostentatiously threatened to set the ocean alight. Most of his companions and employees deserted him after these activities. 1875 journey up the Fly River D'Albertis conducted his first trip to the Fly River in the SS Ellengowan steamer which left from the British colonial port of Somerset on the tip of the Cape York peninsula. On board were Captain Runcie, Rev. MacFarlane and the Police Magistrate of Somerset, H.M. Chester with six troopers of the Queensland Native Police. Their first stop was Tawan Island where Chester rounded up the inhabitants and warned them against stealing from the missionaries in the area. To emphasise his point, he ordered his troopers to obliterate a nearby termite mound with rounds from their Snider Rifles. As they began to navigate up the Fly River, D'Albertis had a collision with the native people and after shooting a number of rounds at their watercraft, Chester and his troopers dispersed them causing them to flee in terror. As \\"a trophy of victory\\", Chester stole a sixty foot canoe and utilised it for firewood for the ship's engine. At other places along the river D'Albertis set off dynamite and rockets to both intimidate the indigenous people and to obtain aquatic life for food and specimen material. On their return downriver, they accepted an invitation from native people to enter their village, but Chester and his troopers, \\"wishing to intimidate them\\" decided to let off a number of shots, killing and stealing a couple of large domesticated pigs. Chester then proceeded to ransack the long-house of the village, taking ancestral and sacred human remains, weapons and other artefacts for D'Albertis' collection. 1876 journey to the Fly River D'Albertis' second sojourn to the river was on the \\"Neva\\" which was chartered from the Government of New South Wales. On board was Lawrence Hargrave, a future pioneer of aviation. D'Albertis again used rockets and dynamite as a weapons of fear. He removed intricate bark carvings on trees which he recognised was \\"perhaps a sacrilege\\" but did it anyway. Likewise, he stole ancestral bones from sacred long-houses claiming that \\"I shall turn a deaf ear to this sacrilege..I am too delighted with my prize\\". The Neva forced its way upstream until brought to a halt by the shallows. They then steamed downriver to a tributary d'Albertis had named the Alice River (today known as the Ok Tedi). Eventually stricken by malaria and crippled by rheumatism in both legs, he admitted defeat and returned to the Torres Strait. 1877 journey to the Fly River This was the final and probably the most eventful of the journeys of D'Albertis up the Fly River. On the first day of June, D'Albertis managed to get his crew and himself involved in a pitched battle with an armed flotilla of native watercraft. D'Albertis himself claimed to have fired about 120 shots in this skirmish which resulted in \\"some deaths\\" of indigenous people. None of his crew were killed but the hull of the \\"Neva\\" was riddled with arrows, some of which penetrated through the boards. For most of early July, D'Albertis was involved in daily clashes with native people along the river, shooting some of them dead. On one occasion, D'Albertis found the corpse of one of those killed and decided to decapitate him and preserve the head in spirits for his collection. He later killed one of his Chinese servants for refusing to go into the jungle to shoot specimens of local fauna. D'Albertis killed him by hitting him on the back a number of times with a bamboo cane which broke during the punishment. The other Chinese servants subsequently fled into the jungle, preferring to take their chances in unknown territory than to stay with the expedition. Returning downriver in late October, D'Albertis again had several affrays with indigenous people killing at least seven. In one of these battles, D'Albertis decided to \\"let them have it, and their blood be on their own heads\\". After this encounter he became extremely wary, ordering every native canoe to be shot at on sight. During this trip, as with the others, D'Albertis regularly engaged in dynamite fishing, claiming that \\"I think dynamite is..the best means to use, especially among coral reefs\\". Once back in the Torres Strait, two other deserters from his expedition brought charges against D'Albertis for murdering his Chinese servants. The police magistrate, H.M. Chester, a colleague of D'Albertis, promptly dismissed the charges and jailed the two Polynesian men for 16 weeks under charges of mutiny. D'Albertis wanted the men executed, but begrudgingly accepted the sentence. Not long after, D'Albertis returned to Europe with his bounty of stolen goods. His cousin, fellow explorer Enrico Alberto d'Albertis, housed many of Luigi's specimens at Castello D'Albertis. The castle is now home to the Museum of World Cultures. His natural history specimens from New Guinea are in the Natural History Museum of Giacomo Doria in Genoa. Criticisms and influences Later colonial administrators of British New Guinea such as Peter Scratchley, William MacGregor and John Hubert Plunkett Murray were critical of the methods employed by D'Albertis. Although these directors themselves engaged in various repressive and punitive policies against the native peoples, they recognised that the techniques of D'Albertis were very harmful in facilitating British colonisation. Andrew Goldie, an early British prospector to New Guinea, described an incident at a dinner in Sydney with D'Albertis where after having a steak accidentally thrown at him, the Italian \\"foamed with rage\\" and standing up in the restaurant with a bottle in his hand threatened to smash the skull of whoever owned up to being the thrower. D'Albertis however was not the first or last to implement such irresponsible plundering actions on the Fly and nearby rivers. Captain Blackwood, in 1846, of the H.M.S. Fly (after which the river is named) engaged in unapologetic raiding of villages on the river, including bombardment their houses. Also, a few years after D'Albertis' voyages, Captain John Strachan made an expedition up the nearby Mai Kussa river which was even more destructive than the Italian's. Strachan, who seems to have been in a chronic state of irrational paranoia and insomnia, improvised a torpedo-like weapon against a convey of native canoes causing a large amount of damage and casualties. In a high state of anxiety, Strachan later had to abandon his vessel and return to the coast on foot, committing massacres of indigenous people along the way. Strachan was later accused of being a \\"red-handed murderer who had tramped knee-deep in blood through New Guinea\\". He applied for protection from Lord Derby and subsequently no charges were laid. Eponyms A number of reptile species from New Guinea were named in honour of d'Albertis, but most have subsequently become synonyms of other species. *Gonyocephalus (Lophosteus) albertisii , now Hypsilurus papuensis (Papuan forest dragon) *Heteropus Albertisii , now Carlia bicarinata (bicarinate grassland skink) *Liasis albertisii , now Leiopython albertisii (northern white-lipped or d‚ÄôAlbertis python)Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

(\\"D'Albertis\\", p. 64). *Emydura albertisii , now Emydura subglobosa (red-bellied short-necked turtle) Only the python carries d‚ÄôAlbertis‚Äô name today. Several of these species were described by the German naturalist Wilhelm Peters and Giacomo Doria, the Italian naturalist and founder of the Natural History Museum of Giacomo Doria. Only Leiopython albertisii (the white-lipped python) is currently recognised as a valid species, the other three reptiles being synonymised within species described earlier, ironically two of which were described by entomologist Sir William John Macleay whose rival expedition on the Chevert, was also collecting specimens in southern Papua.

It was originally given by Kazuhiko Nishijima and Tadao Nakano in 1953, and led to the proposal of strangeness as a concept, which Nishijima originally called \\"eta-charge\\" after the eta meson. Murray Gell-Mann proposed the formula independently in 1956. The modern version of the formula relates all flavour quantum numbers (isospin up and down, strangeness, charm, bottomness, and topness) with the baryon number and the electric charge. Formula The original form of the Gell-Mann‚ÄìNishijima formula is: :Q = I_3 + \\\\frac{1}{2} (B+S)\\\\ This equation was originally based on empirical experiments. It is now understood as a result of the quark model. In particular, the electric charge Q of a quark or hadron particle is related to its isospin I3 and its hypercharge Y via the relation: :Q = I_3 + \\\\frac{1}{2} Y\\\\ :Y = 2(Q - I_3) Since the discovery of charm, top, and bottom quark flavors, this formula has been generalized. It now takes the form: :Q = I_3 + \\\\frac{1}{2} (B+S+C+B^\\\\prime+T) where Q is the charge, I3 the 3rd- component of the isospin, B the baryon number, and S, C, B‚Ä≤, T are the strangeness, charm, bottomness and topness numbers. Expressed in terms of quark content, these would become: :\\\\begin{align} Q &= \\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\left[\\\\left(n_\\\\text{u} - n_\\\\bar{\\\\text{u}}\\\\right) + \\\\left(n_\\\\text{c} - n_\\\\bar{\\\\text{c}}\\\\right) + \\\\left(n_\\\\text{t} - n_\\\\bar{\\\\text{t}}\\\\right)\\\\right] - \\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\left[\\\\left(n_\\\\text{d} - n_\\\\bar{\\\\text{d}}\\\\right) + \\\\left(n_\\\\text{s} - n_\\\\bar{\\\\text{s}}\\\\right) + \\\\left(n_\\\\text{b} - n_\\\\bar{\\\\text{b}}\\\\right)\\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ B &= \\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\left[\\\\left(n_\\\\text{u} - n_\\\\bar{\\\\text{u}}\\\\right) + \\\\left(n_\\\\text{c} - n_\\\\bar{\\\\text{c}}\\\\right) + \\\\left(n_\\\\text{t} - n_\\\\bar{\\\\text{t}}\\\\right) + \\\\left(n_\\\\text{d} - n_\\\\bar{\\\\text{d}}\\\\right) + \\\\left(n_\\\\text{s} - n_\\\\bar{\\\\text{s}}\\\\right) + \\\\left(n_\\\\text{b} - n_\\\\bar{\\\\text{b}}\\\\right)\\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ I_3 &= \\\\frac{1}{2}[(n_\\\\text{u}-n_\\\\bar{\\\\text{u}})-(n_\\\\text{d}-n_\\\\bar{\\\\text{d}})] \\\\\\\\\\\\ S &= -\\\\left(n_\\\\text{s} - n_\\\\bar{\\\\text{s}}\\\\right);\\\\quad C = +\\\\left(n_\\\\text{c} - n_\\\\bar{\\\\text{c}}\\\\right);\\\\quad B^\\\\prime = -\\\\left(n_\\\\text{b} - n_\\\\bar{\\\\text{b}}\\\\right);\\\\quad T = +\\\\left(n_\\\\text{t} - n_\\\\bar{\\\\text{t}}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} By convention, the flavor quantum numbers (strangeness, charm, bottomness, and topness) carry the same sign as the electric charge of the particle. So, since the strange and bottom quarks have a negative charge, they have flavor quantum numbers equal to ‚àí1. And since the charm and top quarks have positive electric charge, their flavor quantum numbers are +1.

She wrote more than fifty books specialising in historical fiction, but she also wrote non-fiction and short stories. Many of her novels, including her Suffolk Trilogy, follow the history of specific houses and their residents over several generations. Personal life Northgate House, Bury St Edmunds, home to Lofts from 1955 until her death in 1983 Lofts was born in Shipdham, Norfolk to Isaac Robinson and Ethel Garner, and grew up in Bury St Edmunds where was educated at Guildhall Feoffment Girls School and the County Grammar School for Girls in the town. In 1925 she attained a teaching diploma from Norwich Training College. She married Geoffrey Lofts in 1931 with whom she had one son, Clive. Geoffrey died in 1948. Lofts wed her second husband, a technical consultant to the British Sugar Corporation at the town's sugar beet factory, Robert Jorisch in 1949 she stood as a Town Councillor for Bury St Edmunds from 1957 to 1962, where she died in 1983. Work She also wrote under the pen names Peter Curtis and Juliet Astley. Lofts chose to release her murder-mystery novels under the pen name Peter Curtis because she did not want the readers of her historic fiction to pick up a murder-mystery novel and expect classic Lofts historical fiction. However, the murders still show characteristic Lofts elements. Most of her historical novels fall into two general categories: biographical novels about queens, among them Anne Boleyn, Isabella I of Castile, and Catherine of Aragon; and novels set in East Anglia centered around the fictitious town of Baildon (patterned largely on Bury St. Edmunds). Her creation of this fictitious area of England is reminiscent of Thomas Hardy's creation of \\"Wessex\\"; and her use of recurring characters such that the protagonist of one novel appears as a secondary character in others is even more reminiscent of William Faulkner's work set in \\"Yoknapatawpha County,\\" Mississippi. Lofts' work set in East Anglia in the 1930s and 1940s shows great concern with the very poor in society and their inability to change their conditions. Her approach suggests an interest in the social reformism that became a feature of British post-war society. She was not afraid to tackle potentially sensitive subjects; her version of the Nativity, with backstories of Mary, Joseph, the Magi, the shepherds - even the innkeeper - is rendered in How Far To Bethlehem? as is the ill-fated Donner Party expedition in Road to Revelation (aka Winter Harvest). Several of her novels were turned into films. Jassy was filmed as Jassy (1947) starring Margaret Lockwood and Dennis Price. You're Best Alone was filmed as Guilt Is My Shadow (1950). The Devil's Own (also known as The Little Wax Doll and Catch As Catch Can) was filmed as The Witches (1966). The film 7 Women (1966) was directed by John Ford and very loosely based on the story \\"Chinese Finale\\" by Norah Lofts. Her books still have a devoted international readership, notably on the Goodreads website. Honours In the United States, she won a National Book Award for I Met a Gypsy, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association. Specifically, her collection was \\"the 'forgotten book' of the year [1936] that least deserved to be forgotten\\" (subsequently termed the Bookseller Discovery). Alfred Knopf represented her at the ceremony. \\"5 Honors Awarded on the Year's Books: Authors of Preferred Volumes Hailed at Luncheon of Booksellers Group\\", The New York Times, 26 February 1937, page 23.

It is better known as the Rose Garden Project (). Background In the early 1980s, the Hong Kong Government already foresaw the incapability of the existing airport and container port to keep up with the growth of Hong Kong. The blueprints for the new airport and container port had already been drawn. However, the government decided to postpone the plan owing to the uncertainty of Hong Kong's future. After the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the government reproposed the plan in order to restore confidence among Hong Kong's populace. It presented a rosy picture for the future to the Hong Kong people in order to halt the wave of emigration.

It gained historical significance on November 22, 1963, as the location of Lee Harvey Oswald's arrest over the suspicion he was the killer of Dallas Police Officer J. D. Tippit. Today, it hosts a mix of repertory cinema and special events. History When first opened, fittingly on the anniversary day of Texas independence in 1931, the Texas Theatre was the largest suburban movie theater in Dallas and was part of a chain of theaters financed by Howard Hughes. It was the first theater in Dallas with air conditioning and featured many state-of-the-art luxuries. The theater is most famous for being the site of Lee Harvey Oswald's arrest on November 22, 1963. Warren \\"Butch\\" Burroughs, manager, and concession stand attendee the afternoon of Oswald's arrest said that Oswald came into the theater between 1:00 and 1:07 pm. Burroughs further claimed he sold Oswald popcorn at 1:15 p.m.Turner, Nigel. The Men Who Killed Kennedy, Part 4, \\"The Patsy\\", 1991. Julie Postal, the ticket seller, who was posted out in front of the entrance told the Warren Commission that Burroughs initially told her the same thing, although Burroughs later denied this. Julia Postal, however never saw the man enter the theater, relying on another's account, which according to the official governments report, happened at a later time. Texas Theatre patron, Jack Davis, also corroborated Burroughs' time, claiming he observed Oswald in the theatre prior to 1:20 pm. The films presented that day were Cry of Battle and War Is Hell, which Oswald briefly viewed. As a commemoration of the historic capture, the words \\"Lee Harvey Oswald, November 22, 1963\\" were later inscribed in gold paint on the chair Oswald (supposedly) occupied ‚Äî three rows from the rear, five seats from the aisle. However, the actual chair was removed by then manager \\"Butch\\" Burroughs, who took it home and replaced it with another which the FBI confiscated the next day for evidence thinking it was the original Oswald seat. The theater closed in 1989 and the Texas Theatre Historical Society (TTHS) purchased it the following year. This allowed Oliver Stone to remodel the exterior fa√ßade for his 1991 film, JFK. However, by 1992, the Society was no longer able to fund the property and the theater closed again. Former usher and sign changer Don Dubois of Texas Rosewin-Midway Properties saved the theater from the wrecking ball in 1993, but two years later, it was nearly destroyed by a five-alarm fire, forcing another closure. In 1996, Pedro Villa stepped in to rescue the theater from another plan which would have demolished the structure and replaced it with a furniture warehouse. However, he was unable to obtain financing to restore the theater and it defaulted to Texas Rosewin-Midway Properties. The fire-damaged building remained vacant for three years, open to vandals, stray animals, and the elements. In 2001, the Oak Cliff Foundation acquired the structure and began renovations after receiving $1.6 million from the Dallas Neighborhood Renaissance Partnership. Since then, the board of the Oak Cliff Foundation has raised an additional $2 million of the estimated $9 million needed for the complete renovation of the theater. The foundation used the funds to secure and restore the building needed after years of neglect and fire damage and the venue began hosting movies and special events soon after.

Field Guide to Candy: How to Identify and Make Virtually Every Candy Imaginable. Philadelphia: Quirk, 2009 At Italian and Greek weddings, the almonds are placed in groups of five, an odd number that is indivisible to symbolize the unity of husband and wife. In the Middle East, Jordan almonds are considered an aphrodisiac so there are always plenty on hand for the newlyweds and their guests. Jordan almonds are thought to originate in ancient Rome, where honey-covered almonds were introduced by a Roman baker and confectioner named Julius Dragatus. His confections were called dragati and were served by nobility at weddings and births. When sugar became more readily available in the 15th century, the nuts were coated in sugar instead. In Sulmona, Italy, the technique of creating the drag√©e almonds was perfected by the Pelino family. The term Jordan is most likely a corrupted version of the French word jardin, meaning \\"garden\\", hence, a cultivated rather than wild almond.Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, 17th edition, 2005, p. 750.The History of The ‚ÄúConfetti of Sulmona‚Äù and the Pelino House However, others suggest the term referred to a variety of almonds originally grown along the Jordan River characterized by long, thin, slender, rather smooth kernels in thick, heavy shells. Still others believe that Jordan is a corruption of the name of the town of Verdun in the northeast of France. In the 13th century, when the medieval crusaders brought sugar to Europe after their campaigns in the Holy Land, it was very valuable and considered medicinal. During that time, an apothecary in Verdun began coating other medicines with sugar (calling them drag√©es) to make them easier to take. The town of Verdun became very well known for its drag√©es de Verdun. = Panned chocolate = Other chocolate drag√©es with multi-colored candy shells include the M&M;'s, initially designed to allow easy transport and consumption of chocolate for the U.S. military, have evolved into a popular candy, but are also sold as decorative drag√©es in 25 different colors. = Medicinal drag√©es = Used to increase tolerability of bitter medication or merely to compel consumption, medicated candies or sugar-coated pills can be referred to as drag√©es. = Metallic decorative balls = A chocolate cake decorated with icing, strawberries, and silver metallic drag√©es Another form of drag√©e is a small sphere of sugar, in the Commonwealth often called a cachou, used primarily in the decoration of cookies, cakes, and other forms of bakery. These are produced in various sizes, typically in diameter. This is larger than nonpareils and smaller than large pearl tapioca. Silver drag√©es have long been used for both wedding and holiday food decoration. More recently, metallic gold, copper, rainbow colors (red, green, blue, etc.), and pearlescent colors have become available. In most countries, including the United Kingdom and France, silver drag√©es are classified as food items. However, since 1906, US regulations have prohibited the manufacture or sale of any food that uses any metal or mineral substance, including silver, as a food coloring, coating, or additive. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration considers the metallic-finish sugar drag√©es to be inedible, and they may be sold only when accompanied with a notice that they are to be used for decorative purposes only. Almonds that have been coated the same way are not permitted at all. Although the metallic-finish drag√©es can be purchased in 49 US states, they are no longer sold in California.

All five theaters are still standing. One operates as a community performing arts center; two are commercial live entertainment venues; and two are currently used as churches.

Partner Sam Katz would later run the Paramount-Publix theatre chain in New York City from the thirty-five story Paramount Theatre Building on Times Square. Balaban and Katz had developed the Wonder Theater concept, first publicized around 1918 in Chicago. The Chicago Theatre was created as an opulent theater with many amenities for its patrons and was advertised as a \\"wonder theatre\\". When Publix acquired the Balaban and Katz chain they embarked on a project to expand the wonder theaters, and started to build in New York in 1926. While Balaban and Publix were dominant in Chicago, Loew's was the major player in New York, and did not want Publix theaters to overshadow their own. The two companies brokered a non-competition deal for New York and Chicago, and Loew's took over the New York area projects, developing the five Loew's Wonder Theaters.

He was an army surgeon. Early life and career Ishihara graduated from medicine in 1905 on a military scholarship and immediately joined the Imperial Japanese Army as a doctor, serving mainly as a surgeon. He later changed specialties to ophthalmology. In 1908 he returned to the University of Tokyo where he dedicated himself to ophthalmic research. In 1910 he became an instructor at the Army Medical College. There, in addition to seeing patients, he conducted research on \\"battlefield ophthalmology\\" and how to select superior soldiers. While working at the Military Medical School he was asked to devise a test to screen military recruits for abnormalities of color vision. His assistant was a color blind physician who helped him test the plates. The first charts were hand painted by Ishihara in water colors using hiragana symbols. Ishihara color vision test One of the Ishihara plates The name Ishihara is known worldwide because of the color vision test he designed in 1918, where a subject is shown a coloured pattern and asked what numerals they see there. Subjects with different forms of color blindness give different answers to those without. Ishihara also developed a Japanese visual acuity chart and an apparatus for determining the near point, both currently in wide use in Japan. He also made significant contributions to the study of trachoma and myopia. In 1908, Ishihara entered the postgraduate course in ophthalmology at the Imperial University of Tokyo, studying under Jujiro Komoto. Subsequently, he studied in Germany under Professors Wolfgang Stock, Theodor Axenfeld and Carl von Hess. Ishihara was appointed the professor and chairman, to succeed Komoto, at the Ophthalmology Department of the Imperial University of Tokyo in 1922 and served until March 1940. Personal life Ishihara led a very modest life, with no interest in material possessions. He was greatly revered by his students who, after his retirement, built a cottage for him near a hot spring on the Izu Peninsula. There he served as a country doctor, conducting clinics for his neighbors, asking no payment. As was the custom in those days, patients left tokens of their gratitude in home-grown produce and small sums of money. After covering his expenses, Ishihara returned all remaining money to the villagers. These funds were used to build a library and a study room for the village children, a fitting tribute to the highly respected benefactor who came to live in their midst until his death in 1963.Japanese Journal of Ophthalmology, volume 38, issue 1. 1994 References Category:1879 births Category:1963 deaths Category:Color scientists Category:Japanese generals Category:Japanese ophthalmologists ","title":"Shinobu Ishihara"},{"id":"2147955","text":"The Defence Strategic Policy and Intelligence Group (SP&I;) of the Australian Government Department of Defence is responsible for defence diplomacy, strategic policy, international security, and military intelligence co- ordination and advice to the Prime Minister of Australia, Minister for Defence, Secretary of the Department of Defence, and Chief of the Defence Force.

He is believed to have originated the concept of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.  Biography  Arita was born on the island of Sado in Niigata Prefecture. He joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after graduation in 1909 from the Law School of Tokyo Imperial University, and established himself as an expert on Asian affairs. Arita was on the Japanese delegation to the Versailles Peace Treaty Conference of 1919, and in his early career also was stationed at the Japanese consulates in Mukden and in Honolulu. He served as Japanese ambassador to Austria in 1930. He returned to Japan to briefly serve as Vice Foreign Minister in 1932, but returned to Europe in 1933 as Japanese ambassador to Belgium. Arita became Foreign Minister under the cabinet of Prime Minister K≈çki Hirota in 1936, and continued to serve in that post under the administrations of Fumimaro Konoe and Kiichir≈ç Hiranuma and Mitsumasa Yonai. He was also a member of the House of Peers in the Diet of Japan from 1938. Arita was an opponent of the Tripartite Pact, and continually pushed for better relations with the United States. However, with the increasing power and influence of the military in Japanese politics, he was repeatedly forced to make compromises. After the end of the war, Arita successfully ran for a seat in the House of Representatives in 1953. He attempted to run for the office of Governor of Tokyo in 1955 and again in 1959, but lost both elections. He died in 1965, and his grave is at the Tama Cemetery in Fuch≈´, Tokyo.  Private affairs  Arita was a well- known political figure and his adultery with the hostess of a Ginza nightclub was publicized by the novel by Yukio Mishima. After its publication in 1960, Arita sued Mishima for invasion of privacy. The Tokyo District Court ruled in favor of Arita in 1963, marking the first time the right to privacy of a public figure had been recognized by a Japanese court.

Properties The principal invariants do not change with rotations of the coordinate system (they are objective, or in more modern terminology, satisfy the principle of material frame-indifference) and any function of the principal invariants is also objective. Calculation of the invariants of rank two tensors In a majority of engineering applications, the principal invariants of (rank two) tensors of dimension three are sought, such as those for the right Cauchy- Green deformation tensor. = Principal invariants = For such tensors the principal invariants are given by: : \\\\begin{align} I_1 &= \\\\mathrm{tr}(\\\\mathbf{A}) = A_{11}+A_{22}+A_{33} = \\\\lambda_1+\\\\lambda_2+\\\\lambda_3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ I_2 &= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( (\\\\mathrm{tr} \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\right) )^2 - \\\\mathrm{tr}(\\\\mathbf{A}^2) \\\\right) = A_{11}A_{22}+A_{22}A_{33}+A_{11}A_{33}-A_{12}A_{21}-A_{23}A_{32}-A_{13}A_{31} = \\\\lambda_1 \\\\lambda_2 + \\\\lambda_1 \\\\lambda_3 + \\\\lambda_2 \\\\lambda_3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ I_3 &= \\\\det (\\\\mathbf{A})= -A_{13} A_{22} A_{31} + A_{12} A_{23} A_{31} + A_{13} A_{21} A_{32} - A_{11} A_{23} A_{32} - A_{12} A_{21} A_{33} + A_{11} A_{22} A_{33} = \\\\lambda_1 \\\\lambda_2 \\\\lambda_3 \\\\end{align} For symmetric tensors these definitions are reduced. The correspondence between the principal invariants and the characteristic polynomial of a tensor, in tandem with the Cayley‚ÄìHamilton theorem reveals that :\\\\ \\\\mathbf{A}^3 - I_1 \\\\mathbf{A}^2 +I_2 \\\\mathbf{A} -I_3 \\\\mathbf{I}= 0 where \\\\mathbf{I} is the second-order identity tensor. = Main invariants = In addition to the principal invariants listed above, it is also possible to introduce the notion of main invariants : \\\\begin{align} J_1 &= \\\\lambda_1 + \\\\lambda_2 + \\\\lambda_3 = I_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ J_2 &= \\\\lambda_1^2 + \\\\lambda_2^2 + \\\\lambda_3^2 = I_1^2 - 2 I_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ J_3 &= \\\\lambda_1^3 + \\\\lambda_2^3 + \\\\lambda_3^3 = I_1^3 - 3 I_1 I_2 + 3 I_3 \\\\end{align} which are functions of the principal invariants above. = Mixed invariants = Furthermore, mixed invariants between pairs of rank two tensors may also be defined. Calculation of the invariants of order two tensors of higher dimension These may be extracted by evaluating the characteristic polynomial directly, using the Faddeev-LeVerrier algorithm for example. Calculation of the invariants of higher order tensors The invariants of rank three, four, and higher order tensors may also be determined. Engineering applications A scalar function f that depends entirely on the principal invariants of a tensor is objective, i.e., independent from rotations of the coordinate system. This property is commonly used in formulating closed-form expressions for the strain energy density, or Helmholtz free energy, of a nonlinear material possessing isotropic symmetry. This technique was first introduced into isotropic turbulence by Howard P. Robertson in 1940 where he was able to derive K√°rm√°n‚ÄìHowarth equation from the invariant principle. George Batchelor and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar exploited this technique and developed an extended treatment for axisymmetric turbulence.

The beach in the bay was once a naturist resort. The difficulties involved in getting to the bay on foot with high its surrounding hills , or by small boat because of turbulence in the nearby sea, made it the ideal place for nudists to swim and sunbathe. Because of the resort, the bay once became an attraction for hikers even after the activities ceased. Wok Tai in Cantonese means the bottom of the wok, a round-bottom pan. The bay named because its wok shape. Nudism In 1932, the European Lam Part () set up a nudist club in Heung Fan Liu () in Sha Tin. He later sold the premises in 1938 because the building of Shing Mun Reservoir in 1935 and the Japanese invasion of China in 1937 seriously affected his business. Between 1938 and 1941, he used his boat to take his nudist club members to the bay to continue their gathering. The number of members reached its height at around 20. During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong (1941‚Äì1945), he lost his boat and the club's activities were interrupted. He rented boats instead to take the members to the bay and reformed his club as a sunbathing club 1950s. On 1 January 1968 all nudist activities halted owing to insufficient participants. Tsing Ma Bridge The bay remained largely silent in the 1970s and 1980s, and only occasionally explorers came to find its past. The bay became more accessible when Hong Kong United Dockyards (HUD) was built closer to the bay in 1976. Tsing Yi Road was extended to the dockyard. The early 1990s saw construction of the Tsing Ma Bridge, an integral part of the Port and Airport Development Strategy The suspension bridge spans from the hill at the back of Wok Tai Wan.

A left-handed opening batsman, he made his One Day International (ODI) debut for Bangladesh in 2005 against England, and later the same year played his first Test. In 2008 he joined the Indian Cricket League (ICL) as part of the Dhaka Warriors. The members of the team were given 10-year bans by the Bangladesh Cricket Board which were lifted when they left the league. Nafees has since returned to the national team. Domestically he plays for Barisal Division.  Personal life  Nafees was born on May 1, 1985 at Combined Military Hospital in Dhaka Cantonment. He is the eldest of three sons of retired army officer Mohiuddin Ahmed and his wife Salma Anjum. He completed his secondary education from St Joseph Higher Secondary School in 2001 and his higher secondary education from Notre Dame College in 2003. Then, he got himself admitted into University of Dhaka in 2003-04 for his bachelor's degree. At University of Dhaka, Nafees met Ishita Tasmin, whom he married later. Both they have a son and a daughter. International career Nafees first played in the national team in Bangladesh's maiden tour of England (2005). Nafees scored his maiden first-class century, as well as his first in Tests, at Fatullah in April 2006 against Australia. He scored his maiden one- day hundred against Zimbabwe in August 2006. Nafees was the first Bangladeshi batsman to score a century in Champions Trophy history and he held the record for the highest individual score for Bangladesh in Champions Trophy until Tamim Iqbal surpassed his milestone Nafees was appointed vice-captain for the Champions Trophy in India in October 2006 with the view of grooming a successor for Habibul Bashar. The tournament was a successful one for him as he scored his second ODI century, again Zimbabwe were his opponents. He scored his third century against Zimbabwe again in November. Nafees finished 2006 with over 1,000 ODI runs, becoming the first Bangladeshi to pass the milestone in a calendar year. Once again available to play for Bangladesh, Nafees returned to the squad for the first time since joining the ICL in preparation for Bangladesh's home series against India in January. Bangladesh lost both Tests, and Nafees played in one, scoring 25 runs. His Test come-back lasted one match and Nafees would have to wait more than 18 months before playing another Test. He made his return in an ODI series against New Zealand in October 2010 in which he scored 35 as Bangladesh won that match and 73 in the next match as Bangladesh once again took a seven-wicket victory. Despite his good performance Nafees was originally selected on the grounds that Tamim Iqbal was injured and eventually made way for him in the series against Zimbabwe and he was placed on standby in case of an injury. In the first two years after his return from the ICL Nafees played just four ODIs. Included in Bangladesh's squad for the 2011 World Cup, Nafees played in two matches (scoring 42 runs) as the team exited the tournament in the group stage. He was retained in the squad to face Australia in three ODIs immediately after the World Cup finished in April, and struck two half-centuries that cemented his place in the side. Nafees was recalled to the squad to face Zimbabwe in August. In the one-off Test, his first since January 2010, he made scores of 50 and 9 as Bangladesh unexpectedly slid to defeat. After scoring 82 runs including a half-century in the first Test against the West Indies in October, Nafees endured a run of low scores across Tests and ODIs that jeopardised his place in the team. He responded by striking an innings of 97 against Pakistan in the second match of a two-Test series. The 180-run partnership was a landmark in several ways: it was record for Bangladesh's fifth wicket, the first time the team had batted through a whole session without losing a wicket since March 2010, and the team's first century partnership in Tests since June 2010. =Captaincy= He was the first T20I captain for Bangladesh and also he's the youngest T20I captain for Bangladesh at the age of 21 years and 211 days and he's 2nd only youngest to lead his team in T20I after Rodney Trott Domestic career In June 2008 Nafees joined the unauthorised Indian Cricket League and was given a ten-year ban by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) however he severed his ties with the league in September 2009 and was therefore available for national selection. The Bangladesh Cricket Board founded the six-team Bangladesh Premier League in 2012, a twenty20 tournament to be held in February that year. The BCB made Shahriar the 'icon player' for Barisal Burners. Despite his status, Nafees played just five matches, scoring 38 runs. In the 2nd edition of BPL held in 2013, he joined Khulna Royal Bengals. He was selected as the captain of the team. He scored the maiden century in BPL 2. Before him, no other Bangladeshi player scored a century in the history of BPL. He was the leading run-scorer for Agrani Bank Cricket Club in the 2017‚Äì18 Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League, with 550 runs in 13 matches.

OR 18 traverses the Salmon River Highway No. 39 of the Oregon state highway system, named after the river alongside its westernmost segments. Route description Oregon 18 interchange from US 101 north in Otis Junction OR 18 begins (at its western terminus) at a junction with U.S. Route 101, a few miles north of Lincoln City near Otis Junction. From there it winds eastward though the coast range along the Salmon River, past Rose Lodge and through a stand of timber known as the Van Duzer Corridor. Emerging from the coast range, it enters the fringes of the Willamette Valley in the community of Grand Ronde. It is briefly joined by Oregon Route 22 at a location known as Valley Junction, and overlaps OR 22 in a four-mile (6 km) stretch between Grand Ronde and Willamina, at which point OR 22 heads southeast towards Salem and OR 18 continues northeast towards the Portland area. Also in Willamina, a business route veers off to the north to serve the cities of Willamina and Sheridan; east of Sheridan the business route rejoins the mainline. This business loop was the former route and highway until 1957, when the current Oregon Route 18 was built as a bypass. Oregon 18 interchange from US 101 south in Otis Junction The highway continues northeast on a straight and level course through Willamette Valley farmland, including the community of Bellevue which intersects with Oregon Route 153, until it intersects with Oregon Route 99W just south of McMinnville. In the McMinnville area, OR 99W serves as the primary business route (entering the downtown core) whereas OR 18 is a bypass route. Two interchanges along OR 18 provide access to McMinnville, including Three-Mile Lane, a spur of the highway. Oregon Route 18 provides direct access to the McMinnville Airport and the Evergreen Aviation Museum, home of the Spruce Goose. East of McMinnville, Oregon Route 18 intersects Oregon Route 233, with which it overlaps until its eastern terminus, and Oregon Route 221; the latter near the city of Dayton. It then crosses over the Yamhill River to a second junction with OR 99W. OR 18 then follows OR 99W to Dundee, and follows the Newberg-Dundee bypass and terminates at a junction with OR 219. Typically, commuters continue north on OR 99W into the Portland area. The highway is rather variant in its configuration. For most of its length, the highway is a two-lane undivided highway, with intersections and cross traffic. There are some limited-access stretches in the \\"bypass\\" sections (around the Willamina/Sheridan area, and near McMinnville and Dayton), and the occasional interchange in these stretches. In addition, there is a stretch between Willamina and Sheridan where the highway becomes a 4-lane divided expressway. Oregon 18 approaching McMinnville For several years, Route 18 has had a rather notorious reputation among motorists in Oregon, with a relatively high number of fatal accidents. The opening of two casinos, one in Grand Ronde and one in Lincoln City, have greatly increased traffic on OR 18. (In addition, the stretch of Oregon Route 99W immediately north of Dayton, through Dundee and Newberg, is a notorious traffic bottleneck.) Portions of Oregon Route 18 have been designated a safety corridor. There are two proposed expansions to the highway. One is a project which would widen Oregon Route 18 to a four-lane expressway in the stretch between Grand Ronde and Willamina; an area where increased volume (largely due to the casino) has caused significant delays. This project is now completed with an overpass that closed down and blocked off a very fatal intersection. The second project, also now completed, is a new bypass around the Newberg- Dundee area intended to alleviate severe congestion that occurred along 99W. The Newberg-Dundee bypass is an expressway, numbered Oregon Route 18. Construction on the first phase began in June 2013, and the section opened at 5am on January 6, 2018. This section connects Oregon 219 south of Newberg to 99W west of Dundee. The entire bypass was expected to cost $262 million. It has four lanes and reconnects to 99W east of Newberg.

In a particular habitat shared by several species, each of the species is usually confined to its own microhabitat or spatial niche because two species in the same general territory cannot usually occupy the same ecological niche for any significant length of time. Overview In nature, organisms are neither distributed uniformly nor at random, forming instead some sort of spatial pattern. This is due to various energy inputs, disturbances, and species interactions that result in spatially patchy structures or gradients. This spatial variance in the environment creates diversity in communities of organisms, as well as in the variety of the observed biological and ecological events. The type of spatial arrangement present may suggest certain interactions within and between species, such as competition, predation, and reproduction. On the other hand, certain spatial patterns may also rule out specific ecological theories previously thought to be true. Although spatial ecology deals with spatial patterns, it is usually based on observational data rather than on an existing model. This is because nature rarely follows set expected order. To properly research a spatial pattern or population, the spatial extent to which it occurs must be detected. Ideally, this would be accomplished beforehand via a benchmark spatial survey, which would determine whether the pattern or process is on a local, regional, or global scale. This is rare in actual field research, however, due to the lack of time and funding, as well as the ever-changing nature of such widely- studied organisms such as insects and wildlife. With detailed information about a species' life-stages, dynamics, demography, movement, behavior, etc., models of spatial pattern may be developed to estimate and predict events in unsampled locations. History Most mathematical studies in ecology in the nineteenth century assumed a uniform distribution of living organisms in their habitat. In the past quarter century, ecologists have begun to recognize the degree to which organisms respond to spatial patterns in their environment. Due to the rapid advances in computer technology in the same time period, more advanced methods of statistical data analysis have come into use. Also, the repeated use of remotely sensed imagery and geographic information systems in a particular area has led to increased analysis and identification of spatial patterns over time. These technologies have also increased the ability to determine how human activities have impacted animal habitat and climate change. The natural world has become increasingly fragmented due to human activities; anthropogenic landscape change has had a ripple-effect impacts on wildlife populations, which are now more likely to be small, restricted in distribution, and increasingly isolated from one another. In part as a reaction to this knowledge, and partially due to increasingly sophisticated theoretical developments, ecologists began stressing the importance of spatial context in research. Spatial ecology emerged from this movement toward spatial accountability; \\"the progressive introduction of spatial variation and complexity into ecological analysis, including changes in spatial patterns over time\\". Concepts =Scale= In spatial ecology, scale refers to the spatial extent of ecological processes and the spatial interpretation of the data. The response of an organism or a species to the environment is particular to a specific scale, and may respond differently at a larger or smaller scale. Choosing a scale that is appropriate to the ecological process in question is very important in accurately hypothesizing and determining the underlying cause. Most often, ecological patterns are a result of multiple ecological processes, which often operate at more than one spatial scale. Through the use of such spatial statistical methods such as geostatistics and principal coordinate analysis of neighbor matrices (PCNM), one can identify spatial relationships between organisms and environmental variables at multiple scales. =Spatial autocorrelation= Spatial autocorrelation refers to the value of samples taken close to each other are more likely to have similar magnitude than by chance alone. When a pair of values located at a certain distance apart are more similar than expected by chance, the spatial autocorrelation is said to be positive. When a pair of values are less similar, the spatial autocorrelation is said to be negative. It is common for values to be positively autocorrelated at shorter distances and negative autocorrelated at longer distances. This is commonly known as Tobler's first law of geography, summarized as \\"everything is related to everything else, but nearby objects are more related than distant objects\\". In ecology, there are two important sources of spatial autocorrelation, which both arise from spatial-temporal processes, such as dispersal or migration: * True/inherent spatial autocorrelation arises from interactions among individuals located in close proximity. This process is endogenous (internal) and results in the individuals being spatially adjacent in a patchy fashion. An example of this would be sexual reproduction, the success of which requires the closeness of a male and female of the species. * Induced spatial autocorrelation (or 'induced spatial dependence') arises from the species response to the spatial structure of exogenous (external) factors, which are themselves spatially autocorrelated. An example of this would be the winter habitat range of deer, which use conifers for heat retention and forage. Most ecological data exhibit some degree of spatial autocorrelation, depending on the ecological scale (spatial resolution) of interest. As the spatial arrangement of most ecological data is not random, traditional random population samples tend to overestimate the true value of a variable, or infer significant correlation where there is none. This bias can be corrected through the use of geostatistics and other more statistically advanced models. Regardless of method, the sample size must be appropriate to the scale and the spatial statistical method used in order to be valid. =Pattern= Spatial patterns, such as the distribution of a species, are the result of either true or induced spatial autocorrelation. In nature, organisms are distributed neither uniformly nor at random. The environment is spatially structured by various ecological processes, which in combination with the behavioral response of species‚Äô generally results in: *Gradients (trends) steady directional change in numbers over a specific distance *Patches (clumps) a relatively uniform and homogenous area separated by gaps *Noise (random fluctuations) variation not able to be explained by a model Theoretically, any of these structures may occur at any given scale. Due to the presence of spatial autocorrelation, in nature gradients are generally found at the global level, whereas patches represent intermediate (regional) scales, and noise at local scales. The analysis of spatial ecological patterns comprises two families of methods; *Point pattern analysis deals with the distribution of individuals through space, and is used to determine whether the distribution is random. It also describes the type of pattern and draws conclusions on what kind of process created the observed pattern. Quadrat-density and the nearest neighbor methods are the most commonly used statistical methods. *Surface pattern analysis deals with spatially continuous phenomena. After the spatial distribution of the variables is determined through discrete sampling, statistical methods are used to quantify the magnitude, intensity, and extent of spatial autocorrelation present in the data (such as correlograms, variograms, and peridograms), as well as to map the amount of spatial variation. Applications =Research= Analysis of spatial trends has been used to research wildlife management, fire ecology, population ecology, disease ecology, invasive species, marine ecology, and carbon sequestration modeling using the spatial relationships and patterns to determine ecological processes and their effects on the environment. Spatial patterns have different ecosystem functioning in ecology for examples enhanced productive. =Interdisciplinary= The concepts of spatial ecology are fundamental to understanding the spatial dynamics of population and community ecology. The spatial heterogeneity of populations and communities plays a central role in such ecological theories as succession, adaptation, community stability, competition, predator-prey interactions, parasitism, and epidemics. The rapidly expanding field of landscape ecology utilizes the basic aspects of spatial ecology in its research. The practical use of spatial ecology concepts is essential to understanding the consequences of fragmentation and habitat loss for wildlife. Understanding the response of a species to a spatial structure provides useful information in regards to biodiversity conservation and habitat restoration. Spatial ecology modeling uses components of remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS). Statistical tests A number of statistical tests have been developed to study such relations. =Tests based on distance= Clark and Evans' R Clark and Evans in 1954 proposed a test based on the density and distance between organisms. Under the null hypothesis the expected distance ( re ) between the organisms (measured as the nearest neighbor's distance) with a known constant density ( œÅ ) is : r_e = \\\\frac { 1 } { 2 \\\\sqrt { \\\\rho } } The difference between the observed ( ro ) and the expected ( re ) can be tested with a Z test : Z = \\\\frac{ r_o - r_e } { SE } : SE = \\\\frac{ 0.26136 } { \\\\sqrt{ N \\\\rho } } where N is the number of nearest neighbor measurements. For large samples Z is distributed normally. The results are usually reported in the form of a ratio: R = ( ro ) / ( re ) Pielou's Œ± Pielou in 1959 devised a different statistic. She considered instead of the nearest neighbors the distance between an organism and a set of pre-chosen random points within the sampling area, again assuming a constant density. If the population is randomly dispersed in the area these distances will equal the nearest neighbor distances. Let œâ be the ratio between the distances from the random points and the distances calculated from the nearest neighbor calculations. The Œ± is : \\\\alpha = \\\\pi d \\\\omega where d is the constant common density and œÄ has its usual numerical value. Values of Œ± less than, equal to or greater than 1 indicate uniformity, randomness (a Poisson distribution) or aggregation respectively. Alpha may be tested for a significant deviation from 1 by computing the test statistic : \\\\chi^2_{ 2n } = 2 n \\\\alpha where œá2 is distributed with 2n degrees of freedom. n here is the number of organisms sampled. Montford in 1961 showed that when the density is estimated rather than a known constant, this version of alpha tended to overestimate the actual degree of aggregation. He provided a revised formulation which corrects this error. There is a wide range of mathematical problems related to spatial ecological models, relating to spatial patterns and processes associated with chaotic phenomena, bifurcations and instability.

He is currently the bassist of Filipino pop band Moonstar88 and indie band Cambio, and widely known as the member of the formerly disbanded and now reunited alternative rock band, Eraserheads. He also served as bassist to The Dawn and Hilera. Early life Zabala was born in Zamboanga City, Philippines and attended University of the Philippines Diliman in Quezon City. Eraserheads bassist (1989‚Äì2003) Zabala only began writing and singing songs as an Eraserhead starting with the band's 1996 Christmas album, Fruitcake. The album contains \\"The Fabulous Baker Boy\\" and \\"Fruit Fairy.\\" Buddy later also sang and wrote \\"Tama Ka\\" and \\"Kahit Ano\\" in the 1999 album, Natin99. Buddy's bass-playing is prominently featured in the drum & bass opening track of the Natin99 album, \\"Sinturong Pangkaligtasan\\". In Aloha Milkyway (the band's first international release), the songs were heavy with his bass work. Post-Eraserheads (2003‚Äìpresent) A few years after the dissolution of the Eraserheads, Buddy Zabala continues to be a prolific musician. He plays bass for The Dawn and, of course, the renamed Eheads, Cambio. Intervening bands in which he was played were the Sun Valley Crew (together with fellow Eraserhead, Raimund Marasigan) and Twisted Halo (with Vin Dancel, Jason Caballa, Joey Odulio, and Mon Lopez.). For his bass work for Cambio (Derby Light) and Twisted Halo (In Loving Memory of the Fearless Exploits of the Bolo Brigade), Zabala was awarded by the NU Rock Awards as 2004 \\"Bassist of the Year\\". Aside from playing with his bands and doing session work, he focuses his energy in helping younger generation of Pinoy rock bands by way of producing their albums. Some of these are Boldstar's \\"You Must Have Been a Beautiful Something/What Are You, Really?\\", Itchyworms' \\"Little Monsters Under your Bed\\" (with Romel Sanchez), 6 Cycle Mind's \\"Panorama\\", Moonstar 88's \\"Todo Combo\\", and Imago's \\"Blush\\". He also works as co-producer with his Eraserheads and Cambio colleague, Raimund Marasigan; such as on Itchyworms' \\"Noon Time Show,\\" Twisted Halo's \\"Twisted Halo EP\\", Fatal Posporos' \\"Paper View,\\" Sugarfree's \\"Dramachine,\\" Cambio's \\"Derby Light,\\" and Imago's \\"Take 2.\\" He was also involved for Marasigan's recent \\"Five on the Floor\\" album for Sandwich's. Zabala had also scored a number of movies, TV commercials, documentary shorts and stage plays. In late 2015, Zabala replaced Hilera's bassist, Ivan Garcia who left the band due to personal reasons. A year later, Zabala left The Dawn due to unknown reasons and was replaced by the returning Carlos Balcells. Started July 2017, working with Raymund Marasigan, currently working as producers for Coke Studio Philippines.

The White House Military Office is headed by the White House Military Office Director. History Military representation aiding Presidents predates the construction of the White House and originated with General George Washington's Aide-de-Camp, whose role as Personal Aide to the President has continued and is currently filled by the military aides to the President. These roles carry a wide variety of responsibilities, from critical military command and control missions to ceremonial duties at presidential events. The White House Garage was created by an act of Congress in 1909. Over the years it was transformed into a military organization and became a regular unit in 1963 by the name of the U.S. Army Transportation Agency (White House). It was later renamed the White House Transportation Agency. Camp David was established in 1942 to provide the President a safe and relaxing residence away from the White House. That same year, the White House Communications Agency was formed to assure that the President always had access to safe, secure, and reliable means of communication. Two years later, President Franklin D. Roosevelt called for the creation of the Presidential Pilot's Office (renamed the Presidential Airlift Group in 2001) to provide air transportation to the President and his staff. The White House Medical Unit was established in the West Wing in 1945. The White House Mess, also contained in the West Wing, was established in 1951 and has been run by the Navy ever since. Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) was created in 1957 when President Dwight D. Eisenhower was vacationing in Newport, Rhode Island, and had to return to the White House on short notice. He flew the first portion of the trip aboard HMX-1. On May 8, 2009, Louis Caldera, the Director of the White House Military Office, resigned amid controversy over the Air Force One photo op incident.http://www.timescolonist.com/news/White+House+official+quits+over+Force+flight/1578111/story.html His successor was announced on October 16, 2009, as George D.

He ensures that White House requirements are clearly communicated to the WHMO Directorates and meet the highest standards of presidential quality. The WHMO's operational units are the most visible element of the WHMO's support to the President. The WHMO units include the: White House Communications Agency, Presidential Airlift Group, White House Medical Unit, Camp David, Marine Helicopter Squadron One, Presidential Food Service, White House Transportation Agency, White House Social Aides, and Military Aides to the President. The Social Aides, of whom there are 40-45 at a time, are uniformed officers of the rank of 1st Lieutenant / Lieutenant, junior grade to Major / Lieutenant Commander, and have a purely social role, taking care of visitors to the White House. They are volunteers, serving perhaps two to four afternoons a month. The (permanent) Military Aides are Majors / Lieutenant Commanders and Lieutenant Colonels / Commanders, one from each of the five armed forces, and have the task of carrying the President's emergency satchel, the so-called nuclear football. The White House Military Office also includes staff dedicated to Operations, Information and Technology Management, Financial Management and Comptroller, WHMO Counsel, and Security. Together the WHMO's entities provide essential service to the President as well as help assure the continuity of the presidency.

Known for most of its length as Roscoe Rowe Boulevard, the highway runs from MD 450 in Annapolis north to Bestgate Road in Parole. MD 70 is the primary highway connecting U.S. Route 50 (US 50) and US 301 with downtown Annapolis. The highway also serves several sets of Maryland state government offices and Navy‚ÄìMarine Corps Memorial Stadium. MD 70 was constructed in the mid-1950s contemporaneously with the US 50 freeway. The highway was extended north to Bestgate Road in the early 1990s. Route description MD 70 southbound approaching US 50/US 301/MD 2 in Parole MD 70 begins at an intersection with MD 450 (College Avenue) in downtown Annapolis. This intersection is next to Government House, the residence of the Governor of Maryland, and one block north of the Maryland State House. MD 70 heads northwest for two blocks as Bladen Street, a four-lane divided boulevard that passes between state office buildings, including the offices of members of the Maryland General Assembly. At Calvert Street, the highway's name changes to Roscoe Rowe Boulevard. A two- lane ramp splits from southbound MD 70 just south of the southern end of the highway's bridge over College Creek, the point at which maintenance responsibility changes from the city of Annapolis to the state. The highway passes between several sets of government offices, including the Maryland Court of Appeals and the Maryland State Archives, leading up to its intersection with MD 435 (Taylor Avenue). MD 70 passes to the east of Navy‚ÄìMarine Corps Memorial Stadium before crossing Weems Creek and leaving the city of Annapolis. The highway meets US 50/US 301/MD 2 (John Hanson Highway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. Beyond the interchange, MD 70 curves to the west and intersects Bestgate Road and Tidewater Colony Drive; the latter street leads to the historic home Howard's Inheritance. The highway continues along Bestgate Road and becomes a four-lane road with a center left-turn lane before reaching its northern terminus at an arbitrary point west of Compton Drive and Willie Drive. Bestgate Road continues west as a county highway toward the Westfield Annapolis shopping mall in the center of Parole. History MD 70 from College Avenue to US 50 and US 301 is named for Roscoe C. Rowe, the mayor of Annapolis from 1949 until his 1952 death. Rowe was credited with organizing the city of Annapolis's financial contribution to construct the boulevard and for persuading the Maryland State Roads Commission to finance the construction of the bridge across College Creek. Construction of MD 70 began from US 50, then also under construction, to Weems Creek, including the bridge over the creek, in October 1952. Construction on the highway resumed in May 1954; the section from Weems Creek to College Avenue was completed in November 1954, five months after the US 50 freeway opened from MD 450 to MD 2 east of the Severn River. The boulevard's interchange with US 50 was originally a trumpet interchange. MD 70's southern end was originally a one-way pair; traffic leaving Annapolis followed Bladen Street from College Avenue toward College Creek and traffic entering Annapolis veered south onto Northwest Street to end at Church Circle. Bladen Street was expanded to a two-way boulevard in 1983. MD 70 was extended north to its present terminus and its junction with US 50 and US 301 was changed to a partial cloverleaf interchange in 1991. The state highway's bridges over Weems Creek and College Creek were replaced between 2004 and 2006. Junction list Auxiliary routes MD 70 has two existing auxiliary routes and one former route. All three routes were established in 2002 along county highways relocated as part of the extension of MD 70 north to Bestgate Road. *MD 70A is the designation for the stretch of North Lawrence Road north from MD 70. *MD 70B was the designation for the portion of Tidewater Colony Drive south from the intersection between Roscoe Rowe Boulevard and Bestgate Road. MD 70B was transferred to county maintenance in 2009. *MD 70C is the designation for the segment of Bestgate Road east from the intersection of MD 70 and Tidewater Colony Drive.

These peers can be humans or computers. Peer-to-peer (P2P) is a term that originated from the popular concept of the P2P distributed computer application architecture which partitions tasks or workloads between peers. This application structure was popularized by file sharing systems like Napster, the first of its kind in the late 1990s. The concept has inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction. P2P human dynamic affords a critical look at current authoritarian and centralized social structures. Peer-to-peer is also a political and social program for those who believe that in many cases, peer-to-peer modes are a preferable option.  Definition  P2P is a specific form of relational dynamic, based on the assumed equipotency https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/equipotent of its participants, organized through the free cooperation of equals in view of the performance of a common task, for the creation of a common good, with forms of decision making and autonomy that are widely distributed throughout the network. There are several fundamental aspects of social P2P processes: * peer production - the collaborative production of use-value is open to participation and use to the widest possible number (as defined by Yochai Benkler, in his essay Coase's Penguin); * peer governance - production or project is governed by the community of producers themselves, not by market allocation or corporate hierarchy; * peer property - the use-value of property is freely accessible on a universal basis; peer services and products are distributed through new modes of property, which are not exclusive, though recognize individual authorship (i.e. the GNU General Public License or the Creative Commons licenses). Peer production does not produce commodities for exchange value and does not use the price mechanism or corporate hierarchy to determine the allocation of resources. It must, therefore, be distinguished from both the capitalist market (though it can be linked and embedded in the broader market) and from production through state and corporate planning; as a mode of governance it differs from traditional linear hierarchies; and as a mode of property it differs from both traditional private property and state- based collective public property; it is rather the common property of its producers and users and the whole of humankind. Unlike private property, peer property is inclusive rather than exclusive ‚Äî its nature is to share ownership as widely, rather than as narrowly, as possible.  Characteristics  P2P processes are not structureless but are characterized by dynamic and changing structures that adapt themselves to phase changes. Its rules are not derived from external authority, as in hierarchical systems, but are generated from within. It does not deny ‚Äòauthority‚Äô, but only fixed forced hierarchy, and therefore accepts authority based on expertise, initiation of the project, etc. P2P may be the first true meritocracy. P2P eliminates most, if not all, barriers to entry. The threshold for participation is kept as low as possible. Equipotency means that there is no prior formal filtering for participation, but rather that it is the immediate practice of cooperation which determines the expertise and level of participation. Communication is not top-down and based on strictly defined reporting rules, but feedback is systemic, integrated into the protocol of the cooperative system. Techniques of 'participation capture' and other social accounting make automatic cooperation the default scheme of the project. Personal identity becomes partly generated by the contribution to the common project. P2P characteristics have been studied by Howard Rheingold et al.'s Cooperation Project. P2P is a network, not a linear or 'pyramidal' hierarchy (though it may have elements of it); it is 'distributed', though it may have elements of centralization and 'decentralization'; intelligence is not located at any center, but everywhere within the system. Assumed equipotency means that P2P systems start from the premise that ‚Äòit doesn‚Äôt know where the needed resource will be located‚Äô, it assumes that ‚Äòeverybody‚Äô can cooperate, and does not use formal rules in advance to determine its participating members. Participants are expected to self-select the module that corresponds best to their expertise. Equipotency, i.e. the capacity to cooperate, is verified in the process of cooperation itself. Validation of knowledge, acceptance of processes, are determined by the collective through the use of digital rules which are embedded in the project's basic protocol. Cooperation must be free, not forced, and not based on neutrality (i.e. the buying of cooperation in a monetary system). It exists to produce something. It enables the widest possible participation. These are a number of characteristics that we can use to describe P2P systems ‚Äòin general‚Äô, and in particular as it emerges in the human lifeworld. Whereas participants in hierarchical systems are subject to the panoptism of the select few who control the vast majority, in P2P systems, participants have access to holoptism, the ability for any participant to see the whole.  Infrastructure  The first requirement to facilitate the emergence of peer- to-peer processes is the existence of a technological infrastructure that enables distributed access to fixed capital. Individual computers that enable a universal machine capable of executing any logical task are a form of distributed fixed capital, available at low cost to many producers. The internet, as a point to point network, was specifically designed for participation by the edges (computer users) without the use of obligatory hubs. Although it is not fully in the hands of its participants, the internet is controlled through distributed governance, and outside the complete hegemony of particular private or state actors. The Internet's hierarchical elements, such as the stacked IP protocols and Domain Name System, do not deter participation. Viral communicators, or meshworks, are a logical extension of the internet. With this methodology, devices create their own networks through the use of excess capacity, bypassing the need for a pre- existing infrastructure. Wireless community networks, Open Spectrum advocacy, file-serving television, and alternative meshwork-based telecommunication infrastructures are exemplary of this trend. The second requirement is alternative information and communication systems which allow for autonomous communication between cooperating agents. The web (in particular the Writeable Web and the Web 2.0 that is in the process of being established) allows for the universal autonomous production, dissemination, and 'consumption' of written material while the associated podcasting and webcasting developments create an 'alternative information and communication infrastructure' for audio and audiovisual creation. The existence of such an infrastructure enables autonomous content production that may be distributed without the intermediary of the classic publishing and broadcasting media (though new forms of mediation may arise). The third requirement is the existence of a 'software' infrastructure for autonomous global cooperation. A growing number of collaborative tools, such as blogs and wikis, embedded in social networking software facilitate the creation of trust and social capital, making it possible to create global groups that can create use-value without the intermediary of manufacturing or distribution by for-profit enterprises. The fourth requirement is a legal infrastructure that enables the creation of use- value and protects it from private appropriation. The General Public License (which prohibits the appropriation of software code), the related Open Source Initiative, and certain versions of the Creative Commons license fulfill this role. They enable the protection of common use-value and use viral characteristics to spread. GPL and related material can only be used in projects that in turn put their adapted source code in the public domain. The fifth requirement is cultural. The diffusion of mass intellectuality, (i.e. the distribution of human intelligence) and associated changes in ways of feeling and being (ontology), ways of knowing (epistemology) and value constellations (axiology) have been instrumental in creating the type of cooperative individualism needed to sustain an ethos which can enable P2P projects.  In the economy  = Capitalism = There are two important aspects to the emergence of P2P in the economic sphere. On the one hand, as a format for peer production processes, it is emerging as a 'third mode of production' based on the cooperation of autonomous agents. Indeed, if the first mode of production was laissez-faire based capitalism, and the second mode was the model of a centrally-planned economy, then the third mode is defined neither by the motor of profit, nor by central planning: to allocate resources and make decisions, it does not use market and pricing mechanisms, or managerial commands, but instead uses social relations. Peer production is a significant part of the mainstream economy, even if it is not much advertised as such in mainstream economic literature. Despite significant differences, P2P and the capitalist market are highly interconnected. P2P is dependent on the market and the market is dependent on P2P. Peer production produces use-value through mostly immaterial production, without directly providing an income for its producers. Participants cannot live from peer production, though they derive meaning and value from it. The market and capitalism are also dependent on P2P. Capitalism has become a system relying on distributed networks, in particular on the P2P infrastructure in computing and communication. Productivity is highly reliant on cooperative teamwork, most often organized in ways that are derivative of peer production's governance. The support given by major IT companies to open-source development is a testimony to the use derived from even the new common property regimes. The general business model seems to be that businesses use the P2P infrastructure, and create a surplus value through services, which can be packaged for exchange value. For-profit enterprises mostly use partial implementations of P2P. Amazon built itself around user reviews, eBay lives on a platform of worldwide distributed auctions, and Google is constituted by user-generated content. Value creation today is no longer confined to the enterprise, but beholden to the mass intellectuality of knowledge workers, who through their lifelong learning/experiencing and systemic connectivity, constantly innovate within and without the enterprise. Yet more recently, in the last decade, peer-to-peer exchanges have become even more prevalent in the so-called \\"sharing economy\\", also termed an \\"access economy\\" or a \\"peer exchange economy.\\" For instance, businesses such as Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb are all based on peer-to-peer physical exchanges. This sharing economy is projected by some analysts to encompass $335 billion by 2025. Peer-to-peer systems contribute to more specific forms of distributed capitalism. The massive use of open source software in business, enthusiastically supported by venture capital and large IT companies such as IBM, is creating a distributed software platform that will drastically undercut the monopolistic rents enjoyed by companies such as Microsoft and Oracle, while Skype and VoIP will drastically redistribute the telecom infrastructure. It also points to a new business model that is 'beyond' products, focusing instead on services associated with the nominally free FS/OS software model. Industries are gradually transforming themselves to incorporate user-generated innovation, and new intermediation may occur around user-generated media. Many knowledge workers are choosing non-corporate paths and becoming mini-entrepreneurs, relying on an increasingly sophisticated participatory infrastructure, a kind of digital corporate commons. = Market economy = Social P2P systems are different from market economy: neither market pricing nor managerial command are required for P2P processes to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources. There are further differences: * Market economy is similar to insect-like swarm intelligence. There are autonomous agents in a distributed environment, but each individual only sees his own immediate benefit. * Markets are based on 'neutral' cooperation, and not on synergistic cooperation: no reciprocity is created. * Markets operate on the production and exchange of value to generate profit, not production for use. * Whereas P2P aims at full participation, markets only fulfill the needs of those with purchasing power. Markets do not function well for common needs that do not involve direct payment (national defense, general policing, education and public health). In addition, they fail to take into account negative externalities (the environment, social costs, future generations). = P2P economic system = In The Political Economy of Peer Production Bauwens regards P2P phenomena as an emerging alternative to capitalist society. P2P economy may be seen as extending or already existing outside the sphere of free/open source software production and other non-rival immaterial goods. Peer production effectively enables the free cooperation of producers, who have access to their own means of production, and the resulting use-value of the projects supersedes for-profit alternatives. Historically, though forces of higher productivity may be temporarily embedded in the old productive system, they ultimately lead to deep upheavals and reconstitutions of the political economy. The emergence of capitalist modes within the feudal system is a case in point. This is particularly significant because leading sectors of the for-profit economy are deliberately slowing down productive growth (through patents and monopolization) and trying to outlaw P2P production and sharing practices.  In politics  = Governance = Governments of countries are composed of a specialized and privileged body of individuals, who monopolize political decision-making. Their function is to enforce existing laws, legislate new ones, and arbitrate conflicts via their monopoly on violence. Legislation can be open to the general citizenry through open source governance, allowing policy development to benefit from the collected wisdom of the people as a whole. Michel Bauwens has stated, that society is not a peer group with an a priori consensus, but rather a decentralized structure of competing groups and representative democracy cannot be replaced entirely by peer governance. Peer projects which evolve beyond a certain scale and start facing issues of decisions about scarce resources, will probably adopt some representational mechanisms. Representative and bureaucratic decision-making can and will in some places be replaced by global governance networks which may be self-governed to a large extent, but in any case, it will and should incorporate more and more Multistakeholder Models (i.e. collaborative e-democracy), which strives to include all groups that could be affected. This group-based partnership model is different, but related in spirit, to the individual-based peer governance, because they share an ethos of participation. = Open source movements = Many new movements are taking on P2P organizational formats, such as the alter-globalization movement and the \\"Occupy\\" movement (i.e. Occupy Wall Street). The movements see itself as a network of networks that combines players from a wide variety of fields and opinion, who, despite the fact that they do not see eye to eye in all things, manage to unite around a common platform of action around certain key events. They are able to mobilize vast numbers of people from every continent, without having at their disposal any of the traditional news media, such as television, radio or newspapers. Rather, they rely almost exclusively on the P2P technologies described above. Thus, Internet media are used for communication and learning on a continuous basis, prior to the mobilizations, and also during the mobilizations. Independent Internet media platforms such as Indymedia, as well as the skillful use of mobile phones, are used for real- time response management, undertaken by small groups that use buddy-list technologies, and sometimes open-source programs that have been explicitly designed for political activism such as TextMob. Many reports have appeared, including those described in Howard Rheingold's Smart Mobs, about the political significance of SMS in organizing successful protests and ‚Äòdemocratic revolutions‚Äô. The network model allows for a more fluid organization that does not fix any group in a permanent adversarial position. Various temporary coalitions are created on an ad hoc basis depending on the issues.

Known for most of its length as Coastal Highway, the state highway runs from the southern terminus of its companion route, unsigned Maryland Route 378, in downtown Ocean City north to the Delaware state line at the northern edge of the resort town, where the highway continues as Delaware Route 1 (DE 1). MD 528 and MD 378 are the primary north-south streets of Ocean City, where they provide access to countless hotels, condos, restaurants, shops, and other businesses catering to tourists. These highways experience heavy seasonal traffic and provide access to hurricane evacuation routes, which include U.S. Route 50 (US 50), MD 90, and DE 54. Both Baltimore Avenue and Philadelphia Avenue date back to the founding of Ocean City in the late 19th century. MD 378 was assigned to Baltimore Avenue in 1927 and MD 528 was assigned to Philadelphia Avenue in 1933. MD 528 was extended north of 15th Street to the Delaware state line in 1939. Both highways were rebuilt and widened in the 1950s. MD 528 was expanded to a six-lane divided highway north of the one-way pair in the late 1980s. Route description View north along MD 528 at 9th Street in southern Ocean City MD 528 and MD 378 both have their southern termini at the intersection of Baltimore Avenue and South 1st Street at the southern end of Ocean City north of the Ocean City Inlet. Baltimore Avenue continues south and then turns east as South 2nd Street toward the Hugh T. Cropper Inlet Parking Lot that serves attractions on the Ocean City Boardwalk along the Atlantic Ocean, including Trimper's Rides and the Ocean City Life- Saving Station. From the southern terminus, MD 528 heads west on South 1st Street and then north as Philadelphia Avenue, while MD 378 heads north as Baltimore Avenue. The two state highways form a one-way pair, with MD 378 carrying three lanes of northbound traffic and MD 528 carrying three lanes of southbound traffic. Both streets intersect South Division Street, which was the site of the railroad terminus in Ocean City and is currently the site of Sunset Park and the South Division Street Transit Center, and Worcester Street, which was the site of the first automobile bridge to the resort in 1916. MD 528 and MD 378 head north through the downtown area of Ocean City, where they meet the eastern terminus of US 50 at North Division Street. North Division Street between MD 528 and MD 378 is one-way eastbound, so traffic coming from the south uses North 1st Street, which is one-way westbound and designated MD 378A, to access US 50 west. MD 528 and MD 378 continue north to 9th Street, which is one-way westbound and designated MD 378B. MD 528 becomes two-way at 9th Street. MD 378 continues north as a two-lane street northbound to 15th Street, where the state highway turns west to reach its northern terminus at MD 528. Baltimore Avenue continues north of 15th Street as a two- way municipal street to its northern end at 33rd Street. alt=A wide, busy, divided highway is flanked by hotels, restaurants, and other businesses serving beach visitors. MD 528 continues north from 9th Street as a divided highway with two lanes northbound and three lanes southbound. The state highway gains a third lane northbound at MD 378 (15th Street). At 17th Street, MD 528 assumes its form for the remainder of its course to the Delaware state line: three lanes in each direction plus a continuous combined right turn, bus, and bicycle lane in both directions. The road heads into the Midtown section of Ocean City, which is home to numerous restaurants and nightlife, at 28th Street. After passing the Jolly Roger Amusement Park at 30th Street, MD 528 meets 33rd Street, which is one-way westbound coming from the northern end of Baltimore Avenue. North of 33rd Street, MD 528 becomes Coastal Highway, the only through highway on the barrier island that is lined with numerous hotels and businesses. The state highway passes the Roland E. Powell Convention Center at 40th Street and intersects the eastern terminus of MD 90 (Ocean City Expressway) at 62nd Street. MD 528 continues through commercial areas and heads into North Ocean City at 91st Street, where it passes numerous condos along with the Gold Coast Mall at 112th Street. Farther north, the route runs past more businesses and hotels, heading east of the 144th Street Transit Center before it reaches the Delaware state line at 146th Street, two blocks east of the Fenwick Island Light. Coastal Highway continues into Fenwick Island as DE 1, which meets the eastern terminus of DE 54 one block north of the state line. Throughout Ocean City, MD 528 serves as the divider between the Bayside area to the west and the Oceanside area to the east. As the main north-south road in Ocean City, MD 528 experiences heavy traffic in the summer months as the resort town sees a large number of visitors and seasonal residents. The route also provides access to hurricane evacuation routes leading out of Ocean City, including US 50, MD 90, and DE 54. MD 528 is a part of the main National Highway System from US 50 to the Delaware state line. History MD 528 southbound past MD 90 in the middle part of Ocean City Baltimore Avenue and Philadelphia Avenue date back to the founding of Ocean City in 1875. Both avenues originally extended from South Division Street to North Division Street. The streets were later extended north as far as 15th Street. Baltimore Avenue served as the main thoroughfare of Ocean City until Philadelphia Avenue and Coastal Highway assumed predominance in the 1950s. MD 378 was assigned to Baltimore Avenue, which was paved from US 213 (Worcester Street) to 15th Street by 1927. MD 528 was assigned to Philadelphia Avenue when that street was rebuilt between US 213 and 15th Street in 1933. MD 528 was extended north to the Delaware state line when Coastal Highway was completed in 1939. In the 1940s, traffic in Ocean City increased so much there was a movement to make Baltimore and Philadelphia Avenues one-way in the downtown area, a change that was implemented by 1948. Traffic volume in Ocean City increased even more following the completion of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in 1952, leading to expansion of the city's north-south arterials. MD 378 was widened along its entire length in 1951 and 1952. MD 528 was widened to four lanes along its entire length in 1953 and 1954. Both state highways were extended to their present southern termini at that time. The first portion of MD 528 to be expanded to a divided highway was around the intersection with MD 90; the highway between 60th and 63rd Streets was reconstructed by 1978. Two sections of six-lane divided highway were completed around 1989: from 25th Street to 65th Street, and from 85th Street to 122nd Street. By 1991, MD 528 was divided highway from 25th Street to the Delaware state line. The segment of Philadelphia Avenue from 9th Street to 25th Street was changed from a five- to six-lane highway with a center turn lane to a divided highway in 2001. A pedestrian safety project aimed to reduce jaywalking will install a dune-style fence in the median of MD 528, with the first phase to take place between 41st Street/Convention Center Drive and MD 90. Construction on the first phase was expected to begin in January 2017 and be finished by Memorial Day of that year, but was delayed after the only bid came in over the $4.5 million budget. Construction on the first phase began on November 7, 2017 and was completed in May 2018. The second phase will build the fence between 26th Street and 41st Street/Convention Center Drive while the third phase will construct the fence between 9th Street and 26th Street. In the future, the fence will be built between MD 90 and the Delaware border. Junction list Related routes View north along MD 378 at 7th Street in southern Ocean City Maryland Route 378 is a unsigned highway in Ocean City that follows portions of Baltimore Avenue and 15th Street from the southern terminus of MD 528 at the southern end of Ocean City north to MD 528 north of the downtown area of Ocean City. Because MD 378 essentially functions as the northbound direction of MD 528 in downtown Ocean City, the state highway is covered in more detail in the main sections of this article. MD 378 has two auxiliary routes: *MD 378A is the designation for 1st Street, a connector between MD 378 and MD 528 just north of US 50 in Ocean City. The state highway is one-way westbound, helping provide access to US 50 from traffic at the southern end of the barrier island. *MD 378B is the designation for 9th Street, a connector between MD 378 and MD 528 on the northern edge of downtown Ocean City. MD 378B, which is one- way westbound, serves as the main conduit for MD 378 traffic headed for the central and northern parts of Ocean City along MD 528, connecting with MD 528 at the point the highway becomes two-way. For that reason, MD 378B is part of the National Highway System. MD 378 from US 50 to MD 378B and all of MD 378B are part of the main National Highway System.

The largest of the non- communist resistance groups, its military wing, the National Groups of Greek Guerrillas (ŒïŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ≠œÇ ŒüŒºŒ¨Œ¥ŒµœÇ ŒïŒªŒªŒÆŒΩœâŒΩ ŒëŒΩœÑŒ±œÅœÑœéŒΩ, Ethnik√©s Om√°des Ell√≠non Antart√≥n (ŒïŒüŒïŒë)) concentrated its military activities in Epirus. From 1943 onwards, EDES came into confrontation with the communist-led National Liberation Front, beginning a series of civil conflicts that would lead to the Greek Civil War.  Foundation and ideology  The National Republican Greek League was founded on 9 September 1941 by a former army officer, Colonel Napoleon Zervas, a centrist who had been expelled from the army after the failed pro-Venizelist coup d'√©tat of 1935, and two of his friends, Leonidas Spais and Ilias Stamatopoulos.Fleischer (1990), p. 150 Like many other resistance movements founded during that time, the political orientation of the National Republican Greek League was Republican, with a strong dislike towards the exiled king, George II, and featured some vague leftist-socialist tendencies. In the aftermath of the four-year right-wing Metaxas dictatorship, which was strongly supported by the king, the monarchy was almost universally rejected, while social ideals for \\"social fairness\\" became the vogue among the various resistance groups. The founding charter of EDES explicitly demanded the \\"establishment in Greece of a Republican regime, of Socialist form\\", the \\"revelation [...] of the treason of former King George II and the gang of the so-called 4th of August Dictatorship\\", calling for a thorough cleansing of the state and Greek social and public life from anyone \\"who has not proven a National Republican [and] socialist conscience through actions\\". The charter acknowledged the prominent exiled Venizelist general Nikolaos Plastiras as its nominal political head, but due to his exile in France they failed to take his consent beforehand. For the time being, no reference to armed opposition against the occupying forces was made in the text. On the same day, Komninos Pyromaglou, a friend and assistant of Plastiras, left Nice, where Plastiras resided, for Greece. He was authorize by the general to form, on his behalf, a republican organization with socialist content\\", and prepare to turn both \\"against the Occupier\\" and against a return of the monarchy.Fleischer (1990), p. 154 After his arrival in Athens on 23 September, Pyromaglou came into contact with Republican circles, and after contacting Zervas took EDES' command. In October, a five-member Executive Committee was founded, with Pyromaglou as Plastiras' representative as General Secretary and Zervas as a simple member.Fleischer (1990), pp. 154‚Äì155 As the organization grew, it succeeded in establishing links with the British Headquarters in Cairo, with a view to receiving funds, weapons and guidance. Under British pressure which at the time strongly supported the Greek monarchy, Zervas was forced to send a statement of loyalty to King George II in March 1942.Fleischer (1990), p. 388 This marked a silent breach with the vitriolic anti-monarchist attacks of the past months, and marked EDES's slow slide towards a more pro-monarchist stance.  Beginnings of armed resistance ‚Äì The Gorgopotamos operation  Like most similar groups, EDES was initially limited to Athens. Having the support of many prominent Venizelist and Republican military figures, EDES came into contact with EAM and tried to establish some form of cooperation. The negotiations failed over the demands of the Communists for a merger of EDES with EAM and their distrust of Zervas' pro-British attitudes.Fleischer (1990), p. 238 On 23 July 1942, after intense British pressure and more than a month after the official appearance of the military wing of EAM, the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS), Zervas, accompanied by Pyromaglou and a handful of companions, set out for the Valtos Mountains in Aetolia-Acarnania, an area with long traditions of guerrilla warfare stretching back to the Ottoman period.Fleischer (1990), p. 241 From then and until the end of the Occupation, Epirus would be the primary area of operations of the EDES andartes. Supported by British parachute drops, EDES quickly gathered some 100 fighters. The first major operation of EDES was \\"Operation Harling\\", the destruction of the Gorgopotamos viaduct by a joint force of British SOE commandos, and EDES and ELAS forces. While the successful operation, one of the greatest sabotage acts in occupied Europe, greatly boosted the prestige of the nascent Resistance, it also caused a significant rift between EDES and ELAS: the British loudly proclaimed and lauded Zervas' role in the operation, while ignoring the contribution ‚Äì numerically far greater ‚Äì of the leftist ELAS forces.Fleischer (1990), p. 247 While the rift was healed by British mediation, it presaged the problems that would appear in the future.

Accusations of collaboration by ELAS The left wing Greek People's Liberation Army on various occasions accused its rival organizations, and particularly EDES, for collaboration with the occupation forces.Charles R. Shrader. The withered vine: logistics and the communist insurgency in Greece, 1945‚Äì1949. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999 . p. 34.Ian Dear,Michael Richard Daniell Foot. The Oxford companion to World War II. Oxford University Press, 2001 , p. 403David H. Close. The origins of the Greek civil war . Longman, 1995, , p. 106 However, this accusation was as yet unfounded, at least concerning EDES' guerilla branch.John O. Iatrides. Greece in the 1940s: a nation in crisis Vol. 2. University Press of New England, 1981, , p. 58 Moreover, during the armed conflicts between ELAS and EDES in Athens, a propaganda war was launched with ELAS accusing EDES of collaboration, mainly due to gaining plausibility from the explicit exemption of EDES from German propaganda attacks. EDES was accusing ELAS of having a soviet perspective and for committing crimes against non-communists. On the other hand, Stylianos Gonatas, initially a political leader of EDES in Athens, won the peculiar enmity of the organization because he supported the collaborationist Security Battalions and encouraged young officers to join their ranks, which led to hostility of the EAM groups towards him. The 12th Army of Nazi Germany attempted for a short time to coopt the EDES forces, and to use them against the ELAS, but this attempt failed and in July 1944 the EDES launched new attacks.  The civil war within the Resistance  These internal conflicts caused rivalry between resistance groups and eventually escalated into civil war. In October 1943, ELAS launched an attack on EDES. These attacks triggered a civil war that would last until February 1944. After that, a fragile truce was established, which lasted until December, two months after the Liberation. Then, while the ELAS of Athens attempted to overthrow the government, other units stormed the EDES positions in Epirus. The latter was defeated and the remaining forces were evacuated to Corfu. After the defeat of the ELAS in Athens (January 1945), EDES forces returned to Epirus, where part of them got involved to the expulsion of the Cham Albanians.

The existence of a Christian community there already in the time of Saint Paul is mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles. Seated at Tyre, which was the capital of the Roman province of Phoenicia Prima, the bishopric was a metropolitan see. Its position was briefly challenged by the see of Berytus in the mid-5th century; but after 480/1 the metropolitan of Tyre established himself as the first (protothronos) of all the metropolitans subject to the Patriarch of Antioch. In the summer of 2017 a Greek inscription, five-metres long, naming Irenaeus as bishop of Tyre, was found west of the Sea of Galilee, in an excavation co-directed by historian Jacob Ashkenazi and archaeologist Mordechai Aviam. Since the inscription provides the date of the church‚Äôs completion as 445, it gives credence to a date as early as 444 CE for his ordination. History Communion with the see of Rome was broken following the East‚ÄìWest Schism. When the Crusaders conquered Tyre, the Eastern Orthodox archbishop withdrew to Constantinople and a Latin named Eudes was appointed archbishop, but he died in 1124, the same year in which the Crusaders succeeded in taking the city. The most notable of the Latin archbishops of Tyre of this time was the historian William of Tyre, who served from 1175 to 1185. Tyre then belonged to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, not the more northerly Principality of Antioch. On the basis of the Pentarchy system, the Latin Patriarch of Antioch claimed the right to appoint the archbishop, which was exercised by the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. Pope Innocent II adjudicated the dispute in favour of Jerusalem on the basis of a decree of Pope Paschal II granting King Baldwin the right to make all sees conquered from the Muslims subject to Jerusalem. It was the practice to choose as Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem the archbishop of Tyre or of Caesarea in Palaestina. In 1187, after Saladin's invasion, Tyre was the only city remaining in Crusader hands and was at one point considered as the new capital of the kingdom. It lost that appellation to Acre, but it remained the site of the coronation of the king, and the archbishop was given the responsibility of officiating at the coronation. Starting with Sultan Baibars in 1254, the Islamic chieftains declared jihad on the Crusaders and slowly started exterminating the remaining Christian communities on the coastlands. The last archbishops, John and Bonacourt, devoted their rule to forestalling the Mamluk conquest, attempting to obtain the freedom of enslaved Christians, caring for refugees, and preparing for the coming assault. After a long siege, the city was captured by the Mamluks in 1291. The city was mostly evacuated by the time the Mamluks arrived, but the remaining population, including the archbishop, were killed or enslaved. The churches were torn down, and the archdiocese became titular; only in the 18th and 19th centuries was a new archbishop appointed to protect the newly restored pilgrim routes. Due to the ongoing conflict and dislocations in modern Lebanon and the decline of influence of Christianity there, the see has remained vacant again since 1984.

Forest, host of Musical Starstreams refers to space music as a separate genre along with Ambient music, and others including dub, downtempo, trip hop, and acid jazz in the list of genres he calls \\"exotic electronica\\".\\"Ambient, spacemusic, dub, downtempo, trip hop, acid jazz...artists from all these categories.\\" Waveform...Starstreams and beyond: Ambient Visions Talks with....Forest, listing styles of music played on Musical Starstreams, from interview in Ambient Visions Magazine, 2003 Similarly, WXPN Radio's Star's End, programming ambient music since 1976, on its website lists space music as a separate genre, along with Ambient, new- age, and others.

In contrast to this, according to author and National Endowment for the Arts researcher Judith H. Balfe, Billboard editor Jerry Wood describes space music as one of several \\"genres within the genre\\" of new-age music.  Variety  As described by Stephen Hill, the predominant defining element of spacemusic is its contemplative nature. Within that overview, Hill's definition of space music includes a wide variety of styles, instrumentation and influences ‚Äì both acoustic or electronic. Many space music recording artists specialize in electronic forms, evolving out of the traditional Kosmische musik of the Berlin School (also known as Krautrock). Author and classical music critic David Hurwitz describes Joseph Haydn's choral and chamber orchestra piece, The Creation, composed in 1798, as space music, both in the sense of the sound of the music, (\\"a genuine piece of 'space music' featuring softly pulsating high violins and winds above low cellos and basses, with nothing at all in the middle ... The space music gradually drifts towards a return to the movement's opening gesture ... \\"); and in the manner of its composition, relating that Haydn conceived The Creation after discussing music and astronomy with William Herschel, oboist and astronomer (discoverer of the planet Uranus).  Historical usage of the term  In 1928, the German composer Robert Beyer published a paper about \\"Raummusik\\" (spatial music),Robert Beyer, \\"Das Problem der ‚Äòkommenden Musik,'\\" Die Musik 20, no. 12 (1928): 861‚Äì66. See also p. 36 in Lowell Cross, \\"Electronic Music, 1948‚Äì1953\\", Perspectives of New Music (Autumn-Winter 1968): 32‚Äì65, and p. 7 of David Dunn, \\"A History of Electronic Music Pioneers \\", from the catalog of the exhibition Eigenwelt der Apparatewelt: Pioneers of Electronic Art, presented as part of Ars Electronica 1992, in Linz, Austria. which is an entirely different sense of the term. Karlheinz Stockhausen, who became a colleague of Beyer in Cologne in 1953, used the expression \\"space music\\" in this sense when describing his early development as a composer: \\"The first revolution occurred from 1952/53 as musique concr√®te, electronic tape music, and space music, entailing composition with transformers, generators, modulators, magnetophones, etc., the integration of all concrete and abstract (synthetic) possibilities within sound (also all noises) and the controlled projection of sound in space.\\" In the sense meant here, he stated in 1967, \\"Several have commented that my electronic music sounds 'like on a different star,' or 'like in outer space.' Many have said that when hearing this music, they have sensations as if flying at an infinitely high speed, and then again, as if immobile in an immense space.\\"\\"In 1967, just following the world premier of Hymnen, Stockhausen said this about the electronic music experience: '... Many listeners have projected that strange new music which they experienced‚Äîespecially in the realm of electronic music‚Äîinto extraterrestrial space. Even though they are not familiar with it through human experience, they identify it with the fantastic dream world. Several have commented that my electronic music sounds \\"like on a different star,\\" or \\"like in outer space.\\" Many have said that when hearing this music, they have sensations as if flying at an infinitely high speed, and then again, as if immobile in an immense space. Thus, extreme words are employed to describe such experience, which are not \\"objectively\\" communicable in the sense of an object description, but rather which exist in the subjective fantasy and which are projected into the extraterrestrial space.' \\" Page 145, Electronic and Experimental Music: Pioneers in Technology and Composition, Thomas B. Holmes, Routledge Music/Songbooks, 2002, A number of Stockhausen's later compositions (not all of them electronic music) take outer space as their theme: Sternklang (Star Sound, 1971), Ylem (1972), Sirius (1975‚Äì77), several components of the opera-cycle Licht (Weltraum (Outer Space, 1991‚Äì92/1994), Michaelion (1997), Komet (Comet, 1994/1999), Lichter‚ÄîWasser (Lights‚ÄîWaters, 1998‚Äì99)), and the so-called \\"Urantia\\" subcycle of Klang (Sound, 2006‚Äì2007), extending from its thirteenth \\"hour\\", Cosmic Pulses to its twenty-first \\"hour\\" Paradies. Music historian Joseph Lanza described the emerging light music style during the early 1950s as a precursor to modern space music. He wrote that orchestra conductor Mantovani used new studio technologies to \\"create sound tapestries with innumerable strings\\" and in particular, \\"the sustained hum of Mantovani's reverberated violins produced a sonic vaporizor foreshadowing the synthesizer harmonics of space music.\\" Jazz artist Sun Ra used the term to describe his music in 1956, when he stated that the music allowed him to translate his experience of the void of space into a language people could enjoy and understand.According to Author Norman Mailer in 1956, quoted on page 154: \\"a friend took me to hear a jazz musician named Sun Ra who played 'space music.' \\" and according to Sun Ra himself, also in 1956, quoted on page 384: \\"When I say space music, I'm dealing with the void, because that is of space too... So I leave the word space open, like space is supposed to be.\\" and on page 247, in an interview, Sun Ra states: \\"sometimes when I'm playing for a band, playing space music... I'm using ordinary instruments, but actually I'm using them in a manner... transforming certain ideas over into a language which the world can understand.\\" ‚Äì Space is the Place By John F. Szwed, 1998, Da Capo Press Physicist Werner Meyer-Eppler had been inspired by Homer Dudley's 1948 invention of the Vocoder and began in 1951 to work with a device known as a Melochord, in conjunction with magnetic tape recorders, leading to a decade of working at the Studio for Electronic Music (WDR) specializing in \\"elektronische Musik\\" using magnetic tape recorders, sine wave generators and serial composition techniques.A History of Electronic Music Pioneers by David Dunn, in the catalog of the exhibition: Eigenwelt der Apparatewelt: Pioneers of Electronic Art, presented as part of Ars Electronica 1992, in Linz, Austria. In 1969, Miles Davis was introduced to the music of Stockhausen by young arranger and cellist, and later Grammy award winner, Paul Buckmaster, leading to a period of new creative exploration for Davis. Biographer J.K.Chambers wrote that \\"The effect of Davis's study of Stockhausen could not be repressed for long. ... Davis's own 'space music,' shows Stockhausen's influence compositionally.\\" His recordings and performances during this period were described as \\"space music\\" by fans, by music critic Leonard Feather, and by Buckmaster who stated: \\"a lot of mood changes ‚Äì heavy, dark, intense ‚Äì definitely space music.\\" In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Grateful Dead developed a new form of improvisational space music in their extended formless jam sessions during live concerts (which their fans referred to as \\"Space\\" though the band did not formally assign that title), and their experimental space music albums such as Aoxomoxoa, and later in the 1980s, Infrared Roses, and Grayfolded.\\"purveyors of freely improvised space music,\\" ‚Äì Blender Magazine, May 2003 \\"\\"Dark Star,\\" both in its title and in its structure (designed to incorporate improvisational exploration), is the perfect example of the kind of \\"space music\\" that the Dead are famous for.

Lagin used in real-time stage and studio performance of minicomputers driving real-time digital to analog converters, prior to the commercial availability of digital synthesizers in the early 1980s. The Czech- American composer V√°clav Nelh√Ωbel, released in 1974 a record named Outer Space: Music by Vaclav Nelybel. From the liner notes: \\"Ingenious use of echo, artificial reverberation and electronic alterations gives the music in this category a weird, spooky futuristic, ‚Äòout of this world‚Äô quality, well-suited to super-natural happenings of any kind. Piano, drums and electronic instruments are used to achieve the strange atmosphere and spatial sounds.\\" Vaclav Nelhybel crafts a supernatural world, describing nebulae, meteors, star clusters and craters on Mars with sounds natural and manipulated to tell the story of cosmic space. Beginning in the early 1970s, the term \\"space music\\" was applied to some of the output of such artists as Vangelis, Jean-Michel Jarre, Klaus Schulze and Tangerine Dream, due to the transcendent cosmic feelings of space evoked by the sound of the music and enhanced by the use of the emerging new instrument, the synthesizer,\\"a quartet of albums, Phaedra, Rubycon, Ricochet and Stratosfear, established the Dream's modus operandi with throbbing, cosmic rubber band rhythms thrumming like galactic space basses through floating mellotron pads, ghost flutes and electronic effects whirling by at hyperspeed. This was the soundtrack for countless planetarium shows... the first electronic music to shed the synthesizers reputation as cold and unfeeling... beyond emotion, into the sensual and the transcendent.

These space music explorations diverged from traditional pop-song formats into longer less structured compositions. Following their early influence on the development of space music, Tangerine Dream later produced increasingly rock- influenced works that are not generally described as space music.\\"The Dream's sound started getting a lot more rock 'n' roll in the 1980s, especially once the dreaded Private Music years set in. They'd record good music after that, but it never had the impact, cultural resonance or lasting import of their 1970s output.\\" Time Warped in Space by Echoes Radio producer and host, John Diliberto . In 1971‚Äì72, Sun Ra brought his \\"space music\\" philosophy to UC Berkeley where he taught as artist-in-residence for the school year, creating notoriety among the students by devoting the second half-hour of each class to solo or band performances. In 1972, San Francisco public TV station KQED producer John Coney, producer Jim Newman, and screenwriter Joshua Smith worked with Sun Ra to produce a 30-minute documentary film, expanded into a feature film released in 1974, entitled Space is the Place, featuring Sun Ra's Arkestra and filmed in Golden Gate Park.official website for \\"Space is the Place\\", documentary film about Sun Ra's Arkestra, filmed in 1972 In 1973, KPFA Berkeley, California radio producers Anna Turner and Stephen Hill used the phrase in the title of their local public radio show Music from the Hearts of Space.

It was founded in autumn 1942 by Colonel Dimitrios Psarros and politician Georgios Kartalis. History Dimitrios Psarros, military leader of EKKA. Alongside Psarros and Kartalis, founding members included fellow officers Dimitrios Karachristos, Dimitrios Georgantas and others. The organization's aims were to fight the Germans as long as the occupation lasted and, after Liberation, work for a republican regime and social change. EKKA's armed wing was the 5/42 Evzone Regiment, founded in early 1943 and named after Psarros' old army unit. It numbered at its peak ca. 1,000 men, and was active mainly in Central Greece, in the area of Phocis. The organization however was from the outset confronted with the might of the communist-led Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS), which claimed the overall leadership of the Resistance movement and regarded EKKA as reactionary and an anglophile organization. ELAS forces attacked the 5/42 Evzones Regiment on 14 May and 23 June 1943 forcing its dissolution, but bowing to pressure from the British Military Mission, they agreed to allow it to reform within the unifying framework of the so-called \\"National Bands Agreement\\" of July 1943. On 29 February 1944, near the bridge of Plaka, the was signed among the EKKA, EAM and EDES. Dissolution by ELAS Nevertheless, the rivalry between ELAS and the republican EDES and EKKA groups continued, and on 14 April 1944, the EKKA forces were attacked by ELAS. The 5/42 Evzones Regiment held out for three days, but was then forced to retreat. A number of men managed to escape and cross the Corinthian Gulf to the Peloponnese. The majority however remained behind with Col. Psarros, were taken prisoner and later executed. It remains disputed if Psarros was killed during the battle or in captivity. The event caused a major shock in the Greek political scene since Psarros was a well-known republican, patriot and anti- royalist. The apparent determination of EAM-ELAS to monopolize the resistance movement caused concerns about its post-war intentions, leading to a more decisive opposition from the part of the other resistance groups and the pre- war political establishment. The event is considered a precursor of the Greek Civil War that broke out a year later (see Dekemvriana). Following the disbandment of the 5/42 Evzones Regiment, EKKA ceased to exist as a military and political factor, although Kartalis himself still participated as its representative, alongside the leaders of the other major Resistance and political groups, in the Lebanon Conference shortly after.

Founded in 2005, the ministry became part of the Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation in 2011. It intermittently became a separate ministry in again from 2013 until 2018, when it became part of the Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. History The research and innovation agenda in Ontario was previously the responsibility of the Science and Technology Division of the Ontario Ministry of Enterprise, Opportunity and Innovation (MEOI). During the Conservative governments of Harris and Eves, the province organized itself to facilitate partnerships between the public sector and private sector. One such arrangement was a sole-source management agreement between the MEOI Science and Technology Division and the Innovation Institute of Ontario (IIO). The IIO is essentially a private corporation that was contracted to administer the $1.25 billion Ontario Research and Development Challenge Fund. The Science and Technology Division of MEOI was the subject of a provincial audit in 2003. The Provincial Auditor was particularly critical and in the report said: \\"A major concern was that the Ministry had committed to spending $4.3 billion without an overall strategic plan to set parameters and consistent policies for existing programs or to guide the development of new programs to meet the objectives of promoting innovation, economic growth, and job creation.\\" At that time the division had 50 staff, had spent $1.3 billion, and had committed a further $4.8 billion primarily on research grants to universities, colleges, and research hospitals. Funding Research funding is also a significant source of funding for higher education. The creation of this new ministry is closely aligned with the 2005 provincial budget, and the \\"Reaching Higher\\" initiative to provide $6.2 billion in funding for higher education in 2005-2010. Funding for research and innovation is also provided by the Canadian Government, and administered through Industry Canada. The Provincial- Federal relationship will be key to the success of the new Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation, and may present an opportunity for Premier McGuinty to further the \\"Strong Ontario\\" agenda which is attempting to close the $23 billion gap between the tax dollars collected in Ontario by the Federal Government, and the amount the Federal Government returned to the province through federal programs.

The park's large sand dunes and lakeshore beaches make it one of the most popular of Michigan‚Äôs state parks with an average of about one million visitors annually. Large sand dunes are found throughout the park. Among the park's dunes are Mt. Fuller, Pikes Peak, and Mt. Edwards, with the most significant being Tower Hill, the highest point in the park, which stands 240 feet (73 meters) above the Lake Michigan. This dune is the one that is most visible to visitors, many of whom delight in scrambling up its slopes and rushing back down again. Easy access to the dunes make it a popular location to practice the sport of sandboarding. The dunes and beach area was preserved by a local businessman, Edward K. Warren, who originally purchased the site as a favor to a friend who had encountered significant financial difficulties.Previous ownership of Tower Dune and surroundings by J.S.

Warren Dunes Modern has almost 200 campsites and is on the inland side of the dunes within walking distance to the beach.Warren Dunes Modern on Campthat Warren Dunes Semi-Modern is rustic and much smaller with only about 30 campsites. It has a variety of campsites, some with high levels of privacy and others that are fairly close together. Both campgrounds are immensely popular and normally at full capacity in July and August.Warren Dunes Semi-Modern on Campthat  Other activities  *Wildlife watching *Skygazing: Clear skies allow viewing of more stars than in most populated areas. *Clay painting: Walking about a mile up the creek which empties into the lake just south of the beach leads to large beds of light gray clay, through which the creek flows. Mixed with the creek water, clay makes body/face paint which can be worn home, but is much more commonly washed off by another swim in the lake. Clay painting has a negative effect on the park environment due to the amount of clay that is introduced to the creek water through man-made erosion and dispersion. Clay particles in the water create a turbid water environment. Turbid water can also have negative health effects if ingested; the higher the turbidity level, the higher the risk that people may develop gastrointestinal diseases. These health hazards are of particular concern given the number of small children and infants who play in the creek at the lake shore. *Creativity: This park is big and often not crowded, so a great testing ground for beach activities and equipment. For example, it was the inspiration and development site for the Beach Buggy, a self-contained mini-kitchen which could be wheeled to a family's water-side picnic site.

He was also a parliamentarian who served as the chairman of the Second Backward Classes Commission (popularly known as the Mandal Commission). B.P. Mandal came from Yadav Community. from Madhepura in Northern Bihar. The commission's report mobilised a segment of the Indian population known as \\"Other Backward Classes\\" (OBCs) and initiated a fierce debate on the policy for underrepresented and underprivileged groups in Indian politics.  Biography  B. P. Mandal came from the Hindu Yadav community in Bihar. Mandal was a Member of Parliament for Madhepura from the state of Bihar from 1967 to 1970 and from 1977 to 1979. He was the Chief Minister of Bihar, governing for 30 days in 1968, a period of intense political instability (his predecessor Satish Prasad Singh was the first Chief Minister from OBC but only for three days) =Civil rights commission= In December 1978, Prime Minister Morarji Desai appointed a five-member civil rights commission under the chairmanship of Mandal. The commission's report was completed in 1980 and recommended that a significant proportion of all government and educational places be reserved for applicants from the Other Backward Classes as these were the socially-deprived communities historically that had been treated as outcasts and denied job opportunities as well as proper education in the public institutions that were upper-caste dominant at the time. The commission's report was tabled indefinitely by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. A decade later, Prime Minister V. P. Singh implemented the recommendations of the Mandal Report and led to what is now known as the caste-reservation system in India. The Mandal commission was not well-received by a number of upper- caste communities leading to nation-wide protests and uproar especially by the students of Upper-castes who saw their educational opportunities under threat while many of the people from these communities still continue to consider the policies to be unnecessary and biased.

Masiello (born April 28, 1947) is an American politician and former basketball player who served as Mayor of Buffalo, New York from 1994 to 2005. Prior to being mayor, he served as a member of the New York State Senate. Early life and education A Buffalo native, Masiello is the oldest of seven children born to Bridget and Dan Masiello. Masiello graduated from Canisius College in 1969, where he played as a member of the Canisius Golden Griffins men's basketball team. He was then drafted by the Indiana Pacers in the 1969 NBA draft, and played on the team during the 1969‚Äì1970 season. Career In 1971, Masiello began his career politics when he was elected as a district representative to the Buffalo Common Council. He was subsequently elected to an at-large seat on the council and served as Democratic Majority leader in 1976. He also served as Chairman of the Council Finance Committee. Masiello was a member of the New York State Senate from 1981 to 1993, sitting in the 184th, 185th, 186th, 187th, 188th, 189th and 190th New York State Legislatures. Masiello's Senate district originally comprised mainly Buffalo and other parts of Erie County, New York. During the final year of his Senate service, his district encompassed part of Buffalo, as well as Grand Island, Niagara Falls and Tonawanda. In the State Senate, Masiello ascended to Minority Whip and served as Chair of the Democratic Conference. As a senator, Masiello served as the Ranking Minority Member of various committees, including the Child Care Committee and the Energy Committee. = Mayor of Buffalo = Masiello was sworn in as the 61st Mayor Buffalo on January 1, 1994. Masiello received 65% of the Democratic Primary vote and 67% of the General Election vote in 1993. He was re-elected to second term in 1997 and again to a third term in 2001 with the joint endorsement of the Democratic and Republican parties. As mayor, he focused on economic development, governmental restructuring, and education. He cut over 1,000 jobs from the city payroll by restructuring management and the police department. He successfully sought approval from the state to create a joint construction fund for the city schools, which has been used to renovate and build city schools. He unsuccessfully sought to take control of the Buffalo Board of Education and install his own appointees. This is unlike Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City who won this authority. In 1997, Masiello's office, and under the direction of Buffalo State College's Center for Applied Research in Interactive Technologies, launched CityNet, an advanced telecommunications network that links 14 educational and community sites in Buffalo.Fiber-optic network links 14 educational, community sites, Buffalo News, Buffalo, NY: Berkshire Hathaway, November 25, 1997, Brady, K., Retrieved February 6, 2014.

The plural form sancta sanctorum is also used, arguably as a synecdoche, referring to the holy relics contained in the sanctuary. The Vulgate translation of the Bible uses sancta sanctorum for the Holy of Holies.2 Chronicles 5:7, in Latin (Vulgate): \\"Et intulerunt sacerdotes arcam foederis Domini in locum suum, id est, ad oraculum templi, in Sancta sanctorum subter alas cherubim\\". In English (King James Version): \\"And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim\\". Hence the derivative usage to denote the Sancta Sanctorum chapel in the complex of the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, Rome. In Hinduism, a temple's innermost part where the cult image (Murti) of the deity is kept forms the Garbha griha, also referred to as a sanctum sanctorum. Etymology The Latin word sanctum is the neuter form of the adjective \\"holy\\", and sanctorum its genitive plural. Thus the term sanctum sanctorum literally means \\"the holy [place/thing] of the holy [places/things]\\", replicating in Latin the Hebrew construction for the superlative, with the intended meaning \\"the most holy [place/thing]\\". Use of the term in modern languages  The Latin word sanctum may be used in English, following Latin, for \\"a holy place\\", or a sanctuary, as in the novel Jane Eyre (1848) which refers to \\"the sanctum of school room\\". Romance languages tend to use the form sancta sanctorum, treating it as masculine and singular. E.g., the Spanish dictionary of the Real Academia Espa√±ola admits sanctasanct√≥rum (without the space and with an accent) as a derivative Spanish noun denoting both the Holy of Holies in the Temple in Jerusalem, any secluded and mysterious place, and something that a person holds in the highest esteem. The term is still often used by Indian writers for the garbhagriha or inner shrine chamber in Hindu temple architecture, after being introduced by British writers in the 19th century. German Catholic processions Some regional branches of the Catholic Church, e. g. Germans, are wont to refer to the Blessed Sacrament, when adored in the tabernacle or in exposition or procession (e.g. on Corpus Christi), as the Holy of Holies. By custom, It is adored with genuflection; with a double genuflection, that is a short moment of kneeling on both knees, if in exposition; in the procession this ritual may be nonrigoristically alleviated, but at least a simple genuflection is appropriate when It is elevated by the priest for blessing or immediately after transsubstantiation. Personnel in uniform ‚Äî which in Germany includes student corporations ‚Äî give the military salute when passing by or in the moment of elevation. The \\"enclosed house\\" of Hindu temple architecture The garbhagriha in Hindu temple architecture (a shrine inside a temple complex where the main deity is installed in a separate building by itself inside the complex) has also been compared to a \\"sanctum sanctorum\\" in texts on Hindu temple architecture, though the Sanskrit term actually means \\"enclosed house\\" or \\"the deep interior of the house\\". However, some Indian English authors seem to have translated the Sanskrit term literally as \\"womb house\\". Mountains of the God ‚Äî Page 49 Kuldip Singh Gulia The Architecture of Temples Most of the architectural elements are the same in all temples and each has a specific name. The sanctum sanctorum is called the garbha griha ‚Äî the womb house. The garbha griha is a square cell that is.

Terminology The phrase \\"la kajira\\" is said to mean \\"I am a slave girl.\\" in the Gorean language, the most widely spoken lingua franca in the known regions of the planet Gor (this is one of the few complete Gorean-language sentences given in the Gor novels). The word is usually seen in the feminine form \\"kajira\\" (pl. \\"kajirae\\"), as most slaves in the Gorean lifestyle are female; the masculine forms are \\"kajirus\\" and \\"kajiri\\" (with endings taken from the nominative forms of Latin first and second declension nouns, as also seen in words such as \\"alumna\\"/\\"alumnus\\", etc.). The construction \\"kajiras\\" is incorrect, but is occasionally seen in third-party writing. Model dressed as a kajira in a camisk with a simulated kef brand Training There exist various techniques in Gorean culture to teach Gorean slaves' corresponding conduct. Slave tasks may include not only sexual slavery, but also the ability to maintain a household, possess artistic skills, wear an appealing outfit and address the master in a certain manner. Marking To indicate a slave as a particular owner's property, a collar with the owner's name is placed upon the slave (male and female slaves are both collared). Gorean slave women are usually branded, which means they are marked with certain signs burned into the flesh on being enslaved. The most common is the kef brand: \\"about an inch and a half in height, and a half inch in width. A rather simple, delicate, graceful, almost floral mark, in cursive script. Appearing slender, more vertical, more like a stem with floral, cursive curled loops. A rather severe, straight line staff, with two, upturned, frondlike curls, adjacent to it, joined where they touch the staff on its right. It bears a distant, remote resemblance to the printed letter K.\\" Classifications of kajirae Kajirae have a plethora of typesTypes of Gorean Slaves of varying prestige depending on various characteristics, including the following: ;By virginity status: *Red silk girl: A kajira who is not a virgin. *White silk girl: A kajira 'not yet opened to men' (i.e., a virgin), a case which is depicted very rarely in the novelsA Girl Speaks of Slave Silks as a virgin kajira will usually be deflowered shortly after her enslavement.The Gorean Cave - Slave Silk, Its Color and Meaning ;By origin: *Gorean-born **Passion slave: A kajira who has been bred through selective breeding for particularly desired physical or psychological traits, as opposed to other native Gorean kajirae who were usually born free. *Barbarian: The term \\"barbarian\\" usually refers to those who do not speak the main common language of known Gor and/or who are unassimilated to typical Gorean city-state culture. In the context of kajirae, it can refer to those who were brought from Earth by a journey of acquisition. Since they have never had any home stone, barbarian girls are often considered natural slaves, occupying the lowest rank and considered the most sexual.Kajirae Basics ;By employment: *Pleasure slave: A kajira whose main function is providing sexual services. However, her training also includes broader skills, such as dancing and cooking.Glossary of Gorean Words **Prostitutes: Kajirae employed in prostitution by their masters. ***Coin girl: A kajira used by her master as a streetwalker. ***Camp slave: A kajira rented out for satisfying sexual needs during military campaigns. ***Bath girl: A kajira who works as a prostitute and masseuse in a bathhouse. ***Feast slave: A kajira rented out at feasts as a pleasure slave. *Paga slave or paga slut: A kajira who serves the alcoholic drink paga at a tavern. Their service usually includes sexual tasks. *Flute girl: A kajira versed in playing the flute. They are employed at feasts and may also serve sexual tasks. *Kettle girl / Kettle-and-mat girl: A kajira employed exclusively for domestic works is referred to as a kettle girl or pot girl. If the kajira's function is divided between household task and sexual service, she is known with the comparatively more prestigious moniker kettle- and-mat girl. **Tower slave: A kajira owned as a maid in a private household. **State slave: A kajira owned by a particular polity and used for the domestic needs of citizens. *Message girl: A kajira who delivers secret messages. Kajirus Kajiri (male slaves or slave boys) also exist on the planet Gor, but they are far fewer than kajirae, since Gorean men can only rarely be effectively \\"tamed\\", so that most male slaves are considered inherently slightly dangerous, and have little value other than as unskilled hard labor in work gangs which must often be kept under continual armed guard. Men conquered in war who are not left free are more often than not killed than enslaved, while women in the same situation are almost always enslaved (since kajirae are a readily-negotiable commodity, among other reasons).Wipipedia Gor Dictionary A male slave kept by a woman owner for bedroom duties is a \\"silk slave\\" (while most male slaves on Gor are used for unskilled hard labor in work gangs). When a free woman makes use of a kajirus sexually, he is often chained so that he is unable to hold her in his arms ‚Äî since allowing this would be considered to add a note of male domination to the lovemaking. Some free women carefully avoid kissing a kajirus when making sexual use of him, since they would consider it degrading to soil their lips by touching them to the body of a mere slave. Note that only a small minority of rich free women on Gor own silk slaves and (in contrast to the usual situation with free men and kajirae) it is often not very easy or convenient for a free woman to obtain the sexual use of a kajirus whom she does not personally own (in the city of Ar, the largest city of known Gor, it is strictly forbidden by law).Wipipedia Gor Dictionary The phrase \\"lo kajirus\\" is said to mean \\"I am a slave boy.\\" Silk slaves are generally despised by free men on Gor and their type of slavery is often considered to be rather unnatural. Kajiri do not usually wear locked collars; rather, they wear a band of iron.

Crimeware (as distinct from spyware and adware) is designed to perpetrate identity theft through social engineering or technical stealth in order to access a computer user's financial and retail accounts for the purpose of taking funds from those accounts or completing unauthorized transactions that enrich the cyberthief. Alternatively, crimeware may steal confidential or sensitive corporate information.

R. Jayewardene. Unlike the first unsuccessful JVP insurrection of 1971, the second insurrection was not an open revolt, but appeared to be a less intense conflict that lasted from 1987 to 1989 with the JVP resorting to subversion, assassinations, raids and attacks on military and civilian targets. Background = 1971 JVP insurgency = Formed in the 1960s by radical Marxist Rohana Wijeweera, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) launched an open revolt against the government under Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike in April 1971. Caught off guard the government was able to subdue the insurgency in a matter of weeks. The insurgency lead to the death of 4-5000 (unofficial) people and over 20,000 suspected rebels, mostly youth, were arrested in the amnesty period that followed. The arrested youth were released after rehabilitation. Rohana Wijeweera and the other major leaders of the insurgency were sentenced to prison terms and the JVP banned. However all of them were released in 1977 by J. R. Jayewardene after the UNP formed a government after they won the general election under a general amnesty issued for those prosecuted under the infamous Criminal Justice Commission. = Tamil insurgency = During the early 1980s, as the Tamil insurgency to the north became more intense, there was a marked shift in the ideology and goals of the JVP. Initially Marxist in orientation, and claiming to represent the oppressed of both the Tamil and Sinhalese communities, the group emerged increasingly as a Sinhalese nationalist organization opposing any compromise with the Tamil insurgency. Rohana Wijeweera came in the third place at in presidential elections in 1982 and the Jayawardene government did not like their rise. There are no convincing evidence as to say whether JVP actively involved in 1983 ethnic riots, but it was once again banned with several other left wing parties and its leadership went underground. It is highly suspected that this ban was due to J.R Jayawardene's pro-US policy. It's also to be noted that he highly downgraded the diplomatic relations with Cuba and the Soviet Union.  Origins  Having been banned and driven underground, the JVP began preparing to topple the government. They began targeting opponents, carried out robberies to collect funds and began acquiring weapons. Usually collecting pistols and shotguns from owners who had gained gun licences from the government. Thereafter they planned to raid armories of the government, who had deployed its forces to the north and east of the country to counter the Tamil militancy. Prior to the rebellion On 15 December 1986, the JVP abducted and murdered Daya Pathirana, leader of the Independent Students Union (ISU) of University of Colombo, which was a rival of the Socialist Student Union, the student's wing of the JVP. By this time JVP was already designated as a terrorist organization by J.R Jayawardene. =Attacks on Politicians= In 1979 JVP opposed the usage of military to fight the LTTE and other groups like TELA. They changed the decision of opposing the war against LTTE and it was shortly after it's ban. Lionel Bopage left the party due to this change of decisions. Grenade attacks on the Mahajana Party Mahajana party was a close ally of the Tamil Militant groups. In 1986 JVP conducted a grenade attack on the buildings of the Mahajana Party and assassinated Vijaya Kumaratunga in 1988 when the insurgency came to the peak. Insurgency = Early attacks= On 15 April 1987, JVP attacked the Pallekele Army Camp in Kandy. Led by a former soldier, Mahinda, under the directions of Shantha Bandara, the JVP seized 12 Type 56 assault rifles, seven sub-machine guns and ammunition. In May 1987, the Sri Lanka Armed Forces launched the Vadamarachchi Operation (Operation Liberation) with the objective of defeating the LTTE militarily and re-establishing government control in areas dominated by Tamil militants. However, the second phase of Operation Liberation was abandoned with the Indian intervention by Operation Poomalai, which led to the signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord in Colombo on 29 July 1987 and arrival of the first troops in the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) on 30 July.Icon of unparalleled bravery and commitment The prospect of Tamil autonomy in the north together with the presence of Indian troops stirred up a wave of Sinhalese nationalism and a sudden growth of anti-government violence by a new group that emerged as an offshoot of the JVP‚Äîthe Patriotic Liberation Organization (Deshapremi Janatha Viyaparaya‚ÄîDJV) led by Saman Piyasiri Fernando. On 7 June 1987, Sri Lanka Air Force Base, SLAF Katunayake and the Kotelawala Defence Academy were attacked and weapons and ammunition were stolen, while four of the attackers were killed. DJV claimed responsibility and the Criminal Investigation Department investigation resulted in 13 JVP members arrested. On 18 August, when the first parliamentary group meeting took place after the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, assassination attempt was made on the president and prime minister, resulting in the deaths of two, including a Member of Parliament (MP). Lalith Athulathmudali, the Minister National Security and Deputy Minister of Defence, was severely wounded.132 Demonstrators were shot Dead and 712 Arrested During Island -wide Protests Against the Indo ‚Äì Lanka Accord of July 29th 1987 The investigation into the raid on the Pallekelle army camp in April 1987 resulted in the discharge of thirty-seven soldiers suspected of having links with the JVP. =Murder and intimidation= The DJV thereafter launched a campaign of intimidation against the government and the ruling United National Party (UNP) party, killing more than seventy members of parliament between July and November 1989. Organised in cells of three people and based around Matara in the south, the JVP murdered probably thousands of people and crippled the country with violently- enforced hartals (general strikes) for two years. Individuals or organizations were warned or intimidated with messages dropped in the night to homes or posters or graffiti that appeared over night. Those that did not cooperate were brutally killed, with the repercussions extended to their family members. Executions were mostly carried out at night with armed groups coming to the homes of the victims and carrying them away to be tortured, executed and left as an example, while occasional bombings took place. In most cases the funerals of these victims were not allowed by the JVP, traditional final rights were not allowed and the caskets were to be carried below knee level as a mark of disrespect. With these techniques of fear and intimidation the JVP was able to bring the country to stand still. Acts of sabotage were common, with destruction of government property, electric transformers were a common target. Killings took place in both urban and rural areas and the government seemed powerless in the face of it. One of the key police officers leading the effort to counter the JVP, Senior Superintendent of Police Terrence Perera, Director of Counter Subversive Unit was killed by the JVP gunmen in Battaramulla on 3 December 1987 and Harsha Abhayawardene, UNP General Secretary was killed by the JVP gunmen in Wellawatte on 23 December 1987. Killings continued into 1987, on 7 February Mervyn Cooray, Member of Parliament for Panadura survived an assassination attempt, on 1 May; Nandalal Fernando the new UNP General Secretary was killed; G.V.S. de Silva, Galle District Minister was shot dead that month; Lionel Jayatilleke, Minister of Relief and Rehabilitation was shot dead on 26 September 1988 and on 21 October Tudor Keerthinanda, UNP Working Committee Member was killed. 1989 saw the killing of Senior Superintendent of Police Bennet Perera, former Director - CID, who was gunned down, at Mount Lavinia on 1 May 1989, Assistant Superintendent of Police Shahabdeen, Security Officer - Minister of Transport was killed on 23 August 1989, Captain B. M. Perera of the military police was shot dead in Moratuwa on 12 September 1989. Close to 50 school principals were killed, along with tea planters (Tea estate superintendents), public servants and clergy between 1988 and 1989 for defying JVP orders sent via short memos known as chits. Many professionals were also killed for defying JVP orders these included Dr Gladys Jayawardene, Chairperson, State Pharmaceuticals Corporation; D. C. Athukorale, Chief Engineer, Colombo Port Authority; Liayana Pathirana, Working Director, Salt Corporation. 102 Sri Lanka Freedom Party supporters and 64 United Socialist Alliance supporters were also killed. over 30 Buddhist monks were killed. Many businessmen were killed, including the Shanmugam brothers, K. Gunaratnam and Shabeer Hussain. Several Indian expats were also killed, including Mr. and Mrs. Banshall working at the Pelwatta Sugar Factory, D. K. Sundaram, P. Nadar Weeramuni and Ann Herchoi. =Notable attacks = Although much of the insurgency was a medium intensity conflict, with targeted assassinations and intimidation. Major attacks include the 1987 grenade attack in the Sri Lankan Parliament and 1989 Temple of the Tooth attack. In addition the militant wing of the JVP led by Saman Piyasiri Fernando staged several major attacks on military installations in the south of the island and a minority on the North led by Premakumar Gunaratnam. These included; *Pallekele Army Camp attack (April 1987). *Kallar Indian Peacekeeping Force camp attackSri Lanka in 1987: Indian Intervention and Resurgence of the JVP. Pfaffenberger B.

In many of these attacks, the JVP targeted the armories capturing weapons and ammunition that it claimed to use against Indian Peace Keeping Forces.Missed opportunities, War on terror revisited In total the JVP killed 342 police personnel and 209 armed forces personnel. Anti-India Campaign In 1986 JVP started delivering posters warning about a possible Indian invasion. Since the 1970s Wijeweera have been aware of Indian expansionism due to the border conflict with China. JVP attacked a Indian armory in Kallar to steal weapons. The attack was led by the Trincomalee cell leader Premakumar Gunaratnam of the DJV. JVP conducted massive protest strikes to enforce both the Tamil and Sinhalese groups to fight against the Indian forces. Although with the anti-Indian sentiment, JVP denied any violence against the Indian Tamils.  Threats on military families  The JVP made a serious misjudgment when, through the DJV, it called for the killing of members of the families of the security personal. This destroyed the small but significant amount of support that it enjoyed among the lower ranks of the armed forces, and made it possible for the government to justify its campaign of terror. Most notable of the attacks on families of the security personal, was the attack on family of Deputy Inspector General of Police Premadasa c. On 24 July 1988, his ancestral home in Poddala was surrounded and set ablaze by suspected members of the JVP, Udugampola's mother, brother, sister-in-law and two small children were killed in the fire. Following this Udugampola began a ruthless crackdown of the JVP in the Southern and Central provinces. As a means of pacifying the support base of JVP, a wide range of acts of cruelty, including the torture and mass murder of school children, who were allegedly JVP supporters, was carried out by the state.

Herath during a search operation. Although the Government won a decisive military victory there were credible accusations of brutality and extrajudicial killings. =Saman Piyasiri's death and decline of the Insurgency= After Wijeweera died in late 1989, the leader of the DJV - Saman Piyasiri Fernando seized power within the Major groups of the JVP but within the end of OPS Combine, STF were able to capture and execute him and his successor Lalith Wijeratne seized the power of the JVP party. Post- Insurgency combat Within early 1990; the government reported deaths of all three major leaders and the insurgent party that consisted of over 15,000 troops were almost defeated and gave up the arms. The government had a decisive victory over the JVP, which returned to democratic politics under the leadership of Somawansa Amarasinghe when it's 12-year-long ban got lifted in 1994.  Fatalities  According to international terrorism expert Dr. Rohan Gunaratna's research, JVP killed 30 politicians, 23 academics, 1 clergy, 2 government officials, 89 civilians and 61 service personnel, from July 1987 to January 1990. Rest of the killings (21 armed fighters) are attributed to state or state sponsored death squads. A European delegation estimated the total death toll to be 60,000, while more conservative estimates have placed the death toll at 35,000, with the vast majority being perpetrated by state- sponsored death squads.  Legacy  Following the insurrection, the JVP was relaunched and participated in electoral politics. At the parliamentary elections held on 2 April 2004, the party was part of the United People's Freedom Alliance that won 45.6% of the popular vote and 105 out of 225 seats. As the second partner in this alliance it became part of the government. It also supported the winning candidate Mahinda Rajapakse in the 2005 parliamentary election. Along with the UNP it supported General Sarath Fonseka in the 2010 presidential election. In popular media The documentary film of the Second JVP insurgency titled Udugan Yamaya was made in 2006. It was screened in The Times London film festival the same year.

However, it has since come to light that Florence Thompson was not a pea-picker. Her automobile had broken down, and her family became stranded outside the farm. A pea-picker is a derogatory reference to poor, migrant workers during the Great Depression. These people were unskilled, poorly educated workers, employable only in menial jobs, such as harvesting crops and, as such, received poor wages for working long hours under dreadful conditions. Some of these people were photographed by Dorothea Lange. The term \\"pea picker\\" is used to distinguish a group as a lower social class from some other similar group, such as the \\"pea-picking\\" Smiths, as opposed to the \\"respectable\\" Smiths. Temporary communities of pea-pickers are called pea picker camps and farms that employed them were pea-picker farms.  Dust Bowl Migrants  During the Great Depression, the American government, without due process, deported between 1 and 2 million American citizens and legal residents of Mexican descent. This mass deportation, known as the Mexican Repatriation, took place from 1929 to 1939 and was empowered by panic of an alarmingly high unemployment rate sweeping over the United States at this time. The Dust Bowl was the name given to the Great Plains region devastated by drought in 1930s depression-ridden America. This triggered the migration of men, women, and children seeking work, food, and shelter making their way to California, hoping to find opportunity and a better life. Most of the migrants moving west were not farmers, having lived either in a town or city doing some kind of blue-collar work. They headed west unaware of the poor living conditions and only seasonal work that largely depended on the weather. The Midwesterners impacted by both the Depression and Dust Bowl packed up their families and relocated in hopes of finding a chance at the American dream, having realized that the drought and dust storms would not end anytime soon. Some sold what they could not bring along and began to drive west on Route 66. The term pea-picker was used to describe these particular group migrant workers in a negative context. The workers who picked these peas before the Dust Bowl migration and Mexican Repatriation had taken place were mostly Mexicans, Filipinos, and single white males before the Depression. This new work force of unskilled migrant families from the Dust Bowl now took their place and helped coin the term pea-pickers.

He was the frontman of The Scream during 1989. He was also the frontman of M√∂tley Cr√ºe between 1992 and 1996 during original frontman Vince Neil's hiatus from the band. Corabi is considered a \\"rock journeyman\\" with a long list of collaborations with established acts such as Angora , Union and ESP (both with former Kiss lead guitarist Bruce Kulick), Ratt (as a guitarist), Twenty 4 Seven (with his then Ratt bandmate Bobby Blotzer), Zen Lunatic, Brides of Destruction, and Angel City Outlaws (with his then Ratt bandmates Robbie Crane and Bobby Blotzer, and former Ratt guitarist Keri Kelli, who he replaced in Ratt). He was the lead singer for supergroup The Dead Daisies. He was the d.j. of the Partianimals. M√∂tley Cr√ºe After M√∂tley Cr√ºe parted ways with lead singer Vince Neil in February 1992, Corabi was hired as his replacement. Bassist Nikki Sixx and drummer Tommy Lee stated that Corabi was capable of singing anything and everything and that was the reason they chose him. Corabi recorded the self-titled M√∂tley Cr√ºe album in 1994 and the EP Quaternary. Though the music was heavier and more elaborate than the rest of the M√∂tley Cr√ºe catalog, it did not sell as well as previous releases from the band. Before a concert in Tucson, Arizona which had a 15,000 seat capacity, only 4,000 tickets were sold, Nikki Sixx decided to call into a Tucson area radio station and offer any fan who showed up free tickets. When only two people took Sixx up on his offer, Sixx stated he knew this version of the band was finished. During the early stages of the writing of a new album which would become Generation Swine, M√∂tley Cr√ºe's record label refused to provide funds to record the album unless Vince Neil was let back in the band. Rather than hiring another label, M√∂tley Cr√ºe acceded to the demand and by 1997, Corabi departed the band and Neil returned. Many of the songs from the early writing session were used on the album and Corabi is credited on the liner notes for co-writing some of the songs. Corabi and the rest of M√∂tley Cr√ºe made personal appearances at London's Hard Rock Cafe at a private party in February 1994 promoting their self-titled M√∂tley Cr√ºe album. The evening was also attended by many M√∂tley Cr√ºe competition winners who were invited into the VIP area to chat to Corabi, as well as the other 3 band members. Corabi spoke about his time with the band and his thoughts on the first record with M√∂tley Cr√ºe. Corabi said: \\"my record was the first record that they had done that didn't go platinum, didn't make some sort of crazy noise, and everybody panicked\\". In July 2015, Corabi and his band performed at a bar and played all of the songs off of the M√∂tley Cr√ºe album. Weeks after the performance, Corabi stated \\"The album would have made it if this was under a different band name\\". Union Union was formed with John Corabi, Bruce Kulick (recently released from KISS), Brent Fitz, and Jamie Hunting. John and Bruce wrote what would become the first Union album (self titled) and proceeded with a nationwide acoustic tour, to promote the album, featuring just Corabi and Kulick (both on guitar). Soon the full band went on a world tour headlining small venues in support of the Union album. The second album \\"Live in the Galaxy\\" was a live recording with two acoustic tracks recorded in a mobile studio. The third and final Union album, The Blue Room, was a more polished sound than the first studio CD. Union never officially called it quits (playing live shows every so often with guest drummers and bass players), but with Kulick playing along with Grand Funk Railroad, Corabi playing with many bands, most notably Ratt, and both members being tied up in solo projects, Union will probably never return to write new studio material. ESP (Eric Singer Project) ESP also featured guitarist Bruce Kulick, bassist Karl Cochran, and drummer Eric Singer. Ace Frehley makes a special appearance on the Hendrix cover Foxy Lady. Twenty 4 Seven Twenty 4 Seven, a collaboration with Corabi, drummer Bobby Blotzer (Ratt, Contraband), and guitarist Rob Marcello (Ironhorse, Obsession, Danger Danger) recorded 10 hard rock tracks entitled Destination Everywhere (US, 2002). Cardboard Vampyres In early 2004, Corabi joined Jerry Cantrell's covers band Cardboard Vampyres. Also in the band were The Cult guitarist Billy Duffy, The Cult bassist Chris Wyse and drummer Josh Howser. The band played at various venues in the United States between 2004 and 2005. They predominately played along the West Coast. No albums were released by the band. Brides of Destruction Corabi was featured as second guitarist on Brides of Destruction's 2004 album Here Comes The Brides. He had multiple reasons for leaving the band. One was the fact that he was told it would be an effort much like the \\"M√∂tley Cr√ºe\\" album. Secondly, he did not get along very well with Tracii Guns. He also said in an interview that \\"when Nikki told me about the band, I was really into the idea of writing another CD with the heavy sound of the M√∂tley Cr√ºe album, but as we got more into recording, we had our drummer singing what was supposed to be the best song on the CD, when Nikki and Tracii were saying that our singer was the hot new thing, it just did not make sense to me.\\" Other projects Early in 2008, Corabi attended the Motley Cruise, a 4-day cruise in the Caribbean (Miami, Key West and Cozumel, Mexico) including performers such as Vince Neil, Skid Row, Ratt, Slaughter, Endeverafter and Lynam. On this cruise, Corabi joined Vince Neil on stage to perform \\"Highway to Hell\\" by AC/DC. This performance was a unique event as fans witnessed the two M√∂tley Cr√ºe vocalists share the same microphone. In August 2008, Corabi parted ways with Ratt in order to pursue his solo career.

Three PacifiCat catamarans - Explorer, Discovery, and Voyager - were built between 1996 and 2000 as part of a major public project to improve ferry service between the Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island. The first two catamarans were briefly used for revenue service between Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver and Departure Bay in Nanaimo from 1999 to March 2000. The third catamaran, PacifiCat Voyager, was completed in early 2000 but had yet to enter revenue service by the time the project was cancelled. The PacifiCat project started in June 1994 with an estimated total cost of $210 million. By the time the ships were finished, the total cost had ballooned to $463 million.R. G. Harvey, Head On! Collisions of Egos, Ethics, and Politics in B.C.'s Transportation History (Surrey BC: Heritage House, 2004) A 1999 report by the Auditor-General of British Columbia concluded that the fast ferry project had been beset by \\"significant breakdowns in both governance and risk management.\\"Office of the Auditor-General of British Columbia, A review of the fast ferry project: governance and risk management (Victoria, BC: Office of the Auditor-General of British Columbia, 1999). History =Background= Car ferry service on the route between Horseshoe Bay, West Vancouver and Departure Bay, Nanaimo had originally been started by the private Black Ball Line in June 1953. Black Ball was purchased by the government of British Columbia on November 30, 1961 and its routes absorbed into the BC Ferries system. Both the Horseshoe Bay and Departure Bay ferry terminals are located within residential areas. Departure Bay terminal is located at Vancouver Island's northern tip of their part of the Trans-Canada Highway (Nanaimo). Horseshoe Bay is the mainland connection to the Trans- Canada Highway freeway. In addition, the Horseshoe Bay terminal is located in a very small cove next to a commercial marina and there have been several collisions between pleasure craft and ferries over the years. The provincial government was aware of these issues as early as 1972, when a Ministry of Highways report recommended developing a new ferry route between Iona Island south of Vancouver and Gabriola Island south of Nanaimo. Another report recommending the same solution was produced in 1988. This proposed route is 22 kilometres shorter than the current route and would have also eliminated the problems with ferry terminal traffic. Ultimately, the government did build a new ferry terminal for Nanaimo: Duke Point, which opened in 1997 and which serves as terminus for the ferry route from Tsawwassen. Duke Point was intended to divert truck traffic away from the Horsesehoe Bay-Departure Bay route. This situation was the starting point from which the fast ferry project developed. =The project= In 1992, BC Ferries and the government began reviewing the issue of ferry service to Nanaimo. The final report, completed in January 1994, neither supported nor endorsed the use of fast ferries for service between Horseshoe Bay and Departure Bay. At a meeting in February 1994 that involved the minister responsible for BC Ferries, the corporation's management indicated that using fast ferries required \\"further extensive analysis.\\" Their advice was ignored, and less than two months later the minister responsible, Glen Clark, ordered the ferry corporation to cede control over its long-term planning to the government. After the government finished drafting the plan, Clark pressed the BC Ferries board for a quick approval, and the Auditor-General's report about the fast ferries partly blames him for rushing the fast ferries into production. The result was a ten- year capital plan which had been crafted by the government. It bypassed leasing a fast ferry for trials in BC waters and went directly to implementation. Several other projects previously considered essential, such as replacing one of the northern ferries, were deferred in favour of the fast ferries. In addition, the construction of the fast ferries would be used to revitalise the province's shipbuilding industry, furthering policy goals beyond merely improving ferry service to Nanaimo. The BC Ferries board, which was required to rubberstamp the plan, noted several concerns about the fast ferry aspect when asking the cabinet to give it final approval. A public announcement of the fast ferry project was made in June 1994; it had been decided to immediately proceed with building three fast ferries. The government claimed the fast ferries would cost $210 million total, and Clark later insisted that this figure had included everything \\"right down to the toilet paper.\\"William Rayner, Scandall!! 130 Years of Damnable Deeds in Lotus Land (Surrey, BC: Heritage House, 2001), 14. The truth was that little actual analysis had been done: not even the type of ship (single hull or catamaran), nor their dimensions had even been determined when the $210 million figure was announced. The government hoped that private shipyards would be able to build the ships on a fixed-cost basis. This turned out not to be the case; the shipbuilding industry was less enthusiastic than anticipated. Moreover, none of the shipyards being considered for the work had the facilities to build the fast ferries. BC Ferries had no choice but to do the work itself on a cost- plus basis. It would have to act as project manager and assume the risk of the fast ferries. Catamaran Ferries International (CFI), a wholly owned subsidiary of BC Ferries, was incorporated in March 1996 to carry out the work and construction started later that year. The CFI board was suddenly replaced a year later with a new one whose members were either part of CFI management, had significant business ties to the company, or already served on BC Ferries board. According to the Auditor-General's report, this is a textbook example of poor corporate governance. It \\"created the awkward accountability relationship of having board members account to themselves for their performance.\\" =Fate of the PacifiCats= North Vancouver in October 2005 On March 1, 2000, Joy MacPhail, then the minister responsible for BC Ferries, recommended to the government that it abandon the PacifiCat project, calling it \\"a failed experiment.\\" Her colleagues agreed, and the ships were put up for sale at an asking price of $120 million for all three. They turned out to be difficult to sell, due to their highly specialised design and a saturated market. After a change of government in May 2001, and more attempts to sell at a higher price, the ships were finally put up for auction in March 2003 and were sold to the Washington Marine Group for $19.4 million CAD, 4.2% of what it cost to build them. Washington Marine Group announced on July 28, 2009 that they had sold the three ships for an undisclosed amount to Abu Dhabi MAR, a luxury yacht builder. In late 2014, the U.A.E. donated all three ferries to the Egyptian government. Vessel characteristics Waterjets of a PacifiCat The PacifiCats were designed by Philip Hercus of Australia and Robert Allan Limited of Vancouver. Hercus developed the hull form and Robert Allan handled the outfitting aspects of the design.Building of the PacifiCat Ferries The PacifiCats were custom-designed to fit BC Ferries' docks, which allow simultaneous loading on two full-length roll-through vehicle decks. This trait gives the PacifiCats their unique appearance in comparison with other fast ferries. Once the design was complete, CFI divided the construction work into over a hundred modules, built by a variety of BC companies. Completed modules were transported to CFI's facility in North Vancouver and assembled there. This was done both to stimulate the shipbuilding industry and to make it unnecessary to build a much larger facility for the PacifiCat construction. The fast ferries were intended to achieve crossing times that were 30 minutes faster than those of conventional ferries, making twelve crossings per day rather than eight. Although they initially achieved this crossing time, complaints of the wash of the ships wake forced the ferries to take a longer route, and operate a slower speed around Bowen Island. An archived version of BC Ferries website stated in the year 2000 that a PacifiCat sailing was 1 hour 20 minutes, only 15 minutes shorter than a sailing with a regular vessel (1 hour 35 minutes).BC Ferries Schedule: Horseshoe Bay-Departure Bay References External links * PacifiCat specifications Category:High- speed craft Category:Ships built in British Columbia Category:Ferry classes ","title":"PacifiCat-class ferry"},{"id":"2148320","text":"Taras Bulba (; ) is a romanticized historical novella by Nikolai Gogol. It describes the life of an old Zaporozhian Cossack, Taras Bulba, and his two sons, Andriy and Ostap. The sons study at the Kiev Academy and then return home, whereupon the three men set out on a journey to the Zaporizhian Sich (the Zaporizhian Cossack headquarters, located in southern Ukraine), where they join other Cossacks and go to war against Poland. The main character is based on several historical personalities, and other characters are not as exaggerated or grotesque as was common in Gogol's later fiction. The story can be understood in the context of the Romantic nationalism movement in literature, which developed around a historical ethnic culture which meets the Romantic ideal. Initially published in 1835 as part of a collection of stories, it was much more abridged and evinced some differences in the storyline compared with the better known 1842 edition, the latter having been described by Victor Erlich as a \\"paragon of civic virtue and a force of patriotic edification\\" while the first being \\"distinctly Cossack jingoism\\". Inspiration The character of Taras Bulba, the main hero of this novel, is a composite of several historical personalities. It might be based on the real family history of an ancestor of Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay, Cossack Ataman Okhrim Makukha from Starodub, who killed his son Nazar for switching to the Polish side during the Khmelnytsky Uprising. Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay's uncle, Grigory Illich Miklouho-Maclay, studied together with Gogol in Nizhyn Gymnasium and probably told the family legend to Gogol.How Makuha turned into Taras Bulba. Another possible inspiration was the hero of the folk song \\"The deeds of Sava Chaly\\", published by Mykhaylo Maksymovych, about Cossack captain Sava Chaly (executed in 1741 after serving as a colonel in the private army of a Polish noble), whose killing was ordered by his own father for betraying the Ukrainian cause. Plot =1842 revised edition= Taras Bulba's two sons, Ostap and Andriy, return home from an Orthodox seminary in Kiev. Ostap is the more adventurous, whereas Andriy has deeply romantic feelings of an introvert. While in Kiev, he fell in love with a young Polish noble girl, the daughter of the Governor of Kowno, but after a couple of meetings (edging into her house and in church), he stopped seeing her when her family returned home. Taras Bulba gives his sons the opportunity to go to war. They reach the Cossack camp at the Zaporozhian Sich, where there is much merrymaking. Taras attempts to rouse the Cossacks to go into battle. He rallies them to replace the existing Hetman when the Hetman is reluctant to break the peace treaty. They soon have the opportunity to fight the Poles, who rule all Ukraine west of the Dnieper River. The Poles, led by their ultra-Catholic king, are accused of atrocities against Orthodox Christians, in which they are aided by Jews. After killing many of the Jewish merchants at the Sich, the Cossacks set off on a campaign against the Poles. They besiege Dubno Castle where, surrounded by the Cossacks and short of supplies, the inhabitants begin to starve. One night a Tatar woman comes to Andriy and rouses him. He finds her face familiar and then recalls she is the servant of the Polish girl he was in love with. She advises him that all are starving inside the walls. He accompanies her through a secret passage starting in the marsh that goes into the monastery inside the city walls. Andriy brings loaves of bread with him for the starving girl and her mother. He is horrified by what he sees and in a fury of love, forsakes his heritage for the Polish girl. Meanwhile, several companies of Polish soldiers march into Dubno to relieve the siege, and destroy a regiment of Cossacks. A number of battles ensue. Taras learns of his son's betrayal from Yankel the Jew, whom he saved earlier in the story. During one of the final battles, he sees Andriy riding in Polish garb from the castle and has his men draw him to the woods, where he takes him off his horse. Taras bitterly scolds his son, telling him \\"I gave you life, I will take it\\", and shoots him dead. Taras and Ostap continue fighting the Poles. Ostap is captured while his father is knocked out. When Taras regains consciousness he learns that his son was taken prisoner by the Poles. Yankel agrees to take Taras to Warsaw, where Ostap is held captive, hiding Taras in a cartload of bricks. Once in Warsaw, a group of Jews help Yankel dress Taras as a German count. They go into the prison to see Ostap, but Taras unwittingly reveals himself as a Cossack, and only escapes by use of a great bribe. Instead, they attend the execution the following day. During the execution, Ostap does not make a single sound, even while being broken on the wheel, but, disheartened as he nears death, he calls aloud on his father, unaware of his presence. Taras answers him from the crowd, thus giving himself away, but manages to escape. Taras returns home to find all of his old Cossack friends dead and younger Cossacks in their place. He goes to war again. The new Hetman wishes to make peace with the Poles, which Taras is strongly against, warning that the Poles are treacherous and will not honour their words. Failing to convince the Hetman, Taras takes his regiment away to continue the assault independently. As Taras predicted, once the new Hetman agrees to a truce, the Poles betray him and kill a number of Cossacks. Taras and his men continue to fight and are finally caught in a ruined fortress, where they battle until the last man is defeated. Taras is nailed and tied to a tree and set aflame. Even in this state, he calls out to his men to continue the fight, claiming that a new Tsar is coming who will rule the earth. The story ends with Cossacks on the Dniester River recalling the great feats of Taras and his unwavering Cossack spirit. =Differences from 1835 edition= For reasons that are currently disputed, the 1842 edition was expanded by three chapters and included Russian nationalist themes. Potential reasons include a necessity to stay in line with the official tsarist ideology, as well as the author's changing political and aesthetic views (later manifested in Dead Souls and Selected Passages from Correspondence with his Friends).

Adaptations Keleberda, Ukraine The story was the basis of an opera, Taras Bulba, by Ukrainian composer Mykola Lysenko, first performed in 1924 some 12 years after the composer's death. The opera's libretto was written by Mykhailo Starytsky, the composer's cousin. Czech composer Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek's Taras Bulba, a symphonic rhapsody for orchestra, was written in the years 1915‚Äì1918, inspired in part by the mass slaughter of World War I. The composition was first performed on 9 October 1921 by Franti≈°ek Neumann, and in Prague on 9 November 1924 by V√°clav Talich and the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra. The story has been adapted to film many times: * Taras Bulba (1909), a silent film adaptation, directed by Aleksandr Drankov * Taras Bulba (1924), made in Germany by the Russian exile Joseph N. Ermolieff * Taras Bulba (1936), a French production, directed by Russian director Alexis Granovsky, with noted decor by Andrei Andreyev * The Rebel Son (1938), a British film starring Harry Baur with a supporting cast of significant British actors * Taras Bulba (1962), an American adaption starring Yul Brynner and Tony Curtis and directed by J. Lee Thompson; this adaptation featured a significant musical score by Franz Waxman, which received an Academy Award nomination. Bernard Herrmann called it \\"the score of a lifetime\\". * Taras Bulba, the Cossack, a 1962 Italian film version *Who's the conqueror? (, 1977), a Ukrainian film starring Nudtawat Saksiri as Taras. * Taras Bulba (2009), directed by Vladimir Bortko, commissioned by the Russian state TV and paid for totally by the Russian Ministry of Culture. It includes Ukrainian, Russian and Polish actors such as Bohdan Stupka (as Taras Bulba), Ada Rogovtseva (as Taras Bulba's wife), Igor Petrenko (as Andriy Bulba), Vladimir Vdovichenkov (as Ostap Bulba) and Magdalena Mielcarz (as a Polish noble girl). The movie was filmed at several locations in Ukraine such as Zaporizhia, Khotyn and Kamianets-Podilskyi during 2007. The screenplay used the 1842 edition of the novel. *Veer (2010), a Hindi movie set in 19th century India, is based in part on the plot of Taras Bulba. In popular culture * The 2007 Jane Smiley book Ten Days in the Hills features a film producer trying to film a new version of Taras Bulba. * The villainous character Taurus Bulba (an anthropomorphic bull) in the Disney cartoon show Darkwing Duck is a nod, if in name only, to the literary character of Taras Bulba. * In the 2002 video game No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way, Cate Archer (controlled by the player) finds a copy of Taras Bulba by Nikolai Gogol when searching a vanquished bad guy. * In 2007, a copy of the book is part of the literature selected by Christopher McCandless in the movie Into the Wild among other similar works of authors such as Leo Tolstoy, Henry David Thoreau and Jack London.

The normative principle teaches that whatever is not prohibited in Scripture is permitted in worship, as long as it is agreeable to the peace and unity of the Church. In short, there must be agreement with the general practice of the Church and no prohibition in Scripture for whatever is done in worship. The normative principle is often contrasted with the regulative principle of worship, which teaches that only those practices or elements which are specifically commanded or modelled in Scripture are to be permitted in worship services. An example of the difference between these two principles of worship (normative and regulative) can be illustrated by the example of announcing notices in church (i.e. news, upcoming events, and other information). The normative principle holds that since such activity is not prohibited in the New Testament, and since announcing notices may well be beneficial for the congregation and their involvement in the activities of the church, then this practice should be permitted. On the other hand, the regulative principle would ban such activity from taking place in the church service, because no example of announcing notices at the church gathering can be found in the New Testament. Historically, the definition of the normative principle concerned replicating scriptural patterns, i.e. norms. Dr. Peter Masters of the Metropolitan Tabernacle wrote an article on this subject and explained that the historic distinction is different to the one above. Historically, regulative meant simply obeying direct instructions, whereas normative meant not just the requirements of the regulative principle, but also replicating patterns established by the scriptures. One example of this concerns congregationalist polity in respect of church government: - proponents of this polity point to the biblical norm of churches being individually autonomous.

Tegmark 2014, \\"Our Mathematical Universe\\", Knopf Description Tegmark's MUH is: Our external physical reality is a mathematical structure. That is, the physical universe is not merely described by mathematics, but is mathematics (specifically, a mathematical structure). Mathematical existence equals physical existence, and all structures that exist mathematically exist physically as well. Observers, including humans, are \\"self-aware substructures (SASs)\\". In any mathematical structure complex enough to contain such substructures, they \\"will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically 'real' world\\".Tegmark (1998), p. 1. The theory can be considered a form of Pythagoreanism or Platonism in that it proposes the existence of mathematical entities; a form of mathematical monism in that it denies that anything exists except mathematical objects; and a formal expression of ontic structural realism. Tegmark claims that the hypothesis has no free parameters and is not observationally ruled out. Thus, he reasons, it is preferred over other theories-of-everything by Occam's Razor. Tegmark also considers augmenting the MUH with a second assumption, the computable universe hypothesis (CUH), which says that the mathematical structure that is our external physical reality is defined by computable functions. The MUH is related to Tegmark's categorization of four levels of the multiverse. This categorization posits a nested hierarchy of increasing diversity, with worlds corresponding to different sets of initial conditions (level 1), physical constants (level 2), quantum branches (level 3), and altogether different equations or mathematical structures (level 4). Reception Andreas Albrecht of Imperial College in London, called it a \\"provocative\\" solution to one of the central problems facing physics. Although he \\"wouldn't dare\\" go so far as to say he believes it, he noted that \\"it's actually quite difficult to construct a theory where everything we see is all there is\\". Criticisms and responses =Definition of the ensemble= J√ºrgen SchmidhuberJ. Schmidhuber (2000) \\"Algorithmic Theories of Everything.\\" argues that \\"Although Tegmark suggests that '... all mathematical structures are a priori given equal statistical weight,' there is no way of assigning equal non-vanishing probability to all (infinitely many) mathematical structures.\\" Schmidhuber puts forward a more restricted ensemble which admits only universe representations describable by constructive mathematics, that is, computer programs; e.g., the Global Digital Mathematics Library and Digital Library of Mathematical Functions, linked open data representations of formalized fundamental theorems intended to serve as building blocks for additional mathematical results. He explicitly includes universe representations describable by non-halting programs whose output bits converge after finite time, although the convergence time itself may not be predictable by a halting program, due to the undecidability of the halting problem. In response, Tegmark notes (sec. V.E) that a constructive mathematics formalized measure of free parameter variations of physical dimensions, constants, and laws over all universes has not yet been constructed for the string theory landscape either, so this should not be regarded as a \\"show- stopper\\". =Consistency with G√∂del's theorem= It has also been suggested that the MUH is inconsistent with G√∂del's incompleteness theorem. In a three- way debate between Tegmark and fellow physicists Piet Hut and Mark Alford, the \\"secularist\\" (Alford) states that \\"the methods allowed by formalists cannot prove all the theorems in a sufficiently powerful system... The idea that math is 'out there' is incompatible with the idea that it consists of formal systems.\\" Tegmark's response in (sec VI.A.1) is to offer a new hypothesis \\"that only G√∂del-complete (fully decidable) mathematical structures have physical existence. This drastically shrinks the Level IV multiverse, essentially placing an upper limit on complexity, and may have the attractive side effect of explaining the relative simplicity of our universe.\\" Tegmark goes on to note that although conventional theories in physics are G√∂del- undecidable, the actual mathematical structure describing our world could still be G√∂del-complete, and \\"could in principle contain observers capable of thinking about G√∂del-incomplete mathematics, just as finite-state digital computers can prove certain theorems about G√∂del-incomplete formal systems like Peano arithmetic.\\" In (sec. VII) he gives a more detailed response, proposing as an alternative to MUH the more restricted \\"Computable Universe Hypothesis\\" (CUH) which only includes mathematical structures that are simple enough that G√∂del's theorem does not require them to contain any undecidable or uncomputable theorems. Tegmark admits that this approach faces \\"serious challenges\\", including (a) it excludes much of the mathematical landscape; (b) the measure on the space of allowed theories may itself be uncomputable; and (c) \\"virtually all historically successful theories of physics violate the CUH\\". =Observability= Stoeger, Ellis, and KircherW. R. Stoeger, G. F. R. Ellis, U. Kirchner (2006) \\"Multiverses and Cosmology: Philosophical Issues.\\" (sec. 7) note that in a true multiverse theory, \\"the universes are then completely disjoint and nothing that happens in any one of them is causally linked to what happens in any other one. This lack of any causal connection in such multiverses really places them beyond any scientific support\\". EllisG.F.R. Ellis, \\"83 years of general relativity and cosmology: Progress and problems\\", Class. Quantum Grav. 16, A37-A75, 1999 (p29) specifically criticizes the MUH, stating that an infinite ensemble of completely disconnected universes is \\"completely untestable, despite hopeful remarks sometimes made, see, e.g., Tegmark (1998).\\" Tegmark maintains that MUH is testable, stating that it predicts (a) that \\"physics research will uncover mathematical regularities in nature\\", and (b) by assuming that we occupy a typical member of the multiverse of mathematical structures, one could \\"start testing multiverse predictions by assessing how typical our universe is\\" ( sec. VIII.C). =Plausibility of radical Platonism= The MUH is based on the Radical Platonist view that math is an external reality ( sec V.C). However, JannesGil Jannes, \\"Some comments on 'The Mathematical Universe'\\", Found. Phys. 39, 397-406, 2009 arXiv:0904.0867 argues that \\"mathematics is at least in part a human construction\\", on the basis that if it is an external reality, then it should be found in some other animals as well: \\"Tegmark argues that, if we want to give a complete description of reality, then we will need a language independent of us humans, understandable for non-human sentient entities, such as aliens and future supercomputers\\". Brian Greene (B. Greene 2011, \\"The Hidden Reality \\" p. 299) argues similarly: \\"The deepest description of the universe should not require concepts whose meaning relies on human experience or interpretation. Reality transcends our existence and so shouldn't, in any fundamental way, depend on ideas of our making.\\" However, there are many non- human entities, plenty of which are intelligent, and many of which can apprehend, memorise, compare and even approximately add numerical quantities. Several animals have also passed the mirror test of self-consciousness. But a few surprising examples of mathematical abstraction notwithstanding (for example, chimpanzees can be trained to carry out symbolic addition with digits, or the report of a parrot understanding a ‚Äúzero-like concept‚Äù), all examples of animal intelligence with respect to mathematics are limited to basic counting abilities. He adds, \\"non-human intelligent beings should exist that understand the language of advanced mathematics. However, none of the non-human intelligent beings that we know of confirm the status of (advanced) mathematics as an objective language.\\" In the paper \\"On Math, Matter and Mind\\" the secularist viewpoint examined argues (sec. VI.A) that math is evolving over time, there is \\"no reason to think it is converging to a definite structure, with fixed questions and established ways to address them\\", and also that \\"The Radical Platonist position is just another metaphysical theory like solipsism... In the end the metaphysics just demands that we use a different language for saying what we already knew.\\" Tegmark responds (sec VI.A.1) that \\"The notion of a mathematical structure is rigorously defined in any book on Model Theory\\", and that non-human mathematics would only differ from our own \\"because we are uncovering a different part of what is in fact a consistent and unified picture, so math is converging in this sense.\\" In his 2014 book on the MUH, Tegmark argues that the resolution is not that we invent the language of mathematics, but that we discover the structure of mathematics. =Coexistence of all mathematical structures= Don Page has arguedD. Page, \\"Predictions and Tests of Multiverse Theories.\\" (sec 4) that \\"At the ultimate level, there can be only one world and, if mathematical structures are broad enough to include all possible worlds or at least our own, there must be one unique mathematical structure that describes ultimate reality. So I think it is logical nonsense to talk of Level 4 in the sense of the co-existence of all mathematical structures.\\" This means there can only be one mathematical corpus. Tegmark responds ( sec. V.E) that \\"this is less inconsistent with Level IV than it may sound, since many mathematical structures decompose into unrelated substructures, and separate ones can be unified.\\" =Consistency with our \\"simple universe\\"= Alexander Vilenkin commentsA. Vilenkin (2006) Many Worlds in One: The Search for Other Universes. Hill and Wang, New York. (Ch. 19, p. 203) that \\"the number of mathematical structures increases with increasing complexity, suggesting that 'typical' structures should be horrendously large and cumbersome. This seems to be in conflict with the beauty and simplicity of the theories describing our world\\". He goes on to note (footnote 8, p. 222) that Tegmark's solution to this problem, the assigning of lower \\"weights\\" to the more complex structures ( sec. V.B) seems arbitrary (\\"Who determines the weights?\\") and may not be logically consistent (\\"It seems to introduce an additional mathematical structure, but all of them are supposed to be already included in the set\\"). =Occam's razor= Tegmark has been criticized as misunderstanding the nature and application of Occam's razor; Massimo Pigliucci reminds that \\"Occam's razor is just a useful heuristic, it should never be used as the final arbiter to decide which theory is to be favored\\".

Charles Theodore \\"Charley\\" Straight (January 16, 1891 - September 22, 1940) was an American pianist, bandleader and composer. He started his career in 1909 accompanying singer Gene Greene in Vaudeville. In 1916, he began working at the Imperial Piano Roll Company in Chicago, where he recorded dozens of piano rolls. He became a popular bandleader in Chicago during the 1920s. His band, the Charley Straight Orchestra, had a long term engagement at the Rendezvous Caf√© from 1922 to 1925 and recorded for Paramount Records and Brunswick Records in the 1920s. During the 1920s Straight worked with Roy Bargy on the latter's eight Piano Syncopations. In describing \\"Rufenreddy\\", the fifth in the series, the ragtime historian \\"Perfessor\\" Bill Edwards stated: :The actual parentage of this piece will likely remain obscured to some degree, since Bargy's collaborator, Charley Straight, more or less may have let Bargy take credit when the piano rolls of the Eight Piano Syncopations were transcribed into sheet music form. It is likely that Straight wrote the bulk of the composition in 1918, and Bargy added many of his individual touches to it in the performance, the end result being that there is some of each of them within. Straight died in Chicago on the evening of September 22, 1940, after being struck by a car. At the time, Straight was working as a sanitary inspector for the city of Chicago, and was emerging from a manhole in the street.

He hosted WKBW-TV's Eyewitness News in Buffalo, New York, for 34 years, from 1964 to 1998, becoming an iconic broadcaster well known in both the Buffalo area and in Southern Ontario, which was within WKBW's broadcast area. Weinstein was known for his powerful delivery and sense of humor. Weinstein, weatherman Tom Jolls and sports anchor Rick Azar fronted the broadcast from 1965 until Azar's retirement in 1989. Weinstein was inducted into the Buffalo Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 1998 and the N.Y. State Broadcasters Association in 2006. Life and career Born in Rochester, New York, to Jewish emigrants from Lithuania, Weinstein began his broadcast career while he was in high school, working at WHAM Radio as an actor on several locally produced programs under the tutelage of Bill Hanrahan. He was paid $7 a day for his work on WHAM, in which Weinstein, whose voice was already mature by the age of 15, would often play the roles of adults. Weinstein's work on WHAM eventually led to a single national radio appearance, as a one-scene character on The Aldrich Family, for which he was paid $230, an unusually high sum for the day.Cichon, Steve. Remembering a Buffalo legend with excerpts from Irv, Buffalo's Anchorman. BuffaloStories.com. Retrieved December 27, 2017. He initially hoped to pursue an acting career, but a conversation with Robert Mitchum, who warned Weinstein of a shortage of opportunities in the entertainment industry, convinced Weinstein to attend broadcasting school in New York City instead. After sending out hundreds of resumes and barely getting any responses, he began his professional career at KWWL-TV in Waterloo, Iowa (which lasted only a few months) and various stations in West Virginia, in-between working low-end jobs and nearly giving up before his wife convinced him not to accept a job with the United States Postal Service. In West Virginia, he took the pseudonym \\"Mark Roberts\\" and was influenced by the styles of Paul Harvey. He was hired as a newscaster at WKBW Radio in Buffalo in 1958, a role he chose to be closer to his hometown; initially working under Art Wander, Weinstein eventually became news director. His fast-paced style featured strong writing and alliteration (\\"pistol-packing punks\\" referring to petty criminals, or \\"Buffalo blaze busters\\" in place of firefighters), and it was here where he began referring to himself as \\"Irv.\\" In 1964, Weinstein was hired as news director and anchorman at sister station WKBW-TV, an ABC Network affiliate. At the time, the station's news programs were rated #3 in a three-station market.Baker, Vic. 50 Golden Years of Excellence on WIVB-TV. WIVB-TV. Retrieved 2010-12-10. By 1974, WKBW-TV's Eyewitness News program had an audience larger than the combined audience of the two competing Buffalo stations. It remained the top-rated newscast until Weinstein's retirement in 1998 and beyond. Weinstein's innovations would later be adapted by Mel Kampmann for the national \\"Action News\\" franchise. In 1968, Weinstein briefly returned to his broadcast beginnings as an actor in WKBW radio's Halloween adaptation of Orson Welles' War of the Worlds. Weinstein also appeared in a 1971 remake, which was re-run in 1998. During his 40-year career in Buffalo, Weinstein appeared in numerous stage productions and, in the early 1980s, co- owned The Playhouse, a legit theater in downtown Buffalo. A WKBW-TV promo for Eyewitness News included a jingle: :\\"Irv Weinstein, you're really a pro! :Ya got all the news that we wanna know. :You tell it like it is and never throw us a curve, :Nobody says it like Ir-r-r-r-v ! :Eye-wit-ness News (Yes-sah!)\\" The day of his retirement, December 31, 1998, was proclaimed \\"Irv Weinstein Day in Erie County\\" by then-Erie County Executive Dennis Gorski. Five days later, Toronto columnist David Frum wrote a tribute titled \\"He came from Buffalo\\" in Canada's National Post newspaper, writing, \\"The way the French feel about Jerry Lewis, that's how we feel about Irv Weinstein\\".David Frum, \\"He came from Buffalo\\", National Post, January 5, 1999 In October 2004, Weinstein's status as \\"an icon of television journalism in Buffalo\\" was discussed on the floor of the Ontario Legislature by MPP Tim Hudak. Weinstein was considered a quintessential part of Buffalo culture during his time with WKBW and beyond. At the time of his retirement, his 33-year tenure with WKBW was the longest for any news anchor with a single television station in Buffalo, a record that would stand until 2017 when Jacquie Walker of WIVB-TV surpassed Weinstein.http://blog.buffalostories.com/jacquie-walker-record- setting-class/ Weinstein, who shifted away from the sensationalist approach toward the end of his career, explained that the reason he reported on arson so much compared to, for example, Toronto, was a practical one: Toronto had most of its wood structures burnt down in the 1904 Great Fire of Toronto, while Buffalo still had a large stock of wood-frame houses, and thus there were indeed more fires in Buffalo than in Toronto. Weinstein was known for using alliteration in his reporting. Either he or WNEW-TV's Mel Epstein coined the phrase \\"It's 11:00. Do you know where your children are?,\\" a public service announcement now used on numerous other U.S. stations. The phrase \\"topping tonight's Eyewitness News\\" continues to be used to open WKBW's newscasts to the present day.

Personal life Weinstein and his wife Elaine spent most of their retirement in Irvine, California; they also maintained a second home in Ellicottville, New York until a few years before he died. Irv and Elaine Weinstein were married from 1955 until his death. Their daughter, Beth Krom, served two terms as mayor of Irvine and now serves on the City Council. The Weinsteins' son, Marc, is co-owner of Amoeba Music, and their younger daughter, Rachel Lloyd, is an artist and theater administrator in the Pittsburgh area. In summer 2016, Weinstein was diagnosed with amyotropic lateral sclerosis, after first experiencing symptoms of the disease in March. With the diagnosis, Weinstein relocated to an assisted living facility in Mission Viejo, California, where he would spend the end of his life. As of November 2016, he could no longer walk but still had full function of his arms and torso and was in good mental condition; he was given a prognosis of five years to live and could still speak (with some audible difficulty as the disease also affected his breathing). By April 2017, Weinstein was no longer able to speak and communicated solely by typing. Weinstein died in Mission Viejo on December 26, 2017, aged 87, from complications of the disease.

History The chart came about as a result of the small but influential impact of electronic dance music on the radio in the United States and the stations that program it. Debuting as Hot Dance Radio Airplay in the issue dated October 25, 2003, it initially ranked the 25 most-played songs over eight radio stations playing mainly dance music and monitored by Nielsen BDS. When published for the first time, \\"Just the Way You Are\\" by Milky was ranked as the number-one song, but that was following after a ten-week unpublished chart history. \\"Crazy in Love\\" by Beyonc√© featuring Jay Z spent the first seven weeks of the chart at number one, which Billboard recognizes retroactively. With the issue dated November 19, 2011, Billboard changed the name of the chart to Dance/Mix Show Airplay to reflect a change in its methodology. Instead of just ranking the amount of airplay songs received at six dance-formatted reporters (four terrestrial radio stations, plus SiriusXM's BPM channel and Music Choice's Dance/Electronica channel), the panel of monitored stations was expanded to include mixshow plays on mainstream top 40 and rhythmic radio during hours in which these stations featured mixshow programming. On November 26, 2014, the 25-song chart expanded to 40 positions (effective with the December 6, 2014 issue), allowing more dance tracks to chart while simultaneously making the chart less pop-oriented. In comparison to other dance charts, American commercial radio's definition of dance music is arguably more marginal, which is reflected in the chart's content. After the alterations made in 2011, the chart somewhat moved away from its initial purpose of charting conventional dance songs, instead including more remixed pop and urban songs in place of traditional forms of dance music and/or music by dance artists. By 2012, however, the influx of EDM songs in mix shows and the addition of two additional dance outlets amongst those monitored once again increased the dance content found on the chart, thereby decreasing to some extent the number of remixed pop and R&B; tracks included. Chart criteria There are 40 positions on this chart and it is solely based on radio airplay. Eight stations (five terrestrial, one cable, one satellite and one online internet service), serve as exclusive reporters and are electronically monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems.BDS Monitored Station Panel Songs are ranked by a calculation of the total number of spins per week with its \\"audience impression\\", which is based upon exact times of airplay and each station's Nielsen Audio listener data. The chart also includes 84 selected mainstream, adult, and rhythmic top 40 reporters that feature mix shows as part of their programming. Songs receiving the greatest growth will receive a \\"bullet\\", although there are tracks that will also get bullets if the loss in detections doesn't exceed the percentage of downtime from a monitored station. \\"Airpower\\" awards are issued to songs that appear on the top 20 of both the airplay and audience chart for the first time, while the \\"greatest gainer\\" award is given to song with the largest increase in detections. A song with six or more spins in its first week is awarded an \\"airplay add\\". If a song is tied for the most spins in the same week, the one with the biggest increase that previous week will rank higher, but if both songs show the same amount of spins regardless of detection the song that is being played at more stations is ranked higher. Songs that fall below the top 15 and have been on the chart after 26 weeks are removed and go to the 20-song recurrent status. Chart statistics and other facts With the exception of Madonna, David Guetta, Kaskade, Calvin Harris, and the Chainsmokers, all of whom crossed over to pop from dance and continue to be core dance artists, the artists in the following lists are pop and/or rhythmic acts; the songs that landed them on the dance chart were generally remixes of the original recordings. Rihanna and Katy Perry, however, have been more successful on both the Dance Club Songs and Dance/Mix Show Airplay charts, where Madonna leads with 50 number ones at the former, seven of those on this chart, followed by Rihanna with 33 (9 on this chart) and Perry with 19 (including 4 on this chart) while achieving success at pop and rhythmic. Guetta is the only male artist to see 8 of his 14 Dance Club Songs number ones also reach number one on Dance/Mix Show Airplay. =Artists with the most number-one hits= As of 2019, Calvin Harris and Rihanna have accumulated the most chart toppers, with twelve number ones apiece. Rihanna was also the youngest artist on this chart to reach number one with \\"Pon de Replay\\" in 2005, when she was 16, while Harris leads among male artists. Madonna is the only artist on this chart to see seven singles all reach number one consecutively, making her the only artist on this chart to accomplish this feat, and also has the most number ones from one album, all four singles from Confessions on a Dance Floor topped the chart (although she is now tied with Katy Perry, as her four singles from Teenage Dream have reached the top spot). In addition, Madonna was also named the number-one Dance Airplay artist for the decade (2003‚Äì2009) in Billboard's decade-end recap in 2009. The Chainsmokers have the most number ones among duo or groups with 7, followed by Cascada and AnnaGrace, who are tied with 3. However, AnnaGrace are the only duo or group to score their first consecutive number ones on this chart, while the Chainsmokers claim the most weeks at number one, with 48. :1.

In 2009, the track was named the number one single of the decade in Billboard's decade-end recap of the top 50 Dance Airplay songs from 2003 to 2009. *As of the May 2, 2009 issue, \\"Every Word\\" by Ercola featuring Daniela spent most of 46 week run in the top 10 without dropping below number 10. *Despina Vandi's 2004 hit \\"Gia\\" was the chart's first foreign-language recording to reach number one. *Kelly Osbourne's single \\"One Word\\" holds the distinction of being the first song to claim the number one spot on the Dance/Mix Show Airplay, Hot Dance Club Play and Hot Dance Single Sales charts in the same week.

The track reached number one in December 2008 but continued its 45-week chart run in 2009. Because of Billboard's requirements for songs that had charted from December of the previous year to November of the following year, \\"Feel Your Love\\" became eligible in this case. *In 2010, both Inna and Kesha became the first artists on this chart to swap each other's number-one chart positions with debut singles, with Inna's \\"Hot\\" succeeding Kesha's \\"Tik Tok\\" and then having the latter returned the favor to the former. *In 2010, Deadmau5 featuring Rob Swire's \\"Ghosts N Stuff\\" became the first song on this chart to make the slowest climb to number one, 24 weeks.

This person will begin to anticipate the problems and experience the results before anything actually happens to them. People suffering from this probably have hyperalgesia.

After numerous member changes, he disbanded the group in February 1985. In May 1987 Michiro formed a group called Video Stalin, which mostly made videos instead of albums; they disbanded in 1988. In 1989 Michiro created a new band named Stalin and continued to make music with them until 1993. History =1979: Jiheitai= Circa 1979, Michiro Endo, a 29-year-old socialist activist, formed a punk band called , means autistic body. Several of their songs would later become The Stalin songs, such as \\"Ideologist\\", \\"Niku\\" and their versions of \\"No Fun\\" and \\"Light My Fire\\". =1980‚Äì1981: Beginning= In June 1980 Endo formed The Stalin. He chose the name because \\"Joseph Stalin is very hated by most people in Japan, so it is very good for our image.\\" Originally a three piece with Endo on vocals and bass, Atsushi on guitar and Jun on drums. Shintaro joined as bassist later in the month, however their first single, \\"Dendou Kokeshi\\", was already recorded without him and was released on September 5, 1980. On April 7, 1981, they released the Stalinism EP. In July Tam replaced Atsushi on guitar. On November 4, at a live performance at Kanto Gakuin High School, Endo is arrested for indecent exposure. On December 24, 1981, they released their first full-length album, the half studio/half live, Trash. =1982‚Äì1985: The End= The Stalin were one of the bands to star in Sogo Ishii's movie Burst City, released on March 13, 1982. Their concert on June 24 was the last with drummer Jun, however he still appears on their major label debut album Stop Jap, as well as their first major label single \\"Romantist\\", both released on July 1, as they were recorded before he left. \\"Romantist\\" is a reworked version of \\"Ideologist\\" from Trash, and has become their most well-known song worldwide. Hitoshi joins as drummer in July 1982. Sogo Ishii also directed a promotional video for \\"Romantist\\", as well as \\"Stop Jap\\" and their next single \\"Allergy\\", which was released on August 25. Their concert on September 27, 1982, was the last with Hitoshi. In November Keigo joins on drums, but leaves in December along with Tam. In January 1983, Makoto joins on guitar and Tatsuya on drums. On February 10, they released their fourth single \\"Go Go Stalin\\". Their next album Mushi and single \\"Nothing\\", are both released on April 25. After a June 11 gig, Makoto and Tatsuya leave. Also in June 1983 Shintaro leaves. At a concert on September 17, Teruya and former member Jun, play as guest support on guitar and drums respectively. In early 1984, June-Bleed joins as guitarist. But on March 17, 1984, he leaves and is eventually replaced by Masahiro. Also in March, Jun rejoins the band on drums and Teruya joins as bassist. In May, their song \\"Chicken Farm\\" appeared on MRR's international Welcome to 1984 compilation. The concert on June 3 was the last with Masahiro and Teruya. Also in June Hiroshi would become support bassist, never officially joining. Masayuki joined on guitar in August 1984. Their last album Fish Inn was released on November 20. After their concert on December 29, Endo announced \\"This is the end of The Stalin\\". Although their true last concert was held on February 21, 1985 at Chofu Daiei Studio and was entitled \\"I was the Stalin\\". The show was recorded and released, on both VHS, Last Live - Zessan Kaisan Naka!!, and double LP, For Never - Last Live, on May 25, 1985. =1987‚Äì1988: Video Stalin= In May 1987, Endo created Video Stalin, a group of musicians who were more of a video production group than a band. They released three videos and one album. One of the videos, Your Order! The History of The Stalin, can be considered a The Stalin video instead, as it is composed almost entirely of live footage and promo clips throughout The Stalin's career. They disbanded in 1988. =1989‚Äì1993: Stalin= Inspired by the monumental events of 1988, especially the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Endo revived The Stalin with new members and a new name, now simply Stalin. He had been fascinated with the Polish Solidarity movement, which began the same year as The Stalin, and after a visit to Warsaw he organized a Japanese tour for the Polish punk band Dezerter. Stalin completed the cultural exchange in 1990 when they toured Eastern Europe, which was recorded and released as the Saigo no Akai Natsu -Stalin Call in East Europe- video. They had a couple line-up changes and released six singles, four studio albums and one live album, before calling it quits in 1993. =Occasional performances and Endo's death= On February 8, 2001 there was a special The Stalin concert entitled \\"One Night Dream\\". Michiro Endo performed with Keigo Nakata (ex:The Stalin) on drums, Shinichi Suzuki (Pulling Teeth) on guitar and Katsuta on bass. Other bands and artists also performed and paid tribute to the group, including Loopus, Cobra, Panta and Kenzi. The show was recorded and released as the Hakike Gasuruhodo Romanchikku Daze!! video on June 30, 2001. The concert coincided with the release of the 365 - A Tribute to The Stalin album, which has some of the bands that performed covering The Stalin songs. On December 1, 2010 two tribute albums were released. One entitled Romantist - The Stalin, Michiro Endo Tribute Album, features bands such as Buck-Tick, Dir en grey, Group Tamashii and Jun Togawa covering The Stalin and Michiro Endo songs. The other Red Demon, Blue Demon - Michiro Endo 60th Birthday Anniversary Tribute Album, features different artists and was first released at Endo's concert on November 14 to coincide with his 60th birthday. Endo still gathered various musicians for occasional The Stalin performances. The last being a few shows in early 2011 as \\"The Stalin Z\\", with the line-up of Endo on vocals, Tatsuya Nakamura (ex:The Stalin) on drums, KenKen (Rize) on bass and Kazuhiro Hyaku (Mo'Some Tonebender) on guitar.

It is occasionally referred to as aichmophobia, although this term may also refer to a more general fear of sharply pointed objects. Since the mid-2000s, it has also been referred to as trypanophobia, although the origin and proper usage of that term is highly controversial. Overview and incidence The condition was officially recognized in 1994 in the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition) as a specific phobia of blood- injection-injury type phobia. Phobic level responses to injections cause sufferers to avoid inoculations, blood tests, and in the more severe cases, all medical care. It is estimated that at least 10% of American adults have a fear of needles, and it is likely that the actual number is larger, as the most severe cases are never documented due to the tendency of the sufferer to avoid all medical treatment. Evolutionary basis According to Dr. James G. Hamilton, author of the pioneering paper on needle phobia, it is likely that the form of needle phobia that is genetic has some basis in evolution, given that thousands of years ago humans who meticulously avoided stab wounds and other incidences of pierced flesh would have a greater chance of survival. The discussion of the evolutionary basis of needle phobia in Hamilton's review article concerns the vasovagal type of needle phobia, which is a sub-type of blood-injection-injury type phobia. This type of needle phobia is uniquely characterized by a two-phase vasovagal response.\\"Oxford Textbook of Psychopathology\\" by Theodore Millon, Paul H. Blaney, Roger D. Davis (1999) , p. 82 First, there is a brief acceleration of heart rate and blood pressure. This is followed by a rapid plunge in both heart rate and blood pressure, sometimes leading to unconsciousness. The loss of consciousness is sometimes accompanied by convulsions and numerous rapid changes in the levels of many different hormones. Other medical journal articles have discussed additional aspects of this possible link between vasovagal syncope and evolutionary fitness in blood-injection-injury phobias. An evolutionary psychology theory that explains the association to vasovagal syncope is that some forms of fainting are non-verbal signals that developed in response to increased inter- group aggression during the paleolithic. A non-combatant who has fainted signals that they are not a threat. This might explain the association between fainting and stimuli such as bloodletting and injuries. Types Although needle phobia is defined simply as an extreme fear of medically related shots/injections, it appears in several varieties. =Vasovagal= Although most specific phobias stem from the individuals themselves, the most common type of needle phobia, affecting 50% of those afflicted, is an inherited vasovagal reflex reaction. Approximately 80% of people with a fear of needles report that a relative within the first degree exhibits the same disorder. People who suffer from vasovagal needle phobia fear the sight, thought, or feeling of needles or needle-like objects. The primary symptom of vasovagal fear is vasovagal syncope, or fainting due to a decrease of blood pressure. Many people who suffer from fainting during needle procedures report no conscious fear of the needle procedure itself, but a great fear of the vasovagal syncope reaction. A study in the medical journal Circulation concluded that in many patients with this condition (as well as patients with the broader range of blood/injury phobias), an initial episode of vasovagal syncope during a needle procedure may be the primary cause of needle phobia rather than any basic fear of needles. These findings reverse the more commonly held beliefs about the cause-and-effect pattern of needle phobics with vasovagal syncope. The physiological changes associated with this type of phobia also include feeling faint, sweating, dizziness, nausea, pallor, tinnitus, panic attacks, and initially high blood pressure and heart rate followed by a plunge in both at the moment of injection. Although most phobias are dangerous to some degree, needle phobia is one of the few that actually kill. In cases of severe phobia, the drop in blood pressure caused by the vasovagal shock reflex may cause death. In Hamilton's 1995 review article on needle phobia, he was able to document 23 deaths as a direct result of vasovagal shock during a needle procedure. The best treatment strategy for this type of needle phobia has historically been desensitization or the progressive exposure of the patient to gradually more frightening stimuli, allowing them to become desensitized to the stimulus that triggers the phobic response. In recent years, a technique known as \\"applied tension\\" has become increasingly accepted as an often effective means for maintaining blood pressure to avoid the unpleasant, and sometimes dangerous, aspects of the vasovagal reaction. =Associative= Associative fear of needles is the second most common type, affecting 30% of needle phobics. This type is the classic specific phobia in which a traumatic event such as an extremely painful medical procedure or witnessing a family member or friend undergo such, causes the patient to associate all procedures involving needles with the original negative experience. This form of fear of needles causes symptoms that are primarily psychological in nature, such as extreme unexplained anxiety, insomnia, preoccupation with the coming procedure, and panic attacks. Effective treatments include cognitive therapy, hypnosis, and/or the administration of anti-anxiety medication. =Resistive= Resistive fear of needles occurs when the underlying fear involves not simply needles or injections but also being controlled or restrained. It typically stems from repressive upbringing or poor handling of prior needle procedures (for example, forced physical or emotional restraint). This form of needle phobia affects around 20% of those afflicted. Symptoms include combativeness, high heart rate coupled with extremely high blood pressure, violent resistance, avoidance, and flight. The suggested treatment is psychotherapy, this may include teaching the patient self-injection techniques or finding a trusted health care provider. =Hyperalgesic= Hyperalgesic fear of needles is another form that does not have as much to do with fear of the actual needle. Patients with this form have an inherited hypersensitivity to pain, or hyperalgesia. To them, the pain of an injection is unbearably great and many cannot understand how anyone can tolerate such procedures. This form of fear of needles affects approximately 10% of people with needle phobia. The symptoms include extreme explained anxiety, and elevated blood pressure and heart rate at the immediate point of needle penetration or seconds before. The recommended forms of treatment include some form of anesthesia, either topical or general. Vicarious Whilst witnessing procedures involving needles it is possible for the phobic to suffer the symptoms of a needle phobic attack without actually being injected. Prompted by the sight of the injection the phobic may exhibit the normal symptoms of vasovagal syncope and fainting or collapse is common. While the cause of this is not known, it may be due to the phobic imagining the procedure being performed on themselves. Recent neuroscience research shows that feeling a pin prick sensation and watching someone else's hand get pricked by a pin activate the same part of the brain. Comorbidity and triggers Fear of needles, especially in its more severe forms, is often comorbid with other phobias and psychological ailments; for example, iatrophobia, or an irrational fear of doctors, is often seen in needle phobic patients. A needle phobic patient does not need to physically be in a doctor's office to experience panic attacks or anxiety brought on by needle phobia. There are many triggers in the outside world that can bring on an attack through association. Some of these are blood, injuries, the sight of the needle physically or on a screen, paper pins, syringes, examination rooms, white lab coats, dentists, nurses, the antiseptic smell associated with offices and hospitals, the sight of a person who physically resembles the patient's regular health care provider, or even reading about the fear. Treatment The medical literature suggests a number of treatments that have been proven effective for specific cases of needle phobia, but provides very little guidance to predict which treatment may be effective for any specific case. The following are some of the treatments that have been shown to be effective in some specific cases. * Ethyl Chloride Spray (and other freezing agents). Easily administered, but provides only superficial pain control. * Jet injectors. Jet injectors work by introducing substances into the body through a jet of high pressure gas as opposed to by a needle. Though these eliminate the needle, some people report that they cause more pain. Also, they are only helpful in a very limited number of situations involving needles; for example, insulin and inoculations. *Iontophoresis. Iontophoresis drives anesthetic through the skin by using an electric current. It provides effective anesthesia, but is generally unavailable to consumers on the commercial market and some regard it as inconvenient to use. * EMLA. EMLA is a topical anesthetic cream that is a eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine. It is a prescription cream in the United States, and is available without prescription in some other countries. Although not as effective as iontophoresis, since EMLA does not penetrate as deeply as iontophoresis-driven anesthetics, EMLA provides a simpler application than iontophoresis. EMLA penetrates much more deeply than ordinary topical anesthetics, and it works adequately for many individuals. * Ametop. Ametop gel Smith & Nephew. Ametop Gel information . appears to be more effective than EMLA for eliminating pain during venepuncture. * Lidocaine/tetracaine patch. A self-heating patch containing a eutectic mixture of lidocaine and tetracaine is available in several countries, and has been specifically approved by government agencies for use in needle procedures. The patch is sold under the trade name Synera in the United States and Rapydan in European Union. Each patch is packaged in an air-tight pouch. It begins to heat up slightly when the patch is removed from the packaging and exposed to the air. The patch requires 20 to 30 minutes to achieve full anesthetic effect. The Synera patch was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration on 23 June 2005. * Behavioral therapy. Effectiveness of this varies greatly depending on the person and the severity of the condition. There is some debate as to the effectiveness of behavioral treatments for specific phobias, though some data are available to support the efficacy of approaches such as exposure therapy. Any therapy that endorses relaxation methods may be contraindicated for the treatment of fear of needles as this approach encourages a drop in blood pressure that only enhances the vasovagal reflex. In response to this, graded exposure approaches can include a coping component relying on applied tension as a way to prevent complications associated with the vasovagal response to specific blood, injury, injection type stimulus.Dental Fear Central. Blood-injury-injection phobia, fainting, and applied tension. * Nitrous Oxide (Laughing Gas). This will provide sedation and reduce anxiety for the patient, along with some mild analgesic effects. * Inhalation General Anesthesia. This will eliminate all pain and also all memory of any needle procedure. However, it is often regarded as a very extreme solution. It is not covered by insurance in most cases, and most physicians will not order it. It can be risky and expensive and may require a hospital stay. * Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan), alprazolam (Xanax), or clonazepam (Klonopin), may help alleviate the anxiety of needle phobics, according to Dr. James Hamilton. These medications have an onset of action within 5 to 15 minutes from ingestion. A relatively large oral dose may be necessary.

Trinity is a non-profit organization with more than 150 physicians and is the largest employer in Minot. Trinity's facilities include two acute care hospitals, several clinics, and a 292-bed long-term care and retirement facility. Trinity has been designated as a Level II trauma center. History During the early 1920s, Lutheran pastors from across the Northwest Territory gathered in Minot, ND, to sketch out plans for a hospital. In 1922, the Trinity Hospital Association was formed and within weeks ground was broken for a 30-bed hospital unit, the first of four such units to be constructed over the course of a decade. During the 1970s, Trinity Hospital merged with the Lutheran Home to form Trinity Medical Center. In the early 1990s, Trinity formed its own physician services department ‚Äì Trinity Medical Group. On January 1, 1999, Trinity Medical Center changed its name to Trinity Health. In 1999, the Trinity CancerCare Center was built adjacent to Health Center-Town & Country. On May 3, 2001, Trinity Health merged with UniMed Medical Center, Medical Arts Clinic and Kenmare Community Hospital under the banner of Trinity Health. Expansion In January 2009, it opened its CancerCare Cottage, a building which accommodations for cancer patients and their caregivers while they are receiving treatment at Trinity Health's CancerCare Center. In April 2008, it was reportedly considering building a medical park. In January 2009, it bought of land southwest Minot for a new hospital and medical park. On October 31, 2016, Trinity officially sought rezoning of the land for the expansion from agricultural to general commercial usage. In November 2016, it was reported that Trinity planned to offer $430 million in bonds to fund their expansion and to pay off previously issued bonds. In January 2017, Trinity chose TEG Architects of Jeffersonville, Indiana to design and coordinate the construction of their new expansion. Legal Settlements =Cerner= In March 2014, Cerner settled a legal dispute with Trinity Health over allegations of defective financial software with a settlement of $106 million. =Hepatitis C= In August 2013, patients receiving contracted blood work and podiatry services from Trinity contracted Hepatitis C. Fifty-two individuals were infected, including 48 residents or former residents of ManorCare Health Services. According to CDC data, the North Dakota outbreak accounted for one- fourth of all hepatitis cases nationally since 2008 and has been called the second-largest outbreak of Hepatitis C. In April 2014, the victims of the Hepatitis C outbreak sued HCR Manor Care. In March 2015, HCR Manor Care and 21 victims sued Trinity after it became clear that Trinity was the more likely source of the outbreak. HCR Manor Care and the 21 victims alleged that an employee of Trinity's outpatient laboratory service reused needles and didn't follow infection control practices. In September 2016, Trinity reached a confidential, out-of-court settlement with 21 of the victims. Controversy =Dr Marc Eichler= In October 2015, Dr Marc Eichler, a neurosurgeon employed by Trinity Health, was arrested for allegedly exchanging pictures of his genitals via Snapchat with two girls under 15, and he is alleged to have fondled one of them when she was babysitting. On October 29, 2015, Eichler was charged with gross sexual imposition, a Class AA felony, and two counts of luring minors by computer, both Class B felonies. On October 7, 2016, Eichler's trial was rescheduled. In February 2017, Eichler changed his plea and agreed to plead guilty to one count of production of child pornography.

Allan Junior High School (est. 1916.) Stephen F. Austin High School, more commonly known as Austin High, is a public high school in Austin, Texas, United States, and part of the Austin Independent School District (AISD). Founded in 1881, it is one of the oldest public high schools west of the Mississippi River, and was the one of the first public high schools in the state of Texas. The campus is located near Downtown Austin along the Colorado River (Lady Bird Lake). The school, originally known simply as Austin High School, was renamed in 1953 after Stephen F. Austin, locally revered as the \\"Father of Texas\\". It is one of eleven high schools in the Austin Independent School District. Roughly 2,500 students attend the school in grades nine through twelve. The school's current building is its third, following four 19th-century and 20th-century locations in other buildings. Austin High's official motto is Mens Agitat Molem () or, \\"Mind Over Matter\\". The official mascot is Mr. Maroo. The school received a level of notoriety when the film Dazed and Confused was released in 1993, loosely based on Austin High. History Austin High School opened in September 1881, with classes held on the third floor of the West Austin School building at 11th Street and Rio Grande Street. Due to population growth, instruction was held at the First Baptist Church, the temporary State Capitol, and the Smith Opera House. The first Austin High School campus, located at 9th Street and Trinity Street, opened in 1900. In 1925, Austin High School moved to 1212 Rio Grande Street, the former building of John T. Allan Junior High School ( 1916), which had relocated to 9th at Trinity. In 1956, the first seven African-American students began attending Austin High School as part of desegregation; a total of 13 black students attended white high schools in AISD at that time.\\"Five Decades of Social Change: A Timeline.\\" Austin Public Library. Retrieved on June 6, 2016. In 1975, Austin High School moved to its current building, designed by Jay W. Barnes II. The first classes at the Cesar Chavez campus commenced on August 25, 1975. The Mr. Maroo mascot was officially adopted by the student council in the 1965‚Äì66 school year. Campus The current campus is bounded by Lady Bird Lake (formerly Town Lake) on one side and a freeway on the other. Because of the school's relative isolation and the campus's relative newness, Amy Wells, author of Both Sides Now: The Story of School Desegregation‚Äôs Graduates, wrote that the school \\"has a somewhat suburban feel\\".Wells, Amy. Both Sides Now: The Story of School Desegregation‚Äôs Graduates. University of California Press, January 20, 2009. , 9780520942486. p. 48. Academics As of the late 1970s the school was considered to be the best in its area, according to Wells. It was known for having a university preparatory curriculum. Austin High was called a National Blue Ribbon School in 1982‚Äì83. Neighborhoods served Downtown Austin, the Westcreek Neighborhood and the family apartment complexes of the University of Texas at Austin are zoned to Austin High School.

Student body the school was 54% non-Hispanic White, 37% Hispanic and Latino, 8% black, and 2% Asian, reflecting the overall demographics of Austin. As of 1980 most of the White students originated from west Austin, including Tarrytown. There were also middle class and poor students. Some black students originated from Clarksville, an area housing servants' quarters that, until school desegregation, was served by segregated black schools. By 1980, court-ordered desegregation added a heavily Hispanic and Latino section of South Austin, and a black section of northeast Austin to the student population.Wells, Amy.

As of the late 1970s the school was 66% White, 19% Hispanic, and 15% African-American, making it one of the more racially balanced AISD schools; at the time there was less Hispanic representation and more White representation than the district average. In 1980 the federal court system forced AISD to begin desegregation busing.Wells, Amy. Both Sides Now: The Story of School Desegregation‚Äôs Graduates.

Its formal name is Genden Sh√©drup Dargy√© Trashi Gy√©su khyilw√© Ling ().Nietupski (1999), p. 21. Labrang is located in Xiahe County, Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu, in the traditional Tibetan area of Amdo. Labrang Monastery is home to the largest number of monks outside the Tibet Autonomous Region. Xiahe is about four hours by car from the provincial capital Lanzhou. In the early part of the 20th century, Labrang was by far the largest and most influential monastery in Amdo. It is located on the Daxia River, a tributary of the Yellow River.Nietupski (1999), p. 16. History The monastery was founded in 1709 by the first Jamyang Zh√©pa, Ngawang Ts√∂ndr√º. Labrang Monastry used to be one of several Bhutanese enclaves in the Tibetan region, before the Annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China. It is Tibetan Buddhism's most important monastery town outside the Tibetan Autonomous Region. Labrang Monastery is situated at the strategic intersection of two major Asian cultures‚ÄîTibetan and Mongolian ‚Äî and was one of the largest Buddhist monastic universities. In the early 20th century, it housed several thousand monks. Labrang was also a gathering point for numerous annual religious festivals and was the seat of a Tibetan power base that strove to maintain regional autonomy through the shifting alliances and bloody conflicts that took place between 1700 and 1950. In April 1985 the Assembly Hall burned down. It was replaced and the new building was consecrated in 1990.Dorje (2009), p. 800. Description The monastery complex dominates the western part of the village. The white walls and gilded roofs feature a blend of Tibetan and Indian Vihara architectural styles. The monastery contains 18 halls, six institutes of learning, a gilded stupa, a sutra debate area, and houses nearly 60,000 sutras. It has a Buddhist museum with a large collection of Buddha statues, sutras and murals. In addition, a large amount of Tibetan language books, including books on history is available for purchase, together with medicines, calendars, music and art objects. There used to be a great gold- painted statue of the Buddha, more than 50 feet high, which was surrounded by rows of surrounding Buddhas in niches.Cabot (2003), p. 153, with photo taken in 1923. The monastery today is an important place for Buddhist ceremonies and activities. From January 4 to 17 and June 26, to July 15, (these dates may change according to the lunar calendar), the great Buddhist ceremony will be held with Buddha-unfolding, sutra enchanting, praying, sutra debates, etc. Muslim Ma clique attacks Young monk and prayer wheels Circumambulation of a chorten by visitors The Hui Muslim Ma clique under Generals Ma Qi and Ma Bufang launched several attacks against Labrang as part of a general anti- Golok Tibetan campaign. Ma Qi occupied Labrang Monastery in 1917, the first time non-Tibetans had seized it. Ma Qi defeated the Tibetan forces with his Hui troops. His forces were praised by foreigners who traveled through Qinghai for their fighting abilities. After ethnic rioting between Hui and Tibetans emerged in 1918, Ma Qi defeated the Tibetans. He heavily taxed the town for 8 years. In 1921, Ma Qi and his Muslim army decisively crushed the Tibetan monks of Labrang Monastery when they tried to oppose him. In 1925, a Tibetan rebellion broke out, with thousands of Tibetans driving out the Hui. Ma Qi responded with 3000 Hui troops, who retook Labrang and machine-gunned thousands of Tibetan monks as they tried to flee. During a 1919 attack by Muslim forces, monks were executed by burning. Bodies were left strewn around Labrang by Hui troops. Ma Qi besieged Labrang numerous times. Tibetans fought against his Hui forces for control of Labrang until Ma Qi gave it up in 1927. However, that was not the last Labrang saw of General Ma. Ma Qi launched a genocidal war against the Goloks in 1928, inflicting a defeat upon them and seizing Labrang Monastery. The Hui forces looted and ravaged the monastery again. The Austrian American explorer Joseph Rock encountered the aftermath of one of the Ma clique's campaigns against Labrang. The Ma army left Tibetan skeletons scattered over a wide area and Labrang Monastery was decorated with decapitated Tibetan heads. After the 1929 battle of Xiahe near Labrang, decapitated Tibetan heads were used as ornaments by Hui troops in their camp, 154 in total. Rock described \\"young girls and children\\"'s heads staked around the military encampment. Ten to fifteen heads were fastened to the saddle of every Muslim cavalryman. The heads were \\"strung about the walls of the Moslem garrison like a garland of flowers.\\" Recent events During the Tibetan uprising anniversary in March 2008, riot police surrounded Labrang monastery and military units blocked roads to keep local people from gaining access to the monastery. Monks were prevented from leaving by Chinese security forces and held under arrest. Footnotes References *Cabot, Mabel H. (2003).

Its studios are located at the Place St. Charles building in Downtown New Orleans and its transmitter is located in Vacherie, Louisiana. History =As WCKW= The station signed on the air in 1966 as WCKW. During its first 29 years of its existence, its previous formats included country, classic rock, active rock, all-1980s, adult contemporary (including a rebrand from \\"The Point\\" to \\"Lite 92.3\\" on November 4, 2003),http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2003/RR-2003-11-07.pdf and adult top 40. =As WDVW= \\"Diva 92.3\\" On November 18, 2004, WCKW 'unveiled' the \\"Diva\\" format and changed its call letters to WDVW, playing mostly rhythmic pop, classic Disco and Dance music from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. From 2005 to 2007, WDVW was also a reporter to the Billboard Magazine Dance/Mix Show Airplay panel. When it debuted with the format, its slogan was \\"Music For The Diva In You\\", a reference to the female audience it targeted and the high quotient of female artists on its playlist. But despite the name and slogan, it also attracted males as well. In September 2005, they would later change the slogan to \\"New Orleans' New #1 Feel Good Station!\\" The reason for that was to bring music and normality back to the area after Hurricane Katrina struck. They were also the first radio station in the market to resume regular music programming after the disaster ended. WDVW was one of two \\"Divas\\" in Louisiana. Its sister station in Baton Rouge, WCDV (Diva 103.3), was the other, although WDVW can also be heard in that area as well. But on September 18, 2006, WCDV returned to an Adult Contemporary direction, a move that might have made sense due to the overlapping of two \\"Divas\\" in Baton Rouge, which hurt WCDV ratings wise. former \\"Mix 92.3\\" logo \\"Mix 92.3\\" On December 20, 2007, WDVW switched directions to adult top 40 for its second go-round, this time as \\"Mix 92.3.\\" The station has dropped most of the Dance fare in favor of current Hot AC product, with recurrents from the 1980s and 1990s and a modern-leaning direction. The station never produced impressive ratings, and given New Orleans' reception toward Hot AC/Adult Top 40 in the past, most notably WLTS, this format has never performed well in this market. =As WRKN= On July 23, 2010, at approximately 2:50 p.m., after playing \\"Need You Now\\" by Lady Antebellum, the station began stunting with Mardi Gras-themed music. At 4:00 p.m., the station became \\"Rock 92-3,\\" using the slogan \\"New Orleans' Rock Station\\", and adopting their current callsign WRKN.

Hereditarians believe in the power of genetics to explain human character traits and solve human social and political problems. Hereditarians adopt the view that an understanding of human evolution can extend the understanding of human nature. They have avowedly rejected the standard social science model. Biologists and geneticists predominantly consider human behavior and psychology to derive from the interaction of genes and environment.  Competing theories  Theories opposed to hereditarianism include behaviorism, social determinism and environmental determinism. This disagreement and controversy is part of the nature versus nurture debate. But both are based on the assumption that genes and environment have large independent effects. The dominant view outside psychology among biologists and geneticists is that both of these are gross oversimplifications and that the behavioral/psychological phenotype for human beings is determined by a function of genes and environment which cannot be decomposed into a sum of functions of the two independently. And this especially because human behavior is uniquely plastic compared to that of other animals. The commonly cited heritability, h2, is meaningful only in the context of the independent effects model. This model may be a good approximation to the real function given that the range of genomes and the range of environments is sufficiently narrow, e.g., white upper middle class Americans living in Chicago. Ronald C. Bailey argues that hereditarianism is based on five fallacious assumptions. In a 1997 paper, he also wrote that \\"...behavior geneticists will continue to be very limited in their ability to partition the effects of genes, the environment, and their covariance and interaction on human behavior and cognitive ability.\\" Hereditarianism is sometimes used as a synonym for biological or genetic determinism, though some scholars distinguish the two terms. When distinguished, biological determinism is used to mean that heredity is the only factor. Supporters of hereditarianism reject this sense of biological determinism for most cases. However, in some cases genetic determinism is true; for example, Matt Ridley describes Huntington's disease as \\"pure fatalism, undiluted by environmental variability\\". In other cases, hereditarians would see no role for genes; for example, the condition of \\"not knowing a word of Chinese\\" has nothing to do (directly) with genes.  Political implications  In 1949, Nicolas Pastore claimed that hereditarians were more likely to be conservative, that they view social and economic inequality as a natural result of variation in talent and character. Consequently, they explain class and race differences as the result of partly genetic group differences. Pastore contrasted this with the claim that behaviorists were more likely to be liberals or leftists, that they believe economic disadvantage and structural problems in the social order were to blame for group differences. However, the historical correspondence between hereditarianism and conservatism has broken down at least among proponents of hereditarianism. Philosopher Peter Singer describes his vision of a new liberal political view that embraces hereditarianism in his 1999 book, A Darwinian Left.

State Route 317 is also known as Bonny Oaks Drive, Volkswagen Drive, Apison Pike, Wesleyan Road, and Weatherley Switch Road SE; It was formerly known as Old Lee Highway. It dead ends into State Route 60 in Bradley County. In Chattanooga, this road crosses State Route 58. History In between Chattanooga and Collegedale SR 317 formerly went along Old Lee Highway to Apison Pike. It has been since rerouted with the completion of the Volkswagen Drive exit on I-75. It now joins I-75 at exits 7 A and B and runs concurrently with I-75 to exit 9, where SR 317 turns along Volkswagen Drive to Apison Pike. TDOT is working to widen and improve the Apison Pike section of SR 317, located between I-75 and SR 320 (East Brainerd Road) in four separate phases. Phase 1 consisted of constructing a new five-lane (including two-way left turn lane) road between I-75 and Old Lee Highway, part of the relocated section of SR 317. Phase 2, which took place between January 2015 and September 13, 2017, widened the segment between Old Lee Highway and SR 321 (Ooltewah-Ringgold Road) from two to five lanes at a cost of $24.2 million. Phase 3, which began on March 13, 2020 and is expected to be completed by June 2025, is the most complex and expensive phase, at a cost of $93.1 million. It involves widening the route from two to five lanes between SR 321 and Layton Lane, and will consist of an entirely new alignment in some places. Phase 4, the final phase, will widen SR 317 between Layton Lane and SR 320.

Uniformization of relation R (light blue) by function f (red). To see the relationship with the axiom of choice, observe that R can be thought of as associating, to each element of X, a subset of Y. A uniformization of R then picks exactly one element from each such subset, whenever the subset is non- empty. Thus, allowing arbitrary sets X and Y (rather than just Polish spaces) would make the axiom of uniformization equivalent to the axiom of choice. A pointclass \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma} is said to have the uniformization property if every relation R in \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma} can be uniformized by a partial function in \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma}. The uniformization property is implied by the scale property, at least for adequate pointclasses of a certain form.

Typical for Viennese Coffee Houses are marble tabletops, Thonet chairs, newspaper tables and interior design details in the style of Historicism.Intangible Cultural Heritage in Austria: Viennese Coffee House Culture The Austrian writer Stefan Zweig described the Viennese Coffee House as an institution of a special kind, \\"actually a sort of democratic club, open to everyone for the price of a cheap cup of coffee, where every guest can sit for hours with this little offering, to talk, write, play cards, receive post, and above all consume an unlimited number of newspapers and journals.\\"Robert Edward Norton: Secret Germany: Stefan George and his circle (Google books) Zweig in fact attributed a good measure of Vienna's cosmopolitan air to the rich daily diet of current and international information offered in the coffee houses. In many classic caf√©s (for example Caf√© Central and Caf√© Pr√ºckel) piano music is played in the evening and social events like literary readings are held. In warmer months, customers can often sit outside in a Schanigarten. Almost all coffee houses provide small food dishes like sausages as well as desserts, cakes and tarts, like Apfelstrudel, Millirahmstrudel, Punschkrapfen and Linzer torte. Unlike some other caf√© traditions around the world, it is completely normal for a customer to linger alone for hours and study the omnipresent newspaper. Along with coffee, the waiter will serve an obligatory glass of cold tap water and during a long stay will often bring additional water unrequested, with the idea to serve the guest with an exemplary sense of attention. In the late 19th and early 20th century, leading writers of the time became attached to the atmosphere of Viennese caf√©s and were frequently seen to meet, exchange and to even write there. Literature composed in caf√©s is commonly referred to as coffee house literature, the writers thereof as coffee house poets. The famous journal Die Fackel (\\"The Torch\\") by Karl Kraus is said to have been written in caf√©s to a large extent. Other coffee house poets include Arthur Schnitzler, Alfred Polgar, Friedrich Torberg, and Egon Erwin Kisch. Famous writer and poet Peter Altenberg even had his mail delivered to his favorite caf√©, the Caf√© Central. File:Einspaenner.jpgEinsp√§nner Coffee: A viennese specialty. It is a strong black coffee served in a glass topped with whipped cream, it comes with powder sugar served separately.  History  Caf√© Schwarzenberg in Vienna Caf√© Dommayer in Vienna Legend has it that soldiers of the Polish-Habsburg army, while liberating Vienna from the second Turkish siege in 1683, found a number of sacks with strange beans that they initially thought were camel feed and wanted to burn. The Polish king Jan III Sobieski granted the sacks to one of his officers named Jerzy Franciszek Kulczycki, who started the first coffee house. This story was published by the Catholic Priest Gottfried Uhlich in 1783 in his History of the second Turkish Siege, and he took some liberties. In reality, Kulczycki's coffee house missed being the first by more than a year. A more factual account has been reported by Karl Teply.Karl Teply: The introduction of coffee in Vienna. Georg Franz Koltschitzky. Johannes Diodato. Isaac de Luca. In: Society for History of the City of Vienna; Felix Czeike (ed.): research and contributions to the Viennese city's history. 6, Kommissionsverlag Youth and Culture, Vienna - Munich 1980 (208 pages, 15 illustrations After some experimentation, the legend goes on, Kulczycki added some sugar and milk, and the Viennese coffee tradition was born. This achievement has been recognized in many modern Viennese coffeehouses by hanging a picture of Kulczycki in the window. Another account is that Kulczycki, having spent two years in Ottoman captivity, knew perfectly well what coffee really was and tricked his superiors into granting him the beans that were considered worthless.Krystyna Bockenheim, Przy polskim stole, Wroclaw 2003, p. 69 According to recent research, Vienna's first coffee house was in fact opened by an Armenian businessman named Johannes Diodato in 1685. 15 years later, four Greek owned coffeehouses had the privilege to serve coffee.Teply, Karl: Die Einf√ºhrung des Kaffees in Wien.

In the early period, the various drinks had no names, and customers would select the mixtures from a colour-shaded chart. The heyday of the coffee house was the turn of the nineteenth century when writers like Peter Altenberg, Alfred Polgar, Egon Friedell, Karl Kraus, Hermann Broch and Friedrich Torberg made them their preferred place of work and pleasure. Many famous artists, scientists, and politicians of the period such as Arthur Schnitzler, Stefan Zweig, Egon Schiele, Gustav Klimt, Adolf Loos, Theodor Herzl, Alfred Adler,Hoffman, E. (1994). The Drive for Self: Alfred Adler and the founding of Individual Psychology. Reading, MA: Addison Wesley, pp. 52, 77, 85-86, 101 and even Leon Trotsky were constant coffee house patrons. In Prague, Budapest, Krakow, and Lviv and other cities of the Austro-Hungarian empire there were also many coffee houses according to the Viennese model. In the 1950s, the period of \\"coffee house death\\" began, as many famous Viennese coffee houses had to close. This was due to the popularity of television and the appearance of modern espresso bars. Nevertheless, many of these classic Viennese coffee houses still exist. A renewed interest in their tradition and tourism have prompted a comeback. Some relatively modern Viennese coffee houses have emerged in North America, such as Julius Meinl Chicago and Kaffeehaus de Ch√¢tillon in the greater Seattle area and Cafe Sabarsky in Manhattan.

A delivery or ball in cricket is a single action of bowling a cricket ball toward the batsman. During play of the game, a member of the fielding team is designated as the bowler, and bowls deliveries toward the batsman. Six legal balls in a row constitutes an over, after which a different member of the fielding side takes over the role of bowler for the next over. The bowler delivers the ball from their end of the pitch toward the batsman standing at the opposite wicket at the other end of the pitch. Bowlers can be either left- handed or right-handed. This approach to their delivery, in addition to their decision of bowling around the wicket (from the sides of the wicket on the bowler's end) or over the wicket, is knowledge of which the umpire and the batsman are to be made aware. Every delivery in a cricket match is notated as \\"Over # [number of completed overs].[number of legal balls bowled, including the delivery in question, in current over]\\"; this means that a set of deliveries can have the same notation if they happened consecutively and at most the final one was legal. Types of delivery Deliveries can be made by fast bowlers or by spin bowlers. Fast bowlers tend to make the ball either move off the pitch (‚Äòseam‚Äô) or move through the air (‚Äôswing‚Äô), while spinners make the ball ‚Äôturn‚Äô either toward a right-handed batsman (as in the case of off spin and left-arm unorthodox spin) or away from him (as in the case of leg spin and left-arm orthodox spin). The ball can bounce at different distances from the batsman, this is called the length of the delivery. It can range from a bouncer (often bouncing as high as the batsman's head) to a yorker (landing at his feet). There are many different types of delivery that a bowler can bowl. These deliveries vary by: technique, the hand the bowler bowls with, use of the fingers, use of the seam, how the ball is positioned in the hand, where the ball is pitched on the wicket, the speed of the ball, and the tactical intent of the bowler. *Leg spin deliveries and mirror equivalents for left arm unorthodox spin: ** Leg break ** Googly ** Topspinner ** Flicker ball ** Slider ** Flipper * Off spin deliveries and mirror equivalents for left arm orthodox spin: ** Off break ** Doosra ** Topspinner ** Carrom ball ** Arm ball ** Teesra * Fast bowling deliveries: ** Bouncer ** Inswinger ** Reverse swing ** Leg cutter ** Off cutter ** Outswinger ** Yorker ** Beamer (illegal) **Knuckleball **Slower ball Tactical considerations The variations in different types of delivery, as well as variations caused by directing the ball with differing line and length, are key weapons in a bowler's arsenal. Throughout an over, the bowler will choose a sequence of deliveries designed to attack the batsman's concentration and technique, in an effort to get him out. The bowler also varies the amount of loop and pace imparted to various deliveries to try to cause the batsman to misjudge and make a mistake. As the crease has a width, the bowler can change the angle from which he delivers to the batsman in an attempt to induce a misjudgement. Usually, the bowler decides what type of delivery to bowl next, without consultation or even informing any other member of his team. Sometimes, the team captain will offer advice or even issue a direct order regarding what deliveries to bowl, based on his observations of the batsman and the strategic state of the game. Another player who occasionally offers advice to the bowler is the wicket- keeper, since he has a unique view of the batsman and may be able to spot weaknesses of technique. Another piece of information important for the bowlers to consider prior to their deliveries is the state of pitch. The pitch is a natural ground and its state is subjected to variation over the course of the cricket, some of which are multi-day events such as test matches. Spinners find an old pitch, one that has been frequently used, more suitable to their deliveries rather than a fresh pitch, one that has not come under use as much such as a pitch at the start of the match. =The batsman's anticipation of the delivery= While a bowler, with the use of variations in their delivery aims to target the concentration of batsmen as well as their skill and technique of batting, anticipation of the delivery is crucial for the batsman, as emphasised by Jodi Richardson. Richardson reveals the world class batsman's dilemma while facing fast bowlers, stating that the time between the batsmen's anticipation of the trajectory of the ball and positioning themselves for the appropriate shot can be twice as long as the interval between the ball leaving the bowler's hand and reaching the batsman's crease. Side by side, Richardson alludes to the research undertaken by Dr. Sean M√ºller in Australia which was partly funded by Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence. The results of the research demonstrated the importance of anticipation of the delivery for batsmen in cricket. They revealed that experienced batsmen possessed a unique ability which enabled them to adjust their feet as well as their positioning on the crease accordingly based upon their reading of the body language and movements enacted by the bowler prior to the release of the ball. This foresight that batsmen use while on the crease is referred to as 'advance information' by Richardson. Moreover, M√ºller's research outlined that the presence of this 'advance information' was not as evident among the lesser skilled batsmen in comparison to the experienced ones. Controversies and debate involving deliveries =Underarm bowling= Underarm or lob bowling was the original cricket delivery style, but had largely died out before the 20th century, although it was used until 1910 by George Simpson-Hayward, and remained a legal delivery type. On 1 February 1981, when Australia was playing New Zealand in a One Day International cricket match, and New Zealand needed six runs to tie the match from the final ball. Greg Chappell, the Australian captain, ordered the bowler (his brother Trevor) to bowl underarm, rolling the ball along the ground to prevent the Number 10 New Zealand batsman (Brian McKechnie) any chance of hitting a six from the last ball to tie the match. After the game, the then Prime Minister of New Zealand, Rob Muldoon, described it as \\"the most disgusting incident I can recall in the history of cricket.\\" At the time, underarm deliveries were legal, but as a direct result of the incident, underarm bowling was banned in limited overs cricket by the International Cricket Council as \\"not within the spirit of the game.\\" The 2000 Code of the Laws of Cricket declares that an underarm delivery is illegal unless otherwise agreed before the match.Laws of Cricket #24 re no ball =Suspect bowling actions= A recently retired cricketer who was greatly embroiled in controversy and under scrutiny from critics over his method of executing deliveries was the Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan. Michael Selvey describes the accusations placed on the bowler in relation to his widely disputed bowling action and delivery, stating the Australian prime minister's reference to the Sri Lankan as a 'chucker.' The controversy linked to Muralitharan's delivery emerged in 1995, when the umpire of the test match between Sri Lanka and Australia deemed Muralitharan's delivery as illegal on the suspicion that he was throwing the ball. Selvey acknowledges this as the factor sparking an 'international cricket incident,' with critics and some extremists going as far as insisting on the exclusion of all of the Sri Lankan's accomplishments throughout his career from the records of cricket. However, Suresh Menon takes an adamant stance on the topic of the controversy surrounding the spinner by displaying appreciation for Muralitharan's actions. Menon suggests that investigation into Muralitharan's deliveries led to the revelation of imperfections present in the bowling action and deliveries of the previously considered 'picture-perfect' fast bowler, Glenn McGrath. This was made possible with the usage of technology and its replacement of the earlier system, which Menon refers to as 'the naked eye.' Eventually, it was declared legal for the bowlers to bend their arm fifteen degrees for deliveries in cricket. Comparison to baseball A delivery or ball in cricket is analogous to a pitch in baseball. The word ball in cricket usage does not imply anything about the accuracy of the delivery, unlike baseball's usage of ball to indicate a pitch outside the strike zone. The cricket equivalent of a baseball ball is a wide or a no-ball.

Parliament Hill is an area of open parkland in the south-east corner of Hampstead Heath in north-west London. The hill, which is high, is notable for its views of the capital's skyline. The Houses of Parliament, which are south of Parliament Hill in the City of Westminster, can be seen from the summit, although construction in the intermediate parts of London has partly obscured them. History A mound on the hill may have been a Bronze Age burial barrow. In 1133, the hill was part of a manor that Henry I gave to a baron called Richard de Balta. During Henry II's reign it was passed to Alexander de Barentyn, the king's butler. The area that was known as Traitors' Hill, may have acquired its current name during the English Civil War in the 17th century. When it was occupied by troops loyal to the English Parliament. A legend states that this was the site from where Guy Fawkes and Robert Catesby, of the Gunpowder Plot on November the 5th 1605, planned to watch the destruction of Parliament.http://www.shadyoldlady.com/location.php?loc=915 Over time, plots of land in the manor were sold off for building, particularly in the early 19th century, though the hill remained mainly common land.

The cottage was constructed in 1755 in the English village of Great Ayton, North Yorkshire, by the parents of Captain James Cook, James and Grace Cook,The Captain Cook Society: Cook's Log, page 212, volume 6, number 3 (1983). and was brought to Melbourne in 1934 by Sir Russell Grimwade. It is a point of conjecture among historians whether James Cook, the famous navigator, ever lived in the house, but almost certainly he visited his parents at the house. The inside of the cottage includes centuries-old antiques and is stylised in the way of the 18th century, as are the clothes of the volunteer guides. History In 1933 the owner of the cottage decided to sell it with a condition of sale that the building remain in England. She was persuaded to change \\"England\\" to \\"the Empire\\", and accepted an Australian bid of ¬£800, by Russell Grimwade, as opposed to the highest local offer of ¬£300. The cottage was deconstructed brick by brick and packed into 253 cases and 40 barrels for shipping on board the Port Dunedin from Hull. Cuttings from ivy that adorned the house were also taken and planted when the house was re-erected in Melbourne. Grimwade, a notable businessman and philanthropist, donated the house to the people of Victoria for the centenary anniversary of the settlement of Melbourne in October 1934. The cottage immediately became a popular tourist attraction. In 1978 further restoration work was carried out on the cottage. An English cottage garden has been established around the house, further adding to its period reconstruction. Very few of the items in the house are from the Cook family, but all are representative furnishings of the period.

A member of the Republican Party, he was the Texas Land Commissioner from 1999 to 2003. Dewhurst was a candidate in 2012 for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the retiring Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison, but he lost his party's runoff election to former Solicitor General Ted Cruz, who went on to win the general election. Dewhurst was a candidate for a fourth four-year term in the Republican runoff election held on May 27, 2014. He was handily unseated by his intraparty rival and fellow Houstonian State Senator Dan Patrick who also led the primary balloting with 550,769 votes (41.5 percent). Dewhurst trailed with 376,196 votes (28.3 percent). Eliminated in the primary were Texas Commissioner of Agriculture Todd Staples with 235,981 votes (17.8 percent) and Texas Land Commissioner Jerry E. Patterson with 165,787 (12.5 percent). Patterson had succeeded Dewhurst as land commissioner in 2002 when Dewhurst was first elected as lieutenant governor. On a night of \\"embarrassingly low\\" voter turnout (approximately 4% of registered voters), the incumbent finished with only 262,086 votes (34.9 percent), compared to Patrick's 487,829 (65.1 percent). Dewhurst's third term as lieutenant governor ended on January 20, 2015. He currently serves as an advisory board member at the United States Secretary of Energy led by former Governor Rick Perry who was appointed by President Donald Trump in 2017. Personal life Dewhurst's father, David Dewhurst Jr., was a World War II pilot of a Martin B-26 Marauder of the 553d Fighter-Bomber Squadron. On D-Day, flying over Cotentin peninsula in the \\"Dinah Might\\", he led a squadron bombing German positions on Utah Beach. After the war, David Dewhurst Jr. was killed by a drunk driver, leaving behind his wife and his two sons, David and Eugene. Both brothers visited the Utah Beach Museum on June 7, 2007 and discovered an exhibit detailing their father's mission on D-Day. Moved, the Dewhurst brothers contributed millions of dollars for the extension of the museum, allowing it to purchase a B-26 Marauder and to open a new building.\\"PPG Aerospace coatings capture colors of World War II bomber.\\" Paint and Coatings Industry.

Dewhurst is a businessman, a rancher, and a community leader in Houston, where he has served on civic and charitable boards. He graduated from Lamar High School in Houston\\"Distinguished HISD Alumni ,\\" Houston Independent School District and earned his bachelor's degree and played basketball at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona, where he was a brother of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. There he received a BA in English with a minor in history. Lacking the eyesight to become a pilot like his father, Dewhurst became an intelligence officer in the U.S. Air Force and then an officer of the Central Intelligence Agency, and the United States State Department. During his years in the CIA, Dewhurst was stationed in Bolivia, arriving shortly before the coup against leftist president Juan Jos√© Torres. In 1981, Dewhurst and Ted Law re-established Falcon Seaboard, a Texas- based diversified energy and investments company in Houston that Law had founded in 1935. The company quickly made Dewhurst a millionaire, but collapsed just as quickly, going into bankruptcy. Dewhurst then went into business constructing cogeneration plants, which proved to be a tremendous success. In 1996, the company sold its plants for $226 million, and in 2011, Dewhurst was worth an estimated $200 million. In 1995, Dewhurst married Tammy Jo Hopkins, a 32-year-old model. After she pled no contest to driving while intoxicated in 1999, the couple announced that she would seek full-time help for alcohol abuse. The couple divorced in 2000.Robert Bryce. \\"Weird, Spooky, and Rich.\\" The Austin Chronicle.

He breeds registered Black Angus cattle and once competed in National Cutting Horse Association competitions. He also speaks Spanish. Political career =Land Commissioner= Dewhurst was elected as Commissioner of the General Land Office of Texas in 1998, when the 16-year incumbent, Garry Mauro, waged an unsuccessful campaign for governor against George W. Bush. Dewhurst was opposed in the general election by Democratic State Representative Richard Raymond, then of Benavides and thereafter of Laredo. Dewhurst described himself as a \\"George Bush Republican\\" and drew on his personal wealth to spend a record $8 million on his run for office (previous candidates for land commissioner had generally spent only $1 million).Saul Elbein. \\"The Extra-Lite Gov.\\" Texas Observer. October 28, 2010. Accessed April 6, 2018. The campaign was a bitter one, in which Dewhurst's Republican primary opponent, Jerry E. Patterson, accused Dewhurst of trying to bribe him to leave the race, and Raymond unsuccessfully accused him of embezzlement.S. C. Gwynne. \\"Lonesome Cowboy.\\" Texas Monthly. June 2002.

In that campaign, Dewhurst stressed his interest in public education and opposition to school vouchers. He again outspent his opponent significantly with a $9 million campaign. Dewhurst polled 2,341,875 votes (51.77 percent) to Sharp's 2,082,281 (46.03 percent).Natalie Gott. \\"Dewhurst defeats Sharp in lieutenant governor's race\\". Plainview Daily. November 5, 2002. Accessed April 6, 2018.Two minor candidates polled the remaining 2.19 percent. Dewhurst succeeded Bill Ratliff. (Ratliff did not contest the lieutenant governor's position in the primary, opting instead for re-election to his state senate seat.) Summarizing Dewhurst's first term, The New York Times wrote, \\"Amid low expectations, Mr. Dewhurst surprised many that first session, helping to steer a major tort-reform package and cutting the budget while earning the respect of his colleagues as a burgeoning team player.\\" However, the paper also noted that he \\"frequently frustrated senators from both parties for not appearing to hold firm in negotiations with the House or with [Gov. Rick] Perry.\\"Aman Batheja. \\"The Dewhurst Legacy: Skilled Politician or Pushover?\\" '\\"The New York Times. April 28, 2012. Accessed April 6, 2018. 2006 election Dewhurst was renominated for lieutenant governor in the Republican primary held on March 7, 2006. He defeated Tom Kelly, the same candidate whom he bested for the nomination in 2002. In the November 7, 2006, general election, Dewhurst overwhelmed Democrat Maria Luisa Alvarado, a veterans issues research analyst and the winner of her April 11 runoff primary. He received 2,512,197 votes (58.2 percent) to Alvarado's 1,616,945 (37.4 percent). Libertarian Judy A. Baker polled another 188,956 votes (4.4 percent). 2010 election Dewhurst filed for Lt. Governor of Texas in the 2010 election. It was widely assumed that he would run for United States Senate if Kay Bailey Hutchison had resigned. He was his party's nominee for a third term as lieutenant governor and faced Democrat Linda Chavez- Thompson, Libertarian Scott Jameson, and Green Party Herb Gonzales, Jr. in the November 2, 2010, general election. He was re-elected to a third term on November 2, 2010, having polled 3,044,770 votes (61.80 percent) to the Democrat Linda Chavez-Thompson's 1,715,735 votes (34.82 percent) and took office on January 18, 2011 for a third four-year term, becoming the second Texas Lieutenant Governor to be elected to three four-year terms since Bill Hobby, who held the office for 18 years for five terms. 2014 election Dewhurst and Patrick faced each other in the May 27 runoff election for lieutenant governor. The winner would eventually run in the general election against Democratic State Senator Leticia Van de Putte of San Antonio, who was the Democratic nominee for the lieutenant governorship. During the runoff, Dewhurst released a disco-themed advertisement Lt. Gov. You've Gotta Love and a parody of Let It Go from the Disney film Frozen. On May 27, 2014, Patrick easily defeated Dewhurst in a landslide: 65% to 35%.Fernandez, Manny (May 27, 2014) ‚Äì \\"Lieutenant Governor Loses Texas Runoff as Tea Party Holds Sway\\". The New York Times. Retrieved January 24, 2015. Patrick said after state Senator Wendy Davis of Fort Worth (who was the Democratic nominee for governor) filibustered the bill to ban late-term abortions in Texas that Dewhurst has \\"lost his grip on the reins of the Senate\\". Patrick called for new leadership in the chamber.\\"Dewhurst: Bill won't fail again\\", Laredo Morning Times, June 30, 2013, p. 16A Polling by the University of Texas at Austin and The Texas Tribune had showed Dewhurst leading his opponents in the primary with 26 percent of the vote, to Patrick's 13 percent, Patterson's 10 percent and Staples' 5 percent. At the time, 46 percent of voters were reported as undecided. Prior to the runoff election against Patrick, Dewhurst joined Governor Rick Perry in calling for a \\"surge operation\\" beginning September 1, 2014, of aircraft and boats on the Mexican border to thwart smuggling and crimes by the drug cartel. House Speaker Joe Straus eventually committed to the surge and is currently underway, affirming Dewhurst's claim from an earlier debate with Patrick, in which he claimed to have Straus' support for the coming surge. The Texas Department of Public Safety still retains the authority to send troopers and equipment to the border without approval from the legislature if the director sees fit to do so.David Salen Rauf, \\"Border Operation: Plan hits snag, Laredo Morning Times, May 22, 2014, pp. 1, 9A =2003 redistricting= In 2003, Dewhurst assisted the Republican leadership, including then U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, Texas House Speaker Tom Craddick, and Governor Rick Perry, in passing a sweeping congressional redistricting bill that increased the number of Republican U.S. House seats in Texas from fifteen to twenty-one in the 2004 elections. The Republican seats dropped to nineteen in the 2006 elections under a modified court redistricting plan. Minority Democrats retain thirteen U.S. House seats from Texas. In his capacity as the presiding officer of the Texas Senate, Dewhurst, in the third consecutive special session called by the governor, allowed the suspension of the custom that two thirds of the body must vote to consider a bill. Dewhurst's leadership on redistricting brought him into legal conflict with his former land commissioner opponent, Richard Raymond, the only elected official to have been a plaintiff in the 2006 U.S. Supreme Court review of the constitutionality of the redistricting plan. Dewhurst and Raymond have also sparred over education policy. =Legislation= Childhood legislation He is known by his \\"Texas Children First\\" initiative with more severe consequences for child sexual predators in Texas and throughout the United States. The initiative includes extending statute of limitations on child sex crimes and leading the passage of Jessica's Law. The bill was signed into law by Texas Governor Rick Perry but the death penalty for second-time child rapists was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. TSA inspection bill Dewhurst was accused by state senator Dan Patrick of helping to stop a bill, the passage of which would have been an attempt to make the pat downs of airplane passengers by personnel of the U.S. Transportation Security Agency (TSA) a felony in Texas. =Controversies= Condemnation of school stage play In March 2010, a student performance of the play Corpus Christi by Terrence McNally, in which Jesus and the disciples are portrayed as being gay, was canceled at Tarleton State University in Stephenville, Texas following a condemnatory statement by Dewhurst. The university had received many complaints about the play's scheduled performance as a class project for a directing class, but in a letter posted on the university's website on March 11, President F. Dominic Dottavio, citing freedom of speech, declared that the play would be performed.Letter by F. Dominic Dottavio posted on Tarleton State website The day before the performance, Dewhurst issued his statement saying, \\"No one should have the right to use government funds or institutions to portray acts that are morally reprehensible to the vast majority of Americans,\\" and the performance was cancelled by the professor, who cited safety concerns. A subsequent statement by Dewhurst praised the university for canceling the performance, whereas the professor claimed to have acted on his own. Dewhurst's statement also claimed that whereas he is \\"a strong defender of free speech, we must also protect the rights and reasonable expectations of Texas taxpayers and how their money is used. A play that is completely contrary to the standards of decency and moral beliefs of the vast majority of Texans should not be performed using any state resources, especially by an institution of higher learning.\\"Play‚Äôs cancellation ‚Äòright thing to do,‚Äô Dewhurst says Ralph K.M.

He tells a police sergeant that Ellen Bevers, his stepsister's daughter-in-law, is a schoolteacher and \\"the sweetest woman in the world\\", and says he's sure she has been incarcerated on a \\"mistaken charge\\". Although, the next day the Allen Police Department publicly stated that Dewhurst did nothing illegal or out of the ordinary for a family member. 2012 United States Senate race On July 18, 2011, Dewhurst addressed his supporters in an online video on his campaign website, announcing his candidacy for the vacant U.S. Senate seat for the Republican nomination. His rivals included former Mayor of Dallas Tom Leppert, ESPN college football analyst Craig James and former state Solicitor General Ted Cruz, the eventual nominee. After a year-long campaign for the Republican nomination, Dewhurst lost to Cruz in a run-off on July 31, 2012. Cruz then won the seat in the general election against Democrat Paul Sadler of Henderson.

It is a pyridylallylamine, and is structurally different from other antidepressants. Zimelidine was developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s by Arvid Carlsson, who was then working for the Swedish company Astra AB. It was discovered following a search for drugs with structures similar to brompheniramine (it is a derivative of brompheniramine), an antihistamine with antidepressant activity. Zimelidine was first sold in 1982. While zimelidine had a very favorable safety profile, within a year and a half of its introduction, rare case reports of Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome emerged that appeared to be caused by the drug, prompting its manufacturer to withdraw it from the market. After its withdrawal, it was succeeded by fluvoxamine and fluoxetine (derived from the antihistamine diphenhydramine) in that order, and the other SSRIs. Mechanism of action The mode of action is a strong reuptake inhibition of serotonin from the synaptic cleft. Postsynaptic receptors are not acted upon. Other uses Zimelidine was reported by Montplaisir and Godbout to be very effective for cataplexy in 1986, back when this was usually controlled by tricyclic antidepressants, which often had anticholinergic effects. Zimelidine was able to improve cataplexy without causing daytime sleepiness.

Gameplay The player controls a craft on a horizontal perspective going to the right. Enemies can approach from in front, from behind, from below or from above. They can be either lone flyers or formation ships. The maps have a linear quality in which enemies and power-ups appear at the same time and the same place, as is common with side-scrolling shooters. Gameplay is notably differentiated by high numbers of enemies and power-ups. Plot The game has two separate storylines; those being the one described in the official playing manual included with the CD-ROM copy and the one which is found on the 3D Realms/Apogee website and portrayed in the game itself. Development The game was programmed in the C++ language. The artwork was done on a Commodore Amiga computer using Deluxe Paint. Release According to David Pevreal Apogee had originally intended to do an Amiga version of the game first and then port it to PC, but those plans were scrapped and only the PC version was released.

It was purchased by pilot-entrepreneur Aubrey Kinzer in 1969 and turned into a commercial venture with a flight school, rental aircraft, and aircraft maintenance. In 1972, the City of Collegedale obtained the property, and over the years the asphalt paved runway has been extended to 4,700 feet (1400 m) from its nominal 3,500-foot (1150 m) length and widened to 75 feet (23 m) with a parallel taxiway. In 1995, the airport was rededicated and renamed Linn Field in honor of John Linn. Renovations and additions to the terminal, lobby, and Fixed-Base Operations (FBO) office were completed in 2003.  Facilities and aircraft  Collegedale Municipal Airport covers an area of 145 acres (59 ha) at an elevation of 860 feet (262 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 3/21 with an asphalt surface measuring 5,003 by 75 feet (1,525 x 23 m). For the 12-month period ending September 30, 2011, the airport had 14,500 aircraft operations, an average of 39 per day: 97% general aviation and 3% air taxi. At that time there were 101 aircraft based at this airport: 92% single-engine, 4% multi- engine, 2% helicopter, and 2% ultralight. The airport offers rental and maintenance services and is open every day from 8:30 a.m. until 5:30 p.m, except for Thanks Giving, Christmas, a half day on Christmas Eve, and New Years Day.

Details  Packet writing allows users to create, modify, and delete files and directories on demand without the need to burn a whole disc. Packet writing technology achieves this by writing data in incremental blocks rather than in a single block. Deleting files and directories of a CD-R using packet writing technology does not recover the space occupied by these objects but, rather, they are simply marked as being deleted (making them effectively hidden). Similarly, changes to files cause new instances to be created instead of replacing the original files. Because of this, the available space on a non-rewritable medium using packet writing technology will decrease every time its content is modified. The most common file system for packet writing systems is UDF. Due to the characteristics of optical rewritable media such as CD-RWs and DVD-RWs, the ability of data sectors to hold their contents diminishes when changing them frequently (since re-crystallized alloy de- crystallizes). To cope with this the packet writing system can remap bad sectors with good sectors as required.

Born in Shanghai, she was a highly ranked player in China before she moved to Singapore with her husband, Singaporean table tennis player Loy Soo Han, whom she married in 1992. She represented Singapore in sporting events starting in the 1990s, and was naturalized as a Singaporean citizen in 1994. After retiring as a player, she served as deputy head coach, then as head coach, of the women's national table tennis team, before being reassigned to leading the country's table tennis youth development program in late 2015. Early life Jing Junhong was born in Shanghai, China on 13 October 1968, the child of a teacher and an engineer. Jing was trained in table tennis in China after being spotted at the age of eight, and by 1988 she had become the nation's third ranked women's table tennis player. That year, she met Singaporean table tennis player Loy Soo Han, who was attending a long-term training program. Jing and Loy were married in 1992, and Jing moved to Singapore that year, with the intention of retiring from table tennis. She became a naturalized citizen of Singapore in 1994. In 1998, she had a son, Meng Huen (Darren), who as of 2012 was also training to represent Singapore in table tennis. Playing career By 1992, Jing was representing Singapore at international table tennis competitions. Her first event representing Singapore was that year's Vietnam Golden Racket Championships, which she won. The following year, Jing was selected to represent Singapore at the 1993 World Table Tennis Championships in Gothenburg, Sweden. At the event, she beat then top ranked player and Olympic champion Deng Yaping of China. In 1995, Jing represented Singapore at the Commonwealth Table Tennis Championships, where she took second behind Hong Kong's Chai Po Wa, and at the 1995 Southeast Asian Games. At the Southeast Asian Games, she won the singles and mixed doubles events, and came in second in the women's doubles event. Jing represented Singapore in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, where she competed in the Women's singles event. She swept her group, winning all three of her matches (against Kim Hyang-Mi, Xu Jing, and Petra Cada), but exited in the round of 16 after losing to China's Qiao Hong. For her Olympic performance, one of the best to that point in Singapore's history, Jing was named 1997 Sportswoman of the Year. The following year, Jing again competed in the Commonwealth Table Tennis Championships, winning the single, double, and team events, and earning a second consecutive Sportswoman of the Year award. She continued collecting medals in the following years, taking a singles title at the 1997 Southeast Asian Games and two doubles and a team title at the 1999 Southeast Asian Games. In the 2000 Summer Olympics, Jing competed in both the singles and doubles events, the latter alongside Li Jiawei. In the singles event, Jing again swept her group, beating Karen Li and Sofija Tepes. She then defeated Sun Jin, Lijuan Geng, and Mihaela Steff to reach the semifinals, where she was defeated by Li Ju. In the bronze medal game, she lost to Chen Jing. In the doubles event, Jing and Li started in the round of 16, where they were defeated by Eldijana Bentsen and Tamara Boro≈° of Croatia. Jing again won the Sportswoman of the Year award for her Olympic performance. Following the 2000 Olympics, Jing was ranked 12th in the world by the International Table Tennis Federation. In between the 2000 and 2004 Olympic games, Jing won medals at the 2001 and 2003 Southeast Asian Games, and at the 2002 Commonwealth Games. At the 2004 Olympic Games, Jing again competed in both the singles and doubles events, reprising her partnership with Li Jiawei in the doubles. Jing and Li began the doubles event in the round of 16, where they were defeated by South Korean team Kim Kyung-Ah and Kim Bok Rae. In the singles event, Jing began in the second round, where she defeated Silvija Erdelji of Serbia, but was knocked out by Kim Hyon-Hui of North Korea in the third round. Jing retired as a player that year. Coaching career Jing Junhong became the assistant coach of the Singapore women's table tennis team in 2009. She was on staff when, in the 2012 Summer Olympics, Singapore won two bronze medals, an individual medal by Feng Tianwei and a doubles medal by Wang Yuegu and Li Jiawei, Jing's former partner. In 2013, Jing was promoted to head coach, and won the Singapore Table Tennis Association's Coach of the Year award in 2013 and 2014. Under Jing's leadership, the women's team won six gold medals at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, and star player Feng Tianwei picked up additional victories at International Table Tennis Federation events in Japan, Australia, and the Philippines. The women's team also won three third-place medals at the 2014 Asian Games. In November 2015, following a public dispute with player Yu Mengyu at the International Table Tennis Federation Polish Open and a request by Yu and Feng Tianwei for a coaching change, Jing Junhong was replaced as the head coach of the women's team. Jing was instead put in charge of several of the Singapore Table Tennis Association's youth development programs, with oversight over both the programs and their coaches.

Craddick was Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives from January 2003 to January 2009. He was the first Republican to have served as Speaker since Reconstruction. Craddick resides in Midland, the largest city in his district. Craddick was first elected in 1968 at the age of twenty-five. By 2012, he was already the longest-serving member of the Texas state legislature and the second-longest-serving representative in the history of the state.Ramsey, Ross. Life of a Texas Lawmaker: Lousy Pay, Great Benefits. Texas Tribune. April 13, 2012. In the general election held on November 6, 2018, Craddick won his 26th term in the legislature. With 37,504 votes (80.3 percent), he defeated the Democratic candidate, Spencer Bounds, who polled 9,207 votes (19.7 percent). In this same election, Craddick's daughter, Christi Craddick, won her second term as a Republican member of the Texas Railroad Commission. Early career While he was a doctoral student at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Craddick decided to run for the legislature to succeed the incumbent Republican Frank Kell Cahoon of Midland, who was not seeking a third two-year term. According to Craddick's official biography, even his father, businessman R.F. Craddick (1913‚Äì1986), warned him: \\"Texas is run by Democrats. You can't win.\\" Although this part of Texas had become very friendly to Republicans at the national level (portions of this area, for instance, supported Barry M. Goldwater's 1964 presidential run, and Midland itself has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1948), Democrats held most offices at the local level well into the 1980s. Nonetheless, the Eagle Scout was elected to the Texas House in 1968, one of eight Republicans in the chamber at that time. His victory came on the same day that Richard M. Nixon was elected as U.S. President. In 1972, Craddick and former State Representative Frank Kell Cahoon encouraged Ernest Angelo, Craddick's neighbor, to run for the position of mayor of Midland being vacated by Edwin H. Magruder, Jr. Mayor Pro-tem Pat M. Baskin, the former chairman of the Midland County Democratic Executive Committee, also filed to run. Craddick believed that Baskin if elected would use the mayoral office to attempt to derail Craddick's bid for a third term in the state House in the general election scheduled for November 7, 1972. Angelo agreed to run for mayor if Cahoon would seek one of the at-large city council seats. The deal was struck, and both won their races.Billy Hathorn, \\"Mayor Ernest Angelo, Jr., of Midland and the 96-0 Reagan Sweep of Texas, May 1, 1976,\\" West Texas Historical Association Yearbook Vol. 86 (2010), p. 83 Craddick thereafter was elected to his third term in the House. In 1975, Craddick was named chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, the first Republican to have chaired a Texas legislative committee in more than a century.Bickerstaff, Steve. Lines in the Sand: Congressional Redistricting in Texas and the Downfall of Tom DeLay. Univ. of Texas Press, 2010. p. 25. In Texas, a legislator need not be in the majority party in order to chair a committee. Speaker of the House On January 11, 2003, after thirty-four years in the House, Craddick became the first Republican Speaker in more than 130 years. He held the presiding officer's position for six years. In December 2006, Craddick faced credible challenges to his re-election as Speaker for the Eightieth Texas Legislature: Brian McCall (R-Plano), Jim Pitts (R-Waxahachie), and Senfronia Thompson (D-Houston), all of whom announced candidacies for the speakership. In early January, McCall withdrew and endorsed Pitts. Supporters of Pitts pressed for a secret ballot in order to avoid retribution should their efforts fail, while Craddick had maintained all along that he had more than the minimum number of votes needed for re-election. When the secret ballot measure failed, Pitts withdrew, and Craddick was re-elected to a third term as Speaker on January 9, 2007, by a vote of 121-27.There was one vacancy in the 150-member chamber, and Craddick abstained. In January 2009, Craddick was ousted as Speaker after nearly the entire Democratic Caucus and a number of Republicans broke ranks to vote for Joe Straus, a two-term moderate Republican from San Antonio.Collier, Ken; Galatas, Steven; Harrelson-Stephens, Julie. Lone Star Politics: Tradition and Transformation in Texas. CQ Press, 2017. p. 109. Straus remained speaker until his retirement from the House in January 2019. The last Texas House Speaker to be removed had also been a Republican, Ira Hobart Evans, who was rejected in 1871 for cooperating with Democrats on an elections bill. Craddick won reelection to his House seat in the general election on November 2, 2010. Straus then won a second term as Speaker in January 2011, defeating two challengers. Speaker of the House controversy Craddick became increasingly unpopular with not only Democrats but those of his own party, and many called for a new Speaker to be elected. Chaos erupted in the Texas House of Representatives on Friday, May 25, 2007, when Fred Hill, a Republican from Richardson, attempted to raise a question of privilege to remove Craddick from office, but Craddick refused to allow him to raise the question. The attempts to oust Craddick continued through the weekend as other Republicans made additional motions, which were also disallowed for a time, although ultimately successful. Craddick's close allies, such as Representative Phil King of Weatherford, said that the actions against the Speaker were an effort by Democrats to gain control of the legislature before the legislative and congressional redistricting process of 2011. However, then Representative Byron Cook, a departing Republican from Corsicana, said that the fight was about Craddick having consolidated power with lobbyists and having used campaign contributions to maintain control in the House: \\"This is about the convergence of money and power and influence,\\" Cook said. Specifically, Craddick recessed the legislature for two and a half hours after Representatives attempted to gain recognition to put the question of Craddick's removal to a vote. When Hill asked to vote to remove Mr. Craddick, the Speaker replied: \\"The Speaker's power of recognition on any matter cannot be appealed.\\"Craddick causes frenzy in House His parliamentarian, Denise Davis disagreed, stating that question of privilege relating to the removal of a Speaker from office is such a highly privileged one that even the leader may not refuse. When Craddick shunned her advice, Davis and her assistant, Chris Griesel, resigned. Craddick immediately hired former Representative Terry Keel of Austin to the post as well as former Representative (and present-day lawyer) Ron Wilson as Keel's assistant. The session resumed until 1 a.m. and despite further protests from members of the legislature, Craddick remained in his position as Speaker, and the session was recessed. Personal life Thomas Craddick is married to the former Nadine Nayfa, a native of Sweetwater in west Texas. She is of Lebanese descent. In addition to their daughter, Christi, they have a son, Thomas, Jr., and a grandson, Thomas Russell Craddick, III. Craddick holds BBA and MBA degrees from the Rawls College of Business at Texas Tech. He lists his occupation as a sales representative for Mustang Mud, an oilfield supply company, although he also is a real estate speculator and developer. Since the early 1970s, Craddick's next-door neighbor has been Ernest Angelo, the former mayor of Midland who in 1976 was one of three Texas co-chairmen in the Ronald W. Reagan campaign to wrest the Republican presidential nomination from Gerald R. Ford, Jr., successful in Texas but defeated in a moderately close vote at the national convention held in Kansas City, Missouri. Craddick and Angelo are godparents to each other's children. Clifford Angelo, youngest of the Angelo children, was hired while attending the University of Texas in Austin as a legislative aide to Craddick.West Texas Historical Association Yearbook, p. 79 On November 6, 2012, when Craddick won his 23rd term in the Texas House, his daughter Christi was easily elected as a Republican to the Texas Railroad Commission, the state's oil and gas regulatory body.

It provides a set of OCaml libraries that are used to define grammars as well as loadable syntax extensions of such grammars. Camlp4 stands for Caml Preprocessor and Pretty-Printer and one of its most important applications was the definition of domain-specific extensions of the syntax of OCaml. Camlp4 was part of the official OCaml distribution which is developed at the INRIA. Its original author is Daniel de Rauglaudre. OCaml version 3.10.0, released in May 2007, introduced a significantly modified and backward-incompatible version of Camlp4. De Rauglaudre maintains a separate backward-compatible version, which has been renamed Camlp5. All of the examples below are for Camlp5 or the previous version of Camlp4 (versions 3.09 and prior). Version 4.08, released in the summer of 2019, was the last official version of this library. It is currently deprecated. Instead of camlp4 recommend using the PPX (PreProcessor eXtensions) libraries.  Concrete and abstract syntax  A Camlp4 preprocessor operates by loading a collection of compiled modules which define a parser as well as a pretty- printer: the parser converts an input program into an internal representation. This internal representation constitutes the abstract syntax tree (AST). It can be output in a binary form, e.g. it can be passed directly to one of the OCaml compilers, or it can be converted back into a clear text program. The notion of concrete syntax refers to the format in which the abstract syntax is represented. For instance, the OCaml expression (1 + 2) can also be written ((+) 1 2) or (((+) 1) 2). The difference is only at the level of the concrete syntax, since these three versions are equivalent representations of the same abstract syntax tree. As demonstrated by the definition of a revised syntax for OCaml, the same programming language can use different concrete syntaxes. They would all converge to an abstract syntax tree in a unique format that a compiler can handle. The abstract syntax tree is at the center of the syntax extensions, which are in fact OCaml programs. Although the definition of grammars must be done in OCaml, the parser that is being defined or extended is not necessarily related to OCaml, in which case the syntax tree that is being manipulated is not the one of OCaml. Several libraries are provided which facilitate the specific manipulation of OCaml syntax trees.  Fields of application  Domain-specific languages are a major application of Camlp4. Since OCaml is a multi-paradigm language, with an interactive toplevel and a native code compiler, it can be used as a backend for any kind of original language. The only thing that the developer has to do is write a Camlp4 grammar which converts the domain-specific language in question into a regular OCaml program. Other target languages can also be used, such as C. If the target language is OCaml, simple syntax add-ons or syntactic sugar can be defined, in order to provide an expressivity which is not easy to achieve using the standard features of the OCaml language. A syntax extension is defined by a compiled OCaml module, which is passed to the camlp4o executable along with the program to process. Camlp4 includes a domain-specific language as it provides syntax extensions which ease the development of syntax extensions. These extensions allow a compact definition of grammars (\`EXTEND\` statements) and quotations such as <:expr< 1 + 1 >>, i.e. deconstructing and constructing abstract syntax trees in concrete syntax.  Example  The following example defines a syntax extension of OCaml. It provides a new keyword, \`memo\`, which can be used as a replacement for \`function\` and provides automatic memoization of functions with pattern matching. Memoization consists in storing the results of previous computations in a table so that the actual computation of the function for each possible argument occurs at most once. This is pa_memo.ml, the file which defines the syntax extension: let unique = let n = ref 0 in fun () -> incr n; \\"__pa_memo\\" ^ string_of_int !n EXTEND GLOBAL: Pcaml.expr; Pcaml.expr: LEVEL \\"expr1\\" [ [ \\"memo\\"; OPT \\"\\"; pel = LIST1 match_case SEP \\"\\" -> let tbl = unique () in let x = unique () in let result = unique () in <:expr< let $lid:tbl$ = Hashtbl.create 100 in fun $lid:x$ -> try Hashtbl.find $lid:tbl$ $lid:x$ with [ Not_found -> let $lid:result$ = match $lid:x$ with [ $list:pel$ ] in do { Hashtbl.replace $lid:tbl$ $lid:x$ $lid:result$; $lid:result$ } ] >> ] ]; match_case: [ [ p = Pcaml.patt; w = OPT [ \\"when\\"; e = Pcaml.expr -> e ]; \\"->\\"; e = Pcaml.expr -> (p, w, e) ] ]; END Example of program using this syntax extension: let counter = ref 0 (* global counter of multiplications *) (* factorial with memoization *) let rec fac = memo 0 -> 1  n when n > 0 -> (incr counter; n * fac (n - 1))  _ -> invalid_arg \\"fac\\" let run n = let result = fac n in let count = !counter in Printf.printf \\"%i! = %i number of multiplications so far = %i \\" n result count let _ = List.iter run [5; 4; 6] The output of the program is as follows, showing that the fac function (factorial) only computes products that were not computed previously: 5! = 120 number of multiplications so far = 5 4! = 24 number of multiplications so far = 5 6! = 720 number of multiplications so far = 6  References   External links  * Camlp4 Wiki - covers version 3.10 * Camlp5 website * Camlp4 reference manual and tutorial - cover version 3.07 * Camlp4 undocumented features - covers versions up to 3.09 * How to customize the syntax of OCaml, using Camlp5 - Everything you always wanted to know, but were afraid to ask - covers versions up to 3.10 * One-Day Compilers or How I learned to stop worrying and love metaprogramming * Tutorial on building extensible parsers with Camlp4 Category:OCaml software Category:Parsing ","title":"Camlp4"},{"id":"2148702","text":"Jamberoo Hotel, pictured in 2012 Jamberoo is a town approx 11.3 km inland from Kiama on the South Coast of New South Wales, Australia in the Municipality of Kiama. At the , Jamberoo had a population of 1,667. The town's name is derived from an Aboriginal word meaning 'track'. It is well known for the Jamberoo Action Park, Jamberoo Hotel, a pub, and the local dairy-farming community. The Australian Illawarra Shorthorn cattle breed originated in the area. Jamberoo is the birthplace of politician Joseph Cullen. History European history in the valley began in the early 19th century when the cedar-cutters moved through the rainforests gathering this valuable timber. Pioneer settlers followed in the early 1820s with William Davis receiving the first land grant in 1821, followed by John Ritchie and John Cullen shortly afterwards. Michael Hyam was a property owner by the late 1830s and he laid out the private village of Jamberoo in 1841. The Main South Coast Road formed the northern boundary of his village and at the western end of the town he gave out lots for Protestant Churches. The Presbyterian church of St Stephen stands on the original lot. The Methodist church around the corner in Wyalla St is now the Uniting Church and still hosts services, while the land given to the Church of England, now Anglican Church of Australia has been sold off and the Anglican Church is located north of Hyams Creek on Tates Hill. The old Presbyterian, Anglican and Uniting cemeteries are still located on the original lots, although they have been closed to burials since at least the 1920s A sign outside the only fuel station in Jamberoo proclaims the town as the birthplace of co-operative dairy production in Australia. The first co-operative butter factory in Australia was begun at Jamberoo in 1884 adjacent to the old Main South Coast Road (now Jamberoo Road), 2 km from the Princes Highway and just west of Spring Creek and the monument marking the old toll gate. The location is better described as Kiama. An obelisk marks the spot. In time, there were other butter factories: Woodstock and Wauchope which became the main factory in Factory Lane to the east of the town.  Heritage listings  Jamberoo has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 2 Allowrie Street: St Stephen's Presbyterian Church * 2 km east of Jamberoo Main Road: Culwalla Homestead Geography Jamberoo sits at the western end of Minnamurra Swamp, known locally as The Swamp. The Minnamurra River flows from Minnamurra Falls along the northern side of the swamp. Just east of the old butter factory on Factory Lane the river enters a man-made channel that keeps the river flowing on the northern side of the swamp; the original channel meandered through the broad eastern end of the swamp before crossing Swamp Road and running along the south side of the swamp. In times of high tide and high rainfall, the river resumes its old course closing Swamp Road. The valley of Jamberoo and the Minnamurra River is steep-sided and reasonably narrow. As a result, the town and valley is not subject to the extremes of weather that nearby Albion Park is. This is a significant observation because the climate data for the district is recorded at Albion Park. Local research (unverified) from Jamberoo weather stations suggests that wind speeds in Jamberoo are approximately half that experienced at Albion Park, while rainfall varies significantly depending on the altitude and proximity to the steep valley sides. Air temperature is not as extreme as recorded for Albion Park.Unpublished weather data from the Anglican Rectory, Jamberoo compared with Bureau of Meteorology data from Albion Park Regional Airport Governance Jamberoo was declared a municipality on 21 November 1890. The butcher's shop in Allowrie Street is the former Council Chamber while the bridge over Hyams Creek that joins the northern and southern sides of the village was opened in 1937 by Mrs Fredericks, Mayor of Jamberoo. Jamberoo is a part of the Municipality of Kiama, State seat of Kiama and Federal seat of Gilmore which, apart from Jamberoo, consists mostly of the metropolitan area of southern Wollongong and Shellharbour. Demographics n the 2016 Census, there were 1,636 people in Jamberoo. 79.9% of people were born in Australia and 90.5% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 27.1%, Anglican 24.6% and Catholic 24.5%. Education Education in Jamberoo was first provided by the Church of England (now Anglican) on the site of the original grant of land from Michael Hyam. School commenced early in 1842 in a building partly funded by private subscription and government money. After a school teacher left in August 1873, there was talk of converting the school house into a Public School however this did not occur and it reopened in March 1874 with 40 students. The Public School came into operation in January 1878 which led to the closure of the denominational schools.

For example, a drummer might play a beat, whereupon the engineer might then replace all of the snare hits with the sound of a hand-clap. It is considered by some to be one of the most arcane practices of the modern music production industry and is an example of the considerable influence of computers in modern music, even in genres not strictly classified as \\"electronic music.\\"  Origins  The practice is an extension of the recording techniques of the 1970s through to the 1980s, wherein the constant search for better or \\"more perfect\\" sound led to a variety of techniques being tested, including the extensive use of drum machines. Among these techniques was drum replacement, which was pioneered by producer Roger Nichols while in the studio with Steely Dan in the late '70s, and has grown in both popularity and complexity since.Digidesign  News  Partner News  Roger Nichols Digital Unveils Universal Binary Versions of Pro Tools plug-ins for Intel-based Macintosh Systems One of the most common uses of this technique is the replacing of every snare hit in a performance (which may or may not sound subjectively \\"good\\") with an \\"ideal\\" snare drum hit. Should the decision be made to use drum replacement techniques, the actual implementation of the practice usually falls to an audio engineer during the mixing stage.  Association  Drum replacing is often mentioned, along with autotune, harmonizers, and advanced compressors, as being symptomatic of the \\"artificial nature\\" of modern western music by certain critics. Some critics suggest that the practice defeats the purpose of having a live drummer as opposed to a drum machine, since the end result is effectively exactly the same as what a drum machine would produce if the drum machine had a custom sample recorded for it by the engineer. Others laud it as one of the subtleties of studio technique, used by engineers to give their craft more complexity in an increasingly automated world.

Originally there were only five Evolve episodes, produced from 2001 to 2003, Bandai created ten more Evolve episodes from 2004 to 2007. While the first two episodes took place in the Universal Century, some of the later clips also showed Gundams from the other timelines. The clips show alternative scenes, side-stories or omakes for fans. The clips feature a mix of animation media which vary from traditional animation to 3D rendering to cel-shaded animation. The target is to show the Gundams and other mobile suits in high-quality CGI. A total of 15 shorts were released and later compiled in three separate volumes, namely Gundam Evolve ../+ (\\"Plus\\"), Gundam Evolve ../Œ© (\\"Omega\\") and Gundam Evolve ../Œë (\\"Alpha\\"). Each volume consists of 5 episodes. The logo features a battered Core Fighter floating upside down, as seen on the final episode of the original Mobile Suit Gundam series. Episode Summaries =01 ‚Äì RX-78-2 Gundam= This episode is the only one that features no CG. Instead it is a short clip show of the original Mobile Suit Gundam series. In this episode Amuro Ray, waiting to start in the final battle of A Baoa Qu, sits in his RX-78-2 Gundam while the other forces are already fighting. He recalls many of the battles he has fought until now, beginning with his fight against the mobile armor Elmeth when he killed Lalah Sune. Afterward he recalls the battle against the Black Tri-Stars, Ramba Ral and Char Aznable. He also thinks about the people important to him who died, including Ryu Jose, Matilda Ajan and Sleggar Law. Then he hears Sayla Mass who tells him that if they can overcome war, humanity should as well. Soon afterward, Amuro launches. =02 ‚Äì RX-178 Gundam Mk-II= The events of this episode take place after the Gryps Conflict. The story revolves around a video tape which is sent to Kamille Bidan by Argama chief engineer Astonaige Medoz. On the video Astonaige wishes him a quick recovery and it also contains a video scene from a battle training at which Kamille participated during the Gryps Conflict. In the training he uses the Gundam Mk.II to fight against several drones and two Rick Dias in a combat simulation. Although he thinks it is too easy he accidentally destroys the camera probe recording the training. The episode ends with a written report by Kamille apologizing over damaging the surveillance pod, in which he angrily wrote in later sections denying himself of any responsibility for the incident, protesting over having to write such a formal apology at all, and going further on to accuse his superiors Quattro Bajeena and Henken Bekkener of being totally irrational and incompetent. =03 ‚Äì GF13-017NJII God Gundam= The third Evolve clip is about G Gundam. It features Domon Kasshu, who is practicing T'ai chi with the God Gundam. However suddenly Rain Mikamura appears in the Rising Gundam and attacks him because he was away for two days. He tells her he was only training but she believes that he was off chasing skirts, and the two fight. Trying to end the battle, Domon attacks with the God Gundam's God Finger (actually the Sekiha Tenkyo-Ken), causing Rain to counter with the Rising Gundam's Rising Finger (actually Rising's own rendition of the Sekiha Tenkyo-Ken) attack. Both attacks clash together with an immense power, but Rain's attack breaks through. When the smoke clears, Rising Gundam is performing Tai Chi while God Gundam looks on, with insults like \\"Womanizer\\" and \\"Lazy Bum\\" written all over its head. (It's worth noting that nothing within the actual G Gundam series implies Rising can perform a Finger attack in the manner shown; in the series, the Rising Gundam's strongest attack is the Rising Arrow, which is fired from the beam bow on its left arm. Likewise, Rain being able to outmatch Domon in actual Gundam combat seems strictly for comedy.) =04 ‚Äì RX-78 GP03 Dendrobium= After the last clip played in the Future Century, this episode returns to the Universal Century. It is revealed that several people leaked information about the Gundam Development Project to the Zeon Forces because Jamitov Hymem dislikes it. Afterwards a ruined MS-14A Gelgoog is shown floating in space after a group of Gelgoog Marine Types and MS-06F Zaku II mobile suits attack the La Vie en Rose. To counter them a woman named Defrah Kar pilots the Gundam GP03 Dendrobium Stamen to destroy them. To make this easier she uses the Orchis platform and, thanks to its powerful weapons, is easily able to destroy them, and thanks to her I-field she is even able to defend herself from the attack of a large battleship. However, after the battle and while ejecting the Stamen from the Orchis, a severely damaged Gelgoog is able to shoot at the cockpit of the Stamen, killing Defrah and incidentally destroying the experimental cockpit. Afterwards the people who looked on the Gundam data examine the data of the GP04 Gerbera. This animation may explain the confusion concerning the two types of cockpits for the Stamen unit. =05 ‚Äì RX-93 ŒΩ Gundam= This episode shows a bright alternative scenario for Quess Paraya from Char's Counterattack, as Tomino's attitude during Char's Counterattack was rather grim and depressing. The episode begins with Quess, who had apparently used the NZ-333 Alpha Azieru to severely damage Hathaway Noa's RGM-89 Jegan. Afterwards Amuro Ray in his RX-93 Nu Gundam has a Newtype reaction to her and confronts her. He accuses her of not understanding Hathaway's feelings, but Quess doesn't listen and attacks him. However Amuro is able to trap her inside the Fin Funnel's beam barriers. Afterwards they hear Hathaway who tells Quess not to be angry, and Amuro tells Quess that Hathaway isn't dead. Thanks to this and Amuro's words she calms down and she finally uses the Alpha Azieru to rescue Hathaway. This episode was written by Yoshiyuki Tomino, whose change of outlook used this animation to give Quess a happy ending as an alternative to her death in the movie. =06 ‚Äì YMF-X000A Dreadnought Gundam= The clip starts off with a battle between the YMF-X000A Dreadnought and several ZGMF-600 GuAIZ. Although Prayer Reverie tells them that he doesn't want to fight they continue and one of them slams him in an asteroid. Suddenly a DRAGOON-equipped Dreadnought \\"ghost\\" appears, separates itself from the real Dreadnought and attacks the GuAIZ, destroying all of them very easily. Afterwards it fires all its weapons on the real Dreadnought but the attack is stopped by the CAT1-X1/3 Hyperion. Then the two suits battle and finally Prayer joins the fight and together with the Hyperion he destroys the \\"ghost\\". At last the two suits turn their weapons on each other. In the end, this turned out to be a dream of Prayer's, foreshadowing his eventual battle with the Hyperion. =07 - XXXG-00W0 Wing Gundam Zero= This episode begins with a figure in a spacesuit (Heero Yuy) setting bombs, then fades to Gundam engineer Doctor J, apparently imprisoned. He talks to a shadowy visitor about history and his young protege as the person in space suit tries to escape the facility he has just sabotaged. The guards catch up to him, but he uses a nearby Virgo II mobile doll to distract them and escape to his machine - Wing Zero. Heero uses the twin buster rifle to break out of the base's hangar, but loses the weapon in the escape and resorts to using a Virgo II beam rifle. He is chased by several Virgo IIs along the length of the facility, which is actually a gigantic colony cannon. After dealing with his pursuit, Heero attacks the cannon directly with his beam rifle as the bombs begin to go off. Doctor J finishes his narration, commenting to his visitor (now revealed as Relena Peacecraft) that he chose Heero's codename personally. As the colony cannon explodes, Heero flies away to his next mission. Gundam Evolve 7 was written and directed by Shukou Murase, who was character designer for the original Gundam Wing series.Gundam Evolve 7 - Credits The original Japanese voice actors are used; Hikaru Midorikawa for Heero Yuy and Minoru Inaba for Doctor J. The 3D animation was based on Bandai's Master Grade \\"Wing Gundam Zero - Endless Waltz\\" model. This Evolve's place within Gundam Wing continuity is unclear, but it appears to take place during the last story arc of the series, after White Fang captures Relena but before Doctor J dies. During this period, Heero was working with the other four Gundam pilots; their absence from this mission is a source of much of this confusion. However, the event is mentioned in secret documents at the beginning of the novel New Mobile Report Gundam Wing: Frozen Teardrop, where it was stated to take place in the spring of A.C. 196, after the TV series and before Endless Waltz. =08 - GAT-X105 Strike Gundam= In a secret ZAFT desert base, the Aile Strike Gundam faces off against several GINN OCHER Types. The animation adapted the style of visual special effect seen in The Matrix, and featured the Grand Slam Sword included with the Perfect Grade and later Master Grade Strike Gundam model kits. =09 - MSZ-006 Zeta Gundam= In space there lies a giant mobile armor called the Psycho Weapon and it's decimating the EFSF fleets so it's up to 3 Zeta Gundams to destroy the huge weapon... Although numbered 9, this Evolve is the last to come out in Gundam Evolve ../Œ©. It is said to feature three Zeta Gundams, three pilots with the aliases Red Snake, Grey Wolf, and White Unicorn as well as an enormous MA of unknown affiliation in orbit. There is also the mentioning of the Chakra Laboratory of AEUG/Karaba and a top-secret mission. Red Snake's Zeta Gundam is red, with redesigned armour on the chest, feet, skirt and lower leg. The new armour sports a spiked look. In addition, the wings are wider and pointed, and there is a large vertical spike behind its head, apparently protruding from the middle of its back. The pilot apparently is a young Newtype girl named Yurii Ajissah, who holds a special feeling towards her squadron leader, White Unicorn. White Unicorn is believed to be the legendary ace Amuro Ray, based on the physical appearance, personal logo, military ranking, Yurii's memory of their encounter at Side 6 during the One Year War, and most importantly, Toru Furuya being the character's voice actor. His Zeta Gundam unit appears to be the same one that Amuro piloted in the short CGI film Green Divers (white with purple stripes, plus Amuro's signature \\"A\\" symbol on the left shoulder armour). Grey Wolf's Zeta Gundam (nicknamed \\"Buster Zeta\\") unit is a yellow colour with two additional fins/airfoils on its upper back. Grey Wolf is unhappy with his machine's colors and would have preferred it to be grey. This, coupled with his nickname, his \\"Grey Wolf\\" logo (which is actually a white wolf head) and the fact that he is a former Zeon pilot, seems to imply that Grey Wolf is actually Zeon ace pilot Shin Matsunaga, the infamous \\"White Wolf of Solomon\\". Similarly, the original pilot of Red Snake's Zeta is implied to be Johnny Ridden, who was reassigned since Red Zeta is a Newtype-use machine. =10 - MSZ-010 ZZ Gundam= Judau is assigned to protect/escort the space transport ship Jupitris on his birthday. While on the recovery missions he encounters Neo Zeon forces pursuing an AMX-004-3 Quebeley MK.II. Seeing the Quebeley posing no threat, Judau decides to come to its aid, despite his ZZ-GR being designed for space operations and not battle. During the battle a \\"present\\" cargo rocket from Judau's sister Leina arrives, and is revealed to be an improved version of the original ZZ Gundam's B-Parts, allowing Judau to fight off the attackers and save the Quebeley's pilot. In the end, the pilot of the Qubeley is seen to be a Ple clone. The magazine Gundam Ace stated that she is one of the only two surviving Ple clones of the final battle in ZZ, the other being Ple 12. =11 ‚Äì RB-79 Ball= Novice Federation pilot Hiden and a few other survey the recent battle ground of A Baoa Qu in a squad of RB-79 Ball.

When Hiden, the sole survivor, finally destroys the enemy, he discovers that it was piloted by a young woman, whose body floats by him. In the ending credits, the cockpit of his Ball is empty. The plot of this episode closely parallels a real-world encounter in Germany, May 1945. An American convoy is bombarded with an 88mm cannon hidden in rubble after Germany surrendered. Claud Amensen, a war correspondent and Lt. Ronald Bourbon, a soldier, reported that the cannon was operated by a 15-yer old Hitlersjungen girl. She surrendered when she ran out of ammo, and was brought to a German police office later, never heard from again. =12 ‚Äì RMS-099 Rick Dias= Quattro Bajeena boards his Rick Dias for a battle simulation to transfer combat data to the mass-production model.

Rekka Musha Gundam comes to the rescue chasing their leader Mazaku for the Scroll of Light he had stolen. Stopping briefly at a teahouse, Rekka informs three young kids about the Seven of Light Gundam team he leads. Suddenly Mazaku's Gelgoog minions set the building on fire. After defeating the minions, Mazaku appears and uses the Scroll to transform into the gigantic Hadou Musha Mazaku. Rekka is easily defeated by his gigantic and powerful foe. The children prepare to surrender but Rekka stands up and cries out. His noble spirit causes the Scroll to abandon Mazaku and give Rekka its true power, giving him the Armour of Light. With his new power and cheered on by the children, Rekka slices Mazaku in half and saves the day.

One of them appears as Eymundar √æ√°ttr hrings in the Flatey Book and the other one is an introductory chapter in Yngvars saga v√≠√∞f√∂rla. They deal with the adventures of Varangians in the service of Yaroslav I the Wise. The main difference between the two versions is that in Eymundar √æ√°ttr hrings, the hero is a Norwegian, whereas Yngvars saga v√≠√∞f√∂rla describes him as ruling Sv√≠√æj√≥√∞,http://heimskringla.no/wiki/Yngvars_saga_v%C3%AD%C3%B0f%C3%B6rla but these two terms were not entirely mutually exclusive at this time. Sv√≠√æj√≥√∞ refers to the sweonas people. '√ûjo√∞' (Theod) is related to Proto-Indo-European *tewt√©h‚ÇÇ, meaning ‚Äútribe‚Äù, rather than land. Whereas Svealand today refers to the territories of modern Sweden between Norrland and G√∂taland, old Svi√æjo√∞ extended eastwards, far beyond the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Finland, what we may recognize as Varangian Russia, encompassing Gar√∞ariki. It is important to note that we are referring to the Age of Migration, which probably didn't really begin as peoples were semi-sedentary since time immemorial. According to King Alfred of Wessex's world historyhttp://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/kerr/vol01chap01sect06to11.html based on Orosius we would find Sarmatia to the east of Svi√æjo√∞; whereto and beyond which Eymundar travels. Norrland in Sweden may refer as much to the eponymous N√≥rr as Norway (N√≥rvegr) does. Torre and his children, N√≥rr, G√≥rr and G√≥i are from Gandvik, in the Gulf of Bothnia. This region to the north of the Golf of Helsing, in the Fornaldar S√∂gurhttp://heimskringla.no/wiki/Fornaldars%C3%B6gur_Nor%C3%B0urlanda_I- IV:_Fundinn_Noregr, is Jotland, called Kvenland and Finland. N√≥rr's sister, G√≥i, marries Hrolf son of Sva√∞a, which may or may not be read as eponymous of the Swedes. Thus we may say that Norwegians and Swedes are mixed from the very beginning of memorial times, even though the distinction is from old the dividing line between the non-Germanic Norse and the Germanic Sweonas.

Accessed August 4, 2015.Matthew Watkins, \\"Fenves Named Next President of UT-Austin\\" Texas Tribune April 20, 2015. accessed August 4, 2015 Before his death, Powers held the Hines H. Baker and Thelma Kelley Baker Chair at the University of Texas School of Law. Powers was selected in November 2005 as the sole finalist for the position of president of the University of Texas at Austin. In December 2005, he was officially named president of the university and succeeded Larry Faulkner when he left office in February 2006. Prior to his appointment, he had served as dean of the University of Texas School of Law since 2000. Powers resigned the presidency in June 2015, partly as the result of external pressures regarding admissions practices at the university. Education Powers obtained his B.A. in chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, and his J.D. from Harvard Law School. During his undergraduate years at Berkeley, he became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity, and at Harvard he was managing editor of the Harvard Law Review. Employment Powers also worked at Southern Methodist University, the University of Michigan, and the University of Washington. Powers was a former member of the Enron Corporation board of directors and chaired the Special Investigative Committee to investigate the causes of Enron's bankruptcy. He was also a member of the board of trustees of Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary from 2004 to 2010.Daily Texan \\"UT expands on available space instead of acquiring important community buildings\\" (October 28, 2013) Powers has authored several law texts, including: *Cases and Materials in Products Liability *Cases and Materials in Torts *Texas Products Liability Law Powers was a member of the American Law Institute and served as the Reporter on several of the Restatements of the Law, Torts:https://www.ali.org/news/articles/memoriam-william-charles-powers-jr/ *Restatement of the Law Third, Torts: Apportionment of Liability *Restatement of the Law Third, Torts: Liability for Physical Harm *Restatement of the Law Third, Torts: Concluding Provisions In 2008, Powers was appointed to the rank of Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur in France's orders of chivalry. , statesman.com In 2012, he became vice chair of the Association of American UniversitiesUT News, \\"Powers Elected Vice Chair of Association of American Universities\\" (October 26, 2012) and became chair of the organization on October 22, 2013.Daily Texan, \\"Powers elected chair of Association of American Universities\\" (October 22, 2013) He was a member of Westminster Presbyterian Church in Austin. University of Texas at Austin While president, Powers oversaw the reform of the undergraduate curriculum and the founding of both the School of Undergraduate Studies and the Dell Medical School. An eight-year fundraising project he spearheaded called the Campaign for Texas raised $3.12 billion for the university. During his tenure the University also completed or began construction on 13 new buildings. Despite his successes, Powers's final four years were marked by growing opposition to the status quo in higher education in Austin. A group of regents appointed by then-Governor Rick Perry attempted to instantiate the \\"Seven Breakthrough Solutions\\" of Austin entrepreneur Jeff Sandefer. Sandefer's ideas for the restructuring of the University were thought by many to be inimical to its research mission. Perry had endorsed the \\"seven solutions\\" at a private meeting attended by two of his appointed regents at the Texas Public Policy Foundation in 2008. In the face of mounting pressure from the Board of Regents to implement Sandefer's program, Powers remained steadfast in his support for the University's traditional role and shape. Such actions made him a target of various reformers, and at the same time an admired figure within the higher education community: Powers was elected to Chair the Association of American Universities in 2013. Soon after the 2011 appointment of regent Wallace L. Hall Jr., a college friend of Sandefer's, Powers became the focus of multiple investigations by Hall. Hall's interests as a regent centered largely on Powers's role as leader of its flagship campus in Austin, even though the University of Texas System includes fourteen institutions. Having probed accounting procedures in its capital campaign and a forgivable loan program administered by a private foundation in support of its law school faculty, Hall turned his attention to external influence on admissions at the University. A series of document requests revealed that powerful individuals often sought to obtain favoritism toward various applicants, and sometimes succeeded. In May 2014, a blog post reported that various regents had asked then UT System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa to fire Powers. Almost immediately, a grassroots campaign arose in his support. A Facebook group named \\"I Stand With Bill Powers\\" attracted nearly 10,000 members. =Resignation= On July 4, 2014, an anonymous source reported that UT System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa had asked Powers to resign, prior to the impending meeting of the Board of Regents, or face termination. The Board meeting agenda indicated regents would discuss Powers in an executive session. Cigarroa attributed the request to a \\"breakdown of communication, collegiality, trust and a willingness to work together for the good of the university.\\" Powers at first indicated he would not resign, saying it would \\"cast the university and our state in a highly unfavorable light.\\" However, on July 9, 2014, Cigarroa released a statement that Powers nevertheless agreed to resign effective June 2015. On February 12, 2015, an investigation ordered by the University of Texas found that Powers had helped certain applicants, including those with lesser academic credentials, gain admission if they had been recommended by legislators and influential people. According to the report, from 2009 to 2014, well-connected students flagged by university officials were admitted 74% of the time compared to an overall admission rate of 40%. President Powers and his Chief of Staff \\"each failed to speak with candor and forthrightness expected of people in their positions of trust and leadership,\\" the report stated. Powers agreed to step down in June 2014. He told the Wall Street Journal that he had \\"intervened on behalf of a relatively small number of students\\" but denied that it was \\"undue influence.\\" Subsequently, the Austin American-Statesman determined that, as Chancellor, Cigarroa had participated in this selfsame aspect of the admissions process, sometimes making notes on the letters about the status of the individuals requesting special consideration in admissions. Personal life Powers was first married to Karen Devendorf. They had two children and the marriage ended in divorce. He then married Kim Heilbrun, his wife of 36 years; they had three children together. He died on March 10, 2019, in Austin from complications from a fall several months earlier and from oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, a rare adult-onset muscle disorder. He is survived by all five children, as well as 6 grandchildren. References External links *The University of Texas: Office of the President *William C.

Holden made national headlines with his walk. Biography Bill Holden grew up at the beginning of the television era in the United States. His father was a die-hard baseball fan. In 1957, Holden had his first in-person baseball experience, going to a Chicago Cubs home game. Holden became a lifetime Cubs fan instantly. Ron Santo became Holden's favorite player. Holden has followed the Cubs his whole life since seeing them play in person for the first time. He chose to become a teacher instead of a baseball player, however, and, in 1966, he enrolled at Southern Illinois University, graduating in 1970. Holden got his first job as a teacher in 1973. He has been working as a teacher since. He became interested in teaching Native American children, so, after many years teaching in the Illinois public schools system, he relocated to Camp Verde, Arizona. At Camp Verde, he became aware of the alarming incidence of diabetes among Indian children. He started teaching groups of children that suffered from the disease. On New Year's Eve 2004, his son presented him with the docu-film This Old Cub, based on Santo's experience as a diabetic player in MLB. After watching the film seven times before going to bed that morning, Holden became inspired and convinced that he needed to do something to help find a cure for diabetes.  The walk  On January 11, 2005, Holden began his walk, hoping to cover at least 12 miles each day. Holden crossed over six states, including New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma and Missouri, apart from Arizona and Illinois. He had to battle weariness and summer heat along the way. According to his own account, Holden had a brush with death when he was about to get run over by a car, but the drivers recognized him and waved. Holden had told Santo about the fundraising walk before it took place, gaining Santo's admiration. On June 29, Holden arrived at Harry Caray's restaurant in Rosemont, Illinois. He overnighted there, as he had previously done in several odd places and small hotels. After arriving at the famous Cubs baseball stadium, Wrigley Field, on July 1, Holden, who was joined by Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich during the final steps of his walk, threw that day's symbolic first pitch to Kerry Wood, as the Cubs played the Washington Nationals. During the game's seventh inning stretch, he and Santo sang \\"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\\". Holden has arthritis in both of his knees. His fund-raising walk made headlines in newspapers across his home country, including The Arizona Republic and many others. Ron Santo told reporters, \\"When he mentioned the fact that he was going to walk from Arizona to Wrigley Field to raise money for diabetes, I couldn't believe it! Then, when I heard he was 20 miles away, I'm saying 'get in the car and drive it. You've made it!' But he said, 'Nope, I'm going to walk'. I mean, think about that.

The store utilized Microsoft's Windows Media Player application and proprietary Windows Media Format files (protected .wma files). It started out with 1.5 million songs, but decreased to 1.1 million songs due to lagging sales and lack of real support from Microsoft. The MSN Music store was not compatible with Microsoft's own Zune music player. As of 14 November 2006, MSN Music ceased music sales and now redirects viewers to either Zune or Real Rhapsody websites. Microsoft acquired MongoMusic on September 13, 2000 and merged its technology. In 2006, when announcing the closing of MSN Music in the United States, Microsoft promised users that license servers would be maintained for five years but in April 2008, Microsoft announced that the DRM servers for MSN Music would be deactivated on 2008-08-31. After this date, it was no longer possible to reauthorize purchased songs when changing computers or operating systems. They have suggested that customers back-up their music by burning it to CD. They later relented, and committed to keeping the DRM servers online through the end of 2011. MSN's music section nonetheless remained online after 2008, hosting content such as music blogs and photo galleries; it has continued to be referred to as MSN Music. Other countries Although MSN Music Downloads have ceased in the US, MSN Music Downloads (DRM Protected) are still available in the UK via the MSN UK Portal and/or through Windows Media Player although the service is powered by Nokia (formerly OD2).

Managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), it is a series of badland areas characterized by rock outcroppings, steep bluffs, and grassy plains; a topography referred to as \\"The Breaks\\" by locals (as the land appears to \\"break away\\" to the river). Created by proclamation in 2001 by President Bill Clinton on January 17, it encompasses , of public lands, most of which were already managed by the federal government. The adjacent Missouri River was designated a Wild and Scenic River in 1976 and forms a western boundary while the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge is to the east. The Breaks country was a model for many of the paintings done by painter Charles M. Russell.  History  French trappers found the area in the late 18th century peopled by Native American tribes such as the Blackfoot, Northern Cheyenne, Sioux, Assiniboine, Gros Ventre (Atsina), Crow, Plains Cree, and Plains Ojibwa. (The Crow name is Xu√°hcheesh Ann√°ppiio, \\"Where the Crow warrior Skunk was killed.\\") The Lewis and Clark Expedition passed through the Breaks in 1805 and were the first to document the region through notes and drawings, and their sighting and documentation of bighorn sheep in the Breaks region was the first time this species was recorded in North America by white explorers. Much of the Breaks region has remained as it was when Lewis and Clark's party first saw it. The confluence of the Judith and Missouri Rivers was the setting for important peace councils in 1846 and 1855. In 1877, the eastbound Nez Perce crossed the Missouri and entered the Breaks country in their attempt to escape to Canada. The Cow Island Skirmish occurred in the Breaks and was the last encounter prior to the Nez Perce's surrender to the U.S. Army at the Battle of Bear Paw, just north of the monument.\\"Proclamation 7398-Establishment of the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument.(Transcript) - Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents  HighBeam Research The Missouri River carved the Breaks into the Montana landscape Management and conservation A full management plan is still under development due to various private inholdings and lease agreements between private citizens and the federal government. While conservationists would like to see some of the Breaks monument lands become designated as Wilderness, local ranchers and farmers under long standing lease agreements with the federal government, who graze upwards of 10,000 head of cattle annually within the new monument, are concerned that the monument status may adversely affect their livelihood and the economies of local towns. Under the proposed management plan from the Department of the Interior, although the resources of the monument will be given better protection, \\"currently permitted livestock grazing, hunting, fishing, and similar activities will generally not be affected, nor will private property (approximately ) and state land (approximately ) within the boundary of the proposed monument, as well as other valid existing rights.\\" In 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the BLM's management plan violated historic site laws with their practices. The National Trust for Historic Preservation cited the site as one of ten historic sites saved in 2013. The Breaks is home to at least sixty mammal species and hundreds of bird species. Willows and shrubs are found along the Missouri River banks while sagebrush and short grass prairie are dominant elsewhere.

A graduate of Balliol College, Krishna Varma was a noted scholar in Sanskrit and other Indian languages. He pursued a brief legal career in India and served as the Divan of a number of Indian princely states in India. He had, however, differences with Crown authority, was dismissed following a supposed conspiracy of local British officials at Junagadh and chose to return to England. An admirer of Dayanand Saraswati's approach of cultural nationalism, and of Herbert Spencer, Krishna Varma believed in Spencer's dictum: \\"Resistance to aggression is not simply justified, but imperative\\". In 1905 he founded the India House and The Indian Sociologist, which rapidly developed as an organised meeting point for radical nationalists among Indian students in Britain at the time and one of the most prominent centres for revolutionary Indian nationalism outside India. Krishna Varma moved to Paris in 1907, avoiding prosecution.  Early life  Shyamji Krishna Varma was born on 4 October 1857 in Mandvi, Cutch State (now Kutch, Gujarat) as Shamji, the son of Krushnadas Bhanushali (Karsan Nakhua; Nakhua is the surname while Bhanushali is the community name), a labourer for cotton press company, and Gomatibai, who died when Shyamji was only 11 years old. He was raised by his grandmother. His ancestors belonged to Bhachunda (23¬∞12'3\\"N 69¬∞0'4\\"E), a village now in Abdasa taluka of Kutch district. They had migrated to Mandvi in search of employment and due to familial disputes. After completing secondary education in Bhuj he went to Mumbai for further education at Wilson High School. Whilst in Mumbai, he learned Sanskrit.Sundaram, V. (8 October 2006) Pandit Shyamji Krishna Verma. boloji.com In 1875, Shyamji married Bhanumati, a daughter of a wealthy businessman of the Bhatia community and sister of his school friend Ramdas. Then he got in touch with the nationalist Swami Dayananda Saraswati, a radical reformer and an exponent of the Vedas, who had founded the Arya Samaj. He became his disciple and was soon conducting lectures on Vedic philosophy and religion. In 1877, a public speaking tour secured him a great public recognition. He became the first non-Brahmin to receive the prestigious title of Pandit by the Pandits of Kashi in 1877. He came to the attention of Monier Williams, an Oxford professor of Sanskrit who offered Shyamji a job as his assistant.  Oxford  Shyamji arrived in England and joined Balliol College, Oxford on 25 April 1879 with the recommendation of Professor Monier Williams. Passing his B.A. in 1883, he presented a lecture on \\"the origin of writing in India\\" to the Royal Asiatic Society. The speech was very well received and he was elected a non-resident member of the society. In 1881 he represented India at the Berlin Congress of Orientalists.  Legal career  He returned to India in 1885 and started practice as a lawyer. Then he was appointed as Diwan (chief minister) by the King of Ratlam State; but ill health forced him to retire from this post with a lump sum gratuity of RS 32052 for his service. After a short stay in Mumbai, he settled in Ajmer, headquarters of his Guru Swami Dayananda Saraswati, and continued his practice at the British Court in Ajmer. He invested his income in three cotton presses and secured sufficient permanent income to be independent for the rest of his life. He served for the Maharaja of Udaipur as a council member from 1893 to 1895, followed by the position of Diwan of Junagadh State. He resigned in 1897 after a bitter experience with a British agent that shook his faith in British Rule.  Nationalism  Having read Satyarth Prakash and other books of Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Shyamji Krishna Varma was very much impressed with his philosophy, writings and spirit of Nationalism and had become one of his ardent admirers. It was upon Dayanand's inspiration, he set up a base in England at India House where were produced many revolutionaries like Madam Cama, Veer Savarkar, Lala Hardyal and Madan Lal Dhingra. Shyamji Krishan was also an admirer of Lokmanya Tilak and supported him during the Age of Consent bill controversy of 1890. However, he rejected the petitioning, praying, protesting, cooperating and collaborating policy of the Congress Party, which he considered undignified and shameful. In 1897, following the atrocities inflicted by the British government during the plague crisis in Poona, he supported the assassination of the Commissioner of Plague by the Chapekar brothers but he soon decided to fight for Indian Independence in Britain.  England  Ordained by Swami Dayanand Saraswati the founder of Arya samaj, Shyamji Krishan Verma upon his arrival in London stayed at the Inner Temple and studied Herbert Spencer's writings in his spare time. In 1900 he bought an expensive house in Highgate. His home became a base for all political leaders of India. Lokmanya Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Gandhi, Lenin etc., all visited him to discuss the Indian Independence Movement. Avoiding the Indian National Congress, he kept in contact with rationalists, free thinkers, national and social democrats, socialists, Irish republicans, etc. He was much inspired by Herbert Spencer's writings. At Spencer's funeral in 1903, he announced the donation of ¬£1,000 to establish a lectureship at University of Oxford in tribute to him and his work. A year later he announced that Herbert Spencer Indian fellowships of RS 2000 each were to be awarded to enable Indian graduates to finish their education in England. He had also announced additional fellowship in memory of the late Dayananda Saraswati, the founder of Arya Samaj, along with another four fellowships in the future.  Political activism  In 1905, Shyamji focused his activity as a political propagandist and organiser for the complete independence of India. Shyamji made his debut in Indian politics by publishing the first issue of his English monthly, The Indian Sociologist, an organ and of political, social and religious reform. This was an assertive, ideological monthly aimed at inspiring mass opposition to British rule, which stimulated many intellectuals to fight for the independence of India. = Indian Home Rule Society = On 18 February 1905, Shyamji inaugurated a new organisation called The Indian Home Rule Society. The first meeting, held at his Highgate home, unanimously decided to found The Indian Home Rule Society with the object of: #Securing Home Rule for India #Carrying on Propaganda in England by all practical means with a view to attain the same. #Spreading among the people of India the objectives of freedom and national unity. = India House = The Indian Sociologist, September 1908, London As many Indian students faced racist attitudes when seeking accommodations, he founded India House as a hostel for Indian students, based at 65, Cromwell Avenue, Highgate. This living accommodation for 25 students was formally inaugurated on 1 July by Henry Hyndman, of the Social Democratic Federation, in the presence of Dadabhai Naoroji, Lala Lajpat Rai, Madam Cama, Mr. Swinney (of the London Positivist Society), Mr. Harry Quelch (the editor of the Social Democratic Federation's Justice) and Charlotte Despard, the Irish Republican and suffragette. Declaring India House open, Hyndman remarked, \\"As things stands, loyalty to Great Britain means treachery to India. The institution of this India House means a great step in that direction of Indian growth and Indian emancipation, and some of those who are here this afternoon may live to witness the fruits of its triumphant success.\\" Shyamji hoped India House would incubate Indian revolutionaries and Bhikaiji Cama, S. R. Rana, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Virendranath Chattopadhyaya, and Lala Hardayal were all associated with it.‡§¨‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§µ‡§∞‡§π‡§ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§°‡•ã‡§ü ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§Ü‡§™‡§ï‡§æ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§ó‡§§ ‡§π‡•à. Beawarhistory.com. Retrieved on 7 December 2018. Later in 1905, Shyamji attended the United Congress of Democrats held at Holborn Town Hall as a delegate of the India Home Rule Society. His resolution on India received an enthusiastic ovation from the entire conference. Shyamji‚Äôs activities in England aroused the concern of the British government: He was disbarred from Inner Temple and removed from the membership list on 30 April 1909 for writing anti-British articles in The Indian Sociologist. Most of the British press were anti‚ÄìShyamji and carried outrageous allegations against him and his newspaper. He defended them boldly. The Times referred to him as the \\"Notorious Krishnavarma\\". Many newspapers criticised the British progressives who supported Shyamji and his view. His movements were closely watched by British Secret Services, so he decided to shift his headquarters to Paris, leaving India House in charge of Vir Savarkar. Shyamji left Britain secretly before the government tried to arrest him. = Paris and Geneva = He arrived in Paris in early 1907 to continue his work. The British government tried to have him extradited from France without success as he gained the support of many top French politicians. Shyamji‚Äôs name was dragged into the sensational trial of Mr Merlin, an Englishman, at Bow Street Magistrates' Court, for writing an article in liberators published by Shyamji‚Äôs friend, Mr. James. Shyamji's work in Paris helped gain support for Indian Independence from European countries. He agitated for the release of Savarker and acquired great support all over Europe and Russia. Guy Aldred wrote an article in the Daily Herald under the heading of \\"Savarker the Hindu Patriot whose sentences expire on 24 December 1960\\", helping create support in England, too. In 1914 his presence became an embarrassment as French politicians had invited King George V to Paris to set a final seal on the Entente Cordiale. Shyamji foresaw this and shifted his headquarters to Geneva. Here the Swiss government imposed political restrictions during the entire period of World War I. He kept in touch with his contacts, but he could not support them directly. He spent time with Dr. Briess, president of the Pro India Committee in Geneva, whom he later discovered was a paid secret agent of the British government.  Post-World War I  He offered a sum of 10,000 francs to the League of Nations to endow a lectureship to be called the President Woodrow Wilson Lectureship for the discourse on the best means of acquiring and safe guarding national independence consistently with freedom, justice, and the right of asylum accorded to political refugees. It is said that the league rejected his offer due to political pressure from British government. A similar offer was made to the Swiss government which was also turned down. He offered another lectureship at the banquet given by Press Association of Geneva where 250 journalists and celebrities, including the presidents of Swiss Federation and the League of Nations. Shyamji‚Äôs offer was applauded on the spot but nothing came of it. Shyamji was disappointed with the response and he published all his abortive correspondence on this matter in the next issue of the Sociologist appearing in December 1920, after a lapse of almost six years.  Death and commemoration  Shyamji Krishna Varma 1989 stamp of India Kranti Teerth, Shyamji Krishna Varma Memorial, Mandvi, Kutch (replica of India House is visible in background) He published two more issues of Indian Sociologist in August and September 1922, before ill health prevented him continuing. He died in hospital at 11:30 pm on 30 March 1930 leaving his wife, Bhanumati Krishnavarma. News of his death was suppressed by the British government in India. Nevertheless, tributes were paid to him by Bhagat Singh and other inmates in Lahore Jail where they were undergoing a long-term drawn-out trial. Maratha, an English daily newspaper started by Bal Gangadhar Tilak paid tribute to him. He had made prepaid arrangements with the local government of Geneva and St Georges cemetery to preserve his and his wife‚Äôs ashes at the cemetery for 100 years and to send their urns to India whenever it became independent during that period. Requested by Paris-based scholar Dr Prithwindra Mukherjee, the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi agreed to repatriate the ashes. Finally on 22 August 2003, the urns of ashes of Shyamji and his wife Bhanumati were handed over to then Chief Minister of Gujarat State Narendra Modi by the Ville de Gen√®ve and the Swiss government 55 years after Indian Independence. They were brought to Mumbai and after a long procession throughout Gujarat, they reached Mandvi, his birthplace. A memorial called Kranti Teerth dedicated to him was built and inaugurated in 2010 near Mandvi. Spread over 52 acres, the memorial complex houses a replica of India House building at Highgate along with statues of Shyamji Krishna Varma and his wife. Urns containing Krishna Verma's ashes, those of his wife, and a gallery dedicated to earlier activists of Indian independence movement is housed within the memorial. Krishna Verma was disbarred from the Inner Temple in 1909. This decision was revisited in 2015, and a unanimous decision taken to posthumously reinstated him. In the 1970s, a new town developed in his native state of Kutch, was named after him as Shyamji Krishna Varmanagar in his memory and honor. India Post released postal stamps and first day cover commemorating him. Kuchchh University was renamed after him. The India Post has issued a postal stamp on shyamji Krishna Varma on 4 October 1989.

History  Product of the reductive coupling of styrene with lithium, 1,4-dilithio-1,4-diphenylbutane. In the original work, Szwarc studied the analogous disodium compound. As early as 1936, Karl Ziegler proposed that anionic polymerization of styrene and butadiene by consecutive addition of monomer to an alkyl lithium initiator occurred without chain transfer or termination. Twenty years later, living polymerization was demonstrated by Szwarc and coworkers. In one of the breakthrough events in the field of polymer science, Szwarc elucidated that electron transfer occurred from radical anion of naphthalene to styrene. The results in the formation of a dianion (or equivalently disodio-) species, which rapidly added styrene to form a \\"two ‚Äì ended living polymer.\\" An important aspect of his work, Szwarc employed the aprotic solvent tetrahydrofuran. Being a physical chemist, Szwarc elucidated the kinetics and the thermodynamics of the process in considerable detail. At the same time, he explored the structure property relationship of the various ion pairs and radical ions involved. This work provided the foundations for the rational synthesis of polymers with control over molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and the architecture of the polymer.Smid, J.

DOI=10.1002/pola.10286 The use of alkali metals to initiate polymerization of 1,3-dienes led to the discovery by Stavely and co-workers at Firestone Tire and Rubber company of cis-1,4-polyisoprene.Odian, G. Ionic Chain Polymerization; In Principles of Polymerization; Wiley-Interscience: Staten Island, New York, 2004, pp. 372-463. This sparked the development of commercial anionic polymerization processes that utilize alkyllithium initiatiors.  Monomer characteristics  Two broad classes of monomers are susceptible to anionic polymerization. Vinyl monomers have the formula CH2=CHR, the most important are styrene (R= C6H5), butadiene (CH=CH2), and isoprene (R = C(Me)=CH2). A second major class of monomers are acrylate esters, such as acrylonitrile, methacrylate, cyanoacrylate, and acrolein. Other vinyl monomers include vinylpyridine, vinyl sulfone, vinyl sulfoxide, vinyl silanes. Examples of polar monomers Examples of vinyl monomers =Cyclic monomers= The anionic ring-opening polymerization of Œµ-caprolactone, initiated by alkoxide Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane is a cyclic monomer that is susceptible to anionic polymerization to siloxane polymers. Many cyclic compounds are susceptible to ring-opening polymerization. Epoxides, cyclic trisiloxanes, some lactones, lactides, cyclic carbonates, and amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides. In order for polymerization to occur with vinyl monomers, the substituents on the double bond must be able to stabilize a negative charge. Stabilization occurs through delocalization of the negative charge. Because of the nature of the carbanion propagating center, substituents that react with bases or nucleophiles either must not be present or be protected.  Initiation  Initiators is selected based on the reactivity of the monomers. Highly electrophilic monomers such as cyanoacrylates require only weakly nucleophilic initiators, such as amines, phosphines, or even halides. Less reactive monomers such as styrene require powerful nucleophiles such as butyl lithium. Reaction of intermediate strength are used for monomers of intermediate reactivity such as vinylpyridine. The solvent used in anionic addition polymerizations are determined by the reactivity of both the initiator and nature of the propagating chain end. Anionic species with low reactivity, such as heterocyclic monomers, can use a wide range of solvents. =Initiation by electron transfer= Initiation of styrene polymerization with sodium naphthalene proceeds by electron transfer from the naphthalene radical anion to the monomer. The resulting radical dimerizes to give a dilithio compound, which then functions as the initiator. Polar solvents are necessary for this type of initiation both for stability of the anion-radical and to solvate the cation species formed. The anion-radical can then transfer an electron to the monomer. Initiation can also involve the transfer of an electron from the alkali metal to the monomer to form an anion- radical. Initiation occurs on the surface of the metal, with the reversible transfer of an electron to the adsorbed monomer. =Initiation by strong anions= Nucleophilic initiators include covalent or ionic metal amides, alkoxides, hydroxides, cyanides, phosphines, amines and organometallic compounds (alkyllithium compounds and Grignard reagents). The initiation process involves the addition of a neutral (B:) or negative (B:-) nucleophile to the monomer. The most commercially useful of these initiators has been the alkyllithium initiators. They are primarily used for the polymerization of styrenes and dienes. Monomers activated by strong electronegative groups may be initiated even by weak anionic or neutral nucleophiles (i.e. amines, phosphines). Most prominent example is the curing of cyanoacrylate, which constitutes the basis for superglue. Here, only traces of basic impurities are sufficient to induce an anionic addition polymerization or zwitterionic addition polymerization, respectively.Pepper, D.C. Zwitterionic Chain Polymerizations of Cyanoacrylates. Macromolecular Symposia; 1992,60,pp. 267-277. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/masy.19920600124/abstract  Propagation  Organolithium-initiated polymerization of styrene Propagation in anionic addition polymerization results in the complete consumption of monomer. This stage is often fast, even at low temperatures. Living anionic polymerization Living anionic polymerization is a living polymerization technique involving an anionic propagating species. Living anionic polymerization was demonstrated by Szwarc and co workers in 1956. Their initial work was based on the polymerization of styrene and dienes. One of the remarkable features of living anionic polymerization is that the mechanism involves no formal termination step. In the absence of impurities, the carbanion would still be active and capable of adding another monomer. The chains will remain active indefinitely unless there is inadvertent or deliberate termination or chain transfer. This gave rise to two important consequences: # The number average molecular weight, Mn, of the polymer resulting from such a system could be calculated by the amount of consumed monomer and the initiator used for the polymerization, as the degree of polymerization would be the ratio of the moles of the monomer consumed to the moles of the initiator added. #: M_n = M_o \\\\frac {[\\\\mbox{M}]_o} {[\\\\mbox{I}]} , where Mo = formula weight of the repeating unit, [M]o = initial concentration of the monomer, and [I] = concentration of the initiator. # All the chains are initiated at roughly the same time. The final result is that the polymer synthesis can be done in a much more controlled manner in terms of the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution (Poisson distribution). The following experimental criteria have been proposed as a tool for identifying a system as living polymerization system. * Polymerization until the monomer is completely consumed and until further monomer is added. * Constant number of active centers or propagating species. * Poisson distribution of molecular weight * Chain end functionalization can be carried out quantitatively. However, in practice, even in the absence of terminating agents, the concentration of the living anions will reduce with time due to a decay mechanism termed as spontaneous termination.Odian, G. Ionic Chain Polymerization; In Principles of Polymerization; Wiley-Interscience: Staten Island, New York, 2004, pp. 372-463. Consequences of living polymerization =Block copolymers= Synthesis of block copolymers is one of the most important applications of living polymerization as it offers the best control over structure. The nucleophilicity of the resulting carbanion will govern the order of monomer addition, as the monomer forming the less nucleophilic propagating species may inhibit the addition of the more nucleophilic monomer onto the chain. An extension of the above concept is the formation of triblock copolymers where each step of such a sequence aims to prepare a block segment with predictable, known molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution without chain termination or transfer.Hsieh, H.;Quirk, R. Anionic Polymerization: Principles and practical applications; Marcel Dekker, Inc: New York, 1996. Sequential monomer addition is the dominant method, also this simple approach suffers some limitations. Moreover, this strategy, enables synthesis of linear block copolymer structures that are not accessible via sequential monomer addition. For common A-b-B structures, sequential block copolymerization gives access to well defined block copolymers only if the crossover reaction rate constant is significantly higher than the rate constant of the homopolymerization of the second monomer, i.e., kAA >> kBB. =End-group functionalization/termination= One of the remarkable features of living anionic polymerization is the absence of a formal termination step. In the absence of impurities, the carbanion would remains active, awaiting the addition of new monomer. Termination can occur through unintentional quenching by impurities, often present in trace amounts. Typical impurities include oxygen, carbon dioxide, or water. Termination intentionally allows the introduction of tailored end groups. Living anionic polymerization allow the incorporation of functional end-groups, usually added to quench polymerization. End-groups that have been used in the functionalization of Œ±-haloalkanes include hydroxide, -NH2, -OH, -SH, -CHO,-COCH3, -COOH, and epoxides. Addition of hydroxide group through an epoxide. An alternative approach for functionalizing end-groups is to begin polymerization with a functional anionic initiator. In this case, the functional groups are protected since the ends of the anionic polymer chain is a strong base. This method leads to polymers with controlled molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions.Quirk, R. Anionic Polymerization.

The book describes Edmund's early years in an exceptionally devout Plymouth Brethren home. His mother, who died early and painfully of breast cancer, was a writer of Christian tracts. His father, Philip Henry Gosse, was an influential, though largely self-taught, invertebrate zoologist and student of marine biology who, after his wife's death, took Edmund to live in Devon.

It involves a sometimes disparate set of theories and approaches, with work stretching from epidemiological survey research on the one hand, to an indistinct boundary with individual or group psychotherapy on the other. Social psychiatry combines a medical training and perspective with fields such as social anthropology, social psychology, cultural psychiatry, sociology and other disciplines relating to mental distress and disorder. Social psychiatry has been particularly associated with the development of therapeutic communities, and to highlighting the effect of socioeconomic factors on mental illness. Social psychiatry can be contrasted with biopsychiatry, with the latter focused on genetics, brain neurochemistry and medication. Social psychiatry was the dominant form of psychiatry for periods of the 20th century but is currently less visible than biopsychiatry. After reviewing the history and activities of social psychiatry, Vincenzo Di Nicola reviews three major questions for social psychiatry and concludes with a manifesto for a 21st century social psychiatry: # What is social about psychiatry? This addresses definitional problems that arise, such as binary thinking, and the need for a common language. # What are the theory and practice of social psychiatry? Issues include social psychiatry's core principles, values, and operational criteria; the social determinants of health and the Global Mental Health (GMH) Movement; and the need for translational research. This part of the review establishes the minimal criteria for a coherent theory of social psychiatry and the view of persons that emerges from such a theory, the social self. # Why the time has come for a manifesto for social psychiatry. This manifesto outlines the parameters for a theory of social psychiatry, based on both the social self and the social determinants of health, to offer an inclusive social definition of health, concluding with a call for action. History The events of the first half of the 20th century brought the issue of the relationship between the individual and the community to the fore. Psychiatrists who showed a willingness to confront these issues at home, after the war, called themselves social psychiatrists. Psychoanalytic psychotherapy and all its offshoots were grounded in an approach to the patient that focused almost exclusively on the individual‚Äîthe relational aspects of therapy were implicit in the relationship between therapist and patient, but the main source of problem and motivation for change was seen as being intrapsychic (within the individual). The social and political contexts were largely disregarded. Sarason observed in 1981, that \\"it is as though society does not exist for the psychologist. Society is a vague, amorphous background that can be disregarded in one's efforts to fathom the laws of behavior\\" (Sarason 1981). Early landmarks in social psychiatry included: Karen Horney, MD, who wrote about personality as it interacts with other people (1937); Erik Erikson, who discussed the influence of society on development (1950); Harry Stack Sullivan's (1953) integration of sociological and psychodynamic concepts, and his work on the role of early interpersonal interactions in the development of the self; Cornell University's Midtown Manhattan Study, which looked at the prevalence of mental illness in Manhattan; August Hollingshead, PhD, and Frederick Redlich, MD, looked at the influence of social class on psychiatric conditions (1958); Alexander H. Leighton, MD, looked at the relationship between social disintegration and mental illness (1959); Burrow was an early pioneer of the social causes of mental disorder and suggested \\"Sociatry\\" as the name for this new discipline. Over the years many sociologists have contributed theories and research which has enlightened psychiatry in this area (e.g. Avison and Robins); The relationship between social factors and mental illness was demonstrated by the early work of Hollingshead and Readlich in Chicago in the 1930s, who found a high concentration of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia in deprived areas of the city has been replicated numerous times throughout the world, although controversy still exists as to the extent of drift of vulnerable individuals to these areas or of a higher incidence of the disorder in the socially disadvantaged; the Midtown Manhattan Study conducted in the 1950s by Cornell University hinted at widespread psychopathology among the general population of New York City (Srole, Sanger, Michael, Opler, and Rennie, 1962); the Three Hospitals Study (Wing JK and Brown GW, Social Treatments of Chronic Schizophrenia: a comparative survey of three mental hospitals, 1961, Journal of Mental Science, 107, 847-861) was a very influential work that has been replicated, that demonstrated forcefully that the poverty of the environment in poor mental hospitals lead to greater handicaps in the patients. Social psychiatry was instrumental in the development of therapeutic communities. Under the influence of Maxwell Jones, Main, Wilmer and others (Caudill 1958; Rapoport 1960), combined with the publications of critiques of the existing mental health system (Greenblatt et al. 1957, Stanton and Schwartz 1954) and the sociopolitical influences that permeated the psychiatric world, the concept of the therapeutic community and its attenuated form‚Äîthe therapeutic milieu‚Äîcaught on and dominated the field of inpatient psychiatry throughout the 1960s. The aim of therapeutic communities was a more democratic, user-led form of therapeutic environment, avoiding the authoritarian and demeaning practices of many psychiatric establishments of the time. The central philosophy is that clients are active participants in their own and each other's mental health treatment and that responsibility for the daily running of the community is shared among the clients and the staff. \\"TCs\\" have often eschewed or limited medication in favor of psychoanalytically-derived group- based insight therapies. Current work Social psychiatry can be most effectively applied in helping to develop mental health promotion and prevent certain mental illnesses by educating individuals, families, and societies. Social psychiatry has been important in developing the concept of major \\"life events\\" as precipitants of mental ill health, including, for example, bereavement, promotion, moving house, or having a child. Originally inpatient centers, many therapeutic communities now operate as day centers, often focused on borderline personality disorder and run by psychotherapists or art therapists rather than psychiatrists. Social psychiatrists help test the cross-cultural use of psychiatric diagnoses and assessments of need or disadvantage, showing particular links between mental illness and unemployment, overcrowding and single parent families. Social psychiatrists also work to link concepts such as self-esteem and self-efficacy to mental health, and in turn to socioeconomic factors. Social psychiatrists work on social firms in regard to people with mental health problems. These are regular businesses in the market that employ a significant number of people with disabilities, who are paid regular wages and work on the basis of regular work contracts. There are approximately 2,000 social firms in Europe and a large percentage of people with disabilities who work in social firms have a psychiatric disability. Some are specifically for people with psychiatric disabilities.(Schwarz, G. & Higgins, G: Marienthal the social firms network Supporting the Development of Social Firms in Europe, UK, 1999) Social psychiatrists often focus on rehabilitation in a social context, rather than \\"treatment\\" per se. A related approach is community psychiatry. Facilitating the social inclusion of people with mental health problems is a major focus of modern social psychiatry.

Quire first appeared in New X-Men #134 (January, 2003). He was created by writer Grant Morrison and artist Frank Quitely. Publication history Quire made his first appearance in New X-Men #134 (January 2003). His first appearance as Kid Omega and the first appearance of the Omega Gang were in New X-Men #135 (February 2003). Grant Morrison has cited The Sekhmet Hypothesis as an influence on the story as well as Quire's angry punk rock aesthetic, referring to it in his book, Supergods. Fictional character biography =Xavier Institute= Quentin Quire joins the student body of the Xavier Institute after Professor X's return from averting a war with Genosha and the rebuilding of the X-Mansion. He immediately stands out as a brilliant intellect and quickly becomes Xavier's prize pupil. Xavier teaches Quire to control his powers when they first appear. The extent and type of his mutant abilities are never clearly defined. Quire appears to be a very powerful telepath, and the Stepford Cuckoos describe him as having a 'see-through mind', but he is not necessarily limited to that.New X-Men #134 (January 2003) Quentin often associates with Glob Herman and has a crush on Sophie, one of the Stepford Cuckoos. However, something about Quire disturbs the Cuckoos, though Emma Frost dismisses it as academic rivalry. =Omega Gang: New X-Men= While a student at Xavier's, Quire invents the anti-gravity floats for Martha Johansson's brain canister, and exposes the charisma-powered Slick's true, ugly body to the other students. On his birthday, Quentin receives a call from his parents, who tell him he was adopted. This seems to destabilize him. He goes to town, getting a haircut reminiscent of Bolivar Trask's depiction of a mutant overlord from a newspaper that was published the day Quire was born. Quire becomes strongly opposed to a policy of tolerance with humans, calling for vengeance for the recently murdered mutant designer Jumbo Carnation. He takes to wearing clothing based on the Trask mutant overlord illustration, which happens to be one of Jumbo's creations. He also debates with Professor X the merits of his dream of humans and mutants living in peace, and the school policies based on this idea. He questions whether Xavier would allow any dream other than his own to exist.New X-Men #135 (February 2003) Shortly afterward, Quire and a group of like-minded students visit town wearing the Trask-overlord clothes, and Quire convinces them to take the mutant drug Kick. They accost a gang of humans in an alley and kill or maim them all. When Herman asks what had happened to a human Quentin himself had murdered, Quire replies he had carved his name across the man's mind. Back at school, Xavier confronts the students, but Quire is not implicated. Quire and his gang later go to a mutant tattooist and have their arms marked with an Omega symbol over an X, then attack U-Men Central. Returning to school, the \\"Omega Gang\\" ambushes Professor X with a baseball bat and clamps his head in a thought-proof helmet. The next day, at the school's \\"Open Day\\" to parents and the media, Quire publicly proclaims it is \\"open season on humans\\" and starts a riot.New X-Men #136 (March 2003) =\\"Riot at Xavier's\\"= Some of the students join Quire in protesting Xaviers' policies, but most of the damage is done by the Omegas themselves. They are finally subdued by Beast, Cyclops, Emma Frost and Xorn. However, with Quire still guarding Professor X, the situation threatens to continue. Quire even mentally subdues Wolverine with a memory of his past life. Xavier eventually frees himself of the helmet and confronts Quentin, calling his thought-proof helmet and his plans of revolution \\"flimsy\\". However, the altercation is not officially ended until the Stepford Cuckoos, led by Sophie, use Cerebra and a dose of mutant drug Kick to boost their shared powers. They blast through to the grounds and confront Quire, who confesses that his motivation for the ordeal was to impress Sophie, to whom he is attracted. This uniformly disgusts the Cuckoos, who mock his motivations and defeat him with a massive telepathic shockwave. Disoriented, Quentin apologizes. He confesses that he started everything not only because of his desire to impress Sophie, but also because of his own disrupted sense of identity upon discovering he was adopted. Emma Frost chastises him for his recklessness, as she reveals the now deceased Sophie in her arms. After discovering this revelation and overloading on his own abilities, Quire immediately enters a catatonic state.New X-Men #137 (April 2003) Quire is taken to the Infirmary, where Henry McCoy tries to stabilize him, but his body is being burnt out by his own psionic energy. This is apparently the result of his overdoses of Kick, which cause a secondary mutation that changes his brain into faster-than-light energy. Apparently this simultaneously puts him in telepathic contact with everyone on the planet across time. Seeing that Quire is terminal, Professor X calls for Xorn. He opens his helmet to expose Quire to the mini star in his head, and Quire \\"left the mortal plane\\". Quire's final words when Xorn \\"heals\\" him are vaguely prophetic of many of the coming events in Morrison's final run of New X-Men. This includes the foreshadowing of events such as Xorn later being revealed to be Magneto, Xorn's eventual destruction of Manhattan, and the actions of Sublime, a bacterial entity that claims to be the cause of some of the human/mutant hatred and aggression occurring. The incident forces the Professor to resign as headmaster, leaving Jean Grey to lead the school and X-Men.New X-Men #138 (May 2003) =\\"A Higher Plane of Existence\\"= However, Quire is not truly dead and Professor Xavier announces to the student body that he believes Quire has ascended to a higher plane of existence. Quentin remains in a dormant, semi-alive, energy form in a containment unit on Beast's lab table. The potential future shown in the New X-Men story \\"Here Comes Tomorrow\\" indicated that Quentin is destined to become an avatar for the Phoenix Force. A young boy, wearing a Phoenix costume and Quentin's distinct pink haircut, is seen telling Jean Grey, who vaguely recognizes him, that she doesn't have long to set the events in the timeline right.New X-Men #154 (May 2004) A few months later in X-Men: Phoenix ‚Äì Endsong, when a fragment of the shattered Phoenix Force returns to Earth, it senses Quire and investigates him, thinking he might be Jean Grey. Though the Phoenix passes up Quire, it shocks him back to consciousness and he reconstitutes his body. Furthermore, he seeks out and reanimates Sophie's corpse, but is unable to complete the process, so he sets off to find the Phoenix Force so he can be with his love. Quire finds the Phoenix, which has resurrected Jean Grey to attract Cyclops' attention, engaged in battle with the X-Men. Just prior to his arrival on the scene, the X-Men get the Phoenix to inhabit Emma Frost, Cyclops's current lover, and imprisons both her and Scott inside a containment vessel. Quire arrives and breaks the containment chamber open, releasing the Phoenix fragment. Quentin then asks the Phoenix to resurrect Sophie, which it does. Sophie is still disgusted by him (and/or his actions) and chooses to return to death. Quire breaks down in anguish, and the Phoenix leaves him to his \\"sickness\\". Having spent too much of his energy, Quire apologizes to the X-Men for his rash behavior and returns to his non-corporeal state in the container in Beast's lab.X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong #5 (June 2005) =Nation X= Beast brings Quentin's container to his lab on Utopia after the X-Mansion is abandoned. Finding life on a higher plane to be \\"boring,\\" Quentin revives himself and decides to become a villain and secretly destroy Utopia, claiming that the X-Men stole his idea to create a mutant nation. He elects to make his endeavor a game and selects Martha (a disembodied mutant brain with telepathic abilities living in a life support container) to be his nemesis, giving her seven and a half minutes to stop him. Martha attempts to alert the X-Men and locate Quentin, but he intercepts and taunts her at each attempt, ultimately smashing her container and leaving her to die. Martha realizes that Quentin has infiltrated Cerebra in order to destroy the island and take revenge on the Stepford Cuckoos by putting them in a mental loop. Martha breaks the Cuckoos free, and they quickly defeat Quire. =\\"Schism\\"= Quire returns in the X-Men arc \\"Schism\\", after being secretly broken out of the X-Men's prison by Kade Kilgore, the new Black King of the Hellfire Club. Thinking his containment unit just malfunctioned, Quire decides to celebrate his new freedom by infiltrating an international arms conference in Switzerland (where Scott Summers was to be giving a talk) and forcing the top leaders of the world to reveal their deepest, darkest secrets on camera.X-Men: Schism #1 (September 2011) After this stunt, he becomes the most hunted mutant on Earth and seeks refuge on Utopia. Instead of handing him over to Captain Steve Rogers like Wolverine suggests, Cyclops orders that Quire be put back into containment so he can be tried by a jury of his peers after the trouble that Quire caused is resolved.X-Men: Schism #2 (September 2011) After the events of \\"Schism\\", Quire is considered one of the world's worst terrorists. Feeling that jail would only make Quentin's sociopathic tendencies worse, Wolverine strikes a deal with Captain America. He is released into Wolverine's custody and Quire is to attend the newly reformed Jean Grey Institute for Higher Learning in an effort to rehabilitate him. Nobody consulted Cyclops on this.X-Men: Regenesis (December 2011) =Wolverine and the X-Men= Quentin Quire is shown in promotional art for Wolverine and the X-Men #1 as a member of Wolverine's post-Schism team. In issue #3 of that series, Quire helps Wolverine's team by successfully reasoning with an offshoot of Krakoa.Wolverine and the X-Men #3 (February 2012) Later, while helping Wolverine con a \\"space casino\\" out of money needed for the school, Quire is able to manifest and use what he calls a \\"psychic shotgun,\\" which is very similar to the psychic swords used by characters like Psylocke.Wolverine and the X-Men #7 (May 2012) Quire faces off against Wolverine in a mental construct of his own devising in an attempt both to show Wolverine who is tougher and to punish him. This incident draws in Armor, a fellow student. Quire finds the effort extremely taxing to the point where he loses control of his own creation, leaving Wolverine's body a beastly, raging nightmare hellbent on killing Quentin. The limited series is titled Wolverine and the X-Men: Alpha & Omega, which is written by Brian Wood. Over time, Quire begins to accept his fellow students by first helping them save the faculty after Frankenstein's Circus hypnotizes them against the student body, working as a team during a field trip to the Savage Land in which Wolverine's half-brother Dog Logan makes an unexpected appearance, and in A+X, he assists Captain America in a mission against an army of MODOK clones as part of his punishment for what he did at the UN conference in Switzerland. During Infinity, Quire is chosen as one of the few students to represent Wolverine's school in a friendly competition among similar schools for super-youngsters. This 'Contest of Champions' is attacked by an alien armada. Quire witnesses fellow student Crimson being flattened right next to him. Ultimately, Quire's telepathy is essential in the other students joining together to defeat an alien giant.\\"Infinity: The Hunt\\" #1-4 (2013) After several members of the Jean Grey School defected to join the new Hellfire Academy, Quentin followed them, hoping to discover why Idie Okonkwo switched sides. After gaining entrance to the Hellfire Academy, it was discovered that Quentin did not change allegiances but was looking for Idie. This led to Quentin getting \\"detention\\", in which he was beaten, until Toad helped him escape his tormentors. While trying to escape, Quentin and Toad were confronted by the other students of the academy. Together with Idie and Wolverine's X-Men, they defeat the Hellfire Academy and he returns to the school. Quentin later graduates and becomes a graduate student/assistant at the school. In Battle of the Atom, he comes face to face with his future Phoenix self and begins to question his stay at the school. Due to his anger towards Logan and others, Quire later breaks off association with the facility when he becomes independently wealthy and leaves the school to join the Phoenix Corporation, later becoming the new White King of the Hellfire Club. However, he finds himself not quite able to enjoy the riches and fame because he saw his own death on a time travel adventure. Wolverine and Iron Man try to bring Quire out of his self-imposed isolation but fail.\\"Wolverine and the X-Men\\" #9 (2014) The events of AXIS and Wolverine's death cause him to finally return to the Jean Grey School and help both the Avengers and X-Men battle Red Onslaught. =Generation X= When Kitty Pryde relocated the X-Men in New York and the school was renamed to Xavier Institute for Mutant Education and Outreach, Quentin was forced to join in. He became part of Jubilee's team, which consisted of Nathaniel Carver, Benjamin Deeds, Lin Li, Bling! and Eye- Boy.Generation X (Vol 2) #2 When a mysterious shadow in Central Park started stealing mutants during the night, Quentin convinced his classmates to investigate. They found themselves face-to-face with Emplate, who was possessing his sister Monet's body at the time.Generation X (Vol 2) #3-4 After defeating the Rat King, Quentin convinced Benjamin and Nathaniel to join him for a night out. They were stuck in a villain-infested auction, where they had to destroy a priceless weapon, all without getting caught by the auctioneer, Kade Kilgore.Generation X (Vol 2) #6-7 =\\"The Phoenix\\"= Having become fed up with people, Quentin decided to exile himself from society and live in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with Krakoa taking the shape of a small desert island. Quentin's little vacation was interrupted by Thor, who had been directed by Kid Gladiator and Warbird for help after a conflict with the Shi'ar escalated to a cosmic scale. Thor had been forced to compete against the Shi'ar gods K'ythri and Sharra in a contest to prove her godhood,Mighty Thor (Vol 2) #6 and since they lost, the Shi'ar gods had conjured the Phoenix Force to have it lay waste to all of reality. Quentin psychically attacked the Phoenix, allowing Thor to access the White Hot Room and fight it. Quentin then used Thor's attacks as an opening to enter the White Hot Room himself and negotiate with the Phoenix. As a result of Quentin's proposition, the Phoenix allowed him to absorb a small portion of itself. In the end, K'ythri and Sharra were arrested and taken to Omnipotence City for their actions. As the Shi'ar were left without their gods, the newly Phoenix-empowered Quentin was proposed by Shadrak as a substitute to fill their role, and so became the New God of the Shi'ar as the Phoenix.Mighty Thor (Vol 2) #19 This arrangement apparently didn't last, though, as Quentin appeared back on Earth and resumed his self-imposed exile on Krakoa.Generation X (Vol 2) #85 During the \\"Empyre\\" storyline, Quentin Quire is among the psychic mutants that are summoned to Genosha.Empyre: X-Men #2. Marvel Comics. He is among those who witness Magik's fight with the Cotatinaught.Empyre: X-Men #4. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities In New X-Men, Quire is depicted as an Omega level mutant possessing advanced cognitive and telepathic abilities that enable him to organize and construct his thoughts at accelerated rates, overtly or covertly manipulate the minds of others, resist mind probes, and disable other forms of psychic manipulation. His level of psychic influence on others depends on the number of individuals he wishes to affect ‚Äî his influence is strongest among fewer individuals and subtler in large numbers of people. Xavier explains that Quentin's psychic powers are \\"deep, subtle, and he's able to influence minds around him\\". Emma Frost also states that his mind processes several thousand \\"brilliant\\" thoughts a second. Given that Quire is under the influence of the drug Kick for much of his time at the academy, it is unknown how much his power was being boosted by its effects. However, after the events of \\"Schism\\", Quire is shown to have most of his telepathic and telekinetic powers still intact, even without Kick. His powers also seem to continue to develop, as Quire is able to manifest and use a \\"psychic shotgun\\", as well as other firearms and explosives, much in the same way other mutants (such as Psylocke) can manifest swords with their minds. He has also been shown to create an entire universe, which he calls \\"The Construct\\", within his mind, allowing him to imprison others within this world. In the miniseries X-Men: Phoenix ‚Äì Endsong, Quire generates massive amounts of telekinetic energy which manifest in the form of tentacles, allowing him to break free of his containment chamber, blast through the Xavier School's foundation, pull Sophie's body out of the ground, restructure it a bit, instantly heal wounds on his body inflicted through Wolverine's claws, and fly at supersonic speed. Quentin Quire has existed without a body as a form of energy inside a jar. He is also depicted as being an alternate reality host of the Phoenix Force in the White Hot Room, suggesting that he can potentially be a host to the Phoenix. Quentin is apparently destined to become a Phoenix Avatar in more than one reality as further revealed by the Battle of the Atom storyline, where an alternate future version of Quire is a member of the future X-Men as well as a Phoenix avatar, having taken the codename \\"Phoenix\\".All-New X-Men #17 (2013) Omega Gang The Omega Gang is a group of teenage mutants and enemies of the X-Men. Created by comics writer Grant Morrison, the gang first appears in New X-Men #135 but is not named until New X-Men #140, when Lucas Bishop asks to interview them. The Omega Gang is formed by Quentin Quire, a young telepath and one of the top students of the Xavier Institute. Quire has become depressed because of an unrequited crush on Sophie of the Stepford Cuckoos; his unpopular status among the Institute students; and especially the revelation that he was an adopted child, which shatters his already fragile self-esteem. The death of mutant fashion designer Jumbo Carnation prompts Quire to gather a small group of students to exact revenge on Carnation's murderers. The Omega Gang symbol At Quire's request, all members tattoo themselves with a symbol formed by an Omega with an X below it and dress up with red-and-black striped shirts, jeans and whips. This is an outfit designed by Carnation himself and based on an illustration from an anti-mutant article written by Bolivar Trask many years ago, which portrayed mutants enslaving the human race. The Omega Gang members also consume the drug Kick in order to boost their powers. Unbeknownst to them, the drug is actually the aerosol form of the sentient bacteria Sublime, which seeks to increase the violence between mutants and baseline humans. The gang is responsible for the attack on a teenage anti-mutant gang and later for the Open Day Riots. During the riots, Professor X is injured and Dummy of the Special Class, a gas-composed mutant, is seemingly destroyed when his containment suit is pierced. The most notable victim is Sophie of the Stepford Cuckoos, who dies in her heroic attempt to stop Quentin. The rest of the Gang is stopped by the efforts of the other X-Men. Other versions =Age of Apocalypse= In this harsh reality it is revealed that Quentin was examined by the Shadow King and found to be an unstable, mildly talented telepath with apparently no usefulness to Weapon Omega. Quentin finds a way to create a kind of \\"psychic pyramid scheme\\" known as the Overmind by using minor \\"dreg\\" telepaths, the Mind Dolls, and uses this to increase his own limited skills, something the Shadow King didn't expected or even dreamed off. Sensing the boy's growing mental abilities, the Shadow King puts a bounty on him.Age of Apocalypse #5 (September 2012) Prophet, leader of a group of human freedom fighters, and Jean Grey tries to recruit him as an ally, however he takes instead Jean Grey into the mindscape and tries to force her into unleashing the Phoenix Force so he could increase more his own mental abilities, unaware that Jean had become powerless and the Phoenix Force has left her. Jean quickly understands that Quentin is losing control over his powers and is falling into madness. She tries to help him but at the end, he dies by turning a gun on himself to bring peace to his fractured mind. His suicide appeared to be a ruse as he was later seen alive and well with the Overmind. He confronts the Shadow King in his penthouse apartment, where the Shadow King managed to easily kill the Mind Dolls, yet he finds himself unable to defeat Quentin who reveals himself to be actually Goodnight in disguise. As it turns out, Prophet had secretly cloned Quentin's powerful mutant brain in order to be used to trap the Shadow King. Unable to navigate Quentin's labyrinth of a mind, the Shadow King was successfully taken off the board before the final battle against Weapon Omega.Age of Apocalypse #11 (March 2013) =Exiles= In Exiles: Days of Then and Now, Quentin Quire is one of the surviving heroes during the Annihilation Wave. It is led to Earth by a banished Hulk, who has killed Annihilus. Quentin leads a group that includes Lightspeed, Patriot, Speedball, Wiccan, and three of the Stepford Cuckoos: Sophie, Esme, and Mindee. Quentin has begun a relationship with Sophie, whose powers have changed to include limited precognition. After listening to Sophie's dream about a group of heroes that help restore order within damaged realities called the Exiles, Quentin goes on an interdimensional mission to find the original Exiles. Instead, he eventually recruits a group of heroes from the worlds he visits into a new group of Exiles. In the reality where he meets and recruits Nighthawk, he comes up against an alternate version of himself.Exiles: Days of Then and Now (March 2008) =House of M= In the \\"House of M\\" storyline, Quentin, along with most of the New X-Men characters, appears as a student of the New Mutant Leadership Institute. Upon confronting the spying Wallflower and boasting that no one could stop his mind, Wallflower uses her pheromones to fill him with self- loathing, forcing him to commit mental suicide. In this version, Quentin retains his more clean-cut appearance.New X-Men vol. 2, #16 (September 2005) =Post-Graduation= An adult Quire is now host to the Phoenix Force. He returns to the now defunct Jean Grey School for Higher Learning to confront his nemesis, Wolverine. Backed up only by bamfs, Wolverine is confronted with Quire's newest surprise: two million Negative Zone mutants in need of schooling. However, Logan relishes his new-found role as teacher and welcomes them in.Wolverine and the X-Men vol. 1 #42 (April 2014) =Ultimate Marvel= Quentin Quire has recently appeared in the Ultimate Universe, offering comfort and mind therapy to Rogue, who has been traumatised over all she has seen and done. He is also featured as a mutant under the care of Nick Fury.Ultimate Comics: X-Men #18 (December 2012) =What If= An alternate version of Quentin briefly appears in the What If: Rise & Fall of the Shi'ar Empire one- shot. After Vulcan is transported into the White Hot Room, he tells Vulcan that he is not meant to be there. He is ultimately killed by Vulcan. In other media =Film= A character called \\"Kid Omega\\" appears in the movie X-Men: The Last Stand, but is modeled after the character Quill rather than Quentin Quire. This was admitted as a typo in the commentary for the movie, where the character is instead referred to as \\"Quill\\". A character modeled after the character would later cameo in X-Men: Dark Phoenix.https://www.cbr.com/x-men-dark-phoenix-quentin-quire-photos/ =Video Games= * Kid Omega appears as playable character in Marvel Future Fight.https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2019/09/kitty-pryde-rachel-summers-kid- omega-and-the-danger-room-come-to-marvel-future-fight/ References Category:Comics characters introduced in 2002 Category:Characters created by Frank Quitely Category:Characters created by Grant Morrison Category:Fictional avatars Category:Male characters in comics Category:Marvel Comics mutants Category:Marvel Comics superheroes Category:Marvel Comics supervillains Category:Marvel Comics telepaths ","title":"Quentin Quire"},{"id":"2148942","text":"Henri du Vergier, comte de la Rochejaquelein (30 August 1772 - 28 January 1794)George J.

Sadlier & Co. n.d.), pp. 154-155. was the youngest general of the Royalist Vend√©an insurrection during the French Revolution. A commander-in-chief of the Catholic and Royal Army at the age of 21, he is regarded as one of the most courageous officers in French military history. Biography =Early activities= Born in the Ch√¢teau de la Durbelli√®re, Saint-Aubin-de-Baubign√©, near Ch√¢tillon, La Rochejaquelein joined the Royal Polish Regiment, of which his father was colonel, in 1787.Chronicle of the French Revolution p. 43 Longman Group 1989. In February 1789 he became a member of the Flanders regiment of chasseurs.Chronicle of the French Revolution p. 83 Longman Group 1989. In March 1792 he became a member of the Constitutional Guard, charged with protecting the King of France.Chronicle of the French Revolution p. 256 Longman Group 1989. He fought for the first time defending the Tuileries Palace on the 10 August 1792 attack, as an officer of the Constitutional Guard of King Louis XVI. Returning to his home province, he refused to comply with the lev√©e en masse called by the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars and joined his cousin Louis Marie de Lescure on the latter's estates in Poitou. =Rebellion= Henri de La Rochejacquelein at the Battle of Cholet in 1793, by Paul-√âmile Boutigny, Resistance to conscription soon escalated into a full rebellion, known as the War in the Vend√©e. Soon after, De la Rochejaquelein and his compatriots started fighting the troops of the French Republic with Maurice d'Elb√©e and the Marquis de Bonchamps from April 1793. There, he gave his famous order, \\"Mes amis, si j'avance, suivez- moi! Si je recule, tuez-moi! Si je meurs, vengez-moi!\\" (literal translation: \\"Friends, if I advance, follow me! If I retreat, kill me! If I die, avenge me!\\"). Leading a few thousand Vend√©an peasants, De la Rochejaquelein gained his first victory over the French Revolutionary Army on 13 April, took part to the taking of Bressuire on 3 May,Chronicle of the French Revolution p. 336 Longman Group 1989. in the Battle of Fontenay-le-Comte on 25 May and in the Battle of Saumur on 9 June. At Fontenay he was famous for his contempt for danger, wearing three red handkerchiefs; on his head, around his neck and at his waist to defy the Republican gunners.Pernoud, G. & Flaissier, S. The French Revolution, p. 300 Secker & Warburg 1960. After Fontenay his companions decided that they would also wear three red handkerchiefs so that De la Rochejacquelin could not be singled out.Chronicle of the French Revolution p. 338 Longman Group 1989. In August, after the Battle of Lu√ßon, he regrouped the Vend√©an army, which was on the verge of being disbanded, and won the Battle of Chantonnay on 5 September. On 13 September the thumb of his right hand was shattered by a bullet during an engagement with Republicans at Martign√©-Briand but he continued to fire at his opponents. His famous portrait by Pierre- Narcisse Gu√©rin shows him with his right arm in a sling, shooting with his left hand.Chronicle of the French Revolution p. 367 Longman Group 1989. He had to retreat across the Loire after being beaten in the Battle of Cholet, on 17 October. =Final months= The Death of Henri de La Rochejaquelein, painting by Alexandre Bloch On 20 October, De la Rochejaquelein was unanimously elected as commander-in-chief of the Catholic and Royal Army, replacing D'Elb√©e who had been severely wounded in Cholet. However, his bravery did not compensate for his lack of experience and strategic skills. He marched onto Granville, took Avranches on 12 November but failed to seize Granville and retreated to Angers in order to cross the Loire. Larger forces under Fran√ßois S√©verin Marceau, Jean Baptiste Kl√©ber, and Fran√ßois Joseph Westermann gave chase, defeating him once in Le Mans on 12 December and again, more severely, on 23 December in Savenay. After this decisive rout, the Catholic and Royal Army was no longer a fighting force; De la Rochejacquelein had to take to the woods disguised as a peasant.Schama, S. Citizens p. 788 Penguin 1989. He managed to save the remains of his army by crossing the Loire, and left under the criticism of his fellow companions. While trying to pursue a guerrilla war against the Republicans, he was killed by a Republican soldier near Nuaill√© on 28 January 1794. On a reconnaissance mission he had spotted two Republican soldiers who pretended to surrender to him, but then shot him in the forehead.Chronicle of the French Revolution p. 367 Longman Group 1989.

Ride height or ground clearance is the amount of space between the base of an automobile tire and the lowest point (typically the axle); or, more properly, to the shortest distance between a flat, level surface, and the lowest part of a vehicle other than those parts designed to contact the ground (such as tires, tracks, skis, etc.). Ground clearance is measured with standard vehicle equipment, and for cars, is usually given with no cargo or passengers.  Function  Ground clearance is a critical factor in several important characteristics of a vehicle. For all vehicles, especially cars, variations in clearance represent a trade-off between handling, ride quality, and practicality. A higher ride height and ground clearance means that the wheels have more vertical room to travel and absorb road shocks. Also, the car is more capable of being driven on roads that are not level, without the scraping against surface obstacles and possibly damaging the chassis and underbody. For a higher ride height, the center of mass of the car is higher, which makes for less precise and more dangerous handling characteristics (most notably, the chance of rollover is higher). Higher ride heights will typically adversely affect aerodynamic properties. This is why sports cars typically have very low clearances, while off-road vehicles and SUVs have higher ones. Two well-known extremes of each are the Ferrari F40 and the Hummer. Specialized uses =Underslung frame= Some cars have used underslung frames to achieve a lower ride height and the consequent improvement in center of gravity. The 1905-14 cars of the American Motor Car Company are one example.http://www.hotrod.com/featuredvehicles/113_0606_25_dodge_roadster/ =Self-leveling= Self-leveling suspension systems are designed to maintain a constant ride height regardless of load. The suspension detects the load via mechanical or electronic means and raises or lowers the vehicle, by inflating cylinders in the suspension to lift the chassis higher. Vehicles not equipped with self-leveling will pitch down at one end when laden; this adversely affects ride, handling, and aerodynamic properties. =Height adjustable= Some modern automobiles (such as the Audi Allroad Quattro and Tesla Model S) have height adjustable suspension, which can vary the ride height by adjusting the hydropneumatic suspension or air suspension. This adjustment can be automatic, depending on road conditions, and/or the settings selected by the driver. =Adjustable shock absorber= Other, simpler suspension systems, such as coilover springs, offer a way of manually adjusting ride height (and often, spring stiffness) by compressing the spring in situ, using a threaded shaft and adjustable knob or nut. BMW E46 \\"stanced\\" using aftermarket suspension kit =Aftermarket= Lowering a car's suspension is a common and relatively inexpensive aftermarket modification. Many car enthusiasts prefer the more aggressive look of a lowered body, and there is an easily realized car handling improvement from the lower center of gravity. Most passenger cars are produced such that one or two inches of lowering will not significantly increase the probability of damage. On most automobiles, ride height is modified by changing the length of the suspension springs, and is the essence of many aftermarket suspension kits supplied by manufacturers such as EibachEibach and H&R; H&R;. =Military= For armored fighting vehicles (AFV), ground clearance presents an additional factor in a vehicle's overall performance: a lower ground clearance means that the vehicle minus the chassis is lower to the ground and thus harder to spot and harder to hit. The final design of any AFV reflects a compromise between being a smaller target on one hand, and having greater battlefield mobility on the other. Very few AFVs have top speeds at which car-like handling becomes an issue, though rollovers can and do occur. By contrast, an AFV is far more likely to need high ground clearance than a road vehicle. =Trucks= MUTCD warning sign for a low- ground-clearance crossing 18-wheel tractor-trailers also have to take the ground clearance of both their tractor and especially trailer into consideration on certain areas of uneven terrain, such as raised railroad crossings. Their extremely long wheelbase means that such terrain could potentially catch the undercarriage of the trailer in the wide space between the axles, potentially leaving the truck stuck with no means to extricate itself. =Buses= In some areas buses are required to have a ground clearance of at least . \\"Code of Practice for Buses\\", section 3.2: Ground Clearance Too much ride height can cause the vehicle to have an excessively high center of gravity, which could cause the vehicle to be unstable or even flip.

Nichols developed the Elva Mk II from lessons learnt in racing the prototype: \\"That car was driven in 1956 races by Archie Scott Brown, Stuart Lewis-Evans and others.\\" The Elva Mk II appeared in 1957: \\"Main differences from the Mark I are in the use of a De Dion rear axle as on the prototype, but with new location, inboard rear brakes, lengthened wheelbase, and lighter chassis frame.\\"Motor Racing, March 1957, Page 79. The car was offered as standard with 1,100 cc Coventry-Climax engine. This went through various changes up to the Mark IV of 1958. Elva BMW Mk VIII. Carl Haas, from Chicago, was Elva agent in the midwest of the United States from the mid-1950s through the 1960s. In 1958 he was invited to England to drive an Elva in the Tourist Trophy at Goodwood, where he finished twelfth overall.

Around 1964-1966 Elva made a very successful series of Mk8 sports racers mostly with 1.8 litre BMW engines (modified from the 1.6 litre by Nerus) and some with 1.15 litre Holbay-Ford engines. The Mk8 had a longer wheelbase and wider track compared to the Mk7, which was known for difficult handling due to a 70-30 weight bias to the rear.Autosport, 13 May 2010, Page 78. Following the success of the McLaren in sportscar racing, Elva became involved in producing cars for sale to customers: > \\"Later a tie-up with Elva and the Trojan Group was arranged and they took > over the manufacture of the McLaren sports/racer, under the name McLaren- > Elva-Oldsmobile.\\" Motor Sport, July 1966, Page 600. At the 1966 Racing Car Show, held in London in January, Elva exhibited two sports racing cars ‚Äì the McLaren-Elva Mk.II V8 and the Elva-BMW Mk. VIIIS. The McLaren-Elva was offered with the option of Oldsmobile, Chevrolet or Ford V8 engines. The Elva-BMW Mk. VIIIS was fitted with a rear-mounted BMW two-litre four-cylinder OHC engine.Racing Car Show 1966, Official Catalogue and Guide, Pages 69-70. Luki Botha campaigned an Elva-Porsche in southern Africa from 1966. Elva Courier The main road car, introduced in 1958, was called the Courier and went through a series of developments throughout the existence of the company. Initially all the cars were exported, home market sales not starting until 1960. Mark Donohue had his first racing successes in an Elva Courier winning the SCCA F Prod Championship in 1960 and the SCCA E Prod Championship in 1961. The Mk 1 used a 1500 cc MGA or Riley 1.5 litre engine in a ladder chassis with Elva designed independent front suspension. The engine was set well back in the chassis to help weight distribution, which produced good handling but encroached on the cockpit making the car a little cramped. The chassis carried lightweight 2-seater open glassfibre bodywork. It was produced as a complete car for the US and European market and available in kit form for the UK market. After about 50 cars were made it was upgraded to the Mk II which was the same car but fitted with a proprietary curved glass windscreen, replacing the original flat-glass split type, and the larger 1600 cc MGA engine. Approximately 400 of the Mk I and II were made. The rights to the Elva Courier were acquired by Trojan in 1962, and production moved to the main Trojan factory in Purley Way, Croydon, Surrey. Competition Press announced: \\"Elva Courier manufacturing rights have been sold to Lambretta- Trojan in England. F-Jr Elva and Mark IV sports cars will continue to be built by Frank Nichols as in the past.\\"Competition Press, Vol.8-No.5, 10 March 1962, Page 7. With the Trojan takeover the Mk III was introduced in 1962 and was sold as a complete car. On the home market a complete car cost ¬£965 or the kit version ¬£716. The chassis was now a box frame moulded into the body. Triumph rack and pinion steering and front suspension was standardised. A closed coup√© body was also available with either a reverse slope Ford Anglia-type rear window or a fastback. In autumn 1962: \\"Elva Courier Mk IV was shown at London Show. New coupe has all-independent suspension, fiberglass body, MG engine. Mk III Couriers were also shown. Though previously equipped with MG-A engines, new versions will be equipped with 1800cc MG-B engine.\\"Competition Press, Vol.9-No.10, 24 November 1962, Page 4. Later the Ford Cortina GT unit was available. The final version, the fixed head coup√© Mk IV T type used Lotus twin-cam engines with the body modified to give more interior room. It could be had with all independent suspension and four wheel disc brakes. 210 were made. Ken Sheppard Customised Sports Cars of Shenley, Hertfordshire acquired the Elva Courier from Trojan in 1965 but production ended in 1968.

It used a BMW dry sump engine of 2 litre capacity with bodywork styled by Englishman Trevor Frost (also known as Trevor Fiore, and who also designed the Trident) and made by Carrozzeria Fissore of Turin. It weighed and had so would have had very impressive performance but was deemed too costly to put into series production. The car was shown at the London Motor Show in 1964.Motor Sport, October 1964, Page 801. One of the cars was purchased by Richard Wrottesley and entered in the 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans.

She was best known for her leading roles in the cult films Konga and Beat Girl, Gordon became the subject of singer Scott Walker's song \\"Archangel\\". Career Gordon was born in Cambridge, in England. Her father was a doctor and her mother a make-up artist who worked for Max Factor. After being photographed by chance at the Queens Ice Rink, Bayswater, for the cover of the magazine Lilliput, she was signed to a five- year contract with film agent Bill Watts and played a harem girl in the Bernard Bresslaw film I Only Arsked! (1958),Wayne Kinsey, Hammer Films: the Bray Studio Years (Reynolds & Hearn, 2002) before making her first stage appearance, still aged only seventeen, in Meet the Cousin, which starred Cicely Courtneidge and Jack Hulbert.Terence Blacker, You Cannot Live as I Have Lived and Not End Up Like This (2007) The show opened at the Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh, and it was there that she met her husband-to-be William Donaldson, later better known as Henry Root, who was just starting out as a theatrical producer. Following a spell in repertory at the New Theatre Royal, Portsmouth, playing a Russian spy in Agatha Christie's Verdict and a gum-chewing blonde in Brighton Rock and some pre-London tours, she made her West End theatre debut on a motorbike in The Darling Buds of May at the Saville Theatre; and then played the role of Peggy, a dumb blonde film starlet, in a show-stopping scene with Michael Crawford in Neil Simon's first hit Come Blow Your Horn at London's Prince of Wales Theatre, Later, at Donaldson's request, she appeared as an entirely French-speaking Lady Fifi de Winter in an improvised production of The Three Musketeers with Bruce Lacey and The Alberts, at the Arts Theatre. Donaldson's talent for presenting controversial and often money-losing shows didn't desert him; the show ran for two weeks; and Gordon made theatrical history as the first actress to appear naked on stage. (\\"Watch out for the bath scene; it's a breakthrough\\", wrote the New Statesman.) Most recently, she played the Fairy Godmother in Cinderella at the Princess Theatre, Hunstanton, and worked with Sarah Louise Young in Clive Evans's two woman show The Nunnery. Personal life Gordon married Donaldson on 1 September 1967. A year later he inherited a fortune on the death of his grandmother. Donaldson's biographer later noted that the marriage was \\"not an easy one\\".Terence Blacker, 'Donaldson, (Charles) William [Henry Root] (1935‚Äì2005)', in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2009) After it broke down, Gordon joined the Open University and went on to graduate from Middlesex University with a BA degree in English and American History and Literature. Gordon was with Dr Stephen Ward the night that he met Christine Keeler,Douglas Thompson, Stephen Ward: Scapegoat (2013), p. 104 and with William Donaldson when the police raided and planted hash in their Chelsea flat; for which the policemen were later jailed. By the end of her life, she had been working on her memoirs and a documentary about her experiences while living in Egypt before and after the 2011 revolution. Death Claire Gordon died of a brain tumour on 13 April 2015 in a nursing home in west London.

Etymology Balloch comes from either the Gaelic word baile which means village or hamlet, or the Gaelic bealach meaning \\"a pass\\". Using the former derivation, Balloch means \\"village on the loch\\", i.e. the nearby Loch Lomond, but this would be Baile Loch. Geography environmental art installation in the woods at Balloch Balloch is at the north end of the Vale of Leven, straddling the River Leven itself. It connects to the larger town of Alexandria and to the smaller village of Jamestown, both of which are located to its south. It also borders the Kilpatrick Hills. To the east of the town lies the major local authority housing scheme in the area known as 'The Haldane' or 'The Mill of Haldane'. Glasgow is located around to the southeast. Balloch lies on the 56th parallel, at about the same latitude as Moscow. Tourism With its accessible location at the southern end of Loch Lomond and just off the main road from Glasgow to the West Highlands (A82), it is an important centre of tourism, especially from Glasgow and Dumbarton. The village has a number of hotels, inns and pubs, and there are cruises from Balloch up Loch Lomond, and other services, including to nearby locations like Luss, and the Renfrew Ferry service. The largest number of boats cruising on Loch Lomond leave from Balloch. The village is also the home of Dunkirk vessel Skylark XI which helped rescue 600 troops during WWII. It contains Balloch Country Park and Balloch Castle, and is at the southern end of the first Scottish national park, Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park. There is a Sea Life Centre in the village . The Loch Lomond Youth Soccer Festival used to take place in the village . \\"Lochfoot\\" in the Jean Robertson novels of Jane Duncan is partly based on the village. The PS Maid of the Loch is currently being restored at Balloch pier and the Balloch Steam Slipway is located nearby. Transport The A811 road (based on an 18th-century military road) goes from Balloch to Stirling, and the A813 goes from Dumbarton to Balloch. The Glasgow to Loch Lomond cycle path (part of National Cycle Route 7) ends at Balloch. The West Loch Lomond Cycle Path also runs from Balloch. The village was formerly served by two railway stations on the Caledonian and Dunbartonshire Junction Railway: Balloch Central, and Balloch Pier, which closed in 1988 and 1986, respectively. The village now has one railway station opened by British Rail, which is a terminus of the North Clyde electric train service from Glasgow. Education Balloch is served by Balloch Primary School and St Kessog‚Äôs Primary school, both located at the newly built Balloch Campus. Balloch Primary School is the result of a merger between Haldane Primary School and Jamestown Primary School In 2018.

It compiles the band's then-latest (but not last) three singles and their B-sides in reverse- chronological order. Stop Me was released in January 1988 by their Japanese record company, RCA Victor. Background In 1987 The Smiths' UK record company, Rough Trade, planned to release three singles from the newly recorded Strangeways, Here We Come album. In August 1987 \\"Girlfriend in a Coma\\" was scheduled to be released as planned when news broke that the band had split up. This presented Rough Trade with a problem as no new material would be available to complement the other singles on their B-sides. It was decided to release the singles as planned, using archive material for B-sides. Singer Morrissey remained involved in the singles' sleeve design. The second single off Strangeways, Here We Come was scheduled to be \\"Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before\\", an up-tempo pop-rock song. The song contains the lines Rough Trade deemed it unwise to release the song in the wake of the Hungerford massacre, fearing a BBC Radio ban. In the UK, \\"I Started Something I Couldn't Finish\\" was chosen instead, but other countries (United States, Canada, Australia, Netherlands) opted to keep \\"Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before\\", releasing it in 7\\", 12\\" and CD single formats. In Germany, the track was released as a double A-side with \\"Girlfriend in a Coma\\"; the 12\\" and CD versions featured the latter's original B-sides \\"Work Is a Four-Letter Word\\" and \\"I Keep Mine Hidden\\". The band's Japanese record company went one further and decided to compile their latest three singles, none of which had been released in Japan, and all of their B-sides onto a compilation album that bore an abbreviated version of the latest (international) single's title. By the time of the album's release, another single had been issued in the UK (\\"Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me\\", December 1987), but it was not included. =Cover= The cover sleeve, designed as usual by Morrissey, features Murray Head in a still from the 1966 film The Family Way. The same design was used for the European and Australian 1987 single editions, but not for the contemporary UK single \\"I Started Something I Couldn't Finish\\", which had its own sleeve design (yet used the same B-sides as \\"Stop Me...\\").

Elva has two larger lakes. Lake Verevi has a sandy and well-developed beach area that is very popular in the summer and is host to many outdoor events. Lake Arbi has wet reed grown shores. Elva's largest employer (and in all of southern Estonia) is Enics Eesti AS, subsidiary of Enics Group, providing electronics manufacturing services in industrial electronics. Elva has one school, Elva G√ºmnaasium, offering education from 1st grade to high school graduation. A dominant element in Elva is the train station which today is a visitors' information center and which used to be an important trade route in the past centuries. Detailed information on hikes on foot or by bicycle can be obtained from the visitors' information center. The Elva river, with old water mill sites and rapid banks, is popular for canoeing. In winter skiers can participate in the Tartu Marathon, belonging to the Worldloppet series. Its 60 km track from Otep√§√§ to Elva can be cycled through on mountain bikes in summer. History of Elva Elva was founded soon after the completion of Tartu-Valga train route that was built from 1886 to 1889. Elva was first mentioned in an Estonian newspaper in 1889. Elva is named after the Elva river that has been mentioned in books already in the 17th century. In 1913 a two grade school was opened. On 1 May 1938 Elva became a town. The town center was heavily damaged in the Second World War. In July 1941 Elva was liberated by the Forest Brothers. In August 1944 surroundings of Elva became a bloody battlefield between Hyazinth von Strachwitz's Panzer brigade and the Red Army. From 1950 to 1962 Elva was District Central of Elva district.

The term also refers to a person who works with \\"white\\" or light-coloured metals, and is sometimes used as a synonym for tinsmith. History The first known description of Whitesmith is from 1686: Oxford English Dictionary https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/ Whitesmithing developed as a speciality of blacksmithing in the 1700s, when extra time was given to filing and polishing certain products. In 1836 the trade was described by Isaac Taylor:Taylor, Isaac. Scenes of Commerce, by Land and Sea; Or, \\"Where Does It Come from?\\" Answered. 1836. OCLC 1063410305 Process The principal manual skills of the whitesmith were in filing and turning (the use of lathes). Using cross-cut files the whitesmith could achieve a flat, smooth finish on iron or steel products where the less skilled might only achieve a convex effect. For very large items, the whitesmith might even file when red hot using a two-person operated float file. This profession is also related to a bell hanger and locksmith as they perform much file work. In Great Britain this type of worker was affiliated with a union. The Amalgamated Society of Whitesmiths was founded in 1889. It was renamed the Amalgamated Society of Whitesmiths, Locksmiths, Bell-hangers, Domestic Engineers, Art Metal Workers and General Iron Fitters in 1891, the Amalgamated Society of Whitesmiths, Locksmiths, Bell-hangers, Domestic Engineers, Art Metal Workers and General Iron and Pipe Fitters in 1894, and the Amalgamated Society of Whitesmiths, Domestic Engineers and General Pipe Fitters in 1904.

Literally, the term means \\"big man.\\" In Sumerian, lu \\"íáΩ\\" is \\"man\\" and gal \\"íÉ≤\\" is \\"great,\\" or \\"big.\\" It was one of several Sumerian titles that a ruler of a city-state could bear (alongside en and ensi, the exact difference being a subject of debate). The sign eventually became the predominant logograph for \\"King\\" in general.

Cuneiform \\"Lugal\\" in archaic and early cuneiform on the Lugal-dalu statue The cuneiform sign LUGAL íàó (Borger nr. 151, Unicode U+12217) serves as a determinative in cuneiform texts (Sumerian, Akkadian and Hittite), indicating that the following word is the name of a king. In Akkadian orthography, it may also be a syllabogram ≈°√†r, acrophonically based on the Akkadian for \\"king\\", ≈°arrum. Lugal, ensi and en Evolution of anthropomorphic cuneiforms, Lugal appears in the right columns. There are different theories regarding the meaning of the title lugal in 3rd-millennium Sumer. Some scholars believe that a ruler of an individual city-state was usually called ensi, and a ruler who headed a confederacy or larger dominion composed of several cities, perhaps even the whole of Sumer, was a lugal. The functions of such a lugal would include certain ceremonial and cultic activities, arbitration in border disputes, military defence against external enemies, and once the lugal has died, the eldest son must take over.Plamen Rusev, Mesalim, Lugal Na Kish: Politicheska Istoriia Na Ranen Shumer (XXVIII- XXVI V.

Early life and career Ross always wanted to become a DJ and at the age of 11 wrote to the general manager of Radio Luxembourg. He attended King Edward VI Aston School in Aston, Birmingham and left with 10 O Levels. His first job after school was at IBM, but he left after a year. His next job was at Witton Cemetery. At the age of 17, Ross won a DJ competition run by the Birmingham Evening Mail, beating Johnnie Walker, who came second. Part of his prize was to appear at Radio Luxembourg for an audition, but this never happened. He was offered his first gig at the Mecca Ballroom in Birmingham before moving on to the Birmingham Rollerskating Rink. BBC Radio Birmingham The break he was waiting for came in 1970 when he joined BBC Radio Birmingham (now BBC WM), presenting a Saturday morning show with John Henry. It was one of the first \\"zoo-radio\\" formats ‚Äì involving a studio audience and interactive elements and phone-in requests presented by Fiona MacDonald. The breakfast show, entitled \\"On The Move\\", was unusual because it started at 5am. The BBC national networks did not start programming until 6am making Ross the only presenter on the air in the UK during that hour. The Radio Birmingham transmitter at 5.5 kW was one of the more powerful local radio ones in the country at the time and so Ross enjoyed an audience of shift workers over a wide area. Radio Tees and BRMB In 1974, Ross's initial application to BRMB was rejected and he subsequently joined Radio Tees in the North East of England presenting their breakfast show in summer 1975. Ross also presented a successful Saturday morning music show which used the talents of the station's record librarian Wincey Willis as co- presenter. In March 1976, he returned to Birmingham and joined BRMB, taking over the breakfast show from Adrian Juste, who had left to join BBC Radio 1. Ross also co-hosted Revolver, a British music series that ran for eight episodes on ITV in 1978, alongside Peter Cook. The late-night show, filmed with a live audience, was set in a seedy ballroom-turned-rock venue. In his role of assistant manager, Les Ross ran a hamburger stand while offering rock trivia gems and introducing the \\"Revolver Reviver\\" nostalgia spot. Ross won many awards, including 'Independent Radio Personality of the Year Award' in 1986, and in 1997 he received a Sony Award and an MBE from the Queen for his services to broadcasting. Xtra AM and return to BRMB With the launch of sister station Xtra AM in 1989, Ross moved on to present there for four years. In August 1993, Ross returned to BRMB Breakfast show, where he had female co- presenters by his side during this period, including Suzi Becker and Tammy Gooding. After 26 years of broadcasting, on Friday 27 September 2002, Ross presented his final BRMB Breakfast show, live from Birmingham International station. As 9 o'clock approached, he boarded a Virgin Trains West Coast train hauled by electric locomotive no. 86259 especially named 'Les Ross' to mark the end of his BRMB radio career. no 86259 \\"Les Ross\\" He later purchased and preserved this locomotive in operational condition following its retirement from regular passenger service.

On Monday 6 January 2003, Ross took over from David Hamilton, on Birmingham's Saga 105.7 FM breakfast show. However, in December 2004, he quit the station as he claimed the station management was guilty of sending \\"nannying\\" e-mails which were turning him into a \\"robo-jock\\" and was apparently barred from drinking coffee during his early show. He announced his departure, planned for Christmas Eve 2004, after he was only offered a one-year contract, below half- pay, despite doubling the show's ratings in recent audience research figures. Ross stated \\"How much would I have had to put the ratings up by just to get the same deal as I was on before? If I had been happy and felt that I had support, I might have stayed for half the money. But I wasn't happy and I feel that if you pay peanuts, you get monkeys\\". His departure came before Christmas Eve, as station bosses decided to take action when Ross spoke to the local press about what had happened. Back to the BBC Rumour mills went quickly into action about where Ross would turn up next. BBC Radio WM hired him to present a weekly show on Sunday mornings from 9am to midday. On Sunday 6 February 2005, Ross presented his first weekly show on BBC WM. He would also cover for various holidaying presenters on the station including Adrian Goldberg, Ed Doolan and Danny Kelly, which Ross would later take over the afternoon show permanently. In addition to his Sunday morning show, on Saturday 23 July 2005, Ross also took over the Saturday Breakfast show from 6 to 9am. Back on daily Ross took over the Monday to Friday 1 to 4pm slot from Danny Kelly on WM on Tuesday 10 April 2007. BBC WM's managing editor, Keith Beech, said: \\"Les Ross is one of the best-loved and most popular presenters there is. I'm excited about the prospect of hearing him every day here on BBC WM.\\" In early 2009, the show went out from 2 to 4pm on weekdays and has since left the station just after his 60th Birthday. On 7 December 2009, Les Ross returned to the airwaves when he became the presenter of the Big City Breakfast Show on Birmingham's Big City Radio 89.1. He hosted his final show for the station on Friday 26 March 2010. He returned to the station on 10 February 2013 to front a Sunday afternoon show. In April 2015, Les Ross started broadcasting on Wolverhampton's 101.8 WCRFM: www.wcrfm.com. He currently presents a two-hour weekly Sixties show on Saturday mornings.

They superseded the earlier Servian Wall built during the 4th century BC. The walls enclosed all the seven hills of Rome plus the Campus Martius and, on the right bank of the Tiber, the Trastevere district. The river banks within the city limits appear to have been left unfortified, although they were fortified along the Campus Martius. The size of the entire enclosed area is . The wall cut through populated areas: in reality the city at the time embraced 2,400 hectares or 6,000 acres. Pliny the Elder in the first century A.D. suggested that the densely populated areas, 'extrema tectorum' (the limits of the roofed areas) extended from the Golden Milestone in the Forum (Natural History 3.67).Stephen L. Dyson, Rome A Living Portrait of and Ancient City, 2010 p. 298 Construction The full circuit ran for surrounding an area of . The walls were constructed in brick-faced concrete, thick and high, with a square tower every 100 Roman feet (). In the 4th century, remodelling doubled the height of the walls to . By 500 AD, the circuit possessed 383 towers, 7,020 crenellations, 18 main gates, 5 postern gates, 116 latrines, and 2,066 large external windows.Claridge, Amanda (1998). Rome: An Oxford Archaeological Guide, First, Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1998, pp. 59, 332-335. History By the third century AD, the boundaries of Rome had grown far beyond the area enclosed by the old Servian Wall, built during the Republican period in the late 4th century BC. Rome had remained unfortified during the subsequent centuries of expansion and consolidation due to lack of hostile threats against the city. The citizens of Rome took great pride in knowing that Rome required no fortifications because of the stability brought by the Pax Romana and the protection of the Roman Army. However, the need for updated defences became acute during the crisis of the Third Century, when barbarian tribes flooded through the Germanic frontier and the Roman Army struggled to stop them. In 270, the barbarian Juthungi and Vandals invaded northern Italy, inflicting a severe defeat on the Romans at Placentia (modern Piacenza) before eventually being driven back. Further trouble broke out in Rome itself in the summer of 271, when the mint workers rose in rebellion. Several thousand people died in the fierce fighting that resulted.Aldrete, Gregory S (2004). Daily Life In The Roman City: Rome, Pompeii, And Ostia, Greenwood Press, 2004, pp. 41-42. Aurelian's construction of the walls as an emergency measure was a reaction to the barbarian invasion of 270; the historian Aurelius Victor states explicitly that the project aimed to alleviate the city's vulnerability.Aurelius Victor, De Caesaribus. 35, 7. It may also have been intended to send a political signal as a statement that Aurelian trusted that the people of Rome would remain loyal, as well as serving as a public declaration of the emperor's firm hold on power. The construction of the walls was by far the largest building project that had taken place in Rome for many decades, and their construction was a concrete statement of the continued strength of Rome. The construction project was unusually left to the citizens themselves to complete as Aurelian could not afford to spare a single legionary for the project. The root of this unorthodox practice was due to the imminent barbarian threat coupled with the wavering strength of the military as a whole due to being subject to years of bloody civil war, famine and the Plague of Cyprian. The walls were built in the short time of only five years, though Aurelian himself died before the completion of the project. Progress was accelerated, and money saved, by incorporating existing buildings into the structure. These included the Amphitheatrum Castrense, the Castra Praetoria, the Pyramid of Cestius, and even a section of the Aqua Claudia aqueduct near the Porta Maggiore. As much as a sixth of the walls is estimated to have been composed of pre-existing structures. An area behind the walls was cleared and sentry passages were built to enable it to be reinforced quickly in an emergency. The actual effectiveness of the wall is disputable, given the relatively small size of the city's garrison. The entire combined strength of the Praetorian Guard, cohortes urbanae, and vigiles of Rome was only about 25,000 men ‚Äì far too few to defend the circuit adequately. However, the military intention of the wall was not to withstand prolonged siege warfare; it was not common for the barbarian armies to besiege cities, as they were insufficiently equipped and provisioned for such a task. Instead, they carried out hit-and-run raids against ill-defended targets. The wall was a deterrent against such tactics.Southern, Pat. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine, Routledge, 2001, p. 115. Parts of the wall were doubled in height by Maxentius, who also improved the watch-towers. In 401, under Honorius, the walls and the gates were improved. At this time, the Tomb of Hadrian across the Tiber was incorporated as a fortress in the city defenses. Later use The Aurelian Walls continued as a significant military defense for the city of Rome until September 20, 1870, when the Bersaglieri of the Kingdom of Italy breached the wall near the Porta Pia and captured Rome. The walls also defined the boundary of the city of Rome up until the 19th century, with the built-up area being confined within the walled area. The Aurelian Walls remain remarkably well-preserved today, largely the result of their constant use as Rome's primary fortification until the 19th century. The Museo delle Mura near the Porta San Sebastiano offers information on the walls' construction and how the defenses operated. The best-preserved sections of the walls are found from the Muro Torto (Villa Borghese) to Corso d'Italia to Castro Pretorio; from Porta San Giovanni to Porta Ardeatina; from Porta Ostiense to the Tiber; and around Porta San Pancrazio.

They are among the largest spiders of Central and Northern Europe. They were previously placed in the genus Tegenaria. In 2013, they were moved to the new genus Eratigena as the single species Eratigena atrica. In 2018, the three separate species were restored. The bite of these species does not pose a threat to humans or pets, and they are generally reluctant to bite, preferring instead to hide or escape. Description The two sexes do not differ in coloration or markings. Its coloration is mainly dark brown. On its sternum is a lighter marking, with three light spots on each side. The opisthosoma features a lighter middle line with six \\"spots\\" on each side. The giant house spider has the same coloration as the domestic house spider, Tegenaria domestica; it has earthy tones of brown and muddy red or yellow. They also have conspicuously hairy legs, palps and abdomen. The female body size can reach in length, with males having a slightly smaller body at around in length. The female leg span is typically around . The leg span of the male is highly variable, with spans between being common. Its eight eyes are of equal size and are arranged in two rows. As the eyes contain fewer than 400 visual cells, E. atrica can probably only distinguish light and dark. Taxonomy The first description of a spider now assigned to this species was by Carl Ludwig Koch in 1843, under the name Tegenaria atrica. Other supposedly different species were described later, including Tegenaria saeva by John Blackwall in 1844, Tegenaria duellica by Eug√®ne Simon in 1875 and Tegenaria gigantea by Ralph Vary Chamberlin and Wilton Ivie in 1935. T. gigantea was synonymized with T. duellica in 1978. The three remaining taxa have been regarded as distinct species, particularly in Britain. Thus Roberts (1995) provides distinguishing characters for T. atrica, T. duellica and T. saeva, as does Oxford (2008) for T. duellica (as T. gigantea) and T. saeva. Others consider these three as part of a single morphologically variable species, for which the oldest name, and hence the senior synonym, is T. atrica. A phylogenetic study in 2013 concluded that Tegenaria, as then defined, was not monophyletic, and split off some species, including T. atrica, into the newly created segregate genus Eratigena. The study also consolidated the various giant house spider species into one species, E. atrica. A subsequent genetic study of E. atrica specimens determined that there were three distinct morphological groups, leading to the restoration of three separate species: E. atrica, E. duellica, and E. saeva. Distribution and habitat E. atrica is found in Europe, Central Asia and Northern Africa. It was unwittingly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of North America circa 1900 due to human activity and has strongly increased in numbers for the last century. In the last few years the spider has been found in several European countries in which it was previously not recorded, like Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. It is recorded in the checklist of Danish spider species,Checklist of Danish Spiders (Araneae). Version 26-10-2011 (list) and is also found in Iceland. The giant house spider's original habitat consists mostly of caves, or dry forests where it is found under rocks, but it is a common spider in people's homes. Biology and behavior The webs built by the giant house spider are flat and messy with a funnel at one end. They do not contain sticky threads. The spider lurks in the funnel until a small invertebrate happens to get trapped in the web, at which point the spider runs out and attacks it. They usually build their webs in corners (on both the floor and ceiling), between boxes in basements, behind cupboards, in attics, or any other area that is rarely disturbed by large animals or humans. They are also often found near window openings. E. atrica normally lives for two or three years, but lifetimes of up to six years have been observed. While the female only leaves its nest to feed, males can often be seen wandering around houses during the late summer and early autumn looking for a mate. Males can be found from July to October, adult females occur all year. At least 60 spiderlings emerge from an egg sac. Unusual for spiders, they are subsocial at this stage: they remain together for about a month, but do not cooperate in prey capture. The amount of cannibalism correlates with the amount of available food. E. atrica molts seven or eight times before reaching the immature adult state, and after a final molt reaches maturity. Like most spiders, the spider possesses venom to subdue its prey. Since E. atrica bites can penetrate human skin on occasion, the effects of agatoxin might be felt by bite victims, though these spiders will not bite unless provoked. With speeds clocked at , the giant house spider held the Guinness Book of World Records for top spider speed until 1987 when it was displaced by solifugids, although the latter are not true spiders. Relationship with Eratigena agrestis A population of giant house spiders is popularly thought to be a deterrent to the establishment of Eratigena agrestis, known in North America as the \\"hobo spider\\", and considered by some to be more likely to bite humans. Giant house spiders may compete with hobo spiders for the same resources. Hobo spiders grow no more than a body size of long whereas the larger female giant house spider can have a body size of , but has proportionately much longer legs. In popular culture Humorist David Sedaris has written about his relationship with E. atrica. His essay \\"April In Paris\\" documents his growing affection towards and domestic association with giant house spiders, particularly one named April. The essay can be found in the collection When You Are Engulfed in Flames.

It is also the name of a small hill station cum mining town situated near the mountain, about 20 kilometres from Kalasa. The name Kuduremukha literally means 'horse-face' (Kannada) and refers to a particular picturesque view of a side of the mountain that resembles a horse's face. It was also referred to as 'Samseparvata', historically since it was approached from Samse village. Kuduremukha is Karnataka's 2nd highest peak after Mullayanagiri. The nearest International Airport is at Mangalore which is at distance of 99 kilometres. Location The Kudremukh National Park (latitude 13¬∞01'00\\" to 13¬∞29'17\\" N, longitude 75¬∞00'55' to 75¬∞25'00\\" E) is the second largest Wildlife Protected Area (600.32 km2) belonging to a tropical wet evergreen type of forest in the Western Ghats. Kudremukh National Park is located in Chikkamagaluru district of the State of Karnataka. The Western Ghats is one of the thirty-four hotspots identified for bio-diversity conservation in the world. Kudremukh National Park comes under the Global Tiger Conservation Priority-I, under the format developed jointly by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and World Wide Fund-USA. thumb Geography Panoramic View of mountains in the Kudremukh National Park The southern and western sides of the park form the steep slope of the Western Ghats ridgeline, with the altitude varying from 100 m - 1892 m (peak). The northern, central and the eastern portions of the park constitute a chain of rolling hills with a mosaic of natural grassland and shola forests. Kudremukh receives an average annual rainfall of 7000 mm, largely due to the forest types of mainly evergreen vegetation that can be found here. History The Horse Faced Peak =National park= Well known environmentalist and tiger expert, Dr. K Ullas Karanth undertook a detailed and systematic survey of the distribution of the endangered lion-tailed macaque in Karnataka during 1983-84 with support from the Government of Karnataka. He observed that suitable and extensive rainforest habitat for the lion-tailed macaque existed in Kudremukh and that the tract probably harbored the largest contiguous population of lion-tailed macaques in the Western Ghats, outside the Malabar region. He further suggested that lion-tailed macaques could be effectively used as a 'flagship' species to conserve the entire biotic community in the region and prepared a conservation plan for the survival of wild populations of lion-tailed macaques in the region delineating the present national park area as a proposed nature reserve. Based on his report, the Karnataka State Wildlife Advisory Board suggested to the government that Kudremukh National Park be created. Kudremukh National Park is spread partly over the thick hilly forests near the coastal plains on the western portion and the shola vegetation on the Western Ghats uplands, covering parts of three districts, viz., Chickmagalur, Udupi and Dakshina Kannada. The Kudremukh peak, by which the national park derives its name, is the highest spot at 1892 meters. The hills, which bear the brunt of the severe monsoon winds, preclude any tree growth added to that the region is known for its rich low-grade magnetite soil which primarily inhibits plant growth. As a result, the landscape is covered with grass. The valleys which are tucked in, have reasonable protection from wind and a deep soil profile, as a result of which stunted evergreen forests exist creating a unique microclimate, rich with mosses, orchids, etc. The whole scenery of grassland interspersed with narrow strips of forests provides a fantastic vista. Three important rivers, the Tunga, the Bhadra, and the Nethravathi are said to have their origin here. A shrine of goddess Bhagavathi and a Varaha image, 1.8 m within a cave are the main attractions. The Tunga River and Bhadra River flow freely through the parklands. The area of the Kadambi waterfalls is a definite point of interest for anyone who travels to the spot. The animals found there include malabar civets, wild dogs, sloth bears and spotted deer. =Opposition to national park= Kudremukh People residing inside the national park did not welcome the idea of such a concept, as it involves eviction and Kudremukh Rashtriya Udyana Virodhi Okoota, an NGO, fights on behalf of people residing inside the forest and opposes the formation of the national park. To curb the supposed naxalite activity inside the premises, police opened fire on activists and killed five suspected naxalites on 10 July 2007. =Conservation= The Kudremukh range was declared a tiger reserve, as part of the Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary by the Union Environmental Minister, Government of India. =Ecology= Shola Grasslands and forests in the Kudremukh National Park, Western Ghats, Karnataka. A diverse assemblage of endangered large mammals is found in the park supporting three large mammal predator species such as the tiger, leopard and wild dog. The important tiger prey base found within the park is gaur, sambar, wild pig, muntjac, chevrotain, bonnet macaque, common langur and the lion-tailed macaque. The wet climate and the tremendous water retentive capacity of the shola grasslands and forests have led to the formation of thousands of perennial streams in the region converging to form three major rivers of the region, Tunga, Bhadra and Nethravathi which form an important lifeline for the people of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Lobo's house is an old abandoned farm on the upper reaches of Kuduremukha. Mining town Kudremukh Road Lakya dam lake near Kudremukh town The Kudremukh township developed primarily as an iron ore mining town where the government ran Kudremukh Iron Ore Company Ltd. (KIOCL). This public sector company operated for almost 30 years but was closed in 2006 due to environmental issues. The company proposed eco-tourism in the area and insisted that the land lease be renewed for 99 years. However, environmentalists opposed such an idea on the grounds that the area should be given time to regenerate completely rest. Thus, the mining lease lapsed on 24 July 1999.. The mining town now known as Kudremukha was earlier Malleshwara village whose residents have relocated to Jamble village of Mudigere taluk in the 1970s.. Mining town had 3 schools named Giri Jyothi Convent School, Kendriya Vidyala & Government school, which had an education from Nursery to class 12. =Demographics= India census, Kudremukh town had a population of 8095. Males constitute 54% of the population, while females constitute 46%. Kudremukh has an average literacy rate of 80%, which is higher than the national average of 59.5%; male literacy is 83% while female literacy is 77%. 11% of the population is under six years of age. Threats Kudremukha Iron Ore Company logo Kudremukh Iron Ore Company Limited (KIOCL) is a government-run company which was mining iron ore from the Kudremukh hills. KIOCL conducted its operations on an area of 4,604.55 ha for over 20 years. Opposition to its activities built up over the years from environmentalists and wildlife conservationists who were concerned about the threat to the region's flora and fauna, and farmers who were affected by the pollution of the streams that originated in the mining area. KIOCL has been banned from operating in this beautiful Natural Reserve, according to a Supreme Court order. The rainfall in Kudremukh, which is one of the highest for any open cast mining operation in the world, greatly accentuates the impacts of siltation as claimed by environmentalists. The topographic and rainfall characteristics in combination with the open cast mining of low grade iron ore and other land-surface disturbances caused by the KIOCL operations resulted in very high sediment discharge, with over 60% of the total siltation in the Bhadra system being contributed by the mining area which forms less than six percent of the catchment. With high-quality practices adopted by KIOCL to mine, the flora and fauna remained intact, causing no adverse effects on nature . KIOCL used to send iron ore through pipes running through districts of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada and converted to pellets at their plant in Panambur.

Initially enthusiastic about the Revolution, he became disenchanted with the disestablishment of the Catholic Church and retired to his estates in Beaupreau. He was the second commander in chief of the Royal and Catholic Army formed by Royalist forces of the Vendean insurrection against the Republic and the French Revolution. Life Maurice d'Elbee was born in Dresden, Electorate of Saxony to a French family in 1752. He moved to France in 1777, becoming a naturalised citizen and joining the French Royal Army. He embarked on a military career, reaching the rank of lieutenant, but resigned from the army in 1783 and married, thereafter living a retired country life near Beaupr√©au in Anjou. He then served as an officer in the army of Frederick Augustus I, the Prince-Elector of Saxony. After the Revolution, he returned in obedience to the law which ordered emigrants to return to France. =Participation in the Vend√©an Revolt= The peasantry and much of the middle class in the Vend√©e remained loyal to the Catholic Church and, in 1792, the Marquess de la Rou√´rie had organized a general rising, although this was frustrated by the count's arrest. However, when the Convention decreed the levee en masse of 300,000 men, the Vend√©e mounted a war against what they considered the atheist Republic. The peasants of Beaupr√©au to appoint him as their leader. His troop joined those of Fran√ßois de Charette, Charles Bonchamps, Jacques Cathelineau and Jean-Nicolas Stofflet. The army experienced several successes: Stofflet defeated the republic army at St. Vincent; D'Elb√©e and Bonchamps won at Beaupreau; and Henri de la Rochejaquelein won the victories at the Aubiers and First Cholet.John Keegan, Andrew Wheatcroft, Who's Who in Military History: From 1453 to the Present Day. Routledge, 2014. p. 86. He is famous for his actions after the Battle of Chemill√©, on 11 April 1793: after the insurgents' victory, many of them planned to avenge their dead and slaughter the Republican prisoners (approx. 400). D'Elb√©e tried to prevent them, and eventually asked them to recite the Our Father, which they did; then, when they had reached the sentence \\"And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who have trespassed against us\\", he interrupted them with the words: \\"Do not lie to God!\\". Moved by this reproach, his men turned away, and d'Elb√©e was able to save the prisoners. This episode has since become known as \\"Le Pater d'Elb√©e\\" (d'Elb√©e's Pater Noster). D'Elb√©e protecting Republican prisoners after the battle of Chemill√©, by Edmond Marie F√©lix de Boislecomte. By spring 1793, the insurgents controlled the province of Brittany. On 2 June, LaRochejacquelin stormed Saumur and Cathelineau was elected as commander in chief. D'Elb√©e was the top deputy of Cathelineau. The eight-year-old Louis XVII held in the Temple prison in Paris, the son of the executed Louis XVI, was proclaimed king of France, and Charette and Cathelineu united their armies to advance upon Nantes. When Cathelineau knelt at the town square to thank God for their victories, he was killed by a Republican sniper on 14 July 1793; d'Elb√©e replaced him as generalissimo. A skillful general, he led the small Vend√©an army to several victories, most notably at Coron and Torfou. Even at his loss at the Battle of Lu√ßon (19 August 1793), he managed to extract his force from danger. At the Battle of Lu√ßon he managed to extricate the Royalist force from a potential rout, but suffered a significant reverse.Thomas Edward Watson, From the end of the reign of Louis the Fifteenth to the consulate... Macmillan Company, 1901, pp. 799-800. Death of General D'Elb√©e, by Julien Le Blant. The Republican government in Paris entrusted its fighting to generals of the old army. Westermann was sent against them first, but on July 5 he was driven from Chatillon and suspended by the representatives on mission. After his dismissal, some of the most incompetent generals of the old army sought to defeat the rebellion. He was succeeded by the Duke of Lauzun, General Biron, who was no more successful, and who was dismissed less than a week later; the committee then sent Jean Antoine Rossignol, formerly a goldsmith's apprentice, Antoine Joseph Santerre, a brewer, and Charles-Philippe Ronsin, a playwright; all were beaten in successive battles, although Rossignol managed to hang on to his command.Watson, p. 859. As a general Rossignol was accused of incompetence by his subordinate, Augustin Tuncq. Eventually, Jean Baptiste Kl√©ber took command of the Republic army in the Vend√©e and inflicted a series of defeats. Following the Second Battle at Cholet (17 October 1793), he was badly wounded and Bonchamps was killed. Afterwards d'Elb√©e was transported first to Beaupr√©au, then the island of Noirmoutier. Three months later, the Republicans took control of the island and brought him before a military commission for a show trial. Condemned to death, he was executed by firing squad in the public square of the town of Noirmoutier. He was shot sitting in a chair, since he was unable to stand due to his fourteen wounds. Rochejaquelein, (1772-1794) a former royal cavalry officer, succeeded him as general of the Vend√©an force.Keegan, p. 251. Personal life He was married to Marguerite Charlotte Holly Hauterive on 17 November 1788 in the Church of the Gaubreti√®re, and therefore lived retired in a country very close to Beaupr√©au in Anjou. Marguerite d'Elb√©e was shot twenty days following the execution of her husband in January 1794 and buried in a sunken road. The remains of her body were discovered by chance much later. His son Louis-Joseph Maurice d'Elb√©e was born on 12 March 1793. Louis-Joseph Maurice d'Elb√©e was raised in Beaupr√©au. He served in the armies of Napoleon, where he distinguished himself in the Battle of Leipzig and the Battle of Hanau. Wounded in Hanau, he was taken prisoner and transported to the Potsdam hospital where he died the following year.

Nieder-Isenburg emerged in 1218 as a partition of the County of Isenburg-Isenburg. Nieder-Isenburg was partitioned twice: between Isenburg-Grenzau, Isenburg-Neumagen and itself in 1502, and between Isenburg- Grenzau and Isenburg-Neumagen in 1503. Following the death of Count Ernst of Isenburg in Brussels in 1664 without direct heir, the territories of Nieder- Isenburg were claimed back as a feudal tenure by the Archbishopric of Cologne, the Archbishopric of Trier and the core tenure of Isenburg and Grenzau by the Archbishopric of Fulda. The Fulda part was eventually passed on to the Counts of Walderdorff who had to share them with the Counts of Wied, at that stage a cadet branch of the Isenburgs, following a later agreement.

It was directed by Academy Award-winning filmmaker James Cameron after his 1997 Oscar-winning film Titanic. During August and September 2001, Cameron and a group of scientists staged an expedition to the wreck of the RMS Titanic, and dived in Russian deep- submersibles to obtain more detailed images than anyone had before. With the help of two small, purpose-built remotely operated vehicles, nicknamed \\"Jake\\" and \\"Elwood\\", the audience too can see inside the Titanic, and with the help of CGI, audiences can view the ship's original appearance superimposed on the deep-dive images. Also along for the ride Cameron invited his friend, actor Bill Paxton, who played Brock Lovett in the 1997 film. Paxton narrates the event through his eyes. The film premiered for IMAX 3D and was nominated for a BFCA award for Best Documentary. The submersibles Mir 1 and Mir 2 carried the filming team on 12 dives.47218_GotAEGv15_A The film is also known as Titanic 3D: Ghosts of the Abyss. Outline Director James Cameron returns to the site of the 1912 wreck of the RMS Titanic, aboard the Russian research vessel Akademik Mstislav Keldysh. With a team of history and marine experts, and his friend Bill Paxton, he embarks on an adventure back to the final grave of 1,517 people killed in 1912. Using technology developed for this expedition, Cameron and his crew are able to explore virtually all of the wreckage, inside and out, as never before. This documentary was made for IMAX 3D theatres and specially outfitted 35 mm 3D theaters. Cameron and his team bring audiences to sights not seen since the sinking and explore why the vessel continues to intrigue and fascinate the public.Anonymous Summary taken from IMDb While diving on September 11, 2001, the filming crew hears about the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

She saw little service before being laid up in reserve. During the Suez crisis she was used to land the transport for 45 Commando which was part of the first ever, operational helicopter assault. In 1964, she was converted into a dedicated helicopter training ship; this involved converting the deck in front of the superstructure into a landing platform. There was no hangar and minimal support facilities ‚Äì the ship was essentially a platform for practising landings at sea, and a deck to transport helicopters on. In 1967, the Lofoten was replaced in this role by the purpose built RFA Engadine.

When he launched his own Donmar company in 1953 he championed plays by Graham Greene, Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, Jean Anouilh, and an adaptation by J. B. Priestley of an Iris Murdoch novel. Though he was always commercially minded, his spirit of adventure endured with the first London production of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot and sponsorship of Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop. In 1961, Albery, in collaboration with William Donaldson, produced Beyond the Fringe in London and, in 1962, in New York. From 1964 to 1968, Albery served as director and administrator of the London Festival Ballet. Albery was knighted in 1977 for his services to the theatre. In 1982, Albery added his archive to the British theatre holdings of the Harry Ransom Center. Records include correspondence, legal and financial documents, scripts, sound recordings, prompt books, manuscript and printed music scores and parts, and printed and publicity materials such as clippings, programmes, playbills, posters, proofs and tickets concerning the theatrical productions and business affairs of Wyndham's Theatres Ltd., The Piccadilly Theatre Ltd., Sadler's Wells Theatre, the Royal Ballet, and the touring productions of the Festival Ballet.

Publication history The character is one of the first supervillains who became active during the \\"Silver Age\\" of Marvel Comics. He makes his first appearance as Paste-Pot Pete in Strange Tales #104 (January 1963), and as the Trapster in Fantastic Four #38. Fictional character biography Peter Petruski was born in Gary, Indiana. Originally calling himself Paste-Pot Pete, the villain and professional criminal clashed with the Human Torch during his efforts to sell a new American missile to the Soviets. However he escaped by using his paste to catch the wing of a plane, then diving into the sea.Strange Tales #104. Marvel Comics. Following a failed solo effort against Human Torch, Paste-Pot Pete broke out of jail and teamed with the Wizard in efforts to trump his youthful foe. However Paste-Pot Pete was angered over Wizard acting as the team's leader. Wizard framed Human Torch for a robbery. They got Human Torch to Wizard's house and used compressed air to force him into a chamber of steel mirrors, planning to fill the place with a gas that would cut off the oxygen supply of the Torch. However, Human Torch melted through the paste that held him to the floor, created a flaming duplicate to fool the two, then increased his flame enabling him to burn through the mirrors. The villains only realized this deception when the fake Human Torch faded away due to the gas, by which time Human Torch had regained his flame and captured the two in a flaming ring.Strange Tales #110. Marvel Comics. Pete later provided the Avengers with a solvent to dissolve Baron Zemo's Adhesive X, and was paroled from prison.Avengers #6. Marvel Comics. He adopted a new costume and weaponry, and battled Human Torch and the Thing using new paste types. He captured Thing, then Human Torch, but was still defeated.Strange Tales #124. Marvel Comics. Wizard and Pete would eventually team with the criminal Sandman and the Inhuman Medusa as the Frightful Four to battle the Fantastic Four.Fantastic Four #36. Marvel Comics. It was shortly after the formation of the Frightful Four that Pete abandoned his old alias and assumed the more intimidating name Trapster (the \\"Spider-Man/Human Torch\\" mini-series depicts the catalyst of the name change to be Spider-Man being unable to stop laughing when Paste-Pot Pete introduced himself). The Frightful Four would clash time and again with the Fantastic Four, often enjoying some measure of success in their efforts. Over the years, the membership of the Frightful Four would vary, but the man once known as Paste-Pot Pete would serve in virtually every incarnation in which Wizard served as well, loyal to his longtime boss. He changed his nom de crime to Trapster and appeared with new weaponry in Fantastic Four #38, with the second appearance of the Frightful Four, in an attempt to make himself sound more formidable. In this encounter, the Frightful Four was able to defeat the Fantastic Four.Fantastic Four #38. Marvel Comics. Over the years, a running gag in Marvel comics involved heroes and villains alike reminding Trapster of his earlier name of \\"Paste-Pot Pete\\" ‚Äî which would inevitably send him flying into a rage. A chance encounter with Balder once prevented the Frightful Four's takeover of Fantastic Four headquarters.Journey into Mystery #116. Marvel Comics. With the Frightful Four, he soon battled the Fantastic Four again,Fantastic Four #41-43. Marvel Comics. and then battled Daredevil.Daredevil #35-36. Marvel Comics.

Trapster has often sought independent recognition, battling virtually every \\"street-level\\" hero in the Marvel Universe either by design or by opposition to some criminal scheme. Trapster once even defeated Daredevil in single combat.Daredevil #35, Marvel Comics. The victory proved short-lived, as Doctor Doom interrupted his fight in a campaign of his own against Daredevil, and shortly thereafter the hero would avenge his defeat.Daredevil #36. Marvel Comics. Trapster also attempted to raid the Baxter Building (just before it was destroyed by the second Doctor Doom) while the Fantastic Four were away participating in the Secret Wars, but embarrassingly fell victim to the security systems and the robot receptionist, thus becoming the first villain to be defeated by an empty building.Fantastic Four #265 \\"The House that Reed Built\\".

However, he had a moment appreciated by the heroes when he was convinced to free Captain America and Giant-Man who were snared by Heinrich Zemo's powerful Adhesive X, by inventing the first ever means to neutralize the previously uncounterable chemical.Avengers #6. Marvel Comics. Saddened by constant defeats, Trapster would seek out the Tinkerer's aid in redesigning his arsenal. Adding wrist- pumps for his glue weaponry and a bandolier of various explosives and gimmicks, Trapster joined forces with the mutant villain Whirlwind in a bid to defeat Captain America. Despite his improved arsenal, both villains were defeated. The Trapster found his moment of victory over Spider-Man when he teamed up with the Shocker but, before the duo could finish Spider-Man off, their employers said their payment would be doubled if they left Spider-Man alone and they complied. He would later defeat Spider-Man in one-on-one combat after being enlisted to battle the wall-crawler as part of the \\"Acts of Vengeance\\" conspiracy; it was only through the merest quirk of fate that Spider-Man even survived the battle. However, when the Trapster learned of Spider-Man's survival and returned to finish the job, he would find the web- slinger now in possession of cosmic powers (eventually revealed to be a manifestation of the Uni-Power) with which Trapster was easily defeated.Spectacular Spider-Man #158. Marvel Comics. Later on, during the Identity Crisis story, Trapster would be hired by Norman Osborn to kill a man and make it seem like Spider-Man did it, and, in order to cover this up, Osborn put a price on Trapster's head, attracting assassins like the Hand and his previous ally Shocker.Spider-Man #91. Marvel Comics. Trapster unknowingly teamed up with Spider-Man - now using the Dusk alias-reasoning that the currently-lone Trapster would need an ally and someone to talk to in his currently vulnerable state‚Äîin an attempt to get back at Osborn, and would eventually confess his murder to the police in order to remove Osborn's reason for wanting him dead (although he kept the identity of his employer secret in case he needed it later).Spider-Man #92. Marvel Comics. During his tenure with a later Frightful Four incarnation (including Hydro-Man and the mysterious Salamandra), Wizard, tired of Trapster's failures and his general sniveling, callously sealed the villain in a repeating time-loop, a trap from which he can \\"never escape.\\" However, Petruski did indeed escape. During the Secret War storyline, Trapster was enlisted by Lucia von Bardas, the former prime minister of Latveria, and placed in her secret army of technology-based villains. She sent the army against Wolverine, Spider-Man, Luke Cage, Daredevil, and Captain America, the five heroes Nick Fury had sent to Latveria to stop Lucia‚Äôs secret criminal funding. When the battle started to turn in favor of the heroes, Lucia turned all the armor of her technological army into a bomb.

Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities The Trapster does not possess any superhuman powers, but relies on a variety of technological devices. He designed a costume of synthetic stretch fabric equipped with storage canisters for paste and lubricant, and adhesive-rigged boots and gloves to enable walking up walls. His primary weapon has always been projectile glue, initially delivered by a pistol connected by an armored tubing to a container on his person, then wrist paste-shooter cannons, and eventually shot straight from the tips of his gloves. He can shoot out a stream of liquid glue that immediately gels into a springy rope, allowing him to duplicate Spider-Man's web-shooters (to the point where he is the only person Spider-Man knows who can even create an approximate duplicate of his webbing). He was able to create a fire-proof paste. Pete also has designed boots that allow him to walk up walls by sequentially releasing a powerful glue and then a solvent. Petruski has also created lubricants that can render a surface frictionless, and discovered a way to dissolve the extremely powerful \\"Adhesive X\\" created by Baron Heinrich Zemo. Pete has also created a dust capable of rendering Mister Fantastic's unstable molecules inert. Trapster is an expert chemist, a skilled marksman, and a talented disguise artist. He has used other devices such as anti-gravity discs, explosive caps, ultrasound transmitters, an anti-gravity platform, and various mechanical traps used to restrain or entangle opponents.

McCarthy is perhaps best known for officiating numerous bouts promoted by the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), dating back to UFC 2. Biography The nickname of 'Big John' came about because of his size and stature. He stands 6'3\\" and weighs 260 lb; making him larger than the majority of the athletes over whom he presides. According to a UFC interview, the nickname was given to him by UFC co-founder and promoter Art Davie. McCarthy recalls that the nickname began when he forcibly lifted Davie off the ground and held him in the air. =UFC= McCarthy was the most senior referee in the UFC and is well known for his delivery of \\"Let's Get It On!\\", a catchphrase created by boxing referee Mills Lane. McCarthy served as one of the head referees for nearly every fight in the UFC from UFC 2 until UFC 77, and was considered as much a part of the UFC as the octagonal arena itself as he was the key figure in the writing of the current Unified Rules for the sport of MMA, which is now recognized by the ABC and Athletic Commissions across North America. His 535th bout was the main event at The Ultimate Fighter: Team Hughes vs. Team Serra finale in Las Vegas, Roger Huerta vs. Clay Guida. McCarthy briefly retired after this bout to pursue a career as a commentator for The Fight Network but returned to officiating just a year later. Since his return, McCarthy has refereed for promotions all over the globe including the UFC, K-1 (Japan), Strikeforce, Affliction, Bellator, King of the Cage and a multitude of others. His connection to the UFC was attributed to his relationship with the Gracie family, particularly Rorion Gracie. McCarthy had been training Brazilian jiu- jitsu under Rorion at the Gracie Academy in Torrance, CA in the early 1990s, and was designated a certified \\"GRAPLE\\" (Gracie Resisting Attack Procedures for Law Enforcement) instructor by the Gracie Academy in December 1993. When Rorion Gracie was putting together his new fighting promotion in 1993, McCarthy expressed interest in fighting for the UFC, but Gracie advised against it; however, due to his experience in law enforcement, McCarthy was seen as a fitting man to referee. He debuted at UFC 2: No Way Out in 1994. The early days of UFC did not contain many rules; McCarthy's role was only to supervise the fight and to ensure that it ended promptly when a competitor either submitted (also known as tap out), was knocked out, or had his towel thrown in. Although first disfavored by UFC executives, after UFC 2 McCarthy insisted on referee stoppages when a fighter cannot intelligently defend himself. On December 31, 2004, McCarthy served as the referee for a fight held on the K-1 Dynamite! card at the Osaka Dome in Osaka, Japan between MMA legend Royce Gracie and Sumo legend-turned-fighter Akebono Taro. On December 12, 2015, McCarthy served as the referee for UFC 194 between Conor McGregor and Jose Aldo, which became the shortest title bout (13 seconds) in UFC history. In 2018, McCarthy retired for the second time, and moved to Bellator as a commentator. Awards *World MMA Awards **Referee of the Year (Three times; 2015, 2016 and 2017) *MMA Freak **MMA Freak Hall of Fame Class of 2013 Personal life In September 2006, John McCarthy opened his first MMA school in Valencia, California. This gym was one of the largest MMA schools in California. McCarthy sold the school in December 2015. In January 2007, he was awarded his Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt. In early 2008, McCarthy started a referee and judging course for MMA officials called COMMAND (Certification of Officials for Mixed Martial Arts National Development). McCarthy has three children: sons, John Michael Jr. and Ronald II (after John Sr.'s father); daughter, Britney. Ron has been an MMA judge since 2013. Published work On September 1, 2011, McCarthy's autobiography, Let's Get It On - The Making of MMA and its Ultimate Referee, was published. Film and television McCarthy appeared with retired MMA fighter Bas Rutten in New Found Glory's video \\"Listen to Your Friends\\", where he refs MMA fights between the band members. The music video, which was shot on November 5, 2008 in Los Angeles, California, premiered on March 9, 2009. He has also appeared on the Fight Science episode Super Cops on national Geographic. McCarthy also appeared in the TV series Friends, season 3 episode 24 \\"The One with the Ultimate Fighting Champion\\" where he plays the referee of a UFC match between Tank Abbott and Jon Favreau. McCarthy also served as the referee on the MTV2 series Bully Beatdown, along with professional mixed martial artist Jason \\"Mayhem\\" Miller. McCarthy is featured in the award-winning mixed martial arts documentary Fight Life, the film is directed by James Z. Feng and released in 2013.

In the European Union, the semantic definition is 'mixed municipal waste,' given waste code 20 03 01 in the European Waste Catalog. Although the waste may originate from a number of sources that has nothing to do with a municipality, the traditional role of municipalities in collecting and managing these kinds of waste have produced the particular etymology 'municipal.' Composition The composition of municipal solid waste varies greatly from municipality to municipality, and it changes significantly with time. In municipalities which have a well developed waste recycling system, the waste stream mainly consists of intractable wastes such as plastic film and non-recyclable packaging materials. At the start of the 20th century, the majority of domestic waste (53%) in the UK consisted of coal ash from open fires.Centenary history of waste and waste managers in London and south east England- Page 7 In developed areas without significant recycling activity it predominantly includes food wastes, market wastes, yard wastes, plastic containers and product packaging materials, and other miscellaneous solid wastes from residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial sources.Non-hazardous Waste U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Municipal Solid Waste Most definitions of municipal solid waste do not include industrial wastes, agricultural wastes, medical waste, radioactive waste or sewage sludge.Municipal Solid Waste U.S. Energy Information Administration Waste collection is performed by the municipality within a given area. The term residual waste relates to waste left from household sources containing materials that have not been separated out or sent for processing.Mechanical Biological Treatment Welsh Assembly (2005) Mechanical Biological Treatment, Environment Countryside and Planning Website, Welsh Assembly Waste can be classified in several ways but the following list represents a typical classification: *Biodegradable waste: food and kitchen waste, green waste, paper (most can be recycled, although some difficult to compost plant material may be excluded) *Recyclable materials: paper, cardboard, glass, bottles, jars, tin cans, aluminum cans, aluminium foil, metals, certain plastics, textiles, clothing, tires, batteries, etc. *Inert waste: construction and demolition waste, dirt, rocks, debris *Electrical and electronic waste (WEEE) - electrical appliances, light bulbs, washing machines, TVs, computers, screens, mobile phones, alarm clocks, watches, etc. *Composite wastes: waste clothing, Tetra Pack food and drink cartons, waste plastics such as toys and plastic garden furniture *Hazardous waste including most paints, chemicals, tires, batteries, light bulbs, electrical appliances, fluorescent lamps, aerosol spray cans, and fertilizers *Toxic waste including pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides *Biomedical waste, expired pharmaceutical drugs, etc. For example, typical municipal solid waste in China is composed of 55.9% food residue, 8.5% paper, 11.2% plastics, 3.2% textiles, 2.9% wood waste, 0.8% rubber, and 18.4% non-combustibles.  Components of solid waste management  paper, aluminium, glass, PET bottles and incinerable waste. The municipal solid waste industry has four components: recycling, composting, disposal, and waste-to-energy via incineration.Nonhazardous waste U.S. Energy Information Administration There is no single approach that can be applied to the management of all waste streams, therefore the Environmental Protection Agency, a U.S. federal government agency, developed a hierarchy ranking strategy for municipal solid waste. The waste management hierarchy is made up of four levels ordered from most preferred to least preferred methods based on their environmental soundness: Source reduction and reuse; recycling or composting; energy recovery; treatment and disposal. = Collection = The functional element of collection includes not only the gathering of solid waste and recyclable materials, but also the transport of these materials, after collection, to the location where the collection vehicle is emptied. This location may be a materials processing facility, a transfer station or a landfill disposal site. = Waste handling and separation, storage and processing at the source = Waste handling and separation involves activities associated with waste management until the waste is placed in storage containers for collection. Handling also encompasses the movement of loaded containers to the point of collection. Separating different types of waste components is an important step in the handling and storage of solid waste at the source of collection. = Segregation and processing and transformation of solid wastes = The types of means and facilities that are now used for the recovery of waste materials that have been separated at the source include curbside ('kerbside' in the UK) collection, drop-off and buy-back centers. The separation and processing of wastes that have been separated at the source and the separation of commingled wastes usually occur at a materials recovery facility, transfer stations, combustion facilities and treatment plants. = Transfer and transport = This element involves two main steps. First, the waste is transferred from a smaller collection vehicle to larger transport equipment. The waste is then transported, usually over long distances, to a processing or disposal site. = Disposal = Mixed municipal waste, Hiriya, Tel Aviv Today, the disposal of wastes by land filling or land spreading is the ultimate fate of all solid wastes, whether they are residential wastes collected and transported directly to a landfill site, residual materials from materials recovery facilities (MRFs), residue from the combustion of solid waste, compost, or other substances from various solid waste processing facilities. A modern sanitary landfill is not a dump; it is an engineered facility used for disposing of solid wastes on land without creating nuisances or hazards to public health or safety, such as the problems of insects and the contamination of ground water. = Reusing = In the recent years environmental organizations, such as Freegle or Freecycle Network, have been gaining popularity for their online reuse networks. These networks provide a worldwide online registry of unwanted items that would otherwise be thrown away, for individuals and nonprofits to reuse or recycle. Therefore, this free Internet-based service reduces landfill pollution and promotes the gift economy. =Landfills= Landfills are created by land dumping. Land dumping methods vary, most commonly it involves the mass dumping of waste into a designated area, usually a hole or sidehill. After the waste is dumped, it is then compacted by large machines. When the dumping cell is full, it is then \\"sealed\\" with a plastic sheet and covered in several feet of dirt. This is the primary method of dumping in the United States because of the low cost and abundance of unused land in North America. Landfills are regulated in the US by the Environmental Protection Agency, which enforces standards provided in the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, such as requiring liners and groundwater monitoring.Horinko, Marianne, Cathryn Courtin. ‚ÄúWaste Management: A Half Century of Progress.‚Äù EPA Alumni Association. March 2016. This is because landfills pose the threat of pollution and can contaminate ground water. The signs of pollution are effectively masked by disposal companies and it is often hard to see any evidence. Usually landfills are surrounded by large walls or fences hiding the mounds of debris. Large amounts of chemical odor eliminating agent are sprayed in the air surrounding landfills to hide the evidence of the rotting waste inside the plant. = Energy generation = Municipal solid waste can be used to generate energy. Several technologies have been developed that make the processing of MSW for energy generation cleaner and more economical than ever before, including landfill gas capture, combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, and plasma arc gasification. While older waste incineration plants emitted a lot of pollutants, recent regulatory changes and new technologies have significantly reduced this concern. United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations in 1995 and 2000 under the Clean Air Act have succeeded in reducing emissions of dioxins from waste-to-energy facilities by more than 99 percent below 1990 levels, while mercury emissions have been reduced by over 90 percent. The EPA noted these improvements in 2003, citing waste-to-energy as a power source \\"with less environmental impact than almost any other source of electricity\\".U.S. EPA Letter to Maria Zannes, President, Integrated Waste Services Association See also * :Category:Waste by country * Garbology (study of modern refuse and trash) * List of waste management acronyms * MSW/LFG (municipal solid waste and landfill gas) * Sewage * Waste management * Waste minimisation * Global waste trade References Further reading Category:Waste ","title":"Municipal solid waste"},{"id":"2149155","title":"Larry Poindexter"},{"id":"2149156","text":"Mantralaya may refer to: *Mantralayam, Andhra Pradesh, India, a major center of pilgrimage for Hindus belonging to the Madhva sect *Mantralaya, Mumbai, administrative headquarters of Maharashtra in South Mumbai, built in 1955 ","title":"Mantralaya"},{"id":"2149168","text":"Maria Justine Elliot MP (born 29 July 1967), an Australian politician, is the Labor member for the Australian House of Representatives seat of Richmond since the 2004 federal election. Between 2007 and 2010, Elliot was the Minister for Ageing. Background and early career Elliot was born in Brisbane, Queensland and was educated at the University of Queensland, where she graduated in Arts. She was a Queensland Police officer between 1990 and 1997 and was later Juvenile Justice Conference Convener with the New South Wales Department of Juvenile Justice. Elliot also holds a Graduate Diploma in Human Resource Management & Industrial Relations from Griffith University. Political career In a considerable upset at the 2004 election, Elliot defeated the National Party's Larry Anthony, a minister in the Howard government. Elliot's win was one of the few victories for the Labor Party as the Coalition easily won a fourth term in government. She was only the second Labor member ever to win the seat, and was also the only Labor challenger to defeat a Coalition MP in a rural seat. Richmond had been in the hands of a conservative party for all but six years since Federation, and for 66 of those years by the National Party. For much of that time, it had been a reasonably safe National seat. However, the growth of Tweed Heads and other coastal communities, as well as the concurrent loss of its more rural territory, has seen it become an increasingly urban seat since the 1980s. Elliot trailed Anthony by 11 points on the first count and was well behind him for most of the night. However, on the seventh count, a Green candidate's preferences flowed overwhelmingly to Elliot, allowing her to defeat Anthony by 301 votes. The 2007 election saw Elliot re-elected over the Nationals' Sue Page. She picked up a swing of over 7.4 points, which was significantly larger than the New South Wales state average and technically made Richmond a safe Labor seat. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced she would be part of his new ministry on 29 November 2007, as Minister for Ageing. She retained the seat at the 2010 election with only a small swing against Labor. She stepped aside as Minister for Ageing ahead of the formation of the Second Gillard Ministry on 11 September 2010. On 11 September 2010 Elliot was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and held this position until a reconfiguration of the ministry on 4 February 2013 when she became a backbencher. She publicly announced that this was because of her opposition to coal-seam gas mining (CSG) in the electorate, which conflicted with the role of Parliamentary Secretary.https://www.tweeddailynews.com.au/news/justine- elliot-defends-her-stand-against-csg/1750319/ Elliot retained Richmond for Labor at the 2013 election even as the Coalition opposition defeated the incumbent Labor government, marking only the second time (the first being her initial victory in 2004) that the non-Labor parties had been in government without holding Richmond. She again won with an increased majority at the 2016 election. Current positions Elliot has been the Chair of the Federal Labor Country Caucus since 2014,http://www.joelfitzgibbon.com/rural_and_regional_australia_goes_to_the_top_of_labor_s_agenda and the Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Petitions since 2016.https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=DZW See also * First Rudd Ministry * First Gillard Ministry References External links * Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Labor Right politicians Category:Australian police officers Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives for Richmond Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives Category:Former government ministers of Australia Category:Women members of the Australian House of Representatives Category:Griffith University alumni Category:University of Queensland alumni Category:Politicians from Brisbane Category:Women government ministers of Australia Category:Women police officers Category:21st-century Australian politicians Category:21st-century Australian women politicians ","title":"Justine Elliot"},{"id":"2149169","text":"Murshid () is Arabic for \\"guide\\" or \\"teacher\\", derived from the root r-sh-d, with the basic meaning of having integrity, being sensible, mature.See Hans Wehr's Arabic Dictionary, 4th ed., s.v. ra≈°ada. Particularly in Sufism it refers to a spiritual guide. The term is frequently used in Sufi orders such as the Naqshbandiyya, Qadiriyya, Chishtiya, Shadhiliya and Suhrawardiyya. The path of Sufism starts when a student (Murid) takes an oath of allegiance or Bay'ah (bai'ath) with a spiritual guide (murshid). In speaking of this initiatory pact of allegiance, the Qur‚Äô ÃÑan (48:10) says: Verily they who pledge unto thee their allegiance pledge it unto none but God. The Hand of God is above their hands.Cf. Martin Lings, What is Sufism, Islamic Texts Society, Cambridge, p. 125. The murshid's role is to spiritually guide and verbally instruct the disciple on the Sufi path, but \\"only one who has himself reached the End of the path is a spiritual guide in the full sense of the Arabic term murshid\\". A murshid usually has authorisation to be a teacher for one tariqa (spiritual paths). Any tariqa or silsila has one murshid at a time who is the head of the spiritual order. He is known as the shaykh, by way of khilafah: process in which the shaykh identifies one of his disciples as his successor, for the khalifa. Importance In Sufism, it is the transmission of the divine light from the murshid's heart to the disciple's which surpasses any other source of knowledge and is the only way to progress directly towards the divine. The concept of Murshid Kamil Akmal (also known as Insan-e-Kamil) is significant in most tariqas. The concept states that from pre-existence till pre-eternity, there shall always remain a Qutb or a Universal Man upon the earth who would be the perfect manifestation of God and at the footsteps of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.
