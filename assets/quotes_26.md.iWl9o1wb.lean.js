He played on offense as a fullback, defense as a linebacker, and special teams as a kicker and punter. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of its second class of inductees in 1964. Known as one of the toughest players in the era of iron man football, Hinkle played for the Green Bay Packers from 1932 to 1941 and held the all-time National Football League (NFL) records for rushing yardage and carries when his playing career ended. He led the NFL in touchdowns (seven) in 1937, in points scored (58) in 1938, and in field goals made and field goal percentage in both 1940 and 1941. He was selected as a first- or second-team All-Pro in each of his 10 NFL seasons and helped lead the Packers to three NFL championship games and NFL championships in 1936 and 1939. His playing career was cut short in 1942 by military service. A native of Toronto, Ohio, Hinkle played college football for Bucknell from 1929 to 1931. He scored 50 points in a single game as a sophomore and led Bucknell to an undefeated season in 1931. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1971. Early years William Clarke Hinkle was born in Toronto, Ohio, located on the Ohio River approximately 40 miles west of Pittsburgh, in 1909. He was the son of Charles Hinkle and Lillian Ault Clark, both Ohio natives. His father was an engineer and later a forger at a steel mill.1920 U.S. Census entry for Charles Hinkle and family. Son William C. age 10 born in Ohio.1930 U.S. Census entry for Charles Hinkle and family. Hinkle attended Toronto High School. College Hinkle played college football for Bucknell University, where he set several records for the Bucknell Bison football team as a fullback playing offense and defense. He scored eight touchdowns and scored 50 points in a game against Dickinson on Thanksgiving Day 1929. He finished the 1929 season with 21 touchdowns and 128 points scored. He had 37 touchdowns over his career at Bucknell from 1929 to 1931. In 1929, he led the East in scoring with 128 points. In 1931, he led the team to a 6‚Äì0‚Äì3 win-loss record. Hinkle's coach at Bucknell, Carl Snavely, called him: \\"Without a doubt, the greatest defensive back I have ever seen or coached.\\" Hinkle played for the East team in the East-West Shrine Game in San Francisco on New Year's Day 1932. He was the leading ground gainer in the game, and a United Press correspondent wrote: \\"If there was a single star in the long drawn battle of line plunges and punting it was Clark [sic] Hinkle of Bucknell whose stabs through tackle were a revelation in driving power.\\" While at Bucknell University he became a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.https://nicfraternity.org/wp- content/uploads/2018/06/fraternity_men_in_nfl_hall_of_fame-updated-6-18.pdf Professional football In January 1932, after watching Hinkle play in the Shrine Game, Curly Lambeau signed Hinkle to play professional football for the Green Bay Packers. At the time, the Packers were the best team in the NFL, having won three consecutive NFL championships from 1929 to 1931. Hinkle played for the Packers for his entire ten-year NFL career, was selected as a first- or second-team All-Pro every year, and helped lead the Packers to NFL championships in 1936 and 1939. As a rookie in 1932, Hinkle appeared in 13 games and led the Packers with 331 rushing yards on 95 carries. He quickly developed a reputation not only for his two-way play on both offense and defense, but also as the best punter in the NFL. The 1932 Packers finished second in the NFL with a 10‚Äì3‚Äì1 record, and Hinkle was selected as a first- team All-Pro in 1932 by Collyer's Eye magazine and as the second-team fullback (behind Bronko Nagurski) on the United Press (UP) and NFL All-Pro teams. He was hailed by Curly Lambeau at the end of the 1932 season as a second Jim Thorpe, and by some critics as \\"the greatest football player in the world today.\\" After spending the off-season working for a steel construction firm in his home town of Toronto, Ohio, Hinkle returned to Green Bay in September 1933. In his second NFL season, Hinkle again led the team with 413 rushing yards, but the Packers' record fell to 5‚Äì7‚Äì1, the only losing season suffered by the Packers in their first 25 years in the NFL. Despite the team's poor showing, Hinkle was selected as a second-team All-Pro by the UP, Chicago Daily News, and Green Bay Press-Gazette. Hinkle presented a rare combination of power, speed, and accurate kicking. In 1937, he led the NFL with seven touchdowns and ranked second with 552 rushing yards. In 1938, he led the NFL in scoring with 58 points scored on seven touchdowns, seven extra points, and three field goals. He led the NFL in field goals and field goal percentage in both 1940 and 1941. He also continued to excel as a punter, ranking second in the NFL in punting yards in 1939 and averaging 44.5 yards per punt in 1941. Hinkle's playing career was cut short after the 1941 season by wartime military service. He began his NFL career in 1932 at a salary of $5,000 and had his salary cut during the Great Depression, then restored to $5,000 in the late 1930s. He held out for and received $10,000 in his final season. He finished his career with 3,860 rushing yards, 537 receiving yards, 316 passing yards, and 379 points scored on 44 touchdowns, 28 field goals, and 31 extra points. Reputation for toughness Hinkle loved the intense physicality of football. According to one account, \\"Clark Hinkle loved contact. It didn't matter which side of the ball he was coming from, Hinkle loved delivering blows.\\" Ken Strong, another Hall of Fame back of the era, remembered the force of Hinkle's tackles: \\"When he hit you, you knew you were hit. Bells rang and you felt it all the way to your toes.\\" Another back, Johnny Sisk, said: \\"No one in the whole league ever bruised me more than Hinkle did. . . . Hinkle had a lot of leg action. I broke my shoulder twice tackling Mr. Hinkle.\\" Hinkle's competition with Chicago Bears fullback Bronko Nagurski were especially memorable. Hinkle was the only player to knock Nagurski out of a game, and according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Hinkle's \\"creed was 'get to the Bronk before he gets to me.'\\" Hinkle cited a 1934 collision with Nagurski as his greatest day in football. He recalled: \\"I was carrying the ball and Nagurski charged in to make the tackle. WHAM! We banged into each other. Nagurski had to be removed from the game with a broken nose and two closed eyes. Strangely enough, I suffered no ill effects and was able to continue playing.\\" Nagurski later called Hinkle the \\"toughest man I ever played against.\\" In the book, \\"Pain Gang: Pro Football's Fifty Toughest Players\\", Neil Reynolds included both Hinkle and Nagurski on his list of the toughest players in the history of the game.Reynolds, Pain Gang, p. 65. Hinkle's toughness remained to the end. On November 2, 1941, in his final game against the Chicago Bears, Hinkle had his leg torn open by an opponent's spike but returned late in the game to kick a game-winning field goal from the 44-yard line. Honors and records When Hinkle's playing career ended, he held NFL career records with 3,860 rushing yards and 1,171 carries. He surpassed the old record of 3,511 rushing yards held by Cliff Battles. Hinkle's rushing yardage record stood until 1949 when it was broken by Steve Van Buren. Hinkle received multiple honors and awards arising out of his accomplishments as a football player, including the following: * In 1950, he was one of the 25 inaugural inductees into the Helms Athletic Foundation's professional football hall of fame. * In 1957, he was selected as the fullback on the All-Time Packer Team. * In 1964, he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of its second induction class. * In 1969, he was named to the NFL 1930s All-Decade Team. * In 1971, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. * In 1972, he was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame. * In 1979, he was inducted into the Bucknell Hall of Fame. * In 1985, Toronto High School named its \\"Clarke Hinkle Stadium\\" in his honor. * In 1994, he was named to the NFL's 75th Anniversary All-Time Two Way Team.2001 NFL Record and Fact Book, Edited by Randall Liu, p. 402, Workman Publishing, 2001, * In 1997, the Packers' west practice field across Oneida Street from Lambeau Field was dedicated as \\"Clarke Hinkle Field\\". Family, military service, and later years Hinkle's older brother Gordie Hinkle played minor league baseball as a catcher from 1930 to 1941 and for the Boston Red Sox in 1934. In December 1936, Hinkle was married in New York to Emilie Cobden. His marriage ended immediately after World War II owing to difficulty readjusting to civilian life, causing Hinkle to, in his own words \\"get off the beam a little bit\\" and go \\"a little haywire.\\"Quoted in Myron Cope, The Game That Was. New York: World Publishing Co., 1970; pg. 97. After his divorce, Hinkle married again, but the union lasted only 33 days. In May 1942, following the United States entry into World War II, Hinkle enlisted in the United States Coast Guard and received the rank of lieutenant. In the fall of 1942, he served as an assistant football coach at the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut. He also played five games for New London's professional Electric Boat Diesel football team. He later served on convoy duty in the North African Campaign and as an air-sea rescuer off Newfoundland. Hinkle was discharged from the Coast Guard in 1946 and began working for Kimberly-Clark in Neenah, Wisconsin. He later lived in Steubenville, Ohio, working as a sales representative for an industrial supply company. He also worked in the late 1960s as a sports desk anchor for an Ohio television station. He died in Steubenville in 1988 at age 79 following a long illness. He was buried at Toronto Union Cemetery in Toronto, Ohio.

It marks the return of John Leeson as the voice of K9. In the serial, a criminal organisation of alien Foamasi called the West Lodge attempt to buy the planet Argolis from the Argolin people there as a West Lodge base. Meanwhile, the young Argolin Pangol (David Haig) seeks to start a war against the Foamasi his people had previously lost to with an army made up of clones of himself. Plot The Fourth Doctor and Romana's holiday in Brighton ends abruptly when K9 chases a ball and takes in seawater and explodes. They instead venture to the Leisure Hive of Argolis, a holiday complex and message of peace built by surviving Argolins after their devastating 20-minute war with the Foamasi forty years earlier. They arrive at a point of crisis: the Leisure Hive is facing bankruptcy (because of falling tourist trade due to stiff competition from other leisure planets) and the Argolins' Earth agent, Brock, and his lawyer Klout have arrived bearing an offer to buy the planet outright. However, the offer is from the Foamasi, the only species that could live on the planet's radiation-infused surface, and the Argolin board will not consider it. The shock of events causes Board Chairman Morix's rapid death ‚Äì from the Argolin war curse of advanced cellular degradation ‚Äì and his consort Mena is declared the new Chairman. The Doctor is intrigued by the manipulation of tachyons in the Hive‚Äôs Tachyon Recreation Generator, which is the main tourist attraction and can duplicate and manipulate organic matter. He witnesses a human tourist being killed after it is sabotaged in the latest of a series of acts of deliberate damage. No sooner has Mena returned to Argolis than her own body clock begins to speed up, a side-effect of the radiation-heavy atmosphere. Earth scientist Hardin has been brought to Argolis to help her and her people by using time experiments to rejuvenate a people rendered sterile by the war. Recognising their value as scientists, Mena, instead of confining them, engages the Doctor and Romana to help Hardin with his work. The time travellers know Hardin has been faking his work, but Romana feels that the experiments should have worked. After discovering a skin of Klout in a wardrobe, Stimson, Hardin's financier, who travelled with him and persuaded him to fake the demonstrations, is brutally murdered and the Doctor is blamed. He is put on trial while Romana and Hardin perfect the time experiments. Just in time, they succeed and are able to bargain for the Doctor's freedom. However, after they leave, the hourglass of their experiment shatters. Due to her worsening condition, Mena volunteers to be the first guinea pig to test the time experiment, but the Doctor is selected instead. The machine malfunctions while he is inside and he emerges ‚Äì having aged 500 hundred years ‚Äì an old man with flowing white hair. Mena's son, Pangol, the most warlike and vindictive of the Argolins, orders that the Doctor and Romana be confined. Hardin later frees them, which is when the slower-witted Doctor notices something odd about the name Recreation Chamber. Romana sees it too, eventually: recreation is re-creation, the repeated creation of things or people. Sneaking back to the Recreation Room, the trio discover a group of Argolins, led by Pangol, performing dangerous experiments in order to perfect a secret project, under the guise of entertainment. Meanwhile, Brock and Klout bring a new offer from a mysterious organisation called West Lodge. It is then, while tearing up the offer, that Pangol reveals the secret of his past and the reason he is the only young Argolin in the Hive. He was the only successful, undeformed child from a cloning experiment meant to save the Argolin using the Recreation Generator. But, driven insane by hatred of the Foamasi and a xenophobic fear of all aliens, he lusts for a war-forged empire like that of their ancestor Theron (who started the war and doomed the Argolins to extinction). He needs an alien witness to his taking Mena's place after her death, and to the beginning of \\"New Argolis\\". The Doctor, Romana and Hardin find Foamasi agents in the Hive and escort them to the council chamber, where the agents reveal Brock and Klout to be Foamasi impersonators. The lead agent reveals West Lodge to be a criminal group who need Argolis as a base of operations. With the leader, Brock, captured, the organisation is doomed to fold and the Foamasi prepare to take the rogues for trial. Pangol refuses to let them pass, and takes up the Helmet of Theron (a sacred symbol for Argolins and a reminder to espouse peace and understanding) and rallies the Argolins to his cause. The Doctor, seeing what he is up to, takes the Randomiser from the TARDIS and attaches it to the Recreation Chamber, hoping to destabilise the mechanism. Romana tries to dissuade Pangol from using the Generator, but fails. The Foamasi shuttle tries to leave and is destroyed by Pangol, who dons the Helmet of Theron and uses the Generator to create an army of Tachyon replicas, in order to rebuild the Argolin race. He orders that Romana be put outside, while Hardin finds Mena dying and carries her to the Generator room. As Romana is taken, the clones are revealed to be merely tachyon images of a rejuvenated Doctor built up in a FIFO stack; first in, first out. She and the first Doctor to emerge (the real one) return to the Generator Room, where Hardin has put Mena into the Recreation Generator. Pangol, enraged that the Doctor has foiled his attempt to create an army, reenters the Generator, which closes behind him. The Doctor reveals that he set the machine to \\"rejuvenate\\", and it cannot be stopped. Pangol and Mena seem to be merging, so the Doctor grabs the Helmet of Theron and throws it into the visualising crystal, stopping the mechanism. Mena exits rejuvenated, holding Pangol, who has regressed to a baby. The Foamasi agents reappear, revealing that the West Lodge criminals tried to escape in the shuttle (so, in the words of the Doctor \\"Brock and Klout are kaput\\"). Against Romana's advice, the Doctor leaves the Argolins and Foamasi to make up and the Randomiser attached to the Recreation Generator (thus leaving the TARDIS vulnerable to the Black Guardian). Production Working titles for this story included The Argolins and Avalon. Writer David Fisher conceived of the Foamasi as a race of organised criminals. \\"Foamasi\\" is a near-anagram of \\"mafioso\\". The episode was written as a satire of the decline of tourism in the United Kingdom in the 1970s. The alien costume used for the Foamasi was later reused in the 1981 BBC The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as the leader of the G'Gugvuntt. A new TARDIS prop is introduced in this episode which replaces the one used since The Masque of Mandragora (1976). This prop would be used right until the end of the original series' production in 1989. The Randomiser, which had been introduced in The Armageddon Factor was ditched in Part Four of this story. This was also the first story to use the Quantel DPE 5000 digital image processing system. Filming on the story ran badly over budget. The opening sequence on Brighton beach is John Nathan-Turner's paean to Visconti's celebrated 1971 feature film \\"Death in Venice\\". =Format changes= This was the first Doctor Who story which John Nathan-Turner produced. Nathan-Turner was keen to get away from what he considered the excessive silliness of recent Doctor Who stories, and wanted to increase the series' production values, because he felt that they were poor when compared with glossy American science-fiction series. Among the changes Nathan-Turner instituted was the scaling back of K9's appearances (the unit is out of commission for most of this serial), eventually writing the character out in Warriors' Gate. Nathan-Turner would produce Doctor Who until 1989. In a further attempt to update the image of the series, the original 1963 Delia Derbyshire arrangement of the theme music was replaced by a more contemporary-sounding arrangement by Peter Howell, and a new, '80s-styled neon tubing logo (which was en-vogue at the time) designed by Sid Sutton replaced the diamond logo most associated with the Fourth Doctor. The updated title sequence is most associated with the Fifth Doctor. Tom Baker, Lalla Ward, Barry Letts and Christopher H. Bidmead all protested about John Nathan- Turner's decision to add question-marks to Baker's shirts, arguing that it was gimmicky. Baker in particular was unhappy with it and told Nathan-Turner that it was \\"annoying, absurd and ridiculous\\", while Bidmead later called it \\"a silly, quite absurd gimmick really\\". Bidmead, who found working with Tom Baker \\"difficult to say the very least\\", supposedly told Baker and Nathan-Turner during recording of The Leisure Hive that exclamation marks would have been more appropriate for Baker's shirts. The Seventh Doctor Sylvester McCoy would later protest his question-mark adorned jumper in similar terms, but the question-mark motif would remain until the end of the classic series in 1989. Baker also disliked his new scarf, requesting that his old multi-coloured one be re-instated, but expressed gratitude to costume designer June Hudson for refusing to adhere to Nathan-Turner's demands to ditch the trademark scarf altogether and managing to find a compromise. The show's stars took exception to many of John Nathan-Turner's other changes as well, with Tom Baker and Lalla Ward criticising the change in theme music and opening titles. Baker also criticised the new synthesised incidental music, comparing it unfavourably with Dudley Simpson's earlier scores. Ward later complained that Nathan-Turner had \\"removed all the lovely humour\\", while Baker said that he wanted the scripts to improve and regain some of the quality of those of the Philip Hinchcliffe era, as he felt that the quality of the scripts and storylines had declined under Graham Williams. He later said that he felt such improvements did not by and large occur, and that most of Nathan-Turner's changes were either cosmetic or misguided. Many of the new special effects introduced in this story were never used again to the extent on display here. =Cast notes= Laurence Payne had previously played Johnny Ringo in The Gunfighters (1966) and later played Dastari in The Two Doctors (1985).

(), is a fabless semiconductor company situated in the Hsinchu Science Park, Hsinchu, Taiwan. Realtek was founded in October 1987 and subsequently listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in 1998. Realtek currently manufactures and sells a variety of microchips globally and its product lines broadly fall into three categories: communications network ICs, computer peripheral ICs, and multimedia ICs. As of 2019, Realtek employs 5,000 people, of whom 78% work in research and development.  Products  * Communication network IC products manufactured and marketed by Realtek include: network interface controllers (both the traditional 10/100M Ethernet controllers and the more advanced gigabit Ethernet controllers), physical layer controllers (PHYceivers), network switch controllers, gateway controllers, wireless LAN ICs, as well as ADSL router controllers. In particular, the RTL8139 series 10/100M Fast Ethernet controllers reached their height during the late 1990s, and continued to take up a significant, and eventually predominant share in the worldwide market in the following years. * Those devices categorized as Realtek's computer peripheral IC products consist of the traditional AC'97 audio codecs, the High Definition Audio codecs, card reader controllers, clock generators and IEEE 1394 ICs. * Multimedia IC products include LCD Monitor Controllers, LCD TV Controllers and Digital Media Processors.

Notable Realtek products include 10/100M Ethernet controllers (with a global market share of 70% as of 2003) and audio codecs (AC'97 and Intel HD Audio), where Realtek had a 50% market share in 2003 and a 60% market share in 2004, primarily concentrated in the integrated OEM on-board audio market-segment. the ALC892 HD Audio codec and RTL8111 Gigabit Ethernet chip have become particular OEM favorites, offering low prices and basic feature- sets. RTL8139-based NICs are dubbed \\"crab cards\\" in Taiwan, alluding to the crab-like appearance of the Realtek logo. =Chipsets for HD multimedia players and recorders = EGA graphic card with Realtek RTG3101 The increasing popularity of HD media players in 2009 led to the entry of Realtek into that market. The first series, the 1xx3 models sold at a lower price than similar quality chipsets of Realtek's competitors. (The main competitors were the Sigma Media Players.) Realtek produced three major versions of Realtek 1xx3 and several minor variations. The three major 1xx3 chipset versions (1073, 1183, and 1283) all featured the same chip in terms of format support and performance, the only difference being the added ability to record AV sources in the 1283. HD Audio support in the 1xx3 improved through the chipset's life with several revisions. The DD and CC versions of the chipset both added full 7.1 HD-audio support to the chipset. The 1073 players all built on a common SDK (firmware+OS) provided by Realtek. This meant that they were all essentially similar in performance and interface. It also meant that producing these players was very easy for manufacturers, all they had to do was create the hardware and Realtek provided the software. Key players from the Realtek 1073 era were the original Xtreamer, the Asus O!PlayHD, ACRyan PlayOn and the Mede8er MED500X. Manufacturers released hundreds of Realtek 1073 players. In early 2011 Realtek released series 1xx5, including the 1055, and 1185. These are the successors to the 1073 series. All three chips ran at 500Mhz which provided a small performance increase. Otherwise, the chips offered the same comprehensive format support as the previous generation. All chips ran the same Realtek SDK4 Casablanca, which offered improved user-experience (aesthetically, added media indexing, thumbnails...) from the stock SDK. As with the later version of the 1xx8 chipset, full 7.1 HD-audio downmix and passthrough are supported in the 1xx5. Realtek released the next generation of its chipsets, the 1xx6 series 1186, in early October 2011. These ran at 750Mhz, supported HDMI 1.4, were capable of 3D including 3D ISO, and were able to dual-boot into Android. Key 1186 players include the Mede8er X3D Series (MED1000X3D, MED800X3D, MED600X3D), Xtreamer Prodigy 3D and HiMedia 900B.  Security breach  According to the comprehensive analysis released by Symantec in 2011 regarding the Stuxnet virus, Realtek's digital certificate for Windows was compromised, allowing attackers to digitally sign malicious drivers without users being notified. The certificate was then revoked by Verisign: \\"The attackers would have needed to obtain the digital certificates from someone who may have physically entered the premises of the two companies (Realtek and JMicron) and stole them, as the two companies are in close physical proximity.\\" states the report.

It was originally published as a serial in Pilote issues 399‚Äì421 in 1967. The book is inspired by the battle of Alesia, where the Gaulish warrior chief Vercingetorix surrendered to Julius Caesar. However, only the very end of the actual battle appears in the book ‚Äì the main plot concerns what happened after the battle. This episode, like Asterix and the Cauldron, is plotted like a detective novel, with a mystery to be solved at the very end. Plot summary The book begins with Vercingetorix conceding defeat to Julius Caesar. His surrendered weapons remain at Caesar's chair for several hours, until a Roman archer steals Vercingetorix's famous shield, which he loses in a game of dice to another legionary, who then loses it to a drunken centurion, in return for the centurion not reporting him for a military offence. The centurion himself uses the shield to pay for a jar of wine at a nearby Gaulish inn; later, the shield is given by the innkeeper to a survivor of the Battle of Alesia. Following this prologue, Chief Vitalstatistix is made helpless by a sore liver, a consequence of overeating and drinking at his last banquet. Having demonstrated this, and temporarily eased the chief's pain, the druid Getafix sends Vitalstatistix to a hydrotherapeutic center in Arverne to be cured, with Asterix and Obelix (and Dogmatix) as his escort. On the way, they stop at various inns, where the heavy food revives the chief's sickness. At Arverne, the Gauls initially remain together; but because Asterix, Obelix, and Dogmatix are in no need of special diets, they feast on wild boar and beer while everyone else eats \\"boiled vegetables\\". When other patients complain, Vitalstatistix sends Asterix, Obelix, and Dogmatix to Gergovia. Along the way, the Gauls are offended by Roman envoy Noxius Vapus, and vanquish his guards. In the aftermath, Asterix, Obelix, and Dogmatix befriend the local tavern-keeper Winesanspirix, who retains them thereafter as guests. When Noxius Vapus makes his report to Caesar in Rome, Caesar plans a triumph on Vercingetorix's shield to \\"show them who's boss\\", and orders Vapus to search Arverne for it. When the initial investigations fail, the Romans send a spy, Legionary Pusillanimus; but on drinking too much wine at Winesanspirix's tavern, the latter discloses Caesar's plan and reveals his own knowledge of the shield's history, whereupon Asterix, Obelix, and Dogmatix set off in search of the shield themselves. To that end, they interrogate the archer, Lucius Circumbendibus, who now owns a wheel manufacturing business; the second legionary, Marcus Carniverus, who worked at a health resort before opening a restaurant; and the drunken Centurion Crapulus. Vapus and his men in turn search in vain for both the shield and Asterix and Obelix, as a running gag dirtying themselves with charcoal dust while searching the coal heaps belonging to Winesanspirix and their neighbors. The search eventually leads the two Gauls back to Winesanspirix, to whom Crapulus had given the shield in the prologue. Upon the protagonists' reunion with him, Winesanspirix confesses having given the shield to a dispirited Gaulish warrior, who is thereupon identified with the arrival of a newly cured and much slimmer Vitalstatistix. Vitalstatistix reveals he had the shield the whole time and it is the very one he is always carried upon. Upon Caesar's arrival at Gergovia, Asterix and the locals organize a triumph in which Vitalstatistix is carried on Vercingetorix's shield. Caesar then deports Vapus and his troops to Numidia, and Caesar promotes Centurion Crapulus to command of the garrison of Gergovia, and Legionary Pusillanimus to Centurion, on the grounds that they are the only \\"clean\\" legionaries present (despite both being visibly drunk). The Gauls return to their village (Vitalstatistix regaining his customary weight at the inns visited earlier in the story) to celebrate; but Vitalstatistix is forced into abstinence from the latter by his wife Impedimenta. Notes The Source Eug√©nie in Royat, left in the background the thermal building from the 19. century. *A running gag in this book features Vitalstatistix and Winesanspirix falsely claiming \\"I don't know where Alesia is! No one knows where Alesia is!\\", as if ashamed at Vercingetorix's defeat. Historically, Alesia's likely location was rediscovered only after this book was published. *The ubiquitous wine-and-coal shops in Gergovie allude to the Bougnats, Arvernian immigrants to Paris operating shops selling wine, wood, and coal. *This book establishes the origin of Vitalstatistix's shield, on which he is customarily carried, as that of Vercingetorix. *This is one among a minority of Asterix books wherein the bard Cacofonix is not tied up and gagged at ‚Äì and actively participating in ‚Äì the feast. *This is the first album wherein Vitalstatistix's wife Impedimenta is named. *The wheel factory is a reference to Michelin, based in Clermont-Ferrand, or the Gaullish Nemessos. In real life, the main square in Clermont-Ferrand has a statue of Vercingetorix, as opposed to the statue of Caesar in the book. *In the wheel factory, Obelix shows a desire for business success: a theme later central to Obelix and Co. *Though Vitalstatistix' hydrotherapy according to the comic book takes place in Aquae Calidae (modern Vichy), the first picture on page 10 alludes to the Source Eug√©nie and the thermal building in Royat where the Romans used the thermal springs for hydrotherapy as well. *In the Asterix books, a map of Gaul bears the caption that 'by 50 B.C. all Gaul was occupied by the Romans'; but the historical battle of Alesia took place about the year 52 B.C. It is treated as having occurred at least 15 years before this story; thus placing Asterix in the mid-30s B.C. (though the historical Julius Caesar, a recurring character in these books, had been murdered long before). *This book serves as a loose basis for the Sega Mega Drive video game Asterix and the Power of the Gods.

The main character is Haru Satonaka (spelled Halu in the show), the captain of the team. Other team members are Yamato Hotta (the goalie), Makoto Shimaura (the rookie) and Tomonori Ikegami. In the first episode, we learn that Haru idolizes their coach, Anzai, who was a former hockey player. When he dies from an illness by the end of the first episode, Haru puts it upon himself to take care of his coach's widow, Yoko, and their young son, Wataru. The introduction of the team's new coach (Yuichiro Hyodo) does not go well, as Haru refuses to conform to the new methods, especially after Hyodo insults Ansai's way of coaching. This sets up a very antagonistic relationship between the two men. Aside from the hockey, another aspect of the show is the members' love life. Haru treats his relationships as games, refusing to fall in love. This is probably a result of his promise to Anzai to remain an \\"iceman\\", believing that a relationship, especially if children were born, would have a negative effect on his game. He believes he's found the perfect solution by starting a relationship with Aki Murase, an office lady from his team's corporation. Their \\"contracted\\" relationship is a game, as she is waiting for the return of her architect boyfriend in New York. However, she hasn't heard from him in 2 years, and she knows the relationship is over. Still, she goes every Sunday to a bridge to wait for him. Yamato is in a conflicted relationship with Yuri Aizawa, a friend and fellow office lady of Aki. She is a self-confessed gold- digger, vowing never to live the same difficult life as her poor single mother. She believes that Yamato is from a rich family, as he was driving Tomo's car the night they met. He tries to tell her the truth, but she thinks he's only joking. He doesn't want to be in a relationship built on a lie. Tomo is the playboy on the team. After finding out that he was the product of an affair, he rebelled, constantly throwing away the money his rich father gives him on friends and women. Usually staying with one night stands, he finds a possible partner in Chika Ishikawa, yet another of Aki's friends and co- workers.  Theme songs  *\\"I Was Born to Love You\\" by Queen as opening theme. Almost all of the songs in this drama were by Queen. \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"We Will Rock You\\", \\"We Are the Champions\\", \\"Radio Ga Ga\\", \\"Too Much Love Will Kill You\\", \\"Let Me Live\\" etc. were used in this drama.

The earliest records of the language are in the work of the Abb√© de l'√âp√©e, who stumbled across two sisters communicating in signs and, through them, became aware of a signing community of 200 deaf Parisians. Records of the language they used are scant. √âp√©e saw their signing as beautiful but primitive, and rather than studying or recording it, he set about developing his own unique sign system (\\"langage de signes m√©thodiques\\"), which borrowed signs from Old French Sign Language and combined them with an idiosyncratic morphemic structure which he derived from the French language. The term \\"Old French Sign Language\\" has occasionally been used to describe √âp√©e's \\"systematised signs\\", and he has often been (erroneously) cited as the inventor of sign language. √âp√©e, however, influenced the language of the deaf community, and modern French Sign Language can be said to have emerged in the schools that √âp√©e established. As deaf schools inspired by √âp√©e's model sprung up around the world, the language was to influence the development of many other sign languages, including American Sign Language. From the dictionaries of \\"systematised signs\\" that the Abb√© de l'√âp√©e and his successor, Abb√© Roch-Ambroise Cucurron Sicard, published, we can see that many of the signs described have direct descendants in sign languages today. Pierre Desloges who was deaf himself and a contemporary of the Abbe de l'√âp√©e partially described Old French Sign Language in what was possibly the first book ever to be published by a deaf person (1779). The language certainly used of the possibilities of a spatial grammar. One of the grammatical features noted by Desloges was the use of directional verbs, such as the verb \\"to want\\". From the few descriptions that exist, modern linguists are unable to build up a complete picture of Old French Sign Language, but ongoing research continues to uncover more pieces of the puzzle. It is not known how the language was acquired or how long the language had been developing before √âp√©e established his school. However, evidence suggests that whenever a large enough population of deaf people exists, a sign language will spontaneously arise (cf. Nicaraguan Sign Language). As Paris had been the largest city in France for hundreds of years (and with 565,000 inhabitants in 1750), French Sign Language is a good candidate for one of the oldest sign languages in Europe. Old French Sign Language is not related to Old French, which was spoken from roughly 1000 to 1300.

The serial is set in and near London in the 17th century. In the serial, a group of fugitive aliens called Terileptils plot to make the Earth their new home by spreading a deadly plague among humanity. Plot At the manor home of a 17th-century family, some unwelcome visitors arrive. In the console room, the Fifth Doctor is talking with Adric about the events of their previous adventure on Deva Loka (Kinda). Meanwhile, Nyssa is helping Tegan pack, as they plan to land back at Heathrow shortly after she left to join the Doctor (in Logopolis). Tegan and Nyssa enter the console room to find that they have landed at Heathrow... just 300-some years early. Tegan is distressed and storms out of the TARDIS. The four gather outside and immediately smell sulphur and head off to find the source. They are then attacked by villagers, but escape. In the confusion, Adric drops his homing device to find the TARDIS and the group is separated. Richard Mace, a highwayman and proclaimed thespian, encounters the group and takes them to safety inside a barn. While questioning Mace, they find out that some kind of comet recently landed nearby. The Doctor knows it was no \\"comet\\" and takes immediate interest in the necklace Mace is wearing. It is actually a bracelet used for prisoner control. The group begins searching the barn and comes across several power packs, and since they are far more fragile than the necklace, it means there were survivors. And so they set off to the nearby manor of the person who owns the barn. No one answers the front door, so the Doctor and Nyssa find a way in through a window. While searching the manor, they find more power packs, gunpowder and a mark from a high-energy weapon. The Doctor also notices that there is a wall where there shouldn't be one. And while he continues his investigation, Nyssa heads to the front door and lets the others in. But when they return to the wall, the Doctor is nowhere to be found. And as the four stand there trying to figure out where he's gone, a figure shuts and locks the door behind them. The Doctor then appears through the wall and explains it is a holographic energy barrier. The group walks through and joins the Doctor. Once in the cellar, they notice the place smells of soliton gas. Also in the cellar are caged rats and the device emitting the gas. While the five are searching the room, the figure from before, an android, sneaks up on them. It succeeds in \\"stunning\\" Tegan and Adric, while the Doctor, Nyssa and Mace are forced to retreat. The survivor is a Terileptil fugitive and interrogates Tegan and Adric about the Doctor. Meanwhile, the Doctor and the others find the Terileptil's ship near the manor while they plan on how to deal with the android: A sonic booster set up in the TARDIS might just deal with it. As they leave the ship, a group of villagers, all with the same device Mace found, approach them. They demand that the Doctor come with them, and when he refuses they attack. The three run back into the ship, now under siege by the villagers. The Doctor blasts open the rear hatch of the ship and the group escapes into the forest to find the TARDIS. The controlled villagers followed them at a distance. Back in the manor, Tegan and Adric have been placed in a locked room. While Nyssa heads back to the TARDIS to work on the sonic booster, the Doctor and Mace decide to question the local miller‚Äîwho appears to be able to come and go from the manor with ease. Tegan and Adric eventually escape and head up into the manor proper. Adric succeeds in jumping out a window before Tegan is recaptured by the android. Unable to solicit any response from the controlled miller, the Doctor and Mace decide to join Nyssa in the TARDIS. However, just as they are leaving the mill, they are confronted by real villagers and are about to be killed for being \\"plague carriers\\". The Terileptil still needs the Doctor and sends the controlled Headman of the village in to stop them. The villagers then throw the Doctor and Mace into a room in the mill. At the manor, the Terileptil has placed a bracelet on Tegan. And back at the TARDIS, Adric arrives and assists Nyssa in setting up the sonic booster. The Doctor succeeds in disabling two of the bracelets and the Terileptil dispatches the android to retrieve them. Minutes later, the android, in the guise of the Grim Reaper, bursts into the mill, frightens off the villagers, and takes the Doctor and Mace back to the manor where they find Tegan under the control of the bracelet. The Doctor encounters the Terileptil, but his offer to take him off Earth is rejected. The Terileptil instead plans to kill everyone on Earth and take the planet over. Mace is also equipped with a bracelet and the Doctor is thrown in a room where the Terileptil destroys his sonic screwdriver. The Terileptil brings in a cage with a rat and explains his plan: he is going to use genetically enhanced plague carried on the rats to devastate the population. The Terileptil leaves and the controlled Tegan prepares to open the cage. The Doctor overcomes Mace and Tegan using spare power packs. The Terileptil leaves for his base in the nearby city and sends the android to take control of the TARDIS. The Doctor, Tegan and Mace escape and search the Terileptil's lab to find it completely empty. Mace tells the Doctor that the nearby city the Terileptil was referring to was London. The android arrives at the TARDIS and is successfully dealt with by the sonic booster Nyssa finished. Adric and Nyssa then move the TARDIS to meet the Doctor and the others at the manor. Using the TARDIS scanner, the Doctor locates the Terileptil in London. The TARDIS rematerialises there and the five enter the building. With the Terileptil leader are two others who get the jump on the Doctor and Mace. They manage to stop them, but the Terileptil leader's weapon starts to overload and detonates. The resulting explosion destroys the building and starts a raging fire. Mace stays behind to fight the blaze as the Doctor, Tegan, Nyssa and Adric leave in the TARDIS. It is revealed that the fire is at Pudding Lane, the location where the Great Fire of London started. Broadcast and reception The story was repeated on BBC1 across four consecutive evenings from 15‚Äì18 August 1983, achieving viewing figures of 4.3, 4.6, 3.6 and 4.8 million viewers, respectively. At the time of original broadcast, the series as a whole was getting watched in 39 countries worldwide, with around 88 million viewers abroad and an average of 10 million in the domestic market. Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping gave a favourable review of the serial in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), writing, \\"A good, hearty action romp, crisply written and engaging, although critics might say that it's too straight-forward. There's only one proper character (Richard Mace), which gives Peter Davison and Michael Robbins the space to turn in a pair of lovely performances. The end result is a stylish slice of pseudo- historical nonsense.\\" In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker called The Visitation \\"a very enjoyable story, and one of the highlights of the season\\". They praised the location filming, but noted a weakness was \\"Matthew Waterhouse's peculiar performance as Adric\\". In 2012, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times awarded it four stars out of five. He said that the story was \\"pedestrian in places, [but] Saward does execute one or two dramatic flourishes\\". He said that Davison was growing into the role and the companions were given something to do despite being \\"variable\\", and was mixed towards the design of the Terileptils. Reviewing the special-edition DVD release for SFX, Nick Setchfield gave The Visitation three-and-a-half out of five stars. He noted that it was a \\"throwback\\" and \\"built on capture-escape- capture storytelling, but it's brimful of oaky, shadowy 17th-century atmosphere\\". Peter Davison stated that The Visitation is one of his three favourite serials from his time on the programme. Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Eric Saward, was published by Target Books in August 1982. Its cover was originally to be painted like the other Target Doctor Who novels, but an objection by Peter Davison's agent resulted in a photographic cover being used instead. This was the only Peter Davison story to have its novelisation titled as Doctor Who and the... in its original edition. An unabridged recording of the Target novelisation was released in 2012, read by Matthew Waterhouse. A behind-the- scenes book following the production process of the story was printed by Andre Deutsch Limited in 1982, with text by Alan Road and illustrations by Richard Farley. =Home media= The Visitation was released on a VHS double pack with Black Orchid in July 1994. It was released on DVD-Video in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2004, and used material from the 16 mm film prints, which still exist in the BBC Archives. A special edition of the story with additional features was released on DVD on 6 May 2013.

As a suitable building was not available, the school was initially housed in rooms in the School of Science and Art in Lansdown, Stroud. Miss D.M.

In partial hospitalization, the patient continues to reside at home, but commutes to a treatment center up to seven days a week. Partial hospitalization focuses on the overall treatment of the individual and is intended to avert or reduce in-patient hospitalization. The pioneer of partial hospital programs, Dr. Albert E. MollThe News and Courier Center Gives Day Mental Care page 1. Charleston, SC, May 13, 1952., believed that some patients would be unable to be away from their families or from work and that these programs would reduce the cost of long-term care. Partial hospitalization programs in the United States can be provided in either a hospital setting or by a free-standing community mental health center (CMHC). Treatment during a typical day may include group therapy, psych-educational groups, skill building, individual therapy, and psychopharmacological assessments and check-ins. Programs are available for the treatment of alcoholism and substance abuse problems, Alzheimer's disease, anorexia and bulimia, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and other mental illnesses. Programs geared specifically toward geriatric patients, adult patients, adolescents, or young children also exist. Programs for adolescents and children usually include an academic program, to either take the place of or to work with the child's local school. Funding Service providers in the United States are funded by private insurance as part of a designated continuum of care as well as Medicare and, for some states, Medicaid. Currently, many providers are moving the partial hospitalization model of day treatment toward more acute short- term services . Hospitals and community mental health organizations are using PHP's to handle acutely ill persons who are able to better understand their illness, become adjusted to medication regimes, develop important coping skills, and set recovery goals that enable them to function effectively as recovered individuals in the society. Most programs are required to pass comprehensive reviews from national, state, and insurance bodies. Specific guidelines for assessment, treatment, facility maintenance, performance improvement, and client outcome studies are integral to partial hospitalization programs.

This serial marks the final regular appearance of Matthew Waterhouse as Adric and his climactic death, with the final episode featuring unique silent credits in memory of the character. It is also the first to feature the Cybermen since Revenge of the Cybermen in 1975. The serial is mainly set on Earth and a deep space freighter in 2526. In the serial, the Cybermen plot to wipe out Earth, where a conference of multiple planets are planning to form a military pact to defeat the Cybermen in a war. Plot As the TARDIS materialises in Earth's future, Adric argues with the Fifth Doctor about the lack of attention and respect he receives compared to Nyssa or Tegan. They explore a series of caves and are caught by soldiers led by Lieutenant Scott; Professor Kyle, accompanying Scott, accuses the four of killing the rest of her archaeological team. The Doctor convinces them to help, and Kyle leads them to the bodies of her team, near where they find an odd metal hatch. The group is attacked by androids, killing some of Scott's men, but the Doctor defeats them. He suspects the androids were guarding the hatch, and eventually opens it to reveal a powerful bomb that could destroy the planet. The Doctor and Adric defuse the bomb and trace its signal back to a freighter that is entering the Solar System. Scott and Kyle join the Doctor as they return to the TARDIS and travel to the freighter. The Doctor instructs the others to wait in the TARDIS while he and Adric explore the ship, and find a similar number of corpses in the cargo holds, before they are caught by the ship's security and taken to Captain Briggs, where they try to explain their situation. Throughout this, the Doctor and the humans are unaware that they are being monitored by the Cybermen, who seek to destroy the Earth. With the bomb defused on Earth, and the Doctor now interfering here, the Cyber Leader decides it is time to take command of the freighter. They leave the sealed containers they stowed away in, and began to march to the bridge. The ship's crew, along with help from Tegan, Scott, and Kyle, attempt to barricade their progress, but the Cybermen overpower them, killing Kyle and capturing Tegan, and soon the Cybermen control the bridge. Using Tegan to keep the Doctor in check, the Cybermen install a device that locks the controls of the freighter after setting it on warp-speed collision course with Earth, expecting the anti-matter engines will be powerful enough to destroy the Earth. The Cybermen then order the Doctor to take them to his TARDIS to escape, leaving behind Adric, Briggs, and other crewmen. Adric is able to pass the Doctor his gold Badge for Mathematical Excellence before they depart, knowing the Cybermen are allergic to gold. Scott and his men are able to overpower the minimal guard left on the bridge, and Adric immediately starts working to try to undo the control lock. His first attempt causes the ship to jump back in time about 65 million years; the Doctor, monitoring this on the TARDIS, observes that is about the same time of the extinction of the dinosaurs. Adric's second attempt brings the ship out of warp; though still on course to strike Earth, the impact would not be as devastating. Briggs, Scott, and the remaining crew use the opportunity to leave in escape pods. They try to convince Adric to come, but at the last moment, he returns, having another insight on defeating the lock. Scott relays their status to the TARDIS, and the Cyber Leader orders the Cybermen to kill the TARDIS crew, but the Doctor smashes Adric's badge on the Cyber Leader's chestplate, momentarily stunning it and allowing them to disable the Cybermen. The Doctor finds the TARDIS' controls have been damaged, making it impossible to rescue Adric. On the bridge, Adric nears undoing the lock when a weakened Cyberman fires on him, missing him and striking the keyboard, preventing Adric from making any further attempts. The TARDIS crew watches helplessly as the freighter collides with Earth in a massive explosion. Production This serial featured newly designed Cybermen, on display here at a 50th Anniversary event The working title for this story was Sentinel. Although credited as script editor, Antony Root in fact did little or no work on Earthshock. He was credited to avoid Saward, who had by this time replaced him in the job, being credited as such on his own work, which contravened BBC regulations. This was the first Cyberman story since Revenge of the Cybermen (1975), as producer John Nathan- Turner wanted to bring back an old enemy, but resisted using the Daleks. Before the title was changed to Earthshock, Nathan-Turner was adamant about keeping the return of the Cybermen a secret. He instructed Eric Saward not to have any reference to the Cybermen in the story's title. Nathan-Turner even had the studio observation galleries closed for the duration of recording and turned down an offer from Radio Times to provide advance publicity of the Cybermen on their cover. The success of this convinced Nathan-Turner to continue to mine the series' past continuity for ideas and old enemies. After the success of using archive footage for the flashback sequence in Logopolis (1981), Producer John Nathan-Turner consulted with series continuity adviser Ian Levine and asked him to prepare another such montage for this story. Levine selected one clip from all of previous Doctors, save for Jon Pertwee who never had a Cyberman story (though they had been briefly glimpsed in two serials from his era). Levine's selected clips were: the First Doctor from episode 2 of The Tenth Planet (1966), the Second Doctor from episode 6 of The Wheel in Space (1968) (with dialogue from the Earthshock Cyber Leader referring to The Tomb of the Cybermen (1967), at that time missing from the BBC archives) and the Fourth Doctor from part 3 of Revenge Of The Cybermen (1975). All the clips were presented in monochrome to preserve continuity, as the first two extracts were originally recorded in black and white. The exterior sequences seen in the first episode were shot on Thursday 29 October 1981 at Springwell Lock Quarry, near Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire. The Cyberscope prop was built using parts the modelmaker (Martin Bower) had scavenged from the Nostromo set constructed for Ridley Scott's science fiction film Alien (1979). Similarly, the digital readouts on the device flash up a random series of numbers, which were also seen on the monitors of the Nostromo set. Earthshock was Peter Grimwade's last work as a director on Doctor Who. According to an interview with Eric Saward in 1986, Nathan-Turner subsequently fell out with Grimwade and refused to use him again, which was a source of tensions between Nathan-Turner and Saward.\\"The Revelations of a Script Editor\\". Starburst. September 1986. Issue 97. Page 16. Although this was his last job on Doctor Who as director, he would write three serials for the Davison era; Time-Flight (which follows on from Earthshock), Mawdryn Undead and Planet of Fire. =Cast notes= Peter Davison has stated that Earthshock is one of his three favourite serials from his time on the programme. Broadcast and reception The story was repeated on BBC One (Not BBC Wales) as two 50min compilation episodes in 1982 on 9 August 1982 & 16 August 1982 at 7.20pm as part of \\"Doctor Who and the Monsters\\", achieving viewing figures of 4.9 and 5.2 million respectively. The story came 17th in the 1997 Doctor Who Magazine annual best serial survey. Rob Hill ranked it at number two in \\"the top 10 Cybermen stories\\" for Den of Geek in 2010, beaten only by The Tomb of the Cybermen (1967). In 2018, The Daily Telegraph ranked Earthshock at number 22 in \\"the 56 greatest stories and episodes\\", arguing that \\"Peter Davison's first season was unremarkable until Earthshock descended with a mighty thud\\". It continued, \\"Peter Grimwade's pacy direction keeps the action and tension levels high, and the Cybermen once again come across as a credible menace, backed by some appropriate marching music courtesy of Malcolm Clarke\\". The article concluded that it was \\"one of the most memorable stories of Eighties Doctor Who\\". Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote of the serial in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), \\"Exciting and engaging early on, but a writer is not supposed to get so caught up in the excitement that things happen for no better reason than plot expediency. What we have is great... for a first draft.\\" In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker wrote \\"the story as a whole stands up very well and is highly entertaining\\". They felt that \\"deficiencies\\" in the plotting were not that noticeable. Howe and Walker called the first episode \\"a masterpiece of suspense and terror\\", praised the surprise return of the Cybermen, which they said were \\"more effective\\" than those in Revenge of the Cybermen (1975), and thought the way Adric was written out showed \\"the level of brilliance to which Doctor Who could still ascend if the production team put their minds to it\\". In Doctor Who: The Episode Guide, Mark Campbell awarded it eight out of ten, describing it as \\"a dynamically directed action story, much praised at the time; although the plot has huge holes and the dialogue is often lousy.\\" In 2011, The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn was positive towards how the serial characterised Adric, which set him up for his demise. Bahn praised the first episode for being \\"nicely tense and mysterious\\", but noted that it was separate from the rest of the story, which led to too many characters in the last three episodes. He also criticised the Cybermen, feeling that they did not hark back to their eerie emotionless roots and that when they got involved \\"the plot starts to bog down in its implausibilities\\". In 2012, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times awarded it five stars out of five, praising the tension and describing it as \\"the most thrilling tale in years\\". He wrote \\"Saward's script and Grimwade's direction work in unison, delivering pace, momentum, atmosphere and the eponymous shock.\\" He praised the new look of the Cybermen, guest star Beryl Reid, and the way the story \\"pulls off the previously unimaginable feat of making us care about Adric\\". He acknowledged that critics had pointed out \\"plot holes and logic leaps\\", but said he was willing to \\"gloss over them\\". In 2010, SFX named Adric's death the twenty-ninth best \\"tearjerker\\" in science fiction and fantasy, calling it a \\"tragedy\\" that managed to make the audience care about him. In 2012, the magazine also listed the scene as the third best companion departure, calling it \\"a beautifully constructed death scene\\" despite the fact that the character was \\"loathed by fandom\\". For Den of Geek in 2019, Andrew Blair wrote that Earthshock was \\"atypical Who with its short scenes, regular gunfights, and fast pace. Its success owed a lot to Peter Grimwade's direction, but also negatively influenced Doctor Who for the next four years with misplaced attempts to bottle lightning twice.\\" Commercial releases =In print= The Target novelisation of this serial, written by Ian Marter, was published by WH Allen in 1983. A second edition was published in 1992.

Snuba diving is a popular guided touring activity in tropical tourist locations such as Hawaii, Thailand, the Caribbean and M√©xico. Snuba is also popular because no certification or prior dive experience is required. Participants need only to be at least eight years of age, have a basic swimming ability, and be comfortable in the water. Its popularity as a first timer's experience can be attributed to several factors. *The participant tows the raft on the surface via a lightweight harness connected to the air line. This gives the customer the secure knowledge that he/she cannot descend too deep and allows them to choose the depth that they feel most comfortable with while being able to control their depth, descent and ascent rates. By utilizing the hose as a guide, combined with wearing soft weights to achieve neutral buoyancy, participants are able to descend anywhere from just under the surface to deep. *Participants are able to hold on to the raft at the surface using a lanyard that runs the length of the raft on both sides. This also allows the user to hold on to the raft while becoming comfortable breathing before beginning to descend. Being connected to the raft also provides users with a feeling of safety, comfort, and the option to hold on to the raft should they want to return to the surface. *Compared to scuba, snuba divers wear minimal gear. Each diver is equipped with a mask, fins, weight belt, harness and regulator. The harness holds the regulator and air line in place, allowing the diver to swim unencumbered beneath the surface. This may be compared to full scuba gear, which includes a buoyancy compensator, weights, cylinder and often more, and can weigh in excess of . Although scuba equipment is nearly weightless underwater, out of the water the weight becomes a significant factor for weaker individuals. Unlike scuba divers, the snuba diver is not provided with an emergency buoyancy system, meaning that in case of emergency the snuba diver must reach the surface himself or await the arrival of assistance. On the other hand, a correctly weighted snuba diver will be neutrally buoyant at all depths (no compressible dive suit), has a hose and harness to prevent sinking, can pull on the hose to surface, which is less effort than swimming, and has a raft with a grab-rope to hold on to at the surface. Disadvantages In strong current, wave action, or breeze, the combination of underwater hose and surface raft can pull quite hard on a diver. Snuba is therefore best used in areas where wind, waves and current are negligible. Since all snuba use is offered by licensed snuba operators who operate the systems as a guided tour, the possibility of being subjected to strong current, high waves or high wind is not likely. However it is beneficial if one employee of the snuba operator remains on the surface to monitor conditions. Since the depth of a snuba dive is limited to about , decompression sickness is not likely to be a problem. However, as the snuba diver is breathing compressed air, there is still a risk of injury or death due to barotrauma, which is a more severe hazard at shallow depths if divers ascend as little as a few feet without venting the expanding air in their lungs. This danger is easily avoided by breathing normally and continuously while ascending. This point is thoroughly covered in snuba pre- dive briefings, and monitored by the dive guide throughout the dive by watching for the continual release of bubbles from each diver. According to the snuba web site, since operation started in 1989, more than 5 million dives have been conducted without injury or fatality, but there appears to have been at least one fatality to a snuba diver, in April 2014. The cause of death is not reported, so it is unknown if the death was related specifically to the use of snuba, or to other causes. It is not known if any other dives with injury or fatality have occurred. The snuba liability release form releases the operators and developers of the snuba system from any liability or responsibility for damage, injury or death due to neglect, system failure or any other reason. Yet, there are many non-official reports about inadequate training. References External links * www.snuba.com ‚Äî Snuba International, Inc.

The pass sign. The pass is located in the Rocky Mountains southwest of Denver, Colorado, just northeast of the town of Fairplay, Colorado. Geologically, the pass is located atop a large granite batholith (known as the Kenosha Batholith) that forms the spine of the Front Range along the eastern side of South Park. It is traversed by US 285 between Jefferson and Grant, and provides a route between the valley of the North Fork South Platte River and the headwaters of the South Platte River in South Park. In addition to providing one of the principal access routes to South Park, the pass offers dramatic views of the surrounding Rockies, including the nearby peaks of Mount Evans and Mount Bierstadt. Description The pass is easily traversable by most vehicles, never reaching above the treeline and featuring easily negotiable curves along an amply wide highway. The approach on the eastern side is fairly gentle, ascending from near Grant up a gulch at the headwaters of the North Fork. The western side of the pass has a steeper ascent, winding up the flank of a mountainside east of the town of Jefferson. An overlook on the west side of the pass offers a panoramic view of South Park. The top of the pass is nearly flat and surrounded by the Pike National Forest, with a United States Forest Service campground on the summit. The pass was used by Ute bands to reach the hunting grounds of South Park. In the 19th century the pass was used by white trappers to traverse the Front Range. During the Pike's Peak Gold Rush of the 1860s the pass was heavily used by prospectors eager to reach the placer gold fields at the headwaters of the South Platte near Fairplay and other South Park mining communities. The increase in traffic led to the widening of the trail into a wagon road; during the Colorado Silver Boom the pass became one of the main routes of entry for eager immigrants to Leadville, Breckenridge, and Aspen. The Colorado Trail crosses the summit of Kenosha Pass. The trail portion near the campground and heading northwest is popular with mountain bike enthusiasts and hikers.http://www.coloradotrail.org/segments.html#5 Colorado Trail Information In 1879 the pass was traversed by the narrow gauge Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad, providing the first rail link between Denver and the South Park mining communities such as Fairplay (the tracks were removed in 1938, but the modern highway follows the old road and the railroad route over the pass - most of which is still visible). During this same year of 1879, the poet Walt Whitman crossed the pass and described its summit with these words, later published in Specimen Days: :I jot these lines literally at Kenosha summit, where we return, afternoon, and take a long rest, 10,000 feet above sea-level. At this immense height the South Park stretches fifty miles before me. Mountainous chains and peaks in every variety of perspective, every hue of vista, fringe the view...so the whole Western world is, in a sense, but an expansion of these mountains. Popular culture In the South Park episode \\"The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers\\" a sign for Kenosha Pass can be seen as the boys walk from South Park to Conifer to the video store. In the episode \\"Prehistoric Ice Man,\\" a man who has been frozen since 1996 goes back to his wife, whom says he was lost on Kenosha Pass. A line from Thomas Pynchon's novel Gravity's Rainbow: you never danced the kenosha kid is repeated throughout, with varying punctuation and capitalization, changing the meaning of the sentence each time.

The serial was intended to be transmitted as four 23-minute episodes but a late scheduling change by the BBC meant that it was transmitted as two episodes of 46 minutes; reruns (and the 2002 DVD release) restored it to its intended format. Written by the series' script editor, Eric Saward, the serial marks the Fifth Doctor's only encounter with the Daleks, last seen in Destiny of the Daleks (1979), the debut of Terry Molloy as the third actor to play the Daleks' creator, Davros, and the final regular appearance of Janet Fielding as companion Tegan Jovanka. Plot A group of futuristic humanoids in 1984 London are shot by two policemen led by Commander Lytton. Two of the humanoids, Galloway and Quartermaster Sergeant Stien, escape into the adjacent Butler's Wharf where a time corridor is situated, but Galloway is killed. Lytton transports back to his battle cruiser in the far future and prepares to attack a prison space station whose only prisoner is the creator of the Daleks, Davros, who has been held there since the events of Destiny of the Daleks. Meanwhile, the Fifth Doctor, Tegan and Turlough are being dragged down a time corridor in the TARDIS following on from the events at the end of Frontios. They emerge in the London Docklands. The Daleks' assault on the prison station is fought off by the station crew, led by Dr. Styles and Lt. Mercer. Lytton persuades the Dalek Supreme to use poisonous gas, and the Daleks take over the ship. Watch Officer Osborn attempts to destroy Davros, but Lytton and an engineer break into the cell and kill Osborn before she can complete her mission, then release Davros from his cryogenic imprisonment. The Doctor and his friends meet the traumatised Stien, and all return to the warehouse to hunt for the end of the time corridor. There they meet a military bomb disposal squad, called in by builders. While the others are distracted, Turlough stumbles into the time corridor, ending up on the Dalek ship. Having learned that the Doctor is in the warehouse, the Supreme Dalek orders a Dalek to detain him. The Dalek travels through the time corridor and kills several of the squad's men before the Doctor advises them to focus their fire on its eyestalk, blinding it. In the resulting struggle, the humans push the Dalek out of the warehouse window, and it explodes on hitting the ground. Tegan suffers a head injury and blacks out. Only Styles, Mercer, and two guards are left alive of the original crew. Disguised in uniforms taken from Lytton's guards, they plan to blow up the station via its self-destruct system. Davros tells Lytton that he has been in cryogenic storage for 90 years, and vows to take his revenge on the Doctor. While Davros's travel chair is undergoing maintenance by the engineer Kiston, Lytton explains that the Daleks lost their war against the Movellans because of the development of a virus that specifically attacks Dalek tissue, and they have awakened Davros to find a cure. Davros demands that he remain on the prison ship while working on the virus, in case he needs to be refrozen. When Lytton leaves to discuss this with the Supreme Dalek, Davros uses a hypodermic-like mind control device to take control of Kiston. The Doctor and the members of the bomb disposal squad search for the Kaled mutant that was housed inside the destroyed Dalek. They kill it only after it wounds one of the squad's men. The Doctor and Stien head into the TARDIS to find out what is happening at the other end of the time corridor. The TARDIS materialises inside the Dalek ship and the Doctor tells Stien that they should find Turlough and make a swift exit. But Stien reveals that he is an agent of the Daleks. A patrol of Daleks close in to exterminate the Doctor, but Lytton enters and informs them that the Supreme Dalek has ordered that the Doctor be taken alive. The Daleks lead the Doctor away. Turlough joins the remnants of the ship's crew, telling them that the time corridor might help them escape the effects of the ship's self-destruct. On Earth, the man attacked by the Dalek creature appears disorientated. The group commander, Colonel Archer, decides to radio for help; he, seeks help from two policemen (Lytton's associates). As he tries their radio, a policeman holds a gun to his head. The Daleks reveal their plan of cloning the Doctor and his companions and using the clones to assassinate the High Council of Time Lords on Gallifrey. Stien begins the mind-copying sequence while the Doctor tries to talk him into resisting his Dalek mind conditioning. Styles and the two station guards are killed when trying to activate the self-destruct system. On Earth, a clone of Colonel Archer goes to the warehouse under Dalek control. The bodies of Colonel Archer and his men are later seen aboard the Dalek ship. Tegan makes an escape attempt but is recaptured by the policemen and taken to the Dalek ship. The squad's scientific advisor, Professor Laird, is shot while trying to flee the soldiers. Two Daleks take Davros, where he demands tissue to establish the cure. After consulting The Supreme Dalek, they agree but Davros uses the mind control device to take control of them. In the duplication chamber, Stien is overcome with confusion: the Doctor has realised that Stien's conditioning is unstable and tries to reawaken his ability to think for himself. Just as the mind-copying sequence nears completion, Stien breaks his conditioning and stops the process, freeing the Doctor. The Doctor finds Turlough and Tegan, and they return to the TARDIS along with Stien and the last surviving station crew member. Rather than depart, the Doctor decides to destroy Davros once and for all. With Stien and Lt. Mercer he heads to the station lab, leaving Tegan and Turlough in the TARDIS, which he has surreptitiously programmed on time delay to return them to the warehouse. The Doctor confronts Davros in the lab, but his chance to kill him is lost when Stien's conditioning re-asserts itself long enough to let Lytton's troops kill Lt. Mercer. Stien refuses to accompany the Doctor back to the time corridor and runs off into the station. Davros' army (consisting of Kiston, a soldier and two Daleks) is growing and he dispatches his Daleks to Earth. Anticipating resistance from the Daleks not loyal to him, Davros breaks open a capsule of the Movellan virus. Two Daleks enter with the intention of exterminating him but are themselves killed by the virus. At the warehouse, a battle takes place between Davros' Daleks and those loyal to the Supreme Dalek. The Doctor returns through the time corridor, realising that the \\"unexploded bombs\\" discovered earlier on are canisters containing the Movellan virus. He opens a canister that Tegan and Turlough have brought into the TARDIS, and places it behind the Daleks who start to die. Lytton has escaped and sees the Daleks' demise. He swaps his Dalek uniform for that of a policeman and joins his two fellow \\"bobbies\\" on their next vigil. Back on the space station, Davros prepares to flee in an escape pod, but the Movellan virus attacks and seemingly kills him. The Supreme Dalek appears on the TARDIS scanner and threatens the Doctor, claiming that the Daleks have duplicates of prominent humans all over Earth. Meanwhile, Stien is trying to activate the self- destruct sequence. Just as he is about to finish, the Daleks enter and exterminate him, but he manages to complete the sequence and destroys both the station and the Dalek ship. The Doctor calls for them all to leave, but Tegan refuses, saying she no longer enjoys her adventures, and runs off. The Doctor is saddened by this, and he and Turlough leave. As the TARDIS vanishes, Tegan runs back, remembering the Doctor's old admonishment: \\"Brave heart, Tegan.\\" She calls out to the empty air that she will miss him. Production The working titles of this story were The Return, Warhead, and The Resurrection. The story was originally due to be produced as the climax of season 20. However, due to a strike by the electricians, the story was postponed and, with minor rewrites, resurrected for season 21. The story was originally supposed to have been directed by Peter Grimwade, whose work on Saward's previous story Earthshock had pleased the writer. When the story was postponed, Grimwade took members of the production team out to dinner, but did not invite John Nathan-Turner, because he had intended to take Nathan-Turner out separately. Nathan-Turner felt slighted by the omission and refused to allow Grimwade to direct the story when it was rescheduled for season 21.\\"The Revelations of a Script Editor\\". Starburst. September 1986. Issue 97. Page 16. Matthew Robinson, who had never worked on the series before but had a \\"reputation as an action director\\", was used instead. However, Saward had already promised Grimwade that he could provide a script for the season, so Grimwade was allowed to write the following story, Planet of Fire. As well as the change of director, the serial's postponement also meant that Michael Wisher, who had originated the role of Davros in Genesis of the Daleks (1975), became unavailable. Matthew Robinson cast Terry Molloy instead and showed him the tape of Wisher's performance. The filming location for the serial was Shad Thames and Butler's Wharf in September 1983, with studio scenes videotaped at TC8 of BBC Television Centre between September and October. =Story format= This story was intended to be four parts of the usual 23-minute length. However, due to the BBC's coverage of the 1984 Winter Olympics held in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, the series' regular slot was not available. Rather than interrupt transmission, the decision was taken to transmit the story as two double-length episodes (46 minutes per episode), on consecutive Wednesdays rather than season 21's normal Thursday/Friday timeslot. It is often asserted that it was directly because of the success of the two-part experiment that the following season was produced in the same format: however, this decision had already been taken. The first copy of the story to be sold to American PBS stations by the BBC was done in the original four-part serial format. However, part two had a raw soundtrack, lacking sound effects and music. The compilation version, in which the entire story is compressed into one feature- length episode, had the entire second half with the raw soundtrack, but the second quarter with music and effects intact. The portions with the raw soundtrack also included some extra scenes not used in the final four-part cut. =Cast notes= This is wrongly stated by Matthew Robinson on the DVD commentary as the television debut of Leslie Grantham. He had actually made his debut as a character called Boollie in a BBC2 Playhouse production called \\"Jake's End\\". Grantham was offered the role of either Galloway or Kiston, and chose the latter because it would afford him more screen time and was a more challenging role.Resurrection of the Daleks DVD commentary (2002) He went on to play the notorious \\"Dirty\\" Den Watts in the long-running soap opera EastEnders, again being cast on the recommendation of Matthew Robinson; following his return to the soap opera in 2004, his character addressed another character, a wheelchair-bound Ian Beale, as 'Davros', and encountered a police officer named 'Kiston', meta-references to his appearance in Doctor Who.EastEnders, 9 July 2004. Broadcast and reception In Doctor Who: The Complete Guide, Mark Campbell awarded Resurrection of the Daleks two out of ten, describing it as \\"an ultra-violent, soulless remake of Earthshock. Beneath the technobabble, endless continuity references, silly hats and abysmally acted death scenes, there's no sign of a plot.\\" In 2019, Paul Mount of Starburst described it as \\"a collision of clunky ideas artlessly welded together, dodgy dialogue, ropey characterisation and a plot that meandered and wandered [...] Resurrection, with its stratospherically high body count and unremittingly grim tone, was far darker and messier than the show ever needed to be.\\" For Radio Times, Mark Braxton awarded the serial three stars out of five. He stated, \\"There‚Äôs serious intent here: a grim, Euston-Films landscape of deserted docklands; sturdy, open sets; disturbing music; and a high, TV- watchdog-needling body count.\\" He praised the performances of Rodney Bewes and in particular the \\"top of the form\\" Maurice Colbourne, and \\"complexity in the story\\", which has \\"gnarly grey areas of the kind that we're more familiar with in the Moffat era\\", but added \\"the story doesn't really enlarge the Dalek mythos.\\" He concluded that \\"parts of the plot seem tacked on and ill- considered: the whole duplicates business makes little sense. And there is so much in the way of homage that Resurrection of the Daleks is less than the sum of its parts. Is it enjoyable? Yes. Does it feel like a proper story? Sadly not.\\" Commercial releases =In print= This is one of five Doctor Who serials that were never originally novelised by Target Books (the others being The Pirate Planet, City of Death, Shada, and Revelation of the Daleks), as they were unable to come to an agreement with Eric Saward and Dalek creator Terry Nation that would have allowed Saward or another writer to adapt the script; although Virgin Books (the successor to Target) did announce plans to publish a novelisation by Saward in the early 1990s, this ultimately did not occur. A fan group in New Zealand did publish an unofficial novelisation of the story in 2000, later republishing it as an online eBook titled Doctor Who: Resurrection of the Daleks. The novelisation by Eric Saward was released on hardcover 18 July 2019. and an audiobook edition followed on 4 July 2019. A Target Books edition will be published in paperback 11 March 2021. =Home media= Resurrection of the Daleks was released on VHS in November 1993. Both the VHS (now out of print) and DVD releases of this story reverted to the four-episode format. The previously unused episode breaks are when the first Dalek comes through the time corridor in the warehouse, and in the second half of the story, when Davros begins preparing the Movellan virus, promising to exact vengeance on the Doctor and set himself up as the leader of a new Dalek race. This story was first released on DVD in the United Kingdom on 18 November 2002. Special features include commentary on all episodes by Peter Davison, Janet Fielding and Matthew Robinson, deleted scenes, trailer and a 5.1 digital surround sound mix. A short feature \\"Resurrection of the Daleks - On Location\\" was also included, directed by Paul Vanezis, which was recorded at Shad Thames in March 2002. It included interviews with Robinson and Saward, and the final on-screen interview conducted with John Nathan-Turner before his death in May of that year. It was re-released in 2003 as part of a limited run box set with The Dalek Invasion of Earth and Remembrance of the Daleks and in 2007 as part of a box set that contains Genesis of the Daleks, Destiny of the Daleks, Revelation of the Daleks and Remembrance of the Daleks. This story was released as the accompanying DVD with Issue 34 of the Doctor Who DVD Files on 21 April 2010. Released by GE FABBRI. The story was re-released on DVD in 2011 as part of the Revisitations 2 box set (along with The Seeds of Death and Carnival of Monsters) in an expanded 2-disc set with the original as-broadcast 2x46 minutes version included on the second disc. New special features included a commentary on the episodes by Saward, Terry Molloy and visual effects designer Peter Wragg (moderated by Nicholas Pegg), a documentary called Casting Far and Wide in which Toby Hadoke interviewed other members of the cast, and a documentary about the era of the Fifth Doctor called Come in Number Five which was presented by David Tennant.

It was the winner of the 1976 Books in Canada First Novel Award. The novel is a fictionalised version of the life of the New Orleans jazz pioneer Buddy Bolden. It covers the last months of Bolden's sanity in 1907, as his music becomes more radical and his behaviour more erratic. A secondary character in the story is the photographer E. J. Bellocq. Both these historical figures are portrayed in ways that draw on their actual lives, but which depart from the facts in order to explore the novel's central theme - the relationship between creativity and self-destruction. The novel draws on the style of jazz, being structured in a fragmented, and \\"syncopated\\" form, with episodes extending in elongated \\"riffs\\" before suddenly lurching unpredictably into an apparently unrelated scene. The structure also conveys Bolden's own wild, fragmenting personality, as his schizophrenia takes hold. Bolden's manic, extroverted but self-harming behaviour is set against the introverted figure of Bellocq, who expresses his own frustrated desires in his intimate erotic photographs, but then compulsively violates them with scratches.

J. Armstrong in command. The ship was named for Robert T. Spence, superintendent of the construction of USS Ontario (1813), and captain of USS Cyane (1815). Spence conducted her shakedown cruise out of Guantanamo Bay from 8 to 28 February. She then served as an escort in the Atlantic and Caribbean and had convoy duty in the Casablanca area in April. She was routed to the west coast and, on 25 July, got underway from San Francisco for Pearl Harbor, to serve in the Pacific against the Japanese in World War II. History Spence sailed on 25 August as a unit of Task Group (TG) 1.2 consisting of the light carriers and to support troops who took possession of Baker Island on 1 September. On the 13 September, she proceeded to Efate and arrived at Havannah Harbor on 18 September. Spence was attached to Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 46 of Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 23. The squadron sailed on 22 September for Tulagi, Solomon Islands. On the 28th, she set a surface craft on fire with her main batteries near Kolombangara and then patrolled between that island and Vella Lavella. On the night of 1 and 2 October, Spence was with a force off Vella Lavella to interdict Japanese shipping and helped to destroy 20 Japanese barges. The DD then made two escort runs from Tulagi to Purvis Bay during the first part of the month and ended October supporting landings on the Treasury Islands. Capt. Arleigh A. Burke assumed command of DesRon 23 on 23 October, and the squadron became known as the \\"Little Beavers.\\" On 1 November, Spence participated in the bombardment of Buka and Bonis airfields and of Japanese positions in the Shortland Islands to support the Landings at Cape Torokina, Bougainville. =Battle of Empress Augusta Bay= In the early hours of 2 November, Task Force 39 intercepted an enemy force of two heavy and two light cruisers with six destroyers steaming towards Empress Augusta Bay. At 02:31, Spence made radar contact at . While closing the target, she received a hit below the water line but continued in action. The destroyer fired a spread of torpedoes at a ship away and was rewarded with black smoke pouring from the target. As Spence retired to rendezvous with DesDiv 45, she spotted another Japanese force away. She opened fire, was \\"on target,\\" and watched one ship stop dead in the water and burn fiercely. Since Spence was low on ammunition, she called upon DesDiv 45 to pour shells into the ill-fated destroyer Hatsukaze which sank stern first. The Japanese light cruiser Sendai was also sunk in the engagement. When daybreak came, so did between 70 and 80 enemy aircraft. But the Japanese lost over 20 planes while scoring only two hits on . Spence retired to Purvis Bay on 3 November. The next day, she called at Tulagi and sailed with for Kula Gulf. On the afternoon of the 5th, she was operating northwest of the Treasury Islands when she was attacked by enemy aircraft. One plane dropped three bombs, but the closest fell off Spences starboard beam. =Battle of Cape St. George= For the next three weeks, Spence performed patrol and escort duty in the Port Purvis-Kula Gulf area. On 24 November, the squadron was refueling in Hathorn Sound when ordered northwest of Buka Island to intercept Japanese shipping which American intelligence had learned would attempt to evacuate aviation personnel from the Buka-Bonis airfields. Early the next morning, the \\"Little Beavers\\" were patrolling the Buka-Rabaul route. At 01:42, in St. George Channel, Spence made surface radar contacts at . The range closed rapidly, and, at 01:56, DesDiv 45 fired torpedoes at two Japanese ships and scored several hits. Several minutes later, American radar picked up a second group of three enemy ships. Spence and were ordered to finish off the first group while DesDiv 45 bombarded the second group. In the first group, Onami exploded and sank immediately while Makinami was battered into a helpless cripple. Spence and Converse opened on her with their main batteries and she sank at 02:53. In the second group, DesDiv 45 sank Yugiri. Three of five Japanese destroyers were sunk with no damage to DesRon 23. The squadron returned to Purvis Bay on 31 October. =1944= Spence operated out of Purvis Bay until late January 1944 when she patrolled near Green Island and Bougainville Strait. On 5 February, she participated in the bombardment of supply and bivouac areas at Hahela Plantation on the southeast coast of Buka Island. The next day, she sank an enemy barge with shellfire near Green Island. On the night of 9 and 10 February, Spence helped to shell Tiaraka and Teopasino, Bougainville. Spence's guns pounded Kavieng and Cape St. George, New Ireland, on the 18th, she then made a sweep of shipping lanes between Kavieng and Truk. The American warships encountered no ships so they returned to Kavieng and shelled it again on the 22nd. On that day, Spence and DesDiv 45 sank a Japanese merchantman of about 5,000 tons with shellfire. Spence operated with TF 39 from 1 to 24 March to support the landings on Emirau Island. On the 27th she sortied from Purvis Bay with TF 58 for strikes against Palau, Yap, Ulithi and Woleai, Caroline Islands. From 13 to 25 April, Spence screened the fast carriers as they struck targets on New Guinea in support of the Landing at Aitape, Tanahmerah Bay, and at Humboldt Bay, New Guinea. On the 29th and 30th, the carriers struck enemy shipping and installations at Truk, the powerful Japanese naval base in the Caroline Islands. The destroyer returned to Majuro for a period of upkeep from 4 May to 5 June. Spence sortied with TG 58.4, the fast carriers, on 6 June, to attack the Mariana Islands. As aircraft struck the islands, the destroyer moved in and bombarded Japanese positions on Guam and Saipan. The planes attacked Iwo Jima on the 16th and then returned to pound the Marianas. Spence participated in the \\"Marianas Turkey Shoot\\" during the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19 and 20 June. On 23 and 24 June, aircraft bombed targets on Guam, Saipan and Tinian. The destroyer conducted shore bombardment against Rota, Saipan and Guam from 26 June through the end of the month setting fuel tanks afire and sinking two sampans on the 27th. Spence replenished at Eniwetok in July and, on 4 August, sailed for the California coast via Pearl Harbor and arrived at San Francisco on 18 August. She was drydocked all of September and, on 5 October, sailed for Pearl Harbor and the Marshalls. She arrived at Eniwetok on 31 October and was ordered to Ulithi in early November, where she was assigned to TG 38.1, the Support Unit for the fast carriers of TF 38\\\\. She screened the carriers in Philippine waters as they launched attacks against Luzon during November and the first part of December. =Loss= On 17 December, Spence prepared to refuel and pumped out all of the salt water ballast from her tanks; but rough seas caused the fueling operation to be cancelled. The next day, the weather worsened and the storm turned into a major typhoon. As the ships wallowed in canyon-like troughs of brine, Spences electrical equipment got wet from great quantities of sea water taken on board. After a 72-degree roll to port, all of the lights went out and the pumps stopped. The rudder jammed; and, after a deep roll to port about 11:00, Spence capsized and sank. Only 24 of her complement survived. One of the 24 survivors was David Moore, an African American who floated at sea for two days and also was responsible for saving the lives of two other men. and were also sunk in the typhoon. Spence was struck from the Navy list on 19 January 1945. Honors Spence received eight battle stars for World War II service.

Traffic runs downtown (southbound) along the full stretch from Chelsea to the Upper West Side, except for the lowermost three blocks (from Gansevoort Street to 14th Street) where traffic runs northbound carrying traffic from Greenwich Street. Description Ninth Avenue originates just south of West 14th Street at Gansevoort Street in the West Village, and extends uptown for 48 blocks until its intersection with West 59th Street, where it becomes Columbus Avenue ‚Äì named after Christopher Columbus. It continues without interruption through the Upper West Side to West 110th Street, where its name changes again, to Morningside Drive, and runs north through Morningside Heights to West 122nd Street. A one-block stretch of Ninth Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets is also signed as \\"Oreo Way\\". The first Oreo cookies were manufactured in 1912 at the former Nabisco headquarters on that block. The portion of the avenue between 14th and 31st Streets was remodeled in 2008 with a bicycle lane between the eastern curb and the parking lane, followed by another portion between 77th and 96th Streets in 2011.Olea, Rebecca. \\"Columbus Ave. bike path gets two thumbs up\\" Crain's New York Business (October 12, 2011) Above the Lincoln Square neighborhood‚Äîwhere the ABC television network houses its corporate headquarters in a group of rehabilitated and modern buildings‚ÄîColumbus Avenue passes through the Central Park West Historic District, stretching from 67th/68th Streets to 89th Street. There, the avenue presents a unified streetscape of 5- to 7-story tenement buildings of brick and brownstone with discreet Romanesque and Italianate details, employing cast terracotta details and panels and courses of angle-laid brickwork. Many ornate tin cornices remain. The buildings are separated in mid-block by the narrowest of access alleys, giving glimpses of Ailanthus foliage in the side-street yards. The repeated designs of three or four commercial speculative builders, using the same features and detailing, add to the avenue's architectural unity. There are several generously scaled pre-World War I apartment buildings and the former Endicott Hotel, as well as a small commercial block from the office of McKim, Mead, and White at 72nd Street. Between 77th and 81st Streets, Columbus Avenue borders the American Museum of Natural History and Theodore Roosevelt Park. Ninth Avenue reappears in the Inwood neighborhood as a short two-way street in two segments interrupted by the New York City Subway's 207th Street Yard. It runs from West 201st Street to West 208th Street, dead-ending at Inwood North Cove Park at the Harlem River, then picks up again at West 215th Street, and terminates at Broadway between West 220th Street and the Broadway Bridge, at the location where West 221st Street would normally be. The addresses along this upper stretch from 201st Street to Broadway are continuous with the lower portion of Ninth Avenue. History The Ninth Avenue Elevated was a passenger train that ran above Ninth Avenue, beginning in the nineteenth century. The lease for the line was assumed by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) on April 1, 1903. The line ran until it was closed and dismantled in 1940, following the purchase of the IRT by the City of New York, as it was made redundant by the city's Eighth Avenue subway line. Ninth Avenue and Columbus Avenue were converted to carry one-way traffic southbound in two stages. South of its intersection with Broadway, the avenue was converted on November 6, 1948. The remaining stretch, to 110th Street, was converted on December 6, 1951. The Ninth Avenue International Food Festival street fair is held every year in May.

It is the only album by the band's original lineup, as singer/songwriter/guitarist Tomas Kalnoky, bassist Josh Ansley, and horn player James Egan all left the group later that year. Kalnoky re-recorded the entire album in 2006 with his new band Streetlight Manifesto in response to Victory's plan to re-release it. The album's title references Keasbey, New Jersey, an unincorporated area within the Woodbridge Township of Middlesex County.

Menezes - photography Streetlight Manifesto version In 2004, Kalnoky decided to re-record Keasbey Nights with his new band Streetlight Manifesto. The decision was prompted by Victory Records' plan to re-release the album with additional content. The Streetlight Manifesto version was originally scheduled to be released in late 2004, but was continually delayed until being released on March 7, 2006. The re-recorded version includes several musical and lyrical changes from the original. \\"Dear Sergio\\" includes an extra verse that Kalnoky had added when he recorded the song with the Bandits of the Acoustic Revolution on A Call to Arms (2001). Day In, Day Out features a new verse in place of playing the first verse again. The muted trumpet solo in \\"This One Goes Out To...\\" was replaced with a tenor saxophone, and different instruments were also used during the solo section of \\"Kristina She Don't Know I Exist\\". Most notably, Kalnoky replaced the shout-outs during the extended ending of \\"1234, 1234\\" with a text-to-speech transcription of an interview in which he explains his motivations for re-recording the album: > We wanted to get it right for once. Plus it helps me sleep at night knowing > blood, sweat, and tears were put into a record as opposed to making people > pay thirteen bucks for a record and they only get flashy new cover art. This > release is a preemptive strike, I guess.

Plus the budgets we get are laughable, particularly for a band with > seven musicians to record. So we used some of our own money and took our > time with this one. I'll tell you right now, we have no intent on hiding our > intentions. We wanted to prevent the re-release of Keasbey untouched as well > as get the record to sound how it should have sounded originally.

Its notable creations included the Golden Guardian (a clone of the original Guardian), Auron, Superboy (Kon-El) (a clone from Superman's DNA), and Dubbilex (a DNA-alien telepath who resembles a tall grey alien with horns). Its 31st-Century descendants run the Justice League 3000 clone project. Publication history Project Cadmus was created by Jack Kirby as the DNA Project in Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen #133 (October 1970), and was run by the former Newsboy Legion. Fictional organization history Project Cadmus was founded by Dabney Donovan, Reginald Augustine, and Thomas Thompkins. The Cadmus facilities were originally constructed in a large, abandoned aqueduct outside of Metropolis. Exploration soon uncovered a vast array of caverns close to the facilities. These would become important later. Dabney Donovan was ultimately fired from the Project because he felt there should never be limits in understanding the potential of the genetic code. Donovan had largely been accredited for the non-human creations of the Project, referred to as \\"DNAliens\\" (human beings cloned then genetically altered to discover superhuman potential while also giving them a more \\"alien\\" appearance), various normal clones, monsters based on Donovan's favorite horror films (who lived on a small artificial planet on Earth called Transilvane). One of the DNAliens named Dubbilex became a prominent staff member.\\"Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen\\" #136, (March 1971). DC Comics. There are also \\"step-ups\\" who call themselves \\"the Hairies\\", super hippies who have developed an evolved knowledge-base and developed transport and defense technology beyond the understanding of modern-day humans. The Hairies live outside the direct control of Cadmus, living inside a mobile \\"Mountain of Judgement\\" that constantly keeps them hidden from the affairs of both Cadmus and society in general. Prior to moving to the mountain, the Hairies lived in a forest of living tree-houses called the Habitat, which is right outside some of Cadmus' main facilities. The Project has an \\"opposite number\\" in the form of the Evil Factory, a monster-creating project set up by Darkseid as part of Intergang and run by two of his servants called Simyan and Mokkari. They were originally created at Project Cadmus, but due to the cruelty of the experimentation they experienced at the hands of Dr. Dabney Donovan, they develop a great deal of hatred towards all humanity. They form a scientific enclave called \\"Brigadoom\\" as a means of pleasing Darkseid by creating an army of monstrous genetic constructs. They are constantly creating entities to assist Darkseid in mastering the Anti-Life Equation, clues of which exist on Earth. This would allow Darkseid and his lackeys like Simyan and Mokkari to rule over their surroundings. Following the Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Project was reintroduced as Project Cadmus, named after the Greek legend of Cadmus, who created warriors from the teeth of a dragon. Before creating the DNA Project, Kirby had written a cloning story called \\"The Cadmus Seed\\" in Alarming Tales. The Post-Crisis version made its first appearance in Superman Annual #2 (1988). It was responsible for the creation of the new Superboy, cloned from genetic material obtained from both Superman and Lex Luthor (originally, the human DNA was identified as that of Project director Paul Westfield). Superboy is subsequently freed by the clones of the Newsboy Legion, who now, as adults, are all working for Cadmus. A clone of Guardian, another long-time hero, works at the facility. As before, another prominent staff member is Dubbilex, a \\"DNAlien\\" with telepathic powers.Superman Annual vol. 2 #2 (1988). DC Comics. Cadmus is run for a time by Director Westfield. After Superman's death at the hands of Doomsday, Westfield had Superman's body stolen and worked upon by the scientists of Cadmus in The Legacy of Superman #1 (1993). After the nearest approximation of his DNA is created, Westfield has a Guardian clone named Auron assault the Newsboy Legion clones and their adult \\"fathers\\" in an effort to acquire it. Auron almost kills the clones, causing them to crash land in the Habitat, before his Guardian memories come to the forefront. He takes the only copy of the DNA into space. The adult Legion then openly defy Westfield and ponder quitting Cadmus. Dabney Donovan, still insane, returns multiple times to plague Cadmus, such as capturing the adult Legion and subjecting them to various torments.Guardians Of Metropolis #1-4 (1994-1995). DC Comics. He would also ally himself with forces from Apokolips. Cadmus goes to war with the forces of Lex Luthor in a Superman story called \\"The Fall of Metropolis\\". This story features a \\"clone plague\\" with many clones becoming sick and even dying. Westfield is killed by Donovan. Cadmus is seemingly destroyed entirely,Adventures of Superman vol 1 #513 (June 1994).

The new project head is Mickey \\"the Mechanic\\" Cannon, a former Suicide Slum resident with a reputation for being able to \\"fix\\" anything, a car or a country. The new head of genetics is Dr. Serling Roquette, a teenaged genius with a crush on the Guardian and Superboy. Dabney Donovan is also brought back, under armed guard. Cannon made Cadmus more open to the public.Superboy vol. 2 #57. DC Comics. Shortly after this the Project temporarily came under the control of the Evil Factory, now revealed to be part of an organisation called The Agenda. This is run by Lex Luthor's ex-wife, the Contessa. The Agenda concerns itself with cloning for its own purposes. One of its operatives, Amanda Spence murders Superboy's girlfriend Tana Moon. The Agenda suffers setbacks at the hands of multitudes of superheroes, including mutinous superpowered beings from within their own ranks.Sins of Youth #1-3. DC Comics.

Following the Imperiex War, the entire project vanishes. The abandoned facilities, three miles below Metropolis, are later seen. Lex Luthor (no longer president) and several of his associates have appropriated the buildings for their own uses.Outsiders #25, (July 2005). DC Comics. During the Seven Soldiers maxi-series, it is mentioned that Cadmus had shut down and sold off the rights to the Guardian name and likeness to a New York-based newspaper called The Manhattan Guardian. The newspaper ended up using the name and costume to create its own superhero. During 52, Project Cadmus is shown to be still in existence. It wasn't until Countdown to Final Crisis Week 33 that the Project actually resurfaces, and it is still led by Mickey Cannon. He chases down Jimmy Olsen, eventually offering the boy a chance to work with Cadmus to help Olsen discover the mysteries of his new superpowers. Upon arrival at the Project, Olsen is greeted by Dubbilex and Serling Roquette. Roquette takes Jimmy aside to help him learn about his powers. However, when his powers start going out of control, he flees the Project rather than risk hurting someone.Countdown #32-33 (September 2007). DC Comics.

Under Quintum, the P.R.O.J.E.C.T. is dedicated to \\"the engineering of new human forms\\" including Bizarro worker drones, giants (Voyager Titans) who can travel through space under their own power, and microscopic \\"nanonauts\\" unlocking the mysteries of the sub-atomic world. The P.R.O.J.E.C.T.'s ultimate goal is to create a replacement Superman, in case something happens to the original. It is revealed that the P.R.O.J.E.C.T. created a formula to bestow Superman-level strength and durability on a normal person, but all of their test subjects ultimately burned out. Marked with \\"Do Not Open Until Doomsday\\", Jimmy Olsen injects himself the formula and transforms into a hulking, gray skinned figure with bony protrusions.

In other media =Television= Animation * Project Cadmus (also called Cadmus Project or simply Cadmus) was featured as an adversary of the Justice League in the first season (third overall) of the animated series Justice League Unlimited. It is described by Emil Hamilton as \\"power brokers, politicians, criminals, and black-ops mercenaries with one thing in common: they're humanity's last hope against metahumans\\" when he was later confronted by Superman. This version is a combination of the comics version of Cadmus, the Suicide Squad (which appeared in the series as its real name Task Force X in the comics), and Checkmate. In the series, Cadmus is a government project designed to take precautions against the League going rogue. The project was started when Superman was brainwashed by Darkseid into invading Earth at the end of Superman: The Animated Series where the project (called \\"Project: Achilles\\") was designed to deal with the Man of Steel if he were to attack the Earth again. It was created by Lex Luthor, and a mutual ally, the bigoted General Nathaniel Hardcastle, who was later killed by Galatea on orders of Cadmus. The project's goals extended to the Justice League as well after the Justice Lords incident. Members of this version of Cadmus include Amanda Waller, Professor Hamilton, Tala, General Wade Eiling, Professor Milo, Maxwell Lord, Hugo Strange, and Doctor Moon. For a short while, they also had turned Captain Atom to their cause. In addition, they also had Task Force X, which is the official name for the organization known in DC Comics as the Suicide Squad, for use in risky field missions. Cadmus was later shown to be backed by Lex Luthor, who only financed the project in a grab for superpowers of his own; a new AMAZO robot with Luthor's conscious mind implanted in it. After taking what he needed to build it from Cadmus and learning the League had figured out his link to the organization, Luthor attempted to destroy the organization by hacking into an immense laser built into the League's Watchtower. Although the building was destroyed, Waller \\"had the facility scrubbed as per standard protocol\\" after Superman and Huntress broke in to rescue The Question from Moon's captivity. It was then revealed that Brainiac was living inside Luthor at the time, improving upon his physical health and strength while \\"subtly influencing (his) actions\\". After they were confronted by Batman and then the rest of the founding members of the Justice League, which Waller had released from custody, Luthor and Braniac escaped to Washington, D.C. to a Cadmus building in order to merge with the Dark Heart, a nanotechnology-like alien being which the League defeated thanks to Atom. After both of them were defeated, Cadmus ceased operations against the League and the Justice League announced the establishment of a planetside base to improve their public relations. However, there were a few former members of Cadmus who were still against the Justice League, such as Tala, who ends up joining Gorilla Grodd's Secret Society and General Eiling. Project Cadmus was responsible for creating the characters Galatea (a clone of Supergirl who resembles Power Girl), Doomsday, the Royal Flush Gang, Volcana, the Ultimen (a team of genetically engineered heroes who are a pastiche of several heroes created for the Super Friends series) and ultimately Terry McGinnis (Batman II). When the Joker took the Royal Flush Gang from Cadmus, he also stole some technology he would later use to overwrite his DNA into Tim Drake during Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker as explained in \\"Epilogue\\". Elements of the organization were later brought together to initiate \\"Project Batman Beyond\\" to ensure that in some form or another, there \\"would always be a Batman\\" when an elderly Amanda Waller was visited by Terry McGinnis. Thus Cadmus is responsible for the continuation of the DC Animated Universe storyline into the future. * Project Cadmus first appears in the Young Justice episode \\"Independence Day\\". Project Cadmus is headed up by the seven members of Cadmus' Board of Directors that call themselves \\"The Light\\", codenamed L-1 (Vandal Savage), L-2 (Ra's al Ghul), L-3 (Lex Luthor), L-4 (the first Queen Bee of Bialya), L-5 (Ocean Master), L-6 (the Brain), and L-7 (Klarion the Witch Boy). According to series creator Greg Weisman, the numbers are based on the order in which they joined the Light. In \\"Independence Day\\" and \\"Fireworks\\", the Cadmus Building that was seen is run by Dr. Mark Desmond who is served by Dubbilex, Amanda Spence and a brainwashed Guardian. Robin, Aqualad and Kid Flash decide to do some investigating into Project Cadmus although their mentors in the Justice League instructed them to stay out of it while they were fighting Wotan. They fight Dubbilex, Guardian and a group of alien-looking Cadmus creatures called Genomorphs consisting of G-Dwarves (the worker Genomorphs with tentacles), G-Elves (clawed Genomorph warriors), G-Gnomes (small Genomorphs with telepathy), G-Sprites (insect-like Genomorphs that are kept in jars and are capable of generating electricity), G-Trolls (large Genomorphs with super-strength) and G-Goblins (humanoid Genomorphs with telepathy and telekinesis), the only one being Dubbilex. The teen heroes eventually locate a stasis chamber containing Superboy. While making their way to the surface, Robin, Aqualad, Kid Flash and Superboy run into Dubbilex, Guardian and the alien-looking creatures who want their freedom from Mark Desmond. When Mark Desmond turns into Blockbuster, he knocks down Guardian before fighting Robin, Aqualad, Kid Flash and Superboy. After Blockbuster is defeated by Robin, Aqualad, Kid Flash and Superboy and then taken away by some of the Justice League members, Batman states that Cadmus will be investigated. The next day, Guardian becomes the new head of the Cadmus Building but running it in a humane way. The Light wasn't pleased with what happened and vowed to make Robin, Aqualad, Kid Flash and Superboy pay for what happened at one of their Cadmus Buildings. In \\"Agendas\\", Superboy meets Lex Luthor in Washington DC who tells him that Project Cadmus has created a new Superclone. Guardian shows Superboy that he has redesigned the Cadmus building since Blockbuster's defeat. Superboy is telepathically told by Dubbilex asking what would happen if he did find a Superclone. After recovering from the Superclone's attack, Superboy learns from Dubbilex that Dr. Mark Desmond and Lex Luthor headed Project Match with the Superclone being the original with full Kryptonian DNA but unstable. Dubbilex telepathically guides Superboy to Genomorph City where the missing Genomorphs are living free and that the Genomorphs have Match telepathically subdued. Match ends up breaking free and attacks Superboy and Dubbilex. Superboy ends up using the patches that Lex Luthor has given him to hold back the human DNA so that he can be on equal grounds with Match. Upon subduing Match, Superboy is ceased from attacking when Guardian and the others show up. With Match on ice in his pod, Guardian states to Superboy that \\"it has to be this way\\". In \\"Auld Acquaintance\\", Lex Luthor, Brain, Monsieur Mallah, Queen Bee, Ocean Master and Ra's al Ghul infiltrate Project Cadmus and steal the clones that they have including the cryogenic pods holding both Match and the original Roy Harper. Live action * The television series Smallville referenced a company called \\"Cadmus Labs\\", which Lex Luthor bought from heir Victoria Hardwick. This Cadmus was merely part of a larger plan by Luthor; after it was taken from him in a hostile takeover by Victoria (who pretended to love Lex) and her father Henry, it turned out that the project was a feint. The company was in major financial and legal trouble and so the Hardwicks were financially crippled. It briefly appeared in Season 2 as Steven Hamilton was assigned there by Lex, as well as the arrogant Dr. Frederick Walden. Walden, a linguist was hired by Lex to search the Kawatche Caves in Smallville, believing them to be alien. In Season 10, Cadmus would remain owned by LuthorCorp and secretly develop genetic research in order to create clones of Lex. Lex planned to use these clones to heal his wounds, but was unable due to his apparent death at the hands of Oliver Queen in Season 8. In the first episode of the season, \\"Lazarus\\" it was revealed that some clones had been created including a young/LX-15 and elderly version of Lex/LX-3. The young Lex is revealed to be a hybrid clone of Lex Luthor and Clark Kent and is living with Clark Kent in Smallville. In one scene, he even dons the Superboy costume which is jeans and a black shirt with a red S on the chest. * Project Cadmus is first mentioned in Supergirl in the season one episode \\"Manhunter\\". J'onn J'onzz and Alex Danvers discover that Jeremiah Danvers is alive and being held at the facility. It had a longstanding relationship with the government - a major reason why Superman was unwilling to work with Washington. The organization appears as a recurring threat during season two seeking to root out and eliminate all aliens on Earth. The organization is led by Lillian Luthor (the primary antagonist of the second season), mother of Lex Luthor and the adoptive mother of Lena Luthor. In the season premiere \\"The Adventures of Supergirl\\", Cadmus turns John Corben into Metallo. In \\"The Last Children of Krypton\\", the organization announces that it has gone rogue, and is no longer working with the government. A mole working for Cadmus is discovered within the DEO. In the episode \\"Crossfire\\", a group of criminals are secretly given advanced alien weaponry by Cadmus to further advance their anti-alien agenda. In the episode \\"Changing\\", Project Cadmus abducts Mon-El. Kara rescues him, with Jeremiah's help in \\"The Darkest Place\\", battling another Cadmus experiment called Cyborg Superman - formerly DEO director Hank Henshaw. The episode \\"Medusa\\" sees Cadmus attempt to spread a virus that would kill all alien life, but the plan is thwarted, leading to Lillian Luthor's arrest, until in \\"Luthors\\" where she is freed by Hank Henshaw and Corben/Metallo. All three go to a remote facility built by her son to unleash a powerful nuclear weapon to wipe out alien beings in National City; the plan is thwarted by Supergirl and Corben dies in facility while Lillian and Henshaw escape. In the episode \\"Homecoming\\", it is revealed that Jeremiah has joined Cadmus as well. After his rescue from Cadmus soldiers, Supergirl and her family celebrate his return, except for Mon-El who has suspicions on him. In the same time Cadmus apparently made fusion bomb using energy from Supergirl's heat vision in order to frame aliens for dropping it on National City, but it is discovered to be a ruse. Jeremiah (being cybernetically enhanced like Hank) eventually \\"betrayed\\" DEO where he stole a national registry of aliens in preparation for kidnapping all aliens from Earth by using their massive ship, Hoshin fregate, to exile them in space on another planet. In \\"Exodus\\", Cadmus already began operation Exodus to kidnap several aliens to deport them. Supergirl and her friends discover their holding site where they prepare the launch of their ship. Alex Danvers, who went to search for her father, gets in and attempts to rescue them, but the ship automatically launched in space until Supergirl arrived and brought down the ship to Earth, thwarting Cadmus's plans once again. Also, Jeremiah Danvers turned against Cadmus to rescue his daughters and aliens from them. He explained to Alex that he had to work for them to protect his daughters, otherwise, they would kill him and his family. In \\"Resist\\", Lillian Luthor came to Supergirl and her team to propose an alliance between her organisation and DEO to stop Daxamite invasion on Earth, in addition that her daughter Lena Luthor is captive with them. Supergirl refused initially, but later changed the mind. Lillian proposed to go to Fortress of Solitude where the Phantom Zone projector is held in order to infiltrate Daxamite ship and rescue Lena and Mon-El from Rhea. Kara, Lillian and Hank activate the projector and board to ship to save them. After rescuing them, Lillian and Hank betray Kara and Mon-El to leave them behind while beaming only her daughter and themselves to Fortress. However, Kara expected her betrayal and her friend Winn Schott Jr. put a bug device on Hank prior to rescue operation. She turned on the device to force him in reactivating the projector to beam Mon-El out of the spaceship. In the season two finale, \\"Nevertheless, She Persisted\\", Lillian visited her daughter in her company's building, telling her that despite her malevolent acts she wants to make world as a better place for living and promises to have better relationship with her, even telling Lena that she could be a Luthor who can save a world. Kara and Kal-El come to their building for help in defeating Daxamites. Lillian shows them a device from Lex's vault that scatters a toxic substance in atmosphere (originally with kryptonite, but now with lead). J'onn tells Winn to help Lillian and Lena to finish this device despite his reluctance. During the fight between Kara and Rhea in fighting ritual called Dakkam-Ur, Winn and Luthors are near to finish a device. When the situation goes worse, Lillian hesitates when she wants to turn on the device, but Lena tells her that only Kara can activate it in the case she loses against Rhea. Kara defeats Rhea and unleashes the lead where it poisons many Daxamites and kills Rhea, while others (including Mon-El) fled into space. In National City news, it is stated that Cadmus saved the world and wants to establish peace on Earth, but this is a potential ruse, implying that Cadmus returned to its old ways. Lillian returns in season three episode \\"For Good\\" where she is aware that her daughter is threatened by Morgan Edge and she tries to kill him, only to be stopped by Supergirl, Mon-El and Lena. She is arrested along with Morgan Edge. Although Lillian appears in the fourth season, Cadmus doesn't appear, suggesting that the organisation itself is disbanded. * Cadmus Labs appears in the Titans episode \\"Dick Grayson\\". It's post-credits scene shows Superboy and Krypto escaping from their Metropolis facility. In season two, Cadmus begins it's pursuit of Superboy with help from Mercy Graves. =Film= * Dr. Leo Quintum's DNA P.R.O.J.E.C.T. appears in the film All-Star Superman (based on the acclaimed series by Grant Morrison). * Cadmus appeared in the live-action Green Lantern film, at the background when Waller and Hector Hammond enter the top secret DEO facility, a sign appears that said: \\"Cadmus\\". Later on when a transformed Hector Hammond attacks the facility and kills many security guards (including his own father) until Green Lantern stops him and saves Amanda Waller. =Video games= * In the cancelled Flash game, Cadmus Soldiers were supposed to have technology that tapped into the \\"Speed Force\\" and allowed to make The Flash go slower, making the soldiers as fast as the Flash. * Cadmus Labs is involved in Superman Returns: The Video Game. During an interview, the game's executive producer mentioned that among the game's various enemies were \\"Bizarro's minions escaped from Cadmus Labs\\".Shack News * Project Cadmus appears in DC Universe Online. In the Area 51 alert, the players encounter Project Cadmus' soldiers led by Mickey Cannon while preventing Brainiac's forces from stealing a piece of Kryptonite that was being held in the Area 51 buildings. * In the Batman: Arkham City DLC campaign called \\"Harley's Revenge\\", CADMUS is mentioned on posters jotted around the Sionis Steel Mill reading \\"CADMUS LABS.

The serial is set on the planet Varos, where the Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker) and Peri (Nicola Bryant) find themselves in a dystopian world in which torture and executions are broadcast to the public as entertainment, and the alien mining representative Sil (Nabil Shaban) is extorting the planet's Governor (Martin Jarvis) into selling the valuable ore Zeiton-7 to his company cheaply. Plot While repairing the TARDIS console, the Sixth Doctor finds that the TARDIS has unexpectedly stopped in deep space and he can do nothing to fix it. Peri locates the TARDIS manual and presents it to the Doctor who dismisses it, as he knows perfectly well that transitional elements within the TARDIS have stopped producing orbital energy and only Zeiton-7 ore can realign the power systems. But as the Doctor explains, Zeiton-7 is exceptionally rare and only comes from one planet in the Cetes constellation: Varos. On Varos, originally a prison planet that now functions as a government system where voting is mandatory and torture and executions are televised, the Galatron Mining Corporation's swindling Mentor representative Sil is negotiating with Varos's Governor over the price of Zeiton-7 ore. Wanting a fair price for his people, and unaware that his Chief Officer is in league with Sil, the governor addresses his people to vote if they should hold out longer for a fair price. However, the popular vote is against the Governor, and as a consequence, he is subjected to exposure to potentially lethal Human Cell Disintegration Bombardment. As losing a subsequent vote will almost surely kill him, the Governor is forced to please the citizens by ordering the execution of a rebel leader named Jondar. By this time, the Doctor has managed to repair the TARDIS sufficiently and arrives at Varos's Punishment Dome close to where Jondar is to be executed. The guard stationed at the execution believes the TARDIS and its occupants are a hallucination resulting from the psychological effects of the Dome, which allows the Doctor and Peri to incapacitate the guard and free Jondar. But with their way back to the TARDIS blocked by more guards, the three flee, meeting up with Jondar's wife Areta. Venturing through the Punishment Dome to find another route to the TARDIS, the Doctor is separated from the others, who are arrested. With his attempt to escape now being broadcast as entertainment to all of Varos, he enters a corridor that appears in his mind as a desert, and due to its psychological effects, begins to die from thirst. By this time, Peri has been brought to the control centre in the company of the Governor, Sil and the other officers. They question Peri as she watches the Doctor's body being taken away to an acid bath for disposal. However, the Doctor has survived, and though he escapes, causing the death of two guards in the process, he is quickly arrested by Quillam, Varos's chief scientist. The Governor decrees that the Doctor and Jondar will be executed by hanging, while Peri and Areta are to be subjected to undergo horrific scientific experiments at the hands of Quillam and his cell mutator. At the gallows, at the last moment, the Doctor questions the Governor about Sil and his extortion while offering to help in the Zeiton-7 matter, causing Sil to order his bodyguards to rush the platform to pull the lever to silence the Doctor. But it turns out the execution was actually a farce to extract information out of the Doctor. The Doctor, who suspected this, agrees to help Varos on the condition that Peri and Areta are returned unharmed. However, Quillam refuses, even under duress, forcing the Doctor to resort to shooting the entire control panel. Luckily, the process has been halted in time, and the mutations are only temporary, and Peri and Areta soon return to their original selves. The four then escape back into the depths of the Punishment Dome towards a possible escape route before Peri, still in a stupor after the effects of the mutator, is recaptured and taken to the control centre. The Chief Officer and Sil make their final move on the Governor in hopes that losing the next vote will finally kill him, securing the way for them to control Varos and the Zeiton-7 ore. Meanwhile, the Doctor, Jondar, and Areta make their way into the End Zone of the Dome and the supposed exit. The vote starts and the bombardment begins, but the guard Meldak has a change of heart and stops the device, saving the Governor and Peri. The three then make their way to meet up with the Doctor. The Doctor's group is then chased by two cannibals, but loses them thanks to some deadly plant tendrils. The Chief and Quillam arrive on the scene but are entangled in the tendrils, killing them. The group then meet up with Peri, the Governor, and Meldak. They all make their way back to the control centre as Sil reveals the invasion force he had dispatched hours earlier to take Varos by force. However, Sil is mortified to learn that the invasion force has been called back, and a second Zeiton-7 deposit has been discovered, so his company has ordered him to obtain the Varosian ore at any price. The Doctor and Peri then bid the Governor farewell, taking some ore with them for the TARDIS. Soon after, the Governor issues a message to the citizens to abolish their government's injustice, torture, and executions. Citizens watch in disbelief, wondering what they should do now with their new-found freedom. Production This story was written as a replacement for a serial called Song of the Space Whale by comics writer Pat Mills, which was originally scheduled to be in season 20, before finally being cancelled. Working titles for this story included Domain and Planet of Fear (the latter being vetoed for being too similar to the previous season's Planet of Fire). The story was first written for the 1982 season, but was repeatedly pushed back and re-written. In its final draft, the story had a number of comedic sequences, most of which wound up being cut, and one of which, the acid bath sequence, was played seriously. The result was that the final story was much darker than originally intended. The more grim acid bath sequence was much criticised for its tone and for the Doctor's flippant remark at the end of the scene. During the first recording of the noose execution scene, part of the set collapsed under the weight of the actors. Fortunately, this did not happen when Baker and Connery actually had their necks in the nooses (although in that case, for safety reasons the nooses were not actually tied up).The Colin Baker Years, BBC Video 1994, at 34 minutes from beginning of video In his 1986 interview for Starburst, script editor Eric Saward said he thought this story was \\"poorly directed\\".\\"The Revelations of a Script Editor\\". Starburst. September 1986. Issue 97. Page 16. =Cast notes= Jason Connery (Jondar) is the son of actor Sean Connery. Martin Jarvis makes a guest appearance as the beleaguered Governor of Varos; he had previously appeared in the series in a story in each of the previous two decades: The Web Planet (1965) and Invasion of the Dinosaurs (1974). Subsequent to Vengeance On Varos, Jarvis as a different character reunited with Colin Baker in the Big Finish story Jubilee. After Jubilee, Jarvis appeared in the Torchwood BBC radio play The Devil and Miss Carew. Nabil Shaban features as Sil, who would return in the next season's Mindwarp. Stephen Yardley (Arak) previously played Sevrin in Genesis of the Daleks (1975). Owen Teale (Maldak) later appeared as Evan Sherman in the Torchwood episode \\"Countrycide\\" (2006). He also played Hayton in the audio play The Mind's Eye. Sheila Reid later played Clara Oswald's Gran in \\"The Time of the Doctor\\" (2013) and \\"Dark Water\\" (2014). Broadcast and reception Vengeance on Varos provoked considerable controversy for its violent content. The scenes featuring acid bath deaths, attempted hangings and genetic experiments on the female characters were widely criticised in the Radio Times letters page, and the programme Points of View. Unlike previous criticisms of the show's violence, this time complaints about Vengeance on Varos were raised by members of the general public and some of the show's fans, as well as traditional critics such as Mary Whitehouse. Reviewing the story in About Time, Tat Wood described it as \\"like channel-zapping between a radical fringe theatre and children's television\\". He praised Martin's script and the story's production design, stating the story \\"gets more marks for effort than anything else this year\\". Wood also suggested that if someone wanted to understand what it was like to be living in Thatcher's Britain, they should watch Vengeance on Varos, then to \\"imagine a world where this could be followed by Jim'll Fix It\\". In Doctor Who: The Complete Guide, Mark Campbell awarded Vengeance on Varos six out of ten, describing it as \\"a brave idea, hindered by a plodding narrative and wooden performances\\". He also thought the \\"notorious acid bath scene\\" was \\"deeply problematic\\". Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Philip Martin, was published by Target Books in January 1988. It was originally planned to be released 2 years earlier, but was pushed back after delays in the delivery of the manuscript by Philip Martin. However, it kept its original number of 106. In addition, although Target had launched a new cover design format for the books with the previous volume, Time and the Rani, reflecting the new series logo of the Sylvester McCoy era, Vengeance on Varos was published with the earlier book cover format using the neon-tube logo of the Baker-Davison era. In 1997 the novel was also issued by BBC Audio as an audio book, read by Colin Baker. =Home media= Vengeance on Varos was released on VHS in the UK in 1993 as part of the Doctor Who 30th Anniversary celebrations. It was released on DVD in the UK on 15 October 2001. The DVD commentary is provided by actors Colin Baker (The Doctor), Nicola Bryant (Peri), and Nabil Shaban (Sil). This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in issue 68 on 10 August 2011. A Special Edition DVD was released on 10 September 2012. In 2013 it was released on DVD again as part of the \\"Doctor Who: The Doctors Revisited 5-8\\" box set, alongside Earthshock, Remembrance of the Daleks and the TV Movie. Alongside a documentary on the Sixth Doctor, the disc features the serial put together as a single feature in widescreen format with an introduction from current show runner Steven Moffat, as well as its original version.

In its use of meta-theatricality (plays-within-the-play), it is far ahead of its time. It was first performed at the H√¥tel de Bourgogne in 1636 and published in 1639. Corneille wrote this piece at the age of 29 and had already written seven other plays. L'Illusion comique marks a turning point in his career. This piece can be regarded as the end of an apprenticeship during which the author demonstrates his literary prowess. In this work, Corneille makes use of all theatre genres: the first act is a prologue that is inspired by the pastoral style, and the next three acts are an imperfect comedy with the farcical character Matamore at the center. The fourth and fifth acts evolve into a tragicomedy with their episodes of rivalry, imprisonment, and even death. L'Illusion comique is therefore a summary of a theatrical universe, and it is in this play that Corneille shows his mastery of theatre as a whole.  Plot summary * Act I. The first act begins at the entrance to a grotto where Pridamant and Dorante are trying to discover the cause of the disappearance of Clindor, Pridamant's son. Dorante wants to introduce Pridamant to a magician who can help. This magician, Alcandre, correctly determines the reasons why Pridamant has come to him and tells him that he can show him his son through a device. Alcandre asks Dorante to leave. After Dorante leaves, Alcandre tells Pridamant that his son is living the life of a picaro since his disappearance and that he is now in the service of a captain of soldiers in the region of Bordeaux. * Act II. At the beginning of Act II, Alcandre and Pridamant are looking at the magician's instrument and are able to see Clindor and his master Matamore. Clindor is listening to Matamore brag about his impossible feats while waiting for the arrival of Isabelle, who appears accompanied by her official servant. Clindor and Matamore hide themselves; and Adraste approaches Isabelle. She rejects his advances but this does not keep him from asking her father for permission to marry her. After his departure, Matamore and Clindor come out of hiding and Matamore leaves when a page arrives to tell him that he has pressing affairs elsewhere. Alone with Clindor, Isabelle reaffirms her love for him. She flees when Adraste returns. Clindor also leaves, and Adraste begins to suspect that Clindor is his rival. Isabelle's servant, Lyse, tells Adraste he should go and spy on the two of them. Alone, Lyse reveals that she is in love with Clindor and hopes to get revenge on her mistress by sending Adraste. Alcandre tries to reassure Pridamant that all will be well for his son. * Act III. The third act begins with the reproaches of Isabelle's father, G√©ronte, who wants her to marry Adraste. Alone, G√©ronte decides to force her to do his will. He then dismisses Matamore, who vows revenge. Lyse appears and Clindor tries to seduce her, pretending that he only loves Isabelle for her money. He leaves, and Lyse hesitates before continuing with her plot against the lovers. Matamore arrives on stage and hides himself when Isabelle and Clindor appear. Clindor and Isabelle try to kiss, when Adraste arrives with G√©ronte and his valets. Matamore flees, Clindor attacks Adraste, but Adraste strikes back. The final image is of Pridamant, who believes his son is dead. * Act IV. Act IV opens with Isabelle's tragic monologue. Adraste is dead, Clindor is hurt and also sentenced to death. Isabelle vows that she will die. She is rejoined by Lyse who makes fun of her and then reassures her: Isabelle and Clindor can flee that night with Lyse and the jailer, who is now Lyse's lover. Isabelle goes to prepare her affairs, and Lyse admits that she didn't resent Clindor so much as to want his death. Isabelle runs across Matamore who has been in hiding for several days. She and Lyse make fun of him and chase him off. The jailer arrives to let them know that all is ready. They liberate Clindor from prison. Alcandre assures Pridamant that the foursome will find great fortune. * Act V. Alcandre asks Pridamant to stay near him, as the young heroes arrive, completely changed. Isabelle appears at night, dressed as a princess in a palace garden to tell Lyse that her husband has a lover's meeting with Princess Rosine. Clindor arrives, and mistaking Rosine for Isabelle, declares his love for her. Isabelle reproaches him for his infidelities and reminds him that she left everything in order to follow him. Clindor reaffirms his love for her, but Isabelle threatens suicide. Clindor renounces Rosine just as Rosine arrives. Isabelle watches from the shadows as Clindor resists her advances. Suddenly, Prince Florilame's men enter and kill both Rosine and Clindor. Isabelle is taken to the prince, who is in love with her. Pridamant is beside himself, when Alcandre begins laughing. He reveals Clindor and the other characters alive and in the process of dividing money. Clindor and his friends have become actors and what Pridamant observed was their performance of the final act of a tragedy. The play ends with Alcandre's apology explaining the virtue of becoming an actor. Characters *Alcandre, a magician. *Pridamant, father of Clindor. *Dorante, friend of Pridamant. *Matamore, a captain. *Clindor, son of Pridamant, lover of Isabelle. *Isabelle, lover of Clindor. *Adraste, in love with Isabelle. *G√©ronte, Isabelle's father. *Lise, Isabelle's servant, in love with Clindor. *Rosine, an English princess. *Florilame, the husband of Rosine.  Interpretation = Structure = L'Illusion comique plays with the idea of theatre within the theatre and has many layers of representation: * The first level is the entire play with its share of conflicts, complications, and d√©nouements. * The second level is the scene between Alcandre and Pridamant, who are actors and spectators at the same time * The third level is that of the young lovers, Clindor and Isabelle, and their adventures * The fourth level is that of the play that is performed by Clindor and Isabelle in the final act =\\"The theatre of the world\\"= The complex structure of the play, based on a mise en abyme and a play on appearances is designed to confuse the reader. The game of illusions is found in the Baroque idea that life is a theatre; and Corneille exploits this idea by mixing the real life of Clindor and the role that he plays. Disguise and changing identity are marks of the Baroque in this play. The grotto can also be interpreted as a metaphor for the theatre and its spectators. = Instability= The linearity of the story is broken several times, and numerous digressions interrupt actions that overlap and are often incomplete. The principal story is interlaced with many subplots. The inconsistency of the plot is reinforced by the amorous inconsistency of the characters. This instability is present again at the end when Pridamant and the reader cannot distinguish between reality and fiction. = Disregard to the three unities = Corneille seems to disregard the three unities of classical theatre: *the entanglement of the plots breaks the unity of action; *two years pass between the end of act IV and the beginning of act V, which breaks the unity of time ; *the unity of place is in question: the first act is in Alcandre's grotto in Touraine, the three middle acts are in Bordeaux, and the final act is in Paris L'Illusion comique was written during a period of transition from the Baroque to the Classical, and it can be seen as both a homage to the Baroque theatre as well as a satire of the same. =Other elements= Classicism Although this piece is primarily Baroque, certain passages seem to follow the traditional lines of classical tragedy. In spite of the legerity of the plot concerning the lovers, the theme of death appears several times. Of course, there is the false death of Clindor which plunges the play into the atmosphere of tragedy; like Pridamant, the spectator is faced with emotions of terror and pity which are the two great theatrical sentiments according to Aristotle. However, the two passages that are the most classical in nature are the monologues of Isabelle (Act IV, scene 1) and of Clindor (Act IV, scene 7. Devastated by the judgment against her lover, Isabelle imagines her own death like the heroine of a tragedy. Moreover, she is not satisfied to follow Clindor in death; she also hopes to punish her father. As for Clindor, he uses his memory of Isabelle in order to overcome his fear of death. He exclaims: \\"I die glorious because I die for you!\\" For a moment, he falls back into despair, but ultimately, love allows him to transcend his thoughts and fears of death.  The Commedia dell'arte The Commedia dell'arte is the principal source for the new theatre of the 17th century by bringing together a popular technique with the aesthetic development of the Renaissance in Italy. The Commedia dell'arte concerns itself mostly with the verbal and physical dexterity of the actors and relies heavily on improvisation. The character of Matamore is directly borrowed from this tradition as well as the juxtaposition of characters from several social classes. Matamore can be compared to Sganarelle, the valet of Don Juan.  The pastoral tradition Pastoral theatre takes place in an idealized setting according to the ancient model of Arcadia. The first act of L'Illusion comique borrows several elements from the pastoral, including the grotto and the magician.  The \\"Tragi-comedy\\" A tragicomedy uses characters that are relatively close to everyday life who are confronted with situations where emotions get in the way of actions. The mixture of death (tragedy) and marriage (comedy) is one manifestation of this. Adaptations The play has enjoyed renewed popularity in recent years, since Tony Kushner adapted it as The Illusion. The Com√©die Fran√ßaise commissioned an adaptation in modern dress from the actor/director Mathieu Amalric and that film d√©buted on French television in 2010. Among other changes, Matamore has become the designer of a shooter video game, while the final act takes place in a night club. Ranjit Bolt's translation was dramatized and broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 25 September 2011 directed by Peter Kavanagh with original music composed and performed by Russell Taylor and Steve Cooke. The cast included: Richard Johnson as Alcandre, Michael Maloney as Clindor, John Sessions as Matamore, Hattie Morahan as Isabelle, Benjamin Whitrow as G√©ronte, Pip Torrens as Adraste, Rosie Fellner as Lyse, Paul Moriarty as Pridamant, Simon Bubb as Dorante and Victoria Inez-Hardy as Empress/Queen. In 2012, a new adaptation of the play opened at Under St. Mark's in New York City. The production was adapted and directed by Kevin P. Joyce, and transposes the play from 17th century France to Turn-of-the-20th Century Louisiana, specifically the Atchafalaya Basin (Alcandre's lair), the Garden District (Isabelle's home) and a showboat (the Fifth Act). The role of Alcandre was rewritten for a woman and modeled after Marie Laveau. The production was directed by Mr. Joyce and featured Christopher Fayne as Pridamant, Rebeca Radozskowicz as Alcandre (understudied by Juanita Pearl Johnson), Matt Alford as Clindor, Alexandra Scardapane as Isabelle, Maisie Salinger as Lyse, Chris Lemieux as Matamore, Jesse Keitel as Adraste, Evan Pearson as Geronte, Andrew Meyer as Dorante/Jailer and Joshua Wise as the Page. It also featured music by PJ Rassmussen, designs by Justin West, Matsy Stintson, George Scholes Robson V, Vincent Coviello & Brian McManimon, as well as fight choreography by Brian Walters. The production received positive reviews from audiences but no reviews were publicly published due to the play's limited run.

She was Princess of Asturias, the heir presumptive to the Crown of Spain, for all 24 years of her life. Had her younger sibling, unborn at the death of Alfonso XII, been a daughter, Mercedes would have been Queen of Spain. The sibling proved to be a boy, Alfonso XIII, and on his birth in 1886, Mercedes turned out not to be queen. She resumed the position of heir presumptive, which she held until her own death, and was succeeded in it by her own infant son Alfonso, Alfonso XIII having not yet married and fathered a legitimate child. Mercedes married in Madrid on 14 February 1901, her second cousin, Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, a nephew of the King of the then- defunct Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, who was elevated to the rank of Infante of Spain. The marriage was highly controversial due to her father-in-law's ties with the Carlists. She died three years later from complication while giving birth to her third child.  Early life  Born on 11 September 1880 at the Royal Palace of Madrid, Mercedes was the eldest daughter of King Alfonso XII and his second wife, Maria Christina of Austria.Puga 1998, p. 175. She was christened Mar√≠a de las Mercedes Isabel Teresa Cristina Alfonsa.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2007, p. 115. Her godmother was Queen Isabella II, her paternal grandmother, who came from retirement in Paris to attend the birth of her first grandchild. There was great disappointment because family and nation were hoping for a boy. To smooth things out, Queen Maria Christina suggested giving her daughter the name Mercedes in honor of her husband's first wife, Mercedes of Orl√©ans. Mercedes was heir presumptive from her birth, but the disappointment was so great that she was initially treated only as an infanta. Antonio C√°novas del Castillo, then head of the government, who disliked Maria Christina and did not want the crown to pass again to a female after the disastrous reign of Isabella II, decided to ignore the newborn.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2007, p. 116. Mercedes's paternal aunt Isabella retained the title of Princess of Asturias until Pr√°xedes Mateo Sagasta, President of the government replacing C√°novas, pressured King Alfonso XII to accord the title to Mercedes, which he did on 10 March 1881. On 12 November 1882, Mercedes gained a sister, Infanta Maria Teresa. The marriage of their parents was unhappy. Alfonso had married Maria Christina in order to secure the succession to the throne. He did not love his wife and was disappointed when she gave birth to two daughters, while he already had two extramarital sons. In July 1883, Maria Christina left the Spanish court and traveled with her daughters to visit her own family in Austria. By the summer of 1884, Alfonso XII's health deteriorated; he had tuberculosis. After a brief improvement, the 27-year-old king died on 25 November 1885 leaving his wife pregnant. The birth of another sister would have made Mercedes queen, but the sibling proved to be a boy, who became King Alfonso XIII upon his birth on 17 May 1886. She resumed the position of heir presumptive, which she held for the rest of her life.  Education  Mercedes with Queen Maria Christina, King Alfonso XIII and Infanta Maria Teresa. Mercedes made her first public appearance at the royal court by the hand of her mother when Queen Maria Christina was declared regent. The education of the Princess of Asturias and her younger sister Infanta Maria Teresa was confined to the Royal Palace of Madrid in an austere environment headed by two widows: their mother and their paternal aunt Isabella (herself formerly Princess of Asturias).Puga 1998, p. 177. The Queen brought up her three children strictly. Despite her constitutional status, Mercedes was not given an education that would have prepared her to govern the nation. She received instead the conventional upbringing of princesses of her time. There were piano and painting lessons, knitting practices and the Queen involved her daughter in palace duties.Puga 1998, p. 178. Particular attention was paid to obedience and religious precepts. Mercedes grew up to be a serious young woman, shy and unprepossessing. She was more Habsburg in appearance due to her long face. The family spent the summer months in the Miramar Palace in San Sebasti√°n.Puga 1998, p. 177. In her adolescence, Mercedes accompanied her mother to trips abroad visiting her paternal grandmother in Paris, her paternal aunt Paz in Munich, and her maternal grandmother Elisabeth Franziska in Vienna. The situation in Spain became more complicated with the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898. Mercedes and her sister lived a restricted life. Their conservative mother did not allow them to take part in the social life of the Spanish nobility. The Queen offered a party in the Royal Palace to mark the debut in society of her daughters on 9 May 1899, the event having been delayed due to the war.Puga 1998, p. 179. At the dance, Mercedes fell in love with Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Two Sicilies; the two were frequently seen together.Puga 1998, p. 182.  Marriage  Mercedes, Princess of Asturias Prince Carlos, Queen Maria Christina's first cousin once removed, belonged to the deposed royal family of the Two Sicilies and had arrived in Spain years earlier in order to follow a military career in the Spanish army. The pairing of the princess and Prince Carlos was not accidental. He had been chosen as a prospective husband by both Queen Maria Christina and Infanta Isabella, who was his aunt as well. It was considered paramount to marry Mercedes to a member of the Bourbon family in order to avoid a change of the dynasty in case she succeeded her brother. Prince Carlos offered other advantages as groom to the Princess of Asturias. As he did not belong to a reigning royal family, he could settle permanently in Spain and adopt the necessary Spanish nationality. He had, however, to resign to his rights to the crown of the Two Sicilies as he was third in line after his father and his elder brother.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2007, p. 214. Carlos was of serious character, shy, handsome, and Mercedes was attracted to him. Their engagement was announced on December 14, 1899. It immediately faced the strong opposition of the liberal party, the republican faction and a wide spectrum of the Spanish society. There was nothing personal against the Prince himself, but his father, the Count of Caserta, had been a general in the last Carlist War and had taken part in the looting of the city of Cuenca by Carlist troops.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2007, p. 213. It was feared that Caserta's son marrying Mercedes would bring the Carlist party too close to the Spanish throne. Even the Prince's name ‚Äì Carlos ‚Äì aroused suspicion. In addition, the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies was considered the most conservative Catholic dynasty, which worried the liberal party.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2007, p. 213. There were bitter attacks against Mercedes's marriage in the newspapers and protest on the streets in Madrid, Seville and Granada. The Archbishop of Valladolid, one of Spain‚Äôs most prominent prelates, wrote a letter to the Queen warning her against the dire consequences if the marriage would take place.Puga 1998, p. 183. The Queen wrote him back: \\" Monsignor, dedicate yourself to direct your diocese and praying, which are your main obligations, perhaps this way none of the catastrophe you predict will happen\\". Mercedes herself expressed her frustration to the strong opposition to her choice of groom in a letter to her aunt Paz: \\"I am happy to marry him, but I am also upset at those who have created such a fuss and made mother suffer for this... all because his father fought alongside don Carlos. Is this fair?\\"Puga 1998, p. 184. The controversy marred the wedding festivities.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2007, p. 218.Puga 1998, p. 186. On the day of the wedding, the streets leading to the Royal Palace were barricaded for fear of the protesters and a vast number of troops deployed through the capital. There were no major incidents, however, and the ceremony took place on 14 February 1901 in the chapel of the Royal Palace of Madrid.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2007, p. 218.Puga 1998, p. 186.  Death  The couple lived at the Royal palace of Madrid in close proximity to Queen Maria Christina, as she herself had wished.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2007, p. 219. The union was happy and two children were born in quick succession: Prince Alfonso (1901‚Äì1964) and Prince Fernando (1903‚Äì1905). Pregnant for the third time, Mercedes longed for a daughter after having two sons. In September 1904, she turned twenty four years old. The following month, twenty days before her due day, Mercedes fell seriously ill.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2007, p. 245. She had appendicitis which initially was misdiagnosed as simple intestinal cramps. Peritonitis set in and on the early hours on 16 October 1904 Mercedes gave birth prematurely to her third child, Princess Isabella Alfonsa (1904‚Äì1985). The health of the mother was so seriously compromised that little attention was given to the child, who was believed to have been stillborn until the young King Alfonso realized the baby was alive. Mercedes died the following day, on 17 October 1904, surrounded by her family. Mercedes' three children were left in the care of Queen Maria Christina and raised in the court of King Alfonso XIII. The elder son was not given the title of Prince of Asturias, but replaced his mother as heir presumptive.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2007, p. 247.

After six years of operation, the studio was shut down on June 26, 2000, ten days after the release of its final film, Titan A.E., and was replaced by Fox's Blue Sky Studios division. History =Founding= After the financially unsuccessful release of Don Bluth Entertainment-produced film Thumbelina in 1994, animators Don Bluth and Gary Goldman were hired by Bill Mechanic, then- chairman of 20th Century Fox, to create a brand new Fox animation studio. Mechanic and John Matoian, president of Fox Family Films, also brought in Stephen Brain (Executive VP at Silver Pictures) as Senior VP/General Manager to oversee the startup of the studio and run day-to-day operations of the division. =About the studio= The company was designed to compete with Walt Disney Feature Animation, which had phenomenal success during the late 1980s and early 1990s with the releases of films such as The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992) and The Lion King (1994). Disney veterans Bluth and Goldman came in 1994 to Fox from Sullivan Bluth Studios, which had produced An American Tail (1986), The Land Before Time (1988), and All Dogs Go to Heaven (1989), among other films. Before Bluth came to Fox, the studio distributed three animated features during the 1990s which were produced by outside studios - FernGully: The Last Rainforest (1992), Once Upon a Forest (1993) and The Pagemaster (1994), the last two of which were both commercial and critical failures. Even before, Fox distributed Hugo the Hippo (1975) by William Feigenbaum and J√≥zsef G√©mes, two Ralph Bakshi features, Wizards (1977) and Fire and Ice (1983), as well as Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure (1977) by Richard Williams. Also, Fox distributed Asterix Conquers America (1994) in France and the United Kingdom. =Productions= Fox Animation Studios did not achieve the same level of success as Disney's animated crop, due to increased competition from Pixar and DreamWorks Animation, the declining revenues of the Disney Renaissance, and the rise of computer-generated animation. First theatrical release Anastasia (1997) found critical and box-office success, but second theatrical release Titan A.E. (2000) got mixed reviews and was a costly flop, losing $100 million for 20th Century Fox. Nearly a year before its closure, 20th Century Fox laid off 300 of the nearly 380 people who worked at the Phoenix studio in order to \\"make films more efficiently.\\" =Shutdown= On June 26, 2000, the studio was shut down after six years of operation, resulting from financial failure and poor problems. Their last film set to be made would have been an adaptation of Wayne Barlowe's illustrated novel Barlowe's Inferno, and it was set to be done entirely with computer animation. Fox Animation Studios' only other productions were the PBS television series Adventures from the Book of Virtues (1996‚Äì2000) and the direct-to-video spin-off to Anastasia, Bartok the Magnificent (1999), along with sub-contract work for DreamWorks Animation's The Prince of Egypt (1998). Out of all the sequels and spin-offs based on existing Don Bluth properties, Bartok was the only one to actually have Bluth and Goldman as directors.

During divine > service, the bishop stands on such rugs, as a reminder that he should, by > his teaching and his life, rise above his flock, and be to them an example > of a soul aspiring from the things of earth to those of heaven. Appearance The eagle rug is normally woven or embroidered so as to depict an eagle soaring over a city that is surrounded by walls and towers. The walled city represents the bishop's episcopal authority over his Diocese, and his defence of the faithful in it. The eagle soaring above the city represents the bishop's uprightness of life, and his sound theological preaching of the Gospel, which should soar above all worldliness and elevate the hearts and minds of the faithful. Around the eagle's head is a halo, in imitation of the eagle used to depict St. John the Divine, and symbolizing theological attainments and the grace of the Holy Spirit. The eagle is also a reminder that, \\"as an eagle can see clearly over distances, so must a bishop oversee all parts of his diocese.\\" Use Any time a bishop is present in the church, or functioning at some service outdoors - whether vested and serving or whether simply wearing the mantle - he stands on an eagle rug. During the Hierarchical Divine Liturgy many eagle rugs are used, there always being one where he is seated or standing, and before he moves to a spot (such as on the Ambo) to give a blessing, an eagle rug is placed there for him to stand on as he blesses. The eagle rug placed at the bishop's cathedra is slightly larger than the others used during the services. The eagle rug is always placed so that the head of the eagle faces the direction the bishop is facing. Special Form Before his consecration, a bishop-elect is led onto a very large eagle rug, used specifically for this purpose, as the consecrating bishops examine him regarding his faith.

Geography  The range runs for approximately 60 miles (100 km) northwest-to-southeast, through western Grand and Summit counties, and eastern Routt and Eagle counties. They form the southern extension of the Park Range, extending southward from Rabbit Ears Pass (U.S. Highway 40) to the Eagle River near Vail. The Colorado River passes through the range at Gore Canyon. The range forms part of the western boundary of Middle Park at the headwaters of the Colorado, separating it from the upper basin of the Yampa River to the west. The northern section of the range north of Gore Pass is somewhat lower than the southern section, along the western side of the valley of the Blue River. The ridges of the range are prominently visible on clear days from the summit of Trail Ridge Road in Rocky Mountain National Park approximately 50 miles (80 km) to the east. The range is traversed at its southern and southwestern lower flanks by Interstate 70 from Silverthorne to Vail. Much of the range is located within the Arapaho and White River National Forests, and large portions are protected within the Eagles Nest Wilderness.  History  The range was named for Lord St. George Gore, an Irish baronet who visited the area in the 1850s on a notorious hunting expedition throughout the American West. Gore's three-year stopover in the American West had him traversing what is today the Dakotas, Montana, Wyoming and Colorado. The figures are difficult to substantiate, but Gore himself claimed to have killed more than 2,000 buffalo, 1,600 elk and deer and 100 bears for mere sport. The carcasses were left to rot.

More than sixty indigenous ethnic groups are often cited, although this number may be reduced to seven clusters of ethnic groups, by classifying small units together on the basis of their cultural and historical characteristics, which differ somewhat from one to the next. These may be further reduced to four major cultural regions ‚Äì the East Atlantic (primarily Akan), West Atlantic (primarily Kru), Voltaic, and Mand√© ‚Äì differentiated in terms of environment, economic activity, language, and overall cultural characteristics. In the southern half of the country, the East Atlantic and West Atlantic cultures, separated by the Bandama River, each make up almost one-third of the indigenous population. Roughly one-third of the indigenous population lives in the north, including Voltaic peoples in the northeast and Mand√© in the northwest. Events and festivals The F√™tes des Masques, (Festival of Masks) held in December in the region of Man is one of Ivory Coast's biggest and best-known festivals. Competitions between villages are held to find the best dancers, and to pay homage to the forest spirits embodied in the elaborate masks. Another important event is the week-long carnival in Bouak√© each March.http://www.africaguide.com/culture/events.htm In April, there is the F√™te du Dipri in Gomon, near Abidjan. This festival starts around midnight when naked women and children sneak out of their huts and carry out nocturnal rites to exorcize the village of evil spells. Before sunrise, the chief appears, drums pound and villagers go into trances. The frenzy continues until late afternoon of the next day. The primary Muslim holiday is Ramadan, a month when everyone fasts between sunrise and sunset, following the fourth pillar of Islam. Ramadan ends with a huge feast, Eid al-Fitr, where everyone prays together, visits friends, gives presents and stuffs oneself with food. Bouffe The traditional diet in Ivory Coast is very similar to that of neighboring countries in its reliance on grains and tubers, but Ivorians have a particular kind of small, open-air restaurant called a maquis that is unique to them. Atti√©k√© (grated cassava) is a popular Ivorian side dish. Maquis normally feature braised chicken and fish smothered in onions and tomatoes, served with atti√©k√©, or kedjenou, a chicken dish made with vegetables and a mild sauce. One of the tastiest street-vended foods is aloko, which is a ripe banana in palm oil, spiced with steamed onions and chili, and eaten alone or with grilled fish. Bangui is a local palm wine. Media =Television= Dr. Boris is an Ivorian sitcom broadcast since 2008. Music The traditional music style of many of the ethnic groups of Ivory Coast is characterized by a series of rhythms and melodies that occur simultaneously, without one dominating the other. Music is used in many aspects of the culture; the Dan celebrate rice, death, marriage, birth, and weather all with music. Instruments include the Talking drum, djembe, Kpalogo, Shekere (Youroo), Akombe, and cleavers, and are typically made with local materials, such as gourds, animal skins, and horns. In the past, music has been the main fort√© of one social group, the griot (village entertainers). Ivory Coast's Alpha Blondy, the world-famous reggae artist, is probably the country's best known singer, though his music is not necessarily representative. Masks are a prevalent art form in Ivory Coast. The variety and intricacy of masks created by the people of Ivory Coast is rivaled by none. Masks have many purposes. They are used mostly for representative reasons; they can symbolize lesser deities, the souls of the deceased, and even caricatures of animals. They are considered sacred and very dangerous; as such, only certain powerful individuals and families are permitted to own them, and only specially-trained individuals may wear the masks. It is held to be dangerous for others to wear ceremonial masks, because it is believed that each mask has a soul, or life force, and that when a person's face comes in contact with the inside of the mask, the person is transformed into the entity the mask represents. The Baoul√©, the Dan (or Yacouba) and the Senoufo are all known for their wooden carvings. Contemporary art is well developed in Ivory Coast. Some of the major artists are: * Ananias Leki Dago (photographer, 1970): Winner of the First Prize of PhotoAfrica context in Spain in 2009, and Distinction Award from the Critical Photography French Kodak Price in 2004 * Christian Lattier (sculptor, 1925‚Äì1978): Winner of the grand prize of \\"World Festival of Black Arts\\" in Dakar. 19 pieces of Lattier's sculptures are currently in the collection of the Mus√©e National de Ivory Coast in Abidjan. * Yacouba Konat√© (curator, writer, art critic, professor of philosophy, 1953): In 2000, he served as a Director of the National Institute of Arts and Culture, and as a Director of the Cabinet of Ministers of Culture and Francophony. He is also head of l'Institut national sup√©rieur des Arts et de l'action culturelle of Abidjan. He was one of the curators of individual exhibitions of 6th Dak'Art in 2004, and he was the Artistic Director of the Dakar Biennale in 2006. * Jems Robert Koko Bi (sculptor, 1966) * Ernest D√ºk√º (Painter, 1958): D√ºk√º is an artist who have engaged in dialogue with the rich systems of graphic inscription and writing of Africa but his result are highly individual, his work ask the cosmogonical world system, the spiritual systems; by using his training in architecture may explain the volume and dimensionality that situates his works somewhere between painting and sculpture. * Ouattara Watts (painter, 1957): Watts is an internationally recognized neo-expressionist painter. Watts is a jazz enthusiast, who merged music and art in paintings and collages, by using recycled everyday materials. * Paul Sika (fashion and advertising photographer/creative director/artist, 1985) * Mathilde Moreau (painter): Director of the Ecole Nationale des Beaux Arts in Abidjan * Sidiki Bakaba (actor, scenario writer, director, 1949): Awarded for his entire career in 2nd Pan-African Cultural Festival in Algiers in 2009, and Best Actor for West Africa by la Fondation des artistes de Ivory Coast (FONDACI) in 2008 * Fr√©d√©ric Bruly Bouabr√© (painter, 1923, 2013): Many of his paintings are in the collection of Jean Pigozzi Ethnic groups There are more than sixty ethnic groups in the Ivory Coast, the key ones being the Baoul√© in the center, the Agri in the east, the Senufo in the north, the Dioula in the northwest and west, the B√©t√© in the center-west and the Dan-Yacouba in the west. Other groups, such as the Akan and their sub-groups the Abron, Akye, Anye, and Aowin also make up a large part of the population. Each of these groups has their own history, economy, religion, & art, although each shares many things in common with the other groups of the Ivory Coast. Migrants from other West African countries account for up to 40% of the population, and this large population also adds to the culture and customs. =Akan= The Akan is the major cultural group of the Ivory Coast, with a population of approximately 8 million. The Bono, Baoule, the Akye, the Anye, the Asante and the Aowin are all Akan people. Among the Akan-speaking people of southern Ghana and adjacent Ivory Coast, ritual pottery and figurative terracottas are used in connection with funeral practices that date at least to the 17th century. Much of what we know about ancient Akan customs comes to us in the form of oral histories which have survived for several hundred years. Many of the objects that have been recovered through archaeological methods are still produced in modified form among Akan people today. The rise of the early Akan centralized state can be traced to the 11th century, which is the Bono state, and is likely related to the opening of trade routes established to move gold throughout the region. It was not until the end of the 17th century, however, that the grand Asante Kingdom emerged in the southern forest region of Ghana, when several small states united under the King of Kumasi in a move to achieve political freedom from the Denkyira. =Baule (Baoule)= The Baule people inhabit the Central Ivory Coast. Their population is approximately 4 million and the language is Baule (Akan cluster of Twi). Art The Baoule create art in several different media, including gold and brass casting (similar to their Asante ancestors), wooden sculptures, and mask and figure carving such as wooden masks. The mask is a primary art form in the Ivory Coast. Religion Ancestor worship and a hierarchy of nature gods make up the religious beliefs of the Baule. Alouroua is the creator god, and though other nature spirits and spouses are represented in sculpture, Alouroua is never physically manifested in art. History The Baule are a part of the Akan people who inhabit Ivory Coast and Ghana. The Baule migrated westward from Ghana when the Asante rose to power. This tale of their breakaway is preserved in their oral traditions. During the Asante rise to power, the Baule queen, Aura Poku, was competing directly with the Asante king. When she lost, she led the Baule away from Ghana and to the Central Ivory Coast. Aura Poku's descendant occupies the throne and palace she built, and is honored by the Baule as their nominal king. Economy Markets, run primarily by women, are the center of the Baule local economy. Yams and some maize are the primary crops. They also export cocoa and koala nuts, using exploited migrant laborers (mostly from Burkina Faso) on local plantations. Crops such as maize, peppers, sweet potatoes, peanuts, tomatoes, manioc, and squash were introduced from the Americas during the Atlantic slave trade. They raise farm animals, like sheep, goats, dogs, and chickens. Their craft items and local produce are sold along with imported goods all over the world. Political Systems The Baule government is highly centralized; there is a king or chief on top, who inherits his position, along with various subchiefs in charge of local populations. All rely on political advisors who aid in the making of decisions. The primary mask association, The Goli, provides social order among the Baule. =Akye= The Akye are an Akan people living in the southern Ivory Coast, with a population of about 55,000. They speak Akye (Akan cluster of Twi). Art Woodcarving, pottery, and weaving are all art forms of the Akye. The stools carved are seen as ‚Äúseats of power‚Äù and akuaba (wooden dolls) are associated with fertility. The traditions of pottery and weaving are extensive and long lasting throughout the Akan people. Woven on behalf of royalty, Kente cloth has come to symbolize African power all over the world. Economy Along the coast of the Ivory Coast, fishing is very important, as the depleted forests hold little promise for hunting. The markets are run mostly by women who as a result hold a large amount of economic power, while the men fish, hunt, and clear land. Both participate in agricultural tasks. Political Systems Royal membership among Akan is determined through connection to the land. Anyone who traces descent from a founding member of a village or town may be considered royal. Each family is responsible for maintaining political and social order within its confines. =Bono (Abron)= The Abron are an Akan people living in the Northeastern Ivory Coast and considered as the earliest or one of the earliest Akan settlers in Ivory Coast. With an estimated population of 400,000. They speak the Bono Twi of Akan. The Abron have a rich cultural heritage among the Akan. Religion The Akan believe in an ultimate God, who has various different names depending on the different regions of worship. At one point, according to Akan mythology, this God walked upon the earth with man, but moved high up into the sky after being continuously beaten with a pestle of an old woman pounding fufu. No priests serve him directly, and the general belief is that he may be contacted directly. Priests do, however, serve other spirits, acting as a conduit of the gods, a liaison between them and mankind. There are numerous other gods (abosom), usually connected to the natural world, like ocean and river spirits, as well as a variety of local spirits who receive their power from this supreme god. The earth itself is considered a deity, and a female one by the Abron called Asaase Yaa, directly connected to fertility and fruitfulness. Prayer is held daily, and includes offerings to ancestors and spirits. =Anye= The Anye people live in the Southeastern Ivory Coast, with a population of approximately 1000 000. They speak Anyi (Akan cluster of Twi). Art Funerary images and monuments hold special importance among the Anye people; artistic expression is focused on creating such art forms, for the more beautiful the monument is, the deeper the respect for the deceased. Through these types of grave monuments, dedicated to the ancestors, families can demonstrate their affluence and dedication at the same time. Official Dakon History A subgroup of the Akan, the Anyi people migrated to the Ivory Coast from Ghana between the 16th and 18th centuries. They were never quite as powerful as the Asante and Baule, and as a result were indirectly under their respective rules at the height of both empires. The Baule Empire that rose up from 1720 between the Bandama and the Comoe Rivers was the result of Family feud that arose between the then Queen Mother of Asante Nana Abenaa Pokua during the death of Nana Osei Tutu I and Her GrandNephew Nana Opoku Ware I who assassinated his Grand Uncle Nana Darko, the brother of Nana Abena Pokua. This incident brought about the civil war that engulfed the Asante Kingdom between 1717 and 1720 The incident split the Kingdom into two and the then united Oyoko-Dako Clan were also divided. The Oyokos who were the nephews of the Adakos, headed by Opoku Ware, kept control of Oyoko clan and the Golden Stool, whereas Nana Abena Pokua the QueenMother moved to Kaase (then Kwaman) with her partisans numbering about 3.5 million half the population of Asante moved and settled with the Anyi, Nzema and the Sanhwi to the west of Asante. Nana Opoku Ware was entooled as Asantehene and his mother Nana Nyarko Kusi Amoa, the niece of Nana Abena Pokua was also entooled as the Queen mother of Asante in 1720. Between 1720 and 1730 Nana Abena Pokua, faced with many obstacles, confronted life with determination, living among the Nzima/Anyi and Safwi, She adopted their language and even changed her name from Abena Pokuaa to Abla Poku thus delinking any ties with Asante. Nana Abla Pokou in order to cross the River Comoe to escape the partisans of Opoku Ware who were sent to return the partisans of Nana Pokou back into the Asante Kingdom, had to sacrifice her son to the River Comoe before they were able to cross the river with her partisans. After crossing the River Comoe Nana Abla Pokou and her various warrior Groups started to settle each to ts location. The Kyidom warriors (Akye) settled immediately after the river Comoe to guide the route to Asante. They kept the Golden UMBRELLA and the sword of Nana Osei Tutu. The Abbe (Torchbearers) also settled after the Akye and the Mbatto, Ebrie and all the other foot Soldiers settled in the regions that is today Akan land in Ivory Coast. In accordance to Akan tradition, after the consolidation of the new Kingdom, after meeting fierce resistance from the defeated former Lords of the Akan, the Denkyira; Nana Abena Pokua defeated them in war and subdued them and thereby established the Baule Kingdom. By 1730 Nana Abla Powas entooled as the First Reigning Queen of the New Akan Kingdom of Baule after the death of Nana Osei Tutu I. thereby with the stools of Obiri Yeboah and DENKYIRA UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE NEW KINGDOM, Nana Poukou established Baule Dakon Clan as the undisputed leader and Ruler of the Akans. Below are the Ruling Akan Rulers who ruled after the death of Nana Osei Tutu I, King of the Asantes and the Baules. Beretuo Dynasty 1717 to 1720 Amaniampon, the Mamponghene Regent, Mamponghene became regent due to the assassination of Nana Dako during the contest for the Succession to the throne after the death of King Osei Tutu the civil that ensued lasted for 3 years 1717‚Äì1720 that led to the migration of Nana Abena Pokua and the Adako Dynasty to Cote d‚Äôlvoire and the founding of the Baule Kingdom.

Economy Anyi agricultural economy revolves around banana and taro production. Yams are also an important staple crop in the region. Palm oil is also sold as a commodity at the international market. Political Systems The Anyi live in loose, spread out neighborhoods of family housing complexes, usually with a headman, directed by a Council of Elders who represents the town in regional politics. The Anyi, like other Akan people, have a highly stratified society including a hierarchical political administration made up of officials with rank and power. Since the Anyi are matrilineal, women have relatively high social status in both the political and economic areas. Religion Ancestors and ancestor worship are at the center of the Anyi's religious beliefs. One should always remember and honor one's ancestors, and strive to live life so that, in turn, as an ancestor one will be revered and remembered. In keeping with this system, when a person passes, there is an elaborate ceremony with ritual washing, dressing the dead in fine clothes and gold jewelry, and a mourning period allowing the family to show respect for departed and to allow a safe passage and welcome for the deceased into the spirit world. =Aowin= The Aowin people live in the Southern Ivory Coast and Southern Ghana. They have a population of about 40,000 people, and speak Aowin (Akan cluster of Twi). Their culture is very similar to the other Akan cultures in the area. =Dan= The Dan are a people who inhabit Liberia and the Ivory Coast. They have a population of about 35,000 and speak Dan (Mande). Art and music are enormous parts of Dan culture. The primary art form of the Dan is their masks, which emulate virtually every aspect of Dan society. Dan sculptors use masks to represent war, peace, social regulation, and entertainment. Mancala game boards and stylized wooden spoons are also made with wood carving. Religion The Dan world view holds that everything can be divided into two separate and clear categories. The primary dichotomy is between village and bush, in other words, things that have been controlled by man and things that have not. Crossing over the dividing line is dangerous business, and whenever it is done, whether to clear new fields or simply crossing the forest, the bush spirits must be appeased. In order to take part in village life, the bush spirits must take corporeal form. The Dan believe that all creatures have a spirit soul (du), which is imparted onto humans and animals from the creator god, Xra, through birth. One's du is immortal and is passed on after death to a new being. However, some du remain bodiless. They inhabit the forests as bush spirits and must establish a relationship with a person if they wish to be manifested and honored. Often the spirit will request the chosen person to dance the spirit, utilizing a mask to illustrate the spirit's embodiment. History Oral traditions describe the Dan society of the 19th century as lacking any central governing power. Social cohesion was fostered by a shared language and a preference for intermarriage. Generally, each village had a headman who had earned his position of advantage in the community through hard work in the fields and through luck as a hunter. They usually surrounded themselves with young warriors for protection from invading neighbors and exchanged gifts with other chiefs in order to heighten their own prestige. Out of this custom was born the basic tradition of tin among the Dan, which was based on displaying one's success in order to build a good reputation and name. Economy The tradition of tin is still an essential part of the Dan economy today. Young people strive to make a name for themselves by lavishly spending at community feasts to demonstrate their wealth. Although farming and hunting have been largely replaced by laboring in the diamond camps or working at the rubber plantations, the establishment of a hierarchical social order is still based on the individual's ability to succeed. Political Systems It has been only recently, through the creation of the leopard society (go), that a unifying political organization has emerged among the Dan. The secret political society centers around the powerful spirit go, who is responsible for peacemaking. Although the power of go seems to be increasing throughout Dan society, individual villages still maintain a high degree of political independence, and the economic power of the individual is still highly valued. =Senufo= The Senufo people inhabit northern Ivory Coast and Mali. They are also experts in making korhogo cloth. Art Much of the Senufo's sculpted work is made in the poro, or school. Brass sculptures, wood carvings, and masks are mostly made there, and sold to local artisans. They are expert mask makers, but since farming is the highest profession possible, artists and musicians are low in the caste system (musicians are bottom). History The Senufo are made up of a number of different groups who migrated south to Mali and the Ivory Coast in the 15th and 16th centuries. Religion The Senufo are a very animistic society; they believe that the ancestor spirits are responsible for all events that occur, and if they are not appeased through proper ritual they may cause drought, infertility, and illness. Political System/Economy The Senufo are known as excellent farmers, and are mainly a farming society. They live by a strict caste system, where the farmer is top and the musicians are at the bottom, everyone else filling in between. One of the highest possible honors given in the Senefo culture is the sambali (champion cultivator), who is respected throughout the region and in his old age is typically given a strong leadership role. Even for those who do not belong to the farmer caste, farming is huge in the Senefo culture. The society is very community centered; people often take turns working each other's lands, trading off and on. There is usually a group in each village made up of men from ages 15 to 35, who are in charge of working in the fields and providing a huge festival during the dry season. To make farming and chores fun, local games to see how fast a man can hoe a field are held. Another society for men is the poro, or school for young men, usually located in the forest. For Senefo women, the greatest ability is the ability to cook well; if a woman or girl cannot, it is a shame to the family. The women's society, sandogo, is responsible mainly for divination.

Origins The first Norsemen began settling in Iceland in AD 874. The oldest Scandinavian source mentioning the existence of the Papar, however, the √çslendingab√≥k (\\"Book of the Icelanders\\") by Icelandic chronicler Ari √ûorgilsson, was written between 1122 and 1133, some time after the event. √ûorgilsson writes of \\"Christian men\\", titled the 'Papar' by the Norsemen, who departed the isle because of their dislike of the 'heathen' Norse, pointing to the possibility of the Papar having arrived before the Norse. An earlier source that could possibly refer to the Papar is the work of Dicuil, an early 9th-century Irish monk and geographer, which included mention of the wandering of \\"holy men\\" to the lands of the north. However, it is not known whether Dicuil is speaking about Iceland, as Gaelic-Irish hermits also settled in other islands of the north such as Orkney and Shetland. Several Icelandic toponyms have been linked to the Papar, including the island of Papey and the Vestmannaeyjar (\\"islands of the Westmen\\"), but no archaeological evidence in these places has yet confirmed the link. Another theory is that the two sources were conflated and that √ûorgilsson based his history on the writings of Dicuil. The Landn√°mab√≥k (The Icelandic Book of Settlements), possibly dating from the 11th century in its original form, clearly states on page one that Irish monks had been living on Iceland before the arrival of Norse settlers. According to this account, the basis behind this knowledge was monks' leaving behind numerous reminders of their stay, including Irish books, bells and crosiers, helping the Norse to identify their predecessors. According to the Landn√°mab√≥k, the Irish monks left the island either when the Norse arrived or were no longer living there when the Norse arrived.  Papar in the Faroes  There are also several toponyms relating to the Papar in the Faroe Islands. Among these are Papar√∏kur near Vestmanna, and Papursh√≠lsur near Saksun. Vestmanna, in fact, is short for Vestmannah√∏vn, meaning the \\"harbour of the Westmen\\" (Gaels). A churchyard on the island of Sk√∫gvoy also has tombstones which display a possible Gaelic origin or influence.Schei, Liv Kj√∏rsvik & Moberg, Gunnie (2003) The Faroe Islands. Birlinn. Some of the sagas suggest that Gr√≠mr, a Norse explorer, may have been responsible for driving them out, despite probably being a Norse‚ÄìGael himself:  Papar in the Northern Isles  The 16th-century Historia Norwegi√¶ speculatively identifies the native Picts and Papar as those that the Norse discovered when they invaded Orkney in the early ninth century. Historian Joseph Anderson noted in his Introduction to Orkneyinga Saga several Island toponyms deriving from 'Papar', suggesting their influence upon the region:  Papar in the Hebrides  The Outer Hebrides have numerous Papar-influenced toponyms, but with the crucial difference that the Norse language died out early in this area and it is arguable whether Scottish Gaelic ever died out at all. There are at least three islands originally named Papey and renamed \\"Pabbay\\" () in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland: *Pabbay, Barra Isles *Pabbay, Harris *Pabay, the Inner Hebrides near Skye *Pabaigh, Loch Baghasdail, South Uist  See also  *Culdees in the North Atlantic *Gaelic Ireland *Great Ireland *Christianization of Scandinavia *Papa, Scotland References Further reading *Barbara E.

The desktop widgets are usually embedded directly into the background and do not disturb the normal view of the desktop. The use of SuperKaramba is not limited to KDE, but certain libraries from KDE are required. SuperKaramba had been included in KDE since version 3.5. SuperKaramba is similar to gDesklets for GNOME. The name derives from Portuguese and Spanish super caramba, meaning approximately \\"super wow\\" or \\"super cool\\" (caramba itself being a euphemism for carallo).

By the end of April 2003, Adam Geitgeyageitgey's profile KDE-Look.org took over maintenance of the project. He added python scripting support to karamba, which is where it took on a new name, SuperKaramba. Adam kept the project alive, added new features and applied patches from other developers until around April 2005. At that point, a group of developers who wanted to move SuperKaramba even further pushed to get it included in a KDE major release.

Background The exact dates of Dicuil's birth and death are unknown. Of his life nothing is known except that he probably belonged to one of the numerous Irish monasteries of the Frankish Kingdom, and became acquainted by personal observation with islands near England and Scotland. From 814 and 816 Dicuil taught in one of the schools of Louis the Pious, where he wrote an astronomical work, and in 825 a geographical work. Dicuil's reading was wide; he quotes from, or refers to, thirty Greek and Latin writers, including the classical Homer, Hecataeus, Herodotus, Thucydides, Virgil, Pliny and King Juba, the late classical Solinus, the patristic St Isidore and Orosius, and his contemporary the Irish poet Sedulius. In particular, he professes to utilize the alleged surveys of the Roman world executed by order of Julius Caesar, Augustus and Theodosius II. Based on similarities of style, it has been suggested that Dicuil may be the same person as the anonymous Hiberno- Latin poet and grammarian known as Hibernicus exul.

De mensura Orbis terrae Better known is the De mensura Orbis terrae, a summary of geography, giving concise information about various lands. This work was based upon a Mensuratio orbis prepared by order of Emperor Theodosius II (AD 435), a manuscript copy of which was possessed by the Carolingian court. Godescalc had already made use of this copy (781-783) for the composition of his celebrated Evangelistarium. Dicuil uses Pliny the Elder, Gaius Julius Solinus, Paulus Orosius, Isidore of Seville, and other authors, and adds the results of his own investigations. In the nine sections he treats successively of Europe, Asia, Africa, Egypt, and Ethiopia, the area of the Earth's surface, the five great rivers, certain islands, the length and breadth of the Tyrrhenian Sea, and the six (highest) mountains. Although mainly a compilation, this work is not without value. Dicuil is our only source for detailed information of the surveys performed by order of Theodosius II; his quotations, generally exact, are of service for the textual criticism of the authors mentioned; of great interest, too, are the few reports which he got from the travellers of his time; as, for instance, from the monk Fidelis who (possibly in 762 CE) journeyed along the canal then still existing, between the River Nile and the Red Sea; and from clerics who had visited the Faroe Islands and lived possibly in Iceland for six months during the summer of 795. Among their claims are the perpetual day at midsummer in \\"Thule,\\" where there was then \\"no darkness to hinder one from doing what one would.\\" They also described navigating the sea north of Iceland on their first arrival, and found it ice-free for one day's sail. Editions The geography manuscript was known to Marcus Welser, Isaac Vossius, Claudius Salmasius, Jean Hardouin, and Johann Daniel Sch√∂pflin; it was first printed with the title: \\"Dicuili Liber de mensura orbis terrae ex duobus codd. mss. bibliothecae imperialis nunc primum in lucem editus a Car.

It was released in the UK four days after his nineteenth birthday on 14 May 1965, through Pye Records (catalog number NPL 18117). Terry Kennedy, Peter Eden, and Geoff Stephens produced the album. The album was released in the US as Catch the Wind on Hickory Records in June 1965. Hickory Records changed the title to match that of Donovan's debut single.  History  In late 1964, Peter Eden and Geoff Stephens offered Donovan a recording contract with Pye Records in the UK. Donovan had performed around Britain and had become well known in British folk circles before his record contract. His 1964 demo tapes (released as Sixty Four in 2004) show a great resemblance to both Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan, which probably prompted the \\"British answer to Bob Dylan\\" press line that was subsequently released. What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid is notable because it captures Donovan at a point where his style and vision were starting to diverge significantly from those of Guthrie and Dylan. The music primarily consists of Donovan singing and playing mouth harp and acoustic guitar, much like his live performances of the time. He still had some vestiges of Woody Guthrie's style, and here covers Guthrie's \\"Riding In My Car\\" (titled here as \\"Car Car\\"). What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid also includes British folk (\\"Tangerine Puppet\\") and even some jazz (\\"Cuttin' Out\\"). Donovan re-recorded \\"Catch the Wind\\" for the album, which was initially released as his debut single in the UK on 12 March 1965. Other musicians featured on the album are Brian Locking on bass, Skip Alan (who joined the Pretty Things later the same year) on drums, and Gypsy Dave on kazoo.  Reissues  * On 13 September 1968, What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid was reissued in an edited form (Marble Arch Records MAL 795) in the UK. \\"Car Car\\" and \\"Donna Donna\\" were both removed from the album, possibly because they were not written by Donovan. * On 26 February 1996, Sequel Records reissued What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid in the US under its US title Catch the Wind on compact disc. Three bonus tracks were added to the track listing. The first bonus track, \\"Why Do You Treat Me Like You Do?\\", was released as the B-side to Donovan's UK debut single. The second bonus track is the A-side of Donovan's UK debut single. The third bonus track, \\"Every Man Has His Chain\\", was originally released on Donovan's Catch the Wind EP in France. * On 22 January 2002, Sanctuary Records reissued the complete What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid for the first time on compact disc. The US version of the CD titled Catch the Wind was released six years earlier. The CD features four bonus tracks. The first two tracks are Donovan's debut single \\"Catch the Wind\\" (a different take than the album track) and its b-side \\"Why Do You Treat Me Like You Do?\\". The third bonus track \\"Every Man Has His Chain\\" was once a rare track in Donovan's discography, and was originally released on the French EP Catch the Wind in 1965.

Although Blavet taught himself to play almost every instrument, he specialized in the bassoon and the flute which he held to the left, the opposite of how most flutists hold theirs today. Quantz wrote of Blavet: \\"His amiable disposition and engaging manner gives rise to a lasting friendship between us and I am much indebted to him for his numerous acts of kindness.\\" Life Born on March 13, 1700 in Besan√ßon as the son of wood turner Jean-Baptiste Blavet, (though one source says he was baptised, rather than born on March 13) a profession which he followed for some time, he accidentally became the possessor of a flute and soon became the finest player in France. Blavet was famous for maintaining impeccable intonation, even when he played in difficult keys, and for the beauty of his tone. Voltaire expressed his admiration for his playing and Marpurg spoke of him as a virtuoso of the highest excellence who preserved his innate modesty despite his unbroken popularity. In 1726 he joined the Duke of Carignan and took part in the newly formed Concert Spirituel for the first time. On 1 October 1728 Louis XV granted Blavet a privilege to publish flute sonatas for a period of six years, but by 1731 he had transferred to the service of Louis, Count of ClermontNeal Zaslaw, \\"Blavet, Michel\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001). and became his steward of music. In 1728 he published his first book of flute music, containing six sonatas for two flutes without bass. From 1731 to 1735, he performed at the Concert Spirituel with Jean-Marie Leclair, Jean-Pierre Guignon, Jean-Joseph de Mondonville, Jean- Baptiste Senaill√©, and Jacques Aubert. In 1738, Blavet became the principal flute in Louis XV's personal musical ensemble, the \\"Musique du Roi\\", and in 1740 at the Paris Opera orchestra. He played in the quartet (flute ‚Äì Blavet, violin ‚Äì Guignon, viola da gamba ‚Äì Forqueray the younger, cello ‚Äì √âdouard) that played the premiere performance of the Paris quartets by Telemann. Blavet turned down a post in Frederick the Great's court, which Quantz eventually accepted after the pay had been increased significantly. In 1752 Blavet modeled on Italian interludes the first French comic opera, Le Jaloux corrig√©. He also wrote a march for the Grande-Loge, having joined the Masons under the influence of the Comte de Clermont who was Grand Master of the Order in France. Blavet's three Recueils for two flutes are undated, but internal evidence suggests that they come from the early 1750s. The breathing marks (h, for haliene) indicated in the Recueils and his op. 2 remain an invaluable aid in understanding eighteenth-century French musical phrasing. He died in Paris in 1768. Musical works Blavet wrote primarily for the transverse flute, in the so-called 'Italian' as well as the French style.

The helen is thus used to measure quantities of beauty in terms of the theoretical action that could be accomplished by the wielder of such beauty. Origin Helen leaving for Troy with Paris, as depicted by Guido Reni The classic reference to Helen's beauty is Marlowe's lines from the 1592 play The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus, \\"Was this the face that launched a thousand ships / And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?\\" In the tradition of humorous pseudounits, then, 1 millihelen is the amount of beauty needed to launch a single ship. According to The Rebel Angels, a 1981 novel by Robertson Davies, this system was invented by Cambridge mathematician W.A.H. Rushton. In his 1992 collection of jokes and limericks, Isaac Asimov claimed to have invented the term in the 1940s as a graduate student. In a 1958 letter to the New Scientist, R.C. Winton proposes the millihelen as the amount of beauty required to launch one ship. In response, P. Lockwood noted that the unit had been independently proposed by Edgar J. Westbury and extended by the pair to negative values, where ‚àí1 millihelen was the amount of ugliness required to sink a battleship. Derived units The Catalogue of Ships from Book II of The Iliad, which describes in detail the commanders who came to fight for Helen and the ships they brought with them, details a total of 1,186 ships which came to fight the Trojan War. As such, Helen herself has a beauty rating of 1.186 helen, capable of launching more than one thousand ships. The \\"system\\" has been expanded by some writers, such as conceiving of negative values as measures of the ugliness required to beach a thousand ships. Writing a humorous article about the concept, David Goines considered a range of metric prefixes to the unit, ranging from the attohelen (ah) which could merely \\"light up a Lucky while strolling past a shipyard\\", to the terahelen (Th) able to \\"launch the equivalent of one quadrillion Greek warships and make serious inroads on the welfare of the galaxy\\". Theoretical physicist Thomas Fink defines beauty in The Man's Book both in terms of ships launched and in terms of the number of women, on average, than whom one woman will be more beautiful. He defines one helen (H) as the quantity of beauty to be more beautiful than 50 million women, the number of women estimated to have been alive in the 12th century BCE. Fink also defines a related, but smaller unit called a ‚Äúhelena‚Äù (Ha), based on a logarithmic scale, like the Richter scale, or decibels (dB). Ten helena (Ha) is the beauty sufficient for one oarsman (of which 50 are on a ship) to risk his life, or to be the most beautiful of a thousand women. Since the unit is logarithmic on a base of 2, for beauty to increase by 1 Ha, a woman must be the most beautiful of twice as many women, so one helen is equivalent to 25.6 Ha. The most beautiful woman who ever lived would score 34.2 Ha, the equivalent of 1.34 helen, the pick of a dozen women would be 3.6 Ha, or 0.14 helen.

It is the largest cemetery for Commonwealth forces in the world, for any war. The cemetery and its surrounding memorial are located outside Passchendale, near Zonnebeke in Belgium. Name The name \\"Tyne Cot\\" is said to come from the Northumberland Fusiliers, seeing a resemblance between the many German concrete pill boxes on this site and typical Tyneside workers' cottages (Tyne cots).Holt, T and V Major and Mrs Holt's Battlefield Guide to the Ypres Salient Barnsley:2003 Leo Cooper Pen and Sword ; p. 78 Tyne Cot CWGC Cemetery lies on a broad rise in the landscape which overlooks the surrounding countryside. As such, the location was strategically important to both sides fighting in the area. The concrete shelters which still stand in various parts of the cemetery were part of a fortified position of the German Flandern I Stellung, which played an important tactical role during the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917. Tyne Cot Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery The inscription on the cross built upon the largest of the three pillboxes reads: THIS WAS THE TYNE COT BLOCKHOUSE CAPTURED BY THE 3RD AUSTRALIAN DIVISION 4 October 1917 It originally read \\"2nd Division\\" until corrected in the 1990s. On 4 October 1917, the area where Tyne Cot CWGC Cemetery is now located was captured by the 3rd Australian Division and the New Zealand Division and two days later a cemetery for British and Canadian war dead was begun. The cemetery was recaptured by German forces on 13 April 1918 and was finally liberated by Belgian forces on 28 September. After the Armistice in November 1918, the cemetery was greatly enlarged from its original 343 graves by concentrating graves from the battlefields, smaller cemeteries nearby and from Langemark. The cemetery grounds were assigned to the United Kingdom in perpetuity by King Albert I of Belgium in recognition of the sacrifices made by the British Empire in the defence and liberation of Belgium during the war. The cemetery was designed by Sir Herbert Baker. The Cross of Sacrifice that marks many CWGC cemeteries was built on top of a German pill box in the centre of the cemetery, purportedly at the suggestion of King George V, who visited the cemetery in 1922 as it neared completion. The King's visit, described in the poem The King's Pilgrimage, included a speech in which he said: =Notable graves= The cemetery has several notable graves and memorials, including the grave of Private James Peter Robertson (1883‚Äì1917), a Canadian awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery in rushing a machine gun emplacement and rescuing two men from under heavy fire. He was killed saving the second of these men on 6 November 1917. Two Australian recipients of the Victoria Cross buried in the cemetery are Captain Clarence Smith Jeffries (1894‚Äì1917), and Sergeant Lewis McGee (1888‚Äì1917). Jeffries led an assault party and rushed one of the strong points at the First Battle of Passchendaele on 12 October 1917, capturing four machine guns and thirty five prisoners, before running his company forward again. He was planning another attack when he was killed by an enemy gunner. On the same day, McGee, who had earned his decoration eight days earlier at Broodseinde, was killed charging an enemy pillbox in the same battle. Also at Tyne Cot, behind the Cross of Sacrifice which was constructed on top of an old German pillbox in the middle of the cemetery, there are 4 German graves, buried alongside Commonwealth graves. These graves are of men that were treated here after the battle, when the pillbox underneath the main cross was used as a dressing station for wounded men. Tyne Cot Memorial to the Missing The walls forming the memorial in the background, with one of the rotundas The stone wall surrounding the cemetery makes-up the Tyne Cot Memorial to the Missing, one of several Commonwealth War Graves Commission Memorials to the Missing along the Western Front. The UK missing lost in the Ypres Salient are commemorated at the Menin Gate memorial to the missing in Ypres and the Tyne Cot Memorial. Upon completion of the Menin Gate, builders discovered it was not large enough to contain all the names as originally planned.(Holt, p29) They selected an arbitrary cut-off date of 15 August 1917 and the names of the UK missing after this date were inscribed on the Tyne Cot memorial instead.(Holt, p125) Additionally, the New Zealand contingent of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission declined to have its missing soldiers names listed on the main memorials, choosing instead to have names listed on its own memorials near the appropriate battles. Tyne Cot was chosen as one of these locations.(Holt, p28) Unlike the other New Zealand memorials to its missing, the Tyne Cot New Zealand memorial to the missing is integrated within the larger Tyne Cot memorial, forming a central apse in the main memorial wall. The inscription reads: \\"Here are recorded the names of officers and men of New Zealand who fell in the Battle of Broodseinde and the First Battle of Passchendaele October 1917 and whose graves are known only unto God\\". The memorial contains the names of 33,783 soldiers of the UK forces, plus a further 1,176 New Zealanders. Three British Army Victoria Cross recipients are commemorated here: * Lieutenant Colonel Philip Bent (1891‚Äì1917) * Corporal William Clamp (1891‚Äì1917) * Lance Corporal Ernest Seaman (1893‚Äì1918) Other notable persons commemorated include: *Lieutenant Allan Ivo Steel, English first-class cricketer. *Lieutenant David (Dai) Westacott, Welsh rugby international. *Lieutenant Denis Bertram Sydney Buxton, son of Sydney Buxton, 1st Earl Buxton, a radical Liberal Party (UK) politician and Governor-General of South Africa. It was designed by Sir Herbert Baker, with sculptures by Joseph Armitage and Ferdinand Victor Blundstone, who also sculpted part of the Newfoundland National War Memorial. The memorial was unveiled on 20 June 1927 by Sir Gilbert Dyett.Tyne Cot Memorial, Commonwealth War Graves Commission, accessed 7 February 2010 Gallery Image:Tyne cot.jpgGraves at Tyne Cot Cemetery Image:View from top of Tyne Cot.JPGView towards entrance of cemetery Image:Tyne Cot Cemetery 2 .jpgTyne Cot Cemetery with \\"Cross of Sacrifice\\" on the far right Image:Tyne_Cot_Cross_3633.jpgTyne Cot \\"Cross of Sacrifice\\" File:Tyne Cot Cemetery gravestones.jpg Image:Dfr bel cem back.JPG File:Tyne cot german graves 01.jpgA single marker for two of the four German graves at Tyne Cot.

Seppala introduced the work dogs used by Native Siberians at the time to the American public; the breed came to be known as the Siberian Husky in the English-speaking world. The Leonhard Seppala Humanitarian Award, which honors excellence in sled dog care, is named in honour of him.Leonhard Seppala (Balto's True Story) Background Seppala was born in the Lyngen, Troms og Finnmark, Northern Norway.U.S. Passport Applications, 1795‚Äì1925U.S., World War II Draft Registration Cards, 1942 He was the eldest child of Isak Isaksen Sepp√§l√§ (born in Sweden of Finnish descent) and Anne Henrikke Henriksdatter.Norway, Select Baptisms, 1634‚Äì1927 His father's family name is of Finnish origin.1891 Norway Census When Seppala was two years old, his family moved within Troms county to nearby Skjerv√∏y municipality on the island of Skjerv√∏ya. While in Skjerv√∏y, his father worked as a blacksmith and fisherman, building up a relatively large estate. Seppala initially followed in his father's footsteps as both a blacksmith and a fisherman. However, in 1900, he emigrated to Alaska during the Nome gold rush. His friend Jafet Lindeberg had returned from Alaska and convinced Seppala to come to work for his mining company in Nome. He became a naturalized citizen prior to 1917.U.S., World War I Draft Registration Cards, 1917‚Äì1918 During his first winter in Alaska, Seppala became a dogsled driver for Lindeberg's company. He enjoyed the task from his first run, which he recalled clearly for the rest of his life. He expressed pleasure in the rhythmic patter of the dogs' feet and the feeling of the sled gliding along the snow. While most drivers considered a long run, Seppala travelled between and most days. This also meant he worked as long as 12 hours a day. He kept his dogs in form during the summer by having them pull a cart on wheels instead of a sled. It was unusual at that time to keep sled dogs working when the snow thawed, or to spend as much time with them as he did. Racing career In 1913, Seppala inherited his first team of sled dogs by chance. Lindeberg, his friend and supervisor at Pioneer Mining Company, had brought the puppies from Siberia as a gift for the explorer Roald Amundsen, whom he hoped would use them for his upcoming expedition to the North Pole. Seppala was assigned to train the dogs. \\"I literally fell in love with them from the start\\", he recalled; \\"I could hardly wait for sledding snow to start their training\\". When Amundsen cancelled his trip a few weeks after the puppies arrived in Nome, Lindeberg gave them to Seppala. Seppala made the decision to compete in his first race, the 1914 All Alaska Sweepstakes, at the last minute. Neither he nor his canine freight leader, Suggen, knew the dangerous trail, and when a blizzard suddenly descended on the area during the race, Seppala realized his young dogs had lost the trail and they were all at great risk of death due to the nearby drop-off to the Bering Sea. Indeed, when the whiteout conditions suddenly lifted, Seppala found that he and his team were at the bottom of a hill, racing towards the cliffs along the sea. Fortunately, he succeeded in stopping 20 feet from the drop-off, saving all their lives. However, many of his dogs' paw pads had been shredded and claws broken by the ice-encrusted snow as they clawed their way back to the top of the hill. A few also suffered frostbite. Seppala felt he had abused the dogs' loyalty by putting them in danger of death and injury, and withdrew from the race in shame. He nursed them back to health for most of the remainder of that year; they were not ready to train again until autumn. Seppala's racing career took off the following year, at the 1915 All Alaska Sweepstakes. After a close competition between him and experienced musher Scotty Allan, Seppala defeated him on the fourth day of the race and finished two hours ahead of Allan to win the Sweepstakes.Photo: Winners of the Eighth All Alaska Sweepstakes from Alaska's Digital Archives He went on to win the race the following two years, as well, at which point the All Alaska Sweepstakes was suspended until 1983. Role in the \\"Serum Run\\" of 1925 Plaque on the Leonhard Seppala monument in his hometown of Skibotn, Norway A diphtheria outbreak struck Seppala's town of Nome, Alaska in the winter of 1925. Previously unexposed children as well as adults were at risk of dying from the infection. Seppala's only child‚Äîan eight-year-old daughter named Sigrid‚Äîwas also at risk. The only treatment available in 1925 was diphtheria antitoxin serum. However, the town's supply was not only insufficient but also of presumably low efficacy, being past its expiry date. The only practical way to deliver more serum to Nome in the middle of the coldest winter in 20 years was by dog sled. A relay of respected mushers was organized to expedite the delivery, and Seppala (with lead dog Togo) was chosen for the most forbidding part of the trail. The serum was to be taken by train to Nenana, and from there relay teams would set out from Nome and Nenana, meeting in the middle at Nulato. The whole trail was 674 miles from Nenana to Nome, and Seppala was initially selected to cover the more than 400 miles from Nome to Nulato and back. Seppala's section of trail featured a dangerous shortcut across Norton Sound, which could save a full day of travel. It was decided that he was the most qualified of the relay mushers to attempt this shortcut. The ice on Norton Sound was in constant motion due to currents from the sea and the incessant wind. It ranged from rough hills of smashed- together ice to slippery \\"glare ice\\" polished by the wind, where it was difficult for the dogs to get a foothold. Small cracks in the ice could suddenly widen, and driver and team could be plunged into the freezing water. If the wind blew from the east, it could reach speeds as high as , flipping over sleds, pushing dogs off course, and causing a windchill as low as . A sustained east wind could also push the ice out to sea, and a team caught on a drifting floe could find itself stranded on open water. Seppala had taken the shortcut across the Sound several times in his career; a less-experienced musher was likelier to lose not only his life and the lives of his dogs, but also the urgently needed serum. Seppala would cross the sound each way in the race to deliver the serum. Seppala set out from Nome on January 28‚Äîseveral days before he was due to meet the relay coming to Nulato. He crossed Norton Sound without incident. Meanwhile, the number of diphtheria cases in Nome continued to climb. To hasten delivery of the serum, more mushers were added to the relay. However, it was too late to inform Seppala that he would be meeting the relay closer to Nome than had originally been planned. After 3 days and , he came in sight of another relay musher, Henry Ivanoff, but did not realise it. Seppala saw the musher stopped on the trail and having trouble with his dogs, but did not intend to stop and be delayed. Ivanoff had to run after Seppala as he raced past, shouting, \\"The serum! The serum! I have it here!\\". When the serum passed to Seppala, night was falling and a powerful low-pressure system was moving towards the trail from the Gulf of Alaska. Seppala had to decide whether to risk Norton Sound in high winds in the dark, when he could not see or hear potential warning signs from the ice. However, as going around the ice meant slowing the delivery of the serum by a full day, he chose to go across. While he raced to the roadhouse at Isaac's Point on the opposite shore, gale-force winds drove the windchill to an estimated . When he arrived there at 8 pm, his dogs were exhausted; they had run that day, much of it against the wind and in brutal cold. However, they could only afford a short rest, and set out again at 2 am. The next day, the gale had intensified into a severe blizzard, with blinding snow and winds of at least . Seppala continued the trail across Norton Sound. This meant avoiding rocky cliffs along the shore, but it also exposed him and his team to the dangers of the Sound. Conditions on the ice were perilous, with sudden soft spots in the ice underfoot and outright open water sometimes only a few feet away. Only a few hours after they had crossed it, the ice broke up altogether and drifted out to sea. With Norton Sound behind them, Seppala and his team now faced the final challenge of the trail‚Äîclimbing an ridge formation that led to the summit of Little McKinley. The trail here was exposed and the steep grade grueling for the dogs, who were sleep-deprived and had already raced over the previous 4.5 days. However, at 3 P.M. that day, Seppala and his team arrived at Golovin and handed over the serum to the next musher. The serum was now only from Nome. Indeed, it arrived there the next day, Monday, February 2, at approximately 5:30 A.M., and was thawed and ready for use by 11 am. This emergency delivery, also known as the \\"Great Race of Mercy\\", is commemorated annually with the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.The Last Great Race on Earth (Iditarod Trail Committee, Inc.) After the Serum Run After the Serum Run, Seppala and some 40 of his dogs toured the \\"lower 48\\" with an Eskimo handler. His tour ended in January 1927 with the dogsled race at Poland Spring, Maine, where he accepted the challenge to race against Arthur Walden, founder of the New England Sled Dog Club and owner of the famous lead dog, \\"Chinook.\\" Despite a series of time-consuming mishaps on the trail, Seppala won the race against the bigger, slower dogs driven by Walden and his followers. The enthusiasm for sled dog racing in New England together with the Serum Run publicity and the victory over Walden made it possible for Seppala and partner Elizabeth Ricker to establish a Siberian kennel at Poland Spring. This was the start of the spread of the Siberian Husky breed in the United States and Canada. He bred Togo, and the dogs descendants are known as the \\"Seppala Siberian Sleddog\\" line of huskies, a sought after sled dog line. A team of 10 Seppala Siberian Sleddogs in the Yukon in 1994 In 1928, Seppala moved his permanent home to near Fairbanks, Alaska. In 1931 the Seppala‚ÄìRicker partnership ended. Sled dog racing was a demonstration event at the Lake Placid Winter Olympic Games in 1932, where Seppala earned a silver in the event. In 1946, he and his wife Constance moved to Seattle, Washington. In 1961, Seppala revisited Fairbanks and other places in Alaska at the invitation of American journalist Lowell Thomas, enjoying a warm reception from the Alaskan people. He and his wife lived in Seattle until his death at the age of 89. His wife, Constance, died a few years later aged 85. Both are buried in Nome, Alaska. They were survived by their daughter, Sigrid Hanks. A street in Nome named Seppala Drive connects the town to its airport. Alaska Airlines has established the Leonhard Seppala Humanitarian Award. In June 1999, a memorial was erected to him in Skibotn. In 2019, Disney released a movie based on Seppala's feats in the 1925 serum run to Nome, titled Togo and starring Willem Dafoe as Seppala.

Its capital, Black River, is located at the mouth of the Black River, the widest on the island. History Saint Elizabeth originally included most of the southwest part of the island, but Westmoreland was taken from it in 1703, and in 1814 a part of Manchester. The resulting areas were named after the wife of Sir Thomas Modyford, the first English Governor of Jamaica. There are archeological traces of Ta√≠no/Arawak existence in the parish, as well as of 17th-century colonial Spanish settlements. After 1655, when the English settled on the island, they concentrated on developing large sugar cane plantations with enslaved African workers. Today, buildings with 'Spanish wall' construction (masonry of limestone sand and stone between wooden frames) can still be seen in some areas. St Elizabeth became a prosperous parish, and Black River an important seaport. In addition to shipping sugar and molasses, Black River became the centre of the logging trade. Large quantities of logwood were exported to Europe to make a blue dye very like Prussian blue, which was very popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. St Elizabeth was the first parish to have electric power, where it was first introduced in a house called Waterloo in Black River in 1893. Geography The parish is located at latitude 18¬∞15'N, and longitude 77¬∞56'W; to the west of Manchester, to the east of Westmoreland, and to the south of St. James and Trelawny. It covers an area of 1212.4 km¬≤, making it Jamaica's second-largest parish, smaller only than Saint Ann's 1212.6 km¬≤. The parish is divided into four electoral districts (constituencies), that is North-East, North-West, South-East and South-West. Lovers' Leap, Saint Elizabeth The northern and northeastern parts of the parish are mountainous. There are three mountain ranges --the Nassau Mountains to the north-east, the Lacovia Mountains to the west of the Nassau Mountains, and the Santa Cruz Mountains which, running south, divide the wide plain to end in a precipitous drop of at Lovers' Leap. The central and southern sections form an extensive plain divided by the Santa Cruz Mountains. A large part of the lowlands is covered by morass, but it still provides grazing land for horses and mules. The main river in the parish is the Black River, and measuring , it is one of the longest rivers in Jamaica. It is navigable for about , and is supported by many tributaries including Y.S., Broad, Grass and Horse Savannah. The river has its source in the mountains of Manchester where it rises and flows west as the border between Manchester and Trelawny then goes underground. It reappears briefly in several surrounding towns, but reemerges near Balaclava and tumbles down gorges to the plain known as the Savannah, through the Great Morass and to the sea at Black River, the capital of the parish. The geology of the parish is primarily alluvial plains to the south, and karstic limestone to the north. The karstic zones are known to contain over 130 caves (Jamaica Cave Register as of 2007 - from Fincham and JCO). These include Mexico Cave and Wallingford River Cave, near Balaclava, which are two associated sections of a major underground river that has its source in south Trelawny, as well as Yardley Chase Caves near the foot of Lovers' Leap, and Peru Cave, near Goshen, which has stalactites and stalagmites. Mineral deposits include bauxite, antimony, white limestone, clay, peat and silica sand which is used to manufacture glass. =Demography= The parish had an estimated population of 148,000 in 2001, 4000 of whom live in the capital town. The distinct feature of this parish is that numerous ethnic groups can be found here; St Elizabeth probably has the greatest ethnic mixture in Jamaica. St. Elizabeth provides the best testimony of the Jamaican motto ‚Äì \\"Out of many, one people\\". The Meskito (corrupted to ‚ÄòMosquito‚Äô) Indians brought to Jamaica to help capture the Maroons, were allowed to settle in southern St. Elizabeth in return for their assistance and given land grants in this parish. This parish has also attracted Dutch, Spanish, Indian, Maroon, mulatto, English, and European inhabitants from the 17th century onwards, with the result that many observers feel that it has more people of mixed-race ancestry than can be found in any other part of the island. In the 19th century Irish, Spanish, Portuguese, Scottish, Germans, Chinese, and East Indians migrated to Saint Elizabeth. There are pockets of ethnic concentrations in the parish, including Mulatto and Creole, notably found in the southeast. Economy =Mining= The parish has been a major producer of bauxite since the 1960s. Port Kaiser, near a town called Alligator Pond, has a leading deep-water pier for bauxite export. The Alpart alumina refinery was constructed in the 1960s at Nain and produces nearly 2 million tonnes of alumina annually for export. The replacement cost of building the refinery is approximately $2 billion. There are other alumina refineries close to the nearby town of Mandeville. =Agriculture= Apart from bauxite mining, the parish also produces a large quantity of Jamaica's sugar; there are two sugar factories in the parish. Fishing is a major industry in the parish, as is tomato canning; a plant is at Bull Savannah. The parish also cultivates crops such as cassava, corn, peas, beans, pimento, ginger, tobacco, tomato, rice sweet potatoes and coffee. As a result of the fertile soil that provide for grazing fields, pastoralism is possible. Livestock include goats, sheep, hogs, and cattle, horses. =Tourism= Since the 1990s, the parish has become a significant tourist destination, with most visitors going to the Treasure Beach area. The Appleton rum distillery, near the rough Cockpit Country in the north of the parish, is also a tourist destination. The Cockpit area was the site of Maroon settlements through much of the 18th century. Ecological tourism along the Black and YS rivers, and in the Great Morass, has been developed in recent years. Education The parish has 12 high schools and 75 primary level institutions as well as 167 early childhood institutions. Notable institutions include: * Bethlehem Moravian College * Black River High School * Hampton School * Lacovia High School * Munro College * St. Elizabeth Technical High School Places =Beaches= * Font Hill Beach * Galleon, Crane * Fullerswood * Parottee * Fort Charles * Calabash Bay * Great Bay * Billy's Bay * Frenchman's Bay * Treasure Beach * Blue Fields Beach =Towns and villages= The Social Development Commission's national grid of communities has sixty one communities in St. Elizabeth broken down into 465 districts. The communities which include major towns are: Flagaman =Caves= St. Elizabeth has approximately 44 caves, including: * Mexico * Peru Cave * Yhardly Chase Caves * Wallingford Caves * Nain =Other Places of Interest= * Lover's Leap is a cliff plunging several hundred metres into the sea, with an attached romantic legend of two young slaves jumping to their death rather than live apart.https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Atrium/5460/Introduction/About_Lover_s_Leap/about_lover_s_leap.html&date;=2009-10-25+09:58:25 There is a lighthouse here too. * Y.S.

Corral was a skilled, affluent lawyer, but he left his legal practice to join Clemente Dom√≠nguez y G√≥mez, who founded the Carmelite Order of the Holy Face in 1975. Corral was ordained priest and bishop by Catholic Archbishop Pierre Martin Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c in 1976 along with Dom√≠nguez and three others (these three others had already been Catholic priests for many years). Archbishop Thuc and the five new bishops were excommunicated by Pope Paul VI for consecrating bishops without the Holy See's approval. Thuc recanted and repudiated his consecrations for the Palmar-based Carmelite Order of the Holy Face. He asked Pope Paul VI to be forgiven and was absolved of all ecclesial penalties in 1976, until 1981 when he was again excommunicated by Pope John Paul II for illicit consecrations. In 1978, Dom√≠nguez claimed that Jesus Christ created him pope in 1978 in a mystical vision and transformed the Order into the Palmarian Catholic Church. Dom√≠nguez, now called Pope Gregory XVII, named Corral Cardinal Secretary of State of their church and named him his successor in 2000. This appointment ‚Äì instead of leaving this decision to a Palmarian College of Cardinals ‚Äì contributed to a rift in the church.

The CVA advocates vegetarianism from a biblically-based, Christian perspective and sees dietary choice as a valid way to bear witness to Christ's ministry of love, peace, mercy and compassion, and prepare for the Peaceable Kingdom as foretold in the Bible. Overview The CVA encourages Christians to reduce or eliminate animal products as part of their Christian calling to be good stewards of God's Creation. According to their website, the CVA is \\"an international, non- denominational ministry of believers dedicated to respectfully promoting healthy, Christ-centered and God-honoring living among Christians.\\" The CVA promotes the ethical, environmental and health benefits of plant-based diets. They assert that there is a connection between animal-based diets and world hunger, ecological damage, animal mistreatment and human disease. The CVA's stated mission is: #To support and encourage Christian vegetarians around the world. #To share with non-vegetarian Christians how a vegetarian diet can be a powerful and faith-strengthening witness to Christ's love, compassion, and peace. #To show the world that plant-based diets represent good, responsible Christian stewardship for all God's Creation. According to Samantha Jane Calvert, organizations such as the CVA serve to address animal welfare and vegetarian concerns among Christians who find that \\"mainstream Christian Churches have little to say on the subject of vegetarianism.\\" As of 2012, the CVA had approximately 6,000 members. The CVA's growth is a manifestation of increasing concern for animal well-being among Christians. History The Christian Vegetarian Association (CVA) was founded in 1999 by Nathan Braun and Stephen H. Webb, Professor of Religion at Wabash College. Braun organized a board of respected professors, theologians, and activists representing a broad range of backgrounds and perspectives. Evidently resonating with many Christians who see their vegetarian diets as reflections of their faith, the organization quickly grew.Aren Roukema. Toward a vegetarian Christendom. In 2000, the CVA produced its first edition of What Would Jesus Eat‚Ä¶Today? which has an annual distribution rate of approximately 250,000 and been translated into several languages. In 2002, CVA founder Nathan Braun and co-chairman Stephen R. Kaufman, M.D. published the first edition of Good News for All Creation: Vegetarianism as Christian Stewardship (2002: Vegetarian Advocates Press) and a revised, second version two years later (2004: Vegetarian Advocates Press).

The work was subsequently enlarged and issued (1828‚Äì29) in four volumes entitled: Godefridus, Tancredus, Morus and Orlandus. Digby's exposure to Walter Scott's Ivanhoe novels as a youth encouraged him to romanticize the Middle Ages. Broad-Stone contributed to the Young England movement‚Äôs feudalist ideology and influenced many of Digby's Cambridge contemporaries. The book inculcated readers with ideas of chivalry and staunch Catholicism and stressed the importance of the heart‚Äôs knowledge over intellectual learning by presenting historical figures as role models. Digby's revival of medieval principles helped young men of his day construct their idea of what being a \\"gentleman\\" means. Born at Clonfert, he was 15 when his father died in 1812. He moved to England to attend Petersham High School near London. From 1816 to 1819, he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where some members of the university advocated reform and even republicanism; Digby, however, favoured a strong monarchy, the Church, and chivalry. At Cambridge, he read Tennyson and Hallam; his close friends there were George Darby, Julius Hare, William Whewell, and Adam Sedgwick. In summer, he traveled across Europe sketching old castles and writing. Ehrenbreitstein, a massive mediaeval fortress in Germany, gave him the title The Broad-Stone of Honour. He published the book in a single volume in 1822, and the beliefs he explored while writing it seem to have contributed to his conversion to Catholicism in 1825. After that, he rewrote and expanded the one volume into four, published in 1828-29: Godfridus, containing a general introduction (named after Godfrey of Boulogne, a Crusade hero); Tancredus, discussing chivalry‚Äôs discipline and applauding Christianity (for Tancred of Hauteville, another Crusade hero); Morus, bashing the Reformation as the death of chivalry and religion (after Sir Thomas More); and Orlandus, which detailed Digby‚Äôs idea of chivalric behaviour (after Ariosto‚Äôs Orlando Furioso).

The school is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference. The official Visitor to the school is Prince Michael of Kent. History Colfe's is one of the oldest schools in London. The parish priest of Lewisham taught the local children from the time of Richard Walker's chantry, founded in 1494, until the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII. Rev. John Glyn re-established the school in 1568 and it was granted a Charter by Elizabeth I in 1574. Abraham Colfe became a Governor in 1613 and the school was re-founded bearing his name in 1652. Colfe declared that the aim of the school was to provide an education for the boys from \\"the Hundred of Blackheath\\". He invited the Leathersellers' Company, one of London's livery companies, to be the trustee of his will. Links between the school and the Leathersellers remain strong. The school was originally built around Colfe's house with an entrance in Lewisham Hill. The site was progressively developed and extended until 1890, when it was completely rebuilt on the same site with its entrance now in Granville Park. During the Second World War the school was first evacuated to Tunbridge Wells, Kent, and then to Frome in Somerset. A period of inactivity on the Western front led about 100 boys to return to London, so the school was split for a few years. In 1944 a V2 (Flying bomb) almost totally destroyed the school. At the end of the War, with no school buildings and the pupil roll having halved, it was uncertain if the school would continue. In London the school was split between two sites ‚Äì Beacon Road School in Hither Green and Ennersdale Road School, about a quarter of a mile away. \\"Temporary\\" buildings (rows of pre-fabricated concrete construction) were erected and the school came together again in 1947 under the headmastership of Herbert Beardwood MSc. The \\"temporary\\" buildings were still being used until the move to the new site in 1963. Herbert Beardwood updated Leland Duncan's \\"History of Colfe's Grammar School\\" in 1952, in celebration of the school's tercentenary under Colfe's name. The book was further updated by Beardwood in 1972, to reflect both the move to the present campus at the east end of the playing fields, and the impact on the school of the machinations of early 1970s UK politics. The school moved to its current site in 1963 and since then there has been much change: improved facilities have been provided, such as an all-weather sports pitch, a performing arts centre, and new classroom facilities. The Leathersellers' sports ground has been renovated to make it the home of senior sport (rugby, football and cricket). Having been a voluntary aided grammar school, Colfe's became independent again in 1977. Although founded as a school for boys, girls have been admitted to the Sixth Form for over thirty years. In 1997, it was decided to allow girls throughout the school, and today the school is fully co- educational. Current organisation The School admits pupils at the age of 3 into the Nursery, from which they progress to the Junior School aged 4. From here pupils make the transition to the Senior school at the age of 11. =Senior School (Ages 1118)= The Senior School is based at the top of the main school site. An all-weather playing field (funded in part by donations from parents and former pupils) was opened in 2006. The school also has a Performing arts centre, a Sports Complex complete with a 25 m swimming pool, 2 gyms and a Sports Hall, IT and Music facilities and over of playing fields. Many of the facilities are shared with the Junior School. Opened in September 2015 the new Stuart building now houses the Maths and RP departments and the sixth form area. There is a caf√© and a sixth form common room. There is a House system at Colfe's. The Houses are named after four long serving Headmasters; Beardwood, Bramley, Norton and Prendergast. Throughout the school year each pupil takes part in a full and varied programme of activities outside the main curriculum, in which the pupils participate in healthy competition by age groups to help his or her house win at the end of the year. From September 2012, Colfe's has also introduced tutoring in Houses. Pupils are in mixed age tutor groups with other students from the same House. A team of House tutors is led by a Head of House who has oversight of pastoral and academic progress of the students in their House. =Junior School (Ages 311)= The Junior School is located at the bottom of the school site, in two self-contained buildings. One of the buildings is for EYFS and KS1 and the other for KS2. The Junior School has the same high standards as the Senior School and also shares many of the facilities including the sports complex, the fields and the Performing Arts Centre.

Upon his retirement in April 2018, Sorrell was the longest-serving chief executive of a FTSE 100 company. He is also known for being consistently one of the UK's highest-paid corporate executives. According to The Sunday Times Rich List in 2019, Sorrell is worth ¬£368 million. Sorrell has served on boards and advisory bodies of a number of high-profile public, academic and business organisations, including several leading business schools, both in the UK and internationally. Early life and education Martin Stuart Sorrell was born in London on 14 February 1945 to a Jewish family: his father was an electronics retailer, whose ancestors came from Russia, Poland and Romania. He was educated at the independent Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, then studied Economics at Christ's College, Cambridge, and gained an MBA from Harvard University in 1968. Career =Early career= Sorrell joined Glendinning Associates, then James Gulliver and then worked for the sports agent Mark McCormack. He joined Saatchi & Saatchi in 1975, and was group finance director from 1977 until 1984. Often referred to as \\"the third brother\\", he designed and carried out many of Saatchi's agency acquisitions. Sorrell undertook this by refining the practice of the ‚Äòearn-out‚Äô. =WPP= In 1985, Sorrell privately invested in Wire and Plastic Products, a British wire shopping basket manufacturer, and joined it full-time as chief executive in 1986. He began to acquire \\"below-the-line\\" advertising-related companies, purchasing 18 in three years, including in 1987 when he stunned the agency world with a $566 million hostile takeover of J. Walter Thompson. Sorrell followed this in 1989 with another dramatic hostile $825 million buy of Ogilvy and Mather. Group chairman David Ogilvy publicly referred to Sorrell as an \\"odious little shit\\". Since 2000, WPP also acquired two more integrated, global agency networks, Young & Rubicam and Grey. In 2014, Sorrell received total compensation from WPP of GBP ¬£40 million, his largest annual total since ¬£53 million in 2004. In August 2017, Sorrel said that \\"digital disruption\\" was forcing companies to change their business models and reach customers in different ways when shares in WPP fell by more than 10% at the start of trading after the advertising giant reported slowing sales and warned about future growth. In September 2017, Sorrell criticised the marketing industry, arguing it is \\"too competitive\\" and that agencies value winning contracts, whether they are profitable or not, over content since making the headlines in a trade magazine is more important. In 2017, Sorrell became the longest-serving CEO of any company featured in the U.K.'s benchmark FTSE 100 Index ‚Äì having stewarded WPP since 1985. Sorrell left WPP in 2018. =S4 Capital= In May 2018, Sorrell acquired Derriston Capital, a cash shell listed on the London Stock Exchange, with plans to create a marketing company called S4 Capital. Sorrell invested $53 million of his money, and raised $15 million more from investors. In July 2018, S4 Capital purchased MediaMonks for $350 million, using a share issue to fund the purchase. Sorrells previous employer, WPP, claimed that he was using confidential information by pursuing the deal. In December 2018, S4 Capital purchased MightyHive for $150 million. In June 2019, S4 Capital acquired the Melbourne company BizTech. By this point, the company had 1,300 employees, including a number of ex-WPP employees. In October 2019, MightyHive announced that it was merging with ConversionWorks, a company which works with Boots, Diageo and Giffgaff. Other interests Martin Sorrell in 2008 In 1997, he was appointed an ambassador for British business by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and subsequently appointed to the Office's Panel 2000 aimed at rebranding Britain abroad. In 1999 he was appointed by the secretary of state for education and employment to serve on the Council for Excellence in Management and Leadership. He is a governor of London Business School, and a member of the advisory boards of both the Judge Business School in Cambridge, UK and IESE in Spain. He is also chairman of the Global Advisory Board of the Centre for International Business and Management (CIBAM), at the University of Cambridge, UK. In 1998, he was appointed to the board of directors of associates of Harvard Business School and to the board of the Indian School of Business. On behalf of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, he chaired Media.NYC.2020, which reviewed the future of the global media industry, the implications for NYC, and suggested actionable next steps for the NYC government. Sorrell was a \\"Remainer\\" in the run up to the Brexit referendum, and has expressed support for a second referendum on EU membership once the Brexit terms have been finalized, stating that when \\"we finally see what the terms are of Brexit, then the electorate can be asked to reconfirm in whichever way possible, referendum or general election platform, that they still want to go ahead.‚Äù He also justified new investments in France, Germany, Italy and Spain as a means to protect WPP against immigration caps following Brexit, emphasising the importance of freedom of movement of WPP's work force, 17 percent of which are from EU countries other than the UK.  Criticism and controversy  In 2005 Sorrell sold ¬£9m of shares in WPP at the end of a restricted stock holding period. He also agreed to change a contract with the company which had been much criticised by institutional shareholders in WPP as being unfairly written in Sorrell's favour. Under the previous agreement if Sorrell had been terminated, it would have led to a very large payout; the new agreement provided him instead with no termination payment. In 2005 his pay was ¬£2.42 million including cash and bonuses. Further he exercised ¬£52 million in share options, was entitled to a further ¬£5.8million in stock, and deferred further options on another 2.65 million shares valued at ¬£15 million until 2008. In 2011 Sorrell's pay package increased by 70% to ¬£4.5 million after WPP's pre-tax profits rose 28%. In October 2011 Sorrell went on the BBC to defend large increases in his and other CEO pay packages at a time when real average wages in the Western world were declining. Shareholders have criticised aspects of corporate governance at WPP. This came to the fore again in 2006 with the advent of two court cases revolving around alleged corruption in an Italian subsidiary and contract disputes with the US launch of the OK! magazine. In June 2008 WPP drew strong criticism for the involvement of an agency, 'Imago', in which WPP's Y&R; subsidiary held a minority interest, with the ZANU-PF presidential campaign in Zimbabwe. A report by the Financial Times found out that Imago was employed by Robert Mugabe's campaign for reelection to the presidency of Zimbabwe. WPP subsequently divested Y&R;'s minority interests in Zimbabwe. Following criticism about his pay from investors, Sorrell agreed to a pay cut that would have reduced his salary from ¬£46 million in 2016 to ¬£13 million by 2021. In April 2018, Sorrell left WPP after 33 years, following allegations of personal misconduct and misuse of company assets. Sorrell has denied the allegations. The Financial Times in an investigation around the circumstances of his departure from WPP has commented that what ‚Äúemerged is a picture of routine verbal abuse of underlings and a blending of Sir Martin‚Äôs corporate and private life that jarred with some colleagues ‚Äî particularly over his company expenditure, some of which was also extended to his wife‚Äù This included allegations that Sorrell visited a brothel paid for with company funds. Sorrell has denied these allegations. Recognition He was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours. On 27 September 2007, Sorrell was awarded the Harvard Business School‚Äôs highest honour, the Alumni Achievement Award, by Dean Jay O. Light. The award was also given to: Ayala Corp. chair Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, A. Malachi Mixon of Invacare, Donna Dubinsky and Hansj√∂rg Wyss of Synthes.Abs-Cbn Interactive, JAZA receives Harvard alumni award In 2015 he was a Trustee of the British Museum.The British Museum Trustees, British Museum, accessed 31 March 2015 Personal life Sorrell was first married to Sandra Finestone, with whom he has three sons, but the marriage broke down in 2003. In October 2005, he cashed in ¬£12 million of WPP shares to fund the divorce settlement, in which Ms. Finestone, represented by Nicholas Mostyn QC, was awarded ¬£30 million including: a ¬£3.25m four-storey Georgian townhouse; two Harrods underground car parking spaces worth around ¬£90,000 each; ¬£23.5m in cash; ¬£2m in bank deposits; and other assets including stocks and shares. Despite the divorce settlement, Sorrell still had 13 million shares in WPP, an estimated ¬£80m stake, following the divorce, representing around 1% of the company, plus his 2005 pay settlement award. The divorce settlement was unusual in being a 60/40 split in favour of Sorrell ‚Äî a break from the previously established policy of a 50/50 split even in big-money divorces since an influential ruling by Appeal Court Justice Mathew Thorpe in the 2002 divorce between Harry and Shan Lambert established that the contribution to the household of non-working wives should be considered equal to their husbands'. In the Lambert judgement, Lord Justice Thorpe stated that \\"special contribution remains a legitimate possibility but only in exceptional circumstances\\"; Sorrell was the first husband deemed to have met that criterion in a subsequent divorce settlement, with Mr Justice Bennett citing Sorrell's \\"special contribution\\" to the family's wealth in justification. Sorrell's three sons, Mark, Jonathan, and Robert, all followed him to Cambridge and later joined Goldman Sachs. Jonathan Sorrell is president of the hedge fund Man Group. Sorrell next married Cristiana Falcone, director of media and entertainment industries at the World Economic Forum.

It marked the end of Augustus II of Poland's attempts to create an absolute monarchy in Poland, and the beginning of the Russian Empire's increasing influence and control over the Commonwealth.  Background  Augustus II of Poland Augustus II the Strong of the Saxon House of Wettin was elected to the throne of Poland in 1697. The Wettins, used to absolute rule, attempted to govern through intimidation and the use of force, which led to a series of conflicts between Wettin supporters and opponents (including another pretender to the Polish throne, King Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski). Those conflicts often took the form of confederations ‚Äì legal rebellions against the king permitted under the Golden Freedoms. Augustus II wanted to strengthen royal power in the Commonwealth and to that end he brought in troops from Saxony (by the summer of 1714 more than 25,000 Saxon troops were inside Commonwealth's borders). This produced dissent within the Commonwealth. Meanwhile, in the aftermath of the Great Northern War, which marked the rise of the Russian Empire (1721), the growing conflict between Augustus II and the Polish nobility (szlachta) was used by the powerful Russian Tsar Peter the Great, victor of the Great Northern War. At the time Russia was not yet strong enough to conquer and absorb the Commonwealth outright, nor could it easily and openly assume control of it, despite the Commonwealth's dysfunctional politics; the \\"Polish anarchy\\" was not to be easily governed. Hence Peter's goal was to weaken both sides, and to prevent Augustus from strengthening his position, which he feared would lead to a resurgent Commonwealth that could threaten Russia's recent gains and growing influence. He succeeded in forcing through conditions (such as reduction of the Commonwealth army's size) that decreased the Commonwealth's political status relative to Russia. Peter used Augustus' recent policies, aiming at the reduction of power of the hetmans (Polish military commanders in chief), as well as the occurrence of a bad harvest and some Polish-French negotiations, to stir opposition to Augustus. Tarnogr√≥d Confederation The nobles, spurred by Russian promises of support, formed the Tarnogr√≥d Confederation on 26 November 1715. The Confederation's marshal was Stanis≈Çaw Led√≥chowski. The Tarnogr√≥d Confederation was only the last and most notable of several confederations formed against Augustus at that time. The Confederates were supported by most of the Commonwealth's own army. The Russians entered the country, but did not participate in any major engagements. They bided their time, as Peter posed as the mediator between the Commonwealth's king and its szlachta. Crucially, the Russians did not support the Confederates as promised, and instead insisted on bringing both sides to the negotiating table. The civil war lasted for a year and the outcome hung in the balance. Saxon forces under the command of Jacob Heinrich von Flemming enjoyed military superiority, advanced south-eastwards and took Zamo≈õƒá (this victory was however accomplished less through military tactics than through diplomacy and a treachery). The confederates then pushed back, entered Wielkopolska, and took Pozna≈Ñ. They gained some support from a local Wielkopolska confederation and from Lithuania. Neither side was however posed to achieve victory, and the Russian pressure mounted; eventually the Russians declared that they would consider any side that refused to enter into negotiations an enemy, and open hostilities against them. Unable to defeat the Confederates, many of whom still saw Peter as the protector of their rights (and some of whom hoped for Augustus to be deposed), Augustus agreed to open the negotiations with Russians acting as arbitrators. The Russians were represented by a delegation headed by prince Grigori Dolgorukov (1657‚Äî1723). A peace treaty between the Confederates and the Augustus was signed on 3 or 4 November 1716, as relations between the Confederates and the Russians deteriorated. The Russians made it increasingly apparent that their goals were not wholly benign to the Commonwealth. Finally, a Sejm session was called for 1 February 1717.  Sejm  To prevent the use of liberum veto from disrupting Sejm proceedings, the session was turned into a confederated sejm. (It was also a pacification sejm). Threatened by a strong Russian army, with Russian soldiers \\"guarding\\" the proceedings, the Silent Sejm was known as such because only the speaker (marshal of the Sejm) Stanis≈Çaw Led√≥chowski (podkomorzy krzemienicki), and a few selected other deputies were allowed a voice, outlining the terms of the settlement. Other names for the Sejm in the English language include Dumb or Muted. The terms themselves were significantly designed by Peter the Great. The Sejm lasted for one day only, or more precisely, six hours. This settlement stipulated that: * Tarnogr√≥d Confederation (and older, Sandomierz Confederation) were dissolved; * the right to form confederations in the future was abolished; * Golden Freedoms (Cardinal Laws) are reaffirmed (in particular, liberum veto still held); * the king was not to imprison people based on his whim (reaffirmation of the neminem captivabimus); * the king had to avoid offensive wars; * Poles and Saxony (Augustus' homeland) should not intervene into each other's domestic affairs (the king had to avoid negotiations on Polish affairs with foreign (Saxonian) powers); * hetmans and sejmiks (local parliaments) had lost some of their prerogatives (notably, sejmiks no longer could change local taxation); * Saxony troops stationed in Poland were to be significantly limited in size (banished totally, or reduced to 1,200 of royal guard, which no further foreign recruits allowed) * Saxon officials were to be removed from Poland (or were limited to six) and the king was to not give any further offices to foreign officials; * the rights of Protestants in Poland were curtailed (some Protestant churches were to be demolished to punish \\"Swedish partisans\\") * establishment of an estimate of the state's income and expenditure (in essence, a budget, one of the first in Europe) * established taxes for Commonwealth army (consuming over 90% of the state's income); * the army was to be billeted on the crown estates; * reduction of the army to 24,000 (or 18,000, or 16,000 ‚Äì sources vary) for Poland and 6,000 (or 8,000) for Lithuania. An army of that size was insufficient to protect the Commonwealth; a normal soldier's wages meant that after factoring officer pensions and other military needs, the effective army was perhaps 12,000 strong, several times weaker than those of its neighbours ‚Äì at that time the Russian army numbered 300,000; Sources vary whether Russia was recognized as the power that would guarantee the settlement; this claim is made by Jacek Jƒôdruch and Norman Davies, but rejected by Jacek Staszewski and explicitly noted as erroneous in the edited work by Zbigniew W√≥jcik. Aftermath and significance The Silent Sejm marked the end of Augustus II's attempts to create an absolute monarchy in Poland; he subsequently focused his efforts on securing the succession of his son to the Polish throne. While some beneficial reforms were passed (such as the establishment of standing taxes for the military), the Sejm is regarded negatively by modern historians. The reduction in the size of the army and the establishment of Russia's position as the settlement's proposed (even if rejected) guarantor reinforced Commonwealth military inferiority compared to its neighbors, and unofficially, put it in the position of a Russian protectorate. The Russian tsar, as the proposed guarantor, now had a convenient excuse to intervene in Polish politics at will. With a reduced army, removal of Saxon troops and the right to form confederations, the nobility and the king had less power to fight one another ‚Äì or, not coincidentally, to resist outside forces. Russian troops remained in the Commonwealth for two years, supporting opposition to Augustus, and Russia soon reached an agreement with other powers to put an end to further attempts at the reform and strengthening of the Commonwealth. Thus the Silent Sejm is regarded as one of the first precedents for the Russian Empire dictating Polish internal policy, and a precursor to the partitions of Poland, which erased the Commonwealth from world maps by 1795. Historian Norman Davies wrote that this Sejm \\"effectively terminated the independence of Poland and Lithuania\\". The system created by the Silent Sejm dominated the Polish political scene until the late 18th century, when a new wave of reforms led to the Constitution of the 3 May, soon followed by partitions of Poland and loss of Polish sovereignty for 123 years. Notes a Through some sources claim that the entire Sejm was silent, or that only Led√≥chowski spoke, in fact several people spoke during the Sejm. J√≥zef Szujski notes that the Sejm begun with a long speech by Led√≥chowski, that other marshals of provincial confederations were allowed to speak in order to renounce their positions, that the chancellor Jan Sebastian Szembek was able to reply to them, and that the deputy and commissar Micha≈Ç Potocki read the constitution and relevant treaties. At the same time, the sources agree that most of the deputies were prevented from speaking; Szujski notes that hetman Stanis≈Çaw Mateusz Rzewuski was refused the right to speak. Archbishop of Gniezno and primate of Poland, Stanis≈Çaw Szembek, \\"stormed out in a fury\\", complaining about being not allowed to voice his position in the discussion.

The name Rebel Youth is derived from Cuba's youth newspaper, Juventud Rebelde. It was adopted after the publication's previous title, New Horizons, had to be dropped due to a complaint from the Canadian federal government that was, at the time, operating a housing program with the same name.  History  The earliest publication by the YCL and predecessor of Rebel Youth was The Young Worker, founded in 1923. The magazine specialized in youth issues and operated despite being declared illegal by the Government of Canada under the War Measures Act. Beginning in the late 1920s, the Young Worker also published a supplementary magazine aimed at children which achieved a circulation of over 4,000 readers. Early contributors to the magazine include journalist and Communist Party of Canada leader Leslie Morris. By 1932, the Young Worker had become a bi-weekly publication under editor Stanley Ryerson. Due to the illegality of the magazine and of the Young Communist League of Canada, the YCL's offices were raided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, distributors jailed or harassed, and issues of the magazine seized. Many university libraries and archives, such as the University of Toronto's Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library, carry microfilm archives of The Young Worker compiled by the intelligence division of the Ministry of Labour. A relaunched magazine, Advance, replaced the Young Worker in the 1930s. Advance was launched by editor John Boyd, and called for a united front strategy with other left-wing groups in response to the growth of fascism and a growing economic crisis. Advance was later relaunched as New Advance, and then in the early 1940s as Challenge, which was published until the 1950s with a mission to broaden the magazine's audience. By the early 1960s, the magazine, now called Scan, was again relaunched under a new editorial team. Scan soon became a broadsheet publication and re-adopted the name The Young Worker by 1968. Due to the lack of popularity of the publication's new broadsheet format, the format was changed back to the original magazine format and was renamed New Horizons (later, simply Horizons) by the 1970s, the name derived from a speech by Communist Party of Canada leader Tim Buck. By 1983, the magazine adopted its current title, Rebel Youth. As the YCL was liquidated in the 1990s in response to growing disagreement within the league regarding the future of the socialist movement, Rebel Youth ceased publication. It was relaunched in 2004 following the reorganization of the YCL. The magazine adopted colour printing in 2012 and aims to publish at least biannually. Though now printed in a bilingual format, the Ligue de la Jeunesse Communiste previously maintained a separate website of the magazine's French-language articles to complement the English-language Rebel Youth website. In 2020, the Rebel Youth and Jeunesse militante websites were relaunched together in a bilingual format, and the magazine was redesigned with a new logo.

By 1942, approximately 1,500 evacuees from Gibraltar, a British territory, were in Jamaica; other civilians were evacuated to Britain and Madeira. They were removed to make way for a military force of 30,000 who fortified the area against German attack. To speed up the development of the camp, barrack frames were built on the Jamaica-bound ship. The camp was situated on 252 acres of the former Mona Estate. It had housing for the evacuees, staff, and Roman Catholic priests and nuns. Facilities included a hospital, police station, and store. It was outfitted with electrical, water, and telephone service. There was a kosher kitchen and synagogue for Jewish refugees. People who had a trade could work within the camp. The camp was designed to take 7,000, but the population of Malta had refused to be moved to Jamaica and the authorities wanted to use the unused capacity as a prisoner of war camp or as barracks for the local militia in 1943.

Twang is famed for his live performances all around the world and his ability, especially in his earlier recordings, to include various South London word usage and slang as well as locations without sounding too obvious, making him a firm favourite with English hip-hop fans as the original, \\"Hip-Hop Geezer\\". Career Twang's debut single was 1995's \\"What Goin' On\\". His debut album, Dettwork SouthEast (a pun on the rail company Network SouthEast) was sent out to the media for self-promotion but never released. It included \\"Real Estate\\" and the title track, \\"Dettwork SouthEast\\". His second album, 19 Long Time, also suffered from record label obstruction. The album included \\"Red Letters\\" and Roots Manuva collaboration, \\"Shhhoosh\\". However, his 2002 album Kik Off was awarded full label release, and spawned several singles, the football themed \\"Kik Off\\", Twang anthem \\"So Rotton\\", and \\"Trixsta\\" (featuring Estelle), all of which achieved radio play and a degree of commercial success. In 2005 he released the album The Rotton Club, backed with the single \\"GCSE (Ghetto Children Sex Education)\\" featuring Twang's prot√©g√© (and Rottonus Records signee) K9. Twang also released another single from the album in late 2005, \\"Travellin\\" which featured Barrington Levy in the original album version, but the video featured the First Man Remix with female singer Tali. On 20 October 2013 he released a single \\"Badda Dan Dat\\", which features remixes from drum and bass artists Run Tingz Cru, Serial Killaz and Terrahawk. It was released through Ramajam Recordings. In September 2014, Dettwerk SouthEast finally received a full release on Sony Music. Blak Twang is heavily linked with rapper Versetti and others.

It was discovered in 1932, and at first treated as Tsuga longibracteata, being classified in its own genus in 1989 when new research indicated how distinct it is from other species of Tsuga - by the larger, erect cones with exserted bracts, and (like Keteleeria) male cones in umbels, and from Keteleeria by the shorter leaves and smaller cones. Conservation It is a very rare tree listed as a near-threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature due to historical deforestation, though it is now protected.Farjon, A., Christian, T. & Zhang, D 2013.

Here an AWGN channel is assumed. In digital communication or data transmission, Eb/N0 (energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio) is a normalized signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measure, also known as the \\"SNR per bit\\". It is especially useful when comparing the bit error rate (BER) performance of different digital modulation schemes without taking bandwidth into account. As the description implies, Eb is the signal energy associated with each user data bit; it is equal to the signal power divided by the user bit rate (not the channel symbol rate). If signal power is in watts and bit rate is in bits per second, Eb is in units of joules (watt-seconds). N0 is the noise spectral density, the noise power in a 1 Hz bandwidth, measured in watts per hertz or joules. These are the same units as Eb so the ratio Eb/N0 is dimensionless; it is frequently expressed in decibels. Eb/N0 directly indicates the power efficiency of the system without regard to modulation type, error correction coding or signal bandwidth (including any use of spread spectrum). This also avoids any confusion as to which of several definitions of \\"bandwidth\\" to apply to the signal. But when the signal bandwidth is well defined, Eb/N0 is also equal to the signal-to- noise ratio (SNR) in that bandwidth divided by the \\"gross\\" link spectral efficiency in bit/s‚ãÖHz, where the bits in this context again refer to user data bits, irrespective of error correction information and modulation type. Eb/N0 must be used with care on interference-limited channels since additive white noise (with constant noise density N0) is assumed, and interference is not always noise-like. In spread spectrum systems (e.g., CDMA), the interference is sufficiently noise-like that it can be represented as I0 and added to the thermal noise N0 to produce the overall ratio .  Relation to carrier-to-noise ratio  Eb/N0 is closely related to the carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR or C/N), i.e. the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the received signal, after the receiver filter but before detection: :\\\\frac{C}{N} = \\\\frac{E_\\\\text{b}}{N_0} \\\\frac{f_\\\\text{b}}{B} where :fb is the channel data rate (net bitrate), and :B is the channel bandwidth The equivalent expression in logarithmic form (dB): :\\\\text{CNR}_\\\\text{dB} = 10\\\\log_{10}\\\\left(\\\\frac{E_\\\\text{b}}{N_0}\\\\right) + 10\\\\log_{10}\\\\left(\\\\frac{f_\\\\text{b}}{B}\\\\right), Caution: Sometimes, the noise power is denoted by N0/2 when negative frequencies and complex-valued equivalent baseband signals are considered rather than passband signals, and in that case, there will be a 3 dB difference.  Relation to Es/N0  Eb/N0 can be seen as a normalized measure of the energy per symbol to noise power spectral density (Es/N0): :\\\\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \\\\frac{E_\\\\text{s}}{\\\\rho N_0}, where Es is the energy per symbol in joules and œÅ is the nominal spectral efficiency in bit/s‚ãÖHz. Es/N0 is also commonly used in the analysis of digital modulation schemes. The two quotients are related to each other according to the following: :\\\\frac{E_\\\\text{s}}{N_0} = \\\\frac{E_\\\\text{b}}{N_0} \\\\log_2(M), where M is the number of alternative modulation symbols, e.g. M = 4 for QPSK and M = 8 for 8PSK. This is the energy per bit, not the energy per information bit. Es/N0 can further be expressed as: :\\\\frac{E_\\\\text{s}}{N_0} = \\\\frac{C}{N}\\\\frac{B}{f_\\\\text{s}}, where :C/N is the carrier-to-noise ratio or signal-to-noise ratio. :B is the channel bandwidth in hertz. :fs is the symbol rate in baud or symbols per second.  Shannon limit  The Shannon‚ÄìHartley theorem says that the limit of reliable information rate (data rate exclusive of error-correcting codes) of a channel depends on bandwidth and signal-to- noise ratio according to: : I < B \\\\log_2 \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{S}{N} \\\\right) where :I is the information rate in bits per second excluding error-correcting codes; :B is the bandwidth of the channel in hertz; :S is the total signal power (equivalent to the carrier power C); and :N is the total noise power in the bandwidth. This equation can be used to establish a bound on Eb/N0 for any system that achieves reliable communication, by considering a gross bit rate R equal to the net bit rate I and therefore an average energy per bit of Eb = S/R, with noise spectral density of N0 = N/B. For this calculation, it is conventional to define a normalized rate Rl = R/2B, a bandwidth utilization parameter of bits per second per half hertz, or bits per dimension (a signal of bandwidth B can be encoded with 2B dimensions, according to the Nyquist‚ÄìShannon sampling theorem). Making appropriate substitutions, the Shannon limit is: : {R \\\\over B} = 2 R_l < \\\\log_2 \\\\left( 1 + 2R_l\\\\frac{E_\\\\text{b}}{N_0} \\\\right) Which can be solved to get the Shannon- limit bound on Eb/N0: :\\\\frac{E_\\\\text{b}}{N_0} > \\\\frac{2^{2R_l} - 1}{2R_l} When the data rate is small compared to the bandwidth, so that Rl is near zero, the bound, sometimes called the ultimate Shannon limit, is: :\\\\frac{E_\\\\text{b}}{N_0} > \\\\ln(2) which corresponds to ‚àí1.59dB. This often- quoted limit of ‚àí1.59 dB applies only to the theoretical case of infinite bandwidth. The Shannon limit for finite-bandwidth signals is always higher.  Cutoff rate  For any given system of coding and decoding, there exists what is known as a cutoff rate R0, typically corresponding to an Eb/N0 about 2 dB above the Shannon capacity limit. The cutoff rate used to be thought of as the limit on practical error correction codes without an unbounded increase in processing complexity, but has been rendered largely obsolete by the more recent discovery of turbo codes and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.

The .270, .280, and .30-06 were all derived from the .30-03 parent case. The .270 Winchester uses a .270 inch (6.86 mm) bore diameter and a .277 inch (7.04 mm) bullet diameter. Description The .270 Winchester became a very popular cartridge due to the widespread praises of gunwriters like Townsend Whelen and Jack O'Connor who used the cartridge for 40 years and touted its merits in the pages of Outdoor Life.Barnes Reloading Manual Number 2 (1997)Hornady Handbook of Cartridge Reloading, Fourth Edition (1996) It drives an bullet at approximately , later reduced to . The cartridge demonstrated high performance at the time of its introduction and was marketed as being suitable for big game shooting in the range, when that was considered long range hunting. With modern bullets and optics, it is easily a 1,000 yard cartridge. Two additional bullet weights were soon introduced: a hollow-point bullet for vermin shooting, and a bullet for deer, elk, and moose in big-game hunting. While not an immediate success, over the succeeding decades and especially in the post- World War II period, the .270 Winchester attained great popularity among gun owners, metallic silhouette rifle shooters and hunters, ranking it among the most popular and widely used cartridges worldwide. Internationally, firearms manufacturers now offer this chambering in all firearm varieties: bolt- actions, single-shots, lever-actions (such as the Browning BLR), pump-actions (such as the Remington 7600), autoloaders (such as the Remington 7400), and even a few double rifles.Speer Reloading Manual Number 12 (1994) Loads Cartridges are commonly available from sizes with loads being by far the most popular. Handloaders have a larger range of options with the availability of bullets in a number of weights from . Common bullet weight recommendations for shooting different game are as follows: * bullets: animals smaller than coyotes. * bullets: antelope or other animals up to the size of mule deer. * bullets: deer, elk, moose, and some larger animals. Recent introductions of low-drag bullets suited to the .270 Winchester such as the Nosler Accubond Long-Range, Hornady ELD-X and Matrix long range bullets are promoting renewed interest in the cartridge among long range hunters. While it is true that a .270 Winchester case can be formed from a .30-06 Springfield case, the case length of a .30-06 is while the case length of a .270 is , the same as a .30-03 Springfield.

It features a built-in tilt sensor, which is used to manipulate the game's environment. By tilting the Game Boy Advance left or right, the player can tilt the game area, causing enemies and other objects to slide as the direction of gravity changes. This gameplay mechanic is used to solve puzzles or aid Yoshi in completing levels. While possible, the tilt sensing device makes playing on a Game Boy Player for the Nintendo GameCube very difficult, as it requires the player to tilt the entire system to move the cartridge. The game received mixed reviews. Plot The plot and graphics are similar to those of Yoshi's Story for the Nintendo 64. When Bowser starts wreaking havoc on Yoshi's Island, a book spirit named Hongo traps the entire island within the pages of a storybook. Only by locking Bowser away, Yoshi can convince Hongo to release the rest of the island, so he sets out to progress through the chapters of the book. Gameplay Each course is controlled by a spirit, each with an obsession ‚Äî one loves money, one loves fast things, one loves friendliness, one loves strength, etc. They will set out guidelines for the course, such as collecting fruit to free a certain number of Egglings, finishing a course before time runs out, finding a certain number of coins or defeating ‚Äî or not defeating ‚Äî a certain number of enemies. By satisfying that spirit's requirements, players pass the course. Yoshi can jump and stick out his tongue to eat fruit or enemies, but the main feature of the game is the tilt mechanism. By moving the Game Boy Advance side to side, players tilt the world around Yoshi, causing enemies to roll around, swinging ships and pendulums, and bouncing items all over the place. An impassable wall will become a climbable slope, or a rolled-up carpet will become a long platform. Each environment requires players to master not only button presses but also tilt movements to progress. Reception At the time of its release, most critics thought of Yoshi's Universal Gravitation as a mediocre title. Craig Harris of IGN said the game was too short, and most critics thought the other Game Boy Advance game to use a tilt sensor, WarioWare: Twisted!, was a better example of tilt-sensing technology in video games. 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish called the tilt controls \\"graceless and clumsy\\" and the character animations \\"choppy\\", concluding that it was a \\"mediocre\\" and \\"boring\\" game. GameSpot's Justin Calvert thought the tilting worked alright and enjoyed the graphics and difficulty curve, but overall found the game to be \\"repetitive and disappointingly short\\". Game Informer enjoyed the tilt sensing, calling it a \\"neat\\" and \\"inventive\\" mechanic that \\"breathe[d] new life into the [platformer] genre\\", but was disappointed by the level designs, which were mostly \\"pretty standard fare.\\" Another point that is often criticized is that, due to the tilt-sensor and its orientation, the game can only be comfortably played on the original Game Boy Advance, while it is confusingly mirrored on the Game Boy Advance SP and not playable at all on the Game Boy Player. However, the game actually includes a menu screen at startup in which the player can select the handheld system they are using: either the original Game Boy Advance, in which case the game cartridge is inserted from the top of the system, or the Game Boy Advance SP, Game Boy Micro, Nintendo DS, or Nintendo DS Lite which all feature a bottom loading slot to insert the cartridge. Selecting the corresponding cartridge slot orientation at this menu eliminates the mirrored tilt sensing so that the game can be played on any of those devices. The player can also re-calibrate the tilt sensor to fit whichever game system they use. See also *Koro Koro Puzzle Happy Panechu! *Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble *WarioWare: Twisted!

The band was formed in 1982 and released its first album, Partibrejkers I in 1985 in a two guitars, drums and vocal set (no bass guitar). The band has experienced numerous line-up changes. The mainstay of the band are Zoran Kostiƒá \\"Cane\\" (vocals) and Neboj≈°a Antonijeviƒá \\"Anton\\" (guitar). The band has received steady critical acclaim over the years and is well received by audiences all over former Yugoslavia, not only because of their music, but also because of their anti-war activism with the Rimtutituki project. Their influences are diverse, such as the Stooges, MC5, early Rolling Stones and New York Dolls, combined with blues, British rhythm-and-blues, rockabilly and classic rock and roll.  History  = 1980s = The band was formed by a former Urbana Gerila and Radniƒçka Kontrola member Zoran Kostiƒá \\"Cane\\" (vocals), former Republika members Goran Bulatoviƒá \\"Manza\\" (drums) and Ljubi≈°a Kostadinoviƒá \\"Ljuba\\" (guitar) and former BG5, Butik and ≈†ine member Neboj≈°a Antonijeviƒá \\"Anton\\" (guitar). Bulatoviƒá named the band by Kostiƒá's idea of themselves, a transliterated version of party-breakers. They had their first public appearance on October 4, 1982, at the Dadov Theatre, performing as an opening act for The Fifties. After the appearance, the band started performing often and on one occasion, in Zagreb, they held five concerts in three days time, Branimir \\"Johnny\\" ≈†tuliƒá being the sound engineer at the last concert, and even offering to be the band's producer. The band's first recording, the song \\"Radio Utopia\\", was released on the various artists compilation Ventilator 202 in 1983 by PGP-RTB. Demo versions of the songs \\"Hiljadu godina\\" (\\"A Thousand Years\\") and \\"Veƒçeras\\" (\\"Tonight\\") were often broadcast on Serbian radio stations, and the newly recorded versions of the songs were released as their first single. For the release of the band's first album, Partibrejkers I (Partybreakers I), produced by Du≈°an Kojiƒá \\"Koja\\" of Disciplina Kiƒçme, the band combined rhythm-and-blues with punk rock, bringing anthem status to the band's songs \\"Uliƒçni hodaƒç\\" (\\"Street Walker\\"), \\"Ona ≈æivi na brdu\\" (\\"She Lives on a Hill\\"), \\"Gubitnik\\" (\\"Loser\\"), \\"Ako si...\\" (\\"If You Are...\\") and \\"Stoj, D≈æoni\\" (\\"Stop, Johnny\\"), a cover of Tomi Sovilj i Njegove Siluete version of Chuck Berry's \\"Johnny B. Goode\\". The album was recorded at the O Studio in Belgrade on June 1984Partibrejkers I at Discogs and the album cover was designed by Antonijeviƒá. As guests on the album appeared Branislav Petroviƒá \\"Banana\\" on harmonica, producer Kojiƒá played organ, and Branislav Triviƒá played saxophone. The album was rereleased by Hi-Fi Centar and VTC Wien on CD in 1999. Despite the success of the debut album, Jugoton declined to release the band's second album, stating that it \\"lacked rebelliousness\\". On summer of 1985, Bulatoviƒá left the band, being temporarily replaced by Disciplina Kiƒçme drummer Nenad Krasovac \\"Kele\\", and in December, the band ceased to exist. For a short period of time, Antonijeviƒá performed with the band Plaƒáenici, after which Partibrejkers were reformed in a new lineup, featuring a former Plaƒáenici drummer Vlada Funtek and former Radost Evrope bassist Dime Todorov \\"Mune\\". The band recorded the material for the second studio album on June 1987 at the Barbaro Studio in Bukovac.Partibrejkers II at Discogs The recordings were sent to PGP-RTB, but they were not prone to releasing it. In the meantime, the band organized two charity concerts at the Lotus bar, buying sixteen cakes for the children of the neglected children home in Zveƒçanska street in Belgrade. On May 1988, Funtek left the band, being firstly replaced by Marko Milivojeviƒá, and then by former Potop and Banana member Igor Borojeviƒá. On September 1988, the band's second album, with the working title Kobila i pastuv preljubnik (A Mare and a Stallion Adulterer), was released. However, Goran Dimiƒá, who designed the album cover, on purpose did not put the album title on the cover. Partibrejkers II featured prominent tracks \\"Ja se ne vraƒáam\\" (\\"I'm Not Coming Back\\"), \\"Prsten\\" (\\"A Ring\\"), \\"Meseƒçeva kƒái\\" (\\"Moon Daughter\\"), \\"Pet ispod nule\\" (\\"Five Degrees Below Zero\\") and \\"Nema cure\\" (\\"There Is No Girl\\"), for which Antonijeviƒá sang the lead vocals. The song \\"Put\\" (\\"The Road\\") was not recorded in Bukovac, but at the O Studio on March 1988 and added to the rest of the material. At the same time, MTV made a report on the band's work. In February 1989, the band made new demo recordings, this time with the help of the Elektriƒçni Orgazam frontman Srƒëan Gojkoviƒá \\"Gile\\", who played rhythm guitar. The recordings appeared on the third album Partibrejkers III, which, like the previous, was released through Jugodisk. The album, recorded on August and September 1989, was produced by Milan ƒÜiriƒá and Antonijeviƒá, mixed by Vlada Negovanoviƒá, and as guest appeared Petar Miladinoviƒá \\"Pera Joe\\" on harmonica.Partibrejkers III at Discogs The album cover was designed by former Kostiƒá's Radniƒçka Kontrola bandmate, Srƒëan Markoviƒá \\"√êile\\". = 1990s = In 1990, the band started a major Yugoslav tour, and performed as an opening act on the Mot√∂rhead concerts in Yugoslavia. In late 1990, Borojeviƒá left the band and was replaced by the former Baby Kate drummer Borko Petroviƒá. The new line- up released a live album, Zabava jo≈° traje (The Party Is Still On), recorded live on July 1991 in Zrenjanin and Vr≈°ac and released by Sorabia Disk, and on February 1992, as guests at the band's concert in Belgrade SKC appeared Emir Kusturica, a movie director and former Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje member, Johnny Depp, an actor and former The Kids and Rock City Angels member, and Jim Jarmusch, a filmmaker and a former Del Byzanteens member.YouTube - Partibrejkers and Johnny depp At the time, the line-up changed one more time, as original lineup guitarist Kostadinoviƒá and drummer Borojeviƒá returned to the band, and Todorov left the band, being replaced by NBG bass guitarist Sa≈°a Vlajsoviƒá. At the beginning of the Yugoslav wars, in 1992, Antonijeviƒá and Kostiƒá, with Elektriƒçni Orgazam and Ekatarina Velika members, formed an anti-war supergroup Rimtutituki, releasing the \\"Slu≈°aj 'vamo\\" (\\"Listen Up\\") single, released by Radio B92 and promoted in Belgrade with the band performing live in a truck while circulating the streets during the anti-war protests. In November the same year, the band was one of the first in Serbia to perform live in Slovenia, being well received by the audience and given special attention by the media. In March 1993, the band performed at the Milos club in Thessaloniki and toured Macedonia. As a part of the Ko to tamo peva? (Who's That Singing Over There?) project, the band, with Ekatarina Velika, Elektriƒçni Orgazam, and Vje≈°tice from Zagreb, performed live in Prague and Berlin.

Biography Born at Palermo son of Ferdinando and Giulia Venturelli, he devoted a great part of his life to the history of Sicily. Amari was also an Orientalist, who investigated the true character of the Sicilian Vespers. He also served as the Italy's first minister of public education. Amari became an important figure during the Risorgimento. A liberal republican and carbonarist, who after the fall of Joachim Murat supported Sicilian secession. He became a link between Prime Minister Camillo Benso di Cavour and influential Sicilians, helping to convince them to support Italian unification. Amari did so expecting Cavour to grant Sicily some regional autonomy after unification. He died at Florence in 1889. Works Amari's historical works focus on Medieval Sicilian history, including extensive works on the period of Muslim control. His efforts have earned him acknowledgment as one of 19th century Europe's premier translators of Medieval Arabic writings. His Storia dei Musulmani di Sicilia (History of the Muslims of Sicily, 1854) has been translated into many languages, including Arabic by a group of Egyptian scholars in 2004. His translation from an Arabic manuscript of a mirror for princes text, including a biography of its author, the medieval Sicilian Arab Ibn Zafar al Siqilli, was published in 1851.

The current United States Attorney for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia is Michael R. Sherwin.  History  E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse The court was established by Congress in 1863 as the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, replacing the abolished circuit and district courts of the District of Columbia that had been in place since 1801. The court consisted of four justices, including a chief justice, and was granted the same powers and jurisdiction as the earlier circuit court. Any of the justices could convene a United States circuit court or a local criminal court. In 1936, Congress renamed the court the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia. Its current name was adopted in 1948, and from then on justices were known as judges. Originally housed in the former District of Columbia City Hall, the court now sits in the E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse located at 333 Constitution Avenue, Northwest, Washington, D.C. The District has no local district attorney or equivalent, and so local prosecutorial matters also fall into the jurisdiction of the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia. Assistant United States Attorneys (AUSAs) are tasked with prosecution of not only federal crimes but also crimes that would normally be left to the state prosecutor's discretion. Because of this the District has the largest U.S. Attorney's Office in the nation, with around 250 AUSAs.

It refers to the immunity of user applications to changes made in the definition and organization of data. Application programs should not, ideally, be exposed to details of data representation and storage. The DBMS provides an abstract view of the data that hides such details. There are two types of data independence: physical and logical data independence. The data independence and operation independence together gives the feature of data abstraction. There are two levels of data independence. First Level of Data Independence The logical structure of the data is known as the 'schema definition'. In general, if a user application operates on a subset of the attributes of a relation, it should not be affected later when new attributes are added to the same relation. Logical data independence indicates that the conceptual schema can be changed without affecting the existing schemas. Second Level of Data Independence The physical structure of the data is referred to as \\"physical data description\\". Physical data independence deals with hiding the details of the storage structure from user applications. The application should not be involved with these issues since, conceptually, there is no difference in the operations carried out against the data. There are three types of data independence: # Logical data independence: The ability to change the Conceptual (Logical) schema without changing the External schema (User View) is called logical data independence. For example, the addition or removal of new entities, attributes, or relationships to the conceptual schema or having to rewrite existing application programs. # Physical data independence: The ability to change the physical schema without changing the logical schema is called physical data independence. For example, a change to the internal schema, such as using different file organization or storage structures, storage devices, or indexing strategy, should be possible without having to change the conceptual or external schemas. #View level data independence: always independent no effect, because there doesn't exist any other level above view level. =Data Independence= Data independence can be explained as follows: Each higher level of the data architecture is immune to changes of the next lower level of the architecture. The logical scheme stays unchanged even though the storage space or type of some data is changed for reasons of optimization or reorganization. In this, external schema does not change. In this, internal schema changes may be required due to some physical schema were reorganized here. Physical data independence is present in most databases and file environment in which hardware storage of encoding, exact location of data on disk, merging of records, so on this are hidden from user. One of the highest advantage of databases is data independence. It means we can change the conceptual schema at one level without affecting the data at another level. It also means we can change the structure of a database without affecting the data required by users and programs. This feature was not available in the file oriented approach. Data Independence Types The ability to modify schema definition in one level without affecting schema of that definition in the next higher level is called data independence. There are two levels of data independence, they are Physical data independence and Logical data independence. # Physical data independence is the ability to modify the physical schema without causing application programs to be rewritten. Modifications at the physical level are occasionally necessary to improve performance. It means we change the physical storage/level without affecting the conceptual or external view of the data. The new changes are absorbed by mapping techniques. # Logical data independence is the ability to modify the logical schema without causing application program to be rewritten. Modifications at the logical level are necessary whenever the logical structure of the database is altered (for example, when money-market accounts are added to banking system). Logical Data independence means if we add some new columns or remove some columns from table then the user view and programs should not change. For example: consider two users A & B. Both are selecting the fields \\"EmployeeNumber\\" and \\"EmployeeName\\". If user B adds a new column (e.g. salary) to his table, it will not affect the external view for user A, though the internal schema of the database has been changed for both users A & B. Logical data independence is more difficult to achieve than physical data independence, since application programs are heavily dependent on the logical structure of the data that they access.

A Tc-99m pertechnetate solution is being eluted from Mo-99 molybdate bound to a chromatographic substrate A technetium-99m generator, or colloquially a technetium cow or moly cow, is a device used to extract the metastable isotope 99mTc of technetium from a decaying sample of molybdenum-99. 99Mo has a half-life of 66 hours and can be easily transported over long distances to hospitals where its decay product technetium-99m (with a half-life of only 6 hours, inconvenient for transport) is extracted and used for a variety of nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures, where its short half- life is very useful. Parent isotope source 99Mo can be obtained by the neutron activation (n,Œ≥ reaction) of 98Mo in a high neutron flux reactor. However, the most frequently used method is through fission of uranium-235 in a nuclear reactor. While most reactors currently engaged in 99Mo production use highly enriched uranium-235 targets, proliferation concerns have prompted some producers to transition to low-enriched uranium targets. The target is irradiated with neutrons to form 99Mo as a fission product (with 6.1% yield).http://www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/rp/factsheets/factsheets-pdf/fs32mo99.pdf Molybdenum-99 is then separated from unreacted uranium and other fission products in a hot cell.https://www.rertr.anl.gov/MO99/JLS.pdf Generator invention and history 99mTc remained a scientific curiosity until the 1950s when Powell Richards realized the potential of technetium-99m as a medical radiotracer and promoted its use among the medical community. While Richards was in charge of the radioisotope production at the Hot Lab Division of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Walter Tucker and Margaret Greene were working on how to improve the separation process purity of the short-lived eluted daughter product iodine-132 from tellurium-132, its 3.2-days parent, produced in the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor. They detected a trace contaminant which proved to be 99mTc, which was coming from 99Mo and was following tellurium in the chemistry of the separation process for other fission products. Based on the similarities between the chemistry of the tellurium- iodine parent-daughter pair, Tucker and Greene developed the first technetium-99m generator in 1958. It was not until 1960 that Richards became the first to suggest the idea of using technetium as a medical tracer. Generator function and mechanism Technetium-99m's short half-life of 6 hours makes long-term storage impossible and would make transport very expensive. Instead, its parent nuclide 99Mo is supplied to hospitals, after its extraction from the neutron-irradiated uranium targets and its purification in dedicated processing facilities. =Production= Generators provide radiation shielding for transport and to minimize the extraction work done at the medical facility. A typical dose rate at 1 metre from 99mTc generator is 20-50 ŒºSv/h during transport. These generators' output declines with time and must be replaced weekly, since the half-life of 99Mo is still only 66 hours. Since the half-life of the parent nuclide (99Mo) is much longer than that of the daughter nuclide (99mTc), 50% of equilibrium activity is reached within one daughter half-life, 75% within two daughter half-lives. Hence, removing the daughter nuclide (elution process) from the generator (\\"milking\\" the cow) is reasonably done as often as every 6 hours in a 99Mo/99mTc generator. =Separation= Most commercial 99Mo/99mTc generators use column chromatography, in which 99Mo in the form of molybdate, MoO42‚àí is adsorbed onto acid alumina (Al2O3). When the Mo-99 decays it forms pertechnetate TcO4‚àí, which, because of its single charge, is less tightly bound to the alumina. Pouring normal saline solution through the column of immobilized 99Mo elutes the soluble 99mTc, resulting in a saline solution containing the 99mTc as pertechnetate, with sodium as the counterion. The solution of sodium pertechnetate may then be added in an appropriate concentration to the pharmaceutical kit to be used, or sodium pertechnetate can be used directly without pharmaceutical tagging for specific procedures requiring only the 99mTcO4‚àí as the primary radiopharmaceutical. A large percentage of the 99mTc generated by a 99Mo/99mTc generator is produced in the first 3 parent half-lives, or approximately one week. Hence, clinical nuclear medicine units purchase at least one such generator per week or order several in a staggered fashion. Isomeric ratio When the generator is left unused, 99Mo decays to 99mTc, which in turn decays to 99Tc. The half-life of 99Tc is far longer than its metastable isomer, so the ratio of 99Tc to 99mTc increases over time. Both isomers are carried out by the elution process and react equally well with the ligand, but the 99Tc is an impurity useless to imaging (and cannot be separated). The generator is washed of 99Tc and 99mTc at the end of the manufacturing process of the generator, but the ratio of 99Tc to 99mTc then builds up again during transport or any other period when the generator is left unused. The first few elutions will have reduced effectiveness because of this high ratio.

The original story was written by Paul Auster, who also wrote the screenplay. The film was produced by Greg Johnson, Peter Newman, Kenzo Horikoshi, and Hisami Kuroiwa. Among others, it features Harvey Keitel, William Hurt, Stockard Channing, Harold Perrineau Jr., and Forest Whitaker. Plot The film follows the lives of multiple characters, all of whom are connected via their patronage of a small Brooklyn tobacconist store managed by Auggie (Harvey Keitel). Brooklyn Cigar Co. was located on the corner of 16th Street and Prospect Park West. Auggie takes a photograph of the store from across the street at 8:30am every morning. A recently-widowed writer Paul Benjamin (William Hurt) sees his wife in one of the pictures, and breaks down. Later, he is saved from being run down by a truck by a young black man named Rashid (Harold Perrineau Jr.), whom he invites to stay in his apartment. Rashid accepts, saying he was recognised by robbers and his life is in danger. He tracks his father (Forest Whitaker) down to a small-town gas station, which he sketches. His father, not recognising him, befriends him, and Rashid gives his name as Paul Benjamin. Paul finds $5000 that Rashid has stashed in the apartment. Paul tracks Rashid down, and introduces himself to his father, who comments that Rashid and him share a name, and calls him out. Rashid admits that his real name is Thomas Jefferson Cole, which his father also has difficulty believing, as it is the name of his son. Rashid is hired to work at the tobacconist, but ruins a shipment of cigars when the sink overflows. He gives Auggie the $5000 to keep his job. Another thread has Auggie's old girlfriend (Stockard Channing) re-visit, asking for money for Felicity (Ashley Judd), who she implies is his daughter. Auggie later gives her the same $5000. The many story lines never really connect, except through Auggie. At the end of the film Auggie tells Paul a tender story about spending Christmas with a blind grandmother who at first thinks, and then pretends, he is her grandson. The story is based on writer Paul Auster's piece \\"Auggie Wren's Christmas Story\\", published in The New York Times on Christmas day, 1990. During and after the closing credits, Auggie's story is enacted in a poignant black-and- white sequence to the soundtrack of Tom Waits's Innocent When You Dream.

The Gergeti Trinity Church was built in the 14th century, and is the only cross-cupola church in Khevi province. The separate belltower dates from the same period as the church itself. Its isolated location on top of a steep mountain surrounded by the vastness of nature has made it a symbol for Georgia. The 18th century Georgian author Vakhushti Batonishvili wrote that in times of danger, precious relics from Mtskheta, including Saint Nino's Cross were brought here for safekeeping. During the Soviet era, all religious services were prohibited, but the church remained a popular tourist destination. The church is now an active establishment of the Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church. The church is a popular waypoint for trekkers in the area, and can be reached by a steep 1.5 hour climb up the mountain.

Based in Clayton, Missouri, it has branches across North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia and Oceania. History Alamo was founded in Florida in 1974. In 1996, Alamo was acquired by Republic Industries (later renamed AutoNation). AutoNation spun off its car rental properties as ANC Rental in 2000. ANC filed for bankruptcy a year later; its properties were sold to Vanguard Automotive Group (controlled by Cerberus Capital Management) in 2003. In 2005, Alamo introduced an online check-in system that allowed customers to submit registration information prior to arrival to bypass counter check-in. In 2007, Alamo‚Äôs parent company Vanguard was acquired by Enterprise Holdings, operator of the largest rental car company in North America, which operates the Alamo Rent A Car, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, and National Car Rental brands. Complaints and criticism Alamo Rent a Car has been criticized for not providing adequate access to/from terminal buildings to rental car lot for wheelchair users; according to the United States Department of Justice, Alamo was the subject of many such complaints; Alamo reached a settlement with the government regarding the complaints filed by the Department of Justice. There was a report in The Washington Post about problems with customers returning cars after hours; in one instance, a customer returned an undamaged car after hours, but Alamo claimed that it had been rear-ended and demanded an additional $785. Alamo dropped the claim after the renter threatened to take them to court. A report in the Denver Post described a snowbound passenger who was charged $950 per day by Alamo around Christmas time in an instance of apparent price gouging. A report in USA Today suggested that increases in rental car rates, which averaged 4% in 2013, were leading many rental car users to switch to taking taxis instead. Two automobile safety advocacy groups petitioned the Federal Trade Commission in 2010 to bar Enterprise Holdings, the parent company of Alamo, from renting out recalled vehicles that had not been fixed. Alamo was criticized in The New York Times for failing to provide information about insurance rates for its rental cars on its website.

He was the Union Home Minister of India, Governor of Bihar and was chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes from 2007‚Äì2010. Early life Buta Singh was born on 21 March 1934 in Mazhabi Sikh family at Mustafapur, Jalandhar district, Punjab, British India. He was educated at Lyallpur Khalsa College in Jalandhar, from where he was awarded a B.A. (Hons), and at Guru Nanak Khalsa College in Bombay, where he earned a M.A. Singh then gained a Ph.D. from Bundelkhand University. He married Manjit Kaur in 1964; the couple had three children. He worked as journalist before joining politics. He fought his first elections as an Akali Dal member and joined the Indian National Congress in the late 1960s at the time when that party was split. Political career Buta Singh was first elected to the Indian Parliament from the Sadhna constituency. He has been involved with the Congress party since Jawaharlal Nehru was Prime Minister and he was close to former Indian Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. He has been elected eight times as a member of the Lok Sabha in 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 10th, 12th and 13th Lok Sabha. He became General Secretary of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) General Secretary (1978-1980), Home Minister of India and later Governor of Bihar (2004-2006). Other portfolios that he has held include those for railways, commerce, parliamentary affairs, sports, shipping, agriculture, communications and housing. He was chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (ranked as Cabinet Minister) from 2007‚Äì2010. He has written a book Punjabi Speaking State - A Critical Analysis and a collection of articles on Punjabi literature and Sikh history. Indira Ganhi chose him to select a new party symbol when Congress was split. He was very closely involved with her in Operation Blue Star and as a minister he oversaw reconstruction of the Golden Temple following that exercise. His name was also in the finalists for the post of President of India along with Giani Zail Singh in the Indira era. He was also the chairperson of Asian Games organizing committee when the competition was held in India in 1982. He was involved in the Indian general election of 2014 from Jalore District. Controversies In 1998, as Communications Minister he was indicted in the JMM bribery case, and forced to resign. As the Governor of Bihar, Singh's decision to recommend the dissolution of the Bihar Assembly in 2005 was sharply criticised by the Supreme Court of India. The court ruled that Singh had acted in haste and misled the federal cabinet because he did not want a particular party claiming to form the government, to come to power. Singh however claimed that the party was resorting to unfair means to secure support to form the government. On 26 January 2006 Singh sent a fax to Abdul Kalam offering to resign his post. The next day he left office and was replaced temporarily by West Bengal governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi.

Executives of TVN Meteo: Agnieszka G√≥rniakowska, Agnieszka Cegielska, Maja Popielarska, Omenaa Mensah, Bart≈Çomiej Jƒôdrzejak, Tomasz Zubilewicz, Dorota Gardias and Hubert Radzikowski. History TVN Meteo began broadcasting on 10 May 2003. The program included mainly thematic weather forecasts. Over the time, programmes on health, animals, plants and weather anomalies were also added to the programming. Since March 2, 2009, the channel has been broadcasting in the 16:9 format. From 1 August 2009 to the end of 2012, esoteric bands produced by Kosmica TV were present on TVN Meteo. From February 2013 to 2015, after a month without esoteric broadcasts, Ezo TV broadcasts came into this place. From 2016, the afternoon esoteric band was replaced by the teleshopping band Telezakupy Mango, and at night, the esoteric program Klub Magii produced by Polcast Television. On 20 June 2011, the tvnmeteo.pl weather portal was launched. However, the official launch date was 21 June 2011. In July 2011, TVN Meteo also started broadcasting documentary programmes. From the very beginning, the station broadcast 24 hours a day. In October 2014, two new channels were announced: TVN Fabu≈Ça, a series and film channel, and TVN Sportive dedicated to health, fitness and physical activity. In December 2014, the broadcaster applied to the Krajowa Rada Radiofonii i Telewizji to suspend the concession procedure for TVN Sportive. However, the broadcaster did not resign from the project, but it was decided to transform the weather channel into a lifestyle and sports channel under the name TVN Meteo Active. The decision was explained by the partial exhaustion of the channel's formula and falling viewing figures. On 16 April 2015, the station underwent a rebranding and changed its name to TVN Meteo Active and received a new logo. The station combined previously broadcast weather services with new programmes such as sports, healthy lifestyle and eating, fitness and leisure activities.https://archive.is/20150130104042/http://www.sat- charts.eu/artykul,3168,TVN-Meteo-Activ-zastapi-TVN-Meteo-Zmiany-w- ramowce.html. However, weather forecasts were emitted mainly in the night hours. The TVN Meteo brand as a separate project was not abandoned. A separate portal TVNmeteo.pl with current weather forecast, weather information and social networking sites remained online. In 2016, TVN announced the rebranding of TVN Meteo Active, which on 7 January 2017 was transformed into HGTV, a channel dedicated to interior design and gardening. TVN Meteo Active was shut down on 7 January 2017. However, the broadcaster returned to TVN Meteo and a live web TV broadcast was launched, focusing entirely on the presentation of weather forecasts.

He was best known for his TV role as doctor Ben Casey and as Major Cliff Bricker in the 1968 war film The Devil's Brigade.  Early Life  Edwards was born in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, New York City, New York, to Julia and Vincento Zoine, an Italian- American bricklayer. He and his twin brother, Anthony, were the youngest of seven children. He studied aviation mechanics at East New York Vocational High School, graduating in June 1945. An excellent swimmer, he worked as a lifeguard at Coney Island and swam for the Flatbush Boys Club. He was a standout on his high school swim team, also playing on the school's baseball and track teams. He studied at Ohio State University on an athletic scholarship. He was part of the university's swim team that won the United States National Championships. After two years at Ohio State, he transferred to the University of Hawaii where he spent much time training as a swimmer for the Olympics. At university, he was involved in theater productions. Career Edwards as Ben Casey, with guest star Sammy Davis, Jr. (1963) Edwards studied acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts; his classmates included Anne Bancroft, John Cassavetes, and Grace Kelly. In 1950, he was signed to a contract by Paramount Pictures, making his film debut as Vincent Edwards in 1951's Mister Universe. The following year he played the lead role in Hiawatha. Although he had major roles in several films, including film noirs The Killing (1956) and Murder by Contract (1958), it was not until he was featured as the title character in the highly successful Ben Casey television series that he achieved stardom. The medical drama, which he occasionally directed, ran from 1961 to 1966. As a result of the show's success and his own popularity, Edwards released several music albums and appeared in the all-star war film The Victors in 1963. He was represented by one of Hollywood's first \\"super agents\\", Abby Greshler of Diamond Artists in Hollywood. When the Ben Casey television series ended, Edwards returned to acting in motion pictures with a major role in the 1968 war drama The Devil's Brigade, together with films such as Hammerhead (1968), The Desperados (1969), and The Mad Bomber (1973). In 1970, Edwards starred in another TV series, the short-lived Matt Lincoln. In 1983, he played the main protagonist, Hawk, in the sci-fi film Space Raiders. He continued to act in film as well as in guest spots on television, including roles in The Rhinemann Exchange (1977), Evening in Byzantium (1978), and the pilot episode of Knight Rider, Knight Of The Phoenix in 1982. He directed a number of episodes in a variety of television series including the original Battlestar Galactica. He was also the voice of Jake Rockwell in the 1986 animated series Centurions. Twenty-two years after the series ended, Edwards returned to television as Dr. Ben Casey in a 1988 TV movie, The Return of Ben Casey. He made his last film, The Fear, in 1995. After the filming he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. During his acting career he ventured occasionally into the recording studios and there were a number of singles released in his name. Sadly, the most important one was never issued and in 1959 Ray Peterson was credited with the first version of 'The Wonder of You' which became an International Hit for him and Elvis Presley - however, the very first recording was made by Vince Edwards. Gambling Edwards was a compulsive gambler for many years, acknowledging the fact to a longtime friend, director William Friedkin, who said that he had \\"sacrificed a good portion of his career to an addiction\\". In his last years, Edwards and his wife Janet attempted to educate others about the dangers of gambling. After his death, his wife said, \\"One of the messages that Vince wanted to share is that gambling is NOT glamorous, despite today's suave- sounding euphemisms, such as 'gaming. Death Edwards died of pancreatic cancer in Los Angeles, California, on March 11, 1996; he was buried at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

He won the Olympic title in 1996, three consecutive world championships (1991, 1993, 1995), and set the world record in 1992.  Early life  O'Brien was born in Portland, Oregon in 1966. He is of African American and Finnish heritage, and grew up as an adopted child in an Irish- American family in Klamath Falls. He graduated from Henley High School in 1984 and then attended the University of Idaho in Moscow, where he competed in track and field for the Vandals. After initially flunking out of the university and then incurring legal difficulties, O'Brien attended Spokane Falls Community College, a community college in Spokane, Washington in 1987-1988. He returned to the UI to compete for the Vandal track and complete his bachelor's O'Brien trained for his Olympic and world championships on the Palouse under Idaho's track coach Mike Keller, and Rick Sloan of Washington State in neighboring Pullman for the field O'Brien competed at the U.S. Olympic Trials in 1988; after a fast time in the 100 meters, he was injured in the long jump and withdrew. He took second place at the Goodwill Games in Seattle in 1990, behind Dave Johnson. Career =Olympics= As the 1991 world champion, O'Brien entered the Olympic year of 1992 as the favorite to win gold in the decathlon in Barcelona and be proclaimed as the \\"world's greatest athlete.\\" However, during the U.S. Olympic Trials at Tad Gormley Stadium in New Orleans in late June, O'Brien had a disaster in the eighth event, the pole vault. After passing at the first four (lower) heights, O'Brien entered the competition at , and failed to clear the bar on all three attempts. As a result, he scored no points and dropped from first to eleventh place among the 24 decathletes. He did not make the Olympic team for Barcelona, but he continued to train for the competition held in France a few weeks after the Olympics ended. O'Brien's \\"no height\\" in the pole vault was also a financial embarrassment for his main corporate sponsor, and for NBC television which was heavily promoting the upcoming Olympics. He appeared with U.S. rival Dave Johnson, the Goodwill Games champion, in a popular TV advertising campaign for Reebok. The series of commercials, entitled \\"Dan & Dave,\\" were meant to build interest in Reebok and the decathletes, culminating in the Olympics in Barcelona. O'Brien's unexpected failure in New Orleans received considerable attention; Reebok adjusted by running new ads featuring him cheering on Dave, who went on to win the bronze medal. O'Brien regrouped and set a world record of 8,891 points in early September in Talence, France. His marks were as follows: 100 meters in 10.43 seconds (with a tailwind); Long Jump 26 ft 6¬º in (8.08 m); Shot Put 54 ft 9¬º in (16.69 m); High Jump 6 ft 9¬Ω in (2.07 m); 400 meters 48.51 seconds, for a first day total of 4,720 points; Day two 110 Meter High Hurdles in 13.98 seconds; Discus 159 ft 4 inches (48.56m); Pole Vault 16 ft 4¬æ in (5.00 m); Javelin 205 ft 4 in (62.58m); 1,500 meter run in 4 minutes 42.10 seconds = total 8,891 points). This stood as the world record until 1999, and the American record for nearly twenty years, until Ashton Eaton broke it in 2012 at the U.S. Olympic Trials in Eugene, Oregon. O'Brien was in attendance at Hayward Field and congratulated Eaton shortly after he completed the 1500 meters for a new world record of 9,039 points. At the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, O'Brien won the gold medal with 8,824 points, 118 ahead of runner-up Frank Busemann of Germany. After a break from competition, he won the Goodwill Games title in 1998, held east of New York City on Long Island, his eleventh consecutive win since 1992. A plantar fascia injury to his left foot in July 2000, shortly before the U.S. Olympic Trials, caused his withdrawal and he did not defend his title. Injuries continued and prevented his return to the Olympic trials in 2004. =Other athletics= O'Brien broke the world record for the fastest game of hopscotch on Chelsea Piers on May 7, 2009. He established a record of 81 seconds, breaking the old mark by two seconds. Shortly following the 2010 MLB season, O'Brien began working with San Francisco Giants third baseman Pablo Sandoval, in an effort to help the struggling slugger lose weight. =Modeling/Product endorsements= In the late 1990s, Dan O'Brien appeared in ads for Italian designer Versace. =Literature= On June 1, 2012, O'Brien released a book which was co-written with Brad Botkin, \\"Clearing Hurdles: The Quest to Be The World's Greatest Athlete\\" (). = Podcast = O'Brien and Dave Johnson are the subject of (and participants in) the ESPN Radio 30 for 30 podcast \\"The Trials of Dave and Dan\\" Personal life O'Brien has been a resident of the Phoenix area since 1997, relocating from northern Idaho. He owns Gold Medal Acceleration, a gym in Scottsdale, is a volunteer track coach at ASU, and does commentary for track and field events on television. Honors and awards O'Brien won the Olympic gold medal for decathlon at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, and also won gold medals at the 1991, 1993, and 1995 World Championships in Athletics. Shortly after his gold medal performance at the 1996 Olympics, O'Brien was honored with \\"Dan O'Brien Day\\" by the state of Idaho and a parade by the city of Moscow in mid-August. O'Brien was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 2005, along with Dave Johnson. He was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 2006, the University of Idaho Sports Hall of Fame with the large inaugural class of 2007, and the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2012.http://www.usatf.org/News/Devers,-O‚ÄôBrien,-Temple,-Connolly-selected-to- U-S-.aspx A street in Klamath Falls was named for him 1996, and Henley High School honored O'Brien by renaming its football field after the athlete in 2010.

In this way, users of a particular application may access remote resources in the same manner in which they would access their own local resources. An example of this is cloud storage, where remote files are presented as being locally accessible, and cloud computing where the resource in question is processing. X Window The term is often partially correctly applied in the context of the X Window System, which is able to transmit graphical data over the network and integrate it seamlessly with applications running and displaying locally; however, certain extensions of the X Window System are not capable of working over the network. Databases In a centralized database system, the only available resource that needs to be shielded from the user is the data (that is, the storage system). In a distributed DBMS, a second resource needs to be managed in much the same manner: the network. Preferably, the user should be protected from the network operational details. Then there would be no difference between database applications that would run on the centralized database and those that would run on a distributed one. This kind of transparency is referred to as network transparency or distribution transparency. From a database management system (DBMS) perspective, distribution transparency requires that users do not have to specify where data is located. Some have separated distribution transparency into location transparency and naming transparency. Location transparency in commands used to perform a task is independent both of the locations of the data, and of the system on which an operation is carried out. Naming transparency means that a unique name is provided for each object in the database. Firewalls Transparency in firewall technology can be defined at the networking (IP or Internet layer) or at the application layer. Transparency at the IP layer means the client targets the real IP address of the server. If a connection is non-transparent, then the client targets an intermediate host (address), which could be a proxy or a caching server. IP layer transparency could be also defined from the point of server's view. If the connection is transparent, the server sees the real client IP. If it is non-transparent, the server sees the IP of the intermediate host. Transparency at the application layer means the client application uses the protocol in a different way. An example of a transparent HTTP request for a server: GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: example.org Connection: Keep-Alive An example non-transparent HTTP request for a proxy (cache): GET http://foo.bar/ HTTP/1.1 Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive Application layer transparency is symmetric when the same working mode is used on both the sides. The transparency is asymmetric when the firewall (usually a proxy) converts server type requests to proxy type or vice versa. Transparency at the IP layer does not mean automatically application layer transparency.

Early life and education Adam Wilhelm Moltke was born on 25 August 1785 at Einsiedelsborg on the island of Funen, the son of Prime Minister Joachim Godske Moltke. His paternal grandfather was Adam Gottlob Moltke, the influential Lord Steward and companion of Frederik V of Denmark. As a child, Moltke was tutored by Jacob Peter Mynster, who later became the bishop of Zealand. Career He was known as a humane and patriarchal squire but was no outstanding political figure. From 1845, he was Minister of Financial Affairs. At the fall of the last absolute government, he too was dismissed but, a few days later, he was persuaded to form the new national government as the most suitable leader both as for his social position and as for his moderate views. =Prime minister of Denmark= The cabinet created on 22 March 1848 was called the March Cabinet. On 16 November 1848 it was replaced by the November Cabinet, which in turn was replaced by the July Cabinet on 13 July 1851, which again was replaced by the October Cabinet on 18 October 1851. The cabinet, originally a Conservative-Liberal one, gradually became more and more openly conservative both because of the general liberal withdrawal and because of foreign pressure. On 27 January 1852, Christian Albrecht Bluhme replaced Moltke as Prime Minister. Property Moltke succeeded his father as Count of Bregentved in 1818. He was also the owner of Merl√∏segaard north of Ringsted and Sofiedal. Personal life Molke was married twice. First to Frederikke Louise Knuth (1797-1819).

The emperor found him there and defeated Yeshaq, then turned south to Emfraz where he defeated the remaining supporters of Tazkaro on 2 July 1561.

The name derives from Indiana, nicknamed the \\"Hoosier State,\\" which was the original home of many pioneers. U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service sign at Hoosier Pass, May 29, 2006 The pass is located on the Continental Divide at the northern end of the Mosquito Range, in a gap between Mount Lincoln (west) and Hoosier Ridge (east). It sits on the boundary between Park (south) and Summit (north) counties. The pass provides a route between the headwaters of the Blue River (tributary of the Colorado River) to the north and the headwaters of the South Platte River in South Park to the south. It is traversed by State Highway 9 between the towns of Breckenridge (north) and Fairplay (south). The highway over the pass provides an alternative route from Denver to the ski areas near Breckenridge and Keystone. It is generally open all year round, is traversable by all vehicles in good weather, but is occasionally closed during winter storms. The road over the pass has a smooth approach on the south side but has several switchbacks on the north side with a grade of 8%. This pass is the highest point on the TransAmerica Trail, a transcontinental bicycle route that stretches from Yorktown, Virginia to Astoria, Oregon. Water diversion Hoosier Pass is the location of the oldest known transbasin diversion project in Colorado, a ditch diverting water from a tributary of the Blue River to the Middle Fork of the South Platte River. This water was used for placer mining above Alma.Water Development History, Colorado Division of Water Resources, Mar. 2012; accessed August 2015. By 1929, the 1.8 mile (2.9 km) East Hoosier Ditch and the 1.3 mile (2 km) West Hoosier Ditch were in operation, able to divert an aggregate 77 cubic feet per second (2.2 m3/s) of water across the continental divide. The City of Colorado Springs obtained the water rights to these ditches and constructed the Hoosier Pass Tunnel to replace them as part of the Continental-Hoosier Diversion System. The 10 foot (3 m) diameter 1.5 mile (2.4 km) water tunnel was completed in 1951 and delivers up to 500 cubic feet per second (14.2m3/s) to the Montgomery Reservoir about a mile southwest of the pass, from which the water is piped 70 miles (113 km) to Colorado Springs. Average annual diversions through the tunnel have been on the order of 9000 acre feet (11 million m3).John N.

Though the original culture may fade, the mother culture's influence grows for ages in the future. Later civilizations either learn and build upon their old ways, or can learn them through peaceful or military assimilation. Although the term is used by anthropologists and archaeologists, it is used sparingly, since it oversimplifies and in some cases even misrepresents the relationships between cultures. The most frequently cited examples of mother cultures are Ancient Egypt in the Mediterranean, and the Olmec in Mesoamerica. Daniel Quinn In the work of Daniel Quinn‚Äîfirst mentioned in his 1992 philosophical novel, Ishmael‚ÄîMother Culture is used as a collective term for any given culture's most influencing features (its philosophies, attitudes, values, viewpoints, etc.) that, however, are usually not consciously recognized as being culturally-specific by the members of that culture. In other words, Mother Culture is the set of \\"unquestioned influences\\" or \\"hidden premises\\" that the members of a culture merely take for granted as being universally true (rather than, in fact, being culturally-specific), and that largely determine (1) how the members of that culture experience and view the world, and, therefore, (2) how they actually behave in the world. Because every person is culturally biased to a greater or lesser extent, Quinn reasons that every culture must have a certain crucial element that instills in its members this firm position of bias: this is Mother Culture. Quinn often uses the term Mother Culture as a feminine personification. According to Quinn, every Mother Culture feeds its followers a particular, culturally-skewed mythology that greatly influences how these people perceive themselves and their environment. Mother Culture works to uphold (and to pacify any dissent against) the culture and its specific worldview. Quinn claims that \\"every culture has a Mother Culture\\" but warns that in a self-destructive culture like our own globalized civilization, Mother Culture's promotion of the status quo amounts to captivity, in which we are unable to fathom any alternative lifestyles other than the one Mother Culture tells us to live out (because we cannot think beyond the hidden premises our culture lives by‚Äîthe cultural \\"truths\\" that Mother Culture insists are unquestionable). Unfortunately, because we, as a culture, are destroying the Earth, while many of us would wish to stop this destruction, Quinn asserts that we cannot seem to find the \\"bars\\" of our proverbial cage because Mother Culture has given us certain assumptions that we assume without question, never recognizing them as false from the start. Quinn has frequently claimed that two of the most fundamental (but false) premises communicated to us by our Mother Culture, in particular, include the following: \\"There is only one right way to live: ours\\" and \\"We must cling to civilization at all costs, even if it kills us.\\"Interview: Saving the World One Meme at a Time. http://www.blogtalkradio.com/envision-this/2013/03/13/daniel-quinn-on-saving- the-world-one-meme-at-a-time Quinn further describes such premises in his discussion on memes in Beyond Civilization.

A worldwide multidisciplinary effort has been ongoing since 1974 to define such important metrics. The points and strata need be widespread and contain an identifiable sequence of layers or other unambiguous marker (identifiable or quantifiable) attributes. GSSAs, and the generally more recent and preferred benchmark GSSPs are defined by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) under the auspices of their parent organization, the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), and are used primarily for time dating of rock layers older than 630 million years ago, lacking a good fossil record. The ICS first attempts to meet the standards of the GSSPs (see below) and if those fail, usually have enough information to make a preliminary selection of several competing GSSA prospects or proposals. The geologic record becomes spotty prior to about 542 million years ago. This is because the Earth's crust in geological time scales is constantly being recycled by tectonic and weathering forces, and older rocks and especially readily accessible exposed strata that can act as a time calibration are rare. For more recent periods, a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP), largely based on paleontology and improved methods of fossil dating, is used to define such boundaries. In contrast to GSSAs, GSSPs are based on important events and transitions within a particular stratigraphic section. In older sections, there is insufficient fossil record or well preserved sections to identify the key events necessary for a GSSP, so GSSAs are defined based on fixed dates and selected criteria.

When she learned of her father's identity she decided to live as her father and to find Tyrfing, the magic sword. =Summoning the dead= wakes her father 's ghost from his barrow to demand the cursed sword One day, she arrived with her fleet to Munarv√°gr on Sams√∏ (Samsey), but she was the only one who dared to embark on the haunted island. The remainder of her crew feared the nightly activities around the barrows on the island. As she approached the barrows she saw a fire shining above them, and she approached the largest one. She then talked with a loud voice summoning her father Angantyr to reveal himself. She said that as his daughter she was entitled to her rightful inheritance, Tyrfing. Then, she also summoned her eleven uncles and she did so with such a loud voice and such harsh words that finally, her father's voice was heard and he asked not to pursue her quest. She did not give in but continued to ask for her rightful inheritance. Finally, the grave opened and in its centre a fire was shining. There she saw her father, and he warned her not to ask for the sword. It would bring death to their whole clan if she used it. Still, she persisted. Finally the sword was cast out of the grave, and she eagerly gripped it, bid farewell to her dead kinsmen and walked to the shore. However, when she arrived at the shore, the ships were gone. Her crew had been scared away by the fires and the thunder from the barrows. =Career= Eventually, she managed to leave the island and arrived at the court of Gudmund of Gl√¶sisvellir. She still dressed herself as a man and called herself Hervar√∞r. Cunningly, she helped the king to win playing tafl. However, she also slew a courtier who tried to unsheathe Tyrfing after she had left it on a chair. Then, she resumed her Viking activities, and travelled far and wide. =Settling down= After a while she grew tired of the adventures and returned to her foster-father Bjartmar. At Bjartmar's residence, she betook herself to sewing and embroidering like other girls, and was considered to be a beautiful and good-mannered girl. King Gudmund's son H√∂fund, then arrived to ask for her hand, and she said yes. The old king Gudmund arranged a grand wedding, and entrusted the kingdom in the hands of the young couple. They lived happily and had two sons who were given the names Angantyr and Heidrek. The sword Tyrfing would continue its ill work, and Heidrek slew his brother Angantyr with the sword. For the continued adventures of Tyrfing, see Heidrek. Hervor, Daughter of Heidrek Heidrek had a daughter who he named Hervor. She was a shieldmaiden and was the commander of a Gothic fort facing Myrkvi√∞r, and she would fall in battle against the Huns (see Hl√∂d, Hl√∂√∞skvi√∞a). When her foster-father Ormar reported Hervor's death to king Angantyr, he said: {  :Sunnan em ek kominn :at segja spj√∂ll √æessi: :svi√∞in er √∂ll m√∂rk :ok Myrkvi√∞ar hei√∞r, :drifin √∂ll Go√∞√æj√≥√∞ :gumna bl√≥√∞i. :Mey veit ek Hei√∞reks, :systur √æ√≠na, :svigna til jar√∞ar; :hafa H√∫nar :hana fellda :ok marga a√∞ra :y√∞ra √æegna, :l√©ttari ger√∞ist h√∫n at b√∂√∞ :en vi√∞ bi√∞il r√¶√∞a' :e√∞a √≠ bekk at fara :at br√∫√∞ar gangi.  :\\"From the south I've come :to say this news: :burnt is Mirkwood Heath :and the whole forest, :Goth- folk all blotched :with blood of men. :Down, I hear, :is Heidrek's lass; :heard your sister, :the Huns felled her -- :and of your people :plenty more. :More cheery in battle :than chatting to suitors :or taking the bench :at a bridal feast.\\"  } When King Angantyr heard this, he grinned and was slow to speak, but at last he said: :√ìbr√≥√∞urliga vartu leikin, in √°g√¶ta systir. :\\"Unbrotherly the bloody game they played with you, excellent sister.\\" References Sources *Herikson, Alf.

Drucker is the only resident of Hooterville to be a regular character in both Petticoat Junction and Green Acres. He is a supporting character in Petticoat Junction, but more of a main character in Green Acres, where he seems to be perhaps the only truly sane person. The New York Times describes Sam Drucker as \\"a bit of a straight man to the colorfully zany folk\\" of Hooterville.Slotnik, Daniel E. \\"Frank Cady, Kept Store on ‚ÄòGreen Acres,‚Äô Dies at 96\\" June 11, 2012 The New York Times retrieved October 22, 2015 However, like other Hootervillians, he sees nothing unusual in the fact that Fred and Doris Ziffel's \\"son\\" Arnold is a pig that understands spoken English language, and whose grunts and squeals are understood by others. Drucker is provincial, but fairly intelligent. He earns a modest living, and he sleeps in the back room of the general store. In the Green Acres episode \\"Milk Machine\\", Mr. Haney and Fred Ziffel ask Drucker for five hundred dollars to invest in a milk making machine. When he tells them he doesn't have the money, Mr. Haney suggests getting a mortgage on the general store. Drucker tells him that he already has six mortgages on his store and is \\"working on a seventh.\\" Much ado is made of Sam Drucker's baldness. In one episode, he dons a toupee for a photograph and notes that it is the first time he has worn it since high school. In another episode, he states, \\"We Druckers skin out early.\\" And in the Green Acres episode \\"The Agricultural Student\\", Sam throws on his toup√© and says he is \\"Young Sam Drucker\\" when a young blonde co-ed named Terry Harper needs a date for the barn dance. Besides being the town grocer, Sam Drucker is also Hooterville's postmaster, constable, Justice of the Peace, and Superintendent of Schools. And he is the editor, publisher, and apparently sole employee of the Hooterville World-Guardian, the town's weekly newspaper. He operates a \\"bank\\", which is merely a cash box kept under the counter in his store. In addition, Drucker is a fireman with the Hooterville Volunteer Fire Department, and plays the bass drum in the Hooterville Volunteer Fire Department Band. Drucker's Store Drucker's is an old-fashioned small town general store, the kind where the grocer retrieves many of the items from shelves behind the counter.Jolley, Harmon \\"What Did That Building Used To Be: 326-28 Vine Street\\" August 3, 2005 The Chattanoogan retrieved October 22, 2015 Sam Drucker sells food and household goods, and at times sells such oddities as nail polish that's also a bathtub sealant, as well as dehydrated chickens: \\"Just add water and bones, and let it sit for a couple hours.\\" Greene, Doyle Politics and the American Television Comedy: A Critical Survey from I Love Lucy Through South Park p. 107 (2007) McFarland Customers are allowed to shop on credit, although Drucker frequently (and exasperatedly) reminds them of their outstanding bills. Drucker's Store is the closest thing Hooterville has to a social club.Slotnik, Daniel E. \\"Frank Cady, Kept Store on ‚ÄòGreen Acres,‚Äô Dies at 96\\" June 11, 2012 The New York Times retrieved October 22, 2015 The locals often come in to chit-chat, or to play checkers, or to rant and rave about community issues. And, on election day, they cast their votes at Drucker's. Exterior shots of the store show a sign that says \\"Sam Drucker's General Store\\", but everyone (including Sam Drucker) mostly calls the store either \\"Drucker's Store\\" or just \\"Drucker's\\". Drucker's Store is also the Hooterville post office. One of Sam Drucker's quirks is that he insists on putting on his official postal worker hat and standing behind a small regulation post office grille next to the register whenever his role switches from storekeeper to postmaster. Drucker takes great pride in his association with the Post Office Department, and he's also very pleased that his patrons must come to his store to get their mail. In the 1960s, post offices were often situated in stores in rural areas, and some still exist even today. The Green Acres episode \\"Old Mail Day\\" is about the day when Hootervillians gather to receive the old mail that Sam Drucker finds when he cleans his store. One such letter is from 1917. Fred Ziffel learns he has been drafted to fight in World War I.Rodell, Chris Use All the Crayons!: The Colorful Guide to Simple Human Happiness p. 36 There is no Rural Free Delivery (RFD) in Hooterville. When new resident Oliver Douglas petitions his Congressman for it to be initiated, Drucker is shocked to learn that an obscure (and fictitious) postal regulation requires him to carry the entire route himself -- by bicycle. (This situation is, obviously, soon corrected.)

It is headquartered in New York City, and its president and chief executive officer is Adena Friedman. Nasdaq's largest shareholder is the Swedish Wallenberg family through Investor AB, a holding company that one of Nasdaq's stock exchanges also lists (). The Wallenberg family's involvement in Nasdaq originates from Nasdaq's merger with OMX, in which Investor AB is the largest shareholder. History Nasdaq, Inc. is the owner of the NASDAQ listing, founded in 1975. = Merger attempt with London Stock Exchange = In December 2005, the London Stock Exchange Group (LSE) rejected a ¬£1.6 billion takeover offer from Macquarie Bank. The LSE described the offer as \\"derisory\\". It then received a bid in March 2006 for ¬£2.4 billion from NASDAQ, which was also rejected by the LSE. NASDAQ later pulled its bid, and less than two weeks later on April 11, 2006, struck a deal with LSE's largest shareholder, Ameriprise Financial's Threadneedle Asset Management unit, to acquire all of that firm's stake, consisting of 35.4 million shares, at ¬£11.75 per share. NASDAQ also purchased 2.69 million additional shares, resulting in a total stake of 15%. While the seller of those shares was undisclosed, it occurred simultaneously with a sale by Scottish Widows of 2.69 million shares. The move was seen as an effort to force LSE to negotiate either a partnership or eventual merger, as well as to block other suitors such as NYSE Euronext, owner of the New York Stock Exchange. Subsequent purchases increased NASDAQ's stake to 29%, holding off competing bids for several months. However, only a further 0.4% of shareholders accepted the offer by the deadline and therefore the offer was rejected on February 10, 2007. =Boston and Philadelphia Exchanges purchase= On October 2, 2007, NASDAQ purchased the Boston Stock Exchange. On November 7, NASDAQ announced an agreement to purchase the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. =OMX purchase= On May 25, 2007, NASDAQ agreed to buy OMX, the Swedish-Finnish financial company that controls 7 Nordic and Baltic stock exchanges, for US$3.7 billion to form NASDAQ OMX Group.

The first 3 companies announced as part of the program are Chain, a blockchain technology company; Digital Reasoning, cognitive computing technology; and Hanweck, real-time risk analytics. =Bid for Oslo Stock Exchange= During Christmas of 2018, shareholders representing 25% of Oslo B√∏rs VPS Holding (the Norwegian Stock Exchange and national CSD operator) held a private auction of share sale. Nasdaq did not participate in the auction due to the hostile nature of the bid (held without Oslo B√∏rs boards knowledge or approval). Euronext won the auction, and later secured another 24.6% of shareholder support, totalling 49.6%. Following this, Nasdaq acquired 32.5% shares in open market (mainly from individual shareholders/employees), and submitted an official bid, with unanimous recommendations from board and some key shareholders, to acquire remaining shares for 152 NOK, and later increased offer to 158 NOK (or almost 44% premium of Dec 17th, 2018 closing price, to mach Euronext offer), additionally making the case to Norway's markets regulator that in cases like this, 2/3 of the share control may be necessary to comply with any applicable regulatory requirement. In the end the regulator did not side with the two-thirds requirements, and general majority was deemed to be applicable. Euronext by that time had acquired or secured control of 50.5% shares, and Nasdaq had announced on May 25, 2019 that they were pulling out of the Oslo B√∏rs battle, handing Euronext the victory.

He was elected king by the Shewan commanders of the army and the Dowager Empress. Upon his coming of age Bahr negus Yeshaq, who had rebelled against his father, presented himself to Sarsa Dengel and made peace. However, Sarsa Dengel had to confront a number of other revolts: his cousin Hamalmal in 1563, another cousin Fasil two years later. Yeshaq once again revolted with support of the Ottoman Empire; Sarsa Dengel then marched to Tigray in 1576, where he defeated and killed in battle the Bahr Negash and his allies, √ñzdemir Pasha and Sultan Muhammed IV of Harar. When the Ottomans attempted to advance inland to capture Debarwa in 1588, Emperor Sarsa Dengel responded by sacking Arqiqo the following year. Sarsa Dengel was the first emperor of Ethiopia to confront the encroachment of the Oromo and campaigning in the south, Sarsa Dengel defeated the Oromo in a battle near Lake Zway. He campaigned against them again in his 15th (1578) and 25th (1588) regnal years. Sarsa Dengel campaigned against the Beta Israel in Semien province in 1580, and again in 1585.

He was designated to become president of global banking, securities, and wealth management at the newly combined company, but resigned on January 22, 2009. Ken Lewis, CEO of Bank of America, reportedly forced Thain to step down after several controversies, such as the losses at Merrill Lynch which proved to be far larger than previously estimated, and the award of huge executive bonuses.

The deal valued the brokerage at $50 billion. Thain was expected to be president of global banking, securities and wealth management, a new division at Bank of America, to oversee its corporate and investment bank and most of wealth management business. Compensation In December 2003, interim chairman John Reed at the New York Stock Exchange told The Wall Street Journal that Thain would be paid \\"a plain vanilla number\\", about $4 million a year including bonus, with no \\"strange retirement\\" program like the one former NYSE CEO Dick Grasso was given. Upon joining Merrill Lynch, Thain received a $15 million signing bonus. The firm announced that Thain would receive at least $50 million a year and could be paid as much as $120 million a year, based on the company's stock price. The Associated Press identified Thain, who received $83.1 million, as one of the best paid executives of S&P; 500 companies in 2007. In that year, Thain earned a total compensation of $83,785,021, which included a base salary of $750,000, a cash bonus of $15,000,000, stock grant of $33,013,151, and options grant of $35,017,421.CEO Compensation for John A. Thain, Equilar.com Thain suggested to the directors that he receive a bonus in 2008 of as much as $10 million, because he \\"saved Merrill\\" by selling it off to Bank of America. After the compensation committee at Merrill refused the request, Thain reportedly dropped it on December 8, 2008. It was revealed on January 22, 2009 that Thain spent $1.22 million of corporate funds in early 2008 to renovate two conference rooms, a reception area, and his office, spending $131,000 for area rugs, $68,000 for an antique credenza, $87,000 for guest chairs, $35,115 for a gold-plated commode on legs, and $1,100 for a wastebasket. Thain subsequently apologized for his lapse in judgment, and reimbursed the company in full for the costs. Thain accelerated approximately $4 billion in bonus payment to employees at Merrill just prior to the close of the deal with Bank of America. Bank of America was aware of the payment, as allowing the payment to go through was reportedly one of the conditions under the merger agreement. Speculation mounted that some of TARP fund was used for the bonus payment, but TARP recipients are yet to disclose how the funds were segregated, or what they were used for. Sheila Bair, chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reported that during a meeting with the Treasury secretary at the depth of the financial panic, Thain asked the secretary if the TARP program would impact his compensation.The Grimmest Story You'll Hear Today about Wall Street Compensation, by Elliot Spritzer, September 27, 2012, Slate Departure from Bank of America On January 16, 2009, Bank of America announced that Merrill suffered an unexpected loss of $15 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008. Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis said that, without $138 billion in government assistance, including the infusion of $20 billion from the federal government, he would have pulled out of the Merrill deal, which had been approved by Bank of America shareholders in early December. People close to Lewis say his relationship with Thain was strained by Merrill's massive fourth quarter loss. Lewis himself faced criticism for rushing to buy Merrill for $28 billion after less than two days of due diligence. On January 22, 2009, on CNBC's The Call, Charlie Gasparino said that Thain was going to meet Lewis later in the day. Gasparino added that Thain's future at Bank of America was in doubt, although it was not certain whether he would be leaving. Gasparino then said that Thain spent $1.22 million to refurbish his office, shortly after he had been named as CEO of Merrill in January 2008. Merrill was still an independent firm at the time, and some analysts predicted that, with Thain as new CEO, the company would be back on track for a strong performance in the midst of disappointing results on Wall Street. The tension between Thain and Lewis had been building since mid-December and culminated on January 22, 2009 when Lewis flew to New York to meet with Thain. After a 15-minute conversation between the two men, Thain agreed to resign. Criticism of excessive compensation On January 23, 2009, President Obama referred to John Thain by saying \\"the reports that we‚Äôve seen over the last couple of days about companies that have received taxpayer assistance then going out and renovating bathrooms or offices or in other ways not managing those dollars appropriately.\\" Obama's press secretary Robert Gibbs also said taxpayer money shouldn't go to \\"line the pockets of people\\" who've gotten financial assistance. \\"The American people need to be greatly assured that their hard-earned money is not going to the bonuses or the remodeling of an office at a bank that's in trouble,\\" Gibbs said. On January 29, 2009, President Obama publicly criticized the large bonuses such as those handed out by Thain. Obama said: \\"I saw an article today indicating that Wall Street bankers had given themselves $20 billion worth of bonuses at a time when most of these institutions were teetering on collapse and they are asking for taxpayers to help sustain them, and when taxpayers find themselves in the difficult position that if they don't provide help that the entire system could come down on top of our heads‚Äîthat is the height of irresponsibility. It is shameful. And part of what we're going to need is for folks on Wall Street who are asking for help to show some restraint and show some discipline and show some sense of responsibility. The American people understand that we've got a big hole that we've got to dig ourselves out of‚Äîbut they don't like the idea that people are digging a bigger hole even as they're being asked to fill it up.\\" Vice President Joe Biden also said the bonuses \\"offends the sensibilities. I mean, I'd like to throw these guys in the brig.\\" Criminal investigation On January 27, 2009, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo issued a subpoena to Thain in a probe into the bonuses he received just days before the Bank of America takeover. Charges of criminal fraud can be brought under the 1921 Marin Act against a person receiving an illicit executive payout. Post-Merrill career On the evening of February 7, 2010, Reuters reported that CIT Group had announced that it was hiring Thain to replace interim CEO Peter Tobin immediately. In 2013, CIT paid him $8.25 million. On October 21, 2015 CIT Group announced that chief executive officer John A.

He was the eldest surviving son of Sarsa Dengel. According to E. A. Wallis Budge, Yaqob's mother was Empress Maryam Sena; others sources suggest she was Emebet Harego of the Beta Israel. Because Yaqob had at least three sons before his death, it is likely he was born no later than 1590. Most Ethiopian sources including Tekle Tsadik Mekuria however state that his mother was Harego, but that Empress Maryam Sena championed his right to the throne as she only bore Emperor Sarsa Dengel daughters, and hoped to dominate a long term regency for the boy monarch. Life Sarsa Dengel had intended to make his nephew Za Dengel his successor, but under the influence of his wife Maryam Sena and a number of his sons-in-law, he instead chose Yaqob, who was seven when he came to the throne, with Ras Antenatewos of Begemder as his regent. Za Dengel and the other rival for the throne - Susenyos I, the son of Abeto Fasilides - were exiled, but Za Dengel escaped to the mountains around Lake Tana, while Susenyos I found refuge in the south amongst the Oromo. When Yaqob came to adulthood six years later, he quarrelled with Ras Antenatewos, and had him replaced with Ras Za Sellase. However, Za Sellase deposed Yaqob, exiling him to Ennarea, and made his cousin Za Dengel Emperor. When Za Dengel proved more troublesome than Yaqob, Za Sellase recalled Yaqob from exile. Not long after Za Dengel was defeated and killed in battle, Susenyos I marched north at the head of an army raised amongst the Oromo, and sent a message to Ras Antenatewos proclaiming himself as emperor and demanding support from Antenatewos. Unable to communicate with Za Sellase, the Ras sent his troops to support Susenyos I. A similar message to Za Sellase only served to steel Za Sellase into action: he marched on Susenyos I, who, sick from fever, retreated into the mountains of Amhara. This lack of resolve convinced Ras Antenatewos to waver in his support, and as the rainy season passed Za Sellase began to negotiate his submission to Susenyos I. At this moment Yaqob revealed himself in Dembiya and both Ras Antenatewos and Za Sellase flocked to his side. Susenyos I managed to first surprise and decimate the forces of Za Sellase at Manta Dafar in Begemder; when Za Sellase escaped to Yaqob's camp, the Emperor's derision caused Za Sellase to defect to Susenyos I. For several days, the armies of the two rival emperors maneuvered in the mountains of Gojjam, to at last meet in the Battle of Gol 10 March 1606, where Yaqob and the Coptic Archbishop Abuna Petros II were killed in battle, and his troops slaughtered.The date of this battle is taken from G.W.B. Huntingford, The historical geography of Ethiopia from the first century AD to 1704, (Oxford University Press: 1989), p. 158  Issue  Yaqob had married some years before a foreigner named Nazarena, by whom he had three sons, one of whom had died before the Battle of Gol. Nazarena sent her surviving sons to safety in exile: Cosmas, the older, went south and was not heard of again; the younger, Saga Krestos, went to the safety of the Kingdom of Sennar where he was treated well and came of age. When King Rabat proposed that Saga Krestos marry his daughter, Saga Krestos refused, and was forced to flee to another refuge, adopting Roman Catholicism while at Jerusalem. Eventually he found his way to Rome (1632), and eventually to Paris, where he was given lodgings by Cardinal Richelieu. Saga Krestos died of pleurisy in 1638 at the age of 38. Thomas Pakenham provides a brief sketch of Saga Krestos' European life in his The Mountains of Rasselas, and the book ends with a description of Pakenham's visit to Saga Krestos' grave in Rueil- Malmaison.Pakenham, The Mountains of Rasselas (New York: Reynal & Co., 1959), p. 192. Pakenham transliterates his name as \\"Zagachrist\\". However, O. G. S. Crawford has cast doubts on this story. In an article that discusses the surviving sources for the story of Saga Krestos, he points out a number of problems in his story which include a discrepancy over the possible date of his birth (i.e., Saga Krestos is likely to have been born in either 1610 or 1616, whereas Yaqob died in 1607), and the story of three Ethiopian monks who report that Saga Krestos was an apostate monk who wandered from place to place begging for money.Crawford, \\"The Strange Adventures of Zaga Christ\\", Sudan Notes and Records, 31 (1950), pp. 287-296.

The district is coterminous with the Ssese Islands in Lake Victoria and does not have territory on mainland Uganda. Like other Ugandan districts, it is named after its 'chief town', Kalangala which is located on Bugala Island, the largest of the Ssese Islands. Location Kalangala District is bordered by Mpigi District and Wakiso District to the north, Mukono District to the northeast and east, the Republic of Tanzania to the south, Rakai District to the southwest, Masaka District to the west and Kalungu District to the northwest.Uganda District Map The Kalangala district headquarters are located approximately , across water, southwest of Entebbe, in Wakiso District. The coordinates of the district are: 00 26S, 32 15E. Overview Kalangala District covers an area of , of which only (5.1%) is land and the rest is open water. The district is made up of eighty four widely scattered islands in the northwestern part of Lake Victoria of which only forty three are inhabited. The biggest island is Bugala Island which covers or 63.2% of the district land mass. Population The 1991 national population census estimated the district population at about 16,400. Eleven years later, the 2002 national census estimated the population of the district at approximately 34,800, with an annual population growth rate of 6.8%. In 2012, it was estimated that the population of Kalangala District was about 66,300. The table below illustrates the growth trajectory of the district population during the first decade of the 21st century. All numbers are estimates. Economic activities The three pillars of the district economy are: (a) fishing (b) tourism and (c) agriculture. The majority of the islanders depend a lot on fishing. The fishermen migrate following the seasonal movements of fish. Over fishing remains a concern. Due to its location, its climate and its relative isolation, the district is a tourist magnet. Tourist facilities are rudimentary in most areas, although improvements in infrastructure (accommodations, road networks, communications, electricity supply, piped water etc.) are slowly improving. Bidco Uganda, a private palm oil processor based in Jinja, maintains a controversial palm oil plantation in the district. In addition, out grower farmers grow palm oil on contract with Bidco and sell their produce to the processor. Livestock farming and logging are other economic activities practiced in the district. , it was estimated that the livestock count in the district stood as follows: *2,999 cattle, 250,000 poultry (chicken and ducks), 1,235 goats,and 7,000 pigs.

According to The Guardian in March 2015, the land grabbing issue has plagued the community of Kalangala for a number of years.

The community has taken the venture to court. David Balironda, the Kalangala district production officer, said he saw people being compensated. When asked why he had not objected to the inadequate compensation paid, he said: ‚ÄúIt was their agreement with the landlord. These people were squatters on someone‚Äôs land.

He was the son of Lesana Krestos, who was the brother of Sarsa Dengel. Za Dengel may have been married to Woizero Wangelawit, eldest daughter of his second cousin Susenyos (later emperor) and lady Wolde Saala of Walaqa and Marabete (later Empress Sultan Mogassa). Sarsa Dengel had intended to make his nephew as his heir, recognizing that to avert the civil war that would likely follow his death an adult would be needed, and the emperor's own sons were quite young. These plans were changed primarily through the influence of Empress Sena Maryam, stepmother of Emperor's eldest surviving son Prince Yaqob, who was made emperor in 1597. The empress had Za Dengel seized and confined in a religious retreat on the island of Dek in Lake Tana. Za Dengel eventually managed to escape, taking refuge in Gojjam. In 1603 Za Dengel was made Emperor by Ras Za Sellase, who intended Za Dengel to be little more than a figurehead. He was crowned as Asnaf Segad ('He to whom the horizons bow'). However, Za Dengel summoned the Jesuit Pedro P√°ez to his court at Dankaz, who persuaded him to embrace Catholicism. This religious conversion led to Za Sellase not only withdrawing his support, but actively working against him and stirred up a revolt in Gojjam. Za Dengel marched to the plain of Bartcho to put down this revolt, but despite the help of 200 Portuguese musketeers Za Dengel perished in battle on October 24.

It carries uptown (northbound) traffic as far as West 110th Street (also known as Cathedral Parkway), after which it continues as a two-way street. Geography Tenth Avenue begins a block below Gansevoort Street and Eleventh Avenue in the West Village / Meatpacking District. For the southernmost stretch (the four blocks below 14th Street), Tenth Avenue runs southbound. North of 14th Street, Tenth Avenue runs uptown (northbound) for 45 blocks as a one-way street. At its intersection with West 59th Street it becomes Amsterdam Avenue but continues without interruption, continuing as a one-way street northbound until Cathedral Parkway, where two- way traffic resumes. As Amsterdam Avenue, the thoroughfare stretches 129 blocks northnarrowing to one lane in each direction as it passes through Yeshiva University's Wilf Campus, between 184th and 186th Streetsbefore connecting with Fort George Avenue south of Highbridge Park at West 193rd Street. On the north side of Highbridge Park, unconnected to Amsterdam Avenue on the south side, Tenth Avenue then runs for slightly less than a mile from the northern terminus of the Harlem River Drive at Dyckman Street, to the intersection of West 218th Street where it merges into Broadway. History Tenth Avenue runs through the Chelsea and Hell's Kitchen neighborhoods on the west side of the borough, and then as Amsterdam Avenue, through the Upper West Side, Morningside Heights, Harlem, and Washington Heights. Much of these areas were working-class or poor for much of the 20th century. The street has long been noted for its commercial traffic. The street had grade-level railroad lines through the early 20th century. The Hudson River Railroad's West Side Line ran along Tenth Avenue from its intersection with West Street to the upper city station at 34th Street, after which it veered to Eleventh Avenue; the line was completed to Peekskill, New York in 1849. Over this part of the right-of-way, the rails were laid at grade along the streets, and since by the corporation regulations locomotives were not allowed, the cars were drawn by a dummy engine, which, according to an 1851 description, consumed its own smoke. While passing through the city the train of cars was preceded by a man on horseback known as a \\"West Side cowboy\\" or \\"Tenth Avenue cowboy\\" who gave notice of its approach by blowing a horn.Highline Photo of the Week West Side Cowboy However, so many accidents occurred between freight trains and other traffic that the nickname \\"Death Avenue\\" was given to both Tenth and Eleventh Avenues. Public debate about the hazard began during the early 1900s. In 1929, the city, the state, and New York Central agreed on the West Side Improvement Project, conceived by Robert Moses. The project eliminated 105 street-level railroad crossings and added to Riverside Park; it also included construction of the West Side Elevated Highway. It cost more than $150 million (about $2 billion in 2017 dollars). The part of Tenth Avenue north of West 59th Street was renamed \\"Amsterdam Avenue\\" in 1890 at the request of local merchants seeking to distance themselves from \\"Death Avenue\\" and to increase the value of their properties in an area that had yet to \\"catch on\\". The name was intended to recall the Dutch roots of Manhattan's earliest colonization in the 17th century, when the city was known as New Amsterdam. They hoped that the area would become a \\"the New City\\" and a \\"new, New Amsterdam\\". The Board of Alderman approved the name change, but only after first considering \\"Holland Avenue\\"; the change was made just before the vote on the resolution. In their approval, the Board noted that other name changes in the area ‚Äì such as that of Eleventh Avenue to \\"West End Avenue\\" ‚Äì had \\"a marked and beneficial effect on property\\", and said that they held such name changes \\"as second in importance only to the advantages of increased rapid transit.\\" The Fort George Amusement Park, now a seating area in Highbridge Park, was located at the northern end of Amsterdam Avenue from 1895 to 1914. Tenth Avenue and Amsterdam Avenue were converted to carry one-way traffic northbound in two stages. South of its intersection with Broadway, the avenue was converted on November 6, 1948. The remainder, to 110th Street, was converted on December 6, 1951. Amsterdam Avenue continues to carry two-way traffic north of 110th Street. During the real estate boom of the late 20th century, Amsterdam Avenue from roughly 59th Street to 96th Street became one of the city's most expensive residential districts. Transportation The M11 bus runs northbound along the avenue. North of 72nd Street, the M7 bus also runs northbound on the avenue; north of 110th Street, the M11 bus runs in both directions along Amsterdam Avenue.

Lisbon: Imprensa Nacional, 1900, p. 374 In 1590s, Susenyos was perceived as one of the potential successors to the throne, as Emperor Sarsa Dengel's sons were very young. In order to eliminate him from the competition, Empress Maryam Sena had Susenyos exiled, but Susenyos managed to escape and find refuge amongst the Oromo. From 1597 to 1603, initially adopted by the Oromo in the Walaqa area, Susenyos assembled a powerful army of these wild tribes, at the head of an Kafre and Tulama clan army, raiding successively Gafat, Menz, and southern Gojjam. At the death of his one-time ally, Emperor Za Dengel, he was proclaimed his successor and returned to the realm, although the fight against Emperor Yaqob continued.Budge, pp. 375‚Äì383  Reign  Ruins of Susenyos' palace at Dankaz Susenyos became Emperor following the defeat of first Za Sellase, then on 10 March 1607 Yaqob at the Battle of Gol in southern Gojjam.Bruce, vol. 2 p. 259 After his defeat, Za Sellase became a supporter of Susenyos, but fell out with Susenyos early in his reign, and was imprisoned on an amba in Guzamn. After a year, Za Sellase managed to escape and lived as a brigand for a year until he was killed by a peasant, who sent his head to the Emperor.James Bruce, Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile (1805 edition), vol. 3 pp. 287‚Äì289 In 1608, a rebel appeared near Debre Bizen. Because the body of Yaqob had never been found after the Battle of Gol, there had been some doubt that the previous Emperor was truly dead, and a pretender announced that he was the dead Emperor Yaqob. The pretender managed to disguise the fact he did not resemble Yaqob by keeping part of his face covered, claiming that he had suffered grievous wounds to his teeth and face from the battle.Bruce, vol. 3 p. 289 The governor of Tigray, Sela Krestos, eventually heard of the revolt, and not trusting the loyalty of a general levy of troops struck against the rebel with his own household and the descendants of the Portuguese soldiers who had followed Crist√≥v√£o da Gama (son of the legendary Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama) into Ethiopia. Despite their defeating the rebels three different times, the pretender managed to escape each battle to hide in the mountains of Hamasien.Bruce, vol.3 pp. 290‚Äì292 Meanwhile, Emperor Susenyos was preoccupied with raiding parties of the Oromo. An initial encounter with the Marawa Oromo near the upper course of the Reb River ended in a defeat for the Ethiopian advance guards; Susenyos rallied his men and made an attack which scattered the Oromo. The Marawa allied with other Oromo, and the united force entered Begemder to avenge their defeat. Upon hearing of this, the Emperor responded by summoning his son-in-law Qegnazmach Julius and Kifla Krestos to join him with their troops, and defeated the raiders at Ebenat on 17 January 1608. According to James Bruce, the Royal Chronicle of Susenyos reports 12,000 Oromo were killed while only 400 on the Emperor's side were lost.Bruce, vol. 3 pp. 292‚Äì296 With the Oromo threat dealt with, Susenyos now could turn his attention to Yaqob the pretender; he marched to Axum by way of the Lamalmo and Waldebba, where he was formally crowned Emperor 18 March 1608, in a ceremony described by Jo√£o Gabriel, the captain of the Portuguese in Ethiopia.Bruce, vol. 3 pp. 296‚Äì300 Despite this act legitimizing his rule, Susenyos had no luck capturing the pretender, and was forced to leave the task to his servant Amsala Krestos. Amsala Krestos induced two brothers who had joined the rebellion to assassinate Yaqob the pretender, who then sent the dead man's head to Susenyos. Without a scarf obscuring his features, writes Bruce, \\"it now appeared, that he had neither scars in his face, broken jaw, nor loss of teeth; but the covering was intending only to conceal the little resemblance he bore to king Jacob, slain, as we said before, at the battle of Lebart.\\"Bruce, vol. 3 pp. 299f = Sennar - Ethiopia War = Abd al Qadir II of Sennar acknowledged Susenyos' authority in 1606, receiving a negarit drum, sign of vasselage, and giving a trained falcon. Similarly, his brother and successor Adlan I maintained the relationship, giving a number of fine horses as a present.H. Weld Blundell, The Royal chronicle of Abyssinia, 1769-1840 (Cambridge: University Press, 1922), p. 530 Badi I of Sennar, son of Abd al Qadir II and successor of Adlan I, however, outraged by the shelter given in Chilga to his father by the Ethiopians, severed these ties, sending as an insult two lame horses and an army led by the Nail Weld Ageeeb from Atbara, to pillage the border areas.Bruce, vol. 2 pp. 298, https://archive.org/details/travelstodiscov02bruc The hostilities between the two kingdoms increased when the governor of the Mazaga, Aleko, who was a servant of Emperor Susenyos, fled to Sennar with a number of the Emperor's horses and kettledrums.A History of the Arabs in the Sudan and Some Account of the People who Preceded Them and of the Tribes Inhabiting Darfur by MacMichael, Harold Alfred, Sir, 1882, p. 436, https://books.google.com/books?id=xeM8AAAAIAAJ Susenyos complained of this to Badi, who refused to reply; further insulting him.

Welde Hawaryat, Melca Chrestos and the governor of Tigray Ras Tekle Giyorgis led a three-pronged assault on the border from their respective provinces. Welde Hawaryat finally conquered and sacked the town of Atbara on the Nile after a 19-day march.A History of the Arabs in the Sudan and Some Account of the People who Preceded Them and of the Tribes Inhabiting Darfur by MacMichael, Harold Alfred, Sir, 1882, p. 437-438, https://books.google.com/books?id=xeM8AAAAIAAJ Susenyos finally sent Bahir Negash Gebre Mariam to attack Mandara, whose queen controlled a strategic caravan road from Suakin.Bruce, vol. 2 pp. 303 The Bahir Negash was successful in capturing Queen Fatima, who was brought back to Susenyos palace in Danqaz, and renewed submission to the Empire.Bruce, vol. 2 pp. 305 According to his Royal Chronicle, Susenyos hence made his power felt along his western frontier from Fazogli, north to Suakin.Richard Pankhurst, The Ethiopian Borderlands (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1997), p. 369  Susenyos and Catholicism  Susenyos's reign is perhaps best known as the brief period in Ethiopian history when Catholic Christianity became the official religion. The Emperor became interested in Catholicism, in part due to Pedro P√°ez's persuasion, but also hoping for military help from Portugal and Spain (in union at the time of Susenyos's reign). Some decades earlier, in 1541, Crist√≥v√£o da Gama had led a military expedition to save the Ethiopian emperor Gelawdewos from the onslaught of Ahmed Gragn, a Muslim Imam who almost destroyed the existence of the Ethiopian state. Susenyos hoped to receive a new contingent of well-armed European soldiers, this time against the Oromo, who were ravaging his kingdom, and to help with the constant rebellions. Two letters of this diplomatic effort survive, which he entrusted to P√°ez to send to Europe: the one to the King of Portugal is dated 10 December 1607, while the other is to the Pope and dated 14 October of the same year; neither mention his conversion, but both ask for soldiers.Bruce, p. 287 He showed the Jesuit missionaries his favor by a number of land grants, most importantly those at Gorgora, located on a peninsula on the northern shore of Lake Tana. In 1613, Susenyos sent a mission heading for Madrid and Rome, led by Jesuit priest Ant√≥nio Fernandes. The plan was to head south, in an attempt to reach Malindi, a port on the Indian Ocean in what is Kenya today, hoping to break through the effective blockade that the Ottoman conquests had created around the Ethiopian empire by sailing all the way around the southern tip of Africa. However, they failed to reach Malindi, due to delays caused by local Christians hostile to the mission. Susenyos at last publicly converted to Catholicism in 1622, and separated himself from all of his wives and concubines except for his first wife, W√§ld ≈ö√§ øala. However, the tolerant and sensitive Pedro P√°ez died soon afterwards, and he was replaced by Afonso Mendes, who arrived at Massawa on 24 January 1624. E. A. Wallis Budge has stated the commonly accepted opinion of this man, as being \\"rigid, uncompromising, narrow-minded, and intolerant.\\"Wallis Budge, A History of Ethiopia: Nubia and Abyssinia, 1928 (Oosterhout: Anthropological Publications, 1970), p. 390 Strife and rebellions over the enforced changes began within days of Mendes' public ceremony in 1626, where he proclaimed the primacy of Rome and condemned local practices which included Saturday Sabbath and frequent fasts. Yet a number of Ethiopians did embrace Catholicism: Richard Pankhurst reports 100,000 inhabitants of Dembiya and Wegera alone are said to have converted.Pankhurst, The Ethiopians: A History (Oxford: Blackwell, 2001), p. 107 The most serious response was launched by a triumvirate composed of his half-brother Yimena Krestos, a eunuch named Kefla Wahad, and his brother-in- law Julius. Susenyos avoided their first attempt to assassinate him at court, but while he was campaigning against Sennar they raised a revolt, calling to their side \\"all those who were friends to the Alexandrian faith\\". However, Susenyos had returned to Dembiya before the rebels expected, and quickly killed Julius. Yimena Krestos held out a while longer on Melka Amba in Gojjam, before Af Krestos captured him and brought him to Dankaz where Susenyos had his camp; here the Emperor's brother was tried and sentenced to banishment.Bruce, pp. 344‚Äì350 More revolts followed, some led by champions of the traditional Ethiopian Church. One revolt which resisted all of Susenyos' efforts to put down was by the Agaw in Lasta. Their first leader was Melka Krestos, a distant member of the Solomonic dynasty, whom the Agaw had sued to be their leader. Susenyos' first campaign against them, which began in February 1629 with raising an army of 30,000 men in Gojjam, was defeated and his son-in-law Gebra Krestos slain.Bruce, pp. 381‚Äì384 While Melka Krestos' master of horse was slain along with 4000 men not long after while pillaging Semien Gonder, at the same time the men of Lasta made a successful raid out of their mountains into Susenyos' territory.Bruce, pp. 390f When he attempted a second expedition against the rebels in Lasta, Susenyos found his men's morale so low that he was forced to allow them to observe one of the traditional Wednesday fasts‚Äîwhich brought an immediate reproach from the Catholic Patriarch. Although Susenyos eloquently defended himself, Bruce notes that \\"from this time, it plainly appears, that Socinios began to entertain ideas, at least of the church discipline and government, very opposite to those he had when he first embraced the Romish religion.\\"Bruce, p. 398 Despite this concession to his troops, and despite the fact they reached Melka Krestos' headquarters, his forces fell to an ambush and Susenyos was forced to return to Dankaz with nothing to show for his effort. Susenyos attempted one more campaign against the rebels, only to find his men mutinous. They saw no end to unrewarding expeditions to Lasta, and when at home confronted by the executions used to enforce Catholicism on Ethiopia. While expressing some skepticism at the matter, Bruce states the Royal Chronicle reports his son told the troops that if they were victorious in Lasta, the Emperor would restore the traditional Ethiopian practices. However, as they marched behind Susenyos to Lasta, his scouts reported that Melka Krestos had descended from Lasta with 25,000 men, and were at hand. On 26 July 1631 the armies clashed; 8,000 of the rebels were dead and Melka Krestos had fled the field. Upon viewing the field of battle, Susenyos' son Fasilides is reported to have said, > These men, whom you see slaughtered on the ground, were neither Pagans nor > Mahometans, at whose death we should rejoice‚Äîthey were Christians, lately > your subjects and your countrymen, some of them your relations. This is not > victory, which is gained over ourselves. In killing these, you drive the > sword into your own entrails. How many men have you slaughtered? How many > more have you to kill? We have become a proverb, even among the Pagans and > Moors, for carrying on this war, and apostatizing, as they say, from the > faith of our ancestors.Bruce, pp. 402f Less than a year afterwards, on 14 June 1632 Susenyos made a declaration that those who would follow the Catholic faith were allowed to do so, but no one would be forced to do so any further. At this point, all Patriarch Mendes could do in response was to confirm that this was, indeed, the actual will of the Emperor, his protector. Catholic Ethiopia had come to an end.Bruce, pp. 403ff  Succession  In 1630, the Viceroy of Begemder, Sarsa Krestos after years of rebellion, proclaimed Susenyos's son Fasilides emperor; Sarsa Krestos was promptly captured and hanged. Despite this, father and son stayed on good terms.Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time (New York: Palgrave, 2000), pp. 98f After announcing his act of toleration, Susenyos abdicated in favor of his son, Fasilides. He was buried at the church of Genneta Iyasus.

The song was a response to Jay-Z's \\"Takeover\\", a diss track directed towards Nas and Prodigy. Nas named the song \\"Ether\\" stating, \\"I was told a long time ago, ghosts and spirits don't like the fumes from ether, and I just wanted to affect him with my weapon and get to his soul.\\" \\"Ether\\" has been called a \\"classic\\" diss track and the \\"wildest\\" in hip hop history by music publications. Song Jay-Z dismissed Nas as a has-been on the diss track \\"Takeover\\". Nas responds to Jay's claims by rapping, \\"I got this, locked since Nine-One (1991), I am the truest/ Name a rapper that I ain't influenced.\\" The song contains numerous slurs directed at Jay-Z: \\"When these streets keep calling, heard it when I was asleep/ That this Gay-Z and Cock-A- Fella Records wanted beef\\", \\"Then you got the nerve to say that you're better than Big/ Dick-suckin' lips, why don't you let the late great veteran live\\", \\"You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention/ Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons\\" and \\"Put it together/ I rock hos; y'all rock fellas.\\" Nas also attacks Jay-Z's street cred, claiming, \\"In '88, you was gettin' chased to your buildin'/ Callin' my crib, and I ain't even give you my numbers/ All I did was give you a style for you to run with.\\" He also accuses Jay of selling out, \\"Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches/ What's sad is I love you cause you're my brother, you traded your soul for riches.\\" Nas also criticized him for copying KRS-One ideas on the name of Jay-Z's current album at the time, The Blueprint, which was quite similar to the Boogie-Down Production's album, Ghetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip Hop, with the line \\"KRS already made an album called Blueprint.\\" He had lines calling Jay unattractive and accusing him of misogyny, as well as having an affair with Foxy Brown in the late 1990s (which she would confirm years later in her track \\"Let em Know\\") rapping, \\"You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women/ Were you abused as a child, scared to smile, they called you ugly?\\" and \\"Foxy kept you hot, kept your face in her puss/ What you think you gettin' girls now because of your looks?\\", \\"started cocking up my weapon slowly loading up this ammo to explode it on a Camel and his soldiers I can handle \\". He also accuses Jay of brown nosing other rappers for fame: \\"Your ass went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane, to Irv to Big/ And, Eminem murdered you on your own shit./ You a dick- ridin' faggot. You love the attention\\" Not only does he criticize the usage of other rappers' influence for increased fame, he mentions that Eminem outshined him on his song, \\"Renegade\\". Finally, Nas insults Jay-Z's biting of Big's lyrics claiming that Jay-Z stole his rhyming skills off Biggie, \\"How much of Biggie's rhymes gonna come out your fat lips?\\". The intro of Ether starts with gunshots from Notorious B.I.G.'s Who Shot Ya?, immediately followed by a Screwed voice of 2Pac saying \\"Fuck Jay-Z\\", originally taken from the song \\"Fuck Friendz\\". In the outro of \\"Ether\\", Nas mocks the chorus of \\"Takeover\\", which Jay-Z raps \\"R-O-C, we runnin' this rap shit\\", Nas changes it to \\"R-O-C, get gunned up and clapped quick\\" and so on. In an interview with This is 50, Large Professor stated the original version of Ether was produced by Swizz Beatz and the lyrical content contained in the original version was much more offensive, which even contained a line where Nas raps, \\"It should've been you in that plane crash\\", referring to the infamous plane crash that caused the death of American singer Aaliyah, which occurred earlier the same year Stillmatic was released and during the time that the Jay-Z vs. Nas feud started up. Aftermath Jay-Z responded to \\"Ether\\" with three tracks; \\"People Talkin‚Äô\\", \\"Don't You Know\\" and \\"Supa Ugly\\", in which he mentions the mother of Nas' child. After a phone call from his mother, Jay-Z admitted he went too far and apologized. \\"Supa Ugly\\" marked the \\"official\\" end of the battle, although references to the beef can be found on Nas' \\"Last Real Nigga Alive\\" from God's Son, \\"U Wanna Be Me\\" from 8 Mile and \\"Everybody's Crazy\\" from The Lost Tapes, and Jay-Z's \\"Blueprint 2\\" from The Blueprint 2: The Gift and the Curse album. The Jay-Z vs. Nas feud was beneficial to both men's careers. Stillmatic and \\"Ether\\" had marked the reemergence of Nas to the hip hop scene two years after having released Nastradamus, considered by many fans and critics to have been the weakest album in his discography. Many fans still credit the feud with resurrecting Nas' career; while he has not matched the commercial success of It Was Written or I Am..., his work since Stillmatic has been better received critically. The battle also boosted Jay-Z's career, giving him much notoriety for having the bravado to attack a respected rapper such as Nas. The feud (or \\"beef\\") between the two rappers has since been reconciled, and they have gone on to collaborate on the song \\"Black Republican\\", from Nas's 2006 album Hip Hop is Dead, \\"Success\\", from Jay-Z's 2007 album American Gangster, \\"I Do It For Hip Hop\\" from Ludacris' 2008 album Theater of the Mind, \\"BBC\\" from Jay-Z's 2013 album Magna Carta Holy Grail as well as the unreleased song \\"The Scientist\\" produced by Just Blaze and this song was rumored to be a song that didn't make Nas' Untitled album Legacy \\"Ether\\" has been cited as a \\"classic\\" diss track and the \\"wildest\\" in hip hop history by music publications. When asked to name his favorite rap battle, Papoose pointed to the feud between Jay-Z and Nas, citing the release Ether as one of the decisive moments of the affair: \\"That's one of the great battles, there's other ones too though, in hip-hop history. I can go on and on, but that's one that stands out...It wasn't an age thing but a lot of people were sleeping. Like, 'It's over! Jay-Z killed him!' I was like, 'Aight, watch.' I knew it was coming, man.\\" (Hot 93.7) In another interview, Jadakiss claims, \\"'Ether' sits on the mantle when it comes to battle songs. From the production, to the way he formatted it, to what he was saying ‚Äì he touched everything. It was an A-Plus grade.\\" Due to the popularity of the song, Ron Browz, who produced the song, went on to nickname himself Etherboy. Shortly after Nas released the song, the word \\"ether\\" entered the hip hop lexicon as a slang expression synonymous with ruthlessness ‚Äì meaning to harshly humiliate an opponent. ‚ÄúTo 'ether' someone,\\" writes Son Raw, \\"means to completely dismantle them in a rap battle with no regard for petty concerns such as 'logic' or 'cleverness' ‚Äì it‚Äôs a giant shock-n-awe display of machismo meant to scar the victim for life and leave an unmistakable blemish on his career.\\" In addition, the song itself helped to popularized the term \\"stan\\" as a pejorative term (which originally referenced Eminem's 2000 hit single, denoting an obsessive fan.) Ether has also been referenced and sampled by rappers who have sought to stylize their own diss recordings along similar lines of severity, including Game, Joe Budden, Saigon, Shyne, and Joey Bada$$ among others. Eminem took the sample of \\"Ether\\" and used it in Xzibit's song \\"My Name\\", featuring Nate Dogg, which was a diss song to Jermaine Dupri. Jin used the instrumental of the song to diss Rosie O'Donnell. In 2012, Cassidy, alluded to the song in his threat against Meek Mill, \\"If I do a diss record, it's going to be on the 'Ether' level if not worse.\\" Cassidy went on to record a song against Mill titled R.A.I.D. which samples and quotes segments of Ether. Remy Ma also used the instrumentals for her own diss track titled \\"Shether\\" aimed at Nicki Minaj which was released on February 25, 2017.

Like most other Ugandan districts, it is named after its 'chief town', Bugiri, where the district headquarters are located. Location Bugiri District is bordered by Namutumba District and Butaleja District to the north, Tororo District to the northeast, Busia District to the east, Namayingo District to the southeast, Mayuge District to the southwest and Iganga District to the west.Uganda District Map Bugiri, the district headquarters is located approximately , by road, east of Jinja, the largest city in Busoga sub-region. The coordinates of the district are:00 33N, 33 45E (Latitude:0.5500; Longitude:33.7500). Overview Bugiri District was carved out of Iganga District, to which it used to belong. The land surface is characterized by gentle undulating hills with few higher residual features. Another feature of the district is its being located in a flat and rolling topographical zone with 90% of its landmass constituting the drainage basins of Lake Victoria and Lake Kyoga. As a result, there are numerous swamps that criss-cross the road network, making the cost of the road improvement costly. In July 2010, the southern part of Bugiri District was split off to form Namayingo District. Bugiri District is part of Busoga sub-region, which is conterminous with Busoga Kingdom, one of the constitutionally recognised kingdoms in Uganda. According to the 2002 national census, the sub-region was home to an estimated 2.5 million people at that time. The districts that constitute Busoga sub-region include the following: Population The national population census conducted in 1991 estimated the district population at about 171,300. The 2002 national census estimated the population of the district at approximately 237,400. The annual population growth rate in the district is calculated at 6.1%. In 2012 the population of Bugiri District was estimated at approximately 426,800. Economic activities Agriculture forms the backbone of the district, as it does in the majority of districts in the country. The main crops include: Tilda Uganda Limited (TUL), a commercial agricultural company, grows rice on a commercial basis at Kibimba Rice Scheme, in the extreme east of Bugiri District. Private out growers also sell their produce to TUL. Due to the abundance of freshwater bodies in the district, commercial fishing is actively practiced by many in Bugiri District. At one time, the district produced in excess of forty (40) metric tonnes of fish on a daily basis. Unfortunately, due to unregulated fishing, the fish reserves in Lake Victoria have been severely disrupted to near-depletion. The daily catch has since markedly fallen from those high numbers. At the height of the fish boom, 75% of the output was exported (mainly to Western Europe), 20% was consumed locally and 5% was lost in processing. People * Phillip Wafula Oguttu, was formerly the Member of Parliament (MP) for Bukhooli County Central, a constituency in Bugiri District. *Frederick Douglas Mwanja Mukisa, was a Ugandan educator and politician.

According to the Family Jewels Central Intelligence Agency documents, in 1971, during the Indo-Pakistani War, the director of the CIA, Richard Helms, had a tap put on Anderson's phones.Memo of conversation, January 3, 1975, between President Gerald Ford, William Colby, etc., made available by the National Security Archive. Other topics that Anderson covered included organized crime, the John F. Kennedy assassination, Ted Kennedy's role in the drowning death of a staffer at the Chappaquiddick incident, the Watergate scandal, the 1970 meeting between Elvis Presley and President Nixon,\\"When Elvis Met Nixon\\", smithsonianmag.com; accessed April 29, 2017. fugitive Nazis, the white supremacist group the Liberty Lobby and other far-right organizations, the death of Howard Hughes, the ABSCAM public corruption investigation, the investigation into fugitive financier Robert Vesco, the Iran-Contra scandal, and the activities of numerous Washington agencies, elected officials, and bureaucrats. Retractions Anderson's column occasionally published erroneous information for which he issued retractions. During the 1972 presidential race, Anderson retracted a story accusing Democratic vice-presidential nominee Thomas Eagleton of multiple drunk driving arrests. But Eagleton's campaign was already severely damaged, and he was dropped from the ticket.Howard Kurz, \\"Moving to the Right\\", The Washington Post, April 19, 2006. Targeted for assassination In 1972 Anderson was the target of an assassination plot conceived by senior White House staff. Two Nixon administration conspirators admitted under oath that they plotted to poison Anderson on orders from senior White House aide Charles Colson. White House \\"plumbers\\" G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt met with a CIA operative to discuss the possibilities, including drugging Anderson with LSD, poisoning his aspirin bottle, or staging a fatal mugging. The plot was aborted when the plotters were arrested for the Watergate break-in. Nixon had long been angry with Anderson. He blamed the fallout from Anderson's election-eve story about a secret loan from Howard Hughes to Nixon's brotherMark Feldstein, \\"Getting the Scoop\\" , for Nixon's loss of the 1960 presidential election. Glomar Explorer Anderson has been credited as breaking to a nationwide audience in 1975 the story of the Glomar Explorer, a ship constructed under tight security by the CIA to recover the lost nuclear-armed Soviet submarine K-129. Rejecting a plea from the Director of Central Intelligence William Colby to suppress the story, Anderson said he published the story because \\"Navy experts have told us that the sunken sub contains no real secrets and that the project, therefore, is a waste of the taxpayers' money.\\" JFK conspiracy allegations In November 1988 Anderson hosted a two-hour prime-time television special entitled American Expose: Who Murdered JFK? The program asserted that the assassination of John F. Kennedy was a conspiracy involving an alliance between organized crime and the Cuban government, and that the Warren Commission did not publicly reveal the true findings. Anderson's theory was based on interviews with mobster John Roselli who - prior to his death 12 years earlier - said he learned of a conspiracy through mob sources. Anderson's conversations with Roselli were re-enacted with an actor portraying Roselli. According to Anderson, Cuban leader Fidel Castro wanted Kennedy killed in retaliation for CIA plots to kill Castro, and leaders of La Cosa Nostra in the United States opposed him due to his brother Robert F. Kennedy's efforts as US Attorney General against organized crime. He said that Santo Trafficante, Carlos Marcello, and Jimmy Hoffa had the \\"motive and means to kill the president\\", and reiterated reports connecting Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby to the mob. Anderson also alleged that President Lyndon B. Johnson covered up the conspiracy for fear that public knowledge of the CIA plots would trigger war with the Soviet Union. According to Anderson's report, private photographic analysts concluded that the shot that killed Kennedy came from the front, and that E. Howard Hunt and James Earl Ray were depicted in photographs of the \\"three tramps\\". Hunt denied the charge on the program and said he had witnesses who could prove he was in Dallas. An Associated Press (AP) writer described it as a \\"bizarre allegation,\\" to which Anderson provided \\"no explanation of their alleged connection\\". Chicago Tribune columnist Steve Daily called the program \\"limp\\" and said Anderson's conclusion that organized crime was responsible for the assassination was based \\"on circumstantial evidence and the word of dead gangster Johnny Roselli.\\" Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times wrote that it was \\"tawdry and strident\\" and said Anderson's \\"so-called evidence was unclear, unconvincing and untrustworthy.\\" The Deseret News said Anderson was trying to \\"rewrite history\\". Capitol security stunt To demonstrate the weak security within the U.S. Capitol, in 1989, Anderson brought a gun to an interview in the office of Bob Dole, Senate minority leader. He was reprimanded and Congress passed a change of rules for reporters' access to the Capitol and politicians. Legmen and alumni Investigative reporter Les Whitten shared the byline of Anderson's column in the 1970s. Anderson also used a staff of \\"legmen\\" on his payroll, who earned little but gained valuable reporting experience. Among Anderson's legmen‚Äîreporters who went out into the field and gathered the information, forwarding it to writers such as Anderson‚Äîwas Brit Hume, later a television reporter for ABC News and Washington managing editor for the Fox News Channel.Moving to the Right, The Washington Post, April 19, 2006. Death and aftermath Anderson was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1986. In July 2004 at the age of 81, Anderson retired from his syndicated column, Washington Merry-Go-Round. He died of complications from Parkinson's disease. In April 2006, Anderson's son Kevin said that some FBI agents had approached his mother (Jack's widow), Olivia, earlier that year to gain access to his father's files. This was purportedly in connection with the Lawrence Franklin espionage scandal. FBI spokesmen said that Anderson's archives contained classified information and confirmed that they wanted to remove the papers before they were made public. The agents claimed to be looking for documents pertaining to American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) as part of an espionage investigation. In November 2006, the FBI quietly gave up its pursuit of the archive. The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that the archive contains Anderson's CIA file, along with information he had compiled about prominent public figures such as Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Thomas Dodd, and J. Edgar Hoover.

His throne name was Alam Sagad (Ge'ez: ·ãì·àà·àù ·à∞·åà·ãµ), meaning \\"to whom the world bows\\". He was the son of Emperor Susenyos I and Empress Sultana Mogesa (Wolete Saala) of Wagda Katata and Merhabete. Emperor Fasilides was born at Magazaz in Bulga, Shewa, before 10 November 1603. His paternal grandfather's name was also Fasilides. History Fasilides was proclaimed emperor in 1630 during a revolt led by Sarsa Krestos, but did not reach the throne until his father abdicated in 1632. Once he became emperor, Fasilides immediately restored the official status of the traditional Ethiopian Orthodox Church. He sent for a new abuna from the patriarch of Alexandria, restoring the ancient relationship that had been allowed to lapse. He confiscated the lands of the Jesuits at Dankaz and elsewhere in the empire, relegating them to Fremona. When he heard that the Portuguese bombarded Mombasa, Fasilides assumed that Afonso Mendes, the Roman Catholic prelate, was behind the act, and banished the remaining Jesuits from his lands. Mendes and most of his followers made their way back to Goa, being robbed or imprisoned several times on the way. In 1665, he ordered the \\"Books of the Franks\\"‚Äîthe remaining religious writings of the Catholics‚Äîburnt. Fasilides is commonly credited with founding the city of Gondar in 1636, establishing it as Ethiopia's capital.See the discussion in Solomon Getamun, History of the City of Gondar (Africa World Press, 2005), pp.1-4 Whether or not a community existed here before he made it his capital is unknown. Amongst the buildings he had constructed there are the beginnings of the complex later known as Fasil Ghebbi, as well as some of the earliest of Gondar's fabled 44 churches: Adababay Iyasus, Adababay Tekle Haymanot, Atatami Mikael, Gemjabet Mariyam, Fit Mikael, and Qeddus Abbo.Getamun, City of Gondar, p. 5 He is also credited with building seven stone bridges in Ethiopia, notably the Sebara Dildiy bridge (); as a result all old bridges in Ethiopia are often commonly believed to be his work.There are many lists of these seven bridges; an example can be found in Richard Pankhurst, Economic History of Ethiopia (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie University Press, 1968), pp. 297f Sebara Dildiy (broken bridge in Amharic) was one of two stone bridges built over the Blue Nile River during Fasilides reign. Sebara Dildiy was later repaired during Emperor Menelik II's reign in 1901. Emperor Fasilides also built the Cathedral Church of St Mary of Zion at Axum. Fasilides' church is known today as the \\"Old Cathedral\\" and stands next to a newer cathedral built by Emperor Haile Selassie. Fasilides tried through 1642-1647 to establish diplomatic relations with Al-Mutawakkil Isma'il, the Zaydi Imam of Yemen. An embassy was sent back by the Yemenis in 1647 through way of Beilul. The effort, aimed at opening a new trade route bypassing Ottoman-held Massawa, was ultimately unsuccessful.Various, Christian-Muslim Relations. A Bibliographical History, BRILL, 2016, p. 585, https://books.google.com.gh/books?id=v9vzDQAAQBAJ&pg;=PA580#v=onepage&q;&f;=false Rebellion The rebellion of the Agaw in Lasta, which had begun under his father, continued into his reign and for the rest of his reign he made regular punitive expeditions into Lasta. The first, in 1637, went badly, for at the Battle of Libo his men panicked before the Agaw assault and their leader, Melka Kristos, entered Fasilides' palace and took the throne for himself. Fasilides quickly recovered and sent for help to Qegnazmach Dimmo, governor of Semien, and his brother Gelawdewos, governor of Begemder. These marched on Melka Kristos, who was still at Libo, where he was killed and his men defeated. The next year Fasilides marched into Lasta; according to James Bruce, the Agaw retreated to their mountain strongholds, and \\"almost the whole army perished amidst the mountains; great part from famine, but a greater still from cold, a very remarkable circumstance in these latitudes.\\"James Bruce, Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile (1805 edition), vol. 3, pp. 435-437 Fasilides dispatched an embassy to India in 1664‚Äì5 to congratulate Aurangzeb upon his accession to the throne of the Mughal Empire. Its arrival, much impoverished, is described by the French traveler Fran√ßois Bernier who was then at Aurangzeb's court. In 1666, after his son Dawit rebelled, Fasilides had him incarcerated at Wehni, reviving the ancient practice of confining troublesome members of the Imperial family to a mountaintop, as they had once been confined at Amba Geshen. Death Fasilides died at Azazo, south of Gondar, and his body was interred at St. Stephen's, a monastery on Daga Island in Lake Tana. When Nathaniel T. Kenney was shown Fasilides' remains, he saw a smaller mummy also shared the coffin. A monk told Kenney that it was Fasilides' seven-year-old son Isur, who had been smothered in a crush of people who had come to pay the new king homage.Nathaniel T.

Like many other Ugandan districts, it shares its name with its administrative center of Arua. Location Arua District is bordered by Yumbe District to the north, Adjumani District to the northeast, Amuru District to the east, Nebbi District to the southeast, Zombo District to the southwest, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to the west, and Maracha District to the northwest. The district headquarters at Arua are located about , by road, northwest of Kampala, the capital and largest city of Uganda. The coordinates of the district are:03 00N, 31 10E. Overview Arua District got its name from Arua town. In the late 1970s, the Ugandan president at the time Godfrey Binaisa declared that all districts/provinces acquire their names from their regional capital so that is how Arua district inherited the name from Arua town. The district originally included Aringa County, which was later split off to become Yumbe District. The district is the birthplace of former President Idi Amin. Arua District was a springboard for some units of the Uganda People's Defense Force who entered the DRC at the beginning of the Second Congo War. Arua District is a peaceful district save for the disruption caused in the late 1990s by the Lord's Resistance Army rebels on the Karuma-Pakwach road that provides the main road link into the district. In 2005, the northeastern part of the district was split off as the separate, new district of Koboko District. Arua District has five counties after three of the original six counties were split off. Koboko was granted district status. Maracha was, in 2006, also granted district status, (Maracha District). Initially, Terego County was also included in Maracha District (Maracha-Terego District). However, failing to agree on were the new district headquarters should be located, Terego County opted to remain part of the larger Arua District. The inhabitants of Terego County in Arua District and those of Maracha District, regard themselves as different ethnicities; although the Government of Uganda recognizes them as the Lugbara. The other counties in Arua District are: Vurra, Madi-Okollo and Ayivu; where the Arua District headquarters are located. Population The 1991 national population census estimated the population of the district at about 368,200. In 2002, the national population census gave a population estimate of 559,100, with an annual growth rate of 4 percent. In 2012, the population of Arua District was estimated at 776,700. Economic activities Located in a corner of the country that borders both South Sudan and the DRC, a significant amount of local economic activity is the result of cross-border trade. Agriculture is the backbone of Arua District's economy: =Food & cash crops= * Groundnuts * Beans * Maize * Millet * Simsim * Mangoes * Avocado * Cassava * Matooke * Flowers * Tobacco =Domesticated livestock and other fauna= *African goats *Boer goats *Hybrid goats *Broilers *Layers *Fish farming *Pigs *Bee keeping Due to a high influx of refugees from South Sudan (estimated at 50,000 at one time), the natural environment in the district has been severely stressed, causing deforestation in some areas. The refugee population extensively engages in the growth of tobacco to raise cash for survival thus putting severe pressure on the land. In 2008 and 2009, honey is steadily replacing tobacco as a leading income stream, with a ready international market. Piggery is also on the increase in the district. The district produces about 30 tons of fish from over 600 private fish farms and from the River Nile. The district has about 117,000 head of local Zebu cattle. However the district milk output remains low. The biggest asset of the district is perhaps the continued prevalence of peace and security for the last 25 years and denunciation of rebellion which has attracted many developmental projects. Major achievements include infrastructural transformation such as the tarmacking of the Arua to Karuma Highway, the West Nile Rural Electrification Project and numerous telephone communication networks that have been established in the region. During 2013, the tarmacking of the Vurra-Arua-Koboko-Oraba Road began.

Like many other Ugandan districts, it is named after its \\"chief town\\", Moyo, where the district headquarters are located. Location Moyo District is located in Uganda's extreme north, in the West Nile sub-region. The District is bordered by South Sudan to the north and east, Adjumani District to the south, across the waters of the White Nile, and Yumbe District to the west. The South Sudanese state of Central Equatoria and Eastern Equatoria form the northern border, and a road runs from Moyo to the town of Kajo Keji in Central Equatoria. The district headquarters at Moyo, are located approximately , by road, northeast of Arua, the largest city in the sub-region. This location lies approximately , by road, northwest of Kampala, Uganda's capital and largest city. The coordinates of the district are:03 39N, 31 43E (Latitude:3.6500; Longitude:31.7190). Overview In recent years the district has stagnated in isolation as the Second Sudanese Civil War raged to the north and the insurgency of the Lord's Resistance Army made the direct road south to the national capital of Kampala perilous. The district has hosted a large number of South Sudanese refugees who fled the fighting in their country. The 2005 Sudanese peace agreement and reduced activities of the LRA have raised hopes that Moyo District will again become the prosperous transit area for cross-border trade that it once was. Population In 1991, the national population census estimated the population of the district at about 79,400. The population of Moyo District according to the 2002 national census was about 194,800, of whom 48.8% were females and 51.2% were males. In the first decade of the 2000s, Moyo District experienced rapid population growth, primarily from refugees fleeing war in South Sudan. It is estimated that the annual population growth rate in the district has averaged 7.9%, between 2002 and 2012. It is estimated that the population of the district in 2012, was approximately 412,500. Economic activities Like in most other Ugandan districts, agriculture forms the backbone of the district economy.

It was under development to work as a publicly distributed system for the rendering of 3D graphics, but has been abandoned as of late 2004. BURP also refers to the volunteer and grid computing software BOINC, as BURP needs BOINC in order to distribute computing task among their users. BURP is free software distributed under the GNU General Public License V3 licence.Licensing of BURP and related components Because BURP is used to refer to both BOINC project and BURP back-end software, some confusion can arise when talking about other services running the BURP software. BOINC users who are considering joining BURP should know that they will not always have work available, as the projects depend on users to submit sessions that need rendering. This may be confusing to new users, as the BOINC client may report \\"Got 0 new tasks\\" or other error messages without explaining the reason for not getting any work.  The BURP idea  The idea of BURP is to use spare CPU cycles on participating computers around the world to render 3D images and animations submitted by the users of the BURP network - in other words to build a large shared render farm that can be freely used by those who also contribute computing power to it. The potential processing power of a system like this is enormous‚Äîtheoretically the rendering speed would only be limited by available network bandwidth. The fundamental goal of BURP is to give users access to computing power to render animations that would take an impossibly long time on a single computer. By dividing the work among hundreds of computers, an animation that takes possibly months to render in CPU time could be completed in only a few days. BURP hopes to make animations and images public as soon as they are finished so that all participants will be able to see the outcome.  History  The BURP project was originally started by Danish national Janus Kristensen. The main BURP website went online on 17 June 2004. At that time the only supported renderer was Yafaray and the website was very basic. That August it became clear that Yafray was not the best choice, and focus was shifted towards Blender, a renderer with more features and a compact file format. By the end of October enough tests had been done to show that not only is the distributed rendering of 3D animations possible, it can achieve performance that rivals many commercial render farms. The current trend of increasing network bandwidth throughout the world will make it even more powerful. The rest of 2004 was used to improve and develop the website frontend for the system. Until May 2005, the Linux and Windows clients got major code overhauls and loads of tests were done to estimate and improve performance of several aspects of the data transfer systems. Most importantly, code for a mirrored storage and distribution system for the rendered output started to emerge. In May 2010, the project entered a beta stage,, BURP Forum post: \\"Beta is starting soon\\", author Janus Kristensen requiring users to agree to a new set of licensing rules based on the Creative Commons. Although many people have contributed to the source code since the start of the project, the majority of the BURP code base remains authored by Janus Kristensen, who continues as the head developer of the software. = Open Rendering Environment (ORE) and Renderfarm.fi = In 2007‚Äì2009, the Open Rendering Environment (ORE) project run by the Laurea University of Applied Sciences in Finland was created under guidance from Janus Kristensen and Julius Tuomisto, a team consisting mainly of undergraduate students started to do research on BURP for applications in Finnish small and medium-sized enterprises and third level education. For the project, an independent BURP server was set up in Finland and given the domain Renderfarm.fi, a name which the project was identified by until its closure in late 2014. Upon its opening to a public beta in summer 2009, Renderfarm.fi claimed to be the world's first publicly distributed render farm that advocated the use of Creative Commons licensing., \\"What is Renderfarm.fi?\\", a video on Youtube. September 2009. The main BURP project later followed suit and took up a similar licensing scheme. Although they used similar back-end code, Renderfarm.fi and BURP had some notable differences in the way their front ends worked. For example, Renderfarm.fi used the open source Django web application framework for managing information on its website, whereas BURP relies on a custom solution based on BOINC's content management system.  BURP architecture  = Open by design = When asked about whether the system encrypts or obfuscates the data it processes, Janus Kristensen stated in an August 2010 AssemblyTV interview: \\"No. The whole system is based on open ideas. When you send files to people, they can look into the files and see what's inside. Actually that's part of what's cool about a project like this. It's community based and not closed down or DRM protected in any way.\\", Renderfarm.fi, BURP and collaborative movie making on AssemblyTV = Accessibility = While the ORE project researched the possibilities of using BURP for education and business, it became evident that accessibility would be key in reaching users. The development focus within the ORE project soon shifted towards making BURP more accessible. A script for uploading work to a BURP project directly from within the Blender software was created to address these issues. The script lets the user input a rendering task (the file to be rendered as well as additional information), called a \\"session\\" through an XMLRPC interface on the BURP service. Since the release of Blender 2.5 Beta 3, the script has been available as an add-on in the main trunk of Blender. , Blender 2.5 Extensions, Render scripts: Renderfarm.fi, Wiki.blender.org = Supported render software = * Blender (software)  See also  *Parallel rendering *Distributed computing  References   External links  * BURP website * BURP source code Free entertainment software Free software BOINC projects ","title":"Big and Ugly Rendering Project"},{"id":"1786761","text":"Yumbe District is a district in Northern Region, Uganda.

Overview Under the colonial administration, Kapchorwa District was Sebei County, located in North Bugisu in the now defunct Bukedi District. Kapchorwa was granted district status on 1 February 1962, shortly before Uganda became an independent country. Kapchorwa District is home mostly to Kalenjin peoples, including the sub-groups Sabiny, Pokot, and Nandi. They were mainly cattle keepers in the late 1960s, but that changed when their northern neighbors, the Karamojong, raided most of their cattle and displaced hundreds of people. The populations most affected lived along the Kapchorwa plains; particularly in Ngenge Sub-County of Kapchorwa District and in Bukwo District. This displacement of the population has resulted in abject poverty among the affected households. People have been forced to live in Internally Displaced People camps, with very limited resources. In 2005, Kongasis County was split off of the district to form Bukwo District. In 2010, more territory was peeled off to form Kween District.

Hybrid cattle are widely raised on farms in the district. The hybrids produce more milk per animal and yield more beef per carcass and therefore are more profitable than the local breeds. Soil degradation, poor marketing and processing systems, and frequent out break of crop and livestock diseases are some of the challenges that the farmers in the district face.

Yohannes was appointed n…ôgus√§ n√§g√§st by a council of the senior dignitaries of the Empire, at the encouragement of the noble Blattengeta Malka Krestos. The council then imprisoned the other sons of Fasilides on Mount Wehni, continuing the practice Fasilides had revived. According to G.W.B. Huntingford, Yohannes spent much of his reign campaigning, stating that 6 of the 11 itineraries he reproduces were military expeditions. Three of these were against the Agaw in Gojjam, and Agawmeder, one against the Oromo, and two punitive expeditions to the area around Mount Ashgwagwa‚ÄîAngot and Lasta‚Äîto quash the revolts of Feres (in 1677) and Za Maryam (1679).G.W.B.

Due to the violent religious controversy that Catholic missionaries had caused in Ethiopia under the reign of his grandfather Susenyos, Yohannes acted harshly towards Europeans. In 1669, he directed Gerazmach Mikael to expel all of the Catholics still living in Ethiopia; those who did not embrace the beliefs of the Ethiopian Church were exiled to Sennar. Six Franciscans sent by Pope Alexander VII to succeed in converting Ethiopia to Catholicism where the Jesuits had failed 30 years before, were executed during his reign. As a result, he favored Armenian visitors, whose beliefs also embraced Miaphysitism, and were in harmony with the Ethiopian Church. These included one Murad, who undertook a number of diplomatic missions for the Emperor; and in 1679, the Emperor Yohannes received the Armenian bishop Yohannes, bearing a relic of Ewostatewos. The growing controversy over the nature of Christ had grown severe enough that in the last year of his reign Yohannes called a synod to resolve the dispute. The Ewostathian monks of Gojjam advocated the formula \\"Through Unction Christ the Son was consubstantial with the Father\\", by which they came to be known as the Qebat (\\"Unction\\") faction, who were supported by the Emperor's own son Iyasu; they were opposed by the monks of Debre Libanos, who at that time still advocated traditional Miaphysitism. The outcome of the synod is in dispute: according to E.A. Wallis-Budge and H. Weld Blundell, Emperor Yohannes was convinced to condemn the Qebat doctrine, which led to Iyasu attempting to flee his father's realm; but according to Crummey, Yohannes favored the Gojjame delegation for political reasons: at the time Gojjam was an important province. These decisions were revisited once Iyasu became Emperor, at a synod he called in 1686.Budge, pp. 406f, 410f; H.

Mass murder and suicides were committed at several sites in the district by the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God cult in 2000. The district has a distributed feeder road network and community access roads. There are three airstrips: Kayonza Tea Factory, Savannah Airstrip near Kihihi, and the Ishasha River Camp Airport in the Ishasha Sector of Queen Elizabeth National Park. The charitable organisation CHIFCOD operates schools, colleges, and health centres in the district. Population In 1991, the national population census estimated the district population at 160,700.

Economic activities Agriculture is the mainstay of the district's economy, as is the case with the majority of other Ugandan districts. The fertile soils and good climate allow for adequate produce for home consumption and surpluses that are sold. However, because of the remoteness of the district and the mountainous terrain, bringing the produce to market remains a challenge and a constraint to increased production. Many people in the district keep livestock on a subsistence level, primarily for milk production. Milk is part of the local diet and is a requirement for almost every household. But few people keep cattle in large numbers since the people here are traditionally agriculturalists. Crops grown in the district include: The Kayonza Tea Factory and the Kigezi Development Tea Factories, one in Butogota Town Council and the other in Rugyeyo Subcounty, purchase and process the tea grown locally. The CHIFCOD Coffee Factory supports 1,000 farmers, training them to create high-value produce then processing and exporting it. The high altitude and fertile soils allow production of temperate fruits like grapes, apples, and pears. The district also receives revenue from the tourism sector as a majority of the world's population of mountain gorillas are harboured in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park.

The administration of the Lost Counties as well as Bunyoro itself was modelled on the Buganda political system and under the leadership of Baganda chiefs. In a referendum held in November 1964, the residents in the two lost counties voted to return to the Kingdom of Bunyoro.

(Book of Genesis 25:12-16) Nebaioth is portrayed as the brother of Mahalath, one of Esau's wives: :(1): ...and Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; so Esau went unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives that he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife...

(Book of Genesis 36:2-3) Nebaioth is again mentioned as Ishmael's firstborn in the genealogies of the First Book of Chronicles: :...These are their generations: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth; then Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, Mishma, and Dumah, Massa, Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedem.

According to Kossoy, who examined Florence's notes, he referred to his process, in French, as photographie in 1834, at least four years before John Herschel coined the English word photography. Early life Hercules Florence was born on February 29, 1804John Hannavy (ed.), Encyclopedia of nineteenth-century photography: A-I, index, Volume 1, Routledge, 2008, p. 536. in Nice, France, the son of Arnaud Florence (1749‚Äì1807), a tax collector, and Augustine de Vignolis, a minor noblewoman. As a child he manifested interest for drawing and the sciences, as well as for the voyages of the great explorers to the New World and already as a 14-year-old boy he worked as a calligrapher and draftsman in Monaco, where his parents had been living since 1807. After a period of wandering and working on board of warships and merchant ships, H√©rcules Florence set sail to Brazil as a crew member of the French warship Marie Th√©r√®ze, arriving in the port of Rio de Janeiro on May 1, 1824, two years after the declaration of independence from Portugal. He was already an accomplished draftsman and painter with considerable talent and many scientific interests, particularly in the natural sciences and ethnography. Soon after his arrival, he got a job in a women's fashion store and then as a lithographer in a bookstore and printing shop, owned by his compatriot Pierre Plancher. The great expedition Sugar cane mill in S√£o Carlos, 1840 Florence's life changed dramatically when he decided to respond to a newspaper advertisement put by Baron von Langsdorff (1773‚Äì1852), the consul general of the Russian Empire in Brazil, a German-born physician and naturalist who was organizing on behalf of the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences a scientific expedition to the Amazon. He was hired as an illustrator and topographic draftsman, together with German painter Johann Moritz Rugendas (1802‚Äì1858) and the young French illustrator Adrien Taunay (1803‚Äì1828). In the year of 1825 they travelled by sea from Rio to the village of Santos. Florence eventually published his memoirs of the expedition in Voyage fluvial du Tiet√© √† l'Amazone. Businessman and inventor Soon after the end of the expedition, in 1830, Florence married Maria Ang√©lica de Vasconcellos, the daughter of his acquaintance and benefactor Francisco √Ålvares Machado, and went to live with her in the city of Campinas (then named Vila de S√£o Carlos), in the province of S√£o Paulo. There he became a successful farmer, publisher, and owner of the first printer in the town, and in Campinas, he remained for the next 49 years until his death in 1879. Maria died in 1850; four years later he married Carolina Krug, a German immigrant born in 1828 in Kassel. Together they founded in 1863 a school for girls, the Florence College, which was moved to Jundiai after Hercule's death. He fathered a total of 20 children, being 13 with Maria Ang√©lica and 7 with Carolina. Photocopy of a diploma made using Florence's photographic technique, ca. 1839 Soon after settling in Campinas, H√©rcules Florence began a prolific career as inventor and businessman. During the Langsdorff expedition, he had developed a new system of using musical notation to record the songs of birds and vocalizations of other animals, which he named \\"zoophonia\\". Then, in 1830, when he was searching for a simplified way of printing his more than 200 illustrations performed during the Langsdorff Expedition, other than using expensive and time-consuming engravings on wood and metal (xylography and lithography), he invented a new process, similar to the mimeograph, which he named \\"polygraphia\\", and began using this commercially in his printing office. As his technique evolved, he was able to combine colors, and to produce uncounterfeitable bank notes. In 1832, with the help of a pharmacist friend, Joaquim Correa de Mello, Florence began to study ways of permanently fixing camera obscura images, which he named \\"photographia\\". In 1833, they settled on silver nitrate on paper, a combination which had been the subject of experiments by Thomas Wedgwood around the year 1800. Unlike Wedgwood, who was unable to make photographs of real-world scenes with his camera or render the photograms that he did produce light-fast, Florence's notebooks indicate that he eventually succeeded in doing both. Unfortunately, partly because he never published his invention adequately, partly because he was an obscure inventor living in a remote and undeveloped province, H√©rcules Florence was never recognized internationally as one of the inventors of photography. A photographic image of several pharmaceutical flask labels, produced by Hercules Florence in Campinas, Brazil, in 1833 and entitled Epr√©uve N¬∫2 (photographie), currently in the collection of the Instituto Moreira Salles (IMS) in S√£o Paulo Brazil, (acquired by the IMS in 2002 from the collection of Pedro Corr√™a do Lago), is described by the IMS as the \\"oldest photographic record existing on the American continent, based on the sensitivity of silver salts to light\\". \\"Hercule Florence ‚Äì Apresenta√ß√£o\\".

He was the son of Yohannes I and Empress Sabla Wangel. According to G.W.B Huntingford, Iyasu \\"owed his reputation partly to the mildness of his character, exemplified in his treatment of the princes on Wehni in his first year, and his attention to religious matters, and partly to his abdication, retirement, and murder.\\"G.W.B Huntingford, The Historical Geography of Ethiopia (London: The British Academy, 1989), p.201. He was serving as governor of Gojjam when his father Yohannes summoned him and made him heir at the age of 20. (However, he did not have himself crowned until 1693.) During the first year of his reign, he attended to his brothers and other relatives imprisoned on Wehni, a moment recorded by James Bruce who describes how the Emperor replaced their rags with proper clothing and furnished the starving royals with a banquet.James Bruce, Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile (1805 edition), vol. 3, pp. 449‚Äì451 Life His reign is noteworthy for the attention he devoted to administration, holding a large number of councils to settle theological and ecclesiastical matters (the first in 1684, in the public square of Gondar), matters of state, and to proclaim laws. In 1698, Iyasu undertook a number of reforms, affecting customs and taxation, which encouraged trade. In the second year of his reign, he confronted an invasion of the Yejju and Wollo Oromo into Amhara, defeating them at Melka Shimfa.Bruce, Travels, vol. 3 pp. 454f After Qegnazmach Wale of Damot and Tabdan the Hermit proclaimed Yeshaq emperor in his fourth year (1685), Iyasu quickly suppressed this revolt, and captured Yeshaq, then waited a year before marching beyond southern Gojjam in a punitive expedition against the Agaws who had supported the rebels.Bruce, Travels, vol. 3 pp. 456‚Äì460 In 1688, he led a campaign in Dera, passing through Woremo against a rebellion in the Tulama country. The leader of the rebellion, a native of Debre Werq was captured after a pitched battle in a narrow defile, and condemned by a tribunal of ecclesiastics.E. A.

Iyasu's Palace in the Fasil Ghebbi, Gondar Solomon Getahun observes that \\"unlike his immediate predecessors, Iyasu's tenure was noted for endeavors to establish diplomatic ties with Christian monarchies like Louis XIV of France and Ethiopian delegates had been sent to foreign countries.\\"Solomon Getahun, History of the City of Gondar (Trenton: Red Sea Press, 2005), p. 7 In 1689, an embassy, led by an Armenian named Murad was sent to Batavia, Dutch East Indies. One of the benefits of these efforts was that Emperor Iyasu received a bell from Johannes Camphuys, governor of the Dutch East Indies, which was then donated to Debre Berhan Selassie Church in Gondar.Richard Pankhurst, Armenian Involvement in Ethiopian-Asian Trade 16th to 18th Centuries, p. 119-147, https://books.openedition.org/editionsmsh/11382 In 1692, the king undertook an expedition in the Mareb river valley, against the Dubani, or Nara, in present-day Gash Barka. At the sound of the musket, the tribesmen were terrified and fled.E. A.

This also led to the visit by a French physician, Charles Jacques Poncet, who traveled to the Empire to treat Iyasu and one of his sons. Poncet arrived at Gondar 21 July 1699 and stayed until September 1700. Poncet published an account of his visit to Paris in 1704, which included his personal impression of Iyasu the Great: :Although' he is not above one and forty years old, yet he has already a numerous issue. He has eight princes and three princesses. The Emperor has great qualities ‚Äì a quick and piercing wit [i.e. intelligence], a sweet and affable humor, and the stature of a hero. He is the most handsome man I have seen in Aethiopia. He is a lover of curious arts and sciences, but his chief passion is for war. He is brave and undaunted in battles, and always at the head of his troops. He has an extraordinary love for justice, which he administers to his subjects with great exactness; but whereas he is averse to blood, 'tis not without reluctance that he condemns a criminal [to death]. Such eminent qualities make him equally fear'd and belov'd by his subjects, who respect him even to adoration.William Foster, editor, The Red Sea and Adjacent Countries (London, Hakluyt Society, 1949), pp. 130f. The translation is an anonymous work printed in 1709; glosses appearing in square brackets are by Foster. In 1704, emperor Iyasu I campaigned south of Abay in the kingdom of Ennarea, where he was confronted with a civil war between two throne claimants. Hassen Mohammed, The Oromo of Ethiopia: A History 1570-1860, 1994 While he was campaigning in Gojjam against the Oromo, Iyasu learned that his favorite concubine, Kedeste Kristos, had died. Stricken with grief, he retired to an island in Lake Tana. Supported by Empress Malakotawit, some of the officials argued, after the precedent of the king Kaleb that he had abdicated, and crowned his son Tekle Haymanot Emperor. According to some accounts, this was not Iyasus' intent, and he marched from his hermitage in Lake Tana towards to Gondar to protest this; in any case, during this time he fell sick and was assassinated at Tekle Haymanot's orders. Iyasu's death caused much distress in the capital, especially amongst the priests of Debre Berhan Selassie, who openly displayed his gifts to them, and mourned their dead monarch for a month.Richard P.K. Pankhurst, History of Ethiopian Towns (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1982), pp. 142f Bruce writes that Iyasu was buried on Mitraha Island, where he was shown Iyasu's body interred amongst \\"the bodies of all his ancestors\\".Bruce, Travels, vol. 3 pp. 528f Once his brother Tewoflos became Emperor, he initiated Iyasu's canonization.

Tekle Haymanot became Emperor following Iyasus' retirement to an island in Lake Tana.

The involvement of his mother Melekotawit, and the acceptance of his position by other members of the dynasty did irreparable harm to the image of the monarchy. His own courtiers plotted against him, and discussions abounded about whether it was worthy to keep such a corrupt dynasty in power. While travelling in the provinces, Tekle Haymanot was stabbed to death by some of his late father's courtiers. James Bruce on the other hand states that Tekle Haymanot was murdered while hunting by two former courtiers of his father. (Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile [1805 edition], vol. 4 p. 14f.) Some historians date the beginning of the Ethiopian Zemene Mesafint or \\"Era of the Princes\\" (a time of disorder when the power of the monarchy was eclipsed by the power of local warlords) the murder of Iyasu the Great by his son Tekle Haymanot, and the resultant decline in the prestige of the dynasty.

He accused his late nephew Emperor Tekle Haymanot of regicide and patricide, and Tekle Haymanot has been known as Irgum (\\"Cursed\\") ever since.

However Yostos encountered many challenges to his authority, and was forced to remain in the capital of Gondar for his entire reign, leaving the city only to hunt. After a few years, the political situation stabilized enough for him to construct two new churches in Gondar, Lideta Mariyam (\\"Birth of the Virgin Mary\\") in 1713, and Abba Antons (\\"Father Anthony\\") in 1715.Richard P.K. Pankhurst, History of Ethiopian Towns (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1982), pp. 144f. Bruce notes that Yostos faced a conspiracy to depose him shortly after taking the throne: while he was away from Gondar on a hunt, a group of men he had entrusted his government to had planned to overthrow him. Yostos, with a body of picked men, returned to his capital at night and surprised them sitting in council. His chief minister, Ras Hezekias, and his Master of his Household, Heraclides, along with five others, had their nose and ears cut off then thrown into prison. One of the chief conspirators, Benaia Basile, however managed to escape, having been warned of Yostos' sudden return, but was later caught and punished.Bruce, Travels, vol. 4 p. 28 The following year Yostos led a slave-raiding expedition against one of the peoples, once collectively referred to as the Shangalla, who lived along the western border of his kingdom, specifically the people known as the Baasa. These he surprised, slaying the adults and taking their children captive. Yostos had his expedition brought to an end after this first predation when the death of his confidant Ras Fasa Krestos.Bruce, Travels, vol. 4 p. 49 In January 1716 Yostos grew ill, and according to his Royal Chronicles withdrew from public life. Bruce provides more information: while supervising the work on the Abba Antons church Yostos \\"was taken suddenly ill, and, suspecting some unwholesomeness or witchcraft in his palace, ordered his tent to be pitched without the town until his apartments should be smoked with gunpowder.\\" However, the fumigation accidentally burned down part of the palace, which was seen as a \\"very bad omen\\".Bruce, Travels, vol. 4 p. 52. Yostos, still unwell, took up residence in another part of the Royal Enclosure, but fear that he would make his son Fasil heir to the throne led to a battle between his courtiers (who wanted the ailing Emperor to proclaim an heir) and the Imperial Guard (who were loyal to the Solomonic dynasty). Victorious, the Imperial Guard proclaimed Dawit III Emperor on 30 January. Meanwhile, Emperor Yostos was still alive in the palace, forgotten in his sick bed until his death.

To respond to these challenges, writes Bruce, Bakaffa was \\"silent, secret, and unfathomable in his designs, surrounded by soldiers who were his own slaves, and by new men of his own creation.\\" In writing his account of this Emperor's reign, Bruce claims that at the time of his writing no Royal Chronicle of his reign existed, because it \\"would have been a very dangerous book to have been kept in Bacuffa's time; and, accordingly, no person chose ever to run that risk; and the king's particular behaviour afterwards had still the further effect, that nobody would supply this deficiency after his death, a general belief prevailing in Abyssinia that he is alive to this day, and will appear again in all his terrors.\\"Bruce, Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile (1790 edition), vol. 2 pp. 596f As a result, Bruce's account of Bakaffa's reign consists of a collection of impressionistic vignettes of selected events‚Äîhis travels through Ethiopia in disguise, his feigned death, his first meetings with people who were to play an important role during his rule‚Äîwhich support this portrait. In contrast, the editor of the 1805 edition of Bruce's work, Alexander Murray, excised all but the first two paragraphs of his chapter on this ruler, replacing Bruce's material with a summary of a chronicle of the reign, stating that \\"the annals of this period are very complete, the public transactions of Bacuffa are well known, though his motives seldom escaped from his own impenetrable breast.\\"Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile (1805 edition), vol. 4 p. 76  Life  Bakaffa spent his childhood confined on Wehni, but during the unrest in the last year of Emperor Yostos' reign he escaped to live with the Oromo; when he was recaptured, part of his nose was cut off as punishment, with the intent of disqualifying him for the throne. Nevertheless, upon the death of his brother Emperor Dawit III, he was selected to succeed him against the wishes of a sizable group backing Welde Giyorgis, the son of Nagala Mammit. While his reign was disturbed by few wars, Donald Levine observes that he \\"spent his days breaking the power of the feudal lords and strengthening the hand of the monarchy.\\"Donald N. Levine, Wax and Gold: Tradition and Innovation in Ethiopian Culture (Chicago: University Press, 1965), p. 24 However, Paul B. Henze believes that \\"his most valuable contribution to his capital and his country was his second wife, Mentewab ('How Beautiful!')\\".Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time, A History of Ethiopia (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 104 He also devoted much of his rule travelling in disguise around his realm to seek out inequities to correct, acts which, according to Edward Ullendorff, \\"have long become part of Ethiopian folklore.\\"Edward Ullendorff, The Ethiopians: An Introduction to Country and People, second edition (London: Oxford Press, 1965), p. 81 James Bruce retells at length the folk story of how Bakaffa met Empress Mentewab (his second wife) while he was on one of his frequent trips in disguise, and fell ill while visiting her home province of Qwara. He was put to bed in her father's house and she had nursed him during his illness, and upon his recovery, he had married her.Bruce, Travels to Discover (1790 edition), vol. 2 pp. 597ff An enduring tragic mystery is that of the death of his first wife. The Emperor had crowned his previous wife in the palace, and she had proceeded to the banqueting hall to preside over her coronation banquet. After taking part in the meal, she suddenly took ill and died that very night. Rumors of poisoning were rife. His second wife, Mentewab arrived as the new Empress in Gondar to a court that was suspicious and full of intrigue and danger. That she was able to engineer her way to power and influence in such an environment is very impressive, not to mention the dominant role that she would seize upon her husband's death. Bakaffa's Palace in Fasil Ghebbi, Gondar However, Bakaffa's reign at the time was not entirely happy. Fearful of the danger of insurrections against him, in 1727 he tested the attitude of his subjects by hiding in his palace for many days, with the result that the nobles and populace were alarmed. The governor of the city put a guard around the Royal Enclosure, at which point the crafty ruler emerged and rode to the Debre Berhan Selassie Church. While the unfortunate governor and several associates were executed the next day, Richard Pankhurst notes the public shared in this disaffection, quoting James Bruce that when rumor of Bakaffa's death circulated, \\"the joy was so great, so universal, that nobody attempted to conceal it\\"; and when he revealed that he was actually still alive, :There was no occasion to accuse the guilty. The whole court, and all strangers attending there upon business, fled, and spread a universal terror through the whole streets of Gondar. [...] What this sedition would have ended in, it is hard to know, had it not been for the immediate resolution of the king, who ordered a general pardon and amnesty to be proclaimed at the door of the palace.Bruce, Travels to Discover (1790 edition), vol. 2 pp. 601f Notwithstanding this clemency, Bakaffa later was quoted as remarking that although he loved the inhabitants of Gondar, they only responded with hate. Bakaffa added several new buildings to the capital city of Gondar. He is credited with the construction of a vast banqueting hall on the north side of the Royal Enclosure, which might be the structure where he held a lavish feast for all in 1725; next to it stands Mentewab's Castle, which might have been built by Bakaffa's son and heir Iyasu II, but definitely was constructed before Mentewab retired from the capital to her palace at Qusquam in 1750. These are last new buildings erected in the Royal Enclosure.Stuart Munro-Hay, Ethiopia, the unknown land: a cultural and historical guide (London: I.B. Tauris, 2002), pp. 132-4.

Chinchay in Quechua means ocelot and also means the cardinal point north. Before the Inca Civil War began, Atahualpa, the son of the deceased Inca Emperor Huayna Capac, inherited and ruled the majority of Chinchasuyu from his capital city in Quito, supported by Huayna Capac's veteran Inca generals and soldiers. The 12th Inca, Huayna Capac. knowing that he was about to die, gave orders to place his heart and organs in an Urn and have it buried in Quito, the city he loved. Moreover, Huayna Capac gave instructions that his mummified body should be transported to Cuzco for burial beside the mummified bodies of his royal ancestors. The Inca Emperor Huascar who was the eldest son of Huayna Capac, ruled the rest of the Inca Empire from Cuzco, and was displeased that Atahualpa was crown King in Quito. Spanish chroniclers refer to Atahualpa's Kingdom as the Kingdom of Quito. The Inca Huascar was not able to do anything since the best soldiers in the Inca Empire swore allegiance to Atahualpa. After 4 or 5 years of peace, the nobles as well as the mother of the Inca Huascar, Rava Ocllo. encouraged him to reconquer the Kingdom of Atahualpa which spanned most of the Chinchasuyu. Huascar sent an ultimatum to Atahualpa asking for submission, Atahualpa refused, and a young General Atoc was sent to invade and reconquer the Kingdom of Quito from Atahualpa.

He was the son of Emperor Bakaffa and Empress Mentewab (also known by her Baptismal name of Welete Giyorgis). The Empress Mentewab played a major role in Iyasu's reign, perhaps against her will. Shortly after he was proclaimed Emperor, a rival claimant assaulted the Royal Enclosure for eight days, only leaving the capital Gondar when an army of 30,000 from Gojjam appeared. Although the rebels failed to penetrate its walls, nonetheless much of Gondar was left in ruins.Donald N. Levine, Wax and Gold: Tradition and Innovation in Ethiopian Culture (Chicago: University Press, 1965), p. 24. Details from Remedius Prutky's account in J.H. Arrowsmith-Brown (trans.), Prutky's Travels in Ethiopia and other Countries with notes by Richard Pankhurst (London: Hakluyt Society, 1991), pp. 173f Instead of taking the title of regent upon the succession of her underage son, Empress Mentewab had herself crowned as co-ruler, becoming the first woman to be crowned in this manner in Ethiopian history. Empress Mentewab wielded significant authority throughout the reign of her son, and well into the reign of her grandson as well. Reign During Iyasu II's reign, a Czech Franciscan named Remedius Prutky visited his kingdom, and engaged Iyasu in talks about religion and European politics. Although he and his two companions were popular because of their medical skills, Prutky and his Catholic companion were asked to leave because of complaints from the local clergy after a year. Despite Mentewab's counsel, Iyasu proved to be an ineffectual monarch. According to Paul Henze, Iyasu \\"came under criticism for devoting too much time to pleasure (he loved hunting) and for spending too many resources on embellishing the capital, paying foreign workmen, and importing luxury goods, ornaments and mirrors from Europe.\\"Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 106 Prutky, on the other hand blamed Iyasu's constrained revenues to the actions of his mother Mentewab: \\"Since the youthful emperor Jasu had only reached the age of eight when he ascended the throne, his mother the Queen divided out the provinces among the chief ministers in such a way that, at the time of my sojourn there, the Emperor, now over thirty years of age, saw his treasury diminished and scarcely enough for his ordinary expenses.\\" Prutky adds that during the year Prutky was in Ethiopia (1752), the emperor was engaged in a struggle with his own sister over the revenues from Gojjam.Prutky's Travels, p. 306 In a bid to gain the respect of his subjects, the Emperor Iyasu engaged in a campaign against the Kingdom of Sennar, which ended in defeat at the Battle of the Dindar River in 1738; an icon of Christ and a piece of the True Cross carried into battle were captured, and had to be ransomed for 8,000 ounces of gold.E. A. Wallis Budge, A History of Ethiopia: Nubia and Abyssinia, 1928 (Oosterhout, the Netherlands: Anthropological Publications, 1970), pp. 454f. This defeat decisively ended any hope by Iyasu to prove himself competent in military affairs; as Donald Levine writes, \\"The subsequent subdual of Lasta, a rebel region for generations, and Iyasu's raids against tribes in the Atbara district were not sufficient to redeem that defeat or restore the force of Gondar.\\"Levine, Wax and Gold, p. 24 During his reign two infestations of locusts afflicted the land, and an epidemic took the lives of thousands. When Abuna Krestodolos died, the treasury lacked money to pay for procurement of a new abuna. According to Edward Ullendorff, his authority \\"scarcely extended beyond Begemder and Gojjam; Shoa and Lasta acknowledged only a token allegiance, while in the Tigray the long rule of the powerful Ras Mika'el had begun.\\"Edward Ullendorff, The Ethiopians: An Introduction to Country and People, second edition (London: Oxford Press, 1965), p. 81 Iyasu II also conferred the dignity of Kantiba of the Habab (Nakfa and Sahel areas of present-day Eritrea) to Habtes, of the Bet Asegede family, after the latter came to Gondar to pay homage.

Empress Mentewab became involved with Iyasu, the son of her former sister-in-law Romanework, who was herself the sister of the late Emperor Bakaffa, and on her father's side descended in male line from another cadet line of the Solomonic dynasty. Mentewab's relationship with the much younger nephew of her late husband was considered a great scandal, and the young Prince was derisively referred to as \\"Melmal Iyasu\\", or \\"Iyasu the Kept\\". The Empress had three daughters by this Melmal Iyasu, one of whom was the beautiful Woizero Aster Iyasu who took Ras Mikael Sehul in 1769 as her third husband. Emperor Iyasu became very attached to his half-sisters, but was deeply resentful of their father. It is said that it was the Emperor himself that ordered the murder of his mother's lover by having him pushed from a cliff top near Lake Tana in 1742.Tekle Tsadik Mekuria, Ye Ityopia Tarik Ke Atse Libne Dingil iske Atse Tewodros (\\"History of Ethiopia from Emperor Lebna Dengel to Emperor Tewodros\\") (Birhanena Selam Printing Press) Death The bones of Mentewab, Iyasu II, and Iyoas I, in Kuskwam (Gondar) Iyasu fell seriously ill in May, 1755, and died the next month. It was generally believed that he had been poisoned by the sister of Melmal Iyasu, in revenge for her brother's death. When the Empress Mentewab sought funds from the treasury for his funeral, only a few dinars could be found. Saddened by this situation, she threatened to retire to her palace convent at Qusquam, but a group of nobles persuaded her to instead become regent for her grandson Iyoas I.The Royal Chronicle of his reign is translated in part by Richard K.

According to some sources, Antisuyu was not the smallest of the Incan suyus, citing that its territory may have included the eastern slope of the Tahuantinsuyu as well as the adjoining tropical lowlands along the length of the empire. Antisuyu and Chinchaysuyu were bordered by a line west of the Inca road that ran from Cusco to Tambomachay. The suyu was also separated from Collasuyu by the Huatanay River, which flowed through the city to the eastern end of the valley. Most of the lowland jungle was not part of Tawantinsuyu. Only the jungle region could not be dominated by the Incas, given that they could not colonize the jungle region. Arguably, the first organized and planned naval action of Peru, was in time of the Sapa Inca Tupac Inca Yupanqui, as it mobilized 10,000 men and their supplies on large rafts navigating the rivers, a task that took two years, After that campaign, he went to the rupa rupa of the Chunchus, which was a catastrophe for the Incas, since, according to some authors, only 1,000 soldiers returned alive.

The series follows the adventures of an unwilling hero of the same name and has a strong fantasy setting similar to Sierra's King's Quest and Westwood's The Legend of Kyrandia series. The game varies in style, however, as it is more poised to be a parody of the fantasy genre than a member of the genre itself, with many renowned folklore characters appearing differently from what they are generally presumed to be. The first two games are often compared with the Monkey Island series in terms of style and humour, and the Terry Pratchett Discworld novels and derivative games. Unlike many older adventure games, several of the titles in the series are still available for purchase. The first and second games in the series are also playable using ScummVM.  Titles  =Simon the Sorcerer= Simon the Sorcerer was released by Adventure Soft on 2 January 1993 in DOS and Amiga formats. The story begins with the protagonist, Simon, as an ordinary teenager. His dog Chippy discovers a chest in the loft of his house containing a spellbook titled \\"Ye Olde Spellbooke\\". Simon throws the book onto the floor in contempt, but a portal opens above it. Chippy goes through the portal and Simon follows. After entering the portal, Simon finds himself in another world. After escaping from some goblins who intended to eat him, he discovers that he has been brought on a quest to rescue the wizard Calypso from the evil sorcerer Sordid. The game includes parodies of various popular books and fairy tales, including Rapunzel, The Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia, Jack and the Beanstalk and the Three Billy Goats Gruff. Simon is voiced by Chris Barrie. This game marks the first appearance of two somewhat inept demons, who are recurring characters throughout the remainder of the series. =Simon the Sorcerer II: The Lion, the Wizard and the Wardrobe= Simon the Sorcerer II: The Lion, the Wizard and the Wardrobe was released by Adventure Soft in 1995. The title is a parody of the Chronicles of Narnia book The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Brian Bowles voices Simon, making him sound older, presumably in his late-teens. In the game, the father of a peasant boy, Runt, burns his book of magic and throws it into the centre of a pentagram on the floor, inadvertently bringing Sordid back to life as a spirit. He transfers his spirit to a robotic body, and sends a magical wardrobe to retrieve Simon from his own dimension. The wardrobe mistakenly brings Simon to the doorstep of Calypso's Magic Shop. Upon returning to consciousness Simon learns that, in order to return home, he must find the wardrobe's power source, called mucusade (a pun on Lucozade). =Simon the Sorcerer's Pinball= A pinball video game released in 1998 by Adventure Soft for Microsoft Windows. =Simon the Sorcerer's Puzzle Pack= A puzzle game released in 1998 by Adventure Soft for Microsoft Windows. It contains three games: * Swampy Adventures ‚Äì The player must help the Swampling through 50 levels of puzzles as he attempts to rescue his children from the evil Sordid. * NoPatience ‚Äì A set of four solitaire card games, featuring a unique Simon the Sorcerer themed deck. * Jumble ‚Äì A twist on a sliding puzzle featuring a constantly changing animation. The game also features a desktop virtual pet known as \\"Demon in My Pocket\\" as well as three Simon the Sorcerer desktop themes. =Simon the Sorcerer 3D= The third adventure game in the series, Simon the Sorcerer 3D was initially designed fully in 2D and was intended to be released as a high quality 2D adventure. Due to publisher hesitation in picking up a 2D title, the developers later decided to switch it to a 3D adventure game. The game follows on directly after Simon the Sorcerer II's open ending, with a cutscene at the beginning telling the player a connecting story of how Simon's body was rejoined to his soul by a new character, Melissa. =Simon the Sorcerer 4: Chaos Happens= The fourth adventure game marks a return to the heralded point-and-click interface and features high quality pre-rendered backgrounds. The characters are in 3D. The German version of this game was released 23 February 2007,Simon 4 release information and was developed by Silver Style Entertainment. The English version of this game was released on 17 October 2008,Simon 4 release information and was published by Playlogic. =Simon the Sorcerer 5: Who'd Even Want Contact?!= In the fifth adventure game, aliens threaten the fantasy world. The German version was released for PC on 26 March 2009. It was released for digital download in English on 17 February 2010. =Simon the Sorcerer 6: Between Worlds= StoryBeasts, an Irish company based in Dublin undertook the sixth release of the series, announcing in 2014 that the original voice actor Chris Barrie was enrolled for Simon's voice. In Between Worlds Simon returns to his British slacker roots and is forced to deal with a convergence of two worlds. As portals to another dimension begin to open up, he is forced to come face-to-face with his more hard-working, respectful and competent counterpart Simone with whom he must work to bring balance back to their universes. The game harkens back to the original two Simon the Sorcerer games and was to feature fully hand-drawn 2D animated worlds and characters. On February 10, 2016, StoryBeasts announced via their website that after two years of work in the game, both the planned Kickstarter campaign and the game development had been halted indefinitely due to unforeseen events. The game was intended to be episodic. The game didn't get made due to funding and publisher difficulties.  Common elements  =About Simon= Simon the Sorcerer is a teenager transported into a fantasy world as a sorcerer dressed in a cloak and pointy hat; his cloak and hat are purple in the first game, but change to red for the rest of the series (aside from possible magical colour changes in the third game). He must use his logic and magical skills to solve puzzles as he progresses through the games. Simon is rude and insulting to many of the characters he meets. This tends to interfere with the success of his quests, forcing him to go to ridiculous lengths in order to complete puzzles. Simon also breaks the fourth wall with his comments about adventure games.

The Grand Tour was a NASA program that would have sent two groups of robotic probes to all the planets of the outer Solar System. It called for four spacecraft, two of which would visit Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto, while the other two would visit Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. The enormous cost of the project, around $1 billion, led to its cancellation and replacement with Mariner Jupiter-Saturn, which became the Voyager program. Background The concept of the Grand Tour began in 1964, when Gary Flandro of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) noted that an alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune that would occur in the late 1970s would enable a single spacecraft to visit all of the outer planets by using gravity assists. The particular alignment occurs once every 175 years. By 1966, JPL was promoting the project, noting it would allow a complete survey of the outer planets in less time and for less money than sending individual probes to each planet. Grand Tour In 1969, NASA created the Outer Planets Working Group, which favored the concept of two missions that would visit three planets each (including Pluto, which was considered a planet at the time). These missions were referred to as the Grand Tour. One would launch in 1977 and visit Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto, while the other would launch in 1979 and visit Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. This would reduce total mission time compared to a single Grand Tour from over thirteen years to seven and a half years. The Working Group also called for the development of a new spacecraft to carry out the flyby missions. These probes, called Thermoelectric Outer Planets Spacecraft (TOPS), were being designed at JPL and featured an operational life of over ten years. The plan was set out in a report by 23 scientists, released on August 3, 1969. The study panel was co- chaired by James A. Van Allen of the University of Iowa and Gordon J.F. MacDonald of the University of California, Santa Barbara. President Nixon gave White House support to the concept in a statement released on March 7, 1970. By 1971, the estimated cost of Grand Tour was $750 to $900 million, plus over $100 million to launch the spacecraft. Congressional pressure, combined with internal competition from the recently approved Space Shuttle program, led to the decision to cancel the project in December 1971. The Grand Tour and TOPS were replaced with a proposal to visit only two planets using a pair of Mariner-derived probes. Mariner Jupiter-Saturn The Mariner Jupiter-Saturn project was approved in early 1972, with an estimated cost of less than $360 million for each of two probes. The probes would be built by JPL, with the intention that they would last long enough to complete the original Grand Tour of the four giant planets, but be advertised as missions to only Jupiter and Saturn to reduce estimated total project costs. The probes were to visit Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn's moon Titan. Titan was a valuable target, as it was the only moon known to have an atmosphere, and a flyby would gather information that would not otherwise be obtainable, including the density, composition, and temperature of the atmosphere. Two trajectories were selected. One was designated JST: its mission would take it to Jupiter, Saturn, and Titan, with the probe's trajectory designed to optimize the Titan flyby. The second was designated JSX: it would be launched on a trajectory that would preserve the option of a Grand Tour, while serving as backup for the first probe. It would arrive after JST, and if JST were successful, it could continue with the Grand Tour. If JST was unsuccessful, JSX could be diverted to perform the Titan flyby itself, which would eliminate the possibility of a Grand Tour. In March 1977, just a few months before launch, NASA held a competition to rename the project. Voyager Voyager 1's view of Titan. The two spacecraft that launched retained the same mission concept. Voyager 1's course was optimized for the Titan flyby and Voyager 2 for the Grand Tour. Voyager 2 would reach Saturn nine months after Voyager 1, giving plenty of time to decide if it should proceed with the Grand Tour. Additionally, by launching Voyager 2 first, Voyager 1's launch could be re- targeted to perform the Grand Tour if Voyager 2 were lost in a launch failure. An option to skip Voyager 1's Titan flyby and proceed from Saturn to Pluto was identified, though Titan was still considered the more interesting target, especially after images from Pioneer 11 indicated a very substantial atmosphere. Though atmospheric haze obscured any images of Titan's surface, Voyager 1's flyby obtained valuable information about the moon, including data that offered compelling evidence for the existence of liquid hydrocarbon lakes on Titan's surface. With Voyager 1's mission complete, Voyager 2 was cleared for an extended mission to Uranus and Neptune, fulfilling the goal of a Grand Tour as proposed in 1964.

It is distinguished by two layers of almond paste or marzipan, one in the middle and one on top. The top layer is capped by a circle of \\"eggs\\" made of the same paste, and is lightly browned under a grill. It was originally made for the fourth Sunday in Lent, also known as Laetare Sunday, the Refreshment Sunday of Lent (when the 40-day fast would be relaxed), Mothering Sunday, the Sunday of the Five Loaves, or Simnel Sunday ‚Äì named after the cake. However, in more recent times it is also eaten throughout the pre-Easter period, and especially on Easter Sunday. While the popularity of simnel cake waned throughout the twentieth century, it has recently enjoyed a marked resurgence, which has been largely attributed to public endorsements by a number of prominent bakers.  Decoration  Simnel cake Conventionally 11, or occasionally 12, marzipan balls are used to decorate the cake, with a story that the balls represent the 12 apostles, minus Judas or Jesus and the twelve apostles, minus Judas. An early reference to decorating with marzipan balls appears in May Byron's Pot-Luck Cookery but with no mention of the modern story, and her version may well be derived from earlier styles, which were sometimes crenelated. Ingredients Simnel cake is a light fruitcake, generally made from these ingredients: white flour, sugar, butter, eggs, fragrant spices, dried fruits, zest and candied peel. Sometimes orange flower water or brandy is used, either in the cake batter or to flavour the almond paste. In most modern versions marzipan or almond paste is used as a filling for the cake, with a layer laid in the middle of the mix before the cake is cooked, and it is also used as decoration on the top. Most recipes require at least 90 minutes of cooking, and advise using several layers of baking parchment to line the tin, and sometimes brown paper wrapped around the outside to stop the marzipan burning. History Shrewsbury Simnel Cake with pastry covering and crenulated decoration, 1869 Simnel cakes have been known since at least medieval times. Bread regulations of the time suggest they were boiled and then baked, a technique which led to an invention myth, in circulation from at least 1745 until the 1930s, whereby a mythical couple, Simon and Nelly, fall out over making a Simnel. One wishes to boil it, one to bake it and, after beating each other with various household implements, they compromise on one which uses both cooking techniques. Simnel cakes are often associated with Mothering Sunday, also known as Simnel-Sunday. According to historian Ronald Hutton, in 17th Century Gloucestershire and Worcestershire the custom of live-in apprentices and domestic servants going home to visit their mothers on Mothering Sunday started, checking that their families were well and taking food or money if needed. This was a time of year when food stocks were low, and the high-calorie simnel cake was useful nutrition. The cake later became simply an Easter cake. The meaning of the word \\"simnel\\" is unclear: there is a 1226 reference to \\"bread made into a simnel\\", which is understood to mean the finest white bread, from the Latin simila ‚Äì \\"fine flour\\" (from which 'semolina' also derives). John de Garlande felt that the word was equivalent to placenta cake, a cake that was intended to please. A popular legend attributes the invention of the Simnel cake to Lambert Simnel; however, references to the cake were recorded some 200 years before his birth. Different towns had their own recipes and shapes of the Simnel cake. Bury, Devizes and Shrewsbury produced large numbers to their own recipes, but it is the Shrewsbury version that became most popular and well known.The illustration is from the 1869, Chambers Book of Days which says :‚ÄúIt is an old custom in Shropshire and Herefordshire, and especially at Shrewsbury, to make during Lent and Easter, and also at Christmas, a sort of rich and expensive cakes, which are called Simnel Cakes. They are raised cakes, the crust of which is made of fine flour and water, with sufficient saffron to give it a deep yellow colour, and the interior is filled with the materials of a very rich plum-cake, with plenty of candied lemon peel, and other good things. They are made up very stiff; tied up in a cloth, and boiled for several hours, after which they are brushed over with egg, and then baked. When ready for sale the crust is as hard as if made of wood, ...... the accompanying engraving, representing large and small cakes as now on sale in Shrewsbury.

The party sharply distanced itself from the republic uprising in February 1927 (which had sought to reinstate the 1911 constitution). The national conference of 1930 decided that the party should openly cooperate with the government. One of the main leaders of the party at the time, Ramado Curto, was commissioned by the government to formulate a labour code. From 1930 he worked with the reformist trade unions in the corporativist National Economic Committee.

The acid number is a measure of the number of carboxylic acid groups in a chemical compound, such as a fatty acid, or in a mixture of compounds. In a typical procedure, a known amount of sample dissolved in an organic solvent (often isopropanol) and titrated with a solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH) of known concentration using phenolphthalein as a colour indicator. The acid number is used to quantify the acidity of a substance e.g. biodiesel.

Acid number (mg KOH/g oil) for biodiesel should to be lower than 0.50 mg KOH/g in both EN 14214 and ASTM D6751 standard fuels. This is since the FFA produced may corrode automotive parts and these limits protect vehicle engines and fuel tanks. As oil-fats rancidify, triglycerides are converted into fatty acids and glycerol, causing an increase in acid number. A similar observation is observed with biodiesel aging through analogous oxidation processes and when subjected to prolonged high temperatures (ester thermolysis) or through exposure to acids or bases (acid/base ester hydrolysis).

Its extreme aridity is caused by the upwelling of cold coastal waters and subtropical atmospheric subsidence, but it is also subject to occasional flooding during El Ni√±o years. In 1728, the town of Sechura was destroyed by a tsunami and was later rebuilt in its present location. In 1998, runoff from flooding rivers caused the formation of a temporary lake some long filling the Bay√≥var Depression. Short rivers flowing across the desert from the Andes support intensive irrigation-based agriculture. Location and extent Desiertos del Per√∫ - Deserts of Peru Within Peru, the desert is described as the strip along the northern Pacific coast of Peru in the southern Piura and western Lambayeque regions, and extending from the coast 20‚Äì100 km inland to the secondary ridges of the Andes Mountains. At its northern end near the city of Piura, the Sechura Desert transitions to the Tumbes-Piura dry forests ecoregion. Including much of eastern Lambayeque Region, this habitat is composed of equatorial dry forests. The total area of the Sechura Desert is 5000 km¬≤. History While a desert, the Sechura has been subject to flooding from rivers and to storms driven in from the Pacific Ocean. In 1728, a tsunami generated from an earthquake swept inland, destroying the town of Sechura, then located closer to the water. Survivors moved inland and re-established the town in its current location. During El Ni√±o years, flooding in the desert regularly occurs. In 1998, the runoff from the flooding rivers poured into the coastal Sechura Desert. Where there had been nothing but arid, hardscrabble waste for 15 years, suddenly, the second- largest lake in Peru had developed: 90 mi (145 km) long, 20 mi (30 km) wide, and 10 ft (3 m) deep, with occasional parched domes of sand and clay poking up from the surface. Climate The Peruvian Desert has a low range of temperature changes due to the moderating effect of the nearby Pacific Ocean. Because of the upwelling of cold coastal waters and subtropical atmospheric subsidence, the desert is one of the most arid on Earth. Summer (December through March) is warm and sunny with temperatures above during the day, and temperatures that average over . In the winter (June through September) the weather is cool and cloudy with temperatures that vary from at night to during the day. Geography Nazca Lines in the Sechura Desert The Bay√≥var Depression, which is the lowest point in Peru and all of the Southern Tropics, is located in this desert. The numerous short rivers that cross the Sechura supported prehistoric indigenous human settlements for millennia. A number of urban cultures flourished here, including the Moche. The Moche survived on a diet of fish, guinea pigs, camelids, squash, and peanuts. The Sican Culture (circa 800‚Äì1300 CE) succeeded the Moche, and developed refined techniques of lost wax goldsmithing. Today, the rivers support intensive irrigated agriculture on the fertile bottomlands. Two of Peru's five largest cities, including Piura and Chiclayo, lie within the agricultural region in the north.

The company has been a subsidiary of the German company HeidelbergCement since August 2007, and was formerly listed on the London Stock Exchange and a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. History Hanson was built up by James Hanson, later Lord Hanson, and Gordon White, later Baron White of Hull, who set up Hanson Trust in 1964.Hanson: History Hanson and White were willing to take a wide range of measures to do so, including mass redundancies, and therefore attracted opposition and accusations that they were asset strippers, but from 1979 the company was successful from the shareholders' point of view and respected during the early 1980s, with Hanson (who gave millions of pounds to the Conservatives) admired by Margaret Thatcher. One of the most notable takeovers, at least to the general public, was the acquisition in 1983 of the United Drapery Stores, or UDS Group, which owned many of Britain's most well known high street clothes shops and department stores, including John Collier, Richard Shops and the chain of Allders department stores. To fund this purchase, Hanson broke up UDS and sold John Collier to a management buy out team, and Richard Shops to Habitat, keeping only the core department store business. The Hanson cement works in Ketton In January 1986, Hanson bought SCM, an American chemicals to typewriters business. This included the paper division that was formerly the Allied Paper Corporation. Hanson sold most of the SCM business units and the headquarters building in New York City for a significant profit. Its most significant single purchase, however, was probably its takeover of Imperial Tobacco Group in 1986. Hanson paid ¬£2.5 billion for the group then undertook a major reorganisation; divestitures netted ¬£2.3 billion, leaving Hanson with the hugely profitable tobacco business for \\"next to nothing.\\" Hanson sold off the food brand, Golden Wonder, to Dalgety plc in 1986. In November 1988, Hanson went on to buy Consolidated Gold Fields for ¬£3.5bn. The Gold Survey was taken on by a new company, now known as GFMS. An attempt in September 1991 to purchase Imperial Chemical Industries, once seen by many in Britain as the nation's leading company but then in decline, was highly controversial, and ended in failure. Hanson did secure the takeover of Beazer, a major housebuilder, that year. By the mid 1990s, conglomerates were no longer popular with the investment community. Some of the manufacturing businesses were spun off as US Industries in February 1995. In January 1996, Hanson ended its time as a diversified conglomerate by breaking itself up into four separate listed companies: Hanson plc, Imperial Tobacco, The Energy Group and Millennium Chemicals. This deal cost Lord Hanson ¬£95 million by August 1996. Lord Hanson stepped down as chairman in December 1997. Led by Andrew Dougal, chief executive from 1997 until 2002, Hanson focused on building materials, becoming the world's biggest aggregates supplier and the second largest supplier of ready-mixed concrete. In November 1999, Hanson acquired Australian building materials business Pioneer International. Dougal quit the group in early 2002 to \\"rebalance\\" his life, leaving with a controversially large pay- off (variously reported at between ¬£400,000 and ¬£660,000, plus a pension top- up of ¬£636,700). In May 2007, HeidelbergCement announced its intent to purchase Hanson PLC for ¬£11 per share, a deal worth approximately ¬£8 billion. This deal made the combined company the second largest cement and building materials company in the world. The transaction was completed through Heidelberg subsidiary Lehigh UK on 22 August 2007. In December 2014, Heidelberg Cement agreed to sell its Hanson Building Products division to the private equity firm Lone Star for ¬£900 million.

Physical control may be lost; the person may be unable to remain still; and even if the \\"goal\\" of the person is met, they may not be calmed. Throwing a temper tantrum can lead to a child being placed in timeout, being grounded or even being suspended from school for older school age children. A tantrum may be expressed in a tirade: a protracted, angry speech. In early childhood Tantrums are one of the most common forms of problematic behavior in young children but tend to decrease in frequency and intensity as the child grows older. For the toddler, tantrums can be considered as normal, even as gauges of developing strength of character.Child having a tantrum While tantrums are sometimes seen as a predictor of future anti-social behaviour, in another sense they are simply an age-appropriate sign of excessive frustration, and will diminish over time given a calm and consistent handling. Parental containment where a child cannot contain itself‚Äîrather than what the child is ostensibly demanding‚Äîmay be what is really required. Selma Fraiberg warned against \\"too much pressure or forceful methods of control from the outside\\" in child-rearing: \\"if we turn every instance of pants changing, treasure hunting, napping, puddle wading and garbage distribution into a governmental crisis we can easily bring on fierce defiance, tantrums, and all the fireworks of revolt in the nursery\\".  Intellectual and developmental disorders  Some people who have developmental disorders such as autism, ADHD, and intellectual disability could be more vulnerable to tantrums than others, although anyone experiencing brain damage (temporary or permanent) can suffer from tantrums. Anyone may be prone to tantrums once in a while, regardless of gender or age. However, a meltdown due to sensory overload (which even neurotypical children can experience) is not the same as a temper tantrum. Aberrations Freud considered that the Wolf Man's development of temper tantrums was connected with his seduction by his sister: he became \\"discontented, irritable and violent, took offence on every possible occasion, and then flew into a rage and screamed like a savage\\". Freud linked the tantrums to an unconscious need for punishment driven by feelings of guilt‚Äîsomething which he thought could be generalised to many other cases of childhood tantrums. Heinz Kohut contended that tantrums were narcissistic rages, caused by the thwarting of the infant's grandiose- exhibitionist core. The blow to the inflated self-image, when a child's wishes are (however justifiably) refused, creates fury because it strikes at the feeling of omnipotence.Edmund Bergler in J. Halliday/P. Fuller eds., The Psychology of Gambling (London 1974) p. 182 Jealousy over the birth of a sibling, and resulting aggression, may also provoke negativistic tantrums, as the effort at controlling the feelings overloads the child's system of self- regulation. In later life Writer William Makepeace Thackeray claimed that in later life \\"you may tell a tantrum as far as you can see one, by the distressed and dissatisfied expression of its countenance‚Äî'Tantrumical', if we may term it so\\". Heinz Kohut contended that \\"the infant's core is likely to contain a self-centred, grandiose-exhibitionist part\\", and that \\"tantrums at being frustrated thus represent narcissistic rages\\" at the blow to the inflated self-image. With \\"a child confronted with some refusal ... regardless of its justifications, the refusal automatically provokes fury, since it offends his sense of omnipotence\\". The willingness of the celebrity to throw tantrums whenever thwarted to the least degreeCooper Lawrence, The Cult of Celebrity (2009) p. 72 is a kind of Acquired Situational NarcissismSimon Crompton, All about Me (London 2007) p. 176 or tantrumical behavior.

The band comprised Susman, Gaze, Mia Clarke, and Ros Murray. Their music drew from wide range of influences including Neu!, Stereolab, Sonic Youth, and the Velvet Underground. Although the band had strong feminist and political views in their personal lives, they generally preferred to not communicate that directly to their fans or through their music; one exception is their inclusion of the protest song \\"The Partisan,\\" which they began playing while on tour in the United States during the months preceding the 2004 Presidential election. The band, when playing live, had a reputation for a focused show that minimised audience interaction and rarely included more than one encore. History = Early years (1998‚Äì2000) = The band recorded their first single, \\"Film Music,\\" and released it in January 2000 on the Skint Records offshoot label Indenial. They released another single (\\"Le Song\\") with Fierce Panda before creating their own label, Let's Rock!, with distribution by 3MV. The first two singles they released were \\"Gabriel\\" and \\"Blue Straggler\\" and in fall of 2000 they began work on their debut album. During this period, they had a number of personnel changes. The original bassist was Tracy Houdek, who left the band due to a pregnancy. She was briefly replaced by Rupert Noble until Rachel Dalley signed on. Original guitarist Debbie Ball was replaced by Mia Clarke. = Rock It to the Moon (2000‚Äì2003) = Their debut album, Rock It to the Moon, was released in April 2001 through Mr. Lady Records. Although Electrelane started off as a traditional band with vocals, this album was mostly instrumental. Verity Susman explained, \\"Way way back, when we first started, we always had a lot of singing. But it never worked that well. When we did instrumental it was always more interesting. More completely we felt like we were doing something good, while the songs with the singing ended up quite bog-standard, boring, not very interesting.\\" NME rated the album an 8 out of 10, saying Rock It to the Moon was \\"just the way a debut album should be... utterly focused [and] stripped of all extraneous flab.\\" = The Power Out (2003‚Äì2004) = Electrelane brought in Steve Albini to record their second album, The Power Out, while production was still handled by the band. The result was an album that added more vocals and structure to the songs, giving them almost pop-like vibes. It was released on Too Pure in February 2004. The album was widely recognised and praised as critics appreciated the added complexity and vocals on their new work. Electrelane had not only added vocals to the work, but had transcended conventional expectations by employing a number of techniques. Of the nine songs with vocals, three of them were done in different languages. The album opener \\"Gone Under Sea\\" is sung completely in French. The third song, \\"The Valleys,\\" featuring the vocals of the ensemble Chicago a cappella, had in part sections from Siegfried Sassoon's \\"A Letter Home.\\" On \\"Oh Sombra!\\" the Spanish lyrics are a sonnet by 16th century Catalan poet Juan Bosc√°n Almog√°ver. On \\"This Deed\\" the lyrics are a single line, in German, from Friedrich Nietzsche's Die fr√∂hliche Wissenschaft followed by the exclamation \\"H√§nde hoch!\\" (or \\"Hands up!\\"). These touches, as one review put it, \\"managed to be unique without being a radical departure.\\" Midway through 2004, Rachel Dalley left the group and was replaced by Ros Murray, an old friend of the group. = Axes (2004‚Äì2006) = For their follow up, the mostly instrumental Axes, Electrelane once again returned to Steve Albini's studio in Chicago. In the first recording session for Axes, the band played through the entire album in one take. This reflected the band's desire to have listeners of the album experience the band's live show. Emma Gaze explained the album was recorded \\"the way we rehearse and practise: we all stand in a circle and it is very relaxed. Our previous recording experiences have been with the bass in one room, the drums in a different room, the two guitarists in a different room and then the vocals are done afterwards. Obviously it works like that because that is how most bands do it. But we just wanted it to sound more live; there is a different kind of energy that comes from playing in the same room.\\" Verity Susman said that \\"We see the record as a continuous piece of music, not a collection of songs. It also reflects the way we improvise, moving from one idea to the next without a clear break. It's also how we play live.\\" The album was released on 9 May 2005 to mixed, but generally positive reviews. As with The Power Out, Electrelane supported Axes with a global tour. By now they had toured in the UK, the United States, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Ireland, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Japan and Australia. They both headlined their own tours and supported tours for the Ex and Le Tigre among others; they had also appeared at festivals such as South by Southwest and the ATP Festival. = No Shouts, No Calls and indefinite hiatus (2006‚Äì2007) = No Shouts, No Calls is Electrelane's fourth studio album, and their first which was entirely digitally recorded and mixed. The group began writing material in Berlin's Planet Roc studios in the summer of 2006, at the height of the World Cup. During that period, the band became fans of the sport, going so far as to rearrange their recording schedules around the event and including a sample of a match between Hertha BSC Berlin and FC Moskva in the song \\"Five\\" of their new album. In August, Electrelane released Singles, B-Sides & Live, a rarities collection that included a number of live performances as well as original versions of tracks from their debut album. In September and October, they were in Benton Harbor recording and mixing their album. In November, the band announced on their official website that they had finished recording and had titled their album No Shouts, No Calls. The album was released in on 23 April 2007 in Japan, 3 May 2007 in the US and 30 April 2007 elsewhere. The first single, titled \\"To the East,\\" was released on 12 March 2007. The album received generally positive reviews, with Heather Phares of AllMusic calling some songs \\"among the band's finest work\\"; detractors included Leonie Cooper of the Guardian, who mentioned the band had a \\"penchant for turning every tune [into] a proggy wig-out.\\" James Reed of the Boston Globe picked the album as one of the best of 2007. In May and June 2007 the band toured the United States with Tender Forever and opened for Arcade Fire on several of their shows. For the rest of the summer, they played the Fuji Rock Festival in Japan as well as various festivals in Europe, including La Route du Rock, Summercase, Montreux Jazz Festival and Festival Paredes de Coura. In early November 2007, Electrelane posted a message on their website, explaining that they would be on an indefinite hiatus. Their \\"last\\" show \\"for the foreseeable future\\" was on 1 December 2007 in Brighton, England. On 14 December, the band organised a benefit for the Anti-Trafficking Alliance at the Barfly in London. They did not perform, choosing to DJ instead. = Brief reformation (2011‚Äì2012) = In February 2011, Electrelane announced they would play several festivals, including Field Day in London. During the spring, the band announced they would play The Big Chill festival held on the grounds of Eastnor Castle. They toured Australia in early 2012 as well. At the time, they announced no plans for new material or further tours.

Rather than training students for contests or providing courses for credit, Mathcamp introduces students to the various branches of advanced mathematics they are otherwise unlikely to discover until well into their college years. Mathcamp was founded in 1993 by Dr. George Thomas, who recognized that students interested in mathematics frequently lacked the resources and camaraderie to pursue their interest. Mira Bernstein became the director when Thomas left in 2002 to found MathPath, a program for younger students. Mathcamp is held each year on a different college campus in the United States or Canada. Past locations have included the University of Toronto, the University of Washington, Colorado College, Reed College, University of Puget Sound, Colby College, the University of British Columbia, Mount Holyoke College, and the Colorado School of Mines. Mathcamp enrolls about 120 students yearly, 45-55 returning and 65-75 new. The application process for new students includes an entrance exam (the \\"Qualifying Quiz\\"), personal essay, and two letters of recommendation, but no grade reports. The process helps ensure that the students who are most passionate about math come to camp. Admission is selective: in 2016, the acceptance rate was 15%. Classes at Mathcamp come in four designations of pace and difficulty. The milder classes often include basic proof techniques, number theory, graph theory, and combinatorial game theory, while the spicier classes cover advanced topics in abstract algebra, topology, theoretical computer science, category theory, and mathematical analysis. There are generally four class periods each day and five classes offered during each period, allowing students to create a custom schedule of classes that match their interests and background. Graduate student mentors teach most of the classes, while undergraduate junior counselors, all of them Mathcamp alumni, do most of the behind-the-scenes work. Each year there are a number of renowned guest speakers, who have included John Conway, Avi Wigderson, and Serge Lang. Since Mathcamp is as much designed to let students interested in mathematics meet each other as for them to meet math, staff and campers organize a number of non-mathematical events such as field trips, hikes, a puzzle hunt, and game tournaments. The campers also enjoy a great deal of freedom and are expected to act responsibly. In this way, Mathcamp often eases the transition to the full freedom and responsibility of college. Culture Mathcamp culture is best described as quirky and fun-loving. In 2004, some campers created Foodtongue, a constructed language in which every word is a word that means a food in the English language. One of the cardinal rules of the language is an agreed ban of direct translation. Foodtongue remains popular among campers, and there now exists an active wiki, updated and referenced by speakers of the language, many of them campers from later years.

It is also found in the northern parts of the adjacent state of New South Wales, and shares many traits with architecture in other states of Australia, but is distinct and unique. The form of the typical Queenslander-style residence distinguishes Brisbane's suburbs from other capital cities. This style developed in the 1840s and is still constructed today, displaying an evolution of local style. The term is primarily applied to residential construction, although some commercial and other types of construction are identified as Queenslander. Characteristics The quintessential Queenslander is a single detached house made of timber with a corrugated iron roof located on a separate block of land. They are all high-set, single-storey dwellings with a characteristic veranda that extends around the house to varying extents but never entirely surrounds it. In later years, many have been renovated to enclose part or all of these verandas to create extra bedrooms. The under-house area is often also enclosed to provide extra living area to these houses, which leads to the common misconception that an authentic Queenslander has two storeys. The term has evolved to apply to many different types of structures found in Queensland, such as churches. The many and varied styles all share similar features, such as prominent exterior staircases, gabled roofs, and the defining trait of being built on stumps, raising the structure from the traditional 2.8 m and varying in height depending on terrain. They are typically \\"tripartite\\" in sectional composition: underfloor (stumps), primary rooms (can be two levels), and roof. All have one or more veranda spaces, a sheltered edge of the building that is typically only partly enclosed and used as another living zone. This consideration for climate is the defining characteristic of the Queenslander type. The raising of the main living spaces off the ground can be seen as both a stylistic and practical device. The vertical \\"stumps\\", initially of timber, allow the building to \\"float\\" above the terrain. Queenslanders all have this underfloor area that is used to cool the building through ventilation and also for protection of the main structure from termite and other pest attacks. The stumps also help to overcome any variations in the terrain that would normally require earthworks to flatten for construction and allow for the natural flow of water across the terrain in the event of excessive rain and downpours.History of The Queenslander . Retrieved on 1 October 2012. The underfloor space is often high enough for additional uses such as storage, a carport, or even as extra living area in the cool, dark spaces beneath the building. The underfloor area was sometimes decoratively screened at the perimeter with timber battens. Another advantage of being constructed on stumps is that the buildings are highly adaptive. Raising, lowering, reorienting, or completely relocating Queenslanders is relatively easy. The main living areas of the house, being raised from the terrain, are a series of rooms on a platform floor. Traditionally, planning and fenestration encouraged cross-ventilation for passive cooling in a variety of innovative methods, including fanlights, ceiling roses, and alignment of doors and windows to allow uninterrupted air flow. The veranda is the most typical inclusion in the plan, and can be used day and night as a semiexternal living space. In Brisbane, many people have tables and chairs for dining and a daybed or sleepout on their verandas. Whirly birds placed on roofs allow for hot air to be drawn out of ceiling spaces. The roof is a large and visible presence externally, and was traditionally steeply pitched. They are of varied materials, including slate and tiles, but are most characteristically sheeted with corrugated steel. The steel roofs could withstand torrential rains and be reused if damaged by cyclonic winds. Typically, the Queenslander is suited to the subtropical climate of Queensland of high rainfall and mild to hot, humid climate with average summer temperatures in the range of 23‚Äì36¬∞C (73‚Äì97¬∞F). However, the type is found across the state in both colder and hotter locations, usually with adaptations to suit. History Owing to their simplicity of construction, standardised designs were produced through the 1920s and 1930s. Despite these advantages, tastes changed and the style fell out of favour after the Second World War. The need for cheaper homes first had large verandas reduced to small landings. Subsequently, internal walls were no longer made of timber and were made of fibreboards, such as asbestos sheeting or fibre/gypsum panels. Additionally, after the war, surplus military earthmoving equipment became common and preparing sites for construction was then possible and the relative cheapness of construction on stumps diminished. Land availability decreased and preferences moved towards lower-maintenance types of housing. These factors led to the adoption in Queensland, as elsewhere, of the ubiquitous \\"modern\\" American style, usually a single level and usually sold as a combined land and home package. These newer homes are usually made with a timber or metal frame, but with a brick veneer. Style The Queenslander, a \\"type\\" rather than a \\"style\\", is defined primarily by architectural characteristics of climate-consideration. They have been constructed in the popular styles of the time, including Colonial, Victorian, Federation, Arts and Crafts/Art Nouveau, Interwar styles, and post-World War II styles. The Queenslander is popularly thought of as an \\"old\\" house, although Queenslanders are constructed today using modern styles, as well as \\"reproductions\\" of previous styles. =Ashgrovian= St Johns Wood, Ashgrove 1937 Ashgrovian is the term coined for a variation of the Queenslander built between the late 1920s and World War II in the suburb of Ashgrove in Brisbane. The term Ashgrovian was coined from the prolific number of these dwellings constructed in the interwar period and was an adaptation of the Bungalow style which was popular in the early parts of the 20th century. Extremely popular with middle-income earners, these dwellings were almost always fronted with a grand gable roof, often surrounded by secondary smaller gables behind. The smaller gables usually sheltered verandas and sleepouts. A staircase almost always dominated the front yard leading to the veranda, which in later years was commonly filled in to form extra rooms. Other late additions included projecting bay or box-seat windows usually centrally located in the front of the house. =Current= Many old Queenslander buildings, both residential and commercial, have been demolished to make way for more modern buildings, particularly in the inner urban area of Brisbane, contributing to Brisbane's gentrification. However, community awareness of urban heritage has had local governments implement conservation measures to protect the unique 'tin and timber' character of neighbourhoods and towns dominated by Queenslander architecture. While master-planned housing estates are indistinguishable from those in other states, many custom-built homes are designed in a more modern version of the Queenslander style, particularly holiday houses in coastal areas. Many Queenslander-style homes are being removed/relocated to save them from demolition when the land is being developed. =Highrise= Certain elements of Queenslander house architecture can be found in some highrise buildings. Early highrise buildings had narrow balconies that were mostly used for cleaning the outside of windows. In Queensland, highrise balconies gradually evolved to become wide outdoor living spaces of the quality of verandas and the back decks of Queenslander houses and other old houses. Stump caps Stump-capping ceremony during the construction of the Bald Knob Public Hall, 1924 As white ant (termites) pose a serious problem in Queensland to timber dwellings, Queenslander buildings have stump caps (also known as ant caps). These are metal plates placed on top of each stump shaped to make it difficult for white ants to reach the main part of the building. However, accumulations of dirt or ants' nests can enable the caps to be traversed by the white ants, so regular inspections are needed to ensure the stump caps are in good condition and for early detection of white ant entry to the main structure. Not being built of stone or brick, Queenslander architecture cannot have a foundation stone. However, the desire for the traditional ceremony of laying a foundation stone, particularly for churches and other community buildings, evolved a new tradition in Queenslander buildings of a stump- capping ceremony, where an ant cap was ceremonially affixed to one or more stumps. Since an ant cap cannot have a commemorative message (unlike a foundation stone), sometimes a plaque or other method of commemoration was subsequently added to the building to record the occasion for posterity, but mostly such stump-capping ceremonies left no permanent commemoration.

The discovery of the photoacoustic effect dates to 1880 when Alexander Graham Bell showed that thin discs emitted sound when exposed to a beam of sunlight that was rapidly interrupted with a rotating slotted disk. The absorbed energy from the light causes local heating, generating a thermal expansion which creates a pressure wave or sound. Later Bell showed that materials exposed to the non-visible portions of the solar spectrum (i.e., the infrared and the ultraviolet) can also produce sounds. A photoacoustic spectrum of a sample can be recorded by measuring the sound at different wavelengths of the light. This spectrum can be used to identify the absorbing components of the sample. The photoacoustic effect can be used to study solids, liquids and gases.David W. Ball Photoacoustic Spectroscopy Spectroscopy, Volume 21, Issue 9, Sep 1, 2006 Uses and techniques Exemplary assembly of a photoacoustic spectroscope for gas analysis Photoacoustic spectroscopy has become a powerful technique to study concentrations of gases at the part per billion or even part per trillion levels. Modern photoacoustic detectors still rely on the same principles as Bell's apparatus; however, to increase the sensitivity, several modifications have been made. Instead of sunlight, intense lasers are used to illuminate the sample since the intensity of the generated sound is proportional to the light intensity; this technique is referred to as laser photoacoustic spectroscopy (LPAS). The ear has been replaced by sensitive microphones. The microphone signals are further amplified and detected using lock-in amplifiers. By enclosing the gaseous sample in a cylindrical chamber, the sound signal is amplified by tuning the modulation frequency to an acoustic resonance of the sample cell. By using cantilever enhanced photoacoustic spectroscopy sensitivity can still be further improved enabling reliable monitoring of gases on ppb-level. Example The following example illustrates the potential of the photoacoustic technique: In the early 1970s, Patel and co- workers C.K.N. Patel, E.G. Burkhardt, C.A. Lambert, ‚ÄòSpectroscopic Measurements of Stratospheric Nitric Oxide and Water Vapor‚Äô, Science, 184, 1173‚Äì1176 (1974) measured the temporal variation of the concentration of nitric oxide in the stratosphere at an altitude of 28 km with a balloon-borne photoacoustic detector. These measurements provided crucial data bearing on the problem of ozone depletion by man-made nitric oxide emission. Some of the early work relied on development of the RG theory by Rosencwaig and Gersho.A. Rosencwaig, 'Theoretical aspects of photoacoustic Spectroscopy', Journal of Applied Physics, 49, 2905-2910 (1978)A. Rosencwaig,A. Gersho 'Theory of photoacoustic effect with solids', Journal of Applied Physics, 47, 64-69 (1976) Applications of photoacoustic spectroscopy One of the important capabilities of using FTIR photoacoustic spectroscopy has been the ability to evaluate samples in their in situ state by infrared spectroscopy, which can be used to detect and quantify chemical functional groups and thus chemical substances. This is particularly useful for biological samples that can be evaluated without crushing to powder or subjecting to chemical treatments. Seashells, bone and such samples have been investigated.D.

Katti Microstructural and Photoacoustic Infrared Spectroscopic Studies of Human Cortical Bone with Osteogenesis Imperfecta', Journal of Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, 68, 1116-1127, (2016) While most academic research has concentrated on high resolution instruments, some work has gone in the opposite direction. In the last twenty years, very low cost instruments for applications such as leakage detection and for the control of carbon dioxide concentration have been developed and commercialized. Typically, low cost thermal sources are used which are modulated electronically. Diffusion through semi-permeable disks instead of valves for gas exchange, low-cost microphones, and proprietary signal processing with digital signal processors have brought down the costs of these systems. The future of low-cost applications of photoacoustic spectroscopy may be the realization of fully integrated micromachined photoacoustic instruments. The photoacoustic approach has been utilized to quantitatively measure macromolecules, such as proteins. The photoacoustic immunoassay labels and detects target proteins using nanoparticles that can generate strong acoustic signals. The photoacoustics-based protein analysis has also been applied for point-of-care testings. Photoacoustic spectroscopy also has many military applications. One such application is the detection toxic chemical agents. The sensitivity of photoacoustic spectroscopy makes it an ideal analysis technique for detecting trace chemicals associated with chemical attacks. LPAS sensors may be applied in industry, security (nerve agent and explosives detection), and medicine (breath analysis). References Further reading * Sigrist, M. W.

Skoropadsky became a conservative leader in Ukraine following the Russian Revolution of 1917, a founder of a hetman dynasty and Hetman of Ukraine. Origin Pavlo Skoropadskyi was born into the Skoropadsky family of Ukrainian military leaders and statesmen, that distinguished themselves since the 17th century when Fedir Skoropadsky participated in the Battle of Zhovti Vody. Skoropadskyi's father Petro Ivanovych Skoropadsky (1834‚Äì1885) was a Cavalry Guard Colonel and a veteran of the Caucasian War (Subjugation of Circassia, 1863). Afterwards he served as a speaker (marshal) for the Starodub County Council (zemstvo) (1869‚Äì1885) until his death. Skoropadskyi's aunt Countess Yelyzaveta Myloradovych (n√©e Skoropadska) (1832‚Äì1890) was a Ukrainian public activist. She was one of the main sponsors for foundation first Ukrainian scientific institution Shevchenko Scientific Society in Lviv. Her husband was Count Lev Myloradovych whose mother was from the Kochubey family. His grandfather Ivan (1804‚Äì1887) also served as a speaker for the Pryluky County (1844‚Äì1847) and Poltava Governorate (1847‚Äì1852) councils. He also was known for building the Trostyanets Arboretum (today in Chernihiv oblast). Skoropadskyi's father Petro Ivanovych was also a descendant of the Tarnovsky family, while Skoropadskyi's mother was a descendant of Miklashewsky and Olsufiev families. Skoropadskyi grew up at his father's estate in Trostianets, Pryluky County, Poltava Governorate. He attended a gymnasium in Starodub and later graduated from the Page Corps cadet school in Saint Petersburg. Military career =First assignments and Russo-Japan War= In 1893 Skoropadsky graduated from the Page Corps and was assigned as a cornet (meaning the 2LT in cavalry) to the Chevalier Guard regiment where he was put in charge of a squadron. After two years he was assigned a duty of the Regimental adjutant in the same regiment. In December 1897 he was promoted to Poruchik (1LT). In 1897 Skoropadsky also married Aleksandra Petrovna Durnovo, a daughter of Pyotr Pavlovich Durnovo, the General Governor of Moscow (see Durnovo). Skoropadsky's first major assignment was a sotnia (company) commander in the 2nd Chita Cossack Regiment of the Trans-Baikal Cossack Host in Chita during the Russo-Japanese War. Later he became an adjutant to the commander of the Russian forces on the Far East General Nikolay Linevich. During the war Skoropadsky was awarded the George's Weapon and several orders. In December 1905 Tsar Nikolai II made him a Fliegel-Adjutant in a rank of Colonel. On Colonel Skoropadsky was commissioned as the commander of the 20th Finnish Dragoon Regiment still continuing to be a Fliegel-Adjutant of the H. I. M. Retinue. On he was reassigned to the Leib-Guard Cavalry Regiment. Leib- Guards were the elite Russian military forces assigned for a personal protection of the emperor. On Skoropadsky was promoted to the Major General of the H. I. M. Retinue. =World War I= At the start of World War I, Skoropadsky was put in charge of the reorganized 1st Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Guard Division (General Nikolai Kaznakov) as part of the 1st Army commanded by General Paul von Rennenkampf. Skoropadsky already worked for von Rennenkampf during the Russo-Japanese War when the last was commanding Trans- Baikal Cossack Host. On August 6, 1914, his regiment distinguished itself in battles near Kraupishken as part of the Russian invasion of East Prussia. Later he was appointed as a commander of the United Cavalry Guard Division which distinguished near Kaushen. General Skoropadsky also commanded the 5th Cavalry Division. On April 2, 1916, he was promoted to Lieutenant General and was commissioned the 1st Cavalry Guard Division. From January 22 to July 2, 1917, he is in charge of the 34th Army Corps. In July 1917 the decommissioned 34th Army Corps was transformed into the 1st Ukrainian Corps. In October 1917 at the first Congress of the Free Cossacks he was awarded a title of the honorary Otaman. From October to November 1917 his 60,000-man Army Corps successfully defended the railway corridor stretching through Podolie to Polissya, Vapniarka ‚Äì Zhmerynka ‚Äì Koziatyn ‚Äì Shepetivka and defended against the attacks from the Romanian front particularly the 2nd Guard Corps that was headed by Yevgenia Bosch. Political life Cathedral of the St. Sophia, Kyiv. On 29 April 1918, a coup d'etat toppled the Ukrainian People's Republic and Skoropadsky became Hetman of Ukraine. The same day he was chrismated by bishop Nykodym in Saint Sophia Cathedral as the Hetman of Ukraine. The coup d'√©tat had been sanctioned by the Imperial German Army, which in the spring of 1918 had occupied Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine. The Ukrainian Republic was intent upon repelling an invasion by the Bolshevik Red Army. In return, the Republican government pledged food stocks, which were to be expropriated from the peasants. The German General Staff was dissatisfied with the inefficiency and incompetence of the Republican government, which repeatedly failed to deliver the supplies on time. Skoropadsky was accused by other Ukrainian nationalists of being a German collaborator supported by wealthy landowners. He was also considered too pro-Russian and dictatorial. Among other things, Skoropadsky formed a cabinet of mainly Russian speakers, Tsarists, and Slavophiles. Simultaneously, he committed Ukraine to federation with a restored Russian Empire. Despite these criticisms, by contrast with the earlier socialist Rada, his government was given credit for having created an effective administrative organization, established diplomatic ties with many countries, concluded a peace treaty with Soviet Russia, and built many schools and universities, including the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. In November 1918 Skoropadsky was removed from power in an uprising led by the social democrat Symon Petliura and the withdrawal of German forces from Kyiv. The uprising nominally restored the Ukrainian People's Republic, but power was vested in a Directoria, a provisional government of five directors chaired by Volodymyr Vynnychenko. Skoropadsky abdicated on December 14, 1918 and fled to Berlin. Pavlo Skoropadsky (right center) While living in Weimar Germany, Skoropadsky maintained close personal friendships with senior government and army officials originating as far back as his military-college days. In later years, however, he consistently refused offers to collaborate with the Nazis. During World War II, Skoropadsky fled from advancing Soviet forces with the retreating German army. He died at Metten Abbey in Germany after being wounded by an Allied bombing near Regensburg, and was buried in Oberstdorf. His movement continued into the early 1980s, influencing a Ukrainian monarchist program based on the Cossack State model. It ended gradually with the aging of eastern-Ukrainian √©migr√© communities. Skoropadsky's daughter, Olena Skoropadska-Ott (died 2014), resided in Switzerland, visited Ukraine several times, and had been honored for her historical writings.

Life \\"Demetrius II goes to the Khan\\", by Henryk Hryniewski. Son of King David VII and his wife Gvantsa, Demetrius was only 2 years old when his mother was killed by the Mongols in 1261. He succeeded on his father's death in 1270, when he was 11 years old. He ruled under the regency of Sadun Mankaberdeli for some time. In 1277‚Äì1281, he took part in Abaqa Khan's campaigns against Egypt and in particularly distinguished himself at the Second Battle of Homs, (29 October 1281). Although he continued to be titled \\"king of Georgians and Abkhazians, etc\\", Demetrius's rule extended only over the eastern part of the kingdom. Western Georgia was under the rule of the Imeretian branch of the Bagrationi dynasty. King Demetrius was considered quite a controversial person. Devoted to Christianity, he was criticized for his polygamy. In 1288, on the order of Arghun Khan, he subdued the rebel province of Derbend at the Caspian Sea.

Timur felt that none of his sons were capable of ruling so he named Pir Muhammad as his successor. Pir Muhammad had been Governor of Kandahar since 1392. His territory extended from the lands west of the Hindu Kush to the Indus River. In the fall of 1397 he led the first wave of Timurids into India, and was invested with the rulership of Multan. However, none of Pir Muhammad's relatives supported him following Timur's death. He was unable to assume command in Samarkand. He went into battle twice against Khalil Sultan a cousin and the other claimant to the throne but was defeated. He was allowed to remain in his lands.

He appears in the Hervarar saga, and probably also in Widsith,line 115, as Heathoric together with his sons Angantyr (Incgentheow) and Hl√∂√∞ (Hlith), and Hl√∂√∞'s mother Sifka (Sifeca). The etymology is hei√∞r, meaning \\"honour\\", and rekr, meaning \\"ruler, king\\". Youth Heidrek was the son of king H√∂fund and his wife Hervor, a shieldmaiden. Like his mother in her youth, he was ill-natured and violent. To amend this, he was raised by the wise Geatish king Gizur, but this did not improve his disposition. One day, when his parents were having a banquet, Heidrek arrived uninvited and late at night, he started a quarrel which ended in manslaughter. His father, King H√∂fund, banished Heidrek from his kingdom, although Hervor did her utmost to soften H√∂fund's feelings against his son. His father's advice However, before Heidrek left, his father gave him some words of advice: :\\"Never help a man who has betrayed his master. :Never give peace to a man who has murdered his friend. :Don't allow your wife to visit her family frequently, even though she insists on doing so. :Never tell your loved one about your secret thoughts. :If you're in a hurry, never ride your best horse. :Never punish the son of a better man. :Never break a promise about peace. :Never have many thralls in your company.\\" Heidrek immediately decided never to follow his father's advice. Departing Hervor secretly gave her son the sword Tyrfing as she bade him farewell, and his brother Angantyr kept him company for a while. When they had walked for some time, Heidrek wanted to have a look at the sword. Since he had unsheathed it, the curse the dwarves had put on the sword made him kill his brother. Adventures After a while, Heidrek met a patrol moving a prisoner who was to be executed because he had murdered his master. He remembered his father's advice and resolved to buy the criminal. Then he continued his journey and met a patrol moving a scoundrel who had killed his comrade. Likewise, Heidrek bought the man's life in order to disobey his father. Soon, Heidrek arrived in Reidgotaland, entered the Gothic king Harald's service, and disposed of two rebellious jarls for him. This earned him half the Gothic kingdom and the king's daughter, Helga. Heidrek and Helga had a son who was named Angantyr after Heidrek's brother and grandfather. During the same time old King Harald had a son who was named Halfdan. Unfortunately, Reidgotaland was struck with bad crops and starvation. The go√∞ar (heathen priests) determined that they must sacrifice the most noble young man of the kingdom to Odin in order to restore good crops. Immediately, people started to quarrel about which of the princes was the most noble, and so they asked king H√∂fund of Gl√¶sisvellir. King H√∂fund decided that it was Angantyr (his own grandson) who was the most noble prince. H√∂fund also told Heidrek to ask King Harald that in recompense for sacrificing his own son, he should receive half the Gothic army as his own. King Harald agreed to this. However, when H√∂fund called for a thing in order to sacrifice Angantyr, Heidrek objected and said that Odin would be happy if instead of Angantyr, he received King Harald and his son Halfdan. Then, Heidrek made a coup d'√©tat with his half of the Gothic army, using Tyrfing to kill King Harald and his son. When his wife Helga heard the news, she committed suicide by hanging herself. King of the Goths Heidrek used his army to subjugate the Gothic kingdom and ruled with brutal force. He defeated Humli, the king of the Huns, and captured his daughter Sifka, whom he raped. When she became pregnant, she was sent back to her father's kingdom, where she bore a son who was named Hl√∂d. Heidrek married Olof, the daughter of √Öke, the King of the Saxons. She often asked to go home to visit her family, and since Heidrek remembered his father's advice, he always gladly consented. This would turn out to be an unwise strategy, because one day he made the journey to Saxony in order to see his wife among her family. He found her in the arms of a blond thrall and immediately divorced her. Instead, he married a girl from Finland who was named Sifka, like the Hunnic princess. One day, they were visiting king Rollaug of Gardariki. To oppose a fourth word of advice given by his father, he told Sifka a secret and asked her to swear an oath never to tell anyone. The secret was that he had accidentally killed King Rollaug's son in a hunting accident. Naturally, Sifka immediately ran to King Rollaug and told him the secret, which caused King Rollaug to capture Heidrek and to kill all of his retinue. The two men who bound him were none other than the two culprits he had saved from the gallows. When king Rollaug was about to burn Heidrek alive, someone broke the news that the prince was still alive and that Heidrek was innocent. Rollaug apologized and in recompense for Heidrek's losses he gave him his own daughter, Hergerd. Heidrek and Hergerd had a daughter who was named Hervor, the shieldmaiden, after her grandmother who had just died. This was the beginning of a time of peace for Heidrek. During a voyage, Heidrek camped at the Carpathians (Harva√∞a fj√∂llum, cf. Grimm's law). He was accompanied by eight mounted thralls, and while Heidrek slept, the thralls broke into his tent, took Tyrfing and slew Heidrek. This was the last one of Tyrfing's three evil deeds. Heidrek's son Angantyr caught the thralls, killed them and reclaimed the magic sword, but the curse had ceased. References Sources Henrikson, Alf (1998). Stora mytologiska uppslagsboken.

Biography Sui was born in Qingdao, China in 1956.Link text, additional text. Both of his parents were factory workers and were largely absent during his early childhood due to the workload imposed on them by the Mao government.Link text , additional text. Growing up, Sui witnessed the harsh realities of the Mao years. During this time Maoist socialist realism became the approved art style. This style generally portrayed Maoist ideals in a romantic positive light. These images were used to create a cult of personality for Mao. At the age of ten, schools were closed as part of the Cultural Revolution, and Sui began to work in the factories with his parents. In an interview he stated that he was ‚Äútransfixed in the age of Mao worship, when Mao was virtually a God at home‚Äù. Painting was not a career option for Sui until the age of eighteen when he broke his arm, which took him away from factory work. According to Sui, during this period he contemplated his ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù life and what he wanted to do with his future. Soon after, and with the permission and guidance of his father, he began studying painting at night under the cover of darkness. Upon his return to the factory Sui painted propaganda posters of Mao in the socialist realist fashion. His studies and practice gave fruit to his first true work: a traditional Chinese landscape painting, which he completed in 1976 after the death of Mao. After his death, the Chinese government loosened its grip on the population, and educational reforms were quick to follow. Sui took advantage of the new freedoms, and moved to Jinan and then Shandong, where he received his major in sculpture. A few years later he earned his master's degree in Arts at the central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. According to Sui, by the time he had enrolled in college, he had decided he wanted to do sculpture, inspired by his years in the factories, where people would tell him he had ‚Äúskill in using his hands‚Äù. After gaining his master's degree, Sui travelled to the Netherlands, Australia, Japan, and other places to display his art. He also worked as a guest professor or speaker at several universities outside of China. Finally, Sui returned to become chairman of the department of sculpture at the Central Academy of Fine Arts. Sui became internationally prominent through the use of ‚Äúnaturalistic sculptures‚Äù that made use of rocks, boulders, and steel. These early sculptures brought him into the international scene. His true acclaim came in 1997 when he crafted his first Mao suit, a sculpture that imitated Chairman Mao's communist jacket. His jackets interested famous collectors such as Uli Sigg, and helped him gain international recognition. Art Sui has been an active artist on the stage of modern and contemporary art in China. He has had numerous solo and joint exhibitions in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, India, Taiwan, and most recently in the United States, in addition to his active schedules in China, and several high-profile exhibitions worldwide. He likes to work with hard and heavy materials such as granite and metals. His techniques of sealing, binding, tying and hammering created a relationship of association and confrontation between his materials, which resonate with his perception of life and his internal conflicts. Among his known works in the early 1990s are Land Depression, in which he entwines huge boulders in nets made from steel ropes, and Sealed Memory, a closely welded cabinet of thick steel sheets, which gives an oppressive sense of weight and blockage. Memory is a wall made out of old railroad ties. The ties have been ground down just as humans are ground down by life, and they become part of a dividing wall, a boundary. Many of Sui's early works reflect his personal experiences and explore, to a lesser or greater extent, and his anxieties and feelings of imprisonment. He began his Mao Suit series in 1997. This series can be regarded as the conclusion of an important stage in his self-exploration. He draws on the powerful image of the Mao suit, not as an element of revolutionary attire but as a symbol of restriction and limitation. Sui suggests that none of the Chinese have truly taken off their Mao suits even though the revolutionary era is over. Sometimes Sui makes the Mao suits resemble Buddhas and at other times he turns them into hard shells. Recently, Sui has made fairly humorous, soft and almost transparent Mao suits. The Mao suit is perhaps coming to represent to the artist an object of fun. In a more recent work, the red dinosaur, a symbol of imperialist China, like communist China, with the engraved door on the chest mentions \\"Made in China\\". This is a glance toward plastic toys from the start of the Chinese economic flight, and a symbol of an antiquated China moving toward being contemporary. Throughout the 1960s, it seemed that everything was \\"made in Japan\\", in the 1970s \\"made in Taiwan\\", and in the 1980s \\"made in China\\". The fabrication of finished products based on models and imported raw materials has become the economic norm of emerging countries. Over all, Sui's work has well represented the views and expressions of his generation, the generation that survived Mao's Cultural Revolution. More importantly, as one of the most active and most productive artists in China today, and as the head of the department in the most prestigious art institute in China, he has brought fundamental changes to the contemporary art movement in recent China. Because of his influential works and through his educational efforts, abstract and conceptual sculpture have been well accepted by the ordinary Chinese people and by the authorities. Furthermore, he has taken the role of bringing the contemporary art of modern China to the world. His works have been well recognized by the Western art world. Famous works While Sui Jianguo is a prolific artist, certain of his works have stood out. Not only have these allowed Sui to become a prominent contemporary Chinese artist, but they also grant viewers an insight into his mind and opinions. =Earth Force= Earth Force was one of Sui's earlier works and came to his mind in 1987. The inspiration came when he was experimenting with conceptual and symbolic aspects of materials and mediums. His need to experiment with rocks came after Tiananmen Square; it was during this stage that Sui began working with more quiet materials. Earth Force consists of twenty 100 kg boulders. Each boulder is entangled in a web of ribbed steel. The final work was presented in Beijing in 1992. =Mao Jackets= Sui Jianguo's Mao Jackets are perhaps his most iconic work. Sui began thinking of the Mao Suit or Sun Yat Sen suit when he visited the birthplace of Sun Yat Sen in August 1996. A finished product finally emerged a year later when Sui was in Australia for a fellowship. A ‚Äúscholarly discussion‚Äù is credited with yielding the first outlines or frame of the suit. While there are several representations of these jackets, most of them are a hollow sculpture of a Mao suit. Sue Wang states that ‚Äúutilizing various forms and sizes to simultaneously release the excitement and inhibition associated with this object, the artist used a satirical approach to express the conflict between escape and repression‚Äù. The Mao suit itself is representative of Sui's strong ties with China's Maoist past. During the Cultural Revolution Sui and many other Chinese were influenced by Mao's cult of personality. Sui goes into further detail, stating ‚ÄúMao was virtually a God at home‚Äù. The empty, hollow suits are seen by some as symbols of Mao's empty promises. Sui stresses that the suits are not much as a criticism but more of a medium to convey his ideas and emotions about his Maoist past. Upon completion of this project Sui felt like he had reached a certain type of resolution. Sui claimed, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm putting him to rest. This way I can grow up‚Äù. =Red Dinosaurs= Sui's Red Dinosaurs or Jurassic Age series have also become a trademark of his work. These dinosaurs focus more on China's recent exporting nature, allowing Sui to evaluate the contemporary Chinese export culture. According to 798 ART district, the ‚ÄúMade in China‚Äù stamped on several of the dinosaurs' midsection ‚Äúrelates directly to some topics on economical relations‚Äù. Sui intends to cause the audience to consider who is making a product, where it is going, and why. Sui sometimes cages the dinosaurs. When asked about this, Sui stated that he was suggesting that China's economic expanse \\"in some ways is not good for China, for the environment and human life... I don't want him to continue getting bigger\\". The dinosaurs are usually made out of fiberglass and can stand up to 310 cm tall. =Made in China= Sui's Made in China series revolves around China's new identity as a world producing power. The works are usually banners stating \\"Made in China\\". =Limited Motion= Some of Sui's most recent work has been on the Limited Motion series. Limited Motion was created in order to express the feelings of ‚Äúimprisonment‚Äù felt by Sui Jianguo. The series of works made its debut in 2011 and was shown in the Museum Beelden aan Zee in The Hague. For this series Sui creates steel structures that house steel spheres. These spheres are able to move due to an internal motor. As seen with previous works, the works in this series vary in size as well as shape. For example, one of the Limited Motions is housed in a cage, and another is housed in a box. In the grander scope of the work, however, certain crucial details manifest themselves in the project that allow the artist to fully share his feelings and intentions via the artwork. The first of these details is the solid unrelenting structures themselves. Their harsh exterior perhaps refers to the oppressive stance the Chinese government has on censorship. The exterior shells are weathered, perhaps indicating the attempts made upon the structure to weaken it or tear it down, yet we still see it standing in place.

Sometimes known as the dusky-backed shearwater,Carboneras (1992) the specific epithet honours the French naturalist F√©lix Louis L'Herminier. Certain populations are known variously as Baillon's shearwater, tropical shearwater, Bannerman's shearwater, Mascarene shearwater and Persian shearwater; some of these are considered distinct species by various authors. If they are all placed in P. lherminieri, the North Atlantic little shearwater (otherwise often separated as P. baroli) is generally included here too. Thus, these small shearwaters form a cryptic species complex. Description Illustration by Chester A. Reed Audubon's shearwaters are on average in length‚Äîabout half the size of the greater shearwater (Puffinus gravis)‚Äîand weigh 170 g. There is some variation between populations, and the normal size and weight range is and . The wingspan is , the tail is around long, the exposed culmen measures or slightly less, and the tarsus is around in length.Efe & Musso (2001) In general appearance, it is a small shearwater, black above and white below and hard to distinguish from its relatives at first glance. The upperparts, rectrices and undertail coverts are blackish- brown, as are at least the distal undersides of the remiges, but sometimes the entire feathers. The rest of the underparts are white, as is the head below eye level. The iris is dark, the feet are dull pink with a black wash and black toenails, and the bill is grey, darker towards the tip, and with a pinkish hue. Males and females look alike. Immature birds do not have a distinct plumage, while the nestlings are covered with down feathers, grey above and whitish on the belly. It can be confused with the Manx shearwater (P. puffinus), which has white undertail coverts and in direct comparison a longer bill. Other similar-looking species are usually completely allopatric, though the largely subantarctic little shearwater (P. assimilis) may occasionally range into waters where P. lherminieri is normally found. It has more white on the face and underwing, a smaller bill and greyish-blue feet. Its twittering calls and mewing are often only heard at night in the breeding colonies. Range and ecology If not split into several species, Audubon's shearwater ranges across the Indian Ocean north to the Arabian Sea, throughout the north-west and central Pacific, in the Caribbean, and parts of the eastern Atlantic. It is a species of tropical waters; only some Atlantic populations and Bannerman's shearwater of the Ogasawara Islands occur farther north. Unlike the larger shearwaters, adult Audubon's shearwaters are not thought to wander much or undertake great migrations, although their young birds do so before breeding, and western Indian Ocean birds may gather in large numbers at the upwelling zone in the Arabian Sea. It is adaptable as regards its preferred marine habitat; it can be found in pelagic, offshore and inshore waters. It feeds in a variety of methods, mainly diving out of flight, plunging underwater from a swimming position, and picking up food less than a bill's length underwater while \\"pattering\\" as if it were walking across the waves. It eats small fish, squid and planktonic crustaceans. Unlike other shearwaters, it is not commonly a ship-follower, though it may attend small fishing boats; it is also sometimes met with as part of a mixed-species feeding flock. P. l. lherminieri chick in nest burrow on Little Tobago. The species is colonial, nesting in small burrows and crevices in rocks and on earthy slopes on atolls and rocky islets. The breeding season varies according to location and subspecies, but how precisely is not very well-studied.The colony found off southern Brazil in 1993 was recorded to incubate in August; the young had left the nests in December (Efe & Musso, 2001). Both parents share the responsibility of incubating the single white egg (measurements of 52.5 by 36.2 mm and a weight of 37 g have been recorded for one specimen of average size), each incubating for periods of 2 to 10 days until the egg hatches after 49‚Äì51 days of incubation. The nestlings are brooded for half a week to one week, after which time the parents will leave it mostly alone in the burrow and spend most of their time foraging and feeding their voracious offspring, which become very fat. Time from hatching to fledging is 62‚Äì75 days. Audubon's shearwaters take about 8 years to reach breeding age. As typical for Procellariiformes they are long-lived for their size, one bird ringed as an adult was still alive 11 years later; it must have been more than 15 years old at that time. While some small populations are threatened, the species as a whole (in the present sense, i.e. unsplit) is not considered to be globally threatened.BLI (2008) Systematics Audubon's shearwater belongs to the Puffinus sensu stricto group of mid-sized and small shearwaters, which is related to the genus Calonectris. The taxonomy of this species is extremely confusing. It is occasionally listed as a subspecies of P. assimilis (the little shearwater), but they do not appear to be that closely related. Rather, P. lherminieri seems to belong to an ill-resolved clade also including such species as the little shearwater, the Manx shearwater (P. puffinus) or the black-vented shearwater (P. opisthomelas).Austin (1996), Heidrich et al. (1998), Austin et al. (2001). But see Penhallurick & Wink (2004) for an alternate view placing it closest to P. assimilis, and Rheindt & Austin (2005) for a critique of that analysis. Note that the four conflicting studies are all based on mtDNA cytochrome b sequences. The little-known Heinroth's shearwater (P. heinrothi) is sometimes considered a subspecies of either Audubon's or the little shearwater. Though it is likely to be another member of that close-knit group, its actual relationships remain uncertain due to lack of specimens. Audubon's shearwater itself has around 10 subspecies. Several have at one time or another been suggested to constitute separate species. For example, the Gal√°pagos Islands population has turned out to be a very distinct species, the Gal√°pagos shearwater (P. subalaris); it is apparently related to the Christmas shearwater (P. nativitatis) and together with it constitutes an ancient lineage without other close relatives in the genus.Austin et al. (2004) Other taxa were initially assigned to the little shearwater and later moved to Audubon's. Analysis of mtDNA cytochrome b sequence dataAustin (1996), Austin et al. (2004) - which is of somewhat limited value in procellariiform birds howeverRheindt & Austin (2005) - indicates that at least three major clades can be distinguished: = The lherminieri clade (Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean)= * Puffinus lherminieri lherminieri Lesson, 1839 - breeds throughout the Caribbean, on the Bahamas and formerly on Bermuda; ranges throughout the Caribbean and up the North American Atlantic coast up to southern Canada, with vagrants having been recorded off north-eastern Canada. A small breeding colony found in 1993 in the Itatiaia Islands off Vila Velha (Esp√≠rito Santo, Brazil) probably belongs to this subspecies. Includes loyemilleri. *Barolo shearwater, P. baroli (Bonaparte, 1857) - breeds on the Azores and Canary Islands (east Atlantic); ranges throughout east Atlantic around (but mostly north of) the Tropic of Cancer. *Boyd's shearwater, Puffinus boydi Mathews, 1912 - breeds on the Cape Verde Islands (east Atlantic); ranges throughout the east Atlantic around (but mostly south of) the Tropic of Cancer. The former two have more white on the face and bluish feet like the little shearwater, with which they were formerly placedAustin (1996), Heidrich et al. (1998) Many taxonomists consider both Boyd's and Barolo shearwaters distinct species, depending on whether biogeography and morphological differences or the genetic similarity are considered more significant, and what other lineages are considered distinct from P. lherminieri in a particular treatment. The southern Caribbean birds were separated as P. l. loyemilleri, but are not distinct. = The persicus clade (West Indian Ocean)= Puffinus lherminieri persicus * Puffinus lherminieri persicus Hume, 1837 - breeds on Khuriya Muriya Islands (Arabian Sea); ranges throughout the Arabian Sea. * Puffinus lherminieri temptator Louette & Herremans, 1985 - breeds on Moh√©li (Comoros); ranges in W Indian Ocean around the northern end of Madagascar. These form another distinct clade as indicated by mtDNA sequences, and have for some time been proposed as a distinct species, Persian shearwater (P. persicus). From the molecular data alone, this seems fairly warranted, but the ranges of the two taxa are quite far apart, separated by forms of the third clade. It is quite obvious that on the basis of such contradicting data as presently available, no decision can be taken regarding the taxonomic status of these birds. Possibly, they do form a distinct species separated from the third clade by a different circannual rhythm, as is known from other procellariiform birds. They are phenotypically distinct, with a longer bill, a dark rump, and more extensive dark on the underwing, including some mottling in the normally white area. If P. bailloni is accepted as a distinct species but P. persicus is not, then this latter group would have to be included in P. bailloni. =The bailloni clade (Indian and Pacific oceans)= * Puffinus lherminieri bailloni (Bonaparte, 1857) - breeds on Mascarene Islands (SW Indian Ocean); ranges throughout the SW Indian Ocean to the north of the Tropic of Capricorn, and vagrant birds seen off South Africa probably belong to this subspecies. Includes atrodorsalis. * Puffinus lherminieri dichrous Finsch & Hartlaub, 1867 - breeds throughout central Polynesia and possibly Melanesia (Pacific) and the NW Indian Ocean up to the Arabian Sea; ranges throughout the W Indian Ocean around the Equator, and in the C Pacific from the equatorial region to the Tropic of Capricorn. Includes colstoni, nicolae, polynesiae and maybe gunax; vagrants seen off Australia could belong to dichrous or gunax (if valid), while vagrants recorded from Guam and Rota (Marianas) might be dichrous or bannermani.Wiles et al. (2000) This group is the most confusing of all. The subspecies dichrous occurs in two areas which appear to be separated by the whole of Indonesia and the seas surrounding it; the Pacific subpopulation includes the proposed subspecies polynesiae (Ta‚Äò≈´, American Samoa) and possibly gunax (see below), whereas the geographically separated Indian Ocean subpopulation contains the birds formerly separated as nicolae (NW Indian Ocean, from Aldabra to the Maldives) and colstoni (Aldabra, Arabian Sea). Audubon's shearwater Puffinus lherminieri bailloni of Reunion Island. There appear to be no significant genetical or morphological differences between these birds, which is quite amazing given that the Pacific and Indian Ocean subpopulations must have been isolated for a fairly long time, and that no less than three unequivocally distinct subspecies (bailloni, persicus and temptator) occur within the range of Indian Ocean dichrous. On the other hand, the supposed species Mascarene shearwater (P. atrodorsalis) is inseparable morphologically and genetically from bailloni. Clearly, some mechanism blocking gene flow is at work, but what this is exactly remains unknown - though as remarked above, separate breeding seasons seem a reasonable assumption and are tentatively supported by the available field data. In addition, it is entirely mysterious why such a mechanism should apply in the rather limited and ecologically homogeneous north-western Indian Ocean range, but not in the ecologically more diverse and by far larger Pacific range of dichrous. These unresolved problems notwithstanding, this clade - possibly including the preceding one - has been proposed to constitute a separate species, the tropical shearwater or Baillon's shearwater, Puffinus bailloni. =Undetermined= * Puffinus lherminieri bannermani Mathews & Iredale, 1915 - breeds on Ogasawara Islands (NW Pacific); ranges throughout the NW Pacific from Japanese waters to the equatorial region. Vagrants recorded from Guam and Rota (Marianas) might be dichrous or bannermani. * Puffinus lherminieri gunax Mathews, 1930 - breeds on Banks Islands of Vanuatu (SW Pacific); ranges throughout the SW Pacific between the equatorial region and the Tropic of Capricorn. Might belong in dichrous; vagrants seen off Australia could belong to either taxon. These taxa could not be included in the most recent studies due to lack of material. The case of gunax seems fairly straightforward - as certainly as this can possibly be said in the absence of new data, it belongs to the bailloni clade either as a distinct subspecies, or, more likely, as yet another synonym of dichrous. The case of the more distinct bannermani, the range of which is parapatric to that of the Pacific dichrous, is more complicated. It has for some timeE.g. Vaurie (1965) been proposed as a distinct species, Bannerman's shearwater (P. bannermani). In the absence of more recent data to investigate this claim, its status continues to be altogether unresolved, though the case for it being at least a distinct subspecies in the bailloni clade seems good.

The term derives from the plain of Campania, a place of annual wartime operations by the armies of the Roman Republic. Definition 1\\\\. A military campaign denotes the time during which a given military force conducts combat operations in a given area (often referred to as AO, area of operation). A military campaign may be executed by either a single Armed Service, or as a combined services campaign conducted by land, naval, air, cyber and space forces. 2\\\\. The purpose of a military campaign is to achieve a particular desired resolution of a military conflict as its strategic goal. This is constrained by resources, geography and/or season. A campaign is measured relative to the technology used by the belligerents to achieve goals, and while in the pre-industrial Europe was understood to be that between the planting (late spring) and harvest times (late autumn), it has been shortened during the post-industrial period to a few weeks. However, due to the nature of campaign goals, usually campaigns last several months, or up to a year as defined by Trevor N. Dupuy. > \\"A campaign is a phase of a war involving a series of operations related in > time and space and aimed towards a single, specific, strategic objective or > result in the war. A campaign may include a single battle, but more often it > comprises a number of battles over a protracted period of time or a > considerable distance, but within a single theatre of operations or > delimited area. A campaign may last only a few weeks, but usually lasts > several months or even a year\\".Dupuy, p 65. Conduct *Planning ‚Äì the General Staff defining objectives, time, scope and cost of the campaign *Executing ‚Äì the coordination of forces and resources in logistic and combat operations *Controlling ‚Äì the monitoring of the progress of the campaign when compared to its baseline plan *Concluding ‚Äì acceptance or rejection of the campaign outcomes by the directing command structure Many historical campaigns are so named as misnomers to increase or reduce the perception of operations for other than military reasons. Evaluation The success of a military campaign is evaluated based on the degree of achievement of planned goals and objectives through combat and noncombat operations. That is determined when one of the belligerent military forces defeats the opposing military force within the constraints of the planned resource, time and cost allocations. The manner in which a force terminates its operations often influences the public perception of the campaign's success. A campaign may end in conquest, and be followed by the transition of military authority to a civil authority and the redeployment of forces, or a permanent installation of a military authority in the occupied area. Military campaigns, inside and outside defined wars, may exceed the original or even revised planning parameters of scope, time and cost. Such stalled campaigns, for example the western front in World War I, were formerly called \\"stalemates\\" but in the late 20th century the metaphor of a quagmire was often applied. Such a situation may arise of various factors such as: *a small hope for victory *poorly defined objectives *no clear exit strategy See also ;General * Military operations other than war - concept that encompass the use of military capabilities across the range of military operations short of war. * Campaign desk - used by officers and their staffs in rear areas during a military campaign. * Military strategy - collective name for planning the conduct of warfare. * War cycles - the theory that wars happen in cycles. ;Military decorations * Campaign medal - a military decoration which is awarded to a member of the military who serves in a designated military operation or performs duty in a geographical theater. * Campaign clasp - an attachment to a military award consisting of a metal bar which is pinned to the upper cloth portion of an award medal. * Campaign streamer - a long streamer attached to the headpiece of a military flag, denoting participation of that military service in a particular campaign. ;Lists and examples * List of wars - contains military campaigns. * List of battles - part of larger military campaigns. * List of sieges - part of larger military campaigns.

It is a parody of the Star Wars character Jar Jar Binks from The Phantom Menace, which had been released four weeks before the episode aired, and it expresses how Parker and Stone felt \\"betrayed\\", as Star Wars fans, by how \\"stupid\\" they felt the character was. The episode originally aired on Comedy Central on June 16, 1999. In the episode, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny go camping in the woods. Cartman discovers a species that was thought to be extinct. This species is very annoying, and everyone in town, except Cartman, wants to get rid of them. Plot While the four boys are camping at Stark's Pond they hear something in the woods. They seek help from Stan's uncle Jimbo and his war buddy Ned, who has lost his electrolarynx. Using a trap they discover an unusual creature which resembles a humanoid duck which turns out to be extremely annoying to everyone in town with the exception of Cartman, who is enchanted by its antics. The town has a meeting to decide what is to be done about the creature when representatives from the Department of Interior (DOI) show up and inform the townspeople that it is a near-extinct \\"Jakovasaur\\", which they intend to use to repopulate the species. The townspeople name the creature \\"Hope\\" despite its name actually being \\"Joon- Joon\\". Another Jakovasaur, which speaks English and is named \\"Jakov\\" makes itself known by seeking out Cartman and telling him he's looking for his wife Joon-Joon. Cartman, Kyle and Stan take Jakov to his wife in the barn where she is being held, but the townspeople hear them. Meanwhile, Jimbo brings Ned another voicebox, however he buys the wrong model and Ned is now forced to speak with an Irish accent. It is decided that the Jakovasaurs are to be given their own home in the hope that they will breed. However, problems arise when it is determined that both Jakov and Joon-Joon lack any genitalia. Dr. Mephisto instead artificially inseminates Joon-Joon, and after a gestation period of only four days, Joon-Joon gives birth to an entire litter of baby Jakovasaurs. It is quickly determined that the Jakovasaurs are a major disruption to everyday life for the people of South Park. The DOI reps sent to help repopulate the Jakovasaur species decide to abandon their duties because of how annoying the Jakovasaurs are. They make Cartman an official \\"Department of Interior Person\\", telling him he has authority and people must respect it. The episode begins to outline some of the issues surrounding illegal immigration. Fed up with the Jakovasaurs, the townspeople convince them to move to Memphis where they'll fit in as all the people there are \\"big, loud, annoying, and stupid\\". When Cartman finds out about the plan, he convinces the Jakovasaurs to stay in South Park instead. The townspeople then come up with a different way to get rid of the Jakovasaurs forever by rigging a game show in which Jakov will play against Officer Barbrady so that Jakov will win a trip to France with \\"50 of his closest relatives.\\" Because Jakov is so stupid, Barbrady actually wins, but everyone wants the Jakovasaurs gone so they declare him the winner anyway. Stan, Kyle and Kenny try to distract Cartman from the game show so he does not realize it is fixed and take him to classify a \\"new antelope species\\" they found in the woods (which is actually Kenny with branches taped to his head, who eventually gets eaten by a bear that mistakes him for an antelope). Cartman realizes the trick and figures out the game is rigged, prompting him to rush to warn Jakov. Cartman is too late and he arrives at the airport just as the plane carrying Jakov and his family taxis down the runway and lifts off. The townspeople approach Cartman and tell him they learned that not every form of life is worth saving, and that it is better to let nature run its course. During this, Ned voices his input with a voice box that accurately captures his original voice (as heard in flashback during \\"The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka\\"), only for him and Jimbo to conclude that said voice box sucks. The episode ends showing the Jakovasaurs on tour in Paris, looking for the Pyramid, when Jakov trips and crashes into a cafe full of French people. Rather than getting annoyed, the French people instead laugh and remark on how he reminds them of Jerry Lewis. Production The episode was produced just weeks before the release of South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, and its production ran concurrently with the movie's post-production, a process which the show's creators described as \\"hell\\". The episode aired on June 16, 1999, the same day that Trey Parker was putting the finishing touches to the movie's sound mix. Before producing the episode, the creators had done a Jar Jar based spoof for the MTV movie awards, which MTV refused to run.  Reception  The episode has received mixed reviews from critics. Travis Pickett of IGN gave the episode a 6/10, ultimately saying the \\"Jakovasaur\\" joke goes on for too long and was dragged on.

AllMusic critic MacKenzie Wilson has called Reynolds \\"an under-rated master\\". Reynolds plays the guitar, piano, sitar, drums, violin, bass, keyboards, ethnic percussive instruments, solo djembe, harp, uses drum machines for special effects, and sings, although his performances are primarily instrumental rock music. As well as being the founding member of the band TR3, he is one of the musicians who performed at Miller's, a bar in Charlottesville, Virginia, befriending and encouraging the bartender, a young Dave Matthews, to form a band of his own, introducing him to local musicians, several of whom make up the Dave Matthews Band. While Reynolds long declined the offer to join as an official member, he recorded and toured as a sideman with the Dave Matthews Band from its inception until late 1998, joining them as a permanent member in June 2008. He often tours with Dave Matthews as an acoustic duo in addition to performing as a member of Dave Matthews & Friends.  Early years  Reynolds was born in Wiesbaden, Germany, where his father, who served in the U.S. Army, was stationed. He says he hails from nowhere, because the family moved so often. His family lived many places, including Germany, a farm in Indiana, an army base in Alaska, Kansas, and Missouri, where he lived longer than any other place until he was old enough to move away as an adult. Both parents were extremely devout Christians and he says he grew up with Christian music all around him. However, his older sister owned some albums from The Beatles, which he says, even as a very young child, he loved instantly, playing air guitar to their music. Upon reaching adolescence, Reynolds was able to learn guitar and bass guitar, so he could perform in the family's local church choir three times a week, while also beginning to experiment with learning what eventually became second nature; adding riffs infused with rock and roll, funk and soul music by the age of twelve. Upon graduation from high school, he moved away from the Midwest and landed in Charlottesville, Virginia, finding jazz, jazz fusion, and experimental music enthusiasts there. Reynolds found the college town a more welcoming environment for him to branch out musically than any of his previous homes, and added to his experimentation other musical influences to his repertoire, including sixties psychedelic rock, citing some of his early influences as Jimi Hendrix, Carlos Santana and Led Zeppelin. By the 1990s, he had formed the \\"Tim Reynolds Three\\" or TR3, and had added other influences, such as Nine Inch Nails, Bob Marley and Marilyn Manson. In addition, he continued to learn to play other instruments, including the sitar, sarod, the mandello, keytar, tubular bells and other \\"exotic\\" instruments that were not commonly seen in Western rock artists of the rock and roll musicians of the time. Musical collaborations =As a duo with Dave Matthews= Reynolds and Matthews, (2010) Reynolds was performing in Charlottesville in the late 1980s when his friend, Nic Cappon, encouraged him to perform at a local bar, Miller's, where he met bartender Dave Matthews. Reynolds explains: > I played there [Miller's in Charlottesville] all the time. Dave Matthews was > the bartender. I knew the rest of his [future] band way before that. We > played together in Charlottesville since I moved there in 1981. I would play > with LeRoi Moore and Carter Beauford. Dave moved to town in 1987. When the > Dave Matthews Band started (1991), I already had my own band (TR3). I told > him (Matthews), \\"I've got a band and I kind of like the way it is. You > should start your band.\\" I could see that he needed to do his own thing. In 1993, Reynolds and Matthews started playing a few acoustic duo sets. These featured Matthews' music, stripped down to just the acoustic guitar, paired with Reynolds' guitar and occasional use of slide guitar. During these sets, Reynolds would play between one and four of his own pieces that spanned his own catalog of work. After a few years these shows gained popularity, and in 1996 Matthews and Reynolds embarked on their first full tour together as a duo. In 1999, coinciding with the release of the 40-date tour, Live at Luther College was released. After a short break, Reynolds toured again with Matthews as a duo in 2003. Reynolds and Matthews then reprised their duo shows as an opening act for the Dave Matthews & Friends tour in 2003 and early 2004. They played several shows together in 2006 and 2007. Reynolds joined Matthews on a mini-tour of Europe in February and March 2007. On 14 August 2007, Matthews and Reynolds released a live CD/DVD set, Live at Radio City, including the songs \\"Stay or Leave\\", \\"Gravedigger\\", \\"Cornbread\\", and \\"Dancing Nancies,\\" among others. It also includes two of Reynolds' own songs; \\"You are My Sanity\\" and \\"Betrayal\\". The Radio City show was also released in high definition on Blu-ray. In 2008, Reynolds once again joined Dave Matthews Band for the recording Big Whiskey and the Groogrux King with producer Rob Cavallo. It was Reynolds's first recording collaboration with Matthews since 2003's Some Devil and his first with the Dave Matthews Band since 1998's Before These Crowded Streets. Reynolds and Matthews performed together several times in April 2008; in support of Presidential candidate Barack Obama, at the \\"Seeds of Compassion\\" show in Seattle and at Jack Johnson's Kokua Festival at the Waikiki Shell on the island of Oahu, in Hawaii. Reynolds toured as lead guitarist with the Dave Matthews Band in support of Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King in early 2008. As of the fall tour of 2018, he is still a full- time member of the Dave Matthews Band. =Dave Matthews and Friends= Tim Reynolds playing with the Dave Mathews Band in Chile. Following the release of Dave Matthews first solo album, Some Devil, Matthews brought together many of the albums' collaborators and embarked on a small winter 2003/2004 U.S. tour. The group consisted of Trey Anastasio (of Phish) on guitar, Brady Blade on drums, Tony Hall on bass, Ray Paczkowski on keys, and Reynolds on guitar. Each show opened with a small acoustic Matthews and Reynolds set, and then followed with the full band set with Reynolds performing on electric guitar. Most of Some Devil was played live that tour, along with a wide variety of covers, including, by Reynolds' request, Peter Gabriel's hit \\"Solsbury Hill\\". Dave Matthews & Friends performed occasional shows again in 2004, 2005, and 2006. In 2008, Reynolds joined Dave Matthews Band on their summer North American tour, and scheduled to rejoin them on their Spring 2009 North American tour. Both Matthews and Reynolds have an open taping policy that additionally extends to TR3. Charity Reynolds and Matthews performed on a 2008 album called Songs for Tibet, an initiative to support Tibet, Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso and to underline the human rights violations allegedly committed against Tibet by China.E-Online (22 July 2008) Sting, Matthews, Mayer Gamer for Tibet Than Beijing On 4 October 2009 Reynolds performed with Matthews in St. Louis, Missouri to support Farm Aid in 2009 and again in Hartford, Connecticut on 22 September 2018. Personal life Reynolds has a son Josef, born in February 1982 with his ex-wife, Linna. In 1995, he and then-girlfriend Diane Thomas had a daughter, Eura. They resided in New Mexico with her son Justin Bileyu. In 2008, Thomas moved with their children to North Carolina. Tim followed, to be near his daughter Eura. He currently resides in North Carolina, after living for 17 years in Virginia and several years in New Mexico. On 1 August 2017, Reynolds married Kristin Nienkirchen in Turks and Caicos.

From 1842 until 1854, he was professor of mathematics and mechanics at the national military college. He was elected to the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters in 1853. Andr√¶ was by royal appointment a member of the 1848 Danish Constituent Assembly. In 1854, he became Finance Minister in the Cabinet of Bang before also becoming Council President of Denmark 1856-1857 as leader of the Cabinet of Andr√¶. After being replaced as Council President by Carl Christian Hall in 1857 Andr√¶ continued as Finance Minister in the Cabinet of Hall I until 1858. Being an individualist he, after the defeat of the National Liberals, never formally joined any political group but remained for the rest of his life a sceptical de facto conservative spectator of the Constitutional Struggle. Early life and education Andr√¶ was born in Hjertebjerg Rectory on the island of M√∏n. His parents were captain at the Third Jutland Infantry Regiment Johann Georg Andr√¶ (1775‚Äì1814) Nicoline Christine Holm (1789‚Äì1862). He enrolled at Landkadetakademiet in 1825. In 1829, he was appointed to Second Lieutenant in the Road Corps. He followed a course in mathematics under Hans Christian √òrsted at the College of Applied Sciences before enrolling at the new Milit√¶re H√∏jskole in 1830. He graduated with honours in December 1834 and was then made a First Lieutenant in the Engineering Corps. He completed two study trips to Paris in 1835‚Äì38. Single transferable vote Andr√¶ developed a system of what is now called the single transferable vote (STV), which was used in Danish elections from 1855. This was two years before Thomas Hare published his first description of an STV system, without reference to Andr√¶. Though thoroughly convinced of the soundness of his method of electing representatives and ready to defend it in the cabinet or the parliament, he made no effort to bring it to the attention of scientific men and statesmen in other countries, much less to defend his claim as an inventor. Personal life In 1842, Andr√¶ married Hansine Pouline Schack, an early feminist, who commented on his political views in her diaries, published from 1914 to 1920 as Geheimeraadinde Andr√¶s politiske Dagb√∏ger.

Svafrlami was in the H and U version of the Hervarar saga the son of Sigrlami, who was the son of Odin. In the R version, Svafrlami is called Sigrlami and his parentage is not given. Svafrlami was the king of Gardariki and the first owner of the magic sword Tyrfing. One day, he was hunting on his horse and discovered two dwarves near a large stone. He bound them by swinging his sword above them so they could not disappear. The dwarves, who were named Dvalinn and Durin, asked if they could buy themselves free and undertook to make a magic sword. The sword would neither break nor rust and it would cut through iron and stone as easily as through cloth and would always give victory. When Svafrlami acquired the sword, he saw that it was an exquisite and beautiful weapon and it was named Tyrfing. However, before disappearing into the rock, the dwarves cursed the weapon so that it would never be unsheathed without killing a man, would be the undoing of Svafrlami and cause three evil deeds. One day, Svafrlami met the Berserker Arngrim. According to the H and U versions, they started to fight. Tyrfing cut through Arngrim's shield and down into the soil, whereupon Arngrim cut off Svafrlami's hand, took Tyrfing and slew him. Arngrim then forced Svafrlami's daughter Eyfura to marry him. According to the R version, Arngrim became the war-chief of the aged king and was given both Tyrfing and Eyfura as rewards. For the continued legend of the sword Tyrfing, see Arngrim.

It has about 18,000 inhabitants. The town lies on the banks of the river Oh≈ôe. Kada≈à is a tourist centre with highlights being the Franciscan Monastery and the historical square with late Gothic Town Hall Tower. It is also a town with the narrowest lane in the Czech Republic ‚Äì Katova uliƒçka with only 66.1 cm. History =Early history until the Thirty Years' War= There are legends accrediting the beginnings of the town to Celtic tribes. In the 1st century A.D. Germanic tribes came, but moved on in the great Germanic migration to the west. In the 6th century the country was settled by Slavs. Some talk about a castle on √öho≈°≈• hill that might have been called Wogastisburg where a battle between Franks and Slavs occurred in 631. The battle of Canburg in 805 is also often mentioned in connection with the town, but is a mistake because locality of this name (Canburg ‚Äì Kanina) is in Middle Bohemia. The first written record is, though, of the end of the 12th century ‚Äì the Czech prince granted the \\"market town\\" of Kada≈à to the Knights of St. John. Slavic rulers called German settlers into the country, offering them freedom but gaining taxes at the same time. The Knights Hospitaller built the first church in Kada≈à ‚Äì St. John the Baptist ‚Äì which still stands in the part of town called Hospitaller Suburb, but is now in the Baroque style. In the 13th century, the town was promoted to a \\"Royal Town\\". It began to thrive and a new town was built on the heights above the river, with a castle and Franciscan monastery. There was a big fire in 1362. However, Emperor Charles IV who twice visited the town (1367 and 1374) granted it several municipal rights (home rule, a vineyard, and an annual market) that made it flourish again. The reign of Wenceslaus IV produced the skilled clockmaker Mikul√°≈° of Kada≈à, who, together with mathematician and astronomer Jan ≈†indel, designed the Prague Orloj. The 15th century brought a new dimension to the history of Kada≈à: the town and castle often used to be pledged to royal creditors. At the end of the rule of George of Podƒõbrady first the town and later the castle was captured by Jan Hasi≈°tejnsk√Ω z Lobkovic (John of Lobkowicz and Hassenstein), who seemed to see Kada≈à as a suitable capital for his dependent territories. The establishment and construction of the monastery of the Franciscans of strict observance, built as a family burial-place and later a pardon place of Fourteen Holy Helpers, may reflect his ambitions for the town. Jan Hasi≈°tejnsk√Ω died in 1517 and is buried in the Church of Fourteen Holy Helpers. His tomb is still on display in the Church, now part of the municipal museum. The same year saw the beginning of the Reformation in Germany, which had an immediate impact on the atmosphere in German speaking Kada≈à. In 1534, \\"Kada≈à religious peace\\" was negotiated here between W√ºrttemberg Protestants and Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor for the Catholic side. In the Thirty Years' War during the next century, Kada≈à suffered from fires and plundering by various armies on their way to the battlefields of Bohemia. After the war, the formerly Czech-German town became a monolingual German domain. =The Age of Enlightenment until the 19th century= Kada≈à seen from the river During the Silesian Wars Kada≈à was a foothold for the withdrawing French army that fortified in the Franciscan monastery and was besieged by Hungarian and Croatian units of the Austrian army. The door of the monastery church still shows the bullet holes from that battle on October 14, 1742. The town caught fire in 1746, providing a great opportunity for Kada≈à's \\"Christopher Wren\\" ‚Äì Johann Christoph Kosch. He built many Baroque buildings, including the Church of the Elevation of the Holy Cross, the Church of the Holy Family and the monastery of the Order of St. Elisabeth. The Castle of Kada≈à was rebuilt to serve as a barracks in the time of Maria Theresa of Austria. Her son Joseph II visited Kada≈à in 1779. Joseph's reforms also affected town life. The monastery of Minorites was closed and thereafter became the premises of the first Grammar School under control of the Piarists from 1803 to 1823. 1788 saw the inauguration of the town municipal council. Jakob Marzel Sternberger was its first Mayor and held office until 1822. His great-grandson Jacob Sternberger emigrated to the United States in 1850 as part of the first wave of European immigrants of that time (Max Kade Institute). The last great fire damaged the town in 1811 and since then, the historic centre has retained its pattern. After the Revolution of 1848 the letdown town became a district centre. The institute of the district town lasted in Kada≈à for 110 years when it was affiliated with Chomutov district. In the second half of the 19th century homeland study activities developed and a number of institutions, clubs and societies were established. The national composition of the Kada≈à population was very explicit ‚Äì over 90% German and only 3% Czech, with a Jewish community as well. =20th century= At the start of the 20th century, the \\"Society of Friends of the Museum in Kaaden\\" decided to document the towns' history by opening a museum. In the final weeks of World War I, Czechoslovakia was established on 28 October 1918, its Bohemian, Moravian and Silesian component having been defined by the historic borders of the Czech (Bohemian) kingdom. However, most of the German border population, was not enthusiastic about becoming part of a new republic with a clearly Slavonic definition. Instead, four regional self- governed states emerged along the borderland, Kada≈à declared itself part of German Bohemia. On 4 March 1919, the first assembly of the Austria parliament. This was the occasion for both peaceful and violent demonstrations in the mostly German-populated border cities. In Kada≈à, the curfew and martial law was declared and the Czechoslovak military forces were sent in. The demonstration in Kada≈à for self determination was the bloodiest. According to Swiss Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung report of 7 March 1919, 17 persons were killed, 30 badly wounded, and 80 wounded there. Over all, 25 victims were buried in a memorial grave at the central cemetery. It was restored after the fall of communism in 1989. After the Munich Agreement in later September 1938, Kaaden became part of Reichsgau Sudetenland. The local Czech people were forced to move to central Czechoslovakia, the remaining ones and the Jewish community was strongly oppressed. The synagogue was burnt down during the Kristallnacht of November 9, 1939. According to Bene≈° decrees, after the Second World War, all of the German population was transferred (Flight and expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia during and after World War II), and the area was re- settled by Czech people, many without roots in this region. A prefabricated house after reconstruction From the 1950s, new prefabricated housing estates were built that reached the outer parts of the historical conurbation in the 1960s and 70s. This expansion was necessary because many people had moved in to get jobs in the region's thriving mining and electrical industries. The historical monuments were dilapidated and uncared-for. Before 1989 some parts of the historical centre were intended to be replaced by modern housing. Fortunately the Velvet Revolution changed the trend of development in the town and brought about a change in attitudes towards the cultural values of the past. The historical heart of Kada≈à began to be repaired and after 15 years it has become a pearl of the region. There is now a new site on the bank of the Oh≈ôe River being planned and projected ‚Äì Maxipes F√≠k Embankment with many attractions both for children and adults. The town has been turning to be a tourist centre of the predominantly industrial region. The only drawback for tourism is the lack of a higher-capacity hotel in the town. Economy Although it is situated in an industrial part of the Czech Republic there is no major industry within the town and people usually work in offices or have to commute. There are two large power plants nearby (Tu≈°imice and Prun√©≈ôov).

The oldest of them is the Gymnasium Kada≈à that was established in 1803 with 99 students and continued under the control of the Piarists until 1823. The seat of the old Gymnasium was a former Minorites Monastery (different from the Franciscan Monastery) near the square in a building which is now residence of the Regional Archives. The institute of Gymnasium was then reestablished in 1872 in a new building. The Gymnasium was closed again in 1951 and the new Industrial School moved to the building. It is still there today. A new Gymnasium was established in 1968 and has remained on the same premises since 1978. The Industrial School specialized at first on mining (because of the lignite and uranium mines in the surroundings), however since 1957 it has been specialized on building and finally in 2001 it added Commercial Academy to its educational program so now it is called Industrial Building School and Commercial Academy. The Agriculture School (now SO≈†S a SOU Amos) was established in 1862 as so-called Ackerbauschule. In front of the building there are valuable statues of Albrecht Thaer and Justus von Liebig (restored in 2003). The teaching in all the schools was in German language until 1945. There are four elementary schools in Kada≈à and a school for handicapped children. Churches There are churches and chapels of four Christian denominations: Roman Catholic Church, Czechoslovak Hussite Church, Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren and Orthodox Church. Roman Catholic Parish Church of the Elevation of the Holy Cross is situated in the square. Parks and urban vegetation Smetana Park Kada≈à is situated at the edges of Doupov Mountains with mixed forests and Ore Mountains with coniferous stand. There were three major parks in the 19th century enlarging town. The Municipal park ‚Äì now Smetanovy sady ‚Äì was founded by a Kada≈à inhabitant and future Mayor Peter Prinzl in 1852. Landscape park was also established on the rocks over the Oh≈ôe river next to the Franciscan monastery. A new organisation Anpflanzungs- und Versch√∂nerungsverein Kaaden concentrated its energy on park layout for so- called Svat√° hora or Svat√Ω kopeƒçek ‚Äì Holy Hill that was called \\"holy\\" (heiliger berg since 1541) for its position above the holy pilgrimage monastery. The hill with abandoned rock vineyards became an English park with many viewpoints, arbours and benches at the turn of the 20th century. Jaroslav Havl√≠ƒçek wrote in his novel \\"Vlƒç√≠ k≈Ø≈æe\\" about Svat√° hora that it was a place for romantic walks of young couples. The park the area around was also referred to as Sommerfrische Kaaden ‚Äì Kada≈à summer resort. It was, however, not cared for in the times of World War II and Communists after 1948 left the park to be completely devastated and overgrown. However, the socialist planners projected the new residential areas with much greenery inside. A large, new park came to existence on the other side of the town on the left bank of Byst≈ôice stream ‚Äì now Rooseveltovy sady.

Established during the Mexican War by emigrants rushing to Texas, it remained an important route across Indian Territory until Oklahoma statehood. The Shawnee Trail was the earliest and easternmost route by which Texas Longhorn cattle were taken to the north. It played a significant role in the history of Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, and Kansas in the early and mid-1800s. The Shawnee Trail route \\"Of the principal routes by which Texas Longhorn cattle were taken afoot to railheads to the north, the earliest and easternmost was the Shawnee Trail. Used before and just after the Civil War, the Shawnee Trail gathered cattle from east and west of its main stem, which passed through Austin, Waco, and Dallas. It crossed the Red River at Rock Bluff, near Preston, and led north along the eastern edge of what became Oklahoma, a route later followed closely by the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. The drovers took over a trail long used by Indians in hunting and raiding and by southbound settlers from the Midwest; the latter called it the Texas Road. North of Fort Gibson, the cattle route split into terminal branches that ended in such Missouri points as St. Louis, Sedalia, Independence, Westport, and Kansas City, and in Baxter Springs and other towns in eastern Kansas. Early drovers referred to their route as the cattle trail, the Sedalia Trail, the Kansas Trail, or simply the trail. Why some began calling it the Shawnee Trail is uncertain, but the name may have been suggested by a Shawnee village on the Texas side of the Red River just below the trail crossing or by the Shawnee Hills, which the route skirted on the eastern side before crossing the Canadian River.\\" Gard, Wayne, \\"Shawnee Trail\\", Handbook of Texas Online, s.v. (accessed August 19, 2006) The Shawnee Trail, followed the route from Colbert's Ferry, Indian Territory, in the south, across the Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Cherokee Nations, to Baxter Springs, Kansas, in the north. Later, the Shawnee Trail branched further west. The first route was then called the East Shawnee Trail and the branch called the West Shawnee Trail. The East Shawnee Trail followed the Grand River to Fort Gibson. The West Shawnee Trail which started in Missouri and passed through Fort Wayne before joining the other trail continuing to the Red River on the Texas border. Several stations were set up along the road where travelers could rest and refresh their horses. The western branch particularly remained the main cattle trail from Texas until the opening of the Chisholm Trail (or Abilene Trail) following the Civil War. History of the Trail Texas herds were taken up the Shawnee Trail as early as the 1840s, and use of the route gradually increased, but by 1853, trouble had begun to plague some of the drovers. In June of that year, as 3,000 cattle were trailed through western Missouri, local farmers blocked their passage and forced the drovers to turn back. This opposition arose from the fact that the Longhorns carried ticks that bore a serious disease that the farmers called Texas fever. The Texas cattle were immune to this disease, but the ticks that they left on their bedding areas infected the local cattle, causing many to die and making others unfit to sell. Some herds avoided the blockades, and the antagonism became stronger and more effective. In 1855, angry farmers in western and central Missouri formed vigilance committees, stopped some of the herds, and killed any Texas cattle that entered their counties. Missouri stockmen in several county seats called on their legislature for action. The outcome was a law, effective in December of that year, which banned diseased cattle from being brought into or through the state. This law failed, though, since the Longhorns were not themselves diseased. Farmers formed armed bands that turned back some herds, though others managed to get through. Several drovers took their herds north through the eastern edge of Kansas, but there, too, they met opposition from farmers, who induced their territorial legislature to pass a protective law in 1859. During the Civil War the Shawnee Trail was virtually unused for cattle drives. However both sides of the Civil War used the road heavily to move supplies and troops. Union and Confederate forces fought over control of the route, clashing at the Battle of Honey Springs and Battle of Baxter Springs on the road. After the war, with Texas overflowing with surplus cattle with almost no local markets, pressure for trailing became stronger than ever. In the spring of 1866, an estimated 200,000 to 260,000 cattle were pointed north. Although some herds were forced to turn back, others managed to get through, while still others were delayed or diverted around the hostile farm settlements. James M. Daugherty, a Texas youth of 16, was one who felt the sting of the vigilantes. Trailing his herd of 500 steers north, he was attacked in southeastern Kansas by a band of Jayhawkers dressed as hunters. The mobsters stampeded the herd and killed one of the trail hands (some sources say they tied Daugherty to a tree with his own picket rope, then whipped him with hickory switches.). After being freed and burying the dead cowboy, Daugherty recovered about 350 of the cattle. He continued at night in a roundabout way and sold his steers in Fort Scott at a profit. With six states enacting laws in the first half of 1867 against trailing, Texas cattlemen realized the need for a new trail that would skirt the farm settlements and thus avoid the trouble over tick fever. In 1867, a young Illinois livestock dealer, Joseph G. McCoy, built market facilities at Abilene, Kansas, at the terminus of the Chisholm Trail. The new route to the west of the Shawnee Trail soon began carrying the bulk of the Texas herds, leaving the earlier trail to dwindle for a few years and expire. The Texas Road eventually became part of U.S. Route 69.

It was first released in the UK on 22 October 1965 through Pye Records (catalog number NPL 18128). The US version of Fairytale was released by Hickory Records (catalog number LPM 127 [monaural] / LPS 127 [stereo]) in November 1965 with a slightly different set of songs. Peter Eden, Geoff Stephens and Terry Kennedy produced the original album. History Fairytale finds Donovan evolving his styles further towards British folk, especially on songs such as \\"Summer Day Reflection Song\\" and \\"Jersey Thursday\\". \\"Sunny Goodge Street\\" foreshadows the jazzy feel and descriptions of life in urban London that Donovan would continue to explore over the next two years. Like his previous album What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid, Fairytale primarily features Donovan singing and playing mouth harp and acoustic guitar. Shawn Phillips is playing the extra twelve-string guitar. For release in the US, Hickory Records added a cover of Buffy Sainte-Marie's \\"Universal Soldier\\" and removed a cover of Bert Jansch's \\"Oh Deed I Do\\". Donovan's recording of \\"Universal Soldier\\" was released in the US as a single the previous September, and was achieving some chart success. The Canadian pressing, issued on the British Pye label, omitted \\"Belated Forgiveness Plea\\" but included \\"Oh Deed I Do\\" and \\"Universal Soldier\\". \\"To Try For The Sun\\" was covered by Lindsey Buckingham on his 2006 album \\"Under The Skin\\". Reissues *In January 1969, Fairytale was reissued in an edited form (Marble Arch Records MAL 867) in the UK. \\"Colours\\" and \\"The Little Tin Soldier\\" were both removed from the album. *In February 1991, Castle Records reissued the UK version of Fairytale on compact disc (Castle CLACD226) in the UK. *In 1996, Sequel Records reissued the US version of Fairytale on compact disc (Sequel 1004-2).

The next three songs (\\"Do You Hear Me Now\\", \\"The War Drags On\\" and \\"The Ballad of a Crystal Man\\") are from Donovan's 1965 EP Universal Soldier. \\"Turquoise\\" and \\"Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)\\" were originally released as Donovan's third UK single on 30 October 1965. The last bonus track is the single version of \\"Colours\\". *On 19 February 2002, Sanctuary Records reissued the original UK version of Fairytale on compact disc. The CD features six bonus tracks. The first four bonus tracks were originally released 15 August 1965 in the UK on Donovan's Universal Soldier EP. That EP featured a different take of \\"The Ballad of a Crystal Man\\".

It is one of the most important conglomerates of Chile with equity participation in Antofagasta Minerals, the railroad from Antofagasta to Bolivia, Twin Metals in Minnesota and other exploration joint ventures in different parts from the world. Antofagasta is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.  History  The Group began life as Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia, a business that was incorporated and listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1888 with the objective of operating a railway between Antofagasta, a port on the Pacific Coast of Northern Chile, and La Paz, the capital City of Bolivia. In 1980, a majority the shares was acquired by the Grupo Luksic and the two businesses were subsequently integrated under the name Antofagasta Holdings. During the 1980s, Antofagasta Holdings diversified into other areas such as mining in Michilla, in which it invested in 1983, and mining in the Pelambres, in which it invested in 1986, in addition to telecommunications. In 1996, Antofagasta Holdings transferred its banking activities and its industrial interests to Qui√±enco S.A., another diversified Chilean company also controlled by the Luksic family. This transfer allowed Antofagasta Holdings to concentrate on the development of the Pelambres and the Tesoro mines and establish itself as a low cost copper producer. The shortened name, Antofagasta, was adopted in 1999. The Los Pelambres mine was first recognized by Willian Burford Braden in 1920. One of the largest copper deposits in the world, production in 2016 was forecasted at 355‚Äì365,000 tonnes of copper, 45‚Äì55,000 ounces of gold and 8.0‚Äì9.0 tonnes of molybdenum. In 2009, Antofagasta PLC signed an agreement with the Australian company Carbon Energy to develop an underground coal gasification project in Mulp√∫n, in Southern Chile. The project was put on hold in 2013. In 2015 Antofagasta took control of Twin Metals, a US company involved in a copper and nickel mining project in Northern Minnesota. Under President Barack Obama, the US administration declined to renew the leases for the lands on which the mining project was planned. However, the Luksic Group and Antofagasta PLC managed to have this position reversed under the succeeding administration of President Donald Trump. The mining project commenced a long permitting process, involving significant environmental issues, being located near wilderness area with many lakes and rivers. The project's reversal of fortunes angered environmentalists and focused attention on an unusual connection between a Chilean billionaire and President Trump's family. In February 2016 Antofagasta signed an agreement with junior explorer Evrim Resources to earn an interest in the Ball Creek property located in British Columbia. Antofagasta can earn a 70% interest in the project by spending US$31 million over a thirteen-year period. The company sold its Michilla mine, which is in Chile for $52m in 2016. Operations Antofagasta is one of the major international copper producers with its activities concentrated mainly in Chile where it now operates four copper mines: Los Pelambres, Centinela (previously the Esperanza and Tesoro mines), Antucoya and Zaldivar (50% owned, 50% owned by the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold). Ownership The company is still 65% owned by the Chilean Luksic family.

History Mount Harvard was named in 1869 by members of the first Harvard Mining School class, while on expedition with professor Josiah Dwight Whitney, the namesake of Mount Whitney. The same group named the peak next to Harvard Mount Yale, after Whitney's alma mater. The group climbed Yale first, and estimated that it was over 14,000 feet in height. On August 19, 1869, the first recorded ascent of Harvard was made by expedition members S. F. Sharpless and William M. Davis. Harvard and Yale were the first 14,000 foot mountains in the Sawatch range to be named after universities. Later, nearby mountains were named for Princeton, Columbia, and Oxford, leading to the name \\"Collegiate Peaks\\" for this part of the Sawatch Range. =The pole= In 1962, three Harvard men attempted to erect a fourteen-foot metal pole on the top of Harvard, with a sign that read \\"Mt. Harvard, 14,434. This sign erected at an altitude of 14,434 making it the second highest point in the contiguous United States.\\" Before they could reach the top of the mountain darkness set in, and the group was forced to abandon the pole a few hundred yards short of the summit. The next year, two Harvard men (Tim Wirth, who later represented Colorado's Second Congressional District and then served a term in the U.S. Senate, and his brother John), along with a Cornell graduate carried the pole the extra distance, and completed the task. The pole sat on the mountain for roughly twenty years, until it disappeared at some time in the 1980s, most likely as part of an effort to clean up Colorado's fourteeners.

He led the charge for providing and promoting social support for workers in industrialized cities while also working to promote the dignities of workers in accordance with the social magisterium of the faith. The beatification for the late priest commenced on 21 March 1934 and he was later titled as Venerable in 1989. His beatification was celebrated under Pope John Paul II on 27 October 1991 in Saint Peter's Square; his liturgical feast is not affixed to the date of his death as is the norm but rather on 6 December. Life Kolping as a priest. Adolph Kolping was born on 8 December 1813 in Kerpen as the fourth of five children to the poor shepherd Peter Kolping (d. 12 April 1845) and Anna Maria Zurheyden (d. 4 April 1833). He often lived in the shadow of frail health during his childhood. He proved to be an able student while in school from 1820 to 1826 but his poorness prevented him from furthering his education despite his commitment to pursue additional studies. In 1831 he travelled to Cologne as a shoemaker's assistant and soon became shocked with the living conditions of the working class that lived there and this proved to be definitive in influencing his decision to become a priest; he remained a shoemaker until 1841. In summer 1834 he attended the Three Kings School and afterwards in 1841 began his theological education in Munich (1841‚Äì42) at the college there as well as later in Bonn (1842‚Äì44) and Cologne (26 March 1844 ‚Äì 1845). His time spent on his studies saw him become friends with the future Bishop of Mainz Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler. Kolping was ordained to the priesthood on 13 April 1845 in Cologne's Minoritenkirche but his father died the night before so his ordination was full of mixed emotions. He first served in Elberfeld ‚Äì now part of Wuppertal ‚Äì as a chaplain and religious education teacher from 1845 until 1849. In 1847 he became the second president of the Gesellenverein which gave its members both religious and social support. In 1849 he returned to Cologne as the cathedral's vicar and established Cologne's branch of the Gesellenverein. He united the existing associations as the \\"Rheinischer Gesellenbund\\" in 1850 ‚Äì this fusion was the origin of the present international \\"Kolpingwerk\\". In 1854 he founded the newspaper \\"Rheinische Volksbl√§tter\\" (or the \\"Rhine Region People‚Äôs Paper\\") which became one of the most successful press organs of his time at a rapid pace and the first issue was published that 1 April. He was the editor of the Catholic People's Calendar from 1852 to 1853 and of the Calendar for the Catholic People from 1854 to 1855. In 1862 he became the rector of the Saint Maria Empf√§ngnis church. Pope Pius IX titled him as a Monsignor in 1862 ‚Äì this came about after the pair met in Rome in a private audience in May to discuss the priest's work. He died on 4 December 1865 due to lung cancer; his remains are buried in the Minoritenkirche in Cologne. Kolping had suffered from a severe joint inflammation in his right forearm that spring. He is remembered as the \\"Father of All Apprentices\\" and in 2003 was ranked eleventh in the Unsere Besten. Pope John Paul II visited his tomb in November 1980 while visiting the nation. Beatification Tomb. The beatification process opened under Pope Pius XI on 21 March 1934 and the late priest became titled as a Servant of God as a result of this introduction; the informative process opened on 21 March 1934 and later closed after an unspecified duration but later had to receive validation from the competent authorities in Rome for the cause to proceed. The historians approved the cause on 24 February 1987 while the Congregation for the Causes of Saints (CCS) received the Positio from the postulation in 1988. Theologians approved the cause on 15 January 1988 as did the CCS on 18 April 1989; the confirmation of his heroic virtue allowed for Pope John Paul II to name him as Venerable on 13 May 1989. The miracle that led to his beatification was investigated in the diocese of origin and later received C.C.S. validation on 5 December 1987 before a medical board approved it on 24 January 1990. The theologians also approved the cause on 18 May 1990 as did the CCS on 23 October 1990 while John Paul II issued his definitive approval for it on 22 January 1991. The pope beatified Kolping on 27 October 1991 in Saint Peter's Square.

It lies approximately east-northeast of the town of Alamosa. Approximately to the north-northwest is Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve. Blanca Peak is notable not only for its absolute height, but also for its great local relief and dominant position at the end of the range, rising high above the San Luis Valley to the west. For example, it rises nearly over the edge of the San Luis Valley in only .Blanca Peak on TopoQuest Blanca is also the third most topographically prominent peak in Colorado; it is separated from the higher peaks in the Sawatch Range by relatively low Poncha Pass at . Blanca Peak heads up three major creeks. Holbrook Creek is on the west, flowing from a basin including Crater Lake, Blue Lakes, and Como Lake. An extremely challenging four wheel drive road accesses Como Lake , and provides the most common access to Blanca Peak. Most vehicles stop at an elevation of between and on this road. The Como Lake Road is a designated Alamosa County Road and runs to the edge of the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness just short of Blue Lakes. The Como Lake Road is rated as the most challenging 4WD road in Colorado. The Huerfano River flows from the north side of Blanca Peak. A road, starting out as a two-wheel drive road, then becoming a four-wheel drive road (less challenging than the Como Lake Road), provides access to the technical climbing on the North Face of Blanca Peak. Blanca Creek drains Blanca Basin under the south slopes of the peak, and Little Ute Creek descends from the Winchell Lakes on the southeast side. However these are not used to access the peak due to private property. Three other fourteeners are nearby: Mount Lindsey to the east, Ellingwood Point to the north and Little Bear Peak to the southwest. Ellingwood Point is connected to Blanca by a short, high ridge, and is often climbed in conjunction with Blanca. Little Bear also has a high connecting ridge to Blanca, but it is a technical traverse, only recommended for highly experienced parties.Louis W. Dawson II, Dawson's Guide to Colorado's Fourteeners, Volume 2, Blue Clover Press, 1996, Geology The granite that makes up the Blanca massif is pre-Cambrian in age, dated at approximately 1.8 billion years old. The major part of the Wet Mountains to the east and the Front Range to the northeast are also pre-Cambrian, also about 1.8 billion years old. In contrast, the Sangre de Cristo Range to the north and the Culebra Range to the south are Permian rock between 250 and 300 million years old.

Crabtree (June 8, 1912 - November 16, 1980) was an American flintknapper and pioneering experimental archaeologist. Known as the \\"dean of American flintknappers\\" he was mostly self-educated, however he was awarded an honorary doctorate degree by the University of Idaho. His 1972 publication An Introduction to Flintworking still serves as one of the primary terminology sources for students of lithic technology. Crabtree is known for ‚ÄúCrabtree‚Äôs Law‚Äù, which states that ‚Äúthe greater the degree of final finishing applied to a stone artifact, whether by flaking, grinding, and/or polishing, the harder it is to conclude the lithic reduction process which produced the stone artifact.‚Äù Through practical experimentation and study of archaeological finds (both completed tools and the chips of stone left by their production) Crabtree learned to produce replicas of a variety of different ancient flint and obsidian blades. Life and death Don E. Crabtree was born in Heyburn, Idaho on June 8, 1912. He finished high school in Twin Falls in 1930, after which he worked for the Idaho Power Company. After a brief period he traveled to California where he enrolled in Long Beach Junior College in the mid-1930s with the intent to major in geology and paleontology. Crabtree was noted as being a thinker-while-doing, highly active, and not enjoying studying; due to this he dropped out of Long Beach Junior College after only one term to go his own route. In 1939 he discovered he had cancer, and this discovery briefly impeded his self-study in archeology. During the war years he met his wife, Evelyn, and married in 1943 while working for the Bethlehem Steel Company in California. Crabtree would spend the next 30 years educating and assisting some of the biggest names in archeology at the time such as Alfred Kroeber. Crabtree was also asked for his advice at influential sites like the Clovis type site. After a highly successful career he died in Twin Falls, Idaho on November 16, 1980 of complications due to heart disease. Employment history After graduation from high school Don Crabtree first worked for the Idaho Power Company. After dropping out of Long Beach Junior College in California he began working in paleontological laboratories. By the late 1930s he was the preparator in the vertebrate paleontology laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. It was during this time he became acquainted with Alfred L. Kroeber and E.W.Gifford of the Lowie Museum at Berkeley. His time at Berkeley also included conducting flint knapping demonstrations for scholars and students and occasionally for museum visitors. After his battle with cancer was over in 1941 he worked for several months at the Lithic Laboratory of the Ohio Historical Society. It was during this period that Crabtree was called upon as an advisor in lithic studies to the University of Pennsylvania, where he was associated with Edgar B. Howard and the Clovis point type site at Black Water Draw. Frank H. H. Roberts of the Smithsonian Institution also called upon him around this time to consult on the analysis of the Lindenmeier Folsom point collection. When the U.S. entered into World War II the Lithic lab was discontinued and Crabtree returned to California to assist in the war effort as a coordination engineer for Bethlehem Steel Company, which built the ships for the Pacific effort until the war ended. After WWII he returned to Twin Springs, Idaho and became a successful real estate salesman in the postwar market. Crabtree was employed from 1952 until 1962 as a county supervisor for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) in Twin Falls. In March 1962 he opened the First Conference of Western Archaeologists on Problems of Point Typology at the Idaho State College Museum with a demonstration of his flintworking skills. In 1964 he was appointed Research Associate in Lithic Technology at the Pocatello Museum - a job he maintained until 1975. Awards and honors Don Crabtree was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Idaho for his outstanding contributions to the field of experimental archeology. As a rule he was apprehensive to speak at lectures and publish his work therefore the majority of the archeological community did not realize the depth of his contributions until most of his papers were published in the Idaho State University Museum journal, Tebiwa. After this he became a household name in the U.S. and the ‚ÄúCrabtree School‚Äù of Flintknapping was begun during which he taught some 33 pupils from 1969 to 1975 many of which would produce dissertations that would educate students across the country in lithic technology. In 1969 some of Crabtree‚Äôs work was featured in a special exhibition at New York‚Äôs American Museum of Natural History. He is also credited with the creation of ‚ÄúCrabtree‚Äôs Law‚Äùhttp://delrio.dcccd.edu/pnunley/100/PPT/09lithics.pptDon Crabtree's Law: ‚Äúthe greater the degree of final finishing applied to a stone artifact, whether by flaking, grinding and/or polishing, the harder it is to conclude the lithic reduction process which produced the stone artifact.\\" which is integral in the modern study of lithics.

The penal colony was established by the Portuguese dictator Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. It housed opponents to Portugal's right-wing authoritarian regime. Due to the harsh conditions, at least 32 political prisoners died in the camp. History By 1932 Salazar had become Portugal's Prime Minister (primeiro-ministro). After consolidating his power, he declared the Estado Novo (\\"New State\\") in 1933. It was a government modeled on the Fascist State in Italy ruled by Benito Mussolini. Trade unions and political parties were banned (except for Salazar's own National Union). In response, many left-wing organizations began campaigns against the right-wing regime. Arrests soon led to a rise in Portugal's prison population. Against this backdrop, the Estado Novo, under the guise of reorganization of the country's prisons, decided to build an overseas penal colony for exiling political opponents. Several locations throughout the Portuguese colonies were considered. Eventually, Ch√£o Bom (which means good earth and soil) was chosen on Santiago Island in the Cape Verde archipelago. The site was approved because it was best suited to \\"hygiene, surveillance, and natural resources\\"; all ideal properties that a prison colony should have according to Portuguese penal experts. Ideologically Tarrafal was created for two purposes. First, it would be used to remove and isolate political prisoners who disrupted mainland goals through protests and sit-ins. Second, the camp would have harsh conditions in order to send a clear message to the opposition in Portugal that Salazar's authoritarian regime would not tolerate any kind of political dissent. These objectives were clearly defined in the opening paragraphs of Decree-Law No. 26539 (Decreto-Lei n.¬∫ 26 539), the law that was enacted to build the Tarrafal Prison. It stated that the camp - which would be under the control of the PVDE (Pol√≠cia de Vigil√¢ncia e de Defesa do Estado: Portugal's Secret Police) - was only for the exiling of political and social prisoners who had disrupted other prisons and were considered a \\"harmful element\\" to other inmates.Decreto-Lei n.¬∫ 26539, 23 April 1936 However, the law was eventually extended to include anyone who committed a crime for political purposes, was on remand for political crimes, or had been arrested for a political crime. =First period= On 18 October 1936, the first ship set sail from Lisbon carrying 152 political prisoners. While en route the basic camp was completed on 29 October 1936. Among the first group of inmates were trade unionists and anarchists who had taken over Marinha Grande on 18 January 1934 in protest against the Estado Novo regime. The bloodless coup was put down harshly by the right-wing government. Ant√≥nio Guerra, who led the occupation of the Marinha Grande Post Office was sentenced to 20 years in exile; he died in Tarrafal in 1948. Other prisoners included sailors from two Portuguese naval vessels, the Afonso de Albuquerque and the D√£o, that mutinied on 8 September 1936 where 10 sailors died. In the first two years of the camp, prisoners slept in canvas tents that lacked electricity and ventilation. Old fuel cans were used to bring in brackish water from a source about 2km away from the camp. Due to the heavy and prolonged rainy season in Cape Verde, the tents rotted, forcing prisoners to sleep in makeshift shelters. Malaria was also prevalent. By 1940 the camp had been rebuilt in brick. The enlarged site, which could accommodate up to 4,000 inmates, had cells blocks built around a parade quadrangle, a health center, a reading room, PVDE guard towers and barracks, and administrative facilities. The camp would also operate a small railway in order to transport supplies and fuel. The PVDE modeled its camp regime on the Nazi concentration camps. Prisoners were subjected to brutal authority. Strict regulations were enforced and outside information was forbidden. The PVDE used physical and psychological violence against the prisoners, this included sleep deprivation, beatings, and humiliation. Men and women were tortured for information on their organizations and networks in Portugal. The most severe punishment was conducted in a concrete cell called the frigideira (English: \\"frying pan\\"). Inside this windowless 6m x3m building, daytime temperatures could reach up to 60¬∞ Celsius. Prisoners could be held inside these blocks for days, weeks or months. When used elsewhere, being held in cells of this kind had resulted in extreme dehydration, heat exhaustion, and death. The camp was closed in 1954 due to national and international pressure. =Victims= A total of 32 political prisoners died in Tarrafal; their remains were not returned to Portugal until after the Carnation Revolution (25 de Abril in Portuguese) in 1974: Perimeter walls around the camp.

He wrote a book about his experiences there, called Tarrafal: Campo da Morte Lenta, (Tarrafal: Camp of the Slow Death), which was published by the Communist Party clandestinely and anonymously in 1947. =Second period= The site was reopened in 1961 on the orders of Adriano Moreira, the Minister of the Overseas Provinces.Ordinance no. 18539, of 17 June 1961. It would now be used as a forced labor camp for African leaders and militants that were fighting Portuguese colonialism. Prisoners came from Cape Verde, Angola, and Guinea-Bissau. The frigideira was replaced with hollandinha. Despite the conditions, the prisoners tried to help each other and improve their education and knowledge. They gave classes to one another and trained themselves as translators and clerks. The prison was closed for the second, and final, the time following the Carnation Revolution on 25 April 1974 which ended Portugal's 50-year-old authoritarian regime. The next evening at about 11.30pm, a lieutenant arrived from Lisbon with orders to release all political prisoners. The Portuguese government handed the site over to Cape Verde after it achieved independence in 1975. Legacy Since its closure as a prison, the site has been used as a military base, a refugee camp, a storage facility, and a school. However, these roles have changed and altered the features of the historic site. Buildings have been left badly damaged, many have missing roofs, windows, and doors. Tarrafal is now a museum. The Museu da Resist√™ncia displays photos, plaques, and artifacts. It is part of a project to preserve and record the history of the camp. The long-term aim of the project is to become a World Heritage site. In 2006, the World Monument Fund named Tarrafal one of its 100 watched monuments.Monument Watch List World Monument Fund In 2009 an international symposium on the former Tarrafal concentration camp took place in Praia, Cape Verde, on the 35th anniversary of the camp‚Äôs closing. The symposium was attended by former political prisoners and specialists from the countries of Cape Verde, Angola, Guinea Bissau and Portugal.

An 1828 status animarum recorded 955 inhabitants living in 194 family households. Podgora is the birthplace of Don Mihovil Pavlinoviƒá, a priest, politician and writer, best known as the first person to speak Croatian in the Dalmatian parliament, seeking the unification of Dalmatia and Croatia. Organized tourism started in Podgora in 1922, when the first hotel \\"Praha\\" was built. During World War II, on September 10, 1942, the Yugoslav Partisans formed the Partisan Navy in Podgora. In 1962 Josip Broz Tito unveiled an impressive monument on a small hill above the port of Podgora, The wings of a seagull, in remembrance of World War II events.

They are the only professional rugby union team in Sicily. The club was founded in 1963, and play at the Stadio Santa Maria Goretti. Amatori Catania have thus far not won the Italian championship, but have qualified for European competition, competing in both the 2004‚Äì05 and 2005‚Äì06 European Challenge Cup seasons, defeating Montpellier and Connacht in the last season. They currently competing in the Serie A. History Between 1963 and 1965 the first team played in Serie C but won promotion to Serie B. In 1969‚Äì70 they won promotion to Serie A, but managed to survive at this level for only one season. From the 1972‚Äì73 season to the 1987‚Äì88 season, for sixteen consecutive seasons, he always plays in Serie A. After a season in Serie A2, he won the playoffs, obtaining again the promotion to Serie A, where he remained for seven years. In the 1996‚Äì97 season they were relegated back to Serie A2 and two years later back to Serie B but managed to return to Serie A four years later. The 2004‚Äì05 season, mark the return to the top division, which in the meantime has changed its name to Super 10, under the technical guidance of Orazio Arancio. The Amatori Catania, guided by the head coach Jean-Michel Vuillemin, is the revelation team: from newly promoted to the semifinals, but they were knocked out by Benetton Treviso with the scores of 20‚Äì25 at the Santa Maria Goretti and 21‚Äì41 at the Monigo. The following season is certainly more troubled despite the experience of the international head coach Laurent Rodriguez, but after a complicated start the Amatori Catania managed to hit a difficult salvation after a strenuous fight with the Veneziamestre which ended only on the last day. Worthy of note are the victories in the 2005‚Äì06 European Challenge Cup against Montpellier and Connacht at the Santa Maria Goretti. In the 2007-08 season, the Amatori Catania, guided by Michel Ringeval, disputed a decidedly subdued league, which on the sixteenth day sees it relegated with mathematical certainty in Serie A.

Property features and guest rooms Guest room amenities at Hilton Garden Inns include a microwave, refrigerator, Keurig coffee maker, either a king- or queen-sized bed or two double-sized beds, as well as a sitting area with an ottoman. In addition to standard rooms, some locations also offer deluxe rooms and junior suites. History The Hilton Garden Inn brand began in the late 1980s under the name CrestHill by Hilton. Due to a slow real estate phase, only four of 25 proposed hotels were built. Of these four original hotels, three are still part of the chain today. They are located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Southfield, Michigan, and Valencia, California. The other hotel, located in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, is now a Four Points. The brand was reintroduced in 1990 as Hilton Garden Inn and has grown from four hotels to more than 720 properties in about 25 years. In 2012, the first Hilton Garden Inn outside of North America was opened in Netherlands‚Äîthe Hilton Garden Inn Leiden. It is located on the Old Rhine River, featuring 173 guestrooms and providing all of the brand's signature features.

For other irregular verbs and their common patterns, see the article on Spanish irregular verbs. The tables include only the \\"simple\\" tenses (that is, those formed with a single word), and not the \\"compound\\" tenses (those formed with an auxiliary verb plus a non-finite form of the main verb), such as the progressive, perfect, and passive voice. The progressive aspects (also called \\"continuous tenses\\") are formed by using the appropriate tense of estar + gerund, and the perfect constructions are formed by using the appropriate tense of haber + past participle. When the past participle is used in this way, it invariably ends with -o. In contrast, when the participle is used as an adjective, it agrees in gender and number with the noun modified. And similarly, the participle agrees with the subject when it is used with ser to form the \\"true\\" (dynamic) passive voice (e.g. La carta fue escrita ayer 'The letter was written [got written] yesterday.'), and also when it is used with estar to form a \\"passive of result\\", or stative passive (as in La carta ya est√° escrita 'The letter is already written.'). The pronouns yo, t√∫, vos,The pronoun vos and its verb forms are used in large areas of Central and South America for the second-person singular in the \\"familiar\\" or informal register, generally replacing (but in some areas coexisting with) t√∫. In Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay it is used in the formal register (but the familiar or T form of address). See Voseo. √©l, nosotros, vosotrosThe second- person plural familiar pronoun vosotros / vosotras is used only in Spain (except for the Canary Islands) and Equatorial Guinea; in the Americas its function is carried by ustedes. and ellos are used to symbolise the three persons and two numbers. Note, however, that Spanish is a pro-drop language, and so it is the norm to omit subject pronouns when not needed for contrast or emphasis. The subject, if specified, can easily be something other than these pronouns. For example, √©l, ella, or usted can be replaced by a noun phrase, or the verb can appear with impersonal se and no subject (e.g. Aqu√≠ se vive bien, 'One lives well here'). The first-person plural expressions nosotros, nosotras, t√∫ y yo, or √©l y yo can be replaced by a noun phrase that includes the speaker (e.g. Los estudiantes tenemos hambre, 'We students are hungry'). The same comments hold for vosotros and ellos.

Fluency is defined as linguistic fluency (such as speaking) as well as literacy (such as reading and writing). This approach to bilingual education is among those most commonly implemented in public schools across the United States.Ramirez, David J., Yuen, Sandra D., and Ramey, Dena R. \\"Final Report: Longitudinal Study of Structured English Immersion Strategy, Early-Exit and Late-Exit Transitional Bilingual Education Programs for Language Minority Children.\\" Aguirre International, 1991. The goal of transitional bilingual education is to help transition a student into an English-only classroom as quickly as possible. A bilingual teacher teaches children in subjects such as math, science, and social studies in their native language so that once the transition is made to an English-only classroom, the student has the knowledge necessary to compete with his peers in all other subject areas. Gersten, Russell; Woodward, John. \\"A Longitudinal Study of Transitional and Immersion Bilingual Education Programs in One District.\\" The Elementary School Journal. Volume 95, Issue 3, Jan. 1995, pp. 223-239. Transitional Bilingual Education programs are introduced in kindergarten and can continue up to grade six or seven. Research has shown that many of the skills learned in the native language can easily be transferred to the second language later. This research reflects greater academic progress made by students in Transitional Bilingual Education programs in comparison with those enrolled in many English as a Second Language (ESL) programs. However, it also shows the relative ineffectiveness of Transitional Bilingual Education programs when compared with other bilingual models such as dual-language immersion. ESL courses are sometimes incorporated to provide supplemental instruction. The application of this educational model ultimately came about as a result of an effort to officially recognize Chicano and Latino identities with the passage of the Bilingual Education Act. Transitional Bilingual Education programs are divided into two categories: early-exit and late-exit. Early-exit programs begin with strong support in the students' native language; nevertheless, this support is rapidly diminished. Late-exit programs, on the other hand, maintain strong support in the primary language.Spolsky, Bernard; Hult, Francis M. The Handbook of Educational Linguistics. Wiley-Blackwell, 2010. The fundamental difference between these two models is the length of the program. Early-Exit Transitional Bilingual Education The main goal of early-exit programs is to expedite the acquisition of the second language so that language learners can be integrated into classrooms with native speakers. Less emphasis is placed on progress made in other subjects. There is not much importance assigned to the continued development of first-language skills. After one to three years in the program, students are expected to have acquired enough knowledge in the second language to be transferred to classes in which only the second language is used as a medium of instruction. In early-exit programs, a near-native proficiency in the target language is required of instructors. Institutions may vary in the amount of first-language instruction that is utilized. Dolson, David P.; Mayer, Jan. ‚ÄúLongitudinal Study of Three Program Models for Language-Minority Students: A Critical Examination of Reported Findings.‚Äù Bilingual Research Journal, vol. 16, no. 1 & 2, 1992, pp. 105-157. The degree to which the children's first language is spoken in the classroom depends on the proficiency level of the students, who generally require more instruction in their mother tongue at earlier ages. In kindergarten, the average length of instruction in the first language is approximately one hour each day. The amount of time spent teaching in the first language is greatly reduced in grades 1 and 2. Jacobson, Rodolfo and Faltis, Christian. Language Distribution Issues in Bilingual Schooling. Clevedon, Avon, England; Philadelphia: Multilingual Matters, 1990. Students are first instructed in the grammar and composition of the first language, for it is claimed that knowledge of the first language aids the acquisition of knowledge in the second language; August, Diane; Garcia, Eugene E. Language Minority Education in the United States: Research, Policy and Practice. C. C. Thomas, 1988. they may also be instructed in the language arts of both first and second languages simultaneously. Instruction in reading in the second language doesn't typically begin until students meet the standards for reading in their first language. The students' primary language is used to a lesser extent in the instruction of other subjects. As students make progress in the second language, it becomes increasingly incorporated into the curriculum, gradually taking the place of the first language. Cultural knowledge is imparted through classroom activities and materials. Late-Exit Transitional Bilingual Education The focus of late-exit programs is to ensure understanding of all content areas while maintaining use of the students' native language, allowing a greater transitional period during which students acquire the second language at a slower pace. As is the case with early-exit programs, teachers in late-exit programs are required to have native-like proficiency in the second language. Likewise, both languages are used in the classroom, although a minimum of half of the class time is to be spent using the students' first language. Unlike early-exit programs, instruction in content areas is primarily conducted in the first language. Students receive instruction in the language arts of their native tongue before being introduced to those of the target language. A key difference between early- and late-exit programs is that late-exit programs generally span five to seven years, whereas students may be released from early-exit programs in as little as one to two years. Again, cultural knowledge is transmitted through classroom activities and materials. It is commonly held by proponents of the late-exit strategy that prolonged instruction in one's native tongue provides the student with a greater understanding of its structure, which through contrastive analysis can be used to gain more information regarding the second language. Issues in Transitional Bilingual Education In many Transitional Bilingual Education programs, language ideologies can greatly influence children's learning outcomes. A student's intelligence is often equated with his or her level of proficiency in the second language.Palmer, Deborah. \\"The Discourse of Transition: Teachers' Language Ideologies within Transitional Bilingual Educational Programs.\\" International Multilingual Research Journal. Volume 5, Issue 2, 2011. Teachers with assimilationist ideologies often encourage students to abandon their native language as it is thought to have little value if any. Instructors may be more inclined to reduce the amount of instruction in the students' native language because they believe that the easiest way to transition to the second language is through consistent use of that language. Another issue encountered in TBE classrooms is that instructors seldom provide an environment in which students can produce the target language.

Sylvester Stallone was originally intended to be cast as Axel Foley. Beverly Hills Cop Detroit Police Department plainclothes detective Axel Foley is delighted when he receives a surprise visit from his best friend Mikey Tandino, who lives in Hollywood, California. Mikey is soon killed by a man named Zack. Foley goes to Beverly Hills, California, to find Mikey's assailant (since Mikey told Foley he had a job at an art gallery in Beverly Hills) where Beverly Hills Police Department Lieutenant Andrew Bogomil assigns Detective Billy Rosewood and Sergeant John Taggart to keep an eye on Foley. Foley visits his childhood friend Jenny Summers, who works at the art gallery. With Jenny's help, Foley discovers that Zack works for Jenny's boss, Victor Maitland, the man who owns the gallery. Maitland is a drug kingpin who is using the gallery as a front, and Maitland ordered Zack to kill Mikey after Maitland found Mikey had stolen some of his bonds. Billy, Taggart, and Foley head to Maitland's mansion to apprehend Maitland. Foley and Bogomil simultaneously shoot and kill Maitland. Beverly Hills Cop II Detroit cop Axel Foley is watching the news on TV when the reporter tells a story that Foley's friend, Beverly Hills Police Department Captain Andrew Bogomil, has been shot. Foley heads to Beverly Hills to visit Bogomil in the hospital, and is reunited with Bogomil's daughter, Jan, and Detective Billy Rosewood and Sergeant John Taggart. Rosewood and Taggart decide to let Foley help them find the woman who tried to kill Bogomil, even though verbally abusive police chief Harold Lutz has been trying to find a reason to fire Rosewood and Taggart, forcing the three to work covertly to avoid Lutz's interference. Foley, Rosewood, and Taggart soon discover that the Alphabet robberies, a series of robberies that have been going on in the area, are masterminded by weapons kingpin Maxwell Dent, who had sent his chief henchwoman Karla Fry to try to kill Bogomil because Bogomil had been after Dent. With this information, Foley, Rosewood, and Taggart try to find Dent and Karla. Beverly Hills Cop III One night in Detroit, during a shoot-out at a chop shop, Axel Foley sees his boss, Inspector Douglas Todd, deliberately murdered by a man named Ellis Dewald. With his dying breath, Inspector Todd asks Axel \\"Axel, are you on a coffee break?\\" and tells him to \\"go and get that son of a bitch\\". The evidence at the scene points to Wonder World, a theme park in Beverly Hills, California. Foley does some looking around, and finds the killer's vehicle, which contains evidence of suspected counterfeiting. In Beverly Hills, Axel is reunited with his friend Billy Rosewood, who tells Axel that John Taggart is now retired and living in Phoenix, Arizona. Rosewood is now the Deputy Director of Operations for Joint Systems Interdepartmental Operational Command (DDOJSIOC). Billy also has a new partner named Jon Flint. Foley checks out Wonder World, which is owned by Dave \\"Uncle Dave\\" Thornton. At Wonder World, Foley rescues two kids who are stuck on a ride that broke down, and after this, Foley is taken to see the park's head of security, Ellis Dewald, and Foley recognizes Dewald as Inspector Todd's killer. Flint refuses to believe this, because Dewald is one of Flint's friends, but in actuality, Dewald runs a counterfeiting ring that uses the theme park as a front. Foley is also falling in love with Janice Perkins, who works at the park. When Dave gets shot by Dewald in the chest with his gun, Foley is accused of being the man who shot Dave after rushing him to the hospital. But Dave then tells the entire town it was not Foley who shot him it was their idol Dewald. With the - rather reluctant - help of Billy, Foley sets out to prove his innocence and get revenge on Dewald and Sanderson. This results in a chase and shootout with Sanderson and Dewald's security men all across the theme park. Finally, in the park's prehistoric world ride, Foley manages to kill Dewald and avenges Todd but gets shot himself. As he sits down to recover, Agent Steve Fulbright, who had been helping Foley suddenly shows up after he killed Sanderson. Foley reveals that he has come to suspect that Fulbright is also involved in the counterfeit scheme. His suspicions are true, but as the corrupt agent prepares to shoot him, Foley jumps him, and in the ensuing tussle Fulbright is accidentally killed when his gun is fired. One of the shots, however, over penetrates and nicks Flint, who has just arrived having received a call and discovering Dewald's treachery who shot Dave; both are eventually joined by Rosewood, who has been seriously wounded by the security men. In the end, Flint, Rosewood and Foley are all injured, and Janice invites Foley to an upcoming Tunnel of Love Ride but not before the latest character of the theme park has been introduced‚ÄîAxel Fox and Dave thanks Foley for bringing Dewald to justice. Beverly Hills Cop IV On June 14, 2016, it was announced that Axel Foley will return in the upcoming fourth installment of the Beverly Hills Cop franchise, with Eddie Murphy reprising his role.

The last generation named Angantyr also appears to be mentioned as Incgentheow in Widsith, line 115, together with his father Hei√∞rekr (Heathoric), half-brother Hl√∂√∞ (Hlith) and Hl√∂√∞'s mother Sifka (Sifeca). Angantyr the Berserker Hjorvard and Hjalmar propose to IngeborgAngantyr's father Arngrim had given him the magic sword Tyrfing, which cut through anything as if through cloth, and which killed a man every time it was unsheathed. He was the tallest of the twelve sons of the berserker Arngrim, and he and his eleven brothers spread fear and destruction through the North. One Yule, they were back home on Bolms√∂ when the next eldest son Hj√∂rvard, swore that he would win Ingeborg, the daughter of Yngve, the king of Sweden. The twelve brothers departed for Uppsala and Hjorvard proposed to Ingeborg. However then Hjalmar, one of the Swedish king's champions, stepped forth and claimed he deserved the princess rather than a berserker. The Swedish king, who feared opposing twelve uncontrollable and infamous berserkers in his hall, suggested that Ingeborg herself should decide. Naturally, she chose Hjalmar, and Hjorvard was besides himself with rage. He challenged Hjalmar to a duel on Sams√∏ and declared that Hjalmar would lose his honour if he did not turn up. When the twelve brothers arrived on Sams√∏, they started to go berserk. They bit their shields, screamed loud and coarsely and let themselves loose on Hjalmar and Orvar-Odd's crewmen and began to cut them to pieces. Hjalmar and Orvar-Odd arrived to the scene to find their crew slain and Orvar-Odd, with only his club, slew Angantyr's eleven brothers. After the melee, he found Angantyr dead and Hjalmar mortally wounded by the cursed sword, Tyrfing. Orvar-Odd buried the twelve brothers in barrows on Sams√∏ together with the cursed sword, so that it would no longer cause any harm. However Angantyr's daughter Hervor would later return and claim Tyrfing as her own. This event is known as \\"the waking of Angantyr\\", as recorded in the poem The Waking of Angantyr. Angantyr H√∂fundsson Angantyr's daughter Hervor married H√∂fund of Gl√¶sisvellir and they had the sons Heidrek and Angantyr. Angantyr would be the next of Tyrfing's victims. Angantyr's brother Heidrek had made himself impossible at home and was banished by his father. Angantyr wanted to follow his brother for a while on the road to say farewell, but then he asked to see the sword Tyrfing which Heidrek had got from their mother Hervor. Heidrek kindly showed his brother the weapon, but since Tyrfing could not be unsheathed without slaying a man, Angantyr became its next victim. Angantyr Heidreksson Heidrek would have the daughter Hervor and the sons Angantyr and Hl√∂d. When Heidrek, the king of the Goths died, Angantyr inherited and refused to give Hl√∂d equal share. Hl√∂d attacked with the Hunnish army and in an epic battle, Hl√∂d was slain. Angantyr would be one of the ancestors of the Swedish kings of the House of Muns√∂. References *Henrikson, Alf. (1998).

Paceville is located between Spinola Point and Dragonara Point, delimiting Spinola Bay and St. George's Bay respectively. Paceville is seen as a party destination in Europe and is a popular place for locals and tourists alike. Beach in Paceville Origins =Early years= Paceville traces its origins in the 1910s and 1920s when prominent lawyer and developer Dr Giuseppe Pace (1890‚Äì1971) built a few seaside residence in the area of St. Julian's known as 'il-Qaliet', the small bay between the Dragonara Peninsula and Portomaso. Some of these residencies are still there today, although they are now surrounded by the multi-storey apartments and hotels in the area. Pace's houses were initially rented out to a number of British servicemen who were stationed in the nearby St. Andrew's and St. George's barracks. In the period between the two World Wars, some of these early Paceville residence started to be rented to the Maltese as well. With the arrival of locals in the area of St. Julian's, Dr Pace decided to finance the building of a chapel run by the Augustinian fathers. In December 2000 an adoration chapel known as the Millennium Chapel was inaugurated and two years later an adjoining complex known as WOW (\\"Wishing Others Well\\"). This serves the needs of various voluntary groups that offer free community services to callers from all over Malta; the WOW chapel is all day and night. Prior to the construction of the chapel in Paceville, the Augustinian order in Malta had already built another chapel as well as a convent in St. George's Bay, dedicated to St Rita. These buildings too are still standing and are located just behind Bay Street. =Redevelopment= The areas around Paceville after the war were mostly farming communities surrounded with fields, and Paceville itself only had a few restaurants. Unlike today, parking in Paceville was relatively straightforward as people used to park their cars in fields, one of them being the field on which the St. George's Park hotel was built. Paceville's slow transition into a tourist hub commenced in the 1960s, when two major hotel corporations, the Sheraton and the Hilton, developed five-star hotel properties in the area. The Sheraton opened its hotel in the Dragonara Peninsula. Prior to its transformation, the Dragonara Hotel served other purposes. Originally it was the summer residence of Malta's wealthiest banker, Marquis Emanuel Scicluna, known as ic-Cisk. In times of war, the palace was converted into a military hospital and headquarters of voluntary services. It was redeveloped as a casino, and has now since been redeveloped again in the 1990s by Westin Hotels. At around the same time, a number of bars and clubs started to open in the area in view of the increasing number of British servicemen and tourists living in St. Julian's, St. Andrew's and Pembroke. Throughout the years, bars, clubs, discotheques and additional hotels were developed. Nowadays Paceville is full of nightclubs, strip-clubs, bars and restaurants. Nowadays many youths from 13 years old upwards go to Paceville frequently. Fights and violent incidents happen frequently. On 15 November 2015, a glass banister collapsed in the +1 Club injuring 71 young people, with 2 being critically injured. The incident triggered concerns about children going to Paceville, and both Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and Leader of the Opposition Simon Busuttil have called for better safety measures.

Uncompahgre Peak has a broad summit plateau, rising about above the broad surrounding alpine basins. The south, east and west sides are not particularly steep, but the north face boasts a cliff. Like all peaks in the San Juan Mountains, Uncompahgre is of volcanic origin, but is not a volcano. The rock is of poor quality for climbing, precluding an ascent of the north face. The most popular route for climbing Uncompahgre Peak is Uncompahgre National Forest Service Trail Number 239, which starts from the end of the Nellie Creek Road, east- southeast of the peak. The Nellie Creek Road is a four wheel drive road accessed from the Henson Creek Road, about west of Lake City. The trail to the summit is a strenuous hike rising in elevation in about . It accesses the summit in a winding ascent, starting from the east, passing over a south- trending ridge, and finishing on the west slopes of the summit plateau.

Company information Interface, Inc. and its subsidiaries sells modular carpet tiles, luxury vinyl tile and Nora brand rubber flooring. Its founder, Ray Anderson, was featured in the documentary film The Corporation discussing environmental sustainability in modern business. Interface was founded in 1973 by Ray Anderson, whose decade and a half in the carpet trade had led him to create one of the first U.S. manufacturers of carpet tiles, also known as modular carpet or carpet squares. Carpet tiles, which originated in Europe, became highly popular during the 1980s as an alternative to broadloom carpet, especially in office environments that at the time were switching to flexible, ‚Äúopen‚Äù plans that required easy access to wiring and infrastructure beneath floors. Interface grew to become the largest carpet-tile maker on the planet. Then, starting in 1994, Interface focused on environmental sustainability, especially in reducing the use of petroleum. At this time, the company announced a program called Mission Zero with a goal of eliminating any negative impact the company may have on the environment by 2020. Since 1996, Interface chose to adopt an innovation-based green strategy. In a short period, it managed to reduce its impact on the environment by one third. Each year, the company releases its annual EcoMetrics, demonstrating the company‚Äôs environmental impact and progress. In 2016, Interface announced its new mission, Climate Take Back, which aimed to reverse global warming, one tile at a time. In 2018, Interface announced that all of its products, including all carpet tile and luxury vinyl tile (LVT), are carbon neutral across the entire product lifecycle through its Carbon Neutral Floors program. in 2019, 90% of Interface‚Äôs energy came from renewables. Interface was recognized as Recyclers of the Year by the Carpet America Recovery Effort (CARE). In 2006 and 2016, Interface was voted number one in Globescan's survey of environmentally sustainable businesses.

The mononuclear phagocytic system is part of the organism's immune system. The histiocyte is a tissue macrophageWordNet Search - 3.0 or a dendritic cell (histio, diminutive of histo, meaning tissue, and cyte, meaning cell). Development Histiocytes are derived from the bone marrow by multiplication from a stem cell. The derived cells migrate from the bone marrow to the blood as monocytes. They circulate through the body and enter various organs, where they undergo differentiation into histiocytes, which are part of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). However, the term histiocyte has been used for multiple purposes in the past, and some cells called \\"histocytes\\" do not appear to derive from monocytic-macrophage lines. (The term Histiocyte can also simply refer to a cell from monocyte origin outside the blood system, such as in a tissue (as in rheumatoid arthritis as palisading histiocytes surrounding fibrinoid necrosis of rheumatoid nodules). Some sources consider Langerhans cell derivatives to be histiocytes. The Langerhans cell histiocytosis embeds this interpretation into its name.  Structure  Histiocytes have common histological and immunophenotypical characteristics (demonstrated by immunostains). Their cytoplasm is eosinophilic and contains variable amounts of lysosomes. They bear membrane receptors for opsonins, such as IgG and the fragment C3b of complement. They express LCAs (leucocyte common antigens) CD45, CD14, CD33, and CD4 (also expressed by T helper cells). =Macrophages and dendritic cells= These histiocytes are part of the immune system by way of two distinct functions: phagocytosis and antigen presentation. Phagocytosis is the main process of macrophages and antigen presentation the main property of dendritic cells (so called because of their star-like cytoplasmic processes). Macrophages and dendritic cells are derived from common bone marrow precursor cells that have undergone different differentiation (as histiocytes) under the influence of various environmental (tissue location) and growth factors such as GM-CSF, TNF and IL-4. The various categories of histiocytes are distinguishable by their morphology, phenotype, and size. * Macrophages are highly variable in size and morphology, their cytoplasm contains numerous acid phosphatase laden lysosomes - in relation to their specialised phagocytic function. They express CD68. * Dendritic cells have an indented (bean-shaped) nucleus and cytoplasm with thin processes (dendritic). Their main activity is antigen presentation; they express Factor XIIIa, CD1c, and Class II Human leukocyte antigens. =Langerhans cells= A subset of cells differentiates into Langerhans cells; this maturation occurs in the squamous epithelium, lymph nodes, spleen, and bronchiolar epithelium. Langerhans cells are antigen-presenting cells but have undergone further differentiation. Skin Langerhans cells express CD1a, as do cortical thymocytes (cells of the cortex of the thymus gland). They also express S-100, and their cytoplasm contains tennis-racket like ultra- structural inclusions called Birbeck granules. Clinical significance Histiocytoses describe neoplasias wherein the proliferative cell is the histiocyte. The most common histiocyte disorders are Langerhans' cell histiocytosis and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

They were created to ensure regional cooperation in transportation planning.Leckrone, J. Wesley. 2006. \\"Metropolitan Planning Organizations.\\" Federalism in America: An Encyclopedia. MPOs were introduced by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1962, which required the formation of an MPO for any urbanized area (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs in order to ensure that existing and future expenditures of governmental funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive (‚Äú3‚ÄëC‚Äù) planning process. Statewide and metropolitan transportation planning processes are governed by federal law (). Transparency through public access to participation in the planning process and electronic publication of plans now is required by federal law. As of 2015, there are 408 MPOs in the United States. Chart showing the number of Metropolitan Planning Organizations by state as of September 2015. Purpose Purposes of MPOs: * Transportation investment allocates scarce federal and other transportation funding resources; * Planning needs to reflect the region‚Äôs shared vision for its future; * Adequate transportation planning requires a comprehensive examination of the region‚Äôs future and investment alternatives; and * An MPO acts as a Council of Governments; that is, it facilitates collaboration of governments, interested parties, and residents in the planning process. In other words, the federal government requires that federal transportation funds be allocated to regions in a manner that has a basis in metropolitan plans developed through intergovernmental collaboration, rational analysis, and consensus-based decision making. Governance Typically, an MPO governance structure includes a variety of committees as well as a professional staff. The ‚Äúpolicy committee‚Äù is the top-level decision-making body for the planning organization. In most MPOs, the policy committee comprises: *elected or appointed officials from local governmental jurisdictions such as municipalities or counties; *representatives of different transportation modes, such as public transit, freight, bicycle/pedestrian; and *state agency officials such as, state Department of Transportation, environmental agency, etc.; and *non-voting members such as FHWA, FTA, FAA, FRA, staff advisers from state departments of transportation, Chambers of Commerce With only a few unique exceptions nationwide (such as the MPO in Portland, Oregon), MPO policy committee members are not elected directly by citizens. Rather, a policy committee member typically is an elected or appointed official of one of the MPO‚Äôs constituent local jurisdictions. The policy committee member thus has legal authority to speak and act on behalf of that jurisdiction in the MPO setting. Federal law, however, does not require members of an MPO policy committee to be representatives of the metropolitan areas' populations. Systematic studies have found that MPO policy committees' representations of urban municipalities and disadvantaged minority populations in their areas are less than proportional to population. The policy committee‚Äôs responsibilities include debating and making decisions on key MPO actions and issues, including adoption of the metropolitan long-range transportation plans, transportation improvement programs, annual planning work programs, budgets, and other policy documents. The policy committee also may play an active role in key decision points or milestones associated with MPO plans and studies, as well as conducting public hearings and meetings. An appointed advisory committee (CAC) develops the recommendations for consideration by the policy committee and establishes a ranked proposal for work plans. Most MPOs also establish a technical committee to act as an advisory body to the policy committee for transportation issues that primarily are technical in nature. The technical committee interacts with the MPO‚Äôs professional staff on technical matters related to planning, analysis tasks, and projects. Through this work, the technical committee develops recommendations on projects and programs for policy committee consideration. Metropolitan travel forecasting is one of the key roles that the technical committee supports. The technical committee typically comprises staff-level officials of local, state, and federal agencies. In addition, a technical committee may include representatives of interest groups, various transportation modes, and local citizens. A 2005 survey of MPOs nationally commissioned in preparation of \\"Special Report 288\\" of the Transportation Research Board of the National Academies found that \\"forecast by negotiation\\" was a common method of projecting future population and employment growth for use in travel forecasting, suggesting rent-seeking behavior on the part of MPO committees influencing the technical staff.Committee for Determination of the State of the Practice in Metropolitan Area Travel Forecasting, Transportation Research Board of the National Academies. (2007) Metropolitan Travel Forecasting: Current Practice and Future Direction. Transportation Research Board Special Report 288. Usually MPOs retain a core professional staff in order to ensure the ability to carry out the required metropolitan planning process in an effective and expeditious manner. The size and qualifications of this staff may vary by MPO, since no two metropolitan areas have identical planning needs Most MPOs, however, require at least some staff dedicated solely to MPO process oversight and management because of the complexity of the process and need to ensure that requirements are properly addressed. Functions =Core functions= There are five core functions of an MPO: #establish a setting: establish and manage a fair and impartial setting for effective regional decision-making in the metropolitan planning area (MPA). This planning area is intended to be a future growth planning area extending beyond the urbanized area (UZA) # evaluate alternatives: evaluate transportation alternatives, scaled to the size and complexity of the region, to the nature of its transportation issues, and to the realistically available options #maintain a regional transportation plan (RTP): develop and update a fiscally constrained long-range transportation plan for the UZA covering a planning horizon of at least twenty years that fosters #* mobility and access for people and goods, #* efficient system performance and preservation, and #* quality of life # develop a transportation improvement program (TIP): develop a fiscally constrained program based on the long-range transportation plan and designed to serve the UZA‚Äôs goals while using spending, regulating, operating, management, and financial tools #involve the public: involve the general public and all the significantly affected sub-groups in the four essential functions listed above. If the metropolitan area is designated as an air quality non-attainment or maintenance area, then # * protect air quality: transportation plans, programs, and projects must conform with the air quality plan, known as the ‚Äústate implementation plan‚Äù (SIP), for the state within which the UZA lies. Presently, most MPOs have no authority to raise revenues such as to levy taxes on their own, rather, they are designed to allow local officials to decide collaboratively how to spend available federal and other governmental transportation funds in their urbanized areas. The funding for the operations of an MPO comes from a combination of federal transportation funds and required matching funds from state and local governments. =Expanded functions= In some regions, MPOs have been given authority to handle expanded functions: * Managing a regional urban growth boundary * Distributing a Regional Housing Need Allocation to manage growth and ensure affordable housing * Operating the region's public transportation servicesGoverning Metropolitan Areas: Growth and Change in a Networked Age. David K. Hamilton, 2014. Structure of MPO organizations MPOs differ greatly in various parts of the country and even within states. Some have large staffs, while others may include only a director and a transportation planner. Sometimes the professional staff of an MPO is provided by a county or a council of governments. In many urban areas, existing organizations such as county governments or councils of government also function as MPOs. The MPO role also may be played by an independent governmental organization or a regional government. In the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area, for example, Metro is the MPO. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, metropolitan area, the Metropolitan Council is the MPO. An example of a medium-sized MPO is the Lexington Area MPO in Kentucky. An example of a small MPO is the Kittery Area MPO in Maine. Another MPO planning organization has developed in the area of western central Florida. Several MPOs there, with governance over eight counties, have developed a greater regional planning committee, the Chairs Coordinating Committee (CCC), composed of the chairs of seven MPOs and the chairs of their appointed advisory committee (or their representatives) in order to coordinate transportation planning for the region, that is compatible with all, as well as addressing the challenges of long range planning for a large and growing region that has overlapping issues among the MPOs or transportation plans that extend throughout the entire area. Often the members of the executive committee of an MPO act interchangeably as the representative to this seven-MPO regional committee. This committee meets less frequently than the participating MPOs. Evolving role The enactment of the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) ushered in a ‚Äúrenaissance‚Äù for MPOs. After a decade or more of being consigned to a minimal role in transportation planning, ISTEA directed additional federal funding to MPOs, expanded their authority to select projects, and mandated new metropolitan planning initiatives. For the first time, state transportation officials were required to consult seriously with local representatives on MPO governing boards regarding matters of project prioritization and decision-making. These changes had their roots in the need to address increasingly difficult transportation problems--in particular, the more complicated patterns of traffic congestion that arose with the suburban development boom in the previous decades. Many recognized that the problems could only be addressed effectively through a stronger federal commitment to regional planning. The legislation that emerged, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), was signed into federal law by President George H. W. Bush in December 1991. It focused on improving transportation, not as an end in itself, but as the means to achieve important national goals including economic progress, cleaner air, energy conservation, and social equity. ISTEA promoted a transportation system in which different modes and facilities--highway, transit, pedestrian, bicycle, aviation, and marine--were integrated to allow a \\"seamless\\" movement of both goods and people. New funding programs provided greater flexibility in the use of funds, particularly regarding using previously restricted highway funds for transit development, improved \\"intermodal\\" connections, and emphasized upgrades to existing facilities over building new capacity--particularly roadway capacity. To accomplish more serious metropolitan planning, ISTEA doubled federal funding for MPO operations and required the agencies to evaluate a variety of multimodal solutions to roadway congestion and other transportation problems. MPOs also were required to broaden public participation in the planning process and to see that investment decisions contributed to meeting the air quality standards of the Clean Air Act Amendments. In addition, ISTEA placed a new requirement on MPOs to conduct ‚Äúfiscally constrained planning‚Äù, and ensure that long-range transportation plans and short-term transportation improvement programs were fiscally constrained; in other words, adopted plans and programs can not include more projects than reasonably can be expected to be funded through existing or projected sources of revenues. This new requirement represented a major conceptual shift for many MPOs (and others in the planning community), since the imposition of fiscal discipline on plans now required, not only understanding how much money might be available, but how to prioritize investment needs and make difficult choices among competing needs. Adding to this complexity is the need to plan across transportation modes and develop approaches for multimodal investment prioritization and decision making. It is in this context of greater prominence, funding, and requirements that MPOs function today. An annual element is composed of transportation improvement projects contained in an area's transportation improvement program (TIP), which is proposed for implementation during the current year. The annual element is submitted to the U.S. Department of Transportation as part of the required planning process. The passage of Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users SAFETEA‚ÄëLU in 2005 created new and revised requirements for transportation planning and programs. Although SAFETEA-LU increased standards, most MPOs already were in compliance with the regulations. Some of the planning topic areas include transportation systems security, emergency preparedness, public participation plans for metropolitan planning, and requiring the electronic publication of plans and TIP/STIP by the MPOs. SAFETEA-LU requires that the statewide transportation planning process and the metropolitan planning process provide for consideration of projects and strategies that will protect and enhance the environment, promote energy conservation, improve the quality of life, and promote consistency between transportation improvements and state and local planned growth and economic development patterns.49 USC 5303(g)(3) and 23 USC 134(g)(3) List of metropolitan planning organizations in the United States There are a large number of metropolitan planning organizations in the United States.

In 1984, Lalibert√© founded Cirque du Soleil. The Canadian circus company's shows have since been seen by more than 90 million people worldwide. Prior, he busked, performing as an accordion player, stiltwalker and fire- eater. In 2006, Lalibert√© was named the Ernst & Young Canadian Entrepreneur of the Year.Ernst & Young, 2006 EOY National Recipient In 2007, he was named Ernst & Young World Entrepreneur Of The Year.  Early years  Lalibert√© was born in 1959 in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. His interest in show business began at a relatively young age. His parents took him to watch the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus,Guy Laliberte: The Fabulous Life of the Creator of Cirque du Soleil an experience which led Lalibert√© to read the biography of P. T. Barnum. While he was still in school, Guy produced several performing arts events. After school, Lalibert√© left Canada to hitchhike around Europe at the age of 18. While traveling, he made his money by playing the accordion. Also, he learnt the craft of fire eating and stilt walking during his time abroad, becoming upon his return home a real street performer on the streets of Quebec. Lalibert√© joined a performing troupe called Les √âchassiers, which included fire-breathers, jugglers, and acrobats who hitchhiked around the country to shows. He later returned to Quebec, where he obtained a full-time job at a hydroelectric dam. However, soon after his employment began, the company's employees went on strike. Lalibert√© took the opportunity to return to his life as a street performer. In 1980, he ran as a Rhinoceros Party candidate for the electoral district of Charlevoix in the 1980 federal election.\\"Rhino Party promises to nationalize Tim Hortons, move capital to Kapuskasing\\".

He recognized and cultivated the talents of the buskers from the F√™te foraine de Baie-Saint-Paul and created Cirque du Soleil in 1984 with the support of a government grant for the celebration of the 450th anniversary of Jacques Cartier's discovery of Canada. Cirque du Soleil was originally set up as a one-year project. However, the government of Quebec wanted a touring event that would perform in other provinces. The name 'Cirque du Soleil' (\\"circus of the sun\\"), which Lalibert√© came up with while he was in Hawaii, reflects his notion that \\"the sun stands for energy and youth\\" and that the circus is about those two words.Cirque du Soleil: 20 Years Under the Sun In founding the company, Guy Lalibert√© was assisted by Gilles Ste-Croix. It is said that Lalibert√© is the \\"father\\" of Cirque du Soleil while Ste-Croix is the \\"grandfather.\\" Since 1984, Lalibert√© has participated in the creation of every Cirque du Soleil show. Cirque du Soleil has become a sprawling international operation, as much in terms of its makeup as in the scope of its activities and influence. The organization now has activities on five continents. Its shows employ approximately 4,000 people from over 40 countries and generate an estimated annual revenue exceeding US$810 million.

In April 2007, Lalibert√© finished fourth in the World Poker Tour Season Five event at Bellagio in Las Vegas and won $696,220. Lalibert√© also played on GSN's High Stakes Poker Season 4 show and took part in Poker After Dark season 4 alongside Tom Dwan and Phil Hellmuth. He was also known for frequenting the highest stakes games on Full Tilt Poker. In 2011 Lalibert√© announced the Big One, a $1 million dollar buy-in tournament which was featured at the 2012 World Series of Poker. Part of the prize money was donated to Lalibert√©'s philanthropic organization One Drop Foundation, which primary goal is to provide clean drinking water and hygiene products around the globe. 48 players participated in the tournament and Antonio Esfandiari won the $18,346,673 first-place prize. The tournament raised $5,333,328 for the One Drop foundation. As of September 2020, he has amassed $2.530 million in live tournament winnings with only these two tournaments. Lalibert√© has lost the most amount of money on online poker cash games. Over his six accounts, noataima, patatino, lady marmelade, elmariachimacho, Esvedra and Zypherin, Lalibert√© has lost approximately US$31,000,000. = Spaceflight = In September 2009, Lalibert√© became the first Canadian space tourist. His spaceflight was dedicated to raising awareness on water issues facing humankind, making his spaceflight the first, in his words, \\"poetic social mission\\" in space. The event was accompanied by a 120-minute webcast program featuring various artistic performances in 14 cities on five continents, including the International Space Station. In May 2020, Canada's Federal Court of Appeals ruled that his trip should be considered primarily personal, and not work related, and directed income tax be assessed on 90% of the cost of the trip. In June 2011, Lalibert√© published a book, entitled Gaia, containing photos of Earth from his 2009 trip to the International Space Station. Proceeds from his book are to go to the One Drop Foundation. = Atoll of Nukutepipi = Guy Lalibert√© became in 2007 the owner of the atoll of Nukutepipi in the French Polynesia. Major works that took place there were expected to end in 2016 at the cost of approximately CA$20 million, according to Journal de Montr√©al (see below). In May 2014, Guy Lalibert√© told the Journal de Montr√©al that he wanted to make of this place a shelter that could accommodate his family and friends in the event of a global catastrophe. \\"Because of all that's happening in the world, I said to myself: that could be the place where, in case of an epidemic or a total war, I could bring people I like and my family so that we'd be protected.

The population in 2011 was 9,385,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 7.50 km¬≤.Eurostat History The lands associated with S√£o Roque were once part of a much larger parish of S√©, but later, for a short period it was part of S√£o Pedro. The eccliastical parish of S√£o Roque was dismembered from S√£o Pedro and neighbouring S√£o Martinho by Cardinal Infante Henrique on 3 March 1579. The Cardinal authorised the prelate of Funchal to create a new parish within the dominion of S√©. This was instituted with its parish seat at the ancient chapel of S√£o Roque, constructed by the residents at the beginning of the 16th century, probably from local funds collected by Funchal's citizens (Saint Roch was the patron saint of Funchal protecting them from the plague, during the early part of the 16th century). The small chapel provided its name to a church later erected in 1704, not far from the original building (which remains standing, and is referred to locally as the Igreja Velha, or small church, in Portuguese). But, during the construction there were budgetary deficits, resulting in a slow building process, that eventually resulted in the building's ruin by 1790. A newer church, chiefed (?) by engineer Ant√≥nio Vila Vic√™ncio, was later erected; its main construction continued until 1820, but was finally completed in the middle of the 19th century. Geography S√£o Roque is connected by regional roadway with Monte, Funchal and Faial, and towards S√£o Martinho and northwest to Curral das Freiras. S√£o Roque is not connected with the urban sprawl of Funchal, but developed from the concentration of agricultural use lands, developing into a suburban nucleus later. This includes several of its localities, which were formed from rural concentrations, and developed into residential boroughs by the 20th century: Achada, Muro da Coelha, Concei√ß√£o, Fundoa, Igreja Velha, Calhau, Igreja Nova, Alegria, Bugiaria, Lombo Segundo, Lombo de S√£o Jo√£o and Santana. Economy Until the mid-20th century, the region was primarily agricultural, but the southern limits of the parish have now been developed extensively towards the foothills of the central mountain range.

Plot summary Ann Burden is a teenage girl who believes she is the last survivor of a nuclear war. Since her family's disappearance on a search expedition, she has lived alone on her farm in a small valley spared from radiation poisoning. A year after the war, a stranger in a radiation-proof suit approaches her valley. Afraid he might be dangerous, Ann hides in a cave and does not warn the man when he mistakenly bathes in a radioactive stream. When he falls ill, her fear of being alone forever leads her to reveal herself to help him. She discovers that the stranger is John Loomis, a chemist who helped design a prototype radiation-proof \\"safe-suit\\" at an underground lab near Ithaca, New York. Ann moves him into her house and fantasizes about eventually marrying him. Loomis becomes delirious, with traumatic flashbacks to the underground lab. He talks of how he shot his coworker, Edward, who tried to take the safe- suit to find his family. Though troubled by this revelation, Ann nurses him through his illness and keeps secret her knowledge of Edward's death. As Loomis recovers, Ann is taken aback when he forbids her to touch the safe-suit and begins giving her orders on farming and managing resources. His explanation that they have to plan \\"as if this valley is the whole world and we are starting a colony,\\" makes her uneasy.O'Brien, p. 152. Her uneasiness increases when she asks if he was ever married, and he grabs her hand roughly, rebuking her when she accidentally hits him while trying to regain her balance. One night soon afterwards, she awakes to hear Loomis in her room. When he attempts to rape her, she flees to the cave again. Later, Ann approaches Loomis and proposes sharing the valley and farm work but living apart. He professes surprise when she tells him she won't live with him anymore and asks why, as if he has no idea. Ann remembers that he acted the same after he had grabbed her hand, \\"as if nothing had happened, or as if he had forgotten it,\\"O'Brien, p. 189. She refuses to justify her choice to him, to tell him where she is living, or to come back to live with him. Loomis answers that he has no choice but to accept her proposal, though he hopes she will reconsider and \\"act more like an adult and less like a schoolgirl\\".O'Brien, p. 190.. Though the arrangement is \\"unnatural and uneasy,\\" and Ann worries about surviving winter, she sticks by her decision and wishes Loomis had never come.O'Brien, p. 192, 195. Loomis locks the store, cutting off her supplies. When she approaches him for the key, Loomis shoots her in the ankle. Ann flees, realizing that he had not shot to kill, only to lame her to make her easy to capture. Loomis uses her dog, Faro, to track her to the cave, where he burns her belongings, though Ann escapes. Ann's ankle wound becomes infected. As she recovers, she has feverish dreams of another valley where children wait for her to teach them. Ann comes to believe the dreams may be true and Loomis is insane, so she plans to steal the safe-suit and find her dream valley. Moreover, she decides to kill Faro to prevent Loomis from tracking her, though she is later unable to do so. However, Faro is fatally poisoned swimming across the dead creek to her. Ann finally acts on her plan. She lures Loomis from the house with a note offering to talk if he meets her unarmed, then steals the safe-suit and waits for Loomis to arrive. When he does, she reveals her knowledge of Edward's murder, which shocks Loomis enough to stop him from shooting her. He begs her not to leave him alone. Ann tells him she will send people to him if she finds any, and leaves. Loomis's last action is to call out that he once saw birds circling to the west. Ann walks west into the radiated zone, hoping to see a green horizon. Title It is revealed that, as a child, Ann had owned a Biblical ABC book which mentioned the prophet Zachariah. She remembers thinking that if Adam (who was used for the letter \\"A\\") was the first man on earth, Zachariah (who represented the letter \\"Z\\") must be the last, and likens this to her status as the last survivor of the war. Setting The story's events are set almost entirely in Burden Valley, a small and remote valley somewhere in the USA. It was named after the protagonist's ancestors, who were its first settlers and built a farm in the northern end. The only other inhabitants were the Kleins, a couple who owned the store and mainly did business with Amish farmers to the south. The valley is approximately 4 miles long, from Burden Hill in the north to an S-shaped pass in the south called \\"the gap\\". The largest of its two streams, Burden Creek, is radioactive because its source is outside the valley. It runs parallel to the road from north to south and exits the valley through the gap. A smaller stream originates from a deep spring on an eastern hillside and feeds a small lake with fish that provide a food source for Ann. The stream then meanders south and joins Burden Creek. Much of the valley is made up of woodlands. Ann initially thinks the animals in the Valley are probably the last of their species; however, at the end of the book Loomis reveals he has seen birds flying in the distance west of the valley, which implies other life as well. There are rabbits and squirrels in the valley. There are also some crows, which Ann believes survived because only they had the \\"sense\\" to stay in the valley, while other birds migrated.O'Brien, p. 29. There are two cows, a bull calf, and chickens on Ann's farm.O'Brien, p. 10. Finally, there is the dog, Faro, who belonged to Ann's cousin David. The most important feature of the valley is that it is somehow separated from the surrounding atmosphere and has its own weather system.O'Brien, p. 40. Loomis calls it a meteorological enclave created by an inversion (i.e., air only rising, not falling), but he views its existence as so unlikely that it is only a theoretical possibility.O'Brien, p. 56. Major themes Seeing the story as a conflict between an innocent girl and a domineering male scientist bent on controlling the valley, reviewers have found themes such as the destructiveness of science (at least when it is separated from conscience), the corrupting effect of the desire for power, and the moral value of individual freedom. Ann's sensitivity and love of nature are viewed as contrasting with Loomis' callous reasoning and selfish compulsion to take control.

The prominent fourteener is the highest summit of the Crestones and the second-highest summit in the Sangre de Cristo Range after Blanca Peak. The summit is located in the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness of Rio Grande National Forest, east by south (bearing 102¬∞) of the Town of Crestone in Saguache County, Colorado, United States.The elevation of Crestone Peak includes an adjustment of + from NGVD 29 to NAVD 88. Crestone Peak rises above the east side of the San Luis Valley. It shares its name with the nearby Crestone Needle, another fourteener of the Crestones. The Crestones are a cluster of high summits in the Sangre de Cristo Range, comprising Crestone Peak, Crestone Needle, Kit Carson Peak, Challenger Point, Humboldt Peak, and Columbia Point. They are usually accessed from common trailheads. Climbing Generally climbs of Crestone Peak or Crestone Needle start from a base camp at South Colony Lakes, east of the peak, accessed from the Wet Mountain Valley on the northeast side of the range. This route involves nearly of elevation gain, and ascends to a large relatively flat area called \\"The Pool Table\\" (a few large rocks lie on the tundra, as if billiard balls) or the \\"Bears' Playground.\\" Then it ascends a long gully on the northwest side of Crestone Peak, which involves some rockfall danger (hence a climbing helmet is suggested). Crestone Peak is one of the more dangerous fourteener climbs in Colorado; accidents occur often in the Crestones, some caused by falls or lightning (a daily summer occurrence in the Sangre de Cristos). Alternatively, the Cottonwood Creek route begins in the San Luis Valley and approaches the Crestones from the west. The route follows Cottonwood Creek to Cottonwood Lake. The trail starts out well defined, but after passing a south eastern tributary at approximately 11,1000ft it becomes faint, poorly maintained, and hard to follow for much of the upper route prior to rejoining the standard route from South Colony Lakes. From there, the South Face route of Crestone Peak is accessible. From Crestone Peak, it is a mildly technical (Class 5‚Äîrope recommended) ridge scramble to the summit of Crestone Needle, similarly in the other direction.

The Great Work signifies the spiritual path towards self-transcendence in its entirety. This is the process of bringing unconscious complexes into the conscious awareness, in order to integrate them back into oneself. Accomplishing the Great Work, symbolized as the creation of the Philosopher's Stone, represents the culmination of the spiritual path, the attainment of enlightenment, or the rescue of the human soul from the unconscious forces which bind it. Eliphas Levi (1810‚Äì1875), one of the first modern ceremonial magicians and inspiration for the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, discussed the Great Work at length, giving it a spiritual meaning by analogy to the alchemical Magnum Opus of 'perfecting' lead into gold and mortality into immortality: > Furthermore, there exists in nature a force which is immeasurably more > powerful than steam, and by means of which a single man, who knows how to > adapt and direct it, might upset and alter the face of the world. This force > was known to the ancients; it consists in a universal agent having > equilibrium for its supreme law, while its direction is concerned > immediately with the great arcanum of transcendental magic... This > agent...is precisely that which the adepts of the middle ages denominated > the first matter of the Great Work. The Gnostics represented it as the fiery > body of the Holy Spirit; it was the object of adoration in the secret rites > of the Sabbath and the Temple, under the hieroglyphic figure of Baphomet or > the Androgyne of Mendes. He further defined it as such: > The Great Work is, before all things, the creation of man by himself, that > is to say, the full and entire conquest of his faculties and his future; it > is especially the perfect emancipation of his will. In Thelema Within Thelema, the Great Work is generally defined as those spiritual practices leading to the mystical union of the Self and the All. Its founder, author and occultist Aleister Crowley re-iterated the idea of the unification of opposites, saying in his book Magick Without Tears: > The Great Work is the uniting of opposites. It may mean the uniting of the > soul with God, of the microcosm with the macrocosm, of the female with the > male, of the ego with the non-ego.\\"Crowley, Aleister. Magick Without Tears, > \\"Letter C.\\" New Falcon Publications, 1991. Although the Great Work can describe specifically the moment of union between the self and the divine, it can also deal with the spiritual process in its entirety. Crowley also speaks on the Great Work as the conscious process of spiritual growth. Here Crowley described his own personal Great Work in the introduction to Magick (Book 4): > In my third year at Cambridge, I devoted myself consciously to the Great > Work, understanding thereby the Work of becoming a Spiritual Being, free > from the constraints, accidents, and deceptions of material existence. The aspect of conscious devotion to the Great Work is very important. By purposefully, consciously turning inward and choosing to pursue self- realization, the seeker seals themself in their very own vas hermeticum, their very own alchemical vessel. This attitude of deliberate turning within is necessary for the Great Work. By consciously devoting oneself to the Great Work, and therefore sealing oneself within one's own vas hermeticum, the inner heat of psychic struggle which is generated from this aids in the dissolution of ego boundaries and the integration of what is unconscious. Within the system of the A‚à¥A‚à¥ magical Order the Great Work of the Probationer Grade is considered to be the pursuit of self-knowledge to, as Crowley said in The Confessions of Aleister Crowley, \\"obtain the knowledge of the nature and powers of my own being.\\"Crowley, Aleister. The Confessions of Aleister Crowley, Penguin, 1989. However, Crowley continues, the Great Work should also be something that is integrated into the daily life of all: > I insist that in private life men should not admit their passions to be an > end, indulging them and so degrading themselves to the level of the other > animals, or suppressing them and creating neuroses. I insist that every > thought, word and deed should be consciously devoted to the service of the > Great Work. 'Whatsoever ye do, whether ye eat or drink, do all to the glory > of God'. Although Crowley often discussed the idea of \\"succeeding\\" or \\"accomplishing\\" in the Great Work, he also recognized that the process is ongoing. From his Little Essays Toward Truth: > The Quest of the Holy Grail, the Search for the Stone of the Philosophers‚Äîby > whatever name we choose to call the Great Work‚Äîis therefore endless. Success > only opens up new avenues of brilliant possibility. Yea, verily, and Amen! > the task is tireless and its joys without bounds; for the whole Universe, > and all that in it is, what is it but the infinite playground of the Crowned > and Conquering Child, of the insatiable, the innocent, the ever-rejoicing > Heir of Space and Eternity, whose name is MAN?Crowley, Aleister. Little > Essays Toward Truth. \\"Man.\\" New Falcon Publications, 1991. This idea of an endless Great Work is also seen within classic alchemical perspectives. The idea of circumambulation, represented by the Ouroboros (a snake swallowing its own tail), suggests an endless cyclical process of first dissolving and then re-creating the personality, refining it each time. This idea is also seen in depth psychology as it is related to alchemy, where the Self continually, cyclically faces what it has repressed in order to integrate what has been repressed into itself. The term also appears in the Benediction at the end of Crowley's Gnostic Mass, where the Priest blesses the congregation with the words: > The LORD bring you to the accomplishment of your true Wills, the Great Work, > the Summum Bonum, True Wisdom and Perfect Happiness.

New York City's Olympic bid was managed by a private non-profit organization, NYC2012, founded by Daniel L. Doctoroff, then the managing director of Oak Hill Capital Partners, a private equity firm. Doctoroff thought of bringing the Olympic Games to New York after witnessing New York's international sports fans at a 1994 FIFA World Cup match in Giants Stadium. He then built a team to help craft a plan for staging the Games. Seven years later, Doctoroff resigned as President of NYC2012 to join the administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg, but he continued to lead New York's Olympic Bid as Deputy Mayor for Economic Development and Rebuilding. Two of the biggest projects proposed as part of the bid were the revival of the East River waterfront, including the construction of an Olympic Village across the river from the United Nations Headquarters and an aquatics center in Brooklyn, and the construction of West Side Stadium, which was supposed to have led to the comprehensive redevelopment of the Far West Side of Manhattan. Other projects that were part of the bid included a rowing course in Queens, a velodrome in the South Bronx, a marina along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, an equestrian center on Staten Island, and the refurbishment of the historic 369th Regiment Armory in Harlem.

Costing an estimate of $1.5 billion, the Village would include plazas and shops, restaurants, acres of green landscape, training centers and fields, a private dining hall, religious centers, and ferry and train service.

Host to Opening and Closing Ceremonies and Athletics competitions, the West Side Stadium would have sat adjacent to the Jacob Javits Convention Center, host to six Olympic sports, Olympic Square Park, and a new 40+ story office tower that would have housed Olympic broadcasters in 2012. The Stadium's construction was scheduled to proceed regardless of whether New York was awarded the 2012 Olympic Games. The project was to be paid for by the New York Jets ($800 million), New York City ($300 million for infrastructure), and New York State ($300 million for the retractable roof). According to the project's promoters, the building's retractable roof, unnecessary for football, would make the stadium a flexible, multi-purpose facility. It would provide a long-term boost to New York's economy and would jump-start the development of Manhattan's Far West Side. Local civic groups concerned with congestion and a changing neighborhood had long opposed its construction, and it historically had low citywide approval ratings. The project managed to stay largely out of the media and public spotlight until early 2004 when Cablevision released its first round of advertising against the Stadium. As the owner of Madison Square Garden, which is located just a few blocks from the site of the proposed Olympic Stadium, Cablevision saw the new facility as a potential threat to the Garden's share of concert, convention, and other major event business. https://ny.curbed.com/2015/1/30/9997132/how-the-new- york-jets-very-nearly-got-a-west-side-stadium Political opponents of New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, notably the contenders for the Democratic mayoral nomination, used the Stadium issue as a symbol that he was a billionaire who was out of touch with the needs of average New Yorkers. Cablevision spent over $30 million on negative advertising and political lobbying and even generated a competing proposal for development of the Stadium site. However, the Stadium was strongly supported by Bloomberg, who insisted that there was no alternate site for the Olympic Stadium and the project needed to be approved before the International Olympic Committee selected the Host City on July 6, 2005. Finally, on June 6, 2005, the Public Authorities Control Board rejected New York State's $300 million contribution for the project, eliminating the possibility that an Olympic Stadium on that site would be fully approved before the IOC's vote. The City, working with NYC2012, quickly developed a backup plan, which called for a new ballpark for the New York Mets in Queens in the parking lot of Shea Stadium ‚Äì later named Citi Field ‚Äì to be completed for the 2009 baseball season; it was announced on June 12, 2005. The plan would've been to use the stadium for the 2012 Olympics while the Mets would play at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx for that year's baseball season. Post- bid development Despite the bid's failure the greatest legacy of the NYC2012 bid has been large-scale development of areas of New York City that underwent rezoning in order to move forward with the NYC2012 bid. Manhattan's Hudson Yards and Brooklyn's waterfront in Williamsburg and Greenpoint both underwent rezoning revisions which were in part due to the region's planned roles as Olympic venues, including the controversial West Side Stadium. (The 7 Subway Extension, which was originally planned for the 2012 Olympic bid, was revised to serve the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project.) The development of the once industrial Queens West neighborhood on the East River may also have origins in the bid, as it was initially slated for development as the planned site of the Olympic Village. Following the Games, the site was to be bought by private developers and converted into condominiums. =Potential 2024 bid= Upon the USOC reaching a new revenue sharing agreement with the IOC in May 2012, New York had been mentioned as a potential candidate for the 2024 Summer Olympics, but Mayor Bill de Blasio decided not to bid in May 2014.A New York City Olympic Games Considered Los Angeles became the US candidate following the withdrawal of Boston's bid. Los Angeles later secured the right to host the 2028 Summer Olympics while Paris (which competed with New York in the 2012 race) secured the 2024 Summer Olympics. =Citi Field= After the Olympic bid failed, the construction of Citi Field in Queens, now designated as the new home of the New York Mets, went on as scheduled; the Mets played their first game in the stadium in April 2009. =Flushing Meadows Natatorium= Despite the bid's failure, construction of an aquatics center at Flushing Meadow Park went ahead. The Flushing Meadows Natatorium opened in 2008. =Barclays Center= The opening of the Barclays Center (which was the proposed venue for gymnastics) ushered in the return of professional sports franchises to Brooklyn for the first time since the Brooklyn Dodgers left in 1957. The Barclays Center is the home of the NBA's Brooklyn Nets. =Hudson Yards= The Vessel Despite the failure to approve the West Side Stadium, the site of the West Side Rail Yards still saw development. The Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project saw the construction of multiple buildings and mixed-use developments which has led to the creation of a new neighborhood. The new buildings feature office space and residential space. A shopping mall has also been opened. Renovations were made to the Javits Center (which would have hosted multiple Olympic events) and the 7 Train was extended to its current terminal at 34th Street. The High Line originates at the Hudson Yards and are an elevated urban park built on former train tracks.

The current Head of School, since 2015, is Craig Gemmell. History Brewster Academy in 1909 Brewster Academy's Academic Building, where most classes are held The school was founded in 1820 by local citizens as a \\"building for higher education\\". Originally called the \\"Wolfeboro & Tuftonboro Academy\\", in 1887 it was renamed \\"Brewster Free Academy\\" in honor of benefactor John Brewster. For sixty years it charged no tuition fee to local residents, and, from its inception until 1964, the school served as the only high school in Wolfeboro, as well as serving day students from neighboring towns. In 1946, the academy begin to charge a small tuition, and Wolfeboro at its town meeting in March 1947 voted to pay local students' tuition fees.Editor's personal experience. During the immediate postwar years, it was a popular school with military veterans seeking to improve their credentials for a university education under the G.I. Bill. In 1963 the graduating class consisted of 60 local students, with 30 additional post-graduate students who boarded on campus. Many were there to increase their athletic prowess, and some, including Milt Morin who played in the NFL, had successful college and pro sports careers. The local students were then moved to Kingswood Regional High School in town and Brewster became a private boarding school. In 1985, Digital Equipment Corporation co-founder Ken Olsen donated a number of Digital personal computers to Brewster. The computers were part of a new lab dedicated to Grace Murray Hopper, whose family had a summer house in Wolfeboro. The lab is called the Grace Murray Hopper Center for Computer Learning. Brewster has hosted the Great Waters Music Festival since 1995. This summer festival promotes live musical performances including choral, symphonic, folk, pops, jazz, Broadway, dance, and renowned vocal and instrumental artists.

Cariboo was a federal electoral district in British Columbia, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1871 to 1892. This riding was first created as Cariboo District following British Columbia's admission into the Canadian Confederation in 1871. The name was changed to \\"Cariboo\\" in 1872, and existed in this form until it was abolished in 1892 when it was amalgamated into the new riding of Yale‚ÄîCariboo. In 1914, Yale‚ÄîCariboo was redistributed and Yale and Cariboo were separate ridings once again, though with smaller areas than before. The Cariboo riding lasted until 1966. The succession of ridings for the Cariboo area since then has been: *Kamloops‚ÄîCariboo (1966‚Äî1976) *Cariboo‚ÄîChilcotin (1976‚Äî2003) *Cariboo‚ÄîPrince George (2003 - ) *Kamloops‚ÄîThompson‚ÄîCariboo (2004 - ) The Chilcotin region of the riding, west of the Fraser River, was from 1966 to 1976 part of the Coast Chilcotin riding. The original form of the riding was the whole of the Cariboo Plateau and both Cariboo and Lillooet Land Districts. Its southern boundary was on the northern edge of the New Westminster riding, and later the Burrard riding, then the North Vancouver riding, with near- coastal localities such as Pemberton, Squamish, Britannia Beach and Port Douglas all politically part of \\"Cariboo\\". Under the Representation Act of 1892, the constituencies of Yale and Cariboo were united to form Yale‚ÄîCariboo. In 1914 that riding was broken up and the Yale and Cariboo riding-names were restored, although the new constituencies were considerably smaller than before. The restored Yale riding included the Boundary Country around Grand Forks and Greenwood, but the Kootenay was now a separate riding and the town of Yale itself was not in the restored Yale riding, but in the new riding of Westminster District. The first election using the new boundaries was in 1917. \\"Government\\" and \\"Opposition\\" were used during the wartime campaign to designate the governing Conservatives vs the Opposition Liberals. A major redistribution in 1952 took away the southern half of the Cariboo district, with a southern boundary at 52 degrees 30 minutes north, just excluding Williams Lake and the south bank of Quesnel Lake. The rest of the riding extended to the Little Rancheria River and the border with Yukonand the Northwest Territories, therefore including the Omineca, Prince George and Peace River districts.

New Westminster was a federal electoral district in the province of British Columbia, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1871 to 1979. This riding was created in 1871 as New Westminster District when British Columbia joined Confederation and filled by special byelection. It was renamed \\"New Westminster\\" in 1872. The riding was abolished in 1976, when it was redistributed into the ridings of New Westminster‚ÄîCoquitlam and Burnaby.  History of boundaries  Originally, this riding covered the entirety of the Lower Mainland, there being no other riding in the area (Vancouver riding was Vancouver Island, not the present city of Vancouver). Once the City of Vancouver and its suburbs the municipalities of Point Grey and South Vancouver were chartered, those areas were excluded from the New Westminster riding (1903) but the riding continued to include Richmond, Delta and all the Fraser Valley communities up the river to one mile beyond Yale. In 1914, the riding consisted or New Westminster, Richmond and Delta - the Surrey-Langley area had become part of the Fraser Valley riding. In a further redistribution in 1924, the riding was shrunk to all areas south of the Fraser River west of and including the Township of Langley, plus the city of New Westminster and the City of Burnaby. As population in the Lower Mainland continued to grow, the 1933 redistribution limited the riding to New Westminster and Burnaby, except those parts of Burnaby in extensions of the City of Vancouver ridings. In 1947, Burnaby was split off and New Westminster riding had Surrey, Delta and Langley back in (but not Richmond). The 1966 redistribution, which combined northern Burnaby into North Vancouver-Seymour, New Westminster riding extended as far into Burnaby as Grandview Highway and Edmonds Avenue, including Burnaby Mountain and the areas of Coquitlam west of Laurentian Avenue. At the time this included the then-municipality of Fraser Mills adjoining the francophone community at Maillardville. Langley, Surrey and Delta were excluded from the riding. The riding was abolished in 1976. Successor ridings were Burnaby and New Westminster‚ÄîCoquitlam.

This unit was established by Edgar Anstey in 1934 as a result of a report written by documentary film-maker John Grierson about how Shell could make better use of film publicity.Aitken, Film and Reform, p. 136. Rather than being direct advertising, the films produced served to promote a more positive image of Shell as existing for the public good rather than merely for profit.Pronay, '\\"The land of promise\\"', p. 57. He also established, with John Betjeman, the 'Shell Guides' to English counties. =Second World War= In April 1940, Beddington was appointed director of the Ministry of Information Films Division, replacing Kenneth Clark. He remained in this post until 1946. In August 1940, he renamed the GPO Film Unit as the Crown Film Unit, with Ian Dalrymple as its head. This unit focused on the production of documentary films, which Beddington supported even in the face of opposition from the Select Committee on National Expenditure.Aldgate and Richards, Britain Can Take It, p. 7. Almost three-quarters of all films produced or commissioned by the Films Division between 1940 and 1945 were written, directed or produced by members of the documentary film movement, a group of film-makers brought together by John Grierson.Aldgate and Richards, Britain Can Take It, p. 8. Although many of these documentaries were for non- theatrical distribution, under Beddington's tenure, the Crown Film Unit produced such feature-length documentaries as Target for Tonight, Desert Victory and Western Approaches. After the war, Beddington and Barnett Freedman helped launch the Lyons' Lithograph series.

Alternatively, in terms given by Bart Ehrman paraphrasing Earl Doherty, \\"the historical Jesus did not exist. Or if he did, he had virtually nothing to do with the founding of Christianity.\\" It is a fringe theory, supported by few tenured or emeritus specialists in biblical criticism or cognate disciplines. It is criticised for its outdated reliance on comparisons between mythologies, and deviates from the mainstream historical view. There are three strands of mythicism, including the view that there may have been a historical Jesus, who lived in a dimly remembered past, and was fused with the mythological Christ of Paul. A second stance is that there was never a historical Jesus, only a mythological character, later historicized in the Gospels. A third view is that no conclusion can be made about a historical Jesus, and if there was one, nothing can be known about him. Most Christ mythicists follow a threefold argument: they question the reliability of the Pauline epistles and the Gospels to establish the historicity of Jesus; they note the lack of information on Jesus in non-Christian sources from the first and early second centuries; and they argue that early Christianity had syncretistic and mythological origins, as reflected in both the Pauline epistles and the gospels, with Jesus being a celestial being who was concretized in the Gospels. Therefore, Christianity was not founded on the shared memories of a man, but rather a shared mytheme.  Traditional and modern approaches on Jesus  The origins and rapid rise of Christianity, as well as the historical Jesus and the historicity of Jesus, are a matter of longstanding debate in theological and historical research. While Christianity may have started with an early nucleus of followers of Jesus, within a few years after the presumed death of Jesus in , at the time Paul started preaching, a number of \\"Jesus- movements\\" seem to have been in existence, which propagated divergent interpretations of Jesus' teachings. A central question is how these communities developed and what their original convictions were, as a wide range of beliefs and ideas can be found in early Christianity, including adoptionism and docetism, and also Gnostic traditions which used Christian imagery, which were all deemed heretical by proto-orthodox Christianity. = Quest for the historical Jesus = A first quest for the historical Jesus took place in the 19th century, when hundreds of Lives of Jesus were being written. David Strauss (1808‚Äì1874) pioneered the search for the \\"Historical Jesus\\" by rejecting all supernatural events as mythical elaborations. His 1835 work, Life of Jesus, was one of the first and most influential systematic analyses of the life story of Jesus, aiming to base it on unbiased historical research.Jesus as a Figure in History: How Modern Historians View the Man from Galilee by Mark Allan Powell, Westminster John Knox Press, 1998 pages 13‚Äì15The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth. by Ben Witherington III, InterVarsity Press, 1997 (second expanded edition), pp. 9‚Äì13 The Religionsgeschichtliche Schule, starting in the 1890s, used the methodologies of higher criticism,Duignan, Brian (2016), Religionsgeschichtliche Schule, Encyclopedia Britannica a branch of criticism that investigates the origins of ancient texts in order to understand \\"the world behind the text\\". It compared Christianity to other religions, regarding it as one religion among others and rejecting its claims to absolute truth, and demonstrating that it shares characteristics with other religions. It argued that Christianity was not simply the continuation of the Old Testament, but syncretistic, and was rooted in and influenced by Hellenistic Judaism (Philo) and Hellenistic religions like the mystery cults and Gnosticism. Martin K√§hler questioned the usefulness of the search for the historical Jesus, making the famous distinction between the \\"Jesus of history\\" and the \\"Christ of faith\\", arguing that faith is more important than exact historical knowledge. Rudolf Bultmann (1884‚Äì1976), who was related to the Religionsgeschichtliche Schule,Kurt Rudolph (1987), Religionsgeschichtliche Schule, Encyclopedia of Religion emphasized theology, and in 1926 had argued that historical Jesus research was both futile and unnecessary; although Bultmann slightly modified that position in a later book.Edwin Broadhead \\"Implicit Christology and the Historical Jesus\\" in the Handbook for the Study of the Historical Jesus edited by Tom Holmen and Stanley E. Porter, Brill 2010 pp. 1170‚Äì1172 This first quest ended with Albert Schweitzer's 1906 critical review of the history of the search for Jesus's life in The Quest of the Historical Jesus ‚Äì From Reimarus to Wrede. Already in the 19th and early 20th century, this quest was challenged by authors who denied the historicity of Jesus, notably Bauer and Drews. The second quest started in 1953, in a departure from Bultmann.The First Christian by Paul F. M. Zahl, Eerdmans 2003 pp. 23‚Äì25 Several criteria, the criterion of dissimilarity and the criterion of embarrassment, were introduced to analyze and evaluate New Testament narratives. This second quest faded away in the 1970s, due to the diminishing influence of Bultmann, and coinciding with the first publications of Wells, which marks the onset of the revival of Christ myth theories. According to Paul Zahl, while the second quest made significant contributions at the time, its results are now mostly forgotten, although not disproven.The First Christian: Universal Truth in the Teachings of Jesus by Paul F. M. Zahl, Eerdmans 2003 p. 12 The third quest started in the 1980s, and introduced new criteria.Criteria for Authenticity in Historical-Jesus Research by Stanley E.

Meier \\"Criteria: How do we decide what comes from Jesus?\\" in The Historical Jesus in Recent Research by James D. G. Dunn and Scot McKnight, Eisenbrauns 2006 pages 126‚Äì142 the criterion of historical plausibility, the criterion of rejection and execution, and the criterion of congruence (also called cumulative circumstantial evidence), a special case of the older criterion of coherence.Petr Pokorny \\"Jesus Research as Feedback\\" Handbook for the Study of the Historical Jesus by Tom Holmen and Stanley E.

Charlesworth in Jesus and archaeology edited by James H. Charlesworth 2006 pp. 11‚Äì15 The third quest yielded new insights into Jesus' Palestinian and Jewish context, and not so much on the person of Jesus himself. It also has made clear that all material on Jesus has been handed down by the emerging Church, raising questions about the criterion of dissimilarity, and the possibility of ascribing material solely to Jesus, and not to the emerging Church. = A historical Jesus existed = These critical methods have led to a demythologization of Jesus. The mainstream scholarly view is that the Pauline epistles and the gospels describe the Christ of faith, presenting a religious narrative which replaced the historical Jesus who did live in 1st-century Roman Palestine. Yet, that there was a historical Jesus is not in doubt. New Testament scholar Bart D. Ehrman states that Jesus \\"certainly existed, as virtually every competent scholar of antiquity, Christian or non-Christian, agrees\\". Following the criteria of authenticity- approach, scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, but the baptism and the crucifixion are two events in the life of Jesus which are subject to \\"almost universal assent\\". According to historian Alanna Nobbs, The portraits of Jesus have often differed from each other and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts. The primary portraits of Jesus resulting from the Third Quest are: apocalyptic prophet; charismatic healer; cynic philosopher; Jewish Messiah; and prophet of social change.The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament by Andreas J. K√∂stenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 pp. 124‚Äì125The Cambridge History of Christianity, Volume 1 by Margaret M. Mitchell and Frances M. Young, Cambridge University Press 2006 page 23 According to Ehrman, the most widely held view is that Jesus was an apocalyptic prophet, who was subsequently deified. According to James Dunn, it is not possible \\"to construct (from the available data) a Jesus who will be the real Jesus\\".James D. G. Dunn (2003), Jesus Remembered, Volume 1, pp. 125‚Äì126: \\"the historical Jesus is properly speaking a nineteenth- and twentieth-century construction using the data supplied by the Synoptic tradition, not Jesus back then\\", (the Jesus of Nazareth who walked the hills of Galilee), \\"and not a figure in history whom we can realistically use to critique the portrayal of Jesus in the Synoptic tradition\\".T. Merrigan, \\"The Historical Jesus in the Pluralist Theology of Religions\\", in The Myriad Christ: Plurality and the Quest for Unity in Contemporary Christology (ed. T. Merrigan and J. Haers). Princeton‚ÄìPrague Symposium on Jesus Research; and Charlesworth, J. H. Jesus research: New methodologies and perceptions: the second Princeton‚ÄìPrague Symposium on Jesus Research, Princeton 2007, pp. 77‚Äì78: \\"Dunn points out as well that 'the Enlightenment Ideal of historical objectivity also projected a false goal onto the quest for the historical Jesus', which implied that there was a 'historical Jesus', objectively verifiable, 'who will be different from the dogmatic Christ and the Jesus of the Gospels and who will enable us to criticize the dogmatic Christ and the Jesus of the Gospels' (Jesus Remembered, p. 125).\\" According to Philip R. Davies, a Biblical minimalist, \\"what is being affirmed as the Jesus of history is a cipher, not a rounded personality\\".Philip Davies, Did Jesus Exist? According to Ehrman, \\"the real problem with Jesus\\" is not the mythicist stance that he is \\"a myth invented by Christians\\", but that he was \\"far too historical\\", that is, a first-century Palestine Jew, who was not like the Jesus preached and proclaimed today. According to Ehrman, \\"Jesus was a first-century Jew, and when we try to make him into a twenty-first century American we distort everything he was and everything he stood for.\\" = Demise of authenticity and call for memory studies = Since the late 2000s, concerns have been growing about the usefulness of the criteria of authenticity.April DeConinck (2007), The Fourth Quest for the Historical Jesus?Valerie Tarico & David Fitzgerald (2017), Evidence for Jesus is weaker than you might think, RawStory According to Keith, the criteria are literary tools, indebted to form criticism, not historiographic tools. They were meant to discern pre-Gospel traditions, not to identify historical facts, but have \\"substituted the pre-literary tradition with that of the historical Jesus\\". According to Le Donne, the usage of such criteria is a form of \\"positivist historiography\\".Thinkapologtics.com, Book Review: Jesus, Criteria, and the Demise of Authenticity, by Chris Keith and Anthony Le Donne Chris Keith, Le Donne, and others argue for a \\"social memory\\" approach, which states that memories are shaped by the needs of the present. Instead of searching for a historical Jesus, scholarship should investigate how the memories of Jesus were shaped, and how they were reshaped \\"with the aim of cohesion and the self-understanding (identity) of groups\\". James D. G. Dunn's 2003 study, Jesus Remembered, was the onset for this \\"increased ... interest in memory theory and eyewitness testimony\\".Benjamin I. Simpson, review of The Historiographical Jesus. Memory, Typology, and the Son of DavidAnthony le Donne (2012), So What is All of This Business about ‚ÄúMemory‚Äù in Jesus Research? Dunn argues that \\"[t]he only realistic objective for any 'quest of the historical Jesus' is Jesus remembered.\\" Dunn argues that Christianity started with the impact Jesus himself had on his followers, who passed on and shaped their memories of him in an oral gospel tradition. According to Dunn, to understand who Jesus was, and what his impact was, scholars have to look at \\"the broad picture, focusing on the characteristic motifs and emphases of the Jesus tradition, rather than making findings overly dependent on individual items of the tradition\\". Anthony le Donne elaborated on Dunn's thesis, basing \\"his historiography squarely on Dunn‚Äôs thesis that the historical Jesus is the memory of Jesus recalled by the earliest disciples\\". According to Le Donne, memories are refactored, and not an exact recalling of the past. Le Donne argues that the remembrance of events is facilitated by relating it to a common story or \\"type\\". The type shapes the way the memories are retained, c.q. narrated. This means that the Jesus- tradition is not a theological invention of the early Church, but is shaped and refracted by the restraints that the type puts on the narrated memories, due to the mold of the type. According to Chris Keith, an alternative to the search for a historical Jesus \\"posits a historical Jesus who is ultimately unattainable, but can be hypothesized on the basis of the interpretations of the early Christians, and as part of a larger process of accounting for how and why early Christians came to view Jesus in the ways that they did\\". According to Keith, \\"these two models are methodologically and epistemologically incompatible\\", calling into question the methods and aim of the first model. = Christ myth theorists = Mythicists argue that the accounts of Jesus are mostly, or completely, of a mythical nature, questioning the mainstream paradigm of a historical Jesus in the beginning of the 1st century who was deified. Most mythicists, like mainstream scholarship, note that Christianity developed within Hellenistic Judaism, which was influenced by Hellenism. Early Christianity, and the accounts of Jesus are to be understood in this context. Yet, where contemporary New Testament scholarship has introduced several criteria to evaluate the historicity of New Testament passages and sayings, most Christ myth theorists have relied on comparisons of Christian mythemes with contemporary religious traditions, emphasizing the mythological nature of the Bible accounts. Some moderate authors, most notably Wells, have argued that there may have been a historical Jesus, but that this historical Jesus was fused with another Jesus-tradition, namely the mythological Christ of Paul. Others, most notably the early Wells and Alvar Elleg√•rd, have argued that Paul's Jesus may have lived far earlier, in a dimly remembered remote past. The most radical mythicists hold, in terms given by Price, the \\"Jesus atheism\\" viewpoint, that is, there never was a historical Jesus, only a mythological character, and the mytheme of his incarnation, death, and exaltation. This character developed out of a syncretistic fusion of Jewish, Hellenistic and Middle Eastern religious thought; was put forward by Paul; and historicised in the Gospels, which are also syncretistic. Notable \\"atheists\\" are Paul-Louis Couchoud, Earl Doherty, Thomas L. Brodie, and Richard Carrier. Some other authors argue for the Jesus agnosticism viewpoint. That is, whether there was a historical Jesus is unknowable and if he did exist, close to nothing can be known about him. Notable \\"agnosticists\\" are Robert Price and Thomas L. Thompson. According to Thompson, the question of the historicity of Jesus also is not relevant for the understanding of the meaning and function of the Biblical texts in their own times.  Overview of main mythicist arguments  According to New Testament scholar Robert Van Voorst, most Christ mythicists follow a threefold argument first set forward by German historian Bruno Bauer in the 1800s: they question the reliability of the Pauline epistles and the Gospels to postulate a historically existing Jesus; they note the lack of information on Jesus in non-Christian sources from the first and early second century; and they argue that early Christianity had syncretistic and mythological origins. More specifically, * Paul's epistles lack detailed biographical information ‚Äì most mythicists argue that the Pauline epistles are older than the gospels but, aside from a few passages which may have been interpolations, there is a complete absence of any detailed biographical information such as might be expected if Jesus had been a contemporary of Paul, nor do they cite any sayings from Jesus, the so- called argument from silence. Some mythicists have argued that the Pauline epistles are from a later date than usually assumed, and therefore not a reliable source on the life of Jesus.Price, Robert M. (2012). \\"Ch. 2: By Posthumous Post ¬ß. The historical Paul\\". The Amazing Colossal Apostle: The Search for the Historical Paul. Signature Books. and ASIN B00IB3YSMO. * The Gospels are not historical records, but a fictitious historical narrative ‚Äì mythicists argue that although the Gospels seem to present a historical framework, they are not historical records, but theological writings, myth or legendary fiction resembling the Hero archetype. They impose \\"a fictitious historical narrative\\" on a \\"mythical cosmic savior figure\\", weaving together various pseudo-historical Jesus traditions, though there may have been a real historical person, of whom close to nothing can be known. * There are no independent eyewitness accounts ‚Äì No independent eyewitness accounts survive, in spite of the fact that many authors were writing at that time. Early second-century Roman accounts contain very little evidence and may depend on Christian sources. * Jesus was a mythological being, who was concretized in the Gospels ‚Äì early Christianity was widely diverse and syncretistic, sharing common philosophical and religious ideas with other religions of the time. It arose in the Greco-Roman world of the first and second century AD, synthesizing Greek Stoicism and Neoplatonism with Jewish Old Testament writings and the exegetical methods of Philo, creating the mythological figure of Jesus. Paul refers to Jesus as an exalted being, and is probably writing about either a mythical or supernatural entity, a celestial deity named Jesus. This celestial being is derived from personified aspects of God, notably the personification of Wisdom, or \\"a savior figure patterned after similar figures within ancient mystery religions,\\" which were often (but not always) a dying- and-rising god. While Paul may also contain proto-Gnostic ideas, some mythicists have argued that Paul may refer to a historical person who may have lived in a dim past, long before the beginnings of the Common Era. Mainstream and mythicist views on the arguments  =Lack of detailed biographical information in Pauline epistles= Dating and attribution =Mainstream view= The mainstream view is that the seven undisputed Pauline epistles considered by scholarly consensus to be genuine epistles are generally dated to AD 50‚Äì60 and are the earliest surviving Christian texts that include information about Jesus. Most scholars view the Pauline letters as essential elements in the study of the historical Jesus,Jesus Remembered: Christianity in the Making by James D. G. Dunn (2003) p. 143Jesus Christ in History and Scripture by Edgar V. McKnight 1999 p. 38Victor Furnish in Paul and Jesus edited by Alexander J. M. Wedderburn 2004 (Academic Paperback) pp. 43‚Äì44 and the development of early Christianity. Yet, scholars have also argued that Paul was a \\"mythmaker\\", who gave his own divergent interpretation of the meaning of Jesus, building a bridge between the Jewish and Hellenistic world, thereby creating the faith that became Christianity. =Mythicist view= Mythicists agree on the importance of the Pauline epistles, some agreeing with this early dating, and taking the Pauline epistles as their point of departure from mainstream scholarship. They argue that those letters actually point solely into the direction of a celestial or mythical being, or contain no definitive information on an historical Jesus. Some mythicists, though, have questioned the early dating of the epistles, raising the possibility that they represent a later, more developed strand of early Christian thought. Theologian Willem Christiaan van Manen of the Dutch school of radical criticism noted various anachronisms in the Pauline epistles. Van Manen claimed that they could not have been written in their final form earlier than the 2nd century. He also noted that the Marcionite school was the first to publish the epistles, and that Marcion ( ‚Äì ) used them as justification for his gnostic and docetic views that Jesus' incarnation was not in a physical body. Van Manen also studied Marcion's version of Galatians in contrast to the canonical version, and argued that the canonical version was a later revision which de-emphasized the Gnostic aspects. Price also argues for a later dating of the epistles, and sees them as a compilation of fragments (possibly with a Gnostic core), contending that Marcion was responsible for much of the Pauline corpus or even wrote the letters himself. Price criticizes his fellow Christ myth theorists for holding the mid-first- century dating of the epistles for their own apologetical reasons. Lack of biographical information =Mainstream view= According to Eddy and Boyd, modern biblical scholarship notes that \\"Paul has relatively little to say on the biographical information of Jesus\\", viewing Jesus as \\"a recent contemporary\\". Yet, according to Christopher Tuckett, \\"[e]ven if we had no other sources, we could still infer some things about Jesus from Paul's letters.\\" =Mythicist view= Wells, a \\"minimal mythicist\\", criticized the infrequency of the reference to Jesus in the Pauline letters and has said there is no information in them about Jesus' parents, place of birth, teachings, trial nor crucifixion. Robert Price says that Paul does not refer to Jesus' earthly life, also not when that life might have provided convenient examples and justifications for Paul's teachings. Instead, revelation seems to have been a prominent source for Paul's knowledge about Jesus. Wells says that the Pauline epistles do not make reference to Jesus' sayings, or only in a vague and general sense. According to Wells, as referred to by Price in his own words, the writers of the New Testament \\"must surely have cited them when the same subjects came up in the situations they addressed\\". =The Gospels are not historical records=  Mainstream view  Among contemporary scholars, there is consensus that the gospels are a type of ancient biography,Stanton, G. H. (2004). Jesus and Gospel. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 192.Burridge, R. A. (2006). Gospels. In J. W. Rogerson & Judith M. Lieu (Eds) The Oxford Handbook of Biblical Studies.

Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans. a genre which was concerned with providing examples for readers to emulate while preserving and promoting the subject's reputation and memory, as well as including propaganda and kerygma (preaching) in their works. Biblical scholarship regards the Gospels to be the literary manifestation of oral traditions which originated during the life of a historical Jesus, who according to Dunn had a profound impact on his followers.  Mythicist view  Mythicists argue that in the gospels \\"a fictitious historical narrative\\" was imposed on the \\"mythical cosmic savior figure\\" created by Paul. According to Robert Price, the Gospels \\"smack of fictional composition\\", arguing that the Gospels are a type of legendary fiction and that the story of Jesus portrayed in the Gospels fits the mythic hero archetype. The mythic hero archetype is present in many cultures who often have miraculous conceptions or virgin births heralded by wise men and marked by a star, are tempted by or fight evil forces, die on a hill, appear after death and then ascend to heaven. Some myth proponents suggest that some parts of the New Testament were meant to appeal to Gentiles as familiar allegories rather than history. According to Earl Doherty, the gospels are \\"essentially allegory and fiction\\". According to Wells, a minimally historical Jesus existed, whose teachings were preserved in the Q document. According to Wells, the Gospels weave together two Jesus narratives, namely this Galilean preacher of the Q document, and Paul's mythical Jesus. Doherty disagrees with Wells regarding this teacher of the Q-document, arguing that he was an allegorical character who personified Wisdom and came to be regarded as the founder of the Q-community. According to Doherty, Q's Jesus and Paul's Christ were combined in the Gospel of Mark by a predominantly Gentile community. Mainstream criticism Ehrman notes that the gospels are based on oral sources, which played a decisive role in attracting new converts. Christian theologians have cited the mythic hero archetype as a defense of Christian teaching while completely affirming a historical Jesus.What Is Christianity?: An Introduction to the Christian Religion, by Gail Ramshaw, Fortress Press, 2013. pp. 52‚Äì54God and Caesar: Troeltsch's Social Teaching as Legitimation, by Constance L. Benson, Transaction Publishers. p. 55 Secular academics Kendrick and McFarland have also pointed out that the teachings of Jesus marked \\"a radical departure from all the conventions by which heroes had been defined\\".The Heroic Ideal: Western Archetypes from the Greeks to the Present, by M. Gregory Kendrick, McFarland, 2010. p. 43 =No independent eyewitness accounts= Lack of surviving historic records =Mythicist view= Myth proponents claim there is significance in the lack of surviving historic records about Jesus of Nazareth from any non-Jewish author until the second century,Bart D. Ehrman. Did Jesus Exist?: The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth, HarperCollins, 2012, p. 47 adding that Jesus left no writings or other archaeological evidence.Gerald O'Collins, Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus. 2009, pp. 1‚Äì3 Using the argument from silence, they note that Jewish philosopher Philo of Alexandria did not mention Jesus when he wrote about the cruelty of Pontius Pilate around 40 AD.Peder Borgen, Philo of Alexandria. 1997, p. 14 =Mainstream criticism= Mainstream biblical scholars point out that much of the writings of antiquity have been lost and that there was little written about any Jew or Christian in this period.Timothy Barnes Pagan Perceptions of Christianity\\" in Early Christianity: Origins and Evolution to AD 600. 1991, p. 232 Ehrman points out that we do not have archaeological or textual evidence for the existence of most people in the ancient world, even famous people like Pontius Pilate, whom the myth theorists agree to have existed. Robert Hutchinson notes that this is also true of Josephus, despite the fact that he was \\"a personal favorite of the Roman Emperor Vespasian\\". Hutchinson quotes Ehrman, who notes that Josephus is never mentioned in 1st century Greek and Roman sources, despite being \\"a personal friend of the emperor\\". According to Classical historian and popular author Michael Grant, if the same criterion is applied to others: \\"We can reject the existence of a mass of pagan personages whose reality as historical figures is never questioned.\\" Josephus and Tacitus There are three non-Christian sources which are typically used to study and establish the historicity of Jesus, namely two mentions in Josephus, and one mention in the Roman source Tacitus.The Cambridge Companion to Jesus by Markus N. A. Bockmuehl 2001 pp. 121‚Äì125Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey by Craig L. Blomberg 2009 pp. 431‚Äì436 =Mainstream view= Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, written around 93‚Äì94 AD, includes two references to the biblical Jesus in Books 18 and 20. The general scholarly view is that while the longer passage in book 18, known as the Testimonium Flavianum, is most likely not authentic in its entirety, it originally consisted of an authentic nucleus, which was then subject to Christian interpolation or forgery. According to Josephus scholar Louis H. Feldman, \\"few have doubted the genuineness\\" of Josephus' reference to Jesus in Antiquities 20, 9, 1 (\\"the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James\\") and it is only disputed by a small number of scholars.The new complete works of Josephus by Flavius Josephus, William Whiston, Paul L. Maier pp. 662‚Äì663Josephus XX by Louis H. Feldman 1965, p. 496Flavius Josephus; Maier, Paul L. (December 1995). Josephus, the essential works: a condensation of Jewish antiquities and The Jewish war pp. 284‚Äì285 Myth proponents argue that the Testimonium Flavianum may have been a partial interpolation or forgery by Christian apologist Eusebius in the 4th century or by others.Kenneth A. Olson, Eusebius and the Testimonium Flavianum. The Catholic Biblical Quarterly 61 (2): 305, 1999 Richard Carrier further argues that the original text of Antiquities 20 referred to a brother of the high priest Jesus son of Damneus, named James, and not to Jesus Christ. Carrier further argues that the words \\"the one called Christ\\" likely resulted from the accidental insertion of a marginal note added by some unknown reader. Roman historian Tacitus referred to \\"Christus\\" and his execution by Pontius Pilate in his Annals (written ), book 15, chapter 44P. E. Easterling, E. J. Kenney (general editors), The Cambridge History of Latin Literature, p. 892 (Cambridge University Press, 1982, reprinted 1996). The very negative tone of Tacitus' comments on Christians make most experts believe that the passage is extremely unlikely to have been forged by a Christian scribe. The Tacitus reference is now widely accepted as an independent confirmation of Christ's crucifixion, although some scholars question the historical value of the passage on various grounds. =Mythicist view= Christ myth theory supporters such as G. A. Wells and Carrier contend that sources such as Tacitus and others, which were written decades after the supposed events, include no independent traditions that relate to Jesus, and hence can provide no confirmation of historical facts about him. Other sources =Mainstream view= In Jesus Outside the New Testament (2000), mainstream scholar Van Voorst considers references to Jesus in classical writings, Jewish writings, hypothetical sources of the canonical Gospels, and extant Christian writings outside the New Testament. Van Voorst concludes that non-Christian sources provide \\"a small but certain corroboration of certain New Testament historical traditions on the family background, time of life, ministry, and death of Jesus\\", as well as \\"evidence of the content of Christian preaching that is independent of the New Testament\\", while extra-biblical Christian sources give access to \\"some important information about the earliest traditions on Jesus\\". However, New Testament sources remain central for \\"both the main lines and the details about Jesus' life and teaching\\". =Jesus was a mythical being= Syncretism and diversity =Mainstream view= Most historians agree that Jesus or his followers established a new Jewish sect, one that attracted both Jewish and gentile converts. Out of this Jewish sect developed Early Christianity, which was very diverse, with proto-orthodoxy and \\"heretical\\" views like gnosticism alongside each other, According to New Testament scholar Bart D. Ehrman, a number of early Christianities existed in the first century CE, from which developed various Christian traditions and denominations, including proto-orthodoxy. According to theologian James D. G. Dunn, four types of early Christianity can be discerned: Jewish Christianity, Hellenistic Christianity, Apocalyptic Christianity, and early Catholicism. =Mythicist view= In Christ and the Caesars (1877), philosopher Bruno Bauer suggested that Christianity was a synthesis of the Stoicism of Seneca the Younger, Greek Neoplatonism, and the Jewish theology of Philo as developed by pro-Roman Jews such as Josephus. This new religion was in need of a founder and created its Christ.Moggach, Douglas. The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer. Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 184. *Also see Engels, Frederick. \\"Bruno Bauer and Early Christianity\\", Der Sozialdemokrat, May 1882. In a review of Bauer's work, Robert Price notes that Bauer's basic stance regarding the Stoic tone and the fictional nature of the Gospels are still repeated in contemporary scholarship. Doherty notes that, with the conquests of Alexander the Great, the Greek culture and language spread throughout the eastern Mediterranean world, influencing the already existing cultures there. The Roman conquest of this area added to the cultural diversity, but also to a sense of alienation and pessimism. A rich diversity of religious and philosophical ideas was available and Judaism was held in high regard by non- Jews for its monotheistic ideas and its high moral standards. Yet monotheism was also offered by Greek philosophy, especially Platonism, with its high God and the intermediary Logos. According to Doherty, \\"Out of this rich soil of ideas arose Christianity, a product of both Jewish and Greek philosophy\\", echoing Bruno Bauer, who argued that Christianity was a synthesis of Stoicism, Greek Neoplatonism and Jewish thought. Robert Price notes that Christianity started among Hellenized Jews, who mixed allegorical interpretations of Jewish traditions with Jewish Gnostic, Zoroastrian, and mystery cult elements. Some myth proponents note that some stories in the New Testament seem to try to reinforce Old Testament prophecies and repeat stories about figures like Elijah, Elisha, Moses and Joshua in order to appeal to Jewish converts. Price notes that almost all the Gospel-stories have parallels in Old Testamentical and other traditions, concluding that the Gospels are no independent sources for a historical Jesus, but \\"legend and myth, fiction and redaction\\". According to Doherty, the rapid growth of early Christian communities and the great variety of ideas cannot be explained by a single missionary effort, but points to parallel developments, which arose at various places and competed for support. Paul's arguments against rival apostles also point to this diversity. Doherty further notes that Yeshua (Jesus) is a generic name, meaning \\"Yahweh saves\\" and refers to the concept of divine salvation, which could apply to any kind of saving entity or Wisdom. Paul's Jesus is a celestial being A 3rd-century fragment of Paul's letter to the Romans =Mainstream view= According to mainstream scholarship, Jesus was an eschatological preacher or teacher, who was exaltated after his death. The Pauline letters incorporate creeds, or confessions of faith, that predate Paul, and give essential information on the faith of the early Jerusalem community around James, 'the brother of Jesus'.Paul's Letter to the Romans by Colin G. Kruse (2012) pp. 41‚Äì42.The Blackwell Companion to The New Testament edited by David E. Aune 2010 p. 424.Worship in the Early Church by Ralph P. Martin 1975 pp. 57‚Äì58 These pre-Pauline creeds date to within a few years of Jesus' death and developed within the Christian community in Jerusalem.Creeds of the Churches, Third Edition by John H. Leith (1982) p. 12. The First Epistle to the Corinthians contains one of the earliest Christian creeds expressing belief in the risen Jesus, namely : New Testament scholar James Dunn states that in 1 Corinthians 15:3 Paul \\"recites the foundational belief\\", namely \\"that Christ died\\". According to Dunn, \\"Paul was told about a Jesus who had died two years earlier or so.\\"Jesus Remembered: Christianity in the Making, Volume 1 by James D. G. Dunn (2003) pp. 142‚Äì143. 1 Corinthians 15:11 also refers to others before Paul who preached the creed. According to Hurtado, Jesus' death was interpreted as a redemptive death \\"for our sins,\\" in accordance with God's plan as contained in the Jewish scriptures. The significance lay in \\"the theme of divine necessity and fulfillment of the scriptures,\\" not in the later Pauline emphasis on \\"Jesus' death as a sacrifice or an expiation for our sins.\\" For the early Jewish Christians, \\"the idea that Messiah's death was a necessary redemptive event functioned more as an apologetic explanation for Jesus' crucifixion\\" \\"proving that Jesus' death was no surprise to God.\\" According to Krister Stendahl, the main concern of Paul's writings on Jesus' role, and salvation by faith, is not the individual conscience of human sinners, and their doubts about being chosen by God or not, but the problem of the inclusion of gentile (Greek) Torah observers into God's covenant.Stephen Westerholm (2015), The New Perspective on Paul in Review, Direction, Spring 2015 ¬∑ Vol. 44 No. 1 ¬∑ pp. 4‚Äì15 The appearances of Jesus are often explained as visionary experiences, in which the presence of Jesus was felt. According to Ehrman, the visions of Jesus and the subsequent belief in Jesus' resurrection radically changed the perceptions of his early followers, concluding from his absence that he must have been exalted to heaven, by God himself, exalting him to an unprecedented status and authority. According to Hurtado, the resurrection experiences were religious experiences which \\"seem to have included visions of (and/or ascents to) God's heaven, in which the glorified Christ was seen in an exalted position\\". These visions may mostly have appeared during corporate worship. Johan Leman contends that the communal meals provided a context in which participants entered a state of mind in which the presence of Jesus was felt. The Pauline creeds contain elements of a Christ myth and its cultus, such as the Christ hymn of Philippians 2:6‚Äì11, which portrays Jesus as an incarnated and subsequently exalted heavenly being. Scholars view these as indications that the incarnation and exaltation of Jesus was part of Christian tradition a few years after his death and over a decade before the writing of the Pauline epistles. Recent scholarship places the exaltation and devotion of Christ firmly in a Jewish context. Andrew Chester argues that \\"for Paul, Jesus is clearly a figure of the heavenly world, and thus fits a messianic category already developed within Judaism, where the Messiah is a human or angelic figure belonging ... in the heavenly world, a figure who at the same time has had specific, limited role on earth\\". According to Ehrman, Paul regarded Jesus to be an angel, who was incarnated on earth. According to James Waddell, Paul's conception of Jesus as a heavenly figure was influenced by the Book of Henoch and its conception of the Messiah.James Waddell (2010), The Messiah: A Comparative Study of the Enochic Son of Man and the Pauline KyriosBob Foster, The Messiah (Waddell) =Mythicist views= Christ myth theorists generally reject the idea that Paul's epistles refer to a real person. According to Doherty, the Jesus of Paul was a divine Son of God, existing in a spiritual realm where he was crucified and resurrected. This mythological Jesus was based on exegesis of the Old Testament and mystical visions of a risen Jesus. According to Carrier, the genuine Pauline epistles show that the Apostle Peter and the Apostle Paul believed in a visionary or dream Jesus, based on a pesher of Septuagint verses Zechariah 6 and 3, Daniel 9 and Isaiah 52‚Äì53. Carrier notes that there is little if any concrete information about Christ's earthly life in the Pauline epistles, even though Jesus is mentioned over three hundred times. According to Carrier, originally \\"Jesus was the name of a celestial being, subordinate to God,\\" a \\"dying-and-rising\\" savior God like Mithras and Osiris, who \\"obtain[ed] victory over death\\" in this celestial realm. According to Carrier \\"[t]his 'Jesus' would most likely have been the same archangel identified by Philo of Alexandria as already extant in Jewish theology\\", which Philo knew by all of the attributes Paul also knew Jesus by. According to Carrier, Philo says this being was identified as the figure named Jesus in the Book of Zechariah, implying that \\"already before Christianity there were Jews aware of a celestial being named Jesus who had all of the attributes the earliest Christians were associating with their celestial being named Jesus\\". Raphael Lataster, following Carrier, also argues that \\"Jesus began as a celestial messiah that certain Second Temple Jews already believed in, and was later allegorised in the Gospels.\\"BRILL, summary of Questioning the Historicity of Jesus. =Mainstream criticism= Ehrman notes that Doherty, like many other mythicists, \\"quotes professional scholars at length when their views prove useful for developing aspects of his argument, but he fails to point out that not a single of these scholars agrees with his overarching thesis.\\" Ehrman has specifically criticized Doherty for misquoting scholarly sources as if in support of his celestial being-hypothesis, whereas those sources explicitly \\"[refer] to Christ becoming a human being in flesh on earth ‚Äì precisely the view he rejects.\\"Bart Ehrman (25 april 2012), Fuller Reply to Richard Carrier James McGrath criticizes Carrier, stating that Carrier is ignoring the details, and that \\"Philo is offering an allusive reference to, and allegorical treatment of, a text in Zechariah which mentioned a historical high priest named Joshua.\\"James McGrath (sept. 16, 2012), Further Problematizing Richard Carrier‚Äôs Claims about Jesus According to Hurtado, for Paul and his contemporaries Jesus was a human being, who was exaltated as Messiah and Lord after his crucifixion. According to Hurtado, \\"There is no evidence whatsoever of a 'Jewish archangel Jesus' in any of the second-temple Jewish evidence [...] Instead, all second-temple instances of the name are for historical figures.\\"Larry Hurtado (December 2, 2017 ), Why the ‚ÄúMythical Jesus‚Äù Claim Has No Traction with Scholars Hurtado rejects Carrier's claim that \\"Philo of Alexandria mentions an archangel named 'Jesus'.\\" According to Hurtado, Philo mentions a priestly figure called Joshua, and a royal personage who's name can be interpreted as \\"rising,\\" among other connotations. According to Hurtado, there is no \\"Jesus Rising\\" in either Zechariah nor Philo, stating that Carrier is incorrect.Larry Hurtado (December 7, 2017 ), Gee, Dr. Carrier, You‚Äôre Really Upset!Larry Huratdo (December 11, 2017 ), On Accurate Representation of Texts Ehrman notes that \\"there were no Jews prior to Christianity who thought that Isaiah 53 (or any of the other \\"suffering\\" passages) referred to the future messiah.\\" Only after his painful death were these texts used to interpret his suffering in a meaningful way, though \\"Isaiah is not speaking about the future messiah, and he was never interpreted by any Jews prior to the first century as referring to the messiah.\\" Simon Gathercole at Cambridge also evaluated the mythicist arguments for the claim that Paul believed in a heavenly, celestial Jesus who was never on Earth. Gathercole concludes that Carrier's arguments, and more broadly, the mythicist positions on different aspects of Paul's letters are contradicted by the historical data, and that Paul says a number of things regarding Jesus' life on Earth, his personality, family, etc.Gathercole, Simon. \\"The Historical and Human Existence of Jesus in Paul's Letters\\". Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus 16.2‚Äì3 (2018): 183‚Äì212. Parallels with saviour gods =Mainstream view= Jesus has to be understood in the Palestinian and Jewish context of the first century CE. Most of the themes, epithets, and expectations formulated in the New Testamentical literature have Jewish origins, and are elaborations of these themes. According to Hurtado, Roman-era Judaism refused \\"to worship any deities other than the God of Israel,\\" including \\"any of the adjutants of the biblical God, such as angels, messiahs, etc.\\"Larry Hurtado (29 june, 2019), ‚ÄúHonoring the Son‚Äù: An Entree Work The Jesus-devotion which emerged in early Christianity has to be regarded as a specific, Christian innovation in the Jewish context. =Mythicist view= According to Wells, Doherty, and Carrier, the mythical Jesus was derived from Wisdom traditions, the personification of an eternal aspect of God, who came to visit human beings. Wells \\"regard[s] this Jewish Wisdom literature as of great importance for the earliest Christian ideas about Jesus\\". Doherty notes that the concept of a spiritual Christ was the result of common philosophical and religious ideas of the first and second century AD, in which the idea of an intermediary force between God and the world were common. According to Doherty, the Christ of Paul shares similarities with the Greco-Roman mystery cults. Authors Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy explicitly argue that Jesus was a deity, akin to the mystery cults, while Dorothy Murdock argues that the Christ myth draws heavily on the Egyptian story of Osiris and Horus. According to Carrier, early Christianity was but one of several mystery cults which developed out of Hellenistic influences on local cults and religions. Wells and Alvar Elleg√•rd, have argued that Paul's Jesus may have lived far earlier, in a dimly remembered remote past. Wells argues that Paul and the other epistle writers‚Äîthe earliest Christian writers‚Äîdo not provide any support for the idea that Jesus lived early in the 1st century and that‚Äîfor Paul‚ÄîJesus may have existed many decades, if not centuries, before.Can We Trust the New Testament? by George Albert Wells 2003 pp. 49‚Äì50Martin, Michael. The Case Against Christianity. Temple University Press, 1993, p. 38. According to Wells, the earliest strata of the New Testament literature presented Jesus as \\"a basically supernatural personage only obscurely on Earth as a man at some unspecified period in the past\\". According to Price, the Toledot Yeshu places Jesus \\"about 100 BCE\\", while Epiphanius of Salamis and the Talmud make references to \\"Jewish and Jewish-Christian belief\\" that Jesus lived about a century earlier than usually assumed. According to Price, this implies that \\"perhaps the Jesus figure was at first an ahistorical myth and various attempts were made to place him in a plausible historical context, just as Herodotus and others tried to figure out when Hercules 'must have' lived\\". =Mainstream criticism= Mainstream scholarship disagrees with these interpretations, and regards them as outdated applications of ideas and methodologies from the Religionsgeschichtliche Schule. According to Philip Davies, the Jesus of the New Testament is indeed \\"composed of stock motifs (and mythic types) drawn from all over the Mediterranean and Near Eastern world\\". Yet, this does not mean that Jesus was \\"invented\\"; according to Davies, \\"the existence of a guru of some kind is more plausible and economical than any other explanation\\". Ehrman states that mythicists make too much of the perceived parallels with pagan religions and mythologies. According to Ehrman, critical-historical research has clearly shown the Jewish roots and influences of Christianity. Many mainstream biblical scholars respond that most of the perceived parallels with mystery religions are either coincidences or without historical basis and/or that these parallels do not prove that a Jesus figure did not live. Boyd and Eddy doubt that Paul viewed Jesus similar to the savior deities found in ancient mystery religions. Ehrman notes that Doherty proposes that the mystery cults had a neo-Platonic cosmology, but that Doherty gives no evidence for this assertion. Furthermore, \\"the mystery cults are never mentioned by Paul or by any other Christian author of the first hundred years of the Church,\\" nor did they play a role in the worldview of any of the Jewish groups of the first century. Theologian Gregory A. Boyd and Paul Rhodes Eddy, Professor of Biblical and Theological Studies at Bethel University, criticise the idea that \\"Paul viewed Jesus as a cosmic savior who lived in the past\\", referring to various passages in the Pauline epistles which seem to contradict this idea. In Galatians 1:19, Paul says he met with James, the \\"Lord's brother\\"; 1 Corinthians 15:3‚Äì8 refers to people to whom Jesus' had appeared, and who were Paul's contemporaries; and in 1 Thessalonians 2:14‚Äì16 Paul refers to the Jews \\"who both killed the Lord Jesus\\" and \\"drove out us\\" as the same people, indicating that the death of Jesus was within the same time frame as the persecution of Paul.  Late 18th to early 20th century  Constantin-Fran√ßois Volney, one of the earliest myth theorists According to Van Voorst, \\"The argument that Jesus never existed, but was invented by the Christian movement around the year 100, goes back to Enlightenment times, when the historical-critical study of the past was born\\", and may have originated with Lord Bolingbroke, an English deist. According to Weaver and Schneider, the beginnings of the formal denial of the existence of Jesus can be traced to late 18th-century France with the works of Constantin Fran√ßois Chasseb≈ìuf de Volney and Charles-Fran√ßois Dupuis. Volney and Dupuis argued that Christianity was an amalgamation of various ancient mythologies and that Jesus was a totally mythical character. Dupuis argued that ancient rituals in Syria, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, and India had influenced the Christian story which was allegorized as the histories of solar deities, such as Sol Invictus. Dupuis also said that the resurrection of Jesus was an allegory for the growth of the sun's strength in the sign of Aries at the spring equinox. Volney argued that Abraham and Sarah were derived from Brahma and his wife Saraswati, whereas Christ was related to Krishna.British Romantic Writers and the East by Nigel Leask (2004) Cambridge Univ Press pp. 104‚Äì105 Volney made use of a draft version of Dupuis' work and at times differed from him, e.g. in arguing that the gospel stories were not intentionally created, but were compiled organically. Volney's perspective became associated with the ideas of the French Revolution, which hindered the acceptance of these views in England. Despite this, his work gathered significant following among British and American radical thinkers during the 19th century. German Professor David Strauss In 1835, German theologian David Friedrich Strauss published his extremely controversial The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined (Das Leben Jesu). While not denying that Jesus existed, he did argue that the miracles in the New Testament were mythical additions with little basis in actual fact.David Friedrich Strauss (2010), The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined, pp. 39‚Äì43, 87‚Äì91James A. Herrick (2003), The Making of the New Spirituality, pp. 58‚Äì65Michael J. McClymond (2004), Familiar Stranger: An Introduction to Jesus of Nazareth, p. 82 According to Strauss, the early church developed these stories in order to present Jesus as the Messiah of the Jewish prophecies. This perspective was in opposition to the prevailing views of Strauss' time: rationalism, which explained the miracles as misinterpretations of non-supernatural events, and the supernaturalist view that the biblical accounts were entirely accurate. Strauss's third way, in which the miracles are explained as myths developed by early Christians to support their evolving conception of Jesus, heralded a new epoch in the textual and historical treatment of the rise of Christianity. German Professor Bruno Bauer German Bruno Bauer, who taught at the University of Bonn, took Strauss' arguments further and became the first author to systematically argue that Jesus did not exist.Beilby, James K. and Eddy, Paul Rhodes. \\"The Quest for the Historical Jesus\\", in James K. Beilby and Paul Rhodes Eddy (eds.). The Historical Jesus: Five Views. Intervarsity, 2009, p. 16. * See Strauss, David. \\"The Life of Jesus Critically Examined, Calvin Blanchard, 1860. Beginning in 1841 with his Criticism of the Gospel History of the Synoptics, Bauer argued that Jesus was primarily a literary figure, but left open the question of whether a historical Jesus existed at all. Then in his Criticism of the Pauline Epistles (1850‚Äì1852) and in A Critique of the Gospels and a History of their Origin (1850‚Äì1851), Bauer argued that Jesus had not existed. Bauer's work was heavily criticized at the time, as in 1839 he was removed from his position at the University of Bonn and his work did not have much impact on future myth theorists. In his two-volume, 867-page book Anacalypsis (1836), English gentleman Godfrey Higgins said that \\"the mythos of the Hindus, the mythos of the Jews and the mythos of the Greeks are all at bottom the same; and are contrivances under the appearance of histories to perpetuate doctrines\\" and that Christian editors \\"either from roguery or folly, corrupted them all\\". In his 1875 book The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors, American Kersey Graves said that many demigods from different countries shared similar stories, traits or quotes as Jesus and he used Higgins as the main source for his arguments. The validity of the claims in the book have been greatly criticized by Christ myth proponents like Richard Carrier and largely dismissed by biblical scholars.\\"Kersey Graves and The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors\\" by Richard Carrier (2003) Starting in the 1870s, English poet and author Gerald Massey became interested in Egyptology and reportedly taught himself Egyptian hieroglyphics at the British Museum. In 1883, Massey published The Natural Genesis where he asserted parallels between Jesus and the Egyptian god Horus. His other major work, Ancient Egypt: The Light of the World, was published shortly before his death in 1907. His assertions have influenced various later writers such as Alvin Boyd Kuhn and Tom Harpur. In the 1870s and 1880s, a group of scholars associated with the University of Amsterdam, known in German scholarship as the Radical Dutch school, rejected the authenticity of the Pauline epistles and took a generally negative view of the Bible's historical value. Abraham Dirk Loman argued in 1881 that all New Testament writings belonged to the 2nd century and doubted that Jesus was a historical figure, but later said the core of the gospels was genuine. Additional early Christ myth proponents included Swiss skeptic Rudolf Steck,Arthur Drew, 1926, The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus in Past and Present English historian Edwin Johnson, English radical Reverend Robert Taylor and his associate Richard Carlile. During the early 20th century, several writers published arguments against Jesus' historicity, often drawing on the work of liberal theologians, who tended to deny any value to sources for Jesus outside the New Testament and limited their attention to Mark and the hypothetical Q source. They also made use of the growing field of religious history which found sources for Christian ideas in Greek and Oriental mystery cults, rather than Judaism. The work of social anthropologist Sir James George Frazer has had an influence on various myth theorists, although Frazer himself believed that Jesus existed. In 1890, Frazer published the first edition of The Golden Bough which attempted to define the shared elements of religious belief. This work became the basis of many later authors who argued that the story of Jesus was a fiction created by Christians. After a number of people claimed that he was a myth theorist, in the 1913 expanded edition of The Golden Bough he expressly stated that his theory assumed a historical Jesus. In 1900, Scottish Member of Parliament John Mackinnon Robertson argued that Jesus never existed, but was an invention by a first- century messianic cult of Joshua, whom he identifies as a solar deity. The English school master George Robert Stowe Mead argued in 1903 that Jesus had existed, but that he had lived in 100 BC.G. R. S. Mead and the Gnostic Quest by Clare Goodrick-Clarke (2005) pp. 1‚Äì3 Mead based his argument on the Talmud, which pointed to Jesus being crucified . In Mead's view, this would mean that the Christian gospels are mythical.Did Jesus Live 100 B.C.? by G. R. S. Mead (1903) (Cosimo Classics 2005) pp. 10‚Äì12 In 1909, school teacher John Eleazer Remsburg published The Christ, which made a distinction between a possible historical Jesus (Jesus of Nazareth) and the Jesus of the Gospels (Jesus of Bethlehem). Remsburg thought that there was good reason to believe that the historical Jesus existed, but that the \\"Christ of Christianity\\" was a mythological creation.The Christ by John Remsburg 1909, Chapter 1: \\"Christ's Real Existence Impossible\\" Remsburg compiled a list of 42 names of \\"writers who lived and wrote during the time, or within a century after the time\\" who Remsburg felt should have written about Jesus if the Gospels account was reasonably accurate, but who did not.The Christ Myth by John Remsburg 1909, Chapter 2: \\"Silence of Contemporary Writers\\" German Professor Arthur Drews Also in 1909, German philosophy Professor Christian Heinrich Arthur Drews wrote The Christ Myth to argue that Christianity had been a Jewish Gnostic cult that spread by appropriating aspects of Greek philosophy and life-death- rebirth deities.Drews' book was reviewed by A. Kampmeier in The Monist, volume 21, Number 3 (July 1911), pp. 412‚Äì432. In his later books The Witnesses to the Historicity of Jesus (1912) and The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus in Past and Present (1926), Drews reviewed the biblical scholarship of his time as well as the work of other myth theorists, attempting to show that everything reported about the historical Jesus had a mythical character.  Revival (1970s‚Äìpresent) Beginning in the 1970s, in the aftermath of the second quest for the historical Jesus, interest in the Christ myth theory was revived by George Albert Wells, whose ideas were elaborated by Earl Doherty. With the rise of the internet in the 1990s, their ideas gained popular interest, giving way to a multitude of publications and websites aimed at a popular audience, most notably Richard Carrier, often taking a polemical stance toward Christianity. Their ideas are supported by Robert Price, an academic theologian, while somewhat different stances on the mythological origins are offered by Thomas L. Thompson and Thomas L. Brodie, both also accomplished scholars in theology. =Revival of the Christ myth theory=  Paul-Louis Couchoud  The French philosopher Paul-Louis Couchoud, published in the 1920s and 1930s, was a predecessor for contemporary mythicists. According to Couchoud, Christianity started not with a biography of Jesus but \\"a collective mystical experience, sustaining a divine history mystically revealed\\". Couchaud's Jesus is not a \\"myth\\", but a \\"religious conception\\".Hibbert Journal Volume 37 (1938‚Äì39), pp. 193‚Äì214 Robert Price mentions Couchoud's comment on the Christ Hymn, one of the relics of the Christ cults to which Paul converted. Couchoud noted that in this hymn the name Jesus was given to the Christ after his torturous death, implying that there cannot have been a ministry by a teacher called Jesus.  George Albert Wells  George Albert Wells (1926‚Äì2017), a professor of German, revived the interest in the Christ myth theory. In his early work,, , including Did Jesus Exist? (1975), Wells argued that because the Gospels were written decades after Jesus's death by Christians who were theologically motivated but had no personal knowledge of him, a rational person should believe the gospels only if they are independently confirmed. In The Jesus Myth (1999) and later works, Wells argues that two Jesus narratives fused into one, namely Paul's mythical Jesus, and a minimally historical Jesus from a Galilean preaching tradition, whose teachings were preserved in the Q document, a hypothetical common source for the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. According to Wells, both figures owe much of their substance to ideas from the Jewish wisdom literature. In 2000 Van Voorst gave an overview of proponents of the \\"Nonexistence Hypothesis\\" and their arguments, presenting eight arguments against this hypothesis as put forward by Wells and his predecessors. According to Maurice Casey, Wells' work repeated the main points of the Religionsgeschichtliche Schule, which are deemed outdated by mainstream scholarship. His works were not discussed by New Testament scholars, because it was \\"not considered to be original, and all his main points were thought to have been refuted long time ago, for reasons which were very well known\\". In his later writings, G.A Wells changed his mind and came to view Jesus as a minimally historical figure. Earl Doherty Canadian writer Earl Doherty (born 1941) was introduced to the Christ myth theme by a lecture by Wells in the 1970s. Doherty follows the lead of Wells, but disagrees on the historicity of Jesus, arguing that \\"everything in Paul points to a belief in an entirely divine Son who 'lived' and acted in the spiritual realm, in the same mythical setting in which all the other savior deities of the day were seen to operate\\". According to Doherty, Paul's Christ originated as a myth derived from middle Platonism with some influence from Jewish mysticism and belief in a historical Jesus emerged only among Christian communities in the 2nd century. Doherty agrees with Bauckham that the earliest Christology was already a \\"high Christology\\", that is, Jesus was an incarnation of the pre- existent Christ, but deems it \\"hardly credible\\" that such a belief could develop in such a short time among Jews.Doherty (2009). Jesus: Neither God Nor Man ‚Äì The Case for a Mythical Jesus. Ottawa: Age of Reason Publications. p. 716, n. 12. Therefore, Doherty concludes that Christianity started with the myth of this incarnated Christ, who was subsequently historicised. According to Doherty, the nucleus of this historicised Jesus of the Gospels can be found in the Jesus-movement which wrote the Q source. Eventually, Q's Jesus and Paul's Christ were combined in the Gospel of Mark by a predominantly gentile community. In time, the gospel-narrative of this embodiment of Wisdom became interpreted as the literal history of the life of Jesus. Eddy and Boyd characterize Doherty's work as appealing to the \\"History of Religions School\\". In a book criticizing the Christ myth theory, New Testament scholar Maurice Casey describes Doherty as \\"perhaps the most influential of all the mythicists\\", but one who is unable to understand the ancient texts he uses in his arguments. Richard Carrier Richard Carrier American independent scholar Richard Carrier (born 1969) reviewed Doherty's work on the origination of Jesus and eventually concluded that the evidence favored the core of Doherty's thesis. According to Carrier, following Couchoud and Doherty, Christianity started with the belief in a new deity called Jesus, \\"a spiritual, mythical figure\\". According to Carrier, this new deity was fleshed out in the Gospels, which added a narrative framework and Cynic-like teachings, and eventually came to be perceived as a historical biography. Carrier argues in his book On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt that the Jesus figure was probably originally known only through private revelations and hidden messages in scripture which were then crafted into a historical figure to communicate the claims of the gospels allegorically. These allegories then started to be believed as fact during the struggle for control of the Christian churches of the first century. =Theologians= Robert M. Price American New Testament scholar Robert M. Price American New Testament scholar and former Baptist pastor Robert M. Price (born 1954) has questioned the historicity of Jesus in a series of books, including Deconstructing Jesus (2000), The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man (2003), Jesus Is Dead (2007) and The Christ-Myth Theory and Its Problems (2011). Price uses critical-historical methods, but also uses \\"history-of-religions parallel[s]\\", or the \\"Principle of Analogy\\", to show similarities between Gospel narratives and non-Christian Middle Eastern myths. Price criticises some of the criteria of critical Bible research, such as the criterion of dissimilarity and the criterion of embarrassment. Price further notes that \\"consensus is no criterion\\" for the historicity of Jesus. According to Price, if critical methodology is applied with ruthless consistency, one is left in complete agnosticism regarding Jesus's historicity. In Deconstructing Jesus, Price claims that \\"the Jesus Christ of the New Testament is a composite figure\\", out of which a broad variety of historical Jesuses can be reconstructed, any one of which may have been the real Jesus, but not all of them together. According to Price, various Jesus images flowed together at the origin of Christianity, some of them possibly based on myth, some of them possibly based on \\"a historical Jesus the Nazorean\\". Price admits uncertainty in this regard, writing in conclusion: \\"There may have been a real figure there, but there is simply no longer any way of being sure\\". In contributions to The Historical Jesus: Five Views (2009), he acknowledges that he stands against the majority view of scholars, but cautions against attempting to settle the issue by appeal to the majority.  Thomas L. Thompson  Thomas L. Thompson (born 1939), Professor emeritus of theology at the University of Copenhagen, is a leading biblical minimalist of the Old Testament, and supports a mythicist position, according to Ehrman and Casey. According to Thompson, \\"questions of understanding and interpreting biblical texts\\" are more relevant than \\"questions about the historical existence of individuals such as ... Jesus\\". In his 2007 book The Messiah Myth: The Near Eastern Roots of Jesus and David, Thompson argues that the Biblical accounts of both King David and Jesus of Nazareth are not historical accounts, but are mythical in nature and based on Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Babylonian and Greek and Roman literature. Those accounts are based on the Messiah mytheme, a king anointed by God to restore the Divine order at Earth. Thompson also argues that the resurrection of Jesus is taken directly from the story of the dying and rising god, Dionysus. Thompson does not draw a final conclusion on the historicity or ahistoricity of Jesus, but states that \\"A negative statement, however, that such a figure did not exist, cannot be reached: only that we have no warrant for making such a figure part of our history.\\" Thompson coedited the contributions from a diverse range of scholars in the 2012 book Is This Not the Carpenter?: The Question of the Historicity of the Figure of Jesus. Writing in the introduction, \\"The essays collected in this volume have a modest purpose. Neither establishing the historicity of a historical Jesus nor possessing an adequate warrant for dismissing it, our purpose is to clarify our engagement with critical historical and exegetical methods.\\" Ehrman has criticised Thompson, questioning his qualifications and expertise regarding New Testament research. In a 2012 online article, Thompson defended his qualifications to address New Testament issues, and objected to Ehrman's statement that \\"[a] different sort of support for a mythicist position comes in the work of Thomas L. Thompson.\\" According to Thompson, \\"Bart Ehrman has attributed to my book arguments and principles which I had never presented, certainly not that Jesus had never existed\\", and reiterated his position that the issue of Jesus' existence cannot be determined one way or the other. Thompson further states that Jesus is not to be regarded as \\"the notoriously stereotypical figure of ... (mistaken) eschatological prophet\\", as Ehrman does, but is modelled on \\"the royal figure of a conquering messiah\\", derived from Jewish writings.  Thomas L. Brodie  In 2012, the Irish Dominican priest and theologian Thomas L. Brodie (born 1943), holding a PhD from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome and a co-founder and former director of the Dominican Biblical Institute in Limerick, published Beyond the Quest for the Historical Jesus: Memoir of a Discovery. In this book, Brodie, who previously had published academic works on the Hebrew prophets, argued that the Gospels are essentially a rewriting of the stories of Elijah and Elisha when viewed as a unified account in the Books of Kings. This view lead Brodie to the conclusion that Jesus is mythical. Brodie's argument builds on his previous work, in which he stated that rather than being separate and fragmented, the stories of Elijah and Elisha are united and that 1 Kings 16:29 ‚Äì 2 Kings 13:25 is a natural extension of 1 Kings 17 ‚Äì 2 Kings 8 which have a coherence not generally observed by other biblical scholars. Brodie then views the Elijah‚ÄìElisha story as the underlying model for the gospel narratives. In response to Brodie's publication of his view that Jesus was mythical, the Dominican order banned him from writing and lecturing, although he was allowed to stay on as a brother of the Irish Province, which continued to care for him. \\"There is an unjustifiable jump between methodology and conclusion\\" in Brodie's book‚Äîaccording to Gerard Norton‚Äîand \\"are not soundly based on scholarship\\". According to Norton, they are \\"a memoir of a series of significant moments or events\\" in Brodie's life that reinforced \\"his core conviction\\" that neither Jesus nor Paul of Tarsus were historical. = Other modern proponents = British academic John M. Allegro In his books The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross (1970) and The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth (1979), the British archaeologist and philologist John M. Allegro advanced the theory that stories of early Christianity originated in a shamanistic Essene clandestine cult centered around the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms.The Essenes, the Scrolls, and the Dead Sea by Joan E. Taylor (2012) Oxford University Press p. 305 He also argued that the story of Jesus was based on the crucifixion of the Teacher of Righteousness in the Dead Sea Scrolls.Hall, Mark. Foreword to Allegro, John M. The Dead Sea Scrolls & the Christian Myth. Prometheus 1992, first published 1979, p. ix. Allegro's theory was criticised sharply by Welsh historian Philip Jenkins, who wrote that Allegro relied on texts that did not exist in quite the form he was citing them.Jenkins, Philip. Hidden Gospels. Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 180. Based on this and many other negative reactions to the book, Allegro's publisher later apologized for issuing the book and Allegro was forced to resign his academic post.The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls by Peter Flint and James VanderKam (2005) T&T; Clark pages 323‚Äì325A History of the Middle East by Saul S. Friedman (2006) p. 82 Alvar Elleg√•rd, in The Myth of Jesus (1992), and Jesus: One Hundred Years Before Christ. A Study in Creative Mythology (1999), argued that Jesus lived 100 years before the accepted dates, and was a teacher of the Essenes. According to Elleg√•rd, Paul was connected with the Essenes, and had a vision of this Jesus. Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy, in their 1999 publication The Jesus Mysteries: Was the \\"Original Jesus\\" a Pagan God? propose that Jesus did not literally exist as an historically identifiable individual, but was instead a syncretic re- interpretation of the fundamental pagan \\"godman\\" by the Gnostics, who were the original sect of Christianity. The book has been negatively received by scholars, and also by Christ mythicists.Bart Ehrman, interview with David V. Barrett, \\"The Gospel According to Bart\\", Fortean Times (221), 2007 Canadian author Tom Harpur (photo by Hugh Wesley) Influenced by Massey and Higgins, Alvin Boyd Kuhn (1880‚Äì1963), an American Theosophist, argued an Egyptian etymology to the Bible that the gospels were symbolic rather than historic and that church leaders started to misinterpret the New Testament in the third century.\\"Alvin Boyd Kuhn, Ph.D. A Biographical Sketch of his life and work\\", by Richard Alvin Sattelberg, B.A., M.S.., 2005 Building on Kuhn's work, author and ordained priest Tom Harpur in his 2004 book The Pagan Christ listed similarities among the stories of Jesus, Horus, Mithras, Buddha and others. According to Harpur, in the second or third centuries the early church created the fictional impression of a literal and historic Jesus and then used forgery and violence to cover up the evidence. In his 2017 book D√©cadence, French writer and philosopher Michel Onfray argued for the Christ myth theory and based his hypothesis on the fact that‚Äîother than in the New Testament‚ÄîJesus is barely mentioned in accounts of the period. The Christ myth theory enjoyed brief popularity in the Soviet Union, where it was supported by Sergey Kovalev, Alexander Kazhdan, Abram Ranovich, Nikolai Rumyantsev and Robert Vipper. However, several scholars, including Kazhdan, later retracted their views about mythical Jesus and by the end of the 1980s Iosif Kryvelev remained as virtually the only proponent of Christ myth theory in Soviet academia. Reception = Scholarly reception = Lack of support for mythicism In modern scholarship, the Christ myth theory is a fringe theory, which finds virtually no support from scholars, to the point of being addressed in footnotes or almost completely ignored due to the obvious weaknesses they espouse. However, more attention has been given to mythicism in recent years due to it recurring when people ask scholars like Bart Ehrman about it. According to him, nearly all scholars who study the early Christian period believe that he did exist and Ehrman observes that mythicist writings are generally of poor quality because they are usually authored by amateurs and non-scholars who have no academic credentials or have never taught at academic institutions. Maurice Casey, theologian and scholar of New Testament and early Christianity, stated that the belief among professors that Jesus existed is generally completely certain. According to Casey, the view that Jesus did not exist is \\"the view of extremists\\", \\"demonstrably false\\" and \\"professional scholars generally regard it as having been settled in serious scholarship long ago\\".Casey, Maurice, Jesus of Nazareth: An Independent Historian's Account of His Life and Teaching (T&T; Clark, 2010), pp. 33, 104, 499. In 1977, classical historian and popular author Michael Grant in his book Jesus: An Historian's Review of the Gospels, concluded that \\"modern critical methods fail to support the Christ-myth theory\\".Michael Grant (1977), Jesus: An Historian's Review of the Gospels. Charles Scribner's Sons, p. 200. In support of this, Grant quoted Roderic Dunkerley's 1957 opinion that the Christ myth theory has \\"again and again been answered and annihilated by first-rank scholars\\".Dunkerley, Roderic, Beyond the Gospels (Penguin Books, 1957) p. 12. At the same time, he also quoted Otto Betz's 1968 opinion that in recent years \\"no serious scholar has ventured to postulate the non-historicity of Jesus‚Äîor at any rate very few, and they have not succeeded in disposing of the much stronger, indeed very abundant, evidence to the contrary\\".Betz, Otto, What Do We Know About Jesus? (SCM-Canterbury Press, 1968) p. 9. In the same book, he also wrote: Graeme Clarke, Emeritus Professor of Classical Ancient History and Archaeology at Australian National University stated in 2008: \\"Frankly, I know of no ancient historian or biblical historian who would have a twinge of doubt about the existence of a Jesus Christ‚Äîthe documentary evidence is simply overwhelming\\". R. Joseph Hoffmann, who had created the Jesus Project, which included both mythicists and historicists to investigate the historicity of Jesus, wrote that an adherent to the Christ myth theory asked to set up a separate section of the project for those committed to the theory. Hoffmann felt that to be committed to mythicism signaled a lack of necessary skepticism and he noted that most members of the project did not reach the mythicist conclusion.Hoffmann, R. Joseph. \\"Threnody: Rethinking the Thinking behind The Jesus Project\\", bibleinterp.com, October 2009, accessed August 6, 2010. Philip Jenkins, Distinguished Professor of History at Baylor University, has written \\"What you can‚Äôt do, though, without venturing into the far swamps of extreme crankery, is to argue that Jesus never existed. The ‚ÄúChrist-Myth Hypothesis‚Äù is not scholarship, and is not taken seriously in respectable academic debate. The grounds advanced for the ‚Äúhypothesis‚Äù are worthless. The authors proposing such opinions might be competent, decent, honest individuals, but the views they present are demonstrably wrong....Jesus is better documented and recorded than pretty much any non-elite figure of antiquity.\\" According to Gullotta, most of the mythicist literature contains \\"wild theories, which are poorly researched, historically inaccurate, and written with a sensationalist bent for popular audiences.\\" Questioning the competence of proponents Critics of the Christ myth theory question the competence of its supporters. According to Ehrman: Maurice Casey has criticized the mythicists, pointing out their complete ignorance of how modern critical scholarship actually works. He also criticizes mythicists for their frequent assumption that all modern scholars of religion are Protestant fundamentalists of the American variety, insisting that this assumption is not only totally inaccurate, but also exemplary of the mythicists' misconceptions about the ideas and attitudes of mainstream scholars. Questioning the mainstream view appears to have consequences for one's job perspectives.Thomas Verenna, Goodbye for now? According to Casey, Thompson's early work, which \\"successfully refuted the attempts of Albright and others to defend the historicity of the most ancient parts of biblical literature history\\", has \\"negatively affected his future job prospects\\". Ehrman also notes that mythicist views would prevent one from getting employment in a religious studies department: Other criticisms Robert Van Voorst has written \\"Contemporary New Testament scholars have typically viewed (Christ myth) arguments as so weak or bizarre that they relegate them to footnotes, or often ignore them completely [...] The theory of Jesus' nonexistence is now effectively dead as a scholarly question.\\" Paul L. Maier, former Professor of Ancient History at Western Michigan University and current professor emeritus in the Department of History there has stated \\"Anyone who uses the argument that Jesus never existed is simply flaunting his ignorance.\\" Among notable scholars who have directly addressed the Christ myth are Bart Ehrman, Maurice Casey and Philip Jenkins. In 2000 Van Voorst gave an overview of proponents of the \\"Nonexistence Hypothesis\\" and their arguments, presenting eight arguments against this hypothesis as put forward by Wells and his predecessors. # The \\"argument of silence\\" is to be rejected, because \\"it is wrong to suppose that what is unmentioned or undetailed did not exist.\\" Van Voorst further argues that the early Christian literature was not written for historical purposes. # Dating the \\"invention\\" of Jesus around 100 CE is too late; Mark was written earlier, and contains abundant historical details which are correct. # The argument that the development of the Gospel traditions shows that there was no historical Jesus is incorrect; \\"development does not prove wholesale invention, and difficulties do not prove invention.\\" # Wells cannot explain why \\"no pagans and Jews who opposed Christianity denied Jesus' historicity or even questioned it.\\" # The rejection of Tacitus and Josephus ignores the scholarly consensus. # Proponents of the \\"Nonexistence Hypothesis\\" are not driven by scholarly interests, but by anti-Christian sentiments. # Wells and others do not offer alternative \\"other, credible hypotheses\\" for the origins of Christianity. # Wells himself accepted the existence of a minimal historical Jesus, thereby effectively leaving the \\"Nonexistence Hypothesis.\\" In his book Did Jesus Exist?, Bart Ehrman surveys the arguments \\"mythicists\\" have made against the existence of Jesus since the idea was first mooted at the end of the 18th century. As for the lack of contemporaneous records for Jesus, Ehrman notes no comparable Jewish figure is mentioned in contemporary records either and there are mentions of Christ in several Roman works of history from only decades after the death of Jesus. The author states that the authentic letters of the apostle Paul in the New Testament were likely written within a few years of Jesus' death and that Paul likely personally knew James, the brother of Jesus. Although the gospel accounts of Jesus' life may be biased and unreliable in many respects, Ehrman writes, they and the sources behind them which scholars have discerned still contain some accurate historical information. So many independent attestations of Jesus' existence, Ehrman says, are actually \\"astounding for an ancient figure of any kind\\". Ehrman dismisses the idea that the story of Jesus is an invention based on pagan myths of dying-and-rising gods, maintaining that the early Christians were primarily influenced by Jewish ideas, not Greek or Roman ones, and repeatedly insisting that the idea that there was never such a person as Jesus is not seriously considered by historians or experts in the field at all. Alexander Lucie-Smith, Catholic priest and doctor of moral theology, states that \\"People who think Jesus didn‚Äôt exist are seriously confused,\\" but also notes that \\"the Church needs to reflect on its failure. If 40 per cent believe in the Jesus myth, this is a sign that the Church has failed to communicate with the general public.\\"Fr Alexander Lucie-Smith, People who think Jesus didn‚Äôt exist are seriously confused, Catholic Herald Stanley E. Porter, president and dean of McMaster Divinity College in Hamilton, and Stephen J. Bedard, a Baptist minister and graduate of McMaster Divinity, respond to Harpur's ideas from an evangelical standpoint in Unmasking the Pagan Christ: An Evangelical Response to the Cosmic Christ Idea, challenging the key ideas lying at the foundation of Harpur's thesis. Porter and Bedard conclude that there is sufficient evidence for the historicity of Jesus and assert that Harpur is motivated to promote \\"universalistic spirituality\\". = Popular reception = In a 2015 poll conducted by the Church of England, 40% of respondents indicated that they did not believe Jesus was a real person. Ehrman notes that \\"the mythicists have become loud, and thanks to the Internet they've attracted more attention\\". Within a few years of the inception of the World Wide Web (c. 1990), mythicists such as Earl Doherty began to present their argument to a larger public via the internet. Doherty created the website The Jesus Puzzle in 1996, while the organization Internet Infidels has featured the works of mythicists on their website and mythicism has been mentioned on several popular news sites. According to Derek Murphy, the documentaries The God Who Wasn't There (2005) and Zeitgeist (2007) raised interest for the Christ myth theory with a larger audience and gave the topic a large coverage on the Internet. Daniel Gullotta notes the relationship between the organization \\"Atheists United\\" and Carrier's work related to Mythicism, which has increased \\"the attention of the public\\". According to Ehrman, mythicism has a growing appeal \\"because these deniers of Jesus are at the same time denouncers of religion\\". According to Casey, mythicism has a growing appeal because of an aversion toward Christian fundamentalism among American atheists.  Documentaries  Since 2005, several English-language documentaries have focused‚Äîat least in part‚Äîon the Christ myth theory: * The God Who Wasn't There directed by Brian Flemming and featuring Richard Carrier and Robert M. Price (2005) * The Pagan Christ produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and featuring Tom Harpur (2007) * Zeitgeist: The Movie directed by Peter Joseph (2007) * The Hidden Story of Jesus produced by Channel 4 and featuring Robert Beckford (2007) * Religulous directed by Larry Charles and featuring Bill Maher (2008) * Caesar's Messiah by Joseph Atwill (2013)  See also   Notes  Quotes  References   Sources  =Printed sources=  Bader, Christopher, et al.

PULHHEEMS is tri-service, which is to say that it is used by the British Army, the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. Its purpose is to determine the suitability of its employees for posting into military zones. It is not a fitness test as such; rather, it is a test of suitability for purpose. The PULHHEEMS system, or variations of it, is also used by several members of the British Commonwealth, including Singapore, Canada, Australia , Sri Lanka and New Zealand. The USA uses a system called PULHES. In civilian life there is a similar system called PULSES which is used to grade levels of disability; it differs from the PULHHEEMS in that it also examines the digestive system, something which the PULHHEEMS does not. Usage For new recruits it is part of the first step into the armed forces, whilst for established service people it is a requirement of ongoing employment. Although a PULHHEEMS is carried out on new recruits, it is not itself an entrance examination, the attributes of which depend on the unit conducting the examination. The examination is carried out on recruits, and five-yearly after a serviceman or woman reaches the age of 30. After the age of 50, people in service are examined every two years. All Generals of any persuasion must be examined yearly. Furthermore, service personnel under the age of 30 are required to undergo a PULHHEEMS in order to attend certain courses, whether occupational or promotional, and also if medically downgraded. A PULHHEEMS is also carried out prior to leaving the armed forces, in part because many former servicemen remain as reserves. The PULHHEEMS examination can result in medical downgrading if fitness standards do not reach required levels, whether as a consequence of injury, neglect, pregnancy, or old age. Downgrading can reduce a serviceman's pay, and prevent him or her from attending courses, which in turn can prevent the serviceman from being promoted. Ultimately a serious, permanent medical downgrade can result in discharge from the armed forces on medical grounds. Acronym PULHHEEMS is an abbreviation for the factors it is intended to test. These include: Physique Upper limbs Lower limbs (or 'Locomotion', as this includes the back) Hearing (right) Hearing (left) Eyesight right (corrected / uncorrected) Eyesight left (corrected / uncorrected) Mental function Stability (emotional) Scoring The attributes examined in PULHHEEMS receive a score from 1 to 8, with 1 being excellent and 8 being unfit for service. Although in theory all attributes can be scored from 1 to 8, in practice only eyesight and hearing can be graded 1. Although there is provision for grading a serviceman's physical measurements as P1, the examination required would be impossible within the constraints of the PULHHEEMS system. The Mental and Stability measurements are not exhaustive psychological examinations. The former is a test of the ability to form coherent thought processes, whilst the latter is a measurement of the serviceman's stress level. =PES/MES= Once a person in service has undergone a PULHHEEMS, they receive a score. In the Royal Air Force (RAF), the score is the MES, which stands for \\"Medical Employment Status.\\" In the other branches, the score is the PES, which stands for \\"PULHHEEMS Employment Status\\". This PES is used to determine whether the soldier is \\"employable in full combatant duties (in any area) in any part of the world\\" or if they must remain away from the combat area, or within a specific geographic limitation. Sometimes it may be used in determining whether they are unfit for all duties. A PES grade of P2 is excellent, that of P7 is very poor, and P8 is unfit for duty. MES encapsulates the suitability of personnel for posting in the air, on the ground, and in different climates. Thus, a fully fit RAF serviceman will be graded A1 L1 M1 E1 (Only those that need to fly as part of their core duties would be awarded an A1 category. The highest anyone travelling as a passenger will get is A4 rather than P2. Conversely the Royal Navy, which includes the Royal Marines, makes no distinction between postings at sea or on land. History The PULHHEEMS system dates from WWII, although before 1983 it was simply PULHEEMS with one H. It replaced an earlier, simpler system which dated from before WWI in which soldiers were graded from A1 to D3 in four bands of three ratings.

The Continuum also refers to a collective group of time travelers as a whole and the society they inhabit in the game. Setting Unlike other time travel games (and fiction), which usually depict time travelers as either lone explorers or as an all-powerful \\"time police\\", Continuum assumes that time travelers (spanners) would eventually evolve their own society, with its own laws, rules, slang, groups, art movements, and the like. Time travel would color such a civilization in the same way that any other major technology (such as television or the automobile) has changed the human race. Continuum states that the core question of the game is \\"If you could learn to span time at will . . . what form of civilization would you be entering?\\" The Continuum, the main spanner civilization, extends through the whole of human history (and beyond, although the post-Human society of the enigmatic \\"Inheritors\\" borders on both sides). A primary focus of this civilization is to increase the knowledge and acceptance of time travel by the human race, so that when time travel is discovered and announced (approx. 2222 AD), humans will be ready for it, and moving into the next step in their evolution (becoming Inheritors). Another focus of the Continuum is the complete documentation of history. The Continuum civilization also has \\"time criminals\\", called \\"Narcissists\\", so called because they seek to remake history in their own image. (In the late 1990s the publisher announced they would be releasing a version of the Continuum book with the background material retold from the Narcissist standpoint. As of 2015, it has not been released, but a pre-release edition circulated in 1999 and 2000.) The Continuum has members trained to \\"repair\\" damage caused to the course of history by the Narcissists. The game's solution to the issue of time travel paradox is the concept of frag. The universe does not tolerate paradox caused by time travelers, nor are parallel worlds created by paradox. Instead the universe begins to \\"erase\\" those for whom the paradox exists. (The frag concept appears to be based partly on the ideas in Alfred Bester's \\"The Men Who Murdered Mohammed\\".) Too much association with paradoxes (too much frag) and time travelers become something not quite real anymore. Frag can also be generated on purpose, a tactic in \\"time combat\\". The Continuum society is partially built upon the repair of paradoxes that affect its members. To explain frag by example, using the Grandfather paradox, a Narcissist might decide to travel back in time and kill his grandfather. If he \\"succeeded\\", he would return to his own time to find his grandfather alive. (The Continuum would step in to \\"repair\\" the murder.) The Narcissist would then begin to fade out of existence due to the conflict between his own memories and \\"actual\\" history. He has been \\"fragged\\". The game also has immersion techniques to bring players \\"into the game\\". Most of the book claims to be, and is written as, an anachronistic artifact of spanner culture, aimed at increasing public awareness of time travel to further the Continuum's ends, and to prepare for the public announcement of time-travel. For example, players are required to quote the Maxims of the Continuum before advancing to the next level, and track their time travel, in exactly the manner their characters in the game do. Artwork in the books is also credited to spanners and often depicts the particular aspects of spanner culture.  Sourcebooks  * ** The main rulebook required for play. * ** A resource book detailing various civilizations lost to \\"mainstream\\" history, but well known to spanners. * A third book, titled N¬™rcissist: Crash Free, was announced in the late 1990s. It has not yet been released, but the v0.5 and v0.7 playtest drafts of the work are available online. However, one of Continuum's writers has stated that the playtest is considerably different from the \\"current\\", as yet unpublished version of the rules.

In 2015 the city had an estimated population of 1,271,704 The city lies near the Lulua River, a tributary of the Kasai River and the Ilebo-Lubumbashi railway. An important commercial and administrative centre, it is home to a museum and to Kananga Airport. History German explorer Hermann Wissmann established a station in the area around present-day Kananga, on the left bank of the Lulua. Wissmann named the station Malandji, a name suggested by his 400 carriers, who were from the city of Malanje in Angola. Later on, with the construction of the railway on the other bank of the river, the station was moved, and the Lulua train station gave its name to the new town, namely Luluabourg. The old location is named Malandji-Makulu (old Malandji) to this day. At the Belgo- Congolese Round Table Conference, in 1960, the name given to the negotiations for the independence of the then-Belgian Congo, a decision was taken that the new state would move the location of its capital from Kinshasa to Luluabourg, due to the latter's central location. However, due to multiple political setbacks, and particularly the secession attempt by Albert Kalonji and his South Kasai, this decision was never implemented. When the central government reconquered South Kasai in 1962, Luluabourg became the capital of the new Kasai-Occidental province. Kananga (as Luluabourg) was the site of the drafting of the first Congolese-written constitution for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in 1964. Street view of Kananga In 1966, during an Africanization campaign, Mobutu Sese Seko renamed a number of cities and towns that bore European names. Leopoldville became Kinshasa, and Luluabourg became Kananga. The name Kananga derives from the Tshiluba word kanangayi meaning \\"a place for peace or love\\" as what is now central Kananga was a gathering place for pre-colonial chiefs to discuss treaties and to settle disputes. Under the 2006 constitution, the Democratic republic of the Congo was divided in 25 provinces, and one national Capital city (Kinshasa). The Kasai-Occidental was divided into two provinces. Kananga became the capital of the Lulua Province. Locally, Kananga is known as Kananga-Malandji, or even Kananga-Malandji wa Nshinga. Nshinga, or cables, stands for the large high-voltage cables of the Inga-Shaba project, that cross the skies of Kananga, and that link Kolwezi and the Lualaba Province to the Inga Dam in Bas-Congo.

It is KMFDM's most widely known song to date, with around three million copies of the song sold across various releases. Background and composition The music for the song was written primarily by KMFDM frontman Sascha Konietzko, who asked returning band member Raymond Watts to write the lyrics for \\"Juke Joint Jezebel\\" as well as a few other tracks from Nihil. Also credited as authors are En Esch and G√ºnter Schulz. When mixing the song, Konietzko thought it sounded too \\"awful\\" to be included on Nihil, but TVT Records, to whom KMFDM were signed at the time, wanted to put it on the album, certain it would become a hit. In KMFDM's profile for Trouser Press, Neil Strauss highlights Watts' lyrics and looped guitar riffs and electro-funk beats as the song's main features In a 2013 book Assimilate: A Critical History of Industrial Music, musician and scholar S. Alexander Reed called the song \\"iconic\\", citing it as an example of industrial music's \\"use of gestures from traditional African-derived musics...\\", and notes \\"a massive gospel choir\\" of backup singers in the chorus. In addition to this, the \\"sleazy and exuberant\\" chorus features a harmonic use of the Mixolydian mode, which seems to \\"set the song apart from industrial conventions,\\" with lyrics describing pleasure from self-destruction, \\"tapping into shallow perceptions of religious fervor and lasciviousness.\\" Release \\"Juke Joint Jezebel\\" single was initially released on February 28, 1995. After the release of Nihil, a second version of the single was released with additional remixes by Italian record producer Giorgio Moroder. The Canadian release of Juke Joint Jezebel: The Giorgio Moroder Mixes includes a bonus CD titled The Year Of The Pig Collection, which feature one track each from KMFDM's previous six studio albums, as well \\"Fuck Me\\" from Sin Sex & Salvation. \\"Juke Joint Jezebel\\" was also released on a 12\\" entitled Year of the Pig. The single did not enter the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, but peaked at number 27 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The song was accompanied by two music videos, both directed by Eric Zimmerman. The first, set to the single edit of album version and featured later on Beat by Beat by Beat compilation, combines the live footage with the animations from the Patlabor 1 anime. The other video, set to Moroder's \\"Metropolis\\" remix, was released to promote the Mortal Kombat (1995) film and uses footage from the film. MTV was reluctant to air the video, objecting to the footage featuring violence. The original version of the song is in the 1995 film Bad Boys, while abovementioned \\"Metropolis\\" remix headlined the compilation album Mortal Kombat (1995) soundtrack. Both soundtracks eventually went platinum. The album version of the song can also be heard in the \\"Home is Where the Tart Is\\" episode of Beverly Hills, 90210. The original single version was re-released as a 7\\" in 2009. On October 25, 2010, \\"Juke Joint Jezebel\\" was made available as a downloadable song for the Rock Band Network. Critical reception \\"Juke Joint Jezebel\\" has received significant critical acclaim. Heidi MacDonald of CMJ New Music Monthly called the song \\"nearly flawless\\". Andy Hinds of AllMusic, mentioning the song in the main album's review, called it \\"an enduring and indispensable dancefloor favorite at goth/industrial clubs around the world.\\" Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said it \\"swaggers like a Bourbon Street hooker, with crunching guitars and a swooping, gospelish chorus\\". \\"Juke Joint Jezebel\\" was listed at No. 23 on COMA Music Magazine's \\"101 Greatest Industrial Songs of All Time\\" feature in 2012. The track was also featured on Alternative Press list of \\"10 Industrial-Rock Classics That Completely Defined the ‚Äô90s.\\" Holding a negative opinion of the song since mixing it, Konietzko admitted in 2016 he still did not like the song, which was retired from the band's concert setlist in 2003.

The pinnacle of her career was at the 1996 Summer Olympics when she won the women's 10000 m gold medal, establishing a new Olympic record of 31:01.63. Her victory gave Portugal its third Olympic gold medal. Biography Ribeiro started running with Grupo Desportivo do Kolossal, before joining FC Porto, which she represented from 1982-1992. She returned to FC Porto after two years at Maratona Clube da Maia. Along with her sports career, she has worked at her town hall as a sports adviser to the mayor. She holds Portugal's record for most Olympic medals. She has the record for most athletic medals won in Portugal, having participated in five summer Olympics (Seoul 1988, Barcelona 1992, Atlanta 1996, Sydney 2000, and Athens 2004) and many more European and World Championships. Ribeiro has continued running in her later years and won third place at the 2010 Lisbon Half Marathon, when she was 40 years old. She helped the Portuguese women's team win the title at the European Cup 10000 m in June 2010, rounding out the country's top runners with a seventh-place finish. Atlanta Olympic 10000 m gold medal, 1996 On 2 August 1996 Ribeiro ran in the finals of the Olympic women's 10000 m run. At the beginning of the last lap, Ribeiro was close behind the Chinese athlete Wang Junxia, world record holder and 5000 m Olympic champion. On the backstretch, Wang opened up as much as a 10-metre gap. In the last 200 meters accelerated, Ribeiro passed her opponent on the inside just as she entered the final straightaway. Wang had no answer. At the end of the race, Fernanda said: :I had promised to fight until my very limits, I only missed finishing on my knees. From the third kilometer I started feeling pain on the Achilles' tendon, managed to withstand, suffered, but I, for the dream of becoming Olympic champion, was ready to run until... death knocked me over! I just got a bit scared when I saw Wang, isolating 400 m to the finish line. But that instant I wasn't defeated yet... it was when I remembered my promise to go to Fatima on foot. In November 1996, she made a pilgrimage to F√°tima as promised to thank Our Lady of F√°tima for her incredible victory.
