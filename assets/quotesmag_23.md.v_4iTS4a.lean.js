Reception A Booktrust review of My Dad's a Birdman wrote \\"This charmingly illustrated, funny, fast-paced, seemingly simple story, is also beautifully tender and profound.\\" and Kirkus Reviews wrote \\"The characters sport silly names like Doreen Doody and Mr. Poop, and Dunbar‚Äôs colored illustrations, which appear on nearly every spread, evoke Quentin Blake. Readers will definitely come away with mixed feelings‚Äînot necessarily a bad thing, to be sure.\\" Booklist concluded its review with \\"As always, however, Almond writes beautifully, and though particular moments may give pause, this novel is a tribute to the human spirit.\\" and the School Library Journal wrote \\"A distinguished author's use of birds and human flight as metaphors for love's transcendence over grief and death takes a new form in this comic piece of magical realism.\\" and concluded \\"A fine read-aloud.\\" the Horn Book wrote \\" Almond flies where make-believe and madness converge, where imagination tends toward delusion, offering a stylized treatment of grief that expresses sorrow obliquely. The energy and color of his language -- \\"the blithering boops. The nits, the ninnies, the nincompoopy noodleheads!\\" -- and the surrealism of his imagery give this strange little tale a haunting brilliance.\\" My Dad's a Birdman has also been reviewed by Reading Time, Library Media Connection magazine, and The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books.

She is the Jack and DeLoris Lange Professor of Physiology and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco, where she collaborates with her husband Yuh Nung Jan as co-PIs of the Jan Lab.  Early life, education, and career  Lily Yeh was born Yeh Kung-chu (Ye Gongzhu) in Fuzhou, China to two accountants, Yeh Hong-shu and Lee Chuan-hwa. In 1949, her family moved to Taiwan, where she grew up. She attended a prestigious public school, the Taipei First Girls' High School, which is where she was first drawn to science. Even as a high-school student she was particularly drawn to the field of physics and was inspired by the 1957 Nobel Prize in physics awarded to Tsung Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang as well as the experimental physicist Chien Shiung Wu. Jan attended National Taiwan University where she earned her B.S. in physics in 1968. She then began her graduate studies with the intention of studying theoretical physics at Caltech. Two years later, in 1970, she was inspired by her thesis advisor, Max Delbr√ºck (winner of the 1969 Nobel Prize), and Jerome Vinograd to change her field of study to biology. Switching fields involved Jan sitting for a seven-day, open-book, open-library exam in the field of biology after having passed the qualifying exams for physics graduate students and also a placement test in organism biology. Lily Jan's proposal and her subsequent thesis work was focused on structural studies of rhodopsin localization in mammalian photoreceptors and also in plasma membranes. Her co- mentors for her graduate studies were Jean Paul Revel and Max Delbr√ºck. Upon joining the Delbr√ºck group, Jan was a member of the membrane biology subgroup where she performed challenging experiments in black lipid bilayers in the sub-terranean sub-basement of the electrical engineering building. The Jans have shared that from this point forward Delbr√ºck ensured separation of her graduate work from those of her spouse Yuh Nung Jan given his graduate studies with Delbr√ºck were focused on the sensory responses of the fungus Phycomyces to light, among other stimuli. Lily Jan would go on to hold postdoctoral positions in the laboratory of Seymour Benzer at Caltech and subsequently in the laboratory of Stephen Kuffler at Harvard Medical School. Jan and her husband joined the faculty at University of California, San Francisco in 1979 where are leaders of a joint research group. She has been a HHMI investigator since 1984.  Research  After graduating from Caltech with her Ph.D. in 1974, Lily Jan and her husband Yuh Nung Jan took summer courses at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory together. This coursework would mark the beginning their scientific collaboration which has spanned the majority of their careers. After that at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Jan and her husband would both begin postdoctoral fellowships in the group of Seymour Benzer at Caltech. Their first collaborative effort was building an electrophysiology rig in the laboratory towards the purpose of characterizing the neuromuscular junction in Drosophila fly larvae. This effort would lead to their first two collaborative publications which were in print by 1976, only nine years after the Jans first met. During this time, the Jans would first observe that a male mutant ShakerKS133 larvae exhibited an exceptionally large excitatory response after motor stimulation. Unraveling whether the mutant phenotype was linked to the nerve or muscle of Shaker mutant larvae would demarcate the beginning of the Jans' investigations on ion channels. Jan and her husband joined the faculty as assistant professors at UCSF in 1979 where they set up a joint lab. The two investigators only got $15,000 each in start-up money and 1,000 ft2 to share to set up their lab, however have shared they were drawn to UCSF by the people and the atmosphere. The early years of the Jans' research group at UCSF was distinguished by their efforts on cloning the Shaker channel and studies of neural development. In the 1980s, their work on neural development was performed in collaboration with Alain Ghysen and Christine Dambly-Chaudiere. The Jans were tenured in 1983 and were selected as Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigators in 1984. They have shared that from 1983 to 1986 their research goals were challenged by difficulties cloning the Shaker gene. In 1987, they were successful with cloning Shaker and enabling their team to perform functional studies on single potassium ion channels. Their neural development research has been particularly distinguished by breakthroughs in neurogenesis and cell fate specification(cut, numb, atonal, and daughterless). Since 1994, the Jan lab has been organized in function and development subgroups lead by each co-PI. The function group of the laboratory is led by Lily and largely focuses on the studies of ion channels, their assembly, and their dynamic response to neural activity. The development subgroup led by Yuh Nung has been engaged with questions surrounding dendrite morphogenesis.

This trip resulted in her meeting Yuh-Nung Jan and the beginning of their relationship. In 1971, they married with a simple ceremony in a Los Angeles courthouse followed by a celebration camping and hiking in Yosemite. The Jans had their first child together a daughter, Emily Huan-Ching Jan, on August 6, 1977. Lily was still involved in research leading up to her due date and went into early stages of labor in the midst of the group meeting of her posdoc lab. Just seven weeks later after celebrating the arrival of Emily, the Jans would move across the country to begin the next stages of their research careers at Harvard Medical School. Just a few years later, the Jans had established their independent research group at UCSF. In 1984, they were named Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators. That same year on November 7, 1984 the Jans welcomed their second child, a son named Max Huang-Wen Jan after the Jans‚Äô shared Ph.D. advisor, Max Delbr√ºck. The Jans have shared that before their children went to college they rarely attended scientific meetings together such that there was always one parent at home with their children. Outside of the lab, they have continued to enjoy their shared interests in hiking, exploration, and nature throughout their careers. And in 2011, after their visiting professorship at the Chinese Academy of the Sciences the Jans accomplished one of their lifelong goals, seeing Mt. Everest together from the base camp in Tibet.

It was published by Tor Books on November 14, 2017. Oathbringer consists of one prologue, 122 chapters, 14 interludes and an epilogue. It is preceded by Words of Radiance. As with its Stormlight Archive predecessors, the unabridged audiobook is read by narrator team Michael Kramer and Kate Reading. Development The third book was initially titled Stones Unhallowed with Szeth-son-son-Vallano as its focus, then Skybreaker, and eventually Oathbringer with the focus on Dalinar Kholin. Prior to the release of Oathbringer, several chapters and interludes have been posted in blog posts, read in conventions and published in an anthology. Sanderson has provided numerous updates on Reddit about his progress on the book. On December 9, 2016, three weeks after his fifth update, Tor announced that Sanderson had completed his first draft, coming in at 461,223 words. On March 15, 2017, Sanderson completed the third of five planned drafts, which totaled 514,000 words. On June 15, 2017, Sanderson completed the fifth and final draft and managed to cut it down to 450,000 words. On June 27, 2017, Tor posted a blog post detailing the process of beta reading for Oathbringer in which beta readers give their immediate reactions to any given point in the story and look for continuity. Due to the length of the book, Tor had to use a different press and bindery from the one that printed Words of Radiance. After realizing the book took more time to work on than originally planned, Sanderson wrote a novella titled Edgedancer, following Lift; first published in Arcanum Unbounded: The Cosmere Collection, an anthology of Cosmere short fiction, on November 22, 2016. On March 16, 2017, Tor Books revealed the cover art for Oathbringer, painted by Michael Whelan. It shows Jasnah Kholin defending a city against an invasion. She reaches for a Shardblade while simultaneously soulcasting a large hole in the city wall made by a thunderclast. Three days later, Tor posted a blog post that discussed details of the cover and how it may relate to the book's plot. On July 14, 2017, Sanderson revealed the UK cover of Oathbringer on Twitter. The hardcover version of the novel was published with endpapers which depict 4 of the ten heralds, two created by each artist Howard Lyon and Dan dos Santos. Reviewer Frannie Jackson described the art as \\"gorgeous.\\" On August 2, 2017, Tor Books revealed the dates and locations for the Oathbringer book tour. Tor.com released the prologue on August 22; and the first 32 chapters, three weekly, from August 29 to November 7. Audiobook The audiobook version of the book was released on the same day as the hardcover version, and is read by narrator team Michael Kramer and Kate Reading, who also read The Way of Kings and Words of Radiance, and several other books written by Sanderson. Sequel The fourth book in The Stormlight Archive series is titled Rhythm of War and its publication date is November 17, 2020. It takes place a year after the events of Oathbringer.  Reception  Reception of the series was mostly positive. The A.V. Club reviewer Samantha Nelson describes the novel as both weighed down by its ambition and less complex than its predecessors. While reviews on Tor find the novel engaging, with Martin Cahill writing that \\"It is a triumph of a novel, and if you‚Äôve enjoyed the first two, you‚Äôll certainly enjoy Oathbringer.\\" Publishers Weekly also described the novel in light of its relationship to other books in the series, writing, \\"Sanderson successfully balances introducing new elements and satisfactorily resolving some threads, leaving fans to eagerly await the next in the series.\\" The review in Paste by Frannie Jackson compares the novel to the long-arc storytelling of Robert Jordan, describing the novel as \\"brimming with more than enough magic and mystery to tide readers over until the [fourth novel is published].\\" References External links * Oathbringer on Brandon Sanderson's official website 2017 American novels The Stormlight Archive Tor Books books Books with cover art by Michael Whelan ","title":"Oathbringer"},{"id":"52566905","text":"This is an alphabetical list of women inventors: A * Berenice Abbott * Concepci√≥n Aleixandre * Randi Altschul * Betsy Ancker-Johnson * Beth Anderson (composer) * Mary Anderson (inventor) * Princess Anne of L√∂wenstein-Wertheim- Freudenberg * Virginia Apgar * Ruth Arnon * Margaret Atwood * Barbara Askins * Hertha Ayrton B * Tabitha Babbitt * Betty Lou Bailey * Ellene Alice Bailey * Alice Pike Barney * Janet Emerson Bashen * Patricia Bath * Ruth R.

Covering an area of in total , is the largest museum in the world specifically dedicated to this subject. The museum was opened in May 2015. History Planning for a museum in L√ºbeck dedicated to the history of the Hanseatic League began in 2004. The opening of the museum was delayed several times because archaeological excavations on the site proved more time-consuming than initially imagined. The museum was officially opened by the Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel on 27 May 2015, and received its first visitors on 30 May 2015. Collections and exhibitions The museum consists of a permanent exhibition with exhibits of original historical objects, interactive elements and staged historical scenes from the former trading ports of the Hansa Novgorod, Bruges, Bergen and London, as well as L√ºbeck. The original historical items displayed include documents, paintings and gold and silver coins from the so-called L√ºbeck Hoard. The exhibition is aimed at informing visitors about the overall history of the Hanseatic League from its formation to its dissolution, but also about the economics and trade networks of the League as well as of everyday life in the historical time span during which the Hansa existed. It is the largest museum in the world dedicated to the history of the Hanseatic League. Description =Location= The museum is located in the northern part of the old town of the city and lies in the part of the city that is considered a World Heritage Site (Hanseatic City of L√ºbeck). The museum is part of the Burgkloster or Castle Friary site, a former Dominican monastery from the 13th century, and it's also to a degree integrated with the \\"Castle Hill\\" nearby. The location has been described as \\"one of the most important medieval monuments in northern Germany\\". Visitors to the museum can also access the Burgkloster and the archaeological site on which the museum was built, thus providing an insight into the development of the urban and social structure of L√ºbeck in parallel to the museum's exhibition chronicling the history of the Hansa. =Architecture= The museum was designed by the architectural firm Andreas Heller Architects & Designers, based in Hamburg. The building is constructed of hand-crafted bricks, and though modernist in its expression, also displays references to its historical context. Its compact wall can thus be interpreted as a reference to the old medieval city wall, part of which once was located on the site of the museum; similarly, the roof of the building can be seen as a referral to the crow-stepped gables of the old city of L√ºbeck, and its decoration as a contemporary interpretation of the Gothic taste for intricate quatrefoil. Inside, the layout of the museum mixes open and closed spaces and it contains, apart from the exhibition areas, also a playground and a restaurant. The museum covers an area of in total . Criticism After its opening, the museum has been criticised for being too dark, and the exhibits too reliant on text and not being properly contextualised.

He is recognized for his research on the tumor suppressor gene, p53, which is mutated in nearly half of cancers.  Early life and education  Lowe was born in 1963 in Racine, Wisconsin. He enrolled at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in chemical engineering in 1982 before changing his major to biology. He worked for two years after graduation as a lab technician in a hypercholesterolemia lab. Low entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with an interest in oncogene cooperation in carcinogenesis, and went on to earn his PhD studying the role of p53 in cancer development. He stayed at MIT as a postdoctoral fellow with David Housman and Tyler Jacks.  Career  While at MIT, he showed that the tumor suppressor p53 is required for the cell death program that occurs in response to cytotoxic agents such as ionizing radiation and DNA-damaging chemotherapies. He moved from MIT to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, starting his own laboratory as a Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Fellow in 1995 and continuing his work on p53. A key outcome of this research was the discovery of a process known as oncogene-induced senescence, which is now a well-established tumor suppressive program. His laboratory's findings related to the p53 gene mutation status and responsiveness of a tumor to chemotherapy was among the pieces of evidence that ushered in the era of personalized cancer medicine. He eventually became Deputy Director of the CSHL Cancer Center. Much of his work has focused on the biological action of tumor suppressor genes, and the consequences of their mutation. In collaboration with Gregory Hannon and Stephen Elledge, he has made extensive use of RNA interference to study the roles of tumor suppressor genes. He is also known for using genome-editing tools such as CRISPR to create valuable mouse models of different cancers. He moved to Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2011 to lead the Cancer Biology and Genetics Program in the Sloan Kettering Institute, where he discovered mechanisms whereby senescence inducing therapies promote cancer cell immune surveillance. In 2015, Lowe continued his use of RNAi to study the tumor suppressor APC in colorectal cancer. He has been an HHMI Investigator since 2005. In 2017, Dr. Lowe was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences.

Initially the museum was set in two rooms of the Museum of Contemporary Art of Alcamo inside the Ex Collegio dei Gesuiti, in Piazza Ciullo. The museum was born thanks to the perseverance of Fausto Cannone (a teacher, poet and singer-songwriter): thanks to his generous donation, they could realize in Alcamo the first ethnical musical Museum existing in Sicily. = Fausto Cannone = The museum was opened thanks to Fausto Cannone's perseverance and desire of this artist to leave a sign of love to his town:alpauno.com, https://www.alpauno.com/alcamo-nasce-il-museo- degli-strumenti-musicali-donati-da-fausto-cannone/. Cannone, who died last September, went round the world for 30 years: he got the most strange and original musical instruments, string and wind ones, which are all working and bought in their original countries. At last, this exceptional patrimony, maybe unique in its genre, has its final seat. Fausto Cannone had received several requests, even by the Palazzo Steri from Palermo, but he preferred to donate these precious instruments to his hometown. He wanted to dedicate this museum to his father Gaspare Cannone who was a journalist, literary critic, anarchist and antifascist: He lived in the United States for many years, but due to his stands in favour of Sacco and Vanzetti, he was arrested and then forced to get back to Italy.https://www.accordo.it/article/viewPub/82943 = Description and instruments = The Museum hosts 202 instruments coming from Thailand to Tibet, from New Guinea al South America, from Polynesia to China, from Australia to Argentina, from South Africa to several European countries.

It was located near the present-day Titanic Quarter railway station.  History  The first track, built around 1848, ran from Belfast Queen's Quay to Holywood. On 6 May 1850, the area became a junction, curving Southeast to Dundonald to become part of the main line of the BCDR. In 1871, another spur came in from the South to the West end of the junction, constituting the Belfast Central Railway connection. The junction continued with this basic configuration for nearly 80 years. On 13 May, while the junction was under construction, an accident occurred, killing two passengers. On 10 January 1945, an accident took place on the Bangor line, about East of the junction resulting in 22 fatalities and 27 injuries. The accident is blamed on a combination of excess speed and poor visibility. On 22 April 1950, the main line spur to the East was closed for revenue service, and in the same year, the Newcastle route was closed. On 10 April 1976, revenue service ceased at Queen's Quay. Instead, services ran from the new Belfast Central station to Bangor. Today, this route from Belfast to Bangor is the only existing operative line over the former Belfast and County Down Railway. The Titanic Quarter stop was added 9 May 1977, known at the time as Bridge End. In 1994, the original Northern entrance on the west end that connected to Queen's Quay was removed due to the decommissioning of its maintenance area.

She is well known on the west coast of the United States, but has a significant following throughout America and abroad for her music, writing, teaching, Womanrunes, Moonwheels, Goddess ritual, and spiritual and social activism. Mountainwater referred to herself as a \\"muse-ical mystical magical woman who loves the Goddess and women, a foremother of the Womanspirit movement, a teacher of Women's Mysteries, and a priestess of Aphrodite.\\" She dedicated her life to sharing and expressing the love of the Goddess, leading women to reclaim their power and connection to one another and to the earth. Her music, poetry, tarot and learned writings are still celebrated in women's circles worldwide. Mountainwater was a pioneer of what is now referred to in some circles as ‚ÄúPagan music;‚Äù her unique melding of folk and spiritual, ritualistic themes eventually led to her passion for the Goddess. She began folksinging during the American folk music revival of the 1950s and 60's, and played in the same coffee houses in the Village in New York as Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell. Mountainwater was one of the first musicians in the early 60‚Äôs folk movement to start re-tuning the guitar to simple chords, creating a unique and resonant sound that was reminiscent of the organ, or sometimes even the bag-pipe. This movement was called ‚ÄúModal Music.‚Äù In Mountainwater‚Äôs case, the lower strings were often used to create a base-drone, while the others harmonized or quarreled with them. Although the bulk of her early influences were Scottish, Celtic, English, Appalachian and American folk, her work has Arabic and African under/overtones. Besides creating a distinctive style and sound, she was a prolific and gifted poet. Her literary compositions stand on their own for eloquence and social pertinence. Motivated by a passionate spirituality, she often chose mythical or occult themes for her treatments. She was able to communicate stories from the protagonist‚Äôs perspective, allowing the listener to delve into the psyche of her characters -- to feel the pain and joy of an icon personified. As she became more active in the women‚Äôs spiritual community, her songs were often overtly political, or designed as tools for trance induction and prayer. Her creations however, remained unfailingly personal and poetic, and many remember her ironic wit and brilliance in performance. Mountainwater is best known for her book Ariadne's Thread: A Workbook of Goddess Magic. The work is considered a classic by many practitioners and seekers of women's spirituality and goddess worship. The text encourages women to find their own spiritual path, using the figure of the ancient goddess Ariadne as a metaphor, and elucidating the mysteries of woman-centered spirituality, while offering guidance through the cycles of life. These include the phases of the moon, the yearly nature holidays, and the aspects of divination. Ariadne‚Äôs Thread can be used as a study guide or manual; each chapter concludes with suggested exercises, meditations, and reading lists. The book will be republished in the fall of 2018 by Echo Point Books. Mountainwater's songs and chants endeared her to music lovers as well as witches and practitioners of Goddess worship, magic and ritual. Witch's Choice, Lady with the Lamp, Cry of the Phoenix, Mischievous Fairy, Lady Mother of All, The Year is a Dancing Woman, A Solstice Story, and Power Spot are just a few of her most popular titles. Mountainwater was diagnosed with cancer in 2005, and died on August 11, 2007. Since her death, her children have endeavored to establish her intellectual estate through the home-spun company known as ShekhinahWorks. In 2014, Shekhinah's birth-daughter committed to an ongoing project to collect, collate and make available her mother's works. Her projects include: republishing Ariadne's Thread, publishing a digital, or Kindle copy of Ariadne's Thread, creating a commemorative Facebook page, YouTube channel, and website, and a remastering and publishing of Mountainwater's original tarot deck.  Womanrunes  The Moonwheel - based on Shekhinah's system of Tree Moons In 2012, Molly Remer of Brigid's Grove found Mountainwater's Womanrunes in a copy of Sagewoman magazine from 1988. She made her own set and then began to expand on the interpretations of the symbols. With the permission of Mountainwater's estate, Remer created a card deck of the runes and wrote a book of interpretations to accompany the deck. She published the deck and book in 2014 in order to reintroduce the women's spirituality movement to these \\"woman-identified\\" runes.

The show premiered on July 22, 2003 on Comedy Central and was the seventh episode in season one of Comedy Central Stand-Up Specials. It is directed by Paul Miller and was filmed in front of a live audience at the Palace Theater in Albany, NY. According to Linda Mizejewski, a Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies professor at Ohio State University in her book, Pretty/Funny: Women Comedians and Body Politics, the title of the special refers to Tongues Untied, a documentary by Marlon Riggs released in 1989.  Plot  Sykes begins her special by talking about sources of frustration, beginning with bad ideas for TV shows and ending with airport security. Talking about airports segues into a discussion of President Bush and 9/11 culminating in Sykes‚Äô observation that President Bush has done everything she expected him to do. She says, ‚ÄúThe economy is in the toilet, we‚Äôre at war and everything is on fire.\\" Sykes continues with her critical tone firing off a barrage of jokes at the expense of the American government, the state of New Jersey, and the stock market. Keeping with the theme of current events, Sykes references the scandal surrounding the Catholic Church and makes observations about the Pope. She then shifts the object of her comedy to the topic of drinking, exploring the pros and cons of drinking in different cities, the dynamics between drunken friends and drunk driving. Next, Sykes uses the matter of strip clubs as a precursor to describing some of the differences between the ways in which men and women think and communicate. This leads to a conversation about marriage, which Sykes compares to a relationship between business partners of which children are the resulting product. She shares her opinions on having children, which she admits is not something she sees herself doing, and then moves on to contemplate the aging process. The last topic that Sykes tackles is sex, finishing her performance by revealing her thoughts on why women fake pleasure.Sykes, Wanda. \\"Tongue Untied.\\" Dir. Paul Miller. Comedy Central.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. At the time of its nomination it contained 10 resources, which included eight contributing buildings, one contributing site, and one non-contributing building. with All of the buildings are houses designed in the Prairie School style, and are a part of a planned development. Joshua Melson, a local developer, bought the property along Willow Creek between 1902 and 1908. Initially, there were only going to be 10 houses built, but the number grew to 16. While only half the houses planned were actually constructed, it is still the largest cluster of Prairie School houses in the country. The one non-contributing house is the 1959 McNider House, a Modern movement structure that was built where one of the planned houses was to be built, but never was. The architects who contributed to the district include Walter Burley Griffin, who provided the initial plan for the development; Barry Byrne, who took over from Griffin; Marion Mahony Griffin, Walter Griffin's wife and an architect in her own right; and Einar Broaten. Frank Lloyd Wright had a design that was never built here. The plans were used to build the Isabel Roberts House in River Forest, Illinois instead. The mill was built in 1870, and it was the second mill built in Mason City. When the Rock Crest‚ÄìRock Glen plans were finalized, the mill was dismantled and the stone foundations maintained to house a hydroelectric station for the development. The station was never built. Other plans included having them used as a pier support for a bridge across Willow Creek, and for a small summer house. Those plans also were never executed.

He also specializes on the philosophy of mind, cognitive science, epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of language, ethics, and hermeneutics. He is currently Doris Silbert Professor in the Humanities at Smith College, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Melbourne, Visiting Professor of Philosophy and Buddhist Studies at Harvard Divinity School, and Adjunct Professor of Philosophy at the Central University of Tibetan Studies. Academic career Garfield received an A.B. from Oberlin College in 1975, and a Ph.D. from the University of Pittsburgh in 1986, where he worked with Wilfrid Sellars and Annette Baier. At the Central University of Tibetan Studies in India, he studied Nagarjuna with Geshe Yeshe Thabkhas. He taught from 1980-1995 at Hampshire College, from 1996-1998 at the University of Tasmania, and since 1999 at Smith College. He is editor in chief of the journal Sophia, and is on the editorial boards of Philosophical Psychology, Journal of Indian Philosophy and Religion, Australasian Philosophical Review, Philosophy East and West, American Institute of Buddhist Studies/Columbia Center for Buddhist Studies/Tibet House, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, and the Journal of Buddhist Philosophy. Garfield was the inaugural Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple Professor of Humanities and Head of Studies, Philosophy, at Yale-NUS from 2013-2016. He said, \\"This Professorship has given me the opportunity of a lifetime ‚Äì working with motivated, creative and talented students and colleagues and working in a community committed to building something entirely new, an Asian liberal arts college with a truly global curriculum.\\" During his professorship at Yale-NUS, Garfield was one of six scholars who participated in a conference with the 14th Dalai Lama on \\"Mapping the Mind: A Dialogue between Modern Science and Buddhist Science.\\"  Controversy over \\"If Philosophy Won't Diversify\\"  Garfield has long been a critic of the narrow approach of Western philosophers. He has noted that \\"people in our profession are still happy to treat Western philosophy as the 'core' of the discipline, and as the umarked case. So, for instance, a course that addresses only classical Greek philosophy can be comfortably titled 'Ancient Philosophy,' not 'Ancient Western Philosophy,' and a course in metaphysics can be counted on to ignore all non-Western metaphysics. A course in Indian philosophy is not another course in the history of philosophy, but is part of the non-Western curriculum.\\" Because of his knowledge of Buddhism and commitment to encouraging the study of Asian philosophy, Garfield was invited to be the keynote speaker at a conference on non-Western philosophical traditions organized by graduate students in philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania in 2016. However, he was \\"outraged\\" that there were only \\"one or two\\" members of the regular faculty in the department who attended the event, because he felt that this showed a lack of support for their own students' interest in non-Western philosophy. Garfield discussed this issue with another speaker at the conference, Bryan W. Van Norden, and they wrote an editorial that appeared in The Stone column of The New York Times in May of that year, entitled \\"If Philosophy Won't Diversify, Let's Call It What It Really Is.\\" In this editorial, they state: \\"we have urged our colleagues to look beyond the European canon in their own research and teaching.\\" However, \\"progress has been minimal.\\" Consequently, so long as \\"the profession as a whole remains resolutely Eurocentric,\\" Garfield and Van Norden \\"ask those who sincerely believe that it does make sense to organize our discipline entirely around European and American figures and texts to pursue this agenda with honesty and openness. We therefore suggest that any department that regularly offers courses only on Western philosophy should rename itself 'Department of European and American Philosophy.'\\" The article received 797 comments in just 12 hours. (None of the other Stone columns that month had over 500 comments.) Garfield later explained, \\"I woke up to all this email in my inbox [with] people asking, 'Are you okay?' 'Do you need to talk?'\\" Garfield soon realized that his colleagues were expressing concern for his well-being because so many of the comments on the article expressed \\"vitriolic racism and xenophobia. And some of it was clearly by philosophers and students of philosophy.'\\" One typical comment was that Western philosophy deserves precedence because \\"there is a particular school of thought that caught fire, broke cultural boundaries, and laid the foundation of modern science (Does anyone want to fly in a plane built with non-western math?) and our least oppressive governmental systems.\\" On the other hand, there were also many supportive comments: \\"Hear! Hear! Inclusion is the order of the day. ... More wisdom from more perspectives ‚Äî what could be better? We have so much to learn from each other, if only we listen.\\" Garfield and Van Norden's article was almost immediately translated into Chinese, and over twenty blogs in the English-speaking world have commented or hosted discussions, including Reddit.See notes below for some of the other websites Garfield and Van Norden's piece has continued to provoke strong reactions. Some have applauded their call for greater diversity in the US philosophical canon. In addition, their piece has been featured in several recent essays arguing for greater diversity in philosophy. However, there has also been extensive criticism of the Garfield and Van Norden article. Two conservative editorials criticized the piece for failing to acknowledge the superiority of Western philosophy. Two other articles argued that \\"philosophy\\" is, by definition, the tradition that grows out of Plato and Aristotle, so nothing outside that tradition could count as philosophy. Professor Amy Olberding of the University of Oklahoma wrote a detailed reply to critics of Garfield and Van Norden, arguing that criticisms fall into a stereotypical pattern that betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the issues.

Background  In this case, the Veteran claimed service connection for a neck disability. Service medical records showed the Veteran sought, on one occasion, medical treatment for neck pain of two months duration with no history of trauma. A post-service VA examination report showed a diagnosis of \\"[h]istory of trauma with continuing pain in cervical spine.\\" A 1996 examination report showed \\"[t]he physical findings and the radiologic findings do not reveal a definite or specific cause of the complaints in the neck and low back.\\" The examiner was \\"not able to correlate well the complaint of chronic pain with the clinical findings.\\" The Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) determined that the preponderance of the evidence was against service connection for a neck disability and affirmed the denial.  Analysis  The Court determined that the Board did not err in its decision. The Court noted that the in-service diagnosis was \\"pain\\" and that the current diagnosis was \\"pain\\" as well. Pointing to 38 U.S.C. ¬ß1110, the Court noted that service connection is awarded for \\"disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in [the] line of duty.\\" The Court noted that pain often warrants separate and even additional consideration when rating an already service connected disability. However, the Court stated that for general purposes of service connection that pain alone, without a diagnosed or identifiable underlying malady or condition, does not in and of itself constitute a disability for which service connection can be granted.  Decision  The Court affirmed the BVA decision.  References  law 1999 in United States case law ","title":"Sanchez-Benitez v.

One of the first two bishops of the Vietnamese Catholic church, Pierre Lambert de la Motte was also anointed in the diocese in 1670. The construction of the church began in 1866 after Emperor T·ª± ƒê·ª©c signed a treaty with the French promising not to harm the Christian community. The first church was built in 1881. Construction of the second church began in 1916, and was completed in 1923. Major storms devastated the church on June 24, 1929. A nationwide lottery was conducted to fund the construction, and the replacement (third) church was consecrated on the day of the feast of Immaculate Conception on December 8, 1933. During the First Indochina War, the church suffered minor damages, after the French took over the church. Bishop Dominic Nguyen Chu Trinh decided to renovate the church in 2003, and the church in its present state was consecrated on September 26, 2004.

It's the perfect job for me, really.\\" Lily is the niece of established character Diane Hutchinson (Alex Fletcher).

McQueen commented that Lily and Prince were total opposites and that no one would think to put them together. Lily also struggles with self-harm and later becomes engaged to Prince, without knowing that he has got her friend Peri Lomax (Ruby O'Donnell) pregnant.

He also said that Shane only \\"loves his family when it suits him.\\" Prince and Hunter will be divided upon their father's return, with Prince welcoming him back, whereas Hunter is more wary and thinks that Shane is potentially scamming the family.

He will join his mother Misbah (Harvey Virdi), sisters Farrah (Krupa Pattani) and Yasmine (Haiesha Mistry), and half-brother Sami Maalik (Rishi Nair). Imran has been billed as being \\"a quiet and charming boy\\", who has a love for photography, which he inherited from his father. He is close to his older sister Yasmine, but often feels like \\"the forgotten child\\" due to her heart condition. It was announced on 7 December 2017 that Imran would be involved in an issue-led storyline when he begins emotionally and physically abusing Misbah. Imran's abuse stems from feeling isolated from his family, mainly due to Yasmine's heart condition. Misbah will struggle to protect herself and her son, while also managing her job and parenting role. The show worked with Family Lives, Sefton Women's and Children's Aid, and The Muslim Council of Great Britain while researching the storyline. A spokesperson for Family Lives expressed her delight at working with the show on the storyline as well as at Hollyoaks for highlighting the issue. Nick Frackleton, the CEO of Sefton Women's and Children's Aid, felt that the show holds a \\"key role\\" in addressing these forms of \\"sensitive\\" issues and praised them for tackling the plot. Rana found the storyline a surprising development for his character as he initially appeared to be \\"a very gentle and well- mannered character\\". The storyline began in January 2018 when after a car crash, Misbah opts to save Yasmine from the car rather than Imran as a lorry headed towards the car. Imran manages to free himself before the lorry hits although he is left feeling bitter and rejected by his mother. Virdi explained that Misbah intended to rescue Yasmine then return to rescue Imran but did not have enough time. The actress felt that Imran would never be able to understand Misbah's decision. In order to create Imran's feeling of neglect, Rana reread ever Maalik family scene and noticed that his character was sidelined in every scene; the actor felt that this could enhance his performance. The actor felt that Imran becomes \\"mentally scarred\\" by the incident, which leads into the family violence storyline. Sean Glynn, who directed the crash sequence, wanted to make the crash seem realistic so asked the driver of the lorry to drive towards the car that Imran and Yasmine were trapped in. He made this decision so that the actors' performances could be enhanced, which Rana felt he did. On filming the stunt, Rana commented, \\"The whole experience was very exciting, but tiring towards the end!\\" Imran's behaviour starts to become a cause for concern when he sells the family heirloom which was precious to Misbah, and when she figures this out after realising it went missing, she immediately confiscates a bike that Imran bought with the money he made from selling the heirloom, and tells Imran he'd get it back when he paid it off. When Misbah takes in Dirk Savage (David Kennedy) following him becoming homeless, Imran is consumed with jealousy over their bond, and he spooks Dirk into thinking he is dating Misbah to make him stay away. After learning from Sami that James Nightingale (Gregory Finnegan) had framed their father for embezzlement which led to him committing suicide in prison, Imran is quick to blame Misbah for letting the entire family down by doubting her husband, and in a fit of rage, he slaps her across the face, before he begins to feel guilt the following morning about what he did. He apologises repeatedly to Misbah for his actions, but she insists she needs space for the day. In a bid to make amends, Imran calls a family meeting and buys pizza for everyone, before saying that the family is sometimes flawed in their arguments and shouting, but that Misbah is the one holding them together and that she should be admired for it. Eventually, Misbah finds Imran and forgives him, while he explains that he wanted to say how he was in the wrong that morning, and she comforts him. The following month, Imran learns that his new friend Oliver Morgan's (Aedan Duckworth) father, Luke (Gary Lucy), was raped over 17 years previously, and is forced to tell Oliver about it when he questions Imran about what he heard while he let it slip in the football changing rooms. When Imran and Yasmine decide to get their own back on James for his treatment of the family, it's decided that a party should be held to get to know the Nightingales better, but when James turns up he seizes the opportunity to insult everybody there, including Imran by calling him creepy, which infuriates him. When the Maaliks get back, another argument unfolds between Misbah and Imran, this time leading to Imran slapping Misbah again and saying that she doesn't deserve to be respected. When headteacher Sally St. Claire (Annie Wallace) approaches Misbah to discuss Imran, it emerges that he has been playing truant, and Misbah becomes suspicious with Imran when he won't hand over his schoolbag. However several letters intercepted by him fly out, confirming that he has been skipping school. An education welfare officer visits the Maaliks the following day to break the news that Misbah is to be fined for Imran's truancy, which leads her to decide that Imran will be grounded for a week and have his camera confiscated. When he learns this, he flies into a rage with Misbah and smashes plates onto the floor, before attempting to get away from Misbah who tries to drag him back, but ends up having the door swung into her face by Imran, causing a bleed on her eye. The next day, Misbah suffers headaches and loss of vision due to Imran's violence, especially while trying to treat Dee Dee Hutchinson for her autoimmune encephalitis, and she ends up giving Dee Dee a superfluous amount of morphine. On her break, she finds that Imran has skipped school again, and loses her temper with him when he is asked to clean up some milk on the floor. As soon as Misbah reminds him of the damage his outburst has done, he spitefully shouts and screams at Misbah that he skips school so that she can go to prison, and that he behaves violently because of her decision to leave Imran in the car while the lorry headed for him. Misbah eventually tries to arrange counselling for Imran but is caught in the act by him, and while he reminds her of how much she is ruining the family, she collapses from her head injury and Imran is shocked and panicked. Wracked with guilt, Imran decides to turn himself into the police, which Misbah finds out and intercepts, telling him that his birth was so important as she always wanted a boy. When Imran has an important football match and Misbah promises to come, Yasmine goes into gastric reflux and Misbah therefore can't go because she has to tend to Yasmine, and Imran stays behind waiting for Misbah. Because of this, Imran is made a laughing stock by the team and Imran destroys a piece of Misbah's artwork in anger. She apologises for missing Imran's match, and finds his coach, Buster Smith (Nathan Sussex), to bribe him to keep Imran on the team. When Imran next goes to football practice, he is laughed at again by his teammates and Oliver as they announce that he has been made captain by Buster. Once he gets home, Imran rants at Misbah for being made a laughing stock and hurls a trophy that she brought at the wall. Later, Misbah decides to get tough with Imran about his behaviour, and bans him from video games for a week, but as he begins to protest it, she grounds him and asks for his phone and tablet. After some to-ing and fro-ing, Misbah pulls the plug on his games console, causing him to lose all the data. This sends Imran over the edge and he threatens Misbah with a TV remote. As the tension escalates, Misbah slaps Imran in self-defence. The following morning, Misbah apologises repeatedly for hitting him, but since Imran is still angry at Misbah, he storms out of the house and is caught by Sally riding his bike in the village when she thought he was ill from glandular fever, but she spots the bruise on his face from the slap and is forced to report Misbah to social services. They turn up the next day at the Maaliks, just as Misbah and Imran were planning a getaway for the family to Disneyland. Misbah comes under pressure from the social worker and as soon as Sami gets tough, she admits that she hit Imran, but because of his rebellious behaviour. Sami is furious and disgusted with Misbah for what she did, and warns her that he will be watching her closely. Imran soon learns that there will be a football trip to Barcelona and announces it to Misbah, but is finited to find out that they can't afford the deposit. Imran winds Misbah up when she catches him using her credit card to pay for the deposit himself, but soon lets him use the card to buy new football boots, but Imran succumbs to peer pressure from Oliver, who convinces him to buy alcohol. Whilst buying the alcohol, they are caught in the act by Simone Loveday (Jacqueline Boatswain) who brings Imran home and tells him off, leading to Misbah having to ground Imran for his safety, but when Imran throws a tantrum about it, Misbah cancels the trip. After finding out that Buster got involved, Imran's anger escalates even more, and he goes as far as throwing a hot cup of tea over Misbah's arm, which is witnessed by a shocked Yasmine just as she walks through the door. Misbah breaks down in front of Yasmine as Imran storms off. The following morning, Misbah's sister Kameela comes to visit, but because of her judgmental attitude, the family try to dodge her questions but Yasmine nearly brings up Imran's violence and the secret of Imran trying to buy alcohol comes out in the process. Kameela is quick to criticise Misbah for being too liberal with her children, and a fight breaks out with Misbah forcing Kameela to leave because of her constant judging. Yasmine tells Imran that she saw the attack, and he runs off. When Yasmine confronts Imran further about his actions, he sees red and pushes her to the ground, leading Yasmine to declare her hatred of Imran, and a heart to heart with Misbah makes her tell Yasmine that Imran has been rebellious and violent ever since the car crash. Determined to fix her relationship with Imran, Misbah goes to Buster and begs for Imran to be taken to Barcelona, which he goes ahead with. Imran is delighted and hugs Misbah, leaving Yasmine disgusted and jealous with Misbah for rewarding Imran's violent behaviour, and when she confronts Misbah about it, she snaps at Yasmine that she has had more attention than Imran because of her heart condition and that she should be a little more respectful. After a week, Imran returns feeling confident about himself, but when Oliver wants a place on the team again having been kicked off by Buster for buying the alcohol, Buster decides to play Oliver and Imran against each other to determine who gets the final spot. Sadly, Imran suffers a leg injury from a strong tackle that Oliver does, causing him to be on the bench for a while, and for Oliver to be back on the team. Misbah finds Imran in a bad mood at home just as they are about to celebrate Imran's homecoming, and he has a meltdown about his injury and being kicked off the team, which builds up to more anger, and he throws a football boot at a china lamp, breaking it. Weeks later, Imran gets to know autistic girl Brooke Hathaway (Talia Grant), who Oliver takes a liking to as well, leading both boys to ask her out on a date and for her to accept both. Imran takes a bunch of flowers for Brooke, and she chooses Imran to see. However, Imran sees that Brooke hasn't responded to his messages, and Misbah tries to reassure him. However Oliver appears and begins to joke about Imran's misery over Brooke, winding him up to such an extent that he punches Oliver in the face, right in front of a shocked Misbah. Some time later, Imran and Brooke go on a couple of dates, but the latter one happens to be a disaster when Brooke suffers a sensory overload from the smell of Imran's aftershave. This leads Brooke to run away and in the process, cut her head open. Misbah sees the cut on Brooke's head and immediately jumps to conclusions that Imran was responsible. Imran is so infuriated by his mother thinking this that he lashes out at Misbah again, this time twisting her arm into a Chinese-burn sensation and saying she deserves it. Misbah eventually decides to go to a doctor about her ordeal, but ends up covering for him again by saying that he is skipping school. She is prescribed some anti-anxiety pills. Yasmine sees that Misbah is acting strangely, and she finds out that Imran is still hitting Misbah, so she becomes determined to sort it out. She sneaks Misbah's pills and mixes them into Imran's soup for him to eat. The next day Imran wakes up feeling weird, unaware that Yasmine drugged him. This causes Imran's behaviour to improve to such an extent that Misbah is convinced that his anger is gone, making her decide to throw away her pills, but not before Yasmine sneaks them again. Kameela soon visits the Maaliks again for lunch. At this point, Imran and Brooke are already an item, and have arranged to see each other for lunch, but unfortunately for Imran the lunch with Kameela has clashed with his and Brooke's meeting, so as a compromise Brooke joins the family. Kameela is indifferent to the fact that Imran has a girlfriend, and lays into Sami for setting James up for murder, before she sees Brooke writing in her diary during lunch and wrongly accusing her of copying the conversation word for word. Imran immediately jumps to Brooke's defense, saying Kameela is the worst when it comes to judgement, and Misbah tells Imran to stop throwing tantrums. Brooke runs out in the heat of the argument, despite protests from Imran. As Kameela leaves and berates Misbah for her family being such a shambles, Imran is trying to talk Brooke round, before telling Misbah that she ruined his relationship with Brooke. Yasmine breaks up the argument between Misbah and Imran, and before he can hit anyone, he slams his fist onto the table in anger, which Sami later sees and decides that Imran should be checked in hospital. However, after the check up, it is found out that there are traces of drugs in Imran's system, which makes Yasmine panic, and Misbah as well since she is covering for Yasmine, having just been suspended from her job for wrongly administering drugs. The following day the truth comes out when Imran is practicing boxing as a means of dealing with his anger, when Imran sees a pack of pills fall out of Yasmine's handbag. He quickly realises that Yasmine was drugging him the whole time, and angrily punches Yasmine in the stomach with a boxing glove, causing a massive bruise, which she is forced to keep quiet about by Imran otherwise he will hurt her again.

She was born into the royal household of the Omanhene of Sefwi Bekwai and given her cultural name Awuraba Ama Samma. After a brief education in Ghana, she travelled with her father John Banks Elliott who was appointed as Ghana‚Äôs first Ambassador to Moscow from 1960 to 1966. In Moscow she entered the Bolshoi Ballet School. After finishing school, she performed a few character parts at the Bolshoi Theatre itself. She however opted to graduate as a ballet instructor. She came to the United Kingdom and worked with a number of dance companies including the Redroofs Theatre School for the Performing Arts in Maidenhead, the Central School of Ballet in London and Pineapple Dance Studios in Covent Garden. She later set up her own ballet school in Maidenhead. While working in London, she was spotted by the Artistic Director, of The Australian Ballet for her talent in the arts and gained a contract to teach and direct ballet in Melbourne, Australia. During her 30-year career, she worked with opera and ballet companies throughout the world, supporting various artistic directors on numerous productions as their r√©p√©titeur. Her talent as a r√©p√©titeur earned her a worldwide recognition. She travelled the world teaching and demonstrating Russian classical ballet in such places as the United Kingdom, United States of America, Switzerland, Sweden, France, Portugal, Belgium, Holland, Chile, Greece and Egypt, but to name a few. In association with numerous productions she often worked seasons with companies. Some of these include: Ballet Rambert, The American Ballet Theatre, Les Ballets de Monte Carlo, The Goteborg Opera & Ballet, La Scala Theatre Ballet, Hawaii State Ballet, Alberta Ballet Company, The Cairo Opera Ballet Company, Centro de Danza y Arte de Madrid, British Columbia Ballet BC. She reached the apex of her career and aspiration when she was contracted to teach at the Zurich Opera House, where her partnership with the artistic director/choreographer Uwe Scholz became legendary. She moved to Greece and in 2001 she staged her favourite ballet, Marius Petipa‚Äôs La Bayad√®re for the Greek National Opera. The scene The Kingdom of the Shades produced much acclamation. Under the auspices of the Arts Council of Greece, she directed a company of dancers from Athens to Egypt where the artistic community of Egypt personally acclaimed her.

To achieve this objective, she enrolled at The University of Ghana, School of Performing Arts.

The production took place at the beginning of 2016 in Asturias and it had many limitations since it did not have any official subsidy. The postproduction start 18 January 2016 in China, with further collaborations with Asturias (regarding sound editing), the United States (music composition) and South Africa (graphic design). The main post- production process finishes in August 2016. Scene of Advent (Ad-vientu) in Avil√©s, Asturias, with David Soto Giganto and Ici Diaz. The director, Roberto F. Canuto, mention that the intention they had when they develop the story was that \\"the audience experience the emotions of the main character. For that reason we don't explain the past of the character and the reasons for the perturbed psychology of Suso, but we focus in the emotions, his status of mind in the present and his psychological drama as it happens in the film.\\" We tried to portray the psychological drama that lives within the main character, who is facing the abyss due to the lack of social prospects and future, living a moment in which the ghosts of his past invade his mind. We touch an important and sensitive issue, the issue of suicide...Although we try to understand the psychology of someone in these circumstances, there will almost always be many aspects that escape our reasoning. Hence, we focus on the inner experience of the character, his feelings or lack of understanding and love in their childhood, and his personal environment. We decided to approach the character from the emotional point of view rather than rational. Look throughhis own eyes and feelings, going in depth into his inner world. Picture of Advent (Ad-vientu) with David Soto Giganto. The use of asturian language has a great significance in the film. According to the directors, \\"it is a language that needs to expand and get support to get the status of official language. The use of the language (devoid of a market accent), together with the poetic cinematography and a suggestive music, creates a very special atmosphere\\". The language helps to build the universe of the character, a world where the character is isolated and dreams with recover the happiness of his past. The use of local minority languages is not new in the career of the directors. In their previous works, Ni Jing: Thou Shalt Not Steal (2013) and Floating Melon (2015), shot in China, they managed without the official Mandarin language to use the own dialect of the province of Sichuan, the Sichuanese Mandarin. The title of the film has its etymological origin in the Latin \\"adventus\\" (arrival) and it was used in the old times to announce the arrival of an important character. In Spanish language \\"adviento\\" is used almost exclusively in a religious context, but in English language has the two meanings. To refer to the origin of the word, the original title of the film separates the Latin roots of the word (Ad-ventus). One of the aspects remarkable in the films of the directors is the promotional materials. In the case of \\"Advent\\", the design of the poster, with vibrant colors and mix of textures (that reflect the atmosphere of the film), was carried out by the South African prestigious artist Su Opperman. Music Andrea Centazzo, composer of Advent (Ad-vientu). The author of the soundtrack is the Italian- American composer Andrea Centazzo, a regular collaborator of directors and multi-awarded author, also one of the masters of the avant-garde music. The music express the inner world of Suso, the main character of the film. In the soundtrack include incidental music and experimental compositions, together with some melodic cues, to produce a diversity of emotions parallel to the confusion of feelings of the main character. The collaboration between the directors and the composer started in 2008, Advent being the sixth collaboration, following Mei Mei, Toto Forever, Desire Street, Ni Jing: Thou Shalt Not Steal and Floating Melon.  Reception  The film premiere at the 54th Gij√≥n International Film Festival in Spain, on 25 November 2016.

Background  James W. Brammer appealed a September 13, 1990, Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) decision which denied reopening his claim for service connection for spinal meningitis. BVA also determined that the Veteran was not entitled to service connection for residuals of frozen feet. Mr. Brammer was a combat Veteran of World War II and served in Normandy, Northern France, the Ardennes, the Rhineland, and Central Europe. He originally filed a claim for spinal meningitis in 1980 and was denied by the VA Regional Office (VARO). The VARO noted that the Veteran's records were destroyed in the 1973 National Personnel Records Center fire. A United States military morning report was obtained that showed that the Veteran was in fact hospitalized, but no diagnosis was given. Affidavits from four separate service members, written in the fall of 1980, attested that the Veteran was in fact treated for spinal meningitis. The VARO determined that the affidavits were not sufficient to justify a grant of service connection for spinal meningitis. Afterwards, the Veteran attempted to reopen his claim on numerous occasions, including the last denial on October 19, 1988, in which the VARO denied service connection for spinal meningitis. He appealed this decision to BVA, which held that there was no \\"new and material\\" evidence of record that would reopen the previous denial.  Analysis  The Court noted that no evidence had been presented since the last adjudication on the claim. The Court noted that in all the evidence provided, there was no evidence showing that there was a current disability. All the evidence in favor of the Veteran only attempted to establish that he was treated for spinal meningitis at one time. Since there was no evidence of a current disability, the Court affirmed the BVA decision.  Decision  The Court affirmed BVA's decision that there was no new and material evidence to reopen the claim.

In addition to oil paintings, he did much of what would now be called \\"handicraft\\" work, as the concept of painter-as-artist was not yet established in Norway.

She studies the impact of tax and transfer programs on low-income families, particularly single parent families. She was the 2014 winner of the Carolyn Shaw Bell Award from the Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession. She has been a co-editor of the American Economic Review, co-editor of American Economic Journal:Economic Policy, Associate editor of Journal of Public Economics and Journal of Economic Perspectives. Hoynes was one of the signees of a 2018 amici curiae brief that expressed support for Harvard University in the Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard lawsuit. Other signees of the brief include Alan B. Krueger, Robert M. Solow, George A. Akerlof, Janet Yellen, as well as numerous others. Research Her research has covered every major government anti- poverty program in the United States, including The Earned Income Tax Credit, Food Stamps, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and has examined outcomes such as labor supply, employment, marriage, divorce, infant health, and education. She has found that people who lived in counties that adopted the Food Stamp program before their third birthday had better health later in life. Hoynes and her co-authors Almond and Schanzenbach were the first to contribute to the idea that FSP improves birth weights. They saw that the group receiving the FSP(treated) reduced the low birth weight by 7% for whites and between 5% and 11% for blacks. The authors do mention that not all treatment effects are statically significant; still they point to improvements in birth weights following the introduction of the Food Stamp Program. In her research with Almond and Schanzenbach they also explain that recipients of the FSP who are infra-marginal see in-kind transfers, like FSP, as an equivilant to cash; with this the authors expect an increase in both food consumption and normal goods. The Earned Income Tax Credit does much more to encourage parents' work and to reduce poverty among children at a lower cost to the federal budget than the Child Tax Credit and that Head Start. Preschool programs have longer-lasting impacts for children who do not speak English at home, Hoynes describes the EITC as the \\"cornerstone of U.S anti-poverty policy\\". Hoynes and Ankur J. Patel found that the 1993 expansion of the EITC increased employment for single mothers with less than a college degree by 6.1 percentage points. She suggests that there is growing evidence that the EITC improves children's cognitive outcomes and educational achievement from elementary school through college. Since the Great Recession, Hoynes' research has focused on the performance of anti-poverty programs in recessions. Hoynes has research affiliations at the National Bureau of Economic Research, the University of California, Davis Center for Poverty Research and the Institute for Fiscal Studies. She serves on the National Advisory Committee of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Scholars in Health Policy Research Program and the Advisory Committee for the National Science Foundation's Directorate for the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences.

Her motto was \\"For Thee, Lord.\\" = Calling = Following the death of her grandmother, Kearney turned toward thoughts of religious life. She believed that God was calling her to be a sister, and she applied for admission to the Franciscan Sisters in St Mary's Abbey, Mill Hill, London. She volunteered to work with African Americans in London. She waited three years for a posting to the American mission, but when the call from a foreign mission came, it came from Africa. = Missionary work =  Path to Uganda  On December 3, 1902, Kearney and five other sisters left London for Nsambya, Uganda. They were chosen at the request of Bishop Hanlon of the Mill Hill Fathers. The sisters arrived on January 15, 1903 and established a dispensary and school in the Buganda. \\"Their task was to care for the women and girls and to further weaken the association of Catholicism with French missionaries and Protestantism with British missionaries in the then British Protectorate.\\" Among the sisters were three Irish, one American, one English, and one Scottish woman. Kearney started her first clinic under a mango tree near the convent. The first seven years of missionary work were tough for the sisters. Various diseases, from smallpox to malaria, ravaged Buganda. The infant mortality rate was also relatively high due to the high frequency of maternal deaths. In 1906, Kearney expanded the missionary and set up a hospital in Nagalama, twenty-three miles away. Following Sister Paul's illness and return to the United States in 1910, Kearney was appointed the new superior of the convent. In 1913, three more sisters arrived, which allowed Kearney to establish a third mission station in Kamuli, Busoga. All three stations focused on medicine and education for the local population with a focus on primary and secondary education, training of nurses, and the founding of clinics, hospitals and orphanages.  Role in World War 1  During World War 1, the Nsambya Hospital was used to treat the Native Carrier Corp, porters for European troops. At times, Kearney was outraged by the treatment Europeans gave to the African porters. She worked to uphold the rights of African people caught up in the European war. On December 25, 1918 Kearney was awarded the MBE, Member of Order of British Empire, for her services to the wounded during the war years.  Promotion of female education  Kearney is credited for promoting higher education in Catholic African women in her mission. In 1923, she founded the Little Sisters of St. Francis, a community of African nuns for teaching and nursing. This program started with only eight local girls. A year later, Kearney and Dr. Evelyn Connolly, a lay missionary, founded a nursing and midwifery school in Nsambya. Their goal was to promote the education of women throughout Uganda.  Creation of Franciscan Missionary Sisters for Africa  Mount Oliver, Dundalk motherhouse In September 1928, Kearney returned to England to establish a novitiate exclusively for training sisters for African missions. The novitiate was officially opened in 1929 in Holme Hall, Yorkshire. Many women from England, Scotland and Ireland travelled to Holme Hall to assist the missionary efforts. This created a shortage for the Mill Hill Fathers, who also needed sisters for their school in England and American missions. Upon realization of this divide, Kearney and the Mill Hill Fathers broke off from each other. On June 9, 1952 the new congregation of the Franciscan Missionary Sisters for Africa was founded by Kearney. Kearney was appointed the first superior-general. Mount Oliver, Dundalk, became the motherhouse for this new congregation. With the formation of the FMSA, Kearney expanded the missionary to Uganda, Kenya, Zambia, the US, Scotland, and South Africa.  Retirement  Photograph of Teresa Kearney in the mid-twentieth century Kearney retired in 1955 at age 80. During retirement, she was appointed Superior of a Boston Convent in 1955 and raised funds for African projects. She travelled and talked to donors to garner support for projects in Africa. = Death = On October 17, 1957, Kearney died at the age of 82 in Brighton, Massachusetts. Her remains were flown to Ireland and buried at Mount Oliver. Ugandan Catholics rallied to have her body flown to Uganda to be buried. On December 3, 1957, Kearney's body was buried in the cemetery at Nkokonjeru, the motherhouse of the Little Sisters of St. Francis. = Legacy = Photograph of current members of FMSA Kearney's legacy is evident today. In Uganda, the word Kevina means \\"hospital\\" or \\"charitable institute\\". The Mother Kevin Postgraduate Medical School was named after Mother Kevin (Teresa Kearney). The Little Sisters of St. Francis currently now has over 500 members throughout Africa. The Franciscan Missionary Sisters for Africa currently works in Uganda, Kenya, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa. = Awards = In 1918, Kearney was made Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for her work during the war. In 1955 she received Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE), as well as Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE). In 1955, she was also awarded the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice from Pious XI, for her Catholic work in Uganda.

The nonprofit organization supports in a scholarship youths - mostly young women - in Adigrat in the north Of Ethiopia, who are disadvantaged for various reasons, and accompanies them financially and ideally during their studies at a university or their education. The project is funded mainly by current and former students at the university. It is largely funded by donations.  History  Street scene in Adigrat, 2014 The idea for the educational project was developed in 2010 during a research trip on the subject of AIDS by the then head of the IWM, Albert-Peter Rethmann. It was in the context of a research project of the German Bishops' Conference (German: Deutsche Bischofskonferenz) in Adigrat in Tigray Region in northern Ethiopia. In this region, many young people have no access to higher education due to lack of family support, many are AIDS orphans. Young women are particularly affected by this situation through discrimination. An initiative of the Adigrat Diocesan Catholic Secretariat (ADCS) of the Ethiopian Catholic Eparchy of Adigrat has already supported ten young people with micro-scholarships for obtaining a university entrance qualification and at least one bachelor's degree in their own country. One of the sponsored students was the AIDS orphan Rahel Hailay. The result of the journey resulting from the trip was an international initiative of students for students in the age of globalization as an overall project. In November 2017, the project was announced to be phasing out. In a farewell letter to the donors, the Rahel team wrote that it expected its work to be gradually taken over by the Adigrat Diocesan Catholic Secretariat (ADCS) and former graduates in Ethiopia. The Rahel team conveyed the same message on Facebook in January 2018, clarifying that it would not accept any further donations.Posting on the initiative's Facebook page, 28 January 2018.  Target  The project supports disadvantaged, primarily female, young people in the Tigray Region who lack equal access to education for reasons of poverty or gender. The financial support consists of micro- scholarships. The scholarship holders are accompanied during their studies or education. The name of the project comes from Rahel Hailay, who completed the study of biology and zoology at the universities in Axum and Mek'ele from 2009 to 2014. By 2015 the training of 47 young Ethiopians had been made possible. Nowadays the promotion of 40 young people at the same time is possible. In addition to financial support, an important further aspect is the promotion of networking among scholarship holders and the promotion of ethical behaviour in Christian sense. Through women who are given a higher level of education through this project, others should be given the idea of achieving a higher level of education. This development cooperation is intended to give freedom to the beneficiaries without material needs and making their lives self- responsible. An important factor for a lasting effect is, in particular, the motivation of those who want this development. Central is therefore the promotion of the autonomy and self-initiative of the scholarship holders in the sense of the Catholic social doctrine. The initiative of the students from Germany can serve as a model for the students in Ethiopia. It is possible that the project will in the future develop into an Ethiopian alumni project where graduates who are in work assist other young people in their education. As a secondary effect, training programs such as the Rahel project are also a medium to long-term contribution to the fight against become a refugee due to lack of education and resulting poverty.  Funding, support and public relations  Ethiopian coffee ceremony in Tigray Region, 2012 The educational project is financed through public donations and campaigns, such as at the Frankfurter Stadtkirchenfest at Frankfurt Cathedral (German: Kaiserdom St. Bartholom√§us), collects in Catholic church parishes and the Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality of the Diocese of Limburg, as well as the salvation of festivities such as the summer festival of the Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology with an Ethiopian coffee ceremony, auctions and other revenues. In addition, these actions also serve to create new contacts, information and exchange on the project. These actions are also supported by the Network of Frankfurt One World Groups in Frankfurt. The Rachel educational project is funded by the Cusanuswerk, a gifted support program under the supervision of the Catholic German Bishops' Conference and by the Center for Christian Meditation and Spirituality of the Diocese of Limburg. The project is supported by the Pontifical Mission Societies (German: missio) in all financial matters, such as account management, the administrative costs or the transfer of money to Ethiopia. In addition to the internet, public relations activities also include media such as Radio Horeb.  Realisation in Ethiopia  Ethiopian Catholic Eparchy of Adigrat In Ethiopia the project is referred to as an OVC project (orphans and vulnerable children). It is supervised locally by the Adigrat Diocesan Catholic Secretariat (ADCS) of the Ethiopian Catholic Eparchy of Adigrat under the patronage of the diocesan bishop Tesfay Medhin. The OVC project is active in the areas of Adigrat and other areas particularly affected by poverty. The project manager of the ADCS Woldemariam Besirat selects the scholarship holders and organizes religious education workshops on scholarship meetings with their own and external lecturers on topics such as AIDS, the consequences of emigration as refugees or on other medical or ethical issues. In addition to financial support, the promotion of self-reliance, self-confidence and self-esteem, the promotion of self-responsibility, the awareness of responsibility and the ability to work together are important aspects of the work of the OVC project.

It protects an area of dry forest beside a major reservoir that supplies water to the state capital. Location The Altamiro de Moura Pacheco State Park is divided between the municipalities of Goian√°polis, Ner√≥polis and Goi√¢nia. It has an area of . The park is named for Altamiro de Moura Pacheco, physician, pharmacist, writer, cattle rancher and Goian politician, former owner of the area. It is also known as the Goi√¢nia Ecological Park (). Highway BR-153 runs through the park, and provides the main land access route. Vegetation is mainly seasonal semi-deciduous forest and gallery forest. 485 species of plant have been recorded, in 315 genera and 97 families. Dry forest species such as Aspidosperma and Tabebuia species predominate. Most of the vegetation is dry forest and canopy forest, cerrado restricted sense, cerrad√£o and capoeira, as well as some degraded areas that were converted to pasture. Over 290 species of animals have been identified including the endangered giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) and cougar (Puma concolor). The park may be used for trekking, nature watching, biking and mountain biking. Guided tours may be arranged. It has beautiful landscapes, with waterfalls, but there is no waterfall or lake where bathing is allowed. Trails include the Lago Trail, suitable for cycling, the Peba Trail for a short walk and the Coati Trail. All of these are easy. The longer Eucalyptus Trail is more difficult. The park has a visitor center with restrooms and drinking water, but there is no restaurant. As of 2016 the park was open from 8am to 4pm, Wednesday to Sunday, with free admission. History The site of a pre-colonial village has been found that was probably occupied from 500 to 1500 AD by Indians of the southern Kayap√≥ community, or at least of the Aratu tradition. They were farmers and ceramicists. Relics include a funeral urn and a ritual mask made of vegetable fibers. The site was vacated after the arrival of the Portuguese. Later the area was occupied by the Fazenda Dois Irm√£os, used for agriculture and cattle raising. The state park was created by law 11.471 of 3 July 1991 and defined by law 11.878 of 30 December 1992. At first it was called the Ulysses Guimaraes Ecology, Environment and Forest Preservation Park, then the Goi√¢nia Ecological Park. In May 1994 part of the park was removed to make way for the Ribeir√£o Jo√£o Leite Reservoir, planned to supply water to the Metropolitan Region of Goi√¢nia, the state capital. The park was reduced in size to . Law 13,846 of 1 June 2001 renamed it the Altamiro de Moura Pacheco Ecological and Environmental Protection State Park. It is administered by the state Department of the Environment (Semarh). The purpose is to protect the largest remnant of dry forest in the central region of the state, and to protect the Jo√£o Leite Reservoir, which provides water for over one million people. In 2010 a fire burned much of the vegetation and the park was closed. It reopened in January 2012. At the opening ceremony Governor Marconi Perillo announced that the park and other conservation units in the state would be jointly managed with the private sector, in line with global trends. An open, democratic and transparent bidding process would be used to select the private manager of the park. State law 18.462 of 9 May 2014 created the Jo√£o Leite State Park with an area of from part of the area taken for the reservoir. The two parks now total .

Fake news in the United States became a global subject and was widely introduced to billions as a prominent issue, especially due to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. President Donald Trump tweeted or retweeted posts about \\"fake news\\" or \\"fake media\\" 176 times as of December 20, 2017, according to an online archive of all of Trump's tweets. Governmental bodies in the U.S. and Europe started looking at contingencies and regulations to combat fake news specially when as part of a coordinated intelligence campaign by hostile foreign governments. Online tech giants Facebook and Google started putting in place means to combat fake news in 2016 as a result of the phenomenon becoming globally known. Media scholar Dr. Nolan Higdon argues that relying on tech-companies to solve the issues with false information will exacerbate the problems associated with fake news. Higdon contends that tech-companies lack an incentive for solving the problem because they benefit from the proliferation of fake news. Higdon cites tech-companies utilization of data collection as one of the strongest forces empowering fake news producers. Rather than government regulation or industry censorship, Higdon argues for the introduction of critical news literacy education to American education. Google Trends shows that the term \\"fake news\\" gained traction in online searches in October 2016. Professor Philip N. Howard of the Oxford Internet Institute at the University of Oxford studied web traffic in the United States prior to the election. He found that about one half of all news on Twitter directed at Michigan was junk or fake, and the other half came from actual professional news sources. According to BuzzFeed, during the last three months of the presidential campaign, of the top twenty fake election-related articles on Facebook, seventeen were anti-Clinton or pro-Trump. Facebook users interacted with them more often than with stories from genuine news outlets. Debate over the impact of fake news in the election, and whether or not it significantly impacted the election of the Republican candidate Donald Trump, whom the most shared fake stories favored, led researchers from Stanford to study the impact of fake news shared on social media, where 62% of U.S. adults get their news from. They assessed that 8% of readers of fake news recalled and believed in the content they were reading, though the same share of readers also recalled and believed in \\"placebos\\" ‚Äî stories they did not actually read, but that were produced by the authors of the study. In comparison, over 50% of the participants recalled reading and believed in true news stories. The authors do not assess the final impact of these numbers on the election, but seek to \\"offer theoretical and empirical background\\" for the debate. In the United States in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, fake news was particularly prevalent and spread rapidly over social media by \\"bots\\", according to researchers at the Oxford Internet Institute. In a speech shortly after the election, former Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton warned of the \\"real-world consequences\\" of fake news. Shortly thereafter, in the early weeks of his presidency, Donald Trump frequently used the term \\"fake news\\" to refer to traditional news media, singling out CNN. Linguist George Lakoff says this creates confusion about the phrase's meaning. According to CBS 60 Minutes, President Trump may use the term fake news to describe any news, however legitimate or responsible, with which he may disagree. After Republican Colorado state senator Ray Scott used the term as a reference to a column in the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel, the newspaper's publisher threatened a defamation lawsuit. In December 2016, an armed North Carolina man, Edgar Maddison Welch, traveled to Washington, D.C., and opened fire at the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria, driven by a fake online news story known as the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which accused the pizzeria of hosting a pedophile ring run by Democratic Party leaders. These stories tend to go viral quickly. Social media systems, such as Facebook, play a large role in the broadcasting of fake news. These systems show users content that reflects their interests and history, leading to fake and misleading news. Following a plea agreement with prosecutors, Welch pleaded guilty to the federal charge of interstate transport of firearms and a District of Columbia charge of assault with a dangerous weapon. Welch was sentenced to four years in prison on June 22, 2017 and agreed to pay $5,744.33 for damages to the restaurant. A situation study by The New York Times shows how a tweet by a person with no more than 40 followers went viral and was shared 16,000 times on Twitter. The tweet concluded that protesters were paid to be bussed to Trump demonstrations and protest. A Twitter user then posted a photograph of two buses outside a building, claiming that those were the Anti-Trump protesters. The tweet immediately went viral on both Twitter and Facebook. Fake news can easily spread due to the speed and accessibility of modern communications technology. A CNN investigation examined exactly how fake news can start to trend. There are \\"bots\\" used by fake news publishers that make their articles appear more popular than they are. This makes it more likely for people to discover them. \\"Bots are fake social media accounts that are programmed to automatically 'like' or retweet a particular message.\\" An investigation by The Michigan Daily in October 2019 into statewide networks of conservative-leaning, pseudo local news sites, published by Locality Labs and the Metric Media Foundation, revealed connections between the operation and Dan Proft, the Liberty Principles PAC, and the Nexstar Media Group. Metric Media is reportedly planning on creating more sites across the nation in what critics have dubbed a disinformation campaign that may be attempting to influence 2020 elections. Fraudulent stories during the 2016 U.S. presidential election included a viral post popularized on Facebook that Pope Francis had endorsed Trump, and another that actor Denzel Washington \\"backs Trump in the most epic way possible\\". Trump's son and campaign surrogate Eric Trump, top national security adviser Michael Flynn, and then-campaign managers Kellyanne Conway and Corey Lewandowski shared fake news stories during the campaign. Starting in July 2017, the 2020 presidential campaign launched Real News Update, an online news program posted on Facebook. The series reports on Trump's accomplishments as president of the United States and claims to highlight \\"real news\\" as opposed to alleged \\"fake news\\". Lara Trump introduced one video by saying \\"If you are tired of all the fake news out there...we are going to bring you nothing but the facts\\" and \\"I bet you haven't heard about all the accomplishments the president had this week, because there's so much fake news out there\\". The show was labeled as \\"propaganda\\". In January 2018, it was reported that a Gallup-Knight Foundation survey found that 17% of Democrats and 42% of Republicans \\"consider accurate news stories that cast a politician or political group in a negative light to always be 'fake news.'\\" A June 2018 poll by Axios and Survey Monkey found that 72% of Americans believe \\"traditional news outlets knowingly report false or misleading stories at least sometimes,\\" with 92% of Republican and Republican-leaning independents and 53% of Democrats believing this. A series of fabricated stories in Europe‚Äôs largest weekly magazine, Der Spiegel, prompted U.S. ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell to call for an independent investigation.

Biography Mortaigne was born in 1609, to a Flemish Lutheran family. Mortaigne became a squire of Prince Philipp, son of Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, while he was pursuing a military education in the Netherlands. On 17 August 1626, Philipp was killed while fighting for the Protestant side at the Battle of Lutter. Following his master's death Mortaigne entered the service of Sweden, becoming colonel in 1637. The course of the Swedish intervention into the Thirty Years' War was abruptly interrupted in the aftermath of the 10 May 1641 death of Johan Ban√©r, the commander of the Swedish expeditionary force. Mortaigne became a leader of a large scale mutiny which paralyzed the Swedish army, demanding the immediate payment of their arrears. In July 1641, Mortaigne and Adam von Pfuhl were invited into Stockholm as representative of the mutineers. Mortaigne was promoted into brigadier general and received land in Pomerania, while the rest of the army was paid the sum of 486,200 thalers settling the crown's debts. During the course of 1642, Mortaigne took part in the second Battle of Breitenfeld and was later severely injured during an engagement in the vicinity of Brieg. In 1643, Mortaigne's forces ravaged through Moravia. On 12 February 1645, he was captured by an Imperial patrol outside Borna while carrying a portfolio of important documents. He was released on ransom, later commanding the Swedish center at the Battle of Jankau. In 1646, he returned to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel with the approval of Christina, Queen of Sweden, receiving the rank of general-lieutenant. He led Hesse-Kassel's troops during the Hessian War. On 10 July 1647, a cannonball crushed his left leg, gravely wounding him while he was besieging the Rheinfels Castle.

Eventually, in 2004 then-Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed a new commission who reached similar recommendations, and which were adopted and implemented. Subsequent commissions were also pushed for and supported by TheMarker, e.g. the 2011 Trajtenberg Committee, which recommended that banking sector concentration be confronted. This recommendation was adopted the same year with the creation of another committee (the ‚ÄúZaken Committee‚Äù), which called for a few steps meant to increase competition in the banking sector and cut consumer costs. Additionally, in June 2015 a new committee was formed (the ‚ÄúStrum Committee‚Äù), whose recommendations to force banks to sell their credit card companies were adopted too (see below). Nochi Dankner and Danny Dankner Concentration of economic power was mostly associated with the Dankner family, that together controlled around $100 billion, or a fifth of all financial assets in Israel at the time.

Outside the U.S. and the U.K., pyramidal control structures, cross shareholding and super voting rights are common. Using these devices, a family can control corporations without making a commensurate capital investment. In many countries, such families end up controlling considerable proportions of their countries‚Äô economies. Three points emerge. First, at the firm level, these ownership structures vest dominant control rights with families who often have little real capital invested ‚Äì creating agency and entrenchment problem simultaneously. In addition, controlling shareholders can divert corporate resources for private benefits using transactions within the pyramidal group. The result is a poor utilization of resources. At the economy level, extensive control of corporate assets by a few families distorts capital allocation and reduces the rate of innovation. The result is an economy-wide misallocation of resources, and slower economic growth. Second, political influence is plausibly related to what one controls, rather than what one owns. The controlling owners of pyramids thus have greatly amplified political influence relative to their actual wealth. They appear to influence the development of both public policy, such as property rights protection and enforcement, and institutions like capital markets.\\"Corporate Governance, Economic Entrenchment, and Growth .

TheMarker (January 24, 2012, Hebrew). Retrieved on 2018-11-8. According to the document, economic concentration raises the risk of regulatory capture and media capture. The brief asserts that business groups that gain significant economic power can have power vis-√†-vis the regulators and that businesses that have investments and holdings in the news media in their portfolio may potentially have influence over politicians and regulators. The concepts related to the connection between economy-wide concentration and economic policy and regulation were a main theme in the campaign of TheMarker. In 2014, Samuel Neaman Institute, a leading research institute within Israel's Technion, awarded Rolnik a grant to conduct a study on the connection between regulatory capture and concentration. Rolnik wrote the study in Harvard University, where he was a fellow in 2014-2015. In January 2015 Rolnik presented the findings in the keynote address of Israel's Antitrust Authority annual event with his co-author, Dr. Roy Shapira from Harvard Law School. The counter-campaign Among all major Israeli newspapers, TheMarker was the only one that put concentration on the agenda, primed it and framed it as harmful to the economy and as an issue that is not partisan. Other newspapers ignored or opposed it. The counter-campaign was led by Globes and Yedioth Ahronoth. Between 1999 and 2016 Globes was controlled by Israeli tycoon Eliezer Fishman. Fishman was also the second-biggest investor in Yedioth Ahronoth, which is controlled by Arnon (Noni) Mozes and was for four decades the most popular and powerful newspaper in Israel. In late 2016, following the collapse of Fishman's business empire, court documents that were handed to the court by him and the banks that lent him money, revealed that, in the decade prior to its collapse, Fishman's debts to banks were much larger than his assets and that he had trouble paying them off. The Israeli investigative television program Uvda included testimonies of journalists that said that Globes‚Äô editorial line was meant to thwart reforms meant to increase banking reforms and contain the power of Israel's biggest businesspeople. This helped in insulating Fishman and his lender banks and letting him maintain control of his empire for a decade even though it was, in fact, owned by Israel's banking duopoly ‚Äì Hapoalim and Leumi. According to HaAyin HaShevi'it, TheMarker is the only newspaper who fought against concentration while most newspapers tried to delegitimize it or to water it down. In February 2010, HaAyin HaShevi'it wrote that when an economics commentator of one newspaper mocks the idea of concentration, ‚Äúit is clear to all who he is pointing his arrows at: TheMarker‚Äù.◊û◊ß◊§◊ô◊ì◊ô◊ù ◊ú◊î◊õ◊ó◊ô◊©.

In the meantime, many of its original members left, three of which for high-paid positions in the private sector: Rony Hizkiyahu and Udi Nissan left for the Yitzhak Tshuva group and Zohar Goshen started consulting Nochi Dankner. Following the July 2011 social justice protests, and in order to respond to the protesters‚Äô demands, Netanyahu replaced the positions that were vacated. In October 2011 the committee issued its interim report and issued its final report in February 2012. The social protests and the Trajtenberg Committee In July 2011, a wave of social protests, the biggest in Israel's history, erupted and swept the country for almost two months. Its peak came on September 3, 2011, when about half a million protesters went to the streets in many cities across the country. The demonstrators, who adopted the slogan ‚ÄúThe people demands social justice‚Äù, protested the high cost of living, especially housing and food, against inequality, against the banking system and against concentration. Seeing the protests as a threat to his government, Netanyahu formed, in August 2011, the ‚ÄúCommittee for Economic and Social change‚Äù, which was tasked with examining and proposing solutions to Israel's socio-economic problems.

Black (born 1927), a native of Hickman, Kentucky, was the fifth president (1973‚Äì1992) of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, the headquarters of the Fifth District of the Federal Reserve System. He was preceded in that position by Aubrey N. Heflin and succeeded by J. Alfred Broaddus (1993‚Äì2004) and Jeffrey Lacker (August 1, 2004 ‚Äì April 4, 2017). Education and teaching After cutting short his initial studies at the University of Virginia and serving in the United States Army, Black returned to UVA and earned a bachelor's degree, master's degree, and doctorate in economics. In 1955 he taught for one year at the University of Tennessee. He completed his Ph.D. dissertation in 1954 after beginning his work at the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank. Career and community activities At the Fed, Black became an assistant vice president, vice president, and first-vice president before becoming the president of the FRB Richmond branch. Black and his two successors as president of the Richmond Fed, J. Alfred Broaddus and Jeffrey Lacker, discussed in an interview for the Richmond Times-Dispatch the changes that occurred in economic trends, the banking community, and the city of Richmond during their tenures at the bank. According to Charles L. Weise, in April 1978, following President Carter's announcement of an anti-inflation package, the economist Stephen Axilrod, who was the FRB Staff Director for Monetary and Financial Policy, argued that a reduction in the target range for M1 would add credibility to the administration's inflation targets, while an increase in ranges \\"would not appear supportive\\" of the program. Robert P. Black, then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, urged the Federal Open Market Committee to focus on inflation to take advantage of the fact that \\"everybody thinks that the administration, Congress, and the Federal Reserve are all committed to fighting inflation as a primary target.\\" The Fed did indeed begin to tighten in the summer of 1978\\\\. By August the federal funds rate began to rise at a rate faster than the increase in inflation for the first time since the 1974 disinflation attempt. In 1990, Black, who was considered an \\"inflation hawk\\" testified in support of United States House of Representatives Joint Resolution 409, sponsored by Congressman Stephen Neal, a Democrat from North Carolina, which would have required the Federal Reserve Bank to achieve zero inflation within five years of passage. He was the first economist to become a Richmond FRB president. As president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond his opinion as an inflation hawk was highly respected, and he was often interviewed about the direction of the U.S. economy. He served on the board of directors of the Richmond Eye and Ear Hospital, Retreat Health Systems, the Virginia Inter-Government Institute, the Governor's Commission on Defense Conversion and Economic Adjustment, and the Virginia Economic Recovery Commission. He was a member of the advisory boards of the Health Corporation of Virginia, the Center for Advanced Studies of the University of Virginia, and J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College Educational Foundation. He served on the board of governors and executive committee of the Capital Area Assembly and was a board trustee of the Academy for Economic Education and board chairman of Virginia United Methodist Homes.

It was directed by Evan Lofback. The film premiered at the Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum on September 9, 2016.  Background  The film was conceived by amateur videographer Evan Lofback in April 2014 as part of a Facebook campaign to create an \\"open source\\" documentary using material provided by fans of the locomotive. The project gained traction in the railfan community shortly afterwards and soon had the support of several notable individuals and organizations, including the Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum, Norfolk Southern Railway, and the Southern Railway Historical Association. The small production team was composed entirely of volunteers, which contributed to an abnormally long production time. Interviews had to be arranged and material had to be collected gradually as volunteers had the time to do so. Alternatively, the use of volunteers resulted in limited to no production costs (as there was no budget). After 18 months of production, the film premiered as part of Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum's annual Railfest event on September 9, 2016. The filmmakers had guaranteed that the completed documentary would be released free to the public as part of the \\"open source\\" nature of the project. Following the premiere on September 9, the documentary was made available free to the public on YouTube at midnight on September 10, 2016.  Release  The film was released on DVD in America on December 13, 2016 via the Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum (both online and in their gift shop). The release features a two-disc set containing the entire documentary and over 80 minutes of bonus features.  Plot  The film follows the history of Southern Railway 4501 from its construction in 1911 all the way up to its restoration and operation in 2014. The locomotive served the Southern Railway and the Kentucky & Tennessee Railway before being purchased by a small group of railroad enthusiasts from Chattanooga in 1964. Following its relocation to Chattanooga, the engine was restored by the newly formed Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum and returned to service in 1966. Through the support of the Southern Railway (and later Norfolk Southern Railway), the locomotive began operating excursions over the railroad's main lines until 1994 when the excursion program ended. The locomotive was removed from service in 1998. With the introduction of Norfolk Southern Railway's 21st Century Steam program in 2011, the 4501 underwent an extensive restoration in an effort to return it to service. Test runs were performed in September 2014 and the locomotive returned to the main line in May 2015. Unfortunately, the excursion program was again ended by Norfolk Southern in early 2016 after just one season of mainline operation for the 4501. The locomotive continues to operate semi- regularly at the Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum. The film focuses on several different aspects of the locomotive's history, most notably the relationships that different people had with the engine and with each other.  Interviews  A total of eight interviews were conducted with different railroad employees, volunteers, and historians. They include (in order of appearance): * Shane Meador - Restoration Project Manager * Steve Freer - Operations Coordinator, TVRM * George Walker - General Manager, TVRM * Robert Soule III - Son of Bob Soule, Jr. (early TVRM member who was integral to the plot) * Jason Sobczynski - Lead Restoration Project Contractor * Grady Ragan - Early TVRM Member (contemporary of Paul Merriman and Bob Soule, Jr.) * Tim Andrews - President, TVRM * Donald Purdie - Son of Bill Purdie (Southern Railway employee who was integral to the plot)  Reception  Jim Wrinn of Trains Magazine gave the documentary a positive review, noting that it \\"sparkles with its depth and appreciation for the subject.\\" He also said that the film would be a landmark in the history of American railway preservation. Norfolk Southern, Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum, and others also provided positive reviews and helped share the free video on social media, where it quickly became popular amongst the railfan community.

Their worldwide releases include Skeleton Key (2012) and Human (2016) which are both EP's. The band currently consists of Zach Constable (Lead Vocals), Patrick Koch (Guitar/Backing Vocals), George Koch (Guitar/Backing Vocals), Matthew Alsop (Drums/Backing Vocals), David Shrader (bass), and Chris Nyack (Synth/Keys/Backing Vocals). Similar artists include Shinedown, Foo Fighters, Stone Temple Pilots, Linkin Park, Alter Bridge, Seether, and Nickelback. Other artists referenced in similarity are Three Days Grace and Alice In Chains.  History  Calisus is a band that came to establish itself in Active Rock in 2009 when they reincarnated a previous band that was more pop/alternative rock. They wrote and recorded various rock tracks while independently booking a full tour. The band hit venues up and down the East Coast and Midwest of the US playing mostly originals as they tried to find what their footing and identity was going to be in the rock scene. The dates included stops in MD, VA, WV, PA, OH, NY, NC, SC, GA, and TN. Before this, the band had previously done a west coast tour up and down California, Washington State, and Portland, OR while rounding out a sound, including stops at North Beach Fest and the legendary Boom Boom Room in San Francisco.  Releases  Calisus has two Official Worldwide multi-track releases. The first one titled Skeleton Key is an EP produced by Casey Sabol (formerly lead singer of Grammy nominated metal band Periphery), current singer and producer of New Guns of the Old West. The second worldwide release is the 2016 EP titled Human. This ten song \\"Deluxe\\" EP featured nine new recordings plus one radio edit. On February 1, 2018, Calisus released their new single \\"Now or Never\\" which debuted on 101.5 Bob Rocks FM (WBHB). = Skeleton Key (2012) = Unhappy with their completed 2011 LP (recorded in 2010) The Disposition, the band decided to scrap the entire $20k self funded recording; opting to write and record new material. The band took a trip to Memphis, TN for inspiration. In Memphis, they spent a lot of time with their friend and fellow musician Jason Hughes (from the charting band Dust For Life), member of the critically acclaimed Driving Into Eternity at that time. Rejuvenated with new tracks and a more focused musical direction, the band hired long time friend Justin Gosnell of Vestascension to engineer. It was shortly after which they decided to hire mutual friend Casey Sabol to produce the EP. Mixed and Mastered by the commercially successful Brandon Paddock, the EP featured 6 songs marking a broad approach to modern rock, featuring two anthems, two ballads, and two heavy hitters. Post release included a music video for the title track, supporting show dates, and distribution of over 6,000 copies independently with no label support. The band garnered regional acclaim and consistent radio play of the singles Skeleton Key and Feeding the Strain from the likes of WBHB 101.5FM (Bob Rocks), WQCM 94.3FM and Jango Radio, Extreme Metal Works of the singles Better Part of Me and Dirt; as well as various other online and terrestrial radio stations (commercial and non- commercial) spinning the title track. After the release of Skeleton Key, Matthew Alsop (aka Maat Himself) joined the band as a bassist after his sabbatical in Germany so that Zach could be more mobile during live performances. About six months later, they parted ways with their drummer and Maat took his place as the official drummer. = Human (2016) = In mid 2015, with Zach back on bass duties and Maat on the drums, Calisus announced they started the writing and recording process for their yet to be named EP between playing shows with bands like Hoobastank and Saving Abel. It was decided that co-founder/guitarist Patrick Koch was going to produce the record and they began drum sessions at The Acid Lab in Frederick, MD. Upon completion of the drum tracks, recording was moved to Hybrid Soundscape Studios (Patrick's studio) in Hagerstown, MD for the remaining sessions. After updates of guitar and bass sessions (with Patrick, George Koch, & Zach Constable sharing engineering duties) via the band's Facebook page, they took a break from the studio and welcomed David Shrader to the band as their bassist so that Zach could be more mobile during live performances. It was during this time that the band worked on another new track to and booked a busy performance schedule. It was announced in the summer of 2016 that the album was completed and would be released regionally in August 2016 and a worldwide release would follow in 2017. = Now or Never - Single (2018) = On February 1, 2018, Calisus debuted their new single \\"Now or Never\\" on 101.5 Bob Rocks FM (WBHB) with on air personality \\"Crazy Bob\\" with a sixth member present. It was also noted on their Facebook the addition of Chris Nyack as their keyboardist/synth player. According to the notes in the description of the Official Lyric Video, the track was written and composed by Calisus & Rob Figarola, Produced by Patrick Koch, and recorded at Patrick's studio Hybrid Soundscape Studios. Now or Never was picked up in late February by Rock Rage Radio as well as 101.5 Bob Rocks FM for rotation. Music video In 2012, Calisus shot and release an official music video for the title track Skeleton Key, coinciding with the EP's release. The video was directed by Christopher Poloni.

Industry Significance  Rob Figarola (A&R; of The Weeknd, Imagine Dragons, Mackelmore), posted on his YouTube page (Restless Rob) a recommendation video made by Patrick and Maat of Calisus where they announce they have been working together developing the band. This video was published after the release of the Human EP and prior to the release of the single Now or Never.  Influences  The band has posted on Facebook and spoken in interviews streamed live on Facebook regarding their musical influences from more modern rock artists such as Stone Temple Pilots, Smashing Pumpkins, Foo Fighters, and Shinedown, as well as classic artists such as Dio, Def Leppard, and Bad Company. The band states in a video description on their YouTube that The Eagles and Glenn Frey are a big influence not only from a musical perspective, but a business perspective as well.

History Queen's Park School was built in 1873 for the Cathcart Parish School Board and opened officially in 1876, with the original building located on Grange Road in the Battlefield neighbourhood of the city, opposite the public park after which it was named as well as the Glasgow Victoria Infirmary hospital. Extensions were added in 1902 and 1912 (the latter intended as the first section to entirely replace the older buildings, but the project went uncompleted due to World War I). In its early decades Queen's Park School also educated young children of primary school age, before later being defined as a Senior Secondary school only, its Junior equivalent being the buildings a few blocks away on Carmichael Placewhich have survived into the 21st century as Battlefield Primary School. In 1967, a new campus was constructed over a mile away to the east in the Toryglen area to serve as the local comprehensive school for the South East of the city. In 1989, Strathclyde Regional Council announced a plan for pupils from Stonelaw High School in the nearby town of Rutherglen ‚Äì which at that time was within the boundaries of Glasgow ‚Äì to leave their existing buildings (split over two separate sites) and move into the Queen's Park Secondary buildings at Toryglen, while the Queen's Park pupils would be relocated to Adelphi Secondary School in the Gorbals district. However, this plan never became reality, and within a few years a replacement for Stonelaw was under construction in Rutherglen, the Adelphi buildings had been converted to other commercial uses and Queen's Park was marked to be closed; it had already suffered from falling enrollment for some years due to its location on the periphery of its catchment area and persistent rumours concerning the likely closure, and eventually this occurred in 1994. Most feeder primary schools were realigned to Shawlands Academy. After several years as a derelict plot, a housing development was built on the site, while its adjacent playing fields still have a recreational function as part of the Toryglen Regional Football Centre. The Grange Road buildings were utilised as a filming location for The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie in 1968, and the premises became a Teachers' Resource Centre before suffering from an arson attack in the 1990s and being demolished in 2006. The site is now occupied by the New Victoria Hospital (or more precisely one of its car parks), the only surviving feature being the exterior fence and its stone gate posts. Sport The school's rugby union team, Queens Park F.P., existed from 1906 to 1974 when they merged with Cartha RFC to form Cartha Queens Park RFC which still plays today. In football, the school still holds the national record for the number of Boys Under 16 Shield victories with six (their closest challengers being local rivals Holyrood Secondary School), although these wins were all achieved prior to World War II.

He lived in Paris (1954‚Äì1970).  Biography  Of a peasant origin, his father worked in blast furnaces and his mother worked in the fields and woods while raising her children, of which Georges was the thirteenth. During the First World War, young George was sent to Algeria for a few months by the Red-Cross which took care of the village children exposed to bombing; he then joined his family in Lyon. In 1918, in the company of his brothers, he attended meetings and meetings organised by avant-garde groups and dreamt of an anarchist communist society.

Part of the post- Revolutionary War settlement of the trans-Appalachian frontier, Gordon was an early settler in the Nashville, Tennessee area. He gained notability and rank in the Tennessee Militia, fighting against the Creeks and Seminoles for Andrew Jackson, during the War of 1812. Jackson referred to him as his \\"Captain of the Spies.\\" Partnering with a Chickasaw chieftain, Gordon helped improve the Natchez Trace, which gave access to the settlers pushing into western Tennessee and south into the Louisiana and Mississippi territories. He was a key figure major battles of the Creek War, including the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, and the capture of Pensacola from the British.  Early life and Tennessee settler  Natchez Trace National Parkway. Gordon was born in Spotsylvania County, Virginia to an aristocratic landholding family. His father had fought in the War of Independence as a lieutenant, and settled the family in Nashville after the war. As a young man, John Gordon made a name for himself as an Indian fighter, riding with the militia to investigate reports of attacks on cabins and farmsteads around Nashville. In 1793 he was commissioned by Territorial Governor William Blount as a captain in the militia. In 1794, he rode in the Nickajack campaign against the Chickamauga Cherokee, who violently defended their Tennessee River Gorge homeland. After Tennessee statehood in 1796, Gordon was appointed its first postmaster, a position also later held by his son-in-law, Confederate States General Felix Kirk Zollicoffer. Gordon had a plantation in Nashville where he made money from horse racing, but was eventually forced to sell the land to pay off debts. During this time, Gordon married Dorothea \\"Dolly\\" Cross, the daughter of another Virginian who had settled in Nashville. Cross and Gordon, coming from the first families of Virginia, were both descended from Pocahontas.  Later career  It was in the militia that Gordon first came in contact with the Chickasaw Indians, with whom he would maintain friendly contact throughout his life. He later acquired some land within the Chickasaw Nation in present day Hickman County on the Duck River. Here he established a plantation of over fifteen-hundred acres. The land was located at a spot where the Natchez Trace, the old Indian trail then used by settlers going into the Mississippi Territory, crossed the Duck River. In a partnership with Chickasaw Chief William \\"Chooshemataha\\" Colbert, Gordon provided ferry service and ran a trading post along the trace. The Chickasaw ceded the land to Tennessee in 1805 and Gordon moved his family to a large house there in 1812. The Gordon House is still there, now maintained by the National Park Service as part of the Natchez Trace National Parkway. = The Creek Wars = Tennessee Militia attack the log ramparts of the Creek fortification called Tohopeka in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend Now referred to as \\"Captain of the Spies\\" in the Tennessee state militia, Gordon led militiamen and friendly Indians against \\"hostiles\\" armed by the British in the War of 1812. It was during this time that the Muscogee Creek Confederacy dissolved into a civil war, with traditionalist Creek \\"Red Sticks\\" calling for the Creek people to stop ceding land to the United States and adopting western styles of society and agriculture. The Creek Nation called on Tennessee to help put down the so- called \\"Red Stick rebellion\\", named for the painted red war clubs brandished by the Creek priests. It was in the militia that Gordon made the acquaintance of Andrew Jackson, who led the campaign. When starving Tennesseans threatened to mutiny against \\"Old Hickory\\", Gordon was the first to answer Jackson's plea \\"If only two men remain with me, I will never abandon this fort,\\" to which Captain Gordon replied, \\"You have one, general; let's look to see if we can't find another.\\" Gordon fought against the Red Sticks in 1813 at the Battle of Talladega; and later at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814 (where Jackson noted him for his courage, saying: \\"... Captain Gordon who was in front at [the head] of the spies rushed to the fight, and entered into the persuit ...\\") Horseshoe Bend was the scene of the defeat of the Red Sticks. Gordon and Cherokee Chief Major Ridge were noted leaders of the conflict. Jackson then forced the Creeks into a crippling land cession of over 23 million acres in present day Alabama and Georgia as part of the Treaty of Fort Jackson. = Pensacola = Gordon provided the reconnaissance for Jackson's controversial capture of Pensacola which led to the Battle of New Orleans. After Horseshoe Bend, Jackson instructed Gordon to secretly go to Pensacola to see if the British were using the Spanish fort as a base to provide Creek and Seminole Indians with arms. Gordon went on the dangerous mission, passing through Creek territory, and barely escaped after having found the British flag flying at Pensacola and British troops arming Creek warriors. Gordon's son-in-law, Felix Zollicoffer, wrote in an article about the affair: > It was Capt. Gordon who performed that memorable and perilous service of > penetrating alone a forest 300 miles from Hickory Grounds to Pensacola, > encountering and evading various Indian parties, and procuring for Gen. > Jackson that valuable knowledge of Spanish fortifications and of the Spanish > complicity with British and Indian enemies which at once determined him upon > and gave him the key to the famous capture of Pensacola. With Gordon's affirmative report, Jackson captured the town with use of the Tennessee Militia, angering many in the Federal Government.  Return home  During their marriage, Gordon's wife, Dolly, raised eleven children and oversaw the planting of cotton and orchards, and the construction of the house that still stands today on the banks of the Duck River. By some accounts, Dolly served as friend and nurse to the many Indians (probably Chickasaw), who remained in the area or who made regular use of Gordon's ferry and trading post. Death In 1818, Jackson asked Gordon to accompany him on a campaign into Florida that became known as the First Seminole War. The harsh climate of Florida proved to be too much for Gordon, however, and he died later in 1819 at his home. Dolly remained in the home until her death in 1859. Gordon and Dolly are buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Columbia, Tennessee.

However, hemp grows in China, and historically has been used for fiber, as well as for some ritual purposes within Taoism. Chinese etymology M√° ( ), a Chinese word for cannabis, is represented by the Han character È∫ª. The term ma, used to describe medical marijuana by 2700 BCE, is the oldest recorded name for the hemp plant. The word ma has been used to describe the cannabis plant since before the invention of writing five- thousand years ago. Ma might share a common root with the Proto-Semitic word mrr, meaning \\"bitter.\\" Evidence of the earliest human cultivation of ma was found on the island nation of Taiwan. Ancient Chinese prose and poems, including poetry in the Shi jing (Book of Odes), mention the word ma many times. An early song refers to young women weaving ma into clothing.Alan Piper, \\"The Mysterious Origins of the Word 'Marijuana'\\", Sino-Platonic Papers, 153 (July 2005) The word ma is often paired with the Chinese word for \\"big\\" or \\"great\\" to form the compound word dama or Â§ßÈ∫ª (d√†m√°). Dama is sometimes used to describe industrial hemp, as there is a negative connotation meaning \\"numbness\\" associated with the word ma by itself. Historical Chinese medical texts (c. 200 CE) through contemporary twentieth century Chinese medical literature discuss individual terms for ma, including mafen (È∫ªËï°), mahua (È∫ªËä±), and mabo (È∫ªÂãÉ), referring to specific parts of the male and female flowers of a cannabis plant with differing cannabinoid ratios. History In the 19th century, the majority-Muslim Xinjiang region was a major producer and exporter of hashish, with Yarkand being a major center. Tens of thousands of kilograms annually were exported to British India, legally and under tariff, until 1934 when Chinese authorities cut off the legal trade, though smuggling continued for some years after. According to the Ministry of Public Security in 2015, cannabis use was on the rise among Chinese youth. Legal status In 1985, the People's Republic of China joined the Convention on Psychotropic Substances and identified marijuana as a dangerous narcotic drug, and illegal to possess or use it. The penalty for marijuana possession in China is disputed from various sources, but according to the Law on Public Security Administration Punishments, marijuana smokers shall be detained for 10 to 15 days and fined a maximum of 2,000 yuan. Cultivation Cannabis plants are widely grown in Yunnan Province, especially around the city of Dali. However, the Yunnan government began an eradication campaign in 1998 to make the province \\"cannabis free\\" by 2000, resulting in less wild and commercially grown cannabis. A similar campaign has also caused a rise in marijuana prices in Xinjiang province. Taoism Beginning around the 4th century, Taoist texts mentioned using cannabis in censers. Needham cited the (ca. 570 AD) Taoist encyclopedia Wushang Biyao ÁÑ°‰∏äÁßòË¶Å (\\"Supreme Secret Essentials\\") that cannabis was added into ritual incense-burners, and suggested the ancient Taoists experimented systematically with \\"hallucinogenic smokes\\".Needham and Lu (1974), p. 150. From ancient Chinese fumigation techniques with \\"toxic smokes\\" for pests and \\"holy smokes\\" for demons, \\"what started as a 'smoking out' of undesirable things, changed now to a 'smoking in' of heavenly things into oneself.\\" The Yuanshi shangzhen zhongxian ji ÂÖÉÂßã‰∏äÁúüÁúæ‰ªôË®ò (\\"Records of the Assemblies of the Perfected Immortals\\"), which is attributed to Ge Hong (283-343), says: :For those who begin practicing the Tao it is not necessary to go into the mountains. ‚Ä¶ Some with purifying incense and sprinkling and sweeping are also able to call down the Perfected Immortals. The followers of the Lady Wei and of Hsu are of this kind.Needham and Lu (1974), p. 152. Lady Wei Huacun È≠èËèØÂ≠ò (252-334) and Xu Mi Ë®±Ë¨ê (303-376) founded the Taoist Shangqing School. The Shangqing scriptures were supposedly dictated to Yang Xi (330-c. 386) in nightly revelations from immortals, and Needham proposed Yang was \\"aided almost certainly by cannabis\\". The Mingyi bielu ÂêçÈÜ´Âà•ÈåÑ (\\"Supplementary Records of Famous Physicians\\"), written by the Taoist pharmacologist Tao Hongjing (456-536), who also wrote the first commentaries to the Shangqing canon, says, \\"Hemp-seeds (È∫ªÂãÉ) are very little used in medicine, but the magician-technicians (shujia Ë°ìÂÆ∂) say that if one consumes them with ginseng it will give one preternatural knowledge of events in the future.\\"Needham and Lu (1974), p. 151. A 6th-century AD Taoist medical work, the Wuzangjing ‰∫îËáüÁ∂ì (\\"Five Viscera Classic\\") says, \\"If you wish to command demonic apparitions to present themselves you should constantly eat the inflorescences of the hemp plant.\\"Joseph Needham, Ho Ping-Yu, and Lu Gwei-djen (1980). Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology; Part 4, Spagyrical Discovery and Invention. Cambridge University Press, p. 213.

In colonial times, the \\"king's building\\" was destroyed for the construction of Belo Horizonte, there was a chapel with adobe walls, which was replaced years later by a larger group. On December 12, 1897, the Good Voyage church was destroyed, and in 1932, the present church was already built. Construction began in 1913, and the style chosen was the neo-Gothic style. On February 11, 1921, before the work was finished, the church was transformed into a cathedral of the Archdiocese of Belo Horizonte. In 1924 it became archbishopric.

Host manipulation is commonly observed in parasites with complex life cycles reliant on multiple hosts for development. While the definitive host for A. brevis is the woodpecker, their intermediate host is the Temnothorax nylanderi, a species of ant located in the oak forests of western Europe. The tapeworm alters the appearance and behavior of the T. nylanderi ant in order to ensure transmission to the woodpecker, where it can complete its life cycle. The tapeworm affects the behavior, life history, and morphology of the T. nylanderi ant, as well as indirectly affects its uninfected nest-mates. The ant larva is infected after feeding on bird faeces contaminated with A. brevis eggs. The tapeworm penetrates the ant's gut wall and develops into a cysticercoid within the haemocoel. As the parasitic tapeworm larvae develops in the ant's body, the ant begins to change. They smell different from and are smaller than their nest-mates, their cuticles turn yellow instead of the usual brown color, and they tend to stay sitting in the nest. They also have a higher survival rate compared to their uninfected nest-mates, which allows the parasite to have a higher chance at reaching the definitive host.

He is best known for his now defunct film review site, Spill.com and its current spiritual successor Double Toasted. Biography Born to Willie and Irma Coleman and the youngest of three, Korey Coleman grew up loving animation and eventually got into University of Texas hoping to major in film making, but eventually dropped out. While there, however, he met fellow artist and future co-host, Martin Thomas who took an interest in his comic strip Eddie the Albino Squirrel. One of his classmates was future Chowder creator C. H. Greenblatt who worked under him as an assistant. Coleman was also an assistant animator during the production and making of Space Jam. Warner Bros. needed help finishing the project so they hired a team of animators which included Korey. \\"When they hired us to do effects animation for the movie I wasn‚Äôt allowed anywhere near the project. One day, though, the team was so behind they pulled me on to do one shadow of Tweety Bird, who in that particular scene is hooked up to an iron lung. I guessed they figured ‚Äòit‚Äôs simple enough that even he can‚Äôt screw that up‚Äô. It probably took ten minutes to do, but I still received a place in the closing credits, right up there with people who had spent weeks working on the film.\\" Coleman's (center) animated alter ego from Spill.com Coleman started a cable access series called The Reel Deal. The show reunited him with Martin and also brought on fellow reviewers Chris Cox, C. Robert Cargill and Tony Guerrero. During this time, Coleman had directed and starred in a movie called 2 A.M. as a way of expanding his film making capabilities. Coleman grew bored of doing an access show and figured the next step would be to expand on a wider level. Taking the preexisting audio from their reviews, Coleman animated over them for comical effect. Cox had posted the videos online where they were seen by Hollywood.com. After meeting the heads of the site, Coleman formed Spill.com. The site ran from 2007 to 2013 with Saving Mr. Banks being their final review. Cox left to start OneofUs.net, Cargill continued his career as a screenwriter and Tony retired from podcasting (although he does return for a few special occasions). The character of Co-Host 3000 is owned by Hollywood.com. Coleman decided to start a Kickstarter in launching a new site. The initial goal was $30,000, but by the end they earned $133,860. From there, DoubleToasted was created. Personal life Coleman considers himself an atheist even though he was raised in a strong Christian household. Coleman was also a member of the National Guard of the United States. His father fought in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. In August 2016, Coleman proposed to his girlfriend, Merve Mia. Their wedding was on July 7, 2017. Coleman is also friends with The Fast and the Furious star Tyrese Gibson of whom he is prone to make fun of on his show. He briefly shared a mailbox with author Anna Todd whose novel After was adapted into a movie of the same name, which he reviewed on his show.

Background  The Veteran appealed his 70 percent evaluation for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), asserting that he was entitled to an extra-schedular evaluation because his PTSD symptoms prevented him from advancing at his job as a senior systems programmer. He stated that his PTSD symptoms strained relationships with his direct managers that prevented his promotion and less-experienced coworkers were promoted before him and received higher salaries. He argued that there was a significant disparity between his current income (including VA benefits) and income he believed he could have received, but for the severity of his service-connected disability, which was sufficient to trigger extra-schedular consideration. The Board, in denying the appeal in June 2005, found that the evidence showed that he veteran did not have marked interference with obtaining or retaining employment and he had maintained steady, full-time, gainful employment since discharge from service and worked at his current job since May 1986.  Analysis  The Court articulated a three-step process for determining entitlement to an extra- schedular rating and rejected the veteran‚Äôs argument that an inadequacy in the rating schedule can be established solely by showing an asserted gap between his income (including VA benefits) and the income of similarly qualified workers in his field. The Court described such argument as flawed because it was based on a faulty proposition that a schedular rating for a service- connected disability is not adequate unless it compensates for the actual individual income that is not realized but for that disability. The three-step process for determining whether an extra-schedular evaluation is required was outlined by the Court as follows: # The evidence must present such an unusual disability picture that the available schedular evaluations for that service- connected disability are inadequate, # The schedular evaluation must not contemplate the claimant's level of disability and symptomatology and is found inadequate. # When an analysis reveals that the rating schedule is inadequate to evaluate a claimant's disability picture and that picture has related factors such as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization, then the claim must be forwarded for an extra-schedular evaluation determination by either the Director of Compensation Service or the Under Secretary for Benefits. The Court also found that the Board erred in its reasoning that the veteran‚Äôs PTSD did not warrant extra-schedular consideration because he did not establish an inability to obtain or retain employment. However, the error was not prejudicial because the decision not to refer for extra-schedular consideration was not based solely on that finding as the Board also made the threshold determination that the disability picture was not so unusual or exceptional as to render the 70 percent schedular rating as inadequate. The Court noted that the very effects of the veteran‚Äôs PTSD symptoms that he asserted as having kept him from receiving a promotion, such as impaired judgment and inability to maintain effective working relationship, are criteria described as occupational impairments that are used for evaluating mental disorders under Diagnostic Code 9411, and not earmarks of an exceptional or unusual disability picture with marked interference with employment.

Despite Connie and Evelyn's protests, they manage to isolate her at the family estate. Meanwhile, the Society is busy trying to save Mallins Wood which is home to the last remaining gorgon. Only a handful of people know of the existence of the gorgon including Col as the gorgon is his mother's companion. Kullervo tries to use Col's mother to get to Connie however his plan fails and he instead kidnaps Col. While rescuing him, Connie becomes linked with Kullervo and even though she has the opportunity, she is unable to kill him. =Mines of Minotaur= Connie is unconsciously raising dangerous storms in her sleep. She initially refuses to tell anyone and swears Col to secrecy when he finds her asleep on the shore after one of the storms. She is then investigated by Mr Coddrington, who has become a new trustee in the Society. He manages to get Connie thrown out of the Society by making her look dangerous. While avoiding everyone in a bid to protect her friends, she stumbles on an abandoned mine where she finds several mythical creatures, including a minotaur, who are crippled and want Connie to heal them. Meanwhile, her friends in the Society have been trying to prove Connie's innocence. She is given an opportunity to prove her innocence at a trial but on the night of her trial, Mr Coddrington helps Kullervo kidnap Connie. Using their companion link, Kullervo starts controlling Connie's actions but her friends rescue her and help her to push Kullervo out of her mind. =The Chimera's Curse= A mysterious creature has been spotted on Dartmoor which Connie and her friends later discover is a chimera. The creature attacks Connie, seriously wounding her, and her friends have to rescue her from hospital as she needs a magical cure. Kullervo uses Connie's injury as a chance to steal her universal power which leads to a final showdown between Connie and Kullervo. Sequel A sequel for the Companion's Quartet called Water Thief was published in 2011. It follows the youngest universal companion, George, and his best friend Malvin, a very rude Goblin. Together, they have to help the Society stop an environmental disaster. His first mission for the Society is on Zanzibar island where he has to investigate disappearing water sprites.

It was released for free via the streaming service Bandcamp on September 1, 2012.  Background and composition  In 2010 Patrick Driscoll and Curtis Ferguson began performing as ‚ÄúBlank Banshees‚Äù (previously Shinjuku MAD) which consisted of ‚Äúpredominantly instrumental‚Äù compositions. This set the precedent for what would become Driscoll's solo project Blank Banshee, with Ferguson appearing as a recurrent guest vocalist. Seeking to escape the ‚Äúbubble of economic and demographic slump‚Äù plaguing the creative industry in his Maritimes hometown, Driscoll made a move for the west coast of Canada in the summer of 2012 - relocating to Vancouver, Canada, releasing Blank Banshee 0 shortly thereafter. Blank Banshee 0 was produced, recorded and mastered primarily in Driscoll‚Äôs hometown Saint John, Canada. It was composed with an Akai MPD26 using Ableton Live. The album consists of largely 1980s and 1990s sourced samples layered over original beats, instrumentation and vocals. Several aspects of the album including song titles allude to computer technology. Many tracks blend trap style beats with elements previously associated with genres like seapunk and vaporwave, such as OS start-up sounds and 1990s era video game music. Commenting on his use of sampling, Driscoll states it ‚Äústemmed from a desire to separate myself from the guitar driven music I was making and listening to at the time.\\" Many songs on the album feature vocal and lyrical contributions by Cormorant - the stage name accredited to Curtis Ferguson. The song \\"Dreamcast\\" is a rework of a Shinjuku MAD song originally released in 2010. Blank Banshee 0 has been released on Cassette Tape, Compact Disc, Vinyl, and USB Flash Drive independently through the online store Hologram Bay.  Reception  Blank Banshee 0's style and influence have been attributed to a shift in the direction of vaporwave. Esquire calls it \\"more approachable\\" than other Vaporwave subgenres while building \\"on the basic premise of the genre.\\" In 2016 The Fader called Blank Banshee 0 a \\"definitive document of the Vaporwave era.\\" Bandcamp Daily called the album \\"a progressive record, abandoning the often dissonant nature of Vaporwave but emphasizing the more accessible elements, and incorporating beats characteristic of trap music.\\"  In popular culture  The song \\"Teen Pregnancy\\" became part of a viral video trend in 2016 called Simpsonwave. Music from the album has appeared on the Netflix series Unplanned America.  Track listing  Adapted from official liner notes.

Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006) is a United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit case that dealt with the credibility of lay evidence as it pertains to Veterans claims.  Background  The veteran rendered honorable service from January 1973 to December 1975. He served again from 1980 to 1982; however, this period of service was characterized as other than honorable. The Board initially denied his claim for a psychiatric disorder in 1987. He attempted to reopen at the regional office in 1992, resulting in several remand actions by the Board, which culminated in a Board denial in September 2002. The evidentiary record revealed initial documented psychiatric treatment in 1978. VA examination reports from 1997, 1999, and 2002 indicate that the examiners‚Äô opinions concerning the origins of the veteran's schizophrenia were influenced by the absence of treatment records from service or within the year after separation. Several lay witnesses‚Äô affidavits, which described their perceptions of the veteran's onset of symptoms in service or soon thereafter, as well as an opinion from a private physician linking the veteran's schizophrenia to service, were submitted in support of the veteran's claim. In discussing the lay evidence, the Board stated that \\"[r]ecollections of medical problems some 20 years after the veteran‚Äôs separation from service have slight probative value and lack credibility absent confirmatory clinical records to substantiate such recollections.\\" In denying the appeal, the Board found the 2002 VA examination, which included an opinion rejecting a nexus to service based upon the absence of medical documentation, to be the most persuasive. The private medical opinion was discounted as it was based upon lay statements and the 1997 and 1999 VA opinions were deemed equivocal. The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court), in affirming the Board of Veterans Appeals denial, indicated that the Board did not err in determining that the lay evidence lacked credibility.  Analysis  The Federal Circuit, in discussing the aforementioned statutes and regulations, noted that they clearly provided that competent lay evidence can be sufficient in and of itself to establish a service-connection award without any contemporaneous medical evidence. The Board erred by improperly determining that the lay statements lacked credibility merely because they were not corroborated by contemporaneous medical records. The Federal Circuit held that the Board's determination was legally untenable because it would render portions of the statutes and regulations meaningless as it would remove the option of establishing service connection based on competent lay evidence. For example, the Federal Circuit pointed to 38 U.S.C. 1154(a), which states: > The Secretary shall include in the regulations pertaining to service- > connection of disabilities (1) additional provisions in effect requiring > that in each case where a veteran is seeking service-connection for any > disability due consideration shall be given to the places, types, and > circumstances of such veteran‚Äôs service as shown by such veteran‚Äôs service > record, the official history of each organization in which such veteran > served, such veteran‚Äôs medical records, and all pertinent medical and lay > evidence, and (2) the provisions required by section 5 of the Veterans‚Äô > Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act (Public Law 98‚Äì542; > 98 Stat. 2727). (emphasis added) Additionally, the Federal Circuit also pointed to the fact that 38 C.F.R. ¬ß3.307(b) states that the factual basis for proving a chronic disease may be established by \\"medical evidence, competent lay evidence or both.\\" The Federal Circuit also stated that, \\"[w]hile the lack of contemporaneous medical records may be a fact that the Board can consider and weigh against a veteran's lay evidence, the lack of such records does not, in and of itself, render lay evidence not credible.\\" The Federal Circuit concluded that the Veterans Court erred by affirming the Board's erroneous statutory and regulatory interpretation that lay evidence cannot be credible absent confirmatory clinical records to substantiate the facts described in that lay evidence.  Decision  The case was vacated and remanded to the Veterans Court.

In November 1997 it amalgamated with the City of Payneham and the Town of St Peters to form the City of Norwood Payneham & St Peters. History It was proclaimed on 7 July 1853 as the Corporate Town of Kensington and Norwood, covering the then villages of Kensington, Norwood and Marryatville. The town extent was defined as sections 260, 261, 276, 277, 289, and 290 of the Hundred of Adelaide, corresponding to land beside First Creek and Second Creek enclosed by the modern suburbs of Norwood, Marryatville, Kensington and Heathpool. It was the first municipal corporation in South Australia after the City of Adelaide. The council was divided into three wards at its inception: West Norwood, East Norwood and Kensington. Charles Bonney was unanimously elected as the first mayor. On 18 September 1856, it gained Kent Town from the District Council of Burnside, which was then incorporated as Kent Ward. This was the only change ever made to the council's boundaries. These boundaries were defined as Dequetteville Terrace, Kensington Road, Portrush Road, the southern and eastern boundaries of section 290, Shipster's Road, East Parade, Kensington Terrace, Magill Road and North Terrace. In 1878, the municipality had a population of 6500, which had doubled by the mid-1880s. The original Kensington and Norwood Town Hall was built in 1859 and demolished in 1897. The present Norwood Town Hall was opened in 1883, and received extensive additions in 1914. The council undertook a significant program of tree planting in its early years, and managed three municipal plantations. In 1905, the council was given Norwood Oval as a gift in trust, and managed it thereafter. It was granted city status on 7 July 1953, the date of its centenary, becoming the City of Kensington and Norwood. The council elected its first woman member, Pamela Meade, in 1975. In 1977, it adopted a general policy \\"to preserve the historic character of the City\\", and undertook a heritage survey in 1980; in the mid-1980s it was reported to have \\"the greatest density of heritage buildings [per hectare] recognised by heritage authorities in the state\\". In 1985, it was responsible for an area of 3.92 square kilometres, with a population of approximately 9,500, having declined from a peak of 17,000 in the mid-1950s. It had a budget of only $3 million in that year. Each of the four wards was represented by two councillors, with four aldermen representing the whole council area and a directly-elected mayor. 23% of the population was over the age of 65 ‚Äì the second-highest in metropolitan Adelaide. The council sponsored the Christmas Pageant and Mardi Gras each November, the second-largest in South Australia. It also operated a swimming pool complex and a caravan park. The council had been deemed to be too small for economic survival as early as the 1970s, and on 1 November 1997 it amalgamated with the City of Payneham and the Town of St Peters to form the City of Norwood Payneham & St Peters.

The coup was launched by Army Chief of Staff Abu Saleh Mohammad Nasim against the President of Bangladesh Abdur Rahman Biswas. The coup failed and the Army chief of Staff was dismissed. Background In February 1996 the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Khaleda Zia held elections which were boycotted by the main opposition, Bangladesh Awami league, led by Sheikh Hasina, who had demanded the elections be held under a neutral Caretaker Government. The constitution was amended and the formation of a neutral caretaker government took place. During the period between February and June, Major General G.H. Murshed Khan and Brigadier General Hameedur Rehman had spoken against the political situation of the country. President Abdur Rahman Biswas asked the Chief of Staff of Bangladesh Army, Lieutenant General Abu Saleh Mohammed Nasim, to take action against the officers. Nasim refused which led the president to dismiss those officers through the defence Ministry. G. H. Morshed Khan was the GOC of Bogra Cantontment and Hameedur Rahman was the deputy chief of Bangladesh Rifles. Coup Lieutenant General Abu Saleh Mohammed Nasim revolted against presidential orders. He organised troops loyal to him. Nasim was placed under house arrest by troops loyal to the government and dismissed from service, after Nasim was fired on Sedition charges. The soldiers loyal to the government also blocked roads leading to the capital Dhaka as they might be used to bring troops loyal to General Nasim. The situation was more tense in northern Bogra Cantontment where the GOC, Major General G.H. Murshed Khan, was sacked by the president. Soldiers protected the Government TV and Radio stations. General Nasim was placed under the custody of Military police and held in the VIP officers' mess. Soldiers from Bogra cantonment and Mymensingh Cantonment supported General Nasim. The soldiers from Mymensingh Cantonment tried to March to Dhaka but returned to their bases when the president ordered them to do so. Troops from Bogra cantonment could not reach Dhaka, as they could not cross the Jamuna River. The other side of Jamuna River was controlled by troops from Savar Cantonment who remained loyal to the president. Aftermath Major General Mahbubur Rahman was appointed the new army chief by the president. Shiekh Hasina won the parliamentary election that was carried out by the Caretaker Government. General Mahbubur Rahman joined Bangladesh Nationalist Party after retirement. The failed coup strengthened the image of Bangladesh army and its willingness to support democracy.

Cumaean Sibyl at Galleria Borghese, also by Domenichino. The theme of the Cumaean Sibyl was used by the Bolognese Domenichino likely four times and was a common trope favored by learned patrons in Rome. Patrons could obtain a topic both derived from classical literature and yet voicing an apparent prophesy of the birth of Christ. She is featured Michelangelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel frescoes and Raphael's frescoes in Santa Maria della Pace. These painters depicted the Sibyl as an older woman; tradition holds that she had a God give her a long life, but was not given extended youth. The writing by the Sibyl in Greek on the scroll reads, \\"There is one God infinite and unborn\\"; the word unborn is spelled incorrectly. The painting is mentioned in the inventory from 1641, and the list of 1697, assigns the work to Domenichino. The work has undergone a number of restorations.Entry at Musei Capitolini .

By tilting or swiping one's smartphone, one can view such \\"Fyuses\\" from various angles ‚Äî as if one was walking around an object or subject. The app blends photography and video to create an interactive medium and was first published for iOS in April 2014. The android version was released at the end of 2014\\\\. The app Fyuse lets users capture panoramas, selfies, and full 360¬∞ views of objects and allows one to view captured moments from different angles. It has its own personal gallery, social network and standalone web integration. With the app Fyusion also created a social networking platform similar to Instagram. Fyuses can be shared, commented on, liked and re-shared to one's followers (called Echoes). One can build a network of followers and with engagement tracking, one can see how many times an image has been interacted with The images can also be saved for private, offline view, or shared to other social networks, like Facebook or Twitter, or embedded on a website where the images can be interacted with by desktop users via dragging the mouse. Furthermore, in the compass tab other fyuses can be discovered using the app's system of tags and categories. One's Fyuse feed is prepopulated with top users, and one can follow people to see when they post a new fyuse. The app will also find one's friends if one signs up with Facebook or connects it with one's Twitter account. To create a fyuse one moves around a person or object with one's phone's camera in one direction or moving/tilting one's phone around while holding one's finger on the screen. By combining photography and video the app allows one to capture moments that one may not have otherwise been able to capture by recording not one moment in time but stitched together little moments. According to Fyusion CEO Radu Rusu, a photo freezes a moment in time, while a video captures moments in a linear timeline ‚Äî both still flat, when viewed. A Fyuse image captures a moment in space, where one can not only see one side of something, but also around it. When it's done rendering, fyuses can also be edited - one can trim the fyuse for length and edit the brightness, contrast, exposure, saturation and sharpness. One can also add a vignette and apply a filters, with options to adjust their intensity. After editing, one can write a description, add hashtags, and tag parts of the fyuse before one can (voluntarily) publish and share it. Version 1.0 has been described as \\"alpha prototype\\" and version 2.0 was released on 17 December 2014. Version 3.0 introduced 3D tagging by which users can layer 3D graphic that animate accordingly with each interaction to add some context to the content. Version 4.0 was released on December 21 for iOS. Since January 2016 (v3.2) the app allows the export of fyuses as Live Photos. The app has also been described as a more sophisticated version of 3D stickers and flip images. Applications The app has many applications for e-commerce such as for fashion designers who want to showcase a garment from every angle, or real estate listings and Airbnb-type sites that want to make their rental properties seem as enticing as possible. The app can also be used for interactive art, 360¬∞ panoramas and selfies. History San Francisco- based Fyusion Inc.'s three founders ‚Äî Radu B. Rusu, CTO Stefan Holzer, and VP of Engineering Stephen Miller ‚Äî worked together at Willow Garage, the robotics research lab started by early Google employee Scott Hassan in the area of \\"personal robotics\\" ‚Äî Hassan decided to turn the lab into more of an incubator, suggesting that the members spin off their technologies into consumer-facing enterprises. Rusu first set out with an open-source 3D perception software startup called Open Perception. Fyusion was officially founded in 2013, and soon after Rusu and his cofounders patented the technology for spatial photography. The company closed a seed funding round at the end of May, raising $3.35 million from investors, including an angel investment from Sun Microsystems cofounder Andreas Bechtolsheim. In 2014 the Fyuse team consisted of 13 employees, mostly engineers and designers, recruited from around the globe. In March 2015 the team displayed their app at Katy Perry's premiere for the movie \\"Prismatic World Tour on Epix\\" where Perry also took Fyuse for a test run. Augmented reality In September 2016 Fyusion unveiled its platform for creating augmented reality content using ones smartphone. It takes the images from ones smartphone and converts them into 3D holographic images, which one can then view on an AR headset. According to Rusu \\"by making it easy for people to capture their surroundings on any mobile device, [Fyusion is] revolutionizing the way that people view the world around them\\" and also states that for \\"AR to be successful, anyone should be able to create content for it\\" opposed to the current \\"small number of content creators and an even smaller number of hardware players\\". According to him \\"the applications of [Fyusion's] technology for consumers and businesses are incredibly limitless\\". The platform uses the company's patented 3D spatio-temporal platform that uses advanced sensor fusion, machine learning and computer vision algorithms and part of the platform is built into the Fyuse app. Before committing to releasing a separate consumer product the company intends to wait until the Hololens device becomes available to the public. Until then any Fyuse representation created using Fyuse is AR ready and will be able to be shown in Hololens in the future. Fyuse - Point of No Return Fyuse - Point of No Return is a science fiction short advert for Fyuse 3.0 in which Fyuse's digital medium is extrapolated into the future. In the film a woman uses a mini scanning-drone to 3D scan a tree with Fyuse and later recreate it as an augmented reality object at another place.

When Champroux went bankrupt in 1863 Th√©venon, who had guaranteed some of his debts, faced bankruptcy himself for 250,000 francs. Faced with being arrested for this debt he and his wife fled France to escape their creditors and arrived in London in October 1863. In 1864 he was sentenced in his absence to ten years' penal servitude; by 1871 he had repaid the debts but the Supreme Court of France did not cancel his sentence until 1890. Nicols arrived in Britain in 1863 with C√©lestine and just five pounds in cash saved by his wife but with a considerable professional knowledge of French culture and cuisine virtually unknown in London and which quickly appealed to British tastes. On arriving in London the couple lodged in Soho where there was a large French population and where Nicols worked as an oddjob man while his wife found work as a seamstress. Caf√© Royal C√©lestine Nicols with her grand-daughter Louisa Lucie Anne Nicols Pigache in 1879 He Anglicised his name to Daniel Nicols and the couple set up their first venture as the 'Caf√© Restaurant Nicols' at 19 Glasshouse Street near Piccadilly Circus in February 1865, but as its fame spread and it became the place to see and be seen he expanded the premises by buying a shop in Regent Street, behind the caf√©, and in 1867 renamed it the Caf√© Royal. He was naturalised as a British subject in April 1865. His future son-in-law Georges Alexandre Pigache (1851-1898) supervised the kitchens and his nephew Eug√®ne Lacoste carefully selected the wines. In fact Lacoste bought so lavishly that Nicols was faced with bankruptcy for a second time but managed to pay off his creditors by selling one eighth of the wine stock. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1 many French political refugees settled in London and would gather at the Caf√© Royal where they found a little piece of Parisian society, causing it to become a popular meeting place. The Caf√© Royal flourished and was considered at one point to have the greatest wine cellar in the world. The 'N' displayed on all the glass, china, napkins and menus throughout the caf√© actually stood for 'Nicols'. Success Empire Theatre in Leicester Square c.1905 With their new-found wealth, in the 1870s the Nicols bought a large estate with a deerpark and farmhouse in Surbiton, demolishing the farmhouse and building Regent House and employing an Italian artist to decorate it with the same rich fittings as the Caf√© Royal. In 1884 they took over the derelict Pandora Theatre in Leicester Square and after decorating it in the same style as the Caf√© Royal launched it as the variety theatre and ballet venue the Empire Theatre. The theatre had three unsuccessful seasons of comic opera which included Chilp√©ric, Edward Solomon and Sydney Grundy's comic opera, Pocahontas or The Great White Pearl, another Solomon opera, Polly or The Pet of the Regiment and his Billee Taylor - all in 1884, while Kate Vaughan starred in Around the World in 80 Days at the theatre in 1886. From 1887 the theatre became the music hall Empire Theatre of Varieties and, like the Caf√© Royal, it too became a great success. At Regent House the Nicols' entertained lavishly in their great ballroom with an orchestra conducted by Leopold Wenzel, or the entire corps de ballet of the Empire Theatre of Varieties, or, from 1887, the numerous music hall performers - all intended to amuse and entertain their weekend guests. As a prominent member of the French community in London Nicols belonged to the Soci√©t√© Nationale, the French gentlemen's club in London, and regularly donated to the French Hospital in Leicester Place. He was also a Freemason. Daniel Nicols is buried in the family vault at Brookwood Cemetery  Illness and Death  Daniel Nicols suffered from diabetes for the last nine years of his life and died from gangrene of the foot and blood poisoning on 28 February 1897 at his home, Regent House, aged 64. He left an estate valued at ¬£191,673, a considerable amount at that time, and his widow immediately disputed the will, claiming that as they had married in France the will was subject to French law and she was therefore entitled to half the income and capital. The Court found in her favour but her daughter Emma and son-in-law Georges Pigache applied to the Court of Appeal, which reversed the previous judgement. Madame Nicols then in turn appealed to the House of Lords which in December 1899 reversed the appeal and upheld the original verdict in her favour. C√©lestine Nicols took over the management of the Caf√© Royal and ran it until her own death in 1916. Daniel Nicols is buried with his wife Celestine and daughter Emma JosephineClarke, John M. London's Necropolis: A Guide to Brookwood Cemetery, Sutton Publishing (2004), p. 209 in the family vault at Brookwood Cemetery. Their son-in-law Georges Pigache is buried with several of his children in an adjacent grave. Reputed to be 35 stone at his death and Britain's largest man, he was buried separately as his specially built casket was too large to fit in the vault.  Recent Relatives  One of George Pigache and Josephine‚Äôs children was Camille Adolphine Isabella Emma born in 1880. She married Arthur William Baker on 19 July 1904. Their son Arthur Daniel Baker had a daughter, named Camille Gemma in August 1940 with Maureen Ellen Byrne of Dublin, Ireland. Camille Gemma Baker is the Great Great Grand daughter of Daniel Nicholas Thevenon (Daniel Nicols). Camille Gemma Baker had three children in the 1970s in Dublin with James Declan Williams. These children are: James Howard, Aoife Camille and Desmond Senan and they are the Great Great Great Grand children of Daniel Nicols.

The masses are presented as the ideal form of resistance to the social.  Publication history  The first edition of the book was published in the final issue of the magazine Les Cahiers d'Utopie in 1978. It was translated to English by Paul Foss, John Johnston and Paul Patton, and published by the Foreign Agents imprint of Semiotext(e) in 1983. A second edition was published in 2007.  Main ideas  In the 1970s, magazines such as Utopie, Noir et rouge, ICO, Socialisme ou Barbarie, Pouvoir ouvrier, and the Situationists were unconditionally opposed to the official culture. They saw the masses as hypnotized into submission by a \\"society of the spectacle.\\" However, Baudrillard interpreted the passivity of the masses in a different way. The work starts with the idea that meaning has been devalued. \\"For a long time, capital had only to produce goods; consumption ran by itself... Today it is necessary to produce consumers, to produce demand, and this production is infinitely more costly than that of goods.\\" The same applies to meaning. \\"Today, everything has changed; no longer is meaning in short supply, it is produced everywhere, in ever increasing quantities ‚Äì it is demand which is weakening... Everywhere the masses are encouraged to speak... They are urged to live socially, electorally, organizationally, sexually, in participation, in festival, in free speech, etc.\\" The central point of the book is that the masses actively refuse meaning. It is an explicit break with sociology. While modernity laments the ignorance of the docile masses, Baudrillard argues that the indifference of the masses to political events, history, art, and culture, is actually \\"a collective retaliation\\" and \\"a refusal to participate in the recommended ideals, however enlightened.\\" All the masses can do - and all they will do - is enjoy the spectacle. Since \\"their representation is no longer possible,\\" the masses are probed by means of surveys, polls, and tests. Politics is forced to rely on simulations of the people as a substitute. Masses are \\"far too conforming to every solicitation and with a hyperreal conformity which is the extreme form of non- participation.\\" As Baudrillard stated in a later interview: \\"People do in fact defend themselves, they have their defensive and even offensive strategies; but this time, through indifference.\\"  References  1978 non- fiction books Books about hyperreality Books by Jean Baudrillard French non-fiction books Metaphysics books Works about postmodernism ","title":"In the Shadow of the Silent Majorities"},{"id":"52569424","text":"Harden Moor is an expanse of moorland that lies north of the village of Harden in West Yorkshire, England. The moor encompasses stretches of heather, woodland and former quarry workings and is bordered by Airedale to the east, the Worth Valley to the north and Catstones Moor and the village of Cullingworth to the west. Historically, Harden Moor occupied the high ground between Bingley, Keighley, Cullingworth and Harden. Altar Lane, an unmade road which runs from the Brown Cow Inn in Bingley to Keighley Road on Harden Moor is an unofficial border between the estate of St Ives and Harden Moor, but when the St Ives Estate was created, a large swathe of Harden Moor was taken over. The moorland has a varied history, with a Roman Road, industrial workings and modern day leisure activities. History Before the St Ives estate was formed, Harden Moor stretched from Bingley in the east to Cullingworth in the west. In 13th century deeds, Ellar Carr Beck (which drains down from Lees Moor and skirts the northern edge of Cullingworth) was defined as the western edge of Harden. This area included Catstones Moor and north up to Hainworth Shaw. Opinions vary as to what the boundaries of Harden Moor are; 18th and 19th century texts describe Harden Moor as including Altar Rock (Druid's Altar) and the land surrounding. In modern archaeological data, Adrian Chadwick describes Catstones Ring on Catstones Moor as being on the southwestern edge of Harden Moor. The history of Harden Moor goes back to the Bronze Age and this is evidenced by the cairns on the moor that have been listed with Historic England. The cairns, which can date from anywhere between 2000-700BC, are examples of Bronze Age burial mounds. These cairns and the ring on Catstones Moor were listed by English Heritage in 2010 as being at risk of falling into decay. The Brigantes, who occupied the territory before the Roman invasion, used a gritstone outcrop that overlooks Bingley as an altar in what is believed to be a form of Druidism. Cup and ringlet marks have been found carved in Altar Rock (also popularly known as Druid's Altar). There is a Roman Road which crosses Harden Moor on a south west/north east axis. This road originated in Manchester (Mancunium) and continued north to Ilkley going through Riddlesden, Morton Banks and Rombalds Moor to what was the Roman encampment known as Olicana. A second Roman road passed through Harden village and crossed Harden Beck by the Malt Shovel inn. It then went in a north westerly direction passing near to the hamlet of Ryecroft and crossing the moor near to Ryecroft Road. Remains of this road can still be seen on the stretch of moorland that is near to the Guide Inn public house. The Malt Shovel Inn in Harden village was also the place where travelling judges would pass sentences on criminals. Those who received the death penalty were hung on Harden Moor. Fairfax Entrenchment, a curved trench believed to have been the site of a skirmish between the two warring sides in the English Civil War, was on Harden Moor. Although there is no known documentary evidence of a fight, it is known that Thomas Fairfax stayed at Harden Grange and most likely he ordered a trench to be dug as a defensive measure. The site is now part of the St Ives estate which has also been converted partly into a golf course. At the time of the supposed skirmish, the site was part of Harden Moor and the area was left undeveloped by the Ferrand family (the local landowners) in deference to the rumour that bodies of fallen civil war soldiers were buried there. Large scale mapping indicates the shape and curve of the trench with the soldiers graves being behind the northern curve of the trench and just south of Altar Lane. Due to finds of coins and other artifacts, it is believed that the Jacobite army of 1745 passed over Harden Moor in November of that year en route to Preston. The moorland was enclosed in stages from 1816 with full enclosure being completed in 1855. In the maps of the Enclosure Act in Airedale, Harden Moor is listed as the section between Bingley and Hainworth Shaw (a hamlet just to the north of present-day Harden Moor). As with other neighbouring moorlands, Harden Moor was used for military training during the Second World War. Empty shell casings and tail fins from mortar rounds have been found scattered across these moors. On the St Ives Estate is an old hut where the Home Guard used to meet up and were called out to search for enemy parachutists dropping down onto Harden Moor (though there is no documentary evidence that anyone did actually parachute onto Harden Moor). In 1945, four Keighley teenagers were walking across the moor when one of them found a mortar and without realising it was live, threw the mortar against a wall. An explosion followed and all suffered injuries (three of them seriously) and they were taken to Bradford Royal Infirmary for treatment. A further three explosions of unattended ordnance followed during the summer of 1945, and one of which resulted in the death of 13 year old Frank Charles Smith (of Keighley). This prompted Bingley Urban District Council, who owned the moor at the time, to initiate a burn policy across parts of the moor to allow mine detectors to be used in the search for unexploded ordnance. Quarrying has been prominent on the western edge of what is now Harden Moor adjacent to Ryecroft Road for over 300 years, with many of the quarrymen residing in the nearby hamlet of Ryecroft. The sandstone from these quarries (Yeadonian, which is rough rock and rough rock flags) was used to construct the iconic buildings in Saltaire and other local towns and villages. The last operational quarry was Midgeham Cliff End Quarry which was satisfying a demand for a type of sandstone (known as blockstone) that is used in locally constructed housing. The quarry had ceased activity by 2012, but was granted a licence to recycle construction and demolition waste. However, the site must be safe and fully restored by 2022. =Altar Rock= Altar Rock (also known as Druid's Altar) is a sandstone outcrop that juts out above the western edge of Airedale and overlooks Morton, Crossflatts, Bingley and Keighley with wide panoramic views up and down the Aire Valley. The rock has been the worshipping place of druids down the centuries with supposed human sacrifices taking place there (although there is no firm evidence of this) and is mentioned in Disraeli's novel Sybil. Disraeli had visited the rock in 1844 when he was staying with his friend William Ferrand, who was the then owner of the St Ives Estate which borders Altar Lane to the south. Disraeli had been greatly influenced by Altar Rock and in Sybil, he had a meeting of Chartists at a rocky outcrop in his fictional setting. This may have had some basis in fact as Chartist rallies were being held around this time in the Aire Valley, with one meeting being reported on Harden Moor. A body of men was organised to go onto the moor and disperse the meeting only to find that it was a meeting of Methodists. Traditionally, the site of Altar Rock has been on Harden Moor, although it is now part of the St Ives Estate despite Altar Lane, which stretches between Ireland Bridge in Bingley and Aire View Farm on the Harden to Keighley Road, being a natural boundary to the northern edge of the St Ives Estate. Older sources describe Altar Rock as being part of Harden Moor, and even as recently as 1995, when a murdered 15-year-old girl was found at Altar Rock, it was described as being on Harden Moor. The 15-year-old girl in question was Nobantu Zani (also known as Mandy) who had emigrated to Bradford from South Africa with her mother and two brothers after her father was killed. Zani's mother believed her to be staying with friends and she may have been missing for up to three weeks before her body was found strangled with her own chiffon scarf. It was later revealed that she had been living a double life and had not attended school for some time, and when she had attended, the time spent there was sporadic. A school truancy councillor was due to call at her mothers house but on the day of the appointment had called in sick. Zani's mother was unaware of this meeting as due to the nature of truancy, it was intended as a surprise. A December 2015 Freedom of Information request showed that Zani's death was classified as undetected by West Yorkshire Police. An inquest into her death in 1999 returned an Open Verdict as decomposition prevented an established cause of death. Ecology The site is typical of a South Pennine Moorland with gritstone and sandstone (Millstone Grit Yeadonian sandstone outcrops) underlying the soil. The moor has several springs and marshes and in its central section is drained by two streams (Deep Cliff Hole and Midgram Beck) which both flow through Harden (meeting up under the houses built on the former mill site in the village) and flowing through Harden park to meet up with Harden Beck in the Woodbanks area at the eastern end of the village. Deepcliffe Wood is a small valley that is bordered on its northern, western and eastern edges by heather moorland. The wood, through which Deep Cliff Hole drains, is a remnant of an ancient woodland which sits on a fault extending southwards towards Wilsden and is noted for its oak trees, badgers, woodpeckers, bats and cuckoos. The heather on Harden Moor is noted to be free of disease and parasites and so has been used to re-seed other moorland habitats in Yorkshire when they have been at risk. Ilkley Moor was re-seeded by cuttings and seedlings from Harden Moor in 2006 after a significant moorland fire. The heather ling and brambles on Harden Moor are also a haven for the tormentil mining bee. The bee's population has decreased rapidly and the Yorkshire and Humber area is noted as having an 'important population' of the bees that excavate burrows to live in. Leisure activities The whole of Harden Moor is designated as common land and besides being used for walking and horse riding, the moorland is also used by motorbikers and push-bikers for trials and competitions. The former quarry workings provide a good backdrop for testing courses for the riders. The moor is also a popular location to go orienteering, with events held regularly by local orienteering clubs. When the Ferrand family still owned the St Ives Estate, they used Harden Moor for hunting with dogs and invited along friends and aristocracy. Motorised model aircraft flying is also permitted on the northern edge of the moor, where a strip of grassed land is provided to enable modellers to safely take off and land their aircraft. Flying of model aircraft on the moor has been in existence since at least 1935. There are panoramic views from Harden Moor northwards and eastwards over Airedale, westwards towards the moors above Cullingworth and Denholme and southwards towards the hills above Wilsden. A Trig Point was located at the highest point on the moor just west of the moor across Ryecroft Road on Catstones Moor. This stands at high. Access Being an open country parkland, Harden Moor is accessible all year round. It has a bridleway that runs along the northern edge of the moor, which also crosses Keighley Road at the eastern end of the moor and runs into Altar Lane. This then goes past Druid's Altar and takes the walker or mountain biker down to Bingley along the northern edge of St Ives Estate. Part of the bridleway crosses into St Ives further south as part of the Keighley leg of the Calder/Aire footpath. Harden Moor is bounded on the west and east by local unclassified roads which have car parks or parking available. The moor is accessible on foot via Hainworth Shaw from the north, St Ives Estate in the east and on pathways from the south through Ryecroft and Harden.

The campus was originally located near the historic Louisville and Nashville Railroad midway between Glendale and the Nolin Station. It is one of the oldest women's colleges in Kentucky. The Lynnland Female Institute was founded by local Baptist leaders, who helped assure its continuation throughout its history. It was officially chartered by the Kentucky General Assembly in 1867 and closed its doors as a college in 1915. Beginnings Lynnland Female Institute was chartered on February 11, 1867, and opened soon aftward under the leadership of the local Baptist minister, Rev. G. A. Colson. In 1869, William F. Perry of Alabama (once the president of the East Alabama Female College in Tuskegee) came to serve as president of the Lynnland Female Institute. He recruited a teacher from Washington College in Virginia: the 20 year old John Peyton Hobson came to teach upon recommendation from his college president, Robert E. Lee. On June 29, 1871, Perry and Peter Eppes Harris purchased the school for $17,000 and eventually turned it co-educational as the Lynnland Military Institution (girls attended a separate department). But it closed in 1879 and Perry left for Bowling Green, Kentucky where he taught at Ogden College (a precursor to Western Kentucky University) until his death. Reopening as a college for women In 1888 Professors Ed White and J. C. Elwood purchased the college and returned it to its former status as a college for women. Lynnland Female College is listed in federal reports for 1891-92 \\\\- with 2 female and 2 male professors teaching a total of 60 students (with a library of 3,000 volumes) -- and again in 1895 with E.W.

Since the 1950s, the crusades have become an ideological staple in Islamism and Jihadism. Islamic views on Europe and Christianity before the First Crusade Western Europe held little interest for Islamic writers, who regarded their own culture as much more sophisticated and advanced; the medieval Muslim felt both superiority and condescension towards Christianity, as for them it was clear that Christianity was an incomplete and imperfect revelation, surpassed by the superior faith of Islam and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. As a result, Muslims tended to have little interest in other faiths as they were viewed as incorrect by default. Muslims referred to Europeans as \\"Franks\\" and their perception of Europe and its inhabitants was formed from a mixture of travel accounts, oral accounts from prisoners of war, pilgrims, merchants, diplomats, geographical works and popular stories. Their understanding of Europe tended to be influenced by ethnocentrism.Hillenbrand, Carole. The crusades: Islamic perspectives. Routledge, 2018, pp.267-268 Muslim geographers divided the world into seven latitudinal zones and the position of given peoples in a particular zone predisposed them towards certain attributes or dispositions. The greatest harmony and balance was found in the third and fourth zones, which encompassed the central lands of the Arab World, North Africa and eastern China. The Franks (along with the Slavs and Turks) lived in the sixth zone and like these two other groups, the Franks were regarded as pursuing the arts of warfare and hunting, were possessed by a melancholic temperament and a general proneness to savagery. They were also seen as filthy, unhygienic and treacherous.Hillenbrand, Carole. The crusades: Islamic perspectives. Routledge, 2018, p.270 The Abbasid writer al-Mas'udi, writing in the 10th century, described the Franks as a \\"numerous, courageous, well- organised and well-disciplined people, with a vast and unified realm.\\" al- Mas'udi goes on to describe Western Europe: > As regards the people of the northern quadrant, they are the ones for whom > the sun is distant from the Zenith, those who penetrate to the North, such > as the Slavs, the Franks, and those nations that are their neighbours The > power of the sun is weak among them because of their distance from it; cold > and damp prevail in their regions, and snow and ice follow one another in > endless succession. The warm humour is lacking among them; their bodies are > large, their natures gross, their manners harsh, their understanding dull, > and their tongues heavy. Their color is so excessively white that it passes > from white to blue; their skin is thin and their flesh thick. Their eyes are > also blue, matching the character of their coloring; their hair is lank and > reddish because of the prevalence of damp mists. Their religious beliefs > lack solidity, and this is because of the nature of cold and the lack of > warmth.Hillenbrand, Carole. The crusades: Islamic perspectives. Routledge, > 2018, p.270 This view was common of Muslim writers, who regarded Western Europe as a harsh, frozen land and its inhabitants as large and strong but violent and unintelligent - one Persian writer even believed that Franks lacked individuality and shed their hair annually like animals.Hillenbrand, Carole. The crusades: Islamic perspectives. Routledge, 2018, p.270 The Franks were also seen as sexually loose and having an improper pride towards their womenfolk - while Muslims regarded it important to keep the sexes as somewhat apart and women were to only unveil in the place of certain male relatives, Franks were seen as having the two consort freely and women as undressing before complete strangers, which Islamic writers saw as immoral and regarded Frankish men as lacking \\"proper\\" marital jealousy by allowing their wives to be seen undressed before other men.Hillenbrand, Carole. The crusades: Islamic perspectives. Routledge, 2018, pp.279-280 Due to the Islamic belief that climate would influence the character of a given peoples, there was also a view that Franks who settled in the Arab world for extended periods would make them more civilised. However, these were seen as exceptions and furthermore, Franks were seen as incapable of truly imitating Muslim behaviour.Hillenbrand, Carole. The crusades: Islamic perspectives. Routledge, 2018, p.280 In general the Muslim view of the Franks was one of a people who did not follow civilised pursuits, were unhygienic and filthy, deficient in sexual morality but possessing martial prowess and were courageous and redoubtable in war.Hillenbrand, Carole. The crusades: Islamic perspectives. Routledge, 2018, p.274 Arab historiography The crusaders of the 12th century mostly fought the Turkish Seljuks, and later the Ayyubid dynasty, and were thus indirectly (and intermittently directly) allied with the Arab Abbasid Caliphate. For this reason, according to Hillenbrand (2000), Arab historians tended to align with a western viewpoint, discussing the \\"Frankish wars\\" in the context of their own fight against the Turkic expansion. Phillips (2005) summarizes the general indifference by stating that \\"most Muslims\\" see the Crusades as \\"just another invasion among many in their history\\".Jonathan Phillips, The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople (2005). Contemporary Islamic accounts did not recognise any religious or military motive for the Crusaders, who instead were simply viewed as arriving from nowhere before wreaking havoc upon Muslims.Hillenbrand, Carole. The crusades: Islamic perspectives. Routledge, 2018. The veneration of Saladin as chivalrous opponent of the Crusaders likewise finds no reflection in Islamic tradition before the visit of German Emperor Wilhelm II to Saladin's tomb in 1898.The Kaiser laid a wreath on the tomb baring the inscription, \\"A Knight without fear or blame who often had to teach his opponents the right way to practice chivalry.\\" Grousset (1970). The visit, coupled with anti-imperialist sentiments, led nationalist Arabs to reinvent the image of Saladin and portray him as a hero of the struggle against the West. The image of Saladin they used was the romantic one created by Walter Scott and other Europeans in the West at the time. It replaced Saladin's reputation as a figure who had been largely forgotten in the Muslim world, eclipsed by more successful figures such as Baybars of Egypt.Riley Smith, Jonathan, \\"The Crusades, Christianity and Islam\\", (Columbia 2008), p. 63-66 Modern Arab states have sought to commemorate Saladin through various measures, often based on the image created of him in the 19th-century west.Madden, Thomas F.: The Concise History of the Crusades; 1999, 3rd edition, Rowman & Littlefield, 2013. pp. 201-204. Modern Jihadism Renewed interest in the period is comparatively recent, arising in the context of modern Jihadist propaganda calling for war on the Western \\"crusaders\\".\\"There is a straight line for propagandists to draw,\\" Highly charged, BBC News, May 4, 2005 The term ·π£alƒ´biyy≈´n \\"crusader\\", a 19th-century loan translation from Western historiography, is now in common use as a pejorative; Salafi preacher Wagdy Ghoneim has used it interchangeably with na·π£ƒÅrƒÅ and masƒ´·∏•iyyƒ´n as a term for Christians in general.\\"Wa«ßdƒ´ Ghunaym uses the term '·π£alƒ´biyyƒ´n' not so much in the meaning of foreign 'crusaders' but interchangeably with na·π£ƒÅrƒÅ and masƒ´·∏•iyyƒ´n to designate all Christians, including the Copts in Egypt.\\" A. Hofheinz, \\"#WhyIHateIkhwan Islamist-secular polarisation in Egyptian social media\\", University of Oslo (2013). The Partition of the Ottoman Empire was, at the time, popularly depicted as a final triumph in the long history of the crusades against Islam: The London Punch magazine published a drawing of King Richard the Lionheart watching the post-WWI British army entering Jerusalem with the caption, ‚ÄúAt last, my dream come true.‚Äù Madden p. 198. In a similar fashion, when the French General Henri Gouraud took command of Syria, he remarked, ‚ÄúBehold Saladin, we have returned.Madden, p. 199. Madden (1999) argued that this European romanticising connection of the crusades with contemporary colonialism was what has \\"reshaped the Muslim memory\\" of the medieval crusades.Madden, p. 201. Beginning in the 1950s, following the influential History of the Crusades by Steven Runciman, western intellectual mainstream tended to depict the crusades as a shameful episode of colonialism. This, once again, tended to influence Muslim perception of the period, fuelling Arab nationalism and Islamist propagandistic depictions of westerners as hostile invaders: :\\"Arab nationalists and Islamists agreed fully with this [Runcimann's] interpretation of the crusades. Poverty, corruption, and violence in the Middle East were said to be the lingering effects of the crusades and subsequent European colonialism.\\" (Madden, p. 203). Khashan (1997) has argued that the revival of \\"crusading\\" narrative in the west is connected with the end of the Cold War and the search for a new \\"good vs. evil\\" dichotomy in which to cast world politics.\\"In this atmosphere [post-Cold War] in which the conflict between ‚Äògood‚Äô and ‚Äòevil‚Äô has ceased to inspire American policy makers, playing up the militant Islamic threat seemed a useful way to revive the East-West confrontation.Hilal Khashan, ‚ÄúThe New World Order and the Tempo of Militant Islam,\\" British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies, Vol. 24, No. 1 (May 1997): 10 Khan (2003) argues that the contemporary jihadist propaganda is substantially derived from the writings of early Islamist like Sayyid Qutb and Maududi who were educated in Western institutions in the 1950s and thus submerged in the \\"politically correct\\" narrative following Runcimann which was current in western academia at the time.Muqtedar Khan, ‚ÄúRadical Islam, Liberal Islam,‚Äù Current History (December 2003): 419 The \\"crusader\\" rhetoric was fully developed in Islamist extremism and Jihadism by the end of the 1990s. Notably, a fatwa signed by Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri in 1998 called for jihad against \\"the crusader- Zionist alliance\\" (referring to the United States and Israel). By 2008, The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World claimed that \\"many Muslims consider the Crusades to be a symbol of Western hostility toward Islam\\".John Trumpbour, \\"Crusades\\" in The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World, ed.

Air Commerce was the first private airline founded on the territory of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, and began direct flights from Sarajevo to a dozen destinations in Europe. In 1991 and 1992, the airline was responsible for a record boost in the number of passengers passing through Sarajevo Airport. Despite this, the airline's most profitable route was between Zurich and Skopje, where the majority of passengers were Albanians. This boost in air traffic from Bosnia and other regions of Yugoslavia made it possible for Air Commerce to pay more than in leasing payments to JAT in its first year of operation. However, with the start of the Bosnian War and Bosnia and Herzegovina's declaration of independence, the planes were delivered back to Belgrade to JAT, and the company underwent a major decrease in activity.Za ≈°aku dolara at bhdani.ba, January 1998, retrieved 12-12-2016 When the war started in 1992, the airline offered its planes to UNHCR for humanitarian purposes,The siege of Sarajevo: 1992-1996 by Suad Kapiƒá, page 273 but this offer was rejected, so Air Commerce found itself in a total halt.

Ranke obtained his science doctorate in 1931 from the University of Heidelberg with a thesis entitled \\"The Rectifier Resonance Theory: An extension of the Helmholtz resonance theory of hearing by physical examination of cochlear fluid oscillations.\\" Political and military activities Ranke was a member of Der Stahlhelm, which was dissolved and integrated into the Sturmabteilung (SA) from 1934 to 1935, and was a member of the National Socialist Teachers League. In 1935, Ranke joined the Aviation Medical Research Institute of the Military Medical Academy in Berlin, where Hubertus Strughold worked. Ranke was appointed in 1936 to au√üerplanm√§√üiger (extraordinary) professor at the University of Berlin. From 1937 to 1945 Ranke headed the Military Medical Academy and the Institute of General and Military Physiology. Ranke joined the Wehrmacht in 1939 and conducted research at the Military Medical Academy for Aviation Medicine on thermoregulation and nutritional physiology. Ranke also served as an advisory officer to the military. As a medical staff officer Ranke took part in the conference, \\"Medical Problems Arising from Sea and Winter,\\" (Tagung √ºber √Ñrztliche Fragen bei Seenot und Wintertod) August 26 and 27 1942 in Nuremberg, where the hypothermia experiments in the Dachau concentration camp were presented. Along with Karl Brandt, Ranke was, from 1944, a member of multiple scientific advisory boards. Introduces military methamphetamine In an effort to make its front-line soldiers and fighter pilots fight longer, harder, and with less concern for individual safety, the German army ordered them to take military-issue pills made from methamphetamine and a primarily cocaine-based stimulant. Pervitin, a methamphetamine drug newly developed by the Berlin-based Temmler pharmaceutical company, first entered the civilian market in 1938; it quickly became a top seller among the German population. The drug was brought to the attention of Ranke, at the time a military doctor and director of the Institute for General and Defense Physiology at Berlin's Academy of Military Medicine. The effects of amphetamines are similar to those of the adrenaline produced by the body, triggering a heightened state of alert. In most people, the substance increases self-confidence, concentration, and willingness to take risks while at the same time reducing sensitivity to pain, hunger, thirst, and the need for sleep. In September 1939, Ranke tested the drug on 90 university students and concluded that Pervitin could help the Wehrmacht win the war. Cocaine, whose effects substantially overlap with those of amphetamine but feature greater euphoria, was later added to the formulation to increase potency through the multiplicative effects of drug interaction and to reinforce use by individuals. Some medical authorities criticized this drug regimen, with distributed pills numbered in the millions, as having the negative consequence that many soldiers became addicted to drugs and useless in any military capacity, whether combat or supporting. Later years and death After the war, Ranke became head of the University of Erlangen Physiological Institute. In 1946, after three months, the American military government cashiered him. From mid-September 1947 until his death, Ranke was professor of physiology at the University of Erlangen and at the same time director of the Physiological Institute.Karl-Heinz Plattig (Zusammenstellung): Zur Geschichte des Institutes., Website des Instituts f√ºr Physiologie und Pathophysiologie der FAU.

Before the end of slavery, he was a journalist, teacher, and conductor on the Underground Railroad in Ohio and Kentucky. After the American Civil War, he moved to Arkansas. From 1873 to 1874 he was superintendent of public schools in Arkansas. He founded the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff and was its first principal from 1875 until 1902. He ended his career in education spending a decade as principal of Merrill High School in Pine Bluff. He also taught in Missouri. Early life Joseph Carter Corbin was born in Chillicothe, Ohio, on March 26, 1833, to William and Susan Corbin. William and Susan were from Richmond, Virginia, where they were slaves before they moved to Chillicothe. Joseph was their eldest son, and he attended schools in Chillicothe where John Mercer Langston was a classmate. At the age of 15, he moved to Louisville, Kentucky, and taught in schools there as an assistant to Henry Adams, who would become his brother-in-law. After a few years he moved back to Ohio and attended Ohio University, where he graduated in 1853. He returned to Louisville where his father's family lived and took work as a clerk, first in a mercantile agency and then in a bank. He was also active in the Underground Railroad as a part of a circle involving John Patterson Sampson, S. W. C. Liverpool, John McLeod, and Louis D. Eastin.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising.

University of Arkansas, 1910. p356-357 Career In 1872, Corbin was hired as a reporter for the Arkansas Daily Republican and moved to Arkansas. There he was appointed chief clerk of the Little Rock Post Office and in 1873 the state superintendent of public schools which he served for two years, defeating Thomas Smith for the position. By virtue of his position, he also served as the second president of the University of Arkansas Board of Trustees. While president, he signed the contract for the construction of the first permanent building at the University of Arkansas, Old Main, initially called University Hall. In 1873, with Corbin's urging, the legislature approved the creation of Branch Normal College at Pine Bluff, to be the black arm of the state university and later known as the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff.Gordon 2007, p84 Corbin was dismissed after Democratic takeover of government in the Brooks‚ÄìBaxter War of 1874. He then taught at the Lincoln Institute in Jefferson City, Missouri, for two years. Branch Normal College He returned to Little Rock in 1875 at the request of Governor Augustus H. Garland and sent to Pine Bluff where he was to establish the Branch Normal College, as nothing had been done since the passing of the law authorizing its creation in 1873. Normal schools were designed to train teachers, and Corbin was very successful in his work. When the school opened that year, there were seven students, but enrollment grew to about 250 by 1887. From 1875 until 1883 he was the only teacher at the school.Rummel, Jack. African-American Social Leaders and Activists. Infobase Publishing, 2014. p41 Corbin was principal of the school until 1902 and valued the schools commitment to the land-grant mission, although in the 1890s, against the wishes of Corbin, the school moved toward the Tuskegee model of industrial education advocated by Booker T. Washington.Roger L. Geiger. History of Higher Education Annual: 1998: The Land-Grant ACT and American Higher Education: Contexts and Consequences. Transaction Publishers, Jan 1, 1998 p84-86 =Disputes= In 1891 after the Arkansas Legislature adopted provisions of the second Morrill Act, Corbin sought to have its measures implemented, in particular that if a state maintained separate white and black universities, funds should be \\"equitably divided\\", although equity was left for states to define. Corbin's efforts were partially successful. The legislature allocated $5,000 to open new programs in agriculture and mechanical arts and hired William S. Harris, a white employee of the Fayetteville University of Arkansas campus, to run the new programs. Corbin was not happy with the effort, because agriculture did not offer his students many opportunities for upward mobility. A year later, in 1893, Corbin was investigated due to rumors of poor performance and was recommended to be fired by the Democratic state legislature. This investigation was in contrast to another investigation in 1891 which found Corbin to be very successful and respected. It has been suggested that the negative report was related to Corbin's support of John M. Clayton in the hard fought 1888 election campaigns. Clayton and Corbin were close friends, and Clayton was a brother to Powell Clayton, a politically powerful Republican who was opposed by the state Democratic politicians. The legislature was not authorized to remove Corbin, and the university's board of trustees decided to retain Corbin, but promoted Harris to Superintendent and Treasurer, putting Corbin in a subservient role. In 1895, Corbin accused Harris of seducing female students and the accusations were widely supported, but Corbin was unable to fire Harris who was supported by the board. Corbin's relationship with the board continued to decline and in June 1902, the board voted to replace him, appointing Tuskegee graduate and Booker T. Washington prot√©g√©, Isaac Fisher. Fisher was not supported by the community, who advocated for Corbin's return.Gordon 2007, p101-102 Later career Corbin in 1910. After leaving the university, he became principal of Merrill High School in Pine Bluff, serving from 1901-1911. During this tenure, he worked with R. C.

Ready4 helped more than 2 million students in over 150 countries improve their standardized college admissions test scores. Ready4 has also partnered with over 60 leading colleges and universities such as Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of North Carolina to reach qualified candidates via its platform. Ready4 won many industry awards. It was chosen among EdTech 20, the twenty most innovative educational technology companies, in 2016. It was a finalist in MassChallenge's 2013 accelerator, as well as a semi-finalist in 2013 MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition. History The company was founded by Israeli tech entrepreneur and former Israeli professional basketball player, Elad Shoushan. A graduate of MIT's Sloan School of Management, Shoushan led the company from inception to exit. He started the company after failing the GMAT a few times and became motivated to create a mobile platform that would turn test prep into a more personalized experience. Shoushan discovered that all the material needed could be authored by test prep experts, but did not currently exist in a mobile format. He set about making it accessible, personalized and affordable. When he got accepted to the MIT Sloan School of Management for September 2012, he quit his job and spent the next six months coding the Prep4GMAT app by himself in his mother-in-law's garage near Caesarea. He launched the app in August and incorporated LTG Exam Prep Platform in October 2013. LTG stood for \\"Label the GMAT\\", since Shoushan's algorithms highlighted keywords in test questions. The Prep4GMAT app was originally coded for iOS. Shoushan launched the Android version in August 2014 and raised $3 million from TAL Education Group, Atlas Venture, Jamie McCourt, Yongjin Group and Zhen Fund. He used the investment to develop more test prep apps. In 2015, with 160,000 downloads, the Prep4GMAT app became number one in Apple Store search results for GMAT and MBA in the United States, India, and China. LTG released Mandarin Chinese and English editions of the app. The company rebranded to Ready4 in 2016. The Princeton Review, one of the main college admission services companies in the United States, endorsed LTG and granted the company access to its prep content for the MCAT. The company raised $5.33 million in Series A funding in March 2016. The round was led by Square Peg Capital and included Accomplice, as well as various angel investors. At the time, the apps were being used by half a million students worldwide. As of September 2016, the company employed 40 people worldwide, where the majority of the team is located in the United States. Ready4 apps were used by students from over 9,000 cities in 190 countries. On 22 September 2016, the company announced that it surpassed a million downloads of its apps. In 2018, Ready4 helped more than 2 million students in over 150 countries improve their standardized college admissions test scores. Ready4 has also partnered with over 60 leading colleges and universities such as Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of North Carolina to reach qualified candidates via its platform. In 2019, Ready4 was acquired by TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL) to provide Ready4's offering at a larger scale.

The Vlachs (or Wallachians) were a pastoralist community in Moravian Wallachia of eastern Moravia in what is today the Czech Republic. History The Moravian Vlachs are mentioned during the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì48). The Vlach law were at this time in danger of being abolished. Jan Amos Comenius wrote in 1620: \\"Moravians of the mountains around Vset√≠n, called Wallachians, are a warlike people‚Ä¶ they refused to accept the Habsburg yoke and for three whole years defended their freedom with the sword\\". Later, in 1624, he wrote: \\"the inhabitants of the lordship of Vset√≠n and the mountains thereabout continued to resist with arms and could not be brought to deny their faith or offer submission\\". Some continued to practice Orthodox Christianity, most converted to Protestantism, while on the whole, resisting any attempts of the Jesuit missionaries to convert them to Catholicism. Due to this situation, in 1632 the Catholic Church and the Habsburg Empire took coercive measures: \\"the inhabitants of Vala≈°sko were Vlachs and hence utterly infractory\\". Zl√≠n town records from 1621 refer to \\"the Wallachians, who are the local rabble\\". Albrecht von Wallenstein, Habsburg military lord of Vset√≠n, wrote in 1621 about the expected uprising and referred to them as Wallachians against whom he did not have sufficient support to mount a campaign. A Habsburg commissioner in 1622, writing about the local Moravians, stated that: \\"the people are inclined more to the enemy and the Wallachians\\". Vlachs raided the Habsburg holdings of Malenovice, Zl√≠n, and Vala≈°sk√© Mezi≈ô√≠ƒç√≠. Wallenstein stated that the Vlachs fought as a ‚Äúhorde‚Äù and Vlach forces were victorious against the Habsburgs during the initial years of the war. During portions of these initial years Protestant Hungarians made common cause with the Vlachs, and by 1621 Vlachs controlled all of Moravia east of the Morava River. Hungarian forces, however, were defeated by the Habsburgs at Olomouc in late 1621 and withdrew from Moravia in 1622. Vlach forces were subsequently subdued in 1623, accompanied by a series of public executions. Renewed Vlach attacks on Vset√≠n occurred in late 1623. The Hungarians, now aided by the Ottomans, reentered the war, and fighting occurred as far west as Brno. However, the Vlachs did not join their former allies. A second peace between Hungary and the Habsburgs was signed in 1624. The Habsburgs seized this opportunity to attack the Vlachs in March 1624 in the mountains west of Vset√≠n, but the Vlachs prevailed in what was described as a \\"slaughter\\" of Habsburg forces. Vlachs captured Lukov in 1626, and joined by Danes, who had entered the war against the Habsburgs, also captured Hranice in 1626. In 1627, Wallenstein‚Äôs counter-attack forced the withdrawal of the Danish army from Moravia and sent the Vlachs into retreat. By 1630, Vlachs controlled only their Carpathian strongholds. The final Vlach uprising occurred in 1640, when the Swedes invaded Moravia to do battle with the Habsburgs. Combined Vlach-Swede forces won back portions of Moravia, but then the Swedes withdrew in 1643 to concentrate on a war with Denmark. In January 1644, a massive Habsburg raid was conducted against the Vlachs in the mountains east of Vset√≠n, The Habsburg victory was completed by this time with a battle that culminated in the burning of Vlach villages (e.g. Hovƒõz√≠, Huslenky, Halenkov, and Zdƒõchov), disarming of the Vlachs, destruction of the fields and livestock, and an estimated 20 percent of the males of Vset√≠n were killed or later executed. Vlachs who fled the area were pursued by the Habsburgs as far as into Hungary. Ultimately, about one third of the total Vlach population was killed. With the Conscription of Vala≈°sko on February 16, 1644, a complete registration of the remaining Vlachs occurred. Execution or oath of allegiance to Habsburg and conversion to Catholicism were the choices. Many Vlachs were executed during the infamous executions of 1644 in Vset√≠n.

It stands at the junction of Grosvenor Gardens and Hobart Place near Victoria Station in the City of Westminster, on land donated by the 2nd Duke of Westminster. The design of the memorial was inspired by Colonel Willoughby Verner. Construction was funded by the Rifleman's Aid Society. The memorial has a curved screen and central pylon of Portland stone, with three bronze statues by the Scottish artist John Tweed: on the pylon, a helmeted rifleman in First World War uniform marching with slung rifle (modelled on Rifleman Ephraim Alfred Dudley); and at ground level, in front of the screen to the left, a rifleman in 1806 pattern uniform with a Baker rifle, and, to the right, an officer with sword from 1800, when the Experimental Corps of Riflemen was formed. An inscription on the memorial commemorates the 11,575 men from the Rifle Brigade who fell in the First World War; a later inscription mentions the 1,329 men who fell in the Second World War. All are listed on a Roll of Honour held at Winchester Cathedral. The memorial was unveiled on 25 July 1925 by the Colonel-in-Chief of The Rifle Brigade, Field Marshal Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, and dedicated by the Chaplain- General to the Forces, Reverend Alfred Jarvis. The unveiling ceremony was accompanied by an honour guard from the 2nd Battalion, and another of veteran riflemen. In 1970 the memorial was listed at Grade II; it was upgraded to Grade II* in 2016.

The memorial is a tapering tower high, completed in 1927. It was restored in 2011, and designated as a Grade II* listed building in January 2013. At the same time, the park was itself listed at Grade II, and the gates and gate posts at the park's main entrance were separately Grade II listed. Background Coventry City Council formed a war memorial committee in 1919 to develop proposals to commemorate the 2,587 Coventrians who died in the First World War. The committee determined that the creation of a public park would be a suitable memorial, and raised ¬£31,000 to acquire a site at Stivichall on the south side of the city from Hon Alexander Frederick Gregory, son of Samuel Hood-Tibbits, 3rd Viscount Hood, on the high ground between the River Sherbourne and the River Sowe. The park opened in 1921, with a formal area to the northeast and a separate informal area to the southwest with playing fields. The park was designed with avenues leading away from a monument on the high ground at the centre of the park, along which copper beech trees were planted as memorials in 1925. Over 200 trees were planted, many with an individual bronze plaque on a stone plinth. The trees in the park included at least one Verdun oak. Further avenues of memorial trees were planted after the Second World War. Due to inadequate budgets, and attention devoted to other issues such as housing, Coventry was one of the last major British cities to complete its First World War memorial (the Liverpool Cenotaph and the Bristol Cenotaph came later, in 1930 and 1932 respectively). The Coventry war memorial committee sought designs from architects in 1923, and selected a tower designed by local architect Thomas Francis Tickner. Tickner died in 1924, soon after his design was selected, but another local architect Thomas Reginald John Meakin oversaw the construction. The necessary funds of ¬£5,000 were raised from a public appeal that commenced in 1924. The tower was built by a local builder, John Gray of Coombe Abbey, and who also built the Courtauldsworks at Foleshill. Description Construction of the memorial tower began in 1925 and it was competed in 1927. It was built using reinforced concrete and clad with Portland stone, in Art Deco style with Classical details. It has a square section, and originally stood on an stepped octagonal stone platform, replaced in 2011 with a circular platform of granite with eight steps, handrails and a ramp. The corners are heavily buttressed and step back in ten tiers with blunt pinnacles, reaching a summit which has an eternal light. Stone pedestals near the corners of the memorial, constructed in 1928, conceal floodlights. The north elevation has a tall stone cross sculpted in relief, above a sculpted wreath and the dates of the two World Wars, \\"1914-1918\\" and \\"1939-1945\\", a relief sculpture depicting the arms of the city of Coventry, and a shelf for floral tributes. The south elevation also has a tall cross sculpted in relief and a shelf for tributes. The platform bears bronze discs commemorating men of Coventry awarded the Victoria Cross, including Charles Edward Haydon Parker (Boer War), and Arthur Hutt, Henry Tandy, William Beesley, and Alfred Edward Sephton (all First World War). A separate bronze plaque bears a quotation from Laurence Binyon's poem \\"For the Fallen\\". Openings on the east and west elevations provide access to a chamber within, with large bronze doors added in 1928 which bear relief sculptures of a cross and the dates \\"1914-1918\\" and \\"1939-1945\\". The Chamber of Silence inside the tower contains a roll of honour listing the fallen, and other memorials, including memorials the Old Contemptibles and to the workers of Renold Chains. The roll was later extended to include the fallen from the Second World (817 in the armed forces, 115 in civilian defence organisations, and 1085 civilians) and in subsequent conflicts, such as the Gulf War. The Chamber is opened to the public on Remembrance Sunday each year. The memorial was dedicated by Field Marshal Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig, at a ceremony held on 8 October 1927. The party accompanying Earl Haig included the Mayor of Coventry, as well as Mrs E Bench whose four sons were killed in the war, and Corporal Hutt VC. The memorial as rededicated after the Second World War by Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein. The park and the tower were restored in 2011 with funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Big Lottery Fund, and the tower was rededicated again in October 2011 by the Bishop of Coventry, Christopher Cocksworth. On 17 July 2014, in a ceremony performed by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, the Memorial Park was the first of 500 parks to be dedicated as a Centenary Field.

Larissa FastHorse is a Native American playwright who has written and produced numerous contributions to Native American drama, plays involving issues with indigenous people in American society and issues in theater. This play is developed in a linear way with interspersed informative moments in the performance to give the audience background knowledge on important events concerning Native Americans. The play is currently still in development; however, there have already been readings of the play to assess its widespread appeal and gain feedback on how it can further be refined. In 2017, The Thanksgiving Play was selected by the Kilroys, an annual list of underproduced plays by women. In 2018, it was slated for presentation off Broadway, opening in October, 2018.  Production History  Although The Thanksgiving Play is about Native American Month and Thanksgiving, it was originally written in an estate in the countryside of Ireland. Larissa FastHorse was awarded the Joe Dowling Annaghmakerrig Fellowship in 2015 from Joseph Haj at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. Within this fellowship she could go to Tyrone Guthrie‚Äôs estate in Ireland, which is where she began writing the play. Having conceived and researched the idea in the USA, she then wrote the first draft in a mere ten days while in the Irish countryside. After its Irish beginnings, The Thanksgiving Play then moved to U.C. Berkeley in 2015 for its first reading and a workshop. At Berkeley, it was directed by Paige Johnson and cast with students of the New Play Practicum. The Thanksgiving Play then moved to Portland, Oregon at the Artists Repertory Theatre where a reading of it was done for the staff of the theatre. After Portland, The Thanksgiving Play was a part of the fall Play Lab during the 2016/2017 season at Center Stage in Baltimore, Maryland. It was directed by Gavin Witt, who is also the Associate Director and Director of Dramaturgy at Center Stage. After its brief stay in Baltimore, The Thanksgiving Play went back to Portland for a table/room/stage finishing Commission at the Artists Rep. After Portland, there is another workshop planned for early 2017 at The Playwrights' Center in Minneapolis and a production scheduled for the 2017/2018 season. Artists Repertory Theatre will stage The Thanksgiving Play from April 1 to April 29, 2018.\\"2017/18 Season\\" artistsrep.org Its Off-Broadway debut was scheduled for October, 2018.  Characters  Casting Note: All ages are open and actors that ‚Äúlook white‚Äù may be played by POC passing as white. Logan Female, Caucasian looking, the director as well as an actor. Earnest about theater and doing the right thing, but wants everyone to feel part of the collaboration so much that it derails the actual play. Caden Male, Caucasian looking, the academic. Teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School System with dramatic aspirations but no clue how things work on stage. Jaxton Male, Caucasian looking, the LA surfer actor. Politically correct to a fault, a big one. He‚Äôs that guy everyone loves, but his logical PC thinking takes weird turns. Alicia Female, brunette Caucasian but has looks that would have been cast as ethnic in 1950‚Äôs movies. Hot, but not bright. That actress whose every script note ends with her being allocated more lines.  Plot  A one-act satirical comedy about four white people trying to devise a politically correct First Thanksgiving play for Native American Heritage Month to be done in the schools. The director, Logan, hires a Native American actor to be their cultural compass. As Logan, Jaxton, and Caden defer to her for guidance, it is revealed that she is white and only plays Native American when she isn‚Äôt playing other ethnicities. Without the Native voice, these four white people now have to find their way through a crazy thicket of privilege, historical accuracy, and school district rules.  Main ideas  The Thanksgiving Play aims to provoke thought through the idea of a completely Caucasian cast attempting to create a Thanksgiving play that is respectful and politically correct towards Native Americans. The contradictory nature of this idea is very unusual when considering the fact that this play is written by a Native American playwright. The Thanksgiving Play was Fasthorse‚Äôs response to constantly being told her plays couldn‚Äôt be produced because they included at least one Indigenous character and theaters thought that they couldn‚Äôt find Native American actors for the roles. In response, FastHorse challenged herself to write a play about Native American issues that excluded that casting difficulty; enter The Thanksgiving Play. Here, Fasthorse's characters are white people trying to write and produce a play about Native Americans with no input from them. The hyper-political correctness of the protagonists in this play is meant to touch on how complex and ultimately impossible it is to accomplish that task. It highlights issues such as the lack of casting of indigenous actors, erroneous attempts to represent indigenous people in American society, assumptions about Native American identity rather than tribal (national) identity, and various other problems indigenous people face in America. Portraying the conflict of trying to form a politically correct Thanksgiving play without Native Americans allows the play to take on an amusing satirical tone as it discusses important issues concerning Native Americans in American society. Underneath the humor and satire in the play, the protagonists subtly bring ways that Americans in the past and even today have inaccurately portrayed Native Americans. In particular, the protagonists continually reference the ways they could portray Native Americans through an all-white cast wearing redface.  Playwright  Originally from South Dakota and an enrolled member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, Lakota Nation, Larissa FastHorse is an acclaimed playwright, director, and choreographer. She began as a ballet dancer, but after an injury, always loving to write, she started working in TV and film as a TV executive and writer. While she achieved some success in the TV world, FastHorse craved what the theater had to offer. Her play Average Family was commissioned and produced at Children‚Äôs Theatre Company of Minneapolis and she has been writing for the theatre ever since. FastHorse is currently a member of the Playwright‚Äôs Union and on Theatre Communications Group board of directors. She and Ty Defoe also have a consulting company, Indigenous Direction and she is a part of Native Voices at the Autry Museum. FastHorse is currently working on a one-act commission with The Eagle Project in New York City. She is also workshopping What Would CrazyHorse Do? with Kansas City Rep with a production is in May 2017.

The Oregon Trail series by Pressman Toy Corporation *Card games :*The Oregon Trail Card Game :*The Oregon Trail: Hunt For Food Card Game *Board games *The Oregon Trail Game: Journey to Willamette Valley The Oregon Trail Card Game The first card game was released on 1 August 2016. The game is exclusively distributed through Target, although copies are also available via Amazon.com. The game components are in the style of 8-bit video games to emulate the look and feel of the original releases. =Gameplay= The object of The Oregon Trail card game is to follow the Oregon Trail from Independence, Missouri, to the Willamette Valley, Oregon, with a party of two to six players. Players write their names, or \\"frontier name\\" aliases, on a roster. On the back of the roster are tombstones, which can be customized when players die, as in the original video game. Players play trail cards to progress, with the players needing to play 50 cards to win. Each trail card ends on the left, right, or middle of the card, and a subsequent trail card must be placed to smoothly connect to the previous one. Of the 56 trail cards, 46 have consequences associated with them, such as rolling a die to cross a river, which can result in the player losing a supply card or dying. Other trail cards require the player to draw a calamity card, which represent accidents such as snakebites, dead oxen, typhoid, or dysentery. There are sixteen unique calamity cards, with one in eight resulting in instant death. Calamity cards that do not result in instant death can be remedied by supply cards, of which there are seven different types, including clean water, ammunition, and medicine. Other trail cards represent forts or towns, allowing the player to resupply. All players win if one or more players are still alive after the 50th card is played. A successful game should take around 30 minutes to play. =Reception= On the tabletop-gaming forum BoardGameGeek, The Oregon Trail card game has a rating of 5.0 out of 10, with 286 ratings, as of 13 December 2016. According to BoardGameGeek's Rating wiki page, a game with a score of 5 is described as being \\"Average. No significant appeal, take it or leave it.\\". Writing for Ars Technica, Megan Geuss stated that some cards have ambiguous instructions or are hard to understand, but that the cooperative aspect is \\"refreshing\\" and that players in her group \\"weren't bored by the end\\". She concluded that winning the game is \\"really hard\\" and that her group never did. On HobbyLark.com, Travis Wood also stated that the game is \\"very, very difficult\\" but that it is \\"pretty clear what you have to do.\\" He wrote that five or six players are required to successfully complete the game. Admitting that he had never played the original video games, he concluded that the game is enjoyable, worth the low price, and that its specific advantages are being quick and \\"more or less satisfactory.\\" The Oregon Trail: Hunt For Food Card Game This card game is based on the hunting trip portion of the video game, except player's goal is to collect 600 pounds of meat. The Oregon Trail: Journey to Willamette Valley It is a board game for 2-4 players, where player's starts the trip from Independence, Missouri in 1844 to Willamette Valley. Each player has 4 family members as in the first The Oregon Trail video game, but has the ability to upgrade wagon.

The unusual squat columnar memorial was designed by Sir Mark Sykes, 6th Baronet and built in 1919‚Äì20. It became a Grade II listed building in 1966, upgraded to Grade I in February 2016. The memorial stands near the Eleanor Cross, Sledmere, a copy of the Eleanor Cross from Hardingstone, which was built as a village cross in the 1890s and converted by Sykes into a war memorial for the men from his estate. Background Sykes was the son of Sir Tatton Sykes, 5th Baronet. He served in the Princess of Wales' Own Yorkshire Regiment in the Boer War and later as lieutenant colonel of the 5th Battalion, Yorkshire Regiment. He was MP for the local constituency of Kingston upon Hull Central from 1911 to his death in 1919. He inherited the baronetcy on his father's death in 1913. The 1916 Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement is named after him. Sykes received permission to raise the Wagoners Special Reserve as a Territorial Army unit in 1912, signing up farm labourers and tenant farmers from across the Yorkshire Wolds for war service as drivers of horse-drawn wagons. Sykes held wagon-driving competitions for his wagoners. During the First World War, 1,127 men from the corps were called up to serve in the Army Service Corps and the Royal Engineers. Most were sent to serve on the Western Front in France, with little or no military training, and given the important logistical task of moving essential materiel: food, ammunition and equipment. Wagoners also served in Italy, Salonika and the Middle East. Sykes attended the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, but contracted Spanish flu and died in February 1919, before the memorial was completed. The memorial The memorial is to the west side of Sledmere, north of St Mary's Church, and near the Sykes residence at Sledmere House. It was designed by Sykes, and is said to be based on a Saxon memorial in the crypt at York Minster. It stands high, with an octagonal plinth of five steps leading up to squat stone column of Portland stone, with stone carvings, with conical canopy and pinnacle, once topped by a cross (now lost). The central column is surrounded by four narrower columns, supporting a carved entablature, and inscription on the frieze. The masonry was built by Alfred Barr and the naive art sculptures made by Carlo Domenico Magnoni, curving around a central column in three sections, similar to Trajan's Column, showing scenes from the history of the Wagoners, from Sykes enlisting them, through them being called up, travelling to France, and graphic scenes of conflict. It was described by Pevsner as \\"curiously homely\\". The memorial is also inscribed with a five-verse poem in the local dialect. The memorial was unveiled on 5 September 1920 by Sir Ivor Maxse, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Northern Command. The ceremony was attended by 2,000 spectators, with a guard of honour from the 5th Battalion, Yorkshire Regiment. The last wagoner veteran died in 1993.

Born in Helsingborg in 1936, he was a member of the Social Democratic Party and served as chairman of the Swedish Association of the Visually Impaired (Synskadades riksf√∂rbund) from 1975 to 1985, the rehabilitation committee of the World Council for the Welfare of the Blind from 1974 to 1985, and the Swedish Disability Association (Handikappf√∂rbundens centralkomit√©, HCK) from 1977 to 1985. First elected as a Member of the Riksdag (MP) for Stockholm County in 1982, he stepped down in 1995. Lindqvist also served as a deputy minister for social security (responsible for family affairs, elderly care and disability) in the Palme II and Carlsson I Cabinet and was later named minister without portfolio with the same responsibilities in the Carlsson II Cabinet. From 1994 to 2002, Bengt Lindqvist served as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Disability of the Commission for Social Development. He died at the age of 80 in 2016.  Biography  = Family = Born in Helsingborg, Lindqvist was the third child of Wiking Lindqvist, a pipe installer, and his wife Westa J√∂nsson, a shop assistant for a chemical business. He grew up with two older sisters. He married Gun Bengtsson in 1960 and moved with her to Solna in Stockholm County. The couple had two daughters. In 1966, the family moved into a larger apartment in Tyres√∂ and in 1970 into a house in Trollb√§cken. Lindqvist died in Nyn√§shamn on 3 December 2016, leaving behind his wife, his two daughters, and four grandchildren. = Education = While attending Husensj√∂ primary school in Helsingborg, Lindqvist was diagnosed with poor eyesight during a routine check at the age of eight, which was later specified by the university hospital in Lund as a degeneration of the retinal pigment, eventually causing blindness. Though Lindqvist continued to attend public school, his visual impairment affected his education and after several years rendered it impossible to read standard printed text. As aiding technology was not widely spread in Sweden at that time, he had to fall back on individual solutions. With the use of magnifying glasses, a typewriter and the help of family members and friends who recorded or read texts to him, Lindqvist finished primary school in 1951 at the age of 15. After a discontinued internship at a local greenery, Lindqvist's aunt contacted the Institute for the Blind in Solna by Stockholm to arrange for him to attend Tomteboda School for the Blind, then the leading school for blind education in Sweden. He stayed there from October 1951 to June 1952. Even if the main motivation was for him to learn reading and writing in braille, Lindqvist also received training in basket weaving, Swedish language and literature, music ‚Äì he started to play the drums in a jazz band ‚Äì and sports. Through a gymnastics teacher he was introduced to the ideas of the still young disability movement that advocated for a better inclusion of disabled people into Swedish society. Lindqvist later described this acquaintance as an important founding stone for his later engagement in disability rights advocacy, an experience that was enhanced by the secluded environment of the school: > \\"It was really a completely new and very different environment that met me > at Tomteboda. There were about 150 pupils in all school ages from all over > the country. The vast majority had been there since the age of six or seven. > It was a closed world.\\" After his return to Helsingborg in 1952, Lindqvist continued at the local secondary school with a focus on language, using braille books and voice recordings by his sister as aids. He then studied English at Lund University from 1957 to 1960 with the help of book loans from the National Library for the Blind in London. During this time, he also began to work part-time as a travelling teacher for Tomteboda School for the Blind, a job that consisted of visiting and assisting former Tomteboda students who were to be integrated into regular schools in their home towns. After moving to Solna with his wife in 1960, who had been offered the position as typist for braille at Tomteboda, Lindqvist took up studies in German, Nordic languages and literature history at Stockholm University, from which he graduated with a magister degree in 1965. After the birth of the twins in the same year, his wife began to work from home as a copyist for the study department of the Swedish Association of the Visually Impaired. Due to the strict regulations of the Swedish school department concerning physical impairments among teaching staff at public schools, and practical difficulties during a brief employment as teacher at a secondary school in Stockholm, Lindqvist decided to leave the educational sector. In an interview with Livsbild, an initiative of the Nordic Museum (Nordiska museet) and the Swedish Disability History Association (HandikappHistoriska F√∂reningen), he states: > ‚ÄúAfter pressure from several quarters and with the threat of public debate, > the School Board finally gave up and allowed me to do the teacher training > as an exception. I was extremely offended by this experience, and together > with the experiences from my studies, this came to have great significance > for my continued development. A strong sense of justice arose in me and I > started thinking in disability political terms.‚Äù In 1967, he accepted an invitation of the Swedish Association of the Visually Impaired to become involved in a research project on visual impairment and public education.  Political career  = Political positions = His own struggles as a person with a visual impairment in acquiring the study material necessary for a continued education in public school and university, as well as the months spent at Tomteboda School for the Blind and his continued work with visually impaired pupils have contributed to Lindqvist's rising interest in contemporary socio-political debates that started to critically examine the realities of the Swedish welfare state. In his memoirs Blindstyre (Blind Governance, published 2012), Lindqvist attributed his political orientation towards the Swedish Social Democratic Party, of which he became a member in the early 1970s, to the political views and actions of the then Prime Minister Olof Palme as well as the social democratic politician and former Minister for Finance, Ernst Wigforss. An incident that influenced his political views in particular was the public debate of the Low Income Committee's final report (l√•ginkomstutredningen) of 1970 that gave detailed testimony of the living situations of Swedish citizens, highlighting existing inequalities within society that marked a sharp contrast to official political statements. The reactions of Palme and the Social Democratic Party to expand the Swedish welfare state by introducing far-reaching labor reforms as well as a comprehensive redistributive reform to benefit disadvantaged groups coincided with the emergence of a more and more politicized and vocalized disability movement. Through his work for the Swedish Association of the Visually Impaired, Lindqvist became increasingly exposed to the movement's arguments and demands. These debates contributed to Lindqvist's realization that the analytical category of disability could be used as an indicator for the degree of welfare and social equality within state administration and societal discourses, a position he refined and continued to defend throughout his later career as a politician as well as an advocate for disability rights: > ‚ÄúWhen I linked my experiences of the shortcomings within the area of > disability to the welfare system that had been build up, I came to the > conclusion that what had been done so far was important and reasonable, but > still insufficient. I could also see how necessary it was to incorporate the > factor of disability as a highly relevant part into the analysis of people‚Äôs > living conditions. The [low income] committee had not done that, and thus an > important dimension in the analysis of welfare was lacking.‚Äù This debate on the structures, practices and ideals of the Swedish welfare state in the late 1960s and early 1970s also wielded influence among disabled citizens and their organizations, notably the disability activist Vilhelm Ekensteen with his publication P√• folkhemmets bakg√•rd (In the Backyard of the People's Home, 1968) and the associated, radical leftist disability movement Antihandikapp. Although Lindqvist acknowledged the movement's critical stance towards the prevailing living conditions of persons with disabilities in general, he remained skeptical of their confrontational argumentation and verbal assaults against the more established disability organizations. He instead advocated for a shift of perspectives within these organizations towards a more rights-based approach to disability. The aim was to establish persons with disabilities and their representatives as important members of and contributors to Swedish society and the political process. To this end, Lindqvist advocated a deepening of cooperation between disability organizations, state authorities and the broader public. = Member of Parliament, 1983-1995 and Deputy Minister for Social Security, 1985-1991 = In 1981, the Stockholm municipal unit (arbetarekommun) of the Social Democratic Party suggested to Lindqvist that he stand as Member of Parliament for the upcoming Swedish elections. He was elected as MP to the Riksdag in October 1982. After leaving parliament in 1985, he was re-elected from 1988 to 1991, 1992, and 1993 to 1995. Following his first term in the Riksdag, in 1985 Lindqvist was appointed deputy minister for social security by Prime Minister Olof Palme. After Palme's assassination in 1986, he continued in this position under Minister for Social Affairs Gertrud Sigurdsen in the Carlsson I Cabinet. His main responsibilities included elderly care, family and disability policies. With the convention of the Carlsson II cabinet in 1990 his position was transformed into minister without portfolio, though with similar jurisdiction. Additionally, matters concerning the state alcohol policy fell within his area of responsibility. Even after leaving his ministerial positions in 1991, Lindqvist continued to work as a special advisor to the Ministry for Social Affairs in the domain of international disability matters. Upon his appointment as deputy minister in 1985, Lindqvist was the first Swedish politician occupying a higher position with a visual disability. This caused a considerable public echo, not least among the national press. The majority of newspaper and other media contributions were positive, though some of them voiced possible challenges his disability could pose in the day-to-day business of politics. Only a few, however, highlighted his engagement within the Swedish disability community or focused on his political positions and goals. As he later expressed himself on the matter: > ‚ÄúAll major media had the news. No one was particularly interested in my > potential qualifications for the appointment. Everyone only saw the > blindness. The most common question was: ‚ÄòAre you the world‚Äôs first blind > minister?‚Äô‚Äù His six years as deputy minister were marked by attempts to make the Swedish welfare state more open to disadvantaged social groups. Persons with disabilities received particular attention, as his political activities testify. One of his main tasks in this area was the implementation of the National Program of Action on Disability that Sweden had adopted in 1982 as an outcome of the United Nations‚Äô International Year of Disabled Persons of 1981, which Lindqvist, as chairman of the Swedish Disability Association and a member of the national planning committee for the Year, had been instrumental in drafting.Swedish National Archives: SE/RA/323494/Beredningsgruppen f√∂r internationella handikapp√•ret 1981/Volym 7-9/Utkast och manuskript till rapporter och handlingsprogram 1981-82. During his parliamentary terms, Lindqvist initiated or supported 52 motions to the Swedish Riksdag, many of which concerned the rights and social position of persons with disabilities. Lindqvist was also involved in political debates concerning prenatal testing and ensuing ethical questions. Together with Margaretha Persson, also she a member of parliament and involved in the Swedish disability movement, he handed in the motion Political Responsibility for Ethical Questions in Adherence to the Beginning of Life (Politiskt ansvar f√∂r etiska fr√•gor i anslutning till livets b√∂rjan, Motion 1983/84:1626). In the mid-1980s, Lindqvist was elected chairman of the Social Democratic Party's disability council with the aim to revise the party's official disability policy. The resulting program, called P√• alla villkor (On Equal Terms), was, however, not adopted by the party congress. From 1988 to 1991, Lindqvist also participated in the second national disability inquiry (handikapputredningen), which mapped and analyzed the living situation of persons with disabilities in the Swedish society. The results of the inquiry eventually paved the way for a more comprehensive disability rights legislation, including the disability reform package LSS in 1994 (Lag om St√∂d och Service till vissa funktionshindrade, 1993:387), which legally enshrined the right to personal assistance. Lindqvist left the Riksdag at his own request in 1995. = Continued political activities = Lindqvist returned to Swedish politics in 1997 as chairman of the Swedish Handicap Institute (hj√§lpmedelsinstitutet), a position he occupied until 2007. In the same year he was also appointed chairman for the newly established Handicap- and Rehabilitation Research Centre, HAREC (Centrum f√∂r rehabiliterings- och handikappvetenskap) at Lund University. Also in 1997, he was appointed by the then Minister for Social Affairs, Margot Wallstr√∂m, as responsible collaborator in a governmental project to review and critically assess the implementation of the second disability inquiry (handikapputredningen). Between 1997 and 1999, the project resulted in five publications with a focus on the life situations of persons with disabilities and their contacts with public institutions as well as a final report, Lindqvists nia: nio v√§gar att utveckla bem√∂tandet av personer med funktionshinder (SOU 1999:21; Lindqvist's Nine: nine ways to develop the attitude towards persons with disabilities). As the project's main result, Lindqvist drew the conclusion that considerable deficits continued to exist regarding the attitudes of society, public officials and health professionals towards persons with disabilities. Some of the key ideas and recommendations that Lindqvist proposed in the final report were later incorporated into a proposition for a national action program for the development of healthcare by Minister for Social Affairs Lars Engqvist (Regeringens proposition 1999/2000:149, Nationell handlingsplan f√∂r utveckling av h√§lso- och sjukv√•rden).  Disability activism  = In Sweden = Lindqvist's engagement in disability rights activism resulted partly from his own experiences with segregated education, the lack of accessible study material for persons who, like him, had a visual impairment, and problems in finding regular employment as a language teacher. Finding solutions to these barriers and thinking critically about integrative aspects of education also became starting points for his professional career at the Swedish Association of the Visually Impaired. One of these projects, PUSS ‚Äì Pedagogiska unders√∂kningar i synskadades studiesituation (Pedagogical investigations into the study situation of persons with visual impairments), resulted in the development and testing of new study techniques as well as a new sign system in braille for phonetics, mathematics and similar fields. Lindqvist was furthermore involved in discussions on special and integrative education with other Swedish disability organizations, notably the Swedish Disability Association. In 1970, Lindqvist played a role in Torgny Wickman‚Äôs sexual education film Mera ur k√§rlekens spr√•k (More from the Language of Love a.k.a. More about the Language of Love). Two years later, Lindqvist, as a representative of the Swedish Association of the Visually Impaired, participated in the preparation and launch of the Swedish Disability Association's first political program Ett samh√§lle f√∂r alla (A Society for All) during a congress in the Plenary Hall of the Riksdag in Stockholm. Building on his professional expertise as teacher and educational researcher, he also contributed to the assembly's working group on the education and integration of children with disabilities into regular schools. Lindqvist became chairman of the Swedish Association of the Visually Impaired in 1975 and held this post for ten years. During this time, he worked towards increased social and governmental recognition of disabled people's equal rights. A major goal was to foster cooperation between disability representatives, politicians and the broader public. Lindqvist expanded this line of work even as he was elected chair of the Swedish Disability Association from 1977 to 1985. A first test case for these political strategies came in form of the first National Disability Inquiry (Handikapputredningen), which the Swedish government initiated in 1965 and which published its final report Kultur √•t alla (Culture for All) in 1976 after intensive consultation with the disability organizations. Lindqvist's contributions to the report included better access for persons with visual impairments to literature and newspapers, but also broader questions of rights and equality. In order to publicly promote the achievements of the report, and to remind political authorities of their responsibility for implementation, the Swedish Association of the Visually Impaired together with the Swedish Deaf Association in August 1976 organized a disability rights demonstration through the city centre of Stockholm, the first of its kind in Sweden. With increased political involvement, first in the Swedish committee for the planning and execution of the United Nations‚Äô International Year of Disabled Persons in 1981, and then as Member of Parliament and Deputy Minister for Social Affairs, Lindqvist left his posts in the disability organizations. From 1992 to 2012, Lindqvist served as chair of HandikappHistoriska F√∂reningen, the Swedish Disability History Association. = Inter- and transnational advocacy = Parallel to his activities in the Swedish disability movement, Lindqvist was also engaged in international discussions on the rights of persons with disabilities. As a member of the delegation of the Swedish Association of the Visually Impaired, he attended two regional conferences of the World Council for the Welfare of the Blind (WCWB) in Copenhagen (1969) and S√£o Paulo (1974). In the 1970s, he joined the WCWB as a member and participated in the organization's rehabilitation committee. From 1974 to 1981 he served as chair of the committee. Lindqvist was also active in the International Federation of the Blind (IFB), partaking among other things in a member group that called for increased direct action of visually impaired and blind members within the organization. Lindqvist was also appointed head of the Swedish delegation to the World Congress of Rehabilitation International (RI) in Winnipeg in 1980. During the congress, a breakaway group of participants with disabilities launched a proposal for a majority representation of disability organizations within RI to counter the dominance of health and rehabilitation professionals. As the assembly rejected the proposal, Lindqvist and other disabled participants left the meeting in protest and decided to establish their own organization run exclusively by persons with disabilities. Disabled People's International (DPI) was formally established in Singapore in 1981. As elected secretary in DPI's board, Lindqvist was entrusted with drafting the organization's statutes. During the preparations for the United Nations International Year of Disabled Persons in 1981, Lindqvist in his capacity as chair for the Swedish Disability Association got invited by the Swedish government to join the national planning committee as well as the Swedish delegation to the UN. This provided him with a chance to develop and spread his views on the socio-economic dimensions of disability. Together with other international disability rights advocates he provided critical feedback on the drafts for a UN World Program of Action Concerning Disabled Persons, as became apparent in a letter he wrote to the Swedish Social Department on 7 November 1978: > \\"We cannot agree to the viewpoint that emerges from the UN proposal that > disability is a demarcated problem. Disability issues should be integrated > as a natural part of all social planning. If the intention of the > International Year of Disabled Persons is to create ways to improve the > situation for the disabled, we thus have to place disability issues in their > factual connections, i.e. in every social area like housing, schools, > culture and leisure, social service etc. The UN's program proposal expresses > an all too traditional view on disability, therefore the Swedish program > should point out that Sweden does not share this view.\\" Following a Global Meeting of Experts, organized by the United Nations and the Swedish government in Stockholm in 1987, that reviewed the implementation of the World Program of Action Concerning Disabled Persons, ideas were voiced to further integrate disability rights into the global human rights framework.Lindqvist, Bengt (17 August 1987). Global Meeting of Experts in the field of disability, Stockholm, August 17‚Äì22, 1987, in: Swedish National Archives. Riksarkivet/SE/RA/420502/02/F 5/Statens Statens Handikappr√•d/Handikapp√•rtiondet In 1988, Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson asked Lindqvist to prepare a text for an international disability rights convention, and in spring 1989 a first draft was presented to the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. After rejection of the draft by the delegates, Sweden and other countries proposed the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities as an alternative, legally non-binding policy instrument. The UN accepted the proposal in 1990, and in 1992 invited Lindqvist to act as their consultant on disability issues as well as to formulate a final text version for the Rules. They were adopted by the General Assembly in 1993. In order to monitor the implementation of the Rules in the member states, the post of UN Special Rapporteur on Disability was created. Lindqvist served in this function for three mandates from 1994 to 2002. The human rights approach to disability and the monitoring of the implementation of the Standard Rules continued to be discussed among UN representatives, experts and disability organizations. To this end Lindqvist organized a seminar in Alm√•sa, Sweden in 2000: > ‚ÄúActing upon strong support from both the High Commissioner for Human Rights > and the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, I invited a number of human rights > experts and disability activists to draft plans and ideas for capacity > building, both in the disability field and the human rights field.‚Äù In 2003 Lindqvist co-founded Disability Rights Promotion International (DRPI) with Canadian disability activist Marcia Rioux, a non-governmental initiative for the international monitoring of participatory disability rights. = UN Special Rapporteur on Disability = After the adoption of the Standard Rules, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in 1994 asked the Swedish government on their opinion about appointing Lindqvist as first UN Special Rapporteur on Disability with the task to assess and monitor the implementation of the Rules as well as to promote them among the member states of the UN, the UN General Assembly, and the UN Human Rights Council. With financial support from the Swedish and other governments, and supervised by the UN Commission for Social Development, Lindqvist accepted the post for a two-year period, later extended by resolutions of the Economic and Social Council two times (in 1997 and 2000) until 2002. Aided by a panel of experts, Lindqvist visited individual countries to review their progress on the implementation of disability rights, meet with governmental representatives as well as members of disability organizations, provided three global surveys, and participated in conferences and workshops. While the first and second mandates concentrated mainly on the implementation of the Rules in the individual member countries, Lindqvist during his third mandate turned his attention to the future development of measures and human rights instruments to protect and monitor the rights of persons with disabilities, again bringing up the idea of a convention. The UN General Assembly eventually granted the request to elaborate a Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was officially adopted in 2006. Lindqvist submitted the following reports on Monitoring the implementation of the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities to the General Assembly: *A/52/56 ‚Äì Report on First Mandate of the Special Rapporteur ‚Äì Part 1 *A/52/56 ‚Äì Report on First Mandate of the Special Rapporteur ‚Äì Part 2 *E/CN.5/2000/3 ‚Äì Report on Second Mandate of the Special Rapporteur *E/CN.5/2002/4 ‚Äì Report on Third Mandate of the Special Rapporteur ‚Äì Part 1 *E/CN.5/2002/4 ‚Äì Report on Third Mandate of the Special Rapporteur ‚Äì Part 2  Honors and commemorations  Lindqvist was appointed honorary member of various disability organizations, both in Sweden and abroad. Other honors and commemorations include: * 1999 honorary doctorate in social science at Stockholm University * 2001 honorary doctorate in community medicine at Lund University * 2013 honorary doctorate in laws at York University * In 1992, Lindqvist received the H.

In 2010, the first installment of the series, entitled ‚ÄúLife Pscycle-ology‚Äù, won the Melbourne Design Award for its confrontation regarding the issue of hidden environmental impacts of common materials. In 2014, Acaroglu published two books: ‚ÄúThe Good Design Guide‚Äù (co-authored) and ‚ÄúMAKE CHANGE: A Handbook for Creative Rebels and Change Agents‚Äù. Later in 2015, Acaroglu published an article where she narrated her new realized passion for making the design industry more eco-friendly, entitled ‚ÄúWhy I Quit Design School‚Äù.  Projects and Exhibitions  From February 2010 to July 2011, she ran the ‚ÄúRepair Workshops‚Äù project. Over the course of five days, 10 participants explored how damaged or broken items could be used for reinvention. Over the course of this exhibition, 2.5 tons of waste was saved. Afterward, she ran another interactive exhibition from July 2011 to December 2011 entitled ‚ÄúHow Ethical is your Home?‚Äù. It focused on social, ethical and environmental impacts that are generated through our homes. The next year, Acaroglu collaboratively developed the ‚ÄúUnWaste Bookcase‚Äù which emphasized the interaction between disciplines of architecture, furniture and innovation. Since its creation, the bookcase has been featured in design magazines including Artichoke and Green Magazine. The project was awarded the 2012 Melbourne design Award, and was nominated for an IDEA award. Acaroglu has designed numerous interactive products that are aimed to educate the consumer on social and environmental change. Such products include the Designercise Ideation Toolkit, Game Changer Game, Design Play Cards and the Eco Innovators Mythbusting Sustainability Quiz app. Most notably, the Design Play Cards won the CORE77 Design Education Award in 2013.

The Monahan Post Band raised money in 1930 to build a modest music shell in the park. Construction was already underway when the park's neighbors objected to the design. The project was put on hold as the band raised more money and sought a more suitable design. After President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the Civil Works Administration (CWA) in 1933, the city applied to have the new music shell included in Sioux City's projects. Henry L. Kamphoefner, an unknown Sioux City architect at that time, drew up the plans for the structure. The sculptural plaques on the front of the pavilion were designed by Herschel Elarth. The CWA approved the project on February 26, 1934 as CWA Project Number 217. The construction project required 52 tons of reinforcing steel, 4,200 bags of Portland cement, and 300 bags of white cement, and it was completed on October 17, 1934. Seating was constructed for 5,000 in the natural amphitheater. The pavilion was built using $47,436 from Federal Relief funds and $3,800 in materials from the city. It was dedicated in the spring of 1935. The Monahan Post Band continued to play here until 1948, when they became the Sioux City Municipal Band. They continue the summer-time tradition.

They convinced Harrison's father to limit contact with both mother and child as they promised they would not come after him for child support. Harrison's mother is extremely distant with her and moves out of her family home, abandoning Harrison to be raised by her maternal grandparents when she is 5. Harrison sees her father twice during her childhood, once when she is 5 and a second time when she is 10. Despite the fact that her father remarries and has children with his new wife and her mother has relationships with other men, Harrison suspects they continue to have an infrequent sexual affair during this time. When Harrison is 20, she meets her father for the first time as an adult. The two are immediately attracted to one another and cannot stop staring at one another. When she drops her father off at the airport, he gives her a kiss on the mouth which quickly turns sexual. After the kiss, Harrison is disturbed and drops out of school. She tells herself that the kiss was chaste in nature. She and her father begin obsessively calling each other, planning to meet again. Harrison's father becomes increasingly controlling of her and demands that they have sex as a means of expressing their love for one another. While Harrison repeatedly resists, she eventually acquiesces although she begins to black out as a means of coping with the rapes. Harrison's mother and grandparents suspect that she is having sex with her father but she denies it. Eventually, as Harrison has no job and no means of supporting herself, she goes to live with her father, his wife and their children. Her father continues raping her during this time and Harrison begins self-harming and contemplates suicide. Harrison's maternal grandfather and mother both become sick at the same time. When her grandfather dies, Harrison goes to the hospital morgue to see his corpse. She gives him a final kiss on the cheek which she credits with helping to break her father's control over her. Her mother also dies of breast cancer and Harrison cuts off her long hair and gives it to her mother as a gesture of goodwill. Harrison finally leaves for graduate school. Before she goes she asks her father if they can try being a normal father and daughter and he refuses. She cuts off all contact with him. In 1995, Harrison has a dream that her mother visits her and they are finally able to make peace with one another. Reception The memoir received mixed reviews. The New York Times considered it \\"a powerful piece of writing, a testament to evil and hope.\\" References American memoirs 1997 non-fiction books ","title":"The Kiss (memoir)"},{"id":"52570824","text":"Group A of the EuroBasket Women 2017 took place between 16 and 19 June 2017.

The reserve contains an open woodland and bushland which feature native plants, such as eucalyptus trees, and recreational areas. Landform The reserve is on an elevated ridge that is high towards the eastern point of the park, which features a broad panorama over the surrounding area within the park. The reserve is strategically placed between the industrial areas to the north and residential areas to the south of the park, thus giving a visual alleviation from these surroundings. The topsoil of many areas in the park has been eroded due to wind and water, leaving the clay sub soil exposed. Features Recreational characteristics in the reserve include shaded picnic areas with barbeque, walking paths and a number of children's playgrounds all within the native bushland. In the park, there is a prominent monument made in bluestone that is dedicated to the fallen World War I soldiers who had resided in Wetherill Park. Ecology =Flora= Cumberland Plain Woodland remnant The reserve features a dry sclerophyll forest with an understory of sod grasses, and a gradient \\"meadow-like\\" grassland in the open areas. A number of native trees, such as, Forest Red Gum and Grey Box are found in the park, which are remnants of the Cumberland Plain Woodland. The trees would stand at and would provide shade. There is a differentiation between the vegetation at the western and eastern borders of the park. The trees on the western end are more thinly distributed, whilst those in the eastern portion are more lush with a grassy floor. Native trees such as Paperbarks, She-oaks and Bottlebrush have been recently planted. Bunya pines (Araucaria bidwillii) are also found in the reserve. Furthermore, some of the trees have sustained damages in their branches and trunks. Pine logs and wharf timbers are used to enclose the car park space. =Fauna= The reserve contains Australian animals, namely birds, such as, Australian Magpie, Galah, Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, Eastern Rosella and Noisy Miner.

As related by Rev. John Swete (d. 1821) who passed through Colyton in 1795 on one of his Picturesque Tours, tradition states that after the Duke of Monmouth landed on Torbay at Lyme Regis on 11 June 1685, at the commencement of his ill-fated Monmouth Rebellion, he proceeded to Colyton and was secreted in Great House, then still occupied by Sir Walter Yonge, 3rd Baronet, whose new house at Escot was not completed until after the Rebellion.Swete, Vol.2, p. 110 It is possibleSwete, Vol.2, p.110 that the 3rd Baronet was a supporter of the Rebellion, as it is known that several of his workmen engaged on the building of Escot House left their work to fight for the Duke at the Battle of Sedgemoor, Somerset, on 6 July 1685, where the Rebellion was finally quashed. Several of these workmen- soldiers were captured by the king's forces and were executed at a crossway near Escot on the order of the notorious Judge Jeffreys \\"as a specimen of his suspicions of (the 3rd Baronet)\\"Swete, Vol.2, p. 110, quoting Sir George Yonge, 5th Baronet (1731‚Äì1812), grandson of the 3rd Baronet Above a chimneypiece in the north-east first floor room of Great House survives a depiction of the coat of arms of the Stuart kings.Listed building text, \\"Duke of Monmouth is said to have stayed in this house and the Stuart arms were put up to show loyalty to the King\\", a somewhat confused rationale as the Yonges were suspected of supporting Monmouth who wanted to depose King James II, a legitimate Stuart monarch Following their removal to Escot the Yonge family let Great House to tenants and it \\"became forsaken\\" although it and the appendage estates continued to be owned by the Yonge family until 1790, when they were exchanged for lands in the parish of Talaton owned by the Yonge's neighbour Sir John de la Pole, 6th BaronetSwete, Vol.2, p.110 of Shute in the parish of Colyton.

On the south side of the chancel is the chapel of the Pole family of Shute, which purchased Great House. Yonge and Pole families The Yonge and Pole families, closely related through the Peryams, and both resident in the parish of Colyton, had long competed with each other to win one of the two Parliamentary seats of the nearby Rotten Borough of Honiton, an electorate which expected to be bought by generous bribes which over time proved exorbitant to candidates. The Peryam connection was as follows: Walter Yonge (1579‚Äì1649) of Colyton married Jane Periam, a daughter and co-heiress of Sir John Peryam (1541 ‚Äì c. 1618), brother of Sir William Peryam (15349 October 1604) Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, whose daughter Mary Peryam was the wife of Sir William Pole (1561‚Äì1635), MP, of Shute, Colyton. Thus the wife of the famous Devon historian Sir William Pole was the first cousin of the famous Devon diarist Walter Yonge.

Pole who lived in this parish, should have taken no notice of the property of the Yonge family, which was very considerable\\".Polwhele, Richard, History of Devon, vol.2, p. 309 This refers to the fact that Pole's work, which consists primarily of describing ownership of estates, (admittedly consisting merely of a mass of notes and not published until several generations following his death, with much omitted due to destruction by fire and Civil War) under the section \\"Coliton\\"Pole, Sir William (d. 1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John-William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, p. 135 makes no mention of Great House or the Yonges.

The present city hall in Sioux City was previously the post office, federal building and courthouse. This building replaced it. It was designed by the local architectural firm of Beuttler & Arnold with the Des Moines firm of Proudfoot, Rawson, Souers & Thomas providing input and oversight. Construction began in 1932 under the direction of the Acting Supervising Architect of the Treasury James A. Wetmore. The building was dedicated on December 29, 1933. The Federal Government had paid $270,000 for the property, and about $725,000 on construction. Architecturally, the three- story, stone structure is a combination of Stripped Classicism and Art Deco. The post office moved to a new facility in 1984, and additional office space and a new courtroom were created in the building. A further renovation was undertaken from 1999 to 2000 and a third courtroom a judge's chamber, jury deliberation room, library, and holding cell for defendants were added. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. Building history Sioux City was founded in the 1850s by Dr. John Cook as a trading post and docking point for steamships. As the river town grew, the population required an increasing number of federal services, and the city was selected as the location of a new post office, federal building, and courthouse to replace an existing federal building (currently used as City Hall). Construction commenced in 1932. Beuttler & Arnold, a renowned architectural firm responsible for numerous buildings in Sioux City, including the Masonic Temple, Methodist Hospital, YWCA, and East and West Junior High Schools, designed the building. The equally well-known architectural firm of Proudfoot, Rawson, Souers & Thomas of Des Moines was selected to provide input and oversight to the project. The building was constructed under the auspices of Acting Supervising Architect of the Treasury James A. Wetmore. A site on the block bounded by Douglas, Pearl, Sixth, and Seventh streets was purchased for $270,000, and approximately $725,000 was spent on construction; in all, the costs totaled $100,000 less than anticipated. When the foundation was excavated by a steam shovel, workers who were unemployed as a result of the Great Depression protested in hope of convincing the government to revert to more the more traditional, labor-intensive method of using men with hand tools and horse-drawn equipment, but the mechanized method prevailed. The local press considered the building a great source of civic pride and monitored construction progress closely. The building was dedicated on December 29, 1933, with a local newspaper headline proclaiming \\"Postoffice is Uncle Sam's Gift to City.\\" When postal services moved to a new facility on Jackson Street in 1984, the building interior was modified to create additional office space and a new courtroom. During renovations from 1999 to 2000, another courtroom was added, along with other judicial rooms, including a judge's chamber, jury deliberation room, library, and holding cell for defendants. SiouxLandmark, a local historic preservation organization, praised the renovations and the U.S. General Services Administration's commitment to preserving this important downtown historic building. Architecture The Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse is a skillful blend of the Stripped Classical and Art Deco styles of architecture, a combination that was commonly used for federal building design in the 1930s. The mixture adopted traditional classical forms of architecture while abandoning excessive ornament in favor of more subtle stylized decorative components that are typical of the Art Deco style. It is a refined building that conveys the dignity and stability of the federal government, which was particularly important during the Great Depression. The building has an E-shaped footprint with a boxlike form and is three stories tall. A central stepped tower ascends above the roofline on the facade of the building. The building rests upon a five-foot base of granite quarried from Pine Mountain, Iowa, while the remainder is clad in light gray limestone ashlar from New Bedford, Indiana. A modest entablature with chevron (V-shaped) motifs, a dentil (rectangular block) course, and raised limestone coping tops the building. Windows throughout the building are narrow vertical forms with embossed bronze spandrels between each story. Each opening is topped by a dentil course. Stylized fluted pilasters (attached columns) divide the window bays and are a classical feature. The pilaster capitals, however, contain a simplified floral design characteristic of Art Deco architecture. The entrances on the Sixth Street elevation are flanked by fluted pilasters with carved limestone capitals featuring a stylized eagle motif, which alludes to the federal presence. The interior also displays many Art Deco components. The staircase features an exuberant Art Deco design with a cast-bronze ziggurat newel post and fluted bronze railing. The lobby is finished with light gray polished marble on the floors and walls, which are topped by an elaborate painted entablature with sunrise and chevron designs. The south wall of the lobby contains a series of openings originally used as postal service windows. Although most are now covered, they retain their original fluted bronze surrounds and bronze floral grilles that sit atop panels of Tennessee Appalachian coral marble. The main courtroom, located on the third floor, contains restrained classically inspired ornament. Dark walnut wainscot panels rise ten feet up the walls. Some of the panels are punctuated by cast-bronze ventilation grilles with a scalloped pattern. Behind the judge's bench, a walnut panel with a shield is topped by a pediment. Beneath it is a metal plaque with an eagle design. An elaborate coffered plaster ceiling with leaf and dolphin designs is located in the courtroom, and original bronze pendant light fixtures are also present. The courtroom lobby floor is covered with small squares of Tennessee Appalachian golden vein marble that are grouped into larger squares with a central, diamond-shaped inset of black marble. Walls are also clad in golden-vein marble. Fluted marble pilasters topped with a gold star motif flank window and door openings. A plaster entablature surrounds the top of the room. Painted in terra cotta and sepia tones, it features geometric Art Deco motifs. Some offices retain original wood panel doors and surrounds, marble sills, and wood picture rails.

The play was written in 2015, and inspired by Reinholz's wife and co-founder of the Native Voices theatre company at the Autry Museum of the American West, Jean Bruce Scott. Although Off the Rails follows the plot of Measure for Measure, infamous for being one of Shakespeare's problem plays, the power struggles between the characters help rather than hurt the play's ability to send a powerful message by accentuating the racist treatment of Native Americans. Reinholz utilizes specific projection images and traditional Native American tribal songs and language in the script of the play in order to make a political statement about the horrors of Indian boarding schools.  Synopsis  = Prologue = Set in the mid 1880s, the play opens with an active main street featuring an Indian boarding school/jail, Stewed Prunes Saloon, and brothel. Momaday, a love-struck 16 year‚Äìold Pawnee Native American, and Grandfather, also Pawnee, introduce their story of removal from their homeland Kit Tuk Creek to Genoa, Nebraska. This scene leads into the love story between Momaday and Caitlin, a 16-year-old Irish orphan. They secretly meet in the street to talk, occasionally in the forbidden Pawnee language. It is revealed that Caitlin is pregnant with Momaday‚Äôs child and the couple have been married in ‚ÄòPawnee way‚Äô, rather than Christian ceremony, thereby casting their intercourse as an unlawful act in Genoa. = Act I = Act I, Scene I begins with Lady Overdone‚Äôs Saloon filled with raucous people polishing their routines for the upcoming auditions for Buffalo Bill‚Äôs Wild West Show. In juxtaposition, we see the mayor or Genoa, General Gatt, and his right-hand man, McDonald, in the boarding school office. General Gatt claims that he will be hunting the totonka and will therefore resign his position to Angelo, a captain in the Army. Under Angelo‚Äôs instruction, Momaday has been sentenced to death for fornicating with Caitlin before any Christian marriage. Reacting to this news, Alexie, a tribal chairman‚Äôs son, and Caitlin search for hope in Momaday‚Äôs ‚Äúchaste and pure‚Äù sister, Isabel. Upon Alexie‚Äôs visit to Isabel, he shares the bad news of Momaday‚Äôs sentence, prompting a discussion of the worth of the Native Indian in Genoa. The Pawnee woman within Isabel agrees to plea with Angelo, hoping that her Christian way of life will persuade him to free Momaday. After Isabel begs for her brother‚Äôs release proves unsuccessful, Angelo speaks to the audience about his lustful thoughts towards Isabel. Back at the Saloon, Overdone‚Äôs auditions are also proving unsuccessful until Mariana is encouraged to sing her song ‚ÄúWhoa Willie, Take Your Time.‚Äù Caitlin then visits the Saloon in search of a place to stay until her beloved Momaday is safe. Upon Isabel‚Äôs second visit to Angelo, a proposition is made: Angelo informs Isabel that her brother will be set free in exchange for her virginity. Isabel refuses immediately. Meanwhile, trapped in a prison cell, Momaday speaks and sings to Grandfather, asking for guidance. Isabel soon visits her grief-stricken brother and explains Angelo‚Äôs twisted proposal. Overdone enters, and out of disgust, proposes a plan to save both Momaday‚Äôs life and his sister‚Äôs chastity: Isabel will agree to Angelo‚Äôs deal, however, unbeknownst to Angelo, Overdone will switch Isabel with Angelo‚Äôs former fianc√© Mariana. = Act II = The second act opens with a messy and disorganised rehearsal of musicians and saloon folk. A disguised General Gatt and McDonald are hidden in a secret room rehearsing a speech regarding a new railroad. McDonald expresses the urgency of the apparently missing Kiowa boys and Potowatomi girls that have escaped the ghastly boarding school and its terrible conditions, to which General Gatt responds with more railroad excitement. That evening, Mariana, Isabel, and Overdone exchange keys to the garden in which the plan will unfold. Meanwhile, the Sheriff searches for a successful hangman for Momaday‚Äôs upcoming execution. Pryor and B‚Äôstard claim they are suitable for the job and begin to work together in preparation, while Overdone pleas for the execution to be delayed. After reading Angelo‚Äôs ledger book, McDonald discovers him stealing from the boarding schools. Angelo has also gone back on his word and, despite believing he has taken Isabel‚Äôs virginity, continues with Momaday‚Äôs execution. Overdone then carries out a new plot against Angelo by seeking a corpse‚Äôs head at the prison to fool him into believing Momaday has already been beheaded. Upon General Gatt‚Äôs return to Genoa, Overdone rallies the people to confront the General with Angelo‚Äôs crimes. Angelo of course denies these accusations but is proven guilty and sentenced to death. In response, Isabel and Mariana plea for Angelo‚Äôs life, and he is instead required to marry Mariana as was previously arranged. To Isabel and Caitlin‚Äôs delight, Momaday is then uncovered and shown to be alive, invoking confusion and celebration amongst Genoa. General Gatt reveals to the town the exciting news of the upcoming railroad, as well as promising improvements to the destructive boarding school. The play ends with Buffalo Bill entering the scene and taking a photo with the cast. There is then a closing a musical number and tribal song.

It was proclaimed on 23 October 1913 and was named after Sir Day Hort Bosanquet, the Governor of South Australia from 1909 to 1914.  Description  The county covers land extending from the southern end of Lake Gairdner in the north-east to the southern side of the Gawler Ranges in the south-west. Most of its extent is within the Eyre Peninsula because the peninsula‚Äôs northern boundary passes through the county in an east-west direction. It is bounded to the west by the counties of Dufferin and Robinson, to the south by the County of Le Hunte, and to the east by the County of Hore- Ruthven. There are no formal settlements within the county. The following gazetted localities, mainly based on pastoral leases, are within the county: Thurlga and parts of Buckleboo, Carriewarloo, Cooyerdoo, Corunna Station, Gawler Ranges, Hiltaba, Kolendo, Lake Gairdner, Mount Ive, and Yardea. A road labelled as Nonning Road and then as Hiltaba Road passes through the county in an east-west direction on its way from Iron Knob in the east. Other roads passing through the county include the Mail Run Road, which runs from Nonning Road in the east to Hiltaba Road in the west via the locality of Thurlga, Buckleboo Road which runs from the Eyre Highway in the south to Mail Run Road in the north, Yardea Road which runs from the Eyre Highway in the south via the locality of Gawler Ranges to Hiltaba Road in the north, and Skull Camp Tank Road which runs from the junction of Nonning and Hiltaba Roads towards Kingoonya in the north. The county's land is mainly used for primary production and conservation, the latter including the Gawler Ranges National Park and Lake Gairdner National Park. While most of the county is located within the state‚Äôs Pastoral Unincorporated Area and the state‚Äôs Far North region, the Hundred of Pildappa is entirely located within the local government area of Wudinna District Council and the state‚Äôs Eyre and Western region. Constituent hundred As of 2014, the Hundred of Pildappa () has been the only hundred proclaimed within the county. It was proclaimed on 23 October 1913. It covers an area of and is named after Pildappa Hill (Pildappa Rock), a feature located within the hundred and whose name is derived from a ‚Äúnative word for 'rockwater'‚Äù.

He served on the Berkeley Housing Commission and Rent Stabilization Board from 2004 to 2009 and represented District 4 on the Berkeley City Council from 2009 to 2016. He is the first Latino elected Berkeley's mayor and one of the youngest mayors in the San Francisco Bay Area. Arregu√≠n has described himself as an \\"unapologetic progressive\\" and said he wants to \\"restore Berkeley to the forefront of progressive leadership on the environment and social justice.\\" He has strongly opposed legislation that would require cities to allow denser and taller housing near public transport centers and ease the parking requirements cities can impose on housing development.  Early life Arregu√≠n was born in Fresno, California, and grew up in San Francisco, California. His parents and grandparents were farmworkers. At age 9 Arregu√≠n became involved in the campaign to change the name of Army Street to Cesar Chavez Street in the historically Latino Mission District of San Francisco. Arregu√≠n continued to be involved through efforts against reversing the name change in 1995, described as having \\"campaigned tirelessly to keep one of the Mission's main thoroughfares named after his idol, Cesar Chavez.\\" Arregu√≠n was the first in his family to attend college, and attended the University of California Berkeley. While at UC Berkeley he served as the City Affairs Director for the Associated Students of the University of California and was elected to the Berkeley Rent Stabilization board in 2004, serving as chair until 2008. Arregu√≠n has also served on the Housing Advisory Commission, Zoning Adjustments Board, and Downtown Area Plan Advisory Committee.  Berkeley City Councilmember  From 2008 to 2016 Arregu√≠n served two terms as a Berkeley City Council member representing City Council District 4. On the council Arregu√≠n drafted and passed over 300 pieces of legislation. He helped increase the city's minimum wage to $15, co-wrote the Downtown Area Plan, passed the Affordable Housing Mitigation Fee used to build affordable housing, created police reform after Black Lives Matter demonstrations, and worked to save the historic Main Post Office.  Mayor of Berkeley  Arregu√≠n announced his candidacy for mayor of Berkeley in October 2015. He faced seven candidates for the open seat, and was endorsed by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the Sierra Club, and the Alameda Democratic Party. Arregu√≠n won 51% of the vote after ranked-choice tabulation. At age 32 he became the second-youngest mayor in Berkeley's history. Prior to his swearing-in, Arregu√≠n vowed as mayor-elect alongside City Council members that \\"Berkeley would remain a sanctuary city and continue to shield its undocumented residents from deportation.\\" Arregu√≠n was sworn in on December 1, 2016, and in his inaugural address said that \\"in light of the national election, Berkeley, now more than ever, needs to lead.\\" In January 2017, following the release of Donald Trump's executive orders calling for the construction of a border wall, and enforcement of immigration law including the withholding of federal funds from sanctuary cities, Arregu√≠n released a statement along with other progressive mayors in the region opposing the \\"hateful and harmful policies.\\" When a talk by controversial \\"alt-right\\" commentator Milo Yiannopoulos was announced on the University of California, Berkeley campus in February 2017, Arregu√≠n said, \\"Bigotry is unacceptable. Hate speech isn't welcome in our community.\\" After violent protests caused UC Berkeley to cancel the talk, Arreguin said, \\"we as a city do not make a decision about inviting a speaker. We do not make a decision to cancel a speaker. This was a decision of the university.\\" In response to the same incident, Arregu√≠n referred to Yiannopoulos as a \\"white nationalist,\\" but later retracted this characterization, and instead described him as an \\"alt- rightist.\\" Arregu√≠n reportedly began receiving death threats from Yiannopoulos supporters across the country after his statements were covered by right-wing news website Breitbart News, Yiannopoulos's employer at the time. With Arregu√≠n's backing, the Berkeley City Council voted in March 2017 to divest from companies involved in constructing the proposed border wall with Mexico, becoming one of the first cities in the country to do so. The council also passed a resolution calling for the impeachment of Donald Trump, co-sponsored by Arregu√≠n, who said, \\"Every day there‚Äôs a new ethical problem that warrants impeachment.\\" Arregu√≠n reportedly again became a target of death threats when conservative commentator Ann Coulter planned to speak on the UC Berkeley campus and canceled her appearance over safety concerns in April 2017. During protests over Coulter‚Äôs appearance, Arregu√≠n was denounced for supporting the far-left group BAMN (By Any Means Necessary), which has incited violent protests, after it became known that he had \\"liked\\" their Facebook page. In response, Arregu√≠n said that \\"following or liking pages does not mean you support what that group is doing,\\" adding, \\"I am not a member of BAMN, and I do not support the views and the violent actions of that group.\\" He later unfollowed the group. In May 2017 Arregu√≠n co-sponsored the successful resolution to divest the City of Berkeley from Wells Fargo Bank in response to allegations that the bank opened fraudulent deposit accounts, the bank's financing of private prisons and the Dakota Access Pipeline. After Trump's withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement in June 2017, Arregu√≠n pledged along with 350 other mayors \\"to uphold the Paris Agreement goals even though President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the international agreement to combat climate change.\\" Following the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally, attention was brought to a far-right rally planned for August 27, 2017, in Berkeley. Ahead of the event, Arregu√≠n stated that his office was \\"currently exploring all options, including whether we have the legal means to stop this rally from taking place.\\" At a press conference with local leaders including Rep. Barbara Lee and State Sen. Nancy Skinner, Arregu√≠n called for opponents of the rally to hold counter- demonstrations in different locations to avoid violence between groups. Arreguin has voiced strong opposition to California legislation that would require cities to allow denser and taller housing near public transport centrals and ease the parking requirements cities can impose on housing developments; the legislation is intended to alleviate the housing shortage in California and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Arreguin described the bill as a \\"a declaration of war against our neighborhoods\\", saying it would remove some of cities' zoning rights and lead to unwanted density in Berkeley. In 2017 Arreguin was at the center of an effort to illegally reject housing planned for development in South Berkeley. The project, proposed by Baran Studio Architecture and owner CS Construction, was for three single-family homes and conformed to all local zoning requirements. The mayor and city council violated California state law with the vote, and the city was subsequently sued on multiple occasions. The project was eventually approved and built. The story was also the subject of a lengthy New York Times piece on the housing affordability crisis. = Other roles = Arregu√≠n is the President of the Association of Bay Area Governments,ABAG Executive Board Roster the Bay Area's regional planning agency and Council of Governments.

Chris Mason (born 1976) is an Australian artist. Mason resides in Melbourne. His work is held in several public collections, including those of the National Gallery of Australia and the State Library of Victoria.  Career, themes and style  Both Mason's lack of formal training and autism have identified him as one of the key figures within the Outsider Art category in Australia. This categorisation is confirmed by his repeated inclusion in Outsider Art exhibitions and fairs, both in Australia and in the USA. However, in recent years his work has also achieved success in more conventional art institutions and has been acquired for major collections at the National Gallery of Australia and the State Library of Victoria. Mason cites as a major influence the artist Ron Mueck, with whom his work shares the Hyperrealist style that emerged from photorealism, and whose subject matter is derived from reinterpretations of photographic imagery. His signature depictions of voluptuous women are sourced from images collected from the Internet and various publications; in his search for reference material he aims for women whose dimensions result in the figures being \\"almost as tall as they are wide,\\" dimensions which he views as \\"perfect\\" and \\"archetypal.\\" In recent years Mason has developed a tendency towards smaller-scale ceramic pieces and has expressed a strong interest in pursuing taxidermy in his work, which APA Studio Manager James McDonald describes as \\"a logical next step.\\" Mason has exhibited at Gertrude Contemporary, c3 Contemporary Art Space and Linden New Art.

It induces many behavioral changes on its host. Once inside a fish's eye, it can cause partial blindness and several behavioral changes to the intermediate host. Other species of flukes are able to turn into dormant cysts at certain stages of development, but Tylodelphys spp. stays active and roams free inside the fish's eye, giving it an opportunity for it to induce parasite behavior. When Tylodelphys larvae crawl around the inside of the fish's eye, it can get in between the retina and the lens. This can cause partial blindness to the fish, rendering the fish unable to notice predators. Tylodelphys consists of two species, Tylodelphys clavata (von Nordmann, 1832) and Tylodelphys podicipina Kozicka & Niewiadomska, 1960. Life cycle Tylodelphys spp. has a complex three-host life cycle, with a variety of fish- and amphibian-eating birds and lymnaeid or planorbid gastropods as first intermediate hosts.Blasco- Costa, I., Poulin, R. & Presswell, B. (2017). Morphological description and molecular analyses of Tylodelphys sp. (Trematoda: Diplostomidae) newly recorded from the freshwater fish Gobiomorphus cotidianus (common bully) in New Zealand. Journal of Helminthology, 91(3), 332‚Äì345. Tylodelphys must enter the gut of fish-eating bird, which would naturally involve the fish being eaten by the said bird such as ciconiiforms, suliforms, falconiforms and podicipediforms acting as definitive hosts. Tylodelphys species can also infect the brain or the body cavity of their second intermediate hosts, which are typically fish but sometimes amphibians. The common intermediate host, the bully, Tylodelphys dwells in its host's eyes in the vitreous liquid between the lens and the retina. Behavior Like many Trematode parasites, Tylodelphys plays a huge role in manipulation of behavior. A studyStumbo, A. & Poulin, R. (2016). Possible mechanism of host manipulation resulting from a diel behaviour pattern of eye-dwelling parasites. Parasitology, 143(10), 1261‚Äì1267. was done where the particular behavior of the parasite itself can affect the behavior of the host. Tylodelphys spp. has daily routines, where it shifts it position in the eye, varying through the day. It is during the day where these flukes sit between the lens and the retina, which block the eyesight of the fish. During the night, the flukes settle down to the bottom of the eye, which allows the fish to have a sense of sight. A question that is then posed is why doesn't the parasite just stay in front of the retina all the time. In recent studies, it is shown that not all predators are the same for Tylodelphys. In the day time, the predators of the bullies are fish eating birds, but at night the main predators are longfin eels. It's better for the fluke if the fish can still see and avoid predators at night, so hence the fluke keeps the eyes covered in the day but moves it away at night. Tylodelphys spp. metacercariae may limit the bully's ability to perceive visual cues of predatory threat by obscuring vision during the day, in a similar manner to Diplostomum induced cataracts, favoring completion of the trematode's life cycle. It is also important to note that metacercariae are often considered passive; however, in this life cycle it demonstrated that metacercariae exhibit a complex behavioral phenotype playing a key role in furthering their life history.

History The District Council of Stepney was proclaimed on 25 July 1867, separating from the original District Council of Payneham. It was divided into five wards: Hackney, Stepney, Payneham, Marden and Stepney North. On 27 February 1868, the original Payneham council was renamed the District Council of Campbelltown, and when the western part of the Stepney council was severed to form the Corporate Town of St Peters on 30 August 1883, the remainder of the Stepney council assumed the District Council of Payneham name. The council rented offices at the Payneham Institute, and met at the Masonic Lodge Hall. It became a municipal corporation on 1 October 1945 as the Corporate Town of Payneham, and gained city status as the City of Payneham on 28 November 1964, when the population officially exceeded 15,000. In 1964, the council opened the new Civic Centre, containing council offices, a library and two community halls. In the 1960s and 1970s, it was involved in developing a series of community facilities: Adey Reserve (1961), Patterson Reserve (1966) and clubrooms (1970), Payneham Memorial Swimming Centre (1968), Payneham and District Senior Citizens Centre (1972), Drage Reserve (1974) and the Payneham Youth Centre (1978). A new Payneham Public Library was opened in 1980, and the Payneham Community Centre opened in 1984. In 1985, it covered an area of 7.1 square kilometres, with a population of 16,502 as of the 1981 census, down from 17,543 in 1971. It had significant communities of both elderly residents (19% of the population) and people from Italian backgrounds (approximately 14% born in Italy, with an estimated 40% of Italian descent). The 1973-1975 Royal Commission into Local Government Areas had recommended that the St Peters council merge back into Payneham, but this was rejected at the time. However, pressure for the smaller inner-city municipalities to merge continued, and on 1 November 1997 it amalgamated with the City of Kensington and Norwood and the Town of St Peters to form the City of Norwood Payneham & St Peters.

A new 312th began forming in December in Siberia, and this second formation served again in front of Moscow, in the fighting in the area of Rzhev and Sychevka during 1942 and into 1943. In the latter year, the division distinguished itself in the liberation of Smolensk and received that city's name as an honorific. As the war concluded, the men and women of the 312th gained additional honors, and ended the war fighting near Berlin. The division was disbanded shortly after the end of the conflict.  1st Formation  The 312th began forming on July 10, 1941, at Akyubinsk in the Central Asia Military District,Walter S.

Kornei Mikhailovich Andrusenko was given command of the 1081st Rifle Division in late July, a post he would hold until transferred on October 17. The division was given about six weeks to form up before it was sent by rail all the way to the Northwestern Front, ending its journey in the Tikhvin area east of Leningrad. It was first assigned to the 52nd Army as that Army was forming up in August as a separate army under STAVKA control.Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad 1941 - 1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2002, pp. 557-58 During September the 312th helped to contest the German advance towards Leningrad, but as the German Typhoon offensive developed west of Moscow, the division got orders to redeploy by rail from Valdai towards the capital, beginning on October 6. Due to the chaos of the time this redeployment went in a piecemeal fashion, and the division's rifle regiments were sent into combat right off the trains, into the forces of the Maloyaroslavets Defense Sector, which became the 43rd Army, in Western Front, by October 12. Fighting piecemeal against armored forces was a deadly business; by October 18 the 859th Artillery Regiment was manning the lines at Maloyaroslavets with 34 artillery pieces, but the rifle regiments had taken very heavy losses in less than a week and were no longer combat-effective. By the end of the month the division was effectively destroyed, and the remnants were distributed to other units in the Western Front.

Aleksandr Ivanovich Golovanov was assigned as commander. In January, 1942, this division became the second formation of the 312th.Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys, p. 100 It acquired the same order of battle as the first formation. When the division was fully formed in April it had 12,299 officers and men assigned, and 56.6 percent of them were under 25 years of age. On the one hand, the division had a large percentage of young, presumably fit soldiers. On the other hand, none of these young men are likely to have had any military experience or much training before they joined the division. In late April the 312th moved west to the Moscow Military District, and the following month was assigned first to the 2nd Reserve, then to the 4th Reserve Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. In July it went to Western Front, assigned to 20th Army, where it saw its first combat during the First Rzhev‚ÄìSychyovka Offensive Operation.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 117 On August 11, 1942, the division came under the command of Colonel (Major General as of October 16, 1943) Aleksandr Moiseyevsky, who had previously commanded the 303rd Rifle Division. Moiseyevsky would remain in command of the 312th for the duration of the war. During the Second Rzhev-Sychevka Offensive Operation the division was in the 29th Army which was supporting 20th Army's left flank with limited attacks.Glantz, Zhukov's Greatest Defeat, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 1999, pp. 261, 337, 359 In March, 1943, the division was transferred again, now to 5th Army, still in Western Front.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 118 =Battle of Smolensk= During the second phase of Operation Suvorov 5th Army joined the offensive on August 31, attacking the left flank of the German XII Army Corps with five rifle divisions supported by tanks and advancing 13 km in a single day. This made it pointless to mount a defense of Dorogobuzh, and the 312th entered the empty town on September 1.Robert Forczyk, Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance, Osprey Publishing, Oxford, UK, 2019, Kindle ed. On September 25, still serving in 5th Army, the 312th was granted the honorific \\"Smolensk\\" for its role in the liberation of that city: Following this triumph, 5th Army was ordered to continue its advance westward along the road to Orsha. The 312th and 207th Rifle Divisions led this advance (the Army had only three divisions and a fortified region at this time) on October 2. After crossing the Malaia Berezina River between the villages of Danki and Privole, the two divisions encountered the defenses of the German 52nd and 197th Infantry Divisions of XXVII Army Corps. The 52nd, in particular, had been badly weakened in previous fighting. By the end of October 3 the Soviet divisions had captured two more villages and driven a wedge into the 52nd's defensive front. The history of 5th Army states: By the evening of the next day the 312nd and 207th had driven a gap 10km wide and 6km deep, unhinging the entire German defense of the Malaia Berezina. On October 8 they were joined by the 208th Rifle Division and continued the advance, occupying the road hub and strong point of Lyubavichi and reaching the main stream of the Berezina, which forced further German withdrawals. The next day the advance hit the right flank of the 256th Infantry Division south of Liozna. By midday on October 11 the 312th reached the Chernitsa River, and had almost reached Babinovichi. At this point the advance came to a halt, in part because the Soviet armies on 5th Army's flanks had not been as successful.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 48, 63-65, 675. Quote taken from [Eng.] Greeting victory: The combat path of 5th Army, (Moscow: Nauka, 1970) p. 168 On October 12, Western Front tried to renew the drives of those less successful armies, and 5th Army was tasked to protect the right flank of 31st Army over the coming days. From October 16 - 20 the Front carried out a major regrouping as directed by the STAVKA. The 312th and the other divisions of 5th Army were transferred to 31st Army while 5th Army headquarters moved to the rear. The division was soon subordinated to the 7th Guards Rifle Corps in the 10th Guards Army.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 71, 79-82 This Army was transferred to the 2nd Baltic Front in December.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 118 Advance In March, 1944, the 312th went into the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, where it was assigned to the 69th Army. The following month that Army went to the front in the 1st Belorussian Front. The division served the entire last year of the war in Europe, from April, 1944 to May, 1945, in the 91st Rifle Corps under those Army and Front commands.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 118. Note that Sharp mistakenly gives 60th Army instead 69th in the last sentence of his entry. During the first phase of the Soviet summer offensive, the 69th was part of the western grouping of its Front, in the vicinity of Kovel, and played little role in the initial fighting.Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, pp. 207-11 This changed with the start of the Brest - Siedlce Offensive Operation on July 18. The 69th, along with the 8th Guards and 47th Armies, formed the shock groups for this assault, which began at 0530 hours following a 30-minute artillery preparation. It was soon determined that most of the enemy had already withdrawn to his next defense line, and the first and some of the second trench lines were carried in the first 90 minutes. That second defense line along the Vyzhuvka River was soon reached and even breached in the Khvorostuv area. This advance was so rapid that the German forces continued retreating to their next line along the Western Bug. By the end of July 20, 69th Army had reached as far as the eastern outskirts of Dubienka after an advance of 8 - 12 km that day. The following day, for political reasons, 69th and 8th Guards Armies were redirected towards Lublin, which was liberated by 8th Guards on July 23.Soviet General Staff, Operation Bagration, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, Kindle ed., vol. 2, ch. 11 On August 9 the 312th was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its role in the liberation of Kovel. At the start of the Vistula-Oder Offensive, 69th Army was in the second echelon of its Front's grouping in the Pulawy bridgehead, which exploited the breakthrough along with mobile forces in the general direction of Radom, and then towards Lodz. Radom was captured on January 16. On January 26, 69th Army was given orders to continue the offensive and force the line of the Oder River near Frankfurt.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, ed. and trans. by Richard W.

Education and career Chance earned her BA from Purdue University in 1967 and her MA (1968) and PhD (1971) from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. She taught at the University of Saskatchewan and then moved to Rice University in 1973 to teach Old English literature; she was the first woman appointed to a tenure-track position in the English department. She was appointed to the Andrew W. Mellon Professorship in 2008 and became emerita upon her retirement in 2011. She is founder president of the Consortium for the Teaching of the Middle Ages. At Rice, Chance established what became the Medieval Studies Program and also headed the first Women's Studies program within the English department, which was nationally noted. In the late 1980s she was first president of the Rice Commission on Women. She unsuccessfully sued the university for gender discrimination in 1988. In 1995 she established and funded the Julia Mile Chance Prize for Excellence in Teaching, named for her mother, to honor women faculty members. Publications As Jane Chance Nitzsche, Chance published a revised version of her dissertation as The Genius Figure in Antiquity and the Middle Ages in 1975. Beginning in 1994, she then published a three-volume history of medieval mythography. Volume 1, From Roman North Africa to the School of Chartres, A.D. 433‚Äì1177, was termed \\"monumental\\" and \\"highly detailed\\" by a reviewer in Arthuriana who nonetheless found the focus on gender poorly supported; although the reviewer in Speculum called it \\"disappointing\\"; Volume 2, From the School of Chartres to the Court at Avignon, 1177‚Äì1350, was called \\"immensely learned and ambitious\\" in the same journal in 2002. The final volume, The Emergence of Italian Humanism, 1321‚Äì1475, appeared in 2015, and was judged by one reviewer to be less comprehensive than claimed. In 1995 she also published Mythographic Chaucer: the Fabulation of Sexual Politics. Other works in which Chance focuses on medieval women and gender studies include Woman as Hero in Old English Literature (1986), which investigated, among other things, the concept of women as peace-weavers and their frequent failure, and The Literary Subversions of Medieval Women (2007); she edited Gender and Text in the Later Middle Ages (1996) and Women Medievalists and the Academy (2005), which Helen Damico, writing in JEGP, called \\"massive in size and major in significance\\". Chance is also a leading Tolkien scholar. Her books in this field include Tolkien's Art: A \\"Mythology for England\\" (1979; revised edition 2001), The Lord of the Rings: The Mythology of Power (1992; revised edition 2001), in which she uses the theoretical framework of Michel Foucault, Tolkien and the Invention of Myth: A Reader (2004), and Tolkien, Self and Other: \\"This Queer Creature\\" (2016), a biography with literary analysis. Honors Chance was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1980 and has also received membership in the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University. She won SCMLA Best Book awards for both the Medieval Mythography series and The Literary Subversions of Medieval Women.

Lisa Reid (born Melbourne 1975) is an Australian artist, known primarily for her highly detailed figurative works in a variety of mediums. Reid has worked from her Northcote-based studio at Arts Project Australia since 2000, where she held her first solo show in 2015. She has exhibited widely, both nationally and internationally and her work was recently selected for the landmark exhibition Painting. More Painting, at the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, Melbourne. Her work is held in the collection of the National Gallery of Australia.  Early life and education  In an autobiographical digital animation entitled My Story, Reid presents her childhood as one marked by bullying in mainstream education and complains that her forays into \\"special education\\" were also unsatisfactory, with educators making no effort to teach her literacy. Following her graduation from a transitional TAFE course, she describes her experience working in a factory setting as \\"slave labour.\\" More positive experiences are present in Reid's autobiographical opus ‚Äì chiefly her talent for swimming (she has been a competitor and finalist in the Special Olympics since the age of fifteen) and art. Since 2000 she has been working at the studio at Arts Project Australia (APA), an organisation devoted to supporting and promoting artists with an intellectual disability. Although no formal fine art training is provided at APA, her participation in the studio program there has provided her with access to fine art materials and the informal tuition provided by the practicing artists employed by the organisation. During the formative early years of residency at the studio, her paintings and drawings presented muted, monochromatic, anonymous figures, sourced from magazines and newspapers. In 2002 a family photograph album became a pivotal source in developing Reid's work, providing her with the source material for a personal narrative as her subject matter. During this time she also attended a life drawing class at RMIT University and began to develop her meticulous signature style.  Career, themes and style  Reid's work has remained primarily figurative throughout her career, and has become recognisable by the \\"highly detailed\\" and \\"intricate\\" style of art-making she has adopted across a range of mediums including painting, printmaking, ceramics and digital media, with subject matter sourced from personal photographs, life drawing and images from popular culture. Due to the meticulous \\"small stroke\\" technique which she employs in her practice, individual works will sometimes take her several months or even years to complete, and her method is to work on several projects simultaneously. Reid's objective in adopting this laborious process, is to reproduce her source imagery as realistically as possible, in the manner of photorealist artists. The mode in which Reid transfers her signature small stroke technique directly from traditional to digital media, has prompted Melbourne writer and art critic Dylan Rainforth to draw a parallel between the work of Reid and that of the Australian artist Richard Lewer, who he claims employs a similar process in his digital practice. Both artists, he states, employ this technique to \\"reinforce the pathos\\" of their narrative works. The flattening of pictorial space in Reid's painting has also led Rainforth to compare her work and to that of early Modernists such as Paul C√©zanne and Georges Braque. Reid's work is known for appropriating the imagery and icons of popular culture, particular Australian culture, which led to Reid's inclusion in a merchandise collaboration between National Gallery of Victoria, Arts Project Australia and Third Drawer Down. Reid has been identified as one of Australia's key artists within the Outsider Art category, as can be evidenced by her inclusion in major Outsider Art exhibitions and fairs in Australia and the USA.

Plot Tokyo Ghoul is set in an alternate reality where ghouls, individuals who can only survive by eating human flesh, live among the normal humans in secret, hiding their true nature to evade pursuit from the authorities. Ken Kaneki, a normal college student who, after being taken to a hospital, discovers that he underwent a surgery that transformed him into a half-ghoul after being attacked by his date, Rize Kamishiro who reveals herself to be a ghoul. This was accomplished by transferring Rize's organs into his body, and now, like normal ghouls, he must consume human flesh to survive. Struggling with his new life as a half-ghoul, he must now adapt into the ghoul society, as well as keeping his identity hidden from his human companions.

Early life and education  Letourneau was born in Fredericton, New Brunswick. She graduated from the Fredericton High School in 1987 and went on complete her baccalaureate degree in Nursing from the University of New Brunswick in 1991, after which she successfully completed the requirements to be a Registered Nurse. After she became a Registered Nurse, she was employed in the surgery ward at the Dr. Everett Chalmers Regional Hospital as well as the Women and Children's unit at the Oromocto Public Hospital. In 1992, she moved to Alberta and enrolled in the University of Alberta, where she received a fellowship from the National Health Research and Development Program. She completed her master's degree in 1994 and subsequently started her PhD in Nursing from University of Alberta. Alongside her PhD, she served as a registered nurse at various hospitals including the University of Alberta Hospital working in pediatric surgery and intensive care, as well in pediatric homecare of Alberta Health Services.  Career  After the completion of her PhD in 1998, she left her work as a nurse and became an assistant professor at the University of Alberta, where she had been working as a research assistant and researcher on various projects. Letourneau received post-doctoral fellowships from Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research (AHFMR) and CIHR for her research on support interventions for high-risk families affected by teenage motherhood, depression and other stressors. In early 2003, Letourneau created the Child Health Intervention and Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Studies Program at the University of Alberta. In September, she moved back to her hometown of New Brunswick joining the University of New Brunswick as associate professor. Simultaneously, she became a research fellow at the Canadian Research Institute for Social Policy (CRISP) at the University of New Brunswick. During this time she became an adjunct professor at the University of Alberta to focus on her work at CHILD. Her research focus began changing from early childhood development to postpartum depression. In 2004, CIHR gave her a grant to conduct research on supporting families affected by postpartum depression. In July 2007, Letourneau received tenure as a professor at the University of New Brunswick. In 2011, she left CRISP as well as University of New Brunswick and joined the Faculty of Nursing at University of Calgary. Simultaneously, she became a scientist at the Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute. She received the Norlien/Alberta Children's Hospital Foundation Chair with a grant of $900,000 to conduct research on Parent-Infant mental health issues with the option to renew the grant after it ended in 2016. She has been renewed. This role has allowed her to focus most of her time on research. After focusing on research in the Faculty of Nursing for a year, Letourneau joined to the Faculty of Medicine attaining appointments in Pediatrics and Psychiatry. In 2012, she was appointed as a director of RESOLVE Alberta (Research and Education to Solutions to Violence and Abuse) at the University of Calgary and in 2015, she served as an interim director at the Owerko Centre for Neurodevelopment and Child Mental Health. As of 2016, Letourneau serves as the Professor of Nursing and Cumming School of Medicine at the University of Calgary and the director of RESOLVE Alberta. She is also the principal investigator of CHILD and the ACHF Chair in Parent-Infant Mental Health. She is a member of many international societies, including a founding board member of the International Association for the Study of Attachment, member of the Society for Emotional and Attachment Studies, World Association for Infant Mental Health and Post-partum Support International. She has a history of provincial and national governance, serving on the board of the New Brunswick Foundation for Health Research (2010‚Äì13), National Collaborating Centre on the Determinants of Health (2007‚Äì2011), CIHR Governing Council (2007‚Äì2014), including chair of the Standing Committee on Ethics and member of nominating and governance committee, and institute advisory board of the CIHR Institute of Gender and Health (2005‚Äì2007) and finally Assisted Human Reproduction Canada (2008‚Äì12). She is also secretary of the board of Discovery House Family Violence Prevention Society (2017-), past president of the Alberta Association for Infant Mental Health (2017-19) and incoming president of the College and Association of Registered Nurses of Alberta (2020-2022). Research and writing Letourneau's research work has been focused on parenting and child development. Initially her research was completely focus on psychological development in early childhood. However, a major part of her research has been focused on how postpartum depression affects parenting and child development. Her writings also deal with child rearing amidst complex social issues such as family violence and teen motherhood. Letourneau is one of the first nurse researchers to study the origins of fetal programming of infant stress reactivity and alterations in brain structure caused due to pre-natal depression. Her latest work focuses on how parent-child relationships affect health outcomes such as allergic disease and interact with genotype in predicting neurological outcomes. Building on her completed PhD, she attained her first grant as Co-Principal Investigator from AHFMR on a program to that was found to successfully promote maternal-child relationships between teenage mothers and their infants.Letourneau, N. (2001). Attrition among adolescents involved in a parenting program. Child: Care, Health & Development, 27, 183-186. Her first national funding was from the CIHR Institute of Neuroscience, Mental Health and Addiction on supports and services for mothers affected by postpartum depression. Her research highlighted women's needs and led to policy recommendations for reforms and improved services across Canada and culminated in a conference that attracted researchers, service providers, and policy makers. Thus began a history of attaining regular, substantial funding for projects with national impact.Letourneau, N., Dennis, C., Benzies, K., Duffett-Leger, L., Stewart, M., Tryphonopoulos*, P., ... & Watson, W. (2012). Post-partum depression is a family affair: Addressing the impact on mothers, fathers and children. Issues in Mental Health Nursing, 33, 445-457. Most recently, she developed and tested MOMS (Mothers Offering Mentorship and Support) Link along with Dr. Cindy-Lee Dennis of the University of Toronto and in partnership with the Province of New Brunswick. Not only was this published, but it has been licensed for delivery by Sykes Telecare.Letourneau, N., Duffett-Leger, L., Stewart, M., Dennis, C. L., Secco, L., Colpitts, J. (2016). Development of a telephone-based peer support program for new mothers with postpartum depression. Current Women's Health Reviews, 12(1), 48-57. She is also the principal investigator of the APrON (Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition) study. APrON is a longitudinal cohort of ~2200 mothers, fathers and their children, focused on mothers' and children's mental and physical health and nutrition. APrON was established through $5 million funding from Alberta Innovates (formerly AHFMR). To date, 80+ peer-reviewed publications and hundreds of presentations have been derived from these data. For APrON, funding has been obtained to follow the sample until children are 12 years old ($1.9 million from ACHF). For a subsample (n=225/2200), called the Fetal Programming Cohort, Letourneau is Co-Principal Investigator and co-founder and has helped attain additional funding for more in-depth data collection on parental caregiving quality (videotaped lab visits at 6, 18 and 48 months of age), infant HPA-axis function (lab visits at 3, 6 and 18 months of age), epigenetics and genetics (blood and buccal collection at 3 months of age) via funding from CIHR, PolicyWise, ACHF, NCE AllerGen, KidsBrainHealth/NCE Neurodevnet and an anonymous donor totaling nearly $1 million. In 2012, Letourneau began research on developing MOMS Link along with Dr. Cindy-Lee Dennis of the University of Toronto, a program she envisioned would help mothers suffering from postpartum depression. Subsequently, she launched a pilot program in New Brunswick. As part of the program, new mothers were signed up for a weekly one-on-one phone call with a woman who had experienced postpartum depression. In 2016, she began working on bringing the program to national audiences through partnership with Sykes. She has built on this success, with the VID-KIDS (Video-feedback interaction guidance for mothers with depression and their infants) study funded by CIHR (~$600,000), focused on supporting depressed mothers‚Äô parent-infant relationship quality to promote infant mental health. With post-doctoral fellow Martha Hart, she also developed and tested the ATTACH‚Ñ¢ (Attachment and Child Health) program, which was selected as a Frontiers of Innovation program by the Harvard Center on the Developing Child for its promise in addressing toxic stress impacts on children‚Äôs mental health. It received a CIHR-SPOR grant to scale and spread ATTACH‚Ñ¢ across Canada. Letourneau and Hart launched the online training program for health care professionals to receive instruction in ATTACH‚Ñ¢ in 2019. Letourneau has written over 180 peer-reviewed publications; authored the books, What Kind of Parent Am I?: Self-Surveys That Reveal the Impact of Toxic Stress and More, Scientific Parenting: What Science reveals about Parental Impact, and Parenting and Child Development: Issues and Answers, has contributed to more than 20 books on parenting and childcare.  Personal life  She is married to Dean Mullin and has two sons.

Photo source: San Diego Air & Space Museum Archives Henry Cord Meyer (1912 - 2001) was an American historian specializing in modern European and Central European history. He was an expert on the politics and economics of airships in the post World War I period (1920-1938). Biography The only child of German immigrants Henry H. and Sophie (n√©e Abhmann) Meyer, Henry Cord Meyer was born on 12 February 1913 in Chicago, Illinois. After his father died in 1920, Meyer and his mother moved first to Eldora, Colorado; Meyer grew up in Colorado Springs. Meyer earned his B.A. degree at the University of Colorado in 1935; he spent one year as a student at the Konsular Academy in Vienna (1935-1936) before continuing his studies in the United States, receiving his master's degree at the University of Iowa (1937), and his PhD from Yale University in 1941. Career Meyer was commissioned as an ensign in the Navy at the start of World War II and was recruited by William Donovan to serve as a commissioned officer in the Office of Strategic Services, joining other historians performing intelligence work. As one of the planners for the 1943 Operation Torch invasion of Northern Africa, Meyer researched port capacities and possible landing sites. He returned to academia after the war, joining the history faculty of Pomona College as a specialist in Central European history. While at Pomona, he received the 1956 George Louis Beer Prize (American Historical Association) for his 1955 book, Mitteleuropa in German Thought and Action, 1815-1945. He was a 1960 Guggenheim Fellow, studying German and East European History. Leaving Pomona in 1964, Meyer was a founding member of the History Department at UC Irvine (retired, 1981; emeritus to 1999). Late in his career, Meyer became an authority on the political and economic history of dirigibles, studying rigid airship travel from its early development by the Sch√ºtte-Lanz and Luftschiffbau Zeppelin companies; he also researched the history of the U.S. Navy's airships, including the USS Shenandoah, the USS Akron and the USS Macon, and studied the British Air Ministry's dirigible program, including the R100 and R101 airships. He conducted an extensive correspondence with figures involved with airship travel and mail service and interviewed survivors of the Hindenburg disaster. In 1974 Meyer contacted director Robert Wise regarding the production plans of the film The Hindenburg and was granted access to the production during filming. Interviewed in 1976, Meyer said that the film‚Äôs dramatic narrative ‚Äì that anti-Nazi sabotage of the Hindenburg was the cause of the disaster ‚Äì was not historically accurate. He argued that in 1937 there was no organized anti-Nazi resistance in Germany. Meyer was a prolific scholar, publishing many articles and book reviews in his career; he was the author of seven books. His research interests included German history since 1815, European history since 1848, 19th and 20th century European diplomatic history, and German-Slav relations in the 19th and 20th centuries. His later research included work on the emotional and psychological aspects of slogans (see Drang nach Osten) and images as they relate to perceptions about national identities; he also investigated the phenomena of political manipulation of technology. In his last work, Airships in International Affairs 1890-1940, Meyer collaborated with airship expert John Duggan. Considered by many an expert on the propaganda use of the airship, Meyer was not averse to sharing his knowledge and expertise with other airship scholars. At his death, Meyer was planning a book on airship political documents and working on his memoirs. Meyer died on September 30, 2001 in Claremont, California. In 2002, Meyer's extensive airship research papers and photograph collection were donated to the San Diego Air & Space Museum Archives. References Selected bibliography * Duggan, J., & Meyer, H.

Born in Ireland,Bernard Cook, \\"Hales, John\\", in: Hales came to prominence as the leader of the small Elastic Web Weavers of London union. He championed the right of women to join the union, something so opposed by a minority that they falsely accused him of embezzlement. He was suspended while an investigation took place, but was cleared.Timothy Messer-Kruse, The Yankee International: Marxism and the American Reform Tradition, 1848-1876, p.57 In 1866, he became an early member of the International Workingmen's Association's (IWMA) General Council, and he persuaded his union to affiliate to the association later the same year.Henry Collins and Chimen Abramsky, Karl Marx and the British Labour Movement, pp.73, 85 Also interested in land reform, he proposed that it work with supporters of Bronterre O'Brien to create a Labour League to act as the British section of the international. Karl Marx spoke against the proposal, and instead a separate organisation was established, named the \\"Land and Labour League\\" on Hales' proposal.E. Eldon Barry, Nationalization in British Politics: The Historical Background, p.50 He was also active in the peace movement, as a founder member of the British section of the International League of Peace and Liberty.Paul Laity, The British Peace Movement 1870-1914, p.32 In 1871, Hales became general secretary of the IWMA, and from early 1872 also acted as its United States corresponding secretary.Marcello Musto, Workers Unite!: The International 150 Years Later He lost these positions in the summer of 1872, when the headquarters of the organisation were moved to New York City, against his opposition. In November, he led a split in the British Federation of the IWMA, disassociating it from the American leadership and from Marx. With the support of Johann Eccarius, Hermann Jung and Thomas Mottershead, he called a congress of the Federation with the intention of turning it into a political party with trade union backing. They signed up to the new St Imer International, despite having little in common with its anarchist leadership, and the organisation soon ceased to have any importance. During the early 1870s, Hales was a member of the Tower Hamlets Radical Electoral Committee, and rallied its members in support of Frederick Maxse's unsuccessful candidacy at the 1874 UK general election.Margot C.

Following a postdoctoral position at University of Minnesota and as an NIH Postdoctoral Fellow at Washington University in St. Louis, he joined the faculty at Texas A&M; in 1999, where he was promoted to the rank of Associate Professor with tenure. In 2005, he moved to The University of Texas at Austin and became a Full Professor in 2008 in the Departments of Molecular Biosciences and Integrative Biology, Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, and Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology. Dr. Chen is known for his pioneering work on defining genomic and epigenetic changes in plant hybrids and polyploids with an emphasis on associating gene expression variation with phenotypic traits using Arabidopsis, cotton, and corn as experimental systems. He and his colleagues have discovered that epigenetic mechanisms drive genome-wide nonadditive expression of the genes in different regulatory pathways, including circadian clock genes that promote growth vigor, transcription factor genes that control fiber cell development, and genes and small RNAs that mediate seed size. Chen has led an international effort to sequence the tetraploid genome of Upland cotton that accounts for 90% of the cotton produced worldwide, providing a unique resource for cotton improvement using breeding and biotechnology. His research findings have significant implications, not only for advancing the field of genetics and epigenetics, but also for successful applications of biotechnology to safely and effectively manipulate gene expression associated with growth vigor in plants and crops that produce food, feed, and biomaterials.

He was exiled for offending the grand councilor Kong Guang (), and later died in prison for opposing Wang Mang (who usurped the throne in 9 AD). Bao Xuan's (already raided) tomb was discovered in May 2007 in Zhangzi County, Shanxi, where he spent the last years of his life. Early life Bao Xuan was from a poor family in Gaocheng (È´òÂüé; roughly modern Yanshan County, Hebei). He studied Confucian classics under a wealthy scholar, who, recognizing Bao Xuan's outstanding diligence, betrothed his daughter Huan Shaojun () to Bao Xuan. Mr. Huan also provided a sumptuous dowry, but this made Bao Xuan uncomfortable. He said to his new bride: Huan Shaojun replied: Bao Xuan was ecstatic. The young couple returned the garments, jewelry and servants to Huan Shaojun's father, and dressed in coarse clothing they pushed together a wheelbarrow with all their belongings back to Bao Xuan's village. Despite her aristocratic background, Huan Shaojun performed domestic chores and respected her in-laws with such modesty that the entire community praised her as an excellent wife. Bao Xuan began his career as a lowly functionary in the local government. Later he went to neighboring Shuzhou (ÊùüÂ∑û; roughly modern Dacheng County) and served as an aide () and a defender (), before working in the labor section (). He became a civil official after a recommendation through the xiaolian system, but an illness prevented him from assuming a post. Once he recovered, he worked as a retainer () still in Shuzhou. He became a Court Gentleman for Consultation () in the imperial court through the recommendation of Wang Shang (), the Commander-in-Chief (), but left the post after another illness. As a censor In 7 BC, Liu Xin (posthumously known as Emperor Ai) became the Han emperor. He Wu (), the Censor-in-Chief (), valued Bao Xuan greatly and recommended him to the post of Grand Master of Remonstrance (). A year later Bao Xuan was dismissed after Guo Qin (), the Director of Uprightness (), accused him of misconduct and overstepping his boundaries during inspection tours. The charges were: *Bao Xuan heard court cases in place of local officials *Bao Xuan inspected too many items *Bao Xuan rode in a cart led by only 1 horse as opposed to 6 horses, the standard *Bao Xuan lodged in village hostels which drew gossip None of the offenses was major, and Bao Xuan returned to the post a few months later. He was known to submit many memorials criticizing policies, \\"his writings bereft of rhetoric and abounding with facts\\". By 3 BC the emperor's grandmother Consort Fu and mother Consort Ding were both made empresses dowager, and several members of the Fu and Ding clans were created marquesses. Those opposing them were removed from their offices one by one, including He Wu. But Bao Xuan was undaunted. He submitted a memorial to the throne which would later be referred to as the \\"Seven Deprivations and Seven Deaths\\" (), in which he detailed the suffering of the common people at the hands of cruel landlords and oppressive government. In blunt language, Bao Xuan criticized the emperor for favoring the Fu and Ding clans and the minion Dong Xian, while ignoring the wealth they accumulated at the expense of common people. It was said the emperor was rather displeased but did not punish Bao Xuan as he was a \\"famous Confucian\\". Nor did he heed Bao Xuan's advice immediately. An earthquake and a solar eclipse in 2 BC worked in Bao Xuan's favor. The emperor became fearful and dismissed many imperial relatives after Empress Dowager Fu died. Bao Xuan submitted another memorial criticizing Dong Xian and other sycophants in power, and this time the emperor took his advice and reinstalled He Wu and Peng Xuan () to their old posts as two of the Three Ducal Ministers. Bao Xuan was appointed Director of Convict Labor (). Exile and death A few months later, the grand councilor Kong Guang () was on a tour in a national park when his retainers rode in the middle of the road, which was a crime at that time. Bao Xuan happened to witness it, so he ordered his followers to detain Kong Guang's retainers and confiscate their carts and horses. The furious Kong Guang sent a report to the Censorate (), which dispatched officials to the Directorate of Convict Labor to try to apprehend Bao Xuan. Bao Xuan shut the gate so the officials could not enter. This infuriated the emperor, who ordered Bao Xuan arrested and executed for \\"gross disrespect and immorality\\". After Bao Xuan's arrest, a student in the imperial college named Wang Xian () wrote a banner that said: \\"Those who want to save Director Bao, stand under this banner!\\" Soon more than a few thousands students gathered. On the day of the next imperial session, the students blocked Kong Guang's cart and delivered a petition to the palace. The emperor then reduced Bao Xuan's sentence from death penalty to exile, with Bao Xuan's head shaved and an iron hoop placed around his neck. Bao Xuan was exiled to Shangdang (‰∏äÈª®; roughly modern Zhangzi County) where he noticed fertile land and few bandits, a great place for agriculture. His family soon joined him in Shangdang. The emperor Liu Xin's death in 1 BC resulted in the throne being passed to 8-year-old Liu Jizi (posthumously known as Emperor Ping), while power fell to the ruthless and ambitious regent Wang Mang. Wang Mang took drastic actions to consolidate power, including killing and exiling his political opponents (He Wu was one of them) on false charges. Still in exile, Bao Xuan and 5 other notable people vowed to never serve Wang Mang. News of their vow spread as they became targets of Wang Mang's wrath. Once, Bao Xuan's son-in-law Xu Gan () brought a friend Xin Xing () to visit Bao Xuan, and they had a meal together. Soon Bao Xuan was arrested and charged with abetting a criminal, as Xin Xing was allegedly a fugitive. Bao Xuan committed suicide in prison, but it's unknown whether it's by his own volition or being forced to. Wang Mang overthrew the Han dynasty in 9 AD, and Bao Xuan's son Bao Yong () joined the army to overthrow him in 17 AD. After the Han dynasty was restored, Bao Yong received important government posts.

The Act of Congress grants the Secretary of War authority to evaluate the oil volume discharge from a vessel while assessing if coastal navigable waters have a potential toxicity posing a deleterious condition for human health and seafood contamination. The 1924 United States statute provides judicial penalties encompassing civil and criminal punishment for violations of the prescribed regulations as stated in the Act. The legislation was passed by the 68th United States Congressional session and confirmed as a federal law by the 29th President of the United States Warren G. Harding on June 7, 1924.

P. Nagarajan for CNV Productions. The film features an ensemble cast including Master Prabhakar, Baby Sumathi, Sirkazhi Govindarajan, V. S. Raghavan, K. D. Santhanam and Suruli Rajan. It was released on 6 December 1969 and became a commercial success. The film was remade in Telugu as Balaraju Katha (1970).  Plot  Raja is a 10-year-old tourist guide in Mahabalipuram. An elder sculptor has a small rock sculpture tablet on which are engraved adages. Raja enters a discussion with him, wondering if those pearls of wisdom still hold relevance. The sculptor tells him that those sayings are eternal and immortal. Unconvinced, Raja sets out to find the truth for himself. Ultimately, he realises that all those sayings are still valid.  Cast  * Master Prabhakar as Raja * Baby Sumathi as Raja's sister *Sirkazhi Govindarajan as a police officer disguised as a sage *V. S. Raghavan *K. D. Santhanam as the elder sculptor *Suruli Rajan as a friendly police officer  Production  In addition to writing and directing, A. P. Nagarajan also produced Vaa Raja Vaa under his company CNV Productions. W. R. Subba Rao was the cinematographer, while T. R. Nagarajan was the editor. Since it was previously believed in the Tamil film industry that A. P. Nagarajan's films were successful only because of their star cast and \\"mammoth\\" scales, rather than his directorial skills, he directed this film, which featured mostly newcomers, to silence his critics. It was also one of his rare films to have a contemporary setting, since he was then known primarily for directing films based on Hindu mythology. The film was shot entirely on location in Mahabalipuram.  Soundtrack  The music of the film was composed by Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan, marking his cinematic debut. The lyrics were written by Arulmani, Poovai Senguttuvan, Ulundurpettai Shanmugham and Azha Valliappa. The playback singers were L. R. Eswari, Sirkazhi Govindarajan, Anjali, V. Sarala, M. R. Vijaya and R. Jayalakshmi.  Release and reception  Vaa Raja Vaa was released on 6 December 1969. The film was a commercial success, running for over 100 days in theatres. In a review dated 21 December 1969, the Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan praised the performances of the cast. The film was remade in Telugu as Balaraju Katha (1970), with Prabhakar reprising his role.

Sinclair wrote to Arbella that Christian hoped she might defend his honour.Sara Jayne Steen, Letters of Arbella Suart (Oxford, 1994), pp. 211-2, 282-4. Christian IV aggressive policy towards Sweden was met with reluctance and skepticism in Sk√•ne, since the province would be the first to feel the impact of war in case of hostilities. The King needed faithful supporters in the province, and hence Sinclair was made colonel of the Scanian Regiment in 1615, and became recipient of a number of land donations. The following year he was made one of a very limited number of knights of the Order of the Armed Arm. In 1617 Sinclair became a member of the privy council of the Danish realm; the King needed loyal followers in that august body, as its resistance towards his foreign policy was mounting. He was the King's confidential adviser in matters concerning Great Britain, utilizing his many friends and connections to Danish advantage, especially James VI, with whom he was in great favour. Sinclair was the Danish King's envoy in Britain a number of times between 1606 and 1621, managing to influence James VI into adopting a more pro-Danish, and less pro- Swedish, stance.

The film features Sunny Deol, Bobby Deol, Shreyas Talpade himself in lead roles along with Sonali Kulkarni and Samiksha Bhatnagar. The film is an official remake of the Marathi film Poshter Boyz which Shreyas had produced and acted in. It is inspired by a real-life incident about three porters who found their pictures on a vasectomy poster. Produced by Sony Pictures Networks Productions, Sunny Sounds Pvt. Ltd. and Affluence Movie Pvt. Ltd., Poster Boys is released on 8 September 2017.  Plot  Three men meet their bad luck for an unknown reason. Arjun Singh (Shreyas Talpade) proposes to his girlfriend Riya but is rejected by her father for \\"he can't get his daughter married to such a person\\", leaving Arjun frustrated and upset. Jaagavar Chaudhary (Sunny Deol) is preparing his younger sister Anjali's engagement ceremony when he's told that the fiance and his family changes their mind of engaging with Anjali for \\"they cannot accept the alliance with such a shameful family\\". Vinay Sharma (Bobby Deol) is a primary teacher whose wife Suraj (Samiksha Bhatnagar) suddenly leaves him and asks for divorce for she cannot forgive his \\"irresponsible deeds\\". The three confused and upset men one day coincidentally meet somewhere that has a poster of their photos of promoting vasectomy. They come to know that this poster is the reason they are defamed as none of them had that operation and their photos were used without their permission. They decide to find out who is behind it and solve it. They later find that two government employees from the Health Department, the organizer of that promotion, are responsible for the incident. They find the two employees and ask them to remove all the posters in the city with their unauthorized photos and make a public apology and demand compensation. The two agree but request time to do that. During the given days, the two don't try to fulfill their promise, but instead ask their senior to help, and their senior, the Health Minister (Murali Sharma) does not try to solve it but to cover it up. At the deadline date, the three can't find the two government employees to fulfill their promise so they turn to their superior for help, who refuses to meet them. The three desperate men then decide to sue the Health Department. They fail the case because the Health Department use a lot of fake evidence including faked documents showing that they willingly finished the operation and asked to post their photos. But the incident goes viral with help of a local reporter (Raashul Tandon) and they are gaining people's support. During a press conference suggested by the same reporter, angered Arjun announces that they will protest naked if the authority don't give them justice, drawing attention of greater public to this incident. They start their naked protest at the promised day with only underpants, and people supporting them also uploaded videos of them naked supporting the three's request. The incident finally reaches the Chief Minister, who rushes to the scene to control the situation. The Chief Minister, knowing all the truth behind it, announces that the three are innocent and the Health Department is responsible for the incident and the government will give them compensation. Riya's father, convinced of Arjun's innocence and moved by his courage, agrees his proposal; Anjali's fiance agrees too the propose of their family; Vinay's wife returns to him too.

National army In 1614, the King and Council decided to create a permanent national army, to augment the war-time mercenary army. Four thousand soldiers would be raised from the peasantry; 2,000 in Jutland, 200 in Funen, 200 in Zealand, and 1,600 in Sk√•ne, Halland, and Blekinge. At first the basis for recruitment was crown land; the tenant of a crown farmstead had either to be a soldier himself, or keep a suitable man, against freedom from taxation. In 1620, all land - most land in Denmark was owned by the nobility - was required to hold soldiers; nine farmsteads keeping one soldier, who had to serve for three years; the soldiers only serving under the colours in time of war; the weaponry kept at armouries by the churches. Two grand regiments of foot were created; the Jutland, and the Sk√•ne: the soldiers from Funen going to the former, those from Zealand, to the latter. Captains and lieutenants where selected from half-pay officers of the Kalmar War; ensigns and sergeants from well to do tenants. In 1633 the number of regiments were raised to three; in addition to the two oldest, a Zealand regiment was also created, the predecessor of today's Sj√¶llandske Livregiment.Vaupell 1872, vol. 1, p. 11-13. The Regiment The Scanian regiment was mustered into service, December 20, 1615, with Andrew Sinclair as colonel. At first the regiment contained 1,792 soldiers, with one company from Zealand, four from Sk√•ne, three from Halland, and one from Blekinge. When the Zealand regiment was created it lost one company, and when Halland was ceded to Sweden through the peace of Br√∂msebro 1645, another three. The regiment was mobilized 1627-1639, during the Thirty Year's War, when Imperial forces attacked Denmark. When Frederick III decided to attack Sweden in 1657, the Sk√•ne regiment had, as all national regiments, untrained soldiers and officers not used to command. After the disastrous war, Sk√•ne and Blekinge were ceded to Sweden, and the regiment disbanded.Vaupell 1872, p. 13, 22. \\"Arm√©n i Sk√•ne, Halland och Blekinge genom tiderna.\\" Landsarkivet i K√∏benhavn.

Its main purpose is to protect the nation's oil assets and prevent piracy in the Gulf of Guinea. The Russian and American navies have joint exercises with the Equatoguinean navy, besides the Obangame Express exercise in the Gulf of Guinea with 10 other nations. The navy is also used to patrol the Corisco bay islands which are claimed by both Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. The Navy partially built a 107-m long frigate in the dry dock in Malabo. The frigate was commissioned on June 3, 2014 by president Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo and named after the Wele-Nzas Province. The ship was designed in Mykolaiv, Ukraine and built at Varna, Bulgaria. The outfitting was done at Malabo. The Wele-Nzas was designated as the flagship of the Navy. The United States donated a 68 foot patrol boat, the Isla de Bioko (no longer operational) to the navy in 1988 to patrol its Exclusive Economic Zone.

He is married to Indira Mainali and has five children, Lata Kaini, Laya Mainali, Meena Upreti, Rachana Rimal and Reecha Rijal. Education and early career Born in 1934 to Ram Prasad Mainali and Indra Maya Mainali at Walting, Kavre, Thakur Prasad Mainali went to India to study sculpture. He studied sculpture under Sankho Chaudhuri, a noted Indian artist, at the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda. After graduating in Fine Arts, he returned to Kathmandu in 1963 and helped found Nepal Association of Fine Arts (NAFA) in 1965 with Crown Prince Birendra Bir Bikram Shah as its Chairman. He served as NAFA‚Äôs secretary from 1965 to 1967 and again from 1970 to 1977. In 2010 when Nepal became a new republic, Nepal Association of Fine Arts became Nepal Academy of Fine Arts. Under new management, Mainali served as Vice-Chancellor of the newly formed organization from 2010 to 2014.  Career as a sculptor  Mainali is known for his contemporary style in arts and sculpture. Nepalese sculptor Bhuwan Thapa has named him as \\"the Father of the modern sculpture of Nepal\\". The valley of Kathmandu is dotted with sculptures of many kinds‚Äîreligious and secular. There are statues of gods and Nepal‚Äôs past kings scattered in the cities of Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur; however, no work of a monumental scale with a contemporary theme was found in a public space before Mainali. He is the first individual from Nepal to go to a university in India to earn a degree in sculpture, and then return to his country to engage his whole life producing sculptures using modern techniques and themes. In 1965, Mainali was appointed to make a sculpture in Bhrikuti Mandap, a public park‚Äîthe first contemporary piece of its kind on a monumental scale. It‚Äôs a 35-foot-tall artistic monument made of cement and concrete. After his initial monumental work at Bhrikuti Mandap, he went on to make other large-scale public pieces. In between his monumental works he also made many bronze pieces of a smaller scale, which have been acquired by collectors around the world. As a sculptor, he has exhibited his works at various art shows in Nepal and abroad. Mainali has been honored by various art organizations and the government of Nepal for his service to art community and cited by art historians, art critics, and his fellow artists as a pioneer of Nepali modern art.

It is one of the components of a multiprotein complex required for exocytosis. The 5' portion of this gene and two neighboring cytochrome p450 genes are included in a deletion that results in an autosomal dominant form of nonsyndromic optic nerve aplasia (ONA).

It was proclaimed on 2 August 1883, when the area was separated from the District Council of Stepney due to differing interests between the rapidly-growing St Peters area, which contained five-eighths of the Stepney council's ratepayers, and slower-growing suburbs further east. It was divided into four wards (Hackney, East Adelaide, Stepney and Maylands), each represented by two councillors, alongside a directly elected mayor. The council initially met at the Bucks Head Hotel (later the Avenues Hotel), but rapidly sought a town hall due to a lack of office accommodation, and St Peters Town Hall was built in 1885 at a cost of approximately ¬£3,000, formally opening on 8 March 1886. The council undertook an important local role in social welfare during the Great Depression, and from the 1960s had to deal with planning issues surrounding the Playford government's Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study, the Dunstan government's Hackney Redevelopment Scheme, and in the late 1970s and 1980s, the Adelaide O-Bahn, the latter which met local opposition over noise and its impact on the Torrens Gorge. It also developed zoning regulations protecting the character of the local area as a \\"low and medium density house-and-garden town\\". In later years, the council also built a new library, incorporating the former post office building, and the St Peters River Park by the River Torrens. In 1981, the council was responsible for an area of 3.7 square kilometres, with a population of 8,458, down from a peak of 12,522 in 1947. The Town of St Peters ceased to exist on 1 November 1997, when it amalgamated with the City of Kensington and Norwood and the City of Payneham to form the City of Norwood Payneham & St Peters.

Dr. Charles Robert Hager (October 27, 1851 - July 13, 1917) was a Swiss- born American missionary sent to Hong Kong and China by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) to start the Hong Kong Mission (later renamed as South China Mission) in 1883. He was best known as the baptizer of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the first president and founding father of the Republic of China. Rev. Hager was the founder, and was regarded as the first Minister-in-charge, of the China Congregational Church in Hong Kong. Picture of the baptism record of Dr. Sun Yat-sen taken in the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Museum, Hong Kong. The picture-in-picture shows a copy of the very original record in Hager's handwriting. Early life Charles Robert Hager was born in N√§nikon, Switzerland, October 27, 1851, to a farmer Rudolf Hager and his wife Elizabeth. The Hagers moved to America in 1858 and made Honey Creek, Sauk County, Wisconsin their new home. Charles R. Hager was enrolled in the preparatory department of the Oberlin College from 1867-1870, 1872-1874 and in college from 1874-1878. In 1882, he graduated from the Pacific Theological Seminary, Oakland, California and was ordained to the Congregational ministry at San Francisco, California, February 16, 1883.\\".... Rev. C. R. Hager, a recent graduate of our Pacific Theological Seminary, and for more than a year past a very successful and greatly beloved pastor at Antioch, in this State... was ordained as a Missionary at Bethany Church, on Friday, Feb. 16...\\" W. C. Pond, The American Missionary Magazine v.37 1883, p.180-181 Hong Kong Mission Before there were the strict Immigration Laws, thousands of Chinese from the Kwong Tung province found their way, as laborers and as merchants into the United States. Many of these were converted in the Missions opened for the Chinese in the larger cities. An appeal, by these converts, was made to the American Missionary Association, for a minister to their province, Kwong Tung, but in vain. They then turned to the American Board, and finally secured a single man, the Rev. C.R. Hager, in 1883. Hager, immediately after his ordination, traveled on the steamer SS City of Tokio from San Francisco to Hong Kong and was ashore on 31 May 1883. With the help of Wan Tsing-kai, he rented a 3-storey house at 2 Bridges Street, Central and opened the mission including a school there. On 4 May 1884, Sun Yat-sen was baptized to become the second member of the mission church.\\"...At present there are some seven members in the interior belonging to our mission, and two here, one I baptized last Sabbath,a young man who is attending the Government Central School. We had a very pleasant communion service yesterday...\\" - Hager to Clark, 5 May 1884, Hong Kong, #17, Reel 260, ABCFM Papers (microfilm), p.3\\"...We had a pleasant communion yesterday and received one Chinaman into the church...\\" - Hager to Pond, 5 May 1884, Hong Kong, #18, Reel 260, ABCFM Papers (microfilm), p.3 postscript During his first term, 1883-1890, Hager had charge of 7 government schools in Hong Kong, and opened chapels in San Ning City, Miu Pin, Kwong Hoi and Hoi In, all in the San Ning District, which is now called Toishan. On February 1891, owing to a serious illness, Hager was forced to take a long furlough and returned to America via Switzerland. In 1893, he began his study of medicine at Vanderbilt University and Nashville University and obtained his M.D. degree in 1894. South China Mission During Hager's long furlough in the States, the mission was renamed as South China Mission with its center relocated in Canton (Guangzhou). Dr. Hager rejoined the mission after his marriage with Lizzie Winona Blackman in Chicago on June 20, 1894 and the couple traveled back to China in September of the same year. However, after a very brief stay and service in Canton, Mrs. Hager died on the date of March 7, 1895 primarily due to kidney complaint. It was a sad and heavy stroke to Dr. Hager. Within a few months he was back once more in Hong Kong, and working harder than ever, especially with his \\"fine art\\" of country tours. A part of the headstone of Mrs. Lizzie B. Hager had been left behind at the roadside when the cemetery was removed/relocated. It has recently been reunited with its tomb base. On December 31, 1896, Dr. Hager married Maria von Rausch of the Basel Mission, Hong Kong, a lady who had been in mission work five years, and who opened the first kindergarten in South China. They got three children: Robert Morrison Hager, Elsie Hager, and Harold Charles Hager. At the beginning of 1897, a chapel was rented on Staunton Street, Central District of Hong Kong where evening services were held every night. According to Hager, half of the rent was raised by the Chinese believers while the other half was paid by himself so that the mission board (ABCFM) was practically at no expense in reference to this new enterprise. The congregation of the Hong Kong church commenced to increase and in 1898, a lot at the corner of Ladder Street and Bridges Street was bought for nearly $8000 on which was built a 4-story Mission House. On October 12, 1901, the newly erected church was dedicated. During his second term of service, Dr. Hager largely devoted himself to his country work. He was described as an indefatigable worker and endured all sorts of hardships and privations. In his zeal, he went beyond the Sz Yap District, as far as Yeungkong City, 200 miles south-west of Canton, and into San Hing and Tung On, north of the Hoi Ping District, into the \\"regions beyond.\\" His itineraries were generally made on foot and in all kinds of weather, and attended by great hardships. This strenuousness resulted in a complete breakdown in 1910. He hoped that an ocean voyage would restore him and accordingly he left his family in Hong Kong and sailed for San Francisco. The change did not benefit him, so, in a few months, Mrs. Hager and children joined him, making their home in Claremont, California. He was then released from the mission in 1912. Death During his last years, Dr. Hager still labored among the California Chinese, and across the border in Mexico, and frequently sent money to the South China Mission. Dr. Hager died July 13, 1917, at Claremont, California, of cancer of the stomach. He was buried at the Oak Park Cemetery with his second wife, Marie Hager, who died a year later.

Education  Chin earned his bachelor's of science degree in journalism at The Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University with a department major in Economics. He completed his master's degree in public and private management (MPPM/MBA), concentrating in Finance, at the Yale School of Management. He attended Fort Hunt High School in Alexandria, Virginia.  Career  = Early career at Burson-Marsteller = In 1986, Chin began his career at Burson- Marsteller, a global public relations and communications firm, in Washington, D.C. Over two decades, Chin counseled a wide range of global businesses and institutions, including multinational food & beverage, consumer goods & services, energy & infrastructure, finance, and telecom & technology companies, among others in often highly regulated sectors. While at college and prior to joining Burson-Marsteller, Chin had served as a White House summer intern under U.S. President Ronald Reagan, working in the Office of Vice President George H.W. Bush. In 1990-1991, Chin was posted to Tokyo as consultant at Dentsu Burson-Marsteller. After returning to the United States, he served an 11-month stint as Special Assistant to the United States Secretary of Commerce, Barbara H. Franklin. Chin moved to Beijing in 1995, where he was subsequently appointed managing director of Burson-Marsteller's Corporate/Public Affairs practice in China in 1996 as well as head of the firm's Beijing operations. He was based in Hong Kong from 1998-2001, taking over leadership of and overseeing operations of Burson-Marsteller's flagship Asia office. He relocated back to Burson-Marsteller's global headquarters in New York in 2001 after September 11, where he worked in part under founder chairman Harold Burson. In New York, Chin oversaw one of the firm's largest clients, served as managing director, Asia-Pacific, and also helped guide the firm's emerging Corporate Social Responsibility consulting work. From 2006-2007, he also took on the role of Managing Director, Global Business and Client Development. While at Burson-Marsteller, Chin was named by then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell and continued under Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as a member of the Secretary of State's Advisory Committee on Cultural Diplomacy, where he helped originate the Benjamin Franklin Award for Public Diplomacy. He is a co-author of the 2005 report, Cultural Diplomacy: The Linchpin of Public Diplomacy. = Asian Development Bank = In early 2007, Chin was appointed the United States Executive Director, with rank of ambassador, to the Asian Development Bank following his testimony before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee and subsequent action by the full U.S. Senate. He served as U.S. Ambassador to the Asian Development Bank, based in Manila, Philippines, until late 2010. He was confirmed to the post by unanimous consent of the United States Senate, becoming one of the highest- ranking Asian-Americans in government and the fourth ever U.S. ambassador of Chinese heritage. In this capacity, Chin was a senior member of the United States Department of the Treasury international affairs team, serving under both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, during one of the world's most challenging economic times. At the ADB, Chin helped formulate and communicate U.S. policies and positions on a wide range of projects, including major energy and transportation infrastructure investments, and financial services and education sector reform programs. He also served on the ADB's audit and pension committees, responsible for supervising financial statements, approving its administrative budget, and reviewing and approving all policy documents as well as some US$10 billion per annum in loan, equity and technical assistance operations. Chin advocated for human resources, risk management and governance reforms. He played a key role in pushing for improved external and internal communications, and the adoption of a whistleblower policy. During his service, he sought to ensure a dialogue on and commitment to sustainable development that is focused on ‚Äúpeople, planet and partnership‚Äù, particularly in Asia's least-developed nations. This has included seeking to ensure the ADB's commitment to strong environmental safeguards, anti-corruption efforts and diversity in its own workforce, as well as the adoption of best practices in technology, communications and management. While at the ADB, Chin's focus on the most vulnerable and on greater development cooperation and effectiveness helped drive his role in the ADB's establishing the first major partnership agreement between the ADB and UNICEF. His experience at the ADB also led Chin to create the acronym ‚Äúthe little BRIC‚Äù, referring to Bureaucracy, Regulation, Interventionism and Corruption. Chin argues that the little BRIC continues as one of the biggest constraints to economic growth and poses a real threat to institutions and commercial progress across all industry sectors. In September 2010, prior to stepping down as the US Ambassador to the Asian Development Bank, Chin testified again before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, arguing for continued robust U.S. engagement in the Asia-Pacific region and for continued reform at the multilateral development banks. = Post-Asian Development Bank = Following his service at the ADB, Chin was appointed to the Board of Trustees of Community & Family Services International (CFSI), an international humanitarian organization based in Manila, Philippines. He provided oversight as a trustee of CFSI, until shifting in 2015 to a similar role with the U.S.-based, non-profit organization Friends of CFSI, and continues to advocate for the weakest and most vulnerable in the Philippines and abroad. From 2012-2014, Chin was based at the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) in Bangkok, Thailand, as a Senior Fellow and inaugural Executive-in-Residence. While housed at AIT's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Asia Center, Chin worked closely with the then-AIT President and Office of the Secretary in supporting advocacy, outreach and engagement efforts to rebuild AIT's campus following 2011's devastating floods in Thailand. He founded advisory firm RiverPeak Group, LLC in 2012, as a means to build on his prior work in the public, private and not-for-profit sectors. Through RiverPeak Group, Chin focuses on opportunities and economic growth in the United States and Asia & Pacific regions. This has in included providing counsel to Equator Pure Nature, a leading Southeast Asia-based consumer products company. In 2013, Chin was elected to the board of World Education Services (WES), the United States‚Äô leading authority on credential evaluation and provider of research about student mobility, international enrollment management, and transnational education. He served on the Governance Committee of the Board, and as a trustee from 2013-2017. In 2014, the Milken Institute, a Los Angeles-based non-partisan, non-profit economic and policy think tank, appointed Chin as its inaugural Asia Fellow. In this role, Chin provides guidance and expertise in shaping the direction and programs of the Institute's Asia Center, based in Singapore, and also serves as a global resource to colleagues in Los Angeles and Washington. As part of the global Milken Institute team, Chin has joined forces with the think tank's leadership to address such issues as infrastructure and technology innovation. In 2015, he joined the Advisory Board of Dolma Impact Fund ‚Äì the first international private equity fund purely focused on Nepal.  Economic and public affairs commentary  Chin remains a powerful voice for issues related to ‚Äúresponsible development,‚Äù that is economic development that embraces ‚Äúpeople, planet and partnership‚Äù with a particular regard for the weakest and most vulnerable, including women and children.

The Chinese project partners are the Chinese Academy of Cultural Heritage and the Monument Preservation Office of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The cooperation agreement was signed on 11 April 2013.  Methodology Research and excavation concentrates on two sites containing graves dating over several centuries. The excavations, typically lasting decades, are to be integrated into the current state of research with the help of an interdisciplinary team. Collaboration with different institutions makes multi-layered research possible by combining the methodologies of archaeology, textile and leather research, dye, weaving and style analysis, ornament research, paleopathology, vegetation study, climate research, and linguistics. Twenty complete outfits including about 100 individual artifacts and objects found in the Turpan and Hami regions will be studied. The following questions are being addressed: When was this clothing worn? Who wore which clothing? When was it produced? Are there gender, age, or social-class-related characteristics? Were there specific fashions for individual groups? What conclusions can be drawn from the clothing about the geoclimatic situation and the trade routes of the time?Das Projekt ‚ÄûSilk Road Fashion‚Äú entschl√ºsselt die Sprache der Kleider article dated 20 February 2015, retrieved 9 April 2015 The analysis includes a comparison with neighboring regions, specifically with the Pazyryk culture in the Altai Mountains, the graves of Xiongnu nomads in Mongolia, Chinese textiles and style models, and Greco-Roman portrayals of clothing and accessories. Research results Graves containing up to 3000 years old textiles have been found in the autonomous Uygur region of Xinjiang, located in the Turpan oasis in northwestern China. At that time, nomadic pastoral farming was spreading out in Asia. Increasing extreme aridity ensured natural conservation. A pair of woven wool trousers some 3,200 years old, consisting of two legs and a stepped gusset, has since early 2014 been officially declared the world's oldest trousers. Researchers have determined that the material was not cut to size but woven custom fit for each individual. Based on the other grave relics like typical weapons and bridles, the assumption is that these trousers were worn by horseback riders. This is also suggested by the wide crotch gusset, which allows the rider to easily sit astride a horse. Clothing artifacts from the 7th to 3rd century BC could be assigned to groups of herders who either dwelt there or had migrated into the area. Finds dating later, from the 3rd to 1st century BC, show the clear influence of migrants and travelers from China, the Greco-Roman world, Parthia, Sogdia, and the Kushan Empire in Saka city states at the southern border of the Tarim Basin, confirming already-suspected contacts and trade routes.e-Forschungsberichte des DAI 2014, Faszikel 1, retrieved 9 April 2015 The Greeks advanced eastward, the Chinese westward, trade prospered and assured frequent contact among these ethnic groups. The beginnings of these contacts and the mutual influence can be identified in their clothing. Analysis of the fibers and dyes revealed the use of alizarin, purpurin, rubiadin, quinizarin, indigo and indirubin. Locally grown madder was primarily used for the red shades; indigo for the blue shades was probably imported.Annemarie Kramell, Xiao Li u. a.: \\"Dyes of late Bronze Age textile clothes and accessories from the Yanghai archaeological site, Turfan, China: Determination of the fibers, color analysis and dating.\\" In: Quaternary International. 348, 2014, S. 214, . This is not only evidence of trade, but also of one of the oldest scientifically confirmed uses of madder and indigo to dye textiles in the Xinjiang region. Material analysis and documentation of finds help in the development of methodologies as well as conservation and restoration measures for the physical preservation of cultural heritage in Xinjiang and the improvement of its virtual availability worldwide. National history insights come not only from studying the burial grounds themselves, but also from the associated discovery of dwellings, Buddhist cloister and temple buildings, stupas, streets, workshops, irrigation systems, city walls, and nearby gardens and fields. Primary data of unprecedented quality and quantity are being obtained from studying the outfits of individuals, their climatic environment, and texts in local languages. Starting in 2017, teaching material, six dissertations, several museum exhibitions, and an international fashion show presenting the effect of the clothing on a moving body will be produced.

This decision was taken by a cabinet sub-committee on 8 January 1947, in response to apprehension of an American return to isolationism, fears that Britain might lose its great power status, and the actions by the United States to withdraw unilaterally from sharing of nuclear technology under the 1943 Quebec Agreement. The decision was publicly announced in the House of Commons on 12 May 1948. HER was a civil project, not a military one. Staff were drawn from and recruited into the Civil Service, and were paid Civil Service salaries. It was headed by Lord Portal, as Controller of Production, Atomic Energy, in the Ministry of Supply. An Atomic Energy Research Establishment was located at a former airfield, Harwell, in Berkshire, under the direction of John Cockcroft. The first nuclear reactor in the UK, a small research reactor known as GLEEP, went critical at Harwell on 15 August 1947. British staff at the Montreal Laboratory designed a larger reactor, known as BEPO, which went critical on 5 July 1948. They provided experience and expertise that would later be employed on the larger, production reactors. Production facilities were constructed under the direction of Christopher Hinton, who established his headquarters in a former Royal Ordnance Factory at Risley in Lancashire. These included a uranium metal plant at Springfields, nuclear reactors and a plutonium processing plant at Windscale, and a gaseous diffusion uranium enrichment facility at Capenhurst, near Chester. The two Windscale reactors became operational in October 1950 and June 1951. The gaseous diffusion plant at Capenhurst began producing highly enriched uranium in 1954. William Penney directed bomb design from Fort Halstead. In 1951 his design group moved to a new site at Aldermaston in Berkshire. The first British atomic bomb was successfully tested in Operation Hurricane, during which it was detonated on board the frigate anchored off the Monte Bello Islands in Australia on 3 October 1952. Britain thereby became the third country to test nuclear weapons, after the United States and the Soviet Union. The project concluded with the delivery of the first of its Blue Danube atomic bombs to Bomber Command in November 1953, but British hopes of a renewed nuclear Special Relationship with the United States were frustrated. The technology had been superseded by the American development of the hydrogen bomb, which was first tested in November 1952, only one month after Operation Hurricane. Britain went on to develop its own hydrogen bombs, which it first tested in 1957. A year later, the United States and Britain resumed nuclear weapons cooperation. Background =Tube Alloys= John Anderson, the minister responsible for Tube Alloysalt=Portrait sitting, in suit, in profile The neutron was discovered by James Chadwick at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in February 1932. In April 1932, his Cavendish colleagues John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton split lithium atoms with accelerated protons. Enrico Fermi and his team in Rome conducted experiments involving the bombardment of elements by slow neutrons, which produced heavier elements and isotopes. Then, in December 1938, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann at Hahn's laboratory in Berlin-Dahlem bombarded uranium with slowed neutrons, and discovered that barium had been produced, and therefore that the uranium nucleus had been split. Hahn wrote to his colleague Lise Meitner, who, with her nephew Otto Frisch, developed a theoretical justification for the process, which they published in Nature in 1939. By analogy with the division of biological cells, they named the process \\"fission\\". The discovery of fission raised the possibility that an extremely powerful atomic bomb could be created. The term was already familiar to the British public through the writings of H. G. Wells, in his 1913 novel The World Set Free. George Paget Thomson, at Imperial College London, and Mark Oliphant, an Australian physicist at the University of Birmingham, were tasked with carrying out a series of experiments on uranium. By February 1940, Thomson's team had failed to create a chain reaction in natural uranium, and he had decided that it was not worth pursuing; but at Birmingham, Oliphant's team had reached a strikingly different conclusion. Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Frisch, who could not work on the university's secret projects like radar because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. They calculated the critical mass of a metallic sphere of pure uranium-235, and found that instead of tons, as everyone had assumed, as little as would suffice, which would explode with the power of thousands of tons of dynamite. Oliphant took the Frisch‚ÄìPeierls memorandum to Sir Henry Tizard, the chairman of the Tizard Committee, and the MAUD Committee was established to investigate further. It directed an intensive research effort, and in July 1941, produced two comprehensive reports that concluded an atomic bomb was not only technically feasible, but could be produced before the war ended, perhaps in as little as two years. The Committee unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an atomic bomb as a matter of urgency, although it recognised that the resources required might be beyond those available to Britain. A new directorate known by the deliberately misleading name of Tube Alloys was created to coordinate this effort. Sir John Anderson, the Lord President of the Council, became the minister responsible, and Wallace Akers from Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) was appointed the director of Tube Alloys. =Manhattan Project= In July 1940, Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research, and Cockcroft, as part of the Tizard Mission, briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. The British and American projects exchanged information, but did not initially combine their efforts. British officials did not reply to an August 1941 American offer to create a combined project. In November 1941, Frederick L. Hovde, the head of the London liaison office of the American Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), raised the issue of cooperation and exchange of information with Anderson and Lord Cherwell, who demurred, ostensibly over concerns about American security. Ironically, it was the British project that had already been penetrated by atomic spies for the Soviet Union. alt=Groves sits a completely clean desk. Chadwick, seated next to him, looks on. The United Kingdom did not have the manpower or resources of the United States, and despite its early and promising start, Tube Alloys fell behind its American counterpart and was dwarfed by it. On 30 July 1942, Anderson advised the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, that: \\"We must face the fact that ... [our] pioneering work ... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped. We now have a real contribution to make to a 'merger.' Soon we shall have little or none.\\" The British considered producing an atomic bomb without American help, but the project would have needed overwhelming priority, the projected cost was staggering, disruption to other wartime projects was inevitable, and it was unlikely to be ready in time to affect the outcome of the war in Europe. The unanimous response was that before embarking on this, another effort should be made to secure American cooperation. At the Quadrant Conference in August 1943, Churchill and the American President, Franklin Roosevelt, signed the Quebec Agreement, which merged the two national projects. Its terms made it clear that Britain was the junior partner in the Grand Alliance. The British considered the Quebec Agreement to be the best deal they could have struck under the circumstances, and the restrictions were the price they had to pay to obtain the technical information needed for a successful post-war nuclear weapons project. Margaret Gowing noted that the \\"idea of the independent deterrent was already well entrenched.\\" The Quebec Agreement established the Combined Policy Committee and the Combined Development Trust to coordinate their efforts. The 19 September 1944 Hyde Park Aide-M√©moire extended both commercial and military cooperation into the post-war period. A British mission led by Akers assisted in the development of gaseous diffusion technology at the SAM Laboratories in New York. Another, led by Oliphant, who acted as deputy director at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, assisted with the electromagnetic separation process. Cockcroft became the director of the Anglo-Canadian Montreal Laboratory. The British mission to the Los Alamos Laboratory led by James Chadwick, and later Peierls, included distinguished scientists such as Geoffrey Taylor, James Tuck, Niels Bohr, William Penney, Frisch, Ernest Titterton and Klaus Fuchs, who was later revealed to be a Soviet spy. As overall head of the British Mission, Chadwick forged a close and successful partnership with Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project. He ensured that British participation was complete and wholehearted. =End of American cooperation= With the end of the war the Special Relationship between Britain and the United States \\"became very much less special\\". The British government had trusted that America would share nuclear technology, which it considered a joint discovery. On 8 August 1945 the Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, sent a message to President Harry Truman in which he referred to themselves as \\"heads of the Governments which have control of this great force\\". Roosevelt had died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Aide-M√©moire was not binding on subsequent administrations. In fact, the American copy was temporarily physically lost. When Field Marshal Henry Maitland Wilson raised the matter in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June, the American copy could not be found. The British sent Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson a photocopy on 18 July 1945. Even then, Groves questioned the document's authenticity until the American copy was located years later in the papers of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, Jr., Roosevelt's naval aide, apparently misfiled by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was, and thought it had something to do with naval guns. On 9 November 1945, Attlee and the Prime Minister of Canada, Mackenzie King, went to Washington, D.C., to confer with Truman about future cooperation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power. A Memorandum of Intention they signed replaced the Quebec Agreement. It made Canada a full partner; continued the Combined Policy Committee and Combined Development Trust; and reduced the obligation to obtain consent for the use of nuclear weapons to merely requiring consultation. The three leaders agreed that there would be full and effective cooperation on atomic energy, but British hopes for a resumption of cooperation on nuclear energy were disappointed. The Americans soon made it clear that cooperation was restricted to basic scientific research. The next meeting of the Combined Policy Committee on 15 April 1946 produced no accord on collaboration, and resulted in an exchange of cables between Truman and Attlee. Truman cabled on 20 April that he did not see the communiqu√© he had signed as obligating the United States to assist Britain in designing, constructing and operating an atomic energy plant. The passing of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) in August 1946, which was signed by Truman on 1 August 1946, and went into effect at midnight on 1 January 1947, ended technical cooperation. Its control of \\"restricted data\\" prevented the United States' allies from receiving any information. This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of British physicist Alan Nunn May, who had worked in the Montreal Laboratory, in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated. The remaining British scientists working in the United States were denied access to papers that they had written just days before. Resumption of independent UK efforts =Organisation= alt=Head and shoulders of a man in RAF uniform Attlee had created a cabinet sub-committee, the Gen 75 Committee (known informally by Attlee as the \\"Atomic Bomb Committee\\"), on 10 August 1945 to examine the feasibility of a nuclear weapons programme. To provide technical advice, Attlee created an Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy, with Anderson as its chairman. Anderson was an independent Member of Parliament for the Scottish Universities who sat on the Opposition Front Bench. As chairman of the Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy, Anderson had his own office in the Cabinet Office, and the services of its secretariat. He accompanied Attlee on his November 1945 trip to the United States. A 2September 1945 Admiralty study of \\"The Influence of the Atomic Bomb on War\\" forecast that an enemy could build 500 bombs during ten years of peace, and warned that if 10 per cent of the arsenal was used on the United Kingdom, \\"over night the main base of the British Empire could be rendered ineffective\\", with enough left for other British forces around the world. In October 1945, the Gen 75 Committee considered the issue of ministerial responsibility for atomic energy. The Cabinet Secretary, Sir Edward Bridges, and the Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy both recommended that it be placed within the Ministry of Supply. Developing atomic energy would require an enormous construction effort, which the Ministry of Supply was best equipped to undertake. The Tube Alloys Directorate was transferred from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research to the Ministry of Supply effective 1 November 1945. To coordinate the atomic energy effort, it was decided to appoint a Controller of Production, Atomic Energy (CPAE). The Minister of Supply, John Wilmot, suggested Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Portal, the wartime Chief of the Air Staff. Portal was reluctant to accept the post, as he felt that he lacked administrative experience outside the Royal Air Force, but eventually accepted it for a two-year term, commencing in March 1946. In this role he had direct access to the Prime Minister. Portal ran the project until 1951, when he was succeeded by Sir Frederick Morgan. He established his headquarters at Shell Mex House on the Strand, London, where the wartime Tube Alloys had been. Special security barriers were installed to close off this section of the offices, giving the area the nickname \\"the Cage\\". alt=Man in a suit speaks at a microphone. With Portal's appointment came consideration of splitting Anderson's committee, which functioned as both an advisory and an interdepartmental body. In August 1946, a new standing committee was created, the Atomic Energy Official Committee, which assumed the interdepartmental function. In March 1947, Roger Makins became its chairman. Anderson's committee declined in influence, and was disbanded when he departed at the end of 1947. During the war, Christopher Hinton had been seconded from ICI to the Ministry of Supply and had become Deputy Director General of Filling Factories. He was due to return to ICI at the end 1945, but agreed to oversee the design, construction and operation of the new facilities at a salary far below that offered by ICI. He established his headquarters in a former Royal Ordnance Factory at Risley in Lancashire on 4 February 1946. Portal also created a position of Deputy Controller (Technical Policy), to which he appointed Michael Perrin. This created ill-feeling, as Perrin had been junior to Hinton at ICI. Portal also created a Technical Committee to replace the old Tube Alloys Technical Committee. To give the Ministry of Supply's control over atomic energy a legal form, a bill was introduced into the House of Commons on 1 May 1946 that became law as the Atomic Energy Act 1946 on 6 November 1946. During the war, Chadwick, Cockcroft, Oliphant, Peierls, Harrie Massey and Herbert Skinner had met in Washington, D.C., in November 1944, and drawn up a proposal for a British atomic energy research establishment, which they had calculated would cost around ¬£1.5 million. The Tube Alloys Committee endorsed their recommendation in April 1945, and Attlee announced its creation in the House of Commons on 29 October 1945, informing the House that it would cost about ¬£1 million to build and ¬£500,000 per annum to run. The obvious choices for a director of the new establishment were Chadwick and Cockcroft, and the former urged that the latter be appointed. Cockcroft agreed, subject to stipulation in writing that he would be answerable only to the Minister and his Permanent Secretary, and, except where subject to requirements for military secrecy, the establishment would be run like a university, with free exchange of views and the publication of papers. His appointment was announced in November 1945, although he did not leave Canada until September 1946. The Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) did not come under Portal's control until January 1950. A committee selected a site for the AERE at RAF Harwell, an airfield about south of Oxford. The airfield was a modern one, with a long runway, and the Air Ministry was reluctant to release it until the Prime Minister intervened. Responsibility for the development of atomic bombs lay outside the realm of the Ministry of Defence. One reason for this was that it was only created in October 1946, by which time Portal had already been appointed as CPAE. Tizard became the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence in November 1946, and in January 1947 he also became the chairman of the Defence Research Policy Committee (DRPC), which was established to advise the Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff on matters of scientific policy. Tizard attempted to gain some control over nuclear weapons policy. Anderson's advisory committee was abolished at the end of 1947, and two new committees were established in its place, the Atomic Energy (Defence Research) Committee AE(DR), which came under the DRPC, and was chaired by Tizard; and the Atomic Energy (Review of Production) Committee, which was answerable to Portal. But Tizard failed to gain control of atomic energy policy. =Decision= An early debate among the scientists was whether the fissile material for an atomic bomb should be uranium-235 or plutonium. Tube Alloys had performed much of the pioneering research on gaseous diffusion for uranium enrichment, and Oliphant's team in Berkeley were well-acquainted with the electromagnetic process. The staff that had remained in Britain strongly favoured uranium-235; but the scientists that had worked in the United States argued for plutonium on the basis of its greater efficiency as an explosive, despite the fact that they had neither the expertise in the design of nuclear reactors to produce it, nor the requisite knowledge of plutonium chemistry or metallurgy to extract it. However, the Montreal Laboratory had designed and was building pilot reactors, and had carried out some work on separating plutonium from uranium. The Manhattan Project had pursued both avenues, and the scientists who had worked at Los Alamos were aware of work there with composite cores that used both; but there were concerns that Britain might not have the money, resources or skilled manpower for this. In the end, it came down to economics; a reactor could be built more cheaply than a separation plant that produced an equivalent quantity of enriched uranium, and made more efficient use of uranium fuel. A reactor and separation plant capable of producing enough plutonium for fifteen bombs per year was costed at around ¬£20 million. The facility was approved by the Gen 75 committee on 18 December 1945 \\"with the highest urgency and importance\\". alt=Two men sit side by side at a desk. A few months later, Portal, who had not been appointed when this decision was taken, began to have doubts. Word reached him of problems with the Hanford Site reactors, which had been all but completely shut down due to Wigner's disease. On a visit to the United States in May 1946, Groves advised Portal not to build a reactor. By this time, there was interest from the scientists in making better use of uranium fuel by re-enrichment of spent fuel rods. A gaseous diffusion plant was costed at somewhere between ¬£30 and ¬£40 million. The Gen 75 Committee considered the proposal in October 1946. Perrin, who was present, later recalled that: Penney had joined the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1944, and had served on the Target Committee that had selected cities to be attacked. He had been in the observation plane Big Stink during the bombing of Nagasaki, and had done damage assessment on the ground following Japan's surrender. He had returned to England in November 1945 intending to resume his academic career, but was approached by C. P. Snow, one of the Civil Service Commissioners, and asked to become Chief Superintendent Armament Research (CSAR, pronounced \\"Caesar\\"), in charge of the Ministry of Supply's Armaments Research Department (ARD) at Fort Halstead in Kent. His appointment as CSAR was announced on 1 January 1946, but Groves asked him to assist in the American Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll. Penney left for the United States in March 1946, and did not return to Britain until October 1946. Portal then asked him to draw up a scheme for an Atomic Weapons Section within the Armaments Research Department which would design, develop and construct atomic bombs. In his 1 November 1946 report to Portal, which he had to type himself for security reasons, Penney provided a proposed organisation chart, detailed his staffing requirements, and listed his accommodation requirements, which he felt could be met at Fort Halstead, the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, and Shoeburyness. alt=Head and shoulders of a man in suit and tie In July 1946, the Chiefs of Staff Committee considered the issue of nuclear weapons, and recommended that Britain acquire them. This recommendation was accepted by the Cabinet Defence Committee on 22 July 1946. The Chief of the Air Staff, Lord Tedder, officially requested an atomic bomb on 9 August 1946. The Chiefs of Staff estimated that 200 bombs would be required by 1957. Despite this, and the research and construction of facilities that had already been approved, there was still no official decision to proceed with making atomic bombs. Portal submitted his proposal to do so at the 8 January 1947 meeting of the Gen 163 Committee, another ad hoc committee, which agreed to proceed with the development of atomic bombs. It also endorsed Portal's proposal to place Penney in charge of the bomb development effort, although Penney was not informed of this decision until May. Of the decision, Margaret Gowing wrote: This represented deep-rooted British political and strategic ideas. The war had left Britain impoverished. Its gold and dollar reserves had been depleted. A third of its merchant ships now lay on the bottom of the ocean. About 250,000 homes had been destroyed and another 3 million had been damaged while hardly any had been built for years. In early 1947, factories suspended production for want of coal. The United States had abruptly terminated Lend-Lease when the war ended. In its place was a $3.75 billion loan from the United States and a $1.25 billion loan from Canada, most of which had been spent by August 1947. Nonetheless, there remained an implacable belief that the future would be like the past. Bevin told the House of Commons on 16 May 1947 that: In his 1961 memoirs, Attlee explained his decision: The decision was publicly announced in the House of Commons on 12 May 1948 by the Minister of Defence, Albert Alexander, albeit in an oblique answer to a pre-arranged question from George Jeger, a Labour Party backbencher. D notice No. 25 prohibited the publication of details on the design, construction or location of atomic weapons. The project was hidden under the cover name \\"Basic High Explosive Research\\". \\"Basic\\" was soon dropped and it became simply \\"High Explosive Research\\" (HER). Uranium Uranium was the only known fuel for nuclear reactors, so securing an adequate supply was crucial to the British atomic energy programme. During the war, Britain took the lead in reopening the world's richest uranium mine, the Shinkolobwe mine in the Belgian Congo, which had been flooded and closed, as 30 per cent of the stock in Union Mini√®re du Haut Katanga, the company that owned the mine, was controlled by British interests. In May 1944, Sir John Anderson and US Ambassador John Winant negotiated a deal with the Belgian government in exile and Edgar Sengier, the director of Union Mini√®re, for the mine to be reopened and of ore to be purchased at $1.45 a pound. American and British leaders concluded that it was in their best interest to gain control of as much of the world's uranium deposits as possible. The Combined Development Trust was established for this purpose on 14 June 1944. It consisted of three American, two British and one Canadian members, with an American, initially Groves, as chairman. By the end of the war, it had control of 97 per cent of the world's uranium and 65 per cent of the thorium. Uranophane in malachite specimen from the Shinkolobwe mine During the war, all the uranium from the Congo had gone to the United States, as had that captured in Europe by the Alsos Mission, even though some of it passed through British hands. The entire output of the Shinkolobwe mine was contracted to the Combined Development Trust until 1956, but in March 1946 there were fears that the mine might be exhausted in 1947, resulting in a severe uranium shortage. After some negotiation, Groves and Chadwick agreed on a division of uranium ore production, with everything up to March 1946 going to the United States, and supplies being shared equally thereafter. At the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 31 July 1946, the financial arrangements were adjusted. Previously, the two countries had split the costs equally; henceforth each would pay for only what they actually received. Britain was therefore able to secure the uranium it needed without having to outbid the United States, and paid for it in sterling. Meanwhile, because the adjustment applied retrospectively to VJ Day, it received reimbursement for the supplies allocated to the United States, thus easing Britain's dollar shortage. By the end of 1946, Britain had received , and another 500 was stockpiled for the Trust at Springfields, near Preston in Lancashire. Uranium ore was stockpiled in Britain because the McMahon Act did not permit it to be exported from the United States. Groves extended the arrangement into 1947, and another was shipped to Britain, all of which was added to the Springfields stockpile. Its growing size was the principal reason the Americans reopened the negotiations resulting in the Modus Vivendi, which allowed for limited sharing of technical information between the United States, Britain and Canada. Under this agreement, all the Congo ore from 1948 and 1949 was shipped to the United States. The Trust was renamed the Combined Development Agency in January 1948. The first Soviet atomic bomb test in August 1949 was embarrassing to the British (who had not expected a Soviet atomic weapon until 1954) for having been beaten, but it was for the Americans another reason for cooperation. The agreement on raw materials was due to expire at the end of the year. The Americans offered to make bombs in the United States available for Britain to use if the British agreed to end their atomic bomb programme. This offer was rejected on the grounds that it was not \\"compatible with our status as a first class power to depend on others for weapons of this supreme importance.\\" Instead, the British suggested that there would be a full exchange of atomic information, and in return for ending the production of atomic bombs in Britain, American bombs would be stored in Britain under British control. This would have given Britain nuclear weapons much sooner than its own target date of late 1952. The opposition of several key officials, including the United States Atomic Energy Commission's Lewis Strauss, and Senators Bourke B. Hickenlooper and Arthur Vandenberg, coupled with security concerns aroused by the 2 February 1950 arrest of Fuchs, who was working at Harwell, as a Soviet spy, caused the proposal to be rejected. By this time, most of the original allocated to Britain had been used up, and the Americans agreed to allocate from the Springfields stockpile. Britain was allocated a further in 1951, and in 1952. Due to increased production, and the discovery and development of new sources of uranium in Portugal, South Africa and Australia, there was sufficient uranium for the United States, British and Canadian programmes, although Britain had to cancel a reactor in 1949. Production facilities Between January 1946 and March 1953, ¬£44 million was spent on constructing nuclear weapons facilities. Staff were drawn from and recruited into the Civil Service, and were paid Civil Service salaries. =Uranium metal plant= During the war, Chadwick had arranged for ICI to build a small plant to produce uranium. By 1947, it was operational and producing per week. This would be used in BEPO, the experimental reactor built at Harwell, but the plant required uranium oxide feed, and the export of this from the United States was banned under the McMahon Act. Hinton and his staff at Risley built a new uranium plant at Springfields, on the site of a former poison gas plant, at a cost of ¬£5.5 million. The first uranium metal was produced in October 1948. Uranium ore was crushed and dissolved in acids. Impurities were separated and uranium oxide was precipitated. Radium was returned to Union Mini√®re under the contract with the company. The uranium oxide was then purified. It was dissolved in nitric acid to produce uranyl nitrate. This was then dissolved in ether, drawn off and precipitated by the addition of ammonia, producing ammonium diuranate. The ammonium diuranate was heated in a furnace and reduced with hydrogen and hydrofluoric acid to produce uranium tetrafluoride. Heating and mixing with calcium metal reduced it to metallic uranium, leaving calcium fluoride behind as a slag. The metallic uranium was then cast into billets. These were extruded into rods and sealed in aluminium cans. =Nuclear reactors= The first nuclear reactor in the UK, a small 100 kW research reactor known as GLEEP, went critical at Harwell on 15 August 1947. It was fuelled by of uranium metal and of uranium dioxide, and used of nuclear graphite as a neutron moderator. This was fine for some experimental work, but the production of radioactive isotopes required a more powerful 6,000 kW reactor with a higher neutron flux. British staff at the Montreal Laboratory had designed BEPO in 1945 and 1946; Risley handled the engineering and construction. The key choices in reactor design are the selection of the fuel, the neutron moderator, and the coolant. Since enriched uranium was unavailable, the only available fuel was natural uranium. Similarly, while the Montreal Laboratory had experience with designing and building the ZEEP heavy-water reactor in Canada, no heavy water was available in the UK, so graphite was the only choice for a neutron moderator. That left cooling, and for an experimental reactor, air cooling was the obvious choice. The resulting reactor was thus quite similar to the American X-10 Graphite Reactor. BEPO, which went critical on 5 July 1948, used of metallic uranium and of graphite, encased in of steel and of concrete. alt=Domed factories with two large chmineys For the plutonium-producing production reactors, the same reasons mandated the use of natural uranium fuel and graphite as a moderator; but it was originally assumed that they would be water-cooled like the American reactors at the Hanford Site. A water-cooled reactor of the required size would require about of water per day, preferably very pure so as to avoid corroding the metal pipes. Moreover, there were concerns about safety. Water absorbs neutrons, so if there is a sudden loss of cooling water this will result in an increase in the neutron flux and the reactor temperature, and possibly a catastrophic nuclear meltdown. Such an event did indeed occur in the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. The American solution was to locate the facility in a remote location, but in the densely-populated British Isles the only such locations were in the north and west of Scotland. By April 1947, Hinton had convinced Portal of the advantages of a gas-cooled system. Helium was at first the preferred choice as a coolant gas, but the main source of it was the United States, and under the McMahon Act, the United States would not supply it for nuclear weapons production, so, in the end, air cooling was chosen. With the need for a remote site obviated, it was decided to build the facility on the coast of Cumberland at a former Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Drigg. This was soon switched to a more suitable site at the nearby former ROF Sellafield. To avoid any confusion with Springfields, the name was changed to Windscale. Construction began in September 1947. The danger of the Wigner Effect was not overlooked. Walter Zinn visited Britain in 1948 and provided crucial information. New calculations based on this meant that the layout of the graphite blocks, which were already being machined, had to be changed. The two Windscale reactors became operational in October 1950 and June 1951. Due to faulty calculations at the design stage, the reactors did not produce the expected output. As a result, extraordinary measures had to be taken to provide Penney with a first shipment of plutonium in June 1952, and sufficient quantity for a core by the 1 August 1952 deadline. Improvements in the bomb design ultimately meant that he could get by with 15 per cent less plutonium. Starting in 1953, the Windscale reactors were able to use slightly enriched uranium as a fuel. They were shut down after the Windscale fire in October 1957. =Plutonium processing facility= Cartridges of uranium were irradiated in the Windscale reactors to produce plutonium. The cartridges were pushed through the reactor, and exited on the other side, where they fell into submerged steel skips which were pulled into a deep cooling pond. After being irradiated, each cartridge contained as many as 180 isotopes of 35 different chemical elements. Less than half of one per cent of the feed would have been converted to plutonium, but about 5 per cent was now radioactive fission products, the remainder being slightly depleted uranium. After being stored underwater for 150 days, the short-lived isotopes had decayed, leaving significant quantities of about 20 radioactive isotopes. Using remote handling, the cartridges were placed in lead-lined \\"coffins\\" and transported to the chemical separation plant. At Hanford, the Americans had used a bismuth phosphate process to separate the plutonium from the uranium. This was wasteful; the plutonium was retrieved, but the uranium was left in a state from which it could not easily be recovered. A team at the Montreal Laboratory investigated this problem, and had devised a new process similar to that used with uranium. They had tried out the process, which they believed could be employed on an industrial scale, to extract 20 mg of plutonium from a spent Hanford fuel rod. The cartridges were dissolved in nitric acid and dibutyl carbitol was used to remove the plutonium. After 1946, the only source of plutonium was from the NRX reactor in Canada, and irradiated rods from there did not arrive in Britain until mid-1948. Nor would Harwell have been able to handle them if they had; a \\"hot\\" radioactive laboratory was not built until 1949, although a small hot laboratory was pressed into service in 1948. A pilot plant was established at the Chalk River Laboratories, which ran until 1950. Despite concerns over whether the process would work, numerous minor changes, and construction problems related to the steel used, the plant was completed on schedule in April 1951. The first active material was fed into the plant on 25 February 1952. The plant performed well for twelve years, exceeding its designed production targets, and was only decommissioned when a larger facility was required. The first plutonium billet was cast on 31 March 1952, but it was impure, and could not be used in a bomb. Further work at Harwell and Windscale was required to perfect the process. =Gaseous diffusion plant= The gaseous diffusion plant was the most complicated of all from an engineering point of view. Uranium hexafluoride gas was pumped into a cascade, becoming richer in uranium-235 at each stage as it passed through a series of membranes. Procuring the nickel powder used by the Manhattan Project was not a problem, as it came from a British firm. Once again, a Royal Ordnance Factory was chosen as the site, in this case ROF Capenhurst at Capenhurst, near Chester, which had the advantage of being only from Risley. One decision was that instead of producing uranium hexafluoride using elemental fluorine, which was difficult and hazardous to transport, it was produced at Springfields from chlorine trifluoride. This process was untried and did not work properly, and when production commenced in February 1952, the hexafluoride plant did not perform adequately. It had to be redesigned at a cost of ¬£250,000. The gaseous diffusion plant at Capenhurst, which cost ¬£14 million, started production in 1953, but only produced low-enriched uranium, and did not produce highly enriched uranium until 1954. By 1957 it was capable of producing 125 kg of highly enriched uranium per annum. British designs at this time used large amounts of enriched uranium; 87 kg for Green Bamboo, 117 kg for Orange Herald. At the end of 1961, having produced between 3.8 and 4.9 tonnes of highly enriched uranium, it was switched over to low-enriched uranium production for civil nuclear power. Bomb design Key staff recruited to work at Fort Halstead included John Challens, who commenced on 1 January 1948. By mid-1948, it became clear that Penney's initial estimate that he would require 220 staff was wide of the mark, and that he would need nearly 500. This meant not only taking personnel from other projects, but scrapping some entirely. In October 1948, Penney submitted a request for developing a new, separate site for HER on grounds of safety, security and economy. This was approved, but it took another six months to locate a suitable site. An airbase, RAF South Cerney in Gloucestershire was chosen, but the RAF refused to relinquish the site. A former airbase, RAF Aldermaston, was then selected. At the same time, it was decided to separate HER from the Armaments Research Establishment (ARE). This resulted in a painful bureaucratic battle over personnel like Challens, whose expertise was wanted for research on both nuclear weapons and guided missiles. In the end, HER kept 25 of the 30 key personnel that ARE wanted, including Challens. The site was taken over on 1 April 1950. Penney became Chief Superintendent High Explosive Research (CSHER). The first stage of work at Aldermaston was completed in December 1951, but the plutonium processing building was only handed over in April 1952, the month that the first plutonium was due to arrive from Windscale. At the peak of construction in 1953, over 4,000 personnel were working on the site. alt=Implosion. The detonators set off shaped charges which result in a converging spherical blast. The tamper and the core are compressed, the initiator goes of, the core and then the tamper fission, and there is a huge explosion. The choice of plutonium for the fissile component of the bomb meant that Penney's HER team at Fort Halstead had to design an implosion-type nuclear weapon. The Los Alamos Laboratory had solved the problem of doing this with explosive lenses. The involvement of several British scientists gave HER a solid base of experience to work from. The British design would hew to that of the American Fat Man as closely as possible. An important change would be the substitution of RDX, an ARD product, for Composition B as the fast explosive component of the lenses; Baratol would still provide the slow component. This was handled by the explosives experts at Woolwich, who devised the machining processes and produced prototypes of the lenses and moulds. Production was then handled by two Royal Ordnance Factories. The first lenses were delivered in 1952, and there were enough for two sets for the Operation Hurricane assemblies. Woolwich provided the supercharge, the spherical shell of explosive that encases the tamper. Test firings of explosive lenses were conducted at Foulness by a team under the direction of Roy Pilgrim. To achieve near-simultaneous detonations of the lenses, the Americans had developed the exploding-bridgewire detonator; this had to be duplicated. Ernest Mott and Cecil Bean developed them, while Challens devised the firing circuits. Work on the plutonium core had to wait until Windscale delivered sufficient product, which was not until late 1951. The uranium tamper proved more of a challenge for the metallurgists than anticipated, due to a shortage of machine tools and moulds, and difficulty with the vacuum furnace. The first spheres were cast in December 1951, and while they were spherical to within , there were some casting defects, and it was feared they would hinder the implosion process. The defects were repaired, and two castings were prepared for Operation Hurricane. Work on plutonium chemistry and metallurgy was carried out at Harwell, as the hot laboratory at Aldermaston was not completed until May 1952. The first plutonium billet was cast there from plutonium nitrate from the Chalk River Laboratories in 1951. The metallurgists chose to alloy the plutonium with gallium to stabilise it in the malleable Œ¥ phase allotrope. Not until the first billet arrived from Harwell in 1951 were they able to confirm that this was practical. The first plutonium at Aldermaston was cast in an argon atmosphere in a cerium sulphide crucible. The other radioactive element in use was polonium, which was used in the initiator. It was one of the parts of the Manhattan Project that the British mission had not been involved in, and little was known about its chemistry and properties, except that it had a half life of 138 days. A disturbing discovery was that motes of polonium could propel themselves through the air using their own alpha particle emissions. Safety procedures had to be tightened. It was produced at Windscale by irradiation of bismuth. A special plant was built there to extract it, but it was not operational until June 1952. The final product was just of polonium, less than 1 mg. It was only just available on time for Operation Hurricane. A small RAF team that eventually numbered ten men was assigned to liaise with HER, under the command of Wing Commander John Rowlands. He was answerable to a committee at the Air Ministry, codenamed \\"Herod\\". They considered how atomic bombing missions would be flown, and prepared training courses and manuals on how the production weapon, codenamed Blue Danube, would be stored, handled and maintained. The ballistic casing of the bomb was designed at Farnborough. Rowlands was responsible for an important design change. For safety reasons, he wanted the core inserted like a plug while the bomber was in flight. Fuchs performed calculations of the nuclear physics involved at Harwell in 1948, and produced an alternative design that, while untried, could be used. The new British design incorporated a levitated pit, in which there was an air gap between the uranium tamper and the plutonium core. This gave the explosion time to build up momentum, similar in principle to a hammer hitting a nail. Testing alt=A small warship Implicit in the decision to develop atomic bombs was the need to test them. The preferred site was the American Pacific Proving Grounds. As a fallback, sites in Canada and Australia were considered. In September 1950, the Admiralty suggested that the Monte Bello Islands in Australia might be suitable, so Attlee sent a request to the Prime Minister of Australia, Robert Menzies, for permission to send a survey party to have a look at the islands. Menzies agreed, and in November 1950, a three-man party headed by Air Vice Marshal E. D. Davis was sent out to the islands. The Australian government formally agreed to the islands being used in May 1951, and in December 1951 the new British government under Winston Churchill confirmed the choice of test site. On 26 February 1952 Churchill announced in the House of Commons that the first British atomic bomb test would occur in Australia before the end of the year. A small fleet was assembled for Operation Hurricane that included the aircraft carrier , which served as the flagship, and the LSTs Narvik, Zeebrugge and Tracker, under the command of Rear Admiral A. D. Torlesse. Leonard Tyte from Aldermaston was appointed the technical director. The bomb assemblies for Operation Hurricane were assembled at Foulness, and then taken to the frigate on 5 June 1952 for transport to Australia. It took Campania and Plym eight weeks to make the voyage, as they sailed around the Cape of Good Hope to avoid traversing the Suez Canal, as there was unrest in Egypt at the time. The Monte Bello Islands were reached on 8 August. They were joined by eleven Royal Australian Navy ships, including the aircraft carrier . The plutonium core went by air, flying from RAF Lyneham to Singapore in a Handley Page Hastings aircraft via Cyprus, Sharjah and Ceylon. From Singapore they made the final leg of their journey in a Short Sunderland flying boat. Penney arrived by air on 22 September. The bomb was successfully detonated on board Plym at 09:29:24 on 3 October 1952 local time (23:59:24 on 2 October 1952 UTC). The explosion occurred below the water line, and left a saucer-shaped crater on the seabed deep and across. The yield was estimated at . Delivery systems A July 1945 Tizard Committee report foresaw the advent of long-range rockets and pilotless aircraft, but did not envision them as likely within ten years, and therefore urged the development of long-range jet bombers. In 1946, the RAF's front line bomber was the Avro Lincoln, a development of the wartime Avro Lancaster. It did not have the range to reach targets in the Soviet Union, nor could it deal with jet fighter interceptors. Operational Requirement (OR229) called for a high-altitude jet bomber with a range of carrying an atomic bomb. The 9 August 1946 requirement for an atomic bomb (OR1001) specified that it be not more than in length or in diameter, and weigh no more than . A alt=A sleek white jet aircraft OR229 was approved by the Operational Requirements Committee on 17 December 1946, and the Ministry of Supply sent out letters inviting tenders on 8 January 1947. Three bombers resulted from OR229: the Vickers Valiant, Avro Vulcan and Handley Page Victor, known as the V bombers. The high priority accorded to the atomic bomb programme was not shared by the V bomber programme. Vickers was given the first production order for 25 Valiants on 9 February 1951, and they were delivered on 8 February 1955. The Vulcan and Victor followed, entering service in 1956 and 1957 respectively. Thus, when the first Blue Danube atomic bombs were delivered to the Bomber Command Armaments School at RAF Wittering on 7 and 11 November 1953, the RAF had no bombers capable of carrying them. Penney noted that \\"the RAF has handled aircraft for a long time and can fly Valiants as soon as they come off the production line. But the Royal Air Force has not yet handled atomic weapons, therefore, we must get some bombs to the RAF at the earliest possible moment, so that the handling and servicing can be practised and fully worked out.\\" For the time being, the United Kingdom remained dependent on the American nuclear umbrella. On 5 November 1953, the Air and Naval Staffs therefore issued an Operational Requirement (OR1127) for a smaller, lighter atomic bomb capable of being carried by their English Electric Canberra, Gloster Javelin and Supermarine Scimitar aircraft. Aldermaston commenced work on the new bomb, codenamed Red Beard, in 1954. It had a composite uranium-plutonium core, and used air lenses to reduce its dimensions while still having a yield of 10 kilotons. Indeed, later boosted versions had yields of up to 100 kilotons. Red Beard weighed , about a fifth of Blue Danube, was long and in diameter. It was tested in the Operation Buffalo British nuclear tests at Maralinga in September and October 1956, but various problems encountered meant that deliveries of production versions to the RAF and Royal Navy did not occur until 1960. Outcome In 1951, Penney wrote that \\"the discriminative test for a first-class power is whether it has made an atomic bomb and we have either got to pass the test or suffer a serious loss of prestige both inside this country and internationally.\\" There was fear of being left behind, and hope that the United States would be sufficiently impressed to resume the Special Relationship. The successful test of an atomic bomb represented an extraordinary technological achievement. Britain became the world's third nuclear power. High Explosive Research achieved its objective with remarkable economy and efficiency, but the price was still high. Between 1946 and 1953, Risley spent ¬£72 million, Harwell almost ¬£27 million and the weapons establishment over ¬£9.5 million. By comparison, British defence expenditure in 1948 was ¬£600 million. HER accounted for 11 per cent of the Ministry of Supply's expenditure between 1946 and 1953. It had bi-partisan and popular support. Given Britain's dire financial position, thought turned to replacing conventional forces with atomic bombs. While certainly expensive, they could deliver extraordinary destructive power at relatively low cost. The concept of deterrence began to evolve, based on experiences dating back to the Great War. There were also technological spin-offs. The possession of nuclear reactors, the means to produce nuclear fuels and a repository of scientific knowledge led to the creation of a vast nuclear power industry. Yet all the while Britain strived for independence, at the same time it sought interdependence in the form of a renewal of the Special Relationship with the United States. This was desired more than ever, as other countries recovered from the war and once again began to challenge Britain's status. As successful as it was, High Explosive Research fell short on both counts. The technology demonstrated at Monte Bello in October 1952 was already seven years old. The following month the United States tested Ivy Mike, a thermonuclear device. The British government would now have to decide whether to initiate its own hydrogen bomb programme. Penney, for one, feared that this would likely prove to be beyond the financial resources of Britain's war-ravaged economy. The successful British hydrogen bomb programme, and a favourable international relations climate caused by the Sputnik crisis, led to amendment of the United States Atomic Energy Act in 1958, and a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US‚ÄìUK Mutual Defence Agreement.

Chen Qi with his wife, Qiuben Jiumeizi http://www.chen-qi.net, The life of Chen Qi, Modern Collector Chen Qi was born in Fujian on March 8, 1912, in a merchant family. He was well educated in traditional culture since childhood. Chen Qi began to learn literacy from his grandfather since 1916, and had studied enlightenment readings such as \\"Three Character Classic\\", \\"Thousand Poems\\", \\"Book of Filial Piety\\", and Confucian classics, etc.. He also studied Tang Kai (one of the Chinese traditional calligraphy scripts originated from Tang Dynasty) as daily calligraphy class. In 1927, Chen Qi was enrolled in a church school. In 1928, Chen Qi dropped out of school due to illness. While recuperating at home, he read books and newspapers, and gained a deeper understanding of the devastated and weakened old Chinese society from his communications with businessmen from the South. Just like other youths full with aspirations in the turbulent time, Chen Qi determined to transform China and save Chinese people from the crisis. In 1932, Chen Qi went to Japan and was enrolled in the famous Imperial Japanese Army Academy, a military school founded in 1868. Imperial Japanese Army Academy was committed to Militaristic Spiritual Education and had successfully trained a large number of senior generals participated in the war of aggression against China later on. Many famous modern Chinese generals also graduated from Imperial Japanese Army Academy, such as Cai E, Ying Heqin, Li Rujiong, Tang Enbo, etc. While Chen Qi was in Japan, he not only met his wife, Qiuben Jiumeizi (whom later on moved to China with Chen Qi and changed her name to Lin Yachun), in May 1935, he also got to know Chinese painter, Fu Baoshi, who was holding an exhibition at the time. It was the first exhibition Fu Baoshi held in Japan. Both staying in the foreign country, the two became friends right away. In June of the same year, Fu Baoshi went back to China due to his mother's serious illness (his mother already passed away after his return). Two months later, Chen Qi returned to China as well and was invited by Fu Baoshi to visit Nanchang, where Fu held his first personal exhibition in China. In 1935, Chen Qi was appointed by National Revolutionary Army to teach at the Republic of China Military Academy, also known as Huangpu Military Academy. He became Deputy Director of Training and was granted the rank of Major General. During his tenure, he had made a great contribution through training of military personnel. Just like what the founder of modern China, Sun Yat-sen, had said, \\"we found this school to lead the students to become the foundation of the revolutionary army. You will be the future elites of the revolutionary army. And this is the way that lead to our success in the revolution.\\" During his term as director, Chen Qi developed extensive social contacts not only in politics, but also in business, literary and art circles. He also concentrated in calligraphy, reading and painting. In January 1936 (the 25th year of the \\"Republic Era\\"), Chen Qi went to Tianjin (original destination was Beijing but stayed in Tianjin for a few days) to attend an exhibition in Tianjin Yong'An Restaurant, held by a group of painters including Zhang Daqian, Zhang Shanzi, Xiao Qianzhong, Hu Peiheng, Xu Yansun, Yu Fei'an, and He Haixia. During the trip, besides political and business affairs, Chen Qi made contacts with celebrities in literary and art circles, including Mei Lanfang and Qi Baishi. Although working in the military during the turbulent time, Chen Qi was still deeply affected by Confucianism and traditional cultural education he received since childhood. He continued studying in painting and focused on the collection of various arts and antiques from various Chinese dynasties. In 1955, after arriving at Taiwan, Chen Qi was appointed as a military official of the embassy in Indonesia. He attended multiple international affairs and meetings on behalf of Nationalist Government (Guomin Government), and often traveled between Taiwan and Indonesia due to business and political reasons. In Taiwan, he had close personal relationships with Puru, Zhang Daqian, Huang Junbi, Xu Fuguan, Hu Shih, and Yu Youren. He was also a frequent guest of Jiang Jieshi and Song Meiling. During his work in Indonesia, Chen Qi got to know Chinese painters such as Wu Zishen and Yan Wanyu, and built a close personal relationship with them. They often send each other letters and poems to maintain contacts. In 1965, Chen Qi left his job in Indonesia, and traveled frequently to mainland China during the 1980s. He was generous and made multiple contributions to nonprofit programs and organizations in his homeland, including building schools, water conservation, and the newspaper industry. Meanwhile, he continued studying calligraphy, especially during his old age, and enjoyed the simple life.

Based on Chelsea Cain's 2014 novel One Kick, the series revolves around Kit \\"Kick\\" Lannigan (Leven Rambin), a child abduction survivor, who is recruited by FBI Agent Frank Novak (Chris Noth) for a special task force dedicated to solving missing persons cases. The supporting cast features Danny Pino as John Bishop, Andy Mientus as James Finley and Tracie Thoms as FBI Agent Maya Kennedy. Despite being produced by TF1 in France and RTL Television's sister network VOX in Germany, the series had its world premiere in Australia on Universal Channel on 13 November 2017. In France, the series premiered on TF1, beginning on 23 January 2018 and ending on 27 February 2018. In Germany, the series aired on VOX a day after the French broadcast. In the United Kingdom, the series premiered on Universal Channel on 19 March 2018. In the U.S., the series is set to be shown on WGN America, which acquired the rights to the series in June 2018, in early 2019. Plot Katherine \\"Kit/Kick\\" Lannigan survives a childhood abduction and is rescued by FBI Agent Frank Novak. In the years since, a determined Kick trains in martial arts and the use of firearms. Novak persuades her to join a special task force that he created which is dedicated to solving abductions and missing persons cases. Cast =Main= * Leven Rambin as Kit \\"Kick\\" Lannigan: A former child abduction victim, Kit Lannigan was \\"raised\\" by her abductors for five years until found by FBI agent Frank Novak and returned home. She initially had trouble coping with this shift in her life until Frank suggested she take self-defence classes to deal with her aggression, which inspired her to legally change her name to \\"Kick\\" to reflect her personal growth. She has never attended college but owns her own self-defence centre and has a keen insight into the psychology of abductors and abductees from her background. She has recently learned that her abductors were part of a still-active network of child traffickers, forcing her to confront Mel Foster once again to find more information about the old network. * Chris Noth as Frank Novak: The FBI agent who rescued Kick from her abductors when she was a child, he has maintained a strong presence in her life after she returned to her family, to the point where Kick has explicitly referred to him as a father figure. When he received permission to put together his current task force, which travels the country in a personalized plane to deal with abduction cases throughout America, Novak recruited Kick as he recognized the value of her unique perspective on abduction cases. In \\"Secuestrado\\", it is revealed that he has an estranged daughter who he rarely sees after his marriage broke up due to his focus on his work, and Kick is also shocked to learn that he had a brief affair with her mother after she was rescued. * Danny Pino as John Bishop: A new FBI agent who has previously served with the military; it was revealed in \\"Tiger\\" that Bishop was actually involved in Novak's first ever abduction case, when he witnessed his twin brother Mark being taken when he and Mark were just six years old. * Andy Mientus as James Finley: Another former abduction victim, James was Kick's roommate and a keen computer hacker even before joining Novak's task force. He is gay and has had a couple of dates interrupted due to his role in the task force, but clearly enjoys the chance to make a difference. \\"Romans\\" reveals that he was abducted when he was fourteen after his father told him to leave the family when he came out, and James has not seen any of his family since then until his brother and mother contact him about his father's funeral; this episode also reveals that his mother is deaf. * Tracie Thoms as Maya Kennedy: An FBI agent on Novak's original task force, she stayed with Novak when he established the new task force. Her father owned an auto-repair shop and took her camping when she was a child. =Recurring= * Kelly Rutherford as Paula Lannigan: Kick's mother, who has created a reputation for herself as a spokesperson for families dealing with similar cases, leaving Kick frustrated at her mother's conflicting encouragement to get over her own abduction case while she uses it to fund a career. It was revealed in \\"Secuestrado\\" that she had a brief affair with Frank after he rescued Kick. * Jordan Bridges as Neil Pruitt: A paparazzi photographer who is invasive in his efforts to take photos of Kick. * Christopher O'Shea as Noah: A childhood friend of Kick's, and the only one who didn't treat her strangely when she was returned to her family; the two started dating after he moved to Pittsburgh. * Lee Tergesen as Mel Foster: Kick's abductor. It is strongly implied that he was once the head of the network that abducted Kick and other children, but there is no conclusive evidence to support that theory. After years of sending her letters that she never opened, Mel met Kick once again when a case forced her to talk to him due to a possible link to his old network, during which he 'defended' his abductions as taking children from undeserving parents.

HMM is a free to play game available on Steam, where teams of 4 highly armed machines battle on arenas with a post- apocalyptic scenario. The primary objective is to deliver a bomb on the enemy team base while trying to overcome your opponents and avoid the arena's hazards. The overall theme of the game is based on Heavy metal music and its culture. The game has been in production since 2013 and was officially launched on September 19, 2018. One of the main inspirations for the game was the classic Rock'n'Roll Racing, published for Arcade, Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis, developed by Blizzard Entertainment (Interplay at that time), but also on arena games, such as the MOBAs Rocket League and Twisted Metal.  Gameplay  Despite the MOBA label, Heavy Metal Machines does not follow the traditional genre mechanics, mainly because it does not have towers, lanes, and minions - which are essential in traditional MOBAs. Another thing that makes HMM stand out from other MOBA games is the speed of the game, where the battles happen with full power in the first few seconds in the match, and there's no need to level up your pilot during the game or build items to destroy your opponents and deliver the bomb. To control the vehicle, the player uses the mouse to accelerate or reverse, and uses the keyboard to fire his weapons. The machine follows the direction your mouse dot is pointing, which is used to turn and to aim your weapons. The objective of the game is to capture and deliver a bomb to the opponent's base. To do so, the player carrying the bomb must go through the whole circuit, with very sharp turns and hazards everywhere, such as lava (lots of damage per second) and Droppers (particular areas that force the character to drop the bomb if he goes through it). Players that are not carrying the bomb may take shortcuts through the course to help or destroy the carrier. These shortcuts are closed to the player carrying the bomb. = Roles = All characters in the game are divided into one of three roles: Interceptor, Support or Transporter. *Interceptor: The Interceptors are specialized in preventing enemies from taking the bomb. They have strong push capacity or good damage. Their goal is to take the bomb from the enemy! *Support: The Supports are focused on helping carriers deliver the bomb by repairing and protecting them while also disrupting the enemy. *Transporter: The Transporters are experts in delivering the bomb to the enemy base. Resistance, speed and agility are some of their skills. = Arenas = In Heavy Metal Machines, the pilots battle for the bomb on three different arenas. * Metal God: Considered the coliseum of Metal City, this arena is the main stage for the HMM's Official Championships. This battlefield is perfect for trying the classic team composition: one Transporter, one Support, and two Interceptors. You must avoid the spots with droppers and trust on the team work. * Temple of Sacrifice: This track was the place for the sacrifices of the heretics from Metal City. Now, it is a place for the most insane combats on HMM, where teams battle to survive different hazards, from Lava pools to a shredder at the end of the course. Temple of Sacrifice is a survival trial: make your team with two supports, one transporter, and one interceptor to make it to the end. * Cursed Necropolis: Sacred land, once it was Windrider's tribe homeland. Nowadays, on this cursed land, acid is all that remains after a carnage. Similar to the Metal God arena on its playability, this track features two different hazards: treadmills change your direction and speed, and the bomb reflectors repel the bomb if you hit them. = In-game currencies = * XP: Completing Metal Pass Missions or just playing the game rewards XP points that go towards the Metal Pass progression on the current season. * Cash: As the paid currency in the game, the player can acquire Cash by purchasing them using real world currencies. The game also rewards the player with small amounts of this currency as part of its Metal Pass rewards. * Fame: It is the easier in-game currency to earn for free and can be earned as a reward from the Metal Pass and from matches.  Pilots  The characters of the game, called Pilots, have their lore and reasons to enter the arena. There are currently 17 characters in the game, and Hoplon - HMM's developer - will introduce new pilots and other contents on every season, which commonly happens every two months. * Artificer * Black Lotus * Clunker * Icebringer * Little Monster * Metal Herald * Rampage * Wildfire * Windrider * Full Metal Judge * Dirt Devil *Stargazer * Stingray * Photon * Killer J *Peacemaker *Vulture  Metal League  The Metal League is an in-game event that creates a tournament based on the teams‚Äô score ranking, with a prize pool of ‚Ç¨5,000 besides items in the game. = Basic Mechanics = This system will work side by side with the Teams feature that's already in the game. Only subscribed teams will be able to take part. The tournaments in this new feature will be disputed in two phases: Qualifiers and Playoffs. To get in the brackets‚Äô stage, the teams will need to score during the Qualifiers. With this feature, the game will get a new exclusive queue that will be available only on Saturdays at specific hours. In other words, get a space on your schedule to play on Saturdays. The Metal League will follow the Metal Pass‚Äô seasons, and the matches will be disputed on specific regions. The first season will roll out only in Europe, and on May the tournaments will also take place on the United States and Brazil servers. = Qualifiers Phase = This phase will happen on Saturdays, more specifically, this Saturday 9th, from 14h to 20h GMT 0. In this first season, there will only be 6 qualifiers steps, and the 8 teams that achieve the highest score will automatically be in the Playoffs Phase of the tournament. = Playoffs Phase = This is the final phase of the Metal League, where the 8 best teams from the qualifiers will fight for the prize money. If you‚Äôve seen the European and South American Championships from 2017, the format will be similar to them. There won't be any queues, and the teams from the brackets will fight in custom matches. Here, the winners will be decided in best of three matches, with single eliminations. = Prizes = The total prize is ‚Ç¨5,000,00, shared between the 4 best teams from the brackets, like this: * 1st place ‚Äì ‚Ç¨2,000,00 * 2nd place ‚Äì ‚Ç¨1,500,00 * 3rd place ‚Äì ‚Ç¨1,000,00 * 4th place ‚Äì ‚Ç¨500,00  Metal Pass  Metal Pass is a system in which Heavy Metal Machines players have access to weekly challenges and in-game rewards, in addition to determining your account‚Äôs progression and Fame income so you can purchase characters and models. Everyone participates automatically ‚Äì and for free ‚Äì in the Metal Pass, and upon overcoming each level, you can unlock rewards associated with it. Each step includes free rewards and, in the Premium version, special rewards themed on the season. The Premium version guarantees you‚Äôll receive the double amount of items per level, as well as making you progress faster through the season. It's obtained with Cash, a currency that can be purchased in the game‚Äôs Store.  Soundtrack  The game has an original soundtrack of heavy metal music. Other than the tracks used on the menus, loading screens and during the matches, each character also has their own track, based on their favorite fictional music style. * Artificer - Techno Classic * Black Lotus - Dharma Metal * Clunker - Redneck Rock * Little Monster - Ultra Heavy Metal * Metal Herald - Ozzyrian Chant * Rampage - Rage‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll * Wildfire - Melting Metalcore * Windrider - Native Folk Rock * Full Metal Judge - Wasteland Rock * Dirt Devil - Corsair Metal * Stingray - D'rude'n'storm * Photon - Progressive Wave * Killer J - Psyclowntic Metal References  External links  *Official website *Press contact *Official Blog *IGN: http://br.ign.com/heavy-metal-machines- pc/30452/news/heavy-metal-machines-era-um-moba-mas-virou-algo-muito-melhor * UOL Jogos: http://jogos.uol.com.br/ultimas-noticias/2016/10/13/uol-mostra-ao- vivo-o-jogo-brasileiro-heavy-metal-machines-as-18h.htm * Adrenaline: http://adrenaline.uol.com.br/2016/09/27/45924/jogamos-heavy-metal-machines- com-os-produtores/ * Titan Games: http://www.titangames.com.br/2016/09/20/nova-fase-do-heavy-metal-machines-vem- turbinada-com-novidades/ * Games Tecmundo: http://games.tecmundo.com.br/noticias/heavy-metal-machines-tem-servidor- reaberto-atualizacao-novidades_825661.htm Windows games Action video games Multiplayer video games 2018 video games Unity (game engine) games Post-apocalyptic video games ","title":"Heavy Metal Machines"},{"id":"52574706","text":"Bennie Carl Elmore High School was a senior high school in Houston, Texas.

He had a long professional partnership with George Him. As a design company, Lewitt-Him brought an innovative use of colour, abstraction and symbolism to commercial design. They established a reputation for fine poster work during World War Two and for exhibition displays, most notably with the Guinness clock for the Festival of Britain. The partnership dissolved in 1955 when Le Witt decided to concentrate upon his own, often abstract, art. Biography A Lewitt-Him safety poster from General Stampers ‚Äì a machine tool factory in Welwyn Garden City Le Witt came from a Jewish family and after leaving school in Czestochowa he spent over three years travelling in Europe and the Middle East. He began work as a self-taught graphic artist and designer, having already had a variety of jobs, such as working in mechanical engineering, in soap manufacturing, in a distillery, as a bricklayer and as an agricultural worker. In 1929 he designed the first Hebrew font \\"Chaim\\" which corresponded to the Latin fonts. In 1930 he presented his work in a solo exhibition in Warsaw. In 1933 he met the graphic artist George Him in a Warsaw caf√© and began a working partnership, which lasted until 1955. Their characteristic style evolved from 'blending surrealist and cubist tendencies with whimsical humour.' Him wrote of their meeting, 'when I met Lewitt ... we discovered that we had almost identical views on graphic design. We were both perfectionists. We also discovered that instead of showering each other with compliments, we could together achieve a much higher level. Although over the years we never quit arguing, the results seem to suggest that ultimately, in this we were not mistaken.'Him, George, Fat Person Singular [exhibition catalog], London, 1976, p.3. In the mid-1930s, the partners were commissioned by Przeworski publishers to design illustrations for three poems that had been written for children by the Polish poet and satiricist, Julian Tuwim. The poems, Lokomotywa (The Locomotive), Rzepka (The Little Turnip) and Ptasie Radio (The Birds' Broadcast), were put into a single book entitled Lokomotywa, (1937) which was later published in English, German and French.Po 44 latach: Jerzy Him w Rozmowie z Erykiem Lipi≈Ñskim‚Äô (‚Äò44 years later: George Him in an Interview with Eryk Lipi≈Ñski‚Äô), Szpilki, 1981, No.1, p.7. Le Witt emigrated to London in 1937 and was naturalised 10 years later. Work produced by the partnership in Poland had been reproduced in foreign publications, such as Gebrauchsgraphik and Arts et M√©tiers Graphiques, and caught the attention of Philip James of the Victoria & Albert Museum in London and the directors of the Lund Humphries publishing company. The two organisations sponsored the partners' move to London; the Victoria & Albert Museum prepared their immigration forms and Lund Humphries put on an exhibition of their graphic work. Upon establishing themselves in London, the Lewitt-Him partnership designed advertising posters for London Transport and Imperial Airways. During World War II, the pair created posters for, amongst others, the Ministry of Information, the General Post Office and the Ministry of Food. They also designed murals for war factory canteens and posters and books for the Polish government in exile and for the Dutch government in exile.8\\\\. Artmonsky, Ruth, Design: Lewitt-Him, Antique Collectors Club, 2008 They also designed the Guinness Festival clock for the Festival of Britain, held in Battersea Park.Sibley, Brian, The Book of Guinness Advertising, Guinness Books, 1985, pp.115‚Äì119. Le Witt gained British citizenship in 1947. He was also a fire warden for Kensington and Chelsea; the London borough in which he lived. While living in London Le Witt became good friends with a circle of artists including Henry Moore, Piero Fornasetti and David Zwemmer, and met and worked with Pablo Picasso on a number of occasions. He also formed a strong friendship with Sir Herbert Read, who wrote the foreword to his monograph and was one of the first critics to recognise his worth as a painter of abstracts based on naturalistic forms. Le Witt married Alina Prusicka in 1939 in London after she also fled Poland before the Second World War. She was the author of many of the children's books that he illustrated. They had one son, Michael Le Witt in 1945. In 1955 Lewitt-Him dissolved as Le Witt wanted to focus on his artistic work as a painter and individual artist. Among many projects, he designed sets and costumes for ballets in Sadler's Wells (1942), most notably the decor and costumes for the Cranko Ballet, Morceaux Enfantin. He also worked in other media such as glass sculpture in Murano and tapestries for Tabard at Aubusson. He had individual and group exhibitions all over Europe and the USA. In Britain he exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery, the Zwemmer Gallery (1947 and 1953) and Tate Britain (1950 and 1952), the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge (1989). Elsewhere, he exhibited at the Musee Grimaldi in Antibes, the Piazza San Marco in Venice and at MOMA in New York.

The India Chapter of the IRF has been active in India since February 2009 and has taken up road safety as its mission alongside its Geneva based parent body, International Road Federation Geneva Programme Centre, which has worked on Indian road safety programs since 2005. Activities The IRF's India Chapter advocates for improved design, maintenance, and management of Indian roads to make them economic, safe, and sustainable. It comprises public and private sector road infrastructure interests. The India Chapter of IRF also works with some entrepreneurs to create examples of best practices in the provision of built- in safety of the highest standards, such as improving the visibility of motorcyclists and pedestrians in traffic. While advocating for a mandatory road safety audit for vehicles, it has supported a mandatory provision of in- vehicle safety devices similar to those in the developed world, and the deployment of appropriate intelligent transportation system devices to assist in enforcement. The organization is funded primarily through member fees. In particular, the India Chapter has advocated for the Indian government to sign the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, which provides international standards for road safety. To that end, the organization, together with the French government and a major Indian automotive organization, also helped develop trauma care and first-aid training for commercial vehicle drivers to assist in road injuries before medical services arrive. =Road safety= India's huge road development program requires road building to be compliant with the highest level of safety. As a consequence, the IRF's India Chapter has garnered support from all related Government and private sector bodies. Particularly, It works closely with the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways to develop solutions for the high number of road fatalities in India. In 2014 the IRF IC launched a major drive to promote the visibility of cyclists. Since its inception, IRF's Indian Chapter has been actively involved in multiple and diverse areas of work relating to road safety issues. The Indian Academy of Highway Engineers, in association with IRF IC and ARBB organized a two-month course on road safety engineering and auditing in mid-2016. During the same year the IRF's India Chapter participated in a conference hosted by the South African Road Federation. Conferences Among its many activities, its annual Conferences on Road Safety themes have attracted global participation and have been lauded for their content and deliberations on strategic issues. Nine IRF Regional Conferences have been organized in India on special themes. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has taken up some of the recommendations of these Conferences, some of which are being implemented in India.

The trilogy consists of the films Before Sunrise (1995), Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013). Filmed and set at nine-year intervals, each film takes place over the course of a few hours. A short sequence in the animated anthology film Waking Life also features the characters. Production Before Sunrise was inspired by a woman whom writer/director Richard Linklater met in a toy shop in Philadelphia in 1989. They walked around the city together, conversing deep into the night. Originally in the screenplay, who the two people were and the city they spend time in was vague. Linklater realized that because the film is so much a dialogue between a man and a woman, it was important to have a strong woman co-writer. He chose Kim Krizan, who had small roles in his two previous films Slacker and Dazed and Confused. According to Linklater, he \\"loved the way her mind worked ‚Äì a constant stream of confident and intelligent ideas\\". Linklater and Krizan talked about the concept of the film and the characters for a long time. He wanted to explore the \\"relationship side of life and discover two people who had complete anonymity and try to find out who they really were\\". He decided to put Jesse and C√©line in a foreign country because \\"when you're traveling, you're much more open to experiences outside your usual realm\\". He and Krizan worked on an outline. They wrote the actual screenplay in 11 days. Linklater spent nine months casting the film because he saw so many people but had trouble finding the right actors for the roles of Jesse and C√©line. When Linklater first considered casting Hawke, he thought that the actor was too young for the part. Linklater saw Hawke at a play in New York City and reconsidered after talking to the actor. For C√©line, Linklater met Julie Delpy and liked her personality. After they did a final reading, Linklater knew that Delpy and Hawke were right for the roles. Once Delpy and Hawke agreed to do the film, they went to Austin and talked with Linklater and Krizan for a few days. In 2016, Delpy told Creative Screenwriting, \\"Ethan and I basically re- wrote all of it. There was an original screenplay, but it wasn't very romantic, believe it or not. It was just a lot of talking, rather than romance. Richard hired us because he knew we were writing and he wanted us to bring that romance to the film. We brought those romantic ideas and that's how I wrote something that actually got made, without really getting credit for it. But, if I had written Before Sunrise and been credited, then I doubt it would have been financed.\\". Though Delpy and Hawke were not credited with writing this film, they received credit for co-writing the sequels. After the filming of Before Sunrise, Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy discussed making a sequel. Linklater considered a version to be filmed in four locations and with a much larger budget. When his proposal did not secure funding, he scaled back the concept of the movie. In a 2010 interview, Hawke said that the three had worked on several potential scripts over the years. As time passed and they did not secure funding, they adapted elements of the earlier scripts for Before Sunrise in their final draft of Before Sunset. Linklater described the process of completing the final version of the film as: Hawke said, \\"It's not like anybody was begging us to make a second film. We obviously did it because we wanted to.\\" The movie was filmed entirely on location in Paris. It opens inside the Shakespeare and Company bookstore on the Left Bank. Other locations include their walking through the Marais district of the 4th arrondissement, Le Pure Caf√© in the 11th arrondissement, the Promenade Plant√©e park in the 12th arrondissement, on board a bateau mouche from Quai de la Tournelle to Quai Henri IV, the interior of a taxi, and finally \\"C√©line's apartment.\\" Described in the film as located at 10 rue des Petites-√âcuries, it was filmed in Cour de l'√âtoile d'Or off rue du Faubourg St-Antoine. The movie was filmed in 15 days, on a budget of about US$2 million. The film is noted for its use of the Steadicam for tracking shots and its use of long takes; the longest of the Steadicam takes lasts about 11 minutes. As the summer was one of the hottest on record, the cast and crew suffered along with the city residents, as temperatures exceeded 100 degrees F (38 ¬∞C) for most of the production. The film is notable for essentially taking place in real time, i.e. the time elapsed in the story is the run time of the film. In the fast-changing temperate Paris climate, this created challenges for the cinematographer Lee Daniel to match the color and intensity of the skies and ambient light from scene to scene. The scenes were mostly shot in sequence, as they were still developing the screenplay. Producer Anne Walker-McBay worked with less time and less money than she had on Before Sunrise, but still brought the film in on time and on budget. The sequel was released nine years after Before Sunrise, the same amount of time that has lapsed in the plot since the events of the first film. The film was released in the wake of Hawke's divorce from Uma Thurman. Some commentators drew parallels between Hawke's personal life and the character of Jesse in the film. Additional comment has noted that both Hawke and Delpy incorporated elements of their own lives into the screenplay. Delpy wrote two of the songs featured in the film, and a third by her was included in the closing credits and movie soundtrack. Richard Linklater, Ethan Hawke, and Julie Delpy had all discussed doing a sequel to Before Sunset (or the third in a trilogy). In November 2011, Hawke said that he, Delpy and Linklater > \\"have been talking a lot in the last six months. All three of us have been > having similar feelings, that we're kind of ready to revisit those > characters. There's nine years between the first two movies and, if we made > the film next summer, it would be nine years again, so we started thinking > that would be a good thing to do. So we're going to try and write it this > year.\\" In June 2012, Hawke confirmed that the sequel to Before Sunset would be filmed that summer. Soon after, Delpy denied filming would take place that year. But by August 2012, numerous reports emerged from Messenia, Greece, that the film was being shot there. The completion of filming the sequel, titled Before Midnight, was announced on September 5, 2012. Linklater said that, after ten weeks of writing and rehearsing, the film was made in fifteen days for less than $3 million. He intended to take it to a film festival in early 2013. Films = Before Sunrise = Before Sunrise, the first film in the trilogy, is set in a single night in Vienna, Austria.

The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 100% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 43 reviews, with an average rating of 8.32/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"Thought- provoking and beautifully filmed, Before Sunrise is an intelligent, unabashedly romantic look at modern love, led by marvelously natural performances from Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 77 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F. Film critic Roger Ebert gave Before Sunrise three out of four stars and described Julie Delpy as \\"ravishingly beautiful and, more important, warm and matter-of-fact, speaking English so well the screenplay has to explain it (she spent some time in the States)\\". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, \\"Before Sunrise is as uneven as any marathon conversation might be, combining colorful, disarming insights with periodic lulls. The film maker clearly wants things this way, with both these young characters trying on ideas and attitudes as if they were new clothes\\". Hal Hinson, in his review for The Washington Post wrote, \\"Before Sunrise is not a big movie, or one with big ideas, but it is a cut above the banal twentysomething love stories you usually see at the movies. This one, at least, treats young people as real people\\". Before Sunset received wide acclaim from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes it hold an approval rating of 95% based on 174 reviews, with an average rating of 8.31/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"Filled with engaging dialogue, Before Sunset is a witty, poignant romance, with natural chemistry between Hawke and Delpy.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 90 out of 100 based on 39 reviews from mainstream publications, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\".

In comparing this film to the first, American film critic Roger Ebert wrote, \\"Before Sunrise was a remarkable celebration of the fascination of good dialogue. But Before Sunset is better, perhaps because the characters are older and wiser, perhaps because they have more to lose (or win), and perhaps because Hawke and Delpy wrote the dialogue themselves.\\" In her review for the Los Angeles Times, Manohla Dargis lauded the film as a \\"deeper, truer work of art than the first,\\" and praised director Linklater for making a film that \\"keeps faith with American cinema at its finest.\\" Before Midnight also received widespread critical acclaim. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 98% based on reviews from 189 critics, with an average rating of 8.7/10.

It was listed as the third-best film of the year after 12 Years a Slave and Gravity. It was the second-best reviewed film of 2013 according to Rotten Tomatoes, after Alfonso Cuar√≥n's Gravity. According to Total Film's Philip Kemp, > \\"As with its two predecessors ‚Äî and with the films of French New Wave > director √âric Rohmer, presiding deity of this kind of cinema‚ÄîMidnight's > essentially a film about people talking. But when the talk's this good, this > absorbing and revealing and witty and true, who's going to complain?... > [It's a] more-than-worthy, expectation-exceeding chapter in one of modern > cinema's finest love stories. As honest, convincing, funny, intimate and > natural as its predecessors.\\" Perry Seibert of AllMovie also praised the film, writing: \\"The screenwriting trio fill the movie with long, discursive conversations (there are only two scenes in the first 20 minutes) that feel utterly improvised when they are performed, but are far too deftly structured to be anything other than the work of consummate artists.\\"Seibert, Perry. \\"Before Midnight (2013)\\". allmovie.com.

Personal anecdote  = Prefer death to surrender. = Rong Desheng's way of establishing oneself and running a family is Confucius' Confucian saying that \\"to establish oneself means to establish others, and to achieve success means to achieve success\\". Mr. Wing Tak Sang said, \\"The words and deeds of ancient sages are nothing more than the virtues of the University, and the sincerity, integrity and moral cultivation in the Doctrine of the Mean will lead to the governance of the country and the peace of the world. It is also true that sages must first be sincere, seek truth from facts and achieve common success.\\" He believed that in order to increase productivity, in addition to adding new equipment and improving operating techniques, we should start from \\"human\\", strengthen personnel management, and regard human as the first element of productivity. He said, \\"If I run a factory and hire people who are not experts, if I am sincere, if I am not strict with them, if I am virtuous, if I care about my family and my children, and if I do not worry about my work, then my autonomy is effective. Confidence can teach the scope of the factory imitation. He adhered to the ideological principle of \\"persuading people by virtue\\", and it really worked. \\"This is good for the maoxin factories, good for the Fuxin factories and bad for the Shenxin factories.\\" (the mining farming custom XingNian chronicle) this application with people, good for repaid management thinking to arouse the enthusiasm of people, coordination between managers and by managers and by managers within the relationship, form a power concentrated group of producers, and general with simple improvement methods to improve the practice of labor productivity, is can't match.

In ancient Egypt wine was preferred by the upper class, whereas beer was a staple for working class Egyptians and a central part of their diet. Despite religious restrictions and conflicting views on alcohol after the Muslim conquest of Egypt, the consumption of beer did not cease, and it still remains the most popular alcoholic beverage in the country by far, accounting for 54 percent of all alcohol consumption. History The modern beer industry in Egypt was founded by Belgian businessmen in 1897, with the establishment of Crown Brewery in Alexandria and later the Pyramid Brewery in Cairo. Both breweries produced and sold a beer named Stella, each based on completely different recipes. In 1937 Heineken International became a major shareholder in both breweries. This acquisition coincided with growing nationalist sentiment and a political drive for increased native involvement in businesses, or Egyptianization. Under Heineken's ownership Pyramid Brewery took on the Arabized name Al Ahram Brewery. In 1963 the companies were consolidated under the name Al Ahram Beverages Company (ABC), after being nationalized by the socialist government of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. The Stella brand was unified under government ownership and continued to be mass-produced. In 1997 the government sold the company to Egyptian businessman Ahmad Zayat who restructured it and introduced a line of non- alcoholic beverages to the company's portfolio. It was acquired once again by Heineken International in 2002. Stella remains by far the most popular beer in Egypt, with 47.5 million liters sold in 2016 (equivalent to a third of Egypt's total beer consumption), and ABC, which markets Stella as well as non- alcoholic Birell (the second most popular beer in Egypt), controls 89 percent of Egypt's beer market. Today the company produces a variety of local and international brands of beer, including Heineken, Desperados and the iconic Stella. In 2012 the company made $300 million in profit from beer sales alone. It is one of two major breweries in the country, the other being the Egyptian International Beverage Company (known as Egybev) owned by Wadi Group and Egyptian businessman Samih Sawiris. Non-alcoholic beers, like the aforementioned Birell and fruit-flavored Fayrouz, are very popular in Egypt, as observant Muslims tend to avoid the consumption of alcohol due to religious restrictions. Flavored alcoholic beers have also become trendy since the successful launch of tequila-flavored Desperados in 2016. ABC followed up with the launch of several fruit-flavored versions of their high-strength Meister Max brand, later in 2016, and other companies have since followed suit. These flavored beers are particularly popular with younger Egyptians. Local varieties A beer type known as bouza (), based on barley and bread, has been consumed in Egypt since beer first made its appearance in the country, possibly as early as the Predynastic era. Despite sharing names with boza, a nonalcoholic beverage consumed in Turkey and the Balkans, it is not the same beverage. Bouza, and beer in general, was referred to as mizr in Egypt, and also keshkab, during the Middle Ages. The latter specifically refers to bouza that used mint, lemon leaves, nigella, pepper or rue as gruit, historically consumed in the coastal provinces of Egypt. The beverage is traditionally homebrewed, following a 5,000 year-old method of preparation that closely resembles depictions of beer-brewing on ancient Egyptian murals. The alcohol content of bouza can reach up to 7%, depending on how long it is left to ferment. It is often associated with the working class and is seen as an inexpensive alternative to commercial beer.
