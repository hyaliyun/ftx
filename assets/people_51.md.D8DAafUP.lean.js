It is an erect, mostly glabrous shrub with pinnate leaves with up to seven leaflets, and white, four-petalled flowers with blue or pale green backs. Description Boronia ramosa is a slender, erect, mostly glabrous, woody shrub which grows to a height of . The leaves are pinnate, long and have between three and seven leaflets on a petiole long. The leaflets are long. There are up to three flowers arranged in the leaf axils on pedicels long. The four sepals are thick, glabrous and egg- shaped, long. The petals are white with blue or pale green backs, broadly elliptic, long and prominently glandular. Flowering occurs from May to October. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1839 by John Lindley who gave it the name Cyanothamnus ramosus and published the description in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. In 1863, George Bentham changed the name to Boronia ramosa. The specific epithet (ramosa) is a Latin word meaning \\"full of branches\\". In 1971 and 1998, Paul Wilson described three subspecies that have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Boronia ramosa subsp. anethifolia (Bartl.) Paul G.Wilson (previously Boronia ramosa var. anethifolia (Bartl.) Benth.) has pedicels that are long and shorter than the leaves, with cylindrical leaflets that are channelled on the upper surface; * Boronia ramosa subsp. lesueurana Paul G.Wilson has pedicels that are long and shorter than the leaves, with linear to narrow oblong leaflets that are concave on the upper surface; * Boronia ramosa (Lindl.) Benth. subsp. ramosa has pedicels that are long and longer than the leaves. Distribution and habitat This boronia grows on slopes and hillsides, sometimes in disused gravel pits and is widespread in the southwest from near Shark Bay to near Esperance. Subspecies anethifolia occurs between the Murchison River, the Stirling Range and Cape Le Grand, subspecies lesueurana is only known from near Mt Lesueur and subspecies ramosa mainly from the Darling Range.

A number of these are historic quarries listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), ranging from relatively ancient archeological sites to places having pre-World War II activity. This includes major areas of continuing, modern quarrying. According to Marble.com, in 2016 there were 276 quarries producing natural stone in 34 states, and states producing the most granite were Texas, Massachusetts, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Georgia. The term \\"quarry\\" refers also to sites producing aggregate, molding sand, or other resources besides cut stone. There were numerous more quarries in the U.S. during the 1800s and 1900s than are operational now. In Oregon, a state with much less activity than Vermont and other bigger quarrying states, there were more than 250 quarries operational at one time or another. In 1906 the state mineralogist of California reported on 52 granite quarrying areas in 17 counties.. Derived from \\"The Structural and Industrial Materials of California\\", Bulletin No. 38, by Lewis E. Auburn, State Mineralogist, San Francisco, California, 1906 Many quarries were opened temporarily to provide stone for one or a few local or regional construction projects, but could not compete later when railroads allowed for economical transportation of heavy building materials to the area. Quarrying spurred the construction of railways and vice versa, from the 1826 construction of the Granite Railway in Massachusetts to the modern day.

Career In January 1967, Reading signed Smee from Chelsea, where he had played in the youth set-up. On 3 March 1967, Smee scored on his Reading debut in a 2–0 win against Shrewsbury Town. Smee scored nine goals in 15 appearances in the 1966–67 season following his transfer. Following suffering a broken leg, Smee was deemed surplus to requirements by manager Jack Mansell and dropped down to Non-League football, playing for Chelmsford City, Hillingdon Borough and Hereford United. In 1972, Smee signed for Belgian club VG Oostende, before moving back to Reading, where he made nine further Football League appearances, scoring once. Post-playing career Following his playing career, Smee moved into business. In May 1983, Oxford United chairman Robert Maxwell announced his intention to acquire a majority shareholding in Reading and merge Reading and Oxford into a club named Thames Valley Royals. Smee and Reading director Roy Tranter opposed such a merger and stopped Maxwell's plans following a boardroom vote at Reading between the Maxwell merger offer and a rival bid headed by Smee. In July 1983, Smee became chairman of Reading. During Smee's time as chairman, Reading reached Wembley for the first time, winning the 1988 Full Members' Cup Final as well as gaining promotion from the Fourth Division in 1983–84, winning the Third Division in 1985–86 and achieving the club's highest finish in 1987. In 1990, Smee was replaced as Reading chairman by John Madejski, as a result of the early 1990s recession. In 2013, Smee was awarded an MBE for his work with young people in Berkshire.

The mountain is situated in Chelan County, on land managed by Wenatchee National Forest. Its nearest higher peak is Devore Peak, to the south-southwest, and Bonanza Peak lies to the southwest. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains to nearby Lake Chelan via tributaries of the Stehekin River. The mountain's name comes from Chinook jargon and means \\"needle\\". Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The North Cascades feature some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is southwest of Tupshin Peak, began forming in the mid- Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Morgan was notable as one of only a handful of Welshmen to join the Jacobite rising of 1745, during which he briefly served in Lord Elcho's 'Life Guards' and helped raise the Manchester Regiment. Unwilling to retreat to Scotland with the rest of the Jacobite Army, he was arrested by the government near Stone, Staffordshire, tried and executed in July 1746. Life Remains of buildings at Penygraig, once owned by Morgan's family. In the late 19th century a window here was still pointed out as the \\"Counsellor's Room\\". Morgan was born about 1695, probably in Glamorganshire.Williams, D (1959) “Morgan, David Thomas, ‘’Dictionary of Welsh Biography’’ His family were of the small gentry class but were considered fairly well-connected; his father, Thomas Morgan, was the second son of landowner William Morgan of Coed- y-Gores and his mother Dorothy was the granddaughter of a baronet, Sir Edmund Stradling. On his mother's side Morgan was the first cousin of Admiral Thomas Mathews.Llewellin, William. “David Morgan, the Welsh Jacobite” in The Cambrian Journal, 1861, p.331 Details of Morgan's early life are obscure; he attended Christ Church, Oxford though did not graduate. He trained in law and was called to the bar in 1721 at the Middle Temple but although said to have been well known at Westminster, he seems to have spent much of his time at his father's estate of Penygraig, near present-day Edwardsville, Merthyr Tydfil. While some of his surviving poetry suggests he practised actively as a barrister on the Welsh circuit, he later claimed to have “never pretended to much knowledge that way”. He may have spent some time as an officer in the British Army; at his trial he said that he had “served the crown of England in two campaigns with some reputation”. Much of his income seems to have come from valuable leasehold property in Shoreditch that he acquired through his marriage.Llewellin (1861) p.332 Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn of Wynnstay, Denbighshire, was the senior Welsh Jacobite; unlike Morgan he failed to commit to the 1745 rising During the early part of the 18th century a number of Welsh gentry continued to support the claims of the exiled Stuarts. The most senior Welsh Jacobite was the powerful Tory landowner and MP Sir Watkin Williams- Wynn, 3rd Baronet; Wynn had indicated his support for a Stuart restoration on condition it was backed by French military support. His political club, the ‘Cycle of the White Rose’, was a focus for Jacobite activity in North Wales; a comparable role in South Wales was filled by the ‘Sea Serjeants’, led by Sir John Philipps. Morgan himself was a friend of both Wynn and Philipps: he was closely associated with the circle of the Duke of Beaufort, another Tory with Jacobite sympathies, and was a prominent member of the “Independent Electors of Westminster”, a pro-Jacobite London club. He published several poems dealing with Jacobite themes, notably The Country Bard (1739). 1745 Rising At the time the Stuart heir Charles Edward Stuart landed in Scotland in late July 1745, he was partly relying on French intelligence from 1743 that had suggested he would find strong support in Wales. While there is evidence of some latent support during 1745, the majority of the Welsh Tory gentry were horrified by the turn events had taken, which seemed to presage a bloody civil war rather than a Stuart restoration on the terms they had hoped for.Jenkins (2002) p.174 Viewing the Rising primarily as a Scottish internal conflict, they felt Charles had aligned himself with “alien and barbarous Highlanders, rather than [...] a British political faction”. While Wynn was subjected to intense government scrutiny, he did no more than send the Jacobites equivocal verbal messages of support; in the event Morgan, along with the Catholic William Vaughan of Courtfield and his brother Richard, was one of the few Welshmen of the property owning class to join the Rising. Morgan's own motives for joining appear to have been at least partly ideological, although he later admitted in a letter he might not have got involved had his \\"personal Affairs been more to [his] Liking\\". His surviving poetry and other writings focus on core High Tory themes such as indefeasible dynastic right, a ‘country’ attack on high taxation and on the standing army, while like many other senior Jacobites he was a 'High Church' nonjuring Anglican. By tradition Morgan is supposed to have heard the news of Charles's landing through members of Philipps’ ‘Sea Serjeants’. He left Penygraig in early November and rode to Spetchley Park, Worcestershire, where he met William Vaughan; under the cover of a shooting trip, they travelled to northern England and along with Francis Towneley, a Lancashire Catholic, met the advancing Jacobite army near Preston on 27 November.Price, J. Arthur. \\"Side Lights on Welsh Jacobitism\\", Y Cymmrodor, 14 (1901), p.144 At Manchester, around 200 English Jacobite volunteers were formed into the Manchester Regiment; while Morgan's Anglicanism and links with Beaufort made him a politically expedient candidate for colonel, the position was given to Towneley. Morgan was instead commissioned captain and was given responsibility for selection of the regiment's junior officers.Oates, J. \\"The Manchester Regiment of 1745\\" in Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Vol. 88, No. 354 (Summer 2010), pp.131-2 He is also sometimes described as having been appointed as Charles's \\"counsellor\\" or legal advisor, but he denied this at his trial and seems to have served in a purely military capacity. One of his main duties was to organise the Jacobites' search for weapons. Contrary to Charles's assurances, very few English recruits joined on the march towards London and at Derby on 5 December the Jacobite Council of War voted overwhelmingly to return and consolidate their position in Scotland. They debated and rejected the option of heading for Wales: a further message had been sent to Wynn as it was felt that the propaganda value of him joining would be high even if he brought no recruits, but the messenger was intercepted. Like Charles himself, Morgan felt the Council's decision had destroyed their best chance of success: he told Sir John MacDonald that \\"all was lost\\" and said to Vaughan that he would “rather be hanged than go to Scotland to starve”.Llewellin, p.310 While Vaughan stayed, Morgan left the army on the evening of 7 December at Ashbourne and headed southwards with a guide; he was arrested by government forces near Stone, Staffordshire.Llewellin, p.316 The Jacobites continued northwards to Carlisle, where Towneley and the majority of the Manchester Regiment were left behind as a garrison; after a short siege they surrendered to Cumberland's government army on 30 December. Vaughan continued north with the main Jacobite force: after the Rising ended at Culloden in April 1746, he escaped the country. Trial and execution Held at Newgate Prison along with other senior Jacobites, Morgan was eventually brought to trial on 18 July 1746; despite a “lengthy and ingenious defence” he was found guilty of treason and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered.Llewellin, p.317 He was executed on 30 July at Kennington Common alongside Towneley and several other officers of the Manchester Regiment. Morgan seemed unconcerned by his fate: several accounts noted him angrily complaining about the coffee the prisoners were served shortly before being taken to execution. At the scaffold he led the others in prayer for about thirty minutes and distributed copies of his dying speech. As with Towneley, Morgan's speech unapologetically restated 'Country party' or 'patriot' ideals, attacking the Hanoverians' \\"ungrateful avarice\\" and labelling them as foreign usurpers, arguing that \\"a lawful king is a nursing father who would protect us\\".Monod (1993) p.336 After the execution his remains were probably buried in the burying ground attached to the Foundling Hospital, now St George's Gardens, Bloomsbury. Legacy While Wynn continued his covert activities, and the Welsh Jacobite clubs lingered into the 19th century, Morgan's death and the inaction of Welsh Tories effectively signalled the end of Welsh Jacobitism. Nevertheless, like Towneley, Morgan for a time became a figure of inspiration for Jacobites elsewhere in Britain; his execution reinvigorated the Independent Electors of Westminster, of which he had been a member, and contributed to a rise in Jacobite activities after 1745.Monod (1993) p.340 Memories of figures such as Morgan and David Jenkins influenced later historians in assuming the rural Welsh gentry to have been ultra-royalists or \\"fanatical tories\\", even though this view was largely a \\"myth\\".Jenkins (2002) p.136 Morgan also attracted some interest from the Welsh “Celticist” nationalists of Cymru Fydd: in 1901 the magazine Young Wales published a poem by W. Llewelyn Williams in which Morgan, awaiting execution, laments his cause's betrayal by Wynn and the other Welsh gentry to the “shame [of] / Our gallant country”. Another nationalist writer, Arthur Owen Vaughan or \\"Owen Rhoscomyl\\", used Morgan's story as the basis for an 1897 historical novel, For the White Rose of Arno. Family Morgan was married; his wife was reported to have visited him regularly during his imprisonment. They had at least one daughter, Mary, who later inherited Morgan's properties and died unmarried prior to 1798.Llewelin, p.333 References 1690s births 1746 deaths Welsh Jacobites People of the Jacobite rising of 1745 People from Glamorgan Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford Members of the Middle Temple ","title":"David Morgan (Jacobite)"},{"id":"60548267","text":"Henrietta Pettway (1894–1971) was an American artist.

Her work is included in the collection of the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Milwaukee Art Museum.  Life  The daughter of accomplished quilter America Irby, and granddaughter of Hannah Wilcox, Mensie Lee Pettway grew up with much communal support. She farmed most of her life and went to school during the off season (November–February). She completed high school at 21 years old. Afterwards, she married Robert Lee Pettway, farmed with him, and raised seven children. Mensie Lee was a resourceful and tireless worker. She enjoyed picking cotton and after helping her family harvest their own, she would go to a white family's house, the Joe McHugh family, and pick 200 pounds of cotton in one day. She recalls, \\"I loved cooking and pulling cotton. I could pull two hundred pounds in a day. You get three dollars a hundred back then. That was a lot of money around 1958 when I was in the tenth grade.\\" Mensie Lee still lives in Alberta, Alabama.  Work  Mensie Lee was one of the founding members of the Freedom Quilting Bee when it was first established at Estelle Witherspoon's house. Her primary job was cutting patterns for other members to sew. She could cut three or four patterns in one day, and often helped other women sew the patterns to keep up with demands. Her grandmother, Hannah Wilcox, would top and quilt the patterns. She worked at the Bee during its entire existence. Even after Mensie Lee returned home from the Bee at the end of the day, she would work on her own quilts. More free-form and improvisational, her patterns began as \\"Nine Patch\\" quilts, but morphed during the process into, what the artist deemed, \\"This and That\\" patchwork. She described her method: > \\"I may start off looking like planning a \\"Nine Patch,\\" but then I take this, > take that, take patches, blocks, strips, and seeing where I am going, laying > my pattern as I go. I start out with about an eighteen-inch block. That > block give you a start with the color and design. I may put that block at > the end or in the middle, and then I may go around it and keep going around > until it got big enough. Sometime I may make a bunch of blocks and put them > together. Sometime I may start it at the bottom and go up like a stepladder. > But not ever the same way twice.\\" Her method yielded quilts with finger-print uniqueness, where no two quilts, or even two sides of the same quilt, looked alike.

These identifications are postulated from the names of settlements in San Fernando Mission records. These settlements were systematically depopulated by Spanish missionaries between 1802 and 1805 as the traditional inhabitants were relocated to Spanish missions.Chester King, Ethnographic Overview of the Los Padres National Forest: Tataviam and San Gabriel Mountain Ethnohistory (2004) Cienaga Ranch Heinrich (Henry) Edward Woest was born on 9 April 1872 in Manhattan, New York City.New York City Births, 1846-1909, Heinrich Woest, 09 April 1872; citing Manhattan, New York, New York, United States, reference cn 87501 New York Municipal Archives, New York; FHL microfilm 1,322,050 In early adulthood, Henry accompanied his mother to California after her husband, Heinrich Woest, died in 1875. As a young adult, Henry Woest acquired the land holding under the 1862 Homestead Act with private ownership transferred to him on 30 August 1904. The property was defined as the northeast quarter (160 acres) of Section 22 of Township 7 North, Range 17 West, San Bernardino Meridian. Henry was a commercial bee keeper who, in the early 1900s, was managing 130 colonies of bees which produced tons of honey every yearGleanings in Bee Culture, Volume 32, 1 May 1904 Henry used three donkeys to haul lumber to the property to built a ranch house that is still standing but now in ruins. The property was originally called the Cienaga Ranch named after Cienaga Canyon in which the ranch was located. The name, Cienaga Canyon, appeared on USGS maps as early as 1903 at the time of the granting of the land patent. Henry was the half-brother of Annie Rose Briggs whom she called \\"Eddie\\". They partnered in efforts to locate lost 19th-century gold mines believed to be in the immediate area of the Cienaga Ranch. Kelly Ranch A man named Kelly bought the Cienaga Ranch in the mid-1920s and it was subsequently known as the Kelly Ranch for several decades.Annie Rose Briggs unpublished autobiography, The Lost Padre Mine, 1956 Very little is known about the ranch or the people involved during the Kelly era of ownership. The name \\"Kelly Ranch\\" first appeared on a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) map that was surveyed in 1930.USGS map of Redrock Mountain, reference 294606, surveyed in 1930 and published in 1931 A 1931 USGS map shows an \\"Emergency Airplane Landing Field\\" located on the Kelly Ranch however this feature was not included on later maps. A regular visitor to the Kelly Ranch as a teenager, David Wasdahl, remembers that a family named Pearce or Pierce were managing or caretaking the ranch in the late 1930s. Tom Benz (Benco Mine) said: \\"The care takers of the Kelly Ranch was Coronal Shaffer and his sister. My dad knew him from church and he gave us his pet goat which we had in Plum Canyon.\\" The family sold the property in 1962 after Kelly died. Jon Meyer, a regular visitor to the Knapp ranch in the 1960s, recalls: \\"When I asked Frank Knapp how he found the Kelly Ranch...he said he did some stone and rock work for the family back in the day.....and acquired it from 'Grandma Kelly'.....no one in the Kelly family wanted to keep it.\\" Knapp Ranch In 1962, Frank John Knapp, Jr. (1900 - 1990) and his brother, Alfonso Alfred Knapp (1902 - 1968), bought the ranch property as equal partners from the Kelly family. According to the part-time foreman at Knapp Ranch, Ronald T. Abramchuk (nickname \\"Black Bart\\"), the brothers planned to turn the ranch into a hunting lodge. When Alfonso died unexpectedly a few years later in 1968, Frank bought his partner's half share for $40,000 and became the sole owner of the Knapp Ranch.

Franz Knapp first came to the USA from Austria with his family in June 1903. They sailed on the \\"SS Finland\\" from Antwerp on 6 June 1903 and arrived in the port of New York on 16 June 1903. The \\"SS Finland\\" was an American-flagged, ocean liner built in 1902 for the Red Star Line. Franz Knapp Sr. remained in American while his wife, Maria Johanna Meixer Knapp (1878 - 1949), returned to Austria with their three young children.....their eldest daughter, Hedwig, and two sons, Frank Jr. and Alfonzo. They were to return to the US again about a year later aboard the SS Zeeland sailing from Antwerp on 30th July 1904 and arriving in the USA on 9th August 1904. Johanna once again returned to Austria with their three young children. In 1910, they returned to remain permanently in America aboard the SS Frankfurt sailing from Bremen on 20 October 1910. Owensmouth Frank Knapp's father, Franz (\\"Frank\\") John Knapp Sr. walked across the country from Derry, Pennsylvania, and settled in Owensmouth, California, around 1911. He became a naturalized US citizen in 1913. Owensmouth was a rural area in the San Fernando Valley annexed into the city of Los Angeles in 1915. Owensmouth was re-named Canoga Park in 1931. Knapp Snr. built one of the first houses in the area completed in 1912 (located at Owensmouth Avenue and Cohasset Street). It was later demolished in 1926. In 1925, Frank Knapp Snr. built a new family home on Owensmouth Avenue (between Sherman Way and Saticoy) featuring elaborate rock work constructed in the style of historic castles from his home country in Europe. Knapp senior was a skilled stone mason. \\"The front and back yards were filled with Knapp's artistic masonry including jolly monks, a sundial, detailed nativity shrines, and an eight-foot-winged cement butterfly inlaid with colorful tiles.\\">Valley- Bred Cowboy: Frank Knapp a Canoga Park Pioneer, by Sally O'Toole, Big Valley magazine, August 1980 The locals referred to it as \\"Knapp Castle\\". The building was severely damaged by the 1994 Northridge earthquake and was demolished.

Some records indicate a Swiss heritage but that was a cover to deflect possible anti-German sentiment. Wife On 16 October 1922, 21-year old Frank Knapp married 18-year old Florindia \\"Toots\\" Olive (16 October 1904 - 13 November 1980). She was of Portuguese ancestry, the daughter of Manuel Olive (1879-1961) and Mary \\"Mamie\\" Quaresma (1883-1941). Frank and Florindia had one child, Edwin (\\"Eddie\\") Frank Knapp (1923-1944) who was killed in action during WWII. Only son Edwin F. Knapp enlisted on 16th March 1943 in Santa Ana as an Aviation Cadet in the Air Corps. Eddie achieved the rank of Second Lieutenant (service number 763643). George Raino: \\"Frank had one son, who was a mustang pilot in WW2. Frank's son was shot down in 1944, over Frank's hometown in Austria. Frank really took that hard, and divorced his wife on that, since she had encouraged the kid to enlist, and Frank was vehemently opposed.\\" Dry Gulch Ranch In 1943, Frank Knapp purchased the Johnson Ranch where years earlier he had helped to bail hay as a youngster in 1913 for a dollar a day.The Los Angeles Times, 23 March 1958, section 8, page 1 Frank commented: \\"In those days there was no relief. If you didn't work, you didn't eat.\\" He called his new 170-acre property the Dry Gulch Ranch for which he paid $9,500 and paid $75 a year in taxes. It was located west of present-day Valley Circle Boulevard and Kittridge Street in Canoga Park. Ken Hayden (close friend): \\"His favorite hunting area was actually the Bell Canyon area near Dry Gulch Ranch in Canoga.\\" Ken Hayden: \\"Frank made his fortune digging cesspools by hand and lining them with brick. He invested as much of his money in property as possible. I remember seeing the tripod/winch he used to excavate and load bricks bucket by bucket for the cesspools he built.\\" Jeff Stalk (journalist): \\"While digging for water on his ranch in Canoga Park, he struck oil. Geologists investigating the find told Knapp the stones he had pulled out of the well were fossilized whale bones. He sold the oil but still has the bones.\\"Deep in the Forest Lives an Antiquarian Extraordinaire by Jeff Stalk, The Newhall Signal and Saugus Enterprise, 29 June 1980The Los Angeles Times, 27 February 1947, page 7The Los Angeles Times, 16 March 1947, page 13The Newhall Signal and Saugus Enterprise, 10 April 1947, page 7 Frank kept a pair of live buffalo at Dry Gulch Ranch which he acquired in a barter exchange for three of his cows.

He then took that money and bought the Kelly Ranch.\\" Knapp Ranch Park In 1961, Frank Knapp sold 57.6 acres of his property to the local city-council for $230,000 priced below its market value.The Los Angeles Times, 26 November 1963, section 2, page 9 The land was to be used for the development of a public park named in honor of his son killed in action in WWII. The park was dedicated on 11 April 1968 The Los Angeles Times, 8 March 1968, page 9 A plaque on public display bears the inscription: \\"Knapp Park - Named in memory of Edwin Frank Knapp, 1923-1944\\" (installed by Canoga Park Kawanis Club 1963). Horse Meadows When asked to describe his daily life, Knapp replied: \\"I guess you could call it the life of Riley. I do what I please.\\"The Los Angeles Times, 23 March 1958, section 8, page 7 Every year, Frank spent one or two months hunting and fishing at Horse Meadows in a remote area in the southern Sierras to the north west of Roads End on the upper Kern River. There were no roads and you had to bring in supplies using pack horses. Frank would go with various companions, including Frank Dalton (1873 - 1949) and Earl V. Pascoe (1901 - 1994). Frank would also take he teenage son, Edwin, on these expeditions.The Bakersfield Californian, 11 July 1936, page 5The Bakersfield Californian, 6th October 1949, age 24 Frank built a substantial rock-walled cabin in Horse Meadows some time before 1930.North Fork Country by Bob Powers, 1974 (includes photo) Jon Meyer, said: \\"Frank loved the high country and built a cabin at Horse Meadow and would spend weeks at a time there, shooting deer, drinking, and playing cards. Frank also had some sort of mining claim up in Horse Meadow.\\" Move Ken Hayden (friend): \\"Our Dad, Charles Hayden helped move Frank to his Gorman ranch from Dry Gulch Ranch (in Canoga Park), starting in 1960. Our Dad had a couple of dump trucks and a skip loader with a trailer. It was a long trek up there back then. I remember Frank telling my Dad that he had to get out of the Valley because there were just too many people there now.\\" Animals As with his earlier Dry Gulch Ranch, Frank kept a menagerie of animals on the Knapp Ranch for what he called \\"atmosphere\\". Ingrid Burgess, a visitor at Knapp Ranch, wrote: \\"Frank had a doe that he got as a fawn. The rangers didn't object to him having it, may have even given it to him. It was sick and had diarrhea and \\"Diarrhea\\" became the doe's name. It would freely saunter into the house and loved to eat cigarette butts and jelly beans. \\"Diarrhea\\" had a son named \\"Pete\\", a second offspring was named \\"Repeat\\". \\"Pete\\" or \\"Repeat\\" once reared up against my daughter and pinned her against the house. Catherine still talks about this as the scariest experience in her life.\\" The pet deer were safeguarded during the annual hunting season. Knapp purchased buffalo from relatives of the late Walt Disney. The bull and three cows he purchased were related to stock at Hart Park owned by the silent film star William S. Hart.The Newhall Signal and Saugus Enterprise, 16 March 1973, page 10. Ken Hayden: \\"Frank used to catch rattle snakes for UCLA and kept them in a 55 gallon drum in a bed of hay with a heavy wire grate on top weighted down with a couple of concrete blocks, until his favorite horse flipped of the lid and started eating the hay. The horse got bit on the face, so that ended the rattle snake program.\\" Tom Benz: \\"Frank would say you can go through my ranch but you better stop and have a couple of beers before you leave. We did, one night I saw a man who just got out of the hospital, he still had the hospital bracelet on his wrist and he could barely stand up he was so drunk. They did party hearty there back in the 1980's. Frank drank his beer with tomato juice and played poker.\\" Frank Knapp routinely drank \\"red beer\\" by mixing in tomato juice or V8 juice. To spice it up a bit, he sometimes added Snap E Tom (which is tomato juice and chile). Ken Hayden: \\"He also had an out building filled with Indian artifacts that he had collected from around the area while exploring and hunting on horseback.\\" Jeff Stalk (journalist): \\"Knapp has amassed one of the most extensive collections of Chumash and Alliklik (Tataviam) Indian artifacts to be found anywhere. His ranch house is a veritable museum filled with mortars and pestles, stone bowls, flint knives, arrow heads, beads, and other trinkets. Outside, in a nearby shed, milling stones are to be found along with the complete skeletal remains of an Indian.\\" Gillette Mine Frank Knapp constructed the barbecue area at the Gillette Ranch in 1928 or 1929 featuring his stonework. In the early 1920s, Frank Knapp had helped King Gillette, the son of King Camp Gillette of razor-blade fame, in his prospecting efforts in Bear Canyon in partnership with Annie Rose Briggs. Gillette financed the digging of a substantial tunnel that became known as the \\"Gillette Mine\\" in an attempt to intersect an old \\"Spanish\\" shaft or hidden storage vault. The endeavor failed to find anything. Years later, Frank Knapp along with two of his younger brothers decided to continue digging the Gillette shaft from where the original team had stopped tunneling. Their point of entry was about 50 feet or so before Gillette's tunnel had ended. They dug down from above in order to enter the tunnel through the roof but found it filled with water. Working around the clock, the three brothers took turns to pump out the flooded void by hand. Eventually they had expelled enough water to wade to the end of the tunnel in waist-deep water. They found old bottles floating around, a stack of shoring timbers, and a drilling rod stuck in the rock face at the end of the tunnel. The Knapp brothers planned to continue pumping out the water and go back in the next day. However, the tunnel collapsed during the night. They decided to leave well enough alone and dynamited their point of entry shut. In the late 1970s, the forestry covered over the entrance to the mine leaving nothing of the old workings that can be recognized today. Nature, periodic flooding, and time have obliterated all evidence of its existence.History of the Los Padres Mine, Peter C. Gray, Agua Dulce / Acton Country Journal, Volume XXVII, 14 installments published between 25 March 2017 and 24 June 2017 National Forest George Raino described the fate of the ranch after Frank passed away: \\"The ranch was then sold by the nephews and nieces to an organization called Friends of the Forest bankrolled by Rosie Greer, who had a ranch over by Lake Hughes, for a price of around $400,000. Rosie Greer then swapped the ranch to the forest service for 200 acres of forest service land that abuts their ranch over in the Lake Hughes / Elizabeth Lake area.\\"  References  Ranches in California ","title":"Knapp Ranch, California"},{"id":"60548754","text":"Magalene Wilson (1898–2001), also known as Magdalene Wilson, was an American artist.

History Before the First World War, the doctrine of the French Army was geared towards a war of rapid maneuver. Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service and once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in the light field guns that the combatants went to war with were beginning to show their limitations when facing an enemy who was now dug into prepared positions. Indirect fire, interdiction and counter-battery fire emphasized the importance of long-range heavy artillery. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. Two sources of heavy artillery suitable for conversion to field use were surplus coastal defense guns and naval guns. However, a paradox faced artillery designers of the time; while large caliber naval guns were common, large caliber land weapons were not due to their weight, complexity, and lack of mobility. Large caliber field guns often required extensive site preparation because the guns had to be broken down into multiple loads light enough to be towed by a horse team or the few traction engines of the time and then reassembled before use. Building a new gun could address the problem of disassembling, transporting and reassembling a large gun, but it did not necessarily address how to convert existing heavy weapons to make them more mobile. Rail transport proved to be the most practical solution because the problems of heavy weight, lack of mobility and reduced setup time were addressed. Design * The guns - The mle 1914 started life as an order for six coastal defense guns manufactured by Schneider for Denmark. It was a typical built-up gun of the period made from steel with a rifled inner tube and reinforced by layers of external tubes. The recoil system for the gun consisted of a U shaped gun cradle which held the trunnioned barrel and a slightly inclined firing platform with a hydro-gravity recoil system. When the gun fired the hydraulic buffers below the barrel slowed the recoil of the cradle which slid up a set of inclined rails on the firing platform and then returned the gun to position by the combined action of the buffers and gravity. * Traverse and Elevation - The gun carriage employed a car traversing or berceau system where the car and trucks were placed on a base plate and could be traversed 14°. The base plate is arranged with a pintle in front and the car has two rollers behind. At the rear of the rail carriage, there was a shell hoist and there was also a small cart which ran on rails to the breech for ammunition handling. The gun could elevate between +20° to +65° and loaded at +45°. * The breech - The guns had a semi-automatic interrupted screw breech that was tied to the recoil system which opened the breech after firing, loaded the next round, closed the breech, and cocked the firing mechanism. Although this system was complicated it gave the mortar a rate of fire of 1 round every two minutes which is high for a system with heavy projectiles. *Rail Carriage - Rather than being a true railway gun it was more of a multi- mode siege gun because the carriage built by St Chamond could be reconfigured to run on standard gauge rails, narrow gauge rails or fitted with road wheels like the Canon de 240 TR Mle 1903 which was similar in construction and configuration. In the center of the carriage, there were the two standard gauge 4-wheeled railroad bogies that could be raised or lowered. There was also a narrow gauge 4-wheeled bogie at both ends that could also be raised and lowered. Lastly, jackscrews are provided on the car body for transferring from one set of bogies to the other. Road wheels could be substituted for the narrow-gauge trucks and the carriage could be towed by a traction engine. At the front of the carriage, there was a shear leg derrick that could be used to load and unload the gun for transport. The normal procedure was to transport the gun fully assembled on standard-gauge rails until near the front and then disassemble the gun and transport it on narrow-gauge rails or on its road wheels. Site preparation consisted of creating a level piece of ground by laying a bed of stones and timbers then lowering the carriage onto the base plate. The base plate is prevented from moving by two anchors buried in front of the mount. The gun is then reassembled on the base plate and made ready for action.  World War I  The six mle 1914 mortars and four spare barrels were assigned to 61st, 62nd and 63rd batteries of the 25th Group of the 3rd RAP of the ALGP (artillerie lourde à grande puissance) on 21 February 1916. On 1 August 1917, the mortars and spares were reorganized into two batteries and assigned to 21st and 22nd batteries of the 11th Group of the 73rd RALGP. They were used during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and two were sent to reinforce the Italian Front during 1917. All six mortars survived the First world war.  World War II  The six mle 1914 mortars were placed in reserve between the wars. Four were mobilized and deployed by the 371° Regiment of the ALVF (Artillery lourde sur voie ferrée) to reinforce the Maginot Line defenses.

Founded in 1994, Toyota Argentina started importing in 1995 and assembling vehicles in 1997. By 2017, more than $2 billion U.S. dollars was invested in the company. At the same time, production capacity has been increased from 10,000 to 140,000 vehicles a year, of which around 70% are destined for export to other Latin American countries. The workforce, initially consisting of 400 (or 750) employees, grew to 2,700 by 2007 and was more than 4,000 in 2011 and 5,000 in 2015.

Lutheran Church, in Freistatt, Missouri, is a member congregation of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) that was founded on September 8, 1874. Trinity Lutheran School was started at the following year. The current church building was constructed in 1954. The congregation received national attention when it was designated a \\"great church\\" by The Christian Century magazine in 1950.  History  In the early 1870s, a group of German Lutherans settled Minnesota. However, they found the Minnesota climate too cold for their liking, and took up an offer from the Frisco Railroad to purchase land in southwestern Missouri for $6 per acre in 1873. They decided to name the new settlement Freistatt, which means \\"place of refuge\\", after the town of Freistatt in Lower Saxony, Germany. During their journey from Minnesota, they had stopped at the headquarters of the LCMS in St. Louis and requested that an itinerant pastor be assigned to them. That pastor soon was holding services in the settlers' homes. The church was officially founded on September 8, 1874, and the next year the congregation constructed a parsonage and a church building, started a school, and called a permanent pastor. The community grew with additional German settlers from Illinois, New York, Ohio, and Wisconsin. In 1883, a white frame church was built to replace the original structure. In 1950, Trinity was designated a \\"great church\\" by The Christian Century magazine. The January 1, 1951, issue of Life magazine included the church as one of twelve \\"Great American Churches\\". At that time, every house in the village, which had a population of 132 at that time, contained members of the congregation. Further evidence as to the importance of the church to the community was that members lived in every farmhouse but one within of the church. The Christian Century published a followup article about the congregation in its December 1, 1993, issue, which its author, Randall Balmer, later included in his book Grant Us Courage: Travels Along the Mainline of American Protestantism. In 1952, the congregation decided it needed a larger and more modern church building. Construction of the new building, of gray limestone quarried in Carthage, Missouri, was undertaken in 1954, at a cost of $200,000. The interior has wood paneling and a high-vaulted ceiling; stained glass windows on each side of the nave contain phrases from the Nicene Creed. This, the congregations third church building, was dedicated on January 9, 1955, and continues in use. The congregation retained its reliance on the German language well into the 20th century. Up until the 1940s, church services were regularly held in German, and even in 1950 there were twice- monthly services in that language. Trinity's cemetery adjoins the church. An unusual aspect of the cemetery is that burials are in chronological order of death rather than by family. In 1950, the congregation had a membership of about 900 and church service attendance of 480. Both have declined in the years since then as young people have moved away from the largely rural area to larger towns and cities. In the early 1990s, membership was 695 and attendance was 315. By 2018, membership and average attendance were 536 and 192, respectively.  School  The congregation established a school, with the pastor serving as the teacher, within the first year of its existence. The first dedicated teacher was called in 1883, at which time the enrollment was 65 students. A new red brick school building was opened in 1927. Additions were constructed in 1959 and 2000. In 1951, enrollment stood at 90 students, and had declined slightly to 82 in kindergarten through grade 8 by 1993. In 2018, there were 68 students in kindergarten through grade 8, with another 25 in pre-kindergarten. In 1988, George H. W. Bush made a stop at the school during his presidential campaign to highlight his desire to be an \\"education president\\".

Her mother died when she was very young and her father was left to take care of her and her siblings. He remarried a woman whom was not interested in tending to his children, so most of the domestic responsibilities fell on Lutisha. Pettway never married. She farmed alongside her father until members of the Rentz Realty & Investments agency seized her father's land. After that, Lutisha moved to Mobile, Alabama where she worked as a domestic attendant for white families. This substantial increase in pay allowed here to send money to her father in Gee's Bend to counter child care costs for her nine children, including her son with Down Syndrome. She worked in Mobile for six and a half years, and she returned to Gee's Bend when her father fell ill. After he died, he left his land to Lutisha's brother Yancy.

In 2017, several of their journalists were subject of attacks, and since 2019 the website and its YouTube channel have been continuously censored in Venezuela by the Nicolás Maduro government.  History  VPItv was founded by former Miss Venezuela contestant Fabiola Colmenares and Popular Will politician Leonardo Trechi on 10 October 2015. Transmissions began on 6 December 2015 and officially became live on 19 December 2016. The YouTube channel was established in 21 December 2015. Following the 2015 Venezuelan parliamentary election which the MUD-led opposition won over the PSUV, VPItv (together with VIVOplay and Capitolio TV) started transmissions of the National Assemblyhttp://elvenezolanonews.com/tres-anos-de-trayectora-y-vpitv-expande- sus-fronteras/ From 2010 until January 2016, ANTV was the only television channel authorized to broadcast PSUV-led National Assembly sessions.  Coverage during the crisis in Venezuela  During the 2017 Venezuelan protests, Venezuelan internet users reported several live streaming websites including VPItv were inaccessible on 7 April 2017.  Attacks on reporters  On April 6, 2017, reporter Elvis Flores was arrested while covering the protests during the constitutional crisis. At the time of his arrest, police took Flores’ equipment and VPItv was subsequently forced to stop the broadcasts for the next 8 hours. The reporter was released 9 hours later and was reportedly beaten. During the 2017 Venezuelan regional elections in Tachira State, VPItv journalist Lorena Bornacelly and cameraman Óscar Duque were robbed of their work equipment and belongings from their car, which was parked near a polling station where they were working. On October 16, 2017, the day following the regional elections, protesters in Bolívar State attacked VPItv journalist Carlos Suniaga.

Suniaga later said that both the opposition and supporters of the government must respect the work of the press. = 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis = Following the 2019 presidential crisis, VPItv and other private TV channels has been the main target of censorship by the Bolivarian government. Access to YouTube is blocked frequently to prevent CANTV users from watching its live stream. Live streams of the National Assembly sessions and Guaidó's speeches have been regularly disrupted for CANTV users since the end of January, mainly affecting access to streaming platforms like Periscope, Bing, Twitter video, and YouTube, along with some other Google services. DNS blocking is employed to generate the disruptions. The longest block of YouTube to date started during an Assembly session on 6 March, lasting 20 hours. Between 29 and 30 January, at least eleven press personnel were arrested. On the evening of 29 January, four journalists were arrested by the Maduro government while reporting near the Miraflores presidential palace—Venezuelan journalists Ana Rodríguez of VPItv and Maiker Yriarte of TV Venezuela, and Chilean journalists Rodrigo Pérez and Gonzalo Barahona of TVN Chile. The two Venezuelan journalists were released; the Chilean journalists were deported.

Labuyo chilis are also commonly added for a spicier version. The leafy vegetables can include water spinach, moringa leaves, and chili pepper leaves, among others. Background The dish was originally used for members of the genus Pila, which are the native apple snail species found in the Philippine islands. These are known as kuhol (also kohol or cohol) in most parts of the Philippines, and bisokol (or bisocol) in northeastern Luzon. However, it is now more commonly used for the highly invasive golden apple snails (Pomacea canaliculata), also called kuhol, which are originally from South America and considered to be in the top 100 of the \\"World's Worst Invasive Alien Species\\". Golden apple snails originally entered the Philippines from 1982 to 1984 from farmed specimens in Taiwan. They were originally meant to be used as food for humans and domestic ducks, but they escaped into the wild. They have become a major pest in rice fields in the Philippines as well as in other Asian countries. Description Before cooking, the apple snails need to be cleaned thoroughly to remove the dirt and slime. This is done by soaking them overnight or for a few hours, which induces them to regurgitate digested matter. Cornstarch or flour may be added to the water to aid this process. They are rinsed thoroughly and the shells cleaned. The source of the snails are also important. They have to be from clean bodies of water, which can sometimes be difficult to ascertain. Commercially farmed canned versions can also be bought as an alternative. The apple snails can be cooked in the shell or without them.

Biography  His father was Jewish, born in 1902 under the Austro- Hungarian Empire, in the city of Stuhlweissenberg (Székesfehérvár), currently in Hungarian territory. His mother was born in Iquitos, capital of the Peruvian Amazon.Biografía Herman Braun Vega was born in Lima. His older brother, Max (Fernando Braun-Vega), was born in February 1932. After Herman, three other brothers were born: Berti (architect and urban planner), Álex (designer) and Aurora (painter and draftsman). His father bought reproductions in Paris and had them framed in Peru. In 1950, Herman entered the School of Fine Arts in Lima, where he studied for a year and a half. At the beginning of 1951, his brother Max (19), who signed Fernando Vega, decided to travel to Paris to be a painter. At the end of that year (1951), Herman, with only 18 years old, also moved to Paris to be a painter. In October of 1952 his son Eric was born and Herman had to abandon painting and dedicate himself to interior design. In 1955 he returned to Lima, where he opened an agency with architect Juan Gunther. In 1965, his brother Fernando (Max) died in Ibiza of an overdose of heroin.Hunt, Ken (2011): «Janine Pommy Vega: Beat poet and close associate of Corso, Ginsberg and Orlovsky», 21 February 2011. The Independent (London). Article about the death of the poet Janine Pommy Vega, who in December 1962 married Fernando Braun-Vega. Retrieved 18 March 2016. 2 In November 1967, Herman returned to Paris with his family. In 1978 he began to paint portraits, especially of his painters friends who invited to participate in the gestation of his canvases: Vladimir Veličković (in 1978), Gilles Aillaud (in 1979), Erró (in 1978-1982), Wifredo Lam (in 1979), Jean Dewasne (in 1982), William S. Hayter (in 1983) and Gérard Fromanger (in 1984). He also painted numerous writers: Jorge Semprún, Alain Jouffroy, Julio Ramón Ribeyro, Alfredo Bryce Echenique and Jean-Michel Ribes. His work shows off syncretism and artistic and cultural, ethnic and political miscegenation. It seeks to ignite the memory of the spectator - historical memory through the iconography of the great masters of Western painting, social and political memory, through the introduction of contemporary situations and also individual authentic memory. The sociologist Zygmunt Bauman has qualified him as one of the most outstanding exponents of liquid art, in his work Liquid Life, together with Manolo Valdés and Jacques Villeglé.

It came to wide attention after it was reviewed by the playwright George Bernard Shaw and marked the beginning for Guthrie of a new career in teaching the history of medicine. Aim Guthrie's objective was to bring to a wide audience and in chronological order, the past achievements in the history of medicine, from Imhotep to William Osler. Contents The first edition of the book consisted of 20 chapters, 448 pages and 72 plates, beginning with \\"The Genesis of Medicine\\" and ending with a chapter focussed on medical journalism. In the preface, Guthrie paid tribute to his mentor, the Scottish physician John Comrie, who had introduced him to the subject of medical history, Alexander Miles who \\"read the original manuscript and supplied much helpful criticism in the early stages of the work\\", the librarian of the Royal Society of Medicine G. F. Home and to J. C. Corson from Edinburgh University Library who prepared the index. Publication After 10 years' research, the book was published in 1945, the same year that Guthrie retired from clinical work. It was published in Britain by Thomas Nelson and Sons, and later in an American edition. Translations followed in Spanish (1947), German (1952) and Italian (1966). Reception The book received at least 53 English-language reviews which Guthrie kept in a scrapbook which was passed to his friend Haldane Philp Tait and is now (2019) in the collections of the Lothian Health Service Archive. Nearly all of the reviews were positive and the book was favourably compared with the few contemporary general histories of medicine then available, particularly Charles Singer's A Short History of Medicine and Garrison's An introduction to the History of Medicine. The British Medical Journal and The Lancet gave favourable reviews and the Journal of the American Medical Association recommended it to all physicians, but the Bulletin of the History of Medicine responded more critically, identifying a number of inaccurate names and dates. This intense criticism came from George Rosen, who was of the opinion that Guthrie should have included social context. Guthrie's response, as documented in his scrapbook, described it as \\"the only really adverse criticism, obviously by a disgruntled reviewer who thinks he could have done better himself\\". The book came to wider attention following a 3,000-word review by George Bernard Shaw in The Observer. Shaw wrote, \\"I am floored by the extraordinary discrepancy between his [Guthrie's] knowledge and my knowledge ... Dr Guthrie's job of packing it [the history of medicine] into 400 pages is learnedly and readably done\\". Shaw did criticise Guthrie for his omission of practitioners of alternative medicine including osteopaths, herbalists and homoeopaths, which Shaw believed was because \\"Dr Guthrie either does not know about them or considers them beneath the dignity of a history of medicine\\". Guthrie's response was that Shaw had provided an unconventional yet entertaining book review. Aware that Shaw's review had greatly increased the profile and popularity of the book he modestly wrote that \\"many who had no particular interest in the topic or the author, bought the book just because GBS [Shaw] had reviewed it; they had no special interest in the subject and none needless to say, in the author\\". Shaw's review was then published in the New York Journal-American, an American daily newspaper which brought the book to the attention of a large readership in the United States. In 1956, Guthrie wrote an article \\"On Writing a History of Medicine\\", which was then included in his book, Janus in the Doorway (1963). This book also included chapters on \\"The Value of Reviews\\" and \\"Hints for Historiographers\\". Following reprints in 1945, 1946 and 1947, and American, Spanish and German versions, a new and revised British edition was published in 1958. Most of the revisions were made by amendments to the text but some of the more lengthy notes were collected at the end of the book as a ten-page supplement. This revised book was reprinted in 1960. This critical acclaim made Guthrie's name well-known in history of medicine circles around the world. He made lecture tours, based on the book, to Central America (1949), Africa (1951–1952), Australasia (1953) and the United States in 1954, 1957 and 1961.

History St Michael's was erected in 1888–89 at the expense of Mrs. J. L. Scarborough and her son Mr. Elijah Impey Scarborough \\"to the glory of God and in memory of Admiral Impey\\", Mrs. Scarborough's father. It was designed by Mr. R. M.

Although a private chapel, it was used as a chapel of ease for the residents of Colyford and was declared open by the Bishop of Exeter, Edward Bickersteth, during a ceremony on 17 January 1889.The Devon and Exeter Daily Gazette – Church opening at Colyford – 18 January 1889 – page 5 The church was later handed over to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners by Mr. Scarborough for the benefit of the village.The Devon and Exeter Gazette – The Bishop of Crediton at Colyford: Consecration of a church – 18 March 1903 – page 3 It was consecrated on 17 March 1903 by the Bishop of Crediton, Robert Trefusis, in place of the Bishop of Exeter who was unable to attend due to ill health.The Western Times – Colyford Church: Consecration by the Bishop of Crediton – 20 March 1903 – page 10 St Michael's continues to hold Sunday services on a weekly basis and is also used for social events. In January 2015, the church's 125th anniversary was celebrated with a Songs of Praise service. Architecture St Michael's was built in an Arts and Crafts style using local flint rubble, with quoins, bands, windows and copings of Beer limestone, and the internal use of buff and red brick. The roof was built using tiles from Staffordshire and pitch pine on the inside. A bellcote was added to the west gable and contains corbels, gablets and a spirelet. The church, made up of a nave, chancel, south transept, south-west porch and north vestry, was built to accommodate 200 persons on open benches of pine. Three stained glass windows at the east end of the church were designed by Mr. F. Drake of Exeter. The font is made from carved Beer stone with a Hamstone base. Following the death of Mrs. Scarborough, her son had oak reredos added to the church in 1892 in her memory. In 1895, friends of the Scarborough family commissioned Mr. F.

When introduced in 1876 it was the first use of a 0-6-4 configuration in the British Isles. The final four locomotives were to be designated GS&WR; Class 203. Design The design utilised many existing components of the existing 0-6-0T and 0-4-4T designs. 18x24in cylinders were already being retrofitted to existing goods engines to cope with existing traffic needs. The first two locomotives, Nos. 201 and 202, were built as back tanks holding water above the rear bogie and were particularly noted for adhesion problems with little weight on the front driving wheels. The subsequent batch of four in 1880 were built with side tanks and being four tons heavier gave some improvement in adhesion. Service Experience with the 0-6-4T tanks was unusually disappointing for a McDonnel design. Experience at Cork has shown they were extremely prone to slipping while the long frames and wheelbase were problematic in the tight curves of marshalling sidings; with the powerful thrust of the large cylinders not being able to be utillised. Ivatt and Aspinall were to address these issues in a 0-6-0T design that was to become known as the GS&WR; Class 201. Withdrawals The first two, Nos. 201 and 202, were withdrawn relatively early and their numbers reallocated to a pair of members of GW&SR; Class 201 built in 1895 some eight years after the first four. No. 204 was rebuilt as a 0-6-0T in 1914. No. 205 and 206 were withdrawn in 1928 with No 203 lasting until 1940.

When the tide is at its lowest, there is a sand strip where it is possible to drive a car. This is a result of the wet sand having sufficient density to support the car's weight. The name of the beach comes from a folklore story about an old man named \\"Old Meng\\" (เฒ่าเมง) who was going to have a wedding ceremony for his daughter. But he and his all members of family died from a storm in the sea and his body became a mountain called Khao Meng (เขาเมง), which stands near the beach. Pak Meng Beach, especially at sunset, is renowned for the scenery. Pak Meng Beach also has pier, where visitors can rent boats to other nearby marine attractions such as Ko Ngai, Ko Kradan, Ko Ma, Ko Chuek, Ko Waen, Ko Muk and Emerald Cave. In addition, around Pak Meng Beach are many restaurants, and the road from here to Chang Lang Beach also known as Chao Mai Beach, there are two bridges crossing the estuary of Andaman Sea, which is commonly used as a place for fishing.

The church is located at 34A, Central Road, Batticaloa, Sri Lanka.  History  Zion Church was founded by Rev. Inpam Moses in 1974. The senior pastor is Rev. Roshan Mahesan. The Zion Church is affiliated to the Lighthouse Church in Kandy. Additionally, it is a charismatic church and a member of the Fellowship of Free Churches of Sri Lanka. It broadcasts, Zion FM, a christian radio programme in the Tamil language.  Easter Sunday bombings  The church was one of the sites affected during the terror attacks which occurred on Easter Sunday on 21 April 2019. The explosion took place at the church between local time 8.45 to 9.30 in the morning during the mass event. The bomber was prevented from entering the church by Ramesh Raju, one of the worshippers, who died in the explosion outside the building. About 25 casualties were reported in the church bombings and few casualties were also reported near the location of the church. More than 100 were wounded. Many of the dead and wounded were children because members of the church's Sunday school had gathered outside the church during a break between their classes and the start of the main service. The church's pastor, Rev Roshan Mahesan, was not in Batticaloa at the time of the bombing as he was visiting the Faith Tamil Baptist Church in Oslo's Grorud Valley in Norway. Subsequently, Mahesan said: “We are hurt. We are angry also, but still, as the senior pastor of Zion Church Batticaloa, the whole congregation and every family affected, we say to the suicide bomber, and also to the group that sent the suicide bomber, that we love you and we forgive you.\\" President Maithripala Sirisena visited the church on 9 May alongside other politicians to inspect the damage. Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, Archbishop of Colombo, visited the church on 15 June alongside Catholics to \\"spread love and brotherhood among those who left the world and among those who sustained injuries\\".

Background In late June 1953 the US 1st Marine Division completed its training and prepared to return to the Jamestown Line, the UN's Main line of resistance (MLR) across Korea relieving the US 25th Infantry Division. By dawn on 7 July, the 7th Marine Regiment took over on the right of the 1st Marine Division's line and the 5th Marine Regiment on the left, while the 1st Marine Regiment formed the division reserve, protecting the bridges across the Imjin River and the AN/MPQ-2 radar used to direct air strikes. The tactical situation had changed for the worse since the Marines last occupied this sector. Since the Battle of the Nevada Complex ended on 29 May, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) troops now controlled the three outposts, Carson, Vegas, and Elko, that blocked the best approach to Outposts Berlin and East Berlin, now being taken over by the 7th Marines. As General Randolph M. Pate, the division's commander, immediately realized: \\"The loss of Outpost Vegas... placed Berlin and East Berlin in very precarious positions and negated their being supported by ground fire except from the MLR.\\" The PVA tried to take advantage of any confusion resulting from the relief of the 25th Infantry Division by the Marines. Battle =Berlin Outposts (7-20 July)= On the evening of 7 July, PVA mortars opened fire upon Outposts Berlin and East Berlin and the nearby portion of the MLR, the area that Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Cereghino's 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, was taking over from Turkish Brigade attached to the 25th Infantry Division. By midnight, assault troops from the PVA 407th Regiment, 136th Division, advanced from the vicinity of Hill 190, a frequently used staging area, then moved along the ridgeline broken by Carson, Reno and Vegas, all of them now in PVA hands and attacked Berlin and East Berlin. At Berlin, Turkish soldiers stayed in place for a time after the Marines arrived, and a patrol dispatched from Lt. Col. Cereghino's battalion to set up an ambush got no farther than the outpost when the PVA struck. The remaining Turks and the newly arrived patrol reinforced the Marines manning Berlin. Higher headquarters soon lost contact with both Berlin and East Berlin. Because both outposts lay no more than from the MLR, their capture could provide the PVA with a springboard for an attack designed to shatter the main defenses. As a result, Cereghino organized a provisional platoon from members of his battalion headquarters and sent the unit to reinforce the MLR. Elements of Companies H and I, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, came under Cereghino's operational control and prepared to counterattack if the PVA should break through. Meanwhile, the mixed force of Marines and Turkish soldiers succeeded in clinging to Outpost Berlin. However, the Marines at East Berlin succumbed to an overwhelming force that surged up a steep slope and seized the main trench despite stubborn resistance from the outpost itself and accurate fire from the MLR and beyond. Supporting machine guns, mortars and artillery could not save East Berlin. A squad from Company F, 2/7 Marines, unsuccessfully counterattacked Outpost East Berlin at 04:15 on 8 July, dispensing with the usual artillery barrage in the hope of achieving surprise. A second force of Marines from Company F moved out at about 04:40 to reinforce the squad already committed to attacking East Berlin. PVA artillery caught the reinforcements in the open and wounded 15 Marines, but the attempted counterattack continued for another hour until the men of Company F received orders to fall back so the 11th Marine Regiment could fire a time-on-target concentration against the PVA-held outpost. The PVA who overran East Berlin had advanced by way of Reno and Vegas, where additional forces were now gathering to exploit this early success. The 1st 4.5-inch Rocket Battery hammered the assembly areas and also the PVA attacking Berlin and consolidating their hold on East Berlin. Artillerymen of the 2nd Battalion, 11th Marines, fired a time-on-target concentration that shattered a PVA company as it was organizing on Outpost Vegas to continue the attack. During the early morning's fighting, all four battalions of the 11th Marines took part in the firing, along with the seven US Army and Turkish artillery battalions still in the area until the relief of the 25th Infantry Division was completed. These weapons matched their PVA counterparts almost round for round, and Army and Marine Corps tanks joined the rocket battery and artillery battalions in battering the PVA. Not until 06:30 did Cereghino obtain confirmation that East Berlin had fallen, and shortly afterward he learned that Berlin, some west of the captured outpost, still survived. He promptly reinforced Berlin insofar as its compact size permitted, dispatching 18 additional Marines, roughly doubling the number of the outpost's American and Turkish defenders. To recapture East Berlin would require a strong force of infantry supported by intense fire from mortars, tanks, and artillery. At 10:00, taking advantage of an artillery and mortar barrage totalling perhaps 1,600 rounds, a reinforced platoon from Company G, 3/7 Marines, and another from that battalion's Company H, both companies now under Cereghino's operational control, launched the counterattack. The platoon from Company H led the way but encountered an accurate PVA mortar barrage that pinned the Marines against the barbed wire protecting the MLR and in 15 minutes reduced the force to about 20 men able to fight. The platoon from Company G advanced through the battered unit and pressed home the counterattack. Shells fired by tanks and artillery exploded immediately in front of the infantrymen, enabling the assault force to reach the main trench on East Berlin and use grenades and small arms fire to kill, capture, or drive off the PVA. At 12:33, the platoon from Company I, reduced to fewer than two-dozen effectives, regained control of the outpost. Another platoon from the same company immediately moved forward to reinforce the survivors. Throughout the fighting at Berlin and East Berlin, storms had disrupted the movement of supplies by swelling the Imjin out of its banks and destroying a bridge. The bad weather also created mud that hampered movement on the battlefield and brought clouds that reduced visibility of supporting aircraft. At about noon on 8 July, however, four Marine F9Fs of VMF-311 took advantage of ground-based radar to attack targets a safe distance from East Berlin, dropping five tons of bombs on bunkers and troop concentrations. Heavy downpours hampered frontline combat and grounded the 1st Marine Air Wing for a total of 12 days early in July. Rain fell on 22 days that month, but the wing nevertheless reported 2,668 combat sorties, more than half of them flown in close support all along the United Nations line. The weather improved after mid-month, enabling aerial activity to increase. The recapture of East Berlin enabled the last of the Turkish troops to withdraw, completing the relief of the US 25th Infantry Division. The 11th Marines resumed its normal mission of direct support of the 1st Marine Division, as did the 1st Tank Battalion. Regaining Outpost East Berlin on 8 July, which coincided with the resumption of truce negotiations at Panmunjom, did not end the PVA pressure on the Marines. After dark on the 8th, Colonel Glenn C. Funk, who had assumed command of the 7th Marines on 27 March, moved a platoon from the regiment's 3rd Battalion and four M46 Patton tanks into position to strengthen the MLR. The tanks had just arrived at Hill 126, an outcropping just to the rear of the battle line, when the Marines heard the sound of trucks from beyond PVA lines. From the hilltop, the M-46s directed 90mm fire against known PVA positions, and the noise of truck motors ended. PVA troops, who meanwhile had advanced from the assembly area on Vegas, probed Outpost Berlin and struck a stronger blow against East Berlin. Fighting raged for almost two hours before fire from mortars, artillery and tanks forced the PVA to break off the action at about 03:15 on 9 July. After Lt. Col. Cereghino's Marines ended this latest threat to East Berlin, the PVA remained content to jab at the division rather than try for a knockout. Entire days might pass during which Marine aerial or ground observers and patrols saw few, if any, signs of the PVA who seemed to be improving their tunnels and bunkers instead of venturing out of them to mount an attack. The Marines still underwent sporadic shelling, but the bombardments did not approach in ferocity those of 8 and 9 July. Mines for a time proved deadlier than artillery and mortars, as on 12 July when these weapons killed four Marines and wounded eight. At least one minefield contained a new type of Russian-designed weapon that could be detonated by pressure or with a trip wire. Most of the fields employed mines familiar to the Marines, types that may have been newly planted or perhaps had lain dormant under the frozen ground and become deadly when the weather grew warmer and the earth softer. Although the PVA did not attack on the scale of 7–8 July, PVA patrols repeatedly clashed all along the division's front with those sent out by the Marines. On the night of 12 July, for example, a 13-man patrol from the 5th Marines encountered a force of PVA near Outpost Esther, and a combat patrol from the 7th Marines, looking for the PVA near Elko, engaged in an 18-minute firefight. As the frequency of patrol actions increased, flooding again interfered with the supply effort. On the night of 14–15 July, the Imjin River reached a maximum depth of . Only the solidly-built Freedom Bridge, carrying the road to Panmunjom across the swollen river, could be used until the water subsided. On the night of 16–17 July, patrols from the 5th Marines engaged in two firefights, suffering no casualties in the first, near Outpost Hedy, while killing three PVA and wounding one. The regiment's second patrol of the night ran into an ambush near Hill 90. The PVA proved more aggressive than in recent days, pinning down the patrol and unleashing a flurry of mortar and artillery fire that wounded every member of a unit sent to help break the ambush. Another group of reinforcements succeeded, however, in reaching the embattled patrol. After two hours of fighting and several attempts to isolate and capture individual Marines, the PVA withdrew, having suffered 22 killed and wounded. When seven Marines failed to return to the MLR, a platoon from the 5th Marines searched the battle site and recovered six bodies. The third firefight of the night erupted just after midnight in the sector of the 7th Marines, when a 30-man patrol from Company A, 1st Battalion, was ambushed after it passed through a gate in the barbed wire northwest of Outpost Ava. Between 40 and 50 PVA, supported by mortars, opened fire with grenades and small arms. After a 15-minute exchange of fire in which as many as 18 PVA may have been killed or wounded, the ambush party vanished into the darkness. As the Marines from Company A returned through the gate, a head count revealed four men missing. A recovery squad crossed and recrossed the area until dawn drew near but found only three bodies. One Marine from Company A remained missing; three had been killed and 21 wounded. The actions near Outpost Elko and in front of the Ava gate lent credence to Chinese propaganda. Since the 1st Marine Division returned to the main line of resistance, Chinese loudspeakers hadgone beyond the usual appeals to surrender, on at least one occasion warning of the fatal consequences of going on nighttime patrols. This threat, however, probably reflected a Chinese policy of maintaining overall military pressure after the resumption of truce talks rather than a specific effort to demoralize the Marines. Whatever the purpose of the PVA's propaganda, the Marine patrols continued. On the night after the ambush of Company A, 1/7 Marines advanced as far as the Ungok hills to silence a machine gun that had been harassing the MLR and, after a successful 20-minute firefight, left a Marine Corps recruiting poster to mark the point of farthest advance. Meanwhile, the Korean Marines had four patrol contacts with the PVA, none lasting more than a few minutes. The combat outposts like the Berlins, Esther and Ava had become increasingly vulnerable. By mid-July, General Pate directed his staff to study the possibility of the 1st Marine Division's shifting from a linear defense, the continuous MLR and the network of outlying combat outposts in front of it, to a system of mutually supporting defensive strongpoints that would result in greater depth and density. The PVA attacks of 7 and 8 July on Berlin and East Berlin served as a catalyst for the study that General Pate launched. As the US I Corps commander, General Bruce C. Clarke, later explained, these actions demonstrated that American minefields and barbed wire entanglements had channeled movement between the MLR and the combat outpost lines into comparatively few routes that had become dangerously familiar to the PVA. As a result, PVA mortars and artillery could savage the troops using these well- worn tracks to reinforce an embattled outpost, withdraw from one that had been overwhelmed, or counterattack to regain a lost position. Indeed, US Eighth Army commander General Maxwell D. Taylor agreed that the PVA could, if he chose to pay the price in blood and effort, overrun any of the existing outposts, and endorsed the concept that General Pate's staff was studying. The change in tactics, however, had not yet gone into effect when the PVA next attacked the Marine positions, but the new assault forced 7th Marines to adopt, in a modified form, the principles of depth and density that the division commander was suggesting. When the PVA again attacked, a ceasefire seemed imminent. President of South Korea Syngman Rhee agreed on 11 July to accept American assurances of future support and enter into a truce. By the 19th, the negotiators at Panmunjom seemed to have resolved the last of the major issues. On this very date, however, the PVA struck. On the night of 19–20 July, the PVA again assaulted Combat Outposts Berlin and East Berlin, now manned by the 3/7 Marines, which had relieved the 2nd Battalion, and also menaced Outposts Dagmar and Ingrid, held by elements of the 5th Marines. The positions of the 5th Marines held firm, thanks in part to accurate fire from the 11th Marines, but Berlin and East Berlin were in peril almost from the outset. After a savage bombardment of both Berlins and nearby segments of the MLR, PVA troops at 22:30 on the 19th stormed the ridgeline where the two outposts were located, attacking East Berlin first and Berlin immediately afterward. Company I, 3/7 Marines, garrisoned both outposts, posting 37 Marines at East Berlin and 44 at Berlin. Mortars, machine guns, howitzers and 90mm tank guns blasted the advancing PVA in support of Company I. Despite the firepower massed against them, the PVA overran both outposts within three hours. A duel between US and PVA gunners continued after the fall of the two Berlins. The PVA fired some 3,000 rounds while overwhelming the outposts and trying to neutralize the nearby MLR and the artillery batteries behind it. One Turkish and two Army artillery battalions joined three battalions of the 11th Marines, two of 105mm and one of 155mm howitzers, in responding to the PVA bombardment, battering the assault force, its supporting mortars and howitzers, and the assembly areas used by reinforcements in exploiting the early success. Barrage and counter-barrage continued into the morning of 20 July; at 05:20, for example, PVA shells were exploding at the rate of one per second on the MLR immediately behind Outposts Berlin and East Berlin. Meanwhile, at 04:00 Lieutenant Colonel Paul M. Jones, in command of the 3/7 Marines, alerted Companies D and E of the regiment's 2d Battalion, already under his operational control, to counterattack Berlin and East Berlin at 07:30. Half an hour before the scheduled time, Jones received word to cancel the counterattack. Rather than restore the outpost line, General Pate shifted elements of the division reserve, the 1st Marines, to strengthen the MLR in the event the PVA should try to exploit their capture of the two Berlins. While the 1st Marines reinforced the MLR, air power and artillery tried to neutralize the outposts the PVA had captured. Since a ceasefire seemed only days away and any attempt to regain the lost ground would result in severe Marine casualties, there would be no counterattack to restore a position that seemed almost certain to be abandoned when a demilitarized zone took shape after the end of hostilities. Instead, air strikes and fire from tanks and artillery scourged the lost outposts to prevent the PVA from using them to mount an assault on the main defenses. Especially effective were attacks by Marine aircraft against Berlin and East Berlin and bombardment by Army 8-inch and 240mm howitzers, adjusted by Marine aerial observers, which shattered bunkers and collapsed almost all the trenches on both outposts. Colonel Jones’ 3/7 Marines, estimated that the fighting on 19–20 July had killed perhaps 75 PVA and wounded as many as 300, thus crippling a battalion that had to be replaced by a fresh unit. The 7th Marines and attached units lost six killed, 118 wounded, and 56 missing, but 12 of the missing men survived as prisoners of war and returned in the general exchange when the fighting ended. =Boulder City= Aerial view of the battle-scarred terrain around Boulder City, July 1953 Once the PVA captured Berlin and East Berlin, the critical terrain feature on the right of the sector held by the 1st Marine Division became Hill 119, nicknamed Boulder City, the segment of the MLR nearest the two lost outposts and therefore the likely objective of any deeper PVA thrust. Company D, 2/7 Marines, (attached to the regiment's 3rd Battalion) held Boulder City itself. Company E, 2/7 Marines, (also attached to the 3rd Battalion) joined Companies H and I of the 3rd Battalion in defending the high ground extending from behind Boulder City, although within supporting distance, to Hill 111 at the boundary between the 1st Marine Division and the 1st Commonwealth Division. The newly arrived 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines moved into position between the 3/7 Marines, on its right and 1/7 Marines, on its left. The 2/7 Marines, served as regimental reserve. The introduction of 2/1 Marines, which came under control of the 7th Marines, served as the first step in a planned relief of the 7th Marines by the 1st Marines. For now, the newly arrived battalion added further depth and density to the MLR, organizing Hill 126 and the other commanding heights in its sector. In effect, three battalions, rather than the two previously defending the regimental area, formed a crescent of strongpoints designed to contain and defeat any offensive launched from Berlin and East Berlin. In the sector held by the 7th Marines, Outpost Ava, manned by a squad from Company A, 1/7 Marines, survived on the far left, near the boundary between the 7th and 5th Marines. Boulder City, formerly a component of a continuous MLR, now functioned as an outpost of the reconstituted defenses. By 22 July, Company G, 3/7 Marines, had taken over Boulder City, from the regiment's Company D, which reverted to the control of its parent battalion, 2/7 Marines, in reserve. Signs of an imminent PVA attack multiplied as July drew to a close. The probable objectives seemed to include Outposts Hedy and Dagmar, but instead of attacking either in force, the PVA sent only a token force, wearing burlap camouflage, that appeared near Hedy on 21 July. The defenders opened fire, killing three of the PVA, and the survivors fled. VMF-115 and VMF-311, released by the Fifth Air Force to support the UN troops fighting in central and eastern Korea, joined VMA-121 in pounding the PVA threatening the 1st Marine Division. Recurring cloud cover produced frequent downpours that interfered with operations during the critical period of 21–23 July, but the three squadrons nevertheless flew more than 15 radar-directed missions that dropped some 33 tons of bombs. As the threats to Outposts Hedy and Dagmar abated, PVA forces menaced Boulder City, where Company G, 3/1 Marines, commanded by First Lieutenant Oral R. Swigart, Jr., manned the defenses after relieving Company D, 2/7 Marines. On the evening of 24 July, PVA mortars and artillery began hammering Swigart's perimeter. Marine artillery and 4.5-inch rocket launchers immediately responded against targets that included a PVA regiment massing behind Hill 139, northwest of Outpost Berlin. At 20:30, PVA troops began probing the right of the 1st Marine Division's line. After a powerful barrage by mortars and artillery, the assault force hit Hill 111 at the far right of the positions held by the 7th Marines, then shifted to Boulder City near the boundary between the 3/7 Marines, and the attached 2/1 Marines. As they had on 7 July, the PVA sought to take advantage of the relief of the 7th Marines by the 1st Marines. When the PVA attack began, the 2/1 Marines, attached to the 7th Marines, had already taken over positions that included Boulder City. The 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines was relieving the 3/7 Marines, as Company H took over Hill 111 and Company G defended the critical ground at Boulder City. At about 19:30 on 24 July the PVA attacked Hill 111 and soon cracked the perimeter now manned by Company H, 3/1 Marines. For about 50 minutes, the PVA clung to a salient on the hilltop, but then withdrew. After this flurry of action, apparently intended to divert attention from Boulder City, the PVA ignored Hill 111 until the morning of 25 July, when artillery fire battered the perimeter but no infantry assault followed. The two PVA battalions attacking on the Marine right had their greatest success at Boulder City, seizing a portion of the trenchline defended by Company G, 3/1 Marines. In an attempt to exploit this foothold, the PVA attacked the Berlin and East Berlin gates, passages through the wire that the Marines had used to supply and reinforce the two outposts before both were overwhelmed. Cloud cover prevented aerial observers from supporting the troops protecting the gates, and the PVA managed to gain control of Berlin gate and mount a second determined assault on the Boulder City perimeter. Hand-to-hand fighting raged all along the of trench that Lieutenant Swigart's Marines still held. The company's ammunition ran low, and the plight of casualties became increasingly difficult as PVA fire killed two of Boulder City's eight corpsmen and wounded most of the others. By midnight, Swigart's company could muster no more than half its earlier strength, but it still clung to the rear slope of Boulder City. Casualties had further eroded the strength of the Boulder City garrison, when at 00:15 on the 25th, Company I, 3/1 Marines, moved toward the hill to reinforce Swigart's survivors. The PVA intercepted and correctly interpreted the coded radio message ordering the Company I Marines forward, thus obtaining information that enabled their artillery and mortars to wound or kill about a third of the reinforcements. Despite the deadly barrage, much of Company I reached Boulder City, joined forces with the remnants of Swigart's garrison, and took part in a counterattack that recaptured the hill by 03:30. Further reinforcements from Company E, 2/7 Marines, and Company E, 2/1 Marines, arrived by 05:30 to consolidate the position. A few PVA, however, continued to cling to positions on the slopes nearest the MLR. Since the PVA still controlled the approaches to Boulder City, they were able to mount another attack on that position at 08:20, 25 July. Fire from Marine mortars and artillery, and from the 90mm weapons of 10 tanks dug in on the Marine positions, played the key role in breaking up the new assault, although the last of the attackers did not withdraw until afternoon. The M-46 tanks proved deadly against advancing PVA troops, but also presented an inviting target for PVA artillery and mortar crews, who directed some 2,200 rounds at the armored vehicles. Aircraft also helped repulse the 25 July attack on Boulder City, as when F9F jets flew nine missions, guided by ground radar, against positions threatening Boulder City and nearby defensive strongpoints. Before midnight on 24 July, in an attack perhaps loosely coordinated with the thrust at Boulder City, PVA forces hit the positions held by the 5th Marines. After probing the defenses of Outposts Dagmar and Esther, the PVA concentrated against the latter, manned by elements of Company H, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines. The PVA tried to isolate Outpost Esther by shelling and patrolling the routes leading there from the MLR and succeeded in overrunning outer portions of the perimeter. The defenders prevailed because of the skillful use of their own weapons, including flamethrowers and the support of mortars, machine guns, tanks and artillery. The 3rd Battalion, 11th Marines, fired 3,886 rounds against PVA troops attacking Outpost Esther, and PVA gunners matched this volume of fire. The Marines suffered 12 killed and 98 wounded in the fighting that began at Dagmar and continued at Esther, while PVA casualties may have totaled 195 killed and 250 wounded. Dawn on 26 July brought a lull in these last battles. PVA attempts to revive their attack by infiltrating reinforcements through the site of Outpost Berlin failed, thanks to accurate fire from Marine riflemen and machine gunners. The 1st Marines completed its relief of the 7th Marines at 13:30. That night, the PVA probed Boulder City for the last time, sending a patrol from Outpost Berlin that failed to penetrate the defensive wire and shortly after midnight dispatching another platoon that prowled about before Marine fire repulsed it. Aftermath The Korean Armistice Agreement was signed at Panmunjom at 10:00 on 27 July and the ceasefire went into effect at 22:00. Although the last of the PVA attacks seized Outposts Berlin and East Berlin, they failed to wrest Boulder City from its Marine defenders. Had the PVA captured Boulder City, they might have exploited it and seized the high ground to the south and east, from which they could have fired directly into the rear areas that sustained the 1st Marine Division in its positions beyond the Imjin River. In fighting the Chinese to a standstill during July 1953, the division suffered 1,611 casualties, killed, wounded, and missing, the most severe losses since September/October 1952 when savage fighting had raged at Outposts Carson, Reno and Vegas and on the Hook. PVA losses during July 1953 may have exceeded 3,100. Staff Sergeant Ambrosio Guillen of Company F, 2/7 Marines would be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions on 25 July.

Case  The government used the evidence it obtained from opening the letters when charging Charles W. Ramsay and James W. Kelly with violating federal laws related to drug trafficking.

At issue was whether opening mailed letters was within the scope of the border search exception to the Fourth Amendment's requirement of either a search warrant or probable cause to conduct a search.

Prior to that, he was chancellor in the royal court of Emeric, King of Hungary between 1202 and 1204. He participated in the Fifth Crusade, where he was killed in fights against the Ayyubid Sultanate. Some historians identify him with the chronicler Anonymus, author of the Gesta Hungarorum. Early life Peter (also Pescha and Pechse) was born in the mid-1170s, as he was about the same age as King Andrew II, according to his royal charter from 1217. They were brought up together in the royal court of Andrew's father, Béla III. The reconstruction of Peter's early life is uncertain and contested, mainly depending on the existing parallel scholarly standpoints that he can be identified with the chronicler Anonymus or not. In 1966, literary journal Irodalomtörténeti Közlemények published the papers of János Horváth, Jr. and Károly Sólyom, who first claimed Anonymus was identical with Peter, Bishop of Győr, independently from each other. Subsequently, other historians, including György Györffy and Gyula Kristó refused their theory and there is no unanimously recognized scientific position. For instance, the interpretation of the \\"P dictus magister\\" text in the opening sentence of the Gesta Hungarorum is unclear. The text may refer to a man whose monogram was P – as most of the historians share this view and tried to find contemporary church people with \\"P\\" initial – or it may be an abbreviation of the Latin word for \\"aforementioned\\" (praedictus) in reference to a name on the title page which is now missing. anonymous author of the Gesta Hungarorum in Vajdahunyad Castle in Budapest Philologist János Horváth, who claimed Peter was identical with Anonymus, considered his baptismal name was Peter and identified him with a certain bishop Torda (Turda) – his pagan name, son of dux Velek, who was referred by Andrew II in 1225. In this theory, Peter's mother was a Greek woman, possibly a maid of honor of Béla's first wife Agnes of Antioch and he also had a sister Anne, who married Bors, son of Dominic Miskolc and Margaret, spouse of an unidentified Ban Stephen. Accordingly, Peter came from the lineage of chieftain Velek, who had participated in the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin and is a recurring character in the Gesta Hungariorum. As Anonymus had a detailed knowledge of the lands along the upper courses of the river Tisza, especially the bishopric lands of the Diocese of Eger, historian Károly Sólyom, who also identified Anonymus with Bishop Peter, claimed that Duke Andrew and Peter spent their youth in the episcopal manor of Peter, Bishop of Eger in the 1180s. During that time, the younger prince Andrew was raised as a potential pretender to the neighboring Principality of Halych. Regardless his identification with Anonymus, Sólyom considered Bishop Peter himself also originated from the borderlands of Zaránd County, based on his other name variants in the contemporary documents. He also claimed the town of Pecica (Pécska), present-day in Romania, is named after him. Peter attended a French universitas (presumably at the Abbey of Saint Genevieve or the University of Paris) from 1190 to 1194, where obtained a doctorate of canon law. He bore the title of magister, demonstrating his literacy and scientific proficiency. According to Károly Sólyom, Peter studied together with his friend the \\"literate\\" Nicholas Csák (brother or nephew of Bishop Ugrin Csák). Accordingly, later Anonymus dedicated his work to \\"the most venerable man N\\", i.e. Nicholas. Peter read Dares Phrygius's Trojan History, if the Anonymus identification is correct. Returning to Hungary, Peter functioned as a notary in the chancellery of Béla III between 1194 and 1196, as both János Horváth and Károly Sólyom argued (Anonymus wrote in the opening sentence of his work that he was \\"Bele regis notarius\\" – \\"Notary of King Béla\\"). According to Sólyom's interpretation, the young Peter wrote the Gesta Hungarorum thereafter, from 1196 to 1198, after the death of Béla III (while the majority of historians consider Anonymus was in advanced age, when the text was completed in the early 13th century), but before his election as provost of Székesfehérvár (as Anonymus styled himself only magister in his work). As Anonymus knew and used the Aragonese chronicles as a source, Sólyom assumed that the young courtly cleric Peter was a member of that Hungarian diplomatic mission, which escorted Constance of Aragon to Hungary in order to become the wife of Emeric, King of Hungary around 1197 or 1198. Peter already served as provost of Székesfehérvár, when he was made chancellor in the royal court in 1202. This high confidence function showed that, despite his juvenile ties to Andrew, he was a confidant of King Emeric too, whose whole reign was characterized by the struggles for the Hungarian throne with his younger brother. Peter retained his office until the death of Emeric in 1204. It is possible he is identical with that magister Peter, who made a diplomatic visit to Rome in November 1204, according to the letter of Pope Innocent III. If Peter is not identical with Anonymus, only the following data are certain about his early life: he was born in the 1170s and spent his childhood in Duke Andrew's surroundings. Contemporary records preserved other name variants of his name: Pescha, Pechse and Pethse. He served as provost of Székesfehérvár and royal chancellor from 1202 to 1204, before becoming Bishop of Győr until his death. Bishop of Győr At the turn of 1204 and 1205, following the translation of Ugrin Csák to the Archdiocese of Esztergom, Peter was elected Bishop of Győr. He was a faithful confidant of Duke Andrew, who administered the kingdom on behalf of his minor nephew, Ladislaus III. According to the Annales Admontenses, when the young Ladislaus died in exile at Vienna in May 1205, the Bishop of Győr – most likely Peter – carried his body, the Holy Crown and the royal insignia to Székesfehérvár. Ladislaus was buried in the Székesfehérvár Basilica. It is plausible that Peter was also present at the coronation of Andrew II on 29 May. In contemporary domestic documents and charters, Peter first appears as suffragan on 1 August 1205, when he was still styled as bishop-elect. During his bishopric, Peter supported the efforts of Andrew II, who introduced a new policy for royal grants, which he called \\"new institutions\\" in one of his charters. Andrew II at the head of his crusader army (from the Illuminated Chronicle) In the upcoming decade, Peter involved in various ecclesiastical disputes and lawsuit as an papal trustee and arbitrator due to his high degree of literacy. He supported the election of John, Archbishop of Esztergom during a legal controversy with Pope Innocent. When King Andrew made his brother-in-law, Berthold, Pope Innocent refused the confirm his nomination, because he was under the specified age. Archbishop John confronted with the influential Berthold in numerous occasions. Queen Gertrude's brother was tacitly supported by King Andrew II in his efforts. Upon John's request, Pope Innocent confirmed his dignity's right of the coronation of the Hungarian monarch in 1209. However Berthold used his family relationships and influence in the royal court to put John under pressure. Amidst these circumstances, John was inclined to reach agreement in 1211: the two archbishops entrusted Robert, Bishop of Veszprém and Peter, Bishop of Győr to prepare a convention draft and submit to the Roman Curia. The proposal contained that the right of coronation should belong to the role of archbishop Esztergom, except in case of deliberate rejection, obstacle, deteriorated health condition or sede vacante, when the process must be performed by the archbishop of Kalocsa. The so-called \\"second coronations\\" (during festive events) must be celebrated jointly. The theses of the document was promoted by Andrew II himself too. However Pope Innocent refused to countersign the document on 12 February 1212, referring to its \\"harmful consequences\\" for the Kingdom of Hungary. Upon the request of Andrew II, Peter and Robert escorted the unpopular and endangered Berthold until the Austrian border in 1214, protected by the episcopal armies of Győr and Veszprém. According to János Horváth, Peter wrote his gesta sometimes between 1215 and 1217, and also reflected the assassination of Queen Gertrude occurred in 1213. Andrew II, who had pledged to lead a crusade to the Holy Land, petitioned Pope Innocent in 1214 to lift bishops Peter and Kalán Bár-Kalán from being obligated to attend the Fourth Council of the Lateran in the next year, because they were planning to participate in the campaign. However Andrew had again postponed the crusade. Instead, Bishop Peter visited Constantinople and negotiated with Henry of Flanders in mid-1215 over the proposed marriage between Andrew II and Yolanda, the daughter of the Emperor's brother-in-law, Peter II of Courtenay. After the conclusion of the agreement, Peter brought the queen to Hungary across the Balkans. Andrew and Yolanda were married still in that year. In July 1216, the newly elected Pope Honorius III once again called upon Andrew to fulfill his father's vow to lead a crusade. Amid the preparations for war, Peter procured Andrew II to confirm all possessions and privileges of his diocese's collegiate chapter of Vasvár. According to a royal charter from 1224, he was also granted the village of Szovát in Győr County (present-day Bágyogszovát). In May 1217, Andrew's army began its journey to the Holy Land with the participation of Thomas, Bishop-elect of Eger and Peter of Győr. In July, they departed from Zagreb and embarked in Split two months later. The ships transported them to Acre, where they landed in October. Andrew and his army participated in the fruitless clashes at the Mount Tabor against the Ayyubids. When Andrew decided to return home at the very beginning of 1218, Thomas and Peter remained in Syria. Peter died there sometime in 1217 or 1218. According to István Erőss, he was killed in the skirmishes at the Anti-Lebanon Mountains. The Cronica Reinhardsbrunnensis narrated that two unnamed Hungarian bishops were perished during the Siege of Damietta. Historian Gyula Pauler identified them with Peter of Győr and Simon of Várad.

Palanyag to Parañaque: A History, City of Parañaque, Philippines. It was established as a sitio of Don Galo by the late 17th century, connected to it only by a bamboo footbridge over the Tripa de Gallina. The sitio remained largely agricultural during the Spanish colonial period containing vast tracts of farmland and swamps that stretched as far north as the Estero de Maricaban and east to the territories of Malibay (now part of Pasay) and Bicutan (now part of Taguig), forming parts of the Hacienda de Maricaban of the Order of Saint Augustine. The sitio's original settlers were migrants from Don Galo, La Huerta and San Dionisio, including its pioneers, the de León family, followed by the Márquez, Santos, Valenzuela and Cruz families. With the incorporation of Parañaque as a town in the Province of Rizal under the American colonial government, Ibayo became a full-fledged barrio and Parañaque's only inland barrio consisting of four sitios, namely Dilain, Libro Balagbag, Bundok Mani and Mataas na Kahoy. Under American rule, the village started to grow with the purchase of the Hacienda de Maricaban by the U.S. government from its owner Dolores Casal y Ochoa who only years earlier in 1906 acquired the former friar hacienda. A portion of the hacienda was then transferred to the Manila Railroad Company and a railroad line was eventually extended to this barrio towards Cavite, with another line in its eastern portion towards Aloneros and the Bicol Region. In 1919, the Parañaque and Pasay section of the Maricaban estate was transformed into a U.S. Army Air Service camp known as Nichols Field, with the rest of the estate becoming part of the Fort William McKinley reservation. The airfield was eventually converted into an airport in 1948 and became the Manila International Airport. Ibayo was officially renamed after the barrio's patron saint, the Santo Niño de Parañaque, in 1960. In 1978, the barrio lost a significant part of its interior territory after two new barangays were created from several gated communities that were built there after the war. The communities adjacent to Bicutan, namely United Parañaque 1-3, Marian Park and Sitio de Asis, were ceded to the new barangay of San Martin de Porres. Its southern communities, on the other hand, became part of the barangay of Moonwalk that included Moonwalk Subdivision, Bricktown and Multinational Village.

Sergey Markin began artistic education in Sunday classes of the Imperial Stroganov Central Art and Industrial College (1911-1916). * In 1916-1920 studied at the Stroganov Central Art and Industry School, the First State Free Art Studio. * In 1920-1927 studied in Vkhutemas/Vkhutein in Moscow. Sergey Markin entered the pleiad of young artists of lyrical and romantic orientation, who began at the turn of the 1920-1930s, and \\"forgotten\\" for half a century for ideological reasons. In 1929, the Great Turning occurred in the fine arts of the USSR — the last exhibitions of all registered societies took place. After this, a “cultural revolution” began, where the censors sifted hostile petty-bourgeois artistic movements. These artists were united by moral maximalism, so the beginning of their creative biographies turned out to be a stellar moment. The colors and harmony of his paintings were highly appreciated by art critic C. B. Nikritin, who notedDiscussion reporting exhibition in the MOOSKH \\"Donbass in Painting\\", 12/14/1935.

It is believed to have ties to the Islamic State (ISIL).ISIS Claims Responsibility for Attacks President of Sri Lanka Maithripala Sirisena banned National Thowheed Jamath on 27 April 2019 and designated it as a terrorist organisation Along with Jammiyathul Millathu Ibrahim.http://www.adaderana.lk/news/54708/national-thowheed-jamath-and- jammiyathul-millathu-ibrahim-banned-in-sri-lanka  Aims  The group promotes an \\"Islamist terrorist ideology\\". The director of the International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism said that it \\"aims to spread the global jihadist movement to Sri Lanka and to create hatred, fear, and divisions in society.\\" The NTJ believes that the world was made solely for Muslims and is against other religions. They also do not consider Sufis as Muslims believing them to be Kafirs that should be killed, and they have carried out attacks against Sufi mosques. Since 2016 they began supporting the ideology of Islamic State preaching that all \\"non-Muslims\\" must be killed for a Muslim takeover of Sri Lanka.  History  The NTJ was founded by Moulvi Zahran Hashim in the exclusively Muslim town of Kattankudy, which has been called a \\"fertile ground for extremism\\" and has seen Arabisation and the spread of Wahhabism since the 1980s with funding from gulf nations. While Zahran was actively propagating radical Islamism as far as 2013, he only began propagating violent extremism in 2016. However, according to Sufi leaders of Kattankudy Zahran did preach violence early on and even began publishing a magazine from 2013 which had calls for attacks on Sufis. It was from 2016 that Zahran preached about a \\"Muslim takeover\\" of Sri Lanka by killing all \\"non-Muslims\\" and demanded that the hosting of the Sri Lankan National flag be stopped as it is a threat to the Islamic State. In 2016 Zahran also began to preach against Catholics and Christmas. The NTJ's leadership had been condemned by several Sri Lankan Muslim organisations in 2016 for advocating extreme fundamentalist indoctrination of children and for clashes with Buddhist monks. During the 2015 presidential election, Zahran campaigned against the then-president Mahinda Rajapaksa and in favour of Maithripala Sirisena. During the 2015 General Election, however, he used the votes of his 2000-3000 followers to make Muslim politicians from both major and minor parties in the Eastern Province to sign an agreement which included a ban on music, gender segregation in seating arrangements, refusal to support \\"moderate\\" Muslims and Sufis as well as a condition saying the political parties should support groups such as the National Thawheed Jama'ath. Those that signed the agreement include Shafi Salley, Shibly Farook, M.L.A.M. Hizbullah, A. L. M. Ruby and Abdul Rahman. Zahran however worked against Hizbullah after his supporters played music at one of his events. The group also terrorised the Sufi Muslim population in Kattankudy, who were considered as Kafirs by extremists and, according to Zahran, all Kafirs must be killed according to Sharia law. Sufi mosques were shot and Sufis were targeted by a sword-wielding mob led by Zahran in 2017. Despite complaints by Muslim organisations, the government failed to take proper action against Zahran and the NTJ. It was later revealed that the Police did in fact try to ban the organisation and take down their websites since 2017. However the Attorney General's department did not take several letters by the Terrorism Investigation Division seriously and the CDs sent by the TID containing Zahran's lectures were given to lesser officials to watch by Senior State Counsel Malik Aziz who ordered them to compile a report. The NTJ members included two associates of Zahran who were principal and teacher of Muslim schools respectively and were givek the charge of looking over his mosques. A NTJ member was part of the parliament staff. 64 Sri Lankan MPs have also accused the former Muslim cabinet minister Rishad Bathiudeen of backing the terrorists. The allegations included supply of empty shell casings to a factory owned by one of the bombers and Rishad's Moulvi advisor being arrested on suspicion of being a terrroist. Bathiudeen rejected ever having such an advisor and rejected asking for release of any of the suspects.http://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/archives/64242 K. D. N. Ranjith Asoka, Secretary Ministry of Industry & Commerce, rejected that Rishad requested any shell casings to be supplied to the bomber's factory.http://www.dailynews.lk/2019/06/28/local/189622/no-sathosa-vehicles- used-commerce-secretary In 2018, NTJ was linked to vandalism of Buddhist statues following anti-Muslim riots in Sri Lanka. The group's propaganda highlighted violence against Muslims in Myanmar, Sri Lanka, India and other countries. Group's online propaganda was handled by Aadhil Ameez who was employed by Virtusa in Sri Lanka as a software engineer. Aadhil's online activities were being monitored by Indian authorities since 2016 due to his links with Indian Jihadists. In order to promote Islamic State ideology he falsely claimed online to Indian Muslims that he was jailed, his house torched and he was beaten by Buddhists till he was limping. Zahran was a radical Islamist imam believed to be the mastermind behind the Sri Lanka bombings, preached on a pro-ISIL Facebook account, known as \\"Al-Ghuraba\\" media, and on YouTube. = Shooting police officers in Vavunathivu = Two police officers, 35-year-old Niroshan Indika and 28-year-old Ganesh Dinesh, were killed while on duty at a roadblock in Vavunathivu on 29 November 2018. Kethirgamathambi Rajakumaran, also known as Ajanthan, a former cadre of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, was arrested in suspicion after the attack. However, following the Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka, a security dragnet launched by the police and security forces nabbed the driver of the NTJ leader Zahran Hashim. He confessed it was National Thowheeth Jama'ath that carried out this attack on the cops. The police based on the confessions also recovered the stolen service weapons of the slain policemen. Defence Secretary Shantha Kottegoda requested the release of Kethirgamathambi Rajakumaran.http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2019/05/05/news/wrongful-arrest- alleged-vavunathivu-shooting = Easter bombings = NTJ was first made known to the Sri Lankan Police when a police officer sent an announcement to the authorities warning about a possible attack on churches 10 days before the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings on 21 April 2019. The report read that \\"the NTJ is planning to carry out suicide attacks targeting prominent churches as well as the Indian high commission in Colombo.\\" Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, remarked that government officials did not receive the advisory and that they would \\"look into why adequate precautions were not taken.\\" After the attacks, the Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne confirmed at an 22 April 2019 press conference that all seven of the suicide bombers in the near-simultaneous attacks were Sri Lankan citizens associated with NTJ, but said that foreign links were suspected. Officials earlier blamed the local Islamist group, \\"National Tawhid\\", but Al Jazeera correspondent Samer Allawi said the authorities had denied officially accusing the group of responsibility. ISIL has claimed responsibility for the attacks. = Sainthamaruthu shootout = On 27 April 2019, Sri Lankan security forces and militants from National Thowheeth Jama'ath clashed after the security forces raided a safe house of the militants. Fifteen people linked to the group, including six children, died during the raid as three cornered suicide bombers blew themselves up. A civilian was also killed in the process. Security forces found five pairs of white skirts and blouses in the safe house. Investigators found that the militants had bought nine pairs worth Rs. 29,000 on 29 March. Intelligence officials warned that this may be an attempt to launch an attack on Buddhist Temples using women posing as Buddhist devotees.  Strength  According to Sri Lankan Government sources the NTJ have 100-150 core members as well as numerous mosque in various regions of Sri Lanka. According to the Muslim community in Kattankudy Zahran's sermons outside the mosques attracted 2000-3000 people. After the government crackdown security forces found caches of weapons and explosives as well as CDs and literature containing Islamic extremist material. Security forces discovered detonators, firearms, ammunition, ammonia packets and other explosives including C4, incendiary bombs, knives, GPS, military camouflage, katana swords, machettes and suicide jackets from various parts of the country. On 5 May, government forces discovered a 15-acre land in Kattankudy disguised as a farm and is believed to be a training camp for militants and the next day raided a two-story guesthouse in Nuwara Eliya based on intel by arrested suspects. 35 terrorists including the bombers had received firearms training in this place. The discovery of a large number of swords from Mosques and Muslim homes without known affiliation with the organisation raised concern on the scale of the issue. The government theorised that it may be to cut shrubs or to protect women which was seen as a cover up by the opposition. On 13 May a woman was found with an artillery shell, several tail parts of RPG and mortar shells. On 27 June, Hayathu Mohamed Ahamed Milan, one of several suspects that were arrested in Jeddah and handed over to Sri Lanka led investigators to several large weapons caches in Kattankudy where over 300 gelignite sticks, Eight litres of gelignite liquid, a stock of detonating cord, 1000 detonators, 485 T56 live ammunition and several other explosive materials were discovered. On 27 August, police arrested two cadres of the group in Ampara town of Ampara District in the Eastern Province based on information provided by the State Intelligence Service, reports Colombo Page. The arrestees are identified as Muhammed Raisuddin Abdur Rahman alias Abu Anas and Seinul Aabdeen Hafsal alias Abu Rawa.  Foreign ties  The organisation has pledged allegiance to ISIL, who released a video after the attacks through its AMAQ news agency showing eight men declaring loyalty to its leader, Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, under the black ISIL flag. According to State Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene the organisation is believed to have close ties with Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen India (JMI), the Indian unit of the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh. The NTJ is believed to have received funding from foreign entities to build its mosques. Sri Lankan media citing a Lebanese newspaper published an alleged leaked document from Saudi Arabia sent to the Saudi ambassador in Sri Lanka 5 days prior to the attack. The document instructs to remove all information related to ties with foreign and local groups. Saudi Arabia dismissed the allegations and criticised the Sri Lankan government for allowing state media to publish the document. General Secretary of the SLFP, Dayasiri Jayasekara speaking to the media claimed that there was \\"firm evidence\\" to prove that religious extremists in Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been funding Islamic extremists in Sri Lanka and requested the Saudi and Qatari government to take action against these groups.

Background After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, his generals immediately began squabbling over his huge empire. Soon the squabbling degenerated into open warfare, with each general attempting to claim a portion of Alexander's vast Empire. One of the most talented successor generals (Diadochi) was Antigonus Monophthalmus, so called because of an eye he lost in a siege. After the First War of the Diadochi in 321 BC, the second partition of the Empire took place, the Partition of Triparadisus; Antipater became the new regent of the empire and Antigonus strategos of Asia (charged him with hunting down and defeating the remnants of the Perdiccan faction). Antigonus took command of the Royal Army and after being reinforced with more reliable troops from Antipater's European army he marched against their enemies in Asia Minor.Richard A. Billows, Antigonos the one-eyed and the creation of the Hellenistic State, p.72. In 319 BC he first marched into Cappadocia against Eumenes whom he defeated at the battle of Orkynia. Eumenes escaped to the fortress of Nora where Antigonus invested him.Richard A. Billows, Antigonos the one-eyed and the creation of the Hellenistic State, p.77; Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica XVIII 41, 1–3; Plutarch, Eumenes, 10,2–4. Leaving the siege of Nora to a subordinateRichard A. Billows, Antigonos the one-eyed and the creation of the Hellenistic State, p.77; Diodorus, Bibliotheca Historica XVIII 41, 5–7; Plutarch, Eumenes, 10,2–4. Antigonus marched against the remaining Perdiccans and defeated them at the battle of Cretopolis.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica XVIII 44–45; Polyainos, strategemata IV 6,7. Antigonus's coalition partner, Antipater, died of old age (83 years old) that year and left the regency to Polyperchon. Antigonus did not accept Polyperchon authority and formed a coalition with Cassander, Ptolemy and Lysimachus against the coalition of the new regent.Richard A. Billows, Antigonos the one-eyed and the creation of the Hellenistic State, p.84-85. In 318 BC, Antigonus drove Cleitus the White, the satrap of Lydia, out of his satrapy. Cleitus fled to Polyperchon who equipped him with a large fleet and sent him to take command of the Hellespont at the beginning of the summer of 317 BC.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica XVIII 72,2–3. Prelude Antigonus had spent the autumn and winter of 318 BC in western Asia Minor consolidating his position and gathering a fleet. He now sent Nicanor with a fleet of 100–130 ships to do battle against Cleitus in the Hellespont while he himself marched there with an army. Cleitus was in the Hellespont with a slightly larger fleet. The Battles The two fleets met in battle near Byzantium, Cleitus won a victory in which some 70 ships of Nicanor were captured, sunk or disabled, the remnant managing to escape to Chalcedon, where they were joined by Antigonus and his army. Antigonus ordered the remaining 60 ships to be readied for renewed action, and assigned his strongest and most loyal soldiers as marines to these ships. Meanwhile, the Byzantines transported his archers, slingers and peltast to the European shore, where Cleitus's victorious forces were encamped. At dawn the next day Antigonos launched an assault by land and sea and caught Cleitus completely by surprise; Cleitus’s entire force was captured or killed.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica XVIII 72,3–4. Aftermath Cleitus managed to escape with a single ship, but he was soon forced to run it aground and tried to reach Macedon by land. He was intercepted and executed by some soldiers working for Lysimachus . This brilliant stroke greatly enhanced Antigonus's reputation for military genius (he had won three stunning victories in a row) and freed him from further worry of Polyperchon interfering in Asia. He at once set out to deal with Eumenes who was causing trouble in Cilicia, Syria and Phoenicia.

Background Following their defeat at the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir and their evacuation from North Korea in December 1950, the US 1st Marine Division began a period of rest, reorganization and rehabilitation at Masan, South Korea about south of the UN's Main line of resistance. When the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) launched their Third Phase Campaign on 31 December 1950, the Korean People's Army (KPA) simultaneously attacked in eastern Korea breaking through the positions held by the Republic of Korea Army. As part of the KPA assault the 10th Division attacked towards Andong. The US Eighth Army alerted the 1st Marine Division to be ready to move northeast to Pohang, a fishing village about a third of the way up Korea's east coast, in order to protect Eighth Army lines of communication and backstop some shaky ROK divisions. The Pohang area had great strategic importance because it included a significant stretch of the Eighth Army main supply route (National Route 29), housed several key road junctions, included the only protected port on the east coast still in UN hands, and was the site of K-3 one of the few modern airfields in eastern Korea. This mission was confirmed on 8 January, but it had by then been modified to include the entire 1st Marine Division which was not assigned to a corps, but would instead be directly under Eighth Army operational control. The division staff cut orders on 9 January, and the Marines began moving out the next day with the maneuver elements going by truck and the support units by air, rail, and ship. Operation The operation began with a week-long movement from Masan to Pohang starting with the departure of the 1st Marine Regiment organized as a regimental combat team, on 10 January. A motor convoy carried elements of the 1st Marines; the division Reconnaissance Company; the 2nd Battalion, 11th Marines; Company C, 1st Engineers; and Company D, 1st Medical Battalion, on a 10-hour journey from Masan to Yongchon. Upon arrival at Uisong the next day, the regimental combat team began patrolling a section of road. Two days later, the reinforced 1st Battalion, moved north to occupy Andong. A key crossroads about inland from the sea, it was the site of US X Corps' rear headquarters as well as two dirt airstrips (one of which was long enough to handle cargo planes, but the other able only to service light observation aircraft and helicopters). With the arrival of the division's two other regimental combat teams, the 5th Marine Regiment patrolled the coast from Pohang to Yongdok and defended K-3, while the 7th Marine Regiment occupied centrally located Topyong-dong. The last Marine units disembarked from LSTs at Pohang on 17 January. Although there was some limited discussion about small-scale amphibious operations by Eighth Army commander General Matthew Ridgway when he visited the 1st Marine Division command post at Pohang, these never came to fruition. Instead, he ordered the Marines to defend an east-west line just north of the Andong-Yongdok Road and to simultaneously protect the north-south-running Eighth Army main supply route. General O. P. Smith faced a dilemma because he was at first uncertain about which of these assignments should receive the highest priority. Should he deploy to guard against an all-out attack on the main line of resistance by PVA/KPA regular forces from the north or be prepared for counter-guerrilla operations against small groups of infiltrators? Intelligence reports indicated that the latter was the most likely course of action. Small KPA bands had already proved extremely troublesome by intermittently cutting supply lines and occasionally attacking outposts between Wonju and Taegu so continued guerrilla actions were considered probable. General Smith was well aware that the Marines would not be manning an exposed position. Several ROK divisions screened the Marine northern flank, the Sea of Japan protected his eastern flank, and hilly terrain made the western approaches inaccessible to armor. Smith, therefore, decided to emphasize mobile security operations and made linear defense a secondary mission. The enemy threatening Pohang was believed to consist of about 6,000 light infantry troops from Major General Lee Ban Nam's 10th Division. Although a division in name, the 10th was short of personnel and lacked artillery, armor, and motor transport. Its only support weapons were a few heavy mortars and some heavy machine guns. These shortfalls limited General Lee's tactical options to hit-and-run raids, roadblocks, and ambushes. The 10th Division was, therefore, expected to conduct low-intensity operations remaining under cover during the day and attacking only in darkness. General Lee's troops seeped south through a hole in the fluid ROK lines east of the Hwacheon Reservoir in central Korea during the UN retreat from North Korea in late-December 1950, and the division's lead elements were thought to be just arriving in the Pohang area in mid-January. The 1st Marine Division zone of action was roughly square, an area composed of 1,600 square miles of extremely rugged interior terrain enclosed by a semicircular road network joining the coastal villages of Pohang and Yongdok with the inland towns of Andong and Yongchon. miles of the vital Eighth Army main supply route were located inside the Marine zone. That part of the supply route ran north from Kyongju to Yongchon then bent about westward until it once again turned north to pass through Andong. A secondary road (Route 48) joined Andong in the northwest corner with centrally located Chinbo and Yongdok on the coast. The valley lowlands were dotted with small villages whose adjoining terraced rice paddies edged roadways and agricultural flat lands. The center of the Marine area of responsibility consisted of snow- capped mountains traversed only by a series of winding trails and narrow pathways that worked their way up and down the steep ridges. The weather was generally cold and often damp with frequent snow flurries, but with little accumulation. The occasional high winds and overcast hindered flight operations and limited visibility. On 16 January, General Smith opened a forward command post at Sinhung, about southeast of Pohang. Division Operations Order 3-51 assigned the Marines three missions. One was to protect the Kyongju-Pohang-Andong portion of the main supply route. A second was to secure the village of Andong and the two nearby airstrips. The third mission was to prevent penetration in force of the Andong-Yongdok defense line. The long-service veterans of the 1st Marine Division were well aware of the travails of guerrilla warfare. A few senior officers and veteran sergeants had fought local insurgents during the Banana Wars, some others had fought Chinese guerrillas in North China after World War II, and most field grade officers had closely studied the Small Wars Manual at Quantico. These veteran campaigners knew that counter-guerrilla operations were primarily small unit actions that tested individual stamina and required strong leadership at the fire team, squad, and platoon levels. Accordingly, General Smith decentralized operations. He created five defensive areas, formed mechanized task forces to patrol the roads, and saturated the hilly terrain with infantry patrols to keep the KPA constantly on the move. The 1st Marines, at Andong, was assigned Zone A in the northwest; the 5th Marines manned Zone B from Yongchon in the southwest quadrant; the 7th Marines operated out of Topyong-dong in Zone C, a centrally located by corridor running north from Pohang; the 11th Marine Regiment held a narrow coastal strip north of Pohang known as Zone D; and the 1st Tank Battalion operated in Zone E southeast of Pohang. The light utility aircraft of VMO-6 were in general support. Anti-guerrilla doctrine called for constant vigilance by static units and aggressive action by mobile forces. A commander's primary concern was force protection, and the best way to accomplish that was to keep the enemy off balance. Guerrillas had to be located, engaged, rendered ineffective, and relentlessly pursued to do this. For large units (regiments or battalions) the favored tactics were \\"raking\\" operations and encirclements. Smaller infantry units relied upon saturation patrols to find, fix, and eliminate the enemy. Most of these so-called \\"rice paddy patrols\\" consisted of fire teams and squads operating from platoon or company patrol bases. The 5th Marines was particularly aggressive and once had 29 such patrols in the field at the same time. Ambushes were an effective way to keep the enemy off balance by hindering movement and destroying small units piecemeal. Squad and platoon-sized ambushes set up nightly along mountain trails or fanned out to cover likely avenues of approach to nearby villages. Motorized road patrols consisted of machine gun-mounted jeeps that roved the main supply route at irregular intervals. Convoys were escorted by gun trucks, tanks, or self-propelled guns. The anti-guerilla campaign placed a heavy burden on the firing batteries of the 11th Marines. Once the patrols had tracked down groups of KPA, the regiment's batteries had to fire on short notice and in any direction. The constant patrols harried the KPA and kept it on the run. General Lee's troops were forced to break up into ever-shrinking groups just to survive. Soon, hard-pressed guerrilla bands were reduced to foraging instead of fighting. The first contact with the KPA in the Pohang zone occurred on the afternoon of 18 January. A patrol from 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines, discovered an unknown number of KPA east of Andong. The KPA quickly fled, but three were captured. These prisoners from the 27th Regiment confirmed their parent unit was the 10th KPA Division and reported that elements of that division's 25th and 29th Regiments were also in the area. Four days later a patrol from the 1st Marines discovered an estimated KPA battalion near Mukkye-dong south of Andong just before sunset and promptly got the best of a one-sided exchange of small arms and mortars. Company C suffered no casualties while the KPA lost about 200 killed or wounded. Nightfall prevented full pursuit and the KPA escaped under cover of darkness by breaking into squad and platoon-sized exfiltration groups. On 24 January, the 7th Marines began a three-day raking operation to clear the KPA from its zone of action. The KPA retaliated by hitting the regimental command post at Topyong- dong and the 1st Battalion to the northwest, but both attacks by the KPA 25th Regiment failed. On the 26th, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines isolated a KPA company atop Hill 466 that held the attackers at bay with mortars, small arms and hand grenades. The Marines answered with their own artillery, mortars, and automatic weapons. The outgunned KPA quickly abandoned the position after suffering an estimated 50 dead and about twice that many wounded. That same afternoon, 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines repulsed a KPA counterattack and counted 44 dead in the aftermath. During the entire operation, the 7th Marines reported KPA losses at about 250 killed and 500 wounded with a dozen prisoners taken. As a consequence of these losses General Lee ordered his troops to cease offensive operations until they could withdraw into the mountains to regroup. The actions at Pohang thus far typified the frustrations of anti- guerrilla warfare. On every occasion the Marines hammered their opponents but were unable to pin down the elusive KPA so decisive action could be affected. 7th Marines commander Colonel Homer Litzenberg said \\"It became a game, we would find them about 14:00 in the afternoon, get our artillery on them, air on them, and then they would disappear. The next day we would have to find them again.\\" This pattern continued throughout January and February 1951, much as it had in the Moro Rebellion in the Philippines at the turn of the century and would again in the Vietnam War little more than a decade later. But as Litzenburg noted, \\"the operations in this area constituted a very, very successful field exercise from which we derived great benefit.\\" General Smith's aide de camp said \\"It was excellent training for the new replacements, it gave them the opportunity of getting a conditioning, and an experience of the hardest type of warfare, mountainous warfare, and fast moving situations. They also had the opportunity to utilize supporting fire of all types, including naval gunfire.\\" In late January Colonel Kim Sung Eun's 1st Korean Marine Corps Regiment (KMC) joined the 1st Marine Division. The Korean Marine regiment brought four rifle battalions (1st, 2nd, 3rd and independent 5th). The original Korean Marines had trained under the tutelage of the 5th Marines while en route to Inchon the previous September. They fought well beside the 1st Marine Division during the liberation of Seoul before being detached for other duties. The Korean Marines were attached administratively to the 1st Marine Division on 21 January, but were not trucked up from Chinhae until about a week later. On 29 January the KMC command post was in place at Yongdok. General Smith created a new sector in the northeast to accommodate the new arrivals. This area, Zone F, included Yongdok, Chaegok-tong and Chinandong. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions patrolled subsectors in Zone F while the 5th Battalion worked with the 1st Marines. The US Marines provided combat and logistics support for their South Korean counterparts. The KMC acquitted themselves well at Pohang and the KMC 1st Regiment would become the 1st Marine Division's fourth rifle regiment for the remainder of the war. KPA prisoners confirmed signal intercepts and agent reports that the 10th Division had been ordered to leave Pohang to rejoin the KPA II Corps. Concurrently, aerial observers noted a general movement to the west out of the 7th Marines’ Zone C into Zones A and B (1st and 5th Marines, respectively). The resulting attempts to slip out of the Marine noose resulted in several very one-sided clashes during the first week of February. On the night of 31 January-1 February, a company-sized patrol from the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, engaged an estimated KPA battalion near Sanghwa-dong. The KPA suffered about 50 casualties and three KPA were captured along with several mortars and small arms. A few days later 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines and 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines pushed fleeing KPA troops into blocking positions manned by the KMC 22nd Company during a successful \\"hammer-and-anvil\\" combined operation. In the 7th Marines zone of action, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines killed about 45 in a sharp action northwest of Wolmae-dong, and 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines overcame fierce resistance to take Hill 1123. To the southwest, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines destroyed four roadblocks, killed 30 , and captured three more in the vicinity of Yongchon. 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines occupied Hill 930 after ejecting some stubborn KPA defenders. Along the northern coast, Colonel Kim's Korean Marines took Paekchadong and forced its defenders to scatter. A unique approach was tried on 4 February when a loudspeaker-equipped Marine R4D Skytrain transport plane broadcast appeals to surrender. About 150 individuals answered the call, but most of them turned out to be South Korean laborers who had been forced into service by the KPA. F4U Corsairs from VF-323 then dropped bombs, rockets and Napalm upon the remaining KPA. The last major action of the guerrilla hunt occurred when two battalions of the 1st Marines routed an estimated battalion of the KPA 27th Regiment, south of Samgŏ-ri. More than 75 were killed and an unknown number were seriously wounded by the time the KPA fled the field of battle on 5 February. Only scattered resistance by diehard individuals or small groups was reported to headquarters from then until the Marines departed Pohang. deserters told interrogators that disease and low morale took a heavy toll. They reported a KPA battalion commander had been shot for desertion and that General Lee was immobilized by severe depression. Other indicators of KPA desperation were that women were increasingly being drafted to serve as porters and combat troops were donning captured American clothing to cover their escape. Although the 10th Division still could muster about 1,000 men, captured dispatches indicated PVA headquarters ordered the remaining KPA to break out of the Marine encirclement. General Smith's situation report to Eighth Army headquarters on 11 February stated that the KPA had been appreciably reduced and declared \\"the situation in the Division area is sufficiently in hand to permit the withdrawal of the Division and the assignment of another mission.\\" Armed with this knowledge, intelligence officers at Eighth Army rated the 10th Division as combat ineffective, and General Ridgway decided the 1st Marine Division could be put to better use elsewhere. Aftermath Marine losses during the period 12 January to 15 February numbered 26 dead, 148 wounded and 10 missing in action. There were also a large number of non-battle casualties, primarily the result of frostbite or minor injuries, most returned to their units. casualties and non- combat losses were estimated at more than 3,000 men. The Pohang Operation had proven useful for training and physical conditioning of the 1st Marine Division. Constant movement over rough terrain ensured the Marines were in good shape, rifle squads and mortar sections developed into coherent and tactically proficient units, and most of the 3,387 Marine replacements got at least a brief taste of combat conditions. On 12 February 1951, General Smith received a warning order to prepare the 1st Marine Division to move to Chungju in south-central Korea on 24 hours' notice at any time after 07:00, 14 February. Beginning on 16 February, the Marines mounted out from Pohang by regimental combat teams for Chungju. By that time the PVA and KPA were being pounded by air and artillery until their attacks ran out of steam north of Wonju. Thus, when the Marines finally arrived at Chungju, they could be used to spearhead a UN counteroffensive, Operation Killer. The assessment of the status of the KPA 10th Division would prove to be incorrect; the division had maintained a formal organization of a headquarters and three regiments and with a surviving strength of about two thousand and had managed by the opening of Operation Ripper on 7 March 1951 to slip north through the Taebaek Mountains to the Irwol Mountain region, northeast of Andong. Easily withstanding further efforts of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division to eliminate it, the division by 13 March reached the Chungbong Mountain area, about miles south of Gangneung. The remnants of the division, approximately 1000 men eventually returned to KPA lines on 23 March 1951, however the division would not see frontline action again.

A 1915 graduate of the United States Military Academy (\\"The class the stars fell on\\"), Watson served in the Pancho Villa Expedition and World War I. During World War II, Watson commanded the 3rd Armored Division from August 1942 to August 1944. Concerned that he was not leading the division effectively during combat in France, his superior, Omar Bradley, a West Point classmate and lifelong friend, relieved him of duty. Rather than request a stateside assignment that would allow him to keep his temporary rank, Watson agreed to accept a reduction in rank in order to remain in France. Watson was reduced in rank to colonel and assigned to the staff of Bradley's Twelfth United States Army Group. Soon afterwards, Brigadier General Norman Cota was transferred from assignment as assistant division commander of the 29th Infantry Division to commander of the 28th Infantry Division and promoted to major general. Watson was selected to replace Cota at the 29th Infantry Division. In November 1944, he was again promoted to brigadier general, reclaiming general officer's rank less than three months after his demotion. In August 1945, Watson was appointed to command the 79th Infantry Division, which he led until it was inactivated in December 1945. Following the war, Watson served as commander of the International Military Tribunal Command in Germany, where he worked to enhance security and ensure that none of the Nazis on trial for war crimes were able to escape. His later assignments included chief of Civil Affairs for the U.S. Far East Command and commander of US Defense Advisory Group, Japan. In early 1953 he was promoted to major general, and he retired later that year. After retiring, Watson lived in Beverly Hills, California, where he served on the city council and was mayor from 1962 to 1963. He died in Beverly Hills on February 12, 1975 and was buried at West Point Cemetery. Early life Leroy H. Watson was born in St. Louis, Missouri on November 3, 1893, the son of furrier George Washington Watson and Sarah Ann (Callahan) Watson. He attended the public schools of St. Louis and was a 1910 graduate of McKinley High School. Watson received appointment to the United States Military Academy in 1911. He graduated in 1915, a member of \\"The class the stars fell on\\", and was ranked 151st of 164. Watson was appointed a second lieutenant of Infantry and initially assigned to border security with the 22nd Infantry Regiment at Camp Harry J. Jones, Arizona during the Pancho Villa Expedition. He was soon transferred to the 11th Infantry and promoted to first lieutenant. He received his promotion to captain in May 1917. World War I In June 1917, Watson was transferred to the 51st Infantry, a unit of the 6th Division. He served as regimental exchange officer and regimental adjutant before commanding a battalion, and briefly commanded the regiment during the first week of November. The 51st Infantry arrived in France in June 1918, and Watson was promoted to major in July. He was the regimental adjutant for most of the war, and took part in combat from August until its end in November, including the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. After the Armistice, Watson remained in Germany as part of the Army of Occupation. He returned to the United States in June 1919 and demobilized with his regiment at Camp Grant, Illinois on June 19. Post-World War I After his regiment was demobilized, Watson remained at Camp Grant and served as a recruiting officer. He graduated from the Infantry School's course for field grade officers in 1921. After graduating, Watson was retained at the Infantry School as an instructor, where he remained until 1925. In 1922 he was reduced to his permanent rank of captain, and he was promoted to major again in September 1925. In October 1925, Watson arrived for duty in the Panama Canal Zone, and he successively commanded 3rd Battalion, 42nd Infantry (1925-1927), and 3rd Battalion, 33rd Infantry (1927-1928). In 1928, Watson returned to the United States to become a student at the Command and General Staff College. He graduated in 1930 and remained at the college to serve as an instructor. In 1934, Watson graduated from the Chemical Warfare School's course for field grade officers, and he was also a 1934 graduate of the United States Army War College. Later that year he was posted to Fort McPherson, Georgia. In 1936 Watson received assignment to the Army general staff in Washington. In 1937 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In 1940 he was assigned to the staff of the Philippine Department. World War II From 1946's The Cross of Lorraine: A Combat History of the 79th Infantry Division, June 1942-December 1945 At the start of World War II, Watson completed the Tank Officer's Course and was assigned as executive officer of the 66th Armor Regiment. He was promoted to colonel in 1941 and assigned to command 40th Armored Regiment, 3rd Armored Brigade. When the Army reorganized its armor forces into divisions in February 1942, it created three brigade-level Combat Commands in each. Originally named 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Combat Commands, these organizations were later re-designated Combat Commands A, B, and R (Reserve). When the 3rd Armored Division was fielded in 1942, Watson was named commander of the division's 1st Combat Command (Combat Command A) and promoted to brigadier general. In August 1942, Watson was named commander of the 3rd Armored Division and promoted to major general. After completing its organization and training in Louisiana, California, and Pennsylvania, the organization arrived in Somerset, England in June 1943, where it continued to train. Watson led 3rd Armored Division during combat in France beginning in late June 1944 as part of First United States Army. Unhappy with the division's progress in Normandy, in early August 1944, VII Corps commander J. Lawton Collins decided to relieve Watson of command. Collins’ superior, Omar Bradley, a West Point classmate of Watson's, initially disagreed with Collins, but ultimately decided to concur with Collins’ decision. Watson was replaced by Maurice Rose. When Watson was relieved of command, he requested to remain in the area of combat operations in France at any rank rather than return to the United States in a training or administrative role with a general's rank. Impressed by Watson's request, Bradley informed his superior Dwight Eisenhower (another of Watson's West Point classmates) at Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAFE), and they agreed to retain Watson in France. He was reduced in rank to colonel and assigned to Bradley's staff at Twelfth United States Army Group Headquarters. On August 14, Norman Cota, the assistant division commander of the 29th Infantry Division, was promoted to major general and assigned to command the 28th Infantry Division. After considering possible replacements for Cota, Bradley and Eisenhower decided on Watson. (The 29th Division fell under XIX Corps, not VII Corps, which meant the 29th's leaders would not report to Collins, a circumstance that likely factored into Bradley and Eisenhower's decision.) Watson served with the 29th Division during combat in France and Germany throughout the rest of 1944 and early 1945. In December 1944, he was promoted to brigadier general. In August 1945, Watson was appointed to command the 79th Infantry Division, which he led during post-war occupation duty in Germany until it was inactivated in December 1945. Post- World War II Following the war, Watson served as commander of the International Military Tribunal Command in Germany, where he worked to enhance security and ensure that none of the Nazis on trial for war crimes were able to escape. His later assignments included command of Sixth United States Army's Southern District, command of Fort Lewis in Washington state, chief of Civil Affairs for the U.S. Far East Command, and commander of US Defense Advisory Group, Japan. In early 1953 he was promoted to major general, and he retired later that year. Civilian career After retiring from the Army, Watson resided in Beverly Hills, California and was appointed assistant to the president of Fletcher Aviation, with responsibility for providing oversight, advice and guidance for Fletcher's military aviation projects and programs. He was subsequently promoted to vice president and retired from Fletcher following a 1961 heart attack. A Republican, Watson also served for eight years on the Beverly Hills City Council beginning in 1960. From 1962 to 1963 he served as mayor after being elected by a vote of his peers on the council. In 1965, Dwight Eisenhower authored a Reader's Digest article on leadership, and cited Watson's relief as commander of the 3rd Armored Division and request to remain in France at a lower rank as a notable example of selfless service. In an interview about the article, Watson began to object to the way Eisenhower had characterized his pre-relief performance, but then stopped himself and told the reporter that most of the details in Eisenhower's article were correct, and there was no point in arguing about the rest. Death and burial Watson died in Beverly Hills on February 12, 1975. He was buried at West Point Cemetery. Awards Watson's military awards included: *Silver Star with oak leaf cluster *Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster *Bronze Star Medal with oak leaf cluster *Army Commendation Medal with oak leaf cluster *Mexican Border Service Medal *World War I Victory Medal with two campaign clasps *Army of Occupation of Germany Medal *American Defense Service Medal *American Campaign Medal *European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with two campaign stars *World War II Victory Medal *Army of Occupation Medal with \\"Germany\\" clasp *National Defense Service Medal *Legion of Honor (France) *Croix de Guerre (France) Family Watson was married four times. In 1915, he married Alice Virginia Furey (1896–1942). They were the parents of four children - Sarah (Sally, a nun in the Sisters of Charity) (1916-2005), Leroy Jr. (1917-1959), Margaret (Peggy) (1921-2013), and Robert (1933-1990). In 1943, Watson married Elizabeth Livingston (1891-1958), and they divorced at the end of World War II. While stationed in Germany after the war, he married Liba J. Besin (1923-1949), a native of Czechoslovakia, with whom he had a daughter, Antoinette. In 1950, he married Beulah Beatrice (Beggs) Pellekaan (1890-1990) of Beverly Hills, the widow of a Shell Oil Company executive.

Biography  Salhoov was born in Kiryat Ekron in 1963, to Libyan immigrants to Israel. She attended the May Boyar residential high school in Jerusalem, which she cites as a watershed in her personal development: The Mizrahi girl from a traditionally religious family from Israel's social and geographical periphery, found herself trying to fit into these privileged Ashkenzi liberal Western academic and social environs. Salhoov calls is \\"secular indoctrination\\", and points out how the pathway to success – in terms of Israeli hegemonic society – was preordained for students in her school: Enlist to the \\"right\\" army unit, get the \\"right\\" professional degree, listen to the \\"right\\" music. Only she found herself at constant odd and conflict between her inner self and he external surrounding, conflict which is at the heart of her literary work. During her compulsory military service, Salhoov worked as a writer for \\"Bamahane\\", the military magazine. She then went on to study film at Beit Zvi Academy, and completed a master's degree in Jewish philosophy at the Tel Aviv University. Her time in film school caused her a mental breakdown. In an interview with \\"Haaretz\\", Salhoov relates how the social and class gaps were even more pronounced in this setting, how parents were expected to fund productions, and how her desire to create work relating to Jewish spirituality was stamped out. After her studies she returned to her parents' home, only to find out that her time away, since the age of 12, changed her in ways that made her feel foreign here as well. Her wish to read and study her father's holy texts was forbidden, and she cites this moment as when she understood the meaning of patriarchy. Here, too, she experienced conflict – her parents sent her away to school out of love, to give her the best opportunities; and yet, within their walls she had to regress. She took this pain, and translated it into literature. Her first book, a collection of short prose, Onat Hameshugaim (Season of the Lunatics) came out in 1996. In 2000, she wrote a children's book and in 2003, her first poetry collection came out, Ir VeNasheiha (A City and Its Women). The book won the Yehuda Amichai Literary Award. She has since published additional volumes of essays and poetry. Her 2011 book, Torat HaHitukhim (The Theory of Intersecting) blends poetry and prose with word of visual art, and includes critiques on both the secularization of Israel, and the politicization of religion in the country, stating that Israel is \\"missing its spiritual goals\\", and must face its position as a Middle Eastern country, and stop pretending to be part of Europe. These themes are also found in her 2005 novel, Ma Yesh Lakh, Ester (What's the Matter, Esther?). Throughout, she also expresses her feminist self, by describing contrasting contemporary and traditional roles and behaviors of men and women. Salhoov is regularly published in literary journals, such as Odot and Theory & Criticism. She is an art critic, who writes regularly for newspapers and magazines. She also curates art exhibits.

The film is a real fairy tale, it's not just the fear of a poltergeist’s room, but behind the mysterious elf, and who's the boss house. The film stars Sergey Chirkov, Yekaterina Guseva, Aleksandra Politik, Olga Ostroumova-Gutshmidt, and Pavel Derevyanko voiced the cat Kuzya. The film was theatrically released in Russia on April 11, 2019 by Karoprokat. Plot The realtor Ella unsuccessfully tries to sell an apartment in the Seven Sisters in Moscow, since the real Domovoy lives in it, who painstakingly survives any tenants from it, arranging them with various kinds of tricks a la poltergeist (people are unable to see or touch Domovoy himself). Because of this, the apartment has not been repaired for a long time and therefore the price for it is much lower than the market. In the end, she manages to find a potential buyer this is a divorced single mother Vika with her 8-year-old daughter Alina. Before the arrival of Vika and Alina, Ella invites the clairvoyant Fima to the apartment to drive Domovoy away. Fima succeeds: with the help of her magic rituals, she throws him out of the house. However, at some point, she has a vision in which she sees that somewhere under the floor in the apartment is hidden a box of jewels. Since the apartment is about to leave Vika and it will no longer be possible to penetrate it, Fima, leaving, again performs a ritual, thanks to which Domovoy returns to the apartment and begins to commit atrocities. In the end, Ella, threatening to put only inveterate marginals into the apartment from now on, sets Domovoy a condition: he will allow Vika to buy an apartment (because every time Ella receives the interest due from the apartment), and then she can safely drive her away, and in return for Ella, for a whole year will leave the apartment alone. Domovoy agrees, after which he applies his magic to the frightened Vika and Alina, who calm down and agree to the deal. Attempts to survive Vika with her daughter, Domovoy takes immediately. But Vika is not ready to lose the apartment: after learning from Raisa’s neighbor about Domovoy and about the previous tenants, she begins to invite psychics and shamans to the house. And the more she resists Domovoy, the more he shows zeal in his mischief. Alina, on the contrary, is trying to make friends with Domovoy, and at some point he even penetrates her with tender feelings, but at the same time is not going to stop. This leads to the fact that Vika is first fired from work (after Domovoy’s leprosy brought her boss to hospitalization), and then she accidentally gets an electric shock and she goes to the hospital. After this, Domovoy has a conversation with the cat of Alina and Vika (who can see Domovoy and communicate with him). It turns out that Domovoy has been living in this apartment since the construction of the house and got along very well with the first family of new settlers. But after some time this family moved, and Domovoy was forced to stay, because the Domovoy’s can change their place of residence only if they receive an invitation. He tried to make friends with the following new residents, but each new family turned out to be worse than the previous one, because there was neither love nor kindness in them. At some point, Domovoy discovered that the negative environment around him was projecting his own perception of this onto the apartment itself - the walls began to mold and crumble. Wishing to prevent the apartment from collapsing, Domovoy eventually decided to survive all the new tenants. The cat Kuzya then advises Domovoy to make peace with Vika anyway, because she and Alina, in fact, are exactly who he needs: Vika resisted Domovoy primarily in order to secure Alina. Kuzya also claims that if he still survives Vika and Alina, then new owners will come after them, with whom Domovoy will again have a war and everything will be repeated indefinitely. Then Domovoy agrees. Taking advantage of Vika's hospitalization, Fima and her son Stas enter The apartment (here Domovoy explains to Kuzya that the jewelry they are looking for remained from one of the previous residents who was buying up stolen goods). Vika and Alina return home inopportunely. Despite the magic that Fima exposes Domovoy, he still manages to give her and Stas a powerful rebuff and throw them out of the apartment. Alina at some point, fleeing from Stas crawls out the window and falls from the ledge, but Domovoy manages to throw her in the window located on the floor below the apartment where the young guy Andrey lives, who then begins an affair with Vika. In the finals, Vika apologizes to Domovoy, offers to make peace, and then shows that she now knows what he looks like: their neighbor Valentina has a hobby to photograph all the former tenants of the apartment at the moment they leave her, and in the photograph he took that the moment when Alina and Vika ran out of the apartment (this happened on the first night after they moved in) Domovoy was somehow imprinted. Vika invites Domovoy to become a full member of their family.

He was the founder of Bank Niaga and the shipping firm . Originating from a Javanese family, Soedarpo was active in the Indonesian nationalist movement during his education and later became a press officer for the government. After some time as a diplomat in the United States, he started his own business of distribution and shipping, later expanding to financial services and eventually becoming one of the most successful businessmen in Indonesia. Early life and career Soedarpo was born in Pangkalan Susu, in what is today Langkat Regency of North Sumatra on 30 June 1920, the seventh of nine siblings. He was of Javanese origins, and his father was a clerk for the civil administration of Dutch East Indies. When he was a child, his family moved to Medan, where he went to elementary school. Following his father's death in 1929, Soedarpo's family moved to Yogyakarta, where Soedarpo began his education at an Algemene Middelbare School. By the 1930s, he and his older brother Soebadio moved to Batavia where they enrolled in medical studies. During their time in Batavia, both siblings were active in liberal and radical Indonesian nationalist organizations, and were influenced by Sutan Sjahrir. In 1943, the brothers and Soedjatmoko went directly to Sukarno to criticize his cooperation with the Japanese occupiers. Also in that year, he was expelled from the medical school after participating in protests against the requirement for students to attend daily Japanese flag raising ceremony and bowing towards Tokyo. After this, Soedarpo withdrew from politics for some time, though he remained in contact with Sjahrir. Post- independence Following the proclamation of Indonesian independence, Soedarpo began to work at the Indonesian Ministry of Information's Foreign Section, due to his relative proficiency in English. He was noted as Indonesia's \\"first government PR officer\\". Later, he and Soedjatmoko was sent as an envoy from Sjahrir to Sukarno in a successful attempt to find and persuade the latter to allow the formation of a government led by a prime minister. In another occasion as an envoy, he convinced Sukarno to negotiate the 1946 Linggadjati Agreement. Soedarpo joined the Indonesian Socialist Party upon its formation in 1948, and helped launch a Dutch-language weekly paper Het Inzicht in addition to working at English publication Voice of Indonesia. He also worked at the Ministry of Defence under Amir Sjarifudin. Soedarpo was sent to New York as a press officer in 1948 and he later became part of the Indonesian delegation at the 1949 Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference. During his time in New York and later the Indonesian Embassy in Washington, D.C., aside from attempting to secure recognition of Indonesian sovereignty, Soedarpo was tasked with administering the Indonesian foreign exchange. He also became the Indonesian representative to the United Nations Security Council. He left diplomatic service in 1952. Business career After returning from the United States, Soedarpo decided against working for the government and began working as a director in Zorro Corporation, a distributor company for Remington typewriters and RCA products owned by American Matthew Fox. While Zorro held monopoly rights for the distribution from the two companies, it failed to secure domestic distribution licenses, causing Soedarpo to leave the company and start the NVDP Soedarpo Corporation in 1952. After securing the import license, Soedarpo took over distribution rights from Zorro in a profit- sharing scheme. In 1958, he secured rights to distribute UNIVAC units. He also obtained contracts and import licenses for military vehicles. He borrowed money from Hamengkubuwono IX to purchase a 75 percent stake at Dutch-owned shipping company Indonesian Shipping and Transport (ISTA) in 1953, and became its managing director. The following year, he managed to secure lucrative agencies with German Hapag and Japanese Tokyo Senpaku Kaisha shipping lines to Indonesia. He also acquired Dutch stevedoring firm Stroohoeden Veem in 1956. In 1964, ISTA and the stevedoring companies under Soedarpo's control were merged into a single firm, Samudera Indonesia. Soedarpo also founded insurance company Asuransi Bintang and Bank Niaga in 1955. By 1986, Soedarpo controlled 21 companies. Dutch historian Thomas Lindblad noted that Soedarpo \\"reputedly became the single most successful indigenous capitalist of the Sukarno period\\". In the 1980s, the Soedarpo group of companies had the third largest sales amongst companies controlled by pribumi entrepreneurs. By 1997, when Samudera Indonesia stock was floated in the Singapore Stock Exchange, Soedarpo was its chairman. In 2006, Forbes placed him 37th in their list of 40 richest Indonesians, placing his net worth at US$100 million. In 1995, President Suharto awarded Soedarpo with the Bintang Mahaputera Pratama. Personal life and family During his time at AMS, Soedarpo was a hurdling athlete, winning the Javanese hurdling championship of 1940. Soedarpo was also a member of Rotary International, becoming one of its district governors. He was married to Minarsih Wiranatakoesoemah, with three children, six grandchildren, and two grand-grandchildren at the time of his death. Death Soedarpo died in Jakarta on 22 October 2007. He was buried in the Tanah Kusir Public Cemetery.

Rules My Ship Sails may be played by four to seven players with a 52-card French-suited pack. The aim of the game is to be the first player to collect seven cards all of one suit. Each player is dealt 7 cards and the rest are set aside. Players pick up their hand and discard one card to the table. When everyone has done that, each player picks up the discard on his right, which becomes part of his hand. The first player to collect 7 cards of the same suit, says \\"my ship sails\\" and lays her hand, face up, on the table. If two players go out simultaneously, there are two options for deciding the winner: either the first player to say \\"my ship sails\\" wins or the player with the highest ranking card wins.  Ochse, leg dich!  The 8 cards of the suit of Leaves from a Bavarian pack Ochse, leg dich! (\\"Ox, lie down!\\") is a German and Austrian variant played with 32 French or German cards (Skat pack). It is a simple, family card game that is often played with children and is useful for learning the card values and card suits. The aim of the game is to collect all eight cards of one suit. Dealer deals 8 cards to each of the four players. Forehand leads by passing a card of his choice to the player on his left - middlehand. Middlehand then passes a card to rearhand and so on in clockwise order. Play continues in this way until a player has collected all eight cards of one suit in his hand, whereupon he lays them face up on the table and declares \\"Ochse, leg dich!\\" or \\"Ox, lie down!\\" The winner then receives as many chips or gaming counters from each other player as that player has fallen short in collecting eight cards of the same suit. For example, if a player has only collected five cards of one suit, he pays 3 chips to the winner.  References   Literature  * Gööck, Roland (1967).

Schade (1943–2008) was an American artist who worked in a wide variety of styles. He created eccentric and colorful images of animals; intricate hand-sewn muslin sculptures containing chickens on architectural bases, and illustrated fold-out books, amongst other types of work. His output depicting animals did not strive for accurate, scientific observation, but rather used artistic license that still allowed for them to be identifiable. The media he used plays an important role in his work. These include handmade paper, paint applied broadly, a distinctive use of drypoint, and stitching that is evident on the cloth sculptures.  Biographical details  William B. Schade was born in Albany, New York in 1943 and was educated at Vincentian Institute and Christian Brothers Academy. He had an undergraduate degree from Southern Illinois University Carbondale and graduate degrees from the State University of New York at Albany (M.A. in printmaking) and the Cranbrook Academy of Art (MFA in printmaking,1973). He had fellowships from the United States Information Agency and the National Endowment for the Arts, as well as a Fulbright. He had residencies at the MacDowell Colony and Yaddo.University Art Museum (1999). The Wild Wonderful World of William B. Schade. Albany, NY: University at Albany. He taught for over thirty years in the art department at The Sage Colleges in Troy and Albany, NY. Later in life, Schade suffered from both Parkinson's disease and Alzheimers. He died in 2008 in Williamstown, Massachusetts.  Art work  William B. Schade's works focused on animals, both two and three dimensional. These works include drawings, books, drypoints, lithographs, monoprints, paintings, scrolls, temples, sculptures, and furniture. There were poster-like drawings with the names and descriptions or notable features of each creature. For example, his gouache painting, the Gazza Yam Gaydor (Schade was dyslexic and misspellings are evident in his written notes) is described as \\"a bad mood reptile.\\" Notes on the work indicate that the tail is \\"knowned to smack hippoes silly\\" and the creature eats about \\"ninety yams a day.\\" His humor is represented throughout his work. His acrylic on linen paining of the Wild Ass Lavender Fowl describes the species: > This breed of chicken was found in the Upper Bronx in 1983, by a city > demolishion team, in a abandoned apt. building. The bird numbered at the > time about 500. These numbers have drastically dropped, because of the lack > of aluminum beer & soda cans on the streets. Since N.Y.S. has passed a > returnable container law, cans are no longer thrown around. Which has caused > the bird numbers to diminish greatly. For the can was the fowls only source > of good old American food.\\" Schade used the theme of Noha's (Schade's spelling of Noah's) Ark in a number of his works. These include extremely detailed deck plans of the ark, including the arrangements of the animals and why they are located where they are. He also created a book which describes the many problems Noah faced on the ark, and a series of animal caricatures. His 2018 exhibit at the Albany Institute of History & Art was described by reviewer William Jaeger: \\"Almost innocent, nearly childlike, practically playful. William B. Schade's world of invented and exaggerated animals dangles one foot in pure children's book illustration and plants the other in some strange, exquisite zone of the fine arts.\\" Schade, according to one art critic, has a special charm in that he is able to bring laughter to his viewers through his visual depictions, the labels and descriptions on those works, and his misspellings that add extra effect. While Schade's work is normally quite colorful, his series of fabric sculptures and his sculptures crafted in porcelain are off-white–he used a natural-colored muslin cloth in the case of the fabric sculptures.

It covers the processes that can be taken by conservators, archivists, and other museum professionals. This practice includes understanding the composition and agents of deterioration of dye diffusion transfer prints, as well as the preventive conservation and interventive conservation measures that can be taken. History of dye diffusion transfer prints Charlotte Frenett in Jupiter, Florida Dye diffusion transfer prints are photographs made through a process where film containing chemical reagents is developed by an instant camera specifically designed for that purpose.Dye diffusion transfer prints. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/tgm003421/ The practice that created dye diffusion transfer prints was first introduced by Edwin H. Land in 1947, who called the technique the Polaroid-Land process. These initial prints were made in sepia tone, and as chemistry progressed, true black and white prints were launched by 1950, and color prints followed in 1963.Edwin Land and Instant Photography. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/land- instant-photography.html#color_instant_photography Sometimes, dye diffusion transfer prints are referred to as instant film due to their quick processing, or by the brand name Polaroid as this was the company to first introduce the technology to the public. Kodak launched their own version in 1976, and Fujifilm in 1981. Dye diffusion transfer prints are useful in private and professional spheres, as well as in places they intersect.Exploring the Cultural Impact of Polaroid. (n.d.).

For example, they can function as a way to document everyday life, provide critical up-to-the minute medical or investigatory data, or may be used as a form of art. Professionals such as Ansel Adams and Marie Cosindas were early adaptors of the artform, even partnering with camera manufacturers to have their own equipment tailor-made to their needs.Sposato, B.

(n.d.). Retrieved April 21, 2019, from https://www.culturalheritage.org/ This work includes negotiating the best practices of preventive-conservation in collections care and determining when and what type of treatments might be required, if necessary. In some circumstances, conservator-restorers may take a unique avenue to improve images of dye diffusion transfer prints in poor condition: using digital technology. Even this method is not a foolproof technique, as some prints, notably those made from film available at the end of the 1970s, experienced deterioration nearly immediately, and the ability to care for them can only go so far.Ctein. (2017). Digital restoration from start to finish how to repair old and damaged photographs. New York, NY: Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group. Preventive conservation Preventive conservation is a dimension of conservation-restoration that accounts for the need to prevent or mitigate artifacts from incurring damage.Druzik, J., & Levin, J. (2004). Newsletter 19.1 (Spring 2004). Conservation, 19.1, 10-11. In short, the practice recognizes the point made by Philip Ward that: \\"deterioration is not inevitable...Deterioration is reduced by controlling its causes.\\" Ward, Phillip R. 1986. Nature of Conservation, A Race Against Time. Santa Monica, CA: The J. Paul Getty Institute. Current best practices in this paradigm involve considering how to avoid the agents of deterioration, initially identified by Charlie Costain in 1994, as a list of key threats to artifacts.Canadian Conservation Institute (2017, September 26). Agents of deterioration. While some of these agents pose more of a concern to dye diffusion transfer prints than others, they are all potentially problematic towards them and must be considered.Caple, C. (2000). Conservation skills: Judgement, method and decision making. London: Routledge, Redondo, M. Is Minimal Intervention a Valid Guiding Principle? e-conservation Magazine. No. 5, June 2008. pp.33-38. =Agents of deterioration= The agents of deterioration are ten key factors that are identified to contribute to the risks faced by artifacts. While just one of these dynamics could cause irreversible damage, improper conditions or events could cause more than one of them to occur in tandem, effectively multiplying problems. ;Dissociation Dye diffusion transfer prints are objects vulnerable to dissociation, or the way in which the items themselves or data associated with them may be lost. Due to their relatively small size, approximately 10.75 x 0.1 x 8.85 cm, they may be fall into crevices, or become otherwise misplaced.Polaroid Originals photo dimensions. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://support.polaroidoriginals.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012363647-Polaroid- Originals-photo-dimensions ;Fire Fire is a potentially great risk for dye diffusion transfer prints in that it can either directly cause their complete destruction via burning or melting, or it may yield indirect damage through smoke exposure. Means of extinguishing nearby fires may cause water or chemical damage as well. ;Incorrect relative humidity Incorrect relative humidity or fluctuations in humidity can be a problem for dye diffusion transfer prints. Problems can include expansions of different layers of the film, as well as deterioration of colors. A consumer guide to traditional and digital print stability. (2008). Paintindia, 47(4), 165–171. ;Incorrect temperature The issue of temperature being too high, too low, or simply fluctuating can cause problems for dye diffusion transfer prints. Incorrect temperature alone can cause cracking, yellowing, or distortion, but also correlate with flammability and humidity problems. ;Ultraviolet and infrared light Radiation including visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light can affect dye diffusion transfer prints. Visible light is one of the most significant threats among the Agents of Deterioration for dye diffusion transfer prints, and can fade colors, a problem that cannot be reversed through conservation- restoration. Ulaby, N. (2017, July 30). How To Preserve Your Polaroid. Retrieved from https://www.npr.org/2017/07/30/540359419/how-to-preserve-your- polaroid Ultraviolet light can cause materials to weaken, and infrared can raise temperature, which in addition to the problems outlined above can magnify the damage by visible and ultraviolet light.Shelley, M. (1987). The care and handling of art objects practices in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art. ;Pests From microorganisms to rodents, pests pose a threat to dye diffusion transfer prints. Not only can they create cavities within the prints, they can leave byproducts on the materials leading to erosion. Museum handbook. (2007). Washington, D.C.: U.S. Dept. of the Interior, National Park Service. ;Physical forces Physical forces are largely caused when there is impact between objects. In the case of dye diffusion transfer prints, threats include cracking, chipping, abrasion, or structural failure, such as ripping. ;Pollutants Pollutants can affect dye diffusion transfer prints both from external sources and through the breakdown of internal structures. Whether the agent is airborne, transferred by contact, or is intrinsic, damages can include erosion, deposits, or discoloration. ;Thieves and vandals Thieves and vandals can cause both dissociation and damage. Outright theft of dye diffusion transfer prints can at worst be a total loss for the artifact as a relic of cultural heritage or at best, simply a lapse in collections care before it is recovered. Vandalization can include the problems identified by physical forces and may include more than one dimension of problems. ;Water Water, which can be a physical or chemical force, can bring about softening, swelling, staining, or physical forces to dye diffusion transfer prints. The impact of water damage can range from minimal to significant, such as in the formation of condensation or when the artifacts may be completely submerged in water. Many conditions can amplify damage, such as heat or time of exposure. =Storage= One of the most important ways to help artifacts of all kinds is to consider their storage both when they are being used and when they are packed away. Researchers Dusan Stulik and Art Kaplan acknowledge: \\"without knowing the chemical nature and physical structure of a photograph, it is difficult to prescribe conditions for its storage or exhibition that will help ensure its preservation, and it is difficult as well to determine appropriate conservation treatment.\\" Stulik, D. C., & Kaplan, A. (2012). Collaborative Research. Conservation Perspectives, 72, 1st ser., 1-32. Retrieved March 15, 2019, from https://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/pdf/v27n1.pdf However, certain best practices emerge within the conservation-restoration field to provide a blueprint. Acid-free boxes are a commonly recommended source for the storage of dye diffusion transfer prints. In addition, containers of polyester, aluminum, or glass may also provide adequate housing. Individual prints should be stored separately in sleeves or envelopes that are made of polypropylene or paper with high quantities of alphacellulose. In the unfortunate circumstance that prints must be stored together, they should be stored vertically to avoid warping or bending.Albright, G. & Fischer, M. Care of Photographs. Retrieved February 18, 2008, from Northeast Document Conservation Center website It is critical that prints be completely dry prior to storage. Wilker, A. (2004). The Composition and Preservation of Instant Films (Tech.). Austin, TX: University of Texas. Best practices indicate that storage conditions remain about 70° Fahrenheit (21° Celsius), and the relative humidity be kept between 30% and 50%. Treatment If dye diffusion transfer prints are not cared for though the tenants of preventive conservation, they may need to receive treatment. Generally, any work associated with physically altering a print would be the domain of a conservator-restorer. Treatment for dye diffusion transfer prints can range from directly contacting them, such as in repairing a crack or tear, separating them from materials that may adhere to them, including other prints, cleaning their surface, to establishing a protocol for storage as discussed above. Typically, the use of nitrile gloves to protect both the print and the person working to treat it would apply in this work. Buck, R. A. (2011). MRM5: Museum registration methods. Washington, DC: AAM Press. =Repair= Cracking One commonly occurring threat to dye diffusion transfer prints is cracking. Among the techniques that trained conservator-restorers may employ to mend them is filling the crack. One technique entails supporting the crack with Japanese paper, applying gelatin in careful phases, humidifying the object, and then flattening the print in a heated press.Hofmann, Ana B. Flattening Cracks in Photographs, 1991. Topics in Photographic Preservation 4:166-16 Water damage Another threat to dye diffusion transfer prints is water damage. Water damage is known to erode the surface of prints, and within two days, it may also encourage the conditions for mold growth. If the water damage is suspected, and the surface of a print is sticky to contact, then it should not be handled. However, if the surface appears intact, then the print may be rinsed in cool, clean water and then set aside to dry.Other Types of Photo Prints. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.fujifilm.com/support/photo_cleaning/other_types/index.html#See_All =Cleaning= Sometimes, dye diffusion transfer prints may require cleaning. In certain cases, this work would need to be supervised or completed by a professional conservator-restorer, but in other cases an untrained individual may be able to do the work. Attempts to clean a damaged print could lead to the surface material peeling away, and laypersons should be advised to consult advice before attempting such work on their own. In the circumstance that a print is in good condition, simple cleaning strategies may be employed to care for its condition. If the print is dry, any dirt may be carefully brushed off. If the print is wet, then it may be briefly submerged in a room temperature water bath (68°-86° Fahrenheit (20°-30° Celsius), to wash away any debris. After an initial wash in this technique, prints may be rinsed, and be set out on a flat, dry surface where dust cannot settle on the surface.

The database provides access to multiple types of data including physicochemical properties, environmental fate and transport, exposure, usage, in vivo toxicity, and in vitro bioassay. EPA and other scientists use the data and models contained within the dashboard to help identify chemicals that require further testing and reduce the use of animals in chemical testing. The Dashboard is also used to provide public access to information from EPA Action Plans, e.g. around perfluorinated alkylated substances., Originally titled the Chemistry Dashboard, the first version was released in 2016. The latest release of the database (version 3.0.5) contains manually curated data for over 875,000 chemicals and incorporates the latest data generated from the EPA's Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast) high-throughput screening program. The Chemicals Dashboard incorporates data from several previous EPA databases into one package including the ToxCast Dashboard, the Endocrine Disruption Screening Program (EDSP) Dashboard and the Chemical and Products Database (CPDat). Scope and Access The CompTox Chemicals Dashboard database contains high quality chemical structures and information that have been extensively curated and quality checked, which can be used as a resource for analytical scientists involved in structure identification. ToxCast bioactivity data view for Bisphenol A Chemical hazard data in the dashboard comes from both traditional laboratory animal studies and high-throughput screening. Biological data from high-throughput screening is generated by EPA's ToxCast program, the ToxCast data in the database provides information about the assays used and their response potency and efficacy. These data can be found in the bioactivity tab. The Chemicals Dashboard can be accessed via a web interface or sets of data within it can be downloaded for use offline. The Lists tab can be used to browse and download groups of related chemicals based on their relevance to a specific research topic (such as additives in cigarettes or chemicals demonstrating effects on neurodevelopmental effects) or the specific assay endpoints they are covered by. Within the online dashboard searches can be performed by product/use categories, assay/gene, systematic name, synonym, CAS number, DSSTox Substance ID or InChiKey. Under the Advanced Search tab chemicals can be searched based on their mass or molecular formula. Searches can also be performed for groups of chemicals based on Chemical Name CASRN, InChIKey, DSSTox Substance ID, DSSTox Compound ID, InChIKey Skeleton, MS-Ready Formula, Exact Formula, or Monoisotopic Mass using the batch search function. Other Functions Abstract Sifter module An automated read-across tool called Generalized Read-Across (GenRA) is integrated into The Chemicals Dashboard. GenRA is designed to keep the expert consideration inherent in the read-across method, but automate the chemical selection process to help predict toxicity. The Dashboard also has the capability to search existing scientific literature sources such as PubMed, via a web-based version of the \\"Abstract Sifter\\", Google Scholar and reports from EPA's Provisional Peer Reviewed Toxicity Values (PPRTV) and the EPA Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS). Real-time QSAR prediction for multiple physicochemical property and toxicity endpoints is available through the predictions tab. Supporting mass spectrometry  MS-Ready relationships The dashboard provides support for Mass spectrometry providing searches against the chemical data contained in the database based on mass and molecular formula. The dashboard has been applied to non-targeted analysis searching for \\"known unknowns\\". Both targeted mass spectrometry and non- targeted mass spectrometry are supported. The searches utilize a search based on \\"MS-Ready\\" forms of chemical compounds. Individual chemical substabces are collapsed into a form that would be detected by mass spectrometry such that salts are desalted and neutralized and multi-component chemicals are separated into their individual components.

He was the architect of Indonesia’s industralisation policies during 1937–1942 and 1946–1950.  1885–1911: Early life and military career  Sitsen was born in Bergen op Zoom on 11 January 1885 as the third of six children of Adrianus Wilhelmus Sitsen (1854–1900), a public school head master, and Maria Elisabeth van Mechelen (1856–1934). Sitsen completed high school in 1901 and continued studying engineering at the Royal Military Academy (KMA) in Breda.De Locomotief (3 September 1901). After graduating, Sitsen left for Indonesia in January 1907 to serve his contract in the colonial army (KNIL).Nieuws van den Dag voor Nederlandsch-Indië (30 July 1906). His first posting was as 2nd lieutenant in Kutaraja (now Banda Aceh) in Northern Sumatra.Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad (7 February 1907). By 1910 he was stationed as 1st lieutenant in Batavia (now Jakarta).  Marriage and artistic interests  In Jakarta, Sitsen met his wife, Dutch singer Maria Elizabeth (Marie) Russer (1884–1969) in 1910. Marie was a well-known soprano who sang at concerts in The Netherlands during 1904–1910. In 1910 she travelled with her friend, singer and pianist Annie van Velthuysen (1887–1965), to Singapore and Indonesia for a tour of concerts.The Straits Times, (19 July 1910). Sitsen was Russer’s piano accompanist at one of her performances in Jakarta. Russer settled in Jakarta to teach singing. Her engagement to Sitsen was announced in May 1911 and they married 12 October 1911.Nieuws van den Dag voor Nederlandsch-Indië (10 October 1911). They had two sons, Adri (‘Ad’, 1912–1992) and Hendrik ('Henk', 1915–1916), and a daughter, Ellen (1917–1986).Nieuws van den Dag voor Nederlandsch-Indië (16 December 1912); Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad (20 August 1915); NRC Handelsblad (26 April 1986). Russer and Sitsen were active in the Fine Arts Society of the Dutch East Indies in Batavia (Nederlandsch-Indische Kunstkring Batavia), of which Sitsen was treasurer during 1912–1915 and a member of the committee that constructed the society’s building (now Galeri Seni Kunstkring) in 1914.Gedenkboek Nederlandsch-Indische Kunstkring Batava 1902–1927 [Commemorative volume of colonial Indonesia’s art circle in Batavia 1902–1927]. (Batavia: Kolff. 1927) 68–69. Russer performed at concerts in cities throughout Indonesia. As her accompanist, Sitsen sometimes sang with Russer at concerts.E.g. Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad (26 September 1911 and 25 November 1914). Together they performed with well-known Dutch singer and entertainer Jean-Louis Pisuisse during his tour of Indonesia in 1913.Hamel, Anke (1989) Mijn Liefste Lief: Brieven van Jean-Louis Pisuisse aan Fie Carelsen. (The Hague: SDU) 155 and 157. A newspaper review described the performance: ‘Sitsen has a good feeling for music, a lot of emotion and warmth, […] and not much of a voice’.‘Sitsen heeft veel muzikaal begrip, veel sentiment en warmte, […] en weinig stem’. Het Nieuws van den Dag voor Nederlandsch-Indië (4 December 1913).  1912–1935: Surveyor in Jakarta, building contractor in Yogyakarta  Having served out his KNIL contract, Sitsen left the army in 1912 and became a senior land surveyor (rooimeester) with the Jakarta city council.Verslag van den Toestand der Gemeente Batavia over 1912 [Report on the situation in Batavia city during 1912]. (Weltevreden: Albrecht, 1913) 20. He left the job in 1915Sumatra Post (3 November 1915). to take the position of Director of Public Works (Directeur van de Sultanaatswerken) in the Sultanate of Yogyakarta in Central Java. In 1919 Sitsen partnered with Emile George Baruh Louzada (1886–1935) to establish the construction company N.V. Bouwkundig Bureau Sitsen en Louzada in Yogyakarta in 1919,Het Nieuws van den Dag voor Nederlandsch-Indië (22 and 25 February 1919). and became a building contractor (bouwaannemer).Louzada originated from Surinam, had studied civil engineering in Delft, and had been an engineer with the railway company NISM (Nederlandsch-Indische Spoorweg Maatschappij) during 1913–1919. The Sitsen en Louzada company designed and constructed a wide range of private and public buildings and other structures in Central and East Java during the 1920s and early 1930s. For example, an electric power plant in Yogyakarta for the ANIEM (Algemeene Nederlandsch- Indische Electriciteits-Maatschappij) companyNieuws van den Dag voor Nederlandsch-Indië (8 November 1919). and the bazaar building of Cilacap, one of the first all-concrete structures in Indonesia.Haagsche Courant (12 October 1931). The company was relatively successful, listing on the Surabaya stock exchange and raising a social capital of f 250,000, later increased to f 1 million. It paid dividends to shareholders of 8% (1923), 7% (1924) and 12.5% (1928).Handboek voor Cultuur- en Handelsondernemingen in Nederlandsch-Indië (1925 and 1930).  Life in Yogyakarta  Sitsen was president, then honorary commissioner, and then the first governor of the Yogyakarta chapter of the Rotary Club.The Rotarian (October 1935) 45. Together with Sultan Hamengkubuwono VIII (1880–1939), Thomas Karsten (1884–1945) and Samuel Koperberg (1886–1957), Sitsen organised the Java Institute (Java Instituut) and its Sånå Boedåjåmuseum (now Museum Sonobudoyo) in Yogyakarta in 1931. The museum opened in 1935 and still houses many artefacts related to Central Java’s rich history. Sitsen and Russer were members of the local arts circle in Yogyakarta.De Indische Courant (9 October 1922). Together they hosted a visit of German composer and painter Walter Spies in 1923.Rhodius, Hans (1964) Schönheit und Reichtum des Lebens, Walter Spies (Maler und Musiker auf Bali 1895–1942).

Russer organised the local choir and its performances.De Indische Courant (8 November 1926). She directed a stage performance of Mozart’s opera the Marriage of Figaro. Het Nieuws van den Dag voor Nederlandsch-Indië (6 April 1927). The Sitsen en Louzada company experienced financial difficulties during the economic crisis of the early 1930s. It was liquidated in 1935, following the death of Louzada in January 1935.Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad (18 February 1935).  1935–1942: Architect of Indonesia’s industrialisation policy  In 1935, Sitsen accepted a position at the Industry Section (Afdeeling Nijverheid) of what during the 1930s became the Department of Economic Affairs in Jakarta. In 1937 Sitsen and Russer settled back in Jakarta, where they resumed their activities in the Batavia Kunstkring arts circle.Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad (23 June 1937 and 19 September 1938). Sitsen's work initially focused on designing a policy for the development of small-scale industries. Following its presentation and discussion at the 1937 annual meeting of the Department’s senior officials, Sitsen published the policy principles for small scale industries in 1937.Sitsen, P.H.W. (1937) ‘De kleine nijverheid in de inheemse sfeer en hare- expansiemogelijkheden op Java’, Djawa, 17: 137–200. The implementation of this policy saw the start of the industrial extension service, organised by his colleague Pandji Soerachman Tjokroadisoerjo (1884–1952). The principles that Sitsen developed underpinned Indonesia’s first industrial development plan in 1941. A key feature of the plan was the principle of a ‘balanced’ mutually supportive development of small-, medium- and large-scale industrial ventures, using protection, safeguards and encouragements for the development of small- scale industry.Van der Eng, Pierre (2013) ‘Government promotion of labour- intensive industrialization in Indonesia, 1930–1975’ in Austin, Gareth and Sugihara, Kaoru (eds.) Labour-Intensive Industrialization in Global History (London: Routledge) 184–186. The policy focused on several industries that were labour-intensive and labour-absorbing, import-competitive and import- replacing.  1942–1945: Preparing Indonesia’s post-war economic recovery  Just before the surrender of the Dutch colonial government to the Japanese in March 1942, the colonial government ordered Sitsen to travel to Australia. He was to take part in what became the Netherlands East Indies Commission for Australia and New Zealand, effectively the Netherlands Indies government in exile in 1943, located in Melbourne. Sitsen’s task was to prepare for the return of the colonial government to Indonesia after the Japanese occupation, and to prepare economic recovery of Indonesia. For that purpose he travelled across the Pacific to the USA. In New York, Sitsen was a member of the Dutch Commission for Economic and Financial Affairs for the Netherlands Indies, Surinam and Curaçao (Commissie voor Economische en Financiële Zaken van Nederlands-Indië, Suriname en Curaçao). He also was the leader of the Netherlands Indies delegation to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in the South-West Pacific (UNRRA). At the Netherlands and Netherlands Indies Council of the Institute of Pacific Relations in New York, Sitsen created a world-first post-war aid and recovery plan for Indonesia and sought funding to start stockpiling materials. This was a 5-year plan with a total price tag of US$ 2.4 billion. As far as funds were available to the colonial government in exile, Sitsen used them to purchase and stockpile supplies of food, medical supplies and medical assistance, clothing and dwellings, and to invest in equipment and machinery necessary for the recovery of transport infrastructure, manufacturing industry, plantation agriculture, mining ventures etc. Sitsen, P.H.W.

New York: Netherlands and Netherlands Indies Council, Institute of Pacific Relations; ‘Control plan for the Indies’, Knickerbocker Weekly (1 October 1945) 17.  Death and honours  After completing his work in New York in September 1944, Sitsen was appointed Director of the Department of Public Works (Verkeer en Waterstaat) in the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA), the Netherlands East Indies government in exile located in Brisbane. Sitsen returned to Australia in late-1944 to take up the appointment. During the journey across the Pacific he fell ill. He died in hospital soon after arrival in Sydney on 21 January 1945, at the age of 59. He was buried at Northern Suburbs Cemetery in Sydney.Sydney Morning Herald (23 and 24 January 1945). In recognition for his work in Yogyakarta's society and business, Sitsen was made an Officer in the Order of Orange-Nassau in 1934.Nederlandsche Staatscourant (31 December 1934). He was fondly remembered among Dutch exiles from colonial Indonesia in the USA.Balink, Albert (1945) ‘A man to remember’, Knickerbocker Weekly (29 January 1945) 3 and 26.  Sitsen’s legacy: Recovery and industrialisation after 1945  The Sitsen economic recovery plan was put into action in 1944 and 1945. The Netherlands Indies Civil Administration had ample supplies, ready to be sent for relief to different parts of the Indonesian archipelago as soon as the Japanese were defeated. The plan provided for a meticulously planned distribution by island and by district of aid supplies. It was first rolled out in Eastern Indonesia, where it helped to relieve shortages, contributed to quick economic recovery during 1945 and normalised living conditions by 1946.The West Australian (25 July 1946). By contrast, distribution of aid supplies in Java and Sumatra was confined to the Dutch- held urban footholds until July 1947 due to the war of independence. An additional part of the plan was establishment of NIGIEO (Nederlandsch-Indische Gouvernements Import- en Export Organisatie) in March 1946. It monopolised imports and exports to be able to prioritise relief imports and the distribution of imported goods.De Nieuwe Courant (13 April 1946). The organisation was liquidated at the end of 1947, when Indonesia’s exports increased and the need for foreign exchange rationing and relief imports decreased. Sitsen’s other legacy was the policy of support for small-scale industries in Indonesia. During 1946–1951 this policy morphed into a system of core enterprises that encouraged small-scale regionally diversified industrialisation, known in Indonesia since 1951 as the induk system.Van der Eng, Pierre (2013) ‘Government promotion of labour-intensive industrialization in Indonesia, 1930–1975’ in Austin, Gareth and Sugihara, Kaoru (eds.)

She is the first person of Lebanese descent, and the first Muslim, to play in the AFL Women's. Initially a rugby league player, Zreika switched to Australian rules football when she was 15 years old. Zreika played in the AFL Sydney competition before she was drafted by Greater Western Sydney in the 2017 rookie draft. She was delisted by the Giants at the end of the 2018 season, but was later re-selected in the 2018 draft after a strong season in the AFL Sydney. Zreika made her AFLW debut in the opening round of the 2019 season and was nominated for the 2019 AFL Women's Rising Star award in round 7.  Early life  Zreika grew up in western Sydney, the youngest of five siblings. She played rugby league with her two older brothers and supported the Canterbury Bulldogs. Her mother had migrated to Australia from Lebanon when she was 16. Zreika competed in a mixed-gender rugby competition from the age of six, but was forced to stop playing when she was 12 because there were no competitions for girls of her age. She first encountered Australian rules football when she was 15; her sports teacher at Strathfield South High School invited her to a clinic scouting multicultural players. Zreika was introduced to the Auburn- Penrith Giants and began playing for them a year later in the top women's division of the AFL Sydney. She competed in the 2016 AFL Youth Girls National Championships for a combined New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory side. In 2017, Zreika was named in the inaugural AFLW Academy, one of 33 prospective female players. As part of this squad she took part in various training camps and activities. She made a brief return to rugby league in the under-18 division of the Tarsha Gale Cup, playing as a hooker for Canterbury in the final. Zreika was named as a midfielder among 54 players in 2017 AFL Women's Under 18 Championships All-Australian squad after her performance at the competition, but did not make the final team. She tested at the AFLW draft combine in the lead-up to the 2017 draft, finishing third in the two-kilometre time trial and seventh in the yo-yo endurance test. Zreika was anticipated to be drafted by Greater Western Sydney as they were the only AFLW club in New South Wales.  AFLW career  The Giants overlooked Zreika in the national draft, but later selected her with the first pick in the rookie draft. She did not play a game in 2018 and was delisted at the end of the season. Zreika returned to the Auburn-Penrith Giants and won 17 votes in the 2018 Mostyn Medal (AFL Sydney's women's best and fairest). This equalled the tally of the overall winner Pippa Smythe; however, Zreika was ineligible because of an earlier suspension. Zreika was relisted by the Giants with pick 69 in the 2018 AFLW draft. She debuted in the opening round of the 2019 season against . In round 7, on the day of the Christchurch mosque shootings, Zreika kicked her first AFLW goal against . Players observed a minute of silence prior to the match and wore black armbands. Zreika received the final nomination for the 2019 AFL Women's Rising Star award after collecting 17 disposals – a personal best – seven tackles and four clearances.

She was married firstly to Henry FitzGerald, 12th Earl of Kildare (d.1597), and secondly in May 1601 to Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham. Around the same time Cobham's brother George Brooke married Elizabeth Burgh, daughter of Lord Burgh.Norman McClure, Letters of John Chamberlain, vol. 1 (Philadelphia, 1939), p. 64. After her second marriage she retained the name \\"Lady Kildare\\". She was a member of the household of Queen Elizabeth as a lady of the Privy Chamber. Rowland Whyte mentioned her several times in his newsletters to Robert Sidney. In November 1595 he described how Barbara Sidney was received at court and 'my Lord Admiral and all that tribe were glad to see her' and Lady Kildare was sent especially to keep her company and dine with her in Lady Hoby's chamber.Michael Brennan, Noel Kinnamon, Margaret Hannay, The Letters of Rowland Whyte to Sir Robert Sidney (Philadelphia, 2013), p. 94 (A. Collins, I, (1746), p. 366). Her husband the Earl of Kildare died, and in November 1598 Elizabeth gave her £700 to compensate the loss of her marriage jointure in Ireland.Norman McClure, Letters of John Chamberlain, vol. 1 (Philadelphia, 1939), p. 52. In August 1599 Whyte heard that Margaret Radcliffe, a maid of honour, had stayed in her chamber for four days after Lady Kildare had been unkind to her because they were rivals for the affection of Lord Cobham. Radcliffe died in November 1599, after refusing to eat, and Ben Jonson as an epitaph wrote an acrostic epigram.Michael Brennan, Noel Kinnamon, Margaret Hannay,The Letters of Rowland Whyte to Sir Robert Sidney (Philadelphia, 2013), p. 319, 375 610 (Collins, II, (1746), pp. 117, 140-1).

On 16 December 1602 Elizabeth gave Lady Kildare a black velvet gown embroidered with scallop shells and ragged pearls which had originally been a gift to her from the Earl of Warwick in 1578. It was altered for Lady Kildare by the queen's tailor William Jones and the embroiderer John Parr.Janet Arnold, Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe Unlock'd (Leeds, 1988), pp. 272.

Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton tried to break her Scottish connections, and wrote to Edward Bruce, 1st Lord Kinloss, asking if he could find out about three letters she had written to James before the fall of the Earl of Essex in February 1601. One asked if she could have a private cipher to write secret letters to the king, and Northampton heard she had a cipher to write to Sir Thomas Erskine. In the second she had offered to engineer the disgrace of Cecil and Walter Raleigh with Queen Elizabeth. In the third she warned James VI against Raleigh and the Master of Grey.[David Dalrymple], Secret Correspondence with James VI (Edinburgh, 1766), pp.209-10. Northampton was keen to thwart Lady Kildare's involvement in international politics, and on 22 November 1601 wrote to the Earl of Mar about his difficulties with 'her entermeddelinge'. Northampton questioned her access to useful information, claiming 'hir owne sexe dare not speake before hir', incidentally giving insight into the political roles of ladies in waiting at Elizabeth's court.[David Dalrymple], Secret Correspondence with James VI (Edinburgh, 1766), pp. 19-23: HMC Mar & Kellie, I (1904), pp. 53-6 (misdated to 1610): George Lillie Craik, The Romance of the Peerage vol. 3 (London, 1849), pp. 181-6.

Frances also came to Berwick with other courtiers in an official party to welcome Anne of Denmark. These were chosen by the Privy Council, following the king's order of 15 April 1603. The group consisted of two countesses, Kildare, and Elizabeth, Countess of Worcester; two baronesses Philadelphia, Lady Scrope and Penelope, Lady Rich; and two ladies Anne Herbert, a daughter of Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, and Audrey Walsingham.J. Leeds Barroll, Anna of Denmark, Queen of England (Philadelphia, 2001), pp. 41-3.

Leeds Barroll, Anna of Denmark, Queen of England (Philadelphia, 2001), pp. 43-5. Kildare was made the governess of Princess Elizabeth on 5 June 1603 despite Northampton's efforts to discredit her, and sworn a Lady of the Queen's Privy Chamber two weeks later. A later memoir, which has a very favourable view of Kildare, states she had a letter from the king to the queen recommending her.[Lady Frances Erskine] Memoirs Relating to the Queen of Bohemia by One of Her Ladies (c. 1770), pp. 42-3. Her father, the Earl of Nottingham, visited her and Prince Henry and Princess Elizabeth at Oatlands in September 1603.

Disgrace In September 1603 she lost this position four months after her husband was named in the 'Bye Plot' and 'Main Plot'. It was said she urged her husband to testify against Raleigh to save himself.John Leeds Barroll, Anna of Denmark, Queen of England (Pennsylvania, 2001), pp. 41-2, 45-6. Howard wrote to Cecil blaming and implicating her brother-in-law Sir George Brooke.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 15 (London, 1930), p. 380.

A later memoir states that although Cobham had been unkind to Howard, she became sick with worry at his arrest, leading to her replacement as governess, and a letter of Thomas Edmondes explained 'her spyrittes have been of late much troubled with her husbande's disaster'.[Lady Frances Erskine] Memoirs Relating to the Queen of Bohemia by One of Her Ladies (c. 1770), pp. 89; John Nichols, The Progresses, Processions, and Magnificent Festivities of King James, vol. 1 (London, 1828), p. 271. Lord Cobham was not executed but remained in Tower for years, dying in 1618. Kildare was a 'countess assistant' at the funeral of Anne of Denmark in 1619. Her daughter Bridget married Rory O'Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, and secondly Nicholas Barnewall, 1st Viscount Barnewall. Her daughter Elizabeth Fitzgerald married Luke Plunket, 1st Earl of Fingall. Lady Kildare lived at Cobham Hall and Deptford.

Background  In early 1241, while the Latin Empire was besieging the Nicaean fortress of Tzouroulos in eastern Thrace, the Nicaean emperor John III Vatatzes campaigned against Latin fortresses north of Nicomedia. With his fleet accompanying the army, he captured Dakibyza and Niketiatou. At the same time, however, the Nicaean fleet encountered a Venetian fleet that had sailed from Constantinople, and suffered a heavy defeat in a battle off the city's sea walls.  Battle  According to George Akropolites, the Nicaean fleet had 30 galleys and the Venetian fleet 13. However, the Nicaeans lost 13 of their own vessels, which were captured by the Venetians, so that \\"each one of the enemy ships gained one trireme as spoil, with its men and weapons\\". The contemporary Venetian chronicler Martin da Canal, on the other hand, claims that the Nicaean fleet numbered no less than 160 ships, \\"including galleys and other large and small vessels, all of which were well equipped\\", while the Venetian fleet numbered only ten galleys. Under the command of Podestà of Constantinople Giovanni Quirino, the Venetian fleet defeated the Nicaean fleet under Iophre the Armenian in the battle, taking ten Nicaean galleys captive. The date of the battle is fixed at May–June 1241 through the testimony of Andrea Dandolo.  Historical assessment  Akropolites and a 14th-century hagiography of Emperor John III attribute this defeat to the inexperience of the crews, claiming that for many of them this was their first sea voyage. According to Akropolites, the fleet commander, Manuel Kontophre, had warned the Emperor that the Nicaeans would lose in any naval combat with the Latins due to their inexperience, only to be dismissed and replaced by Iophre (Geoffrey) the Armenian, an otherwise unknown personage whom Akropolites describes as \\"rather hesitant in matters of war\\". After the defeat vindicated him, Kontophre was reinstated as commander of the fleet. According to the contemporary chronicle of Alberic of Trois-Fontaines, these hostilities were followed in June by a two-year truce between Vatatzes, the Latins, and the Bulgarian ruler Kaliman I.

Women had been involved informally in the Rotary Club's work but discrimination prevented then from becoming members in their own right. Margarette Golding persuaded 26 other wives to meet her at a room she had reserved at Herriott's Turkish Baths in Deansgate in Manchester. They met on 15 November 1923 where it was agreed to create a partner organisation to the Rotary Club which would assist the club in their role and provide a social benefit to its members. The first official meeting was on 10 January 1924 at their regular meeting place of the Social Club in Lower Mosley Street, Manchester. Golding founded and named the Inner Wheel organisation for the wives of members of the Rotary Club. There were other similar groups in Britain, but it was Golding who organised them into a national organisation under the name of the Inner Wheel. Legacy Golding has a plaque in Hay on Wye where she grew up. It was thought at one time that she had been born there.

It is a satellite of the main National Botanic Gardens located in Glasnevin, County Dublin. The 52 acre gardens are situated 5 km from exit 18 on the M11 motorway. The gardens were founded in 1712 as part of the Acton family estate who owned the land until 1940. Today, the gardens are in State ownership through the Office of Public Works. They were acquired in 1976 by the Land commissioner and day-to-day management transferred to National Botanic Gardens in 1996.  History  The story of Kilmacurragh stretches back beyond the establishment of the gardens to early Christian times. A lake, part of which remains as a small pond, once existed as a fishing pond for a monastery that stood where the remains of the Acton family home stand today. This monastery was dissolved by Henry VII. Thomas Acton and his sister Jane Acton were behind establishment of the gardens, subscribing to plant hunting expeditions and utilising contacts in botanical gardens and nurseries around the globe to acquire exotic seeds for the gardens. The gardens were the showpiece of the rare Irish Queen Anne style house, the home of the Acton family. The Rhododendron walks were developed through a friendship with David Moore the curator of the National Botanic Garden's at Glasnevin. This led to Kilmacurragh becoming the home to the national rhododendron collection. Further Kilmacurragh, whose acidic brown soil, low rainfall and mild winters, become the home of many specimens that were struggling or failing at Glasnevin. Many of the species grown in the gardens are so rare that they may be the only one or two of their kind in Europe or even the Northern Hemisphere. The remains of the Acton family home in National Botanic Gardens Kilmacurragh These rare species include *Monkey puzzles (conservation status endangered) *Chilean Laurel *Tiger-tailed spruce *Wellingtonia tree *Campbell's magnolia *Mexican cypress Mature monkey puzzle tree in the gardens. The house was abandoned in the 1920s but was later run as Kilmacurragh Park Hotel by Charles Budina. An ownership dispute led to the abandonment of the gardens until it was acquired by the Irish state in 1976.  Facilities  Map of Kilmacurragh National Botanic Gardens A café, Actons, opened in 2015 in one of the restored courtyard buildings on site. During the summer months there are free guided tours by the team working to restore and replant the gardens.

Ball (February 21, 1804 – September 20, 1861) was an early convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and a black man who held the priesthood prior to the priesthood ban instituted in 1849. He was also the first black branch president in the church.  Early life  Joseph T. Ball was born on February 21, 1804, to Mary Montgomery Drew and Joseph T. Ball, Sr., in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His father was an immigrant from Jamaica, and his mother was a white woman native to Massachusetts. They had 6 children together, Mary, Joseph, Lucy, Martha, Hannah, and Thomas. His family was said to have been very dedicated to social activism, his father founding a local society to help black widows, and his siblings becoming abolitionists and suffragists. All of his sisters were members of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society.  Membership  Ball was baptized into the church in 1832, possibly by Brigham or Joseph Young. The following year, he moved to Kirtland, Ohio, where he was ordained to be an Elder. In 1837, he was called to serve missions in New England and New Jersey with Wilford Woodruff and James Townsend, where they were able to convert around 40 people, including noted overland pioneer William Willard Hutchings. In 1841, he moved to Nauvoo, Illinois with many other members, and three years later, was ordained to the title of a High Priest by his friend William Smith, the brother of Joseph Smith. He was then given the office of Branch President or Presiding Elder over the Boston stake of the church, the largest congregation of saints outside of Nauvoo, on October 7, 1844.\\"Religious Notices,\\" Prophet (New York City), 12 Oct. 1844, 2. Retrieved 21 April 2019 The following year, in spring 1845, after being released from his calling, he was asked to work on the construction of the Nauvoo Temple by Parley P. Pratt. While in Illinois, Ball completed several proxy baptisms for his ancestors, and received a patriarchal blessing from William Smith. Sometime in the 1840s, Ball began practicing polygamy without official authorization from Joseph Smith, apparently under instruction from William. In 1845, this came to light and resulted in the end of Ball's relationship with the church.  Later life  After Ball left the church, he and William both became involved in the Strangite sect, appearing in their records in 1848. He migrated back to Massachusetts near the end of his life, where he died of tuberculosis on September 20, 1861. He is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery near Boston.

It is named after the Eight of Leaves, the Dog (der Hund), which used to depict a dog in old card packs.Gööck (1967), p.30  Rules  The following rules are based on Müller and Reichelt.Reichelt (1987), p. 106.Müller (1994), p. 40. A 32-card French or German pack may be used. If French cards are used, the Eight of Spades is the Dog. The aim is to avoid being the last player with any cards in one's hand. All the cards are dealt; it makes no difference if one or two players have an extra card. The player with the Dog plays it, face up, to the table and follows it with any card of his choice, such as a King. The player to the left must play another King (in this example) onto the pile, before laying a card of his choice on top. This continues unless a player is unable to match the last played card, in which case they must pick up the entire wastepile, except for the Dog, and add it to his hand. The last player with cards in his hand has lost.  Variation  In Gööck, the first player leads with only one card: the Dog. The next player must therefore play an Eight, before playing a second card of any denomination on it. Play continues as before.  Hund  In what appears to be a variant, Hund, the player who leads with the Dog places a second card of his choice on it before turn passes to the next player who must then match the second card played in suit, not rank, with their first card. Subsequent players must also match the suit and not the rank of the last card played. If a player cannot do this, he merely picks up the last card of the pile and adds it to his hand. The first player out, wins (as opposed to last player out, loses).Dietze (1990), p. 101.  References   Literature  * Dietze, Rudolf (1990). Das neue Spielbuch. 3rd edn.

As a juvenile in 2013 he showed very promising form as he won three of his four races including the Icho Stakes and the Tokyo Sports Hai Nisai Stakes. In the following year he took the JRA Award for Best Three-Year-Old Colt after winning the Tokino Minoru Kinen, Satsuki Sho and St Lite Kinen as well as finishing second in the Tokyo Yushun and third in the autumn edition of the Tenno Sho. He failed to win in the net two years but ran well in several major races, being placed in the Tenno Sho and two runnings of the Mile Championship. In his final season he returned to winning form, taking the Yomiuri Milers Cup and the Hanshin Cup. Background Isla Bonita is a dark bay or brown horse standing 1.61 metres high, with a broad white blaze and three white socks bred and owned by the Shadai Racing Corporation. During his racing career he was trained by Hironori Kurita. He was sired by the undefeated champion Fuji Kiseki whose four wins included the Grade 1 Asahi Hai Sansai Stakes in 1994. As a breeding stallion he sired several other major winners including Straight Girl, Kane Hekili, Danon Chantilly (NHK Mile Cup), Sadamu Patek (Mile Championship), Fine Grain (Takamatsunomiya Kinen) and Kinshasa No Kiseki (Takamatsunomiya Kinen). Isla Bonita's dam Isla Cozzene was an American mare whose wins included the Listed Hawthorne Oaks in 2005. Racing career =2013: two-year-old season= On 2 June at Tokyo Racecourse Isla Bonita made a successful racecourse debut when he won an event for previously unraced juveniles over 1600 metres. In August at Niigata Racecourse he was stepped up in class for the Grade 3 Niigata Nisai Stakes and was beaten three lengths into second place by the filly Harp Star. At Tokyo in October the colt was dropped back to Listed class for the Icho Stakes over 1800 metres and won from Win Phoenix and ten others. For his final run of the year Isla Bonita started the 4.3/1 second favourite behind Satono Aladdin in the Grade 3 Tokyo Sports Hai Nisai Stakes over 1800 metres at Tokyo. Ridden by Masayoshi Ebina he won in a race record time of 1:45.9 by a neck from Pray And Real with Clarity City a length and a quarter back in third place. =2014: three-year-old season= Isla Bonita wins the Satsuki Sho On 24 February Isla Bonita began his second campaign in the Kyodo News Service Hai (a trial race for the Satsuki Sho) over 1800 metres at Tokyo. He headed the betting at odds of 6/5 and won by one and a quarter lengths from Bell Canyon, with two lengths back to Satono Aladdin in third. On his next appearance Isla Bonita, with Ebina in the saddle, was made the 4.1/1 second choice in the betting for the 74th running of the Satsuki Sho over 2000 metres at Nakayama Racecourse. The Yayoi Sho winner To The World started favourite, with the other sixteen runners including Asia Express, Rosa Gigantea (Spring Stakes), Tosen Stardom (Kisaragi Sho), One And Only (Radio Nikkei Hai Nisai Stakes), Clarity City and Bell Canyon. After racing in mid-division Isla Bonita moved up on the outside on the final turn and moved up to dispute the lead with Win Full Bloom, To The World, and Asia Express 200 metres from the finish. He drew ahead in the closing stages to win by one and a quarter lengths and half a length from To The World and Win Full Bloom in a time of 1:59.6. After the race Ebina said \\"I tried to race him with his own pace until the first corner and took him to the outside to avoid the crowd. He was responding well, and as I was able to race him towards the front, I urged him to go earlier. Although he seemed a bit distracted, he was able rally strongly with the other horses. He is able to run a smooth race and I think the Tokyo racecourse, where the Japanese Derby is held, will suit him well\\". On 1 June Isla Bonita was stepped up in distance and was made the 1.7/1 favourite for the Japanese Derby over 2400 metres at Tokyo. After tracking the front-runners in third he moved up to dispute the lead in the straight but was outrun in the closing stages and beaten three quarters of a length into second place by One And Only. After a three and a half months Isla Bonita returned in autumn for the St Lite Kinen (usually a trial race for the Kikuka Sho) over 2200 metres at Niigata on 21 September. He started the 2/5 favourite in an eighteen-runner field and won by one and a quarter lengths from To The World. Isla Bonita bypassed the Kikuka Sho and was matched against older horses for the first time in the autumn edition of the Tenno Sho over 2000 metres at Tokyo on 2 November. Ridden by Christophe Lemaire he started favourite and finished a close third behind the five-year- olds Spielberg and Gentildonna. On his final run of the season four weeks later he came home ninth of the seventeen finishers behind Epiphaneia in the Japan Cup. In the 2014 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Isla Bonita was given a rating of 117, making the 105th best horse in the world. In January 2015 Isla Bonita was named Best Three-Year-Old Colt at the JRA Awards for 2014 taking 170 of the 285 votes. =2015 & 2016: four and five-year-old seasons= Isla Bonita's trainer Hironori Kurita Isla Bonita began his 2015 season by coming home fifth behind the filly Nuovo Record when favourite for the Nakayama Kinen on 1 March. He was then off the track for over seven months before running third to A Shin Hikari in the Mainichi Okan at Tokyo on 11 October. On 1 November he ran for the second time in the autumn Tenno Sho and finished third of the eighteen runners beaten half a length and three quarters of a length by Lovely Day and Staphanos. For his final run of 2015 the colt was dropped back in distance for the Mile Championship over 1600 metres at Kyoto Racecoure three weeks later and started favourite. He recovered from a poor start to produce a strong late run but was unable to catch the leaders and came home third behind Maurice and Fiero. Despite failing to win a race, Isla Bonita's earnings for the year came to ¥86,216,000, equivalent to approximately $770,000. His rating of 116 placed him 139th in the 2015 World's Best Racehorse Rankings. Isla Bonita did not produce his best form in the spring of 2016, finishing ninth to Duramente in the Nakayama Kinen, fifth to Ambitious in the Osaka Hai and fifth to Logotype in the Yasuda Kinen. The last named race was the last in which the horse was partnered by Ebina: Lemaire rode Isla Bonita in all of his subsequent races. The horse returned from a four and a half month summer break to finish second to Young Man Power in the Grade 3 Fuji Stakes over 1600 metres at Tokyo in October. In the following month he ran for the second time in the Mile Championship for which he started the 3.8/1 second favourite. After racing in sixth place he produced an \\"impressive late charge\\" on the outside but failed by a head to overhaul Mikki Isle. On 24 December he was dropped back to 1400 metres for the Grade 2 Hanshin Cup and finished second, beaten a head by the three-year-old Shuji. His earnings for the season totaled ¥102,518,000 (about $916,000) and his end- of-year rating of 117 placed him 110th in the 2016 World's Best Racehorse Rankings. =2017: six-year-old season= On his first run of 2017 Isla Bonita started second favourite behind Air Spinel in the Yomiuri Milers Cup over 1600 metres at Kyoto on 23 April in an eleven-runner field which also included Young Man Power and Fiero. He recorded his first victory in more than two and a half years as he won by half a length from Air Spinel. On 4 June he started favourite for the Yasuda Kinen but was repeatedly denied a clear run in the straight and came home eighth of the eighteen runners behind Satono Aladdin. After the summer break Isla Bonita began his autumn campaign in the Fuji Stakes on 21 October and finished second, two lengths behind the winner Air Spinel. In November he started favourite in his third attempt to win the Mile Championship. He again encountered trouble in running before staying on strongly in the closing stages to finish fifth, one and a half lengths behind the three-year-old winner Persian Knight. On his final racecourse appearance Isla Bonita started the 3.1/1 second choice in the betting behind Mozu Ascot in an eighteen-runner field for the Hanshin Cup on 24 December.

They argued that the total yearly sum of 1.37 billion francs should be spent by consumers and that the SRG SSR would become more politically independent if it did not depend on the mandatory fee. Opponents of the initiative said that removing the mandatory fee would threaten national cohesion and that the country would become a \\"media desert\\" which would be dangerous to Switzerland's system of direct democracy.

The target of the test was a satellite present in a low Earth orbit, which was hit with a kinetic kill vehicle. The ASAT test utilized a modified anti-ballistic missile interceptor code-named Prithvi Defence Vehicle Mark-II which was developed under Project XSV-1. The test made India the fourth country after the US, Russia and China to have tested an ASAT weapon. The test sparked concerns regarding the creation of space debris. The Indian government tried to address these concerns by saying that the debris generated from the test would not last for a long duration. India's successful demonstration of the ASAT capability is said to signify its ability to intercept an intercontinental ballistic missile. The ASAT weapon is meant to act as a deterrent.  Background  The Indian anti-satellite (ASAT) program utilized spin off technologies from Indian ABM systems. India is developing a multi-layered and multi-phased missile defence system to defend against hostile ballistic and cruise missiles. The exo-atmospheric interceptors meant to be used against ICBMs, which have lofted trajectories and fly at high altitudes, can also be used to intercept satellites. In response to threats posed by missile systems from China and Pakistan, India began to work on its BMD program in 1999.Interview: Vijay Kumar Saraswat In 2006 and 2007, India tested its first exo atmospheric interceptor Prithvi Air Defence (PAD) and endo atmospheric interceptor Ashwin/Advanced Air Defence respectively. In 2009, India began to work a new exo atmospheric interceptor called Prithvi Defense Vehicle (PDV) similar to THAAD. India had begun work on an ASAT soon after the 2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test. In a televised press briefing during the 97th Indian Science Congress in Thiruvananthapuram, the Defence Research and Development Organisation Director General Rupesh announced that India was developing the necessary technology that could be combined to produce a weapon to destroy enemy satellites in orbit. On 18 March 2008, DRDO Director-General and Scientific Advisor to the Defence Minister V. K. Saraswat hinted that India possessed technology required for an ASAT missile. On 10 February 2010, Saraswat stated that India had \\"all the building blocks necessary\\" to integrate an anti-satellite weapon to neutralize hostile satellites in low earth and polar orbits. India is known to have been developing an exo- atmospheric kill vehicle that can be integrated with the missile to engage satellites. In April 2012, DRDO's chairman V. K. Saraswat said that India possessed the critical technologies for an ASAT weapon from radars and interceptors developed for Indian Ballistic Missile Defence Programme. In July 2012, Ajay Lele, an Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses fellow, wrote that an ASAT test would bolster India's position if an international regime to control the proliferation of ASATs similar to NPT were to be established. He suggested that a low-orbit test against a purpose-launched satellite would not be seen as irresponsible. In 2014, India carried out the maiden test of PDV. First real time interception test was carried out against a maneuvering target in 2017, followed by another test in 2019. In 2017, India had lost contact to one of its key imaging satellites, RISAT-1. In 2016, the Indian Government approved a program codenamed Project XSV-1 for an ASAT test. A modified version of the PDV similar to the midcourse ground-based interceptor, officially named PDV MkII was tested against a satellite on 27 March 2019. DRDO has also been working on directed energy weapons, electromagnetic pulse and co-orbital weapons for ASAT roles.  Specifications  The ASAT missile, designated Prithvi Defence Vehicle Mark-II, lifting off to intercept the satellite. It is a part of the Indian Ballistic Missile Defence Programme. The interceptor struck a test satellite at a altitude in low earth orbit (LEO), thus making Mission Shakti a successful ASAT missile test. The interceptor was launched at around 05:40 UTC at the Integrated Test Range (ITR) in Abdul Kalam Island and hit its target after 168 seconds. Microsat-R was the suspected target of the test. The missile system was developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)—a research wing of the Indian defence services. Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation on television, announcing the test. With this test, India became the fourth nation after United States, Russia and China with proven anti-satellite (ASAT) capabilities. =Interceptor= India officially confirmed that the ASAT missile used in the test is a Ballistic Missile Defence interceptor and is part of the Indian Ballistic Missile Defence Programme. The interceptor has the designation of Prithvi Defence Vehicle (PDV) Mark-II. The interceptor missile involved in the test had a hit-to-kill capable Kinetic kill vehicle. Thus the missile, by nature, was a direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon. It had a length of 13 m and a diameter of 1.4 m. Being a three-stage missile, it was fitted with two solid-propellant rocket motor stages and the Kill vehicle. The combined weight of the first and the second stages is 17.2 tons, with the third stage weighing 1.8 tons. The first two stages can carry 16.7 tons of fuel. DRDO Chief G. Satheesh Reddy said that although some previously developed sub-technologies were used as a basis, the interceptor was a completely new missile. As per DRDO, the missile was capable of shooting down targets moving at a speed of 10 km per second at an altitude as high as 1200 km. However, in order to minimize the threat of debris, the interception was performed against an object moving at 7.4 km per second at an altitude below 300 km. DRDO Chief G. Satheesh Reddy said that the propulsive power of the interceptor missile can be increased to make it capable of targeting satellites at medium altitudes. The missile reportedly hit the satellite with an accuracy of less than 10 cm, which is comparable with the best reported performance of ASAT missiles. Some reports stated that the achieved accuracy was of a few centimetres. According to DRDO Chief G. Satheesh Reddy, the interceptor missile is capable of shooting down all the satellites present in Low Earth orbit.  Kill Vehicle  The Kill Vehicle constituted the third stage of the interceptor missile. It had an advanced terminal guidance system on board, including a non-gimballed imaging infrared seeker and an inertial navigation system that used ring-laser gyroscopes, which detected and tracked the Microsat-R satellite in Low Earth orbit. Course corrections to the Kill Vehicle's trajectory were made using a thrust-vector system. Large thrusters present at the top of the Kill Vehicle's rear cylindrical body at approximately its centre of gravity and smaller thrusters present near the back of the Kill Vehicle were used.  Solid rocket motor  Solid- propellant rocket motors formed the first two stages of the interceptor missile. These rocket motor stages took the ASAT missile to the required height and velocity. After that, the nose tip heat shield was ejected and the IIR seeker of the Kill Vehicle locked onto the satellite. = Target Satellite = The target of the test was widely reported to have been Microsat-R, a satellite which was launched by ISRO on 24 January 2019. This satellite was reportedly built to serve the purpose of the test. However, India maintains that it shot down a \\"live\\" Indian satellite; India has not specified the satellite. The relative velocity between the missile and Microsat-R was around 10 km per second. Shooting down a satellite approximately present in a 300-km LEO is more challenging than shooting down a satellite present in a higher orbit. The transverse orbital speed of a satellite is inversely proportional to its distance from the centre of Earth, which is a direct consequence of the law of conservation of angular momentum, or equivalently, Kepler's second law.  Aftermath  = Space Debris = In a statement released after the test, Indian Ministry of External Affairs said that the test was conducted at low altitude to ensure that the resulting debris would \\"decay and fall back onto the Earth within weeks\\". According to Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, some debris might persist for a year, but most should burn up in the atmosphere within several weeks. Brian Weeden of Secure World Foundation agreed, but warned about the possibility of some fragments getting boosted to higher orbits. US Air Force Space Command said that it was tracking 270 pieces of debris from the test, although as of 26 September only 125 objects have been catalogued. A Dutch Space Situational Awareness consultant Marco Langbroek disputed DRDO's claim that the test was responsible. He said that the intercept was not \\"head on\\", which would have minimized debris ejection to higher altitudes, but was instead conducted at an upwards angle. He added that most of the debris would be cleared within days, but some might last a year or two. According to NASA, 49 tracked pieces of debris remained in orbit as of 15 July 2019. Indian missile experts criticised this claim by mentioning that debris was generated in similar tests by the US, adding that the debris doesn't pose a threat to any spacecraft because it is in a very low orbit. As of 26 September 2019, there were 50 tracked pieces of debris in orbit but 9 of them were lost (no updates for more than 30 days) according to astrodynamicist T.S. Kelso. = Defence Space Agency = India has created the Defence Space Agency to develop capabilities required to protect its interests in outer space and to deal with the threat of space wars. India conducted its first simulated space warfare exercise on 25th and 26 July 2019, called IndSpaceEx. The exercise was conducted by the Integrated Defence Staff. The exercise is expected to lead to an assessment of threats and the creation of a joint space warfare doctrine. =Further ASAT Development= India is reportedly working on directed energy ASAT weapons, co-orbital ASAT weapons, lasers and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) based ASAT weapons. The ability to protect space assets from hostile electronic and physical attacks is also being developed. = Spying Incident = Aircraft Spots, which monitors military-related aircraft movements, said that a United States Air Force reconnaissance aircraft from the Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia flew on “a mission in the Bay of Bengal to monitor India’s anti- satellite missile test”. This was denied by the United States Department of Defense.  Reactions  = Neighbourhood of India = People's Republic of China China reacted cautiously to the test. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said that it has noticed reports about the test and was hopeful that all countries will uphold peace and tranquility in outerspace. However, state- run media of China decried the 'double standards' of the Western world. It said that the West did not criticize India as much as it criticized China for its ASAT test because it viewed the test from a 'China-India competition perspective'. Pakistan Pakistan asserted that space is a common heritage of mankind, saying that every nation has the duty to refrain from actions that lead to the militarization of space. Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that boasting of such capabilities is useless, invoking the English idiom Tilting at Windmills. Pakistan also hoped that countries which have condemned such tests by other countries before \\"will be prepared to work towards developing international instruments to prevent military threats relating to outer space\\". = Other countries = Russia Russia acknowledged India's statement on the test not being targeted against any nation and invited India to join the Russian–Chinese proposal for a treaty against weaponisation of space. United States of America Following the test, acting United States Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan warned about the risks of space debris caused by ASAT tests, but later added that he did not expect debris from the Indian test to last. The United States Department of State acknowledged Ministry of External Affairs' statement on space debris and reiterated its intention to pursue shared interests in space including on space security with India. Jim Bridenstine, the head of NASA, called the Indian ASAT test a \\"terrible thing\\", pointing out that debris from the explosion endangers other satellites and the International Space Station. Acting US Strategic Command commander General John E Hyten told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee that Indians conducted the ASAT test because they were \\"concerned about threats to their nation from space\\" while responding to a question from Senators on the need for India to do test. Significance The test is considered to hold significance due to the following reasons— * It gives India the capability to degrade and destroy the communication, reconnaissance and intelligence gathering capabilities of countries by taking out their space-based assets. It is a deterrent in effect, deterring similar actions by hostile nations. * It shows that India has the capability to intercept Intercontinental ballistic missiles outside the atmosphere. *The test potentially enables India to claim the right to be involved in the formation of future international norms and guidelines with regards to militarisation of outer space.

The novel was dedicated to Dombrovsky's \\"New World\\" editor Anna Samoilovna Berser and published in the West (IMCA-Press, Paris); according to the popular version, this publication was the cause of Dombrovsky's death (possibly murderУбит за роман // Новая газета. 22 мая 2008). In the USSR, the first publication took place in 1988 in the \\"Novy Mir\\" (separate editions in Moscow, Almaty, Khabarovsk in 1989-1990).  Contents  The novel takes place in the summer of 1937 in the city of Almaty. The protagonist of the novel. Georgy Nikolaevich Zybin, is a thirty-year-old historian and an employee of the ethnographic museum. For a long time Zybin tried to live besides his epoch, not penetrating into an essence of occurring around: arrests, public judicial processes and propagandistic hysteria. An authentic European humanist, Zybin cannot accept the fact of social obscurity and total feralization of people. Zybin feels himself an irreplaceable fragment of the outgoing culture, on whom its fate depends, and he cannot reconcile himself with its demise and with the fact that the culture becomes a \\"faculty of unnecessary things\\". Being in a state of delirium at night, Zybin talks to Stalin: \\"What if you are right and the world will survive and prosper. Then the mind, conscience, goodness, humanity and everything that has been forged for thousands of years and was considered the goal of the existence of mankind, is worth nothing. To save the world, you need iron and flamethrowers, stone cellars and people with guns ... And I, and people like me, will have to fall to your boots like to an icon. Zybin persuades himself to live \\"in a right way\\" which means: \\"quietly, imperceptibly, not touching and not hurting anyone. \\" I am the keeper of antiquities, that's it!\\" - he says to himself. His life is externally safe. Beautiful Clara. an employee of the museum, is secretly in love with him. The director of the museum, a former red commander, treats him with caring respect. The director warns Zybin: \\"Don't be partisan,- be polite. An old man who works as a museum carpenter, is his faithful drinking companion. One day, Kornilov, a young scientist who was expelled from Moscow, appears in the museum. For Zybin, he is a man of his own breed, - by fate and education. But events are beginning to unfold with catastrophic acceleration. The old man Rodionov, an amateur archaeologist and a former partisan, confident in his services to the authorities, comes with his \\"discovery\\" - he demands to start excavations of the ancient capital in a place he will point out. Zybin knows that resisting the power of aggressive ignorance is pointless and dangerous, but still he resists. In the museum, he bickers in vain with the illiterate but ideologically savvy Zoya Mikhailovna. Zybin writes to a local newspaper quite neutral ( as he thinks) notes about culture, but even for them he is reprimanded by Dyupova, the academic secretary of the local library. Dyupova says that the author did not reflect the work of librarians to serve the masses of workers and students. Zybin is restless. He gets involved a anecdotal story. The bloated newspaper hype about the giant boa allegedly living in the collective farm \\"Mountain Giant\\" threatens to break the life of brigadier Potapov. \\"Lawyers on vacation\\" are going to the collective farm. Accidentally, they meet a car on a night road that takes Zybin to the \\"lawyers\\", where he is explained that Potapov is an agent of German intelligence, and the story with the snake is a \\"cleverly conceived diversion\\". That same night, having met with Potapov, who is hiding, Zybin tries to help him. The foreman was able to find and kill the \\"boa\\", which turned out to be a very big runner. Together, they take a bag of the killed snake to the museum, which gives the brigadier's last hope for salvation. At the same time, some workers bring to the museum a new discovery - a handful of gold plaques, part of the treasure they found. Upon learning that this is really archaeological gold, the workers quickly disappear. The treasure for the museum is lost, and the NKVD(KGB predecessor) signals about what happened. Zybin, meanwhile, goes to the steppe in search of the treasure. And here happens the arrest, the one he has been expecting for a long time. He is accused of anti-Soviet propaganda, theft of values and attempt to flee abroad. The case is conducted by the head of the department Neumann, an experienced investigator and a clever but rude man, as well as by Kriputin, a specialist in knocking out the testimony. There is no proof of Zybin's guilt, their security officers expect to receive confession from Zybin himself. He is taught by his cell mate, an old Buddhist that it is still impossible to get out of here, it is more reasonable to confess to everything that is required - then the investigation will be easier, and the camp term will not be so long. But Zybin is a tough guy. For him, a confession to an imperfect crime is tantamount to agreeing with the general lawlessness and falsity of the universe. When Kriputin, poured with professional anger, starts shouting at Zybin, hoping to break him, Zybin finds in himself the necessary rush of rage and strength he needs. He loses his fear. Zybin's arrest is part of Neumann's grand plan. He decided to prepare a large Moscow style show trial with an accusation of mass sabotage in the field of culture. The method of \\"conveyor\\" is applied to Zybin; he is interrogated day and night by continuously changing investigators. But the detainee holds firm. Kornilov is also invited to the NKVD. He is asked to help the authorities close the case against another museum employee, former priest Kutorgu. The investigator tells Kornilov that the NKVD has written denunciation on Kutorgu but they still think that the old man is harmless. \\"If you are ready to vouch for him, do it. Just do it evidently and officially, in written form. Kornilov succumbs. The conversations that he has with the Kutorgu are devoted mainly to the trial and execution of Christ and betrayal of his Teacher by his disciples. Here arises the most important themes of the novel: Christ and the world, the fate of Christianity in the modern world. Kornilov sincerely tries to convince himself of innocent conversations with Kutorgu and he writes reports on their meetings in which he characterizes the interlocutor as loyal citizen. The reports are accepted with gratitude, but on the last visit to the NKVD Kornilov is taken to Colonel Gulyaev and the tone of the conversation changes dramatically. Gulyaev incriminates Kornilov in an attempt to deceive the investigation. He shows the reports on the same conversations written by Kutorgu: a former priest performed a similar task. And Kornilov is accused of anti-Soviet conversations. He is broken, the mouse trap is shut. As a result, Kornilov is openly recruited as a whistle-blower, selecting the undercover nickname Gadfly. After Zybin has demanded to change the investigator, having declared a hunger strike, he is thrown in a solitary cell. There he is visited by the prosecutor Myachin and, suddenly, he easily agrees with Zybin requirements. Myachin is Neumann's enemy, and the idea of a loud trial seems delusional to him. At the same time there is one more circumstance: Polina Pototskaya, a longtime friend of Zybin and a bright woman request an appointment with the investigator Gulyaev. Gulyaev, Neumann and Myachin all talk to her. Pauline reports that there is another person with whom Zybin once had a confidential conversation: he is the head of the investigatory department of the Prosecutor's Office of the USSR, a famous writer Roman Stern. The message hits Neumann. After all Stern not only the figure of inaccessible level, but also the brother of Neumann. The situation becomes dangerous for Neumann himself. He knows that even the security officers are not eternal and his colleagues have already disappeared into oblivion. Besides, Neumann is also tormented by other fear, the expression of \\"squeezed terror\\" in his eyes: he cannot justify what he is doing. From these doubts Neumann comes out in a strange way: he changes Kriputin for his young niece Tamara Dolidze,- a beginner with the urge to work. Zybin is shocked by the phenomenon of the beautiful Tamara, but then he feels compassion for the fool who loves the romanticism of the KGB work. Having destroyed the scheme of accusation prepared by her, Zybin tries to explain her the mistakes she did and she has no answer for that. Zybin, who has been ill for a long time, loses consciousness right in the investigator's office. He is transferred to the hospital, and the investigation stops. Then Neumann decides to get irrefutable evidence against Zybin himself. He goes to the steppe on the trail of Zybin. And here he receives news about the change of leadership and the arrests of the investigators and that he is summoned to the office. Neumann realizes that his fate is predetermined. By a coincidence, Neumann finds the gold, which was the reason for Zybin's arrest, with which he returns to the city. Zybin is announced that his case is closed. He is free now. Zybin feels like a winner because he survived. Zybin, Neumann and Kornilov meet at the end of the novel. In the park, they drink a bottle for the liberation of Zybin. At the same time, Neumann, having accepted his fate, also loses his fear, but due to the fatal circumstances. Here, on the bench, they were captured by a local artist. So on a piece of cardboard those three remained forever: the expelled investigator, the drunken informant nicknamed Gadfly (all, apparently, times need their Gadfly) and the third one, without whom these two could not exist.  Historical background  The novel The Faculty of Useless Knowledge (as well as his \\"prologue\\" - \\"Guardian of Antiquities\\") is in many ways autobiographical novel. The history of Zybin's arrest is also the history of the arrest of Yuri Dombrovsky himself. Investigators are deduced in the novel under their own names. The heroine of the novel Klara is Klara Fazulaevna Turumova-Dombrovskaya,the future the wife of the writer. The story of the artist Kalmykov is a true story of life of a man who settled in Almaty in 1935.  Critical reception  Literary scholar Valentin Nepomniyashchy, characterizes Dombrovsky's prose in his notes: \\"His novels are the author himself. According to the absolute realism of the narration, based solely on the common sense of iron logic and motivation, the complete absence of claims to the poetry, his prose is the machine with multiple details. But this machine is designed to fly and it flies like a bird. The design itself is airy ... He writes his prose in this way - as if he does not create, namely, tells us how it was, and immediately explains everything necessary to be understood correctly, without playing with the reader in any artistic games. And he gets the feeling that it is not an artistic prose at all, but a true being, almost documentary.Непомнящий В. Homo liber: (Юрий Домбровский) // Домбровский Ю. Хранитель древностей. М., 1991. С. 6—7.» Another Gulag writer Varlam Shalamov, who had been friends with Dombrovsky for some time, said about the \\"Guardian of Antiquities\\" that it was \\"the best book about the thirty-seventh year\\". He also spoke well of the \\"Faculty...\\" and the rest of Dombrovski's prose. The critic Igor Zolotussky, one of the first reviewers of the novel, noticed: \\"Yuri Dombrovsky makes it clear that the Christian idea is unthinkable without Christ, without his human behavior in conditions of cruelty and lawlessness. Only through his Son, through the same person as other people living on earth, God could find a way to the heart of mortals.Золотусский И. Палачи и герои // Литературная Россия. 1988. 18 ноября. Critic I. Shtokman calls \\"The Faculty of Useless Knowledge\\" the \\"top of creativity\\" of the writer and draws attention to the fact that the architectonics of the novel \\"are exquisitely artistic with multiple levels of complexity... surprisingly well thought-out and complete. For all its diversity and multi-structure, the novel lies in the palm of the hand tightly as a sphere (the most perfect of all forms!), as a kind of charge for slinging, which has already become a weapon from a simple stone\\".Shtokman I. Arrow in flight: (Biography lessons of Yury. Dombrovsky) // Questions of literature. 1989. № 3. С. 99. Critic E. Ermolin wrote: \\"Having read \\"The Faculty\\", I would say with a full measure of responsibility: this is the last great Russian novel in time (1975). A third of the century passed without Yuri Dombrovsky, and his main novel is not just, as it is commonly said, retains lasting significance. Somehow, it even grew in its artistic value.\\" Ermolin E.

Whishaw is a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of Lethbridge and has authored over 460 scientific papers and five books on neuroscience subjects that include a wide range of mammalian species... His interests include varsity football, rugby, basketball, creative writing, and dog and horse training. Research and Theories Whishaw has contributed to scientific understanding of areas including but not limited to hypothalamic organization, feeding, drinking, brain damage and recovery, child development, and cognitive and behavioral disorders and the evolution of skilled motor behavior. He is best known for his work on movement and the motor cortex, spatial navigation, and the behavior of the laboratory rat. Movement and the Motor Cortex Whishaw is considered a world expert on hand and finger use of rodents. He found that rats use their hands and fingers to pick things up; a discovery that extended our understanding that the skilled movements thought to uniquely characterize primates includes other orders of vertebrates. The finding led to the study of the use of the forelimb in feeding behavior across all vertebrate species with the conclusion that forelimb use in feeding is conserved and extends to the phylogenetically earliest vertebrates. He further proposes that forelimb use includes at least three movements, a reach that extends arm/hand in relation to the extrinsic (location) properties of objects, a grasp that is made in relation to the intrinsic (size/shape) features of objects, and a withdraw that carries a grasped object to the mouth. Each of the movements is proposed to feature its own neural pathway or channel from sensory receptors to motor effectors and its own evolutionary history, accounting for the wide variety of hand and finger use skills in vertebrates. This work was influential in developing Feeding in Vertebrates, a book co-authored with Vincent Bels. The channel theory is also influential in understanding how movement is affected by injury or disease. The understanding of the rodent forepaw dexterity and use led to a range of studies that including motor cortex organization, neural plasticity, limb preference, dopamine release, sensory control, and other areas of behavior and physiology. Whishaw’s work on rodent forelimb reaching influenced similar research approaches to humans , with broad implications for brain injury and rehabilitation research. He is also responsible for developing a mouse model of skilled hand use that is useful for studying impairments, compensation, and recovery following brain or spinal injury. Whishaw’s research is recognized as helping the approximately 60,000 Canadians that suffer from brain injury each year, including stroke, Huntington disease and Parkinson disease . Spatial Navigation Much of Whishaw’s early work on brain function was based on EEG recordings made from the hippocampus and neocortex that showed that electrical brain events are related to ongoing movement and so do not reflect mental states . He has described himself as a “Vanderwolfian”, accrediting his careful study of animal behavior to his PhD supervisor, Case Vanderwolf with subsequent influences from Philip Tietelbaum. His work on spatial navigation argues that the hippocampus is important for the spatial behavior a dead reckoning, the relatively automatic process of determining the shortest way back to a starting location after an outward trip. Dead reckoning is the navigation strategy used by Columbus to reach the America’s and return to Spain. The dead reckoning theory proposes that there are three aspects of space that are central to an animal’s survival; where home is, where the animal is at the movement, and how to return home. He also suggests in Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews in 1998 rats with hippocampal lesions have considerable place learning ability that they are often unable to capitalize on it because of their dead reckoning impairment. The Behavior of the Laboratory Rat In addition to his expertise in rodent reaching and spatial behavior, Whishaw is known as “The Rat Whisperer” for his extensive experience and knowledge of rodent behavior. He compiled his extensive knowledge of rodent behavior in his 2004 book The Behavior of the Laboratory Rat, coedited with colleague Bryan Kolb, with various models and tests to quantify rodent behavior. The individual chapters of the book highlight the extraordinary range of complex natural and laboratory-based behavior displayed by a rat and underline the challenges in understanding how this behavior is produced by a brain that weighs only 2 grams. This book is the foundation for comparative investigations of the similarities and differences between rats and other mammals. Early life and education Ian Whishaw was born on July 14, 1939 to Quentin and Lorna Whishaw in Johannesburg, South Africa. Ian’s father worked as a geologist and served in World War II as a South African pilot. His mother was fluent in 7 languages and worked as a linguist and spy for the secret service throughout the war. She subsequently studied for her PhD and is the author of two books. As Far as You’ll Take Me describes a hitchhiking trip through the Yukon and Alaska and Mexico Unknown describes her and her daughter Iona’s adventure of driving the first car over the newly constructed PanAmerican highway. After the war, the family moved to England where Ian was enrolled in a boarding school. He attended less than a year before being expelled for misbehavior. At age six, Ian traveled alone by ship from Liverpool to Montreal, Canada. He then took a train across Canada to Invermere, British Columbia where he was reunited with his family. He was raised on Kootenay Lake in Queens Bay and received his primary education in schools in the Kootenay district. Ian attended Vancouver College for his secondary education, and his post-secondary began at the University of Notre Dame’s Indiana campus. He then transferred to the Nelson campus, then the Gonzaga campus in Washington. He went on to complete a B.A. in English at the University of Alberta’s Calgary campus in 1965. Whishaw received his M.Sc. in Physiological Psychology from the University of Calgary in 1968 under the supervision of Dr. Ron Cooper. His master’s thesis was titled “Strychnine: Suppression of Exploration”, and was published the following year in Physiology and Behavior. Whishaw then completed his Ph.D. in 1971 at the University of Western Ontario under the supervision of Case Vanderwolf. His Ph.D. thesis was titled \\"Hippocampal Activity and Behavior\\" and was published in the Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology in 1972. Whishaw started as an assistant professor at the University of Lethbridge in 1970, where he was responsible for teaching five different courses per semester. He worked with Warren Veale in the summers of 1971 and 1972 at the University of Calgary and completed his own lab at the University of Lethbridge in 1972. Despite his small lab in a small undergraduate college with limited resources, Whishaw authored over 200 publications by the time his university offered its first M.Sc. He has done sabbaticals with Philip Teitlebaum, one of the leaders in physiological psychology, Stephen Dunnett, a pioneer in neural transplantation, at the University of Cambridge, England, and with Bruno Will in Strasbourg France and with Michel le Moal in Bordeaux, France. Whishaw is currently a professor of neuroscience at the University of Lethbridge, where he has directly mentored over 30 graduate students and grandfathered nearly 200 graduate students across Canada, the United States, and Europe. Whishaw holds a Board of Governor’s Chair in Neuroscience, and has had visiting appointments at the University of Texas, the University of Michigan, Cambridge University, and the University of Strasbourg, France. Awards and Honors Whishaw has received numerous awards for his contributions to neuropsychology, including fellowships to the Canadian Psychological Association, the American Psychological Association, Clare Hall of Cambridge University, and the Royal Society of Canada Academy of Science. He has also received an honorary Doctor of Letters from the University of Lethbridge (2008) and an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Thompson Rivers University (2010). Whishaw received the Karl Spencer Lashley Award from the Canadian Psychological Association, and the CSBBCS Donald O. Hebb Award in 2014 for Distinguished Scientific Achievement. He is a member of the Hotchkiss Brain Institute in Calgary, and president of NeuroDetective, Inc, Neurotext Inc, and a board member of NeuroInvestigations Inc. The University of Lethbridge awarded Dr. Whishaw the Ingrid Speaker Gold Metal, the university’s highest honor, to recognize his research, scholarship, and teaching. The Institute for Scientific Information lists him as one of the most cited Neuroscientists, one of only 10 Canadians, the only Albertan, with the 2014 highest H-index of all neuroscientists in Canada. Whishaw has also been recognized for his contributions as a teacher, leader and mentor in the neuroscience community. He received the distinguished teaching award from the University of Lethbridge, and the Alberta Science and Technology Outstanding Leadership in Alberta Science Award in 2009. Books and Other Public Outreach Whishaw has cowritten two textbooks with colleague Bryan Kolb which have been published in multiple languages. Their first book, Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology, a pioneering textbook of the new disciple of neuropsychology was originally published in 1980 and is now in its seventh edition with over 4,500 citations. Their second book, An Introduction to Brain and Behavior, features a human-centric approach to the basic science of the brain and is currently in its sixth edition. Both books are used as required reading for students enrolled in liberal arts at the University of Lethbridge. In 2004, Whishaw and Kolb published The Behavior of the Laboratory Rat: A Handbook with Tests, which has been described as a bible for rat researchers with over 200 citations and chapters on fear, pain, taste, sex, stress, and models and tests for rat behavior. Whishaw’s other books include in 2017, Brain and Behaviour: Revisiting the Classic Studies, and the Evolution of Feeding in Vertebrates in 2019. Personal Life Whishaw is married to Susan Elliott and they have two sons, Gavian and Paul, and one granddaughter, Suzu. His sister Iona is author of the Lane Winslow mystery series. He has maintained a close personal and working relationship with coworkers, former students and fellow scientists, including Terry Robinson and Timothy Schallert, Jenni Karl and his enduring writing partner, Bryan Kolb.

He is known for his work in animal ethics, especially around the question of wild animal suffering. He has also worked on the concept of speciesism and on the clarification of the arguments for the moral consideration of nonhuman animals. Career Horta completed an undergraduate degree in philosophy at USC in 1999, going on to complete a doctorate in philosophy at the same institution in 2007. His thesis was entitled Un desafío para la bioética: la cuestión del especismo (A Challenge to Bioethics: The Issue of Speciesism). In 2008, he won the Ferrater Mora Prize from the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics, for his essay on the ethics of Spanish philosopher José Ferrater Mora. From 2005 to 2009, he was a lecturer in the Department of Logic and Moral Philosophy at USC. He subsequently took up a visiting researcher position at Rutgers University from 2009-10 and a research fellowship at the Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology from 2009-11. He returned to USC in 2011 as a lecturer, and became a professor in 2018.Horta, Oscar. 2019. \\"CV\\". Academia.edu. Accessed 21 April 2019. Besides co-founding Animal Ethics, Horta co-founded Rights for Animals and Liberación Animal. He has acted as a spokesperson for ALA-Alternativa para la Liberación Animal and Fundación Equanimal, and is a member of the advisory board for the Sentience Institute, UPF-Centre for Animal Ethics, and Organisation for the Prevention of Intense Suffering. Horta is vegan and has commented that \\"the reason why I decided to go vegan was that I was presented with what I saw as strong arguments to do so, not that I was feeling empathy towards nonhuman animals.\\" Speciesism Horta has defined speciesism as discrimination against those who do not belong to one or more species, understanding by discrimination an unjustified unequal consideration or treatment. This is a normative account of the concept. According to Horta, if treating animals of different species in different ways is justified then it cannot be considered discriminatory and it is not an instance of speciesism. Horta's account also denies that speciesism is confined to discrimination on the basis of species alone. Horta's account regards as speciesist all forms of discrimination against those who are not members of a certain species regardless of whether the reason is mere species membership or other reasons (such as the possession of complex cognitive abilities).An alternative, description account is defended in He has argued in favor of this position by analogy to sexism or racism, which typically include discrimination against women or racialized people based on criteria such as their alleged capacities (not only gender, sex, ancestry, or physical traits).Horta, Oscar. 2010. \\"What is speciesism?\\" Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics 23 (3): 243-66, pp. 244-27. Horta's account of speciesism is also similar to Joan Dunayer's but unlike Paul Waldau's in that he has also argued that discrimination against nonhuman animals is only one instance of speciesism, which can be referred to as anthropocentric speciesism, because it is also possible to discriminate against some nonhuman animals in comparison to others in ways that are speciesist. Wild animal suffering Horta argues that, contrary to an \\"idyllic\\" view of the wilderness, animals suffer significantly in nature from disease, predation, exposure, starvation, and other threats. Horta rejects speciesism, and thus argues that we have good reason to intervene in natural processes to protect animals from this suffering when it is possible to do so without causing more harm.Horta, Oscar. 2010. \\"Debunking the idylic view of natural processes: Population dynamics and suffering in the wild\\".

Current ways of helping include rescues of animals during natural disasters, centres for orphaned, sick, and injured animals, and vaccination and feeding programs.Animal Ethics. 2016.

Environmental Ethics 39 (3): 261-79 . He has also argued that the most promising courses of action right now may consist in gaining more knowledge about the conditions causing wild animal suffering and about how to best carry out measures that can improve the situation of animals affected by natural (or a combination of natural and indirectly anthropogenic) causes.Horta, Oscar. 2018. \\"Concern for Wild Animal Suffering and Environmental Ethics: What Are the Limits of the Disagreement?\\".

He collaborated closely with the British Secret Intelligence Service. André Gerolymatos, The British and the Greek Resistance, 1936–1944: Spies, Saboteurs, and Partisans, σελ.144–146, 2018, Lexington Books Life Panayotis Lykourezos was born in Athens in 1900. His father, Constantine Lykourezos, was a prominent Public prosecutor who later entered politics and served as Minister of Justice, while his younger brother, Pausanias Lykourezos, also entered politics, was elected to the Hellenic Parliament and served as Interior Minister. He graduated from the Hellenic Naval Academy and became an officer in the Hellenic Navy, from which he eventually resigned in the late 1930s with the rank of Lieutenant Commander (plotarches) in order to enter the shipping business. However, after the start of World War II, he was called back to active service. After the start of the Nazi occupation, he formed the resistance organization Codrus (named after the ancient king), working closely with the British Secret Intelligence Service. His most important contribution came on 6 October 1943, when he was able to inform MI6 (which in turn informed the British Royal Navy) that a convoy of German ships had departed from the port of Piraeus and was heading to recently-liberated island of Leros. Although the Nazis eventually managed to re-conquer Leros, the British on this occasion successfully sank all German ships. Lykourezos was congratulated personally by Admiral Cunningham.

Katleman's allegorical installations fall within the genre of pop surrealism, combining decorative elements, such as Rococo embellishments and 19th century Toile de Jouy wallpaper scenery, with satirical references to consumer culture, fairy tales and classic literature. Katleman's work is in private and institutional collections and is exhibited internationally, including an installation commissioned by architect Peter Marino for Christian Dior, in the Hong Kong and London flagship boutiques. She lives and works in Brooklyn, New York, and is the recipient of the 2011 Moët Hennessey Prize, a Mid-Atlantic Arts Foundation grant, the Watershed Generation X Award, a Kohler Arts/Industry Fellowship and a residency in Cortona, Italy sponsored by the University of Georgia, Athens. Katleman holds a BA in English from Stanford University, an MFA from Cranbrook Academy of Art and an MBA in Arts Management from UCLA.  Influences  Katleman's work addresses dualities between nature and culture; order and chaos; kitsch and fine art; dark humor and optimism; consumption and desire. Her sculpture is informed by parallels and differences between classic European decorative arts and American pop culture. The objects that she casts into sculpture are sourced from dime store trinkets, gadgets, dolls and toys. Katleman is influenced by porcelain rooms, such as The Royal Palace of Aranjuez in Spain; Toile de Jouy wallpaper found in Versailles and the Victoria and Albert Museum; and time studying Italian porcelain reliefs in the Salottino di Porcellana room at the Royal Palace of Capodimonte, Naples, which she visited during an artist residency at the American Academy in Rome. Her early work incorporated bright colored glazes, gold details and overt references to pop art. Katleman's work has been included in group exhibitions intended to blur distinctions between fine art and design. In 1998 a work from the toilet series, produced during her Kohler Arts/Industry Fellowship, was included in “Bathroom’ at the Thomas Healy Gallery, alongside Andy Warhol and John Waters. In 2019 the Rhode Island School of Design Museum invited Katleman to create a site-specific installation in response to the 1969 exhibition, “Raid the Icebox I with Andy Warhol”. In 2010 Katleman transitioned to working entirely in white porcelain, often installed as sculptural tableaus to produce a three-dimensional wall paper effect. Literature, in particular classical mythology and fairy tales, also inspires the work.  Process  Katleman fabricates her sculptures using hand cast porcelain objects that are combined into a singular composition and kiln fired without a glaze to produce a matte white surface. A completed installation can contain up to 3,500 individual cast elements. The molds used to produce the castings are made after combinations of source materials are experimented with, using digital imaging software and hand drawn renderings. These 2d compositions are then used to visualize placement while working with figures from her studio library of objects  Exhibitions  *Raid the Icebox Now, RISD Museum, Providence, Rhode Island *2018- Strange Arcadia, Spagnuolo Art Gallery, Georgetown University, Washington D.C. *2017- Confabulations of Millennia, Institute of Contemporary Art, Portland, Maine *2016- Unconventional Clay, Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, Missouri *2016- Contemporary Clay: A Survey of Contemporary American Ceramics, Western Carolina University Fine Arts Museum, Cullowee, North Carolina *2015- Tchotchke: Mass-Produced Sentimental Objects in Contemporary Art, The Gund Gallery, Gambier, Ohio *2011- Flora and Fauna: MAD about Nature, Museum of Art and Design, New York, New York *2011- Folly, Jane Hartsock Gallery, New York, New York *2011- Pavilion of Art and Design, New York, New York, London, England and Paris, France, Todd Merrill Studio Contemporary *2009- Selections from the Kohler Company Collection, 798 ArtZone, Beijing, China New Works/Old Story, Contemporary Jewish Museum, San Francisco, California *2008- The Diane and Sandy Besser Collection, M.H. de Young Museum, San Francisco, California *2000- Blown Away, Garth Clark Gallery, New York, New York *1998- Bathroom, Thomas Healy Gallery, New York, New York, curated by Wayne Koestenbaum *1996- The Pull of Beauty, Storefront for Art and Architecture, New York and the National Building Museum, Washington, D.C., curated by Kiki Smith and Victoria Milne *1994- Artists from the Archie Bray Foundation, Holter Museum of Art, Helena, Montana and University of Washington Art Gallery, Seattle, Washingthon  Collections  *Nike, United States *M.

(2000). American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America. New York, NY: Oxford University Press. p. 20. The use of Massachusett Pidgin English co-existed in Massachusett-speaking communities with their original dialects as well as Massachusett Pidgin, another contact language that was Massachusett-based. Unlike Massachusett Pidgin, which was confused with the Massachusett language by the English colonists, attestations of Massachusett Pidgin English are quite numerous. As few of the colonists were able to or willing to master either Massachusett or its Pidgin variety, those that traded and lived directly next to Indian villages communicated in Massachusett Pidgin English.Bragdon, K. J. (1981). 'Linguistic acculturation in Massachusett: 1663-1771' in Papers of the 12th Algonquian Conference. Cowan, W. (ed.) Ottawa, ON: Carleton University. The use of Massachusett Pidgin English supplanted the use of Massachusett Pidgin and likely even overtook the native language in community. In a process likely to decreolization, the speakers of Massachusett Pidgin English began to adjust their language to the English of their neighbors, and since the nineteenth century, all the descendants of the Massachusett-speaking peoples have been monolingual English speakers.Speck, F. G. (1928). Territorial Subdivisions and Boundaries of the Wampanoag, Massachusett and Nauset Indians. Frank Hodge (ed). Lancaster, PA: Lancaster Press. p. 46. Massachusett Pidgin English and Massachusett Pidgin are of special interest to scholars of the English language as it seems that these two languages were the vectors of transmission of Algonquian loan words into the English language. The English settlers of New England called the specialized Indian vocabulary 'wigwam words,' after wigwam, the Massachusett Pidgin and Massachusett Pidgin English term for 'house' or 'home' instead of the Massachusett term ().Goddard, I. (2000). 'The Use of Pidgins and Jargons on the East Coast of North America' in The Language Encounter in the Americas, 1492-1800: A Collection of Essays Gray, E. G. and Fiering, N. (eds). (pp. 74-75). New York, NY: Bergahn Books. Unfortunately, as the English settlers and their descendants pushed westward, they retained elements of Massachusett Pidgin English, especially vocabulary, in dealings with other tribes, and many of the words used innocently by the Pilgrims and Puritans of New England, such as 'squaw,' 'sannup,' 'wampum' and 'peace pipe,' are viewed by most Native peoples today as pejorative, racist insults due to their use by the English settlers and pioneers, and use of these terms by White teachers in Native American public schools is believed to be one reason for the high dropout rates of Native students in U.S. schools.Harris, LaDonna. 2000. LaDonna Harris: A Comanche Life. Stockel, H. H. (ed.), (p. 59.) Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press. History =English contacts prior to 1620= The Pilgrims were shocked to be greeted in English by Samoset with a 'Hello, Englishmen!' A visiting sachem from Monhegan Island, Samoset would later introduce the English Pilgrims to Squanto who was even more fluent in English. Squanto would later aid the Pilgrims as an important middleman in relations with the Wampanoag tribes around them, such as that of Massasoit, but also taught them how to survive by teaching them local agricultural practices. Only a handful of visits by the English are recorded. Bartholomew Gosnold established a short-lived trading post on Cuttyhunk Island in 1602. John Smith mapped the region in 1612, and stopped in several Massachusett and Wampanoag villages to trade for supplies and meet the local leaders. In 1607, the Popham Colony was established, but abandoned after a year due to infighting between political factions. Encounters were definitely more frequent than previously thought. English fishermen began setting up camps onshore in Newfoundland in 1520, and may have ventured further south to partake of the rich bounty of cod. Samoset's encounters with English fishermen on his home island were frequent enough that he was able to recount the names of several captains and their crewmen. Both Squanto and the Nauset sachem Epenow were abducted by English blackbirding ships, which would capture local Natives for sale as slaves or to display as oddities. Squanto and Epenow were lucky to escape by finding work as interpreters on vessels trading along the coast until they found their way home and could plot with their kinsmen.Greene, Jes. (2015). The Horrible Reason Squanto Already Knew English When He Met the Pilgrims. Modern Notion. Retrieved 15 April 2016. The practice of capturing Natives was so prevalent that William Shakespeare references it in The Tempest, where he writes, 'Any strange beast makes a man [prosperous], they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, [but] they will give ten [pence] to see a dead Indian.'Vaughan, A.

Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press. pp. 49-59. The horrors that it caused the community were explained to the Pilgrims, as several locals, including an aged woman, recounted their sufferings to the Pilgrims with Samoset and Squanto translating.Mourts Rebellion (likely Edward Winslow) in Young, Alexander, ed.

Features =Massachusett Pidgin loan words= The majority of terms were taken from the English language. However, numerous terms were taken from the local Algonquian languages, usually via Massachusett Pidgin, to describe Indian culture, technology and material culture and local plant and animal terms. Most of these words come from Massachusett, although some words were either archaic retentions or cognate borrowings from Narragansett or the Abenakian languages, all of which were closely related. In many ways, Massachusett Pidgin English seems to be Massachusett Pidgin relexified with English words. * netopGoddard, I. (2000). p. 34., 'friend,' from Massachusett Trumbull, J. H.

It is believed that most Indians pronounced English words either as close to English as possible, such as those that interacted frequently with English speakers or for the many women and children that worked as indentured servants in English households. Others likely substituted the closest approximate Algonquian phonology to approximate the sounds. Massachusett lacked /b/, /d/, /f/, /g/, /dʒ/, /ʒ/, /θ/, /ð/ and /ŋ/ and the distinction between voiced and unvoiced consonants and permitted far fewer consonant clusters than English. Evidence of this pronunciation interference includes different spellings of English loan words in the Massachusett documents, such as the English word 'Frenchmen' which was rendered as borrowed , possibly with English-influenced pronunciation by proficient speakers, or also attested possibly indicating influence of Massachusett phonology. A similar process occurs Malaysian Malay, where the Arabic loanword redha is pronounced as in imitation of Classical Arabic if one is educated or have familiarity with Arabic as opposed to the general pronunciation of . Similarly, English speakers from the Commonwealth countries pronounce 'penchant' as the French do, , as opposed to the nativized pronunciation preferred in the U.S., . Two English phonemes, and , were either dropped or replaced by in loan words that were adopted into Massachusett. Although this is not always shown in the documents recording Massachusett Pidgin English written by the colonists, spelling in Massachusett documents by the Indians show that words with 'r' and 'l' were replaced by 'n' due to influence of language development. Proto- Eastern Algonquian reflexes of *r were unstable in the development of Massachusett. For example, the word for 'dog' in Massachusett is () but is in Nipmuc and in Quiripi. Similarly, the word 'share' and 'apple' often appear in Massachusett-language documents as and , indicative of Southern New England Algonquian N-dialect interference.Costa, D. J. (2007).

Among his siblings, only he chose to stay in Zaltbommel; the others spread across the world to benefit their business. Lion married Sophie Pressburg from Nijmegen. Sophie's sister Henriëtte married German lawyer Heinrich Marx and was the mother of Karl Marx. Sophie and Lion had nine children, including August Philips, who was a lawyer and dean of the Amsterdam Bar Association; and banker Frederik Philips who, together with his son Gerard Philips, established the Philips Electronics Company, the first Dutch incandescent light company, in 1891. Gerard's younger brother Anton joined the company in 1912.A Heering Translated by Derek S. Jordan The History of N. V. Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken.

Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken: Volume 2, A Company of Many Parts Cambridge University Press 1989  Career In 1815, Lion and a partner, Gerlacus Ribbius Peletier, started a tobacco company, \\"The Unicorn\\". The successors of this company remained active in the tobacco trade until the second half of the twentieth century. In addition to trading tobacco, the Philips pursued other businesses, including a blanket factory, which later burned down. At the time of his death in 1866, his capital was estimated at around NLG 189,000.  Religion The Philips family was of Jewish origin. Lion Philips and his father Benjamin joined the Dutch Reformed Church on 1 February 1826 with their respective families. Full Jewish emancipation had been in place in the Netherlands since 1796, eliminating trade and other obstacles to the faith.  Karl Marx Marx and Philips had a close relationship; Marx regularly stayed with the Philips family in Nijmegen and later in Zaltbommel. Seven letters to Marx and seven to Philips are known. These letters cover issues ranging from the American Civil War to the invention of electricity. One of the main reasons for the strong involvement was money. Philips was Marx's main sponsor and the business mediator between him and Henriëtte Pressburg. This was necessary, because the relationship between Marx and his mother was poor, Marx writing: \\"I have fallen out with my family and, as long as my mother lives, I have no right to my inheritance\\".Karl Marx to Arnold Ruge, 25 January 1843. Marx-Engels-Werke. Vol 27, p. 415. As a result, Philips granted Marx allowances, first from the legacy of Heinrich Marx, then as advances on the legacy of Henriëtte. After Henriëtte's death in 1863, Lion, who was named one of her executors, paid what remained after Karl's inheritance: seven thousand guilders, a considerable sum. In addition, Philips occasionally offered extras: \\"I initially extorted £160 pounds from my uncle so that we could pay off most of our debts,\\" Marx writes to Friedrich Engels on 7 May 1861. Marx found 'a hospitable home' with Lion Philips and his family. In addition, he was able to \\"conduct intellectual discussions with open-minded, liberal ubiquists\\".  Cultural reference In the Soviet TV series Karl Marks, Molodye gody (, \\"Karl Marx's early years\\") the role of Lion Philips is played by the Ukrainian actor Leonid Bronevoy.  Bibliography * A.

Her work includes drawing, sculpture, and public art .  Early life and education  Ellen Driscoll was born in Boston in 1953. She studied at Wesleyan University where she received a B.F.A in 1974 (cum laude). She obtained her M.F.A in sculpture from Columbia University in 1980. She was a professor of sculpture at Rhode Island School of Design for 21 years, and was a visiting professor at Bard College in 2018.  Career  Her work is a search for finding connections through materials, between entities that appear to be unrelated on the surface. She has worked on a wide range of topics, including environmental, cultural, and sociopolitical themes. = Style = Her work encompasses drawing, sculpture and public art. Some of her early sculptures, such as The Loophole of Retreat at the Whitney Museum at Phillip Morris (1991) and Passionate Attitudes at Threadwaxing Space, New York (1995), were primarily mixed media and found objects. During her residency at the MacDowell Colony in 2007, Ellen Driscoll made a commitment to work solely with re-purposed and found materials. She was working at the time in collaboration with Golnar Adili and Aimee Burg, on an installation at Wave Hill for \\"Thoreau Reconsidered\\". The art connected the ideas of the philosophers' self-reliance, egalitarianism, and respect, with the collection, cleaning, and fabricating of sculpture with materials removed from the waste stream. She started to retrieve plastic bottles directly from the streets to create artwork such as Phantom Limb, FastForwardFossil Part 2, and Still Life. = Themes = Her current work are labor intensive sculptural landscapes criticizing the oil industry and over consumption. She is a member of the collective Project Vortex, which aims to educate the general public about the impact of plastics and plastic pollution. = Reception = She is the recipient of numerous awards, including a Sculpture Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1984, a Sculpture Fellowship from the New York Foundation for the Arts in 1985, and the Guggenheim Fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation 1987. She was recently awarded the International Sculpture Center’s Outstanding Educator Award.  Work  = Major exhibitions = She has had numerous solo exhibitions, among them, Fastforwardfossil Part 2 at Smack Mellon in Brooklyn, NY in 2009, Fastforwardfossil part 3 at the West Cork Arts Centre, Skibbereen in Ireland in 2010, and “Venti Trasversali (Crosswinds)” at the Museo di Storia Naturale dell’ Accademia dei Fisiocritici in Siena, Italy, in 2016. = Public collections = The Loophole of Retreat was commissioned in 1991 for the Whitney Museum at Phillip Morris. Her first major public art commission from the MTA's Percent for Art program is As Above, So Below at the Grand Central Terminal in New York City (1999). The glass, bronze, and mosaic work is an homage to the famous ceiling of Grand Central Terminal's main concourse, and depicts the night sky over 5 continents. Tales and myths from different civilizations about the origin of the world, and the movements of the stars and heavens, are depicting within each representation of the continents. As Above, So Below is a reminder that ancient stories about the stars, can in fact mirror our earthly daily routines.

Presented by the film critic Mark Kermode, in each episode Kermode examines the tropes which come together to make certain genres of cinema. The first series aired five episodes, and the series has since been followed by a selection of special editions. The BBC has since commissioned three more episodes. The series has attracted positive reviews from TV critics. Format In each episode, Kermode takes a different genre of cinema and examines the elements that go up to make the perfect example of what a film in that genre would be like. Animated captions list each trope, with Kermode then explaining each one using examples from various movies. Episodes =Series 1 (2018–19)= =Series 2 (2020)= In October 2019, the BBC announced that three more episodes of the series would be broadcast, covering Superheros, British history movies, and Spies. Production In an interview with Den of Geek, the chief writer of the series Kim Newman said that the reason for the creation of Secrets of Cinema was that: \\"there hasn't been a show like this before. Even in the deep history of TV discussions of cinema, they've always been about a director, a movie star, sometimes even a studio. One thing we've bent over backwards on is not to use the word genre in the title, or the publicity for the show. But that's what this is about!\\" Releases The entire first series of Secrets of Cinema was made free to watch on the BBC iPlayer from 12 December 2018, for several months. Reception Secrets of Cinema received positive reviews from TV critics. Sean O'Grady wrote in The Independent concerning \\"The Heist\\" episode: \\"It was a compelling watch because gradually every crime \\"caper\\" you've ever seen suddenly slotted into his minimalist structure, albeit one that sometimes gets twisted.\\" In The Observer, a newspaper Kermode also writes for, Euan Ferguson wrote in his review that, \\"I try to make it a rule never to be too nice to colleagues, let alone quote two in one piece, but I have to say Mark Kermode’s Secrets of Cinema was an endlessly refreshing delight. ... This was a splendid hour, could have run for three: you not only get Mark’s insights, often lancet-sharp, you get to see a lot of snatches of films.\\" In The Herald, Alison Rowat wrote humorously in her review: \\"Who does Mark Kermode think he is? Coming into our living rooms with his Mark Kermode's Secrets of Cinema, a five-part series that could have gone to some poor, starving, blonde, Glaswegian TV critic who takes in film reviewing and washing on the side?

She teaches at Tel Aviv University, Ben Gurion University, and the Academic College of Tel Aviv-Yafo. Her field of study focuses on the social expectations projected on women, both those who are mothers and those who are not, especially by choice.  Biography  Donath was born in Ramat Hasharon, the second of two daughters. Her mother is in computers, and her father is a business consultant. She completed her MA in sociology and anthropology at Tel Aviv University in 2007. Her thesis dealt with voluntary childlessness in the very pro-natal Israeli society. She continued on to complete her PhD at Tel Aviv University, on the topic of regretting motherhood. Both works of research were adapted into books: Regretting Motherhood (2017), and Mimeni VaHal'a: Bhira Behaim Bli Yeladim BeYisrael (Not my thing: The choice to live without children in Israel ממני והלאה: בחירה בחיים בלי ילדים בישראל; Hakibbutz Hameuchad 2011). After her PhD, Donath continued with a post-doc appointment at Ben Gurion University, at the Center for Women's Studies and Advancement. When Mimeni VaHal'a came out in 2011, it was the first research of its kind done in Israel. The study undermined one of the most cherished myths of Israeli society - that having children is a matter of destiny, not choice. Donath analyzed women's choices to not have children using both sociological and anthropological lenses, with the goal of explaining this choice in an accessible way. In the book, she provides an overview of the history of human procreation and how procreation is controlled and directed by those in power. She also reviews the concept of childhood, and how it has developed over time, and concludes that in Israel, in spite of various changes in the concept and structure of family, childlessness remains a choice that carries great stigma, and there is a long way to go before the choice to not have children is viewed as legitimate. A major distinction Donath insisted upon in her work was between voluntary childlessness and \\"life without children\\", pointing out that the two are not the same thing, while also distinguishing the choice from antinatalism, which is a philosophical or ideological objection to procreation, by anyone, and not simply a personal choice that can be made for a variety of reasons. Donath's second book, Regretting Motherhood, examines the attitudes of women from various backgrounds regarding child-rearing, both before and after they had children. The book collects the stories of 23 women talking about motherhood from a very personal place, and about their regret about becoming mothers, though they love and feel responsible for their children. In addition to bringing the individual perspective on a topic that is taboo in Israel, Donath examines commonly-held attitudes about motherhood, procreation, parenting, and more, and concludes that feeling regret about becoming a mother does not mean lacking skill or commitment as a parent. She wishes to undermine the socially- accepted idea that being a woman inherently includes motherhood, and claims that pushing women in motherhood can cause them great suffering. Donath discusses the pressures placed on women, whose choices are seen as a threat to the status quo. The book received international attention, causing a storm when an interview with her was published in a German academic journal, and sparking a methodical discourse never before conducted in Israel or elsewhere. It has since been translated into multiple languages and published in many countries, including Taiwan, South Korea, Spain, Italy, Germany, the UK and the United States. In addition to her academic work, Donath has held several roles at the Hasharon rape crisis center, including education coordinator, course developer, and chairperson of the association.

The core of the region was the fertile, corn-producing area of the Hauran (as far as Deraa) and extended to the Golan Heights and beyond the river Yarmouk south to the Zarqa river, including Ajloun. The region was invaded by Tancred in 1100, and after intervention by Duqaq, the local emir agreed to Frankish suzerainty. In the period 1105–1126, the Franks of Jerusalem made several unsuccessful efforts to wrest control of the region from Damascus. During this time an accommodation was reached (which came to be repeatedly renewed by treaty up to the time of Saladin) recognizing the Terre de Suète as a condominium under the joint sovereignty of Damascus and the kingdom of Jerusalem. The treaty provided that each party took a third of the produce and revenues of Coele-Syria, with the remainder going to its inhabitants. The area north of the river Yarmouk remained largely demilitarized, with the Franks receiving the castles of al-Munaitirah and Ḥiṣn ibn ‘Akkār, and tribute from castles of Masyaf, Ḥiṣn al-Akrād and Ḥiṣn al- Tūfān. For most of the twelfth century the Franks maintained an important strongpoint south of the river at the cave fortress of Cave de Sueth, replacing the presence sought by the castle of al-Al.

It was then a Liberal/Labour dominated seat, and he was clearly defeated both times. In 1922, he was selected as the prospective candidate for East Surrey, a more affluent Conservative safe seat. He won the seat with a clear majority at the 1922 general election, and held the seat until the 1935 general election. Galbraith was expected to stand for re- election, but shortly after dissolution it was announced that he would be appointed as a county court judge in Leicester, which would render him unable to be elected to Parliament.

It was produced by The Van Beuren Corporation and released by the film company Pathé. It, like other Sound Fables at that time, features Milton and Rita, who resembles Mickey and Minnie Mouse greatly, so much so, Disney sued Van Beuren for the resemblance. The film's sound was recorded on the RCA Photophone System, a company whose sound systems were used by Pathé during these time frame.

Also, even though they are called Aesop's Sound Fables, Aesop isn't mentioned anyway in these short animated films. Plot Milton playing Turkey in the Straw in the bar. The film begins with Milton riding his horse comically around the West until he hears a wanted criminal roaming the West. Upon hearing this, Milton's mouse agrees to comically change to be the width of a twig, as a way of disguise. The criminal, who remains nameless throughout the entire short film, rides in front of a tree; and sees a Wanted sign with himself on it. He laughs, and comically shoots a skull and crossbones onto the other side, and afterwards; proceeds to ride off. Milton then blows a raspberry to the criminal, who then goes back to see what the noise was. The horse takes this opportunity to kick the criminal onto the floor. Milton and the horse both laugh, and then ride away. He rides to \\"The Last Chance Tavern\\", to people singing a song, with banjo accompaniment. In the bar, the pianist proceeds to play a waltz, which the bar begins to dance to. However, the lively enthusiastic attitude changes when the unnamed criminal returns to the bar, driving nearly everyone away. He walks around the bar, until coming to Milton playing Turkey in the Straw on the piano, who then finishes with Shave and a Haircut and pokes the criminal in the eye. This makes him spin with guns firing. Milton then proceeds to comically attach his underwear to the pianola (player piano), which in return, plays the same song. Rita laughs at the events, which angers the criminal enough for her to be kidnapped. After the criminal runs away with Rita, many cowboys seek to get her back, and end up chasing him. After arriving at a cliff-edge, the criminal gets his gun, and shoots every cowboy one-by-one. Milton survives the onslaught, as the criminal's gun jams. This begins a short chase, where Milton shoots the criminal off his horse. They begin to fence. Milton wins the fight, by comically cutting up the criminal like a potato, who then runs away. Milton then proceeds to comically eat the sword. Milton then grabs Rita, and dances with her. This ends with Rita passing out. Milton then proceeds to break the 4th wall, and tells the audience: Well? The film ends with Milton kissing Rita. Characters There are many characters in this short film, and just like the Sound Fables at that time, Milton is the main character, who is depicted as a heroic cowboy, who goes up against a tyrant. Rita is only seen in the final scene of the short, as a kidnapped damsel-in- distress. The wanted criminal is also an important character in the film, who is seen as a murdering tyrant. There is also many trivial characters, these include the bar pianist, and the other bar-goers; who dance to the pianist's music, some even playing other instruments; including the pan pipes. Reception Western Whoopee was released to critical acclaim by The Motion Picture News, Variety and The Film Daily. The Motion Picture News spoke very highly of the film, saying it is full of \\"laugh-provoking gags start-to- finish\\", and calling it \\"A splendid job\\", urging the cinema management to book it for their program. The Film Daily called it a \\"Fine Aesop Fable\\", even calling it \\"one of the best shorts in the series to date.\\" Whilst Variety said that it was a refreshing break from Farmer Al Falfa, and said the film's story was \\"nonsensical and fantastic\\".

Early life and military service  Conant was born on December 21, 1839 in Dublin, New Hampshire from a batch of triplets. He is a member of the Conant family. Conant moved to Littleton, Massachusetts in 1845. At the beginning of the American Civil War, Conant was a student in Natick, Massachusetts. On August 4, 1862, he enlisted as a corporal into Company I of the 39th Massachusetts, tasked with the defense of Washington, D.C. In August 1863, army recruiter George Luther Stearns organized and mustered the 3rd Colored Infantry in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Conant was promoted to the rank of captain and was placed in command of Company H. The 3rd Colored fought at the Second Battle of Fort Wagner, capturing the fort shortly after the famous assault by the 54th Massachusetts. In 1864, the regiment assisted in the capture of Jacksonville, Florida, and occupied much of coastal Florida. After the end of the war, the 3rd Colored was assigned to assist the Department of Florida in reorganizing the state. On September 13, 1865, Conant was promoted to the rank of major. The regiment was disbanded a month later, though Conant remained in Florida to aid in its reorganization.  Political career  After leaving the army, Conant, a Republican, settled in Jacksonville, becoming a prominent citizen popular with local African- Americans due to his command of the 3rd Colored during the war. Conant was selected to be the secretary of the state's Constitutional Convention in 1868 in Tallahassee, Florida, drafting the Reconstruction era so-called Constitution of Florida, derided as the \\"Carpetbagger\\" Constitution by opponents. While in Tallahassee, Conant served on the Leon County Voter Registration Board, and he is credited with helping enfranchise hundred of African-Americans in the area. The following month, Conant, who had been serving as a United State Commissioner for the Northern District of Florida, was appointed as the judge for the Leon County by Florida Governor Harrison Reed. He served until his resignation in 1869. In 1870, Conant was appointed as the 9th Florida Attorney General by Reed. He would only serve as the state's attorney general until 1871, when President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Conant as the United States Marshal for the Northern District of Florida. Conant received national attention for his 1871 arrest of four members of the Ku Klux Klan accused of several lynchings during the Jackson County War. Conant was reappointed by Grant at the end of his first term in 1875, and served until the end of his second term in 1879. In 1881, Conant represented Duval County in the Florida House of Representatives. He would only serve for that year due to the death of his daughter.  Personal life and death  In 1867, Conant married Frances Dewey, a native of Boston, Massachusetts. They had two children: Anne Whitney (1867 – 1881) and John Sherman (1877 – 1890), with Conant outliving both of them. Conant died at his home in Palatka, Florida on November 21, 1890. Conant served as the general manager of the Florida Southern Railroad from January 1883 until his death.  Burial and legacy  Conant is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1884, while he was serving as manager of the Florida Southern Railroad, the town of Conant, Florida in Lake County was established by a group of wealthy Englishmen and named for Conant, a major financier of the railroad. The town grew into a vacation destination for the wealthy, until the Greet Freeze in 1894 and 1895 forced the town to be abandoned. Much of the land where the town was is now incorporated in Lady Lake, Florida.

Her poems, mainly on Biblical and historical themes, appeared regularly in several literary annuals. Biography =Early life= Estella Hertzveld was born at The Hague in 1837 to Salomon Hartog Hertzveld and Devora Elka Halberstamm, the eldest of six children. Her father was a senior civil servant and taxation expert in the Ministry of Finance from a family of renowned rabbis; her grandfather, Hartog Joshua Hertzveld, served as Chief Rabbi of Overijssel and Drenthe from 1808 to 1864. Hertzveld distinguished herself at a young age as a gifted writer and poet, and was mentored by Dutch poet Carel Godfried Withuys. At the age of 14 she composed \\"Sauls Dood\\" ('Saul's Death'), which appeared in the ', then edited by Withuys, in 1852. The composition was recited to great approbation by poet Jacob van Gigh at a meeting of the Maatschappij tot Nut der Israëlieten. Because of her reputation, the baptized Jew Abraham Capadose dedicated to her his 1853 translation of Leila Ada, the Jewish Convert. In public letters to the Jewish press she distanced herself from Capadose's dedication and beliefs. =Career= Her poems soon appeared regularly in the Israëlietische Jaarboekje and the Almanak voor het schoone en goede, most notably \\"Elias in de Woestijn\\" ('Elias in the Desert', 1853) and \\"Tocht der Israëlieten door de Roode zee\\" ('Journey of the Jewish People Through the Red Sea', 1854).\\" She composed \\"Esther\\" for Samuel Israel Mulder's collection of Biblical poetry, and her 1856 work \\"Het Gebed\\" ('The Prayer') was translated into Hebrew by Abraham D. Delaville. In support of the devastating floods in 1855 and 1861 across the Netherlands, she published \\"God redt\\" and \\"Januari 1861\\", respectively, and in 1863 she wrote an epic poem to Empress Maria Theresa of Austria for the collection Historische vrouwen van het jaarboekje Aurora. Her poem \\"De Priesterzegen\\" ('The Priestly Blessing', 1853), which draws a link between the priests of the Temple service and the service in a ghetto synagogue, inspired paintings by Dutch Jewish painters Maurits Léon and Eduard Frankfort. At the same time, Hertzveld mastered German, English, French, Danish, Norwegian, Italian, and Hebrew, and began penning translations of novels in these languages. She translated from the German Ludwig Philippson's oratio Mose auf Nebo (1858), and from the English Grace Aguilar's Opzien tot God (1859). She also translated Norwegian articles by Henrik Wergeland, who advocated for the opening of Norway's borders to Jewish immigration. Prominent among Dutch literary circles, Hertzveld maintained close ties with other Dutch writers, including Geertruida Bosboom-Toussaint and Johannes Jan Cremer. She was often asked to give presentations at festive occasions, and was guest of honour at the consecration of a new schoolhouse and the new synagogues in Hardenberg (1855) and Delft (1862), for which she composed a series of hymns. =Later life= Hertzveld married Jacobus Hymans, a successful businessman from Veenendaal twenty-one years her senior, in Delft on 16 December 1863. After the wedding, officiated by Chief Rabbi Issachar Baer Berenstein, the two settled in Arnhem. They together had six children: (1864–1937), Dorothea Dina Estella (1865–1899), Hugo Siegfried Johan (1867–1944), Willem Dagobert George Marie (1868–1872), Leopold Maurits Bernard (1870–1904), and Maria Sophia Elisabeth (1871–1961). The poetry of her later career was characterized by its emphasis on social activism. Hertzveld composed \\"Lied der negerin, een dag vóór de vrijheid\\" in celebration of the abolition of slavery in the Dutch colonies in 1863; \\"Stemmen en zangen\\", decrying the Prussian invasion of Schleswig-Holstein in 1864, a copy of which her father gifted to Hans Christian Andersen during his second visit to the Netherlands in 1866; and \\"Het triomflied der beschaving\\", denouncing the horrors of war, in 1866. She co-founded and chaired the Arnhem division of the Arbeid Adelt in 1872, but stepped down after the death of her son Willem that year. A few years later she was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis. Still, she wrote a poem for an album presented to Prince Hendrik on the occasion of his marriage in the summer of 1878, and a verse in an album for Queen Emma in the fall of the same year. From 1880 she inhabitted a sanatorium in Reichenthal, Upper Austria. In anticipation of approaching death she arranged a collection of her poems, which was dedicated to her children and published under the title Gedichten van Estella Hijmans-Hertzveld by her brother-in-law George Belinfante in October 1881. She died a few weeks later at the age of 44. Publications Hertzveld's poems \\"Poezie,\\" \\"De laatste der Barden,\\" \\"Abd-el-Kader,\\" and \\"Het triomflied der beschaving\\" were featured in Jan Pieter de Keyser's Dutch Literature in the Nineteenth Century (1881), and the poem \\"Abram\\" in 's Bloemlezing der poëzie van Nederlandse dichteressen.

He was the best Japanese two-year-old of his generation in 1994 when he won all three of his starts including the Asahi Hai Sansai Stakes. In the following spring he took his unbeaten run to four with a win in the Yayoi Sho before his racing career was ended by injury. After his retirement from racing he became a very successful breeding stallion. He died in 2015 at the age of 23. Background Fuji Kiseki was a brown or black horse standing 1.63 metres high with a white star and a white sock on his right hind leg bred by the Shadai Farm. During his racing career he was owned by Yomoji Saito and trained by Sakae Watanabe. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Sunday Silence, who won the 1989 Kentucky Derby, before retiring to stud in Japan where he was champion sire on thirteen consecutive occasions. His other major winners included Deep Impact, Stay Gold, Heart's Cry, Manhattan Cafe, Zenno Rob Roy and Neo Universe.

It is located in Logan, Utah adjacent to the campus of Utah State University (USU). The institute provides religion classes to young adults age 18-30, serves as a meetinghouse for local congregations, and sponsors activities for students.  History  alt= = Building Construction = The Logan Institute was first opened in 1929, and has since been expanded with five additions. This has led to the building-block feel as different sections were added over time. List of Additions *1929 - When the institute opened, the structure contained a single chapel, lounge, library, and classrooms. *1938 - Addition introduced a ballroom, game room, and two kitchens. An apartment was also added to house the institute director and his family. The director's residence has now been repurposed for use as office space. *1960 - The institute was doubled in size with a second chapel, six more classrooms, a cultural hall, and offices. *1977 - A larger library, student lounge, and instructors' offices were all added. *1990 - The southeast section of the building was added with six classrooms and offices for local church leaders. *1994 - The most recent addition added a full-size gymnasium used for sports, social events, and weekly devotionals = Other History = Logan Institute's first graduating class Construction on the Logan Institute began in 1928 as the first institute of religion in the state of Utah. When the building was completed, it was dedicated by LDS Church president Heber J. Grant on Easter Sunday, 31 March 1929. When it opened, there was a total enrollment of 114 students and offered two classes: Bible Literature, and Moral Philosophy. The institute's first class graduated on 26 May 1935 and had 21 students. Thomas C. Romney was the first institute director and the only instructor until Milton R. Hunter was hired in 1936. On 25 January 2012, the building suffered from a minor fire that started in the second floor kitchen. The fire began when a box of apples was left on a stove burner, causing $18,000 in damages.

The study lounge also has many prints of photographs made during the church's filming of the Bible Videos series. The west chapel used to have a stained glass window, but after renovations the window is now only visible from the attic area. Library copy of 1830 edition Book of MormonThe library is the largest in the state for an institute of religion and contains several items of historic value, including an original copy of the Book of Mormon and a 1906 sacrament set from the Mendon ward.  Student Involvement  = Student Council = Student activities and events at the institute are organized by the local chapter of the Latter-day Saint Student Association (LDSSA). According to the Encyclopedia of Mormonism, LDSSA is \\"an organization which sponsors social, religious, and recreational activities for LDS college students and their friends.\\" It was first organized in 1966, with Richard Eyre serving as its first president. LDSSA is an approved campus club of USU where all students are welcome, regardless of religious affiliation. LDSSA is led by the Logan Institute Student Council. Whereas anyone can join LDSSA, the student council is a smaller group of students who have been selected by local church leaders. The student council consists of seven presidencies who each lead a different LDSSA committee. As of the 2019, LDSSA consists of the following committees: * Publicity * Music * Proclaim the Gospel * Service * Technology * Campus Relations * Enrollment = Choirs = The Logan Institute's first choir, the Delta Phi Chorus, was organized in 1957 to serve as \\"ambassadors of good will for the institute.\\" Today the institute has two different choirs: the Logan Institute Choir and the Logan Institute Singers (formally the Latter-day Voices). The Logan Institute Choir is open for all students to join, and typically has 200-300 members. The Logan Institute Singers is by audition only, and will travel to perform in other venues, such as in seminaries. The two choirs often combine to perform for special events such as semiannual concerts, the Joseph Smith Memorial Devotional, and for events held on Temple Square in Salt Lake City. The combined choir has performed for several worldwide young adult devotionals held in the Salt Lake Tabernacle when church general authorities have spoken, such as Lynn G. Robbins (2015) and Carl B. Cook (May 2019). A choir from the Logan Institute also performed in the priesthood session of the church's general conference in April 2016.  Devotionals  = Religion in Life = Each Friday, a Religion in Life devotional is held in the gymnasium. Students of all faiths are welcome to come listen to inspirational talks from a variety of speakers. Often, speakers are local church leaders or other influential figures. Other members of the community have also spoken such as when USU president Noelle E. Cockett spoke in September 2017. = Joseph Smith Memorial Devotional = The Joseph Smith Memorial devotional series is an annual devotional hosted by the institute in honor of Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. It is scheduled as close as possible to 23 December, Smith's birthday, and is usually held in USU's Smith Spectrum. The first devotional was held in 1944, and past speakers have included all who have served as church presidents since that time.

The four episodes are collectively considered to be the fifth entry in the When They Cry series, following Higurashi and Umineko, each of which had two sets of four episodes. Ciconia follows people trying to prevent the outbreak of World War IV. It is released episodically for Microsoft Windows and macOS, by 07th Expansion in Japan and by MangaGamer internationally, and is planned to be four episodes long. The first, \\"Phase 1: For You, the Replaceable Ones\\", was released on October 4, 2019, and the second is planned for release in 2020. The series is written by Ryukishi07 and produced by Nakao Bōshi, and features art by Ryukishi07 and Remotaro, and music by several returning series composers. It was designed to be different from Higurashi and Umineko, with a larger world compared to their isolated settings, and with the intent that the player can choose to just enjoy the story or optionally try to solve the mysteries themselves, a change influenced by the 1995 anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion. The story's set-up was also designed to be more condensed, with episode 1 roughly corresponding to the first half of Umineko in terms of plot progression. Overview Ciconia When They Cry is a visual novel set after the end of World War III. It follows Gauntlet Knights – young people trained to use a new military technology called the Gauntlet, which allows its user to fly, fight, and repel attacks – who have become friends and aim to prevent the outbreak of a fourth world war. Development Ciconia When They Cry is developed by 07th Expansion, with a scenario, original character designs and illustrations by Ryukishi07. The game is produced by Nakao Bōshi, and features graphics and coloring by Remotaro. The music is composed by returning When They Cry series staff, including Dai, Luck Ganriki, Xaki, and Akiyama Uni; and the opening theme is performed by Maria Sawada. The game is developed and released episodically, and is planned to be four episodes long. The game's title – \\"ciconia\\", a genus of birds in the stork family – comes from how the game focuses on child characters. While at a convention outside Japan, Ryukishi07 asked recurring 07th Expansion composer Gin Kreuz how to localize the title in Japanese to make it sound more appealing. Kreuz responded with \\"ciconia\\" as opposed to \\"chikonia\\". The latter, as Ryukishi07 claims, sounded similar to how a Japanese person would pronounce it. Convinced by how natural Kreuz's pronunciation sounded, Ryukishi07 opted for \\"ciconia\\", owing to its sound and how well he thought it fit the game's science fiction setting. =Writing= Production of the first game began in November 2017, while Ryukishi07 was working on the audio drama Haworthia, which was used to test Ciconia's concepts. It was announced the following year in July 2018 with an illustration of its protagonist, under the working title ●● no Naku Koro ni (\\"[Blank] When They Cry\\"), along with the expanded Umineko compilation Umineko no Naku Koro ni Saku, both of which were planned for release in Q4 2018. In October 2018, both were delayed until Q2/Q3 2019, due to inaccurate scheduling based on what Ryukishi07 had been physically capable of when he worked on Higurashi and Umineko about ten years prior, as well as due to the longer script compared to Higurashi and Umineko first episodes. Ryukishi07 intended for Ciconia to stand out from previous When They Cry games, and wanted change up some elements that had been recurring up until that point: he had for example specifically intended for the player to actively try to figure out the mysteries in Higurashi and Umineko, but changed this for Ciconia to also let the player simply enjoy the story. This decision was influenced by the 1995 anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion, which both presents a straightforward narrative and hints at larger mysteries of its world. Another change was the scope of the game's setting: the series had featured increasingly smaller settings, going from Higurashi isolated village to Umineko small island cut off from the outside world, so Ryukishi07 decided to create a When They Cry game set in a large world. To show gratitude to international fans of the series, he also specifically wrote the script to feature characters from around the world. Ciconia story was condensed compared to those in Higurashi and Umineko: both of them were split into four \\"question arcs\\" and four \\"answer arcs\\", where their mysteries are set up and solved, with an initial episode mainly serving to introduce the characters and setting. Meanwhile, Ciconia was constructed to span four episodes, with its equivalents of the \\"question arcs\\" condensed to give more room for its \\"answer arcs\\", with Ryukishi07 describing the end of Ciconia first episode as equivalent to Umineko third or fourth episode in terms of plot progression. This was in part done due to time, as the series' release schedule had meant that it had taken two years for just Umineko \\"answer arcs\\" to come out. =Music and visuals= The music tracks in the game were specifically composed to begin quickly, and give the listener a feeling for the song's mood within the first few seconds, as the developers wanted to avoid a situation where a scene ends before the player has gotten past a long prelude. As Ryukishi07 did not have the musical knowledge to describe what kind of music he wanted in the game, he would listen to a lot of music and send tracks that fit his vision to Dai, who would in turn write instructions based on those tracks for himself and the other composers. The game's character sprites were created in a collaboration between Ryukishi07 and Remotaro: Ryukishi07 would draw sketches of each sprite, and Remotaro would then draw the line art and paint the sprites. She would specifically try to preserve the style and charm of Ryukishi07's artwork, as she knew that there were fans of Higurashi and Umineko who were attached to Ryukishi's art, while still adding more details and trying to make the art shine with focus on texture, light and shadow. Release At Sakura-Con 2019, Ryukishi07 and video game publisher MangaGamer announced that they would release the game simultaneously in English and Japanese, coinciding with Summer Comiket 2019 on August 9, 2019. In July 2019, however, 07th Expansion announced that the game had been delayed until late September 2019; it was then delayed again, with the first episode, \\"Phase 1: For You, the Replaceable Ones\\", released on October 4, 2019 for Microsoft Windows and macOS. In Japan, it additionally got a physical release. The second episode is planned to be released at some point in 2020, following a delay from May 2020. The English localization is handled by ChronoTrig, Klashikari and other members of the translation group Witch Hunt, who previously worked on the English translations of Umineko and Rose Guns Days. They are also working on a localization of Umineko no Naku Koro ni Saku, but are on Ryukishi07's request prioritizing Ciconia. The English translation option was added to the Japanese physical release through a patch update in November 2019. =Episodes= Reception The first episode of Ciconia was well received by players. Keiichi Yokoyama of Automaton was impressed with it, and said that its production values were noticeably improved compared to previous entries in the When They Cry series, but also described it as \\"for better or worse, a Ryukishi07 work\\".

She along with six other artists used Wave Hill's Glyndor Gallery's winter workshop program. Academics She received her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the School of Art Institute of Chicago then continued on to received her Master of Fine Arts from Stony Brook University in 2007 in New York. She followed that with an apprenticeship at the Beacon Fine Art Foundry in Beacon New York. She also took printmaking classes at the Art Students League of New York. She has a background in oil painting. Creative process Her background in oil painting gave way into using other methods of her art. She has said that, \\"Over the years, I started removing my hand more and removing brushes and all of the proper tools we’re trained with as painters. It’s been years of finding other ways to look at the process, and other ways to look at and interact with materials.\\"Article in \\"The Riverdale Press\\" She is often using sumi ink (made from the soot of pine branches in Japan) mixed with earthy material and gathered objects such as bricks and tire shreds to paint.

In her time at Wave Hill, she also made use of a \\"root ball,\\" a mass of roots at the base of a plant that has soil surrounding it.

She has said that, \\"Working aerially with my images on the floor, I am interested in being inside the image rather than the outside as an easel painter.\\" Message LaTocha tries to bring attention to the idea that landscapes are an active thing as opposed to objects. She embodies the belief that humans are part of the landscape rather than separate from it by literally standing within the scenes she paints. She has said that, \\"For a number of years now I’ve been working with land motifs, land imagery. All of my work is about being immersed in these spaces, these environments. Sometimes I’m reluctant to use the word ‘landscape’ because there's a certain kind of genre, a certain kind of concept or ideology when you think about the idea of landscape. It connotes a kind of reverence or allusion to something. It's usually something that you're looking at or looking upon. It's this view or window into another world, a natural world or an industrial one.\\" While bringing attention to this she tries to have the observer and artist be a part of the piece itself as she herself has stated, \\"In the aboriginal sense one is actively moving through the landscape.

It is part of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra, and is one of four cemeteries in the complex. The third cemetery to be established in the monastery complex, the Nikolskoe Cemetery opened in 1863, and rapidly became a popular and exclusive burial site for the elite of Saint Petersburg society. It was carefully arranged and landscaped, with its cemetery church opening in 1871. Taking its name from this church, the Church of St. Nicholas, the cemetery functioned also a burial ground for the clergy and monks of the monastery. The wealthy and important of the city commissioned large and elaborate memorials during the later years of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth. The cemetery fell into disrepair during the Soviet period. Unlike other cemeteries in the Lavra, it was not considered to have any particular historical or artistic value. The church was closed and repurposed, burials ceased, and some memorials of more significant figures were moved to other cemeteries, while others were lost or deliberately destroyed. Restoration work began in the 1970s, returning the site to its park-like form. A columbarium was built, the cemetery church reopened, and work to repair and refurbish the monuments began. Burials recommenced in the late 1970s, and now the cemetery includes prominent figures of Soviet and post-Soviet society, as well as those of the era of Imperial Russia. Establishment and early history Plan of the cemetery in 1914, showing the regular layout of plots The cemetery was opened in 1863, to the east of the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, the main church of the monastery. It was the third cemetery in the complex, after the original Lazarevskoe Cemetery in the 1710s, and the Tikhvin Cemetery in 1823. It was constructed on a space originally planned for a garden at the main entrance to the monastery, but that instead had become used for roads and palisades. It was first called the Zasobornoye Cemetery (), but became known as the Nikolskoe after the construction of the Church of St. Nicholas between 1868 and 1871 to the design of diocesan architect Grigory Karpov. The church was funded by the wealthy merchant N. I. Rusanov, who established his family tomb on the ground floor. The Spiritual Council noted that \\"the Lavra cemetery is not open to everyone, as are the city cemeteries, but only a few persons from the government service and persons with honorary titles are buried here.\\" Part of the cemetery also served as the burial site for the Monastery's monks and the metropolitans of Saint Petersburg, leading to the name Bratskoe (), or \\"Brotherhood\\" section. The pond and details of the cemetery landscaping It became a prestigious burial location, and careful attention was taken in the planning and layout, which was more regular than the early cemeteries, and included a pond in the northern part. A path leads from the main entrance of the cemetery church across a bridge and aligned with the apse of the Trinity Cathedral, forming a longitudinal axis. Paths then diverge in a grid pattern to the sides, running between the and the southern boundary of the monastery. New burial plots were placed in the south and in the eastern parts of the cemetery, maintaining the grid pattern. Wealthy patrons commissioned large chapels and crypts, with elaborate decorations and reliefs from prominent artists such as , , and . Plans in 1896 to build a larger cemetery church in the Byzantine style by architect L. P. Andreyev came to nothing, as did a similar project in 1908, despite a donation of 10 thousand rubles by the ruling metropolitan. Soviet period and later use Late-nineteenth century memorials, the grave of Nikolay Koksharov, who died in 1893 The Nikolskoe Cemetery, unlike the Lazarevskoe and Tikhvin cemeteries, was not designated as a museum during the Soviet period, as it was not considered to have any particular artistic or historical value. It was closed in 1927 and sporadic efforts were made during the 1930s and 1940s to eliminate the cemetery, and the graves of several prominent figures were transferred to the Lazarevskoe, Tikhvin and Volkovo cemeteries; including Vera Komissarzhevskaya, Ivan Goncharov, Anton Rubinstein and Boris Kustodiev. Other graves were lost or destroyed. The Church of St Nicholas was closed on 10 December 1932, and it was planned to turn it into a crematorium. A furnace for burning bodies was tested in 1934, but ultimately the plan was abandoned and instead the church became a warehouse and workshop. A 1940 survey by the identified some two hundred gravestones worthy of preservation. Severely neglected by the 1970s, plans were drawn up to restore the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. The Nikolskoe Cemetery was restored and landscaped, with a columbarium built between 1979 and 1980. The cemetery church was repaired and re- consecrated on 22 April 1985. The size of the cemetery was somewhat reduced with the construction of an overpass for the Alexander Nevsky Bridge through the western part of the cemetery. Burials resumed in the late 1970s, and since 1989 a comprehensive restoration of monuments has been underway. Burials The cemetery contains a wide selection of Saint Petersburg society from the late nineteen and early twentieth centuries. Buried here are the singers Antonina Abarinova, Natalia Iretskaya, and Anastasia Vyaltseva; playwright Dmitry Averkiyev; literary figures Fyodor Batyushkov, Evgeny Feoktistov, Aleksandra Ishimova, Alexandra Jacobi, Evgeny Karnovich, Fyodor Koni, Nestor Kotlyarevsky, Mirra Lokhvitskaya, Boleslav Markevich, Mikhail Rosenheim, Sergey Shubinsky, Aleksey Suvorin, and Lydia Zinovieva-Annibal; artists Nikolay Karazin, Konstantin Makovsky, and Mikhail Mikeshin; composers Nicolai Soloviev and Feofil Tolstoy; architects Nikolai Chagin and Vasily Kenel; dancer Askold Makarov; actor Nikolai Sazonov; and director of the Imperial Theatres Ivan Vsevolozhsky.

She is cited by many writers in reference to the appropriation of Aboriginal earnings by the Aborigines Department and the politics of interracial relationships in a racially divided nation.  Early life  Jessie (Gypsy) Argyle was born in 1900 in the East Kimberley region of Western Australia to an Aboriginal woman and a white cattleman. After the Western Australian Aboriginal Act (1905) was passed, her and her half brother were deemed orphans and forced to travel 150 miles by foot from Argyle Police Station to Wyndham in 1906. From there, a cattle steamer, Bullara, took them to Fremante, then by train to Swan Native and Half Caste Mission in Guildford, an Anglican reformatory and industrial school. As part of the assimilation process, she was forced to give up her name, Gypsy, and became Jessie Argyle.  Entering the workforce  Jessie interned for 13 years at the reformatory and was trained as a domestic servant. She was contracted to work at Bridgetown for her first job, and was a servant there for a decade. She received low wages for long hours, with over half of her earnings being paid to the Aborigine Department, and the measly 5 shillings a week she was allowed to keep was often withheld from her, which the Department claimed was for the protection of her welfare.Silburn SR, Zubrick SR, De Maio JA, Shepherd C, Griffin JA, Mitrou FG, Dalby RB, Hayward C, Pearson G. The Western Australian Aboriginal Child Health Survey: Strengthening the Capacity of Aboriginal Children, Families and Communities. Perth: Curtin University of Technology and Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, 2006. She was faced with poor living conditions, strict curfews, and abuse from the Aborigines Department. Suffering from recurring bone disease, Jessie was removed in 1924 to Moore River Native Settlement for a year to be “cured”. However, she attributed her removal to her relationship with Englishman Edward Alfred Byron Smith. Jessie worked in the sewing room and nurses quarters at the institution, which were infamous for their harsh conditions. She snuck a letter to her previous boss, who allowed her to return. In 1925, she resumed her relationship with Smith under close supervision from employers and the Aborigine Department. Argyle's story is often cited in reference to the appropriation of Aboriginal wealth and autonomy by the Australian government.  Relationship  Jessie Argyle is most well known for her interracial relationship with Edward Smith, an Englishman who worked for the West Australian paper. On 3 February 1930 Argyle married Smith at St Bartholomew's Anglican Church in East Perth after the Aborigines Department removed its restrictions on their relationship. They rented a house on Glendover Street, North Perth, which became a significant place for the Aboriginal community. Their relationship became a symbol of the struggles of interracial love in Australia, and the strict societal divide that is still in place today. Ann McGrath writes in her article Celebrating white men and their black lovers for The Herald, “They fell in love in a society deeply divided on racial lines but why did such couples have to flee like exiles? Possibly it was because their unions threatened to expose a hidden fault-line of Australian colonialism - one whose legacies are with us today.”  Activism  Argyle's house on Glendover Street was important to the Aboriginal community. She provided refuge for domestic servants between jobs, women visiting their children in institutions, Aboriginal World War II soldiers, and for anyone seeking companionship. Argyle welcomed Aboriginal folk into her home and entertained them with marathon card games. The department was suspicious of the gatherings in Argyle's home, suspicious of her for crime or prostitution. The Commissioner of the Police threatened to charged Smith over an Aboriginal youth lodging, which is prohibited under Section 21b of the 1905 Act. Argyle is remembered as a strong and lively woman, and was known as the ‘Duchess of Glendover Street’ or “Mum Smith”.  Legacy  In 2003, Argyle's great grandson Stephen Kinnane published Shadow Lines, a memoir of the relationship between Argyle and Smith and Kinnane's connection to this history. The story discusses the politics of the love between the interracial couple and Kinanne's personal connection to his family history, as well as the history of Aboriginal oppression. The book blends history dug up from his great grandmother's files as well as his own imagination about his great- grandparents’ lives. Kinnane documents the destruction of many of Argyle's files, especially from 1938 into the 1950s, after the appointment of Stanley G. Middleton as Commissioner for Native Affairs, whose policy centered around assimilation and bringing the “Australian way of life” to Aboriginal families. In his article “Submission to the Legal and Constitutional References [Senate] Committee: Inquiry into Indigenous workers whose paid labour was controlled by Government”, he cites Argyle's story and the appropriation of her money by the department as well of the destruction of her files. Kinnane also co- wrote Ghost Files; the missing files of the Department of Indigenous Affairs Archives with Lauren Marsh, a book that explores the destruction of personal files by the Department of Indigenous Affairs, Department of Native Welfare (1955–72), Department of Native Affairs (1936–55), and Aborigines Department (1926–36).  Death  Argyle was admitted to Perth Hospital in 1954 after suffering from diabetic ulcers. After having her left leg amputated, family and friends came to visit her to show their support and play cards. She died on 1 September 1955 of coronary insufficiency associated with septicaemia and was buried in Karrakatta cemetery.

His primary aesthetic has evolved around a language of painterly fragmented geometric abstraction that is usually formed on shaped canvases and installations. Row lives and works in both New York City and Cushings Island, Maine. Early life and education Row was born in Portland but grew up in Kolkata, India. Row went on to study art receiving both his BA and MFA degrees at Yale. During his time there he studied under Joseph Albers, Al Held, Lester Johnson, William Bailey, David von Schlegell, and Brice Marden. Row has exhibited extensively since the late seventies starting out at alternative and nonprofit spaces such as the Drawing Center and PS122. He has been represented at various points in his career by John Good Gallery (New York), André Emmerich (New York), von Lintel Gallery (New York), Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac (Paris/Salzburg), Ascan Crone (Hamburg), Galerie Brandstetter & Wyss (Zurich) and currently with Loretta Howard Gallery (New York), Locks Gallery (Philadelphia) and McClain Gallery (Houston). Row is also an established printmaker working with fine art edition presses such as Pace Prints, Two Palms Press and the Tamarind Institute. He has also received grants and awards such as Yale Scholar of the House (1971-71), National Endowment for the Arts (1987), Issac N. Maynard Prize from the National Academy Museum and School (2008). Row has taught and lectured at The Cooper Union, Rhode Island School of Design, Pratt Institute, Fordham University and currently teaches in the School of Visual Arts MFA Program. Work Row's practice has evolved into a series of inquires into the nature of perception using geometry and the physicality of paint. His paintings use cropped and fragmented overlapping ovals and polygons that create visual and illusionistic tension. Charles Hagen goes on to describes the work in an Artforum review, \\"Row's paintings have a sense of dynamism about them as if they were constantly on the verge of becoming something else - and then, perhaps becoming themselves again, By combining off geometric forms with richly expressive color, Row attempts to bridge the gap between systems and intuition, concept and action.\\" Peter Plagens writes about Row's work saying, \\"Row is a master of his mode, and his astute cramming of geometric shapes (ovals are a favorite) into dynamically constricting formats makes his compositions seem all the more muscular. Recently, he's been working on polygons, and his color, while measured and considerably muted by his relentless attention to the surface, is nevertheless expert and crisp.\\" Ken Johnson referred to the Row's imagery as, \\"abstract paintings in which wide, arcing bands are played off rectangular division. Broad loopy lines and straight lines are squeegeed into richly layered fields, some in bright, synthetic hues, others in black and white.\\" The paint application has the texture not unlike screen printed ink or stenciled wiped surface which causes the image to appear blurred or obscured. Often marks remain from the use of such tools and other masking techniques as evidence of the process as well as aesthetic gesture. In reference to this painting critic Barry Schwabsky says, \\"The layering if the surface is in fact rather complex, and because Row uses the removal of the masking tape holding down the stencils as a marked steps in the painting process, the image is traversed, both at and under the surface but the grid formed 'ghosts' of the tape.\\" Times art critic Roberta Smith describes Row's work as, \\"layer together complex processes (including templates, screen printing and Richter-like blurs) with an imagery that centers on repeating open ellipses. Across separate panels and multicolored grids, and in lively contrasting colors, these ellipses disintegrate into coiled lines and then big flamelike strokes, with a centrifugal energy that can seem cinematic.\\" Selected solo exhibitions *2018 Loretta Howard Gallery, New York, NY *2017 Locks Gallery, Philadelphia, PA *2016 Loretta Howard Gallery, New York, NY *2014 Loretta Howard Gallery, New York, NY *2013 McClain Gallery, Houston, TX *2006 Von Lintel Gallery, New York, NY *2004 Von Lintel Gallery, New York, NY *2001 Ulrich Museum, Wichita, KS *1996 André Emmerich, New York, NY *1995 Locks Gallery, Philadelphia, PA *1995 Galerie Thomas von Lintel, Munich, Germany *1991 Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Paris, France *1991 John Good Gallery, New York, NY *1991 Richard Feigen Gallery, Chicago, IL *1990 Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Salzburg, Austria *1989 John Good Gallery, New York, NY *1987 John Good Gallery, New York, NY Selected group exhibitions *2012 Conceptual Abstraction, Hunter College / Times Square Gallery, New York, NY *2011 Splendor of Dynamic Structure: Celebrating 75 Years of the American Abstract Artists, Johnson Museum of Art, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY *1996 A Critique of Pure Abstraction, Hammer Museum, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA *1991 Conceptual Abstraction.

The focal point of the Caballera vs. Caballera series of shows is one or more traditional Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"Bet matches\\", where all competitors in the match risk their hair on the outcome of the match. The Lucha de Apuestas is considered the most prestigious match type in lucha libre, especially when a wrestlers mask is on the line, but the \\"hair vs. hair\\" stipulation is held in almost as high regard. For the April 2016 Caballera vs. Caballera event El Hijo del Diablo and Cerebro Negro both \\"bet\\" their hair on the match as part of a long-running storyline feud between the Los Terribles Cerebros (\\"The Terrible Brains\\"; which also includes Black Terry and Cerebro Negro) and El Hijo del Diablo's faction Los Mariachis Locos (\\"The Crazy Mariachis\\"; Imposible and Diablo Jr.). El Hijo del Diablo won the match when Black Terry was disqualified due to outside interference, and thus had all his hair shaved off. In the semi-main event Máscara Año 2000 Jr. defeated Trauma I as IWRG was building to a future match for the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship. The show featured four additional matches. Production =Background= In Lucha libre the wrestling mask holds a sacred place, with the most anticipated and prestigious matches being those where a wrestler's mask is on the line, a so-called Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\" where the loser would be forced to unmask in the middle of the ring and state their birth name. Winning a mask is considered a bigger accomplishment in lucha libre than winning a professional wrestling championship and usually draws more people and press coverage. Losing a mask is often a watershed moment in a wrestler's career, they give up the mystique and prestige of being an enmascarado (masked wrestler) but usually come with a higher than usual payment from the promoter. =Storylines= The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (técnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Event The show started with a best two-out-of- three falls tag team match with the tecnico team of Black Dragón and Dragón Fly defeating Matrix Jr. and Ram El Carnero, two falls to one. The second match of the night saw the trio known as Las Tortugas Ninja (\\"The Ninja Turtle\\"; Leo, Mike and Rafy) face off against the rudo trio Los Comandos Elite (Factor, Rayan and Spector). Los Tortugas won the match in two straight falls, followed by Los Oficiales attacking Los Tortugas to try to steal their masks. Once the two sides were separated by officials Los Tortugas challenged Los Oficiales to a Lucha de Apuestas match for their masks, Apolo Estrada Jr. was originally scheduled to be part of the third match, but for unexplained reasons was replaced by El Golpeador when it was match time. Golpeador, Eterno and Canis Lupus lost to the team of Picudo Jr. and Los Terribles Cerebros (\\"The Terrible Brains\\"; Black Terry and Dr. Cerebro). In the fourth match Golden Magic teamed up with La Dinastia de la Muerte (\\"The Dynasty of Death\\"; Negro Navarro and Trauma II, facing off against the rudo team of Danny Casas, El Diablo Jr. and Veneno. During the first fall Casas got his team disqualified by committing a foul that the referee saw. In the second fall Golden Magic pinned Casas while putting his feet on the rope for extra leverage to get the two to zero victory. For the fifth a match of the night Máscara Año 2000 Jr. defeated Trauma I, as part of their long-running storyline feud between the two, Mr. Electro and Canis Lupus. For the last match El Hijo del Diablo was accompanied to the ring by his son, Diablo Jr., while Cerebro Negro was accompanied by Dr. Cerebro for the match. The two split the first two falls between them, leading to a long last fall. At one put the referee was knocked down, which allowed Dr. Cerebro to foul El Hijo del Diablo, leading to Cerebro Negro covering him. Since the original referee was knocked out, a second referee came to the ring, but El Hijo del Diablo kicked out. After a few more minutes of action, Cerebro Negro pinned El Hijo del Diablo, to seemingly win the match. Moments later the original referee recovered and called for Cerebro Negro to be disqualified. After the match Cerebro Negro sat in the middle of the ring and had all his hair shaved off.

As the minister of Labour and of Social security, he founded the French Social security system (or social safety net) and the retirement system, between 1945 and 1947. He was also the general secretary of the Fédération des travailleurs de la métallurgie CGT.  Biography  = Early life = His father, Antoine Croizat, was a blue-collar worker,Adolphe Antoine Croizat (1867–1937), ferblantier, fut militant socialiste puis communiste de Lyon. En 1906, il lança la première grève en Savoie. Il gérait aussi Le Travail, journal régional du parti communiste. Voir sur humanite.fr.Jean Marie Mayeur, Arlette Schweitz, Les Parlementaires de la Seine sous la Troisième République, vol. 1. and his mother, Louise Jeannette Piccino, was a weaver. Ambroise started working in a plant at the age of 13, when his father was drafted in 1914. As a metalworker trainee, he also followed evening classes, and became a toolmaker near Lyon. = Early politics = In 1917, Croizat joined the Young Socialist Movement, and then the Parti socialiste (French socialist party) in 1918. He began supporting the Section française de l'Internationale ouvrière (SFIO) in the Communist International. He participated in the great social movements of the metalworkers of the Lyon area. In 1920, he joined the Parti communiste, and became one of the leaders of Jeunesses communistes, a political youth organisation, from 1920 to 1928. In 1928,On trouve aussi 1927, cf. Ambroise Croizat le bâtisseur de la Sécurité sociale, Michel Etiévent, humanite.fr, 1er décembre 2009 he was named secretary of the Fédération unitaire des métaux (French united federation of metalworkers). From 1929 – to his death in 1951 – he was a member of the central comity and of the bureau of the federated young communist movement.Michel Étiévent, « Ambroise Croizat, \\"militant ambulant\\" », L'Humanité, le 31 janvier 2001. In 1936, he became general secretary of the Metalworkers' Federation, which then represented 20% of the total CGT members.Michel Dreyfus, Histoire de la CGT, éditions Compexe, 1995, p. 165 et suivantes. During the 1936 French legislative election, he was elected in the second division of the 14th district of Seine.Voir sur assemblee-nationale.fr. He negotiated the parisian metalworking convention, and, as a rapporteur, he presented the collective agreement to the Chamber. He was subsequently accused of \\"having participated in the creation and organisation of the Groupe ouvrier et paysan\\",Constitué légalement en remplacement du groupe parlementaire communiste dissous, sa création figure au Journal officiel (CHAMBRE DES DÉPUTÉS / Modifications aux listes électorales des membres des groupes, JO du 29 septembre 1939). and on the night of 7 October 1939, he was arrested. On 20 February 1940, he was ejected from the Legislature, and on 3 April 1940, he was sentenced to 5 years in prison, loss of his civil and politic rights, and a fine of 4000 francs.Condamnation des ex-députés communistes, Le Matin du 4 avril 1940 p.1-2, gallica.bnf.frFlorimond Bonte, Le Chemin de l'Honneur, 1949, p.346-345. After having been moved between 14 prisons, he was eventually detained during March 1941 in the bagne of Maison Carrée, near Alger. Freed on 5 February 1943, three months after Operation Torch, he was summoned by the CGT to be a member of the consultative commission of the interim government of Alger. After theLibération of France, he again served as an elected official, first in the two constitutive assemblies (voted on 21 October 1945 and 2 June 1946) and then in the National Assembly from 1946 to 1951. Croizat served as Minister of Labour under the général de Gaulle from 21 November 1945 to 26 January 1946, and Minister of Labour and Social security from 26 January to 16 December 1946 (governments of Felix Gouin and Georges Bidault) and from 22 January to 4 May 1947 (government of Paul Ramadier, to the end of the communist participation in the government). He participated in the foundation of the Social security system: health insurance, pensions system, child benefit, and broad reform of French labour laws, through the creation of employee representative committees, occupational medicine, regulation of overtime, and a change of statute for miners. = Personal life = Croizat's first wife was Germaine Marie Girod (1902–1977). They divorced and, in 1939, he married Denise Mettetal (1912–1972), with whom he had two children (a daughter in March 1939, and a son in February 1940). = Death = In 1951, Croizat died of lung cancer. The Communist Party organized his funeral, with visitation at the Metalworkers House (now called Maison des métallos) at the CGT siege; historian Michel Étiévent later estimated that a million people attended.) He was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery.  Contributions  Nicknamed the \\"ministre des travailleurs\\" (Minister of the workers), Ambroise Croizat is permanently associated with the major laws concerning Social security in France, notably the creation and administrative organisation of pension funds, and the special officials' treatment.

Created after the Liberal Revolution of 1820 to prepare a constitution for Portugal and its overseas territories, it used a different system from the traditional General Cortes for choosing representatives, and the three traditional feudal estates (Clergy, Nobility, and Commoners) no longer sat separately. The Cortes sat between January 24, 1821 and November 4, 1822 at the Palácio das Necessidades in Lisbon. The work of the Constitutional Cortes culminated in the approval of the Portuguese Constitution of 1822. Elections The government installed after the Oporto Revolution, known as the Provisional Junta of the Supreme Government of the Kingdom, decided to convene the Cortes and on September 1, 1820 set up a preparatory commission. On November 22, the Commission published instructions for the election of representatives to the Cortes, which were held in December 1820. The original instructions only provided for representatives from Portugal, ignoring Brazil and provoking great discontent. The instructions were then revised and re-issued in November, establishing the proportional representation that included in the overseas domains and abandoning the traditional division into three orders. The electoral method chosen by the Commission was closely modelled on the electoral system Spain under the Spanish Constitution of 1812. It involved a complex process of indirect suffrage through the formation of parish, county, and provincial electoral committees. Male citizens over the age of 25 (in some cases over 21 years of age) with a job, a trade or useful occupation, elected an electoral college who, in turn, chose county voters. These then met in the provincial capitals and elected the representatives to the Cortes, with one representative for every 30,000 inhabitants. Representatives were required to be at least 25 years of age. Despite the complexity of the process and inexperience of those operating it, the election was completed on Christmas Day 1820, with deputies elected in most provinces of Portugal. The remainder were elected in the following months. These electoral criteria had the effect, in Brazil, of transforming the traditional captaincies into provinces. The first Brazilian province to declare its adherence to the Cortes was Pará on 1 January 1821, followed on February 10 by Bahia, Piauí, Maranhão and Pernambuco. Other parts of Brazil followed in due course. Representatives from Sao Paulo, Paraíba, Pará, Espírito Santo, Goiás and Ceará only joined the Cortes in 1822. Representatives from Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Norte, CIsplatina and Rio Grande do Sul did not take their seats in the Cortes, remaining in Brazil in demonstration of support to the regent Don Pedro. in total 97 representatives and alternates were elected from Brazil.SILVA NETO, Casimiro Pedro da. \\"A construção da democracia : síntese histórica dos grandes momentos da Câmara dos Deputados, das assembléias nacionais constituintes e do Congresso Nacional\\" . Brasília : Câmara dos Deputados, Coordenação de Publicações, 2003, p.47. Accessed 20 April 2019. Drafting a constitution On 9 March, less than three months after its opening meeting, the Cortes approved the \\"Bases of the Constitution\\", a document later sworn to by King John VI of Portugal on July 4 immediately after his return from exile in Brazil. Based on this document the Cortes then drafted and approved the first Portuguese Constitution, which was approved on September 30, 1822. The Cortes met for the last time on November 4, 1822. Although the constitution of 1822 only remained in effect for a short time, it served as an inspiration for Portuguese liberalism, and even influenced the first republican constitution of Portugal, approved almost a century later. On November 4, 1822, the work of the General and Extraordinary Cortes of the Portuguese Nation ended, and it became an ordinary assembly on November 15, 1822. Divergence between Portugal and Brazil In August 1821 the Cortes discussing a series of administrative measures to reorganize institutional power. Among other reforms the Cortes suppressed Brazil’s existing provincial governments and courts, and demanded the immediate return of the Prince Regent Don Pedro to Lisbon. These discussions began before the Brazilian representatives arrived on August 29 and marked the beginning of a policy of confrontation between Lisbon and the regency of Don Pedro. In addition trade relations between Brazil and Portugal became a point of divergence between deputies of the two kingdoms. To reconcile the different positions, in March 1822, a special commission of six Brazilian and six Portuguese representatives was established. The Brazilian representatives wanted a dual monarchy with Portugal and Brazil as federated elements in a single empire, while the Portuguese representatives wanted a unitary state. The polarization between two increased tension in the provinces, especially from January 1822 when Don Pedro decided to stay in Brazil. On 4 May a decree of Don Pedro established that no decision of the Cortes could be applied in Brazil without his assent. On September 23 and 24, the Political Constitution of the Portuguese Monarchy was signed by 39 of the 46 Brazilian deputies in office.

After cutting a deal with the High Evolutionary who only met with him after some of his New Men were hunted, Kraven the Hunter has 87 clones of him created. Ana was disgusted by this and leaves her father. The clones were trained as the Sons of Kraven and then sent out to prove themselves by being hunted by each other. This motif caused Ana to leave him. The one that survived was labeled as the Last Son of Kraven. With help from Taskmaster, Black Ant, and Arcade and his company Arcade Industries, Kraven the Hunter starts hunting various animal- themed characters like Beetle, Kangaroo, Owl, Puma, the Serpent Society (Black Mamba, Black Racer, Bushmaster, Cottonmouth, Fer-de-Lance, Puff Adder, Rock Python), Squid, and White Rabbit. In the case of King Cobra, Rhino, Scorpion, Stegron, Tarantula, and Vulture, they were grouped together as the Savage Six. While making the final preparations for the \\"Great Hunt,\\" Kraven the Hunter recaps on his own immortality when it was revealed that the Kraven the Hunter that was stabbed by Scarlet Spider was actually a clone. Curt Connors (in his Lizard form due to the Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy) wakes up to find his wife screaming that his son Billy Connors isn't home. Peter Parker is sick due to his encounters with Taskmaster and Black Ant when they tried to capture the Rhino. Mary Jane offers to give Peter some food to make him feel better, but Peter receives six calls from Curt Connors about Billy. Meanwhile, Billy is trying to get into a club to see a girl named Becca. But when security catches him and exposes his Lizard-like appearance, security chase after Billy. Taskmaster and Black Ant quickly capture Billy and escape from Spider- Man. Spider-Man receives a spider tracer from Black Cat stating that she has been captured with Billy, but not before sending Spider-Man her location. =Main plot= Spider-Man is swinging throughout New York, still weakened because of the flu. He arrives at the place where Black Cat is supposedly held and falls into a trap where there are green gases that make Spider-Man disoriented. Black Cat is in a hotel room with Billy Connors, where she was captured by Taskmaster and Black Ant due to them double-crossing her. Kraven arrives to see Black Cat, and it is revealed that Black Cat and Billy are bait for Spider-Man. Meanwhile, Spider-Man gets dizzier when he sees the Last Son of Kraven. Spider-Man manages to get the upper hand, but hallucinates Mary Jane dying, which causes the Last Son of Kraven to beat him senselessly. Spider-Man wakes up in Central Park in his black suit where he is attacked by Scorpion with the rest of the Savage Six, Armadillo, Black Mamba, Black Tarantula, Constrictor II, Frog-Man, Gazelle of the Salem's Seven, Gibbon, Hippo, Iguana, Kangaroo, Killer Shrike, Man-Bull, Owl, Panda-Mania, Puma, Slug, Squid, Toad, Walrus, and White Rabbit watch the fight. The fight is interrupted when they are attacked by robots piloted by hunters. Spider-Man is helping the Savage Six, Armadillo, Beetle, Bison, Constrictor II, Dragonfly, Flying Tiger, Frog-Man, Gazelle, Gibbon, Iguana, Killer Shrike, Mad Dog, Man- Bull, Owl, Puma, the Serpent Society, Squid, Toad, Walrus, and White Rabbit escape from the Hunter-Bots, but there is almost no escape as there is a forcefield around Central Park, even Captain Marvel, Iron Man, War Machine, and Vision couldn't break through it. This forcefield is the remnant of the Planetary Defense Shield that was misused by Hydra back in the \\"Secret Empire\\" storyline. Arcade shows the hunters how to operate the Hunter-Bots where a hunter named Bob controls one to kill Iguana. Bison, Gazelle, and Mad Dog are killed by the Hunter-Bots. Mary Jane is dancing in her apartment but stops when she gets worried for Peter. Spider-Man tries to help Gibbon, but Vulture tells Gibbon to get away from Spider-Man as after this is over Spider-Man will just lock Gibbon up again. Black Ant and Taskmaster are talking about the Hunt. Taskmaster betrays Black Ant saying that Black Ant is an animal-themed villain and tasers Black Ant to get more money. While running away, Vulture pushes Gibbon toward the hunters in order to buy some time for himself, which causes Gibbon to be killed. While fighting the hunters, Peter Parker grows worried for Mary Jane, because he fears that his hallucination may become true. Mary Jane wakes up from her sleep to find a centipede in her hair and puts it outside and goes back to sleep, but a demonic bandaged-covered figure with centipedes on him watches over. Spider-Man comes across Gibbon's corpse and grieves over him. As Spider-Man stays by his side, Gibbon reflects on his life where he even came to the conclusion that Princess Python never loved him. Spider-Man is caught by surprise by a couple of Hunter-Bots and Spider- Man listens to their conversation about Arcade, realizing that the hunters are just robots. Spider-Man webs the Hunter-Bots up and while swinging he sees arrow signs all over Central Park, and heads toward a location where the Savage Six are located. The arrows are revealed to be v shapes and it was for the Vulture. Vulture creates a lie to the rest of the Savage Six, Armadillo, Constrictor II, Human Fly, Owl, Puma, Razorback II, Scorpia, Snake Marston, and White Rabbit that Gibbon sacrificed himself to give Vulture time to break the forcefield and give him a robot head. Spider-Man lands in front of the villain to say that Vulture lied, but Rhino appears. Rhino is still angry that Spider-Man allowed Taskmaster and Black Ant to capture him (due to Aunt May being in the way) and is about to kill him when Vulture tells Rhino to calm down as Spider-Man is not the enemy but the Robot Hunters are. Spider-Man mentions that Mandrill was taken down by the Hunter-Bots while Toad mentions that the same thing happened to Man-Bull. Black Cat uses her bad luck powers to set a leopard free from its cage and attack one of the guards. Black Cat gets the key and tells Billy to escape. However, Billy wants to stay in the cage so his dad will find him. Taskmaster meets Arcade and wants Arcade to pay him twice the money because Taskmaster caught Lizard. Spider-Man encounters one of the Hunter-Bots who revealed Arcade's location and destroys it. Black Ant then shows up to tells Spider-Man something. It is revealed that in order to save his son and his wife from disintegrating (due to the events of \\"Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy\\" where Jackal activated the kill code), Curt injected them with the Lizard formula, turning into Lizard. Curt also put an inhibitor chip in his spine which prevents him from being violent as well as turn him to human form. Lizard finds Taskmaster at the Pop-Up with No Name. The Pop-Up with No Name is a beer tent at the Queens Night Market that patrons like 8-Ball, Answer, Boomerang, Electro II, Hypno-Hustler, Looter, Mirage, Paper Doll, Screwball, Spot, and Tombstone have been attending ever since the Bar with No Name was blown up. Lizard proceeds to poison him by slipping a poison into her beer. Lizard offers Taskmaster the antidote if he can take Lizard to Central Park. While traveling there, Lizard and Taskmaster defeat Vermin, freeing innocent bystanders. Taskmaster helps put a taser chip in Lizard's body, and takes him to Arcade. Black Ant tells Spider-Man that the only way to escape the Central Park is to leave all the villains and by turning small. Taskmaster frees Lizard from his binds and Lizard tells Taskmaster that the poison will wear off in 24 hours. Black Cat is sneaking around with Billy still crying when Black Cat is attacked by Hunter-Bot. Last Son of Kraven is impatient with the Great Hunt and wants to hunt the animal- themed individuals. He also deduces that Kraven hasn't entered the Great Hunt because he's afraid of Spider-Man and walks away. The Hunter-Bot sees Billy and shoots, but Black Cat jumps in the way. The Hunter-Bots plans to finish off Billy. Upon seeing him as a kid, the Hunter-Bot decides to quit hunting. Billy helps Black Cat on her feet and they slowly walk away with Black Cat bleeding out. Lizard finds the cage that Billy was in, but Last of Kraven finds Lizard and beats him up. Last Son of Kraven realizes that Lizard can't fight and declares that he will kill Billy in front of Lizard while dragging him away. The Hunter-Bot tries to disconnect, but he can't. It is revealed that the moment the individual connects to the Hunter-Bot and if is destroyed, then the individual is killed which is what happens when Vulture destroys Bob's Hunter-Bot. The Hunter-Bots are then attacked by the Savage Six, Armadillo, Black Mamba, Dragonfly, Frog-Man, Hippo, Lady Octopus, Puma, Razorback, and Toad when they try to target White Rabbit. Kraven plans this from the beginning to punish the hunters for killing animals for sport. Black Ant tells Spider-Man that Kraven is located in a castle, but Arcade tells Spider-Man that Kraven is busy and releases the Vermin clones. In a flashback, Kraven has Arcade tell Vulture that there is a chance to break the forcefield by killing more Hunter-Bots. In the present, Vermin is being kept captured by Arcade who found him due to Taskmaster and Lizard showing Arcade his location. Vermin bites Arcade's finger in defiance. In fear of being killed by Arcade, Vermin reveals that Lizard and Taskmaster are working against Arcade. Arcade puts a serum into Vermin's skin causing him to spawn clones of him in the cage. As the Savage Six, Killer Shrike, Lady Octopus, Ox, and White Rabbit continue to take down the Hunter-Bots, Spider-Man is overwhelmed by the Vermin clones. Just when he is about to be killed, Kraven the Hunter repels the Vermin clones and saves Spider-Man. He heals Spider-Man dresses him in a new black Spider-Man costume. Spider-Man is met by Curt Connors who is in human form. Black Cat and Billy take a breather and Billy reveals that his dad will come. However, he doesn't want his dad to find Billy. It is revealed that when Billy was revived, the body was of a clone. However, Billy's true spirit resides in the clone body. Curt knows this because he talked to Doctor Strange about it. Last Son of Kraven appears in front of Black Cat and Billy about to kill both of them. Curt pleads that Spider-Man rip out the inhibitor chip out of his back, stating that he needs to save Billy and promises to be in control. Spider-Man relents enough to pass Kraven's test, and the Lizard re- emerges to break free out of the jail. Kraven finally lets Spider-Man from his bonds, but Spider-Man sees dead guards. Kraven meets Spider-Man and he slashes Spider-Man up with his knives. Kraven tries to get in Spider-Man's head by saying that it is his fault that the guards are dead, as Spider-Man was willing to risk Curt's life in order to be free. Kraven reveals that if Spider-Man kills Kraven, then the forcefield will be down as well as the Hunter-Bots being deactivated and Black Cat and Billy will be saved. Before Spider-Man blacks out, he remembers Mary Jane and starts beating up Kraven. Lizard saves Billy in the nick of time and briefly reconciles with Billy before wandering off allowing Last Son of Kraven to escape. Spider-Man tells Kraven that he will never be like Kraven because Kraven will do anything to survive including killing his own kin like he did with Sasha, Vladimir, and Alyosha. However, Spider-Man counters that everyone needs some other person to support and care for another in order to survive. Kraven laughs and tells Arcade to deactivate the force field and the Hunter-Bots. This enables the Savage Six, Armadillo, Frog-Man, Hippo, Kangaroo, Owl, Panda-Mania, Puma, Scorpia, the Serpent Society, Squid, and White Rabbit to get out of Central Park. Kraven tells Spider-Man to save Black Cat and when Spider-Man hesitates, Kraven promises to never hunt again. Kraven goes to his casket where he retrieves the black Spider-Man suit and dons it once more. Last Son of Kraven sees \\"Spider-Man\\" and mistakenly kills Kraven, breaking his curse. It was said that Kraven must die by the spider and since Kraven wore the Spider-Man suit, this causes Kraven's \\"son\\" to kill him. At the end of the issue on the casket is a photo of Kraven and the Sons of Kraven all happy. =Aftermath= After attending his funeral of his \\"father,\\" Last Son of Kraven went to the Kravinoff estate, rips off his clothes, and trashed it out of frustration. Swinging through Central Park, Spider-Man sees that the Great Hunt is over. Though Armadillo, the Serpent Society, and the unidentified animal-themed villains are shown engaging the police. Luckily, the Avengers (consisting of Iron Man, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, She-Hulk), Falcon, and the Fantastic Four (consisting of Mister Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and Thing) arrive to subdue them. Human Torch is pleased that Spider-Man survived. Captain Marvel shows up to confront Arcade while the controllers of the Hunter-Bots are confronted by Captain America who plans to have a conversation with them about New York's hunting laws. The Great Hunt participants are also arrested. Vulture tells King Cobra, Rhino, Scorpion, Stegron, and Tarantula that the Savage Six name has a good ring to it. Black Ant is found hiding in the bushes by Yellowjacket as he, Human Fly, Razorback, Toad, and White Rabbit plan to take revenge on him. Just then, Taskmaster appears and makes off with Black Ant. As they leave, Taskmaster states that Black Ant would've done the same for him. When Black Ant asks \\"Do you mean the betrayal part or the rescue part?\\" All Taskmaster can say is \\"yeah!\\" Black Cat reunites Billy with Martha Connors' lizard form in their sewer home. Curt Connors is unconscious somewhere as he regains his conscious upon becoming Lizard again. Some of Vermin's surviving clones are seen lurking in the subway. Peter Parker arrives home to find Mary Jane with a bleeding arm. They both embrace each other as a centipede watches them. After calming down and drinking some wine, Last Son of Kraven found a letter written to him by his \\"father\\" behind Kraven the Hunter's rifle on the wall. The letter from Kraven the Hunter stated that Last Son of Kraven was to finally inherit his legacy not as Kraven's son, but as the man himself since he was cloned from his DNA. Last Son of Kraven read on the letter \\"You were forged in fire, born in blood. My spirit made flesh. More than my child -- you are me, and I am you. One and the same now.\\" This led to Last Son of Kraven taking on the aliases of Sergei Kravinoff and Kraven the Hunter where he cuts his hair, wipes off his tiger stripes, and dons a copy of Kraven the Hunter's outfit. Back at the funeral, Chameleon is revealed to be one of the attendees as he is pleased that Kraven the Hunter spared him from the Great Hunt. As he walks away, Chameleon quotes to his dead half-brother to sleep well and states \\"You needn't worry. The world is no longer your burden. Besides, there won't be much of it left soon...Not by the time I've finished.\\" Reception The storyline received generally positive reviews, with an average score of 7.6 out of 10.

He also played one game for Swiss national team. He played mainly in the position of midfielder. Schaub joined Basel's first team in advance of their 1926–27 season. After playing just one test match, he played his domestic league debut for the club in the home game at the Landhof on 14 May 1927 as Basel won 1–0 against local rivals Concordia Basel. He scored his first goal for his club on 12 May 1929 in the away game against Aarau. In fact Schaub scored two goals in that game, as the two teams played a 2–2 draw. A well-documented curiosity was that at the end of Basel's 1929–30 season, the team set off on a Scandinavian football tour, including a visit to Germany. Six games were played in Norway, but the first was played in Leipzig. The team travelled with 15 players, their trainer Kertész and two functionaries. The journey started with a train ride on 2 June 1930 at quarter past seven in the morning from Basel and they arrived in Leipzig at half passed eight that evening. The game against VfB Leipzig was played the next evening. The following one and a half days were spent travelling by train, train, ship, train and train again to Drammen in Norway. Only a few hours after their arrival, the team played a game against a joint team Mjøndalen IF / SBK Drafn. The next day was a train journey to Porsgrunn and two matches in 24 hours. Following that they travelled per bus and then by ship in a 48-hour journey to Bergen for a match against SK Brann. Another ship voyage, this time to Stavanger, two games against Viking FK, then a ship voyage back to Bergen. Finally, the tour ended with three train journeys in three days, Bergen/Oslo/Berlin/Basel, arriving at home on 20 June. The result of this tour was seven games, four wins, one draw, two defeats and approximately 160 hours of travelling. Schaub was member of the tour and played in six of these games. Between the years 1926 and 1937 Schaub played a total of 283 games for Basel, scoring a total of 11 goals. 179 of these games were in the Swiss Serie A/Nationalliga, 26 in the Swiss Cup and 77 were friendly games. He scored 9 goals in the domestic league, the other two were scored during the test games. He was a member of the Basel team that won the Swiss Cup in the 1932–33 season. The final was played in the Hardturm stadium against Grasshopper Club. Basel won 4–3 and achieved the club's first ever national title. He later played one season for Kreuzlingen and then ended his active football career. Schaub was called up for the Switzerland for the first time in 1932. He played two matches for his country, the first on 14 October 1934 in the Charmilles Stadium, Geneva, against Czechoslovakia as the two teams drew 2–2.

The mountain is situated above the western shore of Lake Chelan in Chelan County, on land managed by Wenatchee National Forest. Its nearest higher peak is Flora Mountain, to the south. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Lake Chelan via Castle Creek, Canyon Creek, and Bridal Veil Creek. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The North Cascades feature some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is southwest of Tupshin Peak, began forming in the mid- Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Over many years it has been the focus of local dispute as to whether the site should be developed. Despite the name, it is not in fact registered as common land.  History  On 12 June 1797 an inclosure award created the Bedford Freeman's Common charity, following a 1795 Act of Parliament (35 Geo. III c.87) which covered \\"Parishes of St. Paul, St. Peter and St. Cuthbert, Bedford\\".https://www.legislation.gov.uk/changes/chron- tables/private/21 This charity held land which in 1858 was sold to the Midland Railway to build Bedford railway station. A new Freeman's Common was purchased near Ravensden to replace the original. In 1867 Freemen's Common formed part of the course for the Grand National Hunt Steeplechases, which ran from close to Clapham Wood across to Kimbolton Road. The Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) attended the steeplechases on the second day, arriving in Bedford via the Midlands Railway. It also formed part of the 1868 course, although the race was less successful in its second year at Bedford, and was subsequently moved elsewhere. In 1871 it was suggested to build a smallpox hospital on the Freeman's Common at Cleat Hill. As of 1928 only four Freemen of Bedford remained with rights to graze animals on the Common. On 22 September 1970 the original charity was merged with the Bedford Freeman's Trust Fund, and combined charity was registered as the Bedford Freeman's Common Charity. In 2008 the site was proposed for development in the draft Local Plan, before the trustees had been consulted as to whether the site should be developed. In 2016 the site was added to Bedford Borough Council's draft Local Plan 2035, but in February 2017 was withdrawn following a decision of the Executive Committee, based on a previous view expressed by a government planning inspector when considering the development of Woodlands Park. In 2018 the Freeman's Common charity was merged with the House of Industry Estate – the trustees of both charities were the members of the General Purposes Committee of Bedford Borough Council.

It is used in conjunction with an inert gas, nitrogen, which prevents the panic, sense of suffocation and struggling before unconsciousness, known as the hypercapnic alarm response caused by the presence of high carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood. The Sarco was invented by euthanasia campaigner Philip Nitschke in 2017. History The Sarco is an expansion of the hypoxic death provided by a suicide bag. Many people will not consider euthanasia by suicide bag for aesthetic reasons, or feel claustrophobic inside a bag. Nitschke calls this the \\"plastic bag factor\\". The Sarco provides a solution to these objections. Mechanics Access to the Sarco will be controlled by an online test to gauge mental fitness. If applicants pass, they receive an access code to a Sarco device that works for 24 hours. Users of the Sarco can choose either a dark or transparent view from the capsule. The transparent view would be chosen if they wish to transport the machine to a particular location to see a certain vista from the machine. The inventor feels that \\"where you die is certainly an important factor\\". The capsule of Sarco provides for a rapid decrease in oxygen level while maintaining a low level of carbon dioxide. On activation, of liquid nitrogen causes the oxygen level to drop silently to less than 5% in less than one minute. According to Nitschke, 'The occupant presses the button and the capsule is filled with nitrogen. He or she will feel a bit dizzy but will then rapidly lose consciousness and die'. Design and manufacture The design of the device was a collaboration between Nitschke and Dutch industrial designer, Alexander Bannink. Sarco is 3D-printed in sections measuring . The design software allows for devices of different sizes to be made according to the client's dimensions. Nitschke has said that the design is intended to resemble that of a spaceship, in order to give users the feel that they are traveling to the \\"great beyond\\". Nitschke plans to release the open source plans for the Sarco by 2019. Criticism Critics have described the device as \\"just a glorified gas chamber\\", and others have raised concerns that it is glamourising suicide.

These guns were held in reserve between the wars then mobilized by France during World War II. History Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. Two sources of heavy artillery suitable for conversion to field use were surplus coastal defense guns and naval guns. However, a paradox faced artillery designers of the time; while large caliber naval guns were common, large caliber land weapons were not due to their weight, complexity, and lack of mobility. Large caliber field guns often required extensive site preparation because the guns had to be broken down into multiple loads light enough to be towed by a horse team or the few traction engines of the time and then reassembled before use. Building a new gun could address the problem of disassembling, transporting and reassembling a large gun, but it did not necessarily address how to convert existing heavy weapons to make them more mobile. Rail transport proved to be the most practical solution because the problems of heavy weight, lack of mobility and reduced setup time were addressed. Design The Canon de 305 modèle 1906/10 à glissement started life as six surplus Canon de 305 modèle 1906/10 naval guns which armed Dreadnought battleships of the Danton and Courbet classes. The guns were typical built-up guns of the period which consisted of a rifled liner reinforced by layers of hoops. The 1906 guns used a Manz interrupted screw breech while the 1910 guns used a Welin interrupted screw breech and both fired separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. To load the gun the barrel was lowered to +3° and there was an elevated shell handling trolley at the rear. The carriages consisted of a large rectangular steel base, which was suspended on two six-axle articulated rail bogies manufactured by Schneider. The number of axles was determined by the weight limit for European railways of 17 tonnes per axle. The carriage was similar to that used by the contemporary Canon de 305 modèle 1893/96 à glissement produced by Schneider and was beefed up to accommodate the guns greater weight vs . The barrel alone weighed mle 06/10 vs mle 93/96. Since the carriage did not have a traversing mechanism it was aimed by drawing the guns across a section of curved track. Once in firing position, a section of rail bed was reinforced with wood and iron beams to support the weight of the gun. Six steel beams under the center of the carriage were then lowered to lay across the tracks and the carriage was jacked up to take the weight off the bogies and anchor the gun in place. When the gun fired the entire carriage recoiled a few feet and was stopped by the friction of the beams on the tracks. The carriage was then lowered onto its axles and was either pushed back into place with a shunting locomotive or a windlass mounted on the front of the carriage pulled the carriage back into position. This cheap, simple and effective system came to characterize Schneider's railway guns during the later war years and is known as the Glissement system. World War II Six guns were mobilized at the beginning of the Second World War by the French Army. Three guns were assigned to the fifth Heavy Artillery Battery of the 372° Regiment of the ALVF (Artillerie Lourde sur Voie Ferrée) stationed first at Kuntzig and then Brieulles-sur- Meuse. The guns of the fifth battery were one of the few ALVF batteries that was able to shell the Germans advancing through Luxembourg from the Ardennes. Between 10 May 1940 and 12 June 1940 fifty-four shells were fired at targets along N3 and the railroad station at Alzingen. Three guns were assigned to the eleventh Heavy Artillery Battery of the 373° Regiment of the ALVF stationed first at Wolfgantzen and later evacuated to Roche-lez-Beaupré.

The mountain is part of the Cascade Range. Merchant Peak is the ninth highest point of the Wild Sky Wilderness. Its nearest higher peak is Gunn Peak, to the northwest, and Baring Mountain lies to the south. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Skykomish River. The peak was officially named in 1918 for Andrew Merchant, who made many mining claims around Trout Creek which is north of the peak. Climate Merchant Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. History On May 16, 1965, a Cessna 180 carrying Seattle city councilman Wing Luke, businessman Sidney Gerber, and Kate Ladue crashed on Merchant Peak, killing all three aboard. The wreckage was discovered three years later during a geological survey and confirmed by the Washington State Aeronautics Commission.

With a degree in Law, Dramatic Art, and Journalism, and PhD in Philosophy, she has stood out for her defense of feminism in Spain, especially during the Transition. She was a member of the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC) and suffered persecution and torture for her political ideas during the Franco dictatorship. In 1976 she created the Feminist Collective of Barcelona, the magazine Vindicación feminista, and the publishing house Ediciones de Feminismo. In 1977 she founded the Revolutionary Feminist Organization, from which the Feminist Party of Spain was created. Since 1979 she has directed the magazine Poder y libertad. Biography Lidia Falcón O'Neill was born on 13 December 1935 in Madrid, the daughter of the Peruvian César Falcón and the Spaniard (Regina Flavio), both writers and journalists, among other professions. Her parents met when her mother worked in the theater of her father, who was married with Irene Falcón, so his mother raised her alone. Both her maternal grandmother Regina de Lamo (Nora Avante) and her maternal aunt Carlota O'Neill (Laura de Noves) were writers, so it was not considered unusual when she wrote her first play at age 12. During the dictatorship Enriqueta O'Neill worked as a Francoist censor and would maintain a relationship with the Carlist and provincial press secretary – the highest office of censorship in Barcelona – , who would be Lidia Falcón's godfather. Falcón herself was imprisoned for her political demands, and her mother committed suicide on 17 November 1972 in Barcelona.
