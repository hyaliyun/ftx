Background It was a military operation planned by Captain Eugenio Daza of the Philippine Republican Army, Area Commander of General Manuel Lukban's forces for Southeastern Samar, that took place in Balangiga in 1901 during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. The attack was led by Valeriano Abanador the Jefe de la Polic√≠a (Chief of Police).Tucker, Spencer (2009). The Encyclopedia of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars: A Political, Social, and Military History. ABC-CLIO. pp. 345. . On September 28, 1901 =The Battle= The Battle of Balangiga took place in the town of Balangiga on Samar Island on September 28, 1901 wherein 48 members of the US 9th Infantry were ambushed by irregular forces made up of the Chief of Police, local police officers, local government officials, villagers, and augmented by soldiers of the Philippine Republican Army.Anderson, B. (2006). Under Three Flags: Anarchism and the Anti-Colonial Imagination. New York: Verso Books. =Aftermath= This battle was described as the \\"worst defeat of United States Army soldiers since the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876\\". =Legacy= The attack and the subsequent retaliation remains one of the longest-running and most controversial issues between the Philippines and the United States. Conflicting records from American and Philippine historians have confused the issue. According to the famous Philippine historian Teodoro Agoncillo:, \\"In their desperation, the American soldiers turned arsonists burning whole towns in order to force guerrillas to the open. One such infamous case occurred in the town of Balangiga, Samar, in 1901-1902.\\" > \\"The true \\"Balangiga massacre\\" was the subsequent retaliation against the > Samar population and guerrillas when American soldiers burned whole towns > during the March across Samar.\\" Prelude Soldiers of Company C, 9th US Infantry Regiment with Valeriano Abanador (standing, sixth from right) in Balangiga in August 1901. In the summer of 1901, Brigadier General Robert P. Hughes, who commanded the Department of the Visayas and was responsible for Samar, instigated an aggressive policy of food deprivation and property destruction on the island. The objective was to force the end of Philippine resistance. Part of his strategy was to close three key ports on the southern coast, Basey, Balangiga and Guiuan. Samar was a major centre for the production of Manila hemp, the trade of which was financing Philippine forces on the island. At the same time United States interests were eager to secure control of the hemp trade, which was a vital material both for the United States Navy and American agro- industries such as cotton. On August 11, 1901, Company C of the 9th U.S. Infantry Regiment, arrived in Balangiga‚Äîthe third largest town on the southern coast of Samar island‚Äîto close its port and prevent supplies reaching Philippine forces in the interior, which at that time were under the command of General Vicente Lukb√°n. Lukb√°n had been sent there in December 1898 to govern the island on behalf of the First Philippine Republic under Emilio Aguinaldo. In late May of 1901, prior to the stationing of any Americans in Balangiga, town mayor Pedro Abayan had written to Lukban pledging to \\"observe a deceptive policy with [Americans] doing whatever they may like, and when a favorable opportunity arises, the people will strategically rise against them.\\"As quoted in (citing ) Relations between the soldiers and the townspeople were amicable for the first month of the American presence in the town; indeed it was marked by extensive fraternization between the two parties. This took the form of tuba (palm wine) drinking among the soldiers and male villagers, baseball games and arnis demonstrations. However, tensions rose due to several reasons: Captain Thomas W. Connell, commanding officer of the American unit in Balangiga, ordered the town cleaned up in preparation for a visit by the U.S. Army's inspector-general. However, in complying with his directive, the townspeople inadvertently cut down vegetation with food value, in violation of Lukb√°n's policies regarding food security. As a consequence, on September 18, 1901, around 400 guerrillas sent by Lukb√°n appeared in the vicinity of Balangiga. They were to mete sanctions upon the town officials and local residents for violating Lukb√°n's orders regarding food security and for fraternizing with the Americans. The threat was probably defused by Captain Eugenio Daza, a member of Lukb√°n's staff, and by the parish priest, Father Donato Guimbaolibot. A few days later, Connell had the town's male residents rounded up and detained for the purpose of hastening his clean-up operations. Around 80 men were kept in two Sibley tents unfed overnight. In addition, Connell had the men's bolos and the stored rice for their tables confiscated. These events would have sufficiently insulted and angered the townspeople; and without the sympathy of Lukb√°n's guerrillas, the civilians were left to their own devices to plan their course of action against the Americans. A few days before the attack, Valeriano Abanador, the town's police chief, and Captain Daza met to plan the attack on the American unit. To address the issue of sufficient manpower to offset the Americans' advantage in firepower, Abanador and Daza disguised the congregation of men as a work force aimed at preparing the town for a local fiesta, which incidentally, also served to address Connell's preparations for his superior's visit. Abanador also brought in a group of \\"tax evaders\\" to bolster their numbers. Much palm wine was brought in to ensure that the American soldiers would be drunk the day after the fiesta. Hours before the attack, women and children were sent away to safety. To mask the disappearance of the women from the dawn service in the church, 34 men from Barrio Lawaan cross-dressed as women worshippers. These \\"women\\", carrying small coffins, were challenged by Sergeant Scharer of the sentry post about the town plaza near the church. Opening one of the coffins with his bayonet, he saw the body of a dead child who, he was told, was a victim of a cholera epidemic. Abashed, he let the women pass on. Unbeknownst to the sentries, the other coffins hid the bolos and other weapons of the attackers. The issue of children's bodies merits further attention since there is much conflict between accounts by members of Company C. That day, the 27th, was the 52nd anniversary of the founding of the parish, an occasion on which an image of a recumbent Christ known as a Santo Entierro would have been carried around the parish. In modern times these Santo Entierros are enclosed in a glass case but at the time were commonly enclosed in a wooden box. Attack on American soldiers The US 9th Infantry Regiment in the Philippines, 1899 Between 6:20 and 6:45 in the morning of September 28, 1901, the villagers made their move. Abanador, who had been supervising the prisoners' communal labor in the town plaza, grabbed the rifle of Private Adolph Gamlin, one of the American sentries, and stunned him with a blow to the head. This served as the signal for the rest of the communal laborers in the plaza to rush the other sentries and soldiers of Company C, who were mostly having breakfast in the mess area. Abanador then gave a shout, signaling the other Philippine men to the attack and fired Gamlin's rifle at the mess tent, hitting one of the soldiers. The pealing of the church bells and the sounds from conch shells being blown followed seconds later. Some of the Company C troopers were attacked and hacked to death before they could grab their rifles; the few who survived the initial onslaught fought almost bare-handed, using kitchen utensils, steak knives, and chairs. One private used a baseball bat to fend off the attackers before being overwhelmed. The men detained in the Sibley tents broke out and made their way to the municipal hall. Simultaneously, the attackers hidden in the church broke into the parish house and killed the three American officers there. An unarmed Company C soldier was ignored, as was Captain Connell's Philippine houseboy. The attackers initially occupied the parish house and the municipal hall; however, the attack at the mess tents and the barracks failed, with Pvt. Gamlin, recovering consciousness and managing to secure another rifle, caused considerable casualties among the Philippine forces. With the initial surprise wearing off and the attack degrading, Abanador called for the attackers to break off and retreat. The surviving Company C soldiers, led by Sergeant Frank Betron, escaped by sea to Basey and Tanauan, Leyte. The townspeople buried their dead and abandoned the town. Of the 74 men in Company C, 36 were killed in action, including all its commissioned officers: Captain Thomas W. Connell, First Lieutenant Edward A. Bumpus and Major Richard S. Griswold. Twenty-two were wounded in action and four were missing in action. Eight died later of wounds received in combat; only four escaped unscathed.The Official report War Department 1901 reports casualties as 3 officers and 33 NCOs and enlisted ranks dead; 3 died of wounds; 7 members of Company C 9th Infantry and 1 Hospital Corps Private missing [the report acknowledges several bodies were cremated when the barracks were burned]; 21 wounded; 16 present not wounded. See Annual Reports of the War Department, Volume 9 p.629 Report of Captain Bookmiller, 9th Infantry The villagers captured about 100 rifles and 25,000 rounds of ammunition and suffered 28 dead and 22 wounded. Retaliation General Jacob H. Smith's infamous order \\"Kill Everyone Over Ten\\" was the caption in the New York Journal cartoon on May 5, 1902. The Old Glory draped an American shield on which a vulture replaced the bald eagle. The caption at the bottom proclaimed, \\"Criminals Because They Were Born Ten Years Before We Took the Philippines\\" Captain Edwin Victor Bookmiller, the commander in Basey, sailed immediately with Company G, 9th Infantry Regiment for Balangiga aboard a commandeered coastal steamer, the SS Pittsburgh. Finding the town abandoned, they buried the American dead and set fire to the town. Coming at a time when it was believed Filipino resistance to American rule had collapsed, the Balangiga attack had a powerful impact on Americans living in Manila. Men started to wear sidearms openly and Helen Herron Taft, wife of the American Governor-General of the Philippines William Howard Taft, was so distraught she required evacuation to Hong Kong.Taft, Helen Herron, Recollections of Full Years, Butterick Publishing, New York (1914), p. 225 The Balangiga incident provoked shock in the US public, too, with newspapers equating the massacre to George Armstrong Custer's last stand at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. Major General Adna R. Chaffee, military governor of the Philippines, received orders from US President Theodore Roosevelt to pacify Samar. To this end, Chaffee appointed Brigadier General Jacob H. Smith to Samar to accomplish the task. General Smith instructed Major Littleton Waller, commanding officer of a battalion of 315 US Marines assigned to bolster his forces in Samar, regarding the conduct of pacification: As a consequence of this order, Smith became known as \\"Howling Wilderness Smith\\"; he was also dubbed \\"Hell Roaring Jake\\" Smith, \\"The Monster\\", and \\"Howling Jake\\" by the press as a result. He further ordered Waller to kill all persons who were capable of bearing arms and in actual hostilities against the United States forces. When queried by Waller regarding the age limit of these persons, Smith replied that the limit was ten years of age. Food and trade to Samar were cut off, intended to starve the revolutionaries into submission. Smith's strategy on Samar involved widespread destruction to force the inhabitants to stop supporting the guerrillas and turn to the Americans from fear and starvation. He used his troops in sweeps of the interior in search for guerrilla bands and in attempts to capture Philippine General Vicente Lukb√°n, but he did nothing to prevent contact between the guerrillas and the townspeople. American columns marched across the island, destroying homes and shooting people and draft animals. Littleton Waller, in a report, stated that over an eleven-day period his men burned 255 dwellings, shot 13 carabaos and killed 39 people. The Judge Advocate General of the Army observed that only the good sense and restraint of the majority of Smith's subordinates prevented a complete reign of terror in Samar. The abuses outraged anti-Imperialist groups in the United States when these became known in March 1902. The exact number of Filipinos killed by US troops will never be known. A population shortfall of about 15,000 is apparent between the Spanish census of 1887 and the American census of 1903 but how much of the shortfall is due to a disease epidemic and known natural disasters and how many due to combat is difficult to determine. Population growth in 19th century Samar was amplified by an influx of workers for the booming hemp industry, an influx which certainly ceased during the Samar campaign. Exhaustive research in the 1990s made by British writer Bob Couttie as part of a ten-year study of the Balangiga massacre tentatively put the figure at about 2,500; David Fritz used population ageing techniques and suggested a figure of a little more than 2,000 losses in males of combat age but nothing to support widespread killing of women and children Fritz, David L, Before \\"The Howling Wilderness\\": The Military Career of Jacob Heard Smith, Military Affairs, November‚ÄìDecember (1979), p. 186 Some American and Filipino historians believe it to be around 50,000.Young, Kenneth Ray, \\"Guerrilla Warfare Revisited\\", Leyte Samar Studies, XI:1 (1977), pp. 21‚Äì31 The rate of Samar's population growth slowed as refugees fled from Samar to Leyte,US Senate Committee Hearings \\"Affairs in the Philippine Islands\\" February 3, 1902, Vol. 3, p. 2341 yet still the population of Samar increased by 21,456 during the war. American military historians' opinions on the Samar campaign are echoed in the February 2011 edition of the US Army's official historical magazine, Army History Bulletin: \\"...the indiscriminate violence and punishment that U.S. Army and Marine forces under Brig. Gen. Jacob Smith are alleged to have unleashed on Samar have long stained the memory of the United States‚Äô pacification of the Philippine Islands\\".Hendricks, Charles, Editor's Journal, Army History Bulletin, PB 20-11-2 (No. 79), p. 2 Commanding officers' courts-martial American soldiers in Calbayog, Samar pose with a church bell taken from Balangiga as war trophy. Events in Samar resulted in prompt investigations. On April 15, 1902 the Secretary of War Elihu Root sent orders to relieve officers of duty and to court-martial General Smith. \\"The President (Theodore Roosevelt) desires to know and in the most circumstantial manner all facts, nothing being concealed, and no man being for any reason favored or shielded. For the very reason that the President intends to back up the Army in the heartiest fashion in every lawful and legitimate method of doing its work, he also intends to see that the most rigorous care is exercised to detect and prevent any cruelty or brutality, and that men who are guilty thereof are punished\\".\\"Affairs in the Philippine Islands\\", Vol. II, p. 1549 Jacob H. Smith and Littleton Waller faced courts martial as a result of their heavy-handed treatment of Filipinos; Waller specifically for the execution of twelve Filipino bearers and guides. Waller was found not guilty, a finding that senior military officials did not accept. Smith was found guilty, admonished and forced to retire. A third officer, Captain Edwin Glenn, was court-martialled for torturing Filipinos and was found guilty. Factual disputes Several factual inaccuracies in early published accounts have surfaced over the years as historians continue to re- investigate the Balangiga incident. These include: *Schott and Rey Imperial assert that Company C of the 9th US Infantry was sent to Balangiga in response to a request by its then-Mayor Pedro Abayan. This is based solely on a claim by George Meyer, a Company C survivor, in support of efforts to secure the Medal of Honor. Author Bob Couttie asserts that the American unit was sent there to close Balangiga's port. *James Taylor's account inspired another author, William T. Sexton, to write that the American soldiers were \\"butchered like hogs\\" in Soldiers in the Sun. However, Eugenio Daza wrote, \\"The Filipino believes that the profanation of the dead necessarily brings bad luck and misfortune ... there was no time to lose for such acts [after the Balangiga attack].\\" Gallery File:Balangiga Massacre Monument.jpgBattle of Balangiga monument Balangiga massacre memorial marker.JPGBattle of Balangiga memorial marker Statue of Valeriano Abanador.JPGStatue of Valeriano Abanador, Balangiga police chief during the Battle of Balangiga Historical marker at the foot of Valeriano Abanador statue.JPGHistorical marker at the foot of Abanador statue See also *Balangiga bells, on the bells seized as spoils of war and returned to the Philippines in 2018 *Eugenio Daza *Vicente Lukban *History of the Philippines (1898‚Äì1946) *Timeline of the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War *Campaigns of the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War Notes References Further * *, (e-book) * 1901 in the Philippines Battles involving the United States Battles of the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War Events that led to courts-martial History of Eastern Samar Massacres committed by the United States September 1901 events Visayan history War crimes in the Philippines ","title":"Battle of Balangiga"},{"id":"601263","text":", better known by the stage name of , is a Japanese actress, voice actress, singer and narrator.

He was one of the most prolific mathematicians and producers of mathematical conjectures of the 20th century. He was known both for his social practice of mathematics (he engaged more than 500 collaborators) and for his eccentric lifestyle (Time magazine called him The Oddball's Oddball). He devoted his waking hours to mathematics, even into his later years‚Äîindeed, his death came only hours after he solved a geometry problem at a conference in Warsaw. pursued and proposed problems in discrete mathematics, graph theory, number theory, mathematical analysis, approximation theory, set theory, and probability theory. Much of his work centered around discrete mathematics, cracking many previously unsolved problems in the field. He championed and contributed to Ramsey theory, which studies the conditions in which order necessarily appears. Overall, his work leaned towards solving previously open problems, rather than developing or exploring new areas of mathematics. Erd≈ës published around 1,500 mathematical papers during his lifetime, a figure that remains unsurpassed.According to , using the Mathematical Reviews data base, the next highest article count is roughly 823. He firmly believed mathematics to be a social activity, living an itinerant lifestyle with the sole purpose of writing mathematical papers with other mathematicians. Erd≈ës's prolific output with co-authors prompted the creation of the Erd≈ës number, the number of steps in the shortest path between a mathematician and Erd≈ës in terms of co-authorships. Life Paul Erd≈ës was born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary, on 26 March 1913. He was the only surviving child of Anna (n√©e Wilhelm) and Lajos Erd≈ës (born as Lajos Engl√§nder). His two sisters, aged 3 and 5, both died of scarlet fever a few days before he was born. His parents were both Jewish mathematics teachers. His fascination with mathematics developed early‚Äîhe was often left home by himself because his father was held captive in Siberia as an Austro-Hungarian POW during 1914‚Äì1920, causing his mother to have to work long hours to support their household. He taught himself to read through mathematics texts that his parents left around in their home. By the age of four, given a person's age, he could calculate in his head how many seconds they had lived.Hoffman, p. 66. Due to his sisters' deaths, he had a close relationship with his mother, with the two of them reportedly sharing the same bed until he left for college. Erd≈ës entered the University of Budapest at the age of 17. By the time he was 20, he had found a proof for Chebyshev's theorem. In 1934, at the age of 21, he was awarded a doctorate in mathematics. Erd≈ës's thesis advisor was Lip√≥t Fej√©r, who was also the thesis advisor for John von Neumann, George P√≥lya, and Paul (P√°l) Tur√°n. Because he was Jewish, Erd≈ës decided Hungary was dangerous and relocated to the United States. Many members of Erd≈ës' family, including two of his aunts, two of his uncles, and his father, died in Budapest during the Holocaust. His mother survived in hiding. He was living in America and working at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study at the time. Described by his biographer, Paul Hoffman, as \\"probably the most eccentric mathematician in the world,\\" Erd≈ës spent most of his adult life living out of a suitcase. Except for some years in the 1950s, when he was not allowed to enter the United States based on the pretense that he was a Communist sympathizer, his life was a continuous series of going from one meeting or seminar to another. During his visits, Erd≈ës expected his hosts to lodge him, feed him, and do his laundry, along with anything else he needed, as well as arrange for him to get to his next destination. On 20 September 1996, at the age of 83, he had a heart attack and died while attending a conference in Warsaw. These circumstances were close to the way he wanted to die. He once said, Erd≈ës never married and had no children. He is buried next to his mother and father in grave 17A-6-29 at Kozma Street Cemetery in Budapest. For his epitaph, he suggested \\"I've finally stopped getting dumber.\\" (Hungarian: \\"V√©gre nem butulok tov√°bb\\").Hoffman, p. 3. His life was documented in the film N is a Number: A Portrait of Paul Erd≈ës, made while he was still alive, and posthumously in the book The Man Who Loved Only Numbers (1998). Erd≈ës' name contains the Hungarian letter \\"≈ë\\" (\\"o\\" with double acute accent), but is often incorrectly written as Erdos or Erd√∂s either \\"by mistake or out of typographical necessity\\".The full quote is \\"Note the pair of long accents on the \\"≈ë,\\" often (even in Erdos's own papers) by mistake or out of typographical necessity replaced by \\"√∂,\\" the more familiar German umlaut which also exists in Hungarian.\\", from Personality Possessions meant little to Erd≈ës; most of his belongings would fit in a suitcase, as dictated by his itinerant lifestyle. Awards and other earnings were generally donated to people in need and various worthy causes. He spent most of his life traveling between scientific conferences, universities and the homes of colleagues all over the world. He earned enough in stipends from universities as a guest lecturer, and from various mathematical awards, to fund his travels and basic needs; money left over he used to fund cash prizes for proofs of \\"Erd≈ës problems\\" (see below). He would typically show up at a colleague's doorstep and announce \\"my brain is open\\", staying long enough to collaborate on a few papers before moving on a few days later. In many cases, he would ask the current collaborator about whom to visit next. His colleague Alfr√©d R√©nyi said, \\"a mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems\\",Biography of Alfr√©d R√©nyi by J.J. O'Connor and E.F. Robertson and Erd≈ës drank copious quantities (this quotation is often attributed incorrectly to Erd≈ës, but Erd≈ës himself ascribed it to R√©nyi). After 1971 he also took stimulants, despite the concern of his friends, one of whom (Ron Graham) bet him $500 that he could not stop taking them for a month.Hill, J. Paul Erdos, Mathematical Genius, Human (In That Order) Erd≈ës won the bet, but complained that during his abstinence, mathematics had been set back by a month: \\"Before, when I looked at a piece of blank paper my mind was filled with ideas. Now all I see is a blank piece of paper.\\" After he won the bet, he promptly resumed his use of Ritalin and Benzedrine. He had his own idiosyncratic vocabulary: although an agnostic atheist, he spoke of \\"The Book\\", a visualization of a book in which God had written down the best and most elegant proofs for mathematical theorems. Lecturing in 1985 he said, \\"You don't have to believe in God, but you should believe in The Book.\\" He himself doubted the existence of God, whom he called the \\"Supreme Fascist\\" (SF). He accused SF of hiding his socks and Hungarian passports, and of keeping the most elegant mathematical proofs to Himself. When he saw a particularly beautiful mathematical proof he would exclaim, \\"This one's from The Book!\\" This later inspired a book titled Proofs from the Book. Other idiosyncratic elements of Erd≈ës's vocabulary include:Hoffman, chapter 1. As included with The New York Times review of the book. * Children were referred to as \\"epsilons\\" (because in mathematics, particularly calculus, an arbitrarily small positive quantity is commonly denoted by the Greek letter (Œµ)). * Women were \\"bosses\\" who \\"captured\\" men as \\"slaves\\" by marrying them. Divorced men were \\"liberated\\". * People who stopped doing mathematics had \\"died\\", while people who died had \\"left\\". * Alcoholic drinks were \\"poison\\". * Music (except classical music) was \\"noise\\". * To be considered a hack was to be a \\"Newton\\". * To give a mathematical lecture was \\"to preach\\". * To give an oral exam to students was \\"to torture\\" them. He gave nicknames to many countries, examples being: the U.S. was \\"samland\\" (after Uncle Sam), the Soviet Union was \\"joedom\\" (after Joseph Stalin), and Israel was \\"\\". Career In 1934, he moved to Manchester, England, to be a guest lecturer. In 1938, he accepted his first American position as a scholarship holder at Princeton University. At this time, he began to develop the habit of traveling from campus to campus. He would not stay long in one place and traveled back and forth among mathematical institutions until his death. In 1954, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services denied Erd≈ës, a Hungarian citizen, a re-entry visa into the United States, for reasons that have never been fully explained. Teaching at the University of Notre Dame at the time, Erd≈ës could have chosen to remain in the country. Instead, he packed up and left, albeit requesting reconsideration from the U.S. Immigration Services at periodic intervals. Counter-clockwise from left: Erd≈ës, Fan Chung, and her husband Ronald Graham, Japan 1986 Hungary at the time was under the Warsaw Pact with the Soviet Union. Although Hungary limited the freedom of its own citizens to enter and exit the country, it gave Erd≈ës the exclusive privilege of being allowed to enter and exit the country as he pleased in 1956. In 1963, the U.S. Immigration Service granted Erd≈ës a visa, and he resumed including American universities in his teaching and travels. Ten years later, in 1973, the 60-year-old Erd≈ës voluntarily left Hungary. During the last decades of his life, Erd≈ës received at least fifteen honorary doctorates. He became a member of the scientific academies of eight countries, including the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the UK Royal Society. He became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977. Shortly before his death, he renounced his honorary degree from the University of Waterloo over what he considered to be unfair treatment of colleague Adrian Bondy.Transcription of October 2, 1996, article from University of Waterloo Gazette (archive) =Mathematical work= Erd≈ës was one of the most prolific publishers of papers in mathematical history, comparable only with Leonhard Euler; Erd≈ës published more papers, mostly in collaboration with other mathematicians, while Euler published more pages, mostly by himself.Hoffman, p. 42. Erd≈ës wrote around 1,525 mathematical articles in his lifetime, mostly with co-authors. He strongly believed in and practiced mathematics as a social activity, having 511 different collaborators in his lifetime. In his mathematical style, Erd≈ës was much more of a \\"problem solver\\" than a \\"theory developer\\" (see \\"The Two Cultures of Mathematics\\" by Timothy Gowers for an in- depth discussion of the two styles, and why problem solvers are perhaps less appreciated). Joel Spencer states that \\"his place in the 20th-century mathematical pantheon is a matter of some controversy because he resolutely concentrated on particular theorems and conjectures throughout his illustrious career.\\" This article is a review of Mathematics: Frontiers and Perspectives Erd≈ës never won the highest mathematical prize, the Fields Medal, nor did he coauthor a paper with anyone who did, a pattern that extends to other prizes.From \\"trails to Erdos\\" , by DeCastro and Grossman, in The Mathematical Intelligencer, vol. 21, no. 3 (Summer 1999), 51‚Äì63: A careful reading of Table 3 shows that although Erdos never wrote jointly with any of the 42 [Fields] medalists (a fact perhaps worthy of further contemplation)... there are many other important international awards for mathematicians. Perhaps the three most renowned...are the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize, the Wolf Prize in Mathematics, and the Leroy P. Steele Prizes. ... Again, one may wonder why KAPLANSKY is the only recipient of any of these prizes who collaborated with Paul Erd√∂s. (After this paper was written, collaborator Lov√°sz received the Wolf prize, making 2 in all). He did win the Wolf Prize, where his contribution is described as \\"for his numerous contributions to number theory, combinatorics, probability, set theory and mathematical analysis, and for personally stimulating mathematicians the world over\\". In contrast, the works of the three winners after were recognized as \\"outstanding\\", \\"classic\\", and \\"profound\\", and the three before as \\"fundamental\\" or \\"seminal\\". Of his contributions, the development of Ramsey theory and the application of the probabilistic method especially stand out. Extremal combinatorics owes to him a whole approach, derived in part from the tradition of analytic number theory. Erd≈ës found a proof for Bertrand's postulate which proved to be far neater than Chebyshev's original one. He also discovered the first elementary proof for the prime number theorem, along with Atle Selberg. However, the circumstances leading up to the proofs, as well as publication disagreements, led to a bitter dispute between Erd≈ës and Selberg. Erd≈ës also contributed to fields in which he had little real interest, such as topology, where he is credited as the first person to give an example of a totally disconnected topological space that is not zero-dimensional, the Erd≈ës space. =Erd≈ës' problems= Erd≈ës influenced many young mathematicians. In this 1985 photo taken at the University of Adelaide, Erd≈ës explains a problem to Terence Tao‚Äîwho was 10 years old at the time. Tao received the Fields Medal in 2006, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2007. Throughout his career, Erd≈ës would offer payments for solutions to unresolved problems. These ranged from $25 for problems that he felt were just out of the reach of the current mathematical thinking (both his and others), to several thousand dollars for problems that were both difficult to attack and mathematically significant. There are thought to be at least a thousand remaining unsolved problems, though there is no official or comprehensive list. The offers remained active despite Erd≈ës's death; Ronald Graham was the (informal) administrator of solutions, and a solver could receive either an original check signed by Erd≈ës before his death (for memento only, cannot be cashed) or a cashable check from Graham. Perhaps the most mathematically notable of these problems is the Erd≈ës conjecture on arithmetic progressions: If true, it would solve several other open problems in number theory (although one main implication of the conjecture, that the prime numbers contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions, has since been proved independently as the Green‚ÄìTao theorem). The payment for the solution of the problem is currently worth US$5,000.p. 354, Soifer, Alexander (2008); The Mathematical Coloring Book: Mathematics of Coloring and the Colorful Life of its Creators; New York: Springer. The most familiar problem with an Erd≈ës prize is likely the Collatz conjecture, also called the 3N + 1 problem. Erd≈ës offered $500 for a solution. =Collaborators= His most frequent collaborators include Hungarian mathematicians Andr√°s S√°rk√∂zy (62 papers) and Andr√°s Hajnal (56 papers), and American mathematician Ralph Faudree (50 papers). Other frequent collaborators were the following:List of collaborators of Erd≈ës by number of joint papers , from the Erd≈ës number project website. * Richard Schelp (42 papers) * C. C.

Erd≈ës number Because of his prolific output, friends created the Erd≈ës number as a tribute. An Erd≈ës number describes a person's degree of separation from Erd≈ës himself, based on their collaboration with him, or with another who has their own Erd≈ës number. Erd≈ës alone was assigned the Erd≈ës number of 0 (for being himself), while his immediate collaborators could claim an Erd≈ës number of 1, their collaborators have Erd≈ës number at most 2, and so on. Approximately 200,000 mathematicians have an assigned Erd≈ës number, and some have estimated that 90 percent of the world's active mathematicians have an Erd≈ës number smaller than 8 (not surprising in light of the small world phenomenon). Due to collaborations with mathematicians, many scientists in fields such as physics, engineering, biology, and economics have Erd≈ës numbers as well. Several studies have shown that leading mathematicians tend to have particularly low Erd≈ës numbers. Original Spanish version in Rev. Acad. Colombiana Cienc. Exact. F√≠s. Natur. 23 (89) 563‚Äì582, 1999, . For example, the roughly 268,000 mathematicians with a known Erd≈ës number have a median value of 5. In contrast, the median Erd≈ës number of Fields Medalists is 3. As of 2015, approximately 11,000 mathematicians have an Erd≈ës number of 2 or less. Collaboration distances will necessarily increase over long time scales, as mathematicians with low Erd≈ës numbers die and become unavailable for collaboration. The American Mathematical Society provides a free online tool to determine the Erd≈ës number of every mathematical author listed in the Mathematical Reviews catalogue. The Erd≈ës number was most likely first defined by Casper Goffman,Michael Golomb's obituary of Paul Erd≈ës an analyst whose own Erd≈ës number is 2.from the Erdos Number Project Goffman published his observations about Erd≈ës's prolific collaboration in a 1969 article titled \\"And what is your Erd≈ës number?\\" Jerry Grossman has written that it could be argued that Baseball Hall of Famer Hank Aaron can be considered to have an Erd≈ës number of 1 because they both autographed the same baseball (for Carl Pomerance) when Emory University awarded them honorary degrees on the same day. Erd≈ës numbers have also been proposed for an infant, a horse, and several actors. Signature Erd≈ës signed his name \\"Paul Erdos P.G.O.M.\\" When he became 60, he added \\"L.D.\\", at 65 \\"A.D.\\", at 70 \\"L.D.\\" (again), and at 75 \\"C.D.\\" * P.G.O.M. represented \\"Poor Great Old Man\\" * The first L.D. represented \\"Living Dead\\" * A.D. represented \\"Archaeological Discovery\\" * The second L.D. represented \\"Legally Dead\\" * C.D. represented \\"Counts Dead\\"My Brain is Open.

The university was offered an ornate sandstone building on the Queens Domain in Hobart, previously the High School of Hobart, though it was leased by others until mid-1892. This eventually became known as University House. Three lecturers began teaching 11 students from 22 March 1893, once University House had been renovated. Parliamentarians branding it an unnecessary luxury made the university's early existence precarious. The institution's encouragement of female students fuelled criticism. James Backhouse Walker, a local lawyer and briefly Vice-Chancellor, mounted a courageous defence. By the First World War there were over 100 students, and several Tasmanian graduates were influential in law and politics. According to Chancellor Sir John Morris, from 1918 until 1939 the institution still 'limped along'. Distinguished staff had already been appointed, such as historian William Jethro Brown, physicists and mathematicians Alexander McAulay and his son Alexander Leicester McAulay, classicist RL Dunbabin, and philosopher and polymath Edmund Morris Miller. Housed in the former Hobart High School, facilities were totally outgrown, but the state government was slow to fund a new campus. In 1914 the university petitioned King George V for Letters Patent,http://eprints.utas.edu.au/15872/2/Petition-UTAS.pdf. Accessed 26 June 2014. which request he granted. The Letters Patent, sometimes called the Royal Charter, granted the university's degrees status as equivalent to the established universities of the United Kingdom, where such equivalents existed.http://eprints.utas.edu.au/15939/. Accessed 26 June 2014. =World War II (1939‚Äì45)= During the Second World War, while the Optical Munitions Annexe assisted the war effort, local graduates, replacing soldier academics, taught a handful of students. New post-war staff, many with overseas experience, pressed for removal to adequate facilities at Sandy Bay on an old rifle range. Chancellor Sir John Morris, also Chief Justice, though a dynamic reformer, antagonised academics by his authoritarianism. Vice-Chancellor Torliev Hytten, an eminent economist, saw contention peak while the move to Sandy Bay was delayed. In a passionate open letter to the premier, Philosophy Professor Sydney Orr goaded the government into establishing the 1955 Royal Commission into the university. The commission's report demanded extensive reform of both university and governing council. Staff were delighted, while lay administrators fumed. =Post-war years (1946‚Äì1964)= The university's first site at Queens Domain. The university moved to its Sandy Bay campus in the early 1960s On 10 May 1949, the university awarded its first Doctor of Philosophy to Joan Munro Ford. Ford worked as a research biologist in the University of Tasmania's Department of Physics between 1940 and 1950. In early 1956 Orr was summarily dismissed, mainly for his alleged though denied seduction of a student. A ten-year battle involved academics in Australia and overseas. Orr lost an unfair dismissal action in the Supreme Court of Tasmania and the High Court of Australia. The Tasmanian Chair of Philosophy was boycotted. In 1966 Orr received some financial compensation from the University, which also established a cast-iron tenure system. The latter disappeared with the federal reorganisation of higher education in the late 1980s. In the early 1960s The University of Tasmania at last transferred to a purpose-built new campus at Sandy Bay, though many departments were initially housed in ex-World War II wooden huts. It profited from increasing federal finance following the 1957 Murray Report. Medical and Agricultural Schools were established and the sciences obtained adequate laboratories. Physics achieved world recognition in astronomy (optical, radio and cosmic rays), while other departments attracted good scholars and graduates were celebrated in many fields. Student facilities improved remarkably.Karmel Report =Mergers and the \\"new\\" university (1965‚Äì99)= The 1965 Martin Report established a traditional role for universities, and a more practical role for colleges of advanced education. The Tasmanian Government duly created the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education (TCAE) in 1966 sited on Mount Nelson above the university. It initially incorporated The School of Art, the Conservatorium of Music and the Hobart Teachers College. In 1971, a Launceston campus of the TCAE was announced. These were fateful decisions, as events over the next years showed. It was argued that the TCAE attempted to compete with the university, not complement it. In 1978 the University of Tasmania took over two of the courses offered by the TCAE in Hobart, Pharmacy and Surveying, following a report by Professor Karmel, and another by H.E. Cosgrove. Some other TCAE courses in Hobart moved to Launceston. The curious situation of three separate courses in teacher education in the State could not last, however, and following two more reports, the university incorporated the remaining courses of the Hobart campus of the College of Advanced Education in 1981, which raised its numbers to 5000. The Launceston campus of the TCAE renamed itself the Tasmanian State Institute of Technology (TSIT). In 1987, the University Council resolved to approach the TSIT to negotiate a merger to minimise ongoing conflict. The 'Dawkins Revolution' and the 'unified national system' provided later support for this initiative. The Tasmanian State Institute of Technology became the Newnham Campus of the university on 1 January 1991, exactly 101 years after the university's founding. A new campus at Burnie on the North-West Coast of Tasmania was opened in 1995, and later became known as the Cradle Coast Campus. =21st century= In 2001, the Tasmania Law Reform Institute (TLRI) was established to create a link between institutional law reform in the State created by the demise of first the Tasmanian Law Reform Commission in 1989, and then its replacement, the Tasmanian Law Reform Commissioner in 1997. The new institutes model was based on the Alberta Law Reform Institute, an agency based on an agreement between the Canadian province of Alberta, the Law Society , and the University of Alberta and funded primarily by the Government and the Law Society of Alberta. The TLRI has been used as a template for the establishment of similar institutes at the University of Adelaide with the South Australian Law Reform Institute and in the Australian Capital Territory. Damian Bugg became the university's chancellor in 2006, having previously served as a member of the University Council since 2001. Bugg was an alumnus of the university who studied law and resided at John Fisher College where he was president. While chancellor, he also served as Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. That year the university opened two satellite campuses in Sydney, offering nursing and paramedic education in partnership with local hospitals and health services such as St Vincent's Hospital. The Greenhill Observatory joined the universities other radio astronomy antennas including the Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory (pictured) in Cambridge, Tasmania The Australian Maritime College (AMC) merged with the university in 2008. The merger helped streamline degree programs and improved provision of basic services at the combined Newnham campus. The University formed the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) in 2010 to help integrate the Institute of Antarctic and Southern Ocean Studied and the Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute, as well as the universities existing marine and Antarctic facility. The Greenhill Observatory which houses a 1.27 meter optical telescope was opened in 2013 to replace the previous observatory at Canopus Hill, near Hobart. The observatory joined the universities two other observatories including the Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory and Ceduna Radio Observatory in Ceduna, South Australia. Campuses The university has three main campuses based in Hobart, Launceston and Burnie. It also has a number of small, specialist facilities within the College of Health and Medicine at its Darlinghurst and Rozelle campuses in Sydney. It also has a joint research facility at the city's Australian National Maritime Museum in Pyrmont. =Southern= Hobart The MS1 Building of the Medical Sciences Precinct * Tasmanian Conservatorium of Music (the Conservatorium of Music campus is no longer a public building; access to the premises by the public, students and staff is restricted). *Medical Sciences Precinct in the inner city that encompasses the College of Health and Medicine and the Menzies Institute for Medical Research.

Coat of arms The Grant of Arms was made by the College of Arms. The blazon reads: '''' In 1936 the University Council ran a competition to produce a draft set of Arms to replace the common seal it had used since 1901, based on the badge of the Tasmanian Council of Education with the motto Floreat Tasmania (May Tasmania Prosper). The winning design included four key elements of the current Arms of the university including a lion (representing Tasmania), a book (representing the academic side of the University), a Southern Cross (representing Australia) and a touch (representing the athletic side of the University), over a crown (Or) (signifying the royal charter held by the University). The official coat of arms was granted by the College of Heralds in 1978. The core elements of the 1936 design were kept with slight adjustments made to comply with heraldic rules. Student life =Student unionism= Until 2008, there were two separate student unions: the Tasmania University Union (TUU) in Hobart and the Student Association (SA) in Launceston. Following the abolition of compulsory student unionism in 2007, the SA and the TUU amalgamated into one statewide organisation representing all UTAS students.http://www.electoral.tas.gov.au/pages/OtherElections/TUU/PDF/TUU%20notice%20of%20election.pdf The TUU is responsible for the overseeing of all the university's many sports clubs and societies. Some of these include faculty-based societies providing academic and careers guidance; societies relating to various interests, such as the Old Nick Company; and various sporting clubs, including cricket, football, rugby union and soccer. The TUU also publishes the independent student media at the University of Tasmania, Togatus.https://tuu.com.au/publications/togatus/ Postgraduate students are represented by the TUU through the Tasmania University Union Postgraduate Council. The TUU Postgraduate Council was previously organised as the Tasmania University Postgraduate Association (TUPA). TUPA was established in 1982 to represent postgraduate research students on campus independently of the TUU. =Residential colleges and student accommodation= The University's Melville Street accommodation in the Hobart CBD The original Christ College Building in 1856 The university maintains a strong residential college system, as well as providing more independent apartment-style living. A key aspect of campus life, the residential colleges are equipped with modern facilities and host several events during the semesters. The colleges also maintain their respective student clubs, key in the passing of traditions from one cohort to the next. The southern colleges annually compete in a series of sporting events including Rugby, Australian Football, Cricket, Softball, Basketball, Table Tennis, Tennis and Soccer. The college system comprises Christ College, Jane Franklin Hall and St. John Fisher College in Hobart, and Kerslake Hall, Leprena and Investigator Hall in Launceston. The university accommodation system also includes the University Apartments and Mount Nelson Villas in Sandy Bay, Hobart Apartments and MidCity in the Hobart CBD, Endeavour Hall in Beauty Point for students of the Australian Maritime College, Newnham Apartments and Inveresk Apartments in Launceston, and West Park Apartments in Burnie. Two other residential colleges once existed in Hobart ‚Äì the non- denominational Hytten Hall (1959‚Äì1980) located on the Sandy Bay campus, and now used as a building for the Faculty of Education, and Ena Waite Women's College (1968‚Äì1980), operated by the Catholic Church and located in central Hobart, which amalgamated with St. John Fisher College. An off-campus student residence in Launceston, Clarence House, operated from 2004 to 2008. =Tasmania Scholarships= The Tasmania Scholarships program supports the university's commitment to offer students equal learning opportunity. It assists talented students, both locally, nationally and internationally. Industry contributions now make up the backbone of the Tasmania Scholarships program. The development and growth of this initiative into one of the most successful sponsored programs in the country is exceptional by any standard. Around 10 per cent of all domestic students at UTAS receive some sort of scholarship or financial assistance. Scholarships are also offered under the banner of the Jim Bacon Memorial Scholarship, funded by the Tasmanian Government. Notable people The University of Tasmania has produced many notable alumni, with graduates having held the offices of Governor of Tasmania, Justices of the High, Supreme, Federal courts, Premiers of Tasmania and elected leaders of other states and territories, Rhodes Scholars, the first female professor in Australia, ministers of foreign countries, Lord Mayors, academics, architects, historians, poets, philosophers, politicians, scientists, physicists, authors, industry leaders, defence force personnel, corporate leaders, community leaders, and artists. There are over 100,000 graduates of the University of Tasmania, spanning 104 countries.

In his style of practice, derived from the so-called New Burmese Method of U NƒÅrada, the meditator lives according to Buddhist morality as a prerequisite for meditation practice. Meditation itself entails the practice of satipa·π≠·π≠hƒÅna, the four foundations of mindfulness, anchoring the attention on the sensations of the rising and falling of the abdomen during breathing, observing carefully any other sensations or thoughts. This is coupled to reflection on the Buddhist teachings on causality, gaining insight into anicca, dukkha, and anattƒÅ. MahƒÅsƒ´ SayƒÅdaw was a questioner and final editor at the Sixth Buddhist Council on May 17, 1954. Biography MahƒÅsi SayƒÅdaw was born in 1904 in Seikkhun village in Upper Burma. He became a novice at age twelve, and was ordained at the age of twenty with the name Sobhana. Over the course of decades of study, he passed the rigorous series of government examinations in the TheravƒÅda Buddhist texts, gaining the newly introduced DhammƒÅcariya (dhamma teacher) degree in 1941. In 1931, U Sobhana took leave from teaching scriptural studies in Moulmein, South Burma, and went to nearby Thaton to practice intensive Vipassana meditation under Mingun Jetawun SayƒÅdaw (also rendered Mingun Jetavana SayƒÅdaw), also known as U NƒÅrada. This teacher had practiced in the remote Sagaing Hills of Upper Burma, under the guidance of Aletawya SayƒÅdaw, a student of the forest meditation master Thelon SayƒÅdaw. U SobhƒÅna first taught Vipassana meditation in his home village in 1938, at a monastery named for its massive drum 'MahƒÅsi'. He became known in the region as MahƒÅsi SayƒÅdaw. In 1947, the Prime Minister of Burma, U Nu, invited MahƒÅsi SayƒÅdaw to be resident teacher at a newly established meditation center in Yangon, which came to be called the MahƒÅsi SƒÅsana Yeiktha. MahƒÅsi SayƒÅdaw was a questioner and final editor at the Sixth Buddhist Council on May 17, 1954. He helped establish meditation centers all over Burma as well as in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Thailand, and by 1972 the centers under his guidance had trained more than 700,000 meditators. In 1979, he travelled to the West, holding retreats at newly founded centers such as the Insight Meditation Society (IMS) in Barre, Massachusetts, U.S. In addition, meditators came from all over the world to practice at his center in Yangon. When the MahƒÅsi SayƒÅdaw died on 14 August 1982 following a massive stroke, thousands of devotees braved the torrential monsoon rains to pay their last respects. Practice MahƒÅsi's method is based on the Satipa·π≠·π≠hƒÅna Sutta, which describes how one focuses attention on the breath, noticing how one breathes in and out. Practice begins with the preparatory stage, the practice of sƒ´la, morality, giving up worldly thoughts and desires.MahƒÅsi SayƒÅdaw, Manual of Insight, Chapter 5 The practitioner then engages in satipatthana by mindfulness of breathing. One pays attention to any arising mental or physical phenomenon, engaging in vitaka, noting or naming physical and mental phenomena (\\"breathing, breathing\\"), without engaging the phenomenon with further conceptual thinking.Mahasi Sayadaw, Practical Vipassana InstructionsBhante Bodhidhamma, Vipassana as taught by The Mahasi Sayadaw of Burma By noticing the arising of physical and mental phenomena, the meditator becomes aware how sense impressions arise from the contact between the senses and physical and mental phenomena, as described in the five skandhas and pa·π≠iccasamuppƒÅda. This noticing is accompanied by reflections on causation and other Buddhist teachings, leading to insight into anicca, dukkha, and anattƒÅ.PVI, p.22-27 When the three characteristics have been comprehended, reflection subdues, and the process of noticing accelerates, noting phenomena in general, without necessarily naming them.PVI, p.28 Notable students *Freda Bedi *G.

DFLA's position on abortion is in opposition to the current platform of the Democratic Party, which generally supports abortion rights. The group takes no position on most socio-economic issues or any foreign policy. They have drafted the Pregnant Women Support Act, a comprehensive package of federal legislation and policy proposals that supporters hope will reduce the number of abortions. They have an affiliated political action committee, DFLA PAC. They have proposed linking a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of gestation to increased support for pregnant women and mothers, such as paid medical leave and/or more support for affordable day care. History In 1999, Democrats for Life of America was founded to coordinate, at a national level, the efforts of anti-abortion Democrats. In the 1960s and 1970s, anti-abortion Democrats comprised a substantial portion of the party's membership in the United States Congress and the United States Senate. Some Democratic presidential and vice-presidential candidates ran for those offices as anti-abortion, including Hubert Humphrey and Sargent Shriver. Others were once anti-abortion before running, such as Ted Kennedy, Jesse Jackson, Bill Clinton and Al Gore. In the 1980s, the influence of anti-abortion advocates in the Democratic Party declined slowly but considerably. At the 1992 Democratic National Convention, anti-abortion Governor Robert Casey of Pennsylvania was allegedly \\"barred from addressing the Convention because of his antiabortion views\\". The official reason given by the Convention organizers was that Casey was not allowed to speak because he did not support the Democratic ticket. Kathy Taylor, a pro-abortion rights activist from Pennsylvania, instead addressed the convention. Taylor was a Republican who had worked for Casey's opponent in the previous gubernatorial election. Several anti-abortion Democrats did address the delegates in 1992, though they did not address the anti-abortion stance, and were not given prominent prime time slots. Governor Casey's son Bob Casey, Jr., also an anti-abortion Democrat, spoke during the 2008 Democratic National Convention. March for Life. Relationships As its name implies, DFLA aims to encompass members of the Democratic Party who are anti-abortion, cutting against the stereotype that Democrats are naturally pro-abortion rights and that those who are anti-abortion are naturally Republicans. =Relationship to the Democratic National Committee= Despite its strongly pro-abortion rights platform, party leadership has supported some anti-abortion Democrats, such as Bob Casey Jr.. =Relationship with other anti-abortion organizations= In 2010, the previously cordial relationship between DFLA and the anti-abortion movement at large was significantly damaged amid controversy over the March 2009 decision of anti-abortion congressman Bart Stupak (D-MI), co-author of the Stupak‚ÄìPitts Amendment who for months had led an effort to keep abortion funding out of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to strike a deal with President Barack Obama in which Stupak and many of his supporters would vote in favor of the bill and Obama would sign an executive order forbidding federal dollars from being used to fund abortions. Nearly all anti-abortion organizations who had previously supported Stupak (such as the National Right to Life Committee and the Susan B. Anthony List) decried the deal as a farce, saying the executive order lacked the legal force to prevent tax dollars from being used for abortions. Several anti-abortion Democrats were targeted for defeat by national anti- abortion groups over the PPACA vote, and the ranks of anti-abortion Democrats were cut roughly in half in the 2010 elections. Anti-abortion Democrats in recent elections =2004= In their 2005 book, Take It Back: Our Party, Our Country, Our Future, Paul Begala and James Carville praised Democrats For Life for their work that led to the Pregnant Women Support Act. In the book they say the legislation \\"is built around seventeen concrete policy proposals that would reduce the number of abortions.... We believe these proposals would do more to prevent abortions than all the speeches, all the marches and all the campaign ads the pro-lifers have used over the past 30 years.\\" They go on to call it \\"both good politics and, we think, good policy\\". The initiative has become legislation known as the Pregnant Women Support Act, which \\"has gained broad support and even has attracted some Republican backers\\". The Commonwealth of Virginia is the first state to pass a version of the PWSA. Organizations and Individuals who support the bill include the National Association of Evangelicals, Sojourners/Call to Renewal, U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Americans United for Life, National Council on Adoption, Life Education and Resource Network, Redeem the Vote, Care Net, Tony Campolo (founder of the Evangelical Association for the Promotion of Education), Joe Turnham (Chairman, Alabama Democratic Party), U.S. Senator Bob Casey, Jr., and actor Martin Sheen. =2010= The organization has endorsed Congresswoman Kathy Dahlkemper and Congressmen Jim Oberstar, Joe Donnelly, Steve Driehaus and many other anti-abortion Democrats for the 2010 midterm elections, and its PAC raised over $42,000 in 2010.Health vote haunts anti-abortion Democrats Of the four mentioned above, only Donnelly was successfully re-elected. Oberstar was defeated after 18 terms. Additionally, all four of the freshmen successfully endorsed by DFLA in 2008 were defeated for re-election in 2010 (see above). = 2018 = Representative Dan Lipinski, a long-time anti- abortion Democrat, from one of Illinois' Chicago-area House districts won his primary. In Pennsylvania, Representative Conor Lamb, who identifies as personally anti-abortion, won his special election for the 18th Congressional district. Republican House Speaker, Paul Ryan, referred to Lamb as anti- abortion when explaining the election outcome. Nevertheless, Lamb said this was his personal belief and that he's from \\"a Catholic background, (but) choice is the law of the land.‚Äù Three Democratic Senators, who self-identify as anti-abortion, had voted to ban abortion after 20 weeks and ran for re- election to the US Senate; Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, and Joe Manchin of West Virginia had all voted with most Republicans on the issue. Donnelly and Manchin had been endorsed by Democrats for Life in their re-election bids. On the afternoon of July 20, 2018, DLFA Executive Director Kristen Day hosted an event where anti-abortion Democrats from around the nation gathered for their first annual conference at a Radisson Hotel in Aurora, Colorado. Over eighteen individual speaking sessions were arranged over the course of three days. The keynote speaker on Friday evening was former U.S. Representative Bart Stupak (D-MI) who was instrumental in keeping abortion funding out of the Affordable Care Act in 2010.

Wire played competitive schools football and, aged 14, was captain of the Welsh national schoolboys' team. Although he was offered a trial at both Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal football clubs, back and knee problems brought his football career to an end. Wire took A-levels in politics and law. He later attended Portsmouth Polytechnic, but after several months transferred to the University of Wales Swansea, starting his course a year after Edwards. He graduated with a Lower Second-Class Honours degree in politics, which has led him to comment that he may have pursued a career in the diplomatic service or the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. =Career= Wire is a founding member of Manic Street Preachers and was originally rhythm guitarist but changed to playing the bass guitar after original bassist Flicker left the band. He co-wrote the band's lyrics with Richey Edwards between 1989 and 1995, taking over sole responsibility following Edwards's disappearance. Some of Edwards' lyrics were used on 1996's Everything Must Go album, making 1998's This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours the first album with lyrics by Wire alone. Wire usually plays Gibson Thunderbird, Rickenbacker, Fender Jazz and most recently Italia Maranello basses, one of which is a custom acoustic model made by request for the band's 2007 acoustic sessions. Nicky chose the pseudonym Wire because of his lanky, \\"wiry\\" frame (he is 6'3\\"). He often dons a dress or a skirt for his group's gigs although he has curtailed his flamboyance somewhat in recent years. Wire's cross- dressing dates back to his teens, when he would go to local pubs in Blackwood wearing a dress; he has, however, been keen to emphasise that he is not a transvestite. He puts his attraction to glam and women's clothes at least in part down to his very close relationship with his mother. Wire is notorious for his outspoken attitude and has been known to cause controversy in the press. He once stated during a 1992 gig, \\"In this season of goodwill, let‚Äôs pray that Michael Stipe goes the same way as Freddie Mercury pretty soon\\". However, he has since expressed regret for the remark; stating that it was misinterpreted and \\"didn't come out the way [he] wanted it to.\\" Wire has noted that his band has taken \\"inspiration from Queen,\\" Mercury's band, as well as being noted fans of R.E.M.'s earlier albums. In November 2007, he was recruited as Chair of the Advisory Board for the new commercial Xfm South Wales Radio Station. =Solo career= Nicky Wire on the Manics' \\"Past, Present and Future\\" tour On Christmas Day 2005, the Manics posted a solo track by Wire called \\"I Killed the Zeitgeist\\", available to download free for one day. In early May, the rumoured first single entitled \\"Break My Heart Slowly\\" from his d√©but solo album premi√®red on BBC Radio 6 Music with Phill Jupitus. Wire played an intimate solo gig at the Hay Festival on 5 June 2006. The setlist consisted of material from his forthcoming album. Also included was a short acoustic rendition of \\"Condemned to Rock 'N' Roll\\" from Manic Street Preachers' d√©but album Generation Terrorists. Speaking to NME.COM before the gig, Wire confirmed that he was currently working on a solo album and he'd already written 25 songs. On the following day, Wire released the free track \\"Daydreamer Eyes\\" on his new website. He released the single \\"The Shining Path\\" as an exclusive iTunes only download on 17 July. His solo album, entitled I Killed the Zeitgeist was released on 25 September, with the single \\"Break My Heart Slowly\\" released on 18 September. In an interview with New Musical Express in March 2020, that also confirmed work on a 2021 Manic Street Preachers album and a solo album by bandmate James Dean Bradfield, Wire announced that he was working on more solo content, joking that he would not have to put in much work to meet fan demand. Bradfield later reconfirmed this, likening their simultaneous solo work to when they did the same in 2006. Personal life Wire married his childhood sweetheart, Rachel, on 25 September 1993. He missed the band's appearance on Top of the Pops to promote \\"Roses in the Hospital\\" because of the honeymoon and was replaced on the day by a Manic Street Preachers roadie wearing a Minnie Mouse mask. The couple live in the Newport suburb of Allt-yr-yn with daughter Clara Enola (born 2002) and son Stanley McCarthey (2007). The family previously lived in a terrace house in the village of Wattsville, near Blackwood. Although he was annoyed when a British tabloid revealed that he lived there, printing a picture of his house with the number clearly visible, he later paid public tribute to his former home in the title of the track \\"Wattsville Blues,\\" on Know Your Enemy album. Wire follows the Welsh rugby union team, Whiteheads RFC and Dragons. He is also a fan of Warrington Wolves rugby league team, (who are nicknamed The Wire), as well as being a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur in football, with whom he turned down an offer of a trial as a teenager.

It is a unique lake that was created thousands of years ago when a massive landslide peeled from the 9,325-foot (2,842 m) Lake Mountain and dammed Poker Creek with debris. The lake's outlet flows below the surface through the natural dam and emerges from the mountain as a creek 1 mile (1.6 km) away. The mountainside scar from the landslide is still visible today. Lake Alice is the home of the only known pure lake strain of naturally reproducing Bonneville cutthroat trout caused by the isolation of the landslide preventing outside genetic influence. At one time the subspecies was thought to be extinct in Wyoming. The nearest city is Cokeville, Wyoming about 34 miles (55 km) to the southwest. Access to the lake requires traversing a winding 28-mile (45 km) dirt mountain road, and fording a creek with water as deep as 18 inches (0.5 m) in the spring time. A high clearance vehicle is recommended. The road ends at Hobble Creek campground and from there a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) hike up a moderately steep mountain trail is required to reach Lake Alice. Nine primitive tent campsites are available though camping is not restricted to a campsite. Multiple drownings have occurred at the lake which is named after a young girl who drowned in the early 1900s. http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsbdev3_042176.pdf The most recent drowning occurred on August 12, 2019.

Ichabod Crane walks home after an evening listening to ghost stories. Ichabod Crane, Respectfully Dedicated to Washington Irving. by William J. Wilgus; chromolithograph, c. 1856 The Headless Horseman Pursuing Ichabod Crane, by John Quidor, 1858 Will Rogers as Ichabod Crane and Lois Meredith as Katrina Van Tassel, in The Headless Horseman (1922) Sleepy Hollow, or Ichabod Crane and Katrina Van Tassel, 1868 Ichabod Crane is a fictional character and the protagonist in Washington Irving's short story \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\". Crane is portrayed, in the original work and in most adaptations, as a tall, lanky individual with a scarecrow affect. He is the local schoolmaster, and has a strong belief in all things supernatural, including the legend of the headless horseman. Crane eventually begins courting the heiress Katrina Van Tassel, a decision which angers Abraham \\"Brom Bones\\" Van Brunt, a local man who also wishes to marry Katrina. After supposedly proposing to Katrina, Crane is headed home alone at night when the headless horseman appears and chases the schoolmaster. Crane is never seen again.  Origin  Ichabod‚Äîmeaning \\"without glory\\"in Hebrew‚Äîcomes from the biblical name of the grandson of Eli the High Priest and son of Phinehas. Irving might have borrowed the name from that of Ichabod Crane, a colonel in the US Army during the War of 1812 whom he had met in 1814 in Sackets Harbor, New York. According to a notation by Irving and a certification written in long hand by Martin Van Buren, the 'pattern' (Van Buren's words) for the character of Ichabod Crane was based on the original Kinderhook schoolmaster named Jesse Merwin‚Äîborn in Connecticut‚Äîwhom Irving became friends with in Kinderhook, New York, in 1809. The two friends continued a pen-pal correspondence for thirty years. The Columbia County Historical Society (New York) owns the original Kinderhook Schoolhouse named after the Irving character based on Jesse Merwin, the town's first schoolteacher. The Kinderhook town school district (Ichabod Crane Central School District) is also named for the Irving character. It is claimed by many in Tarrytown that Samuel Youngs is the original from whom Irving drew his character of Ichabod Crane. Author Gary Denis asserts that while the character of Ichabod Crane is loosely based on Kinderhook Schoolmaster, Jesse Merwin, it may possibly include elements from Samuel Youngs' life.  Role in story  Irving's characters drive the story and are memorable because of his detail in describing each. He says of Ichabod Crane (the main character), 'He was tall, but exceedingly lank, with narrow shoulders, long arms and legs, hands that dangled a mile out of his sleeves, feet that might have served for shovels, and his whole frame most loosely hung together. His head was small, and flat at top, with huge ears, large green glassy eyes and a long snipe nose, so that it looked like a weather-cock perched upon his spindle neck, to tell which way the wind blew.' According to Irving, Ichabod looks like a goofy, old scarecrow who has escaped the cornfield. Ichabod Crane is a school teacher with very little money, and as a result, the ladies of the town take care to feed him in the evenings, during which he is happy to listen to their tales about supernatural events in the settlement. Ichabod is said to have carried a copy of Cotton Mather's History of New England Witchcraft, which he firmly believes in. He was a conscientious man, and ever bore in mind the golden maxim, \\"Spare the rod and spoil the child\\". Ichabod Crane's scholars certainly were not spoiled. He administered justice with discrimination rather than severity; taking the burden off the backs of the weak, and laying it on those of the strong. The revenue arising from his school was small, and would have been scarcely sufficient to furnish him with daily bread, for he was a huge feeder, and, though lank, had the dilating powers of an anaconda; but to help out his maintenance, he was, according to country custom in those parts, boarded and lodged at the houses of the farmers whose children he instructed. When school hours were over, he was even the companion and playmate of the larger boys; and on holiday afternoons would convoy some of the smaller ones home, who happened to have pretty sisters, or good housewives for mothers, noted for the comforts of the cupboard. With these he lived successively a week at a time, thus going the rounds of the neighbourhood, with all his worldly effects tied up in a cotton handkerchief. In addition to his other vocations, he was the singing-master of the neighbourhood, and picked up many bright shillings by instructing the young folks in psalmody. It was a matter of no little vanity to him on Sundays, to take his station in front of the church gallery, with a band of chosen singers; where, in his own mind, he completely carried away the psalm from the parson. His voice resounded far above all the rest of the Congregation. The schoolmaster was a man of some importance in the female circle of a rural neighbourhood; being considered a kind of idle, gentleman- like personage, of vastly superior taste and accomplishments to the rough country swains, and, indeed, inferior in learning only to the parson. He was peculiarly happy in the smiles of all the country damsels. How he would figure among them in the churchyard, between services on Sundays; gathering grapes for them from the wild vines that overran the surrounding trees; reciting for their amusement all the epitaphs on the tombstones; or sauntering, with a whole bevy of them, along the banks of the adjacent millpond; while the more bashful country bumpkins hung sheepishly back, envying his superior elegance and address. He was like a travelling gazette, carrying the whole budget of local gossip from house to house so that his appearance was always greeted with satisfaction. He was, moreover, esteemed by the women as a man of great erudition, for he had read several books quite through, and was a perfect master of Cotton Mather's History of New England Witchcraft, in which, by the way, he most firmly and potently believed. He took pleasure in reading old Mather's direful tales till dusk after school. Moreover, no supernatural story or superstition was hard for him to believe. Another of his sources of fearful pleasure was to pass long winter evenings with the old Dutch wives, as they sat spinning by the fire, with a row of apples roasting and spluttering along the hearth, and listen to their marvellous tales of ghosts and goblins, and haunted fields, and haunted brooks, and haunted bridges, and haunted houses, and particularly of the headless horseman, or Galloping Hessian of the Hollow, as they sometimes called him. He would delight them equally by his anecdotes of witchcraft, and of the direful omens and portentous sights and sounds in the air, which prevailed in the earlier times of Connecticut; and would frighten them woefully with speculations upon comets and shooting stars; and with the alarming fact that the world did absolutely turn round, and that they were half the time topsy-turvy! He used to think of ghosts and devils while passing through dim and ghastly glare of a snowy night and used to get scared. He would have passed a pleasant life of it, in despite of the Devil and all his works, if his path had not been crossed by a being that causes more perplexity to mortal man than ghosts, goblins, and the whole race of witches put together, and that was‚Äîa woman. Actually, Ichabod had a soft and foolish heart towards the opposite sex. A turning point in the story occurs when Ichabod becomes enamored of one Katrina Van Tassel, the daughter and only child of a wealthy farmer named Baltus Van Tassel, who pays little attention to his daughter other than to be proud of her merits when they are praised. On account of both of her beauty and her father's wealth, which he is eager to inherit, Ichabod begins to court Katrina, who seems to respond in kind. This attracts the attention of the town rowdy, Abraham \\"Brom Bones\\" Van Brunt, who also wants to marry Katrina and is challenged in this only by Ichabod. Despite Brom's efforts to humiliate or punish the schoolmaster, Ichabod remains steadfast, and neither contestant seems able to gain any advantage throughout this rivalry. Later, both men are invited to a harvest festival party at Van Tassel's where Ichabod's social skills far outshine Brom's. After the party breaks up, Ichabod remains behind for \\"a t√™te-√†-t√™te with the heiress\\", where it is supposed that he makes a proposal of marriage to Katrina but, according to the narrator, \\"Something, however ... must have gone wrong, for he certainly sallied forth, after no very great interval, with an air quite desolate and chapfallen\\", meaning that his proposal is refused, allegedly because her sole purpose in courting him was either to test or to increase Brom's desire for her. Therefore, Ichabod leaves the house \\"with the air of one who had been sacking a henroost, rather than a fair lady's heart\\". He finally becomes a victim of his own false superstition and belief. During his journey home, Ichabod encounters another traveller, who is eventually revealed to be the legendary Headless Horseman; the ghost of a Hessian soldier who was decapitated by a cannonball during the American Revolutionary War. Ichabod flees with the Headless Horseman pursuing him, eventually crossing a bridge near the Dutch burial ground. Because the ghost is incapable of crossing this bridge, Ichabod assumes that he is safe. However, before Ichabod can react, the Headless Horseman throws his own severed head at him, knocking him from the back of his own horse and sending him \\"tumbling headlong into the dust\\". The next morning, Ichabod's hat is found abandoned near the church-bell bridge and close beside it a shattered pumpkin. Ichabod is never seen in Sleepy Hollow again and is therefore presumed to have been spirited away by the Headless Horseman. Later, \\"an old farmer, who had been down to New York on a visit several years after, and from whom this account of the ghostly adventure was received\\" suggests that Ichabod had been frightened by both the Horseman and the anticipated anger of his (Ichabod's) current landlord into leaving the town forever, later to become \\"a justice of the ten pound court\\" in \\"a distant part of the country\\". Katrina marries Brom, who is said: \\"to look exceedingly knowing whenever the story of Ichabod was related, and always laughed heartily at the mention of the pumpkin\\". These events, \\"led some to suspect that he knew more about the matter than he chose to tell\\". Therefore, it can be assumed that Brom himself was the Horseman, whose legend he took advantage of to rid himself of his rival. Caleb Stegall suggests that \\"the most distinctive characteristic Irving gives Ichabod is that of a psalm-singer,\\" and that Ichabod Crane is the \\"most celebrated Covenanter in all of the literature.\\"  Adaptations in other media  *Will Rogers portrayed Crane in the 1922 silent film The Headless Horseman. *The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (1949), directed by James Algar, Clyde Geronimi, and Jack Kinney, produced by Walt Disney Productions, and packaged with a companion 30-minute short \\"Mr. Toad\\" based on Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows. Probably the best-known version, as it ran for years as part of the television Halloween special Disney's Halloween Treat and considered one of the truest adaptations of the Irving story. This animated interpretation features Bing Crosby as the narrator and sole voice actor of the entire 30-minute piece and extends both the role of Ichabod Crane to make his (Crane's) singing that of a crooner instead of the nasal psalmodist described in the story and that of Brom Bones to include the latter as singer of the song about the Horseman's legend. *A 1980 made-for-television movie The Legend of Sleepy Hollow was filmed on NBC, in Utah. It starred Jeff Goldblum as Ichabod Crane, directed by Henning Schellerup, produced by James L. Conway, and executive producer Charles Sellier. In this version, the story ends with Ichabod arriving at Katrina's house and the Headless Horseman returns to the dark forest after having dealt with an imposter. *Ed Begley, Jr. portrayed Ichabod Crane in a 1985 adaptation by Lan O'Kun for Shelley Duvall's Tall Tales and Legends, directed by Edd Griles, which also starred Beverly D'Angelo as Katrina, Tim Thomerson as Brom and Charles Durning as narrator Doffue van Tassel, Katrina's uncle. This version definitively identifies Brom as the Headless Horseman who chases Ichabod, but also adds a twist ending that takes place on the night after Halloween. *Crane appeared as a ghost in The Tale of the Midnight Ride which was a third-season episode of Nickelodeon's Are You Afraid of the Dark?. *Wishbone portrayed this character in a two-part Halloween episode of the PBS television series of the same name in 1997. *Constable Ichabod Crane serves as the protagonist in the 1999 film adaptation of Sleepy Hollow, directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp. In this interpretation, he is a New York City policeman with an interest in Forensic science sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of grisly murders to prove the merits of his style of the investigation after he argues against the police's current methods. As in the original story, his horse is named Gunpowder. Ichabod's most notable traits in the movie include an ahead-of-his-time liking for post-mortem examinations, deduction, and scientific methods, as well as his being very quirky, skittish, and being disturbed by death and blood, despite his occupation. His backstory is also explored: when he was seven his mother, an \\"innocent child of Nature\\" was \\"murdered to save her soul\\" by his father, \\"a Bible black tyrant behind a mask of righteousness\\" which led to a loss of faith for him. It is Ichabod who finally releases the Hessian Headless Horseman (Christopher Walken) from the control of Lady van Tassel (Miranda Richardson), whom the Horseman takes to Hell with him. Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) is seen at the end of the movie going back to New York with Ichabod, along with a boy who helped him in the investigation. Brom Bones (Casper Van Dien), who at one point does disguise himself as the Horseman and throws a pumpkin at Ichabod, is killed by the real Horseman halfway in the film. *In 1999, a telefilm entitled The Legend of Sleepy Hollow aired on Odyssey starring Brent Carver as Ichabod Crane. It was filmed in Montreal. *The 1999 computer animated FOX TV special The Night of the Headless Horseman featured William H. Macy as the voice of Crane, Tia Carrere as the voice of Katrina, Mark Hamill as the voice of van Ripper and Clancy Brown as the voice of the Hessian Trooper who becomes the Horseman. This version has an ending that reveals that Brom (voiced by Luke Perry) had made a \\"Devil's bargain\\" with the Horseman that he was forced to fulfill thirty years later *In the HBO TV Series The Sopranos (Season 5 Episode 10) aired March 7 to June 6, 2004, Tony Soprano‚Äôs cousin Tony Blundetto played by Steve Buscemi, tells Chris Moltisanti, played by Michael Imperioli, that people used to call him Ichabod Crane. *The 2004 TV movie The Hollow centers on a high school student named Ian Cranston (portrayed by Kevin Zegers), a descendant of Ichabod Crane. *Tom Mison plays Crane in Sleepy Hollow (2013), an American supernatural/police drama television series. The series is considered a \\"modern-day retelling\\" with Crane being a former professor of history at Oxford University prior to the American Revolution, he came to America with the British before switching sides and becoming a spy for the Colonials. Having beheaded the Horseman in 1781, he was brought back to life in modern times with the Horseman due to their blood mixing when they died. This version of Crane also appears in the 2015 Halloween episode of the TV series Bones. Other mentions and references to the Sleepy Hollow TV series exists throughout the episode. *Ichabod Crane is also featured in the 2013 episodic video game, The Wolf Among Us, developed and produced by Telltale Games. In the game, Crane (voiced by Roger L. Jackson) is the deputy mayor of Fabletown, a secret community of magical, fairytale beings who were exiled from their Homelands centuries ago and forced to live in the world of mundane humans. In episodes 2 through three, Crane was revealed to have been soliciting prostitutes and using a magic spell to make them look like his assistant Snow White; Sheriff Bigby Wolf and Snow arrest Crane for this and embezzling Fabletown's money to pay for them, but Crane is then kidnapped by the minions of the Crooked Man, the crime lord Crane owes money to.

Tommy Atkins (often just Tommy) is slang for a common soldier in the British Army. It was certainly well established during the nineteenth century, but is particularly associated with the First World War. It can be used as a term of reference, or as a form of address. German soldiers would call out to \\"Tommy\\" across no man's land if they wished to speak to a British soldier. French and Commonwealth troops would also call British soldiers \\"Tommies\\". In more recent times, the term Tommy Atkins has been used less frequently, although the name \\"Tom\\" is occasionally still heard; private soldiers in the British Army's Parachute Regiment are still referred to as \\"Toms\\". Etymology 51st Division, seated with a large doll in his arms, taken during the German offensive in Lys, 13 April 1918 Tommy Atkins or Thomas Atkins has been used as a generic name for a common British soldier for many years. The origin of the term is a subject of debate, but it is known to have been used as early as 1743. A letter sent from Jamaica about a mutiny amongst the troops says \\"except for those from N. America ye Marines and Tommy Atkins behaved splendidly\\".Laffin, John (2003). Tommy Atkins: The Story of the English Soldier, The History Press Ltd. p. vii. . Quoted from Soldier Magazine, April 1949. A common belief is that the name was chosen by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington after having been inspired by the bravery of a soldier at the Battle of Boxtel in 1794 during the Flanders Campaign. After a fierce engagement, the Duke, in command of the 33rd Regiment of Foot, spotted the best man-at-arms in the regiment, Private Thomas Atkins, terribly wounded. The private said \\"It's all right, sir. It's all in a day's work\\" and died shortly after.Johnson, Ben. \\"The British Tommy, Tommy Atkins\\", Historic UK According to the Imperial War Museum, this theory has Wellington choosing the name in 1843. According to J. H. Leslie, writing in Notes and Queries in 1912, \\"Tommy Atkins\\" was chosen as a generic name by the War Office in 1815, in every sample infantry form in the Soldiers Account Book, signing with a mark. The Cavalry form had Trumpeter William Jones and Sergeant John Thomas, though they did not use a mark. Leslie observes the same name in the 1837 King's Regulations, pages 204 and 210, and later editions. Leslie comments that this disproves the anecdote about the Duke of Wellington selecting the name in 1843. Richard Holmes, in the prologue to his 2005 book, Tommy, states that: The Oxford English Dictionary states its origin as \\"arising out of the casual use of this name in the specimen forms given in the official regulations from 1815 onward\\"; the citation references Collection of Orders, Regulations, etc., pp. 75‚Äì87, published by the War Office, 31 August 1815. The name is used for an exemplary cavalry and infantry soldier; other names used included William Jones and John Thomas. Thomas Atkins continued to be used in the Soldier's Account Book until the early 20th century.Edward Fraser and John Gibbons (1925) Soldier and sailor words and phrases; including slang of the trenches and the air force; British and American war-words and service terms and expressions in every-day use; nicknames, sobriquets, and titles of regiments, with their origins; the battle-honours of the Great War awarded to the British Army Routledge, London (p. 287) A further suggestion was given in 1900 by an army chaplain named Reverend E. J. Hardy. He wrote of an incident during the Sepoy Rebellion in 1857. When most of the Europeans in Lucknow were fleeing to the British Residency for protection, a private of the 32nd Regiment of Foot remained on duty at an outpost. Despite the pleas of his comrades, he insisted that he must remain at his post. He was killed at his post, and the Reverend Hardy wrote that \\"His name happened to be Tommy Atkins and so, throughout the Mutiny Campaign, when a daring deed was done, the doer was said to be 'a regular Tommy Atkins'\\". Popular references Front cover of sheet music, pub 1893, for song \\"Private Tommy Atkins\\" composed by Samuel Potter (1851‚Äì1934) and Henry Hamilton (c. 1854 ‚Äì 1918). Signed by baritone C. Hayden Coffin. Rudyard Kipling published the poem \\"Tommy\\" (part of the Barrack-Room Ballads, which were dedicated \\"To T.A.\\") in 1892. In reply, William McGonagall wrote \\"Lines in Praise of Tommy Atkins\\" in 1898, which was an attack on what McGonagall saw as the disparaging portrayal of Tommy in Kipling's poem. In 1893, for the musical play A Gaiety Girl, Henry Hamilton (lyrics) and Samuel Potter (music) wrote the song Private Tommy Atkins for the baritone C. Hayden Coffin. It was immediately published by Willcocks & Co. Ltd. in London and published by T. B. Harms & Co. in New York the next year. The song was also reintroduced into later performances of San Toy for Hayden Coffin. He recalled singing it on Ladysmith Night (1 March 1900) where \\"the audience were roused to such a pitch of enthusiasm, that they rose to their feet, and commenced to shower money on to the stage\\". Following the British defeat by the Boers at the Battle of Magersfontein in December 1899, Private Smith of the Black Watch wrote the following poem: \\"Tommy cooker\\" was a nickname for a British soldier's portable stove, which was fuelled by something referred to as solidified alcohol, making it smokeless though very inefficient.Weeks, Alan (2009), Tea, Rum and Fags: Sustaining Tommy 1914‚Äì18, The History Press (Chapter 6) In the 1995 film The Indian in the Cupboard, Omri brings a tiny British toy soldier to life and the soldier says his name is 'Tommy Atkins.' Other nicknames Present day English soldiers are often referred to as 'Toms' or just 'Tom' (the Scots equivalent being 'Jock'). Outside the services soldiers are generally known as 'Squaddies' by the British popular press. The British Army magazine Soldier has a regular cartoon strip, 'Tom', featuring the everyday life of a British soldier. Junior officers in the army are generally known as 'Ruperts' by the other ranks. This nickname is believed to be derived from the children's comic book character Rupert Bear who epitomises traditional public school values (see Inside the British Army by Antony Beevor ) The term 'Pongo' or 'Perce' is often used by Sailors and Royal Marines to refer to soldiers. It is considered complimentary.  The last Tommy  On 25 July 2009, the death of the last \\"Tommy\\" from the First World War, Harry Patch (at 111 the oldest man in the United Kingdom and also in Europe), left Claude Choules as the last serviceman of the British forces in the war. There was a growing opinion that the passing of the last of them should be marked in an appropriate manner. This was the subject of a cross-party campaign led by the politician Iain Duncan Smith. It was originally proposed that the last veteran to die should be given a state funeral. This met with opposition from the veterans themselves, few of whom wanted to be singled out in this way.Staff. Veteran state funeral 'difficult', BBC, 18 April 2006 On 27 June 2006, it was decided that a service at Westminster Abbey would be held upon the death of the last veteran.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5120358.stm However, the funeral of Harry Patch took place at Wells Cathedral, close to his home.

By the time it entered commercial service in 1940, many airlines were canceling orders for aircraft. Consequently, only five civilian DC-5s were built. With the Douglas Aircraft Company already converting to World War II military production, the DC-5 was soon overtaken by world events, although a limited number of military variants were produced. Design and development A Douglas DC-5, circa 1939 The DC-5 was developed in 1938 as a 16-22 seat civilian airliner, designed to use either Pratt & Whitney R-1690 Hornet or Wright R-1820 Cyclone radial engines.Delta 1993, p. 14. It was the first airliner to combine shoulder wings and tricycle landing gear, a configuration that is still common in turboprop airliners and military transport aircraft, although the modern versions are actually high wing, as the structure sits atop the fuselage shell rather than intersecting a significant segment.Delta 1993, p. 15. The tricycle landing gear was innovative for transport airplanes. It provided better ground handling and better ground visibility for the pilots. The fuselage was about two feet above the ground, so loading of passengers and cargo was easier than aircraft with the then-standard conventional landing gear.Juptner 1994, p. 106 A very early design change was the addition of a 15-degree dihedral to the horizontal tail group to negate a hint of an aeroelasticity problem. The dorsal strake, introduced in minimal form and expanded to full growth on the Boeing 307, is also well developed on the DC-5. Another significant modification was adding exhaust stacks to the engine nacelles, which was retroactively incorporated after the series entered production.Delta 1993, pp. 15‚Äì16. An unusual optical trick was applied to the prototype. The top of the vertical stabilizer and the outline of the engine nacelles were painted a darker color following the aircraft's contour, making the tail and engines appear somewhat smaller and the aircraft sleeker. Prior to the US entry into World War II, one prototype and four production aircraft were built. Operational history US DC-5 transport aircraft carrying supplies from the Australian mainland to Allied troops in Port Moresby, New Guinea, August 1942 The prototype DC-5, Douglas serial 411, was built at El Segundo, California with 1,000 hp Wright R-1820-44 Cyclone engines. The aircraft made its first flight on February 20, 1939 with Carl Cover at the controls. This sole prototype (in 1940 configured with just eight seats) became the personal aircraft of William Boeing, who named it Rover. It was later impressed into the US Navy and converted for military use as an R3D-3 variant in February 1942. The first customer for the type was KNILM of The Netherlands Antilles (with no affiliations with KLM despite the head offices in Amsterdam). A US domestic carrier, Pennsylvania Central (later renamed Capital Airlines), ordered six and SCADTA, (Sociedad Colombo-Alemana de Transportes A√©reos), ancestor of today's Avianca in Colombia, another two. The four aircraft sold to KNILM were used in the Caribbean. When Douglas factories went into war production, DC-5 production was curtailed to build additional SBD Dauntless dive bombers for the United States Navy (USN) and United States Marine Corps (USMC) and only KLM received the high-winged airliner. A dozen DC-5s were completed. The first two initially flew between Paramaribo in Surinam (now Suriname) and Cura√ßao in the Dutch colonial territory of the same name, and the other two operated in the Dutch East Indies for KNILM from Batavia (now Jakarta, Indonesia); the first pair were later transferred to KNILM. Of these four aircraft, three were used for the 1942 evacuation of civilians from Java to Australia; the fourth was damaged in an air strike by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force at Batavia Kemajoran Airport on February 9, 1942 and abandoned. Japanese forces captured it, and subsequently repaired and tested it in Japan during 1943. This DC-5, painted in camouflage with Japanese Imperial Army Air Force markings, was later used as a transport in the Japanese Home Islands. The captured ex-KNILM DC-5 in service with the Japanese Imperial Army Air Force The three remaining aircraft made their way safely to Australia where they were sold to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and operated for the Allied Directorate of Air Transport (ADAT). Two were destroyed by the end of 1942, the other was transferred to Australian National Airways (ANA), which operated it throughout the war on behalf of ADAT. In 1944 the USAAF retroactively designated the three aircraft C-110 for administrative purposes. In 1939, the USN ordered seven aircraft. Three were delivered as R3D-1s, the first of which crashed before delivery. The remaining four were R3D-2s for the USMC and were equipped with 1,015 hp R-1820-44 engines, a large cargo hold, and 22 seats for paratroopers.Verstappen, Harrie. \\"Douglas DC-5: 'The Forgotten Douglas'.\\" Curassow: The Dutch Caribbean island of Cura√ßao. via vrcurassow.com, September 4, 2001. Retrieved: June 6, 2010. After World War II, production of the DC-5 was not resumed because of the abundance of surplus C-47 aircraft released into civil service and converted to DC-3s. In 1948, the last surviving DC-5 was sold by Australian National Airways to another Australian airline, which smuggled it to Israel for military use. The aircraft arrived at Haifa in May 1948, and from there it went to Sde Dov, where its markings were removed and the name \\"Yankee Pasha ‚Äì The Bagel Lancer\\" was crudely painted on the nose by hand. The aircraft joined 103 Squadron at Ramat David Airbase. Because Israel was in the midst of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, it was occasionally used as a bomber as well as flying transport missions. On bomber missions the aft loading door was removed and bombs were rolled out of the opening \\"by a judicious shove from a crewman's foot.\\"Delta 1993, p. 65. The operational record of the aircraft is in dispute as authoritative sources do not verify its combat service. When the war ended and 103 Squadron moved, the DC-5 was left behind at Ramat David.Norton 2004, p. 109. It eventually found its way to a technical school where it was used extensively as a ground instruction airframe at Haifa Airport. When it was no longer serviceable due to a lack of spares, the airframe was stripped of its engines and instruments and the last DC-5 was reduced to scrap in Israel sometime after 1955.Delta 1993, pp. 64‚Äì65.

Established in 1977, Anglo-Chinese Junior College is the junior college arm of the Anglo-Chinese School family of Methodist schools in Singapore. History The history of the school dates back to 1913 when Reverend William Fitzjames Oldham saw the need for the provision of pre-university education for Anglo-Chinese School boys. As a result, the Anglo-Chinese College building project and the fund-raising initiative were started by Reverend J S Nagle, who started negotiations with the British colonial government about setting up a college to prepare students for British university education. The proposal was turned down by the government, who decided in favour of establishing Raffles College to commemorate the centenary of the founding of Singapore.Earnest Lau & Peter Teo, The ACS Story, Concordia Communications, 2003. = Establishment of Anglo-Chinese Junior College = In 1970 the ACS Board of Governors submitted their recommendations for a junior college to the Singapore government. A 6-hectare site at Rochester Park on a 30-year lease was given for the construction of the college. Anglo-Chinese Junior College thus became the fifth junior college to be established in line with the Ministry of Education's policy on pre-university education, equivalent to a British Sixth- form college, welcoming 968 students in Pre-U 1 and Pre-U 2, on 3 January 1977. To start with, it was an all-male institution. Its main complex was equipped with three lecture theatres, a library, the Tan Chin Tuan Auditorium and eight laboratories. The Shaw Sports Complex housed a 400-metre bitumen track, tennis, volleyball, basketball and sepak takraw courts. Since then, more facilities have been added to the college, with an extension to the original block, and refurbishment in the 1980s. School identity and culture Anglo-Chinese Junior College is a Methodist institution committed to an all-rounded education based on Christian principles and consciousness of others, self and God. = Corporal punishment = The long-standing ACS \\"family tradition\\" of corporal punishment - using caning to discipline misbehaving male students - was adopted by Anglo-Chinese Junior College in initial years. However, ACJC practice was to deliver the strokes privately in the principal's room, whereas canings at ACS were administered in front of the student body.Chee Keng Lim, in Development of Education in Singapore , National Archives of Singapore No 1425. In one case in 1987, seven ACJC students were caned for stealing audio equipment from the college. This form of punishment is no longer used in ACJC. =Fun-O-Rama= Fun-O-Rama XIX This biennial fundraiser is a funfair, where students and teachers set up booths for games or for the sale of food and memorabilia. Attractions include the haunted houses and the dunking station in which prominent members of the student body and the faculty participate. Alumni of the school tend to be the largest supporters of the event. The Fun-O-Rama involves the entire school and its alumni (as well as the entire ACS family), and the funds it has generated over the years have helped the college build a sports complex, as well as giving the entire premises a facelift, including new extensions and buildings. Besides the primary aim of raising funds, Fun-O-Rama helps bond the classes as they embark on their fund-raising projects. Fun-O-Rama was held on 29 March 2008, 27 March 2010, 24 March 2012, 2 April 2016, and 25 March 2018. Due to COVID-19, the Fun-o-Rama XXV which was initially planned to be held on 28 March 2020 was postponed until further notice. College facilities Aerial view of ACJC =Phase 1= In 1989 the first physical expansion of the college was conducted, costing SGD 3.5 million. The project was proposed in 1986 and approved by the Ministry of Education three years later. The extension included a new four-storey Library Block to contain the Oldham Library on two levels, two lecture theatres and two micro-computer laboratories. A multi- purpose void deck was built under the extension, providing additional physical space for future events such as the Fun-O-Rama carnival. A brand new 8-lane 400m track and soccer field with floodlighting capacity was also included. This phase was completed in 1991. =Phase 2= 1 March 1992 on Founder's Day marked the start of construction for the ACJC Sports Complex. The Complex contains two swimming pools, a gymnasium, badminton courts and billiard facilities. A multi-purpose hall was also built in the complex, together with a lounge, dance studios, and a Heritage Room where trophies and memorabilia are showcased. The Complex also houses a cafe on the pool deck. Funds for this were raised through the Fun-O-Rama and other carnivals, to the tune of SGD 500,000. =Phase 3= (From left to right) Oldham Wing, Library Block and Viewing Gallery. The main 7-storey building is in the background, behind the Gallery. After 20 years of housing ACJC's main lecture theatres, auditorium, staff room and classrooms, the main 7-storey building was in need of extensive renovation. There was also a need for the college to be in line with MOE's latest specifications, namely in the provision of IT-enabled facilities. In 1999, the College Upgrading Project was started at a total cost of SGD 21 million. The main block was refurbished and a 600-seat lecture theatre and viewing gallery built, with a concourse linking it to the lobby of the building. An Oldham Wing and covered walkways to all parts of the campus were built. This phase was completed by December 2002. The Anglo-Chinese Junior College for Performing Arts is the centrepiece of the performing arts programmes at ACJC. Commissioned in May 2008, it hosts a fully equipped theatre, a black box, a dance studio and other places for the performing arts. The CPA is home to many of the College's musical and theatrical productions, and the facilities are also available for use by the community. Achievements =Performing arts= Choir The ACJC Choir is the four-time winner of the Singapore Youth Festival Choir of the Year award (1997, 1995, 1993, 1989) and holder of the Best Junior College Choir title (2003, 2001, 1997, 1995). In 2005 the choir was awarded the Gold with Honours award in the Singapore Youth Festival, giving a near-monopoly of the nation's highest choral awards from 1989 to 2005. The Choir achieved the Gold award at the 2007 SYF Central Judging and the Gold with Honours awards at the 2009 and 2011 SYF Judging. The Choir participates in overseas competitions and tours. It first gained international exposure on a choral tour to Japan in 1989. Since then it has toured South Korea (1990) and the United States (1993), where it performed at the headquarters of the United Nations and the White House. The Choir was invited by the International Federation for Choral Music to perform at the 4th World Symposium on Choral Music in Sydney, Australia in 1996. It remains the only Singaporean choir to have been invited to the event. Since 1997 the Choir has won international competitions in Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. In 2006 the ACJC Choir competed at the Llangollen International Eisteddfod60th Llangollen International Eisteddfod in Wales and came second in the Youth Category and first in the Mixed Category. In June 2008 the ACJC Choir emerged as the only choir with three Gold medals at the 3rd Festa Choralis International Choir Competition in Bratislava, Slovakia. The only Asian choir at the competition, it competed alongside choirs from Poland, Great Britain, the Czech Republic, Russia and Slovakia in the Mixed Choir (Adult), Youth Choir (up to 19 years old) and Folk Song Categories. In all three categories, the ACJC Choir won gold medals with top marks and was the only choir in the competition to whom the adjudicators awarded a perfect score of 100 points. The Choir organises the annual concert An Evening With Friends, and performs regularly at community and ministerial events. Drama ACSian Theatre has been active in the performing arts scene, and has put up numerous plays and productions for the college and at competitions. As early as 1985, productions such as Billy Liar and The Hound of the Baskervilles were staged. Some productions to date include Amadeus, The Crucible, The Joy Luck Club, Grease, Fame and Camelot. Recent productions include West Side Story (2007), Pride and Prejudice (2008) and The Odyssey (2009). ACSian Theatre has also garnered several Gold awards at the SYF Central Judging, including several Play of the Year titles. Its most recent achievement at the SYF Central Judging is an accomplishment in 2018. Dance The ACJC Dance Society achieved its first Gold with Honours award at the Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging Competition 2007 with the item \\"Hiya Bob! A Tribute To Fosse\\". This featured many works of Bob Fosse, such as \\"Cabaret\\" and \\"Sing Sing Sing!\\". The ACJC Dance Society has also performed at many events such as the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in 2007. The society also stages an annual performance \\"Restless\\", first performed in 2003. Guitar Ensemble The ACJC Guitar Ensemble, since its inception in 2007, has risen quickly to be a prominent CCA in the college. It has garnered several awards at the Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging (before 2012) and Art Presentations (from 2013): Gold with Honours (2007), Gold (2009), Silver (2011) and a Certificate of Distinction (2013).

Spann was the first American killed in combat during the United States invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. He died at the Qala-i-Jangi fortress in a Taliban prisoner uprising. Early life Johnny Micheal Spann was from the small town of Winfield, Alabama, the son of a real estate agent and his wife. Spann graduated in 1987 from Winfield City High School, where he played football. At 17, he earned his private pilot license and later became a certified rescue diver and parachutist. Military service In December 1991, while attending Auburn University, he joined the Marine Corps Reserve. After graduating from Auburn with a Bachelor of Science degree in Criminal Justice/Law Enforcement in 1992, Spann attended the Marines' Officer Candidates School at Quantico, Virginia. He had originally wanted to go into aviation, but became a field artillery officer and eventually served with the elite 2nd Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company.Mahoney, Richard D.

Earlier that day, he and David Tyson, another SAD officer, questioned John Walker Lindh, an American citizen, and other prisoners. Officials recovered his body after Afghan Northern Alliance troops, backed by U.S. air strikes, US Army Special Forces and British Special Boat Service members, quelled the uprising. Some sources say that he fought with his AK-47 until it ran out of ammunition, then drew his pistol until it, too, emptied, then resorted to hand-to-hand combat before finally being overcome. In a news report by Time published shortly after the events reports, it is stated that Spann fought only with his pistol, killing three attackers before being overwhelmed by the more numerous prisoners. His colleague, Dave \\"Dawson\\" Tyson, an Uzbek-language specialist, opened fire with the AK-47 before running away. Time reported shortly after the events: =Memorial= Spann's headstone in Arlington National Cemetery. Spann is memorialized with a star on the CIA Memorial Wall at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia that commemorates individuals who died in the line of duty. Spann was posthumously awarded the Intelligence Star and the Exceptional Service Medallion. Because the Intelligence Star is considered the equivalent of the U.S. military's Silver Star, Spann was approved for burial in Arlington National Cemetery.Bob Woodward, Bush At War, Simon and Schuester, 2002, page 317 Spann is buried in section 34 at Arlington National Cemetery.

The largest pulmonary veins are the four main pulmonary veins, two from each lung that drain into the left atrium of the heart. The pulmonary veins are part of the pulmonary circulation. Structure Two main pulmonary veins emerge from each lung hilum, receiving blood from three or four bronchial veins apiece and draining into the left atrium. An inferior and superior main vein drains each lung, so there are four main veins in total. At the root of the lung, the right superior pulmonary vein lies in front of and a little below the pulmonary artery; the inferior is situated at the lowest part of the lung hilum. Behind the pulmonary artery is the bronchus. The right main pulmonary veins (contains oxygenated blood) pass behind the right atrium and superior vena cava; the left in front of the descending thoracic aorta. =Variation= Occasionally the three lobar veins on the right side remain separate, and not infrequently the two left lobar veins end by a common opening into the left atrium. Therefore, the number of pulmonary veins opening into the left atrium can vary between three and five in the healthy population. The two left lobar veins may be united as a single pulmonary vein in about 25% of people; the two right veins may be united in about 3%. Function The pulmonary veins play an essential role in respiration, by receiving blood that has been oxygenated in the alveoli and returning it to the left atrium. Clinical significance As part of the pulmonary circulation they carry oxygenated blood back to the heart, as opposed to the veins of the systemic circulation which carry deoxygenated blood. A rare genetic defect of the pulmonary veins can cause them to drain into the pulmonary circulation in whole or in part, this is known as a total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (or drainage), or partial anomalous pulmonary connection, respectively.

Whilst predominantly considered a single breed, it is bred in four distinct varieties based on coat type and colour; the long-haired black Groenendael, the rough- haired fawn Laekenois, the short-haired fawn Malinois, and the long-haired fawn Tervuren. Some kennel clubs consider the four varieties to be separate breeds. The breed descends from a common type of shepherd dog found throughout Western Europe that includes such modern breeds as the Bouvier des Ardennes, Dutch Shepherd and German Shepherd. A common sight in the service of Belgian shepherds for centuries, it was not until the end of the 19th-century that a breed club was formed and attempts were made to standardise the breed. In addition to its historical role as a herding dog, Belgian Shepherds have been used as assistance dogs, companion dogs, detection dogs, guard dogs, guide dogs, police dogs, and search and rescue dogs. The breed has a long history of being used by military forces, serving in both World Wars they continue to be used by a number of militaries in a variety of roles to this day. Description =Appearance= The Belgian Shepherd is a medium sized athletic breed with a body built for endurance, they typically stand between with bitches being on average shorter than dogs, they usually weigh between ; the breed standard states the ideal height is for dogs and for bitches. The breed has a long, slender head with triangular, erect ears that are rounded at the base, and a long, narrow but balanced muzzle, according to the breed standard a dog that stands 62 centimetres at the withers should have head that is long and a muzzle approximately half that length. The breed's body is muscular but not overly heavy; the body's length from shoulder to haunches is approximately the same as their height at the withers, proportionally slightly longer in bitches; they have a straight topline and their belly is neither low slung nor overly high like that of a sighthound. The breed's chest is deep but not overly broad; their neck is muscular, widening at the shoulders with a slight arch at the nape; their tail is strong and of medium-length and curves upwards slightly at the level of their knee; their forelegs are straight and well boned, their hind legs are muscular and very powerful, none of the legs are overly heavy. The four varieties vary principally in their coat types and colours, the breed standard describes three coat varieties; long-haired, short-haired and rough-haired. Long-haired coated dogs have a long, smooth coat with short hair on their faces, ears and legs although there is long feathering on the rear of the legs, they have an abundant main on their neck and chest, particularly long hair on the rear of their thighs and a bushy tail that forms a plume. Short-haired coated dogs have particularly short hair on the faces, ears and lower portion of their legs, short over the rest of the body and slightly longer on the neck and tail. Rough-haired coated dogs have a coat that is rough, dry and approximately long over the body, they have shorter hair on the top of the muzzle and legs and, unlike the other coat types, they have long hair on the face and muzzle. The Groenendael variety is long-haired, it has a solid black double coat, the outer coat is straight and particularly long around the shoulders, neck and chest; they have short hair on the face, and well feathered legs and tail. The Laekenois variety is rough- coated, its coat is fawn in colour with discreet black overlay and is harsh, dry and normally slightly tangled in appearance; it has a bristled, feathered muzzle and limited feathering on the legs and tail. According to the breed standard, black overlay means the tips of the hair are black but not in patches or stripes such as brindle. The Malinois variety is short-haired, it is fawn in colour with black overlay, with a charcoal coloured face and extremities. The Tervuren variety is long-haired like the Groenendael, its double coat is typically fawn in colour with black overlay and with black extremities, although grey with black is known; it has a ruff of long hair around the neck and feathering on the legs. =Temperament= Belgian Shepherds are known to be highly intelligent, alert and sensitive; they are typically highly trainable, vigilant and hard-working with a strong guarding instinct making them protective of property and family, and very well suited for service with security services. The Groenendael and Tervueren varieties have a reputation for occasionally being snappy, making them less suitable as companion dogs for children; the Laekenois whilst considered very good with children can occasionally be troublesome with other dogs. The Belgian Shepherd responds well to training and responds very well to firm and understanding training; they require training from an early age, particularly the Laekenois which can have a tendency to try to dominate a weaker willed master. The breed is very active, particularly the Malinois which may reflect its continued breeding for security roles, and they all require exercise; the breed adapts well to living indoors although the Malinois is least suited to these environs. History Belgian Shepherds descend from a common type of herding dog as similar Western European breeds like the Bouvier des Ardennes, Dutch Shepherd and German Shepherd, and for centuries they were used by Belgian shepherds for this task. Unlike in other European countries where throughout the 19th-century shepherd breeds were standardised and breeders made efforts to perpetuate their breeds, by the end of the century the Belgian Shepherd was becoming obsolete and was at danger of extinction. In 1891 the Club de Chien Berger Belge was formed with the purpose of saving the type and a team led by Professor Adolphe Reul of the Cureghem Veterinary School conducted a field survey of the type. As the Belgian Shepherd had for centuries been bred for working ability with little consideration given to form, Professor Reul found the type to vary greatly in appearance. As a part of their work, Professor Reul's team assembled 117 specimens and began the process of standardising them into distinct varieties. Classifying them as a single breed, initially Professor Reul's team divided the breed into six different varieties based on coat type and colour, between 1892 when the first breed standard was drafted and 1956, as many eight varieties and as few as two varieties were recognised by either the Club de Chien Berger Belge or the Soci√©t√© Royale Saint-Hubert. In 1905 it was decided that interbreeding between the different varieties should be forbidden, but the disruptions caused by the First World War resulted in a decline in breed numbers so in 1920 it was decided matings between the varieties should be allowed in order to preserve the breed and avoid issues resulting from inbreeding. The Second World War once again threatened the viability of the breed and in late 1945 it was decided once again that matings between dogs of the different varieties was to be encouraged, and through careful breeding the Belgian Shepherd recovered in numbers. In 1956 the current breed standard was adopted, it specified the four varieties known today; the Groenendael, Laekenois, Malinois and Tervuren. The Groenendael variety is believed to have been created in 1885 by Nicholas Rose, owner of the Ch√¢teau de Groenendael. Rose owned a long-haired, black Belgian Shepherd bitch called \\"Petite\\", liking her look so much he spent over a year searching for a suitable mate, eventually finding a dog named \\"Piccard D'Uccle\\" who belonged to a shepherd called Mr Beernaert, these two are considered the foundation stock of the variety. Their finest progeny were called \\"Duc de Groenendael\\" and \\"Barroness\\" who were mated widely to Belgian Shepherds of different appearances with the black progeny retained. Initially Rose had wanted to name the variety the \\"Rose\\", but it was deemed this could cause confusion given their black colour so they were instead named after his ch√¢teau, Groenendael. During the First World War Groenendaels were used by the Belgian Army to locate wounded soldiers and carry messages, their bravery was recognised by US soldiers during the war and examples were imported to the US in the following years, to this day in the US the name Belgian Shepherd is commonly used to refer to the Groenendael. The Malinois variety was said to be the first variety to breed true to type and initially they became so well known in Belgium that at one time the other varieties were collectively called \\"other-than-Malinois\\", it was the Malinois that the other varieties were gauged against. The variety takes its name from the Malines region where it was the predominant coat type used by the local shepherds. The Laekenois variety has always been the rarest, they take their name from the Ch√¢teau de Laeken, a residence of the Belgian royal family. The Laekenois was a favourite of Queen Marie Henriette who frequently watched them in the service of the shepherds who grazed the royal domains around the ch√¢teau, this patronage contributed to their popularity at the time. In addition to being used as herding dogs, rough-haired Belgian Shepherds were traditionally used as guard dogs in the regions surrounding Boom, guarding valuable linens put out to bleach in the sun. The Tervuren variety is believed to have been created when a brewer M. Corbeel bred his fawn long-haired Belgian Shepherd pair \\"Tom\\" and \\"Poes\\", one of their progeny was a long-haired fawn bitch named \\"Miss\\" who was purchased by a M. Deanhieux. Miss was bred with Duc de Groenendael, foundation sire of the Groenendael varierty, and the fawn progeny became the Tervuren variety who take their name from the region of Tervuren. The Tervuren variety is considered particularly robust and healthy and in Europe a number of breeders use them to reinforce the bloodlines of other varieties, particularly the Groenendael. =Kennel club classification= Most of the world's national kennel clubs including the Soci√©t√© Royale Saint-Hubert, as well as the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale, recognise the Belgian Shepherd as a single breed with four distinct varieties. A minority of kennel clubs, most notably the American Kennel Club, recognise the four varieties as separate breeds, this has caused some consternation for American breeders who breed from imported European stock, European Groenendaels in particular can whelp Tervuren coloured pups, in most of the world these can be registered as Tervurens whereas in the United States these pups would be disqualified from registration. Popularity and uses The Groenendael remains the most popular variety followed by the Tervuren, the Malinois is gaining in popularity whilst the Laekenois remains comparatively rare. Extremely versatile, Belgian Shepherds are frequently trained for use as assistance dogs, detection dogs, guard dogs, guide dogs, police dogs, search and rescue dogs. The breed, in particular the Groenendael, Laekenois and Tervuren varieties, are predominantly kept as pet companion dogs; all of the varieties are frequently seen competing in obedience competitions and schutzhund. In recent times the Laekenois has been employed by the Belgian Army in a variety of roles, the Tervuren is frequently used by government organisations as a drug detection dog and the Malinois in particular has become increasingly popular with customs, military border guard and police forces. Health Belgian Shepherds are considered to be a relatively healthy breed with a life expectancy of 12 to 14 years, although skin allergies, eye problems and dysplasia are seen. The Soci√©t√© Royale Saint-Hubert recommends all four varieties are tested for hip and elbow dysplasia and that the Malinois be tested for epilepsy.

He served as Home Secretary, Lord President of the Council and Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Anderson shelters are named after him.  Early life  He was born in Eskbank, part of Dalkeith in Midlothian and studied mathematics and geology at the University of Edinburgh and chemistry at the University of Leipzig where he wrote a thesis on the chemistry of uranium. He was a brilliant student, winning numerous prizes, but at the age of 22 he decided to forsake a career in science and sat for the British civil service examinations, coming first, while also taking a degree in economics. In later life he was elected an honorary Fellow of the Royal Society. He was appointed to the Colonial Office in 1905. Aged only thirty- four, Anderson headed the Civil Service staff of the new Ministry of Shipping in 1917. Later, he served as Under-Secretary for Ireland, and became Permanent Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office in 1922, where he had to deal with the General Strike of 1926. His career in the civil service was capped by a posting as Governor of Bengal from 1932 to 1937. On 15 January 1935 he met with Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura. Bhaktisiddhanta and Governor of Bengal John Anderson  Public career  In early 1938, Anderson was elected to the House of Commons by the Scottish Universities as a National Independent Member of Parliament, a non-party supporter of the National Government. In October that year he entered Neville Chamberlain's Cabinet as Lord Privy Seal. In that capacity, he was put in charge of air raid preparations. He initiated the development of a kind of air-raid shelter named the \\"Anderson shelter\\", a small sheet metal cylinder made of prefabricated pieces which could be assembled in a garden and partially buried to protect against bomb blast. =War time= After the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Anderson returned to hold the joint portfolio of Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security, a position in which he served under Winston Churchill, often attending his War Cabinet. He retained responsibility for civil defence. In October 1940, he was replaced by Herbert Morrison in a reshuffle precipitated by Chamberlain's resignation over ill-health. He became Lord President of the Council and full member of the War Cabinet. In July 1941 as Lord President of the Council he was appointed as minister responsible for the British plan to build an atomic bomb, known as the Tube Alloys project. In January 1945, the Prime Minister wrote to King George VI to advise that should he and his second-in-command (and heir apparent) Anthony Eden die during the war, John Anderson should become Prime Minister: \\"it is the Prime Minister's duty to advise Your Majesty to send for Sir John Anderson in the event of the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary being killed.\\" Although not a member of a political party, Churchill thought Anderson had the abilities to lead the National Government, and that an independent figure was essential to the maintenance of the coalition. Following the unexpected death on 21 September 1943 of Sir Kingsley Wood, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Anderson was appointed to that office. As Chancellor, in a written Commons answer of 12 June 1945, he announced the creation of the Arts Council of Great Britain, a successor body to the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA).Hansard, HC Debate 12 June 1945 He remained in the post until the Labour victory in the general election in July 1945. =Post-war= He left the Commons when the University constituencies were abolished at the 1950 general election. Meanwhile, he became Chairman of the Port of London Authority in 1946 and Chairman of the Royal Opera House in March the same year. He remained in the latter post for eleven years. He rejected an offer to join Churchill's peacetime administration when it was formed in October 1951, and was created Viscount Waverley, of Westdean in the County of Sussex, in 1952. He died six years later at the age of 75 in St Thomas' Hospital, Lambeth, London. Personal life Anderson's first marriage was in 1907 to Christina Mackenzie. The couple had two children: * David Alastair Pearson Anderson, 2nd Viscount Waverley (1911‚Äì1990) * Mary Mackenzie Anderson (1916‚Äì2006) Christina died in 1920. In 1941, he married Ava (Bodley) Wigram, daughter of John Edward Courtenay Bodley.

In the novel, Barbossa, in his early 40s, is the captain of the pirate schooner Cobra. After plundering a French ivory barque, his ship is attacked and sunk by a crew of rogue pirates, and he is narrowly saved from drowning by his crew members Pintel and Ragetti.

Mistaking her for Bootstrap Bill's child, he takes her to the Isla de Muerta to use her blood in a ritual to break the curse, which fails. Will reveals himself as Bootstrap's son and offers Barbossa his blood in exchange for Elizabeth's safety. Barbossa has Elizabeth and Jack marooned on exactly the same uncharted island where he marooned Jack years earlier. Before Barbossa can perform the ritual, the island is attacked by the British Royal Navy. A fight ensues between Barbossa and Jack. As Will breaks the curse, Barbossa is shot to death by his old captain.Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl However, it is revealed in the closing scene of Dead Man's Chest that Barbossa was revived by Tia Dalma, who is actually the sea goddess Calypso in human form.Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest In return, he struck a bargain with her to free her from her human body with the help of the Brethren Court. In order to do so, it is necessary that Jack Sparrow is rescued from Davy Jones' Locker. Their negotiations with Pirate Lord Sao Feng, who possesses a map to the Locker, are interrupted by an ambush by the East India Trading Company. Sao Feng agrees to provide them with the map and a crew. After successfully freeing Jack, they are again attacked by the East India Trading Company, as Sao Feng had betrayed them. Nevertheless, they reach Shipwreck Cove, where Barbossa leads a meeting of the nine Pirate Lords. He proposes to free Calypso, which leads to a fight between the parties. When Elizabeth Swann is elected Pirate King, she decides to make a final stand against the trading company. After negotiations fail, Barbossa frees Calypso with the Pieces of Eight and the wrathful sea goddess creates a maelstrom, in which Barbossa captains the Black Pearl in a duel with the Flying Dutchman. During the fight, he officiates the marriage of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. Some time later, he sails away with the Black Pearl, planning to use Sao Feng's map to find the Fountain of Youth. However, Jack has stolen the map from him.Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End Sometime after these events he fathers Carina Smyth and leaves her in an orphanage after her mother's death.Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales In On Stranger Tides, set over a decade after the third film, it is revealed that Barbossa had lost the Black Pearl to Edward \\"Blackbeard\\" Teach, who attacked the ship without warning and used his magical sword to turn the ship against his crew. Barbossa lost his right leg in the attack, and vowed to avenge the Pearl by killing Blackbeard. He joined the Royal Navy as a privateer to attain a new ship and safety from prosecution. He excelled so much at his new station that King George II personally tasked him with finding the Fountain of Youth. Barbossa forces Joshamee Gibbs, now in possession of the map, into assisting him on his quest. When they arrive at White Cap Bay, their ship is sunk by mermaids. Making their way through the jungle, Barbossa reaches the ship of Ponce de Leon in search for the two chalices required for the ritual, where he meets Jack Sparrow. The two decide to team up to retrieve the missing chalices from the Spanish camp, where they get captured, and later escape with the chalices. Reaching the Fountain, Barbossa engages Blackbeard in a duel, eventually mortally wounding him with his poisoned blade. He claims Blackbeard's ship, crew, and sword as payment for his lost leg and returns to a life of piracy.Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides Five years later, during Dead Men Tell No Tales, Barbossa has achieved great success as a pirate and rules the Caribbean with his 10 ship fleet, even having acquired a golden peg leg. After three of his ships are sunk by the undead pirate hunter Captain Armando Salazar, whom Jack Sparrow had unintentionally unleashed, Barbossa confronts Salazar and offers to lead him to Jack Sparrow. Jack escapes to an island; the ghosts cannot step on land. An enraged Salazar starts slaughtering Barbossa's crew until Barbossa persuades Salazar to send him to fetch Sparrow. He double-crosses Salazar and allies with Sparrow, freeing the Black Pearl with Blackbeard's sword and once again captaining it. Upon seeing Carina's diary, he realizes she is his daughter. However, he chooses not to tell her of her true parentage in order to allow her to keep her idealized picture of her father, whom she imagines to be an astronomer. When they reach the island where the Trident of Poseidon is located, a fight between them and Salazar ensues, which later continues on the bottom of the ocean. Barbossa has himself lowered down with the ship's anchor to rescue Jack, Henry, and Carina. When Carina falls, Barbossa catches her, revealing a tattoo of the star constellation Carina, after which Carina realizes he is her father. Barbossa sacrifices his life to protect Carina from an approaching Salazar. Following these events, Carina takes up the last name Barbossa.Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales Other appearances * In 2006, an animatronic Hector Barbossa was added (along with Captain Jack Sparrow) to the original Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride at various Disney parks, wherein he appears as captain of the Wicked Wench. * Hector Barbossa is one of only five Disney villains ever nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain, the others being Davy Jones, another villain in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, Scar from The Lion King, Jadis the White Witch in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear from Toy Story 3. * Hector Barbossa (along with another Black Pearl crewman) is pictured on the cover of issue No. 71 Piraten of WAS IST WAS, a German Knowledge-book series, aimed at children and adolescents. * Barbossa was featured in almost all video games related to the series, namely Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), Pirates of the Caribbean (2003), Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow (2006), Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007), Pirates of the Caribbean Online (2007), and Lego Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game (2011), in varying roles. Hector Barbossa appears as a villain in the Pirates of the Caribbean setting, Port Royal, of Kingdom Hearts II. In the game, his role is copied and pasted from the film, with the exceptions of the presence of Sora, Donald and Goofy, his alliance with Pete and Maleficent, and his control over the Heartless. Due to the filming of the two sequels back-to-back, which resulted in Geoffrey Rush being unavailable, Hector Barbossa was voiced by Brian George in the English version and by Haruhiko J≈ç in the Japanese version. Barbossa was one of the original characters available in the video game Disney Infinity released in August 2013. He has returned in Kingdom Hearts III, reprising his role from the third film and once again voiced by Brian George. * Barbossa was made into several action figures by NECA. He appeared in the first wave of Curse of the Black Pearl figures in his human form; that same figure was re-released as part of the fourth wave of Dead Man's Chest toys. Barbossa's cursed form was released as a box set, which also featured Jack Sparrow as a zombie, and the chest of cursed Aztec gold. Then, he was also released in the At World's End figure line. However, he did not come with Jack the Monkey, who was released in a figure set along with Marty. Lastly, Barbossa was featured in \\"On Stranger Tides\\" action figure wave with his peg leg and privateer suit. Barbossa was made as a plush toy for the M&M; Dead Man's Chest.

Known during colonial times as Port Swettenham () but renamed Port Klang in July 1972, it is the largest port in the country. It is located about southwest of the town of Klang, and southwest of Kuala Lumpur. Located in the District of Klang, it was the 11th busiest container port (2012) in the world. It was also the 17th busiest port in by total cargo tonnage handled in 2012 and the top location of aluminium stock for LME, the top metal exchange in the world. History Klang was formerly the terminus of the government railway and the port of the State. In 1880, the state capital of Selangor was moved from Klang to the more strategically advantageous Kuala Lumpur. Rapid development at the new administrative centre in the late 1800s attracted businessmen and job seekers alike from Klang. At this time the only methods of transport between Klang and Kuala Lumpur were by horse or buffalo drawn wagons, or boat ride along the Klang River to Damansara. Due to this Frank Swettenham stated to Selangor's British Resident at the time, William Bloomfield Douglas, that the journey to Kuala Lumpur was \\"rather long and boring\\". He continued to suggest a train line be built as an alternative route. In September 1882, Sir Frank Athelstane Swettenham was appointed Selangor's new Resident. Swettenham initiated a rail link between Klang and Kuala Lumpur to overcome the transport problems particularly of the tin mining interests, who needed to convey the ore to Klang's port, Pelabuhan Batu. Nineteen and a half miles of rail track from Kuala Lumpur to Bukit Kudu was opened in September 1886, and extended 3 miles to Klang in 1890.Official Government Reports for Selangor, 1886, 1890.Various reports in The Straits Times, 1886-1890 atTranscripts available at .Raffles, S (1921) \\"One hundred years of Singapore: being some account of the capital of the Straits Settlements from its foundation\\". London:Murray The river navigation, however, was difficult as only ships drawing less than of water could come up the jetty, and thus a new port was selected near the mouth of the river as the anchorage was good. Developed by the Malayan Railway and officially opened 15 years later on 15 September 1901 by Swettenham himself, the new port was named Port Swettenham. =Under British rule= Southpoint. Both Klang and Port Swettenham were already known as notoriously malaria prone localities with the port itself located on a mangrove swamp. Within two months of its opening, the port was closed due to an outbreak of malaria. Just a few years before, the British doctor Sir Ronald Ross proved in 1897 that malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes. Port Swettenham was the first colonial area to benefit from the discovery. Swamps were filled in, jungle cleared, and surface water diverted to destroy mosquito breeding grounds and combat further disruption to port operations. The threat of malaria was removed completely by the end of the exercise. Trade grew rapidly and two new berths were added by 1914 along with other port facilities. The Selangor Polo Club was founded in Port Swettenham in 1902 but it moved to Kuala Lumpur in 1911. Between World Wars I and II the port experienced much growth and expansion, peaking in 1940 when tonnage rose to 550,000 tonnes. During the Second World War allied aircraft were serviced by RAF Servicing Commandos at airfields in Port Swettenham. Its location is marked on a 1954 map by the United States Army. Much of the port's facilities that were damaged during the war were reconstructed. The port expanded to the south with permanent installations to handle more palm oil and latex, two increasingly important exports. Imports also grew tremendously and tonnage of cargo handled at the port far exceeded what was thought possible before the war. =Post-independence= On 1 July 1963 the Malaysian government established the Port Swettenham Authority, which subsequently was changed to Port Klang Authority as a statutory corporation to take over the administration of Port Klang from the Malayan Railway Administration. In the late 1960s and 1970s new deepwater berths were constructed with wharves suitable for handling container as well as conventional cargoes. The Royal Selangor Yacht Club was first registered here as \\"Port Swettenham Yacht Club\\" in July 1969. In November 1972, Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak declared the container terminal open and in May 1974, construction of seven more berths for bulk cargo began and was completed in 1983. In October 1982, construction of the liquid bulk terminal in North Port was completed. On 17 March 1986 the container terminal facilities operated by Port Klang Authority was privatised to Klang Container Terminal Berhad as part of the privatisation exercise of the government. In January 1988, construction work began on a new berth, as an alternative to the immediate development of West Port. A government directive in 1993 has identified Port Klang to be developed into the National Load Centre. Port Klang has since grown and now establishes trade connections with over 120 countries and dealings with more than 500 ports around the world. Local governance A container being loaded on a prime mover in Northport. =Port Klang Authority= The Port Klang Authority administers three ports in the Port Klang area namely Northport, Southpoint and Westport. Prior to the establishment of the Port Klang Authority, South Port was the only existing port and was administered by the Malayan Railway Administration. Both Westport and Northport have been privatized and managed as separate entities. The total capacity of the port is 109,700,000 tons of cargo in 2005 compared to 550,000 tons in 1940. =Port operators= Northport Northport is owned and operated by Northport (Malaysia) Bhd and comprises dedicated multipurpose port facilities and services. The Northport entity was a merger of two companies; Kelang Container Terminal (KCT) and Kelang Port Management (KPM). Its operations also cover South Port, which was renamed Southpoint for conventional cargo handling, and acquired Northport Distripark Sdn Bhd (NDSB) as part of its logistics division. Westport Port Klang Cruise Centre Westport is managed by Westports Malaysia Sdn Bhd (formerly known as Kelang Multi Terminal Sdn Bhd). A passenger port, Port Klang Cruise Centre, opened in December 1995 at Pulau Indah which is located next to the cargo terminals of Westport. Cruise line and naval ships drop anchor in any of the three berths at Port Klang Cruise Centre, which was under the management of Star Cruises before being taken over by the Glenn Marine Group. Accessibility =Car= Port Klang is the western end of the Federal Highway that links it all the way to Kuala Lumpur. The KESAS interchanges with the Pulau Indah Expressway in nearby Pandamaran connects to Westports and the PKFZ. Main roads that link the Port Klang town, Southport and housing area are Persiaran Raja Muda Musa and Jalan Pelabuhan Utara. Since 2012, Pulau Indah is directly connected to Malaysia's administrative capital, Putrajaya and Kajang via the SKVE . =Public transportation= There is a frequent bus and commuter train service to Kuala Lumpur via Klang. Port Klang is served by the KTM Komuter service and trains stop at the Port Klang Komuter station. The electric train service links to Klang, Kuala Lumpur, Subang Jaya, Shah Alam and all the way until Tanjung Malim. A passenger ferry terminal to Pulau Ketam and an International terminal to Tanjungbalai and Dumai in Indonesia are also located in the area. The old ferry terminal used to serve regular passenger boats to Pulau Lumut and Telok Gonjeng terminal until the completion of Northport Bridge link.

He was Secretary of State for Air during most of the 1920s. As Secretary of State for India in the early 1930s, he authored the Government of India Act 1935, which granted provincial-level self government to India. He is most famous for serving as Foreign Secretary in 1935, when he authored the Hoare‚ÄìLaval Pact with French Prime Minister Pierre Laval. This partially recognised the Italian conquest of Abyssinia (modern Ethiopia) and Hoare was forced to resign by the ensuing public outcry. In 1936 he returned to the Cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty, then served as Home Secretary from 1937 to 1939 and was again briefly Secretary of State for Air in 1940. He was seen as a leading \\"appeaser\\" and his removal from office (along with that of Sir John Simon and the removal of Neville Chamberlain as Prime Minister) was a condition of Labour's agreement to serve in a coalition government in May 1940. He was British ambassador to Spain from 1940 to 1944. Youth Hoare was born in LondonArticle by R. J. Q. Adams. on 24 February 1880, the eldest son of Sir Samuel Hoare, 1st Baronet, who was a Conservative MP from a by-election in 1886 until 1906, and to whose baronetcy he succeeded in 1915. His family were the Anglo-Irish branch of an old Quaker family, with a long history of involvement in banking. He was a descendant of Samuel Hoare, but the family had abandoned Quakerism in the mid eighteenth century and Hoare was brought up an Anglo-Catholic.Matthew 2004, p364 Hoare was educated at Harrow School, where he was a classical scholar, and New College, Oxford. As an undergraduate he was awarded a blue in rackets and was a member of the Gridiron and Bullingdon Clubs. Initially he studied classics, taking a first in Mods in 1901, before switching to Modern History, graduating with a first class B.A. in 1903. He was awarded his M.A. in 1910.Matthew 2004 p.364 An Oxford or Cambridge MA is essentially an \\"automatic upgrade\\" for which a student may apply a few years after graduation He later became Honorary Fellow of New College.Matthew 2004 p.368 On 17 October 1909, he married Lady Maud Lygon (1882‚Äì1962), youngest daughter of The 6th Earl Beauchamp. Their marriage was childless. It was, in the words of R. J. Q. Adams, ‚Äúnot at first a love match‚Äù but in time became ‚Äúa devoted partnership‚Äù.Matthew 2004 p.364 Hoare inherited Sidestrand Hall in 1915. His London home was 18 Cadogan Gardens. Hoare was short, slightly built and a dapper dresser. As a youth he took up games to bolster his physique, including figure skating. He became a tournament-level shot and tennis player. He was a poor speaker but a good writer.Matthew 2004, p368 He was hard-working but cold. Early political career In 1905, Hoare's father arranged for him to be secretary to the Colonial Secretary Alfred Lyttelton to gain political experience.Matthew 2004, p365 Hoare stood unsuccessfully in the 1906 General Election for Parliament at Ipswich, but became a justice of the peace for the county of Norfolk that year. Hoare entered local politics in March 1907, when he was elected to the London County Council as a member of the Municipal Reform Party, the local government wing of the Conservative Party, representing Brixton. He served as Chairman of the London Fire Brigade Committee.The London County Council Election, Great Municipal Reform Victory, The Times, 4 March 1907, p. 6. He served on the LCC until 1910. Hoare was elected to the House of Commons at the January 1910 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Chelsea. In the early years, he was a member of the Anti-Socialist Union.Markku Ruotsila, British and American Anticommunism Before the Cold War, Routledge, 2001, p. 8. He showed little interest in the two largest issues of the day: House of Lords reform and Irish Home Rule. He joined the Unionist Social Reform Committee. He supported tariff reform, female suffrage and public education. He opposed Welsh disestablishment quite strongly. He encouraged colleagues to call him ‚ÄúSam‚Äù at the time to soften his hard and detached image. First World War Aged 34 at the time, Hoare joined the Army soon after the outbreak of the First World War. He was commissioned into the Norfolk Yeomanry as a temporary lieutenant on 17 October 1914. To his disappointment, he was initially only a recruiting officer and illness prevented him from serving at the front. He was promoted to temporary captain on 24 April 1915. While acting as a recruiting officer, he learnt Russian. In 1916, he was recruited by Mansfield Cumming to be the future MI6's liaison officer with the Russian Intelligence service in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg). He soon became head of the British Intelligence Mission to the Russian General Staff with the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel. In that post, he reported to the British government the death of Rasputin and apologised, because of the sensational nature of the event, for having written it in the style of the Daily Mail.Jeffrey, Keith. MI6 The History of the Secret Intelligence Service 1909 - 1949, pp. 103‚Äì106. . In March 1917 he was posted to Rome, where he remained until the end of the war. His duties included helping to dissuade Italy from dropping out of the war. In Italy, he met and recruited the former socialist leader Benito Mussolini on behalf of the British overseas intelligence service, which was then known as MI1(c). Newly-published documents show that Britain's intelligence service helped Mussolini to finance his first forays into Italian politics as a right-wing politician. Hoping to keep Italy on its side in 1917, during the First World War, British intelligence gave Mussolini, a 34-year-old editor of a right-wing newspaper, ¬£100 a week to keep his propaganda flowing. For his services in the war, Hoare was twice mentioned in despatches, appointed Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1917, and awarded the Orders of St Anne and St Stanislas of Russia, and of St Maurice and St Lazarus of Italy. Interwar period =Secretary of State for Air= Hoare was re-elected to Parliament in 1918, but by 1922, he had become disillusioned with David Lloyd George after the honours scandal and the Chanak Crisis. He helped organise the backbench revolt at the Carlton Club meeting (19 October 1922), which brought down Lloyd George's coalition. In Andrew Bonar Law's new Conservative government he was made a Privy Councillor and Secretary of State for Air, but he was not made a member of the Cabinet until Stanley Baldwin succeeded Bonar Law as Prime Minister in May 1923. In 1923, Hoare presided over the merger (with ¬£1 million state subsidy) of the four principal private air carriers to form Imperial Airways, an ancestor of today's British Airways. The Conservatives fell from power in January 1924, but Hoare was once again Secretary of State for Air in Baldwin's Second Government (1924-1929). As Secretary of State for Air he sided with Trenchard on the importance of the Royal Air Force remaining an independent service. He established air squadrons at Oxford University and Cambridge University to train students as potential RAF officers and re-established a permanent air cadet college at Cranwell. Lady Maud was awarded the DBE in February 1927, and Hoare was awarded the Knight Grand Cross of the British Empire (GBE) in June 1927. Hoare and Lady Maud travelled by air whenever possible, including the first civilian flight to India in 1927. In 1927 he published a book, India by Air. By 1929 there were regular scheduled routes to India and Cape Town. Hoare continued his interest in aviation affairs as Honorary Air Commodore of No 601 (County of London) (1930‚Äì32) and No 604 (County of Middlesex) (1932‚Äì57) Bomber Squadrons of the Auxiliary Air Force. =In opposition= Hoare was treasurer of the Conservative Party in opposition in 1929‚Äì1931. In 1930, he published The Fourth Seal on World War I Russia. Hoare was a delegate to the First Round Table Conference on India's constitutional future in 1930‚Äì1931. He also helped to mediate between Baldwin and the press barons Lords Rothermere and Beaverbrook, who were intriguing for his removal as Conservative leader. =Secretary of State for India= Hoare was one of the Conservative negotiators in talks with Ramsay MacDonald in August 1931 over the formation of the National Government. On 26 August 1931 Hoare was appointed Secretary of State for India. At the Second Round Table Conference, Hoare enjoyed good relations with Mahatma Gandhi. He committed Britain to eventual self- government for India, but that was not enough for Gandhi, who wanted full independence. Lord Lothian's report on the extension of the Indian franchise was considered. A White Paper containing the government's legislative proposals for India's constitution was drawn up in March 1933.Butler 1971, p. 57. A Select Committee of Both Houses began to meet for over a year and half in April 1933 to consider the government's plans. In January 1934, Hoare was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Star of India (GCSI) in the New Year Honours.Matthew 2004, p366 Ill feeling between Hoare and Churchill, who opposed Indian self-government, reached its peak in April 1934. The British government proposed for the Indian government to retain the power to impose tariffs on British textiles. The Manchester Chamber of Commerce, representing the Lancashire cotton trade, initially opposed that since it wanted Lancashire goods to be exported freely to India. Churchill accused Hoare of having, with the aid of the Earl of Derby, breached parliamentary privilege by improperly influencing the Manchester Chamber of Commerce to drop its opposition. Hoare was completely exonerated by the Committee on Privileges. Churchill gave a powerful speech in the Commons Chamber that attacked the committee's findings. On 13 June 1934, Leo Amery spoke, arguing that Churchill's true aim was to bring down the government under the cover of the doctrine fiat justicia ruat caelum (\\"may justice be done, though the heavens fall\\"). Churchill, who was neither a lawyer nor a classicist, growled \\"translate it!\\" Amery replied that it meant \\"If I can trip up Sam, the Government's bust\\". The ensuing laughter made Churchill look ridiculous. The Select Committee of Both Houses finished its deliberations in November 1934. The result was one of the most complicated pieces of legislation in British parliamentary history, a bill that spent the first half of 1935 passing through Parliament before becoming the Government of India Act 1935. The Bill contained 473 clauses and 16 schedules, and the debates took up 4,000 pages of Hansard. Hoare had to answer 15,000 questions and make 600 speeches and completely dominated the committee stage of the bill, just as he had during the Round Table Conferences, bu his mastery of detail and his skill at dealing tactfully with deputations.Butler 1971, pp. 55-6. Alec Douglas-Home, later to be Prime Minister, commented in his autobiography, \\"The most noteworthy performance of that Parliament was without question the piloting of the India Independence Bill through the House of Commons by the Secretary of State, Sir Samuel Hoare, ably assisted by Mr. R. A. Butler (later Lord Butler)\\".The Way the Wind Blows, An Autobiography by Lord Home, (1976), , pp. 56‚Äì58. Butler, who, as Under-Secretary, had helped to steer the bill through the Commons, wrote of Hoare that he saw life as \\"a chapter in a great Napoleonic biography\\" and added \\"I was amazed by his ambition; I admired his imagination; I shared his ideals; I stood in awe of his intellectual capacity. But I was never touched by his humanity. He was the coldest fish with whom I ever had to deal\\". Hoare was widely praised for his conduct as India Secretary but was close to exhaustion after the difficult passage of the Bill, which was opposed by Churchill and by many rank-and-file Conservatives. The Act became law in August 1935, when Hoare had moved on to his next position. Although provincial governments were elected in 1937, the Act was never fully implemented because of the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. =Foreign Secretary= In June 1935, Baldwin became prime minister for the third time. He offered Hoare a choice of the job of Viceroy of India or Foreign Secretary. Hoare, who was ambitious to become Prime Minister, chose the latter to enable him to remain active in domestic politics. The position would later make him notorious. Hoare took office against a backdrop of what Adams described as \\"much idle talk\\" of \\"mutual security\\". In March 1935, MacDonald's White Paper had committed Britain to limited rearmament. Italy, which also controlled Libya, straddled Britain's sea route across the Mediterranean to Egypt, the Suez Canal and India. The bombast of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was not taken very seriously in Britain.Roberts 1991, pp78-9 In April 1935, MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon had signed the Stresa Front on 14 April 1935, an alliance with France and Italy, the last of which had joined the Allies in World War One and was suspicious of German designs on Austria. However, the Stress Front did not last. It came to nothing after Britain, without consulting the other members, signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. That dismayed France, which soon signed an Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance. By mid-1935, Mussolini was clearly preparing to attack Abyssinia. On 12 September 1935 Hoare gave what Adams calls \\"the greatest speech of his career\\" to the League General Assembly at Geneva. He declared that Britain stood \\"for steady and collective resistance to all acts of unprovoked aggression\\". His speech was widely praised in the world press but did not deter the full-scale Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3 October. Limited sanctions were imposed on Italy but excluded oil. A general election on 14 November 1935 had over 90% of the candidates support the League of Nations, and there was much support for sanctions against Italy although they were not necessarily in Britain's interests. With the election out of the way, the government, with the agreement of the League Council, authorised Hoare to find a solution. Hoare sent Sir Maurice Peterson, the head of the Foreign Office Abyssinia Department, to Paris to negotiate a compromise offer to Mussolini. An agreement was reached by the end of November: Italy was to gain territory in the north, with the rump of Abyssinia to be an Italian client state and its army under Italian control. Abyssinia had not been consulted. By December 1935, Hoare was still in poor health and suffering from fainting spells since the stressful period of passing the Government of India Act. Suffering from a serious infection, he stopped off in Paris on his way to a skating holiday in Switzerland. The ensuing Hoare‚ÄìLaval Pact with French Prime Minister Pierre Laval was unanimously approved by the Cabinet on 9‚Äì10 December.Matthew 2004, p367 It was leaked to the French and then to the British press, causing a public outcry, not least because of memories of Hoare's recent Geneva speech. Hoare, who had been injured in a skating accident, returned to Britain on 16 December. The Cabinet met on the morning of 18 December. Lord Halifax, who was due to make a statement in the Lords that afternoon, insisted for Hoare to resign to save the government's position, causing J. H. Thomas, William Ormsby-Gore and Walter Elliott to come out for Hoare's resignation as well. Privately, however, Halifax was puzzled by the moral outrage as the Hoare- Laval Pact was little different from proposals that had been put forward by the League Committee of Five. Hoare resigned on 18 December. His successor was Anthony Eden. When Eden had his first audience with King George V, the King is said to have remarked humorously, \\"No more coals to Newcastle, no more Hoares to Paris.\\" In his memoirs, Hoare admitted that his negotiations in Paris with Laval had caught him at a disadvantage. He noted that in the absence of the Hoare‚ÄìLaval Pact, the Italians seized all of Abyssinia and drew closer to Germany, which eventually led to the destabilisation of Austria and the indefensibility of Czechoslovakia. =First Lord of the Admiralty= It was widely recognised that Hoare had been a scapegoat for Cabinet policy. His return to Baldwin's Cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty in June 1936 was widely praised in the press. It was too quickly for Halifax. Eden later wrote in his memoirs that Halifax \\"criticised Baldwin sharply for yielding to Hoare‚Äôs importunity\\". Hoare vigorously endorsed Britain's naval rearmament, including ordering the first three King George V-class battleships, and worked to reverse the subordination of the British naval aviation to the Royal Air Force. =Home Secretary= On Baldwin's retirement, the new Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, offered Hoare any office that he liked except the Exchequer, which Hoare would have liked but had been promised to Simon. Hoare chose the Home Office (28 May 1937). Hoare was still seen as a possible successor to Chamberlain. Hoare had a long family interest in judicial and penal reform. The Quaker prison reformer Elizabeth Fry was his great-great aunt. RJQ Adams wrote highly of his time as Home Secretary. Roy Jenkins wrote that Hoare was the most liberal Home Secretary between H. H. Asquith (1892‚Äì1895) and Rab Butler (1957‚Äì1962).Jenkins 1999, p385 In 1938, Hoare was instrumental in obtaining approval for the British rescue effort on behalf of endangered Jewish children in Europe, which was known as the Kindertransport. In September 1938, Hoare was part of the informal inner Cabinet, along with Simon and Halifax, and was one of the few consulted by Chamberlain about \\"Plan Z\\" to fly to meet Hitler for a summit meeting, a decision that was then popular. Hoare's later account of the Munich Agreement was anguished. Hoare had close links to the Czechoslovak government.J. A. Cross, Sir Samuel Hoare, A Political Biography 1997, , pp. 56‚Äì58. In retirement, he stood strongly by Chamberlain's essential judgements but regretted Chamberlain's lack of sensitivity in foreign affairs and his tendency for personal intervention that led to his failure to retain Eden and to override his Foreign Office advisers. However, Hoare repeatedly pointed out that public opinion was vociferously pacifist and that Chamberlain's actions were widely endorsed at the time, not least by US President Franklin Roosevelt. Also, the Labour opposition strongly opposed rearmament and the introduction of conscription, even after Munich. In spring 1939, Hoare aligned himself very firmly with Chamberlain's upbeat belief that war was now unlikely, rather than with Halifax's increasing focus on shoring up alliances and rearming for a conflict that to seemed imminent to Halifax. Samuel Hoare speaking of a possible future disarmament conference between Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Edouard Daladier, Joseph Stalin and Neville Chamberlain, March 1939INTERNATIONAL: Peace Week, TIME Magazine, 20 March 1939. In 1939, Hoare almost carried the most comprehensive Criminal Justice Reform Bill in British history: he had intended to abolish corporal punishment in prisons and had been keen to work towards the abolition of the death penalty of whose risks he was very aware. The Bill was cancelled because of the outbreak of war. Hoare pumped energy into the Air Raid Precautions Department and the Women's Voluntary Service Organisation. Second World War On the outbreak of war, Hoare became Lord Privy Seal in the nine-man War Cabinet (3 September 1939), with a wide-ranging brief. On 5 April 1940, Hoare briefly returned to the Air Ministry, swapping places with Sir Kingsley Wood, and later that month came under fire during the Norway Debate which brought down the Chamberlain government. Then, the resignations of himself, Chamberlain and Sir John Simon were essential preconditions for Labour to join a coalition government. Hoare was one of the foremost Chamberlain loyalists and was shocked at the apparent disloyalty of others, such as Halifax. Alexander Cadogan saw Hoare as a potential quisling in 1940, but Leo Amery and Lord Beaverbrook thought highly of him. Another Foreign Office mandarin, Robert Vansittart, thought him prim and precise but not a resilient figure in political struggle. Following Winston Churchill's appointment as Prime Minister on 10 May 1940, Hoare was dropped from the government altogether unlike Chamberlain, Halifax and even Simon. He still hoped in vain to be Viceroy of India.Jago, p.146 After a brief period of unemploymentIn his memoirs (Nine Troubled Years p.433), Hoare stated that his appointment came a fortnight after he was dropped from the government. Hoare was sent as Ambassador to Spain, with his wife, Lady Maud Hoare. In that demanding and critical role he helped to arrange the return of thousands of Allied prisoners from Spanish gaols and successfully helped to dissuade Francisco Franco from formally joining the Axis. Hoare loathed Franco and found him a puzzling and obtuse interlocutor. (Hoare found Franco's Portuguese counterpart, Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar, much more pleasant to deal with.) His fluent memoir of the period, Ambassador on Special Mission, is an excellent insight into the day- to-day life of a demanding diplomatic job, his primary challenges being to dissuade Franco from his preferred drift to the Axis powers and to prevent the Allies from reacting with undue haste to repeated Spanish provocations. Hoare's memoir is not completely frank about his deployment of an array of bluff, leaks, bribery and subterfuge to disrupt unfriendly elements in Franco's regime and the operations of the German embassy, but those methods were remembered fondly by his team. In June 1941, Spain, ostensibly remaining neutral, was preparing to send a division of volunteers to fight on the side of Germany against the Soviet Union, the so-called \\"Divisi√≥n Azul\\" Blue Division. On 24 June, a big demonstration of students was organised by the regime in support of the expedition. The demonstration ended in front of the Falange Party's headquarters, where Ram√≥n Serrano Su√±er was present and gave a speech. There was much anti-British sentiment in Spain, and some students went to the nearby British embassy and started throwing stones and to attack the embassy building. Hoare called Serrano Su√±er on the telephone, and they had a heated exchange. Serrano Su√±er asked him if he wanted him to send more police to protect the embassy to which Hoare famously responded, \\"Don't send more police, just send fewer students\\".https://www.libertaddigital.com/opinion/historia/rusia-es- culpable-1276239379.html El embajador, Samuel Hoare, llam√≥ a Serrano S√∫√±er. Discutieron acaloradamente, y tuvo entonces lugar una an√©cdota muy conocida. Serrano le pregunt√≥ si le enviaba m√°s guardias para asegurar la embajada, a lo que Hoare contest√≥: No, no me mande m√°s guardias; m√°ndeme menos estudiantes Hoare also helped to prevent Spanish interference with Operation Torch in November 1942. On 14 July 1944, he was created Viscount Templewood (the name was that of a country house at Sidestrand) of Chelsea in the County of Middlesex. With the issue of Spanish neutrality no longer in doubt, his ambassadorship ended in December 1944, and he returned to Britain. Later life In the House of Lords, Viscount Templewood served on the Political Honours Scrutiny Committee from 1950 and chaired it from 1954. He gave energetic support to penal reform, to the 1947 Criminal Justice Bill and te abolition of capital punishment. He took up many company directorships. He was President of the Lawn Tennis Association (1932‚Äì56), an elder brother of Trinity House (1936‚Äì1950), Chancellor of the University of Reading (1937 until his death in 1959),J. C. Holt, 'The University of Reading: The First Fifty Years', Reading: University of Reading Press, 1976, p. 331. Chairman of the Council of the Howard League for Penal Reform (1947‚Äì59), President of the Magistrates‚Äô Association (1947‚Äì52), President of the Air League of the British Empire (1953-1956), and President of the National Skating Association (1945‚Äì57). Templewood published a number of books after the war, including Ambassador on Special Mission (1946) about his time in Spain, The Unbroken Thread (1949), a family memoir, The Shadow of the Gallows (1951) on capital punishment, and Nine Troubled Years (1954), a memoir of the 1930s. In addition to those awarded for his services in the First World War, he held the following foreign honours: *Grand Cross of the Order of the White Lion of Czechoslovakia. *Grand Cross of the Order of the Polar Star of Sweden. *Grand Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog of Denmark. *Grand Cross of the Order of Orange-Nassau of the Netherlands. He died aged 79 of a heart attack, at his home, 12a Eaton Mansions, Chelsea, London, on 7 May 1959. He was buried at Sidestrand parish churchyard in Norfolk. As his marriage was childless, and his brother had pre-deceased him, the baronetcy and peerage became extinct upon his death. Templewood's estate was valued for probate at ¬£186,944 3s 6d (just over ¬£4.5m at 2016 prices).Compute the Relative Value of a U.K. Pound His residence, Templewood House, in Frogshall, Northrepps, Norfolk, was inherited by his nephew, the architect Paul Edward Paget.

Frenchs Forest is 13 kilometres north of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of Northern Beaches Council. Frenchs Forest is part of Sydney's Northern Beaches region and also considered to be part of the Forest District, colloquially known as The Forest by its locals. The suburb is currently going through rezoning which will include a new hospital, town centre, new relocated high school, 2,200 new homes and $500 million to upgrade the roads around the new Northern Beaches Hospital. The rezoning is proposed to be completed in time for the hospital opening in 2018. History =Aboriginal culture= Prior to the arrival of the First Fleet in Port Jackson in 1788, the area of land we now know as Frenchs Forest, and surrounding Warringah areas, was the home of the Guringai (Ku-ring-gai) language group of the Garigal Aboriginal clan. Evidence of their habitation remains today in the form of rock engravings, rock art, open campsites, rock shelters, scarred trees and middens. The word Warringah has many interpretations including \\"sign of rain\\", \\"across the waves\\" and \\"sea\\". =European settlement= European exploration into Warringah began within the first weeks of settlement at Sydney Cove in 1788. Governor Phillip made a number of journeys throughout the area, detailing the landscape, flora and fauna, as well as observing Aboriginal lifestyle and culture. Although Beacon Hill advertises the \\"Arthur Phillip lookout\\" at its peak, it is believed by some historiansForest History, 1977, paperback that Phillip's travels actually took him through Bantry Bay and up into Frenchs Forest to gain views over the area. In 1853 Simeon Henry Pearce (1821‚Äì1886) and his brother James acquired in this area. The property was later known as Rodborough when it was acquired by James French, a police constable, who also developed the land that became neighbouring Forestville. Despite its relative proximity to Sydney, Frenchs Forest remained predominantly rural throughout the nineteenth century.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , p. 106.  Geography  NASA satellite view of Frenchs Forest within the Sydney area Frenchs Forest is close to the Garigal National Park. It is elevated (~156 m ASL) regularly having high rainfall compared with the rest of Sydney and is spread along ridgelines surrounded by native bushland. The eastern parts have distant views (3 km) over the Pacific Ocean and the temperature extremes typical of Sydney are moderated by this proximity. Garigal National Park features native wildlife, birds, turtles, wallabies, lizards, snakes. Bush tracks include bluff track and natural bridge track. = Climate = Frenchs Forest climate is similar to the Climate of Sydney, albeit with a few minor seasonal differences: winters tend to be cooler and wetter than in the city, while summers tend to be less hot.  Commercial areas  Forestway Shopping Centre is at the intersection of Forestway and Warringah Road.http://www.forestway.com.au/ The centre includes an Aldi and Woolworths supermarkets and over 50 speciality stores. Smaller shopping centres are located at Sorlie Road featuring a variety of restaurants and Skyline shops on Frenchs Forest Road East, the name being derived from the 'Skyline Drive-in Movie Theatre' that existed nearby until the mid-1980s. Frenchs Forest Town Centre is a proposed shopping mall, aquatic centre and high-rise residential development.  Schools  Frenchs Forest is home to a number of schools: * Frenchs Forest Public School * Mimosa Public School * The Forest High School * Davidson High School  Churches  * Frenchs Forest Anglican Church * Frenchs Forest Uniting Church (also known as \\"The Kirk\\") * Forest Alliance Church * Frenchs Forest Baptist Although named Frenchs Forest Catholic Parish, the three church buildings that make up the parish are located in the adjoining suburbs of Davidson, Forestville & Terrey Hills.  Transport  = Road = The main routes through Frenchs Forest include the east-west Warringah Road (State route A38), connecting Roseville in the west with Brookvale in the east; the north-south Forest Way, starting at Warringah Road in Frenchs Forest and heading north through Belrose to Terrey Hills, connecting with Mona Vale Road (8 km); and the north-south Wakehurst Parkway (State route 22), starting at Narrabeen in the northeast, crossing Frenchs Forest Road and Warringah Road in Frenchs Forest, and heading south to Seaforth, leading to the Spit Bridge. Following any of these three major roads lead to the only three road routes off the Northern Beaches peninsula. The intersection of Wakehurst Parkway and Warringah Road was the scene of multiple high speed collisions when these two roads were dirt tracks through the bush. To improve this, a blinking light was suspended above the intersection in the first half of the 20th century to warn motorists of the danger, which earned the interesting the enduring name of 'The Blinking Lights'.http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/northern- beaches/from-blinking-light-to-gridlock-50-years-of-increasing- congestion/news-story/413786d6c06b8efb59453b2e9e8d4952 =Buses= Forest Coach Lines connects Frenchs Forest with Chatswood railway station in the west, Westfield Warringah Mall shopping centre at Brookvale in the east and Terrey Hills in the north, with an express bus service running to Town Hall station in the Sydney central business district.http://www.forestcoachlines.com.au/images/time/map/Forest-Network- map.pdf their network State Transit runs a number of bus lines through the Frenchs Forest area, including the 136 bus service which connects Chatswood to Dee Why, the 173 bus route which connects Milsons Point and Narraweena, and the 169 and E69 bus routes which connect the Sydney central business district with Manly.

Resolutions are often preceded by \\"Whereas...\\" clauses that express reasons or justifications for the ensuing resolution. In law, resolution is a written motion adopted by a deliberative body. The substance of the resolution can be anything that can normally be proposed as a motion. For long or important motions, though, it is often better to have them written out so that discussion is easier or so that it can be distributed outside the body after its adoption. An alternate term for a resolution is a resolve. Resolutions are commonly used in corporations and houses of legislature. In corporations In corporations, a written resolution is especially useful in the case of the board of directors of a corporation, which usually needs to give its consent to real estate purchases or sales by the corporation. Such a resolution, when certified by the corporation's secretary, gives assurance to the other side of the transaction that the sale was properly authorized. Other examples include resolutions approving the opening of bank accounts or authorizing the issuance of shares in the corporation. Houses of legislature When greater formality is desired, a motion may be made in the form of a resolution, which is always submitted in writing. Houses of a legislature often adopt non-binding resolutions. However, a legislature also uses resolutions to exercise one of its binding powers that isn't a lawmaking power. For example, the United States Congress declares war or proposes constitutional amendments by adopting a joint resolution. A house of a legislature can also use a resolution to exercise its specific powers, as the British House of Commons does to elect its Speaker or as the United States House of Representatives does to impeach an officer of the government. Types =Non-binding= In a house of a legislature, the term non-binding resolution refers to measures that do not become laws. This is used to differentiate those measures from a bill, which is also a resolution in the technical sense. The resolution is often used to express the body's approval or disapproval of something which they cannot otherwise vote on, due to the matter being handled by another jurisdiction, or being protected by a constitution. An example would be a resolution of support for a nation's troops in battle, which carries no legal weight, but is adopted for moral support. =Substantive and procedural= Substantive resolutions apply to essential legal principles and rules of right, analogous to substantive law, in contrast to procedural resolutions, which deal with the methods and means by which substantive items are made and administered.

Epistle of Victory) was a spiritual victory letter sent by Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji in 1705 to the Mughal Emperor of India, Aurangzeb after the Battle of Chamkaur. The letter is written in Persian verse. Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji sent Bhai Daya Singh Ji to Ahmednagar to give it to Aurangzeb. However it is said that a copy of the Zafarnama, written by himself, was found with the Mahant of Patna Sahib in 1890 and one Babu Jagan Nath made a copy; this copy was somehow misplaced by him. Since Babu Jagan Nath was himself a scholar in Persian language, he could reproduce it from his memory and got it printed in Nagri Parcharni Patrika in Benaras. He is also believed to have sent a copy to Sardar Umrao Singh Shergill in Amritsar who is said to have given it to Khalsa college and which in turn reproduced in Makhzan-e-Twarikh Sikhan. In Punjab newspapers, it first appeared in the Khalsa Samachar of 16 July 1942. Then in 1944, Kapur Singh ICS published it in Urdu Ajit of Lahore under the heading \\"Fatehnama\\". It is quite possible that in the process of translations and publications of the Zafarnama at different stages, some verses were not reproduced correctly and what we have today is not the original Zafarnama of the Guru in its entirety. The abrupt end of the Zafarnama also indicates that it is not complete and that some verses have been left out. Objections raised by some scholars on the authenticity of a few verses may be viewed in this context. In this letter, Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji reminds Aurangzeb how he and his henchmen had broken their oaths sworn upon the Qur'an. He also states that in spite of his several sufferings, he had won a moral victory over the Emperor who had broken all his vows. Despite sending a huge army to capture or kill the Guru, the Mughal forces did not succeed in their mission. In the 111 verses of this notice, Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji rebukes Aurangzeb for his weaknesses as a human being and for excesses as a leader. Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji also confirms his confidence and his unflinching faith in the Almighty even after suffering extreme personal loss of his Father, Mother, and all four of his sons to Aurangzeb's tyranny. Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji invited Aurangzeb to meet him in Kangar village near Bathinda (Punjab) and said no need to worry as Brar tribe will not harm him (Aurangzeb) as they are under his command. \\" On the way, there will be no danger to your life, For, the whole tribe of Brars accepts my command. (59)\\" Of the 111 verses, the maximum numbers of 34 verses are to praise God; 32 deal with Aurangzeb‚Äôs invitation for the Guru to meet him and the Guru's refusal to meet the Emperor ‚Äì instead the Guru asks Aurangzeb to visit him; 24 verses detail the events in the Battle of Chamkaur, which took place on 22 December 1704; 15 verses reprove Aurangzeb for breaking promise given by him and by his agents to the Guru; In verses 78 and 79, Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji had also warned Aurangzeb about the resolve of the Khalsa not to rest till his evil empire is destroyed; 6 verses praise Aurangzeb. Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji wrote this letter from the village of Dina in Malwa region of the Punjab. Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji spent few days at Dina and then moved to Dod, Kotkapura, Dhilwan Kalan, Jaitu, Shri Muktsar Sahib, Lakhi Jangal, and Damdama Sahib. Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji's last fight with Mughal Army happened at Khidrane Di Dhaab, now called Sri Muktsar Sahib. One of the most quoted verses from the Zafarnama is verse 22: :\\"Chun kar az hameh heelate dar guzasht, :Halal ast burdan bi-shamsheer dast. :When all has been tried, yet :Justice is not in sight, :It is then right to pick up the sword, :It is then right to fight\\"  Notes  Bhai Daya Singh Ji Handed over Zafarnama to Aurangzeb, with the help of Naib Subedar Haji Sardar Shah, who was great admirer of Shri Guru Gobind Singh Ji. On 5 January 1707 which was the last Date of Ramadaan that year.

Political career Stewart had contested the Lewisham West constituency in 1931 and 1935, and Fulham East in 1936; after the war he became MP for Fulham East 1945‚Äì55, then for Fulham 1955‚Äì74, and Hammersmith, Fulham 1974‚Äì79. Soon after his initial election, he was made one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury (more commonly known as a junior whip), then a junior minister, as Under-Secretary of State for War (1947‚Äì51) and later as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Supply (May‚ÄìOctober 1951). Following Labour's defeat in the 1951 election, Stewart was a rising figure on the shadow front bench, serving as Shadow Minister of Education (1955‚Äì59) and then as Shadow Minister of Housing and Local Government (1959‚Äì64). Stewart was Fabian Summer School director in 1952 and lecturer in 1954. He was Fabian New Year School lecturer in 1954‚Äì55 and publicist in 1956. He is listed as a member of the Fabian Society International Bureau Committee during 1957‚Äì58 and was mentioned in Fabian News November ‚Äì December 1964 as a former member of the Fabian Executive Committee. Government 1964‚Äì70 When Harold Wilson became Prime Minister in 1964, Stewart was appointed Secretary of State for Education and Science. He was promoted to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in January 1965. He was described by the press as relatively unknown to the public but was extremely well known within Fabian socialist circles. He became Secretary of State for Economic Affairs in 1966. From 1966 to 1968, he was First Secretary of State. He returned to the Foreign Office from 1968 to 1970. As foreign secretary, he was instrumental in supplying arms to support the Nigerian government's crushing of the secessionist movement in Biafra (when up to one million people died), later saying \\"It would have been quite easy for me to say: This is going to be difficult ‚Äì let's cut off all connexion with the Nigerian Government. If I'd done that I should have known that I was encouraging in Africa the principle of tribal secession ‚Äì with all the misery that could bring to Africa in the future.\\" Post-Government A committed pro-European, Stewart was leader of the Labour Delegation to the Council of Europe in June 1970, and joint president of the Labour Committee for Europe with George Brown and Roy Jenkins. He served as a member of the European Parliament from 1975 to 1976. Stewart was made a member of the Privy Council in 1964. He was appointed a Companion of Honour (CH) in the 1969 New Year Honours.

He was the Member of Parliament for Nepean‚ÄîCarleton from 1997 until 2004. Early political career Before Pratt was elected federally, he served in public office municipally. In 1988, he won a seat on Nepean City Council. His re- election in 1991 also gave him a seat on the Ottawa-Carleton Regional Municipality Council. In the municipal election of 1994, his candidacy was uncontested and he was acclaimed. On Nepean Council, Pratt served a term as Deputy Mayor and chaired the committees of Public Works and Parks and Recreation. On Regional Council, he worked on transportation and environment issues and was a member of the Ottawa-Carleton Police Services Board and the OC Transpo Commission. He served for five years on the Board of Directors of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities where he was involved in community safety and crime prevention issues, district energy and international development programs in Africa. National politics As Minister of National Defence, Pratt received cabinet support for several major procurement projects totalling $7 billion including the Maritime Helicopter Program (Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone) to replace the aging Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King fleet, the Mobile Gun System (later cancelled) and a new fixed wing search and rescue aircraft to replace the CH-115 and C-130H HerƒØcules (CC-295). He also obtained federal cabinet approval for the Joint Support Ship program to provide new supply ships for the Canadian Navy. As the local Ottawa cabinet minister in 2004, he worked with provincial and municipal officials to assemble $600 million in funding for a proposed light rail transit system (LRT) Following the election in 2006 of a new Ottawa Mayor, Larry O‚ÄôBrien, who replaced Mayor Bob Chiarelli, and with the support of the local Conservative Cabinet Minister, John Baird, the transit project was cancelled by the City of Ottawa. Long delays in planning and construction meant that the first section of the LRT system was only opened in 2019. As Chair of the Commons Defence Committee, he was a strong advocate for increased military spending both before and after the September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001. Under his leadership, the defence committee released a report entitled: \\"Facing Our Responsibilities: The state of readiness of the Canadian Forces\\" which called for substantial new investments in Canada‚Äôs military capabilities. As committee chair, Pratt also argued strongly for a more bi-partisan approach to defence issues and for regular reviews of Canadian foreign and defence policy. He successfully sponsored a resolution in Parliament to declare the first Sunday in June \\"Canadian Forces Day\\" and contributed to policy debates on defence and security matters with two papers: \\"Fostering Human Security: A Joint Canada-US Brigade,\\" (October 2000) and \\"Does Canada Need A Foreign Intelligence Agency?Does Canada Need A Foreign Intelligence Agency?\\" (March 2003). In 1999, Pratt served as a Special Envoy for Lloyd Axworthy, Minister of Foreign Affairs to Sierra Leone and performed the same role for Axworthy‚Äôs successor, John Manley. He visited the war torn country on several occasions. He met and held talks with the former Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, and former President Charles Taylor of Liberia, President Lansana Conte of Guinea. There were also meetings and consultations with other senior officials and diplomatic representatives including Revolutionary United Front leader Foday Sankoh. He wrote two reports - \\"The Forgotten Crisis\\"The Forgotten Crisis (April 1999) and \\"Sierra Leone: Danger and Opportunity in a Regional Conflict\\" (July 2001). His recommendations called for more Canadian aid to Sierra Leone and more direct Canadian involvement to bring peace to the region. He also suggested that Liberian President Charles Taylor be investigated by the Special Court for Sierra Leone for war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in prolonging the regional conflict. Pratt also introduced the first legislation in Canada to certify diamonds under the United Nations sanctioned Kimberley Process to stop the trade in blood diamonds and to protect the integrity of the Canadian diamond industry. Similar government sponsored legislation was eventually passed by Parliament. An advocate of physical fitness, in July 2003, he completed the gruelling four-day 160 kilometre International Four Days Marches Nijmegen with members of the Canadian Forces ‚Äì the first Canadian Member of Parliament to do so. In the 2004 federal election, he lost his seat to the Conservative candidate, forcing his departure as Defence Minister three weeks later. Career after politics Following his electoral loss, Pratt joined the Canadian Red Cross as a Special Advisor in November 2004. He worked on issues related to conflict prevention, small arms and light weapons and international humanitarian law. During the aftermath of the December 2004 South East Asia Tsunami, he visited Thailand and Sri Lanka where, with the cooperation of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), he submitted a report to the Canadian Red Cross with recommendations for Canadian aid. In 2006, he helped initiate the Canadian Red Cross‚Äôs Auxiliary to Government project. The project sought to improve the cooperation between the Canadian Red Cross and governments at all levels in Canada, especially in the area of emergency management. It emphasized the special and distinct role that Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have under domestic and international law and the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. The project also sought to obtain new legislation to replace the outdated The Canadian Red Cross Society Act, 1909. As the project leader, Pratt authored a discussion paper entitled: \\"Toward a Renewed Canadian Red Cross ‚Äì Forging Stronger Partnerships In Support of a Humanitarian Agenda\\"Toward a Renewed Canadian Red Cross ‚Äì Forging Stronger Partnerships In Support of a Humanitarian Agenda and the project‚Äôs interim report entitled: \\"Revitalizing the Framework of Cooperation with Public Authorities\\".Revitalizing the Framework of Cooperation with Public Authorities Pratt beside the vehicle that was part of a convoy he was riding in shortly after it was hit by an IED - Baghdad, August 2009 In July 2008, Pratt left the Canadian Red Cross and ran as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Ottawa West‚ÄîNepean where he faced incumbent minister John Baird. He received 20,161 votes or 36.1 percent compared to Baird‚Äôs 25,109 votes and 44.9 percent of the vote. Following the election, Pratt worked as a consultant. In 2009 and 2010, he spent over five months in Baghdad, Iraq employed by AECOM on the USAID sponsored Iraq Legislative Strengthening Program. USAID Iraq Legislative Strengthening Program Pratt was responsible for organizing an orientation and training program for newly elected Iraqi MPs. He also provided teaching material on legislative committees, the concept of parliamentary privilege and codes of ethics for parliamentarians. In August 2009, a three vehicle convoy in which Pratt and four other colleagues were travelling was hit by an IED. The explosion, which occurred in the Red Zone in Baghdad, caused significant vehicle damage and blew out windows in the surrounding area, but no one was hurt. In January 2011, Pratt accepted the position of Senior Vice President of Public Affairs with GCI Canada, GCI Appoints David Pratt as Senior Vice President, Public Affairs a public relations and public affairs company with offices in Toronto and Ottawa. In September 2012, Pratt started his own company, David Pratt & Associates, which is a government relations and strategic consulting firm based in Ottawa.

The resort is known commercially as Aman Sveti Stefan and includes part of the mainland, where the Villa Miloƒçer () is located. The hotel is now a 5-star franchise of the international group of Aman Resorts, completed in 2009 and operating under a 30-year lease. Sveti Stefan was an island but is now connected to the mainland by a narrow tombolo. The resort in total contains 50 rooms, cottages, and suites on the island, and 8 grand suites at the Villa Miloƒçer. Geography The island has a coast line in the central part of Montenegro Adriatic coast line. It is situated to the south of Budva between Pr≈æno and Sveti Stefan villages. The pink sandy beaches of Sveti Stefan, Miloƒçer Beach, and Queen's Beach are part of the coastline. The island encompasses an area of . (0.0124 km¬≤) History The earliest record of Sveti Stefan is as the capital city of the Pa≈°troviƒái community, which became a protectorate of the Republic of Venice in 1423, having been independent since the twelfth century. The Pa≈°troviƒái accepted Venetian sovereignty because they were fearful of attack from the Turks. They retained considerable autonomy and paid no tribute to Venice, in return for ceasing piracy against Venetian ships. According to a legend recounted by Stjepan Mitrov Ljubi≈°a, the town fortification was funded after Pa≈°troviƒái looted Turkish ships moored in front of Jaz during Barbarossa's siege of Kotor in 1539. The town was razed shortly after, during the Fourth Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War. After continuous pleas by Pa≈°troviƒái, the Venetian Republic agreed to rebuild it in the 16th century. In the 15th century, the fortified village was built to defend against the Turks and became a haven for pirates of the Adriatic. Initially, the island with its fortress had 12 families. In the 1800s, a village was established on the island with a population of about 400 people. Villa Miloƒçer was built between 1934 and 1936 as the summer residence of Queen Marija Karadordevic (1900‚Äì1961) of the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá family of Serbia, which was refurbished as part of the Aman Sveti Stefan resorts that opened in 2008‚Äì2009. The villa, surrounded by 800 olive trees, is laid out over a plot. The population of the island declined in the first half of the twentieth century, as residents left to join the armed forces or to move overseas. From 400 inhabitants in the nineteenth century, there were just 20 remaining by 1954. The Communist Yugoslav authorities converted it into a luxury hotel and moved the remaining inhabitants to the mainland, and the island village became an exclusive resort frequented by high-profile elites of the world. One of the four churches belonging to Praskvica Monastery on Sveti Stefan was turned into a casino by the Communists. The resort was visited by many celebrities, including Orson Welles, Elizabeth Taylor, Sophia Loren, Marilyn Monroe, Princess Margaret, Carlo Ponti, Ingemar Stenmark, and Kirk Douglas. It was described as \\"a '70s Adriatic playground on a hilly peninsula that's barely connected to the mainland\\". It was also a venue for political conferences and an occasional chess venue, attracting top-class players such as Boris Spassky and Bobby Fischer. However, the break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s brought a decline to the resort. The Government of Montenegro proposed to recreate the old charm of the island, inviting international bids for a revitalization project. The contract was awarded to Aman Resorts in 2007, and the refurbished resort was completed in 2009. The Aman Sveti Stefan has a 30-year lease. On 13 July 2010 Montenegrin Statehood Day, Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli gave a concert at the resort to mark the Golden Jubilee of the hotel.. The hotel won the Hotel of the Year award from Gallivanter's Guide in 2010. Facilities The Aman Sveti Stefan resort has 58 guest rooms, cottages, and suites, including 8 suites that are part of the Villa Miloƒçer. The Villa Miloƒçer was built between 1934 and 1936 as the summer residence of Queen Marija Karadordevic (1900‚Äì1961). Out of the eight suites of Villa Miloƒçer, two are Queen Marija Suites forming an annex structure. The main dining of the resort on the island of Sveti Stefan is The Piazza, an open-air square in the heart of the island's village which includes the Taverna, Enoteca, Pasticceria, an Antipasti Bar, and a Cigar Room.

It was occasionally referred to as , although the present name appears to have become standard after the middle of the Edo period. During the Sengoku period, this area was the stronghold of the Oda clan and was the birthplace of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. After the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate, it came under the control of Owari Domain. Following the Meiji Restoration, in 1871, former Owari Domain was renamed Nagoya Prefecture. However, for reasons still unclear, the name was changed to Aichi Prefecture. With the formal establishment of the municipality system on October 1, 1887, the modern Aichi District was established, with two towns (Atsuta and Narumi) and 46 villages. Yobitsugi was raised to town status on July 12, 1897, followed by Chikusa on February 13, 1902, and Aichi on December 10, 1904. In a major cadastral reorganization in 1906-1907, the number of remaining villages was reduced from 41 to 16, and the town of Atsuta was annexed by the city of Nagoya. The town of Shimonoisshiki was created on July 6, 1917. In another cadastral reform in 1921, the number of villages was reduced from 16 to 7, with the towns of Aichi and Yobitsugi annexed by Nagoya. The city of Nagoya further annexed Shimonoisshiki in March 1937, leaving the district with one town and 7 villages at the eve of World War II. On February 11, 1955, the village of Hanyama merged into the city of Seto. Later that year, on April 5, 1955, the village of Chotaka merged into Chikusa-ku, Nagoya. The village of Tempaku (later Tempaku-ku) merged into Showa-ku, Nagoya. On January 1, 1957 Toyoake gained town status, following by Nisshin on January 1, 1958.

Johnson Memorial Tunnel, is a dual-bore, four-lane vehicular tunnel in the western United States, approximately west of Denver, Colorado. The tunnel carries Interstate 70 (I-70) under the Continental Divide in the Rocky Mountains. With a maximum elevation of above sea level, it is one of the highest vehicular tunnels in the world. The tunnel is the longest mountain tunnel and highest point on the Interstate Highway System. With the completion of the second bore in 1979, it was one of the last major segments of the Interstate system to be completed. Opened in 1973, the westbound bore is named after Dwight D. Eisenhower, the U.S. President for whom the Interstate system is also named. The eastbound bore was completed in 1979 and is named for Edwin C. Johnson, a governor and U.S. Senator who lobbied for an Interstate Highway to be built across Colorado. Description The Eisenhower Memorial Bore (westbound tunnel) is long, while the Edwin C. Johnson Memorial Bore (eastbound tunnel) is long. The tunnels are sloped with a 1.64% grade, with an elevation of at the east portal and at the west portal. At the time of dedication, they were the highest vehicular tunnels in the world. While the Eisenhower Tunnel remains the highest vehicular tunnel in the US, higher tunnels have since been constructed elsewhere, such as the Fenghuoshan Tunnel, a rail tunnel in China. The Eisenhower tunnel is noted as the longest mountain tunnel and highest point on the Interstate Highway System. The tunnel bores measure . The portion accessible to the public is a rectangular shape measuring just over tall. The remainder of the bore is used for forced air ventilation and water drainage systems. =Height restriction= alt=Building facing a large mountain with two openings for the traffic, visible on the roof of the building are large ventilation hoods Due to additional height restrictions from variable-message signs and lighting systems, the tunnels' original posted clearance was . The trucking industry lobbied the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) to increase the vertical clearance. With a 2007 retrofit that used lower-profile lighting and signs, trucks can navigate the tunnel, an increase of over the original limit. Sensors activate audible sirens near each entrance of the tunnel if a vehicle above the posted height attempts to enter the tunnel. Traffic signals at that entrance will turn red, stopping all traffic. The entrance will remain closed until the vehicle is removed from the freeway, sometimes causing severe delays for all traffic. CDOT noted that prior to the retrofit, about 20,000 vehicles per year tripped the alarm. The trucking industry argued that many of these trucks were under the height requirement but tripped the alarm due to their air suspensions (which can be lowered during their journey through the tunnel) or due to snow and ice atop the trailer. During this time, the trucking industry estimated the number of alarms would drop by as much as 80% if the clearance could be raised even a few inches. Another feature of the retrofit monitors truck weight‚Äîa safe speed for each truck on the 7% grades and curves just outside the tunnel is calculated and displayed for each driver. =Alternate route= alt=A two-lane freeway without any safety lanes or shoulders is proceeding down a lighted square passageway. To mitigate the dangers posed by a fire inside the tunnel, trucks hauling hazardous materials are prohibited from using the tunnel. Prohibited trucks, bicyclists, pedestrians, and those who wish to stop and view the scenery must take the longer and steeper climb and descent of the older U.S. Highway 6 across Loveland Pass, higher at above sea level. Other than the above exceptions, the tunnel has replaced the pass for general vehicular traffic. While less formidable than the older route, the approach to the tunnel on both sides is steep, and runaway truck ramps are available for truckers who lose control. During construction or winter storms that require closing Loveland Pass, there is a procedure in place to allow hazardous material trucks to use the tunnel. Once per hour, the tunnel bores will be closed to regular traffic, and the trucks will be guided through the tunnel in a convoy with escorts. As of December 2009, almost 276 million vehicles have passed through the tunnel. This figure includes a significant number of visitors to Colorado's ski resorts. History alt=partial view of a traffic signal leading to a hole in a snow covered building. The idea for a tunnel under Loveland Pass existed since at least the 1950s. Serious discussion began when the state of Colorado lobbied for the Interstate Highway System to route a transcontinental highway across Colorado. After a round of negotiations with Utah officials, it was decided the best option was to follow the US Route 6 corridor. Engineers recommended to tunnel under the pass, rather than attempt to build a route across it that conformed to Interstate Highway standards. The Eisenhower‚ÄìJohnson Memorial Tunnel was known as the Straight Creek Tunnel during construction, named for the waterway that runs along the western approach to the tunnel. Before the tunnel was dedicated, it was renamed to honor Dwight D. Eisenhower and Edwin C. Johnson. The original Pioneer bore to access the two larger bores was \\"holed through\\" in late 1964, after fourteen months. Construction on the first bore of the tunnel was started on March 15, 1968. Construction efforts suffered many setbacks and the project went well over time and budget. One of the biggest setbacks was the discovery of fault lines in the path of the tunnel that were not discovered during the pilot bores. These faults began to slip during construction and emergency measures had to be taken to protect the tunnels and workers from cave-ins and collapses. Despite the best efforts of engineers, three workers were killed boring the first tube and four in boring the second.https://www.codot.gov/travel/eisenhower-tunnel/eisenhower-tunnel- interesting-facts.html Further complicating construction, the boring machines could not work as fast as expected at such high elevations and so the productivity was significantly less than planned. The frustration prompted one engineer to comment, \\"We were going by the book, but the damned mountain couldn't read.\\" Though the project was supposed to take three years, the tunnel was not opened to traffic until March 8, 1973. Initially, the northern Eisenhower bore was used for two-way traffic, with one lane for each direction. The amount of traffic through the tunnel exceeded predictions, and efforts soon began to expedite construction on the southern bore. Construction began on the eastbound Edwin C. Johnson tunnel on August 18, 1975 and finished on December 21, 1979. The initial engineering cost estimate for the Eisenhower bore was $42 million, but the actual cost was $108 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Approximately 90% of the funds were paid by the federal government, with the state of Colorado paying the rest. At the time, it set a record for the most expensive federally-aided project. The excavation cost for the Johnson bore was $102.8 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Not included in the figures is about $50 million in non-boring expenses during the construction of both tunnels. West Portal in summer 1978 The tunnel's construction became unintentionally involved in the feminist movement when Janet Bonnema applied for a position as an engineering technician with the Colorado Department of Transportation. She was given an assignment on the Straight Creek Tunnels project, but her supervisor misread her resume and thought that he was hiring \\"James.\\" When the supervisor discovered that the department had hired a woman, she was tasked with doing support work from the office. There was opposition to a woman entering the construction site. One supervisor stated that if she entered, \\"Those workers would flat walk out of that there tunnel and they'd never come back.\\" The workers, most of whom had a mining background, expressed a common superstition that a woman brought bad luck to a mine. One worker insisted, \\"It's a jinx. I've seen too many die after a woman was in the tunnel.\\" Bonnema sued the department for the right to work inside the tunnel. She countered she was in better shape and more agile than most of the men who were working on the tunnel. Emboldened by the passage of an equal rights law in Colorado, she finally entered the tunnel, with an entourage of reporters, on November 9, 1972. Some workers walked off the job, and at least one of them yelled, \\"Get those women out of here.\\" She remained determined and re-entered the tunnel a few days later. The next time, she dressed in coveralls and was even assigned tasks on the roof of the tunnel overlooking the men below. Surprised that nobody had apparently noticed that she was a woman, she stated, \\"I had a good disguise.\\" =Plane crash= During the tunnel's construction in 1970, a plane crash occurred less than 2 miles (3 km) northeast of the east portal on Friday, October 2. A Martin 4-0-4 charter aircraft, one of two carrying the college football team of Wichita State University, crashed just north of the highway (). Of the 40 passengers and crew on board, only nine survived.NTSB Aircraft Accident Report, SA-421, File No. 3-1127. The team was on its way to a game with Utah State University in Logan and had recently refueled at Denver's Stapleton International Airport. The plane carrying the team's starters departed Denver and traveled a poorly- planned scenic route. The other plane, carrying reserve players, followed the original route and landed safely in Logan. Workers constructing the tunnel were among the first on scene at the crash site. Water diversion As with the Moffat Tunnel, while the Eisenhower Tunnel was primarily intended as a transportation tunnel, it also serves as a water tunnel for water diversion from the western side of the Continental Divide to the eastern side. Water from the Straight Creek watershed (a tributary of the Blue River), along with all seepage entering the tunnel is discharged into Clear Creek for delivery to the Coors Brewing Company. Typically, the tunnel delivers over 300 acre-feet (370,000 m3) of water per year.

It is a flagship campus of the University of Alaska system and a land-grant, sea-grant, and space-grant institution. UAF was established in 1917 and opened for classes in 1922. Originally named the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines, it became the University of Alaska in 1935. Fairbanks-based programs became the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 1975. UAF is classified among \\"R2: Doctoral Universities ‚Äì High research activity\\". It is home to several major research units, including the Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station; the Geophysical Institute, which operates the Poker Flat Research Range and several other scientific centers; the Alaska Center for Energy and Power; the International Arctic Research Center; the Institute of Arctic Biology; the Institute of Marine Science; and the Institute of Northern Engineering. Located just 200 miles (320 km) south of the Arctic Circle, the Fairbanks campus' unique location favors Arctic and northern research. UAF's research specialties are renowned worldwide, most notably Arctic biology, Arctic engineering, geophysics, supercomputing and Alaska Native studies. The University of Alaska Museum of the North is also on the Fairbanks campus. In addition to the Fairbanks campus, UAF encompasses six rural and urban campuses: Bristol Bay Campus in Dillingham; Chukchi Campus in Kotzebue; the Fairbanks-based Interior Alaska Campus, which serves the state's rural Interior; Kuskokwim Campus in Bethel; Northwest Campus in Nome; and the UAF Community and Technical College, with headquarters in downtown Fairbanks. UAF is also the home of UAF eCampus, which offers fully online programs. In fall 2017, UAF enrolled 8,720 students. Of those students, 58% were female and 41% were male; 87.8% were undergraduates, and 12.2% were graduate students. As of May 2018, 1,352 students had graduated during the immediately preceding summer, fall and spring semesters. History =Founding= Signers' Hall The University of Alaska Fairbanks was established in 1917 as the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines, but its origins lie in the creation of a federal agricultural experiment station in Fairbanks in 1906.Catalogue of the Public Documents of the Fifty-ninth Congress and Other Departments of the Government of the United States for the Period from July 1, 1905, to June 30, 1907. Vol. 112, p. 1364.https://books.google.com/books?id=LB0oAAAAYAAJ&source;=gbs_navlinks_s The station set the tone for the strongly research-oriented university that developed later.Davis, Neil (1992, p. 39) The College Hill Chronicles: how the University of Alaska came of Age. Fairbanks, Alaska: University of Alaska Foundation. In the spring of 1915, the U.S. Congress approved legislation that reserved about 2,250 acres of land for a campus around the research station. It also allowed the federal government to give the college land that had been surveyed and unclaimed in the Tanana Valley; the proceeds from the sale and development were supposed to help fund the operation of the college. However, because most of the land in Tanana Valley remained unsurveyed for years, the college only received 12,000 acres. In 1929, Congress attempted to remedy the situation by granting the college an additional 100,000 acres anywhere in Alaska, but those rights were extinguished in 1959 when Alaska became a state.Cole, Terrence (1994, p. 6) The Cornerstone on College Hill: an Illustrated History of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Fairbanks, Alaska: University of Alaska Press. Four months after Congress approved the legislation for the campus land in 1915, a cornerstone for the college was laid by Territorial Delegate James Wickersham on a bluff overlooking the lower Chena River valley. The ridge, which the indigenous Athabaskan people called Troth Yeddha', soon became known as College Hill. Charles E. Bunnell was appointed the university‚Äôs chief executive and served the university for 28 years. Classes began at the new institution on September 18, 1922. It offered 16 different courses to a student body of six (at a ratio of one faculty member per student) on opening day. In 1923, the first commencement produced one graduate, John Sexton Shanly.Cole, Terrence (1994, p. 7, 37 - 40) The Cornerstone on College Hill: an Illustrated History of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Fairbanks, Alaska: University of Alaska Press In 1935, the Alaska Legislature passed a bill that officially changed the name of the college to the University of Alaska. When William R. Wood became the university‚Äôs president in 1960, he divided the academic departments of the university into six select colleges: Arts and Letters; Behavioral Sciences and Education; Biological Sciences and Renewable Resources; Business, Economics, and Government; Earth Sciences and Mineral Industry; and Mathematics, Physical Sciences, and Engineering. From that point on, both the university‚Äôs student population and research mission grew tremendously. With the appointment of Chancellor Howard A. Cutler in 1975, the University of Alaska became the University of Alaska Fairbanks; it was, and still is, the primary research unit of the statewide university system.Cole, Terrence (1994, p. 55, 206 - 208) The Cornerstone on College Hill: an Illustrated History of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Fairbanks, Alaska: University of Alaska Press. The two other primary UA institutions are the University of Alaska Anchorage and the University of Alaska Southeast in Juneau. =Significant events= The Alaska Constitutional Convention was held in the freshly constructed Student Union Building on the Fairbanks campus from November 1955 to February 1956. While the convention progressed, the building became known as Constitution Hall, where the 55 delegates drafted the legal foundation of the 49th state. The campus‚Äô old library and gymnasium was renamed Signers‚Äô Hall after the Alaska Constitution was signed there in February 1956.Cole, Terrence (1994, p. 152 - 154) The Cornerstone on College Hill: an Illustrated History of the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

Rasmuson Library **The Alaska Film Archives, housed in the library's Alaska and Polar Regions Collections and Archives, holds the largest collection of film-related material about Alaska. **BioSciences Library (permanently closed as of June 2014) *Keith B. Mather Library (housed in the International Arctic Research Center) = Research units = UAF is Alaska's primary research university, conducting more than 90% of UA system research. Research activities are organized into several institutes and centers: *the Geophysical Institute, established in 1946 by an act of Congress, specializes in seismology, volcanology and aeronomy, among other fields. *the International Arctic Research Center researches the circumpolar North and the causes and effects of climate change. *the Institute of Northern Engineering, an arm of the College of Engineering and Mines, conducts research in many different areas of engineering. *the Research Computing Systems unit, located within the Geophysical Institute, is the high-performance computing unit of UAF. *the Alaska Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station conducts research focused on solving problems related to agriculture and forest sciences. *the Institute of Arctic Biology conducts research focused on high-latitude biological systems. *the Robert G. White Large Animal Research Station conducts long-term research with muskoxen, reindeer and cattle. *the Institute of Marine Science, a branch of the College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences, investigates topics in oceanography, marine biology, and fisheries. *the research vessel Sikuliaq, a 261-foot ice-resistant ship outfitted with modern scientific equipment, is operated by the College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences for the National Science Foundation. Student life =Housing= UAF has several student residence halls on both lower and middle Fairbanks campus. Housing is offered year-round. All halls are smoke-free, as is the entire campus. Each hall has a kitchen, laundry facility, exterior door hall access system and maintenance services. The halls vary from each other slightly to suit different preferences of the student population. Additional housing locations on campus are available to graduates, families, employees and nontraditional students. =Representation= The Associated Students of the University of Alaska Fairbanks (ASUAF) is the representative group for the students attending UAF. Each student enrolled in three or more in-person credit-hours pays a $42 student government fee for the fall and spring semesters; this money funds ASUAF. The income is divided among the student government, KSUA Radio, the concert board and a student-run newspaper called The Sun Star. ASUAF holds general elections every November and April. As per the ASUAF Constitution, there is a president, a vice president and no more than 20 senators, all of whom must be in good academic standing (2.0+ CGPA). Senators, the president and the vice president have terms of one full academic year.  Athletics  Alaska vs. Air Force ice hockey game University of Alaska Fairbanks sports teams are the Alaska Nanooks, with the word Nanook derived from the Inupiaq word for \\"polar bear.\\" Though often known as UAF within the state, the university prefers to be called simply \\"Alaska\\" for athletics purposes. The school colors are blue and gold. The Alaska Nanooks compete at the NCAA Division I level in hockey as a member of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association. The Nanooks play home games at the 4,500-seat Carlson Center, located in downtown Fairbanks. The Alaska Nanooks also have a Division I rifle team which has won 10 NCAA National Rifle Championships (1994, 1999‚Äì2004, 2006‚Äì2008). The rifle team is a member of the Patriot Rifle Conference. The men's and women's basketball, cross country running, and women's volleyball teams are Division II members of the Great Northwest Athletic Conference, while the women's swim team is a member of the Pacific Collegiate Swimming Conference (PCSC), and the men's and women's Nordic skiing teams are members of the Rocky Mountain Intercollegiate Ski Association (RMISA). The men's basketball team, women's basketball team, and women's volleyball team play home games in the 1,622-seat Patty Center. Due to its isolation from the Lower 48 and the lack of a dome to protect against the harsh elements, Alaska does not have a football program, as is true for all three branches of the University of Alaska. Since the UAF athletics program was operating at a financial deficit, a new student fee was initiated in 2008. This fee charges UAF students $10 per credit hour they are enrolled in, up to a maximum of $120 per semester. The fee grants students free admission to select UAF athletic events. In fiscal year 2010, the department was able to meet financial obligations without additional year-end funding for the first time. The department has increased scholarships for women by 95% since 2005, and was recognized by The Chronicle of Higher Education for Title IX compliance in an article titled \\"Turnaround Stories.\\"  Publishing  There are several book publishers at UAF, including the University of Alaska Press, the Alaska Native Language Center, Alaska Sea Grant, the University of Alaska Museum of the North, UAF Cooperative Extension Service, and the Alaska Native Knowledge Network. The University of Alaska Foundation also publishes books. Serial publications include: *Aurora, produced once annually by UAF University Relations *Agroborealis, produced twice annually by the School of Natural Resources and Extension *Ice Box, the UAF student literary magazine *Permafrost, the UAF English Department's literary journal *The Alumnus, the UAF Alumni Association newsletter, published twice annually The student newspaper is titled The Sun Star, formed after a merger of The Polar Star, an independent student paper, and The Northern Sun, the journalism department's student newspaper.  Arts  The Fine Arts Complex hosts the Charles Davis Concert Hall, the Lee H. Salisbury Theatre and the Eva McGown Music Room. The building is also home to the UAF Art Gallery, which is used for student art shows, thesis shows and faculty shows. The Reichardt Building was completed in 1994 is a three-story 117,435-square-foot steel-frame structure that features an extensive artwork collection.

During the Edo period, the area was noted for raising ornamental goldfish. During the Meiji period, the area was organized into villages under Kasai District, Aichi Prefecture, with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. Kasai District later became Ama District, Aichi. Yatomi was proclaimed a town on August 26, 1903. The Isewan Typhoon of September 26, 1959 created extensive damage to the area. Efforts to merge Yatomi with the neighboring town of Kanie failed in 2004 over a dispute on the naming of the new entity. The city of Yatomi was founded on April 1, 2006, from the merger between the former town of Yatomi, absorbing the village of J≈´shiyama (both from Ama District).

Accessed on 11 February 2009. Archived on 11 February 2009. The ninth album by Manic Street Preachers, Journal for Plague Lovers, released on 18 May 2009, is composed entirely of songs with lyrics left behind by Edwards. As of 2005, the remaining members of Manic Street Preachers were still paying 25% royalties into an account in his name. Biography Richard James Edwards was born and raised in Blackwood, Wales to Graham and Sherry Edwards, who married in 1966. He had one younger sister, Rachel (born 1969), with whom he was close. Edwards attended Oakdale Comprehensive School. From 1986 to 1989, he attended University of Wales, Swansea and graduated with a 2:1 degree in political history. The Edwards family lived in Blackwood. He met Nicky Wire, Sean Moore and James Dean Bradfield at Oakdale Comprehensive School. Career Edwards was initially a driver and roadie for Manic Street Preachers, but he soon became accepted as the band's main spokesman and fourth member in 1989. Edwards showed little musical talent ‚Äî his real contribution to the band was in their lyrics and design. He frequently mimed playing the guitar during early live performances, but was, along with bassist Nicky Wire, principal lyricist. Edwards is said to have written approximately 80% of the lyrics on their third album, The Holy Bible. Both are credited on all songs written before Edwards' disappearance, with Edwards receiving sole credit on three tracks from the 1996 album Everything Must Go, and co-writing credits on another two. Despite Edwards' lack of musical input, he nevertheless contributed to their overall musical direction, and according to the rest of the band on the Everything Must Go DVD, he played a leading role in deciding the approach of the band's sound. Edwards expressed a desire to create a concept album described as \\"Pantera meets Nine Inch Nails meets Screamadelica\\".Bailie, Stuart. \\"The Art of Falling Apart\\". Mojo (February 2002). p.85. However, lead guitarist/vocalist James Dean Bradfield has since expressed doubts over whether the band would have produced such an album: \\"I was worried that as chief tune-smith in the band I wasn't actually going to be able to write things that he would have liked. There would have been an impasse in the band for the first time born out of taste...\\"Maconie, Stuart \\"Everything Must Grow Up\\" Q Magazine October 1998 Edwards with 4 Real carved into his arm. The NME discussion as to whether to publish this image was a bonus track on \\"Suicide Is Painless\\". On 15 May 1991, Edwards gained notoriety following an argument with NME journalist Steve Lamacq, who questioned the band's authenticity and values, keen to ensure the punk ethic was not abused, after a gig at the Norwich Arts Centre. Lamacq asked of Edwards' seriousness towards his art, and Edwards responded by carving the words \\"4 Real\\" into his forearm with a razor blade he was carrying. The injury required eighteen stitches. Edwards suffered severe bouts of depression in his adult life,Leonard, Marion. Gender in the Music Industry (2007), Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. p.71. and was open about it in interviews.Smith, Richard (1995) Seduced and Abandoned: Essays on Gay Men and Popular Music, London: Cassell. He also self-harmed, mainly through stubbing cigarettes on his arms and cutting himself: \\"When I cut myself I feel so much better. All the little things that might have been annoying me suddenly seem so trivial because I'm concentrating on the pain. I'm not a person who can scream and shout so this is my only outlet. It's all done very logically.\\". He suffered from insomnia and used alcohol to help him sleep at night. Before the release of The Holy Bible in 1994, he checked into Whitchurch Hospital and later The Priory, missing out on some of the promotional work for the album and forcing the band to appear as a three piece at the Reading Festival and T in the Park. Following release from the Priory in September, Manic Street Preachers toured Europe as a four-piece band with Suede and Therapy? for what was to be the last time. Edwards' final live appearance with the band was at the London Astoria, on 21 December 1994. The concert ended with the band infamously smashing their equipment and damaging the lighting system, prompted by Edwards' violent destruction of his guitar towards the end of set closer \\"You Love Us\\". On 23 January 1995, Edwards gave his last interview to Japanese music magazine Music Life. http://articles.richeyedwards.net/may95select2.html Disappearance Edwards disappeared on 1 February 1995, on the day when he and Bradfield were due to fly to the United States on a promotional tour of The Holy Bible.Price (1999), pp. 177‚Äì178. In the two weeks before his disappearance, Edwards withdrew ¬£200 a day from his bank account, which totalled ¬£2,800 by the day of the scheduled flight. Some speculated that he needed the money for the U.S. trip, and it was also mentioned he had ordered a new desk for his flat from a shop in Cardiff. However, there was no record of the desk having been paid for, and this would have explained only half of the money withdrawn.Price (1999), p. 178. According to Emma Forrest, as quoted in A Version of Reason, \\"The night before he disappeared Edwards gave a friend a book called Novel with Cocaine, instructing her to read the introduction, which details the author staying in a mental asylum before vanishing.\\" Whilst staying at the Embassy Hotel in Bayswater Road, London, according to Rob Jovanovic's biography, Edwards removed some books and videos from his bag. Among them was a copy of the play Equus. Edwards wrapped them carefully in a box with a note that said \\"I love you\\", then decorated the box like a birthday present and decorated the outside of it with collages and literary quotations. These included a picture of a Germanic-looking house and Bugs Bunny. The package was addressed to Edwards' on/off girlfriend, Jo, whom he met some years prior, although they had split a few weeks earlier.https://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/a-floating-question-mark The next morning, Edwards collected his wallet, car keys, some Prozac and his passport. He reportedly checked out of the hotel at 7:00 a.m., leaving his toiletries, packed suitcase, and some of his Prozac. He then drove to his flat in Cardiff, leaving behind his passport, his Prozac and the Severn Bridge tollbooth receipt.Price (1999), p. 179. In the two weeks that followed, Edwards was apparently spotted in the Newport passport officePrice (1999), p. 183. and at Newport bus station by a fan who was unaware that he was missing. The fan was reported to have discussed a mutual friend, Lori Fidler, before Edwards departed.Price (1999), p. 180. On 7 February, a taxi driver from Newport supposedly picked up Edwards from the King's Hotel, and drove him around the valleys, including Edwards' hometown of Blackwood. The driver reported that the passenger had spoken in a Cockney accent, which occasionally slipped into a Welsh one, and that he had asked if he could lie down on the back seat. Eventually they reached Blackwood and the bus station, but the passenger reportedly said \\"this is not the place\\", and asked to be taken to Pontypool railway station. It was later ascertained, according to Jovanovic's account, that Pontypool did not have a telephone. The passenger got out at the Severn View service station near Aust, South Gloucestershire and paid the ¬£68 fare in cash. On 14 February, Edwards' Vauxhall Cavalier received a parking ticket at the Severn View service station, and on 17 February, the vehicle was reported as abandoned. Police discovered the battery to be dead, with evidence that the car had been lived in. The car also had photos he had taken of his family days prior. Due to the service station's proximity to the Severn Bridge, a known suicide site,Pidd, Helen. \\"Richey Edwards case closed: how 14 years of hope ended\\", The Guardian. 29 November 2008. it was widely believed that Edwards had jumped from the bridge. Many people who knew Edwards, however, have said that he was never the type to contemplate suicide and he himself was quoted in 1994 as saying, \\"In terms of the 'S' word, that does not enter my mind. And it never has done, in terms of an attempt. Because I am stronger than that. I might be a weak person, but I can take pain\\". Since then, Edwards has reportedly been spotted in a market in Goa, India, and on the islands of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. There have been other alleged sightings of Edwards, especially in the years immediately following his disappearance. However, none of these has proved conclusive and none have been confirmed by investigators.Price (1999), pp. 183‚Äì185. In 2018, it was revealed that the bridge's toll receipt was a 24-hour clock, meaning he would have crossed the bridge at 2:55am, rather than 2:55pm as previously thought for 23 years. The investigation itself has received criticism. In his 1999 book Everything (A Book About Manic Street Preachers), Simon Price states that aspects of the investigation were \\"far from satisfactory\\". He asserts the police may not have taken Edwards' mental state into account when prioritising his disappearance, and also records Edwards' sister Rachel as having \\"hit out at police handling\\" after CCTV footage was analysed two years after Edwards vanished.Price (1999), p. 186. Price records a member of the investigation team as stating \\"that the idea that you could identify somebody from that is arrant nonsense\\".Price (1999), p. 187. While his family had the option of declaring him legally dead from 2002 onwards, they chose not to for many years, and his status remained open as a missing person until 23 November 2008, when he became officially \\"presumed dead\\". =Legacy= Edwards' disappearance attracted a great deal of media attention. Caitlin Moran, writing in The Times, commented that Edwards became \\"a cause celebre among depressives, alcoholics, anorexics, and self-mutilators, because he was the first person in the public eye to talk openly about these subjects, not with swaggering bravado and a subtext of 'look how tortured and cool I am', but with humility, sense and, often, bleak humour\\".\\"Cries that won't go away\\" The Times (London); 21 April 1995; Caitlin Moran; p. 1 Moran dismissed the mainstream media's narrative, which was geared towards the idea that Edwards inspired copycat actions in fans. Pointing towards the 8 April 1995 edition of Melody Maker, Moran wrote of her distaste of the media treatment: \\"Arms were flung aloft and tongues tutted two weeks back, when the first anniversary of Kurt Cobain's suicide coincided with the two-month marking of Manic Street Preacher Richey Edwards' disappearance, and Melody Maker instigated a debate on escalating teenage depression, self-mutilation and suicide.\\" The magazine had received a number of letters from fans distressed at both the death of Kurt Cobain and the disappearance of Edwards. The 8 April edition saw Melody Maker assemble a panel of readers to discuss the issues related to both cases. Moran argued \\"that Cobain's actions and, to a greater extent, Richey Edwards's actions, have legitimised debate on these subjects\\". The 8 April issue was released in conjunction with the Samaritans,\\"Pop paper responds to fans' cry of grief;Melody Maker\\" The Times (London); 22 March 1995; Dalya Alberge; p. 1 with then-editor Allan Jones placing the inspiration for the special nature of the issue firmly in the hands of the readers: \\"Every week the mailbag is just full of these letters. Richey's predicament seems to be emblematic of what a lot of people are going through.\\"\\"Is this music to die for? When the postbag at Melody Maker is opened these days, out pours a bleak litany of angst and agony. Andrew Smith looks at the dangerous, unprecedented trend of young pop music fans identifying closely with the torment of their heroes\\" The Guardian; 31 March 1995; ANDREW SMITH; p. T.002 Jones saw the debate as focusing on the notion of whether \\"our rock stars are more vulnerable these days, and is that vulnerability a reflection of the vulnerability of their audience? And if so, why?\\"  Literature and other cultural influences  As well as an interest in music, Edwards displayed a love for literature. He chose many of the quotes that appear on Manics record sleeves and would often refer to writers and poets during interviews. This interest in literature has remained integral to the band's music and lyrics. Albert Camus, Philip Larkin, Yukio Mishima, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Arthur Rimbaud are known to have been among his favourite authors. In a dressing room interview, he also mentioned admiration for Primo Levi. Edwards' lyrics have often been of a highly poetic nature and at times they reflected his knowledge of political history. Books about Edwards In 2009, Rob Jovanovic's book A Version of Reason: The Search for Richey Edwards of the Manic Street Preachers was published. The book was written with the goal of providing an authoritative factual account, pieced together through testimonials from those close to Edwards before his disappearance. A novel by Ben Myers, entitled Richard: A Novel, was published on 1 October 2010 through Picador. Richard purports to be a fictionalised account of Edwards' life \\"as he might have told it.\\" A 2015 novel by Guy Mankowski, entitled How I Left The National Grid, was heavily informed by Edwards and his disappearance. Howard Marks has also written a book about Edwards, Sympathy for the Devil, although his name has been changed to fictionalise the story. In 2019, Sara Hawys Roberts and Leon Noakes published Withdrawn Traces: Searching for the Truth About Richey Manic, a book that claimed to provide fresh evidence that Edwards staged the disappearance. The book was published with consent from Edwards' sister, Rachel Edwards, who also wrote the foreword.

After the Meiji Restoration, the area became the short-lived \\"Nukata Prefecture\\", which was then merged into Aichi Prefecture. In the cadastral reforms of the early Meiji period, on October 1, 1889, Nukata District was divided into one town (Okazaki) and 26 villages. Fukuoka village was raised to town status on November 8, 1893, followed by Hirohata village on May 13, 1895. In a round of consolidation in May 1906, the remaining number of villages was reduced from 24 to 15. Hirohata Town was annexed by Okazaki on October 1, 1914. Okazaki attained city status on July 1, 1916. The village of Iwatsu became a town on September 1, 1928 and later the same year, three neighboring villages were annexed by Okazaki, leaving the district with two towns and 11villages. Following World War II, on April 1, 1952 the village of K≈çta gained town status. On August 1, 1954 the village of Toyosaka from Hazu District merged into the town of K≈çta. The towns of Iwatsu and Fukuoka, and the villages of Motojuku, Yamanaka, Fujikawa, Ryudani, and Tokiwa merged into the city of Okazaki on February 1, 1955, and on September 30, 1956 the villages of Toyotomi, Miyazaki, Katano, and parts of Shimoyama merged to form the town of Nukata. Despite pressure from the central government, on November 14, 2003 K≈çta declined to participate the Okazaki- Nukata Region Merger Conference. As a result of this Conference, on January 1, 2006 Nukata merged into the city of Okazaki, leaving K≈çta as the only remaining portion of Nukata District.

Formed in 1998 by All Saints manager Ron Tom, they released their debut album One Touch through London Records in November 2000, which achieved moderate success and spawned the top ten single \\"Overload\\". In 2001, Donaghy departed the group and was replaced by Heidi Range. With Range's introduction, the group began to experience a higher level of commercial success, going on to release three multi-platinum selling albums: Angels with Dirty Faces (2002), Three (2003) and Taller in More Ways (2005). In 2005, Buena left the band and was replaced by Amelle Berrabah. Following the release of their first greatest hits album, the new line-up released two further studio albums: Change (2007) and Catfights and Spotlights (2008). In September 2009, after 11 years in the Sugababes, Buchanan, the final original member, was replaced by former UK Eurovision entry Jade Ewen. Range, Berrabah and Ewen released the group's seventh studio album, Sweet 7 (2010), after which they signed to RCA Records, before taking an indefinite hiatus in 2011; the same year, the original line-up of the band reformed as Mutya Keisha Siobhan and released the single \\"Flatline\\". Following another hiatus, the trio regained the name Sugababes in September 2019 and recorded a rendition of the song \\"Flowers\\" along with DJ Spoony.

History =1998‚Äì2001: Formation, One Touch and Siobhan Donaghy's departure = The Sugababes were formed in 1998 by All Saints manager Ron Tom and Sarah Stennett and First Access Entertainment. Siobh√°n Donaghy and Mutya Buena, both aged just 13, had been signed as solo artists, but decided to work together after performing at the same showcase. While working in the studio, Buena invited her best friend Keisha Buchanan to watch them. Manager Ron Tom decided the three girls were to be a trio, likening their different appearances to the United Colors of Benetton campaign. Originally dubbed the Sugababies, the group's name was tweaked to Sugababes when they were signed by London Records to give the group a more mature image. The group's debut single, \\"Overload\\", peaked at number 6 on the UK Singles Chart in 2000 and was nominated for a BRIT Award for Best Single. The group co-wrote most of the tracks on debut album One Touch with the help of All Saints producer Cameron McVey. One Touch peaked at number 26 on the UK Albums Chart. The album produced three more top 40 hits‚Äî\\"New Year\\", \\"Run for Cover\\" and \\"Soul Sound\\".

Donaghy later stated that she was forced out of the group by Buchanan and called Buchanan the \\"first bully\\" in her life. Former Atomic Kitten member Heidi Range replaced Donaghy. =2002‚Äì2004: Growing commercial success with Angels with Dirty Faces and Three= Having already started work on a second album with new member Range, the trio looked for a new record label, eventually signing to Island Records.

Around this time, the group's perceived \\"moodiness\\", alleged backstage catfights, and press junket tantrums were tabloid fodder in Britain. They were surrounded by continuous rumours of in-fighting within the group and constant split reports. Rumours suggested that Buchanan and Buena had bullied Range, although Range herself repeatedly denied such allegations; Buena later admitted that she \\"just didn't talk to her\\" when she first joined. According to Buchanan, there was only one serious fallout between herself and Range during a 2004 gig in Dublin, a disagreement around Britney Spears's song \\"Toxic\\". =2005‚Äì2006: Taller in More Ways, Mutya Buena's departure and Overloaded: The Singles Collection= After a hiatus, the Sugababes released their thirteenth single, \\"Push the Button\\" in October 2005.

According to the band's official website, Buena's decision was based purely on personal reasons following the birth of her daughter. Amelle Berrabah joined the Sugababes in late December 2005, having been chosen by the group's management to replace Buena. The third single from Taller in More Ways was a re-recorded version of \\"Red Dress\\", which was released in early 2006, and gave the Sugababes their third consecutive top five hit from the album, entering the UK Singles Chart at number 4. Berrabah re-recorded three of the album's twelve tracks and co- wrote a new song with Buchanan and Range named \\"Now You're Gone\\".

It remained atop the UK Singles Chart for four weeks. \\"About You Now\\" was nominated for a 2008 BRIT Award for Best British Single and is to date their highest-selling single, with sales standing at almost 500,000 copies. In the 2009 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records, \\"About You Now\\" was listed as the \\"first track by a British pop act to top the singles chart solely on downloads\\".

Its second and final single, \\"No Can Do\\", was released in December and peaked at number 23 in the UK. In January 2009, the Performing Right Society named Sugababes the fourth hardest-working band of 2008 due to the number of concerts they had performed during that year. =2009‚Äì2010: Buchanan's departure and Sweet 7= After the release of \\"No Can Do\\", the group decided not go on tour in 2009 and instead focus on writing and recording material for their seventh studio album. The Sugababes travelled to the United States to work on their seventh studio album, Sweet 7. In April 2009, the Sugababes signed a contract with Jay-Z's label Roc Nation, resulting in working with high profile producers.

The application was submitted amid the controversy of Buchanan's departure, in which Buena insisted that \\"the Sugababes have ended\\" without a founding member still in the group. It was confirmed that Buena had obtained rights to use the name on paper, cardboard and goods; namely stationery, paper gift wrap and paper gift wrapping ribbons. In the same month the group was dropped by Roc Nation, due to poor sales of Sweet 7. =2011: Cancelled eighth album and disbandment= The Sugababes initially began recording an eighth studio album in April 2010. In June 2011, the group and their managers Sarah Stennett and Mark Hargreaves Crown Music Management Services left their record label of ten years, Island Records, for a new three-album distribution deal with Sony Music's RCA Records, with Crown Music Management Services as the acting record label. In July, the Sugababes commented on their new album, saying: \\"It's a bit darker, tougher and quite edgy.\\" In another interview, the group stated the new album showcased their personalities. At the Wireless Festival in London, Buchanan, who left the band in 2009, approached the current line-up and the girls were reported to have a \\"tear-eyed\\" reunion and put the past behind them. It was the first time in two years that she had seen former comrades Range and Berrabah, as well as the first time she had officially met her 'replacement' Jade Ewen. In a later interview, Buchanan revealed that she was disappointed by the treatment she received back in 2009, but went on to wish the current line-up \\"the best of luck\\". Their first and only single under the new label, \\"Freedom\\", was released for free on 25 September 2011. Afterward, the group began a hiatus to work on solo projects: Range participated in the seventh series of Dancing on Ice, Berrabah worked on solo material and Ewen competed as a contestant on the first series of Splash! In March 2013, Ewen stated that the Sugababes would \\"probably come back together again at the end of the year. There will definitely be more recording, but there is no release date anytime soon.\\" and in May, Berrabah said the group had been writing songs for their new album and hoped to release new music in 2014. However, later the same year, Ewen expressed her feelings towards the Sugababes' future being uncertain, stating they're \\"pretty much done\\", which led to reports suggesting the group have split. This was initially denied by Berrabah, who stated she believed the band would get back together in late 2014, but in September 2013, an interview was published quoting Ewen confirming that the group had split two years prior. She was quoted saying \\"This is a tricky one because I don't feel comfortable lying, saying we're in the studio recording and we're going to bring music out next year, which seems to be the favoured line. I think it's unfair to fans and we should be honest. (...) We kind of fizzled out about two years ago. I do think the lineup changes have obviously got to be a factor, you can't get away from it.\\" In January 2014, Range contradicted Ewen's statement, saying that the group was merely on hiatus as they follow solo projects. Speaking on if they'd broken up or not, Range stated, \\"Not officially but we don't have any plans for anything in the near future.\\" In March 2019, Berrabah revealed that the Sugababes have been approached several times about reforming to do a tour which she hinted as a final goodbye to the fans. In July, in an interview with Irish broadcaster RT√â, she said that there have been discussions about a reunion tour featuring all six members of the group. =2012‚Äì2014: Original lineup reformation as Mutya Keisha Siobhan= In October 2011, several news outlets reported that the original line-up of the Sugababes would reform. In January 2012, further speculations circulated that the group would reunite were sparked, after both Buena and Buchanan tweeted that they were in the studio with \\"two other females\\" and British rapper Professor Green. However, Buena later denied this on Twitter, saying: \\"No track [with] keisha or professor G he was around tha studio. im jus workin on my stuff @ tha moment. (sic)\\" Despite this, Scottish singer-songwriter Emeli Sand√© confirmed to MTV UK that she had written new songs for Buena, Buchanan and Donaghy, saying: \\"Yes, that is true. I've written for the original line-up of the Sugababes, which I‚Äôm very happy about because I just loved them when they first came out. I loved their sound, it was so cool. It was very different, so I'm happy to kind of be involved in what started the whole Sugababes journey.

Buena also suggested new material would be released in September. In August 2018, Buchanan revealed a snippet of a new song on her Instagram story and hinted that the group had regained their original 'Sugababes' name by stating she was \\"not an ex-Sugababe\\".

It initially consisted of four musicians ‚Äì Graham Gouldman, Eric Stewart, Kevin Godley and Lol Creme ‚Äì who had written and recorded together since 1968. The group featured two songwriting teams. Stewart and Gouldman were predominantly pop songwriters, who created most of the band's accessible songs. By contrast, Godley and Creme were the predominantly experimental half of 10cc, featuring art and cinematically-inspired writing. Every member of 10cc was a multi- instrumentalist, singer, writer and producer. Most of the band's records were recorded at their own Strawberry Studios (North) in Stockport and Strawberry Studios (South) in Dorking, with most of those engineered by Stewart. From 1972 to 1978, 10cc had five consecutive UK top-ten albums: Sheet Music, The Original Soundtrack (1975), How Dare You! (1976), Deceptive Bends (1977) and Bloody Tourists (1978). They also had twelve singles reach the UK Top 40, three of which were the chart-toppers \\"Rubber Bullets\\" (1973), \\"I'm Not in Love\\" (1975) and \\"Dreadlock Holiday\\" (1978). \\"I'm Not in Love\\" was their breakthrough worldwide hit and is known for its innovative backing track. Godley and Creme quit the band in 1976 due to artistic disagreements and became a duo act. Stewart left the band in 1995. Since 1999, Gouldman has led a touring version of 10cc. First collaborations Three of the founding members of 10cc were childhood friends in the Manchester area. As boys, Godley and Creme knew each other; Gouldman and Godley attended the same secondary school; their musical enthusiasm led to playing at the local Jewish Lads' Brigade.Lester, Paul \\"Heirs to The Beatles: The story of 10cc\\". The Jewish Chronicle =1964‚Äì1969: Early bands= Their first recorded collaboration was in 1964, when Gouldman's band The Whirlwinds recorded the Lol Creme composition, \\"Baby Not Like You\\", as the B-side of their only single, \\"Look At Me\\". The Whirlwinds then changed members and name, becoming The Mockingbirds (including singer-guitarist Gouldman, bassist Bernard Basso and drummer Kevin Godley, formerly of The Sabres with Creme). The Mockingbirds recorded five singles in 1965‚Äì66 without any success, before dissolving. The guitarist in both The Whirlwinds and The Mockingbirds was Stephen Jacobson, brother of well-known writer Howard Jacobson.Egan, Shaun (2004), The Guys Who Wrote 'em: Songwriting Geniuses of Rock and Pop, Askill Publishing, , Graham Gouldman. In June 1967, Godley and Creme reunited and recorded a solitary single (\\"Seeing Things Green\\" b/w \\"Easy Life\\" on UK CBS) under the name \\"The Yellow Bellow Room Boom\\". In 1969, Gouldman took them to a Marmalade Records recording session. The boss, Giorgio Gomelsky, was impressed with Godley's falsetto voice and offered them a recording contract. In September 1969, Godley & Creme recorded some basic tracks at Strawberry Studios, with Stewart on guitar and Gouldman on bass. The song, \\"I'm Beside Myself\\" b/w \\"Animal Song\\", was issued as a single, credited to Frabjoy and Runcible Spoon. Gomelsky (an ex-manager of The Yardbirds) planned to market Godley & Creme as a duo, in the vein of Simon & Garfunkel.Liner notes to Strawberry Bubblegum CD, written by David Wells, June 2003 Plans for an album by Frabjoy and Runcible Spoon faltered, however, when Marmalade ran out of funds. Solo tracks by Godley and Gouldman, however - both involved Stewart and Creme ‚Äì were released on a 1969 Marmalade Records compilation album, 100 Proof. Gouldman's track was \\"The Late Mr. Late\\"; a year later, Godley's song \\"To Fly Away\\" reappeared as \\"Fly Away\\", in the debut Hotlegs album, Thinks: School Stinks. Gouldman, meanwhile, had made a name for himself as a hit songwriter, penning \\"Heart Full of Soul\\", \\"Evil Hearted You\\" and \\"For Your Love\\" for The Yardbirds, \\"Look Through Any Window\\" and \\"Bus Stop\\" for The Hollies and \\"No Milk Today\\", \\"East West\\" and \\"Listen People\\" for Herman's Hermits. =1965‚Äì1968: The Mindbenders= Meanwhile, the fourth future member of 10cc was also tasting significant pop music success: guitarist Eric Stewart was a member of Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders, a group that hit No.1 with \\"The Game of Love\\", and scored a number of other mid-1960s hits. When Fontana left the band in October 1965, the group became known simply as The Mindbenders, with Stewart as their lead vocalist. The band scored a hit with \\"A Groovy Kind of Love\\" (released December 1965) and made an appearance in the 1967 film To Sir, with Love with \\"It's Getting Harder All the Time\\" and \\"Off and Running.\\" In March 1968, Gouldman joined Stewart in The Mindbenders, replacing bassist Bob Lang and playing on some tour dates. Gouldman wrote two of the band's last three singles, \\"Schoolgirl\\" (released November 1967) and \\"Uncle Joe the Ice Cream Man\\" (August 1968). Those singles did not chart and The Mindbenders broke up after a short tour of England in November. =1968‚Äì1970: Birth of Strawberry Studios; the bubblegum era= In the dying days of The Mindbenders, Stewart began recording demos of new material at Inner City Studios, a Stockport studio then owned by Peter Tattersall, a former road manager for Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas. In July 1968, Stewart joined Tattersall as a partner in the studio, where he could further hone his skills as a recording engineer.Eric Stewart comment on his website In October 1968, the studio was moved to bigger premises and renamed Strawberry Studios, after The Beatles' \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\".Eric Stewart comment on his website In 1969, Gouldman also began using Strawberry to record demos of songs he was writing for Marmalade. He had become much more in demand as a songwriter than as a performer. By the end of the year, he too was a financial partner in the studios. By 1969, all four members of the original 10cc line-up were working together regularly at Strawberry Studios. Around the same time, noted American bubblegum pop writer-producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeffry Katz of Super K Productions came to England and commissioned Gouldman to write and produce formula bubblegum songs, many of which were recorded at Strawberry Studios, and were either augmented or performed entirely by varying combinations of the future 10cc line-up. Among the recordings from this period was \\"Sausalito\\", a No. 86 US hit credited to Ohio Express and released in July 1969. In fact the song featured Gouldman on lead vocal, and vocal and instrumental backing by the other three future 10cc members. In December 1969, Kasenetz and Katz agreed to a proposal by Gouldman that he work solely at Strawberry, rather than move constantly between Stockport, London and New York. Gouldman convinced the pair that these throwaway two-minute songs could all be written, performed and produced by him and his three colleagues, Stewart, Godley and Creme, at a fraction of the cost of hiring outside session musicians. Kasenetz and Katz booked the studio for three months. Kevin Godley recalled: > We did a lot of tracks in a very short time ‚Äì it was really like a machine. > Twenty tracks in about two weeks ‚Äì a lot of crap really ‚Äì really shit. We > used to do the voices, everything ‚Äì it saved 'em money. We even did the > female backing vocals. The three-month project resulted in a number of tracks that appeared under various band names owned by Kasenetz-Katz, including \\"There Ain't No Umbopo\\" by Crazy Elephant, \\"When He Comes\\" by Fighter Squadron and \\"Come on Plane\\" by Silver Fleet (all three with lead vocals by Godley), and \\"Susan's Tuba\\" by Freddie and the Dreamers (which was a monster hit in France and featured lead vocals by Freddie Garrity, despite claims by some that it was Gouldman). Lol Creme remembered: \\"Singles kept coming out under strange names that had really been recorded by us. I've no idea how many there were, or what happened to them all.\\" But Stewart described the Kasenetz-Katz deal as a breakthrough: \\"That allowed us to get the extra equipment to turn it into a real studio. To begin with they were interested in Graham's songwriting and when they heard that he was involved in a studio I think they thought the most economical thing for them to do would be to book his studio and then put him to work there ‚Äì but they ended up recording Graham's songs and then some of Kevin and Lol's songs, and we were all working together.\\" =1970‚Äì1971: Hotlegs; Doctor Father; The New Wave Band; Festival= When the three-month production deal with Kasenetz-Katz ended, Gouldman returned to New York to work as a staff songwriter for Super K Productions and the remaining three continued to dabble in the studio. With Gouldman absent, Godley, Creme and Stewart continued recording singles. The first, \\"Neanderthal Man\\", released under the name Hotlegs, began life as a test of drum layering at the new Strawberry Studios mixing desk, but when released as a single by Fontana Records in July 1970, climbed to No. 2 in the UK charts and became a worldwide hit, selling more than two million copies. Around the same time, the trio released \\"Umbopo\\" under the name of Doctor Father. The song, a slower, longer and more melancholic version of the track earlier released under the name of Crazy Elephant, failed to chart. Reverting to the successful band name Hotlegs, in early 1971 Godley, Creme and Stewart recorded the album Thinks: School Stinks, which included \\"Neanderthal Man\\". They then recalled Gouldman for a short tour supporting The Moody Blues, before releasing a follow-up single \\"Lady Sadie\\" b/w \\"The Loser\\". Philips reworked their sole album, removed \\"Neanderthal Man\\" and added \\"Today\\" and issued it as Song. Stewart, Creme and Godley released another single in February 1971 under yet another name, The New Wave Band, this time with former Herman's Hermits member Derek \\"Lek\\" Leckenby on guitar. The song, a cover version of Paul Simon's \\"Cecilia\\", was one of the few tracks the band released that they had not written. It also failed to chart.\\"Manchester Beat\\" website The band also continued outside production work at Strawberry, working with Dave Berry, Wayne Fontana, Peter Cowap and Herman's Hermits, and doing original compositions for various UK football (soccer) teams. In 1971 they produced and played on Space Hymns, an album by New Age musician Ramases; in 1972‚Äì73 they co-produced and played on two Neil Sedaka albums, Solitaire and The Tra-La Days Are Over. The experience of working on Solitaire, which became a success for Sedaka, was enough to prompt the band to seek recognition on their own merits. Gouldman‚Äîwho by 1972 was back at Strawberry Studios‚Äîsaid: Stewart said the decision was made over a meal in a Chinese restaurant: \\"We asked ourselves whether we shouldn't pool our creative talents and try to do something with the songs that each of us was working on at the time.\\" Once again a four-piece, the group re-recorded Hotlegs track \\"Today\\" b/w new Stewart/Gouldman song \\"Warm Me\\" and released it under the name Festival. The single failed to chart and the band moved on to record a Stewart/Gouldman song, \\"Waterfall\\", in early 1972. Stewart offered the acetate to Apple Records. He waited months before receiving a note from the label saying the song was not commercial enough to release as a single. 1972‚Äì1976: Original line-up Undeterred by Apple's rejection, the group decided to plug another song which had been written as a possible B-side to \\"Waterfall\\", a Godley/Creme composition titled \\"Donna\\". The song was a Frank Zappa-influenced 1950s doo-wop parody, a sharp mix of commercial pop and irony with a chorus sung in falsetto. Stewart said: \\"We knew it had something. We only knew of one person who was mad enough to release it, and that was Jonathan King.\\" Stewart called King, a flamboyant entrepreneur, producer and recording artist, who drove to Strawberry, listened to the track and \\"fell about laughing\\", declaring: \\"It's fabulous, it's a hit.\\" 10cc press-kit) King signed the band to his UK Records label in July 1972 and dubbed them 10cc. By his own account, King chose the name after having a dream in which he was standing in front of the Hammersmith Odeon in London where the boarding read \\"10cc The Best Band in the World\\". A widely repeated claim, disputed by King and Godley, but confirmed in a 1988 interview by Creme, and also on the webpage of Gouldman's current line-up, is that the band name represented a volume of semen that was more than the average amount ejaculated, thus emphasising their potency or prowess. \\"Donna\\", released as the first 10cc single, was chosen by BBC Radio 1 disc jockey Tony Blackburn as his Record of the Week, helping to launch it into the Top 30. The song peaked at No. 2 in the UK in October 1972. Although their second single, a similarly 1950s-influenced song called \\"Johnny Don't Do It\\", was not a major chart success, \\"Rubber Bullets\\", a catchy satirical take on the \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" concept, became a hit internationally and gave 10cc their first British No.1 single in June 1973. They consolidated their success a few months later with \\"The Dean and I\\", which peaked at No.10 in September. They released two singles, \\"Headline Hustler\\" (in the US) and the self-mocking \\"The Worst Band in the World\\" (in the UK) and launched a UK tour on 26 August 1973, joined by second drummer Paul Burgess, before returning to Strawberry Studios in November to record the remainder of their second LP, Sheet Music (1974), which included \\"The Worst Band in the World\\" along with other hits \\"The Wall Street Shuffle\\" (No.10, 1974) and \\"Silly Love\\" (No.24, 1974). Sheet Music became the band's breakthrough album, remaining on the UK charts for six months and paving the way for a US tour in February 1974. In February 1975, the band announced they were splitting with Jonathan King and that they had signed with Mercury Records for US$1 million. The catalyst for the deal was one song ‚Äì \\"I'm Not in Love\\". Stewart recalled: > At that point in time we were still on Jonathan King's label, but > struggling. We were absolutely skint, the lot of us, we were really > struggling seriously, and Philips Phonogram wanted to do a deal with us. > They wanted to buy Jonathan's contract. Our manager Ric Dixon invited them > to listen to what we've done. Head of A & R Nigel Grainge came up to our > Strawberry Studio, heard the album and freaked. He said \\"This is a > masterpiece, it's a done deal!\\". We did a five-year deal with them for five > albums and they paid us a serious amount of money. It was Grainge's idea to > release 'Life Is A Minestrone' as the first single holding back the big one > to give us more longevity for the album. Speaking in the BBC Four documentary I'm Not in Love: The Story of 10cc in 2015, Stewart explained that the band, three years into a five-year contract with King were earning a mere 4% of royalties. Creme made it clear that the band had fully intended to sign with Richard Branson's fledgling Virgin label, with the band's records to be released in the US through Atlantic. Stewart and Creme were about to go on holiday with their wives (Stewart and Creme are brothers-in-law through marriage), however, and had left their manager Harvey Lisberg with power of attorney to accept the Branson offer. No sooner had they left the country, but another higher bid arrived from Phonogram and was accepted by the management team, including Lisberg. Creme said that he felt \\"horrified, embarrassed and disgusted - to this day I still am\\". The Original Soundtrack, which was already complete, was released just weeks later. It was both a critical and commercial success and featured distinctive cover art created by the Hipgnosis team and drawn by musician and artist Humphrey Ocean. It is also notable for its opening track, Godley & Creme's \\"Une Nuit A Paris (One Night in Paris)\\", an eight-minute, multi-part \\"mini-operetta\\" that is thought to have been an influence on \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" by Queen. 10cc Crowd at Knebworth concert - 120.000 - 1976 Although it bore an unlikely title (picked up from a radio talk show), \\"Life Is a Minestrone\\" (1975) was another UK Top 10 placing, peaking at No.7. Their biggest success came with the dreamy \\"I'm Not in Love\\", which gave the band their second UK No. 1 in June 1975. The song provided them with their first US chart success when the song reached No. 2. A collaborative effort built around a title by Stewart, \\"I'm Not in Love\\" is notable for its innovative production, especially its richly overdubbed choral backing. Godley stated: > If I was to pick one track from everything we've done, \\"I'm Not in Love\\" > would be my favourite. It's got something that none of our other tracks have > at all. It's not clever in a conscious way but it says it all so simply in, > what, six minutes. ‚Äì NME, February 1976 During this time 10cc also collaborated with Justin Hayward on the single \\"Blue Guitar\\", being a backing band and doing production work. The song was also released on later reissues of Blue Jays album by Hayward and John Lodge. Eric Stewart performing live in Oslo, April 1976 10cc's fourth LP, How Dare You! (1976), featuring another Hipgnosis cover, furnished two more UK Top Ten hits‚Äîthe witty \\"Art for Art's Sake\\" (No.5 in January 1976) and \\"I'm Mandy, Fly Me\\" (No.6, April 1976). But by this time the once close personal and working relationships between the four members had begun to fray, and it was the last album with the original line-up. 10cc's success prompted the 1976 re-release of the Hotlegs album under the new title You Didn't Like It Because You Didn't Think of It with two additional tracks. The title track was the epic B-side of \\"Neanderthal Man\\", a section of which had been reworked as \\"Fresh Air for My Mama\\" on the 10cc album. 1976: Split Frictions mounted between the group's two creative teams during the recording of How Dare You, with each pair realising how far apart their ideas had become.Pop Scene ‚Äì Australia's International Pop Magazine, issue No 2, Gordon and Gotch, 1977. At the beginning of the sessions for band's fifth album further creative differences occurred and Godley and Creme left 10cc to work on a project that eventually evolved into the triple LP set Consequences (1977), a sprawling concept album that featured contributions from satirist Peter Cook and jazz vocalist Sarah Vaughan. The first of a series of albums by Godley & Creme, Consequences began as a demonstration record for the \\"Gizmotron\\", an electric guitar effect they had invented. The device, which fitted over the bridge of an electric guitar, contained six small motor-driven wheels attached to small keys (four wheels for electric basses); when the key was depressed, the Gizmotron wheels bowed the guitar strings, producing notes and chords with endless sustain. First used during the recording of the Sheet Music track \\"Old Wild Men\\", the device was designed to further cut their recording costs: by using it on an electric guitar with studio effects, they could effectively simulate strings and other sounds, enabling them to dispense with expensive orchestral overdubs. In a 2007 interview with the ProGGnosis‚ÄîProgressive Rock & Fusion website,ProgGnosis website interview with Kevin Godley, 23 June 2007 Godley explained: \\"We left because we no longer liked what Gouldman and Stewart were writing. We left because 10cc was becoming safe and predictable and we felt trapped.\\" But speaking to Uncut magazine 10 years earlier, he expressed regret about the band breaking up as they embarked on the Consequences project: In a BBC Radio Wales interview Stewart gave his side of the split: Stewart said there were immediate benefits in the absence of Godley and Creme. \\"It became clear things went much smoother and the atmosphere was much more pleasant than with Lol and Kevin,\\" he said. Godley & Creme went on to achieve cult success as a songwriting and recording duo, scoring several hits and releasing a string of innovative LPs and singles. Having honed their skills on the equally innovative clips that they made to promote their own singles (e.g. their 1985 single \\"Cry\\") they returned to their visual arts roots and became better-known as directors of music videos in the 1980s, creating acclaimed videos for chart-topping acts including George Harrison (\\"When We Was Fab\\"), Asia (\\"Heat of the Moment\\", \\"Only Time Will Tell\\") The Police (\\"Every Breath You Take\\"), Duran Duran (\\"Girls on Film\\"), Frankie Goes to Hollywood (\\"Two Tribes\\"), Peter Gabriel's duet with Kate Bush (\\"Don't Give Up\\"), and Herbie Hancock (\\"Rockit\\"). They also directed a video for Stewart and Gouldman's \\"Feel the Love\\". 1977‚Äì1983: Second era After the departure of Godley and Creme, Stewart and Gouldman opted to continue as 10cc, working with drummer Paul Burgess, who had up to that point been their tour backup drummer. Their first album as a three piece band was Deceptive Bends (1977), named after a sign on the Mickleham bends on the A24 between Leatherhead and Dorking in Surrey. The album, recorded at the newly completed Strawberry South Studio in Dorking, Surrey, reached No. 3 in Britain and No. 31 in the US and also yielded three hit singles, \\"The Things We Do for Love\\" (UK No. 6, US No. 5), \\"Good Morning Judge\\" (UK No. 5, US No. 69) and \\"People in Love\\" (US No. 40). Stewart later said he and Gouldman felt vindicated by its success: \\"I was out to prove also that we could write a hit album without Kevin and Lol ... we did!\\" In 1977, 10cc embarked on an international tour with guitarist Rick Fenn, keyboardist Tony O'Malley (Kokomo) and an additional drummer Stuart Tosh (ex-Pilot) and recorded a live album, \\"Live and Let Live\\" (1977), which mixed the hits with material from the previous three LPs. Fenn, Tosh, Burgess and keyboardist Duncan Mackay, who replaced Tony O'Malley after the tour, were now full members of the band and performed on 1978's Bloody Tourists, which provided the band with their international No. 1 single, the reggae-styled \\"Dreadlock Holiday\\", also their third UK No. 1\\\\. Both Bloody Tourists and \\"Dreadlock Holiday\\" performed very successful around the world, however additional songs released as singles became only minor hits with the second UK single \\"Reds in My Bed\\", featuring lead vocals by Stuart Tosh, failing to chart. The band suffered a major setback in January 1979 when Stewart was seriously injured in a car crash. Due to his injuries, Stewart was unable to work on music and 10cc had to be put on hold. This led to cancellation of 1979 legs of tour with other band members working on solo projects. Stewart later told the BBC: Gouldman, too, considered the aftermath of Stewart's accident to be a turning point. In a 1995 BBC interview he said: While Stewart recovered, Gouldman recorded the title track to the film Sunburn with the help of some of the 10cc band members, which became a minor UK hit in 1979. Gouldman also recorded the soundtrack to the animated film Animalympics, which was originally intended as 10cc project. Rick Fenn went on tour with Mike Oldfield, while Duncan Mackay took part in recording of Kate Bush album Never for Ever. To fill the gap between 10cc releases, a greatest hits compilation was issued in late 1979 Greatest Hits 1972‚Äì1978, and released a single, coupling \\"I'm Not in Love\\" with \\"For You and I\\", which failed to chart. As Stewart recovered, he recorded the soundtrack to the film Girls, mainly working with Duncan Mackay with other 10cc band members making guest appearances. The band signed with Warner Bros. Records, producing a new 10cc offering entitled Look Hear?. The lead single \\"One-Two-Five\\" failed to chart in the native UK and the album proved to be less successful than previous 10cc albums. In the aftermath of the tour in support Eric Stewart, Graham Gouldman and the rest of the band members again embarked on a number of side projects. Gouldman and Stewart subsequently decided to continue 10cc as a duo with other members becoming session and touring musicians. The band returned to the Mercury label to record Ten Out of 10 (1981) featuring Fenn and Burgess on a number of tracks. The UK release of the album (and its associated singles \\"Les Nouveaux Riches\\" and \\"Don't Turn Me Away\\") failed to chart. In a bid to inject an American flavour to the album and bolster its commercial appeal, Warner Bros. invited singer-songwriter Andrew Gold to contribute to a revised North American version of the LP. Gold wound up co-writing and playing on three new tracks which appeared on the North American release of Ten Out of 10. This ultimately led to an offer from Gouldman and Stewart to officially join 10cc; an offer Gold declined because of other commitments. Gouldman later admitted greater involvement by Gold might have lifted the band's early 1980s output from its mediocrity: Despite the revisions to the album made for the North American market, Ten Out of 10 did not chart in US, nor did any singles pulled from the LP. However, the single \\"Don't Turn Me Away\\" was a surprise minor hit in Canada, reaching No. 38. Ironically, this track was one that appeared on the original \\"less commercial\\" UK version of the LP, and was not one of the tracks that had been specially added to the North American release. The band embarked on their 10th anniversary tour in early 1982, with Fenn, Burgess and Tosh joining Stewart and Gouldman, along with new keyboardist Vic Emerson of Sad Caf√©. They released \\"The Power of Love\\", co-written with Andrew Gold, as a single, which did not chart. \\"Run Away\\", released as a single in June 1982, reached No.50 in the UK; \\"We've Heard it all Before\\" (October 1982) did not chart. All three of these singles were tracks from the revised North American version of Ten Out of 10, and had not previously been issued in the UK. Stewart also released a 1982 solo album Frooty Rooties with Burgess as a drummer and participation from Gouldman and Fenn on one track. 10cc began a UK tour in March 1983, coinciding with the release of the single \\"24 Hours\\". The song was made available both as a 7\\" and 10\\" single, with live versions of \\"Dreadlock Holiday\\" and \\"I'm Not in Love\\" on the b-sides. It failed to chart, as did a further single, \\"Feel The Love (Oomachasaooma)\\"/\\"She Gives Me Pain\\" issued in July 1983. \\"Feel The Love (Oomachasaooma)\\" was promoted by a tennis-themed video clip, directed by none other than former 10cc members Godley and Creme, by now well into their joint careers as noted music video pioneers. The next 10cc LP, Windows in the Jungle, (October 1983) used session heavyweights including drummer Steve Gadd, but the album was dominated by Stewart; Gouldman only performed partial lead vocals on one song. It reached No.70 on the UK charts. The band toured the UK in October, with drummer Jamie Lane in place of Paul Burgess (who was working with Jethro Tull). This turned out to be their last tour until they reformed eight years later. 1984‚Äì1991: Separate projects After 1983, the band went into recess as Stewart produced recordings for Sad Caf√© and Gouldman produced tracks for the Ramones.The Ramones namechecked 10cc on the Gouldman-produced song \\"It's Not My Place (in the 9 to 5 World)\\", a track on the Pleasant Dreams album. Stewart continued his association with Paul McCartney; He had already appeared on Tug of War in 1982 and Pipes of Peace in 1983. During 1984 he appeared in the video for the US single \\"So Bad\\" which also featured Ringo Starr and the feature film/soundtrack for Give My Regards to Broad Street. He then co-wrote much of the Press to Play album (1986), though he was critical of the album's production. He also produced the album Eyes of a Woman (1985) by Agnetha F√§ltskog of ABBA. Gouldman, meanwhile, teamed with Andrew Gold to form the duo Common Knowledge, which, after two unsuccessful singles changed their name to Wax. The duo's albums included Magnetic Heaven (1986), American English (1987) and A Hundred Thousand in Fresh Notes (1989). The duo scored some success including a Spanish No.1 single and their only British hit, \\"Bridge to Your Heart\\" (1987) which reached No. 12. Gouldman also assembled and produced the charity single \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" by The Crowd in aid of the Bradford City stadium fire. Released in 1985, the single reached No.1 in the UK charts. A compilation album Changing Faces ‚Äì The Very Best of 10cc and Godley & Creme was released in 1987 and gave the band their biggest hit album since 1978. A four CD box set, Greatest Songs and More was issued in Japan in 1991, which included many b-sides available on CD for the first time. 1991‚Äì1995: 10cc reunited In 1991, the original four members reunited to record ...Meanwhile (1992), an album produced by Gary Katz of Steely Dan fame. Katz was suggested by the record label Polydor who wanted 10cc to enjoy success in America, and because of his links to Steely Dan‚Äîa similar-sounding 1970s band. However, the album was not a \\"reunion\\" in the strict sense of the word. All the album's songs were written by Stewart and Gouldman (with the exception of one track which was co-written by Stewart and Paul McCartney in the late 1980s with additional writing from Gouldman). Creme and Godley agreed to guest on the album to fulfil their obligation to Polydor‚Äîboth had owed Polydor one album when they split in the late 1980s. Godley and Creme sang background vocals on several tracks on the album. Godley also sang the lead on one song, \\"The Stars Didn't Show\\". The record label did everything it could to make it appear that it was a genuine reunion album to generate publicity ... to little effect. ...Meanwhile did not spawn any major hits, but was relatively well received in Japan and in Europe. It prominently featured session musicians Jeff Porcaro of Toto on drums, Freddie Washington on bass, Michael Landau on lead and rhythm guitar, and Bashiri Johnson on percussion. Also appearing on the album were Dr. John (Mac Rebennack) on piano, David Paich (also of Toto fame) on keyboards, longtime 10cc collaborator Andrew Gold on guitar and many other renowned session musicians and singers. ...Meanwhile is believed to be Porcaro's last session work before he died of a heart attack. Dr. John was recommended by producer Gary Katz and invited along to the sessions. Gouldman, in a 1995 interview, was philosophical about the album: \\"When we finally did come back to record again, it was based on market research that our record company had done, that said a new 10cc album would do really, really well. And, ah, history has proved that wrong.\\" Yet according to Stewart, both he and Gouldman had approached the album positively. \\"We wrote in a three-month period, 22 songs. Every day we were coming up with new ideas, and they were getting better and better, as far as we were concerned. And they sounded like 10cc songs again.\\" The album was followed by a tour in 1993, with former members Rick Fenn and Stuart Tosh returning alongside new players Steve Piggot (keyboards, synthesisers) and Gary Wallis (drum, percussion). This tour was captured on the live album and DVD Alive. In 1995 the band released Mirror Mirror, produced by Gouldman, Stewart and Adrian Lee of Mike + The Mechanics, and without participation from Godley or Creme. Despite initial objections by Gouldman, Mirror Mirror included an acoustic version of \\"I'm Not in Love\\" which became a No. 29 UK hit single, but overall the album did not fare very well. Gouldman has described Mirror Mirror as \\"almost like two-halves of an album\\", largely a result of the fact that he and Stewart recorded in separate countries. \\"I don't like to say we hoodwinked the people, but you could say it's not quite what it appears to be, and anyone with any sense, who reads the credits, could see that,\\" he told Goldmine magazine. Their recording arrangement also provided further evidence of a fractured relationship between Stewart and Gouldman: aside from \\"I'm Not in Love\\", Stewart did not appear on any of the tracks Gouldman played or sang on, while Gouldman did not appear on any of Stewart's tracks. In the spring of 1995, the band toured Europe and Japan with a line-up of Stewart, Gouldman, Fenn, Tosh, Alan Park (keyboards, synthesisers) and Geoff Dunn (drums, percussion). Stewart left the band after this tour, and has since commented:Reply to question by Eric Stewart at his website \\"10cc is well and truly finished as far as I am concerned.\\" Married to a pair of sisters, Stewart and Creme have kept in touch, though neither are on speaking terms with their erstwhile writing partners.Lester,Paul (2012). \\"10cc: It Was A Tragedy We Didn't Stay Together\\". The Guardian 1999‚Äìpresent: 10cc touring band, GG/06 Swedish TV show Bingolotto In 1999 Gouldman convened a 10cc line-up comprising himself, Fenn, Paul Burgess, and new recruits Mick Wilson (vocals, guitar) and Mike Stevens (vocals, keyboards, sax, guitar). This version of the band played their first gig at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in Birmingham and then began touring regularly in 2002. The same five members have been associated with the group ever since. A new member, Keith Hayman (keyboards), switched with Mike Stevens in 2006 and continued to do so until 2011. This iteration of the group also featured occasional guest appearances by Kevin Godley, and toured both the UK and overseas, playing 10cc hits plus a section of Gouldman's hits written for others. Wilson handled the majority of the lead vocals, taking over from Eric Stewart on that front. Although popular with audiences, Stewart is critical of the band continuing without him. Founding guitarist Lol Creme, discussing his newest live act in 2012, opined: In January 2004, Godley and Gouldman reconvened to write more songs. Godley explained: In 2006 Godley and Gouldman's website offered a six-track EP to download credited to GG/06: \\"The Same Road\\", \\"Johnny Hurts\\", \\"Beautifulloser.com\\", \\"Hooligan Crane\\", \\"Son of Man\\" and \\"Barry's Shoes\\", described as the first of a group of songs they had worked on for three years. A few of these songs were added to the rotation of songs that 10cc played in their live set, while the song \\"Son of Man\\" later became the opening theme for 10cc shows with Godley providing the video. The band released a live album and DVD titled Clever Clogs in 2008 featuring Kevin Godley on several songs, including GG/06's \\"Beautifulloser.com\\". In early 2009, Gouldman's 10cc launched its official website, 10ccworld.com (now 10cc.world). Since the release, the website offered various live recordings of the shows through its online store. Regarding new 10cc studio release Gouldman has said that without Stewart, Creme or Godley, there will never be another 10cc album, though he is happy to play past albums in concert.Loose Women: Graham Gouldman Interview (07.04.09) To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the band's formation 10cc performed a concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 10 May 2012 with Kevin Godley performing several songs with the band. Universal Music also issued two box sets for this occasion. The first one titled Tenology, a four-CD/one-DVD retrospective, was released on 19 November 2012. All four original members helped choose the track listing and gave interviews to Paul Lester as part of the project. The second box set titled Classic Album Selection featured albums from The Original Soundtrack to Live and Let Live along with bonus tracks. In 2016, Godley recorded a video performance of \\"Somewhere in Hollywood\\" for 10cc's live performance of the album Sheet Music during that year.Hall, Duncan (2015)\\"10cc's Graham Gouldman on recreating the Sheet Music album on tour\\". The Argus The same year Keith Hayman again replaced Mike Stevens on keyboards. In December 2015, BBC Four released the hour-long documentary titled I'm Not in Love: The Story of 10cc. In July 2017, a box set titled Before, During and After: The Story of 10cc was released. The four-disc set contains 10cc material as well as material from the late 60s and early 70s that the band recorded under various names and material from various projects that band members were involved in after leaving the band. Eric Stewart also released a solo boxset through Cherry Records while promoting his autobiography In 2018 the 10cc concert line up changed with Iain Hornal taking Wilson's place as vocalist. Mick Wilson now sings and tours with 'Go Now - The Music of the Moody Blues' and also as part of 'Frontm3n' with Pete Lincoln (ex The Sweet) and Peter Howarth (The Hollies).

This could be, for example, a mortgage, where the property represents the security. *An unsecured creditor does not have a charge over the company‚Äôs assets. The term creditor is frequently used in the financial world, especially in reference to short-term loans, long-term bonds, and mortgage loans. In law, a person who has a money judgment entered in their favor by a court is called a judgment creditor. The term creditor derives from the notion of credit. Also, in modern America, credit refers to a rating which indicates the likelihood a borrower will pay back their loan. In earlier times, credit also referred to reputation or trustworthiness.  Accounting classification  In accounting presentation, creditors are to be broken down into 'amounts falling due within one year' or 'amounts falling due after more than one year'... The financial statements presentation is this: *Long-term liabilities **'Long-term creditors' *Current liabilities **'Current creditors' Creditor's power during insolvency In the UK, once an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) has been applied for, and is in place through the courts, creditors are prevented from making direct contact under the terms of the IVA. All ongoing correspondence of an IVA must first go through the appointed Insolvency Practitioner. The creditors will begin to deal with the Insolvency Practitioner and readily accept annual reports when submitted. Under the Companies Act 2006, a company's creditors may apply to the court for an order summoning a meeting of the creditors or some of the creditors who fall into a specific category, in order to consider a compromise or \\"arrangement\\" between the company and its creditors. If a majority representing 75% in value of the creditors or class of creditors present and voting either in person or by proxy at the meeting agree a compromise, the meeting may apply to the court for the compromise to be enforced. The same provision would apply to members (shareholders) of a company seeking to make an arrangement with the company.UK Legislation, Companies Act 2006, Part 26: Arrangements and Reconstructions: General, accessed 15 August 2020 The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 makes similar provision where a compromise has been proposed between creditors or members and a company which \\"has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties\\".UK Legislation, Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, Schedule 9: Arrangements and Reconstructions for Companies in Financial Difficulty, accessed 15 August 2020  See also  *Accounts payable *Accruals and deferred income *Bank loan and Overdrafts *Bill of exchange payable *Creditor's rights *Debenture loans *Individual voluntary arrangement *Intra-group accounts owed *IOU (I Owe You) *Payments received on account *Proposed dividends *Trade creditors References Credit Debt ","title":"Creditor"},{"id":"601599","text":"was a town located in Ogasa District, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan.

It is one of the primary theories on peak oil. Choosing a particular curve determines a point of maximum production based on discovery rates, production rates and cumulative production. Early in the curve (pre-peak), the production rate increases due to the discovery rate and the addition of infrastructure. Late in the curve (post-peak), production declines because of resource depletion. The Hubbert peak theory is based on the observation that the amount of oil under the ground in any region is finite, therefore the rate of discovery which initially increases quickly must reach a maximum and decline. In the US, oil extraction followed the discovery curve after a time lag of 32 to 35 years.Jean Laherrere, \\"Forecasting production from discovery\\", ASPO Lisbon May 19‚Äì20, 2005 The theory is named after American geophysicist M. King Hubbert, who created a method of modeling the production curve given an assumed ultimate recovery volume. Hubbert's peak \\"Hubbert's peak\\" can refer to the peaking of production of a particular area, which has now been observed for many fields and regions. Hubbert's peak was thought to have been achieved in the United States contiguous 48 states (that is, excluding Alaska and Hawaii) in the early 1970s. Oil production peaked at and then declined for several years since. Yet, recent advances in extraction technology, particularly those that led to the extraction of tight oil and oil from shale, have drastically changed the picture. A decline in production followed the 1970s peak of more than 10 million barrels. In November 2017 the United States once again surpassed the 10 million barrel mark for the first time since 1970. Peak oil as a proper noun, or \\"Hubbert's peak\\" applied more generally, refers to a predicted event: the peak of the entire planet's oil production. After peak oil, according to the Hubbert Peak Theory, the rate of oil production on Earth would enter a terminal decline. On the basis of his theory, in a paperNuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels, M.K. Hubbert, Presented before the Spring Meeting of the Southern District, American Petroleum Institute, Plaza Hotel, San Antonio, Texas, March 7‚Äì8‚Äì9, 1956 he presented to the American Petroleum Institute in 1956, Hubbert correctly predicted that production of oil from conventional sources would peak in the continental United States around 1965‚Äì1970. His prediction of inevitable decline has been incorrect, but the 1970 peak has yet not been surpassed. Hubbert further predicted a worldwide peak at \\"about half a century\\" from publication and approximately 12 gigabarrels (GB) a year in magnitude. In a 1976 TV interview Hubbert added that the actions of OPEC might flatten the global production curve but this would only delay the peak for perhaps 10 years. The development of new technologies has provided access to large quantities of unconventional resources, and the boost of production has largely discounted Hubbert's prediction. Hubbert's theory =Hubbert curve= The standard Hubbert curve. For applications, the x and y scales are replaced by time and production scales. U.S. Oil Production and Imports 1910 to 2012 In 1956, Hubbert proposed that fossil fuel production in a given region over time would follow a roughly bell-shaped curve without giving a precise formula; he later used the Hubbert curve, the derivative of the logistic curve,Bartlett A.A 1999 ,\\"An Analysis of U.S. and World Oil Production Patterns Using Hubbert-Style Curves.\\" Mathematical Geology.M. King Hubbert, 1962, \\"Energy Resources,\\" National Academy of Sciences, Publication 1000-D, p. 57. for estimating future production using past observed discoveries. Hubbert assumed that after fossil fuel reserves (oil reserves, coal reserves, and natural gas reserves) are discovered, production at first increases approximately exponentially, as more extraction commences and more efficient facilities are installed. At some point, a peak output is reached, and production begins declining until it approximates an exponential decline. The Hubbert curve satisfies these constraints. Furthermore, it is symmetrical, with the peak of production reached when half of the fossil fuel that will ultimately be produced has been produced. It also has a single peak. Given past oil discovery and production data, a Hubbert curve that attempts to approximate past discovery data may be constructed and used to provide estimates for future production. In particular, the date of peak oil production or the total amount of oil ultimately produced can be estimated that way. CavalloHubbert‚Äôs Petroleum Production Model: An Evaluation and Implications for World Oil Production Forecasts, Alfred J. Cavallo, Natural Resources Research, Vol. 13, No. 4, December 2004 defines the Hubbert curve used to predict the U.S. peak as the derivative of: : Q(t) = {Q_\\\\over {1 + ae^{-bt}}} where Qmax is the total resource available (ultimate recovery of crude oil), Q(t) the cumulative production, and a and b are constants. The year of maximum annual production (peak) is: : t_ = {1\\\\over b}\\\\ln \\\\left({a} \\\\right). so now the cumulative production Q(t) reaches the half of the total available resource: : Q(t) = Q_\\\\text{max}/2 The Hubbert equation assumes that oil production is symmetrical about the peak. Others have used similar but non-symmetrical equations which may provide better a fit to empirical production data. =Use of multiple curves= The sum of multiple Hubbert curves, a technique not developed by Hubbert himself, may be used in order to model more complicated real life scenarios. For example, when new technologies like hydraulic fracturing combined with new formations that were not productive before the new technology, this can create a need for multiple curves. These technologies are limited in number, but make a big impact on production and cause a need for a new curve to be added to the old curve and the entire curve to be reworked. =Reliability= Crude oil Hubbert's upper-bound prediction for US crude oil production (1956), and actual lower-48 states production through 2016 Hubbert, in his 1956 paper, presented two scenarios for US crude oil production: * most likely estimate: a logistic curve with a logistic growth rate equal to 6%, an ultimate resource equal to 150 Giga-barrels (Gb) and a peak in 1965. The size of the ultimate resource was taken from a synthesis of estimates by well-known oil geologists and the US Geological Survey, which Hubbert judged to be the most likely case. * upper-bound estimate: a logistic curve with a logistic growth rate equal to 6% and ultimate resource equal to 200 Giga-barrels and a peak in 1970. Hubbert's upper-bound estimate, which he regarded as optimistic, accurately predicted that US oil production would peak in 1970, although the actual peak was 17% higher than Hubbert's curve. Production declined, as Hubbert had predicted, and stayed within 10 percent of Hubbert's predicted value from 1974 through 1994; since then, actual production has been significantly greater than the Hubbert curve. The development of new technologies has provided access to large quantities of unconventional resources, and the boost of production has largely discounted Hubbert's prediction. Hubbert's 1956 production curves depended on geological estimates of ultimate recoverable oil resources, but he was dissatisfied by the uncertainty this introduced, given the various estimates ranging from 110 billion to 590 billion barrels for the US. Starting in his 1962 publication, he made his calculations, including that of ultimate recovery, based only on mathematical analysis of production rates, proved reserves, and new discoveries, independent of any geological estimates of future discoveries. He concluded that the ultimate recoverable oil resource of the contiguous 48 states was 170 billion barrels, with a production peak in 1966 or 1967. He considered that because his model incorporated past technical advances, that any future advances would occur at the same rate, and were also incorporated.M. King Hubbert, 1962, \\"Energy Resources,\\" National Academy of Sciences, Publication 1000-D, p. 60. Hubbert continued to defend his calculation of 170 billion barrels in his publications of 1965 and 1967, although by 1967 he had moved the peak forward slightly, to 1968 or 1969.M. King Hubbert, \\"National Academy of Sciences Report on Energy Resources: reply,\\" AAPG Bulletin, Oct. 1965, Vol. 49 No. 10 pp. 1720‚Äì27.M. King Hubbert, \\"Degree of advancement of petroleum exploration in United States,\\" AAPG Bulletin, Nov. 1967, Vol. 51 No. 11 pp. 2207‚Äì27. A post-hoc analysis of peaked oil wells, fields, regions and nations found that Hubbert's model was the \\"most widely useful\\" (providing the best fit to the data), though many areas studied had a sharper \\"peak\\" than predicted. A 2007 study of oil depletion by the UK Energy Research Centre pointed out that there is no theoretical and no robust practical reason to assume that oil production will follow a logistic curve. Neither is there any reason to assume that the peak will occur when half the ultimate recoverable resource has been produced; and in fact, empirical evidence appears to contradict this idea. An analysis of a 55 post- peak countries found that the average peak was at 25 percent of the ultimate recovery.Steve Sorrell and others, Global Oil Depletion, UK Energy Research Centre, . Natural gas Hubbert's 1962 prediction of US lower 48-state gas production, versus actual production through 2012 Hubbert also predicted that natural gas production would follow a logistic curve similar to that of oil.

Economics Oil imports by country Pre-2006 =Energy return on energy investment= The ratio of energy extracted to the energy expended in the process is often referred to as the Energy Return on Energy Investment (EROI or EROEI). Should the EROEI drops to one, or equivalently the Net energy gain falls to zero, the oil production is no longer a net energy source. There is a difference between a barrel of oil, which is a measure of oil, and a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE), which is a measure of energy. Many sources of energy, such as fission, solar, wind, and coal, are not subject to the same near-term supply restrictions that oil is. Accordingly, even an oil source with an EROEI of 0.5 can be usefully exploited if the energy required to produce that oil comes from a cheap and plentiful energy source. Availability of cheap, but hard to transport, natural gas in some oil fields has led to using natural gas to fuel enhanced oil recovery. Similarly, natural gas in huge amounts is used to power most Athabasca tar sands plants. Cheap natural gas has also led to ethanol fuel produced with a net EROEI of less than 1, although figures in this area are controversial because methods to measure EROEI are in debate. The assumption of inevitable declining volumes of oil and gas produced per unit of effort is contrary to recent experience in the US. In the United States, as of 2017, there has been an ongoing decade- long increase in the productivity of oil and gas drilling in all the major tight oil and gas plays. The US Energy Information Administration reports, for instance, that in the Bakken Shale production area of North Dakota, the volume of oil produced per day of drilling rig time in January 2017 was 4 times the oil volume per day of drilling five years previous, in January 2012, and nearly 10 times the oil volume per day of ten years previous, in January 2007. In the Marcellus gas region of the northeast, The volume of gas produced per day of drilling time in January 2017 was 3 times the gas volume per day of drilling five years previous, in January 2012, and 28 times the gas volume per day of drilling ten years previous, in January 2007.US Energy Information Administration, Drilling productivity report, 15 May 2017, (see ‚ÄúReport data‚Äù spreadsheet). =Growth-based economic models= World energy consumption & predictions, 2005‚Äì2035. Source: International Energy Outlook 2011. Insofar as economic growth is driven by oil consumption growth, post-peak societies must adapt. Hubbert believed: Some economists describe the problem as uneconomic growth or a false economy. At the political right, Fred Ikle has warned about \\"conservatives addicted to the Utopia of Perpetual Growth\\". Brief oil interruptions in 1973 and 1979 markedly slowed‚Äîbut did not stop‚Äîthe growth of world GDP.http://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2006/pdf/050206.pdf Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, world grain production increased by 250%. The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers (natural gas), pesticides (oil), and hydrocarbon fueled irrigation. David Pimentel, professor of ecology and agriculture at Cornell University, and Mario Giampietro, senior researcher at the National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition (INRAN), in their 2003 study Food, Land, Population and the U.S. Economy, placed the maximum U.S. population for a sustainable economy at 200 million (actual population approx. 290m in 2003, 329m in 2019). To achieve a sustainable economy world population will have to be reduced by two-thirds, says the study. Without population reduction, this study predicts an agricultural crisis beginning in 2020, becoming critical c. 2050. The peaking of global oil along with the decline in regional natural gas production may precipitate this agricultural crisis sooner than generally expected. Dale Allen Pfeiffer claims that coming decades could see spiraling food prices without relief and massive starvation on a global level such as never experienced before. Hubbert peaks Although Hubbert peak theory receives most attention in relation to peak oil production, it has also been applied to other natural resources. =Natural gas= Doug Reynolds predicted in 2005 that the North American peak would occur in 2007. Bentley predicted a world \\"decline in conventional gas production from about 2020\\". =Coal= Although observers believe that peak coal is significantly further out than peak oil, Hubbert studied the specific example of anthracite in the US, a high grade coal, whose production peaked in the 1920s. Hubbert found that anthracite matches a curve closely. Hubbert had recoverable coal reserves worldwide at 2.500 √ó 1012 metric tons and peaking around 2150 (depending on usage). More recent estimates suggest an earlier peak. Coal: Resources and Future Production (PDF 630KB), published on April 5, 2007 by the Energy Watch Group (EWG), which reports to the German Parliament, found that global coal production could peak in as few as 15 years. Reporting on this, Richard Heinberg also notes that the date of peak annual energetic extraction from coal is likely to come earlier than the date of peak in quantity of coal (tons per year) extracted as the most energy-dense types of coal have been mined most extensively. A second study, The Future of Coal by B. Kavalov and S. D. Peteves of the Institute for Energy (IFE), prepared for European Commission Joint Research Centre, reaches similar conclusions and states that \\"coal might not be so abundant, widely available and reliable as an energy source in the future\\". Work by David Rutledge of Caltech predicts that the total of world coal production will amount to only about 450 gigatonnes.\\"Coal: Bleak outlook for the black stuff\\", by David Strahan, New Scientist, January 19, 2008, pp. 38‚Äì41. This implies that coal is running out faster than usually assumed. =Fissionable materials= In a paper in 1956, after a review of US fissionable reserves, Hubbert notes of nuclear power: As of 2015, the identified resources of uranium are sufficient to provide more than 135 years of supply at the present rate of consumption. Technologies such as the thorium fuel cycle, reprocessing and fast breeders can, in theory, extend the life of uranium reserves from hundreds to thousands of years. Caltech physics professor David Goodstein stated in 2004 that =Helium= Helium production and storage in the United States, 1940‚Äì2014 (data from USGS) Almost all helium on Earth is a result of radioactive decay of uranium and thorium. Helium is extracted by fractional distillation from natural gas, which contains up to 7% helium. The world's largest helium-rich natural gas fields are found in the United States, especially in the Hugoton and nearby gas fields in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. The extracted helium is stored underground in the National Helium Reserve near Amarillo, Texas, the self-proclaimed \\"Helium Capital of the World\\". Helium production is expected to decline along with natural gas production in these areas. Helium, which is the second-lightest chemical element, will rise to the upper layers of Earth's atmosphere, where it can forever break free from Earth's gravitational attraction. Approximately 1,600 tons of helium are lost per year as a result of atmospheric escape mechanisms. =Transition metals= Hubbert applied his theory to \\"rock containing an abnormally high concentration of a given metal\\" and reasoned that the peak production for metals such as copper, tin, lead, zinc and others would occur in the time frame of decades and iron in the time frame of two centuries like coal. The price of copper rose 500% between 2003 and 2007 and was attributed by some to peak copper. Copper prices later fell, along with many other commodities and stock prices, as demand shrank from fear of a global recession. Lithium availability is a concern for a fleet of Li-ion battery using cars but a paper published in 1996 estimated that world reserves are adequate for at least 50 years. A similar prediction for platinum use in fuel cells notes that the metal could be easily recycled. =Precious metals= In 2009, Aaron Regent president of the Canadian gold giant Barrick Gold said that global output has been falling by roughly one million ounces a year since the start of the decade. The total global mine supply has dropped by 10pc as ore quality erodes, implying that the roaring bull market of the last eight years may have further to run. \\"There is a strong case to be made that we are already at 'peak gold',\\" he told The Daily Telegraph at the RBC's annual gold conference in London. \\"Production peaked around 2000 and it has been in decline ever since, and we forecast that decline to continue. It is increasingly difficult to find ore,\\" he said. Ore grades have fallen from around 12 grams per tonne in 1950 to nearer 3 grams in the US, Canada, and Australia. South Africa's output has halved since peaking in 1970. Output fell a further 14 percent in South Africa in 2008 as companies were forced to dig ever deeper ‚Äì at greater cost ‚Äì to replace depleted reserves. World mined gold production has peaked four times since 1900: in 1912, 1940, 1971, and 2001, each peak being higher than previous peaks. The latest peak was in 2001, when production reached 2,600 metric tons, then declined for several years.Thomas Chaise, World gold production 2010, 13 May 2010. Production started to increase again in 2009, spurred by high gold prices, and achieved record new highs each year in 2012, 2013, and in 2014, when production reached 2,990 tonnes.US Geological Survey, Gold, Mineral commodity summaries, Jan. 2016. =Phosphorus= Phosphorus supplies are essential to farming and depletion of reserves is estimated at somewhere from 60 to 130 years. According to a 2008 study, the total reserves of phosphorus are estimated to be approximately 3,200 MT, with a peak production at 28 MT/year in 2034. Individual countries' supplies vary widely; without a recycling initiative America's supply is estimated around 30 years. Phosphorus supplies affect agricultural output which in turn limits alternative fuels such as biodiesel and ethanol. Its increasing price and scarcity (global price of rock phosphate rose 8-fold in the 2 years to mid 2008) could change global agricultural patterns. Lands, perceived as marginal because of remoteness, but with very high phosphorus content, such as the Gran Chaco may get more agricultural development, while other farming areas, where nutrients are a constraint, may drop below the line of profitability. =Peak water= Hubbert's original analysis did not apply to renewable resources. However, over-exploitation often results in a Hubbert peak nonetheless. A modified Hubbert curve applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced. For example, a reserve such as the Ogallala Aquifer can be mined at a rate that far exceeds replenishment. This turns much of the world's underground water and lakes into finite resources with peak usage debates similar to oil. These debates usually center around agriculture and suburban water usage but generation of electricity from nuclear energy or coal and tar sands mining mentioned above is also water resource intensive. The term fossil water is sometimes used to describe aquifers whose water is not being recharged. =Renewable resources= *Peak fish: At least one researcher has attempted to perform Hubbert linearization (Hubbert curve) on the whaling industry, as well as charting the transparently dependent price of caviar on sturgeon depletion. The Atlantic northwest cod fishery was a renewable resource, but the numbers of fish taken exceeded the fish's rate of recovery. The end of the cod fishery does match the exponential drop of the Hubbert bell curve. Another example is the cod of the North Sea. *Air/oxygen: Half the world's oxygen is produced by phytoplankton. The numbers of plankton have dropped by 40% since the 1950s. Criticisms of peak oil  Economist Michael Lynch argues that the theory behind the Hubbert curve is too simplistic and relies on an overly Malthusian point of view. Lynch claims that Campbell's predictions for world oil production are strongly biased towards underestimates, and that Campbell has repeatedly pushed back the date. Leonardo Maugeri, vice president of the Italian energy company Eni, argues that nearly all of peak estimates do not take into account unconventional oil even though the availability of these resources is significant and the costs of extraction and processing, while still very high, are falling because of improved technology. He also notes that the recovery rate from existing world oil fields has increased from about 22% in 1980 to 35% today because of new technology and predicts this trend will continue. The ratio between proven oil reserves and current production has constantly improved, passing from 20 years in 1948 to 35 years in 1972 and reaching about 40 years in 2003. These improvements occurred even with low investment in new exploration and upgrading technology because of the low oil prices during the last 20 years. However, Maugeri feels that encouraging more exploration will require relatively high oil prices. Edward Luttwak, an economist and historian, claims that unrest in countries such as Russia, Iran and Iraq has led to a massive underestimate of oil reserves. The Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas (ASPO) responds by claiming neither Russia nor Iran are troubled by unrest currently, but Iraq is. Cambridge Energy Research Associates authored a report that is critical of Hubbert-influenced predictions: CERA does not believe there will be an endless abundance of oil, but instead believes that global production will eventually follow an \\"undulating plateau\\" for one or more decades before declining slowly, and that production will reach 40 Mb/d by 2015. Alfred J. Cavallo, while predicting a conventional oil supply shortage by no later than 2015, does not think Hubbert's peak is the correct theory to apply to world production. Criticisms of peak element scenarios Although M. King Hubbert himself made major distinctions between decline in petroleum production versus depletion (or relative lack of it) for elements such as fissionable uranium and thorium, some others have predicted peaks like peak uranium and peak phosphorus soon on the basis of published reserve figures compared to present and future production. According to some economists, though, the amount of proved reserves inventoried at a time may be considered \\"a poor indicator of the total future supply of a mineral resource.\\"James D. Gwartney, Richard L. Stroup, Russell S. Sobel, David MacPherson. Economics: Private and Public Choice, 12th Edition. South-Western Cengage Learning, p. 730. extract, accessed 5-20-2012 As some illustrations, tin, copper, iron, lead, and zinc all had both production from 1950 to 2000 and reserves in 2000 much exceed world reserves in 1950, which would be impossible except for how \\"proved reserves are like an inventory of cars to an auto dealer\\" at a time, having little relationship to the actual total affordable to extract in the future. In the example of peak phosphorus, additional concentrations exist intermediate between 71,000 Mt of identified reserves (USGS) and the approximately 30,000,000,000 Mt of other phosphorus in Earth's crust, with the average rock being 0.1% phosphorus, so showing decline in human phosphorus production will occur soon would require far more than comparing the former figure to the 190 Mt/year of phosphorus extracted in mines (2011 figure).American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2007, abstract #V33A-1161.

Jacques Arcadelt (also Jacob Arcadelt; 14 October 1568) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the Renaissance, active in both Italy and France, and principally known as a composer of secular vocal music. Although he also wrote sacred vocal music, he was one of the most famous of the early composers of madrigals; his first book of madrigals, published within a decade of the appearance of the earliest examples of the form, was the most widely printed collection of madrigals of the entire era.Harvard Dictionary of Music, p. 463 In addition to his work as a madrigalist, and distinguishing him from the other prominent early composers of madrigals ‚Äì Philippe Verdelot and Costanzo Festa ‚Äì he was equally prolific and adept at composing chansons, particularly late in his career when he lived in Paris.Einstein, Vol. I p. 264 Arcadelt was the most influential member of the early phase of madrigal composition, the \\"classic\\" phase; it was through Arcadelt's publications, more than those of any other composer, that the madrigal became known outside of Italy. Later composers considered Arcadelt's style to represent an ideal; later reprints of his first madrigal book were often used for teaching, with reprints appearing more than a century after its original publication.James Haar/Letitia Glozer, New Grove online Life While little is known about his early life, a Flemish origin along with a French upbringing has been suggested from variations on the spelling of his name, and he may originally have been from the vicinity of Li√®ge or Namur, in present-day Belgium. He moved to Italy as a young man, and was present in Florence by the late 1520s, therefore having an opportunity to meet or work with Philippe Verdelot, who wrote the earliest named madrigals. In or immediately before 1538 he moved to Rome where he obtained an appointment with the papal choir at St. Peter's Basilica; many composers from the Netherlands served as singers there throughout this era, and it is even possible that he went to Rome before coming to Florence.Perkins, Leeman L. Music in the Age of the Renaissance. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc., 1999. p. 671. Still in Rome, in January 1539, he probably was made a member of the Julian Chapel (the records give his name as \\"Jacobus flandrus\\", suggesting a Flemish origin, but it cannot be known with certainty if this record referred to Arcadelt). After some months there he became a member of the Sistine Chapel, where he was appointed \\"magister puerorum.\\" The same year saw the publication of no less than four books of his madrigals.Reese, Gustave. Music in the Renaissance. New York: Norton & Company Inc., 1959. p. 321. The first of these collections, Il primo libro di madrigali, went through 45 editions, becoming the most widely reprinted collection of madrigals of the time.Perkins 1999, p. 671. Arcadelt remained in Rome as a singer and composer at the Sistine Chapel until 1551, except for one leave of absence to visit France in 1547. During this period, probably in early 1542, he made the acquaintance of Michelangelo, but his madrigalian settings of two of the artist's sonnets were received with indifference; indeed, from Michelangelo's letters on the topic, he probably considered himself unmusical and incapable of appreciating Arcadelt's work. Michelangelo paid Arcadelt with a piece of satin suitable for making into a doublet.Einstein, Vol. I pp. 161‚Äì162 Arcadelt wrote over 200 madrigals before he left Italy in 1551 to return to France, where he spent the remainder of his life; his numerous chansons date from this and subsequent years.Perkins 1999, p. 671. In 1557 he published a book of masses, dedicated to his new employer, Charles de Guise, Cardinal of Lorraine (Arcadelt was ma√Ætre de chapelle, i.e. choirmaster for him). In this publication he was mentioned as a member of the royal chapel, and therefore must have served both Henry II (died 1559) and Charles IX during this late phase of his career. In Paris he employed the publishing house of Le Roy and Ballard, who printed his abundant chansons, masses and motets just as the Venetian printers had earlier printed his madrigals. Fran√ßois Rabelais immortalized Arcadelt in the introduction to Book IV of Gargantua and Pantagruel, where he includes the musician between Cl√©ment Janequin and Claudin de Sermisy as part of a choir singing a ribald song, in which Priapus boasts to the gods on Mount Olympus of his method of using a mallet to deflower a new bride.Einstein, Vol. I p. 162Rabelais, Gargantua and Pantagruel, pp. 445‚Äì446 Music During his long and productive career, Arcadelt wrote music both sacred and secular, all of it vocal. He left a total of 24 motets, 125 French chansons, approximately 250 madrigals (about fifty of which are of uncertain attribution), three masses, as well as settings of the Lamentations of Jeremiah and the Magnificat. There may be as many as 250 more madrigals by Arcadelt which survive anonymously in manuscript sources.Reese 1959, p. 322. Influences on his music ranged from the chanson and polyphonic style of his northern homeland, the native secular music of Italy such as the frottola, and the music he heard while he served in the Sistine Chapel choir. Of all the early madrigalists, he was by far the most universal in his influences as well as his appeal; and his influence on others was enormous. Arcadelt brought the madrigal form to its early maturity.Einstein, p. 264 =Secular music= Madrigals Arcadelt's several hundred madrigals, composed over a span of at least two decades, were usually for four voices, although he wrote a few for three, and a handful for five and six voices. Stylistically his madrigals are melodious and simple in structure, singable, and built on a clear harmonic basis, usually completely diatonic. The music is often syllablic, and while it sometimes uses repeated phrases, is almost always through-composed (as opposed to the contemporary chanson, which was often strophic).Brown 1999, p. 201. Arcadelt alternates homophonic and polyphonic textures, \\"in a state of delicate, labile equilibrium.\\"Blume, Friedrich. Renaissance and Baroque Music. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc., 1967. p. 67. His madrigals best represent the \\"classic\\" phase of development of the form, with their clear outline, four-part writing, refinement, and balance; the word painting, chromaticism, ornamentation, virtuosity, expressionistic and manneristic writing of madrigalists later in the century are nowhere to be found in Arcadelt.Einstein, Vol. I p. 269 His music became immensely popular in Italy and France for more than a hundred years, with his first book of madrigals being reprinted fifty-eight times by 1654, and his music appearing in innumerable intabulations for instruments such as the lute, guitar, and viol. Additional hints to his popularity are the frequency with which anonymous compositions were attributed to him, and the appearance of his music in several paintings of musicians from the time. Likely his popularity was due to his gift for capturing the Italian spirit and marrying it with the technical perfection of the Franco-Flemish harmonic and polyphonic style; in addition he wrote catchy tunes which were easy to sing. Unlike later generations of madrigal composers, Arcadelt did not expect professional singers to be the only consumers of his work; anyone who could read notes could sing his madrigals.Abraham 1968, pp. 69‚Äì70. For his texts, Arcadelt chose poets ranging from Petrarch (and his setting of a complete canzone, as a set of five interrelated madrigals, was the predecessor of the vogue for madrigal cycles), Pietro Bembo, Sannazaro, to Florentines Lorenzino de'Medici, Benedetto Varchi, Filippo Strozzi, and Michelangelo himself, to others such as Luigi Cassola of Piacenza, a now-obscure writer who was among the most often-set poets of the early madrigalists.Einstein, Vol. I p. 172 Much of the poetry of Arcadelt's madrigals has remained anonymous, just as some of Arcadelt's music is believed to survive anonymously. Another poet he set was Giovanni Guidiccioni, who wrote the words to his most single famous composition, and one of the most enduring of the entire 16th century: the four-voice madrigal Il bianco e dolce cigno (The white and gentle swan).Einstein, Vol. I p. 269 This madrigal was appealing on many levels. According to Alfred Einstein, writing in The Italian Madrigal, \\"‚Ä¶ he is content with a simple, tender declamation of the text, depending upon the elementary and magical power of music, of harmony, which veils this poem in a cloak of sublime and distant sentimentality. Here is attained the ideal of what the time expected of the dolcezza [sweetness] and the suavit√† [suaveness] of music. Arcadelt has conferred upon this composition a quality which is very rare in sixteenth-century secular music, namely durability ‚Ä¶\\"Einstein, Vol. I p. 270 The texture is mostly homophonic, with a hint of fauxbourdon in the harmony; the subject matter is erotic, with the orgasmic \\"thousand deaths\\" portrayed by a rising fourth figure in close imitation; brief bits of word- painting occur, such as the use of a flattened seventh on \\"piangendo\\"; and the musical phrases overlap the lines of verse, blurring the formal division of the line, a technique known in music, as in poetry, as enjambment.Atlas 1998, p. 431.Einstein, Vol. I p. 270 Chansons Since Arcadelt lived both in France and Italy, and wrote secular music in both places, his chansons and madrigals not unexpectedly share some features. The chanson was by nature a more stable form, often strophic and with patterned repetition; the madrigal, on the other hand, was usually through-composed.Einstein, Vol. I pp. 264‚Äì265 As Arcadelt borrowed some features of the chanson when he wrote his madrigals, he wrote some of his chansons with madrigalian features. Most of his chansons are syllablic and simple, with brief bursts of polyphonic writing, occasionally canonic, and with sections imitating the note nere style of the madrigal ‚Äì the fast \\"black notes\\" producing the effect of a patter song. Some of his chansons were actually contrafacta of his madrigals (the same music, printed with new words French instead of Italian). Rarely in music history were the madrigal and the chanson more alike. =Sacred music= In addition to his copious output of madrigals and chansons, Arcadelt produced three masses, 24 motets, settings of the Magnificat, the Lamentations of Jeremiah, and some sacred chansons ‚Äì the French equivalent of the madrigale spirituale. The masses are influenced by the previous generation of Franco-Flemish composers, particularly Jean Mouton and Josquin des Prez; the motets, avoiding the dense polyphony favored by the Netherlanders, are more declamatory and clear in texture, in a manner similar to his secular music. Much of his religious music, except for the sacred chansons, he probably wrote during his years in the papal chapel in Rome. Documents from the Sistine Chapel archives indicate that the choir sang his music during his residence there. =Publishers= Antoine Gardano became the primary Italian publisher for Arcadelt, although the competing Venetian publishing house of Scotto brought out one of his madrigal books as well.Atlas 1998, p. 458. Arcadelt's Il bianco e dolce cigno opened one of Gardano's books; as the piece had already achieved immense fame, it was the main selling point.Atlas 1998, p. 430. In Paris, some of Arcadelt's chansons appeared as early as 1540 in the publications of Pierre Attaingnant and Jacques Moderne, so must have been written in Italy.Einstein, Vol. I p. 264 After Arcadelt returned to France, his chansons, masses, and motets appeared in the editions of the printing firm of Le Roy and Ballard throughout the 1550s and 1560s, while his music was still being printed in distant Venice. Works A complete modern edition of Arcadelt's works is published in CMM, xxxi, 1‚Äì10 (ten volumes), edited by Albert Seay. The first volume contains Arcadelt's masses; his secular compositions are in volumes two through nine, and his motets and other sacred music are in volume ten. Below is a partial list of his works.

Originally named as 'Devavrata', he was the eighth son of the Kuru King Shantanu and the river goddess Ganga. Bhishma was blessed with a boon from his father that he could choose the time of his death or he may remain immortal till he desires. He was related to both the Pandavas and the Kauravas through his half-brother, Vichitravirya (Son of Satyavati). He was one of the greatest archers and warriors of his time and was trained by Lord Vishnu≈õ sixth avatar Parshurama . He also handed down the Vishnu Sahasranama to YudhishtiraMahabharatha when he was on his bed of arrows after the battle of Kurukshetra. Etymology In Sanskrit, the word Bhishma (‡§≠‡•Ä‡§∑‡•ç‡§Æ) means 'one who undertakes a fierce vow (Bhishma pratigya) and fulfils it.' His other names are as follows ‚Äì * Devavrata (‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§µ‡•ç‡§∞‡§§) - one who is devoted to Gods. It was also Bhishma's original name. * Gangaputra (‡§ó‡§Ç‡§ó‡§æ‡§™‡•Å‡§§‡•ç‡§∞) ‚Äì son of Ganga * Gangadatta (‡§ó‡§Ç‡§ó‡§æ‡§¶‡§§‡•ç‡§§) - given/granted by Ganga. * Shantanava (‡§∂‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§®‡§µ) ‚Äì descendant (son) of Shantanu.

She agreed but with one condition: that Shantanu would not question her actions. Shantanu accepted her condition and made a vow never to ask her the reason for her actions. They married and she later gave birth to a son but drowned the child very soon after his birth. Shantanu could not ask her the reason, because of his promise, she would leave him. One by one, seven sons were born to them and were all drowned by Ganga. When Ganga was about to drown the eighth son, Shantanu, devastated, could not restrain himself and confronted her. Finally, Ganga explained to King Shantanu about Brahma's curse given to Mahabhisha and her. Then, she told him that their eight children were Eight Vasus who were cursed by the renowned sage Vasishtha to be born on earth as mortal humans however when they pacified him, he limited his curse and told them that they would be freed from this curse within a year of their birth as humans. So, she released seven of them from this life by drowning them all. However, the eighth child Bhishma, the amsha of Prabhasa was destined to live a long life and never have a wife or have children. However, the sage also gave a boon to him that he would be virtuous, conversant with all the holy scriptures, and will be an obedient son to his father. Ganga told Shantanu that she will take him to the heavens to train him properly for the King's throne and status following his birth. With these words, she disappeared along with the child while Shantanu was struck with grief thinking about spending the rest of his life without her. Shantanu stops Ganga from drowning their eighth child, who later was known as Bhishma. The legend behind Bhishma's birth is as follows ‚Äì once the eight Vasus (\\"Ashtavasus\\") visited Vashishta's ashram accompanied by their wives. One of the wives took a fancy to Kamadhenu, Vashishta's wish-bearing cow, and asked her husband Prabhasa to steal it from Vashishta. Prabhasa then stole the cow with the help of the others who were all consequently cursed by Vashishta to incarnate in the world of humans. Upon the Vasus appealing to Vashishta's mercy, the seven Vasus who had assisted in stealing Kamadhenu had their curse mitigated such that their avatars would be liberated from their human birth as soon as they were born; however, Prabhasa being the protagonist of the theft was cursed to endure a longer life on the earth. The curse, however, is softened to the extent that his avatar would be one of the most illustrious men of his time. It was this Prabhasa also called Vasu Dyaus whose avatar was Bhishma. After Devavrata was born, his mother Ganga took him to different realms, where he was brought up and trained by many eminent sages (Mahabharata Shanti Parva, section 38). * Brihaspati: The son of Angiras and the preceptor of the Devas taught Devavrata the duties of kings (Dandaneeti), or political science and other Shastras. * Shukracharya: The son of Bhrigu and the preceptor of the Asuras also taught Devavrata in political science and other branches of knowledge. * Vashishtha, the Brahmarshi and Chyavana, the son of Bhrigu taught the Vedas and Vedangas to Devavrata. * Sanatkumara: The eldest son of Lord Brahma taught Devavrata the mental and spiritual sciences. * Markandeya: The immortal son of Mrikandu of Bhrigu's race who acquired everlasting youth from Lord Shiva taught Devavrata in the duties of the Yatis. * Parashurama: The son of Jamadagni of Bhrigu's race and the pupil of Shiva. Parashurama trained Bhishma in warfare. * Indra: The king of the Devas. He bestowed celestial weapons on Bhishma. Painting depicting presentation by Ganga of her son Devavrata (the future Bhishma) to his father, Shantanu After learning from various teachers, Devavrata became a capable ruler. Ganga handed her son to Shantanu as per her promise and the young Devavrata was known as Gangadatta as he was handed over by Ganga.  Bhishma's Oath  Originally named Devavrata, he became known as Bhishma after he took the bhishamna pratigya ('fierce oath') ‚Äî the vow of lifelong Brahmacharya (celibacy) and of service to whosoever sat on the throne of his father. Devarata taking his oath Having joined his father's court, Bhishma was easily confirmed as the heir apparent. Having undergone a successful military campaign, and being the child of a goddess himself, he was loved by all in the city. Shantanu was proud of his son and content that the future was secure. However, the king had slowly been falling in love with a fisherwoman, Satyavati, who operated the boats crossing the Yamuna, one of Hastinapur's rivers. When Shantanu approached for her hand in marriage, Satyavati's father, Dasraj, refused to give his daughter's hand to Shantanu unless Shantanu would proclaim the children born to her as his heirs. However, doing so would be against the merit-based hereditary rules of Bharat, and Shantanu had already promised the throne to Bhishma. So, Shantanu sorrowfully had to reject the offer. This made Shantanu despondent, and upon discovering the reason for his father's despondency, Devavrata sought out the girl's father and ceded his claim to the throne. At this, Satyavati's father retorted that even if Devavratha gave up his claim to the throne, Devavrata's children would still claim the throne. Devavrata then took the vow of lifelong celibacy, thus sacrificing his 'crown-prince' title and denying himself the pleasures of conjugal love. His father granted him the boon of Ichcha Mrityu (control over his own death ‚Äì he could choose the time of his death, making him immortal till his chosen time of death). Criticism of King Shantanu from his subjects as to why he removed Bhishma from the title of the crown prince, as he was so capable, abounded. There was worry about the nobility of Shantanu's unborn children, now promised the throne. Hearing this, Bhishma said it was his decision and his father should not be blamed as Shantanu had never promised anything to Satyavati's father. The prime minister then asked who would be held responsible if the future crown prince isn't capable enough. Bhishma then took another vow that he would always see his father's image in whoever sat on the King's throne, and would thus serve the king faithfully & truthfully. Abduction of the princesses of Kashi alt= Years later, in the process of finding a bride for his half-brother, the young king Vichitravirya, Bhishma abducted princesses Amba, Ambika and Ambalika of Kashi from the assemblage of suitors at their swaymvara. Salwa, the ruler of Saubala, and Amba (the eldest princess) were in love; Salwa attempted to stop the abduction but was soundly beaten. Upon reaching Hastinapura, Amba confided in Bhishma that she wished to wed Salwa. Bhishma then sent her back to Salwa, who, bitter from his humiliating defeat at Bhishma's hands, turned her down. She then retired to Bhishma for Vichitravirya who refused to accept citing the rules that what once given cannot be taken back. Amba then sorrowfully, repair to an asylum of ascetics out of city. She then explains everything to them. They made her meet with Parasurama. Hearing the words of the princess, Parasurama asked her motive. As per the words of ascetics, she asked him to slay that Bhishma of great vows, who is the root of her calamity. Amba sought refuge with Parasurama, who ordered Bhishma to marry Amba, telling Bhishma it was his duty. Bhishma politely refused, saying that he was ready to give up his life at the command of his teacher but not the promise that he had made. Both mocks each other and upon the refusal, Parasurama called him for a fight at Kurukshetra. At the battlegrounds, while Bhishma was on a chariot, Parasurama was on foot. Bhishma requested Parasurama to also take a chariot and armour so that Bhishma would not have an unfair advantage. Parasurama blessed Bhishma with the power of divine vision and asked him to look again. When Bhishma looked at his guru with the divine eyesight, he saw the Earth as Parasurama's chariot, the four Vedas as the horses, the Upanishads as the reins, Vayu (wind) as the Charioteer and the Vedic goddesses Gayatri, Savitri, and Saraswati as his armour. Bhishma got down from the chariot and sought the blessings of Parashurama to protect his dharma, along with permission to battle against his teacher. Pleased, Parashurama blessed him and advised him to protect his vow as Parasurama himself had to fight to uphold his word as given to Amba. They fought for 23 days, each knocking out other at a time, used even the celestial weapons, but each was too powerful to defeat the other. Their battle lasted for 23 days. But on 22nd night, he asked the gods to show him a way to vanquish Parasurama, at night. In his dream, his ancestors came and provided him the knowledge of Praswapa weapon, not known to any persons on earth. On 23rd day of battle, when battle didn't conclude, Bhishma attempted to use the Prashwapastra against Parashurama. This weapon was not known to Parasurama and would put the afflicted to sleep in the battlefield. Before Bhishma could release it, however, a voice from the sky warned him that \\"if he uses this weapon it would be a great insult towards his Guru.\\" Pitrs then appeared and obstructed the chariot of Parashurama, forbidding him from fighting any longer. At the behest of the divine sage Narada and the gods, Parashurama ended the conflict and the battle was declared stale mate.(effect of any astra on parashurama is not clear as he is avatara of Lord Vishnu and chiranjivi). In another version, Parashurama himself stopped the fight after twenty-three days, worried that the further use of powerful weapons may lead to the destruction of the world. Parashurama narrated the events to Amba and told her to seek Bhishma's protection. However, Amba refused to listen to Parashurama's advice and left angrily declaring that she would achieve her objective by asceticism. Her predicament unchanged, she did severe austerities to please Shiva. She was cursed by Ganga, during her penances, when she didn't listen to her words. Lord Shiva assured her that she would be born as a man named (Shikhandi) in her next birth (and still she would recall her past) and could be instrumental in Bhishma's death, thus satisfying her vow. She then made funeral pyre of woods, on the banks of the Yamuna, setting fire to it herself entered that blazing fire with wrath, uttering-'I do so for Bhishma's destruction!' In The Kurukshetra War In the great battle at Kurukshetra, Bhishma was the supreme commander of the Kaurava forces for ten days. He fought reluctantly on the side of the Kauravas. Bhishma was one of the most powerful warriors of his time and in history. He acquired his prowess and invincibility from being the son of the sacred Ganga and by being a student of Lord Parashurama. Despite being about five generations old, Bhishma was too powerful to be defeated by any warrior alive at that time. Every day, he slew at least 10,000 soldiers and about a 1,000 rathas. At the beginning of the war, Bhishma vowed not to kill any of the Pandavas, as he loved them, being their grand-uncle. Duryodhana often confronted Bhishma alleging that he was not actually fighting for the Kaurava camp as he wouldn't kill any of the Pandavas. He also did not allow any of the Kauravas to be killed in the war, as he loved all his grand- nephews and wanted a peace negotiation. Arjuna fights Bhishma Duryodhana approached Bhishma one night and accused him of not fighting the battle to his full strength because of his affection for the Pandavas. On the next day there was an intense battle between Bhishma and Arjuna. Although Arjuna was very powerful, he was not fighting seriously as his heart was not in it to hurt his beloved grandsire Bhishma. Bhishma fired arrows such that Arjuna and Krishna were both injured. That angered Krishna who took vow of not raising a weapon in the war, lifted a chariot wheel and threatened Bhishma. Arjuna stopped Lord Krishna. Arjuna convinced Krishna to return to the chariot and put down the wheel, promising to fight with all his might and stop Bhishma. Thus Bhishma fulfilled his vow and then Arjuna used stronger weapons making Bhishma injure a little. Bhishma and Arjuna's duel was praised by the gods themselves and they used to watch it over the sky. alt= The war was thus locked in a stalemate. As the Pandavas mulled over this situation, Krishna advised them to visit Bhishma himself and request him to suggest a way out of this stalemate. Bhishma loved the Pandavas and knew that he stood as an obstacle in their path to victory and so when they visited Bhishma, he gave them a hint as to how they could defeat him. He told them that if faced by one who had once been of the opposite gender, he would lay down his arms and fight no longer. Later Krishna told Arjuna how he could bring down Bhishma, through the help of Shikhandi. The Pandavas were not agreeable to such a ploy, as by using such tactics they would not be following the path of Dharma, but Krishna suggested a clever alternative. And thus, on the next day, the tenth day of battle Shikhandi accompanied Arjuna on the latter's chariot and they faced Bhishma who did not fire arrows at Shikhandi. He was then felled in battle by Arjuna, pierced by innumerable arrows. With Sikhandhi in front, Bhishma did not even look at that direction, Arjuna shot arrows at Bhishma, piercing his entire body. Thus, as was preordained (Mahadeva's boon to Amba that she would be the cause of Bhishma's fall) Shikhandi, that is, Amba reincarnated was the cause of Bhishma's fall. As Bhishma fell, his whole body was held above the ground by the shafts of Arjuna's arrows which protruded from his back, and through his arms and legs. Seeing Bhishma lying on such a bed of arrows humbled even the gods who watched from the heavens in reverence. They silently blessed the mighty warrior. When the young princes of both armies gathered around him, inquiring if there was anything they could do, he told them that while his body lay on the bed of arrows above the ground, his head hung unsupported. Hearing this, many of the princes, both Kaurava and the Pandava alike brought him pillows of silk and velvet, but he refused them. He asked Arjuna to give him a pillow fit for a warrior. Arjuna then removed three arrows from his quiver and placed them underneath Bhishma's head, the pointed arrow tips facing upwards. To quench the war veteran's thirst, Arjuna shot an arrow into the earth, and a jet stream of water rose up and into Bhishma's mouth. It is said that Ganga herself rose to quench her son's thirst. Death Bhishma on the bed of arrows After the war, while on his deathbed (arrow bed), he gave deep and meaningful instructions to Yudhishthira on statesmanship and the duties of a king. Bhishma always gave priority to Dharma. He always walked in the path of Dharma, despite his state because of the vow, he was supposed to forcefully follow the orders of his king Dhritharashtra, which were mostly Adharma, he was totally upset. He was sure he must let dharma win and Pandavas win, but the way he led the war and stayed silent were his sins in a way and he paid for it with the bed of arrows. Finally, Bhishma gave up the fight, focusing his life force and breath, sealing the wounds, and waiting for the auspicious moment to give up his body on the arrow bed. He did wait for about 58 nights for the winter solstice or first day of Uttarayana to give up his body on the arrow bed. Mahabharata states that he attained salvation after his death. He was granted the Maatru Lok (which is considered even above Swarga, the heaven). Magha (month) Shukla Ashtami marks the death anniversary of Bhishma Pitamah(Father), the day being known as Bhishma Ashtami. Hindus observe Ekodishta ≈örƒÅddha for him on this day, since many generations, and can only be performed by those whose fathers are not alive. Bhishma Panchaka vrata(fast) is observed in all Vishnu temples, starting from Bhishma Ashtami, for five days till Bhishma Dwadasi. People believe that they will be blessed with a son, having the steadfast qualities of Bhishma if they observe these holy rituals on the river banks.

One species of Luzuriaga occurs in New Zealand, and the genus Drymophila is endemic to south- eastern Australia. The genus Alstroemeria, commonly called the Peruvian lilies, are popular florist's and garden flowers. The genus Bomarea is a vine that produces clusters of variously-colored, bell-shaped flowers. Classification The APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, of 1998), treats the family in the order Liliales, in the clade monocots. The APG III system, of 2009, merged the obscure family Luzuriagaceae into the Alstroemeriaceae, since the former group included only two genera, was the sister group of the Alstroemeriaceae, and possessed the same distinctive twisted petioles. ;Tribe Alstroemerieae *Alstroemeria *Bomarea ;Tribe Luzuriageae *Drymophila *Luzuriaga Distribution Alstroemeriaceae is distributed in tropical and temperate America, from Mexico and the Antilles to Tierra del Fuego. Luzuriageae is distributed from Peru to the Falkland Islands and Tierra del Fuego, New Zealand and Australia (NSW to Tasmania). Uses =As food= Bomarea edulis is distributed from Mexico to Argentina. Its tubers have been used from pre-Columbian times as a food source. A single plant can have up to 20 tubers each 5 cm in diameter. =As ornamental plants= Some of the Alstroemeriaceae species used for ornamental purposes are: *Alstroemeria aurea: endemic to Southern Chile. Flowers in the summer. Flowers are 3‚Äì4 cm in diameter, they're yellow and orange, tinged with green. *Alstroemeria haemantha: endemic to Chile, especially near Valpara√≠so. It grown near rocks and flowers at the beginning of summer. It has red flowers that can grow up to 5 cm in diameter. Florece a principios de verano. *Alstroemeria ligtu: endemic to Chile, it grows in stoney, sand, dry soil. It flowers at the end of spring and the beginning of summer and has a height of 60 cm‚Äì1 m. Its flowers present several colours, usually lilac and pink, red or white. *Alstroemeria psittacina: distributed in the Brazilian swamp, Peru and the Misiones Province in Argentina. Its flowers have a length of 4‚Äì5 cm, and grow in bunches of 5 to 6 flowers. Its petals are red and green. *Bomarea ovallei (syn.: Leontochir ovallei): endemic to Chile, grows in stoney soil in full sunlight in the 3rd Region of Chile. It has red flowers, which can also be yellow, although rarely. They can have a diameter of up to 10 cm. It is an endangered species due to its modest distribution and its use as food by wild animals. Other species, such as Luzuriaga radicans, also endemic to Chile, have potential as ornamental plants. Bibliography * Anton Hofreiter & R. E.

The sandcrawler is a fictional transport vehicle in the Star Wars universe that is found on the desert planet Tatooine. The vehicle, as it appears in its major appearances in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, is 37 meters long and 18 meters tall. Only a 27-meter length of its lower hull was constructed as a set for the film. Other appearances were simulated with matte paintings and a remote-controlled model.  Origin and design  The design of the sandcrawler was first inspired by photographs of a NASA-designed rover created to explore alien planets. It was conceived as large, old, very rusty, and having treads. The front of the vehicle was envisioned to have a mouth- like scoop that lowered with hydraulics to pick up things, like a garbage truck. While its original design was streamlined, it was modified to be taller and more awkward-looking. The final design was created on April 5, 1975.  Production  The prefabricated movie set of the sandcrawler was shipped from England and took special effects genius John Stears and his crew four days to move it thirty miles into the Tunisian desert. It was two stories tall and ninety feet long when it was fully assembled, with the caterpillar tracks being almost twice as tall as a person, and covered in sand and mud to give them a \\"used\\" look. The night before the scene with the Jawas was to be shot, a sandstorm blew apart the set, and it took a day to put it back together and an additional day to shoot the scene. Afterwards, it was transformed into a burned-out hulk, taking another day. The construction of the sandcrawler piqued the interest of the Libyan government, who sent inspectors across the border to make sure it was not an actual military vehicle of some kind.  Depiction  Most sandcrawlers are homes to Jawas. They were originally constructed in Corellia for the purpose of serving as ore haulers during mining operations, and many were brought to Tatooine when it was first settled as a mining colony. When the mining industry collapsed they were abandoned and the native Jawa took them over. The number of sandcrawlers is unknown on Tatooine because most Jawa clans only meet during the annual \\"swap meets\\" when Jawa clans meet to trade with each other. Jawa clans usually worship the Sandcrawler they have inhabited for generations. The Sandcrawler is powered by eight massive turbines to power the treads which pull it over the dunes of the desert. Since repairs are not done thoroughly, sandcrawlers are liable to fail at any time. Within the Sandcrawler are a maze of tunnels, living quarters and rooms which keep spare parts, machinery and captured droids. The front of the Sandcrawler opens to form a large ramp though there are also hatches between the giant treads that provide access to and from the crawler. They are powerful enough to withstand Tusken Raiders but are no match for Imperial Stormtroopers. The Sandcrawler first appeared in the 1977 film Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, where R2-D2 and C-3PO were transported across the desert terrain of Tatooine. They make a cameo appearance in Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace in the establishing shot for the podrace, and also appeared in the Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones when Anakin Skywalker asks a Jawa leader for directions to a Tusken Raider camp. One also appeared in the post credits of a documentary on The Phantom Menace DVD. It was shown during the podrace, moving faster than and overtaking Sebulba's podracer. A Sandcrawler and Jawas are also seen in the final sequence of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker when Rey arrives on Tatooine. Sandcrawlers, or early predecessors, have made appearances in many Star Wars video games, such as Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (used by the Czerka Corporation), and Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy. The vehicle appears in the Disney+ series The Mandalorian, in a scene where the titular character pursues a sandcrawler carrying the scavenged parts from his ship. Cultural references A 17-inch, radio-controlled toy Sandcrawler was released in 1979 as part of the original Kenner Star Wars toy line; a recolored version with a more \\"authentic\\" painted surface was issued in 2004. In 2005, Lego came out with a detailed model. Lucasfilm's Singapore base is shaped and named after the Sandcrawler.Singapore, Lucasfilm. Retrieved 10 April 2019.

Usage by the United States on government maps in the 1940s as a political term included territories claimed by the Republic of China that were part of the previous empire, or geographically to refer to topographical features associated with China that may or may not have lain entirely within Chinese political borders. The concept began to appear again in Chinese-language sources in the late 1970s, referring the growing commercial ties between the mainland and Hong Kong, with the possibility of extending these to Taiwan, with perhaps the first such reference being in a Taiwanese journal Changqiao in 1979. The English term subsequently re-emerged in the 1980s to refer to the growing economic ties between the regions as well as the possibility of political unification. It is not an institutionalized entity such as the EU, ASEAN, or AU. The concept is a generalization to group several markets seen to be closely linked economically and does not imply sovereignty.

Early years Mackenzie was born in Edinburgh. His family emigrated to New Zealand in 1858 when he was four and Mackenzie was educated at Green Island School and at the Stone School, both in Dunedin. He tried his hand at surveying, farming and commerce. Member of Parliament Mackenzie was elected to the New Zealand Parliament for Clutha in 1887. He resigned in 1896 to assess the British markets for New Zealand products and remained in his native land for three years. On his return to New Zealand he was elected to Parliament successively for Waihemo ‚Äì1902, Waikouaiti 1902‚Äì1908, Taieri 1908‚Äì1911 and Egmont (in the North Island) 1911‚Äì1912, never losing an election. Mackenzie was also a notable explorer. He was a member of expeditions to the Tautuku Forest (1883), the wild country between Milford Sound and Lake Te Anau (1888; discovered the Sutherland Falls), and the Matterhorn Mountains (1888; discovered a pass between Lake Manapouri and Hall Arm). He was the first person to try to map an overland route to Dusky Sound (1894-1896). He crossed the land between Lake Te Anau and Lake Wakatipu in 1907. Minister and Prime Minister In January 1909 he was appointed Minister of Industries and Commerce, Tourist and Health Resorts, Scenery Preservation and State Forestry Departments in the government of Sir Joseph Ward. In May he also became Minister of Agriculture with a seat in the Cabinet. He was then successively Minister of Customs, Minister of Education and Postmaster-General. In May 1912 he succeeded Ward as Prime Minister and also served as Minister of Lands. Mackenzie's Ministry was criticised by both the opposition and Liberal dissidents. Liberal MP Roderick McKenzie stated that Mackenzie's ministers were political novices who had forsaken their liberal principles and John Millar should have been Ward's successor as Prime Minister. The Mackenzie government survived only until July 1912 when he lost a vote of no confidence and was appointed High Commissioner in London. He served in this role until 1920 and was New Zealand delegate at the peace conferences with Austria, Bulgaria and Turkey in 1919, a member of the Dardanelles Commission and the Imperial War Graves Commission (later the Commonwealth War Graves Conmmission). In March 1921 he was appointed member of the New Zealand Legislative Council for Otago. Later years He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 1916 New Year Honours (1 January 1916) and promoted to Knight Grand Cross (GCMG) in June 1920. His son Clutha Mackenzie who was blinded at Gallipoli was active in work for the blind. In 1923 he supported Val Sanderson in establishing the Native Bird Protection Society (later the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand) and was the society's first president. Mackenzie died in Dunedin in 1930 and was buried in the Dunedin Northern Cemetery.

The gang eventually spread to much of the Northeastern United States. Like the Young Lords, they were involved in Puerto Rican nationalism, including, in the case of the Ghetto Brothers, an association with the then-new Puerto Rican Socialist Party. This gang had political motivation to uplift young Latino and Black men in the community. The name Ghetto Brothers was chosen by Hui Cambrelen one of the original founders along with Ray delaVega and Benji Melendez. Benjamin Melendez, who left the organization in 1976, was also known as a guitarist. He led a band, also known as the Ghetto Brothers, which included his late brother Victor Melendez on bass. They released one album Ghetto Brothers - Power-Fuerza in 1971, which had only informal, local distribution. It has since been re- released on CD. The Ghetto Brothers, especially in their early years, had a reputation as one of the more politically minded and less vengeful of New York-area gangs. After Cornell \\"Black Benjie\\" Benjamin was killed in 1971 trying to prevent a fight between two rival gangs, the Ghetto Brothers did not seek the expected revenge on those responsible for his death. Instead, under Melendez's leadership (and that of Carlos Antonio Suarez, also known as Carlos Melendez), they were instrumental in achieving a moderately successful truce among South Bronx and other New York-area gangs at the December 7, 1971, Hoe Avenue peace meeting. Under Melendez's leadership, the Ghetto Brothers represented one end of the spectrum in terms of how they treated the women involved with the gang. Referred to as the Ghetto Sisters--the respectful term contrasted sharply with the names used for the women attached to other New York gangs of the period--the women were generally viewed as organization members and as girlfriends, whereas many other gangs treated women almost entirely as sexual property. Former Hartford, Connecticut mayor Eddie Perez was a member of the Ghetto Brothers when young. New York Daily News columnist Robert Dominguez was the leader of a Ghetto Brothers division in the Bronx when he was a teen. In the Connecticut prison system, during the 1990s, the Ghetto Brothers and the Savage Nomads joined together to form Los Solidos (the Solid Ones), which is now one of the most powerful Puerto Rican gangs in the state.

The events took place on the night of May 21, 1979 (the next night would have been Milk's 49th birthday) in San Francisco. Earlier that day, White had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter, the lightest possible conviction for his actions. That White was not convicted of first- degree murder (with which he was originally charged) had so outraged the city's gay community that it set off the most violent reaction by gay Americans since the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City (which is credited as the beginning of the modern gay rights movement in the United States). The gay community of San Francisco had a longstanding conflict with the San Francisco Police Department. White's status as a former police officer intensified the community's anger at the SFPD. Initial demonstrations took place as a peaceful march through the Castro district of San Francisco. After the crowd arrived at the San Francisco City Hall, violence began. The events caused hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of property damage to City Hall and the surrounding area, as well as injuries to police officers and rioters. Several hours after the riot had been broken up, police made a retaliatory raid on a gay bar in San Francisco's Castro District. Many patrons were beaten by police in riot gear. Two dozen arrests were made during the course of the raid, and several people later sued the SFPD. In the following days, gay leaders refused to apologize for the events of that night. This led to increased political power in the gay community, which culminated in the election of Mayor Dianne Feinstein to a full term the following November. In response to a campaign promise, Feinstein appointed a pro-gay Chief of Police, which increased recruitment of gay people in the police force and eased tensions. Background =Gay history of San Francisco= The American settlers who moved west toward California in the 18th and 19th centuries were largely male prospectors and miners. Events such as the California Gold Rush created a broadly male society in that region. Romantic friendships were common, and often tolerated.Katz (1976), pp. 508‚Äì510. As San Francisco was settled the ratio of men to women remained disproportionately high, resulting in the growth of a culture that was more open-minded towards homosexuality. The city's notorious brothel district ‚Äì named the Barbary Coast ‚Äì earned the city a reputation as a lawless and amoral society leading to San Francisco becoming known as \\"Sodom by the Sea.\\"Stryker & Van Buskirk (1996), pp. 18. The end of Prohibition prompted the opening of several gay bars along North Beach. The most notable of these were the Black Cat where female impersonation shows became the main draw, and a lesbian bar known as Mona's.Stryker & Van Buskirk (1996), pp. 22‚Äì24. During World War II, San Francisco became a major debarkation point for servicemen stationed in the Pacific Theater. The U.S. military, which was concerned about male homosexuality, had a policy of dismissing servicemen caught in known gay establishments with blue discharges. As many of these men faced ostracism from their communities and families, they chose to remain in the city. The number of men that remained was a significant factor in the creation of a homosexual community in San Francisco. =Gay activism in San Francisco= In 1951, the California Supreme Court affirmed in Stoumen v. Reilly the right of homosexuals to assemble peacefully. To assist homosexuals with legal problems, in 1951 labor activist Harry Hay started the Mattachine Society, from his living room in Los Angeles. A few years later, Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin started the Daughters of Bilitis with six other women in San Francisco, initially to have a place to socialize without fear of harassment or arrest.Katz (1976), pp. 406‚Äì433. Within a few years, both organizations learned of each other and grew to have similar goals: helping assimilate homosexuals into general society, working for legal reform to repeal sodomy laws, and assisting those who were arrested. Both groups were headquartered in San Francisco by 1957.Stryker & Van Buskirk (1996), p. 41. Police continued to arrest homosexuals in large numbers, routinely bringing paddy wagons to gay bars and arresting their patrons. Charges were usually dismissed but those arrested often lost their anonymity when newspapers printed their names, addresses and places of employment. Officers also notified the employer and family of the accused, causing serious damage to their reputations. In 1964, a New Year's Eve benefit event was held for the Council on Religion and the Homosexual. Police stood outside with large floodlights, and in an effort to intimidate took photographs of anyone entering the building. Later, several officers demanded that they be allowed inside. Three lawyers explained to them that under California law, the event was a private party and they could not enter unless they bought tickets. The lawyers were then arrested. Several ministers who were in attendance held a press conference the next morning, likening the SFPD to the Gestapo. Even the Catholic archbishop strongly condemned the actions of the police. In an attempt to reduce such harassment two officers were tasked with improving the police department's relationship with the gay community. The Mattachine Society and Daughters of Bilitis promoted non-confrontational education for homosexuals and heterosexuals, hoping to prove that homosexuals were respectable and normal. Living beyond the mostly white, middle class scope of these groups was an active community of cross-dressers, hustlers, and \\"street queens\\" who worked primarily in the Tenderloin district of the city. After being denied service at Gene Compton's Cafeteria, a few activists picketed the restaurant in 1966. A few days later, early in the morning, the police arrived to arrest patrons in drag. A riot ensued when a drag queen threw the contents of a cup of coffee in the face of a police officer in response to the officer's grabbing of her arm. The cafe's plate glass windows were shattered in the mel√©e, and then again a few days later after they had been replaced. Although three years later the Stonewall Riots would have a more significant impact, the Compton's Cafeteria riots were among the first in American history where homosexuals and the newly forming transgender community fought against the authorities.A smaller-scale riot broke out in 1959 in Los Angeles, when the drag queens and street hustlers at Cooper Donuts, who were frequently harassed by the LAPD, fought back after police arrested three people, including John Rechy. Patrons began pelting the police with donuts and coffee cups. The LAPD called for back-up and arrested a number of rioters. Rechy and the other two original detainees were able to escape (Faderman and Timmons, pp. 1‚Äì2). =Political clout= San Francisco continued to grow as a haven for homosexuals. North Beach and Polk Street had been quiet neighborhoods each with a large homosexual population, but in the 1960s the growth of the Castro District outpaced either of them. Thousands of gay men migrated to San Francisco, turning the quiet Irish working-class neighborhood around Castro Street into a bustling center of activity. Meanwhile, many lesbians moved their homes and businesses to nearby Valencia Street in the Mission District.Bonnie Zimmerman, Encyclopedia of Lesbian Histories and Cultures, Routledge, Aug 21, 2013 New Yorker Harvey Milk resettled on Castro Street in 1972, and opened Castro Camera the following year. Dissatisfied with the level of bureaucratic apathy and indifference toward the gay community, Milk decided to run for city supervisor. Through his multiple campaigns, culminating in his 1977 election, he became the political voice for the gay community, promoting himself as the \\"Mayor of Castro Street.\\" By 1977, 25 percent of the population of San Francisco was reported to be gay. On Labor Day of 1974, tensions between the gay community and the SFPD came to a head when a man was beaten and arrested while walking down Castro Street. Police reinforcements suddenly appeared on the street, their badge numbers hidden, and beat dozens of gay men. Of these, 14 were arrested and charged with obstructing a sidewalk.Shilts (1982), pp. 92‚Äì93 Harvey Milk dubbed them the \\"Castro 14\\", and a $1.375 million lawsuit was filed against the police. In 1975, after George Moscone had been elected Mayor, he appointed Charles Gain as his Chief of Police. Gain, whose conciliatory position towards African Americans had branded him as one of the most liberal law enforcement officers in the country, soon earned the ire of the police force.Shilts (1982), pp. 120‚Äì121 Gain implemented policies that proved unpopular with his staff, such as painting police cars powder blue, and barring officers from drinking on the job. His lenient policies towards gays also angered the police force. When asked what he would do if a gay police officer came out, Gain replied \\"I certainly think that a gay policeman could be up front about it under me. If I had a gay policeman who came out, I would support him 100 percent.\\" This statement sent shock waves through the police department, and made national headlines. Made during the first week of Gain's tenure, the remark also made Mayor Moscone extremely unpopular with the police. The two were so intensely disliked by the police that in 1977 rumors circulated about a plan by right-wing police officers to assassinate Gain,Shilts (1982), p. 201 and a year later similar plans formed targeting Mayor Moscone. Upon being informed of this threat, Moscone hired a bodyguard. =Assassinations= San Francisco City Hall, where the killings took place. The building was heavily damaged during the riots. Dissatisfied with city politics, and in financial difficulty due to his failing restaurant business and low annual salary of $9,600, former police officer and Supervisor Dan White resigned from the San Francisco Board of Supervisors on November 10, 1978.Shilts (1982), p. 250 However, after a meeting with the Police Officers' association and the Board of Realtors, White announced that he wanted his seat back. Liberal Supervisors saw this as an opportunity to end the 6-5 split on the Board that blocked progressive initiatives they wanted to introduce. After intense lobbying by Supervisors Milk and Silver, as well as State Assemblyman Willie Brown, Moscone announced on November 26, 1978, that he would not be reappointing Dan White to the seat he had vacated.Shilts (1982), pp. 254‚Äì262 The next morning White went to City Hall armed with his police .38 Smith & Wesson revolver and 10 extra cartridges in his coat pocket. To avoid the metal detector he entered the building through a basement window, and proceeded to the office of Mayor George Moscone. Following a brief argument, White shot the Mayor in the shoulder and chest, and then twice in the head. White then walked to his former office, reloading his gun, and asked Milk to join him. White then shot Milk in the wrist, shoulder and chest, and then twice in the head, execution style. Supervisor Dianne Feinstein heard the gunshots and called the police, who found Milk on his stomach, blood pouring out of his head wounds. Riots =Dan White verdict= On May 21, 1979, White was found guilty of the voluntary manslaughter of Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Milk. The prosecutor asked for a finding of first-degree murder with \\"special circumstances\\", which would have permitted the death penalty under the terms of a recently adopted capital punishment law in California, Proposition 7. The \\"special circumstances\\" alleged in this case were that Mayor Moscone had been killed in order to block the appointment of someone to fill the City Supervisor seat from which Dan White had resigned, and also that multiple people were killed. White's sentence was reduced due in part to the so-called Twinkie defense, a judgment that provoked outrage in the community. The \\"Twinkie\\" defense was presented by a psychiatrist to the jury, stating that White had a diminished capacity due to depression. The copious amounts of junk food White consumed are cited as a symptom of his mental state. The jury heard a tape recording of White's confession, which consisted of highly emotional ranting about the pressure he was under, and members of the jury wept in sympathy for the defendant.D'Emilio (1992), p. 92. White represented the \\"old guard\\" of San Francisco, who were wary of the influx of minority groups into the city and represented a more conservative, traditional view that the more liberal forces in the city, like Moscone and Milk, were perceived to be eroding. The San Francisco Police Department had, in conjunction with the fire department, raised more than $100,000 to defend White and wore shirts reading \\"Free Dan White,\\" which earned the anger of the gay community.Peddicord (1996), p. 88.Shilts (1982), p. 302. He received a conviction for the least serious offense, voluntary manslaughter, and was sentenced to seven years and eight months in Soledad prison. With good behavior he had the chance to be released after serving two-thirds of his sentence, about five years. Upon hearing the verdict, District Attorney Joseph Freitas, Jr., said \\"It was a wrong decision. The jury was overwhelmed by emotions and did not sufficiently analyze the evidence that this was deliberate, calculated murder.\\" In defense of his client, White's attorney Douglas Schmidt stated that White \\"is filled with remorse and I think he's in a very bad condition.\\" White would later confirm that the killings were premeditated. In 1984, he told former police Inspector Frank Falzon that not only had he planned to kill Moscone and Milk, but also had plans to kill Assemblyman Willie Brown and Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver. He believed that the four politicians were attempting to block his reinstatement as Supervisor. Falzon quoted White as having said, \\"I was on a mission. I wanted four of them. Carol Ruth Silver, she was the biggest snake ... and Willie Brown, he was masterminding the whole thing.\\" =March through the Castro= When told of the verdict, Milk's friend and activist Cleve Jones addressed an audience of about 500 people that had gathered on Castro Street, telling them of the verdict. With shouts of \\"Out of the bars and into the streets\\" Jones led a crowd down Castro street, its numbers bolstered by people emerging from each bar.Shilts (1982), pp. 326‚Äì332 The crowd circled around and marched through the Castro again, by now numbering about 1,500 people. In a 1984 interview, Jones gave a voice to the feeling in the crowd as they began to group together on Castro Street after news of the verdict spread, stating, \\"The rage in people's face‚ÄîI saw people I'd known for years, and they were so furious. That to me was the scariest thing. All these people I'd know from the neighborhood, boys from the corner, these people I'd ridden the bus with, just out there, screaming for blood.\\" =Violence at City Hall= Civic Center Plaza. Burning police cruisers are seen in the background By the time the crowd reached City Hall its numbers had increased to over 5,000. Protesters shouted slogans such as \\"Kill Dan White!\\" and \\"Dump Dianne!\\", a reference to Mayor Dianne Feinstein.As president of the Board of Supervisors upon the death of Mayor Moscone, Feinstein had succeeded to the mayoralty on December 4, 1978. The handful of police officers on duty at the scene were uncertain about how to deal with the situation, and the Police Department, which was unaccustomed to an angry gay crowd, was similarly uncertain of how to proceed. The protesters were convinced that the police and prosecution had conspired to avoid a severe sentence for White, although Prosecutor Thomas Norman denied this repeatedly until his death. Members of the crowd tore gilded ornamental work from the building's wrought iron doors and then used it to break first floor windows. Several of Harvey Milk's friends monitored and attempted to hold back the crowd, including Milk's long term partner Scott Smith. A formation of police appeared on the north side of the Civic Center Plaza, and those attempting to hold back the mob sat down, grateful for the reinforcements. The officers however did not restrain themselves to holding back the crowd, and instead attacked them with night sticks. One young man kicked and smashed the window of a police car, lit a pack of matches, and set the upholstery on fire. After burning for a short time, the fuel tank exploded; a dozen more police cars and eight other automobiles would be destroyed in a similar fashion. The photo on the front cover of the Dead Kennedys 1980 album Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables, which shows several police cars on fire, was taken that night. Several crowd members threw tear gas, which they had stolen from police vehicles. Riots began to break out, with one mob disrupting traffic. Electric trollies were disabled when their overhead wires were pulled down, and violence broke out against the police officers, who were outnumbered. Police Chief Charles Gain, standing inside City Hall, ordered officers not to attack and to simply stand their ground. Mayor Feinstein and Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver addressed the demonstrators in an attempt to defuse the situation. Mayor Feinstein said that she had received news of the verdict \\"with disbelief\\", and Supervisor Silver stated, \\"Dan White has gotten away with murder. It's as simple as that.\\" Silver was injured when struck by a flying object. More than 140 protesters were also injured. =Police retaliation= After nearly three hours of shouts from the angry crowd, officers moved in to quell the riot. Police reportedly covered their badges with black tape‚Äîpreventing any identification‚Äîand attacked rioters. Dozens of police officers swept into the crowd, using tear gas to force protesters away from the building. Police were surprised at the resistance they faced from the protesters, who attempted to push them back using tree branches, chrome torn off city buses, and asphalt ripped from the street, as weapons. As one man ignited the last police car he shouted to a reporter \\"Make sure you put in the paper that I ate too many Twinkies.\\"Shilts (1982), pp. 331‚Äì332 Sixty officers were injured, and about two dozen arrests were made. The second stage of the violence was a police raid/riot hours later in the predominantly gay Castro neighborhood, which vandalized the Elephant Walk bar and injured many of its occupants. After order was restored at City Hall, SFPD cars carrying dozens of officers headed into the Castro District. Officers entered a gay bar called the Elephant Walk, despite their orders not to do so. They shouted \\"dirty cocksuckers\\" and \\"sick faggots\\", shattered the large plate glass windows of the bar, and attacked patrons. After 15 minutes police withdrew from the bar and joined other officers who were indiscriminately attacking gays on the street. The incident lasted nearly two hours.Shilts (1982), pp. 332‚Äì334Woods (2003), pp. 95‚Äì96 When Police Chief Charles Gain heard about the unauthorized Elephant Walk raid, he immediately went to the location and ordered his men to leave. Later that night, freelance reporter Michael Weiss saw a group of police officers celebrating at a downtown bar. \\"We were at City Hall the day [the killings] happened and we were smiling then,\\" one officer explained. \\"We were there tonight and we're still smiling.\\" At least 61 police officers and an estimated 100 members of the public were hospitalized in the course of the riot. A civil grand jury convened to find out who ordered the attack, but it ended inconclusively with a settlement covering personal injury claims and damages. =Aftermath= The next morning gay leaders convened in a committee room in the Civic Center. Supervisor Harry Britt, who had replaced Milk, along with members of the Harvey Milk Democratic Club, made it clear that nobody was to apologize for the riots. Britt informed a press conference, \\"Harvey Milk's people do not have anything to apologize for. Now the society is going to have to deal with us not as nice little fairies who have hairdressing salons, but as people capable of violence. We're not going to put up with Dan Whites anymore.\\"Shilts (1982), pp. 334‚Äì339 Reporters were surprised that a public official would condone the violent acts of the previous night, expecting an apology from Britt. Subsequent attempts to find a gay leader who would give an apologetic statement proved unsuccessful. That evening, May 22, would have been the 49th birthday of Harvey Milk. City officials had considered revoking the permit for a rally planned for that night, but decided against it for fear of sparking more violence. Officials stated that the rally could channel the community's anger into something positive. Police from San Francisco and its neighboring towns were placed on alert by Mayor Feinstein, and Cleve Jones coordinated contingency plans with the police, and trained 300 monitors to keep an eye on the crowd. Approximately 20,000 people gathered on Castro and Market streets, where the mood was \\"angry, but subdued.\\" Officers monitored the crowd from a distance, however the crowd engaged in a peaceful celebration of Milk's life. Attendees danced to popular disco songs, drank beer, and sang a tribute to Milk. On the same night, for over three hours about a hundred people held a demonstration at Sheridan Square in Manhattan, to protest the verdict. About 20 officers observed the protest, which began at 8 pm, but no arrests were made. A candlelight vigil was planned for two days later, sponsored by the Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Rights and the National Gay Task Force. On October 14, 1979, between 75,000 and 125,000 people marched on Washington for gay rights. Many carried portraits of Milk, and placards honoring his legacy.Shilts (1982), p. 348 The rally, something that Milk had intended to organize, was instead a tribute to his life. Dan White was released from prison on January 14, 1984 after serving five years of a seven-year, eight- month sentence. On the evening following his release, 9,000 people marched down Castro street and burned his effigy. State authorities reportedly feared an assassination attempt, and in response Scott Smith urged people not to retaliate with violence. He stated, \\"Harvey was against the death penalty. He was a nonviolent person.\\" White committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning on October 21, 1985. He connected a rubber hose to his car's exhaust system and routed it to the interior of the vehicle, which he let fill with carbon monoxide. Mayor Feinstein said, \\"This latest tragedy should close a very sad chapter in this city's history.\\"Schreibman, Jack. \\"Man who used 'Twinkie Defense' Commits Suicide\\" Associated Press, reprinted in St. Petersburg Times. October 22, 1985 According to Orange County lawyer Jeff Walsworth, White had expressed remorse for the killings in February 1984. White reportedly stated that it would always cause him inner turmoil. Inspector Falzone said the contrary, however, commenting that at no time did White express remorse in any form at the deaths of Moscone and Milk. Analysis =Causes= San Francisco's Castro district became an early stronghold for the emerging gay community. The community had a long history of conflict with the San Francisco Police Department. Following World War II, gay bars were subject to frequent raids and attempts by the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to revoke their alcohol licenses.Shilts (1982), pp. 53‚Äì60 They were accused of serving alcohol to homosexuals, a criminal act at the time. The growing political and economic power of the city's gay community conflicted with the established but dwindling numbers of the conservative institutions, such as the police and fire departments. By 1971, police were arresting an average of 2,800 men per year on public sex charges; by contrast, 63 such arrests were made in New York City, although up to a quarter of San Francisco was reported to be gay at the time.Shilts (1982), pp. 62‚Äì63 Many charges were dismissed due to entrapment, but several men were given harsh sentences. In March, 1979, an attack on a lesbian bar by off-duty police officers made the national news and highlighted the tension between the LGBT community and police.Randy Shilts, The Mayor of Castro Street, Macmillan, 1988, p. 306 The Washington Post cited the incident when it reported a week before the White Night riots that anti- homosexual violence had \\"increased to a level unparalleled in San Francisco's recent history\\", including what the gay community perceived as \\"increasing harassment and abuse directed toward homosexuals by the police themselves,\\" as well as indifference by city officials.Paul Grabowicz, ‚ÄúAnti-Gay Sentiments Turn Violent in Aftermath of Moscone-Milk Killings,‚Äù Washington Post, May 12, 1979/ When Dan White was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter, his successful diminished capacity defense enraged the gay community. That the police and fire departments had raised money for his defense gave their anger a focus, turning it against the city government and especially the SFPD. =Effects on San Francisco politics= With the 1979 municipal elections occurring only months after the riot, prominent gay leaders feared a backlash at the polls.Shilts (1982), pp. 340‚Äì342 The elections continued without incident, and the gay community fared better than expected, wielding unprecedented influence. Although the virtually unknown gay Mayoral candidate David Scott finished third in the election, his showing was strong enough to force Mayor Feinstein into a runoff election against conservative City Supervisor Quentin Kopp. Feinstein's promises to appoint more gay people to public office, and her heavy campaigning in the Castro, ensured that she won enough support from the gay community to give her a full term as Mayor. One of Mayor Feinstein's first actions upon being elected was to announce the appointment of Cornelius Murphy as the new Chief of Police. Murphy declared that police cars would no longer be colored powder blue, but instead would be repainted as \\"macho black-and-whites.\\" This pleased the rank and file, and restored confidence in police leadership. Murphy also vowed to maintain the progressive policy towards gays that his predecessor had implemented. By 1980, one in seven new police recruits was either gay or lesbian. In one of his last public appearances, outgoing Police Chief Charles Gain stated that he fully expected to see the day when San Francisco would have both a gay mayor and Chief of Police. By October 1985, an organization for gay law enforcement personnel in California, the Golden State Peace Officers Association, had incorporated as a non-profit organization. It was founded by Art Roth, an Oakland police officer who was present on the night of the riots. Market Street in downtown San Francisco following the California Supreme Court ruling. Thirty years after the announcement of Dan White's guilty verdict, the Supreme Court of California prepared their decision on Strauss v. Horton. The case was an attempt to overturn Proposition 8, which had added the statement \\"Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California\\" to Article I, section 7.5 of the California State Constitution. This ballot initiative, which was approved in 2008, eliminated the right of same-sex couples to marry in the state. In late May 2009, while the Court was preparing its announcement, rumors surfaced on the Internet that San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom had asked the court not to announce the decision on May 21. They suggested that he made this request so that the announcement would not coincide with the 30th anniversary of the White Night riots. On May 26, the court upheld the validity of Proposition 8, but ruled that the 18,000 marriages that had already been performed would remain valid. In 2013, same- sex marriage again became legal when that voter initiative was ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court: Hollingsworth v. Perry. =Effects on the AIDS movement= The NAMES Project AIDS quilt, representing people who have died of AIDS, in front of the Washington Monument Cleve Jones played a major role in the investigation of the riots, and had since become a prominent activist. He dropped out of school to work as a legislative consultant to California State Assembly Speakers Leo McCarthy and Willie Brown. Shilts (1987), p. 17 He also spent time organizing political campaigns. In 1981, while working as a consultant to the California State Assembly Health Committee, he became aware of gay men in San Francisco contracting unusual diseases, such as Kaposi's sarcoma. The gay community was eventually seriously affected by the AIDS epidemic, and Jones became a key AIDS activist. Jones co- founded the Kaposi's Sarcoma Research & Education Foundation, which in 1982 became the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. On November 27, 1985, at a candlelight vigil on the anniversary of the Moscone-Milk assassinations, Jones learned that 1,000 people had died of AIDS. He proposed the creation of a quilt, in remembrance of those who had died. In 1987, Jones, by then HIV- positive himself, launched the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt. As of 2009, the quilt consists of over 44,000 individual panels. In a 2004 interview, Jones said \\"I thought, what a perfect symbol; what a warm, comforting, middle- class, middle-American, traditional-family-values symbol to attach to this disease that's killing homosexuals and IV drug users and Haitian immigrants, and maybe, just maybe, we could apply those traditional family values to my family.\\" See also * Gay Power, Gay Politics, an episode of CBS Reports about the San Francisco LGBT community, produced in the aftermath of the riots. * LGBT History * The Times of Harvey Milk, a 1984 documentary which describes the White Night riots. * Stonewall riots * List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States Notes References Bibliography    * External links * Video of the White Night riots * White Night riots account LGBT-related riots Riots and civil disorder in California History of LGBT civil rights in the United States LGBT history in San Francisco 1979 riots 1979 in LGBT history 1979 in California Politics of San Francisco Harvey Milk Castro District, San Francisco Crimes in San Francisco 1979 crimes in the United States May 1979 events in the United States 1979 in San Francisco Protests in the San Francisco Bay Area Police brutality in the United States ","title":"White Night riots"},{"id":"601721","text":"Map of Horado, Gifu was a village located in Mugi District, Gifu Prefecture, Japan.

The name is taken from the eastern Kulin language of the Bunnerong tribe and means \\"a place to meet and talk\\". Today the community of Jumbunna consists of 13 houses and about 30 residents in the township and 29 houses and 50 residents in the surrounding rural area. Farming (mainly in fat lamb, beef and dairy industries) continues and is now complemented by a diverse range of small businesses.  History  Jumbunna was once a thriving coal mining township. Land was opened up for selection in 1878. The Jumbunna Coal Company was registered in 1890, after T.W. Horsley discovered a seam in the area. The Company began operations in 1894. A Jumbunna Post Office opened on 1 May 1890. This was renamed Glen Alvie in 1893 when the railway arrived and a new Jumbunna office was opened near the station. This office closed in 1976. In its hey-day in 1901 the town boasted 153 houses and a population of approximately 800, many of whom lived in tents. The first house in Jumbunna (\\"Cora Lynn\\") was built in 1880 by John Glew. The shopping precinct at that time had amongst its businesses three grocers, two butchers, two bakers, two drapers, two boot repairers, one fancy goods shop, one barber, one wine saloon, one hotel, one iron mongery, three blacksmiths and several boarding houses, as well as a coffee salon. The Jumbunna General Store opened in 1893 and closed in 1976. (The Store building now has Category 1 heritage listing with the South Gippsland Shire Council.) There was also a school, at first using the Jumbunna Hall, which started in 1894. It continued in a new building from 1900 to 1977. Portable buildings were then used until 1986 after the sale of the school building. The Korumburra-Jumbunna Railway was constructed in 1893, was extended to Outtrim in 1896 and closed in 1953. Electricity was introduced to the town in 1930. After the miners' strike of 1903 to 1904, the town began to decline and many houses were shifted by bullock dray to Wonthaggi. The records show that the single stream mine continued producing until 1939. (From 1931-1939 it was operated by locals, including the Durkin family.) The top seam was re-opened in 1947 and worked by the Axford Leighton Syndicate until 1962. During the entire operation of the Jumbunna mine 1,364,376 tons of coal were produced. The coal mine, railway embankment, and railway line viaduct are listed in the Victorian Heritage Inventory.

In the early seventeenth century, this was in some dialects probably pronounced the same as Jansen, a name equivalent to Johnson in English. Surnames were usually not used and children were simply named for their father's given name. In areas where not many people lived, but also in towns and cities, he would simply be given the name Willem Jansz; thus, all that is known about him is that his father's name was Johannes or Jan. As in many countries, genealogical and historical research in the Netherlands can be difficult for this reason. See was a Dutch navigator and colonial governor. Janszoon served in the Netherlands East Indies in the periods 16031611 and 16121616, including as governor of Fort Henricus on the island of Solor.Mutch (1942), p43 He is the first European known to have seen the coast of Australia during his voyage of 16051606. Early life Willem Janszoon (Willem Jansz) was born around 1570, but nothing is known of his early life nor of his parents. Janszoon is first recorded as entering into the service of the Oude compagnie, one of the predecessors of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), in 1598 as a mate aboard the , part of the second fleet under Jacob Cornelisz. van Neck, dispatched by the Dutch to the Dutch East Indies.Mutch (1942), p13 On 5 May 1601, he again sailed for the East Indies as master of the Lam, one of three ships in the fleet of Joris van Spilbergen.Mutch (1942), p15 Janszoon sailed from the Netherlands for the East Indies for the third time on 18 December 1603, as captain of the (or Duijfken, meaning \\"Little Dove\\"), one of twelve ships of the great fleet of Steven van der Hagen.Mutch (1942), p17 When the other ships left Java, Janszoon was sent to search for other outlets of trade, particularly in \\"the great land of New Guinea and other East and Southlands\\". Exploration and discovery =First voyage to Australia= 19th-century artist impression of the ship Duyfken in the Gulf of Carpentaria On 18 November 1605, the Duyfken sailed from Bantam to the coast of western New Guinea. After that, Janszoon crossed the eastern end of the Arafura Sea into the Gulf of Carpentaria, without being aware of the existence of Torres Strait. The Duyfken was actually in Torres Strait in February 1606, a few months before Spanish explorer Lu√≠s Vaz de Torres sailed through it. On 26 February 1606, Janzoon made landfall at the Pennefather River on the western shore of Cape York in Queensland, near what is now the town of Weipa. This is the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent. Janszoon proceeded to chart some of the coastline, which he thought was a southerly extension of New Guinea. Finding the land swampy and the people inhospitable (ten of his men were killed on various shore expeditions), Janszoon decided to return at a place he named Cape Keerweer (\\"Turnabout\\"), south of Albatross Bay, and arrived back at Bantam in June 1606. He called the land he had discovered \\"Nieu Zeland\\", after the Dutch province of Zeeland, but the name was not adopted, and was later used by Dutch cartographers for New Zealand. In 1607, Admiral Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge sent Janzoon to Ambon and Banda.Dictionary of Australian Biography I-K. Gutenberg.net.au. Retrieved on 2 August 2013. In 1611, Janzoon returned to the Netherlands, believing that the south coast of New Guinea was joined to the land along which he had sailed, and Dutch maps reproduced that error for many years. Though there have been suggestions that earlier navigators from China, France or Portugal may have discovered parts of Australia earlier, the Duyfken is the first European vessel definitely known to have done so. =Second voyage to Australia= Janszoon reported that on 31 July 1618, he had landed on an island at 22¬∞ South with a length of 22 miles and 240 miles SSE of the Sunda Strait.Heeres (1899), p13 This is generally interpreted as a description of the peninsula from Point Cloates () to North West Cape () on the Western Australian coast, which Janszoon presumed was an island, without fully circumnavigating it.Mutch (1942), p46 Political life Willem Janszoon‚Äôs Vliege Bay, Dubbelde Rev., R. Visch, and Cape Keerweer on the coast of Nueva Guinea on Hessel Gerritszoon‚Äôs map of the Pacific Ocean, 1622. Around 1617/18 he was back in the Netherlands and was appointed as a member of the Council of the Indies. He served as admiral of the Dutch Defence fleet.Mutch (1942), p49 Janszoon was awarded a gold chain worth 1,000 guilders in 1619 for his part in capturing four ships of the British East India Company near Tiku on West Sumatra, which had aided the Javanese in their defence of the town of Jakarta against the Dutch.Mutch (1942), p48 In 1620 he was one of the negotiators with the English. In a combined fleet they sailed to Manila to prevent Chinese merchants dealing with the Spanish. Janszoon became vice-admiral, and the year later admiral. Near the end of his life, Janszoon served as governor of Banda (16231627).Mutch (1942), p50 He returned to Batavia in June 1627 and soon afterwards, as admiral of a fleet of eight vessels, went on a diplomatic mission to India.Mutch (1942), p51 On 4 December 1628, he sailed for Holland and on 16 July 1629, reported on the state of the Indies at The Hague. He was now probably about sixty years old and ready to retire from his strenuous and successful career in the service of his country. Nothing is known of his last days, but he is thought to have died in 1630. Records The original journal and log made during Janszoon‚Äôs 1606 voyage have been lost. The Duyfken chart, which shows the location of the first landfall in Australia by the Duyfken, had a better fate. It was still in existence in Amsterdam when Hessel Gerritszoon made his Map of the Pacific in 1622, and placed the Duyfken geography upon it, thus providing us with the first map to contain any part of Australia. The chart was still in existence around 1670, when a copy was made. This eventually went to the Imperial Library in Vienna and remained forgotten for two hundred years. The map is part of the Atlas Blaeu Van der Hem, brought to Vienna in 1730 by Prince Eugene of Savoy.

It is sometimes considered conspecific with its southern counterpart, the red-fronted tinkerbird, Pogoniulus pusillus. Barbets are near passerine birds with bristles around the base of the bill and a world-wide tropical distribution. Range and habitat The yellow-fronted tinkerbird is a widespread and frequently common resident breeder in much of Africa south of the Sahara Desert. It is associated with dry open woodland and scrub. Description The yellow-fronted tinkerbird is approximately in length. It is plump, with a short neck, large head, and short tail. The adult has black upperparts heavily streaked with yellow and white. Its head has a strong black and white pattern, with a yellow forecrown spot. The underparts and rump are lemon yellow. Both sexes are similar in appearance, but young birds have a differentiating dark crown that lacks the distinct yellow spot. Breeding An active nest cavity on the underside of a branch The species nests in tree holes and lays two or three eggs. Vocalizations At about 100 repetitions per minute, the yellow- fronted tinkerbird's call is a fast tink-tink-tink-tink. Many barbets perch prominently, but, unlike their larger relatives, the smaller tinkerbirds sing from cover and are more frequently heard than seen. Diet The yellow- fronted tinkerbird eats insects and fruit. Mistletoe fruits (Tapinanthus spp.) are swallowed whole. The sticky seeds are regurgitated and wiped off on nearby branches. Across their distribution range, yellow-fronted tinkerbirds are the most important disperser of mistletoes.S.K.B.

This alters the flavor, texture and appearance of the rice and helps prevent spoilage and extend its storage life. After milling, the rice is polished, resulting in a seed with a bright, white, shiny appearance. The milling and polishing processes both remove nutrients. A diet based on unenriched white rice leaves many people vulnerable to the neurological disease beriberi, due to a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). White rice is often enriched with some of the nutrients stripped from it during its processing. Enrichment of white rice with B1, B3, and iron is required by law in the United States. As with all natural foods, the precise nutritional composition of rice varies slightly depending on the variety, soil conditions, environmental conditions and types of fertilizers. Adopted over brown rice in the second half of the 19th century because it was favored by traders, white rice has led to a beriberi epidemic in Asia. At various times, starting in the 19th century, brown rice and wild rice have been advocated as more healthful alternatives. The bran in brown rice contains significant dietary fiber and the germ contains many vitamins and minerals. Typically, 100 grams of uncooked rice produces around 240 to 260 grams of cooked grains, the difference in weight being due to absorbed cooking water. Milling rice Before mechanical milling, rice was milled by a hand pounding technique with a large mortar and pestle type device. Some versions of this improved uniformity of the product, but with mechanical milling much larger quantities were able to be produced. In the late 19th century different machines were produced like the Huller & Sheller Mills (1870) and the Engleberg Milling Machine (1890). By 1955, new machinery had been developed in Japan that had significantly improved the quality and output capacity.

It was first conceptualized by Erving Goffman in 1959 in The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, and then was expanded upon in 1967. An example of impression management theory in play is in sports such as soccer. At an important game, a player would want to showcase themselves in the best light possible, because there are college recruiters watching. This person would have the flashiest pair of cleats and try and perform their best to show off their skills. Their main goal may be to impress the college recruiters in a way that maximizes their chances of being chosen for a college team rather than winning the game. Impression management is usually used synonymously with self-presentation, in which a person tries to influence the perception of their image. The notion of impression management was first applied to face-to-face communication, but then was expanded to apply to computer-mediated communication. The concept of impression management is applicable to academic fields of study such as psychology and sociology as well as practical fields such as corporate communication and media.  Background  The foundation and the defining principles of impression management were created by Erving Goffman in The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. Impression management theory states that one tries to alter one's perception according to one's goals. In other words, the theory is about how individuals wish to present themselves, but in a way that satisfies their needs and goals. Goffman \\"proposed to focus on how people in daily work situations present themselves and, in so doing, what they are doing to others\\", and he was \\"particularly interested in how a person guides and control how others form an impression of them and what a person may or may not do while performing before them\\".  Theory  = Motives = A range of factors that govern impression management can be identified. It can be stated that impression management becomes necessary whenever there exists a kind of social situation, whether real or imaginary. Logically, the awareness of being a potential subject of monitoring is also crucial. Furthermore, the characteristics of a given social situation are important. Specifically, the surrounding cultural norms determine the appropriateness of particular nonverbal behaviours.Kamau, C. (2009) Strategising impression management in corporations: cultural knowledge as capital. In D. Harorimana (Ed) Cultural implications of knowledge sharing, management and transfer: identifying competitive advantage. Chapter 4. Information Science Reference. The actions have to be appropriate to the targets, and within that culture, so that the kind of audience as well as the relation to the audience influences the way impression management is realized. A person's goals are another factor governing the ways and strategies of impression management. This refers to the content of an assertion, which also leads to distinct ways of presentation of aspects of the self. The degree of self-efficacy describes whether a person is convinced that it is possible to convey the intended impression.Doering 1999, p. 261-2. A new study finds that, all other things being equal, people are more likely to pay attention to faces that have been associated with negative gossip than those with neutral or positive associations. The study contributes to a body of work showing that far from being objective, human perceptions are shaped by unconscious brain processes that determine what they \\"choose\\" to see or ignore‚Äîeven before they become aware of it. The findings also add to the idea that the brain evolved to be particularly sensitive to \\"bad guys\\" or cheaters‚Äîfellow humans who undermine social life by deception, theft or other non-cooperative behavior. There are many methods behind self-presentation, including self disclosure (identifying what makes you \\"you\\" to another person), managing appearances (trying to fit in), ingratiation, aligning actions (making one's actions seem appealing or understandable), and alter- casting (imposing identities on other people). Maintaining a version of self- presentation that is generally considered to be attractive can help to increase one's social capital, and this method is commonly implemented by individuals at networking events. These self-presentation methods can also be used on the corporate level as impression management. = Self-presentation = Self-presentation is conveying information about oneself ‚Äì or an image of oneself ‚Äì to others. There are two types and motivations of self-presentation: * presentation meant to match one's own self-image, and * presentation meant to match audience expectations and preferences. Self-presentation is expressive. Individuals construct an image of themselves to claim personal identity, and present themselves in a manner that is consistent with that image. If they feel like it is restricted, they often exhibit reactance or become defiant ‚Äì try to assert their freedom against those who would seek to curtail self-presentation expressiveness. An example of this dynamic is the \\"preacher's daughter\\", whose suppressed personal identity and emotions cause an eventual backlash at her family and community. * Boasting ‚Äì Millon notes that in self-presentation individuals are challenged to balance boasting against discrediting themselves via excessive self-promotion or being caught and being proven wrong. Individuals often have limited ability to perceive how their efforts impact their acceptance,and likeability by others. * Flattery ‚Äì flattery or praise to increase social attractiveness * Intimidation ‚Äì aggressively showing anger to get others to hear and obey one's demands.Felson 1984, p. 187. Self-presentation can be either defensive or assertive strategies (also described as protective versus acquisitive). Whereas defensive strategies include behaviours like avoidance of threatening situations or means of self-handicapping, assertive strategies refer to more active behaviour like the verbal idealisation of the self, the use of status symbols or similar practices. These strategies play important roles in one's maintenance of self-esteem.Leary; Kowalski 1990. One's self-esteem is affected by their evaluation of their own performance and their perception of how others react to their performance. As a result, people actively portray impressions that will elicit self-esteem enhancing reactions from others.Hass 1981 In 2019, as filtered photos are perceived as deceptive by users, PlentyOfFish along with other dating sites have started to ban filtered images. = Social interaction = Goffman argued in his 1967 book, Interaction ritual, that people participate in social interactions by performing a \\"line\\", or \\"pattern of verbal and nonverbal acts\\", which is created and maintained by both the performer and the audience. By enacting a line effectively, the person gains positive social value, which is also called \\"face\\". The success of a social interaction will depend on whether the performer has the ability to maintain face. As a result, a person is required to display a kind of character by becoming \\"someone who can be relied upon to maintain himself as an interactant, poised for communication, and to act so that others do not endanger themselves by presenting themselves as interactants to him\\". Goffman analyses how a human being in \\"ordinary work situations presents himself and his activity to others, the ways in which he guides and controls the impression they form of him, and the kinds of things he may and may not do while sustaining his performance before them‚Äù.Goffman, 1959, p.8 When Goffman turned to focus on people physically presented in a social interaction, the \\"social dimension of impression management certainly extends beyond the specific place and time of engagement in the organization\\". Impression management is \\"a social activity that has individual and community implications\\". We call it \\"pride\\" when a person displays a good showing from duty to himself, while we call it \\"honor\\" when he \\"does so because of duty to wider social units, and receives support from these duties in doing so\\". Another approach to moral standards that Goffman pursues is the notion of \\"rules of conduct\\", which \\"can be partially understood as obligations or moral constraints\\". These rules may be substantive (involving laws, morality, and ethics) or ceremonial (involving etiquette). Rules of conduct play an important role when a relationship \\"is asymmetrical and the expectations of one person toward another are hierarchical.\\" = Dramaturgical analogy = Goffman presented impression management dramaturgically, explaining the motivations behind complex human performances within a social setting based on a play metaphor.Dillard et al., 2000 Goffman's work incorporates aspects of a symbolic interactionist perspective, emphasizing a qualitative analysis of the interactive nature of the communication process. Impression management requires the physical presence of others. Performers who seek certain ends in their interest, must \\"work to adapt their behavior in such a way as to give off the correct impression to a particular audience\\" and \\"implicitly ask that the audience take their performance seriously\\". Goffman proposed that while among other people individual would always strive to control the impression that others form of him or her so that to achieve individual or social goals. The actor, shaped by the environment and target audience, sees interaction as a performance. The objective of the performance is to provide the audience with an impression consistent with the desired goals of the actor.Barnhart, 1994 Thus, impression management is also highly dependent on the situation.Goffman 2006, p. 40. In addition to these goals, individuals differ in responses from the interactive environment, some may be non-responsive to an audience's reactions while others actively respond to audience reactions in order to elicit positive results. These differences in response towards the environment and target audience are called self-monitoring.D√∂ring 1999, p. 262. Another factor in impression management is self-verification, the act of conforming the audience to the person's self-concept. The audience can be real or imaginary. IM style norms, part of the mental programming received through socialization, are so fundamental that we usually do not notice our expectations of them. While an actor (speaker) tries to project a desired image, an audience (listener) might attribute a resonant or discordant image. An example is provided by situations in which embarrassment occurs and threatens the image of a participant.Goffman 1956 Goffman proposes that performers \\"can use dramaturgical discipline as a defense to ensure that the 'show' goes on without interruption.\\" Goffman contends that dramaturgical discipline includes: # coping with dramaturgical contingencies; # demonstrating intellectual and emotional involvement; # remembering one's part and not committing unmeant gestures or faux pas; # not giving away secrets involuntarily; # covering up inappropriate behavior on the part of teammates on the spur of the moment; # offering plausible reasons or deep apologies for disruptive events; # maintaining self-control (for example, speaking briefly and modestly); # suppressing emotions to private problems; and # suppressing spontaneous feelings. = Manipulation and ethics = In business, \\"managing impressions\\" normally \\"involves someone trying to control the image that a significant stakeholder has of them\\". The ethics of impression management has been hotly debated on whether we should see it as an effective self-revelation or as cynical manipulation. Some people insist that impression management can reveal a truer version of the self by adopting the strategy of being transparent, which is a kind of openness. Because transparency \\"can be provided so easily and because it produces information of value to the audience, it changes the nature of impression management from being cynically manipulative to being a kind of useful adaptation\\". Virtue signalling is used within groups to criticize their own members for valuing outward appearance over substantive action (having a real or permanent, rather than apparent or temporary, existence). Psychological manipulation is a type of social influence that aims to change the behavior or perception of others through abusive, deceptive, or underhanded tactics. By advancing the interests of the manipulator, often at another's expense, such methods could be considered exploitative, abusive, devious, and deceptive. The process of manipulation involves bringing an unknowing victim under the domination of the manipulator, often using deception, and using the victim to serve their own purposes. Machiavellianism is a term that some social and personality psychologists use to describe a person's tendency to be unemotional, and therefore able to detach him or herself from conventional morality and hence to deceive and manipulate others. (See also Machiavellianism in the workplace.) Sophism In modern usage sophist and sophistry are redefined and used disparagingly. A sophism is a specious argument for displaying ingenuity in reasoning or for deceiving someone. A sophist is a person who reasons with clever but fallacious, willful and deceptive arguments. Corporate jargon Variously known as corporate speak, corporate lingo, business speak, business jargon, management speak, workplace jargon, or commercialese, is the jargon often used in large corporations, bureaucracies, and similar workplaces.[1][2] The use of corporate jargon, also known as \\"corporatese\\", is criticised for its lack of clarity as well as for its tedium, making meaning and intention opaque and understanding difficult. Rhetorical Device A Rhetorical device, persuasive device, or stylistic device is a technique that an author or speaker uses to convey to the listener or reader a meaning with the goal of persuading them towards considering a topic from a perspective, using language designed to encourage or provoke an emotional display of a given perspective or action. Rhetorical devices evoke an emotional response in the audience through use of language, but that is not their primary purpose. Rather, by doing so, they seek to make a position or argument more compelling than it would otherwise be.[1]  Application  = Face-to-face communication =  Self, social identity and social interaction  The social psychologist, Edward E. Jones, brought the study of impression management to the field of psychology during the 1960s and extended it to include people's attempts to control others' impression of their personal characteristics.Leary; Kowalski 1990 His work sparked an increased attention towards impression management as a fundamental interpersonal process. The concept of self is important to the theory of impression management as the images people have of themselves shape and are shaped by social interactions Our self-concept develops from social experience early in life. Schlenker (1980) further suggests that children anticipate the effect that their behaviours will have on others and how others will evaluate them. They control the impressions they might form on others, and in doing so they control the outcomes they obtain from social interactions. Social identity refers to how people are defined and regarded in social interactions . Individuals use impression management strategies to influence the social identity they project to others. The identity that people establish influences their behaviour in front of others, others' treatment of them and the outcomes they receive. Therefore, in their attempts to influence the impressions others form of themselves, a person plays an important role in affecting his social outcomes. Social interaction is the process by which we act and react to those around us. In a nutshell, social interaction includes those acts people perform toward each other and the responses they give in return. The most basic function of self-presentation is to define the nature of a social situation (Goffman, 1959). Most social interactions are very role governed. Each person has a role to play, and the interaction proceeds smoothly when these roles are enacted effectively. People also strive to create impressions of themselves in the minds of others in order to gain material and social rewards (or avoid material and social punishments).  Cross-cultural communication  Understanding how one's impression management behavior might be interpreted by others can also serve as the basis for smoother interactions and as a means for solving some of the most insidious communication problems among individuals of different racial/ethnic and gender backgrounds. \\"People are sensitive to how they are seen by others and use many forms of impression management to compel others to react to them in the ways they wish\\" (Giddens, 2005, p. 142). An example of this concept is easily illustrated through cultural differences. Different cultures have diverse thoughts and opinions on what is considered beautiful or attractive. For example, Americans tend to find tan skin attractive, but in Indonesian culture, pale skin is more desirable. Another illustration of how people attempt to control how others perceive them is portrayed through the clothing they wear. A person who is in a leadership position strives to be respected and in order to control and maintain the impression. This illustration can also be adapted for a cultural scenario. The clothing people choose to wear says a great deal about the person and the culture they represent. For example, most Americans are not overly concerned with conservative clothing. Most Americans are content with tee shirts, shorts, and showing skin. The exact opposite is true on the other side of the world. \\"Indonesians are both modest and conservative in their attire\\" (Cole, 1997, p. 77). People shape their identity through sharing photos on social media platforms. The ability to modify photos by certain technologies, such as Photoshop, helps achieve their idealized images. Companies use cross-cultural training (CCT) to facilitate effective cross-cultural interaction. CCT can be defined as any procedure used to increase an individual's ability to cope with and work in a foreign environment. Training employees in culturally consistent and specific impression management (IM) techniques provide the avenue for the employee to consciously switch from an automatic, home culture IM mode to an IM mode that is culturally appropriate and acceptable. Second, training in IM reduces the uncertainty of interaction with FNs and increases employee's ability to cope by reducing unexpected events.  Team-working in hospital wards  Impression management theory can also be used in health communication. It can be used to explore how professionals 'present' themselves when interacting on hospital wards and also how they employ front stage and backstage settings in their collaborative work. In the hospital wards, Goffman's front stage and backstage performances are divided into 'planned' and 'ad hoc' rather than 'official' and 'unofficial' interactions. Planned front stage is the structured collaborative activities such as ward rounds and care conferences which took place in the presence of patients and/or carers. Ad hoc front stage is the unstructured or unplanned interprofessional interactions that took place in front of patients/carers or directly involved patients/carers. Planned backstage is the structured MDT meetings in which professionals gathered in a private area of the ward, in the absence of patients, to discuss management plans for patients under their care. Ad hoc backstage is the use of corridors and other ward spaces for quick conversations between professionals in the absence of patients/carers. Offstage is the social activities between and among professional groups/individuals outside of the hospital context. Results show that interprofessional interactions in this setting are often based less on planned front stage activities than on ad hoc backstage activities. While the former may, at times, help create and maintain an appearance of collaborative interprofessional 'teamwork', conveying a sense of professional togetherness in front of patients and their families, they often serve little functional practice. These findings have implications for designing ways to improve interprofessional practice on acute hospital wards where there is no clearly defined interprofessional team, but rather a loose configuration of professionals working together in a collaborative manner around a particular patient. In such settings, interventions that aim to improve both ad hoc as well as planned forms of communication may be more successful than those intended to only improve planned communication. = Computer-mediated communication = The hyperpersonal model of computer- mediated communication (CMC) posits that users exploit the technological aspects of CMC in order to enhance the messages they construct to manage impressions and facilitate desired relationships. The most interesting aspect of the advent of CMC is how it reveals basic elements of interpersonal communication, bringing into focus fundamental processes that occur as people meet and develop relationships relying on typed messages as the primary mechanism of expression. \\"Physical features such as one's appearance and voice provide much of the information on which people base first impressions face- to-face, but such features are often unavailable in CMC. Various perspectives on CMC have suggested that the lack of nonverbal cues diminishes CMC's ability to foster impression formation and management, or argued impressions develop nevertheless, relying on language and content cues. One approach that describes the way that CMC's technical capacities work in concert with users' impression development intentions is the hyperpersonal model of CMC (Walther, 1996). As receivers, CMC users idealize partners based on the circumstances or message elements that suggest minimal similarity or desirability. As senders, CMC users selectively self-present, revealing attitudes and aspects of the self in a controlled and socially desirable fashion. The CMC channel facilitates editing, discretion, and convenience, and the ability to tune out environmental distractions and re-allocate cognitive resources in order to further enhance one's message composition. Finally, CMC may create dynamic feedback loops wherein the exaggerated expectancies are confirmed and reciprocated through mutual interaction via the bias-prone communication processes identified above.\\" According to O'Sullivan's (2000) impression management model of communication channels, individuals will prefer to use mediated channels rather than face-to-face conversation in face-threatening situations. Within his model, this trend is due to the channel features that allow for control over exchanged social information. The present paper extends O'Sullivan's model by explicating information control as a media affordance, arising from channel features and social skills, that enables an individual to regulate and restrict the flow of social information in an interaction, and present a scale to measure it. One dimension of the information control scale, expressive information control, positively predicted channel preference for recalled face-threatening situations. This effect remained after controlling for social anxiousness and power relations in relationships. O'Sullivan's model argues that some communication channels may help individuals manage this struggle and therefore be more preferred as those situations arise. It was based on an assumption that channels with features that allow fewer social cues, such as reduced nonverbal information or slower exchange of messages, invariably afford an individual with an ability to better manage the flow of a complex, ambiguous, or potentially difficult conversations. Individuals manage what information about them is known, or isn't known, to control other's impression of them. Anyone who has given the bathroom a quick cleaning when they anticipate the arrival of their mother-in-law (or date) has managed their impression. For an example from information and communication technology use, inviting someone to view a person's Webpage before a face-to-face meeting may predispose them to view the person a certain way when they actually meet.  Corporate brand  The impression management perspective offers potential insight into how corporate stories could build the corporate brand, by influencing the impressions that stakeholders form of the organization. The link between themes and elements of corporate stories and IM strategies/behaviours indicates that these elements will influence audiences' perceptions of the corporate brand. = Corporate storytelling = Corporate storytelling is suggested to help demonstrate the importance of the corporate brand to internal and external stakeholders, and create a position for the company against competitors, as well as help a firm to bond with its employees (Roper and Fill, 2012). The corporate reputation is defined as a stakeholder's perception of the organization (Brown et al., 2006), and Dowling (2006) suggests that if the story causes stakeholders to perceive the organization as more authentic, distinctive, expert, sincere, powerful, and likeable, then it is likely that this will enhance the overall corporate reputation. Impression management theory is a relevant perspective to explore the use of corporate stories in building the corporate brand. The corporate branding literature notes that interactions with brand communications enable stakeholders to form an impression of the organization (Abratt and Keyn, 2012), and this indicates that IM theory could also therefore bring insight into the use of corporate stories as a form of communication to build the corporate brand. Exploring the IM strategies/behaviors evident in corporate stories can indicate the potential for corporate stories to influence the impressions that audiences form of the corporate brand. = Corporate document = Firms use more subtle forms of influencing outsiders' impressions of firm performance and prospects, namely by manipulating the content and presentation of information in corporate documents with the purpose of \\"distort[ing] readers\\" perceptions of corporate achievements\\" [Godfrey et al., 2003, p. 96]. In the accounting literature this is referred to as impression management. The opportunity for impression management in corporate reports is increasing. Narrative disclosures have become longer and more sophisticated over the last few years. This growing importance of descriptive sections in corporate documents provides firms with the opportunity to overcome information asymmetries by presenting more detailed information and explanation, thereby increasing their decision-usefulness. However, they also offer an opportunity for presenting financial performance and prospects in the best possible light, thus having the opposite effect. In addition to the increased opportunity for opportunistic discretionary disclosure choices, impression management is also facilitated in that corporate narratives are largely unregulated.  Media  The medium of communication influences the actions taken in impression management. Self- efficacy can differ according to the fact whether the trial to convince somebody is made through face-to-face-interaction or by means of an e-mail. Communication via devices like telephone, e-mail or chat is governed by technical restrictions, so that the way people express personal features etc. can be changed. This often shows how far people will go. The affordances of a certain medium also influence the way a user self-presents. Communication via a professional medium such as e-mail would result in professional self- presentation. The individual would use greetings, correct spelling, grammar and capitalization as well as scholastic language. Personal communication mediums such as text-messaging would result in a casual self-presentation where the user shortens words, includes emojis and selfies and uses less academic language. = Profiles on social networking sites = Social media usage among American adults grew from 5% in 2005 to 69% in 2018. Facebook is the most popular social media platform, followed by Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Social networking users will employ protective self- presentations for image management. Users will use subtractive and repudiate strategies to maintain a desired image.Rui, J. and M. A. Stefanone (2013). Strategic Management of Other-Provided Information Online: Personality and Network Variables. System Sciences (HICSS), 2013 46th Hawaii International Conference on. Subtractive strategy is used to untag an undesirable photo on Social Networking Sites. In addition to un-tagging their name, some users will request the photo to be removed entirely. Repudiate strategy is used when a friend posts an undesirable comment about the user. In response to an undesired post, users may add another wall post as an innocence defense. Michael Stefanone states that \\"self-esteem maintenance is an important motivation for strategic self-presentation online.\\" Outside evaluations of their physical appearance, competence, and approval from others determines how social media users respond to pictures and wall posts. Unsuccessful self- presentation online can lead to rejection and criticism from social groups. Social media users are motivated to actively participate in SNS from a desire to manage their online image. Online social media presence often varies with respect to users' age, gender, and body weight. While men and women tend to utilize social media in comparable degrees, both uses and capabilities vary depending on individual preferences as well perceptions of power or dominance. In terms of performance, men tend to display characteristics associated with masculinity as well as more commanding language styles. In much the same way, women tend to present feminine self-depictions and engage in more supportive language. With respect to usage across age variances, many children develop digital and social media literacy skills around 7 or 8 and begin to form online social relationships via virtual environments designed for their age group. The years between thirteen and fifteen demonstrate high social media usage that begins to become more balanced with offline interactions as teens learn to navigate both their online and in-person identities which may often diverge from one another. Studies also suggest that adolescents body weight and their health status might influence their self-presentation practices. For example, research focusing on adolescent patients with obesity indicate that particularly girls with obesity tend to present themselves in such a way that their weight is not in focus, or avoid presenting food items that are associated with overweight/obesity. Social media platforms often provide a great degree of social capital during the college years and later. College students are motivated to use Facebook for impression management, self- expression, entertainment, communication and relationship maintenance. College students sometimes rely on Facebook to build a favorable online identity, which contributes to greater satisfaction with campus life. In building an online persona, college students sometimes engage in identity manipulation, including altering personality and appearance, to increase their self-esteem and appear more attractive to peers. Since risky behavior is frequently deemed attractive by peers, college students often use their social media profiles to gain approval by highlighting instances of risky behavior, like alcohol use and unhealthy eating. Users present risky behavior as signs of achievement, fun, and sociability, participating in a form of impression management aimed at building recognition and acceptance among peers. During middle adulthood, users tend to display greater levels of confidence and mastery in their social media connections while senior users tend to utilize social media for educational and supportive purposes. These myriad factors influence how users will form and communicate their online personas. According to Marwick, social profiles create implications such as \\"context collapse\\" for presenting oneself to the audience. The concept of ‚Äò‚Äòcontext collapse,‚Äô‚Äô suggests that social technologies make it difficult to vary self-presentation based on environment or audience. \\"Large sites such as Facebook and Twitter group friends, family members, coworkers, and acquaintances together under the umbrella term ‚Äò‚Äòfriends‚Äô \\". In a way, this context collapse is aided by a notion of performativity as characterized by Judith Butler.  Political impression management  Impression management is also influential in the political spectrum. \\"Political impression management\\" was coined in 1972 by sociologist Peter M. Hall, who defined the term as the art of marking a candidate look electable and capable (Hall, 1972). This is due in part to the importance of \\"presidential\\" candidates‚Äîappearance, image, and narrative are a key part of a campaign and thus impression management has always been a huge part of winning an election (Katz 2016). Social media has evolved to be part of the political process, thus political impression management is becoming more challenging as the online image of the candidate often now lies in the hands of the voters themselves. The evolution of social media has increased the way in which political campaigns are targeting voters and how influential impression management is when discussing political issues and campaigns. Political campaigns continue to utilize social media as a way to promote their campaigns and share information about who they are to make sure to lead the conversation about their political platform. Research has shown that political campaigns must create clear profiles for each candidate in order to convey the right message to potential voters.  Implications  Impression management can distort the results of empirical research that relies on interviews and surveys, a phenomenon commonly referred to as \\"social desirability bias\\". Impression management theory nevertheless constitutes a field of research on its own.Tedeschi 1984 When it comes to practical questions concerning public relations and the way organizations should handle their public image, the assumptions provided by impression management theory can also provide a framework.Piwinger; Ebert 2001, p. 3. An examination of different impression management strategies acted out by individuals who were facing criminal trials where the trial outcomes could range from a death sentence, life in prison or acquittal has been reported in the forensic literature.Perri, Frank S. and Lichtenwald, Terrance G. (2010). \\"The Last Frontier: Myths & The Female Psychopathic Killer\\". Forensic Examiner, Summer 2010, 50-67. The Perri and Lichtenwald article examined female psychopathic killers, whom as a group were highly motivated to manage the impression that attorneys, judges, mental health professions and ultimately, a jury had of the murderers and the murder they committed. It provides legal case illustrations of the murderers combining and/or switching from one impression management strategy such as ingratiation or supplication to another as they worked towards their goal of diminishing or eliminating any accountability for the murders they committed. Since the 1990s, researchers in the area of sport and exercise psychology have studied self-presentation. Concern about how one is perceived has been found to be relevant to the study of athletic performance. For example, anxiety may be produced when an athlete is in the presence of spectators. Self- presentational concerns have also been found to be relevant to exercise. For example, the concerns may elicit motivation to exercise.Martin Ginis, K.A., Lindwall, M., & Prapavessis, H. (2007). Who cares what other people think? Self-presentation in exercise and sport. In R. Eklund & G. Tenenbaum (Eds.), Handbook of Sport Psychology (pp. 136‚Äì153). Hoboken, NJ: John Wiles & Sons. More recent research investigating the effects of impression management on social behaviour showed that social behaviours (e.g. eating) can serve to convey a desired impression to others and enhance one's self-image. Research on eating has shown that people tend to eat less when they believe that they are being observed by others.Herman; Roth; Polivy 2003  See also  * Calculating Visions: Kennedy, Johnson, and Civil Rights (book) * Character mask * Charm offensive * Dramaturgy (sociology) * First impression (psychology) * Ingratiation * Online identity management * On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog * Personal branding * Register (sociolinguistics) * Reputation capital * Reputation management * Self-monitoring theory * Self- verification theory * Signalling (economics) * Spin (public relations) * Superficial charm * Stigma management  Footnotes   References  Barnhart, Adam (1994), Erving Goffman: The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life  Goffman, Erving (2006), Wir alle spielen Theater: Die Selbstdarstellung im Alltag, Piper, Munich. * Dillard, Courtney et al.

Is a widespread and frequently common resident breeder in much of Sub-Saharan and equatorial Africa. It is a species associated with forest and bush which nests in a tree hole, often in an oil palm, laying two to four eggs. It is a common bird with a very wide range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Taxonomy The African grey woodpecker was described by the German zoologist Philipp Ludwig Statius M√ºller in 1776 from a specimen collected in Senegal. He coined the binomial name Picus goertae. The specific epithet is from the French polymath Comte de Buffon who noted that \\"Go√´rtan\\" was the name used for the species in Senegal. The species was also illustrated in a set of plates that accompanied Brisson's work. The African grey woodpecker is now placed in the genus Dendropicos that was introduced by the French ornithologist Alfred Malherbe in 1849. Five subspecies are recognised: * D. g. koenigi (Neumann, 1903) ‚Äì Mali to west Sudan * D. g. abessinicus (Reichenow, 1900) ‚Äì east Sudan to west Ethiopia * D. g. goertae (M√ºller, PLS, 1776) ‚Äì Senegal and Gambia to Mali. * D. g. centralis (Reichenow, 1900) ‚Äì Sierra Leone to Nigeria, south Sudan, west Kenya and northwest Tanzania * D. g. meridionalis Louette & Prigogine, 1982 ‚Äì south Gabon and northwest Angola to south central Democratic Republic of the Congo The African grey woodpecker and the eastern grey woodpecker (Picidae spodocephalus) were formerly treated as conspecific. Description Like other woodpeckers, this species has a straight pointed bill, a stiff tail to provide support against tree trunks, and zygodactyl or ‚Äúyoked\\" feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backward. The long tongue can be darted forward to capture insects. This bird is in length. It is a typical woodpecker shape, and has unmarked green upperparts and a pale grey head and underparts. The rump is red, and there is a small red belly patch. The short tail is blackish. The adult male grey woodpecker has a red crown. Females have a plain grey head, lacking the red crown. Young birds are like the female, but the reds are paler, and there may be some flank barring. Distribution and habitat The African grey woodpecker is native to tropical parts of western and central Africa. Its range includes Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea- Bissau, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo and Uganda. Its typical habitat includes woodland, savannah with isolated trees, copses of larger trees, riverside forest and pasture. Behaviour and ecology Like other woodpeckers, this species is an insectivore. It is frequently seen, and regularly taps or drums. The call is a loud and fast peet-peet-peet-peet.

The new founded camp was located on the land of the depopulated Palestinian village of Mughr al-Khayt, 1 km southeast of the village site.Khalidi, 1992, p479 The two adjacent transition camps were initially named \\"Hatzor A\\" and \\"Hatzor B\\", named for the nearby biblical site of Tel Hatzor, and housed immigrants and refugees, primarily Jews from North Africa. In 1956, Hatzor HaGlilit was given the status of local council. By 1958, Hatzor HaGlilit had a population of 4,000 and received development town status. Over time, the city preserved its Jewish religious-traditional demographic status and later a Jewish ultra- orthodox neighbourhood was also established, housing Gur Hassids. In December 2011, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics, the town was populated by 8,705 residents, with 0.0% population growth. Landmarks One of the town's most well-known landmarks is the tomb of Honi the Circle-Maker, adjoining the burial sites of two of his grandsons, Abba Hilkiyah and Hanan HaNihba. According to Jewish legend, Honi HaM'agel had the power to bring rain through his prayers. The presence of this shrine attracted a large Gerrer hassid population to the town.

The monohydrate (x =1), known as baryta or baryta-water, is one of the principal compounds of barium. This white granular monohydrate is the usual commercial form. Preparation and structure Barium hydroxide can be prepared by dissolving barium oxide (BaO) in water: :BaO + 9 H2O ‚Üí Ba(OH)2¬∑8H2O It crystallises as the octahydrate, which converts to the monohydrate upon heating in air. At 100 ¬∞C in a vacuum, the monohydrate will yield BaO and water.(1960). Gmelins Handbuch der anorganischen Chemie (8. Aufl.), Weinheim: Verlag Chemie, p. 289. The monohydrate adopts a layered structure (see picture above). The Ba2+ centers adopt a square anti-prismatic geometry. Each Ba2+ center is bound by two water ligands and six hydroxide ligands, which are respectively doubly and triply bridging to neighboring Ba2+ centre sites.Kuske, P.; Engelen, B.; Henning, J.; Lutz, H.D.; Fuess, H.; Gregson, D. \\"Neutron diffraction study of Sr(OH)2(H2O) and beta-Ba(OH)2*(H2O)\\" Zeitschrift f√ºr Kristallographie (1979-2010) 1988, vol. 183, p319-p325.

This application exploits the very low solubility of barium sulfate. This industrial application is also applied to laboratory uses. =Laboratory uses= Barium hydroxide is used in analytical chemistry for the titration of weak acids, particularly organic acids. Its clear aqueous solution is guaranteed to be free of carbonate, unlike those of sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, as barium carbonate is insoluble in water. This allows the use of indicators such as phenolphthalein or thymolphthalein (with alkaline colour changes) without the risk of titration errors due to the presence of carbonate ions, which are much less basic. Barium hydroxide is occasionally used in organic synthesis as a strong base, for example for the hydrolysis of estersMeyer, K.; Bloch, H. S. (1945). \\"Naphthoresorcinol\\". Org. Synth. 25: 73; Coll.

Its aqueous solution, being highly alkaline, undergoes neutralization reactions with acids. Thus, it forms barium sulfate and barium phosphate with sulfuric and phosphoric acids, respectively. Reaction with hydrogen sulfide produces barium sulfide. Precipitation of many insoluble, or less soluble barium salts, may result from double replacement reaction when a barium hydroxide aqueous solution is mixed with many solutions of other metal salts.Pradyot Patnaik.

Hydrobromic acid has a pKa of ‚àí9, making it a stronger acid than hydrochloric acid, but not as strong as hydroiodic acid. Hydrobromic acid is one of the strongest mineral acids known. Uses Hydrobromic acid is mainly used for the production of inorganic bromides, especially the bromides of zinc, calcium, and sodium. It is a useful reagent for generating organobromine compounds. Certain ethers are cleaved with HBr. It also catalyzes alkylation reactions and the extraction of certain ores. Industrially significant organic compounds prepared from hydrobromic acid include allyl bromide, tetrabromobis(phenol), and bromoacetic acid. HBr almost uniquely participates in antiMarkovnikov hydrohalogenation of alkenes. The resulting 1-bromoalkanes are versatile alkylating agents, giving rise to fatty amines and quaternary ammonium salts.

Individuals who are more restricted sociosexually are less willing to engage in casual sex; they prefer greater love, commitment and emotional closeness before having sex with romantic partners. Individuals who are more unrestricted sociosexually are more willing to have casual sex and are more comfortable engaging in sex without love, commitment or closeness. Measurement The revised Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI-R) was designed to measure sociosexuality, with high SOI scores corresponding to an unrestricted orientation and low SOI scores denoting a more restricted orientation. The SOI-R also allows for the separate assessment of three facets of sociosexuality: behavior, attitude and desire. Gender differences and sexual orientation Men tend to have higher SOI scores and be more unrestricted than women across a variety of cultures. However, there is more variability in scores within each gender than between men and women, indicating that although the average man is less restricted than the average woman, individuals may vary in sociosexuality regardless of gender. Bisexual women are significantly less restricted in their sociosexual attitudes than both lesbian and heterosexual women. Bisexual women are also the most unrestricted in sociosexual behavior, followed by lesbians and then, heterosexual women. Gay and bisexual men are similar to heterosexual men in sociosexual attitudes, in that they express relatively unrestricted attitudes relative to women. However, gay men are the most unrestricted in sociosexual behavior, followed by bisexual men and then, heterosexual men. This may be because gay men have more potential mating partners who prefer short-term, casual sexual encounters. Unrestricted sociosexuality is associated with early life experiences with sex, more frequent sexual activity and a greater number of lifetime sex partners. Unrestricted men tend to have greater rape myth acceptance, past sexual aggression and more conservative attitudes about women than restricted men. Unrestricted women tend to have more sexual fantasies involving having power or control over another person and lower levels of sexual conservatism than restricted women. Individual differences Individuals who are sociosexually unrestricted tend to score higher on openness to experience, and be more extraverted, less agreeable, lower on honesty-humility, more erotophilic, more impulsive, more likely to take risks, more likely to have an avoidant attachment style, less likely to have a secure attachment style, and score higher on the Dark Triad traits (i.e. narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy). Higher masculinity and eveningness in women is related to unrestricted sociosexuality. High self-monitoring is also associated with unrestricted sociosexuality, regardless of gender or sexual orientation. Individuals with an intrinsic religious orientation (i.e., religion as an end) tend to be sociosexually restricted, while those with an extrinsic religious orientation (i.e., religion as a means to achieve non- religious goals) tend to be unrestricted. Mating tendencies =Motives= Unrestricted women are more motivated to engage in casual sex than restricted women as they perceive more benefits associated with short-term mating. These include sexual benefits (e.g., experiencing the novelty of a new partner), resource benefits (e.g., receiving expensive gifts) and the improvement of their seduction skills. Sociosexuality is not associated with short-term benefits for men. When viewing attractive female models, unrestricted men are more interested in the models‚Äô physical attractiveness, while restricted men show more interest in the social traits presumably possessed by attractive females. Unrestricted women report more interest in attractive male models‚Äô popularity and are less interested in their willingness to commit, compared to restricted women. =Mate preferences= Men and women with an unrestricted sociosexual orientation view short-term mates with greater sexual experience as more desirable, whereas restricted women perceive partners‚Äô sexual inexperience as desirable. Unrestricted individuals place more importance on partners‚Äô physical attractiveness and sex appeal, while restricted individuals place more weight on characteristics indicative of good personal and parenting qualities (e.g., kind, responsible, faithful). Judgement of sexual attractiveness is more variable in unrestricted men than in restricted males. Individuals are able to accurately assess the sociosexuality of computer- generated and real faces, with unrestricted sociosexuality being associated with greater attractiveness in female faces and greater masculinity in male faces. Women tend to prefer male faces associated with restricted sociosexuality, while men prefer unrestricted female faces, both for short- term and long-term partners. =Relationship interactions= Unrestricted women report engaging in more social interactions with men on a daily basis than restricted women. However, unrestricted individuals rate their interactions with their best friends (non-romantic) as lower in quality (i.e., as less pleasant and satisfying) than restricted individuals. Unrestricted individuals are also more likely to view cheating or infidelity as acceptable under certain conditions (e.g., when involved in a bad relationship), and report engaging in more cheating than restricted individuals. The relationship between sociosexual orientation and infidelity is mediated by commitment, meaning unrestricted individuals may cheat because they are less committed to their partner than restricted individuals. Hormones Individuals who are partnered typically have lower testosterone levels than individuals who are single. However, this was found to apply solely to individuals who have a restricted sociosexuality. Partnered, unrestricted men and women‚Äôs testosterone levels are more similar to the levels of single men and women. Culture In regions that suffer from a high prevalence of infectious diseases, both men and women report lower levels of sociosexuality, as the costs of an incautious lifestyle (i.e., being unrestricted) may outweigh the benefits. Implications Possessing an unrestricted sociosexuality seems to increase the likelihood of having a son by 12-19% in American samples. This may be explained by the generalized Trivers-Willard hypothesis, which states that parents who possess any heritable trait that increases males‚Äô reproductive success above females‚Äô will have more sons, and will have more daughters if they possess traits that increase females‚Äô reproductive success above males‚Äô. Since unrestricted sociosexuality increases the reproductive fitness of sons more than daughters (as males have the potential to have more offspring through casual sex), unrestricted parents have a higher-than- expected offspring sex ratio (more sons). Relevant theories =Parental investment theory= According to the parental investment theory, the gender that invests more in offspring tends to be more discriminating and more sociosexually restricted (usually women, due to pregnancy, childbirth and lactation).Trivers, R. (1972). Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. Campbell (Eds.), Sexual selection and the descent of man, 1871-1971. Chicago: Aldine. In a year, a woman can give birth once (except in the case of a multiple pregnancy), regardless of the number of partners she has had, whereas a man can potentially have more children than the number of women with whom he has slept due to multiple births. Thus, women should be more selective and restricted in order to have children with partners possessing good genes and resources, who can provide for potential offspring. Men, however, may increase their reproductive fitness by being unrestricted and having many children with many women. Thus, since men do not need to invest as much physically (no pregnancy), they tend to have a more unrestricted sociosexuality. =Sex ratio theory= Operational sex ratio is the number of sexually competing males versus the number of sexually competing females in the local mating pool. High sex ratios indicate that there are more men than women available, while low sex ratios imply more women than men are sexually available. High sex ratios (more men) are associated with lower SOI scores (more restricted sociosexual orientation), as men must satisfy women‚Äôs preference for long-term monogamous relationships if they are to effectively compete for the limited number of women. Low sex ratios (more women) are correlated with more unrestricted sociosexuality, as men can afford to demand more casual sex if they are relatively scarce and in demand. =Strategic pluralism theory= Strategic pluralism suggests that women evolved to evaluate men on two dimensions: their potential to be a good provider for offspring and their degree of genetic quality. The local environment should have influenced which mate characteristics were preferred by women. In demanding environments where biparental care was critical to infant survival, women should have valued good parenting qualities more, leading men to adopt a more restricted sociosexuality and invest more in their offspring to help ensure their children survive. In disease-prevalent environments, good genes that would help offspring resist pathogens should have been prioritized by women, leading healthy men to be more sociosexually unrestricted in order to pass on their genes to many offspring. =Social structural theory= According to social structural theory, the division of labor and social expectations lead to gender differences in sociosexuality. In cultures with more traditional gender roles (where women have less freedom than men), gender differences in sociosexuality are larger. In these societies, where women have less access to power and money than men, it is expected that women should be more sexually restricted and only have sexual relations with men in the context of a committed relationship, whereas men may be sexually unrestricted if they wish. In more egalitarian societies, where men and women have equal access to power and money, the gender difference in sociosexuality is less pronounced, as individuals may take on the social role of the other gender.

Parallels are often drawn between the flood waters of these myths and the primaeval waters which appear in certain creation myths, as the flood waters are described as a measure for the cleansing of humanity, in preparation for rebirth. Most flood myths also contain a culture hero, who \\"represents the human craving for life\\". The flood-myth motif occurs in many cultures as seen in: the Mesopotamian flood stories, Pralaya in Hinduism, the Gun-Yu in Chinese mythology, Deucalion and Pyrrha in Greek mythology, the Genesis flood narrative, Bergelmir in Norse mythology, the arrival of the first inhabitants of Ireland with Cessair in Irish mythology, the lore of the K'iche' and Maya peoples in Mesoamerica, the Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwa tribe of Native Americans in North America, the Muisca and Ca√±ari Confederation in South America, Africa, and some Aboriginal tribes in Australia. Tablet XI of the Epic of Gilgamesh Mythologies Although the story of Noah in the Hebrew Bible is the most well-known flood myth in Western culture, it shows the influence of earlier narratives from Mesopotamia. The nineteenth-century Assyriologist George Smith first translated a Babylonian account of a great flood, and further discoveries produced several versions of the Mesopotamian flood myth, with the account closest to that in Genesis being found in a 700 BC Babylonian copy of the Epic of Gilgamesh. Many scholars believe that this was copied from the Akkadian Atra-Hasis, which dates to the 18th century BC. In the Gilgamesh flood myth, the highest god Enlil decides to destroy the world with a flood because humans have become too noisy. The god Ea, who created humans out of clay and divine blood, secretly warns the hero Utnapishtim of the impending flood and gives him detailed instructions for building a boat so that life may survive.Finkel, Irving. The Ark Before Noah. Doubleday, 2014.Pritchard, James B.

Robson, E. Zolyomi, G. The Literature of Ancient Sumer, Oxford University Press, 2004. George Smith, who discovered and translated the Epic of Gilgamesh In the Book of Genesis (c. 6th century BC) the god Yahweh, who created man out of the dust of the ground, decides to flood the earth because of the sinful state of mankind. It is also Yahweh who then gives the protagonist Noah instructions to build an ark in order to preserve human and animal life. When the ark is completed, Noah, his family, and representatives of all the animals of the earth are called upon to enter the ark. When the destructive flood begins, all life outside of the ark perishes. After the waters recede, all those aboard the ark disembark and have Yahweh's promise that he will never judge the earth with a flood again. He causes a rainbow to form as the sign of this promise. In Hindu mythology, texts such as the Satapatha Brahmana (dated to around the 6th century BC)\\"Early Indian history: Linguistic and textual parametres.\\" in The Indo-Aryans of Ancient South Asia, edited by G. Erdosy (1995), p. 136 and the Puranas contain the story of a great flood, \\"Pralaya\\",Startling Similarity between Hindu Flood Legend of Manu and the Biblical Account of Noah. wherein the Matsya Avatar of the Vishnu warns the first man, Manu, of the impending flood, and also advises him to build a giant boat.Matsya Britannica.com In Zoroastrian Mazdaism, Ahriman tries to destroy the world with a drought, which Mithra ends by shooting an arrow into a rock, from which a flood springs; one man survives in an ark with his cattle. In Plato's Timaeus, written c. 360 BC, Timaeus describes a flood myth similar to the earlier versions. In it, the Bronze race of humans angers the high god Zeus with their constant warring. Zeus decides to punish humanity with a flood. The Titan Prometheus, who had created humans from clay, tells the secret plan to Deucalion, advising him to build an ark in order to be saved. After nine nights and days, the water starts receding and the ark lands on a mountain.Plato's Timaeus. Greek text: http://www.24grammata.com/wp- content/uploads/2011/01/Platon-Timaios.pdf  Historicity  A worldwide deluge, such as the one described in Genesis, is incompatible with modern scientific understanding of natural history, especially geology and paleontology. In an early example of ichnology, Leonardo da Vinci explains in his notebooks that the fossils of marine shells would have been scattered in such a deluge, and not gathered in groups, which were evidently left at various times on mountains in Lombardy; he also doubts that so much water could have evaporated away from the Earth. Excavations in Iraq have revealed evidence of localized flooding at Shuruppak (modern Tell Fara, Iraq) and various other Sumerian cities. A layer of riverine sediments, radiocarbon dated to about 2900 BC, interrupts the continuity of settlement, extending as far north as the city of Kish, which took over hegemony after the flood. Polychrome pottery from the Jemdet Nasr period (3000‚Äì2900 BC) was discovered immediately below the Shuruppak flood stratum. Other sites, such as Ur, Kish, Uruk, Lagash, and Ninevah, all present evidence of flooding. However, this evidence comes from different time periods.: (Parrot, 1955) The Shuruppak flood seems to have been a localised event caused through the damming of the Karun River through the spread of dunes, flooding into the Tigris, and simultaneous heavy rainfall in the Nineveh region, spilling across into the Euphrates. In Israel, there is no such evidence of a widespread flood. Given the similarities in the Mesopotamian flood story and the Biblical account, it would seem that they have a common origin in the memories of the Shuruppak account.Hendel, Ronald S.(1987), \\"Of Demigods and the Deluge: towards an interpretation of Genesis 6:1-4\\" (Journal of Biblical Literature, Vol 186 No 1) The Sumerian King List reads: Earth's sea level rose dramatically in the millennia after the Last Glacial Maximum. Floods in the wake of the last glacial period may have inspired myths that survive to this day. It has been postulated that in North America, flood myths may be based on a sudden rise in sea levels caused by the rapid draining of prehistoric Lake Agassiz at the end of the last Ice Age, about 8,400 years ago.Early Days Among the Cheyanne & Arapahoe Indians by John H. Seger, p. 135 The geography of the Mesopotamian area was considerably changed by the filling of the Persian Gulf after sea waters rose following the last glacial period. Global sea levels were about lower around 18,000 BP and rose until 8,000 BP when they reached current levels, which are now an average above the floor of the Gulf, which was a huge () low-lying and fertile region in Mesopotamia, in which human habitation is thought to have been strong around the Gulf Oasis for 100,000 years. A sudden increase in settlements above the present water level is recorded at around 7,500 BP. Adrienne Mayor promoted the hypothesis that global flood stories were inspired by ancient observations of seashells and fish fossils in inland and mountain areas. The ancient Greeks, Egyptians, and Romans all documented the discovery of such remains in these locations; the Greeks hypothesized that Earth had been covered by water on several occasions, citing the seashells and fish fossils found on mountain tops as evidence of this history. Another hypothesis is that a meteor or comet crashed into the Indian Ocean around 3000‚Äì2800 BC, created the undersea Burckle Crater, and generated a giant tsunami that flooded coastal lands. Some of the largest tsunamis in history, resulting from the Chicxulub impact, 66 million years ago, were thought to have affected roughly the entire Americas (or nearly all of the Western Hemisphere). In the late 17th century, there were speculations accounting for the Genesis flood by natural causes. Thomas Burnet‚Äôs Telluris Theoria Sacra (Sacred Theory of the Earth) had water rising from the hollow earth. William Whiston's A New Theory of the Earth postulated that major changes in the earth‚Äôs history could be attributed to the action of comets. Speculation regarding the Deucalion myth has also been introduced, whereby a large tsunami in the Mediterranean Sea, caused by the Thera eruption (with an approximate geological date of 1630‚Äì1600 BC), is the myth's historical basis. Although the tsunami hit the South Aegean Sea and Crete, it did not affect cities in the mainland of Greece, such as Mycenae, Athens, and Thebes, which continued to prosper, indicating that it had a local rather than a regionwide effect.Castleden, Rodney (2001) \\"Atlantis Destroyed\\" (Routledge). A controversial hypothesis of long-term flooding is the Black Sea deluge hypothesis, which argues for a catastrophic deluge about 5600 BC from the Mediterranean Sea into the Black Sea. This has been the subject of considerable discussion.\\"'Noah's Flood' Not Rooted in Reality, After All?\\" National Geographic News, February 6, 2009. The Younger Dryas impact hypothesis is another proposed natural explanation for flood myths, but this idea is similarly controversial.

Within the monocots Pandanales are grouped in the lilioid monocots where they are in a sister group relationship with the Dioscoreales. Historically the order has consisted of a number of different families in different systems but modern classification of the order is based primarily on molecular phylogenetics despite diverse morphology which previously placed many of the families in other groupings based on apparent similarity. Members of the order have a subtropical distribution and includes trees, shrubs, and vines as well as herbaceous plants. The order consists of 5 families, 36 genera and about 1,610 species. Description  Talbotia elegans Pandanales are highly diverse including large arboraceous plants of tropical rainforests and coastal areas, climbing vines and lianas, as well as very small achlorophyllous (mycoheterotrophic) and saprophytic herbaceous forest floor species. This has made it difficult to reliably define synapomorphies, but the loss of trimery distinguishes many of them from other lilioid monocots. The Pandanales order is distinctive with its highly variable and hardly definable floral morphology, especially the number of stamens and their structure as well as many other characteristics. In some of the members, different interpretations exist regarding the composition and organization of the reproductive structures. The order includes plants with traits that seem atypical when compared to other groups of monocots. A good example is the female reproductive organ and its position relative to other parts of the flower. Some of the species included in the families Pandanaceae and Stemonaceae show flowers formed from only one carpel, while in the Triuridaceae, a family that lacks chlorophyll, the carpels are free from each other. In fact, the Triuridaceae possess the least \\"typical\\" flower morphology in the order. Taxonomy  =History = The components of the order sensu APG have been difficult to place consistently, and historically have been associated with a number of other groupings. The Bentham & Hooker system (1883) had a similar order under the name Nudifloreae, incorporating: * Pandaneae * Cyclanthaceae * Typhaceae * Aroideae * Lemnaceae The Wettstein system (1935) placed the order in class Monocotyledones and used a different circumscription, incorporating: * Pandanaceae * Sparganiaceae * Typhaceae The Cronquist system (1981) placed the order in subclass Arecidae in class Liliopsida [=monocotyledons] with only one family: * Pandanaceae In the classification system of Dahlgren the Pandanales were in the superorder Pandaniflorae (also called Pandananae) with the single family Pandanaceae. = Angiosperm Phylogeny Group = The APG III system (2009) places the Pandanales in the monocots. Both the APG III and APG II systems include five families in this order. Since the morphology of the order varies on such scale, its classification and phylogeny are based on genetic analyses. Inside the order, some doubt remains about the position of the entirely mycoheterotrophic family Triuridaceae, since it is the only one on which genetic analyses have not yet been applied. With high probability, the family may be sister to the Velloziaceae, but similarities with the family Zingiberaceae (which is a part of a whole different order ‚Äì Zingiberales) do not exclude the chance for a different phylogeny. The family Velloziaceae on its own is placed at the base of the tree. The Pandanaceae and Cyclanthaceae are sister groups, and they form a clade which on its own is sister to the Stemonaceae (a family composed of two more clades). = Evolution = The order Dioscoreales holds sister relationship with Pandanales by diverging from them around 121 million years ago in the mid-Cretaceous. The formation of the crown groups took place with a difference of 2 million years between the orders - 116 Mya for the Dioscoreales and 114 Mya for the Pandanales. However, the stem group of the Pandanales is much older and goes back to 130 Mya in the early Cretaceous.Merckx. Diversification of myco-heterotrophic angiosperms: Evidence from Burmanniaceae. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008 = Phylogeny = = Subdivision = The composition of the order in APG III and APG II were slightly from that in the 1998 APG system, which used the circumscription * Cyclanthaceae * Pandanaceae * Stemonaceae * Velloziaceae APG III includes the following families; * Cyclanthaceae * Pandanaceae * Stemonaceae * Triuridaceae * Velloziaceae Distribution The order contains members mainly distributed in all the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, both New and Old World (including Africa, South America, Australia and Asia). Also, a species is present in China.  Ecology Freycinetia arborea - member of the Pandanaceae The species are members of various ecological groups, including tropical shrubs, lianas and trees, xerophytic plants, mycoheterotrophs, as well as different herbaceous representatives.  Uses  Several species in this order produce strap-like leaves used for basketry and mats; Pandanus (Pandanaceae) is used across Oceania for thatch, basketry, and to make cloth, and Carludovica palmata (Cyclanthaceae) leaves are made into Panama hats. Other members as Stemona are present in traditional Chinese medicine and possess medical properties. Some species are used as insecticides. Some species of Pandanus are used as ornamentals. Pandanus amaryllifolius is a common food flavoring in Southeast Asia and karuka (Pandanus julianettii) is a staple food in New Guinea.  References   Bibliography   External links  * Merckx V.

Crullers have been described as resembling \\"a small, braided torpedo\\". Some other cruller styles are made of a denser dough somewhat like that of a cake doughnut formed in a small loaf or stick shape, but not always twisted. Crullers may be topped with plain powdered sugar; powdered sugar mixed with cinnamon; or icing. A French cruller is a fluted, ring-shaped doughnut made from choux pastry with a light airy texture. The German spritzkuchen is very similar. History A handmade Danish klejner, a traditional cruller shape, rectangular with two twisted sides The name comes from early 19th century Dutch , from 'to curl'. In northern Germany they are known as (deer horns). They are traditionally baked on New Year's Eve as a family project with the kids doing the labor-intensive shaping and the grown ups handling the deep frying. In Danish they are known as klejner and in Swedish as klen√§ter, both names deriving from Low German. In Scandinavia crullers are common at Christmas. In the US various shapes of pastries are known as crullers. Some forms of those crullers are what is traditionally eaten in Germany and some other European countries on Shrove Tuesday, to use up fat before Lent. The term \\"Chinese cruller\\" is occasionally applied to the youtiao (), a similar- looking fried dough food eaten in East and Southeast Asia. The term cruller is also associated with the mahua ().\\"crullers\\". Youdao dictionary. Accessed August 1, 2013. Mahua is a type of twisted fried dough much denser and sweeter than youtiao. The \\"Aberdeen crulla\\" is a traditional Scottish pastry made in the same way as the rectangular, plaited cruller of New England.F. Marian McNiell, \\"The Scots Kitchen\\", It is first attested in Edinburgh in 1829 and is thought to copied from the 'cruller' of the United States according to the Scottish National Dictionary (1931‚Äì1976). Distinct from this, the \\"yum-yum\\" is a commonly available treat in Scotland, which resembles a straightened French cruller coated in thin glac√© icing. In 1909 a US author published her belief that crullers were invented in the New World in 1617 by Sebastian Croll, due to the perceived similarity of the names according to her. Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz sings \\"Over the Rainbow\\" early in the movie holding what's left of a cruller Aunt Em had offered to her after giving them to Hunk, Hickory, and Zeke, her \\"three shiftless farmhands\\". The twisted shape of the cruller might have been a metaphor for tornadoes as the same scene references other metaphors which influenced Dorothy's subsequent dream. Availability A round \\"French cruller\\" is made with an extruding nozzle Crullers are most commonly found in Canada, New England, the Mid-Atlantic and North Central states of the United States, but are also common in California. The German origin is probably why traditional crullers can be found more easily in the Midwest, where many German immigrants settled. Some family-owned bakeries still call them \\"krullers.\\" In 2003, the Dunkin' Donuts chain of doughnut shops stopped carrying traditional crullers, claiming that the hand-shaped rectangular treats were too labor-intensive, and couldn't be simulated with new machines for mixing doughnut batter. The company still sells \\"French crullers\\"Joseph P. Kahn, \\"With Progress, a Cruel Twist\\", Boston Globe, 25 October 2003. which can be formed by a kind of extruding nozzle. Tim Hortons,Tim Hortons Snacks & Baked Goods and Honey Dew Donuts still sell the Cruller doughnut. Krispy Kreme sell a similar doughnut the company refers to as a cruller, but in reality it is just a molded/formed cake (or Old Fashioned) doughnut. In place of the traditional cruller, Dunkin' Donuts now sells several variations of a substitute product it calls a \\"cake stick\\" which is a simplified, machine-made rectangular version of the elaborately twisted, hand-made variety. In the southeastern U.S., French crullers are a fresh-baked everyday bakery item at Publix grocery stores. In 1973, the French cruller became available in Mister Donut stores in Japan.

Cyprian Konstanty Norwid (; 24 September 1821 - 23 May 1883), was a nationally esteemed Polish poet, dramatist, painter, and sculptor. He was born in the Masovian village of Laskowo-G≈Çuchy near Warsaw. One of his maternal ancestors was the Polish King John III Sobieski.Kr√≥l, Marcin. Konserwaty≈õci a niepodleg≈Ço≈õƒá. Warszawa 1985, p. 160. Norwid is regarded as one of the second generation of romantics. He wrote many well- known poems including Fortepian Szopena (\\"Chopin's Piano\\"), Moja piosnka [II] (\\"My Song [II]\\") and Bema pamiƒôci ≈ºa≈Çobny-rapsod (A Funeral Rhapsody in Memory of General Bem). Norwid led a tragic and often poverty-stricken life (once he had to live in a cemetery crypt). He experienced increasing health problems, unrequited love, harsh critical reviews, and increasing social isolation. He lived abroad most of his life, especially in London and, in Paris where he died. Norwid's original and non-conformist style was not appreciated in his lifetime and partially due to this fact, he was excluded from high society. His work was only rediscovered and appreciated by the Young Poland art movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. He is now considered one of the four most important Polish Romantic poets. Other literary historians, however, consider this an oversimplification, and regard his style to be more characteristic of classicism and parnassianism. Life South annex of Czapski Palace (Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie 5, Warsaw), where Chopin lived to 1830. In 1837‚Äì39 Norwid studied painting here. Later he penned \\"Chopin's Piano\\", about Russian troops' 1863 defenestration of the piano. Norwid is a Polish form of the Lithuanian two-syllable archaic (sur)name Norvydas ‚Äî from noras a wish, a desire, a goal and (i≈°)vysti to see, literally one, who has a desire.According to the dictionary of Lithuanian surnames, surname Norvydas is widespread in Samogitia.According to the statistics, in 1999-2018 there were 43 newborn boys, whose parents gave them a Lithuanian name - Norvydas Born into a Polish‚ÄìLithuanian noble family bearing the Top√≥r coat of arms, Cyprian Norwid and his brother Ludwik were orphaned early. For most of their childhood, they were educated at Warsaw schools. In 1830 Norwid interrupted his schooling (not having completed the fifth grade) and entered a private school of painting. His incomplete formal education forced him to become an autodidact. His first foray into the literary sphere occurred in the periodical Pi≈õmiennictwo Krajowe, which published his first poem, \\"M√≥j ostatni sonet\\" (\\"My Last Sonnet\\"), in issue 8, 1840. = Europe = Manuscript of \\"Chopin's Piano\\" In 1842 Norwid went to Dresden, ostensibly to gain instruction in sculpture. He later also visited Venice and Florence. After he settled in Rome in 1844, his fianc√©e Kamila broke off their engagement. Later he met Maria Kalergis, n√©e Nesselrode, who became his \\"lost love\\", even as his health deteriorated. The poet then travelled to Berlin, where he participated in university lectures and meetings with local Polonia. It was a time when Norwid made many new social, artistic and political contacts. After being arrested and forced to leave Prussia in 1846, Norwid went to Brussels. During the European Revolutions of 1848, he stayed in Rome, where he met fellow Polish intellectuals Adam Mickiewicz and Zygmunt Krasi≈Ñski. During 1849‚Äì1852, Norwid lived in Paris, where he met fellow Poles Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and Juliusz S≈Çowacki, as well as Russians Ivan Turgenev and Alexander Herzen. Financial hardship, unrequited love, political misunderstandings, and a negative critical reception of his works put Norwid in a dire situation. He lived in poverty and suffered from progressive blindness and deafness, but still managed to publish his work in the Parisian publication Goniec polski. =U.S.A.= Norwid decided to emigrate to the United States of America on 29 September 1852 under the protection of Wladyslaw Zamoyski. He arrived aboard the Margaret Evans in New York City on 12 February 1853, and during the spring, obtained a well-paying job at a graphics firm. By autumn, he had learned about the outbreak of the Crimean War. This made him consider a return to Europe, and he wrote to Mickiewicz and Herzen, asking for their assistance. = Paris = Norwid in 1882, by Pantaleon Szyndler During April 1854, Norwid returned to Europe with Prince Marcel Lubomirski. He lived in London and earned enough money through artistic endeavours to be finally able to return to Paris. With his artistic work revived, Norwid was able to publish several works. He took a very keen interest in the outbreak of the January Uprising in 1863. Although he could not participate personally due to his poor health, Norwid hoped to personally influence the outcome of the event. In 1866, the poet finished his work on Vade-Mecum, a vast anthology of verse. However, despite his greatest efforts and formidable contacts, it was unable to be published. This included Prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw Czartoryski failing to grant the poet the loan he had promised. In subsequent years, Norwid lived in extreme poverty and suffered from tuberculosis. His cousin, Micha≈Ç Kleczkowski, later relocated Norwid to the St. Casimir's Institute nursing home on the outskirts of Paris. During the last months of his life, Norwid was weak and bed-ridden; he frequently wept and refused to speak with anyone. He died in the morning of 23 May 1883.  Legacy  Norwid, Paris, 1861 Literary historians view Norwid's work as being too far ahead of its time to be appreciated,Jauss, Hans Robert. Preface to the German translation of Vade Mecum, M√ºnchen: Fink, 1981 possessing elements of romanticism, classicism and parnassianism. Following his death, many of Norwid's works were forgotten; it was not until the Young Poland period that his finesse and style was appreciated. At that time, his work was discovered and popularised by Zenon Przesmycki, a Polish poet and literary critic who was a member of the Polish Academy of Literature. Some eventually concluded that during his life, Norwid had been rejected by his contemporaries so that he could be understood by the next generation of \\"late grandsons.\\" Opinion is divided however, as to whether he was a true Romanticist artist ‚Äì or if he was artistically ahead of his time. Norwid's \\"Collected Works\\" (Dzie≈Ça Zebrane) were published in 1968 by Juliusz Wiktor Gomulicki, a Norwid biographer and commentator. The full iconic collection of the artist's work was released during the period 1971‚Äì76 as Pisma Wszystkie (\\"Collected Works\\"). Comprising 11 volumes, it includes all of Norwid's poetry as well as his letters and reproductions of his artwork. On 24 September 2001, 118 years after his death in France, an urn containing soil from the collective grave where Norwid had been buried in Paris' Montmorency cemetery, was enshrined in the \\"Crypts of the Bards\\" at Wawel Cathedral. There, Norwid's remains were placed next to those of fellow Polish poets Adam Mickiewicz and Juliusz S≈Çowacki. The cathedral's Zygmunt Bell, heard only when events of great national and religious significance occur, resounded loudly to mark the poet's return to his homeland. During a special Thanksgiving Mass held at the cathedral, the Archbishop of Krak√≥w, cardinal Franciszek Macharski said that 74 years after the remains of Juliusz Slowacki were brought in, again the doors of the crypt of bards have opened \\"to receive the great poet, Cyprian Norwid, into Wawel's royal cathedral, for he was the equal of kings\\".Cyprian Nowid's remains symbolically repatriated ‚Äì 2001, available at: http://info- poland.buffalo.edu/web/arts_culture/literature/poetry/norwid/rest.shtml In 1966, the Polish Scouts in Chicago acquired a 240-acre parcel of property in the northwoods of Wisconsin, 20 miles west of Crivitz, Wisconsin and named it Camp Norwid in his honor.

At first called the Crosley Corporation and later Crosley Motors Incorporated, the Cincinnati, Ohio, firm was active from 1939 to 1952, interrupted by World War II production. Their station wagons were the most popular model, but also offered were sedans, pickups, convertibles, a sports car, and even a tiny jeep-like vehicle. For export, the cars were badged Crosmobile. Crosley introduced several \\"firsts\\" in American automotive history, including the first affordable, mass-market car with an overhead camshaft engine in 1946; the first use of the term 'Sport(s-) Utility' in 1947, for a 1948 model year convertible wagon; and the first American cars to be fitted with 4-wheel caliper type disc brakes, as well as America's first post-war sports car, the Hotshot, in the 1949 model year. All of Crosley's models were lightweight () body-on-frame cars with rigid axles front and rear, and engines with less than displacement. With exception of the late introduced Hotshot and Farm-O-Road models, the vast majority of all Crosleys were built on an wheelbase,The same as the British 1959 Mini. and with leaf-springs. History Powel Crosley Jr. ca. 1940 Powel Crosley Jr. made his fortune in the automotive parts and accessories business, before diversifying into manufacturing other consumer products and Crosley automobiles in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1925 his company became the largest manufacturer of radios in the world. The financial success of his manufacturing and radio broadcasting businesses provided the funds for Crosley to pursue his lifelong interest in manufacturing automobiles. He introduced the first Crosley compact car in 1939. During World War II the Crosley company discontinued civilian automobile manufacturing and begin production of war-time materials, including development of experimental vehicles. In 1946 Crosley resumed production of compact and subcompact vehicles at its facility in Marion, Indiana, in addition to introducing new models and innovations to its offerings. After gas rationing was discontinued and the Big Three car makers began producing larger cars, consumer interest in Crosley's compact cars declined. The last Crosley car rolled off the assembly line on July 3, 1952, and the company focused on its other, more successful business ventures. =Developer and company founder= Industrialist Powel Crosley Jr. of Cincinnati, Ohio, owner of Crosley Broadcasting Corporation and the Cincinnati Reds baseball team, among other business interests, had ambitious plans to build subcompact cars. Crosley had built his first automobile at the age of twelve, and in 1907, at the age of twenty-one, formed Marathon Six Automotive in Connersville, Indiana. Crosley built a prototype of the \\"Marathon Six,\\" a six-cylinder automobile priced at US$1,700, which was at the low end of the luxury car market, but failed to fund its production. After working for several auto manufacturers in Indianapolis and Muncie, Indiana, and several more failed attempts to manufacture his own cars, including a cycle car model, Crosley found success in manufacturing automobile accessories as cofounder with Ira J. Cooper of the American Automobile Accessory Company in 1916, and bought out Cooper‚Äôs interest in the company. By 1919, Crosley and his younger brother and business partner, Lewis M. Crosley, had sold more than $1 million in parts and were diversifying into other consumer products. 1939 Crosley convertible 1950 Crosley CD pickup Crosley increased his fortune in the 1920s and 1930s by developing, manufacturing, selling inexpensive radios, such as the \\"Harko\\", the Crosley \\"Pup\\" and the \\"Roamio\\" models. The Crosley Radio Corporation became the world's largest radio manufacturer in 1925. It expanded operations at Camp Washington, a Cincinnati neighborhood, and began commercial radio broadcasting with WLW radio, considered \\"the Nation's Station.\\" Crosley's company also introduced new consumer products and home appliances in the 1930s, including the \\"Shelvador,\\" a refrigerator that had shelves in the doors, and other product innovations. The wealth that Crosley amassed from sales of these products provided the funds to diversify into other areas, including automobile manufacturing.Banks, \\"Big Dream, Small Car,\\" p. 32.Gugin and St. Clair, eds., p. 80. =First Crosley automobiles= Beginning in the late 1930s Crosley developed low-priced compact cars and other pint-size vehicles. The first experimental prototype of the Crosley car was the 1937 CRAD (for Crosley Radio Auto Division) that had a rear track. With the assistance of his brother, Lewis, a graduate engineer, Crosley also designed assembly plants for his manufacturing operations at Richmond and Marion, Indiana. On April 28, 1939, the first Crosley production car debuted at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to mixed reviews. It was a two-door convertible that weighed under . Initially offered at US$325 for a two-passenger coupe or $350 for a four-passenger sedan,The two models were essentially the same car, except the sedan had rear side windows. the Crosley cars were cheaper than the nearest competition, the American Austin Car Company's American Bantam, which sold for $449 to $565. The Crosley car's chassis had an wheelbase and used beam axles with leaf-springs (half-elliptic springs in front, and quarter- elliptic springs in the rear). Under the hood, a four-gallon, gravity-fed gas- tank mounted above the motor made it possible for the car to operate without a fuel pump. The engine was a small, air-cooled Waukesha two-cylinder boxer, much like that of the Citroen 2CV, and had a fan as an integral part of the flywheel. The engine was connected to a three-speed transmission that provided power directly via a torque tube to the rear axle, eliminating the need for joints. This arrangement was judged unreliable, and conventional universal joints were fitted starting in 1941. Production for 1939 was 2,017 units; however, only 422 cars were built in 1940. For 1941 a range of new, body-style variations of the wide car were introduced to expand the line-up: a station wagon, two panel vans (one called the \\"Parkway Delivery\\" had no front cabin roof), and a pick-up truck and \\"Covered Wagon\\" model that could convert into a truck by means of a removable back seat and detachable soft-top over the rear section. Crosley built nearly 2,300 cars in 1941. When the company introduced its first metal-topped model, the \\"Liberty Sedan,\\" for 1942, pricing across the model range was $299 to $450. During World War II, the Crosley car became attractive due to gasoline rationing and the car's fuel efficiency, an estimated at speeds of up to fifty miles per hour.Banks, \\"Big Dream, Small Car,\\" p. 33. Crosley was the last company to cease production of civilian vehicles in 1942, after building another 1,000 units that year. When the onset of war ended all automobile production in the United States in 1942, Crosley had produced a total of 5,757 cars. During the pre-war years the Crosley company operated manufacturing plants in Camp Washington, Ohio; Richmond, Indiana; and Marion, Indiana. The Crosley factories were converted to wartime production during the war. =War-time production= One of thirty-six Crosley CT-3 'Pup' extra-light, 4WD, mini-jeep prototypes. The Crosley Corporation was involved in war production planning before December 1941, and like the rest of American industry, it focused on manufacturing war-related products during the war years. The company made a variety of products, ranging from proximity fuzes, radio transceivers, field kitchens, and quarter-ton trailers, to gun turrets, among other items. Powered gun turrets for PT boats and B-24 and B-29 bombers were the company's largest contract. Crosley also produced a number of experimental vehicles during the war for the U.S. government. Crosley's auto manufacturing division, CRAD, in Richmond, Indiana, produced experimental motorcycles, tricycles, four-wheel-drive military light utility vehicles, a self-propelled gun, and continuous track vehicles, some of which were amphibious models. All of these military prototypes were powered by the 2-cylinder boxer engine that powered the original Crosley automobiles. Crosley had nearly 5,000 of the engines on hand when auto production ceased in 1942, and hoped to put them to use in war-time production of miniature vehicles. One vehicle prototype was the 1942‚Äì1943 Crosley CT-3 \\"Pup,\\" a lightweight, single- passenger, four-wheel-drive vehicle that was transportable and air-droppable from a C-47 Skytrain. Six of the , 2-cylinder Pups were deployed overseas after undergoing tests at Fort Benning, Georgia, but the project was discontinued due to several weak components.

From 1950 onwards, Crosley's main models gained roll-down instead of sliding side windows. =Crosmobile= Crosleys were built under the Crosmobile marque for overseas export. Crosmobiles were simply badge- engineered Crosleys, and were identical to standard Crosley models except for having Crosmobile-lettered hood and rear badges and hubcaps and instrument- cluster demarcations. The purpose of differentiating the exported Crosleys was to avoid confusion or conflict with Great Britain's non-related Crossley marque. Crosmobiles not only made it to Europe, but also elsewhere, including Cuba.Crosmobile wagon: A little car lasts a long time ‚Äì Caristas, The car lover's guide to Cuba =Post-war production and demise= Post-war production began with 4,999 vehicles in 1946, and increased to five-figure numbers, producing more than 22,500 cars in 1947. Crosley sales peaked in 1948, with 24,871 or 27,707 cars sold, depending on the source; however, the CoBra copper and stamped steel \\"tin block\\" engine proved a major misstep. Although it had proven reliable in military use, it fared poorly under less diligent civilian maintenance. The CoBra was replaced with a redesigned and more reliable conventional cast-iron engine in 1949, but the company's reputation suffered. Sales fell to 8,939 units in 1949, and to 7,612 in 1950. The addition of the Crosley \\"Hotshot\\" sports model and the \\"Farm-O-Road\\" model, a combination farm-tractor and all-wheel-drive vehicle in 1950, could not stop the decline.Banks, \\"Big Dream, Small Car,\\" pp. 36‚Äì37. More trouble came after the Big Three automakers introduced bigger, more lavish cars, and began manufacturing them in higher volumes and priced, in some cases, only little higher than a new Crosley car. Crosley sales dwindled to 4,839 units in 1951; only 1,522 Crosley vehicles were sold in 1952. Production ceased on July 3, 1952, when the final Crosley rolled off the production line. Crosley sold about 84,000 cars in total before closing down the operation in 1952.A plan to sell the Crosley auto concern to Nash failed to materialize, when Nash merged with Hudson. See Nash Club newsletter, 1986, volume 1. Crosley continued building engines for a short while to fulfill a government contract, but eventually the rights to the engine were sold. The Crosley plant in Marion, Indiana, was sold to the General Tire and Rubber Company.

The slightly larger and more aerodynamic model CC featured an all new body and engine. The chassis, suspension, brakes, and the rest of the drive-train were carried over from the pre-war models. Together with the Frazer / Kaiser of the same year, the 1946 Crosley CC was the first American mass-produced slab-sided / ponton-style bodied car. The post-war Crosleys also had a new, water-cooled, straight-four CoBra engine, carried over from military production. Although not much larger in displacement than its predecessor, power output was doubled to 26.5 HP, improving the car's performance, with a claimed cruising speed of , while fuel economy remained excellent at ‚Äì . Additionally, the CoBra (for Copper Brazed) was America's first affordable mass-production overhead camshaft car engine, built in five-figure numbers after Duesenberg built some 650 OHC Straight Eights from 1921‚Äì1926. Introduced as a steel roof, two-door, two-box fastback sedan and a fixed profile convertible (with fixed side windows and frames, like the Citro√´n 2CV and the 2007 Fiat 500), the car also became available as a pick-up ‚Äì initially with a pickup-box with the same rounded rear-side panels as the sedan (roundside pickup). In late 1947 a station wagon was added, as a 1948 model, as well as a panel van ‚Äì a derivative of the wagon, but with a different floorpan to yield a flatter floor. The panel delivery also had a side opening rear door, as opposed to the Station wagon's above/below split tailgate, while the basic sedan had no outside trunk lid ‚Äì access to the luggage space was only from inside the car. From the arrival of the station wagon, the pickups were built with the wagon's straight rear panels, giving a wider, more square rear box. In 1948 Crosley added bolt-on grille-bars and a chromed bull-nose to the front for the '48¬Ω model year, and introduced a new convertible wagon variant without doors, dubbed the \\"Sports Utility.\\" The vehicle was advertised with a quarter-ton payload capacity for utility use, and its rear seat was optional. The entire range of CC models were based on the same two-door car and frame. The 1948 Station Wagon became the most popular model Crosley built, with 23,489 units made. A 1947 test of the Crosley sedan and convertible determined that \\"There is leg room for a man as tall as six feet two or three but due to the over-curve of the top and the window design, he may have to duck to see left or right\\", and unless he is narrow-shouldered \\"he will have to ride these things side saddle or not at all\\". Further, the tester felt that the engine lacked bottom-end power, and that the true cruising speed was between 35 and 40 mph ‚Äî the car will do 50 mph, and he drove one faster than that, but at these speeds \\"the little 4-cylinder engine screams like a banshee with the hot-foot\\" and driving felt quite uncomfortable. Also, the inside door handles were placed too far back, and the two-piece, sliding door windows made it impossible to comfortably drive with one arm out of the window. On the other hand the tester deemed that 'the chassis rides exceptionally well\\", \\".. undoubtedly the best of the miniature type ever made in this country\\".

File:1950 Crosley CD Four Super photo2.JPGThe chrome hood ornament was introduced early in the '48 model year. =Crosley CD Four (1949‚Äì1952)= In 1948 Crosley replaced the CC with the 1949 model year CD. Front and rear bodywork were redesigned on the sedan / coupe and convertible, though rear bodywork on the station wagon and pickup remained largely unaltered. A significant change was fitting the cast-iron block CIBA engine instead of the stamped-steel CoBra engines, that were lighter, but required more maintenance, or else would yield reliability problems. For 1949 and 50 there were standard and Deluxe models. The '49 model year still had sliding glass side windows in the doors, but from the 1950 model year, roll-down windows and electric wipers were offered. For 1951 and 1952 the front was again redone; the Deluxe model replaced the standard model as the bottom of the range, and 'Super' models were introduced as the new top of the line.Details on Crosley CD Models 1949‚Äì1952 ‚Äì Crosley Auto Club The CD models started with the same 6\\" mechanical brakes as previous Crosleys on the 1949 model, but switched to 4-wheel Goodyear‚ÄìHawley aircraft-type disc brakes in May 1949, However, they were short-lived, and only continued through mid 1950. The alloy disc material was found to rust, and had freeze-up problems in parts of the country where salt was used on the roads. So 9\\" hydraulic brakes were phased back in, and these remained til the end of production. =Crosley Hotshot= After building only bottom-end of the market economy cars since its inception, Crosley introduced a little sports car in 1949, the doorless Hotshot roadster. It also featured a largely new, dropped frame ‚Äì both more low slung, and for the first time with a wheelbase that diverged from all the previous Crosley models' wheelbase by extra. The rear suspension used a combination of coil springs, assisted by single leaf quarter-elliptical leaf-springs that doubled as torque-rods, and the car had disc brakes on all four wheels. The engine was placed behind the front axle, for a front mid-engined layout. The long Hotshot, introduced for $849, weighed just . But to go racing, the weight was further reducible to , by temporarily discarding such things as the detachable windscreen, and the non-folding (stowed) soft-top and side-curtains. There was no trunk lid ‚Äî the spare wheel was mounted on the down-sloping rear deck, above the rear bumper, and access to the rear stowage room was by folding the seat-backs forward. Powered by a 26.5 HP CIBA engine, the Hotshot was capable of more than .Crosley Hotshot Is America's Smallest Sports Car ‚Äì Jalopnik A Super version of the HotShot was added in 1950, featuring solid hinged doors and a fold-down top that didn't have to be stowed, and \\"full red plastic leather upholstery and lining\\".1951 Crosley Line-up advertisement ‚Äì classiccarcatalogue.com For 1951 and 1952 the Super Hotshot was simply renamed the Super Sports. Regardless of its short life and small size, the Hotshot is remembered as an impressive sports car within its class. A Hotshot won the Sam Collier Memorial Endurance Grand Prix,Sam Collier Memorial Sebring Grand Prix of Endurance Six Hours www.racingsportscars.com, Retrieved on 31 July 2012 (averaging 52 mph), as well as the \\"index of performance\\" ‚Äî an award which took speed and engine size into account ‚Äî at the 1950 Six Hours of Sebring; and a Siata 300 fitted with Crosley power won the SCCA's 12 hour Vero Beach race. Throughout the 1950s, Crosley engines dominated 750 cc sports car racing, winning 10 out of 12 SCCA west-coast races alone. 1951 Crosley Super Sport rear =Crosley Farm-O-Road= Crosley had produced different products for the war effort, including the 'Pup' 4x4 prototype, a tiny air-portable 4WD. In 1950, to broaden its line-up into the commercial and agricultural market, the Farm-O-Road was introduced ‚Äì an ATV sized utility vehicle that looked like a small Jeep. It was a combination of a light tractor, a small pickup and a passenger vehicle, and was intended for rural customers who wanted a vehicle for doing chores around the farm, but which could also take them into town. According to Crosley, the Farm-O-Road was designed: ‚ÄúTo do big jobs on small farms, and smaller jobs on big farms.‚Äù Although it could be viewed as a precursor to today‚Äôs Side by Side UTV's, the Farm-O-Road was fully street-legal, with a top speed estimated at on the highway. The Farm-O-Road took its cues from the Jeep and the wartime Pup. It had a boxy, minimalist body, riding on a wheelbase, and it weighed . The Farm-O-Road was powered by the same 26.5 HP CIBA engine as the other Crosley models at the time, mated to a three-speed Warner T-92 transmission with a two-ratio, PTO-capable range box mounted behind it. In addition to normal gearing, it offered a 4-to-1 low reduction.Farm-O-Road advertisement ‚Äì classiccarcatalogue.com The base price was $795, or $939 with a hydraulic system including a hydraulically operated drawbar. Options included dual rear wheels, a detachable pickup bed which could come with a hydraulic dump, power take-offs on both front and rear, a rear seat, a soft-top, and side window curtains. An extensive range of farm- implement attachments was available, including a 10-inch single bottom plow, a moldboard plow, snow plow, a cutter-bar mower, sickle-bar mower, three-gang reel-type mower, a rolling coulter, disc harrow, cultivator, hay rake, row crop seeders, fertilizer unit, row guide, velocity governor, hand throttle, radiator chaff screen, post-hole digger, and spring blocks. Crosley even offered steam-bent wooden front snow skis that could be strapped to the front tires to convert the Farm-O-Road into a snowmobile. For the rest, equipment was spartan. Most Farm-O-Roads had only one windshield wiper ‚Äì a right wiper was optional; and a heater or radio were not offered. Exact production numbers aren‚Äôt known, but historians with the Crosley Automobile Club estimate less than 600 Farm-O-Roads were built. Later, Crofton Marine Engineering bought the rights and tooling for the rig and put it back into production from ‚Äô59-‚Äô63 as the \\"Crofton Bug\\", resulting in another ~250 units. The Farm-O-Road measured long (without the optional, detachable bed) by wide (excluding the side- mounted spare wheel), and high (with the windshield and top up), and offered payload. Axles were rigid front and rear ‚Äì as on all other Crosleys ‚Äì with a 5.38:1 ratio Spicer 23 in the rear. The little 1950 vehicle was also compared with the 1959/1960 M422 Mighty Mite, the U.S. military's smallest jeep, originally with a wheelbase. Engines =Waukesha Model 150 Cub Twin= The original engine is the Waukesha Model 150 Cub Twin, a or air-cooled L-head opposed twin-cylinder engine, putting out 14 HP at 3200 rpm,Twin Cub 150 ‚Äì Waukesha Engine Historical Society, Inc built by Waukesha Engines of Waukesha, Wisconsin, and used from 1939 through 1942. The engine was originally designed to power orchard sprayers. However, many of the over 12,000 built between 1938-44, were used in the pre-war (1939-42) Crosley mini-cars and the military during WWII, some of which were also used for Auxiliary Power Units (APU). It was replaced in 1946 with the CoBra (for \\"Copper Brazed\\"), a overhead-cam four with a bore and stroke. That engine in turn was replaced in 1949 by the new and more reliable CIBA (Crosley Cast Iron Block Assembly) engine utilizing five main bearings. =Crosley CoBra (1946‚Äì1949)= The CoBra (Copper Brazed, also known as \\"The Mighty Tin\\") was originally developed by Lloyd Taylor, of Taylor Engines in California, for military use aboard PT boats and B-17 Flying Fortress bombers. The engine was made from sheet metal rather than cast iron like most other engines. This was done to get a thin, uniform wall thickness and thus avoid the creation of hot spots around the combustion chamber that could ignite the fuel, causing pre-ignition (knocks), which in turn limited the compression ratio. These engines were used mainly to power generators, refrigeration compressors, etc., and were widely praised for their successes in the war effort. The engine was adopted for automobile use in 1946. It was a small, lightweight engine with single overhead camshaft driven by two sets of bevel gears and a vertical shaft at the front of the block. It was America's first overhead camshaft automobile engine to be produced in five-figure numbers, after Duesenberg built some 650 overhead cam Straight Eights from 1921‚Äì1926. The unitary block and cylinder head weighed only dry; complete with all accessories (including the flywheel) weighing only .Crosley Engine ‚Äì Sports Racer Network The engine displaced and produced at 5,400 rpm and @ 1200 rpm.1946 Crosley CC-Series Sedan full range specs ‚Äì automobile-catalog.com Because of its remarkable power to weight ratio, and super efficiency for its time, the CoBra engine has been compared to Ford's 1.0 litre inline-3 EcoBoost engine.Decades Before Ford's Tiny EcoBoost, There Was The CoBra Sheetmetal Engine ‚Äì Jalopnik Longevity was measured in hours and was strictly controlled by equipment maintenance schedules for the wartime duties, but corrosion became a problem for these engines in civilian service. This problem with these automotive powerplants had tarnished Crosley's reputation by 1948. =Crosley CIBA (1949-1952; 1955)= Crosley racing engine with a supercharger The Crosley CIBA (Cast Iron Block Assembly) was a more traditional and more reliable engine utilizing a cast-iron block. Nevertheless it had a unique design. Instead of a removable cylinder head ‚Äî the combustion chambers, valve seats, cam supports, ports and cylinders are one casting, and the crankcase is another. In both the early and later cast-iron engines, the crankcase is aluminum. The engine produced 26.5 HP @ 5,400 rpm and @ 3,000 rpm. When Crosley Motors, Inc. was sold, the engine was renamed \\"AeroJet\\" and production continued. Production of the AeroJet ended in 1955 and the engine rights were sold to Fageol and later to a series of different companies ending in 1972 with the Fisher-Pierce Bearcat 55. Maritime modifications mostly included increasing displacement and converting the engine to operate with a vertical axis. In Europe the Crosley CIBA would be used to great advantage in 750cc sports car class, eventually maturing to a double overhead camshaft (DOHC) design used in the Bandini 750 sport internazionale as well as Nardi 750LM and Siata Amica.

Settled on of land, it has a population of more than 15,000. Over 50% of the population is estimated to be under the age of 18. History =Etymology= When Christian missionaries first arrived in the Marshall Islands, they introduced Latin script writing and orthographized the Marshallese language. Originally, Ebeye was written Ebeje by Europeans (' in modern orthography, pronounced ), which (according to elders of the atoll) means \\"making something out of nothing.\\" However, the colonial German administration mispronounced the J as if it were German language , and foreign observers recorded the resulting pronunciation as Ebeye. During the Japanese period, though, the island's pronunciation in katakana, , re-approximated Marshallese. After World War II, the Americans took possession of the regional mandate from Japan and mispronounced the island's name as from its spelling. Because most of the modern Marshallese residents of Ebeye don't have family roots on the island, the American pronunciation has stuck, and is the usual name for Ebeye among the island's current population. This pronunciation has even been adapted to Marshallese orthography, so that there are now two synonymous Marshallese names for the island officially and historically ', and locally '. =World War II= Ebeye island being shelled on 30 January 1944 Ebeye Island seaplane base in 1945 The Imperial Japanese Navy constructed a seaplane base on Ebeye in the early 1940s. Following the Battle of Kwajalein from 31 January to 3 February 1944, Ebeye was occupied by US forces. On 7 March the 107th Naval Construction Battalion was sent to Ebeye to redevelop the seaplane base. The Seabees repaired the existing pier, adding a ell extension, and also repaired a Japanese H-shaped pier. The Seabees assembled a pontoon wharf and pontoon barges for transporting damaged carrier aircraft to repair units ashore. Further installations on Ebeye consisted of housing in floored tents and Quonset huts, a 150-bed dispensary, four magazines, of covered storage, and a aviation-gasoline tank farm. =Emigration from the Mid-Atoll Corridor= Before the early 1950s, a large number of present-day residents of Ebeye lived on small islands throughout Kwajalein Atoll. When Kwajalein island started to be used as a support base for the nuclear tests conducted at Bikini Atoll and Enewetak Atoll, Marshallese residents of Kwajalein were relocated by U.S. authorities to a small, planned community constructed on Ebeye, which was largely unpopulated and had served as a Japanese seaplane base before the Pacific War. In 1950, the US Navy constructed a LORAN station on Ebeye. It was disestablished in 1977. With the advent of the Nike-Zeus anti-ballistic missile testing program of the 1960s, the U.S. military decided for safety and security reasons to evacuate slightly more than 100 residents of the central part of the atoll to create a zone where unarmed guided missiles could be targeted from the continental United States. Subsequent population growth by migration from outlying rural atolls and islands throughout the Marshalls created a housing shortage and problems with resources throughout the following decades. Some of the original Ebeye inhabitants with land rights did not feel adequately compensated for the tenants who came to live on their land even though their paramount chief had worked with the Trust Territory to move them there. Geography Ebeye is the most populous island of Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, as well as the center for Marshallese culture in the Ralik Chain of the archipelago. It comprises . It is the sixth most densely populated island in the world. =Climate= Demographics Ebeye has a population of more than 15,000. In 2008, the population was 12,000. In 1968, the population was 3,000. =Refuge from nuclear fallout= Some of the residents of Ebeye are refugees or descendants of refugees from the effects of the 15-megaton Castle Bravo nuclear test at Bikini Atoll on 1 March 1954. The detonation unexpectedly rained nuclear fallout and two inches (50 mm) of radioactive snow on nearby Rongelap Atoll, which had not been evacuated as had Bikini. The 1954 American authorities then evacuated Rongelap and were returned in 1957 with extensive medical surveillance. In 1985, Greenpeace evacuated the inhabitants of Rongelap to Mejato (island in Kwajalein atoll). Ebeye was the final destination for many of them. =Health= Infant mortality on Ebeye is 3.0% . There have been recurrent outbreaks of cholera, dengue fever, and tuberculosis. In 1963 there was a polio outbreak, and in 1978 a measles outbreak. In 2009, the Ebeye Community Health Center was awarded a grant as part of the United States Stimulus for monitoring influenza (e.g. H1N1). Economy The Marshall Islands subsists primarily upon foreign aid and lease payments from the United States for the military use of Kwajalein Atoll. The United States provides $1.5 billion in aid under the Compact of Free Association, spread out over the 20 years of the agreement, which expires in 2023. Apart from this, handicrafts are produced and there is a small fishery.

It was a result of strong aesthetic opposition to the earlier ideas of Positivism which followed the suppression of the 1863 January Uprising against the occupying army of Imperial Russia. M≈Çoda Polska promoted trends of decadence, neo-romanticism, symbolism, impressionism and art nouveau.

The earlier was a typically modernist disillusionment with the bourgeoisie, its life style and its culture. Artists following this concept also believed in decadence, an end of all culture, conflict between humans and their civilization, and the concept of art as the highest value (art for art's sake). Authors who followed this concept included Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer, Stanis≈Çaw Przybyszewski, Wac≈Çaw Rolicz-Lieder and Jan Kasprowicz. A later concept was a continuation of romanticism, and as such is often called neo-romanticism. The group of writers following this idea was less organised and the writers themselves covered a large variety of topics in their writings: from sense of mission of a Pole in Stefan ≈ªeromski's prose, through social inequality described by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Reymont and Gabriela Zapolska to criticism of Polish society and Polish history by Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski. Writers of this period include also: Wac≈Çaw Berent, Jan Kasprowicz, Jan Augustyn Kisielewski, Antoni Lange, Jan Lema≈Ñski, Boles≈Çaw Le≈õmian, Tadeusz Mici≈Ñski, Andrzej Niemojewski, Franciszek Nowicki, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Orkan, Artur Oppman, W≈Çodzimierz Perzy≈Ñski, Tadeusz Rittner, Wac≈Çaw Sieroszewski, Leopold Staff, Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer, Maryla Wolska, Eleonora Kalkowska, Tadeusz Boy-≈ªele≈Ñski, and Jerzy ≈ªu≈Çawski.  Music  In music, the term Young Poland is applied to an informal group of composers that include Karol Szymanowski, Grzegorz Fitelberg, Ludomir R√≥≈ºycki as well as Mieczys≈Çaw Kar≈Çowicz and Apolinary Szeluto. Almost all educated by Zygmunt Noskowski, the group was under strong influence of neoromanticism in music and especially of foreign composers such as Richard Strauss, Richard Wagner and those belonging to The Mighty Handful group e.g. Modest Mussorgsky, Alexander Borodin and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.  Visual arts  Kazimierz Stabrowski, Peacock. Portrait of Zofia Boruci≈Ñska, 1908 In the period of Young Poland there were no overwhelming trends in Polish art. The painters and sculptors tried to continue the romantic traditions with new ways of expression popularised abroad. The most influential trend was art nouveau, although Polish artists started to seek also some form of a national style (including styl zakopia≈Ñski or the Zakopane style). Both sculpture and painting were also heavily influenced by all forms of symbolism.Figuration/abstraction: strat√©gies for public sculpture in Europe, 1945-1968 by Charlotte Benton Prominent Young Poland painters and sculptors include: * Ferdynand Ruszczyc * Jacek Malczewski * Jan Bukowski * Jan Raszka * Jan Stanis≈Çawski * Jan Talaga * Julian Fa≈Çat * J√≥zef Mehoffer * J√≥zef Pankiewicz * Karol Frycz * Kazimierz Sichulski * Konstanty Brandel * Konstanty Laszczka * Leon Wycz√≥≈Çkowski * Ludwik Konarzewski * Maurycy Lilien * Olga Bozna≈Ñska * Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski * Teodor Axentowicz * Teofil Terlecki * Wac≈Çaw Szymanowski * Witold Wojtkiewicz * Wojciech Gerson * Wojciech Kossak * Wojciech Weiss * W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈ölewi≈Ñski * W≈Çodzimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer * Xawery Dunikowski See also * History of Poland (1795‚Äì1918)  Notes and references  *Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski, biography from the Adam Mickiewicz Institute *First review of Wesele (The Wedding Reception) * Wyspia≈Ñski‚Äôs Herbal *Wyspia≈Ñski‚Äôs paintings *Wyspia≈Ñski stained- glasses * Kultura polska - Konstanty Laszczka  Bibliography  *Dobrowolski Tadeusz, Sztuka M≈Çodej Polski, Warszawa 1963. *S≈Çownik artyst√≥w polskich i obcych w Polsce dzia≈ÇajƒÖcych.

As a 15-year-old, Aleksander G≈Çowacki joined the Polish 1863 Uprising against Imperial Russia. Shortly after his 16th birthday, he suffered severe battle injuries. Five months later, he was imprisoned for his part in the Uprising. These early experiences may have precipitated the panic disorder and agoraphobia that dogged him through life, and shaped his opposition to attempting to regain Poland's independence by force of arms. In 1872, at the age of 25, in Warsaw, he settled into a 40-year journalistic career that highlighted science, technology, education, and economic and cultural development. These societal enterprises were essential to the endurance of a people who had in the 18th century been partitioned out of political existence by Russia, Prussia and Austria. G≈Çowacki took his pen name \\"Prus\\" from the appellation of his family's coat-of-arms. As a sideline, he wrote short stories. Succeeding with these, he went on to employ a larger canvas; over the decade between 1884 and 1895, he completed four major novels: The Outpost, The Doll, The New Woman and Pharaoh. The Doll depicts the romantic infatuation of a man of action who is frustrated by his country's backwardness. Pharaoh, Prus's only historical novel, is a study of political power and of the fates of nations, set in ancient Egypt at the fall of the 20th Dynasty and New Kingdom.  Life  = Early years = Prus's Hrubiesz√≥w birthplace Lublin Castle, Prus's prison during 1863‚Äì65 Uprising Aleksander G≈Çowacki was born 20 August 1847 in Hrubiesz√≥w, now in southeastern Poland, very near the present-day border with Ukraine. The town was then in the Russian-controlled sector of partitioned Poland, known as the \\"Congress Kingdom\\". Aleksander was the younger son of Antoni G≈Çowacki, an estate steward at the village of ≈ªabcze, in Hrubiesz√≥w County, and Apolonia G≈Çowacka (n√©e Trembi≈Ñska).Krystyna Tokarz√≥wna, Stanis≈Çaw Fita, Boles≈Çaw Prus, 1847‚Äì1912: Kalendarz ≈ºycia i tw√≥rczo≈õci (Boles≈Çaw Prus, 1847‚Äì1912: a Calendar of His Life and Work), ed. Zygmunt Szweykowski, Warsaw, Pa≈Ñstwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, 1969, p. 12. In 1850, when the future Boles≈Çaw Prus was three years old, his mother died; the child was placed in the care of his maternal grandmother, Marcjanna Trembi≈Ñska of Pu≈Çawy, and, four years later, in the care of his aunt, Domicela Olszewska of Lublin. In 1856 Prus was orphaned by his father's death and, aged 9, began attending a Lublin primary school whose principal, J√≥zef Sk≈Çodowski, grandfather of the future double Nobel laureate Maria Sk≈Çodowska-Curie, administered canings (a customary mode of disciplining) to wayward pupils, including the spirited Aleksander.Monika PiƒÖtkowska, Prus: ≈öledztwo biograficzne (Prus: A Biographical Investigation), Krak√≥w, Wydawnictwo Znak, 2017, , pp. 49‚Äì50. In 1862, Prus's brother, Leon, a teacher thirteen years his senior, took him to Siedlce, then to Kielce. Soon after the outbreak of the Polish January 1863 Uprising against Imperial Russia, 15-year-old Prus ran away from school to join the insurgents.Pie≈õcikowski, Edward, Boles≈Çaw Prus, p. 147. He may have been influenced by his brother Leon, one of the Uprising's leaders. Leon, during a June 1863 mission to Wilno (now Vilnius) in Lithuania for the Polish insurgent government, developed a debilitating mental illness that would end only with his death in 1907.Pie≈õcikowski, Edward, Boles≈Çaw Prus, p. 165. On 1 September 1863, twelve days after his sixteenth birthday, Prus took part in a battle against Russian forces at a village called Bia≈Çka, four kilometers south of Siedlce. He suffered contusions to the neck and gunpowder injuries to his eyes, and was captured unconscious on the battlefield and taken to hospital in Siedlce. This experience may have caused his subsequent lifelong agoraphobia. Prus: Warsaw University student Five months later, in early February 1864, Prus was arrested and imprisoned at Lublin Castle for his role in the Uprising. In early April a military court sentenced him to forfeiture of his nobleman's status and resettlement on imperial lands. On 30 April, however, the Lublin District military head credited Prus's time spent under arrest and, on account of the 16-year-old's youth, decided to place him in the custody of his uncle Klemens Olszewski. On 7 May, Prus was released and entered the household of Katarzyna Trembi≈Ñska, a relative and the mother of his future wife, Oktawia Trembi≈Ñska. Prus enrolled at a Lublin gymnasium (secondary school), the still functioning prestigious Stanis≈Çaw Staszic School, founded in 1586. Graduating on 30 June 1866, at nineteen he matriculated in the Warsaw University Department of Mathematics and Physics. In 1868, poverty forced him to break off his university studies. In 1869, he enrolled in the Forestry Department at the newly opened Agriculture and Forestry Institute in Pu≈Çawy, a historic town where he had spent some of his childhood and which, 15 years later, was the setting for his striking 1884 micro-story, \\"Mold of the Earth\\", comparing human history with the mutual aggressions of blind, mindless colonies of molds that cover a boulder adjacent to the Temple of the Sibyl. In January 1870, after only three months at the Institute, Prus was expelled for his insufficient deference toward the martinet Russian-language instructor. Henceforth he studied on his own while supporting himself mainly as a tutor. As part of his program of self-education, he translated and summarized John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic. In 1872, he embarked on a career as a newspaper columnist, while working several months at the Evans, Lilpop and Rau Machine and Agricultural Implement Works in Warsaw. In 1873, Prus delivered two public lectures which illustrate the breadth of his scientific interests: \\"On the Structure of the Universe\\", and \\"On Discoveries and Inventions.\\" = Columnist = Prus As a newspaper columnist, Prus commented on the achievements of scholars and scientists such as John Stuart Mill, Charles Darwin, Alexander Bain, Herbert Spencer and Henry Thomas Buckle; urged Poles to study science and technology and to develop industry and commerce;Krystyna Tokarz√≥wna and Stanis≈Çaw Fita, Boles≈Çaw Prus, 1847‚Äì1912: Kalendarz ≈ºycia i tw√≥rczo≈õci (Boles≈Çaw Prus, 1847‚Äì1912: A Calendar of His Life and Work), passim. encouraged the establishment of charitable institutions to benefit the underprivileged; described the fiction and nonfiction works of fellow writers such as H.G. Wells; and extolled man-made and natural wonders such as the Wieliczka Salt Mine, an 1887 solar eclipse that he witnessed at M≈Çawa, planned building of the Eiffel Tower for the 1889 Paris Exposition,Boles≈Çaw Prus, \\"Wie≈ºa paryska\\" (\\"The Paris Tower\\"), in Kurier Warszawski (Warsaw Courier), no. 59, 1887. and Na≈Çƒôcz√≥w, where he vacationed for 30 years.Boles≈Çaw Prus, \\"Z Na≈Çƒôczowa\\" (\\"From Na≈Çƒôcz√≥w\\"), in Kurier Codzienny (Daily Courier), no. 237, 1894. His \\"Weekly Chronicles\\" spanned forty years (they have since been reprinted in twenty volumes) and helped prepare the ground for the 20th- century blossoming of Polish science and especially mathematics. \\"Our national life,\\" wrote Prus, \\"will take a normal course only when we have become a useful, indispensable element of civilization, when we have become able to give nothing for free and to demand nothing for free.\\" The social importance of science and technology recurred as a theme in his novels The Doll (1889)Zygmunt Szweykowski, Tw√≥rczo≈õƒá Boles≈Çawa Prusa (The Creative Writing of Boles≈Çaw Prus), pp. 170‚Äì71. and Pharaoh (1895).Christopher Kasparek, \\"Prus' Pharaoh: Primer on Power\\", The Polish Review, vol. XL, no. 3, 1995, p. 332. Of contemporary thinkers, the one who most influenced Prus and other writers of the Polish \\"Positivist\\" period (roughly 1864‚Äì1900) was Herbert Spencer, the English sociologist who coined the phrase, \\"survival of the fittest.\\" Prus called Spencer \\"the Aristotle of the 19th century\\" and wrote: \\"I grew up under the influence of Spencerian evolutionary philosophy and heeded its counsels, not those of Idealist or Comtean philosophy.\\"Zygmunt Szweykowski, Tw√≥rczo≈õƒá Boles≈Çawa Prusa (The Art of Boles≈Çaw Prus), p. 22. Prus interpreted \\"survival of the fittest,\\" in the societal sphere, as involving not only competition but also cooperation; and he adopted Spencer's metaphor of society as organism.Zygmunt Szweykowski, Tw√≥rczo≈õƒá Boles≈Çawa Prusa (The Art of Boles≈Çaw Prus), pp. 32‚Äì33. He used this metaphor to striking effect in his 1884 micro- story \\"Mold of the Earth,\\" and in the introduction to his 1895 historical novel, Pharaoh.Christopher Kasparek, \\"Prus' Pharaoh: the Creation of a Historical Novel\\", The Polish Review, 1994, no. 1, p. 49. After Prus began writing regular weekly newspaper columns, his finances stabilized, permitting him on 14 January 1875 to marry a distant cousin on his mother's side, Oktawia Trembi≈Ñska. She was the daughter of Katarzyna Trembi≈Ñska, in whose home he had lived, after release from prison, for two years from 1864 to 1866 while completing secondary school. The couple adopted a boy, Emil Trembi≈Ñski (born 11 September 1886, the son of Prus's brother-in-law Micha≈Ç Trembi≈Ñski, who had died on 10 November 1888). Emil was the model for Rascal in chapter 48 of Prus's 1895 novel, Pharaoh. On 18 February 1904, aged seventeen, Emil fatally shot himself in the chest on the doorstep of an unrequited love. It has been alleged that in 1906, aged 59, Prus had a son, Jan Bogusz Sacewicz. The boy's mother was Alina Sacewicz, widow of Dr. Kazimierz Sacewicz, a socially conscious physician whom Prus had known at Na≈Çƒôcz√≥w. Dr. Sacewicz may have been the model for Stefan ≈ªeromski's Dr. Judym in the novel, Ludzie bezdomni (Homeless People)‚Äîa character resembling Dr. Stockman in Henrik Ibsen's play, An Enemy of the People. Prus, known for his affection for children, took a lively interest in little Jan, as attested by a prolific correspondence with Jan's mother (whom Prus attempted to interest in writing). Jan Sacewicz became one of Prus's major legatees and an engineer, and died in a German camp after the suppression of the Warsaw Uprising of August‚ÄìOctober 1944. Coat-of-arms that inspired the pen-name \\"Boles≈Çaw Prus\\" Though Prus was a gifted writer, initially best known as a humorist, he early on thought little of his journalistic and literary work. Hence at the inception of his career in 1872, at the age of 25, he adopted for his newspaper columns and fiction the pen name \\"Prus\\" (\\"Prus I\\" was his family coat-of-arms), reserving his actual name, Aleksander G≈Çowacki, for \\"serious\\" writing. An 1878 incident illustrates the strong feelings that can be aroused in susceptible readers of newspaper columns. Prus had criticized the rowdy behavior of some Warsaw university students at a lecture about the poet Wincenty Pol. The students demanded that Prus retract what he had written. He refused, and, on 26 March 1878, several of them surrounded him outside his home, where he had returned shortly before in the company (for his safety) of two fellow writers; one of the students, Jan Sawicki, slapped Prus's face. Police were summoned, but Prus declined to press charges. Seventeen years later, during his 1895 visit to Paris, Prus's memory of the incident was still so painful that he may have refused (accounts vary) to meet with one of his assailants, Kazimierz D≈Çuski, and his wife Bronis≈Çawa D≈Çuska (Marie Sk≈Çodowska Curie's sister who 19 years later, in 1914, scolded Joseph Conrad for writing his novels and stories in English, rather than in Polish for the benefit of Polish cultureZdzis≈Çaw Najder, Joseph Conrad: A Life, 2007, p. 463.). These curiously interlinked incidents involving the D≈Çuskis and the two authors perhaps illustrate the contemporary intensity of aggrieved Polish national pride. In 1882, on the recommendation of an earlier editor-in-chief, the prophet of Polish Positivism, Aleksander ≈öwiƒôtochowski, Prus succeeded to the editorship of the Warsaw daily Nowiny (News). The newspaper had been bought in June 1882 by financier Stanis≈Çaw Kronenberg. Prus resolved, in the best Positivist fashion, to make it \\"an observatory of societal facts\\"‚Äîan instrument for advancing the development of his country. After less than a year, however, Nowiny‚Äîwhich had had a history of financial instability since changing in July 1878 from a Sunday paper to a daily‚Äîfolded, and Prus resumed writing columns.Pie≈õcikowski, Edward, Boles≈Çaw Prus, 152. He continued working as a journalist to the end of his life, well after he had achieved success as an author of short stories and novels.Pie≈õcikowski, Edward, Boles≈Çaw Prus, p. 166. In an 1884 newspaper column, published two decades before the Wright brothers flew, Prus anticipated that powered flight would not bring humanity closer to universal comity: \\"Are there among flying creatures only doves, and no hawks? Will tomorrow‚Äôs flying machine obey only the honest and the wise, and not fools and knaves?... The expected societal changes may come down to a new form of chase and combat in which the man who is vanquished on high will fall and smash the skull of the peaceable man down below.\\"Cited in Zygmunt Szweykowski, Tw√≥rczo≈õƒá Boles≈Çawa Prusa (The Creative Writing of Boles≈Çaw Prus), 2nd ed., Warsaw, Pa≈Ñstwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, 1972, p. 171. In a January 1909 column, Prus discussed H.G. Wells's 1901 book, Anticipations, including Wells's prediction that by the year 2000, following the defeat of German imperialism \\"on land and at sea,\\" there would be a European Union that would reach eastward to include the western Slavs‚Äîthe Poles, Czechs and Slovaks. The latter peoples, along with the Hungarians and six other countries, did in fact join the European Union in 2004. = Fiction = Holewi≈Ñski. Frontispiece to first book edition of The Doll, 1890. In time, Prus adopted the French Positivist critic Hippolyte Taine's concept of the arts, including literature, as a second means, alongside the sciences, of studying reality, and he devoted more attention to his sideline of short-story writer. Prus's stories, which met with great acclaim, owed much to the literary influence of Polish novelist J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski and, among English-language writers, to Charles Dickens and Mark Twain. His fiction was also influenced by French writers Victor Hugo, Gustave Flaubert, Alphonse Daudet and √âmile Zola. Prus wrote several dozen stories, originally published in newspapers and ranging in length from micro-story to novella. Characteristic of them are Prus's keen observation of everyday life and sense of humor, which he had early honed as a contributor to humor magazines. The prevalence of themes from everyday life is consistent with the Polish Positivist artistic program, which sought to portray the circumstances of the populace rather than those of the Romantic heroes of an earlier generation. The literary period in which Prus wrote was ostensibly a prosaic one, by contrast with the poetry of the Romantics; but Prus's prose is often a poetic prose. His stories also often contain elements of fantasy or whimsy. A fair number originally appeared in New Year's issues of newspapers.Tokarz√≥wna, Krystyna; Stanis≈Çaw Fita, Boles≈Çaw Prus, 1847‚Äì1912: Kalendarz ≈ºycia i tw√≥rczo≈õci, passim. Prus long eschewed writing historical fiction, arguing that it must inevitably distort history. He criticized contemporary historical novelists for their lapses in historical accuracy, including Henryk Sienkiewicz's failure, in the military scenes in his Trilogy portraying 17th-century Polish history, to describe the logistics of warfare. It was only in 1888, when Prus was forty, that he wrote his first historical fiction, the stunning short story, \\"A Legend of Old Egypt.\\" This story, a few years later, served as a preliminary sketch for his only historical novel, Pharaoh (1895).Szweykowski, Zygmunt, \\"Geneza noweli 'Z legend dawnego Egiptu'\\" (The Genesis of the Short Story, \\"A Legend of Old Egypt\\"), in Nie tylko o Prusie: szkice (Not Only about Prus: Sketches), 1st ed., 1967, pp. 256‚Äì61. Eventually Prus composed four novels on what he had referred to in an 1884 letter as \\"great questions of our age\\": The Outpost (Plac√≥wka, 1886) on the Polish peasant; The Doll (Lalka, 1889) on the aristocracy and townspeople and on idealists struggling to bring about social reforms; The New Woman (Emancypantki, 1893) on feminist concerns; and his only historical novel, Pharaoh (Faraon, 1895), on mechanisms of political power. The work of greatest sweep and most universal appeal is Pharaoh. Prus's novels, like his stories, were originally published in newspaper serialization.Szweykowski, Zygmunt, Tw√≥rczo≈õƒá Boles≈Çawa Prusa, passim. After having sold Pharaoh to the publishing firm of Gebethner and Wolff, Prus embarked, on 16 May 1895, on a four-month journey abroad. He visited Berlin, Dresden, Karlsbad, Nuremberg, Stuttgart and Rapperswil. At the latter Swiss town he stayed two months (July‚ÄìAugust), nursing his agoraphobia and spending much time with his friends, the promising young writer Stefan ≈ªeromski and his wife Oktawia. The couple sought Prus's help for the Polish National Museum, housed in the Rapperswil Castle, where ≈ªeromski was librarian. The final stage of Prus's journey took him to Paris, where he was prevented by his agoraphobia from crossing the Seine River to visit the city's southern Left Bank. He was nevertheless pleased to find that his descriptions of Paris in The Doll had been on the mark (he had based them mainly on French-language publications). From Paris, he hurried home to recuperate at Na≈Çƒôcz√≥w from his journey, the last that he made abroad. = Later years = Portrait by Antoni Kamie≈Ñski, 1897, celebrating Prus's 25 years as journalist and fiction writer Over the years, Prus lent his support to many charitable and social causes, but there was one event he came to rue for the broad criticism it brought him: his participation in welcoming Russia's tsar during Nicholas II's 1897 visit to Warsaw. As a rule, Prus did not affiliate himself with political parties, as this might compromise his journalistic objectivity. His associations, by design and temperament, were with individuals and select worthy causes rather than with large groups.Tokarz√≥wna, Krystyna; Stanis≈Çaw Fita; Zygmunt Szweykowski, ed.; Boles≈Çaw Prus, 1847‚Äì1912: Kalendarz ≈ºycia i tw√≥rczo≈õci (Boles≈Çaw Prus, 1847‚Äì1912: a Calendar of His Life and Work), 1969, passim. The disastrous January 1863 Uprising had persuaded Prus that society must advance through learning, work and commerce rather than through risky social upheavals. He departed from this stance, however, in 1905, when Imperial Russia experienced defeat in the Russo-Japanese War and Poles demanded autonomy and reforms. On 20 December 1905, in the first issue of a short-lived periodical, M≈Çodo≈õƒá (Youth), he published an article, \\"Oda do m≈Çodo≈õci\\" (\\"Ode to Youth\\"), whose title harked back to an 1820 poem by Adam Mickiewicz. Prus wrote, in reference to his earlier position on revolution and strikes: \\"with the greatest pleasure, I admit it‚ÄîI was wrong!\\" Prus's tomb at Warsaw's PowƒÖzki Cemetery, designed by his nephew, Stanis≈Çaw Jackowski In 1908, Prus serialized, in the Warsaw Tygodnik Ilustrowany (Illustrated Weekly), his novel Dzieci (Children), depicting the young revolutionaries, terrorists and anarchists of the day ‚Äî an uncharacteristically humorless work. Three years later a final novel, Przemiany (Changes), was to have been, like The Doll, a panorama of society and its vital concerns. However, in 1911 and 1912, the novel had barely begun serialization in the Illustrated Weekly when its composition was cut short by Prus's death. Neither of the two late novels, Children or Changes, is generally regarded as part of the essential Prus canon, and Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz has called Children one of Prus's weakest works. Prus's last novel to meet with popular acclaim was Pharaoh, completed in 1895. Depicting the demise of ancient Egypt's Twentieth Dynasty and New Kingdom three thousand years earlier, Pharaoh had also reflected Poland's loss of independence a century before in 1795‚Äîan independence whose post-World War I restoration Prus did not live to see. On 19 May 1912, in his Warsaw apartment at 12 Wolf Street (ulica Wilcza 12), near Triple Cross Square, his forty-year journalistic and literary career came to an end when the 64-year-old author died. The beloved agoraphobic writer was mourned by the nation that he had striven, as soldier, thinker, and writer, to rescue from oblivion. Thousands attended his 22 May 1912 funeral service at St. Alexander's Church on nearby Triple Cross Square (Plac Trzech Krzy≈ºy) and his interment at PowƒÖzki Cemetery. Prus's tomb was designed by his nephew, the noted sculptor Stanis≈Çaw Jackowski. On three sides it bears, respectively, the novelist's name, Aleksander G≈Çowacki, his years of birth and death, and his pen name, Boles≈Çaw Prus. On the fourth side is the Polish-language inscription \\"Serce serc\\" (\\"Heart of hearts\\"), rendered from the Latin \\"Cor cordium\\" that appears on the tomb of English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley in Rome's Protestant Cemetery. Below this inscription stands the figure of a little girl embracing the tomb ‚Äî a figure emblematic of Prus's well-known empathy and affection for children. Prus's widow, Oktawia G≈Çowacka, survived him by twenty-four years, dying on 25 October 1936.Monika PiƒÖtkowska, Prus: ≈öledztwo biograficzne (Prus: A Biographical Investigation), Krak√≥w, Wydawnictwo Znak, 2017, , p. 456.  Legacy  1982 plaque on Warsaw University's Kazimierz Palace, commemorating 1866‚Äì68 student Boles≈Çaw Prus On 3 December 1961, nearly half a century after Prus's death, a museum devoted to him was opened in the 18th-century Ma≈Çachowski Palace at Na≈Çƒôcz√≥w, near Lublin in eastern Poland. Outside the palace is a sculpture of Prus seated on a bench. Another statuary monument to Prus at Na≈Çƒôcz√≥w, sculpted by Alina ≈ölesi≈Ñska, was unveiled on 8 May 1966. It was at Na≈Çƒôcz√≥w that Prus vacationed for thirty years from 1882 until his death, and that he met the young Stefan ≈ªeromski. Prus stood witness at ≈ªeromski's 1892 wedding and generously helped foster the younger man's literary career.Pie≈õcikowski, Edward, Boles≈Çaw Prus, pp. 152, 156. While Prus espoused a positivist and realist outlook, much in his fiction shows qualities compatible with pre-1863-Uprising Polish Romantic literature. Indeed, he held the Polish Romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz in high regard. Prus's novels in turn, especially The Doll and Pharaoh, with their innovative composition techniques, blazed the way for the 20th-century Polish novel. Prus's novel The Doll, with its rich realistic detail and simple, functional language, was considered by Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz to be the great Polish novel. Joseph Conrad, during his 1914 visit to Poland just as World War I was breaking out, \\"delighted in his beloved Prus\\" and read everything by the ten- years-older, recently deceased author that he could get his hands on. He pronounced The New Woman (the first novel by Prus that he read) \\"better than Dickens\\"‚ÄîDickens being a favorite author of Conrad's. Mi≈Çosz, however, thought The New Woman \\"as a whole... an artistic failure...\\" Zygmunt Szweykowski similarly faulted The New Woman's loose, tangential construction; but this, in his view, was partly redeemed by Prus's humor and by some superb episodes, while \\"The tragedy of Mrs. Latter and the picture of [the town of] Iksin√≥w are among the peak achievements of [Polish] novel-writing.\\" Pharaoh, a study of political power, became the favorite novel of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, prefigured the fate of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, and continues to point analogies to more recent times. Pharaoh is often described as Prus's \\"best- composed novel\\"‚Äîindeed, \\"one of the best-composed [of all] Polish novels.\\" This was due in part to Pharaoh having been composed complete prior to newspaper serialization, rather than being written in installments just before printing, as was the case with Prus's earlier major novels.Pie≈õcikowski, Edward, Boles≈Çaw Prus, p. 157. The Doll and Pharaoh are available in English versions. The Doll has been translated into twenty-eight languages, and Pharaoh into twenty. In addition, The Doll has been filmed several times,including The Doll, directed by Wojciech Jerzy Has, 1968. and been produced as a 1977 television miniseries,Lalka, directed by Ryszard Ber, 1977. Pharaoh was adapted into a 1966 feature film. Pharaoh (Internet Movie Database). Between 1897 and 1899 Prus serialized in the Warsaw Daily Courier (Kurier Codzienny) a monograph on The Most General Life Ideals (Najog√≥lniejsze idea≈Çy ≈ºyciowe), which systematized ethical ideas that he had developed over his career regarding happiness, utility and perfection in the lives of individuals and societies.Zygmunt Szweykowski, Tw√≥rczo≈õƒá Boles≈Çawa Prusa (The Art of Boles≈Çaw Prus), pp. 295‚Äì97 and passim. In it he returned to the society-organizing (i.e., political) interests that had been frustrated during his Nowiny editorship fifteen years earlier. A book edition appeared in 1901 (2nd, revised edition, 1905). This work, rooted in Jeremy Bentham's Utilitarian philosophy and Herbert Spencer's view of society-as-organism, retains interest especially for philosophers and social scientists.Pie≈õcikowski, Edward, Boles≈Çaw Prus, pp. 138‚Äì39, 161, 163‚Äì64. Another of Prus's learned projects remained incomplete at his death. He had sought, over his writing career, to develop a coherent theory of literary composition. Notes of his from 1886 to 1912 were never put together into a finished book as he had intended. His precepts included the maxim, \\"Nouns, nouns and more nouns.\\" Some particularly intriguing fragments describe Prus's combinatorial calculations of the millions of potential \\"individual types\\" of human characters, given a stated number of \\"individual traits.\\" A curious comparative-literature aspect has been noted to Prus's career, which paralleled that of his American contemporary, Ambrose Bierce (1842‚Äì1914). Each was born and reared in a rural area and had a \\"Polish\\" connection (Bierce, born five years before Prus, was reared in Kosciusko County, Indiana, and attended high school at the county seat, Warsaw, Indiana). Each became a war casualty with combat head trauma‚ÄîPrus in 1863 in the Polish 1863‚Äì65 Uprising; Bierce in 1864 in the American Civil War. Each experienced false starts in other occupations, and at twenty-five became a journalist for the next forty years; failed to sustain a career as editor-in-chief; achieved celebrity as a short-story writer; lost a son in tragic circumstances (Prus, an adopted son; Bierce, both his sons); attained superb humorous effects by portraying human egoism (Prus especially in Pharaoh, Bierce in The Devil's Dictionary); was dogged from early adulthood by a health problem (Prus, agoraphobia; Bierce, asthma); and died within two years of the other (Prus in 1912; Bierce presumably in 1914). Prus, however, unlike Bierce, went on from short stories to write novels. Over twice-lifesize Prus statue on Warsaw's Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie 1936 plaque, Holy Cross Church, Warsaw, by Prus's nephew Stanis≈Çaw Jackowski \\"2012: Year of Prus\\": poster commemorating 100th anniversary of Prus's death, in a window of the Polish Academy of Sciences, Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie, Warsaw, 2012 In Prus's lifetime and since, his contributions to Polish literature and culture have been memorialized without regard to the nature of the political system prevailing at the time. His 50th birthday, in 1897, was marked by special newspaper issues celebrating his 25 years as a journalist and fiction writer, and a portrait of him was commissioned from artist Antoni Kamie≈Ñski. The town where Prus was born, Hrubiesz√≥w, near the present Polish‚ÄìUkrainian border, is graced by an outdoor sculpture of him. A 1982 plaque on Warsaw University's administration building, the historic Kazimierz Palace, commemorates Prus's years at the University in 1866‚Äì68. Across the street (Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie) from the University, in Holy Cross Church, a 1936 plaque by Prus's nephew Stanis≈Çaw Jackowski, featuring Prus's profile, is dedicated to the memory of the \\"great writer and teacher of the nation.\\" On the front of Warsaw's present-day ulica Wilcza 12, the site of Prus's last home, is a plaque commemorating the earlier, now-nonexistent building's most famous resident. A few hundred meters from there, ulica Boles≈Çawa Prusa (Boles≈Çaw Prus Street) debouches into the southeast corner of Warsaw's Triple Cross Square. In this square stands St. Alexander's Church, where Prus's funeral was held. In 1937, plaques were installed at Warsaw's Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie 4 and 7, where the two chief characters of Prus's novel The Doll, Stanis≈Çaw Wokulski and Ignacy Rzecki, respectively, were deduced to have resided. On the same street, in a park adjacent to the Hotel Bristol, near the site of a newspaper for which Prus wrote, stands a twice-life-size statue of Prus, sculpted in 1977 by Anna Kamie≈Ñska-≈Åapi≈Ñska; it is some 12 feet tall, on a minimal pedestal as befits an author who walked the same ground with his fellow men. Consonant with Prus's interest in commerce and technology, a Polish Ocean Lines freighter has been named for him. For 10 years, from 1975 to 1984, Poles honored Prus's memory with a 10-z≈Çoty coin featuring his profile. In 2012, to mark the 100th anniversary of his death, the Polish mint produced three coins with individual designs: in gold, silver, and an aluminum-zinc alloy. Prus's fiction and nonfiction writings continue relevant in our time.Witness articles such as Aleksander Kaczorowski, \\"My z Wokulskiego\\" (\\"We [Descendants] of Wokulski) [protagonist of Prus's novel The Doll]\\" in Plus Minus, the Rzeczpospolita (Republic) Weekly [Magazine], no. 33 (1016), Saturday-Sunday, 18‚Äì19 August 2012, pp. P8-P9.

The vast majority of the species are tropical, with only a few species extending into temperate climates.Govaerts, R., Wilkin, P. & Saunders, R.M.K. (2007). World Checklist of Dioscoreales.

Description  They are tuberous herbaceous perennial lianas, growing to or more tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, mostly broad heart- shaped. The flowers are individually inconspicuous, greenish-yellow, with six petals; they are mostly dioecious, with separate male and female plants, though a few species are monoecious, with male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit is a capsule in most species, a soft berry in a few species.  Cultivation and uses  Several species, known as yams, are important agricultural crops in tropical regions, grown for their large tubers. Many of these are toxic when fresh, but can be detoxified and eaten, and are particularly important in parts of Africa, Asia, and Oceania (see yam article). One class of toxins found in many species is steroidal saponins, which can be converted through a series of chemical reactions into steroid hormones for use in medicine and as contraceptives. The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia records that Dioscorea hastifolia is \\"One of the hardiest of the yams. The tubers are largely consumed by the local aborigines for food.

Early life Choi was born in Wonju, Gangwon Province when Korea was a part of the Empire of Japan. This area today is in South Korea. Political career Choi served as Ambassador to Malaysia from 1964 to 1967, foreign minister from 1967 to 1971; and as prime minister from 1975 to 1979. After the assassination of Park Chung-hee in 1979, Choi became acting president; the prime minister stood next in line for the presidency under Article 48 of the Yushin Constitution. Due to the unrest resulting from Park's authoritarian rule, Choi promised democratic elections, as under Park elections had been widely seen as rigged. Choi also promised a new constitution to replace the highly authoritarian Yushin Constitution. Choi was the sole candidate in an election on 6 December for the balance of Park's term, becoming the country's fourth president. Coup d'etat and forced resignation In December 1979, Major General Chun Doo-hwan and close allies within the military staged a coup d'√©tat against Choi's government. They quickly removed the army chief of staff and virtually controlled the government by early 1980. In April 1980, due to increasing pressure from Chun and other politicians, Choi appointed Chun head of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency. In May, Chun declared martial law and dropped all pretense of civilian government, becoming the de facto ruler of the country. By then, student protests were escalating in Seoul and Gwangju. The protests in Gwangju resulted in the Gwangju uprising in which about 987 civilians were killed within a five-day period by Chun's military. Choi was forced to resign soon after the uprising. Prime Minister Park Chung-hoon became acting president, until Chun's election as President on September 1, 1980. Later life After his resignation, Choi lived quietly out of the public eye and died on October 22, 2006. Choi was buried in Daejeon National Cemetery on October 26, 2006.

large stork found in the Americas from Mexico to Argentina, except west of the Andes. It sometimes wanders into the United States, usually in Texas, but has been reported as far north as Mississippi. It is most common in the Pantanal region of Brazil and the Eastern Chaco region of Paraguay. It is the only member of the genus Jabiru. The name comes from a Tupi‚ÄìGuaran√≠ language and means \\"swollen neck\\". Taxonomy Hinrich Lichtenstein described the jabiru in 1819. The name jabiru has also been used for two other birds of a distinct genus: black-necked stork (Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus), commonly called \\"jabiru\\" in Australia; and sometimes also for the saddle-billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis) of Sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, Gardiner's Egyptian hieroglyph G29, believed to depict an E. senegalensis, is sometimes labeled \\"jabiru\\" in hieroglyph lists. The Ephippiorhynchus are believed to be the jabiru's closest living cousins, indicating an Old World origin for the species.Hancock & Kushan, Storks, Ibises and Spoonbills of the World. Princeton University Press (1992), The proposed Late Pleistocene fossil stork genus Prociconia from Brazil might actually belong in Jabiru. A fossil species of jabiru was found in the early Pliocene Codore Formation near Urumaco, Venezuela. In Portuguese, the bird is called tuiuiu, tuim-de-papo-vermelho (\\"red-necked tuim\\", in Mato Grosso) and cauau√° (in the Amazon Basin). The name jabiru is used for the wood stork (Mycteria americana). Description Closeup of head The jabiru is the tallest flying bird found in South America and Central America, often standing nearly the same height as the flightless and thus much heavier American rhea. For the continent, it also has the second largest wingspan, after the Andean condor (that is, excluding the great albatross occasionally found off the coast of southern South America). The adult jabiru is long, across the wings, and can weigh . Sexual dimorphism is high, possibly the highest of any stork, with males being about 25% larger than females. Males weigh an average of whereas females weigh an average of .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, 2nd Edition by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (2008), . Large males may stand as tall as . The beak, which measures , is black and broad, slightly upturned, ending in a sharp point. Among other standard measurements, the tail measures , the tarsus measures long and the wing chord measures . The plumage is mostly white, but the head and upper neck are featherless and black, with a featherless red stretchable pouch at the base. The sexes are similar in appearance but the male is larger, which can be noticeable when the sexes are together. While it can give the impression of being an ungainly bird on the ground, the jabiru is a powerful and graceful flier. Life history In the Pantanal, Mato Grosso, Brazil =Food and feeding habits= The jabiru lives in large groups near rivers and ponds, and eats prodigious quantities of fish, molluscs, and amphibians. It will occasionally eat reptiles, bird eggs and small mammals. It will even eat fresh carrion and dead fish, such as those that die during dry spells, and thus help maintain the quality of isolated bodies of water. They feed in flocks and usually forage by wading in shallow water. Jabirus detect prey more through tactile sensation than vision. They feed by holding their open bill at a 45 degree angle to the water. When prey is contacted, the storks close their bill, draw it out of the water, and throw their head back to swallow.ADW- Jabiru mycteria- Information (2011). It is an opportunistic feeder. In one instance when house mice experienced a population explosion in an agricultural area, several hundred jabirus could be seen in each field feeding on the rodents (unusual for a bird that's rarely seen in large numbers anywhere). On rare occasions, jabirus have been seen attempting to kleptoparasitize the two smaller storks it co-exists with, the wood and maguari storks. =Breeding= The nest of sticks is built by both parents around August‚ÄìSeptember (in the Southern Hemisphere) on tall trees, and enlarged at each succeeding season growing to several meters in diameter. Nests are often deeper than they are wide, they can be up to wide and deep. Half a dozen nests may be built in close proximity, sometimes among nests of herons and other birds. The parents take turns incubating the clutch of two to five white eggs and are known to more territorial than usual against other jabirus during the brooding period. Raccoons and other storks (including their own species) are occasion predators of jabiru eggs, but most nest predators appear to avoid these huge-billed birds and there are no known predators of healthy adult jabirus. Although the young fledge around 110 days old, they often spend around another 3 months in the care of their parents. Because of this long length of time spent brooding, pairs have difficulty breeding in successive years. Less than half of active pairs in one season are active the next season. Only 25% of successful pairs are successful the next season. The lifespan average is 36 years. Conservation Jabiru are widespread but not abundant in any area. They are considered a species of least concern by the IUCN, an improvement from a status of near threatened in 1988. Jabiru gained protected status in Belize in 1973. Since then, their numbers in that area have slowly risen. They have been granted protected status by the U.S. Migratory Bird Act.

Hunter transitioned at 14 and lived her adult life as a woman. The District of Columbia was found responsible for her death, due to not delivering medical care, and for violations of the DC Human Rights Act during her treatment. Accident and death Hunter was in a road accident in 1995. Emergency medical technicians (EMTs) at the scene of the accident used derogatory epithets and withdrew medical care after cutting open Hunter's pants and discovering that she had a penis, and ER staff at DC General Hospital subsequently provided dilatory and inadequate care. Hunter died in hospital the same day. A civil suit was later successfully brought by Hunter's mother against the District of Columbia. Over 2,000 people attended her funeral.

In the end, none of the EMTs involved were ever disciplined. On December 11, 1998, a jury awarded Hunter's mother, Margie, $2,874,060 after finding the District of Columbia, through its employees in the DC Fire Department and doctors at DC General, liable under the DC Human Rights Act and for negligence and medical malpractice for causing Hunter's death. $600,000 was awarded for damages attributable to violations of the DC Human Rights Act associated with the withdrawal of medical care at the accident scene and openly denigrating Hunter with epithets, a further $1.5 million was awarded to her mother for Hunter's conscious pain and suffering and for economic loss from the wrongful death medical malpractice claim. Doctors at DC General failed to diagnose and treat Hunter who died of internal bleeding in the hospital emergency room. Evidence at the trial demonstrated that had Hunter been provided with a blood transfusion and referred to a surgeon, she would have had an 86% chance of surviving. In subsequent negotiations the case was settled for $1.75m.http://www.glaa.org/archive/2000/tyrasettlement0810.shtml Legacy Transgender Youth Resources and Advocacy (TYRA), was a program of the former Illinois Gender Advocates and Howard Brown Health Center, was a Chicago area transgender youth initiative named in the memory of Tyra Hunter.

On February 2 a group of roughly armed Red Guard members crossed the Finnish-Soviet border near Kuolaj√§rvi and Savukoski after disarming a company of the Finnish border guards. They advanced to a logging yard owned by Kemijoki Oy. They arrested the heads of the yard and confiscated the cashbox. The incident derives its name from the fact that the leader of the Red Guardists, Frans Myyryl√§inen, stood on a crate that had formerly contained pork when he delivered his speech called the 'Declaration of Battle of the Red Guerrilla Battalion of the North'. After the speech, 283 workers and members of their families joined the battalion and were armed and given money. The Battalion then made its way back to the border. On its way, it robbed a group of border guards and other workplaces. On February 7, the battalion, by that time about 240 men, crossed the border back to the Soviet Union. Information of the incident was received at Rovaniemi only on February 5, and the battalion managed to slip away before a group of the White Guard arrived.

Description These plants are annual or perennial herbs, with generally unbranched stems, some lacking leaves. Some members of this family lack chlorophyll and are mycotrophic (also called myco- heterotrophic). The family tends to be saprophytic and even the autotrophic species are all endomycorrhizal and probably at least hemisaprophytic. The family occurs worldwide, with a mostly tropic to subtropical distribution. A number of species are threatened. Taxonomy John Lindley described the family as Burmanniae, with the single genus Burmannia, in 1830. In 1998 the APG I system placed Burmanniaceae as one of five families in the order Dioscoreales, within the monocot clade. The APG II system of 2003, as a result of an extensive study by Caddick and colleagues (2002), using an analysis of three genes, rbcL, atpB and 18S rDNA, in addition to morphological criteria, led to a considerable rearrangement of the families within Dioscoreales. In APG II the circumscription of the family was wider and included the plants that belonged to the family Thismiaceae in APG I. The result was an order with only three families. APG III (2009) left this arrangement unchanged. Nevertheless, some ongoing research has challenged this relationship claiming that the older classification better reflects the evolutionary relationships between the genera. According to these researchers the constituent clades are as follows: Burmanniaceae sensu stricto *Apteria *Burmannia *Campylosiphon *Cymbocarpa *Dictyostega *Gymnosiphon *Hexapterella *Marthella *Mierisella Afrothismia clade *Afrothismia Tribe Thismieae * Haplothismia * Oxygyne * Thismia * Tiputinia But because of conflicting evidence, the APG IV (2016) authors felt it was still premature to propose a restructuring of the order since the most recent evidence upholds the APG configuration and the work of Caddick and colleagues. =Evolution= According to molecular analyses, the myco-heterotrophic type of life that these species lead evolved six (or even more) times independently in the three clades that are part of Burmanniaceae. Afrothismia and tribe Thismieae represent two of these shifts to myco- heterotrophy from autotrophy while Burmanniaceae sensu stricto are the clade where the other four took place. The family appears in the Late Cretaceous but the further diversification and shifts to the typical habit occurred later in the same period and continued after the K-T boundary in Paleogene.

It depicts a small plastic crucifix submerged in a small glass tank of the artist's urine. The piece was a winner of the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art's \\"Awards in the Visual Arts\\" competition, which was sponsored in part by the National Endowment for the Arts, a United States Government agency that offers support and funding for artistic projects. The work generated a large amount of controversy based on assertions that it was blasphemous. Serrano himself said of the controversy: \\"I had no idea Piss Christ would get the attention it did, since I meant neither blasphemy nor offense by it. I've been a Catholic all my life, so I am a follower of Christ.\\"  Description  The photograph is of a small plastic crucifix submerged in what appears to be a yellow liquid. The artist has described the substance as being his own urine in a glass. The photograph was one of a series of photographs that Serrano had made that involved classical statuettes submerged in various fluids‚Äîmilk, blood, and urine. It followed two years after Serrano's 1985 work, Blood Cross. The full title of the work is Immersion (Piss Christ). The photograph is a Cibachrome print. It is glossy and its colors are deeply saturated. The presentation is that of a golden, rosy medium including a constellation of tiny bubbles. Without Serrano specifying the substance to be urine and without the title referring to urine by another name, the viewer would not necessarily be able to differentiate between the stated medium of urine and a medium of similar appearance, such as amber or polyurethane. Serrano has not ascribed overtly political content to Piss Christ and related artworks, on the contrary stressing their ambiguity. He has also said that while this work is not intended to denounce religion, it alludes to a perceived commercializing or cheapening of Christian icons in contemporary culture. Subsequently, he has explicitly rejected the assertion that he was motivated by blasphemy, saying instead that it was intended as a serious work of Christian art. He said, \\"What it symbolizes is the way Christ died: the blood came out of him but so did the piss and the shit. Maybe if Piss Christ upsets you, it's because it gives some sense of what the crucifixion actually was like... I was born and raised a Catholic and I've been a Christian all my life.\\" The art critic Lucy R. Lippard has presented a constructive case for the formal value of Serrano's Piss Christ, which she characterizes as mysterious and beautiful. She writes that the work is \\"a darkly beautiful photographic image‚Ä¶ the small wood and plastic crucifix becomes virtually monumental as it floats, photographically enlarged, in a deep rosy glow that is both ominous and glorious.\\" Lippard suggests that the formal values of the image can be regarded separately from other meanings.  Reception  In 1987, Serrano's Piss Christ was exhibited at the Stux Gallery in New York and was favorably received. The piece later caused a scandal when it was exhibited in 1989, with detractors, including United States Senators Al D'Amato and Jesse Helms, outraged that Serrano received $15,000 for the work, and $5,000 in 1986 from the taxpayer-funded National Endowment for the Arts. Serrano received death threats and hate mail, and he lost grants due to the controversy. Others alleged that the government funding of Piss Christ violated the separation of church and state. The NEA's budget was cut. Sister Wendy Beckett, an art critic and Catholic nun, stated in a television interview with Bill Moyers that she regarded the work as not blasphemous but a statement on \\"this is what we are doing to Christ.\\" During a retrospective of Serrano's work at the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) in 1997, the then Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, George Pell, sought an injunction from the Supreme Court of Victoria to restrain the National Gallery of Victoria from publicly displaying Piss Christ, which was not granted. Some days later, one patron attempted to remove the work from the gallery wall, and two teenagers later attacked it with a hammer. Gallery officials reported receiving death threats in response to Piss Christ. NGV Director Timothy Potts cancelled the show, allegedly out of concern for a Rembrandt exhibition that was also on display at the time. Supporters argued that the controversy over Piss Christ is an issue of artistic freedom and freedom of speech. Piss Christ was included in \\"Down by Law\\", a \\"show within a show\\" on identity politics and disobedience that formed part of the 2006 Whitney Biennial. The British TV documentary Damned in the U.S.A., first shown by Channel 4 in its Without Walls arts series in 1991, explored the controversy surrounding Piss Christ, and interviewed Serrano about the work. On April 17, 2011, a print of Piss Christ was vandalized \\"beyond repair\\" by Christian protesters while on display during the Je crois aux miracles (I believe in miracles) exhibition at the Collection Lambert, a contemporary art museum in Avignon, France. Serrano's photo The Church was similarly vandalized in the attack. Beginning September 27, 2012, Piss Christ was on display at the Edward Tyler Nahem gallery in New York, at the Serrano show Body and Spirit. Religious groups and some lawmakers called for President Barack Obama to denounce the artwork, comparing it to the anti-Islamic film Innocence of Muslims that the White House had condemned earlier that month.

The species is endemic to Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay. Brown in color and covered with dark blotches, males grow to a total length (including tail) of 2‚Äì3 metres (6.6‚Äì9.8 ft) and females to 1.4 metres (4.6 ft). Typical habitats of this caiman include lakes, rivers, and wetlands. Its diet primarily consists of aquatic animals, such as snails, and occasionally land vertebrates. Mating occurs in the rainy season and eggs hatch in March, with young fending for themselves as soon as they hatch. The yacare caiman was hunted heavily for its skin to use for leather in the 1980s, which caused its population to decrease significantly. However, trading restrictions placed since have caused its population to increase. Its population in the Pantanal is about 10 million, and it is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. Taxonomy Fran√ßois Marie Daudin originally described the yacare caiman in 1802 as Crocodilus yacare. Its specific name, yacare, comes from the word jacar√©, which means \\"alligator\\" in Old Tupi and then transliterated to Portuguese. As of 2010, the exact relationship between the yacare caiman and related species is unclear and complicated. There have been attempts to analyze this relationship, but these have not produced definite conclusions. It is sometimes considered a subspecies of the spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus), which would make its scientific name Caiman crocodilus yacare. These two species are the same morphologically, but are considered separate species due to their geographical differences. Description C. yacare is a medium-sized caiman, brown in color. Male specimens grow to in total length (including tail) and in weight. Females are much smaller, with an adult total length of and weight of . The average snout‚Äìvent length (SVL) of hatchlings is for females and for males. National Geographic has described young individuals as \\"look(ing) like nothing more than tiny, windblown seeds floating amid the rushes at the edge of a lagoon in Brazil's remote interior.\\" Based on a study of the growth of multiple specimens in the Pantanal from 1987‚Äì2013, both sexes are about SVL at age five. By age 15, they have mostly finished growth, with females being about SVL and males over SVL. The study also showed that individuals have significant variation in their growth rates. Dark marks are distributed across the body; most noticeably, its lower jaw is covered with three to five blotches. It has a smooth snout, which is medium in length and broad. It has lumps on its eyelids and a curved ridge between its eyes. It has osteoderms on its scales, a feature also present in the spectacled caiman. It has an average of 74 teeth, with 5 pre-maxillary, 14‚Äì15 maxillary, and 17‚Äì21 mandibular. Some of the teeth on its lower jaw can poke through holes in its upper jaw. This feature makes its teeth more prominent and has been compared to piranhas, which has established the common name \\"piranha caiman\\".

It lives in semi-aquatic habitats, including lakes, rivers, and wetlands, but is able to adapt to a variety of habitats. Individuals sometimes move to different locations in groups if their habitat is disturbed. The species' diet consists of aquatic animals, such as snails and fish, and occasionally snakes. It has also been known to eat capybaras. When hunting for snails, this caiman looks within vegetation floating in water and uses its jaws to break the shells of the snails. In July 1986, the stomach of a specimen in Bolivia was observed to be full of mud, along with small parts of eggshells that likely belonged to a caiman. In general, crocodilians can eat the eggshells of their own young subsequent to the young hatching. Breeding usually occurs in December‚ÄìFebruary, in the middle of the rainy season. Nests are constructed by the females, built in a mound shape using mud and rotting vegetation. The species can lay as many as 44 eggs, but it most commonly lays 22‚Äì35, with the exact number often depending on the habitat type. It often exhibits multiple paternity, more so than several other crocodilian species. Females usually protect nests during incubation, but do so less when the human hunting pressure is high, ultimately causing a lower hatching success rate. Eggs hatch in March. Young exhibit precociality, receiving very little help from their parents and having to care for themselves. They hide in grasses in the daytime, as herons and storks can eat young caimans. Females become sexually mature at age 10‚Äì15. Similar species of the yacare caiman live to about age 50, which has been used as an estimate for this caiman's lifespan, but its exact lifespan is unknown.

It is one of three species of genus Caiman in South America, the others being the broad-snouted caiman (C. latirostris) and the spectacled caiman (C. crocodilus), with more easterly and northerly ranges, respectively. The yacare caiman is one of the most common species on its continent. In the 1980s, the species was \\"heading for oblivion\\" due to frequently being hunted for its skin; hunters often went to water holes containing many yacare caimans and shot large numbers of them. They utilized the skin for leather and left the other parts of the carcasses at the water holes. Although the species is covered with bony osteoderms, which had previously made it uncommon to be hunted for leather, it has some less bony spots which can be used for leather. This practice caused the caiman's population to drop by the millions. In 1992, a ban was issued in Brazil that prohibited the trading of crocodilian skins. This resulted in a significant increase in its population, with about 10 million specimens living in the Pantanal alone as of 2013. Current threats of the yacare caiman include deforestation, tourism, construction of dams and seaports, and illegal hunting. The species reproduces quickly, which makes it less susceptible to hunting pressure. The IUCN Red List designated the yacare caiman a species of least concern in 1996. It is listed as threatened by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as of June 5, 2000, after having been listed as endangered since June 2, 1970. As of 2010, it is listed as an Appendix II species by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. References Further reading *Daudin FM (1802).

By taking advantage of the driving forces of nature such as pressure, temperature and concentration gradients, as well as the law of conservation of mass, process engineers can develop methods to synthesize and purify large quantities of desired chemical products. Process engineering focuses on the design, operation, control, optimization and intensification of chemical, physical, and biological processes. Process engineering encompasses a vast range of industries, such as agriculture, automotive, biotechnical, chemical, food, material development, mining, nuclear, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and software development. The application of systematic computer-based methods to process engineering is \\"process systems engineering\\".  Overview  Process Engineering involves utilization of multiple tools and methods. Depending on the exact nature of the system, processes need to be simulated and modeled using mathematics and computer science. Processes where phase change and phase equilibria are relevant require analysis using the principles and laws of thermodynamics to quantify changes in energy and efficiency. In contrast, processes that focus on the flow of material and energy as they approach equilibria are best analyzed using the disciplines of fluid mechanics and transport phenomena. Disciplines within the field of mechanics need to be applied in the presence of fluids or porous and dispersed media. Materials engineering principles also need to be applied, when relevant. Manufacturing in the field of process engineering involves an implementation of process synthesis steps. Regardless of the exact tools required, process engineering is then formatted through the use of a process flow diagram (PFD) where material flow paths, storage equipment (such as tanks and silos), transformations (such as distillation columns, receiver/head tanks, mixing, separations, pumping, etc.) and flowrates are specified, as well as a list of all pipes and conveyors and their contents, material properties such as density, viscosity, particle-size distribution, flowrates, pressures, temperatures, and materials of construction for the piping and unit operations. The process flow diagram is then used to develop a piping and instrumentation diagram (P&ID;) which graphically displays the actual process occurring. P&ID; are meant to be more complex and specific than a PFD. They represent a less muddled approach to the design. The P&ID; is then used as a basis of design for developing the \\"system operation guide\\" or \\"functional design specification\\" which outlines the operation of the process. It guides the process through operation of machinery, safety in design, programming and effective communication between engineers. From the P&ID;, a proposed layout (general arrangement) of the process can be shown from an overhead view (plot plan) and a side view (elevation), and other engineering disciplines are involved such as civil engineers for site work (earth moving), foundation design, concrete slab design work, structural steel to support the equipment, etc. All previous work is directed toward defining the scope of the project, then developing a cost estimate to get the design installed, and a schedule to communicate the timing needs for engineering, procurement, fabrication, installation, commissioning, startup, and ongoing production of the process. Depending on needed accuracy of the cost estimate and schedule that is required, several iterations of designs are generally provided to customers or stakeholders who feed back their requirements. The process engineer incorporates these additional instructions (scope revisions) into the overall design and additional cost estimates, and schedules are developed for funding approval. Following funding approval, the project is executed via project management. Principal areas of focus in process engineering Process engineering activities can be divided into the following disciplines:Research Challenges in Process Systems Engineering by Ignacio E. Grossmann and Arthur W.

However, it wasn't till the advent of thermodynamics and the law of conservation of mass in the 1780s that process engineering was properly developed and implemented as its own discipline. The set of knowledge that is now known as process engineering was then forged out of trial and error throughout the industrial revolution. The term process, as it relates to industry and production, dates back to the 18th century. During this time period, demands for various products began to drastically increase, and process engineers were required to optimize the process in which these products were created. By 1980, the concept of process engineering emerged from the fact that chemical engineering techniques and practices were being used in a variety of industries. By this time, process engineering had been defined as \\"the set of knowledge necessary to design, analyze, develop, construct, and operate, in an optimal way, the processes in which the material changes\\". By the end of the 20th century, process engineering had expanded from chemical engineering-based technologies to other applications, including metallurgical engineering, agricultural engineering, and product engineering.

The band achieved commercial success in both Australia and the United States. They have sold more than 30 million records; six studio albums reached the top 10 on the Australian Kent Music Report albums chart including Diamantina Cocktail (April 1977) and First Under the Wire (July 1979), which both peaked at No. 2\\\\. Nine singles appeared in the top 20 on the related singles chart, with \\"Help Is on Its Way\\" (1977) as their only number-one hit. Ten singles reached the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 with \\"Reminiscing\\" their highest, peaking at No. 3\\\\. Only First Under the Wire appeared in the top 10 albums on the Billboard 200. Little River Band have received many music awards in Australia. The 1976 line-up of Beeb Birtles, David Briggs, Graeham Goble, Glenn Shorrock, George McArdle and Derek Pellicci, were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame at the 18th Annual ARIA Music Awards of 2004. Most of the group's 1970s and 1980s material was written by Goble and/or Shorrock, Birtles and Briggs. In May 2001 the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th anniversary celebrations, named \\"Cool Change\\", written by Shorrock, as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. \\"Reminiscing\\", written by Goble, received a 5-Million Broadcast Citation from BMI in 2020. The group have undergone numerous personnel changes, with over 30 members since their formation, including John Farnham as lead singer after Shorrock departed in 1982. None of the musicians now performing as Little River Band are original members, nor did they contribute to the success the band had in the 1970s. In the 1980s, members included Farnham, Wayne Nelson, Stephen Housden, David Hirschfelder and Steve Prestwich. As from October 2020 the line-up is Nelson, Rich Herring, Chris Marion, Ryan Ricks and Colin Whinnery ‚Äì none of whom are Australian. Various legal disputes over the band's name occurred in the 2000s between Housden vs Birtles, Goble and Shorrock. Two former members have died, Barry Sullivan in October 2003 (aged 57) and Steve Prestwich in January 2011 (aged 56). History =1975‚Äì1976: Early years= Little River Band formed in March 1975 in Melbourne as a harmony rock group with Beeb Birtles on guitar and vocals, Graham Davidge on lead guitar, Graeham Goble on guitar and vocals, Dave Orams on bass guitar, Derek Pellicci on drums and Glenn Shorrock on lead vocals. Upon formation they were an Australian super group, with Birtles, Goble, Pellicci and Shorrock each from prominent local bands. Birtles had been the bass guitarist and vocalist in the pop-rock band Zoot (which launched the career of singer-guitarist Rick Springfield) from 1967 to 1971. Goble had led Adelaide-formed folk rock group Allison Gros in 1970. They relocated to Melbourne and in 1972 were renamed as Mississippi, a harmony country rock band, where late that year Birtles joined on guitar and vocals and Pellicci on drums. They had chart success in Australia and built up a following on the concert and festival circuit. During 1971 to 1972 the original members of Mississippi had also recorded as a studio band under the pseudonym Drummond. They achieved a number-one hit, for eight consecutive weeks, on the Go-Set National Top 40 with a novelty cover version of the Rays' song \\"Daddy Cool\\". Shorrock had been the lead singer of a pop band, the Twilights (1964‚Äì69), and a country rock group, Axiom from 1969 to 1971 (alongside singer-songwriter Brian Cadd). Both Axiom and Mississippi had relocated to the United Kingdom to try to break into the local record market, but without success. Axiom disbanded after moving to the UK, and Shorrock sang for a more progressive rock outfit, Esperanto in 1973. He also provided backing vocals for Cliff Richard. In late 1974 Birtles, Goble, Pellicci and Shorrock met with talent manager Glenn Wheatley (former bass player of the Masters Apprentices) in London. With Wheatley as manager, they agreed to reconvene in Melbourne in early 1975. Due to the indifferent reception they had each received in the UK, they decided their new band would establish itself in the United States. Wheatley's first-hand experiences of the rip-offs in the 1960s music scene, combined with working in music management in the UK and the US in the early 1970s, allowed him to help the Little River Band become the first Australian group to enjoy consistent commercial and chart success in the US. Little River, on a trip by the fledgling band from Melbourne to Geelong, inspired Glenn Shorrock to suggest the band name After their return to Australia, the members began rehearsing in February 1975, still using the name of Mississippi. On 20 March 1975 they played their first official gig at Martini's Hotel in Carlton. In Birtles' autobiography, Every Day of My Life, he explains how the band came to change its name: Little River Band (as Mississippi) had recorded their first track, a cover version of the Everly Brothers' song \\"When Will I Be Loved\\", in February 1975, at Armstrong Studios. However, Linda Ronstadt's version appeared in the following month, so LRB did not release theirs. Before the group performed, Davidge was replaced by Ric Formosa on guitar, and Orams by Roger McLachlan on bass guitar and backing vocals (ex-Levi Smith's Clefs). Phil Manning (ex-Chain) was LRB's first choice for lead guitar. Manning was busy with his solo career and recommended Formosa. The latter had travelled to Australia from Canada and was working in a music store; he joined soon after. In May 1975 they signed with EMI Records and started recording their debut self-titled album (November 1975) at Armstrong Studios in the following month. The album was co-produced by Birtles, Goble, Shorrock and Wheatley. Tony Catterall of The Canberra Times described it in November as \\"one of those flawed creations that inevitably draws a more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger response.\\" Bruce Eder of AllMusic observed, \\"[it's] an astonishingly strong debut album.\\" Little River Band peaked at No. 17 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart. Their debut single, \\"Curiosity (Killed the Cat)\\", had appeared in September, reaching No. 15 on the related Kent Music Report Singles Chart. Two more singles followed, \\"Emma\\" (January 1976) and \\"It's a Long Way There\\" (November 1976). Wheatley travelled to Los Angeles in December 1975 and touted the group to various record companies until Rupert Perry of Capitol Records signed them on Christmas Eve. Little River Band issued their second Australian album, After Hours, in May 1976 on EMI. It was produced by the band but was not issued in the US until 1980. After Hours peaked at No. 5 and provided the single \\"Everyday of My Life\\", in May, which reached the top 30. =1976‚Äì1982: Success and changes of personnel= During August 1976 both Formosa and McLachlan were replaced. David Briggs joined on guitar (ex-Cycle, the Avengers, Ram Band) and George McArdle on bass guitar (also ex-Ram Band). Formosa according to Wheatley, was not enthusiastic about touring outside of Australia, He left to work as a session musician and as a composer and arranger. The group decided to replace McLachlan, who also became a sessions player and joined the country rock group Stars in 1976. Australian music journalist Ed Nimmervoll listed the classic line-up of the band as Birtles, Briggs, Goble, Pellici, McArdle and Shorrock. Formosa still worked with LRB by arranging and wroting string parts for several tracks on subsequent albums. Encouraged by their Australian success, they undertook their first international tour. They flew to the UK on 17 September 1976 to play a show in London's Hyde Park supporting Queen. They then opened shows in the rest of Europe for the Hollies during September and October. Birtles advised fellow Australian bands to establish themselves in Australia first before trying the UK market. In October they performed their first US concert, at James Madison University (then called Madison College) in Harrisonburg, Virginia, as the opening act for Average White Band. Due to US appearances and support from FM stations, \\"It's a Long Way There\\" reached no. 28 on the Billboard Hot 100. Little River Band performing in 1977 (left to right): Briggs, McArdle, Shorrock, Pellicci, Birtles and Goble. Little River Band's second Australian album, After Hours, had been passed over in the US by Capitol. The label selected tracks from it and their third Australian one, Diamantina Cocktail (April 1977), to create Capitol's second US album, also titled Diamantina Cocktail (June 1977). The Australian version was co-produced by the group with John Boylan ‚Äì who stayed on to co-produce their next two studio albums. Due to tension between band members Birtles, Goble and Shorrock recorded as much of their parts individually as was feasible. The Canberra Times Julie Meldrum caught their local performance in May 1977 and described the band as \\"tightly disciplined\\" and \\"there was nothing that was not world class.\\" She reviewed the album, which had no Australian references and felt they were aiming at the US east coast scene with influences from David Crosby, Graham Nash and Little Feat apparent. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented on the US release, \\"laidback, sweet country-rock, [it] has a similar sound to the band's debut, but the melodies are a little sharper and catchier, making [it] a better, more fully-rounded collection.\\" In Australia, Diamantina Cocktail became their highest charting album, peaking at No. 2; while the US version reached the top 50 on the Billboard 200. In January 1978 it was certified gold by RIAA for sales of 500,000 copies: the first Australian band to do so. The lead single, \\"Help Is on Its Way\\" reached No. 1 in Australia. Both it and the fourth single, \\"Happy Anniversary\\", peaked in the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. During 1977 they consistently toured , mostly in the US, headlining in smaller venues and appearing in stadiums on multi-billed shows supporting the Doobie Brothers, Supertramp and America. In August they co-headlined day two of the Reading Music Festival in the UK alongside Thin Lizzy. In November they supported Fleetwood Mac and Santana at Rockarena concerts in Sydney and Melbourne. Their fourth studio album, Sleeper Catcher (May 1978), peaked at No. 4 in Australia and No. 16 in the US. By May in the following year, it was certified platinum by RIAA for sales of 1,000,000 copies: the first Australian recorded album to achieve that feat. AllMusic's Mike DeGagne praised Shorrock's vocals, which give it \\"the perfect MOR sound, draping the tracks with his cool, breezy style that is much more apparent and effectual here than on the band's earlier efforts.\\" Sleeper Catcher provided four singles with \\"Shut Down Turn Off\\" (April 1978) their highest charting in Australia at No. 16. However in the US the highest charting was \\"Reminiscing\\" (June 1978), which peaked at No. 3. The album's last single, \\"Lady\\" (December 1978), reached No. 10 in the US in early 1979. Pellicci was hospitalised in May 1978 with severe burns due to methylated spirits igniting on a barbecue. Geoff Cox (ex-Brian Cadd, Bootleg Family Band, Avalanche) substituted on drums, rather than cancelling their next US tour. They supported Boz Scaggs, Jimmy Buffett and the Eagles. Cox remained played alongside Pellicci, when he joined the tour in August 1978; they supported the Eagles at C.N.E. Stadium in Toronto. Cox left once Pellicci had recoved. Mal Logan (ex-the Dingoes, Ren√©e Geyer Band) joined on keyboards for another US tour which from late December 1978. Logan stayed on as a touring member until the end of 1981. Nimmervoll observed that by February 1978, \\"frictions inside the band continued to brew, relieved a little by\\" side projects. Birtles & Goble showcased tracks rejected for LRB. They issued three singles, \\"Lonely Lives\\" (March 1978), \\"I'm Coming Home\\" (March 1979) and \\"How I Feel Tonight\\" (June 1980) and an album, The Last Romance (May 1980). \\"I'm Coming Home\\" reached No. 8 in Australia. Shorrock's solo single was a cover version of Bobby Darin's \\"Dream Lover\\" (April 1979), which peaked in the Australian top 10. First Under the Wire was issued as LRB's fifth studio album in July 1979, which reached No. 2 in Australia ‚Äì equalling Diamantina Cocktail. It was also their highest charting album on the Billboard 200 at No. 10. In November it was certified by RIAA as a platinum album. AllMusic's Mark Allan described their \\"mix of harmony-drenched pop tunes and unthreatening rockers\\" which had a wide appeal. Both singles, \\"Lonesome Loser\\" (July 1979) and \\"Cool Change\\" (October 1979), peaked in the US top 10. Briggs wrote \\"Lonesome Loser\\" and Shorrock wrote \\"Cool Change\\". McArdle left in late January 1979 to become a Christian minister. In July of that year Barry Sullivan (ex-Chain, Ren√©e Geyer Band) took over on bass guitar. He was replaced, in turn, by Wayne Nelson (ex-Jim Messina Band) in April 1980. The group's two 1980 Australian live albums, Backstage Pass and Live in America, were released in the US as a double set, also titled, Backstage Pass. Goble was the producer for Australian pop singer John Farnham's solo album, Uncovered (September 1980). Goble wrote or co-wrote nine of its ten tracks and provided vocals. The album had other LRB alumni: Briggs, Formosa, Logan, Nelson, Pellicci and Sullivan. Farnham had signed with Wheatley's management company. The line-up of Birtles, Briggs, Goble, Nelson, Pellicci and Shorrock recorded LRB's sixth studio album, Time Exposure (August 1981), in Montserrat with George Martin (the Beatles) producing. The Canberra Times Garry Raffaele felt \\"it's easy listening, no demands, easing up, slowing down, getting older.\\" By the time it appeared, Stephen Housden (ex-Stevie Wright Band, the Imports) replaced Briggs on lead guitar. The album reached No .9 in Australia and No. 21 in the US; and in November it was certified gold by RIAA. In August Nelson provided lead vocals for its lead single, \\"The Night Owls\\", which peaked at No. 18 in Australia and No. 6 in the US. Raffaele described the track as \\"the punchiest thing LRB has done for some time but it's still middle-of-the-road pap, hummable.\\" Nelson also shared vocal duties with Shorrock on the second single, \\"Take It Easy on Me\\" (November 1981). According to Nimmervoll, Nelson's presence added the conflict between band members and that Goble \\"agitated within the band to replace [Shorrock] with [Farnham].\\" =1982‚Äì1987: John Farnham years= In February 1982, Shorrock left Little River Band and resumed his solo career but did not achieve chart success in the US. Farnham replaced Shorrock on lead vocals and \\"Man on Your Mind\\", the third single from Time Exposure (with Shorrock's vocals), reached No. 14 in the US. Birtles described the removal of Briggs and Shorrock: > I remember a couple of embarrassing moments in the studio where [Briggs] was > quite rude to [Martin], insisting that his way was better and that he didn't > need to be told how or what to play. After our return from recording in > Montserrat, during a meeting at [Wheatley]'s house, [Goble] was quite vocal > about [Briggs'] conduct. He confronted [him] and virtually fired him ... > After [Shorrock] took his frustration out on me one day during a rehearsal > ... I said I couldn't work with [him] any more. [Goble], who had always been > at opposite poles to Shorrock, agreed with me and Wheatley started freaking > out saying he thought it was a big mistake... in hindsight, I believe he was > right on the money and to me this would be the mistake that cut Little River > Band's throat. In September 1982 Farnham told Susan Moore of The Australian Women's Weekly, how easy it was to fit into the group although both recording and stage work had differed. On covering early LRB repertoire he said, \\"We've had to change the key with a lot of things because Glenn sang in a different register from me.\\" The first single with Farnham as lead vocalist, \\"The Other Guy\\" was released in November 1982, which reached No. 18 in Australia and No. 11 in the US. Another single, \\"Down on the Border\\", peaked at No. 7 in Australia. Their next single, \\"We Two\\", from their seventh studio album, The Net (May 1983), reached No. 22 in the US. It had been co-produced by the group and Ern Rose (Mississippi, R√©nee Geyer, Stars). DeGagne reviewed the album, which \\"failed to capture the same success they experienced with Shorrock at the helm. The same type of soft rock fluidity and laid-back charm has been replaced with a sound that seems forced and somewhat strained.\\" In 1983, \\"You're Driving Me Out of My Mind\\" became the group's last single to reach the US Top 40. The band moved towards a 1980s style of sound and added a keyboardist, David Hirschfelder (ex-Peter Cupples Band, who had guested on The Net and at some LRB shows), in September 1983. The pressures of success and constant touring took their toll on the band as line-up changes continued. Birtles left in October 1983 because he did not like the harder, more progressive musical path which Goble was taking and because he had preferred Shorrock's vocals. Birtles contributed to soundtracks for feature films, From Something Great (1985) and Boulevard of Broken Dreams (1988). He also worked as a session musician, eventually relocating to the US and releasing a solo album, Driven by Dreams, in 2000. Pellicci left in February 1984 for similar reasons and Steve Prestwich (ex-Cold Chisel) replaced him on drums. Pellicci also became a session musician: including working for Brian Cadd. Their eighth studio album, Playing to Win, was released in January 1985, which delivered a harder sound with producer Spencer Proffer. The change in sound, along with the unofficial shortening of their name to LRB, confused fans and radio programmers. Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane felt it was \\"a strong album but it failed to halt the band's slide in popularity.\\" It reached No. 38 in Australia and No. 75 on the US charts. It is the group's last charting album on the Billboard 200. The title track made No. 59 on the Australian singles chart, No. 15 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart and No. 60 on Hot 100. The second single, \\"Blind Eyes\\", failed to enter the charts. In July 1985 LRB performed on the Oz for Africa benefit concert (part of the global Live Aid program): \\"Don't Blame Me\\", \\"Full Circle\\", \\"Night Owls\\", and \\"Playing to Win\\". They were broadcast in Australia (on both Seven Network and Nine Network) and on MTV in the US. ABC broadcast \\"Don't Blame Me\\" and \\"Night Owls\\" during their Live Aid telecast (\\"Night Owls\\" was only partially transmitted). Farnham left the group following the completion of their short Australian tour in April 1986, which had Malcolm Wakeford drumming in Prestwich's place. Their ninth studio album, No Reins, recorded when Farnham was still aboard, appeared in the next month and was produced by Richard Dodd. It reached the Kent Music Report top 100. Farnham explained to Pollyanna Sutton of The Canberra Times why he left, \\"[On the stage] I was up front and had to be the most liked. There was a lot of pressure because it wasn't, perhaps, working as it should, although there were other contributing things like the membership changes and perhaps the material.\\" Nimmervoll described the Farnham years, \\"The experiment had never worked. Whatever [Farnham]'s talents, America longed for [Shorrock]. At the end of 1985, while LRB was seriously contemplating its future, Farnham took the initiative to start work on another solo album.\\" Farnham continued to be managed by Wheatley ‚Äì who left LRB in 1987 ‚Äì and his solo career took off with his next album, Whispering Jack (October 1986). Hirschfelder, McLachlan, Nelson and Pellicci contributed to the album or the related tour. =1987‚Äì1998: Shorrock's return= After Farnham's departure Little River Band were in limbo until 1987 when Pellicci and Shorrock returned at the request of Irving Azoff, the head of MCA Records, who wanted the band on his label. The line-up of Goble, Housden, Nelson, Pellicci and Shorrock established a holding company, We Two Pty. Ltd, with all members as directors in equal share. Goble and Wheatley signed away rights to the band's name to the new company. In July 1988 Pellicci described the group's previous two albums: \\"It was an overstatement to say the response to No Reins and Playing to Win was lukewarm ‚Äî there was no response at all.\\" The revamped group with keyboardist James Roche ( James Stewart Paddle Roche or Jamie Paddle) performed at the opening of World Expo 88 in Brisbane on 30 April. They were joined by the Eagles' Glenn Frey, who also accompanied them that year on tour. The group released their tenth studio album, Monsoon, in June 1988, which peaked at No. 9 on the Kent Music Report and at No. 13 on the ARIA Albums Chart in Australia. It was co-produced by Boylan and Goble. The Canberra Times Lisa Wallace was disappointed by its lack of innovation despite showing technical skills. Its lead single, \\"Love Is a Bridge\\", co-written by Goble and Housden was released in May and peaked at No. 7 on the Kent Music Report and at No. 11 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It was their second highest charting single in the Australian market, and a moderate Adult Contemporary radio hit in the US. In 1989 the group recorded \\"Listen to Your Heart\\", written by Tom Kelly and Billy Steinberg, for the film soundtrack, The Karate Kid Part III. The eleventh studio album, Get Lucky (February 1990), their last charting one in Australia, made the top 60. Mike Boehm of Los Angeles Times caught their gig in May, where \\"[Shorrock] was stiff and seemed stuck for words between songs. But he knew what to do when the music started, singing in a comfortably husky voice that resembled Phil Collins in tone and easy pop appeal. [Nelson], the group's Californian, generated more heat in his two lead vocal turns. The three-part harmonies behind Shorrock were exemplary, although the Crosby, Stills & Nash parallels were unmistakable. Lead guitarist [Housden] reinforced the emphasis on melody with his clean, lyrical lines.\\" MCA released a compilation album, Worldwide Love, of tracks from the previous two LPs on their Curb Records imprint in June 1991. Both Get Lucky and Worldwide Love peaked in the top 40 on the Swiss Hitparade; with the latter also appearing on the √ñ3 Austria Top 40. Goble had ceased touring with the group in 1989 and left altogether by 1992, as well as resigning from We Two. Peter Beckett (ex-Player) joined in 1989 to take Goble's place. The group went through a series of keyboard players, including Tony Sciuto (1990‚Äì1992, 1993‚Äì1997) and Richard Bryant (1992‚Äì1993, ex-Doobie Brothers). In September 1992 Nelson's daughter was killed in a traffic collision in San Diego, while he was on tour with the band in Europe. Nelson immediately returned home and Hal Tupaea substituted on bass guitar for the New Zealand dates of the band's tour in November 1993. Little River Band subsequently took a break until Nelson's return in 1994 and embarked on a four-and-a-half month 20th Anniversary US tour in 1995. Shorrock left again in 1996: he was offered the option to buy out the remaining members of We Two Pty. Ltd. He took a one-third share of the monetary value of the company as he did not want to commit to the band's US touring schedule. Shorrock was replaced on lead vocals by Melbourne singer Steve Wade (ex- Dolphin Street). Nelson also left in 1996 and Tupaea returned on bass guitar. This line-up lasted until late 1997, when everyone, except Wade, started to leave, including Pellicci, who left again early in the following year. The departure of all original directors left Housden as the sole owner of We Two Pty. Ltd and the Little River Band's name and trademarks. =1998‚Äìpresent: Recent years= LRB performing at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Hollywood in October 2006 In 1998 Housden re-established Little River Band with contracted members: Wade was joined by Paul Gildea on vocals and guitars; Kevin Murphy on vocals, drums and percussion; and Adrian Scott on vocals and keyboards (ex-Air Supply) and McLachlan, who returned after 22 years, on bass guitar. McLachlan's second tenure was short lived; both he and Scott departed after a year. Nelson returned early in the following year and Glenn Reither joined on keyboards, saxophone and backing vocals. Gildea and Wade left early in 2000 with Australian Greg Hind joining on vocals and guitars and Nelson taking over as lead singer. The line-up of Hind, Housden, Nelson, Murphy and Reither recorded two studio albums, Where We Started From (November 2000) and Test of Time (June 2004). In March 2002 Birtles Shorrock Goble (BSG) were formed in Melbourne as a soft rock trio, initially billed as \\"The Original Little River Band\\" or \\"The Voices of Little River Band\\". Wheatley returned as their manager. They undertook a series of concerts performing LRB's earlier material. In June of that year a legal dispute, We Two Pty Ltd v Shorrock (2002) over the use of the name \\"Little River Band\\" reached the Federal Court of Australia. Housden's company We Two Pty Ltd lodged an action against Birtles, Goble and Shorrock seeking to stop BSG from using the LRB trademarks, logos or band name. Housden provided documentation showing the assignment of those trademarks to We Two, registered by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in 1989, and Birtles' transfer of ownership of the url \\"littleriverband.com\\" to We Two in 2000. The parties settled out of court on 13 June 2002 where We Two had ownership of the Little River Band name, trademarks and logos and that Birtles, Goble and Shorrock could reference their past history in advertising separate to BSG's name but only in a descriptive manner. On 12 July of that year Birtles, Goble and Shorrock were directed to pay half of We Two's taxed costs. A further legal case in late July 2005 was also settled out of court, which allowed the trio to advertise their Little River Band connection but not to perform under that name. The three former members shared their frustration at the situation via song with Goble's \\"Someone's Taken Our History\\", Birtles' \\"Revolving Door\\" and Shorrock's \\"Hear My Voice\\". At the end of 2004 Murphy and Reither left LRB and Chris Marion joined on keyboards, while Kip Raines briefly took on drumming duties until replaced by Billy Thomas in early 2005. Housden left touring with the band in 2006, but still participated in their recordings and management. Rich Herring took over lead guitar on tour and Mel Watts replaced Thomas, who had suffered a shoulder injury, on drums in 2007. Ryan Ricks replaced Watts in 2012. Lehigh Valley Music page's reviewer John Moser saw their performance in early 2013 he perceived that they largely played material form before 1985 and were unable to deliver improvements on the originals. In August LRB released an album Cuts Like a Diamond on the Frontiers Records, a majority of which was written by other musicians. Little River Band were scheduled to appear on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in January 2015, to promote the group's 40th anniversary. It was cancelled after complaints from early members over advertising that LRB would perform \\"Reminiscing\\". Permission for the use of any songs written by Birtles, Briggs, Goble or Shorrock was refused. Shorrock expressed his concerns over LRB's misrepresentations, \\"They are promoting a newly recorded album of their own material, or whatever material they have got. They should do that rather than pretend they are the band that sold 30 million albums.\\" In March 2015 the group's appearance in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, was cancelled after the venue received a cease and desist order from the early members regarding the use of their recordings in advertising and the demands by LRB members to be paid in full before performing. The venue described the latter demand as \\"not only unreasonable, but uncustomary.\\" Rahni Sadler of TV show Sunday Night investigated the band name controversy. She asked Housden to display the document, which showed the transfer of ownership but he had not located it. Wheatley claimed that he could not remember signing it when it appeared in the court case. Shorrock offered to make peace with Housden and perform together. Housden told Sadler that he would not allow the original members to work as Little River Band \\"in this lifetime\\". Nelson and Housden also acknowledged that the later version of the band would not be successful without the songs of the founders. In September 2015 Little River Band received Casino Musical Entertainer of the Year at the Annual G2E Awards ceremony at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas. As of 2017 LRB continue to tour, mostly in the US, performing more than 80 concerts annually, re-recording earlier material. The band's press releases recount the original members' achievements and awards as if they were their own. When asked about LRB's Hits Revisited album, Birtles disparaged it, \\"That to me is the comedy album ... They re-arranged all the songs and it's bloody awful. They're nothing more than a tribute band.\\" Also in 2017 Little River Band blocked Australia from its official website. They cited Russia and Africa as also being blocked for \\"different reasons\\". Australian access to the band's Facebook page was also blocked. On 13 November 2017 Birtles was interviewed on Australian talk show Studio 10 and confirmed that the founders would not reunite, \\"Once [BSG] folded we all realised it wasn't going to go any further than that. It's unfortunate how we lost the name and everything, but if its ruled in the court that way all you can do is walk away from it.\\" In February 2018 Herring was interviewed on Everyone Loves Guitar and disclosed \\"We actually re-recorded all the hits and I'll say without any shame that I tried to make it sound as close to the originals as possible by bringing in background singers that actually sounded like those guys did 30-40 years ago. I'm pretty proud of it.\\" Nashville musician Colin Whinnery was recruited to replace Hind on vocals and guitar in 2018, consequently there are no Australians in Little River Band. On 25 June 2019 The New York Times Magazine listed Little River Band among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. In May 2020 the largest online museum devoted to an Australian band, the original members of Little River Band was launched. To celebrate its launch Goble released his solo catalogue and unheard demos from 1976 to 1987, all songs that he wrote whilst in Little River Band. From May 2020 major music and streaming platforms such as iTunes recognise the original Little River Band as a separate entity to the latterday band. On 18 September 2020 Birtles, Briggs, Shorrock and Goble participated in a videoconference where they discussed the formation and early history of the band. Legacy Former members of Little River Band performing at their induction into the ARIA Hall of Fame, 17 October 2004 The Little River Band are considered to be among Australia's most significant bands. As of September 2004 they have sold more than 30 million records and scored 13 US Top 40 hits. In May 2001 the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th anniversary celebrations, named \\"Cool Change\\" as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. At that ceremony Goble and Shorrock reconnected after ten years; they proposed a reunion with Birtles to perform their earlier material, which became the trio Birtles Shorrock Goble. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2004, Little River Band were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame. The presentation acknowledged the band's three decade career and thirteen official members and was accepted by the 1976 to 1978 line-up of Birtles, Briggs, Goble, Pellicci, McArdle and Shorrock. They were referred to as \\"The Classic Line-up of the Little River Band\\". They performed \\"Help Is on Its Way\\" at the ceremony on 17 October 2004. Shorrock had previously been inducted in 1991 for his work with the Twilights, Axiom and his solo career. Farnham, who had been inducted in 2003 for his solo work, was not inducted in 2004 with Little River Band. However, Farnham's contribution to LRB was acknowledged by Goble in his acceptance speech. The 2018 version of Little River Band claims the band's Hall of Fame induction, amongst other past achievements, on its website. With more than five million plays, \\"Reminiscing\\", written by Goble, was recognised by BMI as one of the most frequently played songs in the history of US radio, the highest achievement of any Australian pop song internationally. According to Albert Goldman's biography, John Lennon named \\"Reminiscing\\" as one of his favourite songs. May Pang, Lennon's erstwhile girlfriend, said they considered \\"Reminiscing\\" as \\"our song\\". \\"Lady\\" has accumulated more than three million plays. LRB were mentioned in the 2010 film The Other Guys, when the character portrayed by Will Ferrell played \\"Reminiscing\\" while driving. The character portrayed by Mark Wahlberg threw the CD out the window, but Ferrell's character played it again later on and said that he always had six identical LRB CDs in his car. In Sea Stories: My Life in Special Operations (2019), Admiral William H. McRaven wrote that he would sing \\"Happy Anniversary\\" before every jump. Shorrock was appointed an Honorary Member of the Order of Australia (AM) on 26 January 2020, awarded for significant service to the performing arts as a singer, songwriter and entertainer. In March he was due to perform at the Little River Country Fair, the town after which LRB were named. Shorrock wanted to celebrate the 45th Anniversary of the group's first show. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the performance was postponed. In September Goble was acknowledged for achieving 12 million plays of his songs on US commercial radio by BMI after receiving his fifth such Million-Air Award, with the latest for \\"The Night Owls\\" (see their BMI Awards).

The New York Times (August 6, 2007). Martin Cruz Smith's Arkady Renko series: A trail of clues to the Russian soulWroe, Nicholas, The Guardian (March 26, 2005). Crime Pays Set in the Soviet Union during the Cold War, Gorky Park is the first book in a series featuring the character Arkady Renko, a Moscow homicide investigator. Two subsequent books, Polar Star and Red Square, are also set during the Soviet era. Five further books take place after the fall of the Soviet Union. These are Havana Bay, set in communist Cuba; Wolves Eat Dogs, which follows Renko in the disaster of Chernobyl; Stalin's Ghost in which Arkady returns to a Russia led by Vladimir Putin, Three Stations and Tatiana.See, Carolyn, Washington Post (September 3, 2010). \\"Three Stations,\\" the new thriller by Martin Cruz Smith, author of \\"Gorky Park\\" Gorky Park was a major best-seller, vaulting Smith to fame after a decade as a moderately successful professional author. The novel was adapted into a successful 1983 film of the same name. Plot The story follows Arkady Renko, a chief investigator for the Moscow militsiya, who is assigned to a case involving three corpses found in Gorky Park, an amusement park in Moscow. The victims - two men and a woman - were shot, and have had their faces and fingertips cut off by the murderer to prevent identification. Ice skates found on the woman's body lead Arkady to Irina Asanova, a wardrobe girl at a movie studio, who claims that she reported them stolen, and has no idea how they ended up with the victims. However, Arkady tentatively identifies the three bodies as known associates of Irina: her friend Valerya Davidova, Valerya's boyfriend Kostia Borodin, and an American expatriate student named James Kirwill. Arkady gives the woman's skull to Professor Andreev, an anthropologist at Moscow University, who specializes in reconstructing whole faces from bone structure. At a bathhouse, Arkady's superior, Chief Prosecutor Iamskoy, introduces Arkady to an American fur millionaire, John Osborne, who regularly visits Russia. When Arkady begins to suspect a connection between Osborne and the murders, he is warned by his associate, Mendel, a junior official in the Soviet Trade Ministry, that Osborne is an informant for the KGB, and thus regarded as a \\"friend\\" by all of Arkady's superiors. Arkady's problems escalate when his partner is shot to death investigating Davidova's apartment, and Kirwill's elder brother William, a detective with the New York City Police Department who speaks fluent Russian, arrives in Moscow intending to find and kill his brother's murderer. Arkady tries to discover as much as he can from Kirwill to confirm the corpse's identity, without admitting that he suspects Osborne. When Irina is attacked on the Moscow underground, Arkady hides her in his own apartment, vacant since his wife, Zoya, left him for one of her colleagues at the school where she teaches. Arkady reluctantly pays a visit to his father, retired Red Army General Renko, a.k.a. \\"Stalin's Favorite General\\", a.k.a. \\"The Butcher of Ukraine\\". The elder Renko remembers that Osborne was an O.S.S. officer attached to the Red Army during the Nazi invasion, tasked with interrogating three captured S.S. officers. Thanks to his charm and fluent German, Osborne got the information he needed from the officers over a friendly picnic in the countryside, then shot all three of them dead - almost exactly the manner in which the three bodies in Gorky Park were killed. Arkady and Irina become lovers after admitting their mutual attraction, but Arkady is convinced that she knows about Osborne's connection with the three victims, except she believes that Osborne has helped Valerya and Kostia to defect to America, with their friend Kirwill, a radical anti- Soviet, hoping to claim a publicity victory for having facilitated their escape. To convince Irina that Valerya is dead, Arkady sets up a situation in which he is going to show her Professor Andreev's reconstruction, even though by this point the reconstruction has been destroyed by Renko's higher-ups. The ruse works, and she admits that her friend is dead rather than have to look at the reconstructed head. Despite being born into the nomenklatura himself, Arkady exposes corruption and dishonesty on the part of influential and well- protected members of the elite, regardless of the consequences. This rebounds on him when his own superior, Iamskoy, and his best friend, a lawyer named Misha, are both revealed to be working with Osborne. Arkady flees a meeting with Misha before a gang of killers arrive, but is too late to prevent Iamskoy from appropriating the reconstructed head and destroying it. Arkady confronts Osborne at gunpoint as he is about to leave the country, but Osborne informs him that Iamskoy has already kidnapped Irina, and if Arkady lets Osborne go and rushes to the university campus, he might be just in time to save her. Arkady does so, killing Iamskoy and Osborne's chief henchman, but suffering a near fatal stomach wound. He recuperates in the custody of the State, being regularly interrogated by the KGB and watched over by his old antagonist, KGB Major Pribluda. In spite of his weakened state, Arkady laughs when he realizes from his interrogators' questions that Iamskoy was himself a high-ranking KGB officer, planted as a spy in the militsiya, and his superiors were badly embarrassed to find that he betrayed them to help Osborne. Months later, Arkady is brought before a KGB General who confirms what Arkady already suspected: that Kostia Borodin (an expert hunter) and Valerya helped Osborne to trap and smuggle live sables - the only high-quality fur-bearing animal on which the Soviet Union enjoys a monopoly - out of Russia. They believed Osborne would help them defect in exchange, but instead he killed them. Now, after several months of negotiations, Osborne has agreed to return the sables in exchange for Arkady being released and brought to America. Arkady's brief trip to New York City reunites him with Osborne, Irina, and Kirwill in succession. Arkady is outraged when Osborne tells him that he and Irina are lovers, but Irina swears that she only slept with Osborne twice - once to convince him to help her defect, and once more to convince him to bring Arkady to America. FBI agents escort Arkady and Irina to Osborne's ranch on Staten Island where the exchange is supposed to take place. During the trip Arkady realizes that, to avoid a diplomatic incident, the FBI agents plan to let Osborne kill him and Irina before allowing KGB agents, who are tailing them, to kill Osborne. When they arrive at the ranch the group finds Kirwill, shot and disemboweled. He finally identified Osborne as his brother's killer, but was overcome by Osborne's attack dogs when he came to confront him. Osborne appears, armed with a hunting rifle, and Arkady convinces him that the FBI is planning a betrayal. Osborne shoots two of the FBI agents as two KGB agents arrive, and the KGB and FBI agents are killed in the chaotic firefight that ensues. Osborne finally corners and wounds Arkady in the sable pens. Arkady gains the upper hand by releasing several of the sables, causing Osborne to rush recklessly into the pen where Arkady is able to shoot and kill him. Irina arrives and says that she wants to stay in America, but Arkady, finding America to be as corrupt as the Soviet Union, chooses to return to the latter; he also knows that if he does return home, the Soviet authorities will be less inclined to demand Irina's return. Realizing that the only way to reduce his superiors' ire is to kill all the illicit sables, Arkady picks up Osborne's hunting rifle, but instead he decides to break open their cages and release them into the forest. Pathoheterodoxy Syndrome Pathoheterodoxy Syndrome is a fictional mental illness. It is the idea of a misguided arrogance. The syndrome was said to be contracted by Chief Investigator Renko, who was thus described by a KGB agent: =Ideas and influences= Smith satirically created the concept of \\"Pathoheterodoxy\\" to show the way that the Soviet Union would have characterised Soviet dissidents and their failure to obey and conform. While the syndrome itself is fictional, the incident also alludes to the very real Soviet practice of diagnosing dissidents with \\" sluggish schizophrenia\\", and of forcibly treating them with psychotropic drugs. Renko's love interest, Irina, was likewise revealed to have been institutionalized for similarly false \\"psychiatric problems\\" and forcibly treated at some earlier time, resulting in a tumor that left her with a severe facial blemish and blind in one eye. Film Adaptation In 1983 a film adaptation of the novel was released starring William Hurt as Arkady, Joanna Pacula as Irina, Lee Marvin as Osborne and Brian Dennehy as Kirwill.

Discovery, in the law of common law jurisdictions, is a pre-trial procedure in a lawsuit in which each party, through the law of civil procedure, can obtain evidence from the other party or parties by means of discovery devices such as interrogatories, requests for production of documents, requests for admissions and depositions. Discovery can be obtained from non-parties using subpoenas. When a discovery request is objected to, the requesting party may seek the assistance of the court by filing a motion to compel discovery. History Discovery evolved out of a unique feature of early equitable pleading procedure before the English Court of Chancery: among various requirements, a plaintiff's bill in equity was required to plead \\"positions.\\" These were statements of evidence that the plaintiff assumed to exist in support of his pleading and which he believed lay within the knowledge of the defendant. They strongly resembled modern requests for admissions, in that the defendant was required to plead only whether they were true or false. At some point between the reign of Elizabeth I (1558-1603) and the late seventeenth century, positions were gradually replaced by interrogatories‚Äîwritten questions which the defendant was required to truthfully respond to under oath in his answer to the bill based on information within his own personal knowledge as well as documents in his possession. But back then, interrogatories could only elicit admissible evidence (not the broader modern standard of \\"reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence\\") and could only request evidence in support of the plaintiff's case, not either side's case (that is, they could not ask for evidence which the defendant intended to use in support of his defenses and was otherwise entirely irrelevant to the plaintiff's case). Even worse, this was purely a one-way procedure, because interrogatories could only be pleaded as part of a bill (a pleading initiating a suit in equity). A defendant who needed to obtain evidence in support of his defenses had to file a cross-bill against the plaintiff to plead his own interrogatories. Available through HeinOnline. Discovery did not exist at common law, but its availability in equity attracted litigants in actions at law (legal proceedings in the common law courts). They began to file bills in equity to obtain discovery in aid of actions at law. This led to another innovation in the mid-15th century: the bill to perpetuate testimony of a potential witness. This was for witnesses whose advanced age or poor health implied they would not survive to testify at the trial of an action at law. In this type of proceeding, the parties merely pleaded written interrogatories which a master (in or near London) or a lay commissioner (outside of London) would read out loud to the witness in a closed proceeding without parties or counsel present. The witness's oral answers were written down by the master or lay commissioner in summary form as if they had been delivered as a single continuous narrative (rather than as responses to discrete questions); the actual sequence of questions and answers was not transcribed verbatim like a modern deposition. The resulting document was then sealed and not revealed or \\"published\\" (in the terminology of the time) to parties or counsel until shortly before the trial in which it was to be used. This procedure for ex parte out-of-court pretrial examinations came to be called a \\"deposition.\\" It continued to be used as an evidence preservation device in aid of actions at law, but it also became the standard method for developing the factual record to be used in courts of equity as derived from the knowledge of third-party witnesses (not merely those who were old or dying). The master or commissioner necessarily performed a limited factfinding function when summarizing testimony in narrative form to be relied upon by the Lord Chancellor in lieu of live testimony in open court. As implied by the secret nature of the proceedings and the absence of parties and counsel, equity's factfinding process was fundamentally inquisitorial (i.e., driven by the court), and not adversarial (i.e., driven by the parties). It is generally believed that this came about because the early Chancellors and the masters who assisted them were clerics with training in Roman and canon law, and therefore had some knowledge of the inquisitorial system as it functioned in ecclesiastical courts. The secrecy of the proceedings was thought to be absolutely essential to prevent perjury and witness tampering; the witnesses would thereby be forced to testify from memory alone, and the parties could not use the facts disclosed in testimony to guide their discovery or litigation strategy. Consistent with this inquisitorial view, there were also prohibitions on repeat testimony and on additional testimony after publication. Rather, the witnesses would testify independently of each other before publication, then at the moment of publication, all would be revealed, and the parties would make their arguments to the Chancellor on that cold record. It is this procedure to which the United States Congress was referring in an 1802 law providing that \\"in all suits in equity, it shall be in the discretion of the court, upon the request of either party, to order the testimony of the witnesses therein to be taken by depositions.\\" The next major development (which would remain a unique feature of American and Canadian discovery) occurred under the supervision of Chancellor James Kent of the New York Court of Chancery during the early 19th century. He was trying to respond to the obvious defect of traditional depositions: since parties could not adjust their questions on the fly, they had to propound broadly drawn interrogatories, and in turn elicited \\"long and complicated accounts\\" of the facts that were difficult for masters to summarize in writing. Therefore, Kent allowed New York masters to actively engage in oral examination of witnesses (in the sense of formulating questions in real time and narrowing their scope based on the witnesses' answers), and he also allowed parties and counsel to be present when such examinations were conducted. Kent's innovations spread into American federal practice in 1842 when the U.S. Supreme Court amended the Federal Equity Rules to allow masters in equity suits in federal courts to conduct oral examinations of witnesses. However, with the parties and counsel now present to help guide the course of the master's oral examination of the witness, it was inevitable that counsel would insist on taking over the examination itself. Also, their presence meant the proceedings were no longer secret. Major reforms enacted in New York in the late 1840s and in England in the early 1850s laid the foundation for the rise of modern discovery by imposing a clear separation between pleadings and discovery as distinct phases of procedural law. Discovery devices could now be invoked independently of the pleadings. The New York reforms went much farther, by directly merging common law and equity procedure (which would also happen in England in the early 1870s), and by expressly authorizing pretrial oral examinations of both opposing parties and third-party witnesses, the basis of the modern deposition. (Up to that point, discovery from able-bodied opposing parties was still limited to interrogatories.) In fact, the New York code of civil procedure (brought about by David Dudley Field II) went so far as to abolish written interrogatories. A major flaw, though, of the New York code of civil procedure was that it only allowed parties to seek discovery on issues on which they would have the burden of proof at trial. This caused lawyers for defendants to plead fictional defenses in answers, because they still could not directly pursue discovery into the plaintiff's claims. In 1861, Rule 67 of the Federal Equity Rules was amended to make deposition by oral examination the regular method of taking evidence in equity in federal courts; taking witness testimony by written interrogatories was now the exception. Although depositions were still taken in front of court-appointed examiners, their role had been reduced to the preparation of summary narratives to be relied upon as evidence by the court. In 1892, Rule 67 was again amended to require the preparation of an exact transcript. Subsequent amendments in 1893 and 1912 eliminated the deposition's traditional role as an equitable factfinding device by first allowing and then requiring oral testimony in open court in trials of federal suits in equity, thereby reducing the deposition to its modern role in American civil procedure as a discovery and evidence preservation device. In 1938, the promulgation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) (pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act) created for the first time a comprehensive discovery system in U.S. federal courts. The FRCP authorized broad discovery into \\"any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter in the pending action, whether relating to the claim or defense of\\" either party. Due to the influence of progressive law professor Edson R. Sunderland, an enthusiastic proponent of broad discovery, the FRCP expressly authorized the complete family of discovery methods familiar to American litigators today. What made the FRCP so revolutionary was that although many state governments had regularly allowed one or more methods of discovery, no one state nor the federal government had ever attempted to allow litigators to use all of them, as Sunderland frankly admitted to the Advisory Committee that drafted the FRCP. As a result, the United States has the broadest discovery system in the world. After this system weathered blistering criticism for many decades (as separately summarized below), the United States retreated somewhat from broad discovery by expressly incorporating a proportionality requirement into the scope of discovery in the version of the FRCP that went into effect on December 1, 2015.  Electronic discovery  Electronic discovery, also known as ediscovery, involves the discovery of electronic data and records. It is important that data obtained through ediscovery be reliable, and therefore admissible.Steel, C (2006). Windows forensics: The field guide for conducting corporate computer investigations. Indianapolis, IN: Wiley Publishing. Currently the two main approaches for identifying responsive material on custodian machines are: (1) where physical access to the organisations network is possible - agents are installed on each custodian machine which push large amounts of data for indexing across the network to one or more servers that have to be attached to the network or (2) for instances where it is impossible or impractical to attend the physical location of the custodian system - storage devices are attached to custodian machines (or company servers) and then each collection instance is manually deployed. In relation to the first approach there are several issues: * In a typical collection process large volumes of data are transmitted across the network for indexing and this impacts normal business operations * The indexing process is not 100% reliable in finding responsive material * IT administrators are generally unhappy with the installation of agents on custodian machines * The number of concurrent custodian machines that can be processed is severely limited due to the network bandwidth required New technology is able to address problems created by the first approach by running an application entirely in memory on each custodian machine and only pushing responsive data across the network. This process has been patented and embodied in a tool that has been the subject of a conference paper. In relation to the second approach, despite self-collection being a hot topic in eDiscovery, concerns are being addressed by limiting the involvement of the custodian to simply plugging in a device and running an application to create an encrypted container of responsive documents. United States Under the law of the United States, civil discovery is wide-ranging and may seek disclosure of information that is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. This is a much broader standard than relevance, because it contemplates the exploration of evidence which might be relevant, rather than evidence which is truly relevant. (Issues of the scope of relevance are taken care of before trial with motions in limine and during trial with objections.) Certain types of information are generally protected from discovery; these include information which is privileged and the work product of the opposing party. Other types of information may be protected, depending on the type of case and the status of the party. For instance, juvenile criminal records are generally not discoverable, peer review findings by hospitals in medical negligence cases are generally not discoverable and, depending on the case, other types of evidence may be non-discoverable for reasons of privacy, difficulty or expense in complying and for other reasons. (Criminal discovery rules may differ from those discussed here.) Electronic discovery or \\"e-discovery\\" refers to discovery of information stored in electronic format (often referred to as Electronically Stored Information, or ESI). In practice, most civil cases in the United States are settled after discovery. After discovery, both sides often are in agreement about the relative strength and weaknesses of each side's case and this often results in either a settlement or summary judgment, which eliminates the expense and risks of a trial. Discovery is also available in criminal cases. Under the rule set forth in Brady v. Maryland, the prosecutor is obligated to provide to the defendant any information that is exculpatory or potentially exculpatory, without any request by the defense. Further discovery is available if initiated by the defendant. For example, a discovery demand might be for production of the names of witnesses, witness statements, information about evidence, a request for opportunity to inspect tangible evidence, and for any reports prepared by expert witnesses who will testify at trial.See, e.g., If a defendant in a criminal case requests discovery from the prosecution, the prosecutor may request reciprocal discovery. The prosecutor's right to discovery is deemed reciprocal as it arises from the defendant's request for discovery. The prosecutor's ability to obtain discovery is limited by the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights, specifically the defendant's constitutional protection against self-incrimination. =Federal law= Discovery in the United States is unique compared to other common law countries. In the United States, discovery is mostly performed by the litigating parties themselves, with relatively minimal judicial oversight. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure guide discovery in the U.S. federal court system. Most state courts follow a similar version based upon the FRCP, Chapter V \\"Depositions & Discovery\\" . According to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the plaintiff must initiate a conference between the parties after the complaint was served to the defendants, to plan for the discovery process. The parties should attempt to agree on the proposed discovery schedule, and submit a proposed Discovery Plan to the court within 14 days after the conference. After that, the main discovery process begins which includes: initial disclosures, depositions, interrogatories, request for admissions (RFA) and request for production of documents (RFP). In most federal district courts, the formal requests for interrogatories, request for admissions and request for production are exchanged between the parties and not filed with the court. Parties, however, can file motion to compel discovery if responses are not received within the FRCP time limit. Parties can file a motion for a protective order if the discovery requests become unduly burdensome or for purpose of harassment. In federal criminal prosecutions, discovery rights originate from a number of important Supreme Court decisions and statutes, the most important of which are, *Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), which requires a prosecuting attorney to disclose to a defendant any material which is potentially exculpatory or that would impeach the credibility of a prosecution witness. Brady also applies to evidence that would mitigate the defendant's sentence if a defendant is convicted. *Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657 (1957), and the Jencks Act, which requires federal prosecutors to produce any witness statement in the government's possession that relates to the subject of the witness' testimony, if that witness will testify against the defendant. *Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972) and the resulting Giglio rule, which requires that any deal with a witness that might call the witness's credibility into question must be disclosed in court. As a consequence, any plea bargain or deal made by the prosecutor with a witness in exchange for testimony should be disclosed to the defense as part of the discovery process. The formal discovery process for federal criminal prosecutions is outlined in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 16. District of Columbia The District of Columbia follows the federal rules, with a few exceptions. Some deadlines are different, and litigants may only resort to the D.C. Superior Court. Forty interrogatories, including parts and sub-parts, may be propounded by one party on any other party. There is no requirement for a \\"privilege log\\": federal Rule 26(b)(5) was not adopted by the D.C. Superior Court. Where above is stated \\"litigants may only resort to the D.C. Superior Court\\" upon correction is found according to the District of Columbia Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure Section 73(b)Judicial Review and Appeal which states: \\"Judicial review of a final order or judgment entered upon direction of a hearing commissioner is available on motion of a party to the Superior Court judge designated by the Chief Judge to conduct such reviews...After that review has been completed, appeal may be taken to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.\\" This rule basically implies that in a civil action, if a hearing commissioner is authorized by all parties to conduct the proceedings instead of a judge, upon a request for a review or appeal, the motion must first be reviewed by a Superior Court judge to the same standard as a motion for appeal on a Superior Court Judge to the Court of Appeals, but the right to appeal to the higher courts still remains. =State law= Many states have adopted discovery procedures based on the federal system; some closely adhere to the federal model, others not so closely. Some states take an entirely different approach to discovery. Many states have adopted the Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act to provide uniform process when discovery is to be done out of state.  Alaska In Alaska criminal courts, discovery is governed by Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 (Cr.R.16). The scope of discovery is broad and includes much more than is required by Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). The discovery process is intended to provide adequate information for informed pleas, to expedite trial, minimize surprise, afford an opportunity for effective cross- examination, and meet the requirements of due process. To the extent possible, discovery prior to trial should be as full and free as possible, consistent with protection of persons, effective law enforcement, and the adversarial system. A prosecuting attorney is required to disclose to the accused the following material, and to make it available for inspection and copying: (i) names and addresses of witnesses, (ii) written or recorded statements of the accused, (iii) written or recorded statements of a co-defendant, (iv) any books, papers, documents, photographs or tangible objects with the prosecutor intends to use at trial, (v) any prior criminal convictions of the defendant or any witness. In practice, this means that criminal defendants in Alaska are able to review any police report, lab report, audio/video recordings, witness statements, and more, before they proceed to trial. Most defendants will also have this material far enough in advance to have reviewed it before making a decision about any possible plea deal.  California In California state courts, discovery is governed by the Civil Discovery Act of 1986 (Title 4 (Sections 2016-2036) of the Code of Civil Procedure), as subsequently amended. A significant number of appellate court decisions have interpreted and construed the provisions of the Act. California written discovery generally consists of four methods: Request for Production of Documents, Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Admissions.Cal. Code Civ. Proc., ¬ß 2019.010 Responses to California discovery requests are not continuing: the responding party only needs to respond with the facts as known on the date of the response, and is under no obligation to update its responses as new facts become known.Singer v. Sup. Ct., 54 Cal.2d 318, 325 (1960). This causes many parties to reserve one or two interrogatories until the closing days of discovery, when they ask if any of the previous responses to discovery have changed, and then ask what the changes are. California depositions are not limited to one day, and objections must be made in detail or they are permanently waived. A party may only propound thirty-five written special interrogatories on any other single party unless the propounding party submits a \\"declaration of necessity\\". No \\"subparts, or a compound, conjunctive, or disjunctive question\\" may be included in an interrogatory.Cal. Code Civ. Proc., ¬ß 2030.060 However, \\"form interrogatories\\" which have been approved by the state Judicial CouncilSee e.g., do not count toward this limit. In addition, no \\"preface or instruction\\" may be included in the interrogatories unless it has been approved by the Judicial Council; in practice, this means that the only instructions permissible with interrogatories are the ones provided with the form interrogatories. =Criticism= The use of discovery has been criticized as favoring the wealthier side in a lawsuit, by enabling parties to drain each other's financial resources in a war of attrition. For example, one can make information requests that are potentially expensive and time-consuming for the other side to fulfill; respond to a discovery request with thousands of documents of questionable relevance to the case; file requests for protective orders to prevent the deposition of key witnesses; and take other measures that increase the difficulty and cost of discovery. In 1983, the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules attached a Committee Note to Rule 26 of the FRCP that cautioned federal courts to \\"prevent use of discovery to wage a war of attrition or as a device to coerce a party, whether financially weak or affluent,\\" then had to repeat and stress that exact same text in the 2015 Committee Note. It has been argued that although the goal of discovery is to level the playing field between the parties, the discovery rules instead create a multi-level playing field that favors the party that is in control of the information needed by the other party.Cameron Stracher, Double Billing: A Young Lawyer's Tale of Greed, Sex, Lies, and the Pursuit of a Swivel Chair (New York: William Morrow, 1998), 125‚Äì126. Instead of encouraging discovery, the rules are described as encouraging lawyers to find new ways to manipulate and distort or conceal information. Some tort reform supporters make a similar accusation, that discovery is used by plaintiffs' lawyers to impose costs on defendants in order to force settlements in unmeritorious cases to avoid the cost of discovery. However, others argue that discovery abuse is an exaggerated concept, that discovery works well in most cases, and exaggeration of American litigiousness and its cost result in confusion within the justice system. As implemented in 1938, the modern American discovery scheme granted powers directly to private parties and their counsel which are \\"functionally equivalent\\" to the power to issue self-executing administrative subpoenas. This is why civil law countries strongly dislike and oppose American discovery: they regard broad discovery in the hands of private parties as destructive of the rule of law because from their perspective, the result amounts to \\"a private inquisition.\\" Civil law countries see the underlying objectives of discovery as properly monopolized by the state in order to maintain the rule of law: the investigative objective of discovery is the prerogative of the executive branch, and insofar as discovery may be able to facilitate the creation of new rights, that is the prerogative of the legislative branch. In England and Wales The discovery process in the jurisdiction of England and Wales has been known as \\"disclosure\\" since the reforms to civil procedure introduced by Lord Justice Woolf in 1999. Disclosure is for many types of cause of action (but not for example Personal Injury which has its own additional Parts of procedure rules to follow) governed by Part 31 of the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR), and its linked Practice Direction (PD) 31B. As in the United States, certain documents are privileged, such as letters between solicitors and experts. The usual forms of discovery are general discovery and specific discovery since parties in issue are unlikely to reach agreements as to what ought to be disclosed. This reflects in the current discovery rules which put emphasis on compliance of time limit, rules on service, proper list of documents and rules on privileges set out in Part 31 of CPR and PD 31B. Once a party properly conducts general discovery process in accordance with discovery rules and procedures, documents are deem discoverable, i.e. documents are available for inspection. Inspectionability refers to procedural and legal elements: the former concerns clerical production of document; the latter concerns the relevance test (Peruvian Guano v Financiaso Compagneiage (1881) 10 EWR 125) and linkage test.

The work contains Newcomb's mathematical development of the position of the Earth in the Solar System, which is constructed from classical celestial mechanics as well as centuries of astronomical measurements. The bulk of the work, however, is a collection of tabulated precomputed values that provide the position of the sun at any point in time. Newcomb's Tables were the basis for practically all ephemerides of the Sun published from 1900 through 1983, including the annual almanacs of the U.S. Naval Observatory and the Royal Greenwich Observatory. The physical tables themselves were used by the ephemerides from 1900 to 1959, computerized versions were used from 1960 to 1980, and evaluations of the Newcomb's theories were used from 1981 to 1983. (1992: p. 317) The tables are seldom used now; since the Astronomical Almanac for 1984 they have been superseded by more accurate numerically-integrated ephemerides developed at Jet Propulsion Laboratory, based on much more accurate observations than were available to Newcomb. Also, the tables did not account for the effects of general relativity which was unknown at the time. Nevertheless, his tabulated values remain accurate to within a few seconds of arc to this day.

Smith is best known for his novels featuring Russian investigator Arkady Renko whom Smith introduced in Gorky Park (1981). The novel, which was called the \\"first thriller of the '80s\\" by Time, became a bestseller and won a Gold Dagger Award from the British Crime Writers' Association. Renko has since appeared in eight other novels by Smith. Gorky Park debuted at No. 2 on the \\"New York Times\\" bestseller list on April 26, 1981 and hung onto the top spot for another week. It stayed in the No. 2 position for over three months, beaten only by James Clavell's Noble House. It stayed in the top 15 through November of that year. Polar Star also claimed the No. 1 spot for two weeks on August 6, 1989. It subsequently held the No. 2 spot for over two months. During the 1990s, Smith twice won the Dashiell Hammett Award from the North American Branch of the International Association of Crime Writers. The first time was for Rose in 1996; the second time was for Havana Bay in 1999. And on September 5, 2010, he and Arkady Renko returned to the top of the New York Times bestseller list when Three Stations debuted at No. 7 on the fiction bestsellers list. His most recent novel featuring Renko is \\"The Siberian Dilemma\\" (2019). =Pseudonym= He originally wrote under the name \\"Martin Smith\\", only to discover there were other writers with the same name. His agent asked Smith to add a third name and Smith chose Cruz, his paternal grandmother's surname. Personal life Smith lives in San Rafael, California, with his family.

It is basically a round shaft pointed on one end, with a lateral groove behind it. The point eases the insertion of the hook through the material being crocheted and the groove makes it possible to pull a loop back through the material. The shaft is then divided into a working area that determines the hook's nominal diameter and ensures the uniform sizing of the loops formed on it, and a handle. Construction Crochet appeared as a distinct textile art during the early 19th century, and many crochet hooks survive from that period. These can be sorted into two groups, the one with thin steel hooks that are set into separate handles, and the other including single-piece hooks made in a variety of materials. The distinction between steel and other hooks persists to the present day, although all are now commonly of single-piece construction. A variety of coverings may be applied to the handle for ergonomic reasons. Ornate handles have been made for their decorative value, throughout. Crochet hooks are currently produced in diameters ranging from 0.35 mm to 25 mm. These diameters are indicated both directly in millimeters and by various numerical or literal gauge systems. Hooks under 2.0 mm are made of steel (for its strength) and are alternately termed steel-, lace- or thread hooks. Hooks of 2.00 mm or larger diameter are called yarn hooks or regular hooks. Aluminum is the predominant material from 2.0 mm to 6.0 mm (for its lighter weight). Beyond that, bamboo, wood, and plastic are the more common materials (for their even lighter weight). The indicated size boundaries between the types are, however, approximate. With the exception of the thinnest hooks, which are invariably made of steel, other materials may be encountered outside the indicated ranges. Historical materials for handles and some one-piece hooks include bone, porcupine quill, celluloid, agate, ivory, and fossilized mammoth ivory.Donna Kooler, Donna Kooler's Encyclopedia of Crochet, Leisure Arts, Inc., Little Rock, Arkansas, 2011, p. 13. Longer hooks are used for Tunisian crochet to accommodate the lengthy rows of open loops characterizing that style. A form with hooks at both ends is also used for Tunisian and other types of crochet that cannot be made with the standard hook, such as cro- hooking. Hook Sizes Please refer to List of United States standard crochet hook and knitting needle sizes for a comparison chart of crochet hook sizes. Types *A Knook is a type of crochet hook whose one end is a crochet hook and the other end has an eye-hole for threading yarn. Use The two basic ways of holding a crochet hook are: * the pencil grip, with the hook going over the crotch of the thumb, resembling a pencil, * the knife grip, with the hook under the palm of the hand, resembling a knife held when held overhand. These grips are functionally equivalent and selected as a matter of personal preference, with hybrid forms being commonplace. Other applications Crochet hooks can be used in many instances where it is necessary to pull a string through a hole. For example, many knitters use them to fix dropped knitting stitches, and tailors may use a crochet hook to thread a drawstring through its casing. Their use is not limited to fiber arts; crochet hooks can be used to maintain dreadlocks by pulling stray hairs back into the main dread.

The assassination of Prime Minister Luis Carrero Blanco, also known by its code name Operaci√≥n Ogro () had far-reaching consequences within the politics of Spain. Admiral Carrero Blanco was killed in Madrid by the Basque separatist group ETA on 20 December 1973. The assassination is considered to have been the biggest attack against the Francoist State since the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1939. The death of Carrero Blanco had numerous political implications. By the end of 1973, the physical health of dictator Francisco Franco had declined significantly, and it epitomized the final crisis of the Francoist regime. After his death, the most conservative sector of the Francoist State, known as the b√∫nker, wanted to influence Franco so that he would choose an ultraconservative as Prime Minister. Finally, he chose Carlos Arias Navarro, who originally announced a partial relaxation of the most rigid aspects of the Francoist State, but quickly retreated under pressure from the b√∫nker. ETA, on the other hand, consolidated its place as a relevant armed group and would evolve to become one of the main opponents of Francoism. The attack An ETA commando unit using the code name Txikia (after the nom de guerre of ETA activist Eustakio Mendizabal, killed by the Guardia Civil in April 1973) rented a basement flat at Calle Claudio Coello 104, Madrid, on the route that Blanco would go to mass at San Francisco de Borja church. Over five months, the unit dug a tunnel under the street ‚Äì telling the landlord that they were student sculptors to hide their true purpose. The tunnel was packed with of Goma-2 that had been stolen from a Government depot. On 20 December at 9:36 AM, a three-man ETA commando unit disguised as electricians detonated the explosives by command wire as Blanco's Dodge Dart passed. The blast sent Blanco and his car into the air and over the five-story church, landing on the second-floor terrace of the opposite side. Blanco survived the blast but died at 10:15 AM in hospital. His bodyguard and driver died shortly afterwards. The \\"electricians\\" shouted to stunned passers-by that there had been a gas explosion, and then fled in the confusion. ETA claimed responsibility on 22 January 1974. In a collective interview justifying the attack, the ETA bombers said: The killing was not condemned and was, in some cases, even welcomed by the Spanish opposition in exile. According to Laura Desfor Edles, professor of Sociology at California State University, Northridge, some analysts consider the assassination of Carrero Blanco to be the only thing the ETA have ever done to \\"further the cause of Spanish democracy\\". However, former ETA member turned writer against Basque nationalism Jon Juaristi contended that ETA's goal with the killing was not democratization but a spiral of violence to fully destabilize Spain, heighten Franco's repression against Basque nationalism and force the average Basque citizen to support the lesser evil in the form of the ETA against Franco.Sacra N√©mesis: Nuevas historias de nacionalistas vascos, pages 143‚Äì145, Jon Juaristi, Editorial Espasa Calpe, 1999, Reactions =The government= A government meeting about the \\"dangers of subversion threatening Spain\\" was scheduled to take place on 20 December 1973. Both Carrero Blanco and the United States Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, had expressed concern about a left-wing uprising during the meeting they held on 19 December. When government officials reached the Palace of Villamejor, they learned about Carrero Blanco's death. Deputy Prime Minister Torcuato Fern√°ndez Miranda demanded calm and announced that he was going to call Franco so that Franco could decide what to do next. After the call, Fern√°ndez Miranda proclaimed himself prime minister, in accordance with the dispositions laid out in the Organic Law of the State. His first decision as prime minister was to not declare a state of exception. , Minister of the Navy, informed Fern√°ndez Miranda that , Director-General of the Civil Guard, had decided to \\"maximize surveillance\\" and ordered agents through a telegram not to hesitate to use deadly force if any clash occurred. However, Fern√°ndez Miranda was opposed and made Iniesta Cano reverse this order immediately through a telegram.

His personal name was originally spelled , with the same pronunciation. His works include Tetsujin 28-go, Giant Robo, Akakage, Babel II, Sally the Witch, Princess Comet, and adaptations of the Chinese classics Water Margin and Romance of the Three Kingdoms.  Early life  Yokoyama spent his boyhood during World War II and was evacuated to Tottori with his family. He graduated from Kobe municipal Ota junior high school and went on to the Kobe municipal Suma high school. Osamu Tezuka's \\"Metropolis\\" made a deep impression on Yokoyama who wished to become a manga artist in earnest and so he contributed his works to a comic book in his high school days. He entered the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation after graduation from high school, but quit his job before five months passed because there was no time to draw a manga. He found a new job as a publicity department member for a movie company based in Kobe and pursued his manga artist career on his free time. Career Yokoyama came out with the book \\"\\" for his manga artist d√©but, which caught Osamu Tezuka's attention. In 1955, Yokoyama had a title serialized in the magazine Sh≈çjo for the first time, \\"\\". In 1956, \\"Tetsujin 28-go\\" appeared serially in the sh≈çnen magazine after he resigned from the movie company. \\"Tetsujin 28-go\\" became a popular work equal to Tezuka's Astro Boy and its animated adaptation also made a smashing success. This prompted Yokoyama to become a full-time manga artist and to move to Tokyo the same year. In 1964, he established Hikari Production, an incorporated company. Making good use of his vast exposure to movies during his previous job, he produced consecutive popular hits in various genres, both in comics and anime, such as , Akakage, Sally the Witch, Giant Robo, Babel II and so on. With the writing of \\"\\" (1967‚Äì1971) and Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi (Records of Three Kingdoms) (1971‚Äì1986), he began a new chapter in his career as he drew mostly comics based on original stories with material from China's and Japan's History. In 1991, Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi won the prize for excellence from the Japan Cartoonist Association and an animated version was broadcast on TV Tokyo. In July 1997, Yokoyama was hospitalized with myocardial infarction and had an operation. He returned to work in next year March. In 2004, while under medical treatment, Yokoyama won the MEXT Prize of the Japan Cartoonist Association. On the morning of April 15, 2004, Yokoyama suffered burns all over his body due to a fire breaking out in his house. His condition deteriorated and he fell in a coma. Yokoyama died in the hospital near his home at 10:00 p.m. on the same day, aged 69.  Style  The attractions of Yokoyama's works are calculated story deployment and an elaborate setting. On the other hand, Yokoyama liked light characterizations and didn't let characters show their feelings too much. He was better at a serious story manga rather than with comedy, though he nonetheless drew comics in the latter genre. While Tezuka established the technique to draw Japanese comics, it was Yokoyama who established the format of various genres of current Japanese comics and anime. Whereas many comic artists prefer their original stories not to be changed when adapted, Yokoyama was realistic and tolerant, so many of his works were made into animation or Tokusatsu. * Tetsujin 28 & Giant Robo began the Mecha anime & manga genre. * & Kamen no Ninja Akakage are ninja manga which started a ninja boom.

His study of the rare earth elements led to his discovery of ytterbium in 1878 and co-discovery of gadolinium in 1880. He was considered \\"one of the great chemists of the nineteenth century\\", particularly in the area of inorganic chemistry. On 13 September 2011, the site of his laboratory at the University of Geneva was designated a historical chemical landmark of Switzerland.  Life and work  Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac was born in Geneva on 24 April 1817, to Jacob Galissard de Marignac, a judge, and Susanne Le Royer, a sister of well-known chemist and physiologist Elie Le Royer. Le Royer's pharmacy was in the same building as their home. Marignac attended the √âcole polytechnique in Paris with the intention of becoming a mining engineer. From 1837 to 1839, he studied at the √âcole des mines. The following year was spent traveling and visiting well- known scientists. Marignac worked briefly with Justus von Liebig, and with Alexandre Brongniart in the S√®vres porcelain factory. He also may have been influenced by J√∂ns Jacob Berzelius. On his return, Marignac became in 1841 a professor of chemistry at the Academy of Geneva. In 1845 he was appointed professor of mineralogy as well. He held both chairs until 1878, when he resigned due to poor health. He was able to continue working in a laboratory at his house until 1884, when he became so debilitated that he could no longer work. Marignac died at Geneva on 15 April 1894. Marignac's name is well known for the careful and exact determinations of atomic weights. Whenever possible, he used at least two independent methods to assess a sample. He carried these out for long-identified elements and for newly proposed elements. In undertaking this work he had, like Jean Stas, the purpose of testing Prout's hypothesis, the idea that atomic weights are multiples of hydrogen. However, he remained more disposed than the Belgian chemist to consider the possibility that it may have some degree of validity. By establishing well-defined values for a wide variety of elements, he seriously contributed to the underlying basis of inorganic chemistry. Throughout his life he paid great attention to the rare earths and the problem of separating and distinguishing them. In 1878 Marignac extracted ytterbium from what was supposed to be pure erbia. In 1880 he found gadolinium and samarium in the samarskite earths. In 1858 he pointed out the isomorphism of the fluostannates and the fluosilicates, thus settling the then vexed question of the composition of silicic acid. This research helped him to confirm the atomic weights of zirconium and titanium. Subsequently Marignac studied the fluorides of boron, tungsten, and other elements. He prepared silicotungstic acid, one of the first examples of the complex inorganic acids. Marignac discovered that niobium and tantalum could be separated by fractional crystallization separation of potassium heptafluorotantalate from potassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate, a process which was used commercially until displaced by solvent extraction separation of the same fluorides starting in the 1950s. In physical chemistry he carried out extensive research on the nature and process of solutions, investigating in particular the thermal effects produced by the dilution of saline solutions, the variation of the specific heat of saline solutions with temperature and concentration, and the phenomena of liquid diffusion.

Plaque of Camillo de Lellis inside the historical Hospital of San Giacomo in Rome Camillus de Lellis, M.I., (25 May 1550 - 14 July 1614) was a Roman Catholic priest from Italy who founded the Camillians, a religious order dedicated to the care of the sick. He was beatified by Pope Benedict XIV in the year 1742, and canonized by him four years later in 1746. De Lellis is the patron saint of the sick, hospitals, nurses and physicians. His assistance is also invoked against gambling. Biography =Early life= Camillus de Lellis was born on May 25, 1550, at Bucchianico (now in Abruzzo, then part of the Kingdom of Naples). His mother, Camilla Compelli de Laureto, was nearly fifty when she gave birth to him. His father was an officer in both the Neapolitan and French royal armiesCampbell, Thomas. \\"St. Camillus de Lellis.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 5 May 2018 and was seldom home. De Lellis had his father's temper and, due to his mother's age and retiring nature, she felt unable to control him as he grew up. She died in 1562. As a consequence he grew up neglected by the family members who took him in after her death. Tall for his age, at 16 De Lellis joined his father in the Venetian army and fought in a war against the Turks. After a number of years of military service, his regiment was disbanded in 1575. Having gambled away all his possessions, De Lellis took work as a laborer at the Capuchin friary at Manfredonia; he was constantly plagued, however, by a leg wound he received while in the army, which would not heal. Despite his aggressive nature and excessive gambling, the guardian of the friary saw a better side to his nature, and continually tried to bring that out in him. Eventually the friar's exhortations penetrated his heart and he had a religious conversion in 1575. He then entered the novitiate of the Capuchin friars. His leg wound, however, had continued to plague him and was declared incurable by the physicians, thus he was denied admission to that Order. He then moved to Rome where he entered the San Giacomo Hospital, possibly founded by the Colonna family and dedicated to cardinal Giacomo Colonna (uncle of the founder Giovanni Colonna), which cared for incurable cases. He himself became a caregiver at the hospital, and later its Superintendent. In the meantime, he continued to follow a strict ascetic life, performing many penances, such as constant wearing of a hairshirt. He took as his spiritual director and confessor the popular local priest, Philip Neri, who was himself to found a religious congregation named the Congregation of the Oratory and be declared a saint. De Lellis began to observe the poor attention the sick received from the staff of the hospital. He was led to invite a group of pious men to express their faith through the care of the patients at the hospital. Eventually he felt called to establish a religious community for this purpose, and that he should seek Holy Orders for this task. Neri, his confessor, gave him approval for this endeavor, and a wealthy donor provided him with the income necessary to undertake his seminary studies. He was ordained on Pentecost of 1584 by Lord Thomas Goldwell, Bishop of St Asaph, Wales, and the last surviving Catholic bishop of Great Britain. =Founder= Thus De Lellis established the Order of Clerks Regular, Ministers of the Infirm (abbreviated as M.I.), better known as the Camillians. His experience in wars led him to establish a group of health care workers who would assist soldiers on the battlefield. The large red cross on their cassock remains a symbol of the Congregation today, worn on their habits, today a universal symbol of charity and service. This was the original Red Cross, hundreds of years before the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement was formed. During the Battle of Canizza in 1601, while Camillians were helping with the wounded, the tent in which they were tending to the sick and in which they had all of their equipment and supplies was completely destroyed and burned to the ground. Everything in the tent was destroyed except the red cross of a religious habit belonging to one of the Camillians who was ministering to the wounded on the battlefield. This event was taken by the Camillans to manifest divine approval of the Red Cross of St. Camillus. Members of the Order also devoted themselves to victims of Bubonic plague. It was due to the efforts of the brothers and supernatural healings by de Lellis that the people of Rome credited de Lellis with ridding the city of a great plague and the subsequent famine. For a time, he became known as the \\"Saint of Rome\\". De Lellis' concern for the proper treatment of the sick extended to the end of their lives. He had come to be aware of the many cases of people being buried alive, due to haste, and ordered that the Brothers of his Order wait fifteen minutes past the moment when the patient seemed to have drawn his last breath, in order to avoid this. =Expansion= In 1586 Pope Sixtus V gave the group formal recognition as a congregation and assigned them the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Rome, which they still maintain. In 1588 they expanded to Naples and in 1594 De Lellis led his religious to Milan where they attended to the sick of the Ca' Granda, the main hospital of the city. Pope Gregory XV raised the Congregation to the status of an Order, equivalent with the mendicant orders, in 1591. At that time they established a fourth religious vow unique to their Order: ‚Äúto serve the sick, even with danger to one‚Äôs own life.\\"Website of the Camillian Fathers Throughout his life De Lellis' ailments caused him suffering, but he allowed no one to wait on him and would crawl to visit the sick when unable to stand and walk. It is said that Camillus possessed the gifts of healing and prophecy. He resigned as Superior General of the Order in 1607, but continued to serve as Vicar General of the Order. By that time, communities of the Order had spread all throughout Italy and as far as Hungary. He assisted in a General Chapter of the Order in 1613, after which he accompanied the new Superior General on an inspection tour of all the hospitals of the Order in Italy. In the course of that tour, he fell ill. He died in Rome in 1614, and was entombed at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene. Veneration De Lellis was beatified by Pope Benedict XIV in the year 1742, and canonized by him four years later in 1746. Popularly, De Lellis is the patron saint of the sick, hospitals, nurses and physicians. His assistance is also invoked against gambling. His mortal remains are located in the altar in the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Rome, along with several of his relics. Also on display is the Cross which allegedly spoke to Camillus, and asked him, \\"Why are you afraid? Do you not realize that this is not your work but mine?\\" which has become the motto associated with De Lellis, as well as healthcare workers who were inspired by him. The Congregation of the Servants of the Sick of St Camillus, the Daughters of St. Camillus, the Secular Institutes of Missionaries of the Sick Christ Our Hope, of the Kamillianische Schwestern (Camillan Sisters) and of the Lay Camillian Family, were born later of the charism and spirituality of De Lellis. Camillus' feast day was originally inserted in the General Roman Calendar in 1762 for celebration on 18 July, since 14 July, the day of his death, was at that time taken by the feast of Saint Bonaventure. It was then given the rank of Double; later, it was changed in 1960 to that of \\"Third-Class Feast\\",General Roman Calendar of 1960 and in the liturgical changes of 1969 to that of an optional \\"Memorial\\", when it was also moved to the anniversary of his death, 14 July. In the U.S.A. it is currently an optional Memorial celebrated on 18 July, because on 14 July there is the obligatory Memorial of Kateri Tekakwitha.

Many methods to protect the data and to prevent theft have been developed, including alarms, laptop locks, and visual deterrents such as stickers or labels. Victims of laptop theft can lose hardware, software, and essential data that has not been backed up. Thieves also may have access to sensitive data and personal information. Some systems authorize access based on credentials stored on the laptop including MAC addresses, web cookies, cryptographic keys and stored passwords. According to the FBI, losses due to laptop theft totaled more than $3.5 million in 2005. The Computer Security Institute/FBI Computer Crime & Security Survey found the average theft of a laptop to cost a company $31,975.2005 FBI Computer Crime & Security Survey In a study surveying 329 private and public organizations published by Intel in 2010, 7.1% of employee laptops were lost or stolen before the end of their usefulness lifespan.\\"The Billion Dollar Lost Laptop Problem.\\" Page 2.

Web. 15 August 2012. In the 2011, Bureau Brief prepared by the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research it was reported that thefts of laptops have been on the increase over the last 10 years, attributed in part by an increase in ownership but also because they are an attractive proposition for thieves and opportunists. In 2001 2,907 laptops were stolen from New South Wales dwellings, but by 2010 this had risen to 6,492, second only to cash of items taken by thieves. The Bureau reports that one in four break-ins in 2010 resulted in a laptop being stolen. This startling trend in burglaries lends itself to an increase in identity theft and fraud due to the personal and financial information commonly found on laptops. These statistics do not take into account unreported losses so the figures could arguably be much higher. Businesses have much to lose if an unencrypted or poorly secured laptop is misappropriated, yet many do not adequately assess this risk and take appropriate action. Loss of sensitive company information is of significant risk to all businesses and measures should be taken to adequately protect this data. A survey conducted in multiple countries suggested that employees are often careless or deliberately circumvent security procedures, which leads to the loss of the laptop. According to the survey, employees were most likely to lose a laptop while travelling at hotels, airports, rental cars, and conference events.Business Risk of a Lost Laptop Behling and Wood examined the issue of laptop security and theft. Their survey of employees in southern New England highlighted that not only were security measures fundamentally basic but that training employees in security measures was limited and inadequate. * 100% of the surveyed employees had access to company information via a laptop from remote sites that included their own homes. * 78% were authorized to store company data on their laptop. * 36% of businesses did not provide security training. They concluded that trends in laptop thefts needed to be monitored to assess what intervention measures were required. Inside protection Passwords are no longer adequate to protect laptops. There are many solutions that can improve the strength of a laptop's protection. Full disk encryption (FDE) is an increasingly popular and cost-effective approach. Full disk encryption can be taken on from a software-based approach, a hardware-based approach, or both - end-based approach. FDE provides protection before the operating system starts up with pre-boot authentication, however precautions still need to be taken against cold boot attacks. There are a number of tools available, both commercial and open source that enable a user to circumvent passwords for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. One example is TrueCrypt which allows users to create a virtual encrypted disk on their computer. Passwords provide a basic security measure for files stored on a laptop, though combined with disk encryption software they can reliably protect data against unauthorized access. Remote Laptop Security (RLS) is available to confidently secure data even when the laptop is not in the owner's possession. With Remote Laptop Security, the owner of a laptop can deny access rights to the stolen laptop from any computer with Internet access. Physical protection A number of computer security measures have emerged that aim at protecting data. The Kensington Security Slot along with a locking cable provides physical security against thefts of opportunity. This is a cord that is attached to something heavy that cannot be moved, and is then locked into the case of the laptop, but this is not 100% secure. \\"Kensington Security Slot Specifications for Hardware\\". The Noble security lock slot is a different way to attach a security cable. \\"Noble Security Lock Slot cannot fit a Kensington lock\\". \\"Computer security lock for trapezoidal security slot\\". Centralization of laptop data Another possible approach to limiting the consequences of laptop theft is to issue thin client devices to field employees instead of conventional laptops, so that all data will reside on the server and therefore may be less liable to loss or compromise. If a thin client is lost or stolen, it can easily and inexpensively be replaced. However, a thin client depends on network access to the server, which is not available aboard airliners or any other location without network access. This approach can be coupled with strong authentication as such single sign-on (SSO).

CNN article about a class action settlement for a Veteran Affair stolen laptop In 2007 the Financial Services Authority (FSA) fined the UK‚Äôs largest building society, Nationwide, ¬£980,000 for inadequate procedures when an employees‚Äô laptop was stolen during a domestic burglary. The laptop had details of 11 million customers‚Äô names and account numbers and, whilst the device was password protected, the information was unencrypted. The FSA noted that the systems and controls fell short, given that it took the Nationwide three weeks to take any steps to investigate the content on the missing laptop. The substantial fine was invoked to reinforce the FSA‚Äôs commitment to reducing financial crime. In 2010 VA reported the theft of the laptop from an unidentified contractor; the computer contained personally identifiable information on 644 veterans, including data from some VA medical centers' records. After learning about the unencrypted laptop, VA investigated how many VA contractors might not be complying with the encryption requirement and learned that 578 vendors had refused to sign new contract clauses that required them to encrypt veteran data on their computers, an apparent violation of rules. =Common locations= LoJack for Laptops has compiled a list of the top ten places from which laptops are stolen:Absolute Software, Computer Theft Report, 2011 # Public Schools (K-12) # Residential Properties # Automobiles (excluding taxis) # Businesses/Offices # Universities and Colleges # Restaurants and Cafes # Hotels and Motels # Dormitory # Airports # Public Transit (taxi, bus, train) To provide some context, the Ponemon Institute released a study that indicates over 600,000 laptops will be lost or stolen at US airports every year, with 65-69% of them remaining unclaimed.Ponemon Institute, Airport Insecurity: The Case of Lost Laptops, June 2008 See also * Device tracking software * IT risk * Pre-boot authentication * Prey (software) References External links The spy who lost me - laptop thefts from the British Ministry of Defence * 2005 CSI/FBI Computer Crime and Security Survey - statistics and information about computer crime Computer security exploits Theft Laptops ","title":"Laptop theft"},{"id":"602016","text":"TreadMarks is a distributed shared memory system created at Rice University in the 1990s.

This bell was later moved to Camp Red Cloud in Korea. Fort D.A. Russel (now Francis E. Warren Air Force Base) 1910 In reprisal, General Jacob H. Smith ordered that Samar be turned into a \\"howling wilderness\\" and that they shoot any Filipino male above ten years of age who was capable of bearing arms. The American soldiers seized three church bells from the town church and moved them back to the United States as war trophies. The 9th Infantry Regiment maintained that the single bell in their possession was presented to the regiment by villagers when the unit left Balangiga on 9 April 1902. The bell had been actually given to them by the 11th Infantry Regiment, which had taken all three bells when they left Balangiga for Tacloban on 18 October 1901. Smith and his primary subordinate, Major Littleton Waller of the United States Marine Corps, were both court-martialled for illegal vengeance against the civilian population of Samar. Waller was acquitted of the charges. Smith was found guilty, admonished and retired from service, but charges were dropped shortly after. He was later hailed as a war hero.

A modified form of it became the Helmet, Steel, Mark I in Britain and the M1917 Helmet in the U.S. Colloquially, it was called the shrapnel helmet, battle bowler, Tommy helmet, tin hat, and in the United States the doughboy helmet. It was also known as the dishpan hat, tin pan hat, washbasin, battle bowler (when worn by officers), and Kelly helmet. The German Army called it the Salatsch√ºssel (salad bowl). The term Brodie is often misused. It is correctly applied only to the original 1915 Brodie's Steel Helmet, War Office Pattern. Background The Illustrated War News‚Äî17 November 1915 The caption reads: Head-wounds have been more than usually numerous during the war, owing to the trench-fighting, and more than usually severe, owing to the extensive use of shrapnel. But the danger, although it cannot be avoided, can be minimised. Our Army has now followed the French by adopting steel helmets, calculated to stop shell-splinters and shrapnel. Even in cases of extreme risk, not only has death been avoided, but injuries have been confined to bruises or superficial wounds. Cases have occurred in which the wearers have been hit, but saved by these helmets from what without them would have meant certain death. The fur coats, as they did last year, mean mitigation of the rigours of winter. The French helmets are known as \\"Adrians,\\" after their inventor. (Photo by Illustrations Harrow). At the outbreak of World War I, none of the combatants provided steel helmets to their troops. Soldiers of most nations went into battle wearing cloth, felt, or leather headgear that offered no protection from modern weapons. The huge number of lethal head wounds that modern artillery weapons inflicted upon the French Army led them to introduce the first modern steel helmets in the summer of 1915. The first French helmets were bowl-shaped steel \\"skullcaps\\" worn under the cloth caps. These rudimentary helmets were soon replaced by the Model 1915 Adrian helmet, designed by August-Louis Adrian. The idea was later adopted by most other combatant nations. Origins At about the same time, the British War Office had seen a similar need for steel helmets. The War Office Invention Department was ordered to evaluate the French design. They decided that it was not strong enough and too complex to be swiftly manufactured. British industry was not geared up to an all-out effort of war production in the early days of World War I, which also led to the shell shortage of 1915. John Leopold Brodie (1873‚Äì1945), born Leopold Janno Braude in Riga, was an entrepreneur and inventor who had made a fortune in the gold and diamond mines of South Africa, but was working in London at that time. A design patented by him in August 1915 offered advantages over the French helmet. It was constructed in one piece that could be pressed from a single thick sheet of steel, giving it added strength and making it simple to manufacture. Brodie's patent deals mainly with the innovative lining arrangements; an engineer called Alfred Bates of the firm of Willis & Bates of Halifax, Yorkshire, manufacturer of Vapalux paraffin pressure lamps, claimed that he was asked by the War Office to find a method of manufacturing an anti-shrapnel helmet and that it was he who had devised the basic shape of the steel shell. Aside from some newspaper articles, there is nothing to substantiate Bates's claim.Liddle, Dr Peter (2016), Britain and a Widening War, 1915-1916: From Gallipoli to the Somme, Pen & Sword Military, (p. 182) Brodie's design resembled the medieval infantry kettle hat or chapel-de-fer, unlike the German Stahlhelm, which resembled the medieval sallet. The Brodie had a shallow circular crown with a wide brim around the edge, a leather liner and a leather chinstrap. The helmet's \\"soup bowl\\" shape was designed to protect the wearer's head and shoulders from shrapnel shell projectiles bursting from above the trenches. The design allowed the use of relatively thick steel that could be formed in a single pressing while maintaining the helmet's thickness. This made it more resistant to projectiles but it offered less protection to the lower head and neck than other helmets. The original design (Type A) was made of mild steel with a brim wide. The Type A was in production for just a few weeks before the specification was changed and the Type B was introduced in October 1915. The specification was altered at the suggestion of Sir Robert Hadfield to a harder steel with 12% manganese content, which became known as \\"Hadfield steel\\", which was virtually impervious to shrapnel hitting from above. Ballistically this increased protection for the wearer by 10 per cent. It also had a narrower brim and a more domed crown. Loyal North Lancashire Regiment showing off their new Brodie helmets (1916). The original paint scheme, suggested by Brodie, was a mottled light green, blue, and orange camouflage but they were also painted in green or blue-grey. The weight of a Mark I helmet was approximately . Service The first delivery of the Brodie to British Army troops took place in September 1915, at the rate of 50 per battalion. Initially, there were far from enough helmets to equip every man, so they were designated as \\"trench stores\\", to be kept in the front line and used by each unit that occupied the sector. By early 1916, about a quarter of a million had been made, and the first action in which the Brodie was worn by all ranks was the Battle of St Eloi, in April. Although the helmet's benefits were recognised, there was criticism from several quarters, including General Herbert Plumer, who said that the helmet was too shallow and too light- reflective, its rim was too sharp, and its lining was too slippery. It was decided to introduce a number of improvements, and from May, supplies of the modified helmet, designated the Mark I, began to arrive. It had a separate, folded rim, a two-part liner, and matte khaki paint finished with sand, sawdust, or crushed cork to give a dull, non-reflective appearance. By the summer of 1916 the first million helmets had been produced, and they were issued to all troops. Troops from other countries also used the Brodie helmet, including the United States Armed Forces, when they began to deploy in France late in 1917. The United States government initially purchased some 400,000 helmets from Britain. From January 1918 the U.S. Army began to use helmets manufactured in the U.S. and these helmets were designated M1917. The steel helmet was known to the troops as a \\"tin hat\\", or, for the officers, a \\"battle bowler\\" (from bowler hat). British soldiers soon identified with their helmets, much like French and German soldiers.Tenner, Edward, and Edward Tenner. Our own devices: The past and future of body technology. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2003, p.251 By the end of the war some 7.5 million Brodie helmets had been produced, including 1.5 million M1917 helmets, for use by American forces. =Interwar and World War II= U.S. Army Infantryman in 1942 wearing Brodie helmet From 1936, the Mark I Brodie helmet was fitted with an improved liner and an elasticated (actually, sprung) webbing chin strap. This final variant served until late 1940, when it was superseded by the slightly modified Mk II, which served the British and Commonwealth forces throughout World War II. British paratroopers and airborne forces used the Helmet Steel Airborne Troop. Several Commonwealth nations, such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa, produced local versions of the Mk II, which can be distinguished from those made in Britain. During this period, the helmet was also used by the police, the fire brigade and ARP wardens in Britain. The helmets for the ARP wardens came in two principal variants, black with a white \\"W\\" for wardens and white with a black \\"W\\" for senior ranks (additional black stripes denoted seniority within the warden service); however numerous different patterns were used. A civilian pattern was also available for private purchase, known as the Zuckerman helmet, which was a little deeper but made from ordinary mild steel. Norwegian soldiers at the Battle of Hegra Fortress in 1940, a few wearing Mark I helmets The Norwegian Army adopted the Mark I helmet in 1915, eventually importing a total of 10,000 examples. Some of the imported helmets had a helmet plate with the Norwegian coat of arms affixed to the front. The Mark I remained in Norwegian service throughout the interwar period, alongside Swedish helmets acquired in the 1930s. The helmets were among the equipment issued to Norwegian forces in World War II, seeing service in the 1940 Norwegian Campaign against invading German forces. In the first post-war years, the Mark I helmet remained in service with the Norwegian Army, alongside the American M1 helmet, Swedish helmets, and Stahlhelms left behind by the capitulated German occupation forces.Str√∏m, p. 39 Jewish Civil Defense group in Jerusalem in 1942.

M1917 helmet worn by a Doughboy of the 91st Division in France in 1918 In 1944, the British supplemented it with a significantly modified design, known as the Mk III \\"Turtle\\" helmet. The U.S. Army used the basic Brodie-patterned M1917 helmet until 1942 with some modifications, which included a totally new liner and canvas chin strap. It was finally superseded by the M1 Helmet in 1942 and passed down to civil defence. The helmet was the inspiration for the name of the Memorable Order of Tin Hats (or the MOTH), a brotherhood of ex-front-line soldiers founded in 1927 by Charles Evenden. Variants =United Kingdom= *Brodie's Steel Helmet, War Office Pattern, Type A: the original 1915 helmet with the shell made from magnetic mild steel. *Brodie's Steel Helmet, Type B: with the shell made from Hadfield (manganese) steel. *Helmet, Steel, Mark I: introduced in Spring, 1916, a modified version of the Brodie helmet with a wholly redesigned liner and a mild steel rim to the shell. In 1917, a rubber ring or \\"doughnut\\" was added between the liner and the top of the shell, and in 1935, the liner and chinstrap were modified to make them removable. *Helmet, Steel, Mark I*: introduced in 1938 and made up from old Mark I shells, but fitted with an all new liner and chinstrap. This was the standard British Army helmet at the start of the Second World War. A British helmet dating from the Second World War, probably a Mark II. The grey finish suggests that it was issued to one of the civil defence services. *Helmet, Steel, Mark II: also introduced in 1938, the Mark II featured a new shell with a non-magnetic rim (so that the wearer could use a magnetic compass) and the new liner and chinstrap used in the Mark I*. Early production went to the ARP services, the fire brigade and the police. It was re-designated in July 1940 as the Helmet, Steel, Mark II, No 1 and in the following year, as the Helmet, Steel, No 1, Mark 1. *Helmet, Steel, Mark II, No 2: by July 1940, it had been realised that demand for the Mark II helmet could not be met, and so helmets which had either been rejected as substandard, or had been newly manufactured from cheaper mild steel, began to be issued under the designation \\"Mark II, No 2\\" to the Home Guard and civilian services. These helmets were marked with between one and four small holes drilled into the rim, showing the level of protection that they would provide. This type of helmet was re-designated in 1941 as the Helmet, Steel, No 2, Mark 1.Brayley, Martin J (2008), Tin Hats to Composite Helmets: A Collector's Guide, Crowood Press, (pp. 58-60) A 1941-dated Zuckerman helmet marked \\"SFP\\" for \\"Street Fire Party\\". *Helmet, Steel, Civilian, Civilian Protective Helmet or Zuckerman helmet: when it was found that a large number of civilians were needed to keep a lookout for fires started by incendiary bombs, an even cheaper mass-produced helmet was required. Designed by a team led by government adviser Solly Zuckerman, the thin mild steel helmet was broadly similar in shape to the military pattern but had a taller crown to the shell, providing space for the helmet to crumple. The simple liner was attached to the shell by a boot lace or string passed through holes in the shell. It was made available to civilian fire watchers at a cost of five shillings and sixpence ( new pence) each, starting in December 1940. *Commercial helmets: in 1939, a number of British companies began to manufacture helmets for sale to concerned civilians. These usually had the appearance of Brodie-style helmets, but were generally made of cheap materials such as cast alloys, leather, resin-impregnated fibre or even Bakelite (an early form of plastic), and offered little protection to the wearer.Brayley, pp. 66-67 =Australia= *Helmet No 1, Mark II: a 1936 proposal that steel helmets should be manufactured in Australia was put into effect in 1939 by the Commonwealth Steel Company. The helmets were copies of the British Mark II but lacked the rim. More than two million were produced. =Belgium= *M1949: a post-war Belgian-made copy of the Mark II helmet. The shell was identical to the British original, except that the liner fixing screw on the crown sat in a small indentation. The liner was of Belgian design and the chinstrap was copied from the British Mark III helmet.Brayley, pp. 19-20 =Canada= Canadian troops wearing Mark II helmets; England, 1942. *Helmet, Steel, Mark II: having purchased British helmets in the First World War and at the outbreak of the Second, Canadian helmet production commenced in 1940. The helmets were identical to the British original, except that the rubber \\"bumper\\" pads in the lining were only fitted to horizontal helmet band and not to the vertical bands. The Mark II continued in front-line service with Canadian forces until March 1960.Brayley, pp. 25-26 =New Zealand= *Helmet, Steel, Mark II: in 1940, an order for 30,000 steel helmets could not be fulfilled by the United Kingdom, so production commenced in New Zealand. Manufactured by General Motors (New Zealand) and the New Zealand Railway Workshops using presses and sheet steel imported from Australia, 54,000 Mark II had been made by 1942 with Australian and British liners. Surplus helmets were supplied to other Commonwealth and Empire armies. =Portugal= *M1916: on Portugal's entry into the First World War in 1916, the country lacked the facilities to produce its own helmets and looked to the United Kingdom. British helmet production at that time was giving priority to their own forces, however the Director of Munitions Supply was able to source a commercially produced version of the Brodie helmet, originally intended to be sold to British officers at the time when helmets were in short supply. Given the Portuguese designation \\"M1916\\", it equipped the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps. Made of thin-gauge steel, the bowl was fluted in an attempt to add strength. However, the fluting actually increased the chances of penetration if a missile hit one of the ridges, so some M1916s were produced with a plain bowl. A simple liner was laced to the solid shell through a series of holes. *M1917: the Portuguese designation for the Mark I helmet, which was supplied as soon as the British production facilities became available. *M1917/30: in 1930, the M1917 helmets were refurbished with a redesigned leather liner.Brayley, pp. 93-94 =South Africa= *Helmet, Steel, Mark II: like the other Dominions in the Second World War, South Africa began to produce copies of the Mark II helmet when they became unobtainable from the United Kingdom. Manufactured by the Transvaal Steel Pressing Syndicate, some one and a half million helmets were produced. Unlike the British Mark II and other copies, the plan of the South African helmets was almost circular rather than oval. Another distinguishing feature was three small holes punched into the rear section of the brim, probably intended to allow the fitting of a neck curtain in hot climates. Surplus South African helmets were supplied to other Allied armies. =United States= *M1917: initially the United States purchased 400,000 British Mark I helmets to equip the American Expeditionary Forces in 1917, and those units which were to integrate with French formations were provided with Adrian helmets. The first US-made copies of the Mark I were supplied before the end of 1917 and some 2,700,000 had been made by the end of the war. The M1917 differed little from the British original; different rivets were used to secure the liner, the wire loop onto which the chinstrap was fixed was thicker and the rubber \\"doughnut\\" pad was not adopted. However, the US manufacturers were able to produce a shell with better ballistic protection than the original. *M1917A1: a redesigned liner and a new webbing chinstrap were approved for service in 1934. This model went into full production in 1941, when 904,020 were produced. *M1917 Civil Defense Helmet: this helmet was produced to equip the Civil Defense Corps at the start of the war, and differed from the standard helmet in having a simplified liner and thin webbing chinstrap.Brayley, pp. 112-113 Users      Asbestos concerns In May 2014, the UK's Health and Safety Executive, in consultation with the Imperial War Museum, advised that World War I-era helmets were not safe to handle, owing to the likelihood of their containing asbestos. It advised that schools should not allow pupils to handle such artifacts, but should instead ensure that the objects were either safely disposed of, have the asbestos removed from the object or safely display the object.

It flows east from Trout Lake east of North Bay and enters the Ottawa River at the town of Mattawa. Counting from the head of Trout Lake, it is 76 km in length. The river's name comes from the Algonquin word for \\"meeting of waterways\\". Two provincial parks are located along it: the Mattawa River Provincial Park stretches along both sides of the river's banks for almost its full length; and Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park, located about 10 km from the river's end. Geography The river flows inside a graben through the Algonquin highlands. This valley is an offshoot arm of ancient rift valley, called the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben, which still causes minor earthquakes in the area.Canadian Heritage Rivers System: Mattawa River fact sheet, Ministry of Natural Resources (Online version ) From Lake Talon to Mattawa the river flows through a rock-walled canyon up to in places. Tributaries include the: * Amable du Fond River * Kaibuskong River * North River An interesting feature is the Porte de l'Enfer (Hell's Gate). This is a peculiar cave in the river's bank speculated to be a native ochre mine. As far back as 1761, Alexander Henry the elder reported on this cave and the myths surrounding it. It was said to be inhabited by an evil and fierce demon, hence its name.Hap Wilson, Rivers of the Upper Ottawa Valley, 1993, Evidence of a post-glacial spillway which drained the Great Lakes into the Ottawa River until about 4000 years ago can be seen at several sites along the river. There are potholes at Portage de Talon and numerous cataracts and former river channels, such as the boulder pavement between Pine Lake and McCool Bay, 12‚Äì15 metres (39‚Äì49 ft) above the river's present-day waterline.http://www.chrs.ca/Rivers/Mattawa/Mattawa- F_e.php History Map of the La Vase Portages The Mattawa River had been used by native peoples as an important transportation corridor for many centuries. In 1610, √âtienne Br√ªl√© and in 1615, Samuel de Champlain were the first Europeans to travel the river.Archeological and Historic Sites Board of Canada For some 200 years thereafter, it formed part of the important water route leading from Montreal west to Lake Superior. It was the primary access to the vast Canadian interior in the days of the fur trade. Canoes travelling west up the Ottawa turned left at \\"the Forks\\" (the mouth of the Mattawa) to enter the \\"Petite Rivi√®re\\" (\\"Small River\\", as compared to the Ottawa), reaching Lake Nipissing by way of \\"La Vase Portage\\", an stretch of water and portages.Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada Other notable travellers on the Mattawa included Jean Nicolet in 1620, Jean de Br√©beuf in 1626, Gabriel Lallemant in 1648, Pierre-Esprit Radisson and M√©dard des Groseilliers in 1658, La Verendrye in 1731, Alexander MacKenzie in 1794, and David Thompson in 1812. In the 19th century, the river provided access to large untouched stands of white pine. The river was also used to transport logs to sawmills. The value of the Mattawa River as a transportation link ended in 1881 when the railroad was built to Mattawa. Almost the full length of the river was protected as a provincial park in 1970 and has been designated as a Canadian Heritage River in January 1988. While logging is still an important industry in this region, its shores are now protected from further development and logging. Today, the river and lakes are mainly used for recreation. Mattawa River Provincial Park In 1970, a section of the Mattawa River from the eastern end of Trout Lake to the western boundary of Samuel de Champlain Park was protected. This long and wide ribbon of land on both sides of the river was designated as Ontario's first \\"waterway\\" park. It is a non-operating park, meaning there are no visitor facilities and services. There are some backcountry campsites provided and the portage trails are marked with signs and historic plaques. However most are in various stages of neglect. There are plans to increase the park by of Crown Land along both shores, and extending it on the eastern side of Samuel de Champlain Park towards the town of Mattawa. It will include Rice Bay Delta marsh communities, silver maple swamp forests, and the Talon Lake Forest.Ontario's Living Legacy, Mattawa River Provincial Park Additions Fact Sheet (Online version) Canoeing the Mattawa River Porte de l'Enfer or Hell's Gate The Mattawa River is a popular destination for weekend canoe camping trips. Because of well established portages, the river can be travelled in both directions. The route description below follows the river's flow from west to east. Public access is on Trout Lake. Continue east on the river. Some older maps may still show the Tortue Rapids but these were blasted and no longer present. Turtle Lake follows. From here the river goes north through several sets of small lakes (requiring a lift-over or short portage between each), before looping back and flowing into the north end of Lake Talon. But the historic canoe route bypasses this section by going to Lake Talon through Pine Lake, via Portage de la Mauvaise Musique and Portage Pin de Musique. At the end of Lake Talon, portage around the dam. After Pimisi Lake, there are a few Class 1 rapids until the Paresseux Falls. Shortly after follows the Porte de l'Enfer (Hell's Gate) on the north bank. There are two short whitewater sections inside Champlain Park but which become shallow and a rock garden in low water. The last portage before Mattawa and the Ottawa River is around the Hurdman Dam. =Mattawa River Canoe Race= The Mattawa River Canoe Race has been held each year since 1976, usually to coincide with the Mattawa Voyageur Days Festival in late July. The race runs from Olmsted Beach on Trout Lake in North Bay to Mattawa Island Conservation Area, some long. This popular race is open to several classes of competition, including solo and tandem canoeing, recreational, \\"voyageur\\", and standup paddle boards. There is also a family/youth race which runs from Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park to the finish link at the Mattawa Island Conservation Area. The race is organized by the North Bay-Mattawa Conservation Authority. The race record was set in 1995 at 5 hours, 27 minutes and 53 seconds.

Fijians, or iTaukei,Since 2010, the word \\"Fijian\\" legally also denotes nationality and not ethnicity. are the major indigenous people of the Fiji Islands, and live in an area informally called Melanesia. Indigenous Fijians are believed to have arrived in Fiji from western Melanesia approximately 3,500 years ago, though the exact origins of the Fijian people are unknown. Later they would move onward to other surrounding islands, including Rotuma, as well as blending with other (Polynesian) settlers on Tonga and Samoa. They are indigenous to all parts of Fiji except the island of Rotuma. The original settlers are now called \\"Lapita people\\" after a distinctive pottery produced locally. Lapita pottery was found in the area from 800 BCE onward. As of 2005, indigenous Fijians constituted slightly more than half of the total Fijian population. Indigenous Fijians are predominantly of Melanesian extraction, with some Polynesian admixture. Australia has the largest Fijian expatriate population, according to the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs, while Fijians were also the fifth largest Pacific ethnic group living in New Zealand; a decrease of 8 percent between 1996 and 2001. In 2001, the estimated Pacific Islander population size is 231,800 Fijians comprising about 7,000 of that. Outside Oceania, a substantial Fijian diaspora is found in other anglophone countries, namely Canada, United States and the United Kingdom. The Bose Levu Vakaturaga (Great Council of Chiefs) once passed laws and regulations governing the indigenous Fijian people. Until its disbanding by the Military of Fiji following the 2006 coup, the Great Council of Chiefs met yearly to discuss native Fijian concerns. The council, which was formerly responsible for appointing Fiji's president, was composed of 55 Fijian chiefs selected from the 14 provinces. Included in the council were three appointees from the island of Rotuma and six appointed by the Minister of Fijian Affairs. The Minister of Fijian Affairs consulted with the President as part of the selection process. Former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka was given a lifetime appointment on the council.  Culture  19th century Fijian couple in traditional dress. The native Fijian language belongs to the Central Pacific (Fijian ‚Äì Polynesian) branch of the Austronesian family.Simons, Gary F. and Charles D. Fennig (eds.). 2017. \\"Central Pacific\\", Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Twentieth edition. Dallas, Texas: SIL International. The Fijian traditions are centred around ceremonies and events, that bond the community. Yaqona (pronounced Yang-gohna), otherwise known as kava ‚Äì another important traditional custom ‚Äì is an infusion prepared from the root of Piper methysticum, a type of pepper plant. The plant itself is also often referred to as yaqona or the kava plant. Yaqona is extremely important in indigenous Fijian culture ‚Äì in the time of the 'old religion' it was used ceremonially by chiefs and priests only. Today, yaqona is part of daily life, both in villages and in urban areas and across all classes and walks of life. 'Having a grog' or 'drinking grog', as drinking kava is sometimes known, is used for welcoming and bonding with visitors, for storytelling sessions or merely for passing time. The Tabua is a much revered whale's tooth which is used in both public and private occasions or ceremonies. The tooth is considered sacred.Official Fiji government site About 86 percent of the land in Fiji is owned by indigenous Fijian people. In 1876, Sir Arthur Hamilton- Gordon, the British colonial Governor, prohibited the sale of Fijian land to non-ethnic Fijians. This policy continues today. The Governor also banned the employment of native Fijians as labourers, and in 1878, began importing indentured labourers from India to work in the sugarcane fields. The effects of this immigration created an ethnic polarisation and rampant Anti-Indian sentiment, which has proven to be politically challenging to Fijian race relations. Indigenous Fijians overwhelmingly report as being Christian, with the Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma claiming the loyalty of 66.6% (1996 census). Other significant denominations include the Roman Catholic Church (13.3%), the Assemblies of God (6.2%) and the Seventh-day Adventists (5.1%). About 8% belong to other churches from a large number of denominations. Only about 0.8% report as following non-Christian religions or no religion. Approximately 70% of indigenous Fijians are farmers, many of which are sustenance farmers. They commonly grow such crops as sugar cane, cassava, rice, sweet potatoes, and bananas. Fijian policemen in Suva, 1967 Guard outside the presidential palace in Suva, 2003 Group of Fijian children, 2008 History Historically, Fijians were known as the canoe building experts of the Pacific, using them to trade with Tonga. They were usually large double- hulled canoes, called a Drua (pronounced nDroo-ah), with each side being similar except one was shorter and served as a type of outrigger. These were united by beams, with a platform on it that extended beyond the sides. :The article on the History of Fiji offers a timeline of events. The Lapita people, named after their distinctive pottery style, were the first people to inhabit Fiji in about 3000 BCE, and evidence of their settlements exist throughout Fiji ‚Äì particularly around the Sigatoka Sand Dunes. They were followed by the Melanesians in about 500 BCE, and relatively recent trading with the Polynesian Tongans has added to the cultural mix. In the Lau group of islands, aspects of both cultures still intermingle. There was active commerce between Tonga and Fiji, and later in the history of this relationship, the Fijians in the Lau Islands (Eastern Fiji) became vassals to the King of Tonga. One particular reason Tongans and Samoans came to Fiji was to build the Drua (large double-hulled canoes) which they couldn't build on their own islands because of the lack of proper timber. From the early 19th century, both European and Chinese traders (dishsant visited Fiji for its sandalwood, hardwoods, beche-de-mer, marine life and, more recently, gold. The British ruled Fiji from 1874 to 1970. In 1970, Fiji became a fully independent nation with constitutional arrangements to ensure that traditional Fijian interests were preserved. His Royal Highness Prince of Wales, Prince Charles, presented the Instruments of Independence to Prime Minister Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara on 10 October 1970 at a massive gathering at Albert Park in Suva. In 1972, the first general elections were held using the 1970 constitution. In 1987, two military coups were staged. The first coup was bloodless, and the second coup severed ties with the British Monarchy. A controversial and racially divisive new constitution was adopted in 1990, and in 1992 the first general election was held under the auspices of the new constitution. The constitution was revised again in 1997 and was deemed to be more equitable by the many racial groups in Fiji. Free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an Indo-Fijian, Mahendra Choudhary, but a violent coup in May 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political and racial turmoil. Parliamentary elections held in August 2001 provided Fiji with a democratically elected government led by Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase. Re-elected in May 2006, Qarase was ousted in a military coup on 5 December that year, led by the Commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces(RFMF), Commodore Voreqe (Frank) Bainimarama, who initially appointed himself acting President, but in January 2007 assumed the position of interim Prime Minister, promising a return to democracy in the near future. This did not eventuate, however; elections were not held until 2014.  Fijian family and customs  A traditional music show See main on Fijian traditions and ceremonies and Culture of Fiji.

The church is the cathedral of the Diocese of Rochester in the Church of England and the seat (cathedra) of the Bishop of Rochester, the second oldest bishopric in England after that of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The edifice is a Grade I listed building (number 1086423).  History  =Anglo-Saxon establishment= The Rochester diocese was founded by Justus, one of the missionaries who accompanied Augustine of Canterbury to convert the pagan southern English to Christianity in the early 7th century. As the first Bishop of Rochester, Justus was granted permission by King √Üthelberht of Kent to establish a church dedicated to Andrew the Apostle (like the monastery at Rome where Augustine and Justus had set out for England) on the site of the present cathedral, which was made the seat of a bishopric. The cathedral was to be served by a college of secular priests and was endowed with land near the city called Priestfields. Under the Roman system, a bishop was required to establish a school for the training of priests. To provide the upper parts for music in the services a choir school was required.. Loyn misprints Canterbury for Rochester: Canterbury goes back to the previous decade. Together these formed the genesis of the cathedral school which today is represented by the King's School, Rochester. The quality of chorister training was praised by Bede.Music Department website Setts showing the outline of the first building. The original cathedral was high and wide. The apse is marked in the current cathedral on the floor and setts outside show the line of the walls. Credit for the construction of the building goes to King √Üthelberht rather than St Justus. Bede describes St Paulinus' burial as \\"in the sanctuary of the Blessed Apostle Andrew which √Üthelberht founded likewise he built the city of Rochester.\\" √Üthelberht died in 617 and his successor, Eadbald of Kent, was not a Christian. Justus fled to Francia and remained there for a year before he was recalled by the king., but Palmer anachronistically refers to Francia as Gaul. In 644 Ithamar, the first English-born bishop, was consecrated at the cathedral. Ithamar consecrated Deusdedit as the first Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury on 26 March 655. The cathedral suffered much from the ravaging of Kent by King √Üthelred of Mercia in 676. So great was the damage that Putta retired from the diocese and his appointed successor, Cwichelm, gave up the see \\"because of its poverty\\".www.yale.edu In 762, the local overlord, Sigerd, granted land to the bishop, as did his successor Egbert. The charter is notable as it is confirmed by Offa of Mercia as overlord of the local kingdom. Following the invasion of 1066, William the Conqueror granted the cathedral and its estates to his half-brother, Odo of Bayeux. Odo misappropriated the resources and reduced the cathedral to near-destitution. The building itself was ancient and decayed. During the episcopate of Siward (1058‚Äì1075) it was served by four or five canons \\"living in squalor and poverty\\". One of the canons became vicar of Chatham and raised sufficient money to make a gift to the cathedral for the soul and burial of his wife, Godgifu. =Medieval priory= Gundulf's church The cathedral's Great West Door, with stonework substantially unaltered since Ernulf's time Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, amongst others, brought Odo to account at the trial of Penenden Heath c. 1072. Following Odo's final fall, Gundulf was appointed as the first Norman bishop of Rochester in 1077. The cathedral and its lands were restored to the bishop. Gundulf's first undertaking in the construction of the new cathedral seems to have been the construction of the tower which today bears his name. In about 1080 he began construction of a new cathedral to replace Justus' church. He was a talented architect who probably played a major part in the design or the works he commissioned. The original cathedral had a presbytery of six bays with aisles of the same length. The four easternmost bays stood over an undercroft which forms part of the present crypt. To the east was a small projection, probably for the silver shrine of Paulinus which was translated there from the old cathedral. The transepts were 120 feet long, but only 14 feet wide. With such narrow transepts it is thought that the eastern arches of the nave abuted the quire arch. To the south another tower (of which nothing visible remains) was built. There was no crossing tower. The nave was not completed at first. Apparently designed to be nine bays long, most of the south side but only five bays to the north were completed by Gundulf. The quire was required by the priory and the south wall formed part of its buildings. It has been speculated that Gundulf simply left the citizens to complete the parochial part of the building. Gundulf did not stop with the fabric, he also replaced the secular chaplains with Benedictine monks, obtained several royal grants of land and proved a great benefactor to his cathedral city. In 1078 Gudulf founded St Bartholomew's Hospital just outside the city of Rochester. The Priory of St Andrew contributed daily and weekly provisions to the hospital which also received the offerings from the two altars of St James and of St Giles. During the episcopates of Ernulf (1115‚Äì1124) and John (I) (1125‚Äì1137) the cathedral was completed. The quire was rearranged, the nave partly rebuilt, Gundulf's nave piers were cased and the west end built. Ernulf is also credited with building the refectory, dormitory and chapter house, only portions of which remain. Finally John translated the body of Ithamar from the old Saxon cathedral to the new Norman one, the whole being dedicated in 1130 (or possibly 1133) by the Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by 13 bishops in the presence of Henry I, but the occasion was marred by a great fire which nearly destroyed the whole city and damaged the new cathedral. It was badly damaged by fires again in 1137 and 1179. One or other of these fires was sufficiently severe to badly damage or destroy the eastern arm and the transepts. Ernulf's monastic buildings were also damaged. Medieval remodelling View over Rochester Cathedral from Rochester Castle Probably from about 1190, Gilbert de Glanville (bishop 1185‚Äì1214) commenced the rebuilding of the east end and the replacement on the monastic buildings. The north quire transept may have been sufficiently advanced to allow the burial of St William of Perth in 1201, alternatively the coffin may have lain in the north quire aisle until the transept was ready. It was then looted in 1215 by the forces of King John during siege of Rochester Castle. Edmund de Hadenham recounts that there was not a pyx left \\"in which the body of the Lord might rest upon the altar\\". However, by 1227, the quire was again in use when the monks made their solemn entry into it. The cathedral was rededicated in 1240 by Richard Wendene (also known as Richard de Wendover) who had been translated from Bangor.www.bangorcivicsociety.org.uk The shrines of Ss Paulinus and William of Perth, along with the relics of St Ithamar, drew pilgrims to the cathedral. Their offerings were so great that both the work mentioned above and the ensuing work could be funded. Unlike the abbeys of the period (which were led by an abbot) the monastic cathedrals were priories ruled over by a prior with further support from the bishop. Rochester and Carlisle (the other impoverished see) were unusual in securing the promotion of a number of monks to be bishop. Seven bishops of Rochester were originally regular monks between 1215 and the Dissolution. A consequence of the monastic attachment was a lack of patronage at the bishop's disposal. By the early 16th century only 4% of the bishop's patronage came from non-parochial sources. quoted by The bishop was therefore chronically limited in funds to spend on the non-monastic part of the cathedral. The next phase of the development was begun by Richard de Eastgate, the sacrist. The two eastern bays of the nave were cleared and the four large piers to support the tower were built. The north nave transept was then constructed. The work was nearly completed by Thomas de Mepeham who became sacrist in 1255. Not long after the south transept was completed and the two bays of the nave nearest the crossing rebuilt to their current form. The intention seems to have been to rebuild the whole nave, but probably lack of funds saved the late Norman work. The cathedral was desecrated in 1264 by the troops of Simon de Montfort, during sieges of the city and castle. It is recorded that armed knights rode into the church and dragged away some refugees. Gold and silver were stolen and documents destroyed. Some of the monastic buildings were turned into stables. Just over a year later De Montfort fell at the Battle of Evesham to the forces of Edward I. Later, in 1300, Edward passed through Rochester on his way to Canterbury and is recorded as having given seven shillings (35p) at the shrine of St William, and the same again the following day. During his return he again visited the cathedral and gave a further seven shillings at each of the shrines of Ss Paulinus and Ithamar. The new century saw the completion of the new Decorated work with the original Norman architecture. The rebuilding of the nave being finally abandoned. Around 1320 the south transept was altered to accommodate the altar of the Virgin Mary. There appears to have been a rood screen thrown between the two western piers of the crossing. A rood loft may have surmounted it. Against this screen was placed the altar of St Nicholas, the parochial altar of the city. The citizens demanded the right of entrance by day or night to what was after all their altar. There were also crowds of strangers passing through the city. The friction broke out as a riot in 1327 after which the strong stone screens and doors which wall off the eastern end of the church from the nave were built. The priory itself was walled off from the town at this period. An oratory was established in angulo navis (\\"in the corner of the nave\\") for the reserved sacrament; it is not clear which corner was being referred to, but Dr Palmer argues that the buttress against the north-west tower pier is the most likely setting. He notes the arch filled in with rubble on the aisle side; and on nave side there is a scar line with lower quality stonework below. The buttress is about thick, enough for an oratory. Palmer notes that provision for reservation of consecrated hosts was often made to the north of the altar which would be the case here. The central tower was at last raised by Hamo de Hythe in 1343, thus essentially completing the cathedral. Bells were placed in the central tower (see Bells section below). The chapter room doorway was constructed at around this time. The Black Death struck England in 1347‚Äì49. From then on there were probably considerably more than twenty monks in the priory. Later medieval history Nave looking east towards the altar Nave and interior Norman features looking towards the Great West Door The modern paintwork of the quire walls is modelled on artwork from the Middle Ages. Gilbert Scott found remains of painting behind the wooden stalls during his restoration work in the 1870s. The painting is therefore part original and part authentic. The alternate lions and fleurs-de-lis reflect Edward III's victories, and assumed sovereignty over the French. In 1356 the Black Prince had defeated John II of France at Poitiers and taken him prisoner. On 2 July 1360 John passed through Rochester on his way home and made an offering of 60 crowns (¬£15) at the Church of St Andrew. The Oratory provided for the citizens of Rochester did not settle the differences between the monks and the city. The eventual solution was the construction of St Nicholas' Church by the north side of the cathedral. A doorway was knocked through the western end of the north aisle (since walled up) to allow processions to pass along the north aisle of the cathedral before leaving by the west door. In the mid-15th century the clerestory and vaulting of the north quire aisle was completed and new Perpendicular Period windows inserted into the nave aisles. Possible preparatory work for this is indicated in 1410‚Äì11 by the Bridge Wardens of Rochester who recorded a gift of lead from the Lord Prior. The lead was sold on for 41 shillings. In 1470 the great west window at the cathedral was completed and finally, in around 1490, what is now the Lady Chapel was built. Rochester Cathedral, although one of England's smaller cathedrals, thus demonstrates all styles of Romanesque and Gothic architecture.Rochester, The past 2000 years In 1504 John Fisher was appointed Bishop of Rochester. Although Rochester was by then an impoverished see, Fisher elected to remain as bishop for the remainder of his life. He had been tutor to the young Prince Henry and on the prince's accession as Henry VIII, Fisher remained his staunch supporter and mentor. He figured in the anti-Lutheran policies of Henry right up until the divorce issue and split from Rome in the early 1530s. Fisher remained true to Rome and for his defence of the Pope was elevated as a cardinal in May 1535. Henry was angered by these moves and, on 22 June 1535, Cardinal Fisher was beheaded on Tower Green. Henry VIII visited Rochester on 1 January 1540 when he met Ann of Cleves for the first time and was \\"greatly disappointed\\". Whether connected or not, the old Priory of St Andrew was dissolved by royal command later in the year, one of the last monasteries to be dissolved. =Modern foundation= Henrician settlement The post- Dissolution foundation was a dean, six prebendaries, six minor canons, a deacon, a sub-deacon, six lay clerks, a master of the choristers, eight choristers, an upper and an under master of the grammar school, twenty scholars, six poor men, a porter (who was also to be barber), a butler, chief cook and assistant. Four scholars (two each at Oxford and Cambridge universities) were supported. The deacon and sub-deacon disappeared during the English Reformation, the butler and cooks went when there was no longer a common board. Nicholas Ridley was consecrated Bishop of Rochester in 1547 during the reign of Edward VI. During his time at Rochester he directed that the altars in the churches of his diocese should be removed and tables put in their place to celebrate the Lord's Supper. In 1548 he helped Thomas Cranmer compile the Book of Common Prayer and in 1549 he was one of the commissioners who investigated bishops Stephen Gardiner and Edmund Bonner and agreed that they should be removed from office. In 1550 he was translated to the London; three years later Ridley was involved in the plot to place Lady Jane Grey on the throne in preference to the Roman Catholic Queen Mary. The plot failed and Ridley paid the price; he was burnt at the stake for treason on 16 October 1555. The cathedral suffered a steep decline after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century, during which time its estates were confiscated by the Crown, and it became dilapidated and fell into disrepute. Samuel Pepys, the diarist, would later dismiss it as a \\"shabby place\\".www.kentpast.co.uk Rochester's location beside Watling Street did, however, mean that there continued to be a string of notable visitors. Most famously, Queen Elizabeth I stayed in Rochester for four days in 1573, attending divine service in the cathedral on 19 September. In 1606 James I & VI and his brother-in-law, Christian IV of Denmark, visited the city, accompanied by his family (Queen Anne and Prince Henry). James was accommodated at the bishop's palace and the whole party attended a Sunday service led by William Barlow. William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, visited the cathedral in 1633 and complained about its general state, in particular that it \\"suffered much for want of glass in the windows\\". By the following year the defects had been mainly remedied (apart from some of the glass), the excuse being that the backlog had built up due to money (¬£1,000) being spent on \\"making of the organs\\". Laud accepted this and required completion, noting among other items that the bells and their frame needed to be put into good order (see below, in 1635 one bell was recast). In 1635 the cathedral was described as: \\"small and plaine, yet it is very lightsome and pleasant: her [the cathedral's] quire is neatly adorn'd with many small pillars of marble; her organs though small yet are they rich and neat; her quiristers though but few, yet orderly and decent.\\" The author then describes the various monuments \\"divers others also of antiquity, so dismembred, defac'd and abused\\".Lansdowne MS. no 213 (British Library) quoted in . The reference to the monuments is particularly relevant, for this was six years before the despoliation of the cathedral by Parliamentarian soldiers in the wake of the English Civil War. In 1641 John Evelyn paid his first visit to the cathedral as recorded in his diary: \\"The 19th we rod to Rochester, and having seene the Cathedrall.\\"Evelyn entry for 19 July 1641 Civil War The official record runs: \\"On Wednesday, being Bartholomew Day, we marched forth, some of our souldiers ... went to the Cathedrall about 9 or 10 of the clock, in the midst of their superstitious worship, with their singing men and boyes; they ... went about the work they came for. First they removed the table to its place apointed, and then tooke the seat which it stood upon, ... and brake that all to pieces; ...they pluckt down the rails and left them for the poore to kindle their fires; and so left the organs to be pluckt down when we came back again, but it appeared before we came back they took them downe themselves.\\"\\"A perfect diurnall of the several passages in our late Journey into Kent, from Aug. 19 to Sept 3, 1642, by appointment of both Houses of Parliament\\" quoted in . Post-Restoration, the relative lack of damage was noted, in particular the \\"monuments of the dead\\" were not defaced, although one John Wyld (a freeman and shoemaker of Rochester) was accused of taking down and selling iron and brass from some tombs. Thomas Fairfax's troops stabled their horses in the quire as in other cathedrals. Although no structural damage seems to have occurred, several saw pits were dug in the nave floor. Shortly after the Restoration, Samuel Pepys visited Rochester Cathedral on his way between the London and Chatham Dockyard. The cathedral had fallen into disrepair during the Commonwealth and Pepys observed it was \\"now fitting for use, and the organ then a-tuning\\".Pepys, entry for 10 April 1661 By 1662 ¬£8,000 had been spent and a further ¬£5,000 for repairs were outstanding. The joint diocesan registrar to the bishops from 1629 until 1671 was Peter Stowell. Under the Commonwealth his loyalty had cost him both fines and his liberty. He spent his own money recovering various books and fittings as well as spending ¬£100 on flooring the church from the west door to the pulpitum. The Dean of Rochester led prayers in memory of French Vice-Admiral Jean-Claude de La Robini√®re who was killed in enemy action by the Spanish-Dutch navy in 1667.Evelyn, entry for 2 June 1672www.british-history.ac.uk In 1770 Archdeacon John Warner oversaw the removal of seats from the chancels with communion tables set up and railed \\"as formerly\\", a notably early readoption of the railed altar. The cathedral fabric required continuous care: in 1664 the south aisle was recased and in 1670 40' of the north aisle had to be rebuilt. In 1679 the spire was in a dangerous state and an architect, Samuel Guy, reported on it. He reported that ¬£1,000 of work was needed, however a few months later a Westminster carpenter, Henry Fry, took a different view: some lead work and the repair of one beam was sufficient. ¬£160 was spent on the organ. In 1705 work started to relead the roof, completed by 1724. In 1730 the old ringers' loft above the quire steps was removed and the crossing vaulted. Between 1742 and 1743 major work was undertaken in the quire, sufficiently disruptive that the dean and chapter used nearby St Nicholas' Church. In 1749 the steeple had to be rebuilt and between 1765 and 1772 the west front towers were rebuilt. The cathedral's south quire aisle and transept were giving cause for concern, so in 1751 they were buttressed, the roof lightened and supporting brickwork placed in the crypt. In 1798 Edward Hasted wrote a description of the cathedral and its environs, published as part of his The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent. He observed that \\"time has so far impaired the strength of the materials with which it is built, that in all likelihood the care and attention of the present chapter towards the support of it will not be sufficient to prevent the fall of a great part of it at no great distance of time\\".Hasted A new organ in 1791 completed the 18th-century works. 19th century onwards From 1825 to 1830 Lewis Nockalls Cottingham served as diocesan architect. The quire and its south transept were reroofed due to dry rot. The wall between the main transept and the south quire aisle was still leaning, and the previous century's work had actually worsened the situation. Cottingham built a new external face which effectively buttresses the original wall. The tower was demolished and rebuilt without a spire. The east end was remodelled by lowering the altar and removing the old altar screen. Various windows and arches were opened up and in one of them the tomb of John de Sheppey was discovered. Cottingham remained in charge for the next phase of restoration. From 1840 the pulpit and bishop's throne were rebuilt. The removal of the old pulpit revealed the medieval Wheel of Life painting to be seen at the eastern end of the choir stalls today. It is said to be the oldest such painting in England. A new ceiling of the crossing, new canopy for John de Sheppey, cleaning whitewash and the renovation of the crypt all occurred at this time. From 1871 to 1877 the work was entrusted to George Gilbert Scott. The first phase of the work was to repair the clerestory of the nave, the nave could then be used for service whilst the quire and transepts were worked upon. The south transept was underpinned and the timber vaulting renovated. The north transept had new western windows and a new door. Both had the masonry renovated. The gables and roofs were restored to their old high pitch form based on prints. The organ screen was restored to its original plain form, perhaps a mistake since there was now no screen on the other side of the pulpitum as there had been in the days of St Nicholas' altar. The east end gables were raised, but due to lack of funds the roof has still not been raised to match. The east window (\\"ugly\\" according to Palmer) was replaced with the present lancets. The floor of the presbytery was lowered and the whole eastern part of the building refloored. The choir and prebends stalls were renovated, using original material where possible. The work uncovered the original lion and fleur-de-lis heraldic artwork on which Scott based his decoration of the quire. In memory of Robert Scott (sometime Dean) the quire screen was decorated with the current statues by J. Loughborough Pearson. Pearson also superintended the 1888 restoration of the west front, parts of the facing of which were separating from the core. The flanking towers were restored to the original height and form and the north gable turret rendered as a copy of its partner to the south. During this work the ancient foundations of the original church were uncovered and marked out as noted above. In 1904 the present spire was raised upon the Scott Tower, creating the skyline as it is today. During 1998 the precinct beyond the Great West Door was being repaved when further Saxon foundations were uncovered. The coloured setts extend define the outline.Moss p.9 For the 1400th anniversary of the cathedral, in 2004, a new fresco was painted by Russian icon-painter Sergei Fyodorov in the north transept. Architecture =External= Tympanum The west front is dominated by the central perpendicular great west window. Above the window the dripstone terminates in a small carved head at each side. The line of the nave roof is delineated by a string course above which rises the crenelated parapet. Below the window is a blind arcade interrupted by the top of the Great West Door. Some of the niches in the arcade are filled with statuary. Below the arcade the door is flanked with Norman recesses. The door itself is of Norman work with concentric patterned arches. The semicircular tympanum depicts Christ sitting in glory in the centre, with Saints Justus and Ethelbert flanking him on either side of the doorway. Supporting the saints are angels and surrounding them are the symbols of the Four Evangelists: Ss Matthew (a winged man), Mark (a lion), Luke (an ox) and John (an eagle).Moss p.26 On the lintel below are the Twelve Apostles and on the shafts supporting it King Soloman and the Queen of Sheba. Within the Great West Door there is a glass porch which allows the doors themselves to be kept open throughout the day. Either side of the nave end rises a tower which forms the junction of the front and the nave walls. The towers are decorated with blind arcading and are carried up a further two stories above the roof and surmounted with pyramidal spires. The aisle ends are Norman. Each has a large round headed arch containing a window and in the northern recess is a small door. Above each arch is plain wall surmounted by a blind arcade, string course at the roof line and plain parapet. The flanking towers are Norman in the lower part with the style being maintained in the later work. Above the plain bases there are four stories of blind arcading topped with an octagonal spire. The outside of the nave and its aisles is undistinguished, apart from the walled up north- west door which allowed access from the cathedral to the adjacent St Nicholas' Church. The north transept is reached from the High Street via Black Boy Alley, a medieval pilgrimage route. The decoration is Early English, but reworked by Gilbert Scott. Scott rebuilt the gable ends to the original high pitch from the lower one adopted at the start of the 19th century. The gable itself is set back from the main wall behind a parapet with walkway. He also restored the pilgrim entrance and opened up the blind arcade in the northern end of the west wall. To the east of the north transept is the Sextry Gate. It dates from Edward III's reign and has wooden domestic premises above. The area beyond was originally enclosed, but is now open to the High Street through the memorial garden and gates. Beyond the Sextry Gate is the entrance to Gundulf's Tower, used as a private back door to the cathedral. The north quire transept and east end are all executed in Early English style, the lower windows light the crypt which is earlier. Adjoining the east end of the cathedral is the east end of the Chapter Room which is in the same style. The exact form of the east end is more modern than it appears, being largely due to the work of Scott in the 19th century. Scott raised the gable ends to the original high pitch, but for lack of funds the roofs have not been raised; writing in 1897 Palmer noted: \\"they still require roofs of corresponding pitch, a need both great and conspicuous\\". On the south side of the cathedral the nave reaches the main transept and beyond a modern porch. The aisle between the transepts is itself a buttress to the older wall behind and supported by a flying buttress. The unusual position of this wall is best explained when considering the interior, below. The southern wall of the presbytery is hidden by the chapter room, an 18th-century structure. =Cloisters and ancillary buildings= The cloister was at the heart of the monastery and its outlines can be followed in the cloister garth. The eastern part was formed by Bishop Ernulf's Chapter House and dormitory of which now only the western wall survives. The south of the cloister was the refectory, the work of Prior Helias (also known as √âlie) in about 1215. The lower part of the wall remains and is of massive construction. There was a problem to be solved, the older cloister was bounded by the Roman city wall. Helias simply drove through it the a doorway and used the wall as the north wall of the refectory. =Gundulf Tower= Plaque recording the restoration of the Gundulf Tower Immediately to the north of the cathedral proper and nestling in between the quire transept, pilgrim steps and sextry gate is the 11th-century Gundulf Tower. This is oldest part of the cathedral still above ground. Until the 18th century it rose as high as the adjacent parts of the church, some 65 feet.Grose's \\"Antiquities\\" vol iii (1781) and \\"History and Antiquities of Rochester\\" (1772) both cited by During the 19th century it severely decayed, until by 1897 it was recorded that \\"only ruins now remain\\". The lower part of the tower was roofed and the fabric made good in 1925. Most of the cost (¬£1600) was met by the freemasons. The plaque illustrated to the left is affixed to a wall therein. The three floors are now occupied by the cathedral music department (first floor and top floor) and the vergers (ground floor). =Nave= A Green Man depicted in the crossing ceiling The western part of the nave is substantially as Gundulf designed it. According to George H. Palmer (who substantially follows St John Hope) \\"Rochester and Peterborough possess probably the best examples of the Norman nave in the country\\". The main arcade is topped by a string course below a triforium. The triforium is Norman with a further string course above. The clerestory above is of perpendicular style. From the capitals pilasters rise to the first string course but appear to have been removed from the triforium stage. Originally they might have supported the roof timbers, or even been the springing of a vault. and Hasted. A scar is still visible on the triforium wall where the pilasters used to be. The easternmost bay of the triforium appears to be Norman, but is the work of 14th-century masons. The final bay of the nave is Decorated in style and leads to the tower piers. Of note is the north pier which possibly contains the Oratory Chapel mentioned above. The aisles are plain with flat pilasters. The eastern two bays are Decorated with springing for vaulting. Whether the vault was ever constructed is unknown, the present wooden roof extends the full length of the aisles. The crossing is bounded to the east by the quire screen with the organ above. This is of 19th-century work and shows figures associated with the early cathedral. Above the crossing is the central tower, housing the bells and above that the spire. The ceiling of the crossing is notable for the four Green Men carved on the bosses. Visible from the ground is the outline of the trapdoor through which bells can be raised and lowered when required. The floor is stepped up to the pulpitum and gives access to the quire through the organ screen.  Mini-golf course  In July 2019, the Nave became host to a nine-hole mini-golf course, with each hole including a model of a different type of bridge. A representative from Cathedral explained that \\"We hope that, while playing adventure golf, visitors will reflect on the bridges that need to be built in their own lives and in our world today.\\" The course is due to be open from 1 August until 1 September. =North transept= The north transept is from 1235 in Early English style. The Victorian insertion of windows has been mentioned above in the external description. Dominating the transept is the baptistery fresco. The fresco by Russian artist Sergei Fyodorov is displayed on the eastern wall. It is located within an arched recess. The recess may have been a former site of the altar of St Nicholas from the time of its construction in 1235 until it was moved to the screen before the pulpitum in 1322. A will suggests that \\"an altar of Jesu\\" also stood here at some point, an altar of some sort must have existed as evidenced by the piscina to the right of the recess.. He quotes from the History and Antiquities of Rochester, anonymous but probably Samuel Denne and William Shrubsole, 1772, 2nd ed. 1817. The vaulting is unusual in being octpartite, a development of the more common sexpartite. The Pilgrim Door is now the main visitor entrance and is level for disabled access. =South transept and Lady Chapel= Stained glass from inside the cathedral showing the risen Christ with the cross of St George The original Lady Chapel was formed in the south transept by screening it off from the crossing. The altar of the Blessed Virgin Mary was housed in the eastern arch of the transept. There are traces of painting both on the east wall and under the arch. The painting delineates the location of the mediaeval north screen of the Lady Chapel. Around 1490 this chapel was extended westwards by piercing the western wall with a large arch and building the chapel's nave against the existing south aisle of cathedral. From within the Lady Chapel the upper parts of two smaller clerestory windows may be seen above the chapel's chancel arch. Subsequently, a screen was placed under the arch and the modern Lady Chapel formed in the 1490 extension. The south transept is of early Decorated style. The eastern wall of it is a single wide arch at the arcade level. There are two doorways in the arch, neither of which is used, the northern one being hidden by the memorial to Dr William Franklin. The south wall starts plain but part way up is a notable monument to Richard Watts, a \\"coloured bust, with long gray beard\\". According to Palmer there used to be a brass plaque to Charles Dickens below this but only the outline exists, the plaque having been moved to the east wall of the quire transept. The west wall is filled by the large arch mentioned above with the screen below dividing it from the present Lady Chapel. The Lady Chapel as it now exists is of Decorated style with three lights along southern wall and two in the west wall. The style is a light and airy counterpart to the stolid Norman work of the nave. The altar has been placed against the southern wall resulting in a chapel where the congregation wraps around the altar. The window stained glass is modern and tells the gospel story. The first, easternmost, window has the Annunciation in the upper light: Gabriel speaking to Mary (both crowned) with the Holy Spirit as a dove descending. The lower light shows the Nativity with the Holy Family, three angels and shepherds. The next window shows St Elizabeth in the upper light surrounded by stars and the sun in splendour device. The lower light shows the Adoration of the Magi with Mary enthroned with the Infant. The final window of the south wall has St Mary Magdelene with her ointment surrounded by Tudor roses and fleurs-de-lis in the upper light with the lower light showing the Presentation in the Temple. The west wall continues with St. Margaret of Scotland in the upper light surrounded by fouled anchor and thistle roundels. The reference is to the original dedication of the cathedral as the Priory of St Andrew. The lower light shows the Crucifixion with Mary and St Peter. The final window is unusual, the upper light is divided in three and shows King Arthur with the royal arms flanked by St George on the left and St Michael on the right. The lower light shows the Ascension: two disciples to the left, three women with unguents to the right and three bare crosses top right.

Below is a stone tablet with their names inscibed. Under the fourth window is a slightly later tablet recording those of 1939‚Äì45. File:Rochester Cathedral WWI memorial.JPGWW I memorial tablet File:Rochester Cathedral WWII memorial.JPGWW II memorial tablet =Quire, aisles and transepts= quire looking towards the nave The eastern part of the church is the old monastic area. It is walled off from the public parts by the organ screen, side walls to the quire and cross walls in both aisles. The riots in 1327 are considered part of the cause, but this coincided with a general trend to wall off monasteries. The north aisle is a simple passageway interrupted by a flight of steps and the cross wall. The steps form part of the pilgrimage route to St William's shrine (hence their designation as \\"The Pilgrim Steps\\") and are so worn by medieval feet that before 1897 they had to have wooden treads added. The south aisle was originally the same width as the northern one. The 14th-century cross wall is still visible filling the arch to the east, now forming the entrance to the vestry over the crypt entrance. Gundulf's small tower occupied what is now the south western portion of the aisle. To keep the cloisters uniform, a wall was established from the tower to what is now the cathedral library. When the tower was demolished its base along with the enclosed area was incorporated into the south aisle. The new \\"Kent Steps\\" lead up from the widened aisle into the quire transept, whilst the old entrance now gives access to the crypt below. Archaeological investigations in 2014 revealed an earlier Norman structure underneath the \\"Kent Steps\\". The foundations of the existing (14th-century) wall have been discovered to be Norman. A doorway from the crypt led to a flight of stairs running upwards with a window looking out into the cloisters. This work dates from the first phase of the present cathedral. The detailed report is expected to be published in late 2016. Before the Victorian renovations the quire had steeply stepped stalls and a pulpit. Removal of these revealed the medieval Rota Fortunae (\\"Wheel of Life\\") painting and the original patterning of the walls. The existing wall pattern is modern, being a copy of that found, but the painting's main subject is untouched. Above the painted walls the triforium is blind arched with the clerestory and sextipartite vaulting above. Some of the earlier timbers have been reused in the stalls, but most of the work is 19th-century. Before Scott's work the quire stalls continued in their high-backed form and cut off the quire transepts. They are now open and form a single space to accommodate a larger congregation when required. The south transept has two openings which no longer lead anywhere; one originally led to the crypt (before the south aisle was widened), the other led up to the Indulgence Chamber. The north transept was the site of St. William's shrine and the center of pilgrimage in the Middle Ages. Of St William's shrine little now remains. Edward Hasted refers to a \\"large stone chest, much defaced\\", Palmer notes that the tomb in the easternmost bay of the transept is \\"reputed to be that of St. William\\". The shrine was originally in the centre of the floor. The whole transept used to be known as St William's Chapel, the railed off area to the east being later called St John the Baptist's Chapel and more lately the Warner Chapel on account of the monuments therein. Tucked into a corner of the Warner Chapel is a cross of nails. In the centre of the north wall is the resting place of Walter de Merton, former bishop and founder of Merton College. Two wooden doors are visible, one of which leads nowhere, access now being from the other side of the wall; the other leads to the cathedral treasury. This latter is reputed to be one of the oldest doors still in use in England.Cathedral History The north quire transept and presbytery form a stylistic whole. The east end however has been substantially remodelled by Scott. The arcading contains the tombs of various past bishops, that between the Warner Chapel and the presbytery is unusually well preserved. It is the tomb of de Sheppey which was walled up at some point and forgotten about. As a result, it escaped the depredations of the English Commonwealth. The tomb was rediscovered, uncovered and restored by Cottingham from 1825 to 1840. =Chapter room doorway= The doorway to the chapter room and present library is described variously as \\"magnificent\\", \\"elaborate\\", and \\"one of the finest examples of English Decorated architecture in existence\\" by scholars who have visited and studied the cathedral. The two full length figures either side of the door represent the New and Old Covenant. The latter is a female figure with a broken staff and the tables of the law held upside down, blindfold to symbolise ignorance of the Messiah. The former is a female holding a cross and church. Palmer notes that Cottingham's 1825‚Äì30 restoration work added the head of a \\"mitred, bearded bishop\\", but examination today reveals nothing of this. Above these two are four great Doctors of the Church: Ss Augustine, Gregory, Jerome and Ambrose. They are depicted seated at reading desks and lecterns. Above, on each side, are a pair of angels bearing scrolls and ascending from flames. The uppermost figure in the arch is a small nude figure. This is symbolic of a purified soul arising from Purgatory upwards towards a canopy, possibly the gates of Heaven. It may be Hamo de Hythe who commissioned the doorway.Tourist interpretation panel adjacent to the doorway Above the canopy the ogee outer arch rises to a final pinnacle bearing a pedestal. Today there is no figure upon this pedestal. The outer arch is decorated with deeply undercut foliage. The spandrels and the areas under the figures are filled with diaper work, themselves noteworthy. =East end= Rochester Cathedral presbytery Much of what can be seen of the east end is the work of Gilbert Scott, though closely based upon the earlier structure. =Crypt= Crypt looking towards the south quire transept from the quire crossing The oldest part of the crypt is the two westernmost bays under the eastern end of the quire. It is part of the original 1080s Lanfranc construction with typical Romanesque groin vaulting springing from plain capitals atop quite slender plain shafts. The rest of the crypt is from a century later. The plinths, shafts and capitals are in the same style as the earlier work, but quadripartite rib vaulting was used. Owing to the oblong shape of the bays, the shorter transverse arches are pointed; however, since the other ribs are rounded, the overall appearance is Romanesque. In places remnants of the mediaeval paintwork are visible in the vaulting. More medieval paintwork is visible in the east end window openings. The eastern part of the crypt under the presbytery has been converted into a chapel dedicated to St Ithamar. Except when used for the Sunday Club (for young people) during Sunday Eucharist, it is reserved as a place of quiet and stillness for private prayer and reflection. Access to the crypt is down a flight of stairs from the south quire aisle. The stairs occupy the width of the original aisle prior to the demolition of Gundulf's small tower (see above). A wheelchair lift installed in 2017 provides disabled access. As part of the addition of disabled access and the change of use of the crypt, the whole of the crypt floor has been removed and the area under it investigated by archaeologists. A Roman house and the foundations of the original east end have been uncovered. () reports are not yet available, the published plans have been affected by archaeological discoveries.HTFE Music =Organ= screen Rochester Cathedral's current pipe organ originates from the 1905 instrument built by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd. It was later rebuilt by Mander Organs in 1989, who installed a new choir organ and pipework under the advice of Paul Hale. =Organists= James Plomley is listed as organist at Rochester in 1559. Among the composers, conductors and concert performers who have been organists at Rochester Cathedral are Bertram Luard-Selby, Harold Aubie Bennett, Percy Whitlock and William Whitehead. =Choirs= The cathedral choir traces its roots back to the church's foundation in AD 604. The quality of the chorister training was praised by the Venerable Bede in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People.Music Department website Main choir The main choir consists of the boy choristers, girl choristers and the lay clerks. The provision of boy choristers was why King's School was founded in 604, at the same time as the cathedral itself. It still supplies boys from its preparatory school to sing the treble line. The boy‚Äôs choir do multiple services weekly. From 1995 a girls' choir was introduced to sing some of the services for which the boys were not available. Girls now do alternate weekends; the boy‚Äôs choir will do one week and the girl‚Äôs choir will do another, and weekly Monday services. Girls are drawn from any of the local schools. There are currently 18 Boy choristers and 17 girl choristers. The lay clerks are professional singers who provide the lower three voices: alto, tenor and bass. For great services, all three parts of the choir may combine. Voluntary choir The present choir was formed in August 2008 from the previous auditioned adult voluntary choir. The voluntary choir sings for around 10 weekends per year, usually during holiday periods when the child choristers are unavailable. They also sing in lieu of the main choir at the Eucharist as required. =Bells= bell with USS Pittsburgh memorial inscription (diameter measures ) Rochester Cathedral has a ring of 10 bells hung for change ringing in the English style. All were cast in 1921, some as memorials to men lost in the First World War or Great War. The heaviest bell is tuned to D. Although it is probable that the original Saxon cathedral of 604 had one or more bells, early records are scant. The 11th-century Gundulf Tower has architectural features which indicate bells were placed there from the start. In 1154 Prior Reginald made two bells and recast a third, existing, cracked one. Two further bells were obtained during the 12th century as mentioned in the Custumale Roffense of c. 1300. In 1343, Hamo de Hythe arranged for the central tower to be heightened and hung four bells called \\"Dunstanus, Paulinus, Itmarus atque Lanfrancus\\" (Dunstan, Paulinus, Itamar and Lanfranc). In 1635 the third was recast and in 1683 the fifth and tenor, followed by the treble in 1695. The fourth was noted as cracked in 1711 and a quotation obtained from Richard Phelps. The contract went the following year to James Bagley who also quarter turned the second: \\"the striking sides being much worn\\". The 1695 treble was recast in 1770 and the 1683 tenor recast in 1834. In 1904 two further bells were added at the time that the tower and spire were rebuilt. Of the original six bells four were recast and two retained. In 1921 all the bells were recast and augmented to the current ring of 10. When bells are recast the original metal is reused with new metal added as required, therefore there is every reason to assume that the current bells contain the metal from all the original bells back to the time of Gundulf. In 1960 the bells were rehung on a new steel frame by John Taylor. The service of dedication for the new bells was held on the 16 May 1921. After prayers, the bells were rung for one minute, before the service resumed. Following the service touches of Grandsire caters and Stedman caters were rung. 15 members of the cathedral band and 31 visitors all took turns ringing. Because the bells are a memorial ring, including men who had died in the Great War, they were rung half-muffled on this first occasion.Chatham News 1921 For many years the reason why the number 3 bell bears the inscription \\"U.S.S. Pittsburgh in Memory of 1920\\" was a mystery. However a letter from James W. Todd, officer commanding USS Pittsburgh was published in the Chatham News on 17 December 1920. In it he thanks the Dean of Rochester for various events during the two and a half months that the USS Pittsburgh was in dry-dock at Chatham. He encloses a cheque for ¬£52 10s to pay for the recasting of the bell and discusses the inscription.Chatham News, 17 Dec 1920 p.7 Dean and chapter : *Dean ‚Äî Philip Hesketh (since 19 June 2016 installation) *Canon Precentor ‚Äî Matthew Rushton (since 25 March 2017 installation)Friends of Cathedral Music ‚Äî Rochester has new precentor (Accessed 17 January 2018) *Priest-in-Charge, Borstal and Diocesan Canon ‚Äî Sue Brewer (canon since 9 September 2018 installation)Facebook post and Music Sheet (both accessed 3 February 2019) *Diocesan Director of Formation & Ministry and Diocesan Canon ‚Äî Chris Dench (residentiary canon since 9 September 2018 installation) Notable people Grevile Marais Livett, a longtime precentor of the cathedral and later vicar of Wateringbury, authored several books and monographs on the Norman churches of England as well as contributing extensively to Archaeologia Cantiana, the journal of the Kent Archaeology Society.

When Gundulf established the priory in 1082 it was as a Benedictine house. As reading forms a part of the daily routine as laid down in the Rule of Saint Benedict it may be assumed that there was a library by then. By the time of Gundulf's death in 1108 the number of monks had risen from the original 22 to over 60, implying a sizeable library. In the Textus Roffensis of 1130 a catalogue of the library is included within it. There was the famous Gundulf Bible (now in the Huntington Library, California); the Textus itself; scriptural commentaries; treatises by various Church Fathers; historical works (including Bede's Ecclesiastical History) and assorted books on monastic life. Most books were in Latin, with just a few in Anglo-Saxon. One hundred and sixteen books are named, with a further 11 added later. These were volumes; some would contain multiple works within them. A further catalogue compiled in 1202 records 280 volumes. This latter catalogue was only rediscovered in the 19th century. It had been written on two leaves at the beginning of a copy of St Augustine's De Doctrina Christiana belonging to Rochester. The copy is now in the British Library.. Correct in 1953, but it will be in the British Library now. The mediaeval library was located in different parts of the cathedral and precincts at different times. The precentor was in charge of it and also responsible for providing the materials needed to enable copyists, illuminators and authors' work. Because all copying was by hand and taught locally, monasteries varied in their style. There is an identifiable \\"Rochester Script\\" of the 12th century. When King John besieged the castle (1215) some manuscripts were lost, and more were too in 1264 when Simon de Montfort occupied the City of Rochester. The Dissolution of the Monasteries was catastrophic for the cathedral library. John Leland, Royal Librarian and antiquary, complained to Thomas Cromwell that young German scholars were appearing and cutting documents out of books in the cathedral libraries. and other sources, see Leland for example. Leland was able to save some manuscripts and 99 from Rochester are now in the Royal Collection in the British Museum. 37 other works have been traced in England, Scotland, Europe and even the United States. Following the Dissolution, the Old Vestry to the east of the south quire transept was adopted as the Chapter Room and library. Notwithstanding its change in designation, it is still used from time to time as a vestry by the clergy. The only contents to survive the Dissolution were ancient manuscripts, the 50 volumes predating 1540 appear to have been later acquisitions.. The figure 50 is taken from the 1953 text and may not be accurate today. The library remained smaller than in mediaeval times, there were less clergy than monks. The chapter members were required to be \\"learned and erudite\\" and possess a university degree, so it is postulated that they would have their own personal books. From the 18th century onwards the library grew, in part due to donations which became traditional upon deans and canons' appointments. Some legacies were received, notably Richard Poley of Rochester whose grave can be seen at the foot of the Quire Steps. In 1907-9 the east wall of the library was reconstructed, the floor replaced and new bookcases provided by the donation of T. H. Foord, a benefactor of both the city and cathedral. =Notable contents= The Textus Roffensis, mentioned above, is in the care of the local council. The Custumale Roffense dates from around 1300 and gives (in Latin) information about the priory's income and domestic arrangements. Instructions are given for the ringing of bells, confirming their use at this date. There is a copy of St Augustine's De Consensu Evangelistarum (\\"On the Harmony of the Evangelists\\") copied in the first half of the 12th century. It is in its medieval binding and from script it is clear that the copy was made at Rochester. Also from Rochester is Peter Lombard's Book of Sentences (Questiones Theologicae) from the late 13th century. There are a number of medieval charters. There is a Complutensian Polyglot Bible (Greek, Latin and Hebrew) printed in Spain in 1514-17. A Sarum Missal of 1534 came from Paris. Rochester has a copy of Coverdale's Bible from 1535, a Great Bible of 1539, a Bishop's Bible of 1568 and numerous other later copies. The Bishop's Bible is notable for the note at Psalm xlv.9: \\"Ophir is thought to be the Ilande in the west coast, of late found by Christopher Colombo, from whence at this day is brought most fine gold.\\" Disabled access Disabled access is via the north door into the nave transept. In the south quire aisle is a wheelchair lift over part of the \\"Kent Steps\\". This gives access to the quire and presbytery level; there is a disabled WC near the foot of this. There is currently no disabled access to the crypt, but there are plans to insert a lift linking the three levels roughly where the existing wheelchair lift is. King's Engineers Rochester Cathedral viewed from the top of Rochester Castle Gundulf, a monk from the Abbey of Bec in Normandy came to England in 1070 as Lafranc's chaplain at Canterbury. His talent for architecture had been spotted by William I and was put to good use in Rochester where he was appointed as bishop in 1077. Almost immediately the king appointed him to supervise the construction of the White Tower, now part of the Tower of London in 1078. Under William Rufus he also undertook building work on Rochester Castle. Having served three Kings of England and earning \\"the favour of then all\\", Gundulf is accepted as the first \\"King's Engineer\\". He died in 1108 and his statue adorns the west door of the cathedral. Because of his military engineering talent, Gundulf is regarded as the \\"father of the Corps of Royal Engineers\\". The corps claims a line of Kings Engineers pre- dating the engineers of the Board of Ordnance in 1414 and the formal founding of the Corps in 1716 all the way back to Gundulf. This shared heritage and the close proximity to the cathedral of the Royal School of Military Engineering in Brompton means the Corps of Royal Engineers and Rochester Cathedral maintain strong links to this day. There are over 25 memorials to individual officers and soldiers of the Corps of Royal Engineers, including that of Lieut John Chard VC, the officer in charge of defending Rorke's Drift against the Zulu onslaught, and a number of memorials representing members of the corps that have given their lives in the discharge of their duty, including many stained glass windows presented by the corps. A memorial tablet was erected in 1902 to the memory of three officers, graduates of the Royal Military College of Canada, who died while serving in Africa: Huntly Brodie Mackay, Captain Royal Engineers; William Henry Robinson, Captain Royal Engineers; and William Grant Stairs, Captain the Welsh Regiment. The latest memorial to the Corps of Royal Engineers was dedicated during the service of remembrance on the Corps Memorial Weekend, 19 September 2010, led by Adrian Newman (then Dean of Rochester; later Bishop of Stepney), in the presence of the Chief Royal Engineer, Peter Wall, and the families of the ten Royal Engineers killed in Afghanistan since September 2009, recipients of military decorations including the Elizabeth Cross.

Life, work, and interests Janssen was born in Paris into a cultivated family. His father, Antoine C√©sar Janssen (born in Paris, 1780 ‚Äì 1860) was a well known clarinettist from Dutch/Belgian descent (his father emigrated from Walloon Brabant to Paris). His mother Pauline Marie Le Moyne (1789 ‚Äì 1871) was a daughter of the architect Paul Guillaume Le Moyne. Pierre Janssen studied mathematics and physics at the faculty of sciences. He taught at the Lyc√©e Charlemagne in 1853, and in the school of architecture 1865 ‚Äì 1871, but his energies were mainly devoted to various scientific missions entrusted to him. Thus in 1857 he went to Peru in order to determine the magnetic equator; in 1861‚Äì1862 and 1864, he studied telluric absorption in the solar spectrum in Italy and Switzerland; in 1867 he carried out optical and magnetic experiments at the Azores; he successfully observed both transits of Venus, that of 1874 in Japan, that of 1882 at Oran in Algeria; and he took part in a long series of solar eclipse-expeditions, e.g. to Trani (1867), Guntur (1868), Algiers (1870), Siam (1875), the Caroline Islands (1883), and to Alcosebre in Spain (1905). To see the eclipse of 1870, he escaped from the Siege of Paris in a balloon. Unfortunately the eclipse was obscured from him by cloud. In the year 1874, Janssen invented the Revolver of Janssen or Photographic Revolver, instrument that originated the chronophotography. Later this invention was of great use for researchers like Etienne Jules Marey to carry out exhibitions and inventions. Discovery of helium In 1868 Janssen discovered how to observe solar prominences without an eclipse. While observing the solar eclipse of 18 August 1868, at Guntur, Madras State (now in Andhra Pradesh), British India, he noticed bright lines in the spectrum of the chromosphere, showing that the chromosphere is gaseous. Present in the spectrum of the Sun, though not immediately noticed or commented upon, was a bright yellow line later measured to have a wavelength of 587.49 nm. This was the first observation of this particular spectral line, and one possible source for it was an element not yet discovered on the earth. From the brightness of the spectral lines, Janssen realized that the chromospheric spectrum could be observed even without an eclipse, and he proceeded to do so. On 20 October, Joseph Norman Lockyer in England set up a new, relatively powerful spectroscope. He also observed the emission spectrum of the chromosphere, including the same yellow line. Within a few years, he worked with a chemist and they concluded that it could be caused by an unknown element, after unsuccessfully testing to see if it were some new type of hydrogen. This was the first time a chemical element was discovered on an extraterrestrial body before being found on the earth. Lockyer and the English chemist Edward Frankland named the element after the Greek word for the Sun, ·º•ŒªŒπŒøœÇ (helios).Oxford English Dictionary (1989), s.v. \\"helium\\". Retrieved 16 December 2006, from Oxford English Dictionary Online. Also, from quotation there: Thomson, W. (1872). Rep. Brit. Assoc. xcix: \\"Frankland and Lockyer find the yellow prominences to give a very decided bright line not far from D, but hitherto not identified with any terrestrial flame. It seems to indicate a new substance, which they propose to call Helium.\\"For the name \\"helium\\" see also Observatories Passage de Venus (1874) At the great Indian eclipse of 1868 that occurred in Guntur, Janssen also demonstrated the gaseous nature of the red prominences, and devised a method of observing them under ordinary daylight conditions. One main purpose of his spectroscopic inquiries was to answer the question whether the Sun contains oxygen or not. An indispensable preliminary was the virtual elimination of oxygen-absorption in the Earth's atmosphere, and his bold project of establishing an observatory on the top of Mont Blanc was prompted by a perception of the advantages to be gained by reducing the thickness of air through which observations have to be made. This observatory, the foundations of which were fixed in the hard ice that appeared to cover the summit to a depth of over ten metres, was built in September 1893, and Janssen, in spite of his sixty-nine years, made the ascent and spent four days taking observations. In 1875, Janssen was appointed director of the new astrophysical observatory established by the French government at Meudon, and set on foot there in 1876 the remarkable series of solar photographs collected in his great Atlas de photographies solaires (1904). The first volume of the Annales de l'observatoire de Meudon was published by him in 1896. (see also Meudon Great Refractor) Janssen was the President of the Soci√©t√© Astronomique de France (SAF), the French astronomical society, from 1895‚Äì1897.de la Soci√©t√© astronomique de France, 1911, vol. 25, pp. 581‚Äì586 International Meridian Conference In 1884 he took part in the International Meridian Conference. Death, honors, and legacy Janssen's grave in Paris Janssen died at Meudon on 23 December 1907 and was buried at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, with the name \\"J. Janssen\\" inscribed on his tomb. During his life he was made a Knight of the Legion of Honor and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London. Craters on both Mars and the Moon are named in his honor. The public square in front of Meudon Observatory is named Place Jules Janssen after him. Two major prizes carry his name: the Prix Jules Janssen of the French Astronomical Society, and the Janssen Medal of the French Academy of Sciences. Janssen named minor planet 225 Henrietta discovered by Johann Palisa, after his wife, Henrietta.

Its founders included Friedrich Hayek, Frank Knight, Karl Popper, Ludwig von Mises, George Stigler and Milton Friedman. The society advocates freedom of expression, free market economic policies and the political values of an open society. Further, the society seeks to discover ways in which free enterprise can replace many functions currently provided by government entities.  Aims  In its \\"Statement of Aims\\" on 8 April 1947, the scholars were worried about the dangers faced by civilization, stating the following: The group also stated that it is \\"difficult to imagine a society in which freedom may be effectively preserved\\" without the \\"diffused power and initiative\\" associated with \\"private property and the competitive market\\" and found it desirable inter alia to study the following matters: # \\"The analysis and exploration of the nature of the present crisis so as to bring home to others its essential moral and economic origins. # The redefinition of the functions of the state so as to distinguish more clearly between the totalitarian and the liberal order. # Methods of re-establishing the rule of law and of assuring its development in such manner that individuals and groups are not in a position to encroach upon the freedom of others and private rights are not allowed to become a basis of predatory power. # The possibility of establishing minimum standards by means not inimical to initiative and functioning of the market. # Methods of combating the misuse of history for the furtherance of creeds hostile to liberty. # The problem of the creation of an international order conducive to the safeguarding of peace and liberty and permitting the establishment of harmonious international economic relations.\\" The group \\"seeks to establish no meticulous and hampering orthodoxy\\", \\"conduct propaganda\\" or align with some party. It aims to facilitate \\"the exchange of views [...] to contribute to the preservation and improvement of the free society\\".  Name  The MPS was created on 10 April 1947 at a conference organized by Friedrich Hayek. Originally, it was to be named the Acton- Tocqueville Society. After Frank Knight protested against naming the group after two \\"Roman Catholic aristocrats\\" and Ludwig von Mises expressed concern that the mistakes made by Acton and Tocqueville would be connected with the society, the decision was made to name it after Mont P√®lerin, the Swiss resort where it convened.  History  In 1947, thirty-nine scholars, mostly economists with some historians and philosophers, were invited by Friedrich Hayek to meet to discuss the state and possible fate of classical liberalism, his goal being an organization which would resist interventionism and promote his conception of classical liberalism. He wanted to discuss how to combat the \\"state ascendancy and Marxist or Keynesian planning [that was] sweeping the globe\\". The first meeting took place in the Hotel du Parc in the Swiss village of Mont P√®lerin, near the city of Vevey, Switzerland. Funding for the conference came from various sources including the William Volker Fund thanks to Harold Luhnow and the Bank of England owing to the help of Alfred Suenson- Taylor. William Rappard, a Swiss academic, diplomat and founder of the Graduate Institute of International Studies, addressed the society's inaugural meeting. In his \\"Opening Address to a Conference at Mont Pelerin\\",F. A. Hayek, The Fortunes of Liberalism: Essays on Austrian Economics and the Ideal of Freedom (1992) Hayek mentioned \\"two men with whom I had most fully discussed the plan for this meeting both have not lived to see its realisation\\", namely Henry Simons (who trained Milton Friedman, a future president of the MPS, at the University of Chicago) and John Clapham, a British economic historian. The MPS aimed to \\"facilitate an exchange of ideas between like-minded scholars in the hope of strengthening the principles and practice of a free society and to study the workings, virtues, and defects of market-oriented economic systems\\". The MPS has continued to meet regularly, the General Meeting every two years and the regional meetings annually. The current president of the MPS is Pedro Schwartz Giron. It has close ties to the network of think tanks sponsored in part by the Atlas Economic Research Foundation.  Influence  Hayek stressed that the society was to be a scholarly community arguing against collectivism while not engaging in public relations or propaganda. The society has become part of an international think tank movement and Hayek used it as a forum to encourage members such as Antony Fisher to pursue the think tank route. Fisher has established the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) in London during 1955, the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research in New York City in 1977 and the Atlas Economic Research Foundation in 1981. Now known as the Atlas Network, they support a wide network of think tanks, including the Fraser Institute. Prominent MPS members who advanced to policy positions included the late Chancellor Ludwig Erhard of West Germany, President Luigi Einaudi of Italy, Chairman Arthur F. Burns of the Federal Reserve Board and Secretary of State George Shultz. Among prominent contemporary political figures, former President V√°clav Klaus of the Czech Republic and acting politicians, such as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe of Sri Lanka, former Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Geoffrey Howe of the United Kingdom, former Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Defence Antonio Martino, Chilean Finance Minister Carlos C√°ceres and former New Zealand Finance Minister Ruth Richardson, are all MPS members. Of 76 economic advisers on Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign staff, 22 were MPS members. Several leading journalists, including Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Walter Lippmann, former radical Max Eastman (then roving editor at Reader's Digest), John Chamberlain (former editorial writer for Life magazine), Henry Hazlitt (former financial editor of The New York Times and columnist for Newsweek), John Davenport (holder of editorial posts at Fortune and Barron's) and Felix Morley (Pulitzer Prize- winning editor at The Washington Post), have also been members. Members of the MPS have also been well represented on the Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. Eight MPS members, Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, George Stigler, Maurice Allais, James M. Buchanan, Ronald Coase, Gary Becker and Vernon Smith have won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Graeme Maxton and J√∏rgen Randers note that it is no surprise that so many MPS members have won a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences because the MPS helped to create that award, specifically to legitimize free-market economic thinking.Graeme Maxton, Jorgen Randers (2016). Reinventing Prosperity: Managing Economic Growth to Reduce Unemployment, Inequality and Climate Change. Greystone Books. . p. 77. In the 2014 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report (Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program, University of Pennsylvania), the MPS is noted as having the 9th (out of 55) \\"Best Think Tank Conference\\". In 2018, the Swiss blockchain banking Fintech company Mt Pelerin has named itself after the Mont Pelerin Society as an hommage to the values that the organization advocates.https://www.mtpelerin.com/about-us.html  Past presidents  Numerous notable economists have served as president of the MPS:Past Presidents.

Located in the northern part of the country, it is the administrative centre of Pleven Province, as well as of the subordinate Pleven municipality. It is the biggest economic center in Northwestern Bulgaria. At the end of 2018 its population is 96,610. Internationally known for the Siege of Plevna of 1877, it is today a major economic centre of the Bulgarian Northwest and Central North and the third largest city of Northern Bulgaria after Varna and Ruse. Name The name comes from the Slavic word plevnya (\\"barn\\") or from plevel, meaning \\"weed\\", sharing the same root, and the Slavic suffix -en. Geography Pleven is in an agricultural region in the middle of the Danubian Plain, the historical region of Moesia, surrounded by low limestone hills, the Pleven Heights. The city's central location in Northern Bulgaria defines its importance as a big administrative, economic, political, cultural and transport centre. Pleven is away from the capital city of Sofia, west of the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast and south of the Danube. The river Vit flows near the city and the tiny Tuchenitsa river (commonly known in Pleven as Barata, literally \\"The Streamlet\\") crosses it. =Climate= Pleven's climate is temperate continental. Winters are cool, with much snow: temperatures usually fall below overnight. Springs are warm, with temperatures around . Summers are warm, and temperatures have exceeded on occasion. The average annual temperature is around . History =Prehistory and antiquity= The earliest traces of human settlement in the area date from the 5th millennium BC, the Neolithic. The central streets of Pleven Numerous archaeological findings, among them the Nikolaevo treasure found in Bulgaria, evidence for the rich culture of the Thracians, who inhabited the area for thousands of years. In the beginning of the new era, the region became part of the Roman province of Moesia, and a road station called Storgosia arose near present-day Pleven on the road from Oescus (near modern Gigen) to Philippopolis (now Plovdiv). It later evolved into a fortress. One of the most valued archaeological monuments in Bulgaria from the period is the Early Christian basilica from the fourth century discovered near the modern city. =Middle Ages= Pleven Regional Historical Museum During the Middle Ages, Pleven was a well-developed stronghold of the First and the Second Bulgarian Empire. When Slavs populated the region, they gave the settlement its contemporary name Pleven, it was first mentioned in a charter by Hungarian king Stephen V in 1270 in connection to a military campaign in the Bulgarian lands. =Ottoman rule= During the Ottoman rule, Pleven, known as Plevne in Ottoman Turkish, preserved its Bulgarian appearance and culture. Many churches, schools and bridges were built at the time of the Bulgarian National Revival. In 1825, the first secular school in the town was opened, followed by the first girls' school in Bulgaria in 1840, as well as the first boys' school a year later. Pleven was the place where the Bulgarian national hero Vasil Levski established the first revolutionary committee in 1869, part of his national revolutionary network. =Siege of Plevna= The city (then mostly known as Plevna outside Bulgaria) was a major battle scene during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878 that Russian Tsar Alexander II held for the purpose of the liberation of Bulgaria. The joint Russian and Romanian army paid dearly for the victory, but it paved the path to the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in this war, the restoration of Bulgaria as a state and the independence of Romania from the Ottoman Empire. It cost the Russians and Romanians 5 months and 38,000 casualties to take the town after four assaults, in what was one of the decisive battles of the war. The siege is remembered as a landmark victory of the Romanian War of Independence, as on 28 November 1877 the Plevna citadel capitulated, and Osman Pasha surrendered the city, the garrison and his sword to the Romanian Colonel Mihail Cerchez. Pleven Panorama, one of the town's best known sights In the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition of 1911 J.H.V. Crowe concluded his lengthy entry on Pleven (transcribed as Plevna) with the memorable dictum: On the other hand, the Siege of Plevna stands out among other countless sieges and military actions in the region because of its significance.\\"The Balkan Wars\\", Andre Gerolymatos, 2002, Basic Books, p.204 Without this fortress slowing the Russian onslaught, which gave the Great Powers time to intercede, Constantinople would have been repossessed by a Christian army once more. =Modern history= The events of the Russo-Turkish War proved crucial for the development of Pleven as a key town of central northern Bulgaria. The town experienced significant demographic and economic growth in the following years, gradually establishing itself as a cultural centre of the region. The Bulgarian Agrarian National Union, a leading interwar party representing the Bulgarian peasantry, was founded in the town in December 1899. Prior to the Bulgarian orthographic reform of 1945, the name of the town was spelled –ü–ª—£–≤–µ–Ω—ä (with yat) in Cyrillic. Population The town hall of Pleven According to census 2011, Pleven has a population of 106,954 inhabitants as of February 2011.National Statistical Institute - Main Towns Census 2014 The ethnic breakdown is 97% Bulgarians among others. The number of the residents of the city reached its peak in the period 1988-1991 when exceeded 135,000. The following table presents the change of the population after 1887. =Ethnic, linguistic and religious composition= According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows: Population on 01.02.2011 by provinces, municipalities, settlements and age; National Statistical InstitutePopulation by province, municipality, settlement and ethnic identification, by 01.02.2011; Bulgarian National Statistical Institute *Bulgarians: 95,386 (96.5%) *Turks: 1,510 (1.5%) *Gypsies: 1,017 (1.0%) *Others: 489 (0.5%) *Indefinable: 422 (0.4%) **Undeclared: 8,130 (7.6%) Total: 106,954 In Pleven Municipality 112,414 declared as Bulgarians, 4626 as Gypsies, 3204 as Turks and 10,384 did not declare their ethnic group. Most Roma people in Pleven Municipality live in the village of Bukovlak (:bg:–ë—É–∫–æ–≤–ª—ä–∫). An overwhelming majority of 90% of Pleven's residents are Eastern Orthodox Christian. The Diocese of Nikopol, of which Pleven is part, is one of the two Roman Catholic dioceses in Bulgaria, and another 5% of the residents are Roman Catholic by faith, a significant number compared to other Bulgarian cities. Pleven has three Eastern Orthodox churches, the Bulgarian National Revival St Nicholas Church (1834) that was constructed at the place of a chapel from the Second Bulgarian Empire, the St Paraskeva Church (1934) and the Holy Trinity Church, built in 1870 at the place of a church mentioned as early as 1523 and inaugurated by Exarch Antim I. , a new Eastern Orthodox church is being built in the Strogoziya quarter. The construction of a large Roman Catholic church of Our Lady of Fatima began in 2001. A mosque also exists in the town to serve the needs of the Muslim population, as well as a Methodist church that is situated on the site of the former local puppet theatre. Economy Two banks in central Pleven A major centre of oil processing, metalworking, machinery construction, of light and food industries in Socialist times. However, the late 1990s and early 2000s saw a revival of light industry and the development of branches such as knitwear and store clothes production. Tourism, which had attracted many people from the Soviet Union prior to 1989, and had experienced a slump in the following years, is on the rise again. In 2015, the unemployment rate in Pleven district was 9.2%. The most important economic sectors in Pleven are chemical, textiles and foodstuffs industries, the manufacturing of cement and glass, machine building, tailoring, agriculture, retail and services. The city has seen a number of major foreign investments in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Particularly noticeable is the mass construction of hypermarkets, with two Billa, two Kaufland, two Carrefour (in construction- first one to open in MALL PLEVEN in 2011), DM, Plus (in construction), ELEMAG, METRO, two LIDL stores, a Praktiker, bauMax and a number of other hypermarkets being opened . The Pleven City Center and Central Mall Pleven were opened in 2008. Transport The international railway Sofia ‚Äî Bucharest ‚Äî Moscow runs through Pleven. The international road E 83 passes just north of the city. The national A2 Hemus highway Sofia ‚Äî Varna is projected to pass south of Pleven. Over 90% of the inner city transportation in Pleven is maintained by trolleybuses. There are 14 trolleybus lines, and trolleybus network. The trolleybus fleet consist of ZIU-682 (1985‚Äì1988) and Skoda 26-TR Solaris trolleybuses, produced in 2014. A project for trolleybus routes extension is underway. When the extension is completed Pleven will become 100% covered by trolleybus transport. Transmitter Near Pleven, there is a large facility for medium wave and short wave broadcasting. Pleven medium wave transmitter, working on 594 kHz, uses as antenna two tall guyed mast radiators insulated against ground. These masts belong to the tallest structures of Bulgaria. Museum of the Liberation of Pleven Main sights Most of the sights of the town are related to the Russo-Turkish War. The monuments related to the war alone are about 200. Some of the more popular include the St George the Conqueror Chapel Mausoleum in honour of the many Russian and Romanian soldiers who lost their lives during the Siege of Plevna and the ossuary in Skobelev Park. Another popular attraction is Pleven Panorama, created after (and reputedly larger than) the Borodino Panorama in Russia on the occasion of the anniversary of the Siege of Plevna. Culture The Pleven Regional Historical Museum is another popular tourist attraction, while the Svetlin Rusev Donative Exhibition, situated in the former public baths, exhibits works by Bulgarian artists, as well as noted Western European art figures. The Ivan Radoev Dramatic Theatre is the centre of theatrical life in Pleven. A number of community centres (chitalishta) are also active in the city. Medical University - Pleven,is one of the five medical universities in Bulgaria, was established in 1974, aiming to expand the horizons, size and reputation of the City Hospital, founded in 1865. Sport and recreation Pleven is often regarded as an important centre of sports in Bulgaria, with many noted Bulgarian sportspeople having been born and/or trained in the town, including Tereza Marinova and Galabin Boevski. The city hosts two football clubs, Spartak Pleven and Belite orli, which have separate stadiums. Both teams play in the second Bulgarian league and haven't had any major successes in the past, although Spartak Pleven has been the first team for a couple of former Bulgarian internationals such as Plamen Getov. Spartak Pleven is also a basketball team, a national championship winner in 1995 and national cup winner in 1996 (then named Plama Pleven). Other than that, the team is a regular first league participant. Pleven is famous for its Kaylaka (where the ruins of the Storgosia fortification can be found) and Skobelev parks. The latter is home to the Pleven Panorama and is situated on the original location of the battle during the Russo-Turkish War.

From the Nuremberg Chronicle (1493). The characteristic of cynocephaly, or cynocephalus (), having the head of a dog‚Äîor of a jackal‚Äîis a widely attested mythical phenomenon existing in many different forms and contexts. The literal meaning of \\"cynocephaly\\" is \\"dog-headed\\"; however, that this refers to a human body with a dog head is implied. Such cynocephalics are known in mythology and legend from many parts of the world, including ancient Egypt, Greece, and China. Further mentions come from the medieval East and Europe. In modern popular culture cynocephalics are also encountered as characters in books, comics, and graphic novels. Cynocephaly is generally distinguished from lycanthropy (werewolfism) and dogs that can talk. Etymology The word cynocephaly is taken (through Latin) from the Greek word Œ∫œÖŒΩŒøŒ∫Œ≠œÜŒ±ŒªŒøŒπ kynokephaloi, plural of the word Œ∫œÖŒΩŒøŒ∫Œ≠œÜŒ±ŒªŒøœÇ,Diodorus Siculus, Library, 3.35.5 from kyno‚Äì (combining form of Œ∫œçœâŒΩ ky≈çn) meaning \\"dog\\" and Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒÆ kephalƒì meaning \\"head\\". The same \\"dog\\" root is found in the name Cynomorpha (\\"dog-shaped\\") for a sub-group of the family Cercopithecidae, which contains many species of macaques and baboons. Ancient Greece and Egypt Cynocephaly was familiar to the ancient Greeks from representations of the Egyptian gods, Duamutef (Son of Horus), Wepwawet (The opener of the ways), and Anubis (the Egyptian god of the dead). The Greek word () \\"dog-head\\" also identified a sacred Egyptian baboon with the face of a dog.The binomial name for the yellow baboon is Papio cynocephalus, while Cynocephalus has also been adopted as the genus name for an Asian arboreal gliding mammal also known as a colugo. Reports of dog-headed races can also be traced back to Greek antiquity. In the fifth century BC, the Greek physician Ctesias, in his Indica, wrote a detailed report on the existence of cynocephali in India.Ctesias, Indica ¬ß¬ß 37, 40‚Äì3 Similarly, the Greek traveller Megasthenes claimed to know about dog-headed people in India who lived in the mountains, communicated through barking, wore the skins of wild animals and lived by hunting.Megasthenes, Indica, vis-a-vis Pliny the Elder, Historia Naturalis 7.2: 14‚Äì22; Fragments XXX. B. Solin. 52. 26‚Äì30. Herodotus reports claims by ancient Libyans that such creatures inhabit the east of their lands, as well as headless men and various other anomalies. The best estimate for the place where the battle between the Argonauts and the Cynocephali took place is modern day North Serbia, or South Hungary. Late Antiquity The cynocephali offered such an evocative image of the magic and brutality deemed characteristic of bizarre people of distant places that they kept returning in medieval literature. St. Augustine of Hippo mentioned the cynocephali in The City of God, Book XVI, Chapter 8, in the context of discussing whether such beings were descendants of Adam; he considered the possibility that they might not exist at all, or might not be human (which Augustine defines as being a mortal and rational animal: homo, id est animal rationale mortale), but insisted that if they were human they were indeed descendants of Adam.Augustine of Hippo, City of God, Book XVI, Chapter 8 Medieval East Cynocephali also figure in medieval Christian worldviews. A legend that placed Andrew the Apostle and Bartholomew the Apostle among the Parthians presented the case of \\"Abominable\\", the citizen of the \\"city of cannibals... whose face was like unto that of a dog.\\" After receiving baptism, however, he was released from his doggish aspect.David Gordon White, Myths of the Dog-man (University of Chicago Press) 1991:32. =Saint Christopher= Cynocephalus 251x251px In the Eastern Orthodox Church, certain icons covertly identify Saint Christopher with the head of a dog. The background to the dog-headed Christopher is laid in the reign of the Emperor Diocletian, when a man named Reprebus, Rebrebus or Reprobus (the \\"reprobate\\" or \\"scoundrel\\") was captured in combat against tribes dwelling to the west of Egypt in Cyrenaica. To the unit of soldiers, according to the hagiographic narrative, was assigned the name numerus Marmaritarum or \\"Unit of the Marmaritae\\", which suggests an otherwise-unidentified \\"Marmaritae\\" (perhaps the same as the Marmaricae Berber tribe of Cyrenaica). He was reported to be of enormous size, with the head of a dog instead of a man, apparently a characteristic of the Marmaritae. This Byzantine depiction of St. Christopher as dog-headed resulted from their misinterpretation of the Latin term Cananeus (Canaanite) to read canineus, that is, \\"canine\\". The German bishop and poet Walter of Speyer portrayed St. Christopher as a giant of a cynocephalic species in the land of the Chananeans (Canaan in the New Testament) who ate human flesh and barked. Eventually, Christopher met the Christ child, regretted his former behavior, and received baptism. He, too, was rewarded with a human appearance, whereupon he devoted his life to Christian service and became an Athleta Christi, one of the military saints.Walter of Speyer, Vita et passio sancti Christopher martyris, 75. There are some rare icons that depict this martyr with the head of a dog. Such images may carry echoes of the Egyptian dog-headed god, Anubis. Christopher pictured with a dog's head is not generally supported by the Orthodox Church, as the icon was proscribed in the 18th century by Moscow.Pageau, Jonathan. \\"Understanding The Dog-Headed Icon of St- Christopher\\", Orthodox Arts Journal, July 8, 2013 = Ibn Battuta = Ibn Battuta encountered what were described as \\"dog-mouthed\\" people on his journey, possibly describing a group of Mentawai people (whom practice teeth sharpening), who live on an island between India and Sumatra: Medieval West Cynocephali illustrated in the Kiev Psalter of 1397 Paul the Deacon mentions cynocephali in his Historia gentis Langobardorum: \\"They pretend that they have in their camps Cynocephali, that is, men with dogs' heads. They spread the rumor among the enemy that these men wage war obstinately, drink human blood and quaff their own gore if they cannot reach the foe.\\"simulant se in castris suis habere cynocephalos, id est canini capitis homines. Divulgant apud hostes, hos pertinaciter bella gerere, humanum sanguinem bibere et, si hostem adsequi non possint, proprium potare cruorum. Paul the Deacon, Historia gentis Langobardorum Book 1, ch. 11. At the court of Charlemagne, the Norse were given this attribution, implying un-Christian and less-than-human qualities: \\"I am greatly saddened\\" said the King of the Franks, in Notker's Life, \\"that I have not been thought worthy to let my Christian hand sport with these dog-heads.\\"Notker, Life of Charlemagne, Book II ¬ß3. The ninth-century Frankish theologian Ratramnus wrote a letter, the Epistola de Cynocephalis, on whether the Cynocephali should be considered human (he thought that they were).Patrologia Latina 121: 1153‚Äì56. If human, a Christian's duty would be to preach the Gospels to them. If animals, and thus without souls, such would be pointless. Quoting St. Jerome, Thomas of Cantimpr√© corroborated the existence of Cynocephali in his Liber de Monstruosis Hominibus Orientis, xiv, (\\"Book of Monstrous men of the Orient\\"). The thirteenth-century encyclopedist Vincent of Beauvais acquainted his patron Saint Louis IX of France with \\"an animal with the head of the dog but with all other members of human appearance‚Ä¶ Though he behaves like a man‚Ä¶ and, when peaceful, he is tender like a man, when furious, he becomes cruel and retaliates on humankind\\".Vincent, Speculum naturale, 31:126. The Nowell Codex, perhaps more commonly known as the manuscript containing the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf, also contains references to Cynocephali. One such reference can be found in the part of the manuscript known as The Wonders of the East, in which they are called \\"healfhundingas\\" or \\"half-dogs.\\" Also, in Anglo-Saxon England, the Old English word wulfes heafod (\\"wolf's head\\") was a technical term for an outlaw, who could be killed as if he were a wolf. The so-called Leges Edwardi Confessoris, written around 1140, however, offered a somewhat literal interpretation: ‚Äú[6.2a] For from the day of his outlawry he bears a wolf's head, which is called wluesheued by the English. [6.2b] And this sentence is the same for all outlaws.‚Äùlupinum enim caput geret a die utlagacionis sue, quod ab Anglis 'uuluesheued' [= Old English wulfes heafod 'wolf's head'] nominatur. Et haec sententia communis est de omnibus utlagis. Leges Edwardi Confessoris ¬ß 6. Cynocephali appear in the Old Welsh poem Pa Gur? as cinbin (dogheads). Here they are enemies of King Arthur's retinue; Arthur's men fight them in the mountains of Eidyn (Edinburgh), and hundreds of them fall at the hand of Arthur's warrior Bedwyr (later known as Bedivere).Green, p. 84-85. The next lines of the poem also mention a fight with a character named Garwlwyd (Rough-Gray); a Gwrgi Garwlwyd (Man-Dog Rough-Gray) appears in one of the Welsh Triads, where he is described in such a way that scholars have discussed him as a werewolf.Bromwich, p. 73‚Äì74Bromwich p. 385 =High and late medieval travel literature= headless man, a cyclops and a sciapod, from The Voyage and Travels of Sir John Mandeville Medieval travellers Giovanni da Pian del Carpine and Marco Polo both mention cynocephali. Giovanni writes of the armies of √ñgedei Khan who encounter a race of dogheads who live north of the Dalai-Nor (Northern Ocean), or Lake Baikal.John of Plano Carpini, The long and wonderful voyage of Frier Iohn de Plano Carpini, Chapters 11 and 15 The Travels of Marco Polo mentions the dog-headed barbarians on the island of Angamanain, or the Andaman Islands. For Polo, although these people grow spices, they are nonetheless cruel and \\"are all just like big mastiff dogs\\".Yule, Henry and Cordier, Henri. The Travels of Marco Polo, Chapter 13, Vol II In The Voyage and Travels of Sir John Mandeville, dog-headed men are described as inhabiting the island of Nacumera (the Nicobar Islands). According to Henri Cordier, the source of all the fables of the dog-headed barbarians, whether European, Arabic, or Chinese, can be found in the Alexander Romance.Henri Cordier's 'Notes and Addenda' in the Sir Henry Yule edition of The Travels of Marco Polo, Volume 2.  Modern European  In his feature Giant Egg, David Attenborough speculates that the indri, a type of lemur from Madagascar, may be one possible origin to the myth of dog-headed men. China Eastern Zodiacal Dog as a dog headed and possibly tailed person. Rubbing from the tomb of Gim Yu-sin of Later Silla (now Korea). In Central and East Asia a common calendar system consists of a twelve-year cycle, with each year represented as an animal. The eleventh animal of the twelve-year cycle is the dog. Often such animals are depicted as human figures with an animal head. Thus, the cynocephalic depiction of the eleventh zodiac animal is common (possibly with a tail). Additionally, in the Chinese record Book of Liang, the Buddhist missionary Hui Shen describes an island of dog-headed men to the east of Fusang, a nation he visited variously identified as Japan or the Americas. The History of the Northern Dynasties of Li Dashi and his son, Li Yanshou, Tang historians, also mentions the \\"dog kingdom\\". Modern appearances The use of dog-headed, human-bodied characters is still very strong in modern literature. In the domain of comics publishing in North America and in Europe many works feature an \\"all- cynocephalic\\" cast or use the heads of dogs and other animals together for social comment or other purposes: * In the Pulitzer Prize winning graphic novel Maus by Art Spiegelman, Jews have human bodies and the heads of mice while characters with their roots in the United States have human bodies and the heads of dogs, Germans have the heads of cats, and the French have the heads of frogs. * The comic book Ghost Rider features a villain named Doghead. He is an anthropomorphic dog who serves Blackheart, the son of Mephisto, a demon lord falsely claiming to be The Devil. * The hero of Baudolino, a novel by Umberto Eco, has to face dog-headed people at the end of his journey. * Dog-headed creatures based on the ancient accounts appear in many modern role- playing games, such as Dungeons & Dragons. * A fearsome race of dog-faced warriors appear in Terry Jones's book The Saga of Erik the Viking. * The title character in Scott Adams' cartoon Dilbert once dated a dog-headed woman, described as \\"fetching\\". * In the 1989 cult film Marquis by Henri Xhonneux, the Marquis de Sade is portrayed as a human with the head of a Spaniel. * Mr. Peanutbutter, a major character in the Netflix comic psychodrama BoJack Horseman, is a cynocephalic person with the head and other characteristics of a Labrador Retriever. * The Camp Half-Blood Chronicles feature the Cenocephaly (spelled as \\"Cynocephali\\"). ** In The Heroes of Olympus book \\"The Blood of Olympus,\\" the Cynocephali were obtained from Triumvirate Holdings by Octavius. ** In The Trials of Apollo book \\"The Tyrant's Tomb,\\" the Cynocephali are among the monsters used in Caligula's attack on Camp Jupiter. * In The Mummy Returns The Scorpion King leads an Army of Jackal Headed Warriors called the Army of Anubis also it is revealed that the only way to kill these creatures is through decapitation * Paolo Bacigalupi's Ship Breaker trilogy features a race of half-men created for war.

There have been two Chelsea Bridges, on the site of what was an ancient ford. The first Chelsea Bridge was proposed in the 1840s as part of a major development of marshlands on the south bank of the Thames into the new Battersea Park. It was a suspension bridge intended to provide convenient access from the densely populated north bank to the new park. Although built and operated by the government, tolls were charged initially in an effort to recoup the cost of the bridge. Work on the nearby Chelsea Embankment delayed construction and so the bridge, initially called Victoria Bridge, did not open until 1858. Although well-received architecturally, as a toll bridge it was unpopular with the public, and Parliament felt obliged to make it toll-free on Sundays. The bridge was less of a commercial success than had been anticipated, partly because of competition from the newly built Albert Bridge nearby. It was acquired by the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1877, and the tolls were abolished in 1879. The bridge was narrow and structurally unsound, leading the authorities to rename it Chelsea Bridge to avoid the Royal Family's association with a potential collapse. In 1926 it was proposed that the old bridge be rebuilt or replaced, due to the increased volume of users from population growth, and the introduction of the automobile. It was demolished during 1934‚Äì1937, and replaced by the current structure, which opened in 1937. The new bridge was the first self-anchored suspension bridge in Britain, and was built entirely with materials sourced from within the British Empire. During the early 1950s it became popular with motorcyclists, who staged regular races across the bridge. One such meeting in 1970 erupted into violence, resulting in the death of one man and the imprisonment of 20 others. Chelsea Bridge is floodlit from below during the hours of darkness, when the towers and cables are illuminated by of light-emitting diodes. In 2008 it achieved Grade II listed status. In 2004 a footbridge was opened beneath the southern span, carrying the Thames Path under the bridge.  Background  Chelsea and Battersea in 1891, showing (left to right) Old Battersea Bridge, Albert Bridge, Victoria (now Chelsea) Bridge and Grosvenor Railway Bridge. The Red House Inn was an isolated inn on the south bank of the River Thames in the marshlands by Battersea fields, about east of the developed street of the prosperous farming village of Battersea. Not on any major road, its isolation and lack of any police presence made it a popular destination for visitors from London and Westminster since the 16th century, who would travel to the Red House by wherry, attracted by Sunday dog fighting, bare-knuckle boxing bouts and illegal horse racing. Because of its lawless nature, Battersea Fields was also a popular area for duelling, and was the venue for the 1829 duel between the then Prime Minister the Duke of Wellington and the Earl of Winchilsea. The town of Chelsea, on the north bank of the Thames about west of Westminster, was an important industrial centre. Although by the 19th century its role as the centre of the British porcelain industry had been overtaken by the West Midlands, its riverside location and good roads made it an important centre for the manufacture of goods to serve the nearby and rapidly growing London. The Chelsea Waterworks Company occupied a site on the north bank of the Thames opposite the Red House Inn. Founded in 1723, the company pumped water from the Thames to reservoirs around Westminster through a network of hollow elm trunks. As London spread westwards, the former farmland to the west became increasingly populated, and the Thames became seriously polluted with sewage and animal carcasses. In 1852 Parliament banned water from being taken from the Thames downstream of Teddington, forcing the Chelsea Waterworks Company to move upstream to Seething Wells. Since 1771, Battersea and Chelsea had been linked by the modest wooden Battersea Bridge. As London grew following the advent of the railways, Chelsea began to become congested, and in 1842 the Commission of Woods, Forests, and Land Revenues recommended the building of an embankment at Chelsea to free new land for development, and proposed the building of a new bridge downstream of Battersea Bridge and the replacement of Battersea Bridge with a more modern structure. = Battersea Park = In the early 1840s Thomas Cubitt and James Pennethorne had proposed a plan to use 150,000 tons of rocks and earth from the excavation of the Royal Victoria Dock to infill the marshy Battersea Fields and create a large public park to serve the growing population of Chelsea. In 1846 the Commissioners of Woods and Forests purchased the Red House Inn and of surrounding land, and work began on the development that would become Battersea Park. It was expected that with the opening of the park the volume of cross river traffic would increase significantly, putting further strain on the dilapidated Battersea Bridge. Consequently, in 1846 an Act of Parliament authorised the building of a new toll bridge on the site of an ancient ford exactly downstream of Battersea Bridge. The approach road on the southern side was to run along the side of the new park, while that on the northern side was to run from Sloane Square, through the former Chelsea Waterworks site, to the new bridge. Although previous toll bridges in the area had been built and operated by private companies, the new bridge was to be built and operated by the government, under the control of the Metropolitan Improvement Commission, despite protests in Parliament from Radicals objecting to the Government profiting from a toll- paying bridge. It was intended that the bridge would be made toll-free once the costs of building it had been recouped.  Victoria Bridge (Old Chelsea Bridge)  Engineer Thomas Page was appointed to build the bridge, and presented the Commission with several potential designs, including a seven- span stone bridge, a five-span cast iron arch bridge, and a suspension bridge. The Commission selected the suspension bridge design, and work began in 1851 on the new bridge, to be called the Victoria Bridge. = Design and construction = The first Chelsea Bridge as seen from Battersea in 1858, shortly after opening. The Victoria Tower of the Palace of Westminster is shown under construction in the background. Page's design was typical of suspension bridges of the period, and consisted of a wrought iron deck and four cast iron towers supporting chains, which in turn supported the weight of the deck. The towers rested on a pair of timber and cast iron piers. The towers passed through the deck, meaning that between the towers the road was narrower than on the rest of the bridge. Although work had begun in 1851 delays in the closure of the Chelsea Waterworks, which only completed its relocation to Seething Wells in 1856, caused lengthy delays to the project, and the Edinburgh-made ironwork was only transported to the site in 1856. The Battersea Shield Victoria Bridge was long with a central span of , and the roadway was wide with a footpath on either side, making a total width of . Large lamps were set at the tops of the four towers, which were only to be lit when Queen Victoria was spending the night in London. The central span was inscribed with the date of construction and the words \\"Gloria Deo in Excelsis\\" (\\"Glory to God in the Highest\\"). It took seven years to build, at a total cost of ¬£90,000 (about ¬£ in ). The controversial tolls were collected from octagonal stone tollhouses at each end of the bridge. As with the earlier construction of nearby Battersea Bridge, during excavations workers found large quantities of Roman and Celtic weapons and skeletons in the riverbed, leading many historians to conclude that the area was the site of Julius Caesar's crossing of the Thames during the 54 BC invasion of Britain. The most significant item found was the Celtic La T√®ne style bronze and enamel Battersea Shield, one of the most important pieces of Celtic military equipment found in Britain, recovered from the riverbed during dredging for the piers. = Opening = On 31 March 1858 Queen Victoria, accompanied by two of her daughters and en route to the formal opening of Battersea Park, crossed the new bridge and declared it officially open, naming it the Victoria Bridge; it was opened to the public three days later, on 3 April 1858. The design met with great critical acclaim, particularly from the Illustrated London News. Shortly after its opening, concerns were raised about the bridge's safety. Following an inspection by John Hawkshaw and Edwin Clark in 1861, an additional support chain was added on each side. Despite the strengthening there were still concerns about its soundness, and a weight limit of 5 tons was imposed. At the same time, the name was changed from Victoria Bridge to Chelsea Bridge, as the government was concerned about the reliability of suspension bridges and did not want a potential collapse to be associated with the Queen. Battersea (top), Victoria (centre) and Vauxhall (bottom) bridges, 1859 Although reasonably well used, it was unpopular with the public, who objected to being obliged to pay tolls to use it. On 4 July 1857, almost a year before the bridge's opening, a demonstration against the tolls attracted 6,000 residents. Concerns were raised in Parliament that poorer industrial workers in Chelsea, which had no large parks of its own, would be unable to afford to use the new park in Battersea. Bowing to public pressure, shortly after the bridge opened Parliament declared it free to use for pedestrians on Sundays, and in 1875 it was also made toll-free on public holidays. Additionally, because the main lights were only turned on when Queen Victoria was staying in London, it was poorly used at night. Despite this, the new Battersea Park was extremely popular, particularly the sporting facilities; on 9 January 1864 the park staged the world's first official game of association football. = Abolition of tolls = In 1873 the privately owned Albert Bridge, between Chelsea and Battersea bridges, opened. Although Albert Bridge was not as successful as intended at luring customers from Chelsea Bridge and soon found itself in serious financial difficulties, it nonetheless caused a sharp drop in usage of Chelsea Bridge. In 1877 the Metropolis Toll Bridges Act was passed, which allowed the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW) to buy all London bridges between Hammersmith and Waterloo bridges and free them from tolls. Ownership of Chelsea Bridge was transferred to the MBW in 1877 at a cost of ¬£75,000 (about ¬£ in ), and on 24 May 1879 Chelsea Bridge, Battersea Bridge and Albert Bridge were declared toll free by the Prince of Wales in a brief ceremony, after which a parade of Chelsea Pensioners marched across the bridge to Battersea Park. By the early 20th century, Chelsea Bridge was in poor condition. It was unable to carry the increasing volume of traffic caused by the growth of London and the increasing popularity of the automobile; between 1914 and 1929 use of the bridge almost doubled from 6,500 to 12,600 vehicles per day. In addition, parts of its structure were beginning to work loose, and in 1922 the gilded finials on the towers had to be removed because of concerns that they would fall off. Architectural opinion had turned heavily against Victorian styles and Chelsea Bridge was now deeply unpopular with architects; former President of the Royal Institute of British Architects Reginald Blomfield spoke vehemently against its design in 1921, and there were few people supporting the preservation of the old bridge. In 1926 the Royal Commission on Cross-river Traffic recommended that Chelsea Bridge be rebuilt or replaced.  New Chelsea Bridge  With four lanes of traffic, the new bridge's roadway is much wider than that of its predecessor. In 1931 the London County Council (LCC) proposed demolishing Chelsea Bridge and replacing it with a modern six-lane bridge at a cost of ¬£695,000 (about ¬£ in ). Because of the economic crisis of the Great Depression the Ministry of Transport refused to fund the project and the LCC was unable to raise the funds elsewhere. However, in an effort to boost employment in the Battersea area, which had suffered badly in the depression, the Ministry of Transport agreed to underwrite 60% of the costs of a cheaper four-lane bridge costing ¬£365,000 (about ¬£ in ), on condition that all materials used in the building of the bridge be sourced from within the British Empire. = Design and construction = Being self-anchored, the bridge uniquely in London has no anchoring abutments. In 1934 a temporary footbridge which had previously been used during rebuilding works on Lambeth Bridge was moved into place alongside Chelsea Bridge, and demolition began. The new bridge, also called Chelsea Bridge, was designed by LCC architects G. Topham Forrest and E. P. Wheeler and built by Holloway Brothers (London). Much wider than the older bridge at wide, it has a wide roadway and two wide pavements cantilevered out from the sides of the bridge. Uniquely in London, Chelsea Bridge is a self-anchored suspension bridge, the first of the type to be built in Britain. The horizontal stresses are absorbed by stiffening girders in the deck itself and the suspension cables are not anchored to the ground, relieving stress on the abutments which are built on soft and unstable London clay. The piers of the new bridge were built on the site of the old bridge's piers, and are built of concrete, faced with granite above the low-water point. Each side of the bridge has a single suspension cable, each made up of 37 1-inch (23mm) diameter wire ropes bundled to form a hexagonal cable. As was agreed with the Ministry of Transport, all materials used in the bridge came from the British Empire; the steel came from Scotland and Yorkshire, the granite of the piers from Aberdeen and Cornwall, the timbers of the deck from British Columbia and the asphalt of the roadway from Trinidad. As a self-anchored bridge, the suspension cables attach directly to the deck and do not extend to the ground. Because the self-anchored structure relies on the roadway itself to absorb stresses, the suspension cables could not be installed until the roadway was built; however, until the cables were in place the roadway could not be supported. To resolve this problem, Topham had the roadway built in sections, supported on very tall barges. The barges were floated into place at low tide, and the rising tide was used to lift the sections above the height of the piers. As the tide ebbed, the roadway dropped into place. The recently built Battersea Power Station then dominated most views of the area, so it was decided that the bridge's appearance was unimportant. Consequently, in contrast to the heavily ornamented 1858 bridge, the new bridge has a starkly utilitarian design and the only ornamentation consists of two ornamental lamp posts at each entrance. Each features a gilded galleon on top of a coat of arms. The outward facing sides of all four posts show the LCC coat of arms of the Lion of England, St George's Cross and the barry wavy lines representing the Thames; the inward faces on the south side show the dove of peace of the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea, that on the northwest corner shows the winged bull, lion, boars' heads and stag of the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea, and that on the northeast corner the portcullis and Tudor roses of the Metropolitan Borough of Westminster. Coat of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea on a Chelsea Bridge lamp post The new bridge was completed five months ahead of schedule and within the ¬£365,000 budget. It was opened on 6 May 1937 by the Prime Minister of Canada, William Lyon Mackenzie King, who was in London for the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. = Temporary wartime bridge = Two years after the bridge's opening the Second World War broke out. Because of their close proximity to Chelsea Barracks it was expected that enemy bombers would target the three road bridges in the area, and a temporary bridge was built parallel to Chelsea Bridge. As with the four other temporary Thames bridges built in this period, it was built of steel girders supported by wooden stakes; however, despite its flimsy appearance it was a sturdy structure, capable of supporting tanks and other heavy military equipment. As it turned out, no enemy action took place in the area, and all three bridges survived the war undamaged. The temporary bridge was dismantled in 1945. = Motorcycle gangs = Beginning in the 1950s, Chelsea Bridge became a favourite meeting place for motorcyclists, who would race across the bridge on Friday nights. On 17 October 1970 a serious confrontation took place on Chelsea Bridge between the Essex and Chelsea chapters of the Hells Angels, and rival motorcycle gangs the Road Rats, Nightingales, Windsor Angels and Jokers. Around 50 people took part in the fight; weapons used included motorcycle chains, flick knives and at least one spiked flail. One member of the Jokers was shot with a sawn-off shotgun and fatally wounded, and 20 of those present were sentenced to between one and twelve years' imprisonment.  Present-day  Chelsea Bridge's illuminations In the 1970s Chelsea Bridge was painted bright red and white, prompting a number of complaints from Chelsea F.C. fans that Chelsea Bridge had been painted in Arsenal colours. In 2007 it was redecorated in a less controversial red, blue and white colour scheme. Chelsea Bridge is now floodlit from beneath at night and of light-emitting diodes strung along the towers and suspension chains, intended to complement the illuminations of the nearby Albert Bridge. Although motorcyclists still meet on the bridge, following complaints from residents about the noise their racing has been curtailed. Chelsea Bridge was declared a Grade II listed structure in 2008, providing protection to preserve its character from further alteration. Battersea Park still retains Cubitt and Pennethorne's original layout and features, including a riverfront promenade, a formal avenue through the centre of the park and multiple animal enclosures. On the eastern side of the bridge, at the southern end, a major new residential development of 600 homes called Chelsea Bridge Wharf has been built, as part of long-term plans to regenerate the long-derelict former industrial sites around Battersea Power Station. = Battersea footbridge = Battersea footbridge curves beneath Chelsea Bridge. To link the new developments around Battersea Power Station to Battersea Park, in 2004 a curved footbridge was built beneath the southern end of Chelsea Bridge. The footbridge was built offsite in four sections, transported by road to the King George V Dock where it was assembled, and the completed structure floated down the river and hoisted into position. It is planned that once the riverfront in the area has been opened to the public, following the completion of the rebuilding of Battersea Power Station into a commercial development, the new bridge will form part of the Thames Path. The new bridge curves out from the bank, overhanging the river bank by , and cost ¬£600,000 to build.

It ceased to exist after the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland of 1939. In its long history, National Democracy went through several stages of development. Created with the intention of promoting the fight for Poland's sovereignty against the repressive imperial regimes, the movement acquired its right-wing nationalist character following the return to independence. A founder and principal ideologue was Roman Dmowski. Other ideological fathers of the movement included Zygmunt Balicki and Jan Ludwik Pop≈Çawski. The National Democracy's main stronghold was Greater Poland (western Poland), where much of the movement's early impetus derived from efforts to counter Imperial Germany's policy of Germanizing its Polish territorial holdings. Later, the ND's focus would shift to countering what it saw as Polish-Jewish economic competition with Catholic Poles. Party support was made up of the ethnically Polish intelligentsia, the urban lower middle class, some elements of the greater middle class, and its extensive youth movement. During the interbellum Second Republic, the ND was a strong proponent for the Polonization of the country's German minority and of other non-Polish (chiefly Ukrainian and Belarusian) populations in Poland's eastern border regions (the Kresy). With the end of World War II and the occupation of the country by the Soviet Union and its communist puppet regime, the National Democracy movement effectively ceased to exist.  Origins  The origins of the ND can be traced to the 1864 failure of the January 1863 Uprising and to the era of Positivism in Poland. After that Uprising ‚Äì the last in a series of 19th-century Polish uprisings ‚Äì had been bloodily crushed by Poland's partitioners, a new generation of Polish patriots and politicians concluded that Poland's independence would not be won through force on the battlefield, but through education and culture. In 1886 the secret Polish League (Liga Polska) was founded. In 1893 it was renamed National League (Liga Narodowa). From 1895 the League published a newspaper, PrzeglƒÖd Wszechpolski (The All-Polish Review), and from 1897 it had an official political party, the National-Democratic Party (Stronnictwo Narodowo-Demokratyczne). Unlike the Polish Socialist Party (PPS), the ND advocated peaceful negotiations, not armed resistance. Influenced by Roman Dmowski's radical nationalist and social-Darwinist ideas, National Democrats soon turned against other nationalities within the Polish lands, most notably the Jews; anti-Semitism became an element of ND ideology. During World War I, while the PPS under J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski supported the Central Powers against Russia (through the Polish Legions), the ND first allied itself with the Russian Empire (supporting the creation of the Pu≈Çawy Legion) and later with the Western Powers (supporting the Polish Blue Army in France). At war's end, many ND politicians enjoyed more influence abroad than in Poland. This allowed them to use their leverage to share power with Pi≈Çsudski, who had much more support in the military and in the country proper than they did. And because of their support abroad ND politicians such as Dmowski and Ignacy Paderewski were able to gain backing for their demands at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and in the Treaty of Versailles.  Second Republic  In the newly independent Second Polish Republic, the ND was represented first by the Popular National Union (ZwiƒÖzek Ludowo-Narodowy), a conservative political party advocating their program through democratic and parliamentary political means. After Pi≈Çsudski's May 1926 Coup d'√âtat, the ND found itself in constant opposition to his Sanacja government. The tightening of Sanacja's controls on opposition parties and its general authoritarian drift led to the gradual radicalization of the ND movement. In December 1926, the Camp of Great Poland (Ob√≥z Wielkiej Polski) was created as an extra-parliamentary organization in opposition to the Sanacja government. The youth faction of the Camp of Great Poland gradually took control over the whole organization, and from 1931 the camp quickly radicalized and even adopted some militaristic elements. In 1928 the National Party (Stronnictwo Narodowe) was founded, as a successor party to the Popular National Union. In the beginning, the new party adopted the same political line as its predecessor. After the official banning of the Camp of Great Poland, radicalized youth entered the National Party. The ideological clash between the old and new generation of National Democrats culminated at the party convention in 1935 where the younger activists were elected to lead the party. In 1936-1939 the personnel changes within the party continued, and the young generation totally began its complete domination. The older generation of National Democrats, disagreeing with the new course, left active politics or exited the party completely. A chief characteristic of ND policies at this time was their emphasis on Polonization of minorities: ND politicians such as Dmowski and Stanis≈Çaw Grabski contributed to the failure of Pi≈Çsudski's proposed Miƒôdzymorze federation and the alliance with the Ukrainian leader Symon Petlura, as well as to the alienation of Poland's ethnic minorities. Simultaneously the ND emphasized its anti-Semitic stance, intending to exclude Jews from Polish social and economic life and ultimately to push them to emigration out of Poland. Antisemitic actions and incidents ‚Äì boycotts, demonstrations, even attacks ‚Äì organized or inspired by National Democrats occurred during the 1930s. The most notorious actions were taken by a splinter group of radical young former NDs who formed the fascist-inspired National Radical Camp (Ob√≥z Narodowo-Radykalny).  World War II  During World War II, the ND became part of a coalition which formed the Polish Government in Exile. It was closely linked with the National Armed Forces (Narodowe Si≈Çy Zbrojne), an underground organization that became part of the Polish resistance movement. ND armed organizations fought not only against Nazi Germany but also against the Soviet Union. Both occupying forces regarded members of the movement as their mortal enemy, and its leaders were hunted down and killed in mass executions, in concentration camps, and in the Katy≈Ñ massacre. Among those killed are: * Leopold Bie≈Ñkowski (father of Zygmunt Witymir Bie≈Ñkowski), arrested by the NKVD in early 1940, died in a Gulag near Arkhangelsk in 1941 * reverend Feliks Bolt, a senator of the Republic of Poland, died in Stutthof in 1940 * Tadeusz Fabiani, a lawyer, shot at Pawiak in 1940 * Stanis≈Çaw G≈ÇƒÖbi≈Ñski, died in NKVD prison in Lubyanka in 1940 * doctor Wincenty Harembski, shot in NKVD prison in Kharkiv in 1940 * Tadeusz Zygmunt Hernes, journalist, killed in Katy≈Ñ massacre * Czes≈Çaw J√≥≈∫wiak, murdered by the Gestapo in 1940 in Dresden prison * Jan Mosdorf, Auschwitz * reverend Marceli Nowakowski, shot in Warsaw in December 1939 * Stanis≈Çaw Piasecki, writer, shot in Palmiry in June 1941 * reverend J√≥zef PrƒÖdzy≈Ñski, died in the Dachau concentration camp in 1942 * Jozefat Sikorski, murdered by the Gestapo in the Berlin-Plotzensee prison in 1942 * Micha≈Ç Starczewski, murdered in the Katyn massacre * Tadeusz Szefer, murdered in the Katyn massacre * Jan Szturmowski, murdered by the Germans in September 1939 * Jan Wali≈Ñski, murdered by the NKVD in Kharkiv in 1940 * Antoni Wolniewicz, murdered by the Gestapo in the Berlin-Plotzensee prison in 1942 * Jan Wujastyk, murdered in the Katy≈Ñ massacre =Righteous among the Nations= * Edward Kemnitz * Marceli Godlewski  After the war  After the war, when a communist, pro-Soviet government took power in Poland, most remaining NDs either emigrated to the West or continued to oppose the Soviet communist puppet regime. Others joined the new regime ‚Äì most notably, the RNR-Falanga leader Boles≈Çaw Piasecki, who co-organized a Catholic movement.  Today's Poland  Since the fall of communism, with Poland once again a democratically governed country, several political parties have sought to re-establish some ND traditions; their adherents prefer to call themselves the \\"national movement\\" (ruch narodowy). The only significant party that declared itself a successor to the ND was the League of Polish Families (Liga Polskich Rodzin) , founded in 2001 by Roman Giertych, grandson of Jƒôdrzej Giertych, a pre-war ND politician. It received 8% of the parliamentary vote in 2001 and 16% in 2004, but then fell below the 5% threshold in 2007 and lost all its parliamentary seats. Another Polish national-democratic association with legal standing is the Camp of Great Poland. The association was established on March 28, 2003, as a response of the National Party (Stronnictwo Narodowe; SN) Youth Section to the deletion of the party from the national registry. Polish Club Online ‚Äì Wywiad z PrzewodniczƒÖcym Obozu Wielkiej Polski ‚Äì Dawidem Berezicki On February 17, 2012 the OWP was registered in the National Registrar of Companies and Legal Entities (Krajowy Rejestr SƒÖdowy; KRS), Official KRS Website gaining legal personality. Today the main party promoting National Democracy is the National Movement. The party was formed originally as a nationalist coalition by Robert Winnicki, Krzysztof Bosak, and other defectors from the LPR. As of 2019 it has 5 deputies in the Sejm.

Retrieved on January 20, 2020. Each Dave & Buster's has a full-service restaurant and a video arcade. As of , the company has 136 locations in the United States and Canada. History The first Dave & Buster's was opened in Dallas in 1982 by David Corriveau and James \\"Buster\\" Corley. Corley had previously operated a bar called \\"Buster's\\" in Little Rock, Arkansas, next door to a saloon and game parlor called \\"Cash McCool's\\", owned by Corriveau. After opening Dave & Buster's, the two operated as co-CEOs. In 1989, Edison Brothers Stores purchased a majority ownership in the restaurant to finance further expansion into other cities. Dave & Buster's was spun off from Edison Brothers, and went public with Andy Newman as chairman in 1995. By 1997 the chain had ten locations across the country. D&B; acquired nine Jillian's locations after Jillian's filed for Chapter 11 BankruptcyDallas Business Journal: Sept 24, 2004-Dave & Busters and Gemini Investors to purchase Jillian's assets Houston Business Journal: Oct 8, 2004-Dave & Buster's to turn out the lights on Katy Mills Jillian's in 2004. Seven of these Jillian's locations were rebranded with the Dave & Buster's name, while two were closed following the acquisition. The company announced on December 8, 2005, that it would be acquired by private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. On July 16, 2008, Dave & Buster's Holdings Inc, filed with the SEC to again become a publicly traded company.Dave & Buster's owner seeks to go public again. The company had set a date for the Initial public offering IPO of October 5, 2012. However, it pulled out right before it opened. In June 2010, Oak Hill Capital Partners, in partnership with the company's management team, completed its acquisition of Dave & Buster's from Wellspring Capital Management. In October 2014, Dave & Buster's launched a second IPO, selling 5.88 million shares at an offering price range of $16‚Äì18. The offering raised $94 million, to be used for debt repayments. Shares are traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange using the symbol PLAY. On March 20, 2020, Dave & Buster's temporarily closed all locations due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Dave and Busters Coronavirus COVID 19 Protocols response Locations have been reopening since May 2020.

All D&Bs; offer full bar service. =Games= Dave & Buster's dubbed their arcade section \\"Million Dollar Midway\\" which features interactive games and simulators. In 1997, Dave & Buster's introduced the Power Card, a declining balance card or 'debit card' that replaces traditional tokens and tickets, and is required to activate most arcade games and can be reloaded at so called \\"power stations\\". The Power Card is intended to enable customers to activate games more easily and encourage extended play of games to increase customer spending. By replacing most coin operations, the Power Card has reduced the technical difficulties and maintenance issues associated with coin-operated equipment.

Its local government area is the Shire of Yarra Ranges. At the 2016 Census, Belgrave had a population of 3,929.  History  Belgrave is situated in the foothills of the Dandenong Ranges, part of the land of the Wurundjeri first nations people. Belgrave was first settled by Europeans in 1851. Belgrave was named after an 1840s chapel in Leeds, Yorkshire, England; the name was carried by Mr and Mrs R.G. Benson when they came to Melbourne in 1856. Their sons, the Benson Brothers, settled in the Belgrave district in the 1870s. Though originally the area was known as \\"Monbulk\\" for the reservoir that lay near by, the town wasn't known as Belgrave until around 1903, and another suggested name for the town at that stage was Glassford.Reflections of the Past - Volume 3 A Post Office opened in the area around 1904. Many men from Belgrave went to the two world wars, and there is a war memorial in Belgrave.  McDonald's rejection  In 1993, the Shire of Sherbrooke prepared a site specific amendment for land adjoining the Belgrave roundabout to facilitate the development of a 70-seat McDonald's restaurant including drive-through. The proposal was unpopular attracting many objections from within the local community. The Panel approved the proposal but disallowed the drive-through. McDonald's decided not to proceed with the development. Application for a nearly identical proposal by the site owner was approved by Yarra Ranges Council in 1996 but lost on appeal at the Victorian Administrative Appeals Tribunal.  Business  Most of the commercial district of Belgrave is located on Main Street, which is at the end of Burwood Highway. There are also shops on Bayview Road, which is located just across the rail bridge. Belgrave has galleries and bookshops.

Public reserves Public reserves in Belgrave include Belgrave Lake Park, Belgrave Recreation Reserve, Borthwick Park, Violet Larsen Reserve and Dandenong Ranges National Park. = Belgrave Lake Park = Biodiversity A small reserve surrounding Belgrave Lake and located south of Belgrave town centre. It is an important biolink between Dandenong Ranges National Park and Birdsland as well as Lysterfield Lake Park. The park has a combined focus of recreation and conservation. Monbulk creek flows through the area and is important for wildlife such as platypus and water rat. In the trees, arboreal mammals include the sugar glider and also would have been a habitat for the yellow-bellied glider. The reserve is dominated by Eucalyptus cypellocarpa (mountain grey gum) on the slopes. Along the riparian zone (adjacent to creek) the dominant plant species are Eucalyptus viminalis subsp. viminalis (manna gum), Acacia dealbata (silver wattle). History Belgrave Lake was constructed in 1893 to supply water to Dandenong. Water flowed by pipeline to Heany Park in Rowville and then by aqueduct and pipeline through Churchill Park and on to Dandenong. From 1924 water supply to Dandenong was discontinued but the pipeline continued to supply water to farms in the Lysterfield area. Fern Tree Gully Shire leased the pipeline from 1940 to 1950. The pipeline was still in use in the 1970s and was closed some time after that.

This corridor is primarily located on the riparian zone (the area adjacent to the creek). This provides habitat to many different environments aquatic, creek banks and the floodplain. These different elements can be separated into Abiotic (Non-living things) and Biotic (living things). The abiotic factors (such as climate, rocks, debris, water, etc.) and the biotic factors (flora and fauna) and the interactions between the two make up an ecosystem.

Its local government area is the Shire of Yarra Ranges. At the 2016 census, Ferny Creek had a population of 1,518. The suburb is built around and to the south of Dunns Hill (height 561m) with most of Ferny Creek lying between 400 and 500 metres above sea level. It is named after Ferny Creek, a small stream which originates to the south of Dunns Hill in the centre of the suburb. The suburb of Ferny Creek is largely surrounded by conservation zones and national parks, with the Dandenong Ranges national park on its northern and western sides, the Upwey habitat corridor to the south and Sherbrooke Forest to the east. History For at least 35,000 years, the Wurundjeri people have been the traditional custodians of the land within the Yarra Ranges including Ferny Creek. Europeans settlers established themselves there from the 1830s, pursuing gold along the rivers and carving out productive agricultural lands. Later prominent Melbourne figures built weekend cottages in the region. Ferny Creek is well known for its established European gardens, and beautiful range of native fauna and flora. The Post Office opened around August 1904 as One Tree Hill, and was subsequently renamed Ferny Creek. Flora and biodiversity Ferny Creek contains a wide range of microclimates and aspects, and as a result the flora is similar to that of the larger Dandenong Ranges as a whole. The Dandenong Ranges National park including Sherbrooke Forest, contains large areas of native vegetation and is dominated by a mix of wet and dry Sclerophyll forests. There are small pockets of wet temperate rainforest in the deeper gullies (bordering Sherbrooke, Mast Gully and Ferny Creeks). Weeds remain a significant threat to biodiversity, with significant infestations of Ivy, onion weed, tradescantia and holly. A number of conservation groups are active in the local area including the Friends of Ferny Creek and Friends of Sherbrooke Forest . Outside of the conservation zones and national park, Ferny Creek is largely covered by exotic vegetation with remnant native trees. Public Land Dandenong Ranges National Park and Ferny Creek Recreation Reserve. Dandenong Ranges National park is managed primary for conservation purposes and secondarily for recreation. However Ferny Creek Reserve has mainly recreational function. Ferny Creek Reserve is maintained by local residents on behalf of the Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE), and contains a Bureau of Meteorology weather station. The town today While a suburb of Melbourne, extensive parks, large residential blocks and the lack of commercial activity means that Ferny Creek maintains a rural character. There are a number of bed and breakfast located in Ferny Creek, Ferny Creek Primary School and a General Store. There is also a Country Fire Authority (CFA) fire station, (Sassafras-Ferny Creek Fire Brigade), Scout group (1st Ferny Creek), tennis club, recreation reserve and plant nursery, as well as a World War One Memorial. Ferny Creek has a number of homes of note, particularly around Kallamondah and Mount Dandenong Tourist Roads. Ferny Creek is home to a popular attraction known as \\"The Thousand Steps\\" - a bushwalking track built by Australian Army Engineers that runs through the Ferntree Gully National Park and provides a fitness challenge to those who attempt it. The steps begin at the bottom of the hill in Upper Ferntree Gully and the top of the steps being located at Ferny Creek near One Tree Hill. The track is a minute representation of the ordeals suffered by the Australian Army in Kokoda during World War Two. Together with its neighbouring township Olinda Ferny Creek has an Australian Rules football team (Olinda-Ferny Creek) competing in the Yarra Valley Mountain District Football League. Climate Snow in Ferny Creek, Victoria, Australia, 10 August 2008 Ferny Creek's climate is cool and wet, with temperature extremes rare due to the proximity of Port Phillip Bay and Bass Strait. Rainfall is fairly uniform through the year, tending to peak between April and October with lower rainfall during the months of January and February. The mean annual rainfall is between 1100 and 1500 mm, increasing with elevation and from west to east. The elevation means that temperatures are typically 3 to 5 degrees C cooler than the lower suburbs of Melbourne, to the west of Ferny Creek. As a result of its elevation snow typically falls one or two times a year, mostly between the months of June and October. A rare summer snow occurred on Christmas Day 2006 . The local region has experienced substantial warming in recent decades and heavy snowfalls which were once common have become rare. The last significant snowfall to affect Ferny Creek was on 10 August 2008 when as much as 15 cm of snow fell around Dunns Hill. A Bureau of Meteorology weather station sits at an elevation of 513 m in the Ferny Creek Reserve. Bushfires Ferny Creek was among the suburbs affected by a series of deliberately lit fires in the Dandenong Ranges on 21 January 1997, and has been affected by numerous bushfires throughout settlement. The community of Ferny Creek is close and resilient, as proved in its recovery from the fires that destroyed 42 homes and killed three local residents (Genevieve Erin, Graham and Jenny Lindroth). The fires were deliberately lit in bushland below the settlement on Tuesday 21 January 1997, and in the extreme conditions of that day, raced up the steep slopes and were burning gardens and property before most residents were even aware of a problem. After the bushfires the small community rallied together for a fundraising event held at the local Ferny Creek Reserve and Tennis Club. Money was raised for families who lost their houses and personal items in the devastation. Since that time, residents have focused their efforts on making responsible choices when considering their fire safety plans and in addition to having a significantly higher than average membership rate of CFA's Community Fire Guard program, and a pro-active approach to keeping properties prepared, the Ferny Creek Bushfire Alert System was installed to provide a siren signal to alert residents to the possibility of a threat to their safety. Residents are educated to respond appropriately to the siren by simply seeking further information via another source (radio, internet, phone tree, scanner, television, personal investigation etc.). It is not a signal to evacuate. The Alert System is a unique co-operative project between residents, Shire of Yarra Ranges, CFA, Victoria Police, Dept of Justice and Parks Victoria. Education There is one primary school located in this area called \\"Ferny Creek Primary School\\". The school was established in 1895 and as of 2018 has 202 students; 109 boys and 93 girls.

Drawing on Greek Stoic sources, the Latin writer Varro distinguished three forms of such discourse: mythical (concerning the myths of the Greek gods), rational (philosophical analysis of the gods and of cosmology) and civil (concerning the rites and duties of public religious observance).As cited by Augustine, City of God, Book 6, ch.5. Some Latin Christian authors, such as Tertullian and Augustine, followed Varro's threefold usage,See Augustine, City of God, Book 6, ch.5. and Tertullian, Ad Nationes, Book 2, ch.1. though Augustine also used the term more simply to mean 'reasoning or discussion concerning the deity'City of God Book VIII. i. \\"de divinitate rationem sive sermonem\\" In patristic Greek Christian sources, theologia could refer narrowly to devout and inspired knowledge of, and teaching about, the essential nature of God.Gregory of Nazianzus uses the word in this sense in his fourth-century Theological Orations ; after his death, he was called \\"the Theologian\\" at the Council of Chalcedon and thereafter in Eastern Orthodoxy‚Äîeither because his Orationswere seen as crucial examples of this kind of theology, or in the sense that he was (like the author of the Book of Revelation) seen as one who was an inspired preacher of the words of God. (It is unlikely to mean, as claimed in the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers introduction to his Theological Orations, that he was a defender of the divinity of Christ the Word.) See John McGukin, Saint Gregory of Nazianzus: An Intellectual Biography (Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 2001), p.278. The Latin author Boethius, writing in the early 6th century, used theologia to denote a subdivision of philosophy as a subject of academic study, dealing with the motionless, incorporeal reality (as opposed to physica, which deals with corporeal, moving realities). Boethius' definition influenced medieval Latin usage.G.R. Evans, Old Arts and New Theology: The Beginnings of Theology as an Academic Discipline (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980), 31‚Äì32. In scholastic Latin sources, the term came to denote the rational study of the doctrines of the Christian religion, or (more precisely) the academic discipline which investigated the coherence and implications of the language and claims of the Bible and of the theological tradition (the latter often as represented in Peter Lombard's Sentences, a book of extracts from the Church Fathers).See the title of Peter Abelard's Theologia Christiana, and, perhaps most famously, of Thomas Aquinas' Summa Theologica In the Renaissance, especially with Florentine Platonist apologists of Dante's poetics, the distinction between \\"poetic theology\\" (theologia poetica) and \\"revealed\\" or Biblical theology serves as steppingstone for a revival of philosophy as independent of theological authority. It is in this last sense, theology as an academic discipline involving rational study of Christian teaching, that the term passed into English in the fourteenth century,See the 'note' in the Oxford English Dictionary entry for 'theology'. although it could also be used in the narrower sense found in Boethius and the Greek patristic authors, to mean rational study of the essential nature of God ‚Äì a discourse now sometimes called theology proper.See, for example, Charles Hodge, Systematic Theology, vol. 1, part 1 (1871). From the 17th century onwards, it also became possible to use the term theology to refer to study of religious ideas and teachings that are not specifically Christian (e.g., in the term natural theology which denoted theology based on reasoning from natural facts independent of specifically Christian revelationOxford English Dictionary, sense 1) or that are specific to another religion. \\"Theology\\" can also now be used in a derived sense to mean \\"a system of theoretical principles; an (impractical or rigid) ideology\\".Oxford English Dictionary, 1989 edition, 'Theology' sense 1(d), and 'Theological' sense A.3; the earliest reference given is from the 1959 Times Literary Supplement 5 June 329/4: \\"The 'theological' approach to Soviet Marxism ... proves in the long run unsatisfactory.\\" See also *Outline of theology References  External links  * \\"Theology\\" on Encyclop√¶dia Britannica * Chattopadhyay, Subhasis. \\"Reflections on Hindu Theology\\" in Prabuddha Bharata or Awakened India 120(12):664-672 (2014).

After the Second World War, they were gradually replaced by \\"service clubs\\", such as Lions, Apex and Rotary. By the end of the 20th century, most fraternities had been wound up except for the Freemasons and a few lodges of the Buffaloes. Many fraternities also offered insurance to their members and as membership declined, these operations were either combined with other non profit insurance companies or sold with the proceeds being distributed to charitable causes. The reasons for their decline probably have something to do with their male only membership, generational change and bemusement at secretive rites and rituals. All fraternities had different rules and rites, but they all appear to have been complex. The service clubs that succeeded the fraternities also operated as social networks and did fairly similar charitable work. No general history has been written, but some of the many lodges that operated in the state of Victoria were: * Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes * Ancient Order of Druids * Foresters Friendly Society * Freemasons, including United Grand Lodge of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory * Knights of the Southern Cross An order of religious Roman Catholics * Rechabites A fraternity especially for tee-total abstainers from alcohol * Odd Fellows (Independent Order of Odd Fellows or IOOF) Of course in those sectarian times, there had to be two different lodges for those of Irish ancestry: * Ancient Order of Hibernians for Irish Catholics * Loyal Orange Lodge for Protestants Canada * Independent Order of Odd Fellows * Ancient Order of Hibernians * Canadian Fraternal Association * Orange Order * Canadian Order for Home Circles * International Order of Alhambra * Kin Canada * Knights of Columbus * Knights of Pythias * Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes Europe =Denmark= * Independent Order of Odd Fellows * Order Tutor =Sweden= *Independent Order of Odd Fellows *Swedish Order of Freemasons *Samfundet SHT *Delta Sigma =United Kingdom= * Ancient Order of Druids * Grand United Order of Oddfellows Friendly Society * Grand Order of Water Rats * Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity Friendly Society * Orange Order * Order of Druids * United Ancient Order of Druids South Africa * Afrikaner Broederbond *Freemasonry in South Africa United States * Afro-American Sons and Daughters * Aid Association of Lutherans * American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association * American Legion * Ancient Order of Hibernians * Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks (BPOE)Elks lodges in the Philippines and the Canal Zone were founded while those areas were United States territories and/or possessions.

Its local government area is the Shire of Yarra Ranges. At the 2016 Census, Healesville had a population of 7,461. The median age was 44 years. Healesville is situated on the Watts River, a tributary of the Yarra River. History Traffic to the more distant Gippsland and Yarra Valley goldfields in the 1860s resulted in a settlement forming on the Watts River, ...No works have been at present executed upon this permanent line until the track reaches the township of Healesville, near the Watts river... and its survey as a town in 1864. It was named after Richard Heales, the Premier of Victoria from 1860‚Äì1861. The post office opened on 1 May 1865. The town became a setting off point for the Woods Point Goldfield with the construction of the Yarra Track in the 1870s. Climate Present Healesville is well known for the Healesville Sanctuary, a nature park with hundreds of native Australian animals displayed in a semi-open natural setting and an active platypus breeding program. The Yarra Valley Railway operates from Healesville Station on every Sunday, most public holidays and Wednesday to Sunday during school holidays. Schools in Healesville include the Healesville Primary School, St Brigid's Catholic primary school, the rural Chum Creek Primary School, Badger Creek Primary School, Healesville High School and Worawa Aboriginal College, an Aboriginal school whose former students include noted Australian Rules Footballer David Wirrpanda. Much of what is now Healesville lies on the ancestral land of the Wurundjeri people. An Aboriginal reserve known as Coranderrk, set up in 1863, was located just south of the main township.https://www.victorianplaces.com.au/healesville-and-healesville-shire Industries in and around Healesville include sawmilling, horticulture, tourism and viticulture. Healesville has an active CFA (Country Fire Authority) volunteer fire brigade established in 1894. The Healesville Rural Fire Brigade was formed in 1941, and disbanded and membership amalgamated with the Healesville Urban Fire Brigade in 1985. The amalgamation of the Chum Creek Rural Fire Brigade with the Healesville brigade occurred in 1996. The Healesville Fire Brigade now operates a main and a satellite station with members from both the Healesville and Chum Creek areas.

The construction of the Maroondah Dam in the 1920s brought several hundred workmen to Healesville. Their departure and the onset of the 1930s depression exposed Healesville's restricted range of industries. Timber and tourism were not stable enough for sustained growth. Notwithstanding the depression, the 1930s saw increased motor tourism (partly bypassing Healesville) and decreased railway patronage. Only 10% came by rail at Easter 1934. Tourism was still active but a local newspaper commented that Healesville would be \\"heaps better off calling itself the good-time town instead of the world-famed-tourist- resort‚Äîthat's got whiskers on it\\". In modern times Healesville has become a major centre for tourism based around the wine and food industries of the Yarra Valley, with attractions including Healesville Sanctuary, Badger Weir Picnic Area, Yarra Valley Railway, Healesville Organic Market, numerous cafes and restaurants, and volunteer-run events such as the Healesville Music Festival, Open Studios, and the Yarra Valley Rodeo.https://visityarravalley.com.au/badger-weir-picnic- areahttps://visityarravalley.com.au/healesville-organic- markethttps://www.healesvillemusicfestival.com.au/https://www.yarravalleyrodeo.com.au/ The Memo, a centre for community arts and cultural activities, was built in 1924 as a soldier's memorial hall.

the Pusa Institute, is India's national Institute for agricultural research, education and extension. The name Pusa Institute is derived from the fact that the institute was originally located in Pusa Bihar as the Imperial Institute of Agricultural Research in 1911. It was then renamed as the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute in 1919 and following a major earthquake in Pusa, it was relocated to Delhi in 1936. The current institute in Delhi is financed and administered by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). The IARI was responsible for the research leading to the \\"Green Revolution in India\\" of the 1970s. History Logo of the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute Imperial Agricultural Research Institute, at its original location Pusa, Bihar, circa 1927 The institute was established in 1905 at Pusa, Bihar, with the financial assistance of Henry Phipps, Jr., an American philanthropist. Phipps was a family friend of Lady Curzon, the daughter of an American millionaire, and the wife of Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India. Phipps stayed as a guest of the Curzons during his visit to India. More importantly, Phipps left behind with them a donation of $30,000, which was used to establish the institute. He laid the foundation stone of the Agricultural Research Institute and college on 1 April 1905. The Institute was originally called the Agricultural Research Institute (ARI). Its name was changed to the Imperial Institute of Agricultural Research in 1911, and to the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute in 1919. A reason for establishing it in Pusa in northern Bihar was the proximity to the indigo plantations which were in need of revival after the German synthesis of aniline in 1899. One of the first scientists to be deputed to the institute was the English chemist John Walter Leather in 1892. However, the institute was damaged during the devastating Bihar earthquake of 15 January 1934. The Secretary of State approved the transfer in July, 1934. The Standing Finance Committee of the Union Assembly finally announced on 25 August 1934 in Shimla, the decision to shift the institute to New Delhi at the approximate cost of . to a place that is now called Pusa in New Delhi. B. Viswanath was the Director at that time. He also happened to be first Indian Director of IARI. The new campus at New Delhi was inaugurated on 29 July 1936, while the new building of the Imperial Institute of Agricultural Research was inaugurated by the then Viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow on 7 November 1936. =Post-independence: 1947‚Äìpresent= Post-independence, the institute was renamed the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, and in 1950 the Shimla sub-station of institute developed Rust-resistant varieties of wheat, including Pusa 718, 737, 745, and 760. In 1958, it was recognized as a \\"deemed university\\" under the UGC act of 1956 of Parliament and since then it has awarded MSc and PhD degrees. What remained of the institute at the original location was downgraded to an agricultural research station until 1970, when the Government of Bihar established the Rajendra Agricultural University at the location. Overview It will serve the cause of science and society with distinction through first rate research, generation of appropriate technologies and development of human resources. In fact, the Green Revolution was born in the fields of IARI and its graduates constitute the core of the quality human resource in India's agricultural research and education. The Institute has all along been adjusting and improving its policies, plans and programmes to effectively respond to the needs and opportunities of the nation. During the fifties, the advancement of scientific disciplines constituted the core programme and provided the base for its fast expansion in the 1960s and 1970s in all its three interactive areas, namely, research, education and extension. Besides basic research, applied and commodity research gained great importance resulting in the development of several popular high yielding varieties of almost all major crops and their associated management technologies, which brought about an unprecedented increase in the national food and agricultural production. The campus is spread over , 8 km west of New Delhi Railway Station. This was initially outside Delhi, but over the decades the city has grown much beyond the campus. Indian Agricultural Statistics Research Institute is affiliated with and is located in the campus of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute.

Born in Brooklyn, New York, Hillman was a member of three Olympic teams at the turn of the century. He also was a coach at Dartmouth College. Hillman won three gold medals at the 1904 Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, taking the flat 400 metres, the 200 metres hurdles and the 400 metres hurdles. He had Olympic record times in all three events, but Hillman tripped one hurdle in the 400 metres, which meant that his time of 53.0 seconds could not be counted as a world record (the record had stood at 57.2 seconds since 1891). In addition, the race was run over hurdles that were too low at 76 centimetres instead of the normal 91,4. En route to Greece for the 1906 Summer Olympics, Hillman was one of a half-dozen athletes who were injured by an enormous wave that washed over the deck of the ship. He finished fifth in the 400 metres, his only event that year. Hillman won a silver medal in the 400 metres hurdles at the 1908 Summer Olympics, setting a short-lived record in the second round. He and Charles Bacon of the USA went over the last hurdle simultaneously, but Bacon won the run to the tape to win in a world record 55.0 seconds. Hillman's time in the race was 55.3 seconds. On April 24, 1909, Hillman and Lawson Robertson set a record that has never been equalled, running the three-legged race in 11.0 seconds. He won four Amateur Athletic Union titles, two each in the 200 metres and 400 metres hurdles. The track coach at Dartmouth College from 1910 until his death, Hillman advised hurdlers to swallow raw eggs, which he believed to be \\"excellent for the wind and stomach.\\" He was on the Olympic track and field coaching staff in 1924, 1928, and 1932 Summer Olympics, as well as acting as trainer for the American Davis Cup team in 1935.Harry Hillman Taken by Death, Cumberland News, August 10, 1945 One of his most famous athletes was Canadian hurdler Earl Thomson, the winner of the gold medal in the 110 metres hurdles at the 1920 Summer Olympics. In 1930 Hillman, along with Thomson and Harold Barron, was involved in the design of a new safer hurdle, with a view to reducing the danger of bad falls and injuries.Coaches Design New Track Hurdle to Prevent Falls, Alton Evening Telegraph, July 8, 1930 Hillman died at Hanover, New Hampshire.Harry Hillman Taken by Death, Cumberland News, August 10, 1945 References External links 1881 births 1945 deaths Sportspeople from Brooklyn Track and field athletes from New York (state) American male hurdlers American male sprinters Athletes (track and field) at the 1904 Summer Olympics Athletes (track and field) at the 1906 Intercalated Games Athletes (track and field) at the 1908 Summer Olympics Dartmouth Big Green coaches Olympic gold medalists for the United States in track and field Olympic silver medalists for the United States in track and field Olympic track and field athletes of the United States Medalists at the 1908 Summer Olympics Medalists at the 1904 Summer Olympics ","title":"Harry Hillman"},{"id":"602135","text":"Events *March 27 Johann Sebastian Bach performs the Brockes-Passion TWV 5: 1 at St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig. *September ‚Äì Leopold Mozart is expelled from the Benedictine University of Salzburg for poor attendance. *1739‚Äì1749 Bach revises his St John Passion BWV 245 (BC D 2e)--version never performed during his lifetime (version we know today). *1739‚Äì1742 Bach starts revising some of his Weimar period Chorale preludes in a new manuscript (the so-called Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes BWV 651‚Äì668).

As a legal category, it includes \\"all land within the limits of any Indian reservation\\", \\"all dependent Indian communities within the borders of the United States\\", and \\"all Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not been extinguished.\\" This legal classification defines American Indian tribal and individual land holdings as part of a reservation, an allotment, or a public domain allotment. All federal trust lands held for Native American tribes is Indian country. Federal, state, and local governments use this category in their legal processes. Today, however, according to the U.S. Census of 2010, over 78% of all Native Americans live off reservations. Indian country now spans thousands of rural areas, towns and cities where Indian people live. This convention is followed generally in colloquial speech and is reflected in publications such as the Native American newspaper Indian Country Today.  Related and historical meanings  Historically, Indian country was considered the areas, regions, territories or countries beyond the frontier of settlement that were inhabited primarily by Native Americans. Colonists made treaties with Native Americans agreeing to offer services and protection indefinitely in exchange for peaceful transfer of Native American land. =Between the Appalachians and Mississippi= As the original 13 colonies grew and treaties were made, the de facto boundary between settled territory and Indian country during the 18th century was roughly the crest of the Appalachian Mountains, a boundary set into law by the Royal Proclamation of 1763, the Confederation Congress Proclamation of 1783, and later by the Nonintercourse Act. The Indian Reserve was gradually settled by European Americans and divided into territories and states, starting with Kentucky County (an extension of Virginia) and the Northwest Territory. =West of the Mississippi= Most Indians in the area of the former Reserve were either killed or relocated further west under policies of Indian Removal. After the Louisiana Purchase, the Indian Intercourse Act of 1834 created the Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River as a destination. It too was gradually divided into territories and states for European American settlement, leaving only modern Indian Reservations inside the boundaries of U.S. states. In 2020, the United States Supreme Court ruled in McGirt v. Oklahoma that the tribal statistical area (and former reservation) of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation remains under the tribal sovereignty of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation for the purposes of the Major Crimes Act.

Green liberals are usually liberal on social issues and \\"green\\" on economic issues. The term \\"green liberalism\\" was coined by political philosopher Marcel Wissenburg in his 1998 book Green Liberalism: The Free and The Green Society. He argues that liberalism must reject the idea of absolute property rights and accept restraints that limit the freedom to abuse nature and natural resources. However, he rejects the control of population growth and any control over the distribution of resources as incompatible with individual liberty, instead favoring supply-side control: more efficient production and curbs on overproduction and overexploitation. This view tends to dominate the movement, although critics say it actually puts individual liberties above sustainability.  Philosophy  Green liberalism values the Earth very highly, emphasizing the importance of the planet being passed down to the next generation unharmed.How to be a Green Liberal, (Book synopsis), Author: Simon Hailwood, 2004. (Retrieved August 21, 2008.) Green liberalism accepts that the natural world is in a state of flux and does not seek to conserve the natural world as it is. However, it does seek to minimize the damage done by the human species on the natural world and to aid the regeneration of damaged areas. Green liberalism seeks to combine liberal democratic institutions and tenets such as equality and freedom of the individual with environmental protections that seek to reduce major threats to the environment like overconsumption and air pollution. On economic issues, green liberals take a position somewhere between classical liberalism (on the center/center-right) and social liberalism (on the center/center-left): green liberals may favor slightly less government involvement than social liberals, but far more than classical liberals. Some green liberals practice free-market environmentalism and thus share some values with rightist classical liberalism or libertarianism. This is one of a few reasons why a blue-green alliance is possible in politics. The historian Conrad Russell, a British Liberal Democrat member of the House of Lords, dedicated a chapter of his book The Intelligent Person's Guide to Liberalism to the subject of green liberalism. In a literary sense, the term \\"Green Liberalism\\" was coined, however, by political philosopher Marcel Wissenburg in his 1998 book Green Liberalism: The Free and The Green Society., among others. =Green Liberal Democrats= The existence of a Green liberal group predates Wissenburg's book by at least ten years in the UK when a pressure group was formed within the newly merged Liberal Democrats at a meeting in Nottingham addressed (as the keynote speaker) by Simon Hughes MP. The Green Liberal Democrats emerged from this inaugural meeting which had been organised by the Chair of the pre-existing Liberal Ecology Group (LEG) which had itself been set up eleven years previously in 1977. Keith Melton, one of the earliest members of LEG (its long title was the Liberal Ecology Group for Economic and Social Reform) was, at the time of the merger between the Liberal Party and the SDP in 1988, a senior lecturer in International Marketing at Nottingham Trent University, so it made sense to call that meeting in Nottingham. Most of the delegates at that meeting were LEG members, although there was a modest contingent from the SDP \\"Green Group\\". The Liberal Ecology Group had been campaigning within the Liberal Party for years, pushing for a different, zero growth strategy for economics, following the philosophy elucidated in the Club of Rome\`s report \\"Limits to Growth\\". They also campaigned on air pollution issues, calling for the banning of lead in petrol for example and the banning of HFCs which were known to damage the ozone layer. The Green Liberal Democrats has been a very active pressure group within the Liberal Democrats over the years and in 2018 celebrated 30 years of existence with a conference, also held in Nottingham, also organised by Keith Melton and also with (now Sir) Simon Hughes as the initial speaker. The significance of the group and its influence on the party was marked by other key speakers at the 2018 conference, including one quarter of the current Liberal Democrats\` parliamentary representatives in the House of Commons. Sir Ed Davey MP related the environmental impact of the Liberal Democrats in the coalition years, establishing a Green Investment Bank (subsequently sold off by the Tory government) Wera Hobhouse MP updated the Green approach to Air pollution and Sir Vince Cable MP, leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Honorary Professor of Economics at Nottingham University, the venue for the 2018 GLD conference, had the task of reviewing how the concept of Sustainable Development withstood the ravages of time. Cable was one of the co-authors of the Brundtland Commission report in 1987 which first introduced the sustainable development concept, championed by Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Commission\`s Chair (and three-time Prime Minister of Norway). One of the key early successes of the Green Liberal Democrats, and its new Chair, Keith Melton, was to ensure that the preamble to the Liberal Democrat constitution had a key reference to Green issues at the heart of the party with the following sentence appearing immediately after the first paragraph defining Liberal Philosophy - \\"We believe that each generation is responsible for the fate of our planet and, by safeguarding the balance of nature and the environment, for the long term continuity of life in all its forms.\\" The Liberal Party of Canada under St√©phane Dion placed the environment at the front of its political agenda, proposing an ecotax and tax shift called the Green Shift. Similarly, the British Liberal Democrats have drawn on the same concept to propose a \\"Green Tax Switch\\".  Green neoliberalism  = History = One kind of green liberalism is called green neoliberalism, which became significant and increasingly prominent in world institutions beginning in the 1980s. In this decade, the two main institutions of global development, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, began to face increasing global outrage as a result of their structural adjustment plans, which were loans with severe conditions on debt-ridden countries. The conditions focused on austerity measures, e.g. reducing government control of the market and provision of social services and liberalizing trade, thus enabling corporations from the Global North to enter into developing countries and out- compete local markets.Liverman, Diana and Vilas, S. Neoliberalism and the Environment in Latin America, Annual Review of Environment and Resources. 2006. 31:327‚Äì63 This caused social unrest to increase on many fronts: farmers were losing their livelihoods to large corporations importing artificially cheap, subsidized stable crops from the Global North. Industrialized agriculture and agronomy became the status quo in both research institutions and practice, bringing with it many environmental and social costs.Kasi, E. (2010), Peter M. Rosset. Food is Different: Why We Must Get the WTO Out of Agriculture (Halifax, Nova Scottia: Fernwood Publishing, Bangalore: Books for Change, Kuala Lumpur: SIRD, Cape Town: David Philip, and London & New York: Zed Books, 2006, ISBN 1- 84277-755-6, 1-84277-754-8, pp. 194). J. Int. Dev., 22: 1044‚Äì1045. Companies could move their operations to countries where labor was cheaper much more easily, meaning some people lost their jobs while others accepted very low wages. People, social movements and non-governmental organizations began to openly criticize and blame the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization for being the root cause of the food crises, job losses and environmental degradation. This was picked up by media in the Global North as well, adding to the shift of the view of the Global South as \\"happy recipients of Bank Aid\\"Goldman, Michael. Imperial Nature: The World Bank and Struggles for Social Justice in the Age of Globalization. Yale University Press, 2005. p. 94 to images of bread riots, protests, mass marches and fasts. The pressure was heightened by the increasingly prominent environmental movement, which brought attention to the way that business as usual economics did not account for environmental costs, the largest of which, which is in turn connected to many other problems, is human-caused climate change. In response to this criticism, the World Bank first responded with denial. When this did not prove effective, it completely turned around and decided to make significant changes in its organization.Goldman, Michael. Imperial Nature: The World Bank and Struggles for Social Justice in the Age of Globalization. Yale University Press, 2005. p. 96 Led by actors within the Bank who were intent on reforming it in response to global criticism, the Bank now made the environment one of its primary focuses. Whereas in 1985 the World Bank had only five staff working on environmental issues, with a budget of less than $15 million, by 1995 it had more than three hundred environment-related staff, with almost one billion dollars to work with.Goldman, Michael. Imperial Nature: The World Bank and Struggles for Social Justice in the Age of Globalization. Yale University Press, 2005. p. 97 An entirely new Environment Department was created, which had to approve the environmental sustainability of large-scale projects before they were implemented. = Characteristics and context = Thus began a new era of green neoliberalism, in which the World Bank and its fellow institutions did not let go of their neoliberal ideology, i.e. their commitment to free-market economics, low regulation, free trade, and so on, but at the same time adopted the mainstream rhetoric of sustainability and environmental consciousness. This kind of green liberalism is mainly economic and it is supported by a range of people, both socially liberal and socially conservative. It is related to, if not synonymous, with eco-capitalism. In the larger context of the history of development, this transition follows a trajectory that began with modernization theory and a project to modernize developing countries, followed by the globalization project, where free-market and free-trade was meant to help countries develop, which was then succeeded by the sustainability project.McMichael, Philip. Development and Social Change: A Global Perspective. Los Angeles: SAGE, 2012. Print.

Life At the age of nineteen, after some lessons from Dumont, miniature painter to Marie Antoinette, he became a pupil of Jacques-Louis David. Employed at Versailles on portraits of the dukes of Angoul√™me and Berry, he was given a commission by the queen, which opens the long list of those he received from successive French rulers until his death in 1855. Patronized by Josephine and Napoleon Bonaparte, he arranged the ceremonies of their coronation and prepared drawings for the publication intended as its official commemoration, a work for which he was paid by Louis XVIII, whose portrait (engraved by Debucourt) he executed in 1814. Although Isabey did homage to Napoleon on his return from Elba, he continued to enjoy the favour of the Restoration, and took part in arrangements for the coronation of Charles X. The July Monarchy conferred on him an important post in connection with the royal collections, and Napoleon III granted him a pension, and the cross of commander of the Legion of Honor.

He is the brother of the singer-songwriter Eugenio Bennato. Biography Edoardo Bennato began his music career in the early Sixties (the first single was published on 1966) as one of the most creative and innovative songwriters of his time. His music distinguished itself for being an imaginative blend of blues, rock and roll, folk influences and even hints of opera. After his first album Non farti cadere le braccia (\\"Don't let your arms fall\\", 1973), where he was still finding his way between tradition and innovation, Bennato decidedly chose the latter, many of his songs being performed by himself as a one-man band, with a 12-string acoustic guitar, harmonica, kazoo and foot-drum. During this early period, Bennato's lyrics were characterised by biting satire and irony, often addressed at the establishment and those self-proclaimed as \\"the good\\". His second album, I buoni e i cattivi (\\"The good and the bad ones\\", 1974), was an attack against the common-sense distinction between good and evil, between the righteous and the villains. \\"Arrivano i buoni\\" (\\"Here come the good ones\\") was particularly significant: \\"Here come the good ones, they are resolute and they've already made a list of all the bad guys to eliminate... so now the good have declared war against the bad but they guarantee that it will be the last war ever to be fought...\\". With Io che non sono l'imperatore (\\"I, who am not the Emperor\\", 1975) Bennato pushed his music more towards experimentation, still mainly playing his acoustic guitar. The cover of the album shows a plan for the Naples light-rail system that Bennato had developed for his final project as a university student. While it was highly praised by his lecturers, the plan was never approved by the city council, giving him even more reason to deride and mock the powers to be. \\"Meno male che adesso non c'√® Nerone\\" (\\"Fortunately there's no Nero now\\") and \\"Signor censore\\" (\\"Mister censor\\") are among Bennato's best examples of pungent criticism of the system. With La Torre di Babele (\\"The Tower of Babel\\", 1976) Bennato's music became more sophisticated ‚Äì more musicians contributed to the album, which contains tracks of a very wide range of styles. Bennato was clearly evolving rapidly and this album reflects this process. \\"Cantautore\\" (\\"Songwriter\\") is an amusing piece mocking those songwriters who, at the time, were taking themselves too seriously. In the following year, Bennato finally reached commercial success with Burattino senza fili (\\"Marionette without strings\\", 1977). This is a concept album based on the Pinocchio fairy tale. The central idea is that having one's own freedom and independence is always better than giving in to the system and its rules, even if it means renouncing to some advantages that the system itself uses as luring temptations. Most of the songs in the album became classics, not only of Bennato's repertoire, but also of Italian pop music in general, \\"Il gatto e la volpe\\" (\\"The cat and the fox\\") probably being the most famous one. After this big success, no new album appeared until 1980, when Bennato surprised fans, critics and the whole music biz with a very unconventional move: two albums in less than a month: Uffa! Uffa! (\\"I'm fed up!\\", 1980) and Sono solo canzonette (\\"They're only pop songs\\", 1980). The two albums together sold more than a million copies, against all marketing rules and expectations. Bennato was clearly at the apex of his creativity. Uffa! Uffa!, the most experimental of the two records, is an album where Bennato blatantly disregarded all commercial concerns and let his creativity free to indulge in all kinds of directions, from medieval ecclesiastical chants to punk rock. The album also contained big hits but was generally overshadowed by the hugely successful Sono solo canzonette, a concept album based on the Pater Pan fairy tale and affirming the value of fantasy and imagination over reason and logic. By this time, Bennato was the most popular Italian songwriter. Inevitably, this period also coincided with the start of a very slow but perceptible decline. In 1983 another fairy-tale concept album, based on The Pied Piper of Hamelin appeared on the market (√à arrivato un bastimento) but it wasn't as successful as the previous ones and this must have led Bennato to try different avenues. This he did with alternating fortune until the present day. Notably, on the occasion of the 1990 FIFA World Cup, which was held in Italy, Edoardo sang the official song of the event: \\"Un'estate italiana\\" (\\"An Italian Summer\\") together with Gianna Nannini.

Life and work He was born in Nonant and entered the studio of Jean-Baptiste Regnault, where he made a lifelong friendship with Robert Lef√®vre. He and won the first prize of the Academy in 1792, for study at the French Academy in Rome, where he stayed for five years. After his return from Italy, in the disturbed patronage conditions of the French Revolution, he seems to have abandoned painting and turned to writing, although he began to exhibit in 1795, and continued to do so at various intervals up to 1814. He exhibited three pictures at the Louvre: the Mother's Lesson, the Bath of Paul and Virginia and Daedalus and Icarus. A portrait from this period was purchased in 2003 for the Museum of Grenoble. . thumbLandon's Daedalus and Icarus, (1799) oil on canvas. (Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts et de la Dentelle, Alen√ßon) *His Leda won an award of merit in 1801, and is now in the ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau since 1932 deposit by the Louvre. * *His Mother's Lesson was the subject of a popular engraving. *Paul and Virginia Bathing (an illustration of Chateaubriand's popular novel, also engraved), his Sleep of Achilles and Daedalus and Icarus (1799, illustrated right) are all at the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts et de la Dentelle, Alen√ßon. It is chiefly for his writing on the arts that he made a reputation, however. He published nearly one hundred volumes during his lifetime. Landon was among the collaborators of the influential Journal des arts, des sciences et de la litt√©rature. He was also a part-owner of the Gazette de France, where the extended accounts of annual Paris Salons were published. He was a paintings conservator at the Louvre, a corresponding member of the Institut and painter to Charles Ferdinand, duc de Berry, whose widow's paintings gallery he catalogued. His major, on-going work comprised the Annales du mus√©e et de l'√©cole moderne des beaux-arts, published between 1808 and 1835 and running to 33 volumes. It forms a comprehensive resource on European art and artists prior to the 19th century. However it is far from perfect. The work has been criticised for containing many careless biographical mistakes and lacking critical accuracy. An example of his popular works that has been recently reprinted was Numismatique du voyage du jeune Anacharsis, ou M√©dailles des beaux temps de la Gr√®ce which was accompanied by an essay on connoisseurship of medals by Th√©ophile Marion Dumersan and dedicated to Louis XVIII, 1823. Anacharsis had recently been established in the popular imagination in a historical novel, while coins were among the few antiquities that the middle class might aspire to own. Landon also published *Vie et ≈ìuvres des peintres les plus c√©l√®bres de toutes les √©coles... (\\"Lives of Celebrated Painters\\"), in 22 volumes *An Historical Description of Paris, 2 volumes * Description of London, with 42 plates He also produced descriptions of the Palais du Luxembourg and its contents, of the Giustiniani collection.

The area around the mountain is a designated national park, the Hallasan National Park (, ). Hallasan is commonly considered to be one of the three main mountains of South Korea, along with Jirisan and Seoraksan. Names Hallasan is the highest mountain in South Korea and is worshipped by people because they think that gods and spirits live on it. Alternate English names for the mountain include Hanla Mountain or Mount Halla and older English sources refer to the peak as Mount Auckland.Simon Winchester. Korea: a walk through the land of miracles (London, Penguin, 2004). Page 39. Hallasan is written in Hangul as if it were Hanrasan (); however, it is still pronounced as Hallasan. In the past, Hallasan has been known by numerous other names in Korean including Buak (/), Wonsan (/), Jinsan (/), Seonsan (/), Dumuak (/), Burasan (/), Yeongjusan (/), and Hyeolmangbong (/). Every name of Hallasan has meanings and legends. = Hallasan = Han represents the universe, and la means \\"pull\\". Both words mean that the mountain is high enough to pull the universe. According to the old legend, if anyone were to climb up the mountain, see a star and call out (noinseong), they could live a longer life. = Jinan = The name represents a mountain that is located at the back side of a town and protects the town's residents. Jeju people called Hallasan Jinan because Hallasan blocked winds that were blowing from the Pacific Ocean and also protected the residents. = Dumuak = Dumuak is another name for Hallasan. The name represents the bold head mountain. According to a legend, a hunter accidentally ripped God's belly button. God expressed his anger by ripping off the peak of Hallasan. The remaining part of the mountain became Baengnokdam () and the ripped part of the mountain became Sanbangsan (). = Wonsan = Wonsan became the name of Hallasan because the center of the mountain is the highest point and the mountain looks like a circular cone. On a very clear day, Hanllasan is visible from the mainland. = Yeongjusan = Yeongjusan was believed to be a habitat for a plant species that made people immortal. According to a legend, immortal wizards of Korea used to live in Hallasan. They were immortal because of this special plant. Qinshi Huang wanted the plant to live forever and ordered his men to get the plant (200 AD). = Buak = Buak became the name of Hallasan, because of the peak of the mountain. The crater of the mountain looks like a big pond. According to a legend, a white deer used to drink the water here.  Natural Monument  The Hallasan Natural Reserve is a natural monument to South Korea. Satellite image showing Hallasan at the center of Jeju Island Geology and geography = Hallasan = Hallasan is a massive shield volcano which forms the bulk of Jeju Island and is often taken as representing the island itself. There is a Korean traditional local saying that \\"Jeju Island is Hallasan, and Hallasan is Jeju.\\" The mountain can indeed be seen from all places on the island, but its peak is often covered in clouds. The mountain has been designated Korea's Natural Monument no. 182\\\\. The soil of Hallasan is mostly made out of volcanic ash, volcanic sand, and lapilli. The organic contents of the soil are higher than any other soil in South Korea, but drainage is also better than any other place in South Korea. The soil is not the best for farming. The volcanic island was constructed, starting in the Pliocene epoch, on the continental shelf, which is about 100 m (300 ft) below sea level in that area. Eruptions of basalt and trachyte lava built the island above sea level, and it now reaches a height of . A large volcanic crater over in diameter tops the volcano. About 360 parasitic cones, or oreum () in the Jeju dialect, are found on the volcano's flanks. Most of them are cinder cones and scoria cones, but there are also some lava domes and about 20 tuff rings near the coast and offshore, which were formed by underwater phreatic eruptions. The most recent eruptions are estimated to be about 5,000 years ago, which puts the volcano into the active classification, meaning it has erupted in the last 10,000 years. The designation as active is not agreed to by all, as more monitoring and study are needed to better understand the volcano. = Baengnokdam = Crater lakes on Hallasan. There is a crater lake on Hallasan called Baengnokdam (/), meaning \\"white deer lake\\". It is formed by the collapse of the top of the ridge by the movement of magma underground.Ïú§ÏÑ†, ÌòÑÏõêÌïô, Ï†ïÏ∞®Ïó∞ (2005), \\"Ï†úÏ£ºÎèÑ ÌïúÎùºÏÇ∞Ïùò ÏßÄÏßà\\".

Depending on the season, the circumference of the lake is up to 2 kilometers with a depth up to about 100 meters. The configurative rocks of the eastern and western walls of Baengnokdam are different. The eastern wall is covered with basalt lava 2‚Äì5 m thick at its top. In the lower part, there is a high-concentration stream sediment layer of the Tamra layer. The western wall is made of the trachyte lava dome. The volcanic wall formed by the eruption of the lava should be composed of lava, analysis. However, the eastern wall is composed of the clastic sedimentary sediments, so it is not a crater by lava eruption but a pit crater. Namely, the trachyte magma, which formed the Baengnokdam trachyte, was elevated on the dome, and the trachyte magma formed lava dome at its top. The inclination and direction of the Tamra Formation of Baengnokdam cannot be measured directly at Baengnokdam, but it is N10W of slope and 30NE of slope measured near the valley below North Baengnokdam, 1,580 m above sea level. = Effect of Topography effect of HallasanÏò§ÏòÅÏàô, ÍπÄÎèôÌò∏, ÏÜ°Í∏∞Ïò•(2006.4), \\"ÌïúÎùºÏÇ∞ ÏßÄÌòï Ìö®Í≥ºÍ∞Ä Ï†úÏ£ºÎèÑÏùò Íµ≠ÏßÄ Í∏∞Ïò®Ïóê ÎØ∏ÏπòÎäî Ïó≠Ìï† \\". ÌïúÍµ≠Í∏∞ÏÉÅÌïôÌöå ÌïôÏà†ÎåÄÌöå ÎÖºÎ¨∏Ïßë =  Tendency of wind change by Hallasan  In order to understand the tendency of temperature change in Jeju Island, the short-term forecasting model of Halla, the weather data of the Korean peninsula, and the wind vector of AWS is analyzed. When the south winds flow into the sea, sea winds form around Hallasan, and the sea breeze is formed on the downwind side of the sea. On the coast, winds and the sea breezes gather around the coasts to form a persistent eddy, and the highest temperature occurs in the region where the eddy occurs.  Tendency of maximum temperature by Hallasan  In order to understand the tendency of maximum temperature in Jeju Island, the area where the highest temperature occurred when the wind was weak was surveyed and analyzed. In the morning, when the reverse layer is formed and the wind is weak, the warm air of the lower layer is raised when the air movement between the upper and lower layers is blocked, and it is placed on the upper floor by the sea breeze, which affects the temperature rise in the mid-mountainous area. The occurrence of the highest temperature coincides with the formation position of Eddy, and when the wind is weak, it is formed in the middle mountain region. When the wind is weak, the warmth is accumulated in the middle layer, so the maximum temperature in the mid-mountainous area is higher than the maximum temperature of the low- altitude coastal area about 1‚Äì3¬∞C, and 4¬∞C or higher on the downwind side. When the wind is blowing at 4‚Äì9 m/s, the wind phenomenon occurs mainly, so the weak sea breeze coming from the sea is formed on the coastal area and the peak temperature is mainly observed during the daytime.  Tendency of minimum temperature by Hallasan  The change of the minimum temperature varies depending on the degree of cooling of Hallasan and the intensity of the wind speed. When the wind blows due to the predominance of sea breeze, the air cooled in Hallasan descends to the coastal area and induces the decrease in temperature. When the synoptic wind blows strongly, the cold air of Hallasan moves to the downwind side and the lowest temperature appears. The lowest temperature in the downwind area is 2‚Äì5¬∞C lower than in other areas, and the lowest temperature often appears at night. When the weak northwestern synoptic winds are blown, the lowest temperature appears in the eastern part of Jeju Island. The chill of the top of Hallasan descends downhill along the mountain range and is collected in the eastern part of Jeju Island so the morning temperature drops a lot.  Inter-regional temperature variation by Hallasan  For the last five years, the deviation of temperature (maximum temperature - minimum temperature) increased in spring between March and May. The reason for the large deviation in spring is because the phenomenon occurs frequently by Hallasan.  Ecosystem  Hallasan was isolated from the mainland for a long time and its species were able to become unique and different from mainland species. The elevation of the mountain causes various plant species to live there. The mountain became a habitat for plants that live in low elevation and plants that live in high elevation. 50 or more unique species live in Jeju Island, especially in high elevation area in Hallasan. Various animal species also live on the mountain. Because of the geography of the mountain, the same species evolved in different ways after thousands of years. Just like plant species, animal species originally living in cold and hot climates use the mountain as their habitat. There are a total of 160 bird species that use Hallasan as a habitat. Only 19 species are considered as a natural monument and protected by the government. Ravens are commonly seen in the hiking trail. A total of 3,315 insect species live on the mountain. 254 spider species also live there. A study found that spider habitat is concentrated more on the north side of the mountain. Ticks live on the mountain and caused much damage to Jeju residents long ago. The damage caused by ticks continues. Six tick species cause problems for domestic animals. =Flora= According to the world floral region, Hallasan belongs to the temperate subregion with Yangtze River basin and southwest Japan. From the coast to the top of the Hallasan, plants are distributed vertically from the subtropical plants to the alpine plants due to the environmental gradient. Of the 4,000 species of vascular plants native to Korea, about 400 species are estimated to be endangered or potentially rare. Especially, 23 species- specific wild plants designated by the Ministry of Environment (a total of 59 species) are distributed in Jeju Island and 6 of them can be found in the natural reserve area of Hallasan. Also, about 50 kinds of special plants are distributed in Jeju Island, especially in the highlands of Hallasan. =Fauna= Because of the geographical character of the island, there are many subspecies due to isolation even though they are the same species. Also, Hallasan is a place where the polar animal and the tropical animal coexist due to the difference of the climate zone according to the elevation. Mammals The mammals of Jeju Island are distributed among 5 orders and 114 families and 5 species . Thus, the distribution of mammals in Jeju Island is very poor in species and numbers because Jeju island is isolated from the Korean peninsula long ago. Their population has been reduced due to the decrease in food because of the use of rodenticides and pesticides in recent years and indiscreet fishing. Weasels, badgers, and gazelles are inhabited in Hallasan. The number of weasels and badgers are declining. Boar and Formosan deer are already extinct. Roe deer, the largest mammal in Hallasan, was once in danger of extinction. But now its population has increased due to protection policies and much effort by the islanders. Amphibians and reptiles Most amphibians and reptiles on Jeju Island are indigenous animals but there are some invasive species from Japan and China. Mt. Halla is particularly well-suited for amphibians and reptiles as a hideout, with well- developed grasslands and marshlands, and is rich in food. Birds There are 364 kinds of birds in Jeju Island, 91 kinds of passing birds, 100 kinds of birds in winter, 42 kinds of resident birds and 43 kinds of vagrants. Among the birds in Jeju Island, except for the species that live in habitat for migratory birds and coastal regions, there are 160 species inhabiting mainly in Mt. Halla. There are 19 species designated as natural monuments. Temple The mountain is home to Gwaneumsa (/), the oldest Buddhist temple on the island. The temple was originally built during the Goryeo Dynasty (1046-1083) during King Munjong (Î¨∏Ï¢Ö). Like many other temples in Korea, Gwaneumsa was destroyed in 1702 and closed for 200 years. The temple was rebuilt in 1908. It spread Buddhism again in Jeju Island. There is a memorial site outside the temple to commemorate the victims of the Jeju uprising that took place between 1948 and 1950. It is one of the most visited places on the island. The mountain is also the location of Jonjaamji, a pagoda preserving relics of the Buddha. Trails There are five hiking trails on Hallasan. * Gwaneumsa Trail (Í¥ÄÏùåÏÇ¨ ÌÉêÎ∞©Î°ú/) - 8.7 km * Eorimok Trail (Ïñ¥Î¶¨Î™© ÌÉêÎ∞©Î°ú/Ïñ¥Î¶¨Î™© ) - 4.7 km * Seongpanak Trail (ÏÑ±ÌåêÏïÖ ÌÉêÎ∞©Î°ú/) - 9.6 km * Yeongsil Trail (ÏòÅÏã§ ÌÉêÎ∞©Î°ú/) - 3.7 km * Donnaeko Trail (ÎèàÎÇ¥ÏΩî ÌÉêÎ∞©Î°ú/ÎèàÎÇ¥ÏΩî) - 9.1 km The Donnaeko trail was reopened to the public on December 4, 2009, after a fifteen-year hiatus. Only the Gwaneumsa and Seongpanak trails lead to the summit. The Donnaeko, Eorimok and Yeongsil courses only go as far as Witse Oreum (), as the rest of the trail leading to the peak has been closed off since 1994 in order to restore and protect the vegetation.  Transport  Official site for tourists. (Korean) Site to search information about Korean transportation. (Korean) = Gwaneumsa Trail = To go to Gwaneumsa Trail by car, you should use road number 1117 which connects Jeju Arra-dong Mountain and Tamra Education Center and Cheon-Wangsa. From Jeju city hall to Gwaneumsa Information Center, it takes about 25 minutes and from Seogwipo city hall, it takes about 50 minutes. If you want to use public transportation, ride Jeju city bus number 475. Since this bus doesn't enter the city, you have to get off and transfer at the entrance of Jeju University. In the past, it operated only on weekends and holidays, but it can be used on weekdays since the 2017 bus route reorganization. If you have to take a bus to Jeju city or Seogwipo city, the closest stop is Jeju medical center at 5.16 road. It takes about 4 ~ 50 minutes on foot. Even if you come down the mountain at a late time, this route's bus would come in handy, since this bus comes until 20:20. = Eorimok Trail = To go to Eorimok Trail by car, you should use road number 1139 (or 1100), which connect Jeju City and Seogwipo City Jungmun-dong. From Jeju city hall, it takes about 35 minutes and from Jungmun-dong, it takes about 50 minutes. If you want to use public transportation, ride bus number 240. (Dispense interval about 1hr.) = Seongpanak Trail = To go to Seongpanak Trail by car, you should use road number 1131 (or 516) which connect Jeju city and Seogwipo city. From Jeju city hall to the Seongpanak Information Center, it takes about 30 minutes. From Seogwipo city hall, it takes about 40 minutes. If you want to use public transformation, ride buses on road 516, which are 181, 182, 281. Since these buses come in an interval of only 10~15 minutes, the route with the best accessibility is this route. = Yeongsil Trail = The Yeongsil Trail is connected to the Gwaneumsa Trail by road number 1100. This makes the transportation information really similar. Actually, the way of public transportation is same. But the time to come and go is quite different since these two trails are 30 minutes away by car. From Jeju city hall to the Yeongsil Information Center, it takes about 50 minutes. From Jungmun to Yeongsil Information Center, it takes about 30 minutes. = Donnaeko Trail = To go to Donnaeko Trail by car, you should use road number 1115 which connects Jeju city Araun mountain river, Tamra education center, and Chunwangsa temple. From Jeju city hall to Donnaeko Information Center, it takes about 60 minutes and from Seogwipo city hall, it takes about 25 minutes. If you want to use public transportation, ride Seogwipo city bus 610-1. You should be aware that this bus goes to the mourning gallery (, which is the entrance) only 6 times a day. It takes about 4~50 minutes on foot.

The Big Issue is one of the UK's leading social businesses and exists to offer homeless people, or individuals at risk of homelessness, the opportunity to earn a legitimate income, thereby helping them to reintegrate into mainstream society. It is the world's most widely circulated street newspaper. History Inspired by Street News, a newspaper sold by homeless people in New York, The Big Issue was founded in 1991 by John Bird and Gordon Roddick as a response to the increasing numbers of homeless people in London;The Big Issue - Introduction and History they have been friends since 1967. The Body Shop provided start- up capital to the equivalent value of $50,000. The magazine was initially published monthly but, in June 1993, The Big Issue went weekly. The venture continued to expand with national editions being established in Scotland and Wales, as well as regional editions for Northern England and England's South West Region. Further editions are also produced in seven locations overseas. In 1995, The Big Issue Foundation was founded to offer additional support and advice to vendors around issues such as housing, health, personal finance and addiction. In 2001, the magazine sold nearly 300,000 copies per week. Between 2007 and 2011, the circulation of The Big Issue declined from 167,000 to less than 125,000. Competition between vendors also increased at this time. In January 2012, the magazine was relaunched, with an increased focus on campaigning and political journalism. New columnists were added, including the Premier League footballer Joey Barton, Rachel Johnson, Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park and Samira Ahmed. The cover price was increased. In 2016, The Big Issue celebrated surpassing 200 million magazine sales.  Vendors  To become a vendor, one must be homeless or almost homeless, vulnerably housed or marginalised in some way. The Big Issue recognises, however, that for many people, being housed is only the first stage in getting off the streets; therefore, The Big Issue Foundation exists to support vendors in gaining control of their lives by tackling the various issues which lead to homelessness. There are five localised editions of the magazine sold throughout the United Kingdom, and vendors buy The Big Issue for ¬£1.50 and sell it for ¬£3. The magazine is also produced and sold in Australia, Ireland, Japan, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, South Korea, and Taiwan. All vendors receive training, sign a code of conduct and can be identified by badges which include their photo and vendor number. Big Issue features prominently in the story of London busker James Bowen's struggles with homelessness and heroin addiction, told in his best-selling book, later turned into the feature film of the same name, A Street Cat Named Bob. After busking on the streets becomes a problem, Bowen becomes a Big Issue vendor, with partner Bob the cat helping attract sales. Bob was featured on the cover in mid-November 2018, with Bowen's article In Bob We Trust: Life lessons from Britain‚Äôs favourite streetwise street cat. = Migration = The accession of several Central and Eastern European countries to the European Union in 2004 led to the increased migration to the UK of residents of those countries. When Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007, the right of their residents (termed \\"A2 nationals\\") to work in Britain was limited to the self-employed, highly skilled migrants, and food and agricultural workers.Reid outlines new EU work curbs, BBC News, 24 October 2006. Retrieved 24 October 2006. The Big Issue, whose vendors are classed as self-employed, offers an opportunity for A2 migrants to work in the UK. By 2011, around half of Big Issue sellers in the north of England were of Romani origin, many of whom having migrated from Romania and Bulgaria. In London, 30% of rough sleepers are Eastern European. In 2012, a Romanian Big Issue vendor obtained a court ruling which confirmed that she is entitled, as a self-employed person, to receive housing benefit. The Big Issue has been criticised for enabling migrants to access the benefits system in this way. The magazine responded by asserting its role in reducing benefit dependency, highlighting British former Prime Minister David Cameron's description of it as \\"a fantastic example of how we can reduce dependence on state hand-outs\\". Ethos The magazine is produced by the Big Issue Company Ltd. The company is a self-sustaining business that generates income through magazine sales and advertising revenues. Financially, The Big Issue is a social enterprise. The Big Issue Foundation is the registered charity arm of the organisation. It aims to underpin the company's work by tackling the underlying causes of homelessness.

Publishers of some other street newspapers, especially in the United States, have criticised it for being overly \\"commercial\\" and having a flashy design. According to these critics, street newspapers ought to focus on covering political and social issues that affect the homeless, rather than emulating mainstream newspapers to generate a profit. Publishers of some smaller papers, such as Making Change in Santa Monica, California, said they felt threatened when The Big Issue began to publish in their area. Other papers have also criticised The Big Issue for its professional production and limited participation by homeless individuals in writing and producing the newspaper. Others, however, have stated that The Big Issue uses a successful business model to generate a profit to benefit the homeless, and its founder John Bird has said that it is \\"possible to be both profitable and ethically correct\\".

K≈çrin is best known for his by≈çbu folding screens, such as Irises and Red and White Plum Blossoms (both registered National Treasures), and his paintings on ceramics and lacquerware produced by his brother Kenzan (1663‚Äì1743). Also a prolific designer, he worked with a variety of decorative and practical objects, such as round fans, makie writing boxes or inr≈ç medicine cases. He is also credited with reviving and consolidating the Rinpa school of Japanese painting, fifty years after its foundation by Hon'ami K≈çetsu (1558‚Äì1637) and Tawaraya S≈çtatsu (c. 1570 ‚Äì c. 1640). In fact the term \\"Rinpa\\", coined in the Meiji period, means \\"school of [K≈ç]rin\\". In particular he had a lasting influence on Sakai H≈çitsu (1761‚Äì1828), who replicated many of his paintings and popularized his work, organizing the first exhibition of K≈çrin's paintings at the hundredth anniversary of his death.  Biography  K≈çrin was born in Kyoto into a wealthy merchant family, dedicated to the design and sale of fine textiles. The family business, named Karigane-ya, catered to the aristocratic women of the city. His father, Ogata S≈çken (1621‚Äì1687), who was a noted calligrapher in the style of K≈çetsu and patron of Noh theater, introduced his sons to the arts.Fairbrother Strange, Edward. (1911). \\"K≈çrin, Ogata\\" in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press. K≈çrin was the second son of S≈çken. His younger brother Kenzan was a celebrated potter and painter in his own right, with whom he collaborated frequently. K≈çrin studied under Yamamoto Soken (active ca. 1683‚Äì1706) of the Kan≈ç school, Kano Tsunenobu (1636‚Äì1713) and Sumiyoshi Gukei (1631‚Äì1705), but his biggest influences were his predecessors Hon'ami K≈çetsu and Tawaraya S≈çtatsu. S≈çken died in 1687, and the elder brother took over the family business, leaving K≈çrin and Kenzan free to enjoy a considerable inheritance. After this, K≈çrin led a very active social life, but his spending ran him into financial difficulties the following years, partly due to loans made to feudal lords. This forced him to pawn some of his treasured possessions. A letter sent by him to a pawnbroker in 1694 regarding \\"one writing box with deer by K≈çetsu\\" and \\"one Shigaraki ware water jar with lacquer lid\\" survives. K≈çrin established himself as an artist only late in life. In 1701, he was awarded the honorific title of hokky≈ç (\\"Bridge of the Dharma\\"), the third highest rank awarded to Buddhist artists, and in 1704 he moved to Edo, where lucrative commissions were more readily available. His early masterpieces, such as his Irises are generally dated to this period. During this time, he also had the opportunity to study the ink paintings of medieval monk painters Sessh≈´ T≈çy≈ç (1420‚Äì1506) and Sesson Shukei (c. 1504 ‚Äì c. 1589). These are seen as important influences in his work from that period, the Rough Waves painting for example. In 1709, he moved back to Kyoto. He built a house with an atelier on Shinmachi street in 1712 and lived there the last five years of his life. His masterpieces from that last period, such as the Red and White Plum Blossoms screens, are thought to have been painted there. K≈çrin died famous but impoverished on 2 June 1716, at the age of 59. His grave is located at the My≈çken-ji temple in Kyoto. His chief pupils were Tatebayashi Kagei, Watanabe Shik≈ç and Fukae R≈çshu, but the present knowledge and appreciation of his work are largely due to the early efforts of his brother Kenzan and later Sakai H≈çitsu, who brought about a revival of K≈çrin's style. Works is a pair of six-panel by≈çbu folding screens made circa 1701‚Äì1705, using ink and color on gold-foiled paper. The screens are among the first works of K≈çrin as a hokky≈ç. It depicts abstracted blue Japanese irises in bloom, and their green foliage, creating a rhythmically repeating but varying pattern across the panels. The similarities of some blooms indicate that a stencil was used. The work shows influence of Tawaraya, and it is representative of the Rinpa school. It is inspired by an episode in the Heian- period text The Tales of Ise. KORIN-Irises-L.jpg KORIN-Irises-R.jpg Each screen measures 150.9 by 338.8 centimetres (59.4 in √ó 133.4 in). They were probably made for the Nij≈ç family, and were presented to the Nishi Honganji Buddhist temple in Kyoto, where they were held for over 200 years. They were sold by the temple in 1913, and are now held by the Nezu Museum, where they are exhibited occasionally (last time, from April 12 to May 14, 2017). They are listed as a National Treasure of Japan. K≈çrin made a similar work about five to twelve years later, another pair of six-panel screens, known as . It is a more explicit reference to the \\"Yatsuhashi (Eight Bridges)\\" episode from The Tales of Ise, including the depiction of an angular bridge that sweeps diagonally across both screens. The screens were made using ink and color on gold-foiled paper and measure 163.7 by 352.4 centimetres (64.4 in √ó 138.7 in) each. They have been held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City since 1953, and were last displayed in 2013. Both Irises screens were displayed together for the first time in almost a century in 2012 at the \\"Korin: National Treasure Irises of the Nezu Museum and Eight-Bridge of the Metropolitan Museum of Art\\" exhibition at the Nezu Museum. is a pair of two- folded screens made using ink and color on gold-foiled paper. It is a replica of an original work by Tawaraya which depicts Raijin, the god of lightning, thunder and storms in the Shinto religion and in Japanese mythology, and F≈´jin, the god of wind. Later, Sakai H≈çitsu, another prominent member of the Rinpa school, painted his own version of the work. All three versions of the work were displayed together for the first time in seventy-five years in 2015, at the Kyoto National Museum exhibition Rinpa: The Aesthetics of the Capital. The screens measure 421.6 by 464.8 centimetres (166 in √ó 183 in) each. At some point H≈çitsu owned them, and in fact he painted one of his most famous works, Flowering Plants of Summer and Autumn, in the back of these screens. The monumental two-sided by≈çbu screens became a symbol of the Rinpa tradition, but both sides of the screens have since been separated to protect them from damage. They are now part of the collection of the Tokyo National Museum, where they are exhibited occasionally. They are listed as an Important Cultural Property. is a pair of two-panel by≈çbu folding screens painted by K≈çrin using ink and color on gold-foiled paper. A late masterpiece, completed probably circa 1712‚Äì1716 in his atelier in Kyoto, it is considered his crowning achievement. The simple, stylized composition of the work depicts a patterned flowing river with a white plum tree on the left and a red plum tree on the right. The plum blossoms indicate the scene occurs in spring. No documentation exists from before the 20th century on the commission or provenance of the screens. They receive mention in no Edo-period publications on K≈çrin's works and were not copied by his followers, which suggests they were not well known. A journal article in 1907 is the first known publication about them, and their first public display came in a 200th-anniversary exhibition of K≈çrin's work in 1915. In addition to the use of tarashikomi, the work is notable for its plum flowers depicted using pigment only, without any outline, now a popular technique known as K≈çrin Plum Flowers. Red and White Plum Blossoms.jpg Each screen measures 156.5 √ó 172.5 centimetres (61.6 √ó 67.9 in). Red and White Plum Blossoms belonged for a long time to the Tsugaru clan, but were purchased by Mokichi Okada in the mid-1950s. Along with the rest of Okada's collection, it is now owned by the MOA Museum of Art in Atami, where they are displayed for one month per year in late winter, the season when the plum blossoms bloom. It is listed as a National Treasure of Japan.

simply Girodet(29 January 17679 December 1824),Long, George. (1851) The Supplement to the Penny Cyclop√¶dia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, C. Knight. was a French painter and pupil of Jacques-Louis David, who participated in the early Romantic movement by including elements of eroticism in his paintings. Girodet is remembered for his precise and clear style and for his paintings of members of the Napoleonic family. Early career Girodet was born at Montargis. Both of his parents died when he was a young adult. The care of his inheritance and education fell to his guardian, a prominent physician named Beno√Æt-Fran√ßois Trioson, \\"m√©decin-de-mesdames\\", who later adopted him. The two men remained close throughout their lives and Girodet took the surname Trioson in 1812. In school he first studied architecture and pursued a military career.Polet, Jean- Claude. (1992) Patrimoine litt√©raire europ√©en, De Boeck Universit√©. 730 pages. . He changed to the study of painting under a teacher named Luquin and then entered the school of Jacques-Louis David. At the age of 22 he successfully competed for the Prix de Rome with a painting of the Story of Joseph and his Brethren.Heck, Johann Georg. (1860) Iconographic Encyclopaedia of Science, D. Appleton and company. From 1789 to 1793 he lived in Italy and while in Rome he painted his Hippocrate refusant les presents d'Artaxerxes and Endymion-dormant (now in the Louvre), a work which gained him great acclaim at the Salon of 1793 and secured his reputation as a leading painter in the French school. A Deluge Scene (Une sc√®ne de d√©luge), 1806, Louvre, Paris Endymion (Le Sommeil d'Endymion or Effet de lune), 1791, Louvre Once he returned to France, Girodet painted many portraits, including some of members of the Bonaparte family. In 1806, in competition with the Sabines of David, he exhibited his Sc√®ne de d√©luge (Louvre), which was awarded the decennial prize. In 1808 he produced the Reddition de Vienne and Atala au tombeau, a work which won immense popularity, by its fortunate choice of subject ‚Äì Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand's novel Atala, first published in 1801 ‚Äì and its remarkable departure from the theatricality of Girodet's usual manner. He would return to his theatrical style in La R√©volte du Caire (1810). Later life Self- portrait from 1824, Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts d'Orl√©ans The Funeral of Atala (Fun√©railles d'Atala or Atala au tombeau), 1808, Louvre Girodet was a member of the Academy of Painting and of the Institut de France, a knight of the Order of Saint Michael, and officer of the Legion of Honour. Among his pupils were Hyacinthe Aubry-Lecomte, Augustin Van den Berghe the Younger, Fran√ßois Edouard Bertin, Ang√©lique Bouillet, Alexandre-Marie Colin, Marie Philippe Coupin de la Couperie, Henri Decaisne, Paul-Emile Destouches, Achille Dev√©ria, Eug√®ne Dev√©ria, Savinien Edme Dubourjal, Joseph Ferdinand Lancrenon, Antonin Marie Moine, Jean Jacques Fran√ßois Monanteuil, Henry Bonaventure Monnier, Rosalie Renaudin, Johann Heinrich Richter, Fran√ßois Edme Ricois, Joseph Nicolas Robert-Fleury, and Philippe Jacques Van Br√©e.Anne Louis Girodet- Trioson in the RKD In his forties his powers began to fail, and his habit of working at night and other excesses weakened his constitution. In the Salon of 1812 he exhibited only a T√™te de Vierge; in 1819 Pygmalion et Galat√©e showed a further decline of strength. In 1824, the year in which he produced his portraits of Cathelineau and Bonchamps, Girodet died on December 9 in Paris. At a sale of his effects after his death, some of his drawings realized enormous prices. Tomb at P√®re Lachaise Posthumously published work Bust of the painter (1827) by Jean-Baptiste Roman, Louvre Girodet produced a vast quantity of illustrations, amongst which may be cited those for the Didot editions of the works of Virgil (1798) and Racine (1801‚Äì1805). Fifty-four of his designs for the works of the ancient Greek poet Anacreon were engraved by M. Ch√¢tillon. Girodet used much of his time on literary composition. His poem Le Peintre (rather a string of commonplaces), together with poor imitations of classical poets, and essays on Le G√©nie and La Gr√¢ce, were published posthumously in 1829, with a biographical notice by his friend Coupin de la Couperie. Delecluze, in his Louis David et son temps, has also a brief life of Girodet. Girodet: Romantic Rebel at the Art Institute of Chicago (2006) was the first retrospective in the United States devoted to the works of Anne- Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson. The exhibition assembled more than 100 seminal works (about 60 paintings and 40 drawings) that demonstrated the artist's range as a painter as well as a draftsman. Analysis of the works Girodet was trained in the neoclassical style of his teacher, Jacques-Louis David, seen in his treatment of the male nude body and his reference to models from the Renaissance and Classical antiquity. However, he also deviated from this style in several ways. The peculiarities which mark Girodet's position as the herald of the romantic movement are already evident in his Sleep of Endymion (1791, also called Effet de lune or \\"effect of the Moon\\"). Although the subject matter and pose are inspired by classical precedents, Girodet's diffuse lighting is more theatrical and atmospheric. The androgynous depiction of the sleeping shepherd Endymion is also noteworthy. These early romantic effects were even more notable in his Ossian, exhibited in 1802. Girodet portrayed recently killed Napoleonic soldiers being welcomed into Valhalla by the fictional bard Ossian. The painting is striking for its inclusion of phosphorescent meteors, vaporous luminosity, and spectral protagonists. The same coupling of classic and romantic elements marks Girodet's Danae (1799) and his Quatre Saisons, executed for the king of Spain (repeated for Compi√®gne), and shows itself to a ludicrous extent in his Fingal (Leuchtenberg collection, St. Petersburg), executed for Napoleon in 1802. Girodet can be seen here combining aspects of his classical training and traditional education with new literary trends, popular scientific spectacles, and a consummate interest in the strange and the bizarre. In this way his work announces the rise of a romantic aesthetic which prizes individuality, expression, and imagination over an adherence to classical academic precedents.

Born at Juvardeil, Anjou, he gained his first military experience in the American War of Independence, and on his return to France was made a captain of grenadiers in the French royal army. He was a staunch defender of the French monarchy, and at the outbreak of the Revolution, resigned his command and retired to his ch√¢teau at Saint-Florent-le-Vieil. Shortly before the revolution broke out, Bonchamps feared for his king and country and requested to be reinstated. In the spring of 1793 he was chosen leader by the insurgents of the Vend√©e, and his directives were able to secure a large amount of supplies and weapons that would greatly aid the counterrevolution. He was present at the taking of Bressuire, Thouars, and of Fontenay-le-Comte - where he was wounded but recovered. Dissensions among their leaders weakened the insurgents, and at the bloody battle of Cholet (October 1793) the Vend√©ans sustained a severe defeat and Bonchamps was mortally wounded. He died the next day. His last act was the pardoning of five thousand Republican prisoners, whom his troops had sworn to kill in revenge for his death. Bonchamps was one of the best tactical leaders of the Vend√©ans and his death was an important victory for the republican forces. He was admired by the Christian monarchists and revolutionaries alike. A statue of him by Pierre Jean David stands in the church of Saint-Florent-le- Vieil.

It is the second-tallest mountain in South Korea after Jeju Island's Hallasan, and the tallest mountain in mainland South Korea. The 1915m-high mountain is located in Jirisan National Park. The park spans three provinces (North, South Jeolla and South Gyeongsang) and is the largest in South Korea. The largest proportion of the national park is in the province of South Gyeongsang. The highest peak of the mountain, Cheonhwangbong is also located in this province. Another well-known peak is Samshin-bong (Three Spirits Peak). Jirisan is at the southern end of the Sobaek and Baekdudaegan mountain ranges, the \\"spine\\" of the Korean Peninsula incorporating the Sobaek mountain range and most of the Taebaek mountain range. There are seven major Buddhist temples on Jirisan. Hwaeomsa is the largest and best-known temple among these. It contains several national treasures, mostly stone artworks from about 600‚Äì900 CE. The mountain is also home to the Cheonghak-dong (Azure Crane Village) alpine valley, which includes the Samseonggung (Three Sages Palace), which is a site celebrating one of Korea's foundation myths. Every year more than 280,000 people visit Jirisan. Summer and autumn are the most popular visiting seasons. The mountain is advertised as having 10 scenic views. These are ‚ÄòSunrise from Cheonwang- bong peak‚Äô, ‚ÄòNogodan Sea of Clouds‚Äô, ‚ÄòBanyabong‚Äôs Nakjo‚Äô, ‚ÄòFull moon at Byukso-ryung‚Äô, ‚ÄòPiagol Autumn Leaves‚Äô, ‚ÄòRoyal Azalea Blossoming‚Äô, ‚ÄòChilseon Valley‚Äô, ‚ÄòSeomjincheongryu‚Äô, ‚ÄòBuril water fall‚Äô, ‚ÄòYeonha-Sunkyung‚Äô. Jirisan National Park has several hiking routes.  Legends  At the entrance to Baemsagol Valley, some 1,300 years ago, there used to be Songnimsa Temple. This temple practiced an annual rite on the Chilwolbaekjung holiday (full moon day of July by the lunar calendar) wherein they selected the most pious monk and prayed earnestly for his safe passage to paradise as a deity. In a certain year, the then highest monk Seosandaesa visited the temple, heard about this Buddhist rite, and guessed that there must be a secret behind it. Seosandesa allowed that year's chosen monk to pray wearing a silk robe anointed with poison, linked by a silk thread to Sinseodae Terrace. Seosandaesa then hid himself behind a rock to watch. At around 1 am, an imugi anaconda, which was sorry not to have turned into a dragon, slithered up from the valley below Sinseondae Terrace to the sound of roaring water. The imugi jumped upon the praying monk, bit him in the mouth, and disappeared into the water. Seosandaesa returned to the temple, and waited until dawn. Early in the morning, he, together with the villagers, went to Sinseondae Terrace to find that the imugi had died dead, having failed to swallow the whole body of the monk. Seosandaesa now came to know about Songnimsa Temple's secret of sacrificing a monk to an imugi every year. Thereafter, the valley was named as Baemsagol, which means the valley where an imugi, which failed to become a dragon, died. The village at the entrance to Baemsagol Valley was named Banseon (meaning a \\"half deity\\") in memory of the dead monk because he was sacrificed without becoming a deity. Jirisan peak  Peaks  Samshinbong (bong means \\"peak\\") is high and a popular, but strenuous, day-hike from the Ssanggye Temple entry point (it is the closest major peak from this trailhead). From Ssanggyesa, a trail winds up 2.3 km to Bul-il Falls. From the left turn in the path just before the waterfall, the track continues 6.9 km to the peak (for a grand round-trip total of 18.4 km). Starting from Ssanggyesa (the sa suffix indicates a Buddhist temple), the peak can be reached in 4 hours at a steady pace. There is a helipad near the summit for emergency services. It takes about 3 hours to get down; it is an extremely steep hike. Climbers are advised to bring plenty of water as it is only available from streams beyond the temple grounds. This peak can also be climbed from the back of Cheonghak-dong Village. History During the Korean War, North Korean troops occupied the region in 1950. After the United Nations forces took the area in 1951, a considerable number of North Koreans remained in the mountains, where they continued a guerrilla war, until they were finally beaten in 1955, two years after the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed by the belligerents. The Republic of Korea issued an \\"Anti-Guerrilla Warfare Service Medal\\" for its troops who fought in the area and a movie about the fighting was later produced.  Ecosystem  Jirisan is known to grow about 1,500 kinds of plants, many of which are endemic. This is the largest growth of plants in South Korea except for Mt. Halla. Some plants were first found in Mt. Jiri and have 'Jirisan' or 'Jirisan'. However, some plants do not have 'geori' or 'geori' attached to them even though they were first found on Mt. Jiri. In popular culture The 2015 movie The Tiger takes place in the Jirisan mountain area.

He was known among his followers as the Saint of Anjou. He was a well known peddler in Anjou. When the Kingdom of France was abolished and the French First Republic was established, the revolutionaries committed atrocities against the civilians of the Vend√©e during the Reign of Terror. Cathelineau rallied an army of peasants loyal to the monarchy and the Church and waged an uprising against the revolutionaries, capturing several villages and castles, leading more volunteers to follow him. As the War in the Vend√©e grew in success, Cathelineau joined forces with other counterrevolutionary leaders and was made generalissimo of the Catholic and Royal Army. He inspired his troops by fighting alongside them on the front lines, which proved to be his downfall. In the summer of 1793, while he and his men were storming the city of Nantes, Cathelineau was shot down by a sniper and died soon afterwards. Without his leadership the royalists were defeated and soon they broke up into different factions. After the Bourbon Restoration, in honour of the heroism and sacrifices of Cathelineau, his family were ennobled. Life =Early life= Engraving of Jacques Cathelineau Born at Le Pin-en-Mauges, in the lands now forming the d√©partement of Maine-et-Loire, he became well known in Anjou, a region over which he travelled as a peddler and alleged dealer in contraband goods. He was a devout Catholic, and supported the Church's traditional role in French society. His great physical strength, charisma, and piety enabled him to command the respect of his fellow Vendeans. In the first years of the Revolution, Cathelineau joined the numbers of Vendean peasants disgusted by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, the draft laws, and the execution of King Louis XVI of France. He collected an army of peasants and waged a private war against the government of the First French Republic. =Rebellion= Jules Gabriel Hubert-Sauzeau, 1900 As the war developed, the Vendeans became incensed by the massacres and atrocities committed by the revolutionaries on both Catholic clergy and their fellow Vendeans. On 10 March 1793, young people from the district of Saint-Florent-le-Vieil rebelled against the National Convention and beat and dispersed the local armed force. After learning of these events, Cathelineau left his cottage, gathered his neighbors, and convinced them that the only way to end the Reign of Terror was to openly take up arms and attack the Republicans. He took the initiative to gather all able-bodied men from his village to confront the Republicans. On 12 March, twenty-seven young men followed him, arming themselves in haste with any weapon they could find, and marched on Jallais, sounding the alarm and recruiting a crowd of peasants. Arriving at Jallais on 13 March, defended by 80 Republicans and a cannon, he captured the ch√¢teau and seized the cannon‚Äî known to the Vend√©ans as \\"The Missionary\\". Soon the town Chemill√© was also captured on 14 March, and many more volunteers came to reinforce the troops of Cathelineau. By 14 March he already had 3,000 men under arms, and with the help of Jean-Nicolas Stofflet marched on Cholet where he was again victorious. Afterwards they joined force with the other Vend√©an leaders Charles de Bonchamps and Maurice d'Elb√©e. Cathelineau continued to have a huge influence on the peasants as the Royalists captured Vihiers and Chalonnes. The campaign was then interrupted, as insurgents returned home to celebrate Easter. On 9 April his bands were again under arms, but he had to evacuate Chemill√© and withdraw to Tiffauges. With 3,000 men, he joined Stofflet and took Cholet, Vihiers, and Chalonnes. He seized Beaupr√©au on 23 April and won the Battle of Thouars on 5 May. Having been pushed back to La Ch√¢taigneraie on 14 May, the Vend√©ens were defeated in Fontenay-le-Comte by General Alexis Chalbos on 16 May. Cathelineau retaliated by defeating the Republicans at Montreuil-Bellay and Saumur on 9 June 1793. After the Battle of Saumur and capture of the city, the insurgency had taken such a level of importance that the Royalist leaders thought it necessary to ensure the agreement of their operations and give command to one. Beloved by the troops, Cathelineau was proclaimed by Louis Marie de Lescure and Maurice d'Elb√©e as generalissimo of the Catholic and Royal Army by the assembled heads the Vend√©e on 12 June 1793. The peasants were further inspired by one of them being given army command.¬´ Cathelineau (Jacques) ¬ª dans Jean Tulard, Jean-Fran√ßois Fayard, Alfred Fierro, Histoire et dictionnaire de la R√©volution fran√ßaise, Paris, Robert Laffont, 1987, . =Death= Arms of the Cathelineau family After passing Angers on 23 June 1793 without difficulty, the combined Catholic and Royal Army led the storming of Nantes on 29 June. Cathelineau appeared before the city of Nantes at the head of 40,000 men, while Charette assisted him with 10,000 insurgents from Retz and Bas-Poitou. Cathelineau had entered the town in spite of the resistance of General Jean-Baptiste Canclaux and attacked the gate of Rennes. While penetrating Place Viarme, he was fatally wounded by a sniper from a window. With their leader incapacitated, the Vend√©an army was defeated and soon divided into factions. He was transported to Saint-Florent-le-Vieil, where he died of his wounds on 14 July 1793. His body lies in the Cathelineau Chapel in Saint-Florent.. Numerous relatives of Cathelineau also perished in the war of Vend√©e and the reprisals that followed. The remainder of his family was ennobled under the Bourbon Restoration. His son Jacques-Joseph Cathelineau was knighted after the Restoration and his grand-son Henry Cathelineau was an officer during the Franco-Prussian War. Canonization Given the great piety and courage Cathelineau shown in defense of the faith, his beatification was proposed at the end of the 19th century. The most informative parts of the diocesan process were lost in a fire of the bishopric archives of Angers during the bombing in 1944. He remains venerated as a holy man, even though he is not recognized as such by the Church.

In archaeological research, Illyrian names are predominant in western Dardania (present-day Kosovo), while Thracian names are mostly found in eastern Dardania (present-day south-eastern Serbia). Thracian names are absent in western Dardania; some Illyrian names appear in the eastern parts. Thus, their identification as either an Illyrian or Thracian tribe has been a subject of debate; the ethnolinguistic relationship between the two groups being largely uncertain and debated itself as well. The correspondence of Illyrian names - including those of the ruling elite - in Dardania with those of the southern Illyrians suggests a \\"thracianization\\" of parts of Dardania. Strabo in his geographica mentions them as one of the three strongest Illyrian peoples, the other two being the Ardiaei and Autariatae. Strabo's geography - http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0239 The Kingdom of Dardania was attested since the 4th century BC in ancient sources reporting the wars the Dardanians waged against Macedon. After the Celtic invasion of the Balkans weakened the state of the Macedonians and Paeonians, the political and military role of the Dardanians began to grow in the region. They expanded their state to the area of Paeonia which definitely disappeared from history, and to some territories of the southern Illyrians. The Dardanians strongly pressured the Macedonians, using every opportunity to attack them. However the Macedonians quickly recovered and consolidated their state, and the Dardanians lost their important political role. The strengthening of the Illyrian (Ardiaean‚ÄìLabeatan) state on their western borders also contributed to the restriction of Dardanian warlike actions towards their neighbors. The Dardani were the most stable and conservative ethnic element among the peoples of the central Balkans, retaining for several centuries an enduring presence in the region. Names The ethnonym was of the Dardani has been attested in ancient Greek literature as Dardaneis, Dardanioi and Dardanoi, and in Latin as Dardani. The term used for their territory was Dardanike (), while other tribal areas had more unspecified terms, such as Autariaton khora (, \\"land of Autariatae\\". The names Dardania appears to be connected to Albanian dardh√´. In 1854, Johann Georg von Hahn was the first to propose that the names Dardanoi and Dardania were related to the Albanian word dardh√´ (\\"pear, pear-tree\\"), stemming from Proto-Albanian *dardƒÅ, itself a derivative of derdh, \\"to tip out, pour\\", or *derda in Proto- Albanian.Orel, Vladimir E.

Zeitschrift f√ºr Balkanologie 34: 163-200 online paper A common Albanian toponym with the same root is Dardha, found in various parts of Albania, including Dardha in Berat, Dardha in Kor√ßa, Dardha in Librazhd, Dardha in Puka, Dardhas in Pogradec, Dardhaj in Mirdita, and Dardh√´s in P√´rmet. Dardha in Puka is recorded as Darda in a 1671 ecclesiastical report and on a 1688 map by a Venetian cartographer. Dardha is also the name of an Albanian tribe in the northern part of the District of Dibra. In ancient sources The Dardani in the Balkans were linked by ancient Greek and Roman writers with a people of the same name who lived in northwest Anatolia (i.e. the Dardanoi), from which the name Dardanelles is derived. Other parallel ethnic names in the Balkans and Anatolia, respectively include: Eneti and Enetoi, Bryges and Phryges, Moesians and Mysians. These parallels are considered too great to be a mere coincidence. According to a current explanation, the connection is likely related to the large-scale movement of peoples that occurred at the end of the Bronze Age (around 1200 BC), when the attacks of the 'Sea Peoples' afflicted some of the established powers around the eastern Mediterranean.; ; ; . The rulers of some of the great powers of antiquity, such as Epirus, Macedonia and Rome, claimed a Trojan ancestry linking themselves to Dardanus, who according to the tradition was the founder of the Trojan ruling house. But if Dardanus and the tribes over which he ruled were descended from the Balkan people, who were considered \\"barbarians\\" by the Romans, it would have been an embarrassment. Thus, by Roman times the connection was explained by a movement that occurred in the opposite direction proposing that Dardanus caused the settling of the Dardani west of the Thracians, accepting the version that the Dardani were a people related to the Trojans, but that they had degenerated to a state of \\"barbarism\\" in their new settlement. =In Greek mythology= In Greek mythology, Dardanos (ŒîŒ¨œÅŒ¥Œ±ŒΩŒøœÇ), one of the sons of Illyrius (the others being Enchelus, Autarieus, Maedus, Taulas, and Perrhaebus) was the eponymous ancestor of the Dardanoi (ŒîŒ¨œÅŒ¥Œ±ŒΩŒøŒπ).Appian, The Foreign Wars, III, 1.2 History =4th century BC= The Dardani are first mentioned in the 4th century BC, when their king Bardylis succeeded in bringing various tribes into a single organization. Under his leadership the Dardani defeated the Macedonians and Molossians several times. At this time they were strong enough to rule Macedonia through a puppet king in 392-391 BC. In 385-384 they allied with Dionysius I of Syracuse and defeated the Molossians, killing up to 15,000 of their soldiers and ruling their territory for a short period. Their continuous invasions forced Amyntas III of Macedon to pay them a tribute in 372 BC. They returned raiding the Molossians in 360. In 359 BC Bardylis won a decisive battle against Macedonian king Perdiccas III, whom he killed himself, while 4,000 Macedonian soldiers fell, and the cities of upper Macedonia were occupied. Following this disastrous defeat, king Philip II took control of the Macedonian throne in 358 and reaffirmed the treaty with the Dardani, marrying princess Audata, probably the daughter or niece of Bardylis. The time of this marriage is somewhat disputed while some historians maintain that the marriage happened after the defeat of Bardylis. This gave Philip II valuable time to gather his forces against those Dardani who were still under Bardylis, defeating them at the Erigon Valley by killing about 7,000 of them, eliminating the Dardani menace for some time. In 334 BC, under the leadership of Cleitus, the son of Bardylis, the Dardani, in alliance with other Illyrian tribes attacked Macedonia held by Alexander the Great. The Dardani managed to capture some cities but were eventually defeated by Alexander's forces. =3rd‚Äì1st century BC= Celts were present in Dardania in 279 BC. The Dardanian king offered to help the Macedonians with 20,000 soldiers against the Celts, but this was refused by Macedonian king Ptolemy Keraunos. Dardani were a constant threat to the Macedonian kingdom. In 230 under Longarus they captured Bylazora from the PaioniansA history of Macedonia Volume 5 of Hellenistic culture and society, Author: Robert Malcolm Errington, University of California Press, 1990 , , p. 185 and in 229 they again attacked Macedonia, defeating Demetrius II in an important battle.A history of Macedonia Volume 5 of Hellenistic culture and society, Robert Malcolm Errington, University of California Press, 1990, , p. 174 In this period their influence on the region grew and some other Illyrian tribes deserted Teuta, joining the Dardani under Longarus and forcing Teuta to call off her expedition forces in Epirus. When Philip V rose to the Macedonian throne, skirmishing with Dardani began in 220-219 BC and he managed to capture Bylazora from them in 217 BC. Skirmishes continued in 211 and in 209 when a force of Dardani under Aeropus, probably a pretender to the Macedonian throne, captured Lychnidus and looted Macedonia taking 20.000 prisoners and retreating before Philip's forces could reach them. In 201 Bato of Dardania along with Pleuratus the Illyrian and Amynander king of Athamania, cooperated with Roman consul Sulpicius in his expedition against Philip V. Being always under the menace of Dardanian attacks on Macedonia, around 183 BC Philip V made an alliance with the Bastarnae and invited them to settle in Polog, the region of Dardania closest to Macedonia. A joint campaign of the Bastarnae and Macedonians against the Dardanians was organized, but Philip V died and his son Perseus of Macedon withdrew his forces from the campaign. The Bastarnae crossed the Danube in huge numbers and although they didn't meet the Macedonians, they continued the campaign. Some 30,000 Bastarnae under the command of Clondicus seem to have defeated the Dardani. In 179 BC, the Bastarnae conquered the Dardani, who later in 174 pushed them out, in a war which proved catastrophic, with a few years later, in 170 BC, the Macedonians defeating the Dardani. Macedonia and Illyria became Roman protectorates in 168 BC. The Scordisci, a tribe of Celtic origin, most likely subdued the Dardani in the mid-2nd century BC, after which there was no mention of the Dardani for a long time. =Roman period= Macedonia and Illyria became Roman protectorates in 168 BC. In 97 BC the Dardani are mentioned again, defeated by the Macedonian Roman army. In 88 BC, the Dardani invaded the Roman province of Macedonia together with the Scordisci and the Maedi. According to Strabo's Geographica (compiled 20 BC‚Äì23 AD), they were divided into two sub-groups, the Galabri and the Thunatae.Strabo: Books 1‚Äë7, 15‚Äë17 in English translation, ed. H. L. Jones (1924), at LacusCurtius Dardania and the northern Balkans in Late Antiquity It seems quite probable that the Dardani actually lost independence in 28 BC thus, the final occupation of Dardania by Rome has been connected with the beginnings of Augustus' rule in 6 AD, when they were finally conquered by Rome. Dardania was conquered by Gaius Scribonius Curio and the Latin language was soon adopted as the main language of the tribe as many other conquered and Romanized.http://www.balkaninstitut.com/pdf/izdanja/B_XXXVII_2007.pdf Aftermath and legacy At first, Dardania was not a separate Roman province, but became a region in the province of Moesia Superior in 87 AD. Emperor Diocletian later (284) made Dardania into a separate province with its capital at Naissus (Ni≈°). During the Byzantine administration (in the 6th century), there was a Byzantine province of Dardania that included cities of Ulpiana, Scupi, Stobi, Justiniana Prima, and others. The Illyrian language disappeared, with almost nothing of it surviving, except for names.

Polity It is assumed that the Dardanian kingdom was made up of many tribes and tribal groups, confirmed by Strabo. The first and most prominent king of the Dardani was Bardylis who ruled from 385 BC to 358 BC. Bardylis' descendance (and inheritance) is unclear; Hammond believed that Bardylis II was the son of Bardylis, earlier having believed it to have been Cleitus (as per Arrian), while Wilkes believed Cleitus to be the son. Tribal chiefs Longarus and his son Bato took part in the wars against Romans and Macedonians. The Dardanians, in all their history, always had separate domains from the rest of the Illyrians. The term used for their territory was (), while other tribal areas had more unspecified terms, such as Autariaton khora (), for the \\"land of Autariatae.\\" Other than that, little to no data exists on the territory of the Dardani prior to Roman conquest, especially on its southern extent. Culture Graves from the 6th and 5th centuries BCE in Romaj√´ contain long iron bars which were placed in the tombs are a means of payment to the afterlife. They indicate that the tribe of the Dardani had developed a concept about the afterlife as shown later in other archaeological material like the votive monument of Smir√´. The weapons included double-edged axes (Labrys), which might have been used in a ritualistic manner related to sun worship which was prevalent in the northern Illyrian tribes According to Ancient Greek and Roman historiography, the tribe was viewed of as \\"extremely barbaric\\". Claudius Aelianus and other writers wrote that they bathed only threeDictionary of Classical Antiquities (1898) \\"...whence it is said of the Dardanians, an Illyrian people, that they bathe only thrice in their lives‚Äîat birth, marriage, and after death.\\" times in their lives. At birth, when they were wed and after they died. Strabo refers to them as wild and dwelling in dirty caves under dung-hills.Strabo,7.5, \\"The Dardanians are so utterly wild that they dig caves beneath their dung-hills and live there, but still they care for music, always making use of musical instruments, both flutes and stringed instruments\\" This however may have had to do not with cleanliness, as bathing had to do with monetary status from the viewpoint of the Greeks. At the same time, Strabo writes that they had some interest in music as they owned and used flutes and corded instruments. Dardanian slaves or freedmen at the time of the Roman conquest were clearly of Paleo-Balkan origin, according to their personal names. It has been noted that personal names were mostly of the \\"Central-Dalmatian type\\". =Language= An extensive study based on onomastics has been undertaken by Radoslav Katiƒçiƒá which puts the Dardani language area in the Central Illyrian area (\\"Central Illyrian\\" consisting of most of former Yugoslavia, north of southern Montenegro to the west of Morava, excepting ancient Liburnia in the northwest, but perhaps extending into Pannonia in the north).Katiƒçiƒá, Radoslav (1964b) \\"Die neuesten Forschungen √ºber die einhemiche Sprachschist in den Illyrischen Provinzen\\" in Benac (1964a) 9-58 Katiƒçiƒá, Radoslav (1965b) \\"Zur frage der keltischen und panonischen Namengebieten im r√∂mischen Dalmatien\\" ANUBiH 3 GCBI 1, 53-76Katiƒçiƒá, Radoslav.

Development The first prototype of the plane, with a factory designation KhAI-5 (–•–ê–Ü-5), flew in June 1936. Despite a lower performance, the aircraft won a contest against another reconnaissance plane design, the Kochyerigin R-9, and was accepted for a production with the military designation R-10 ('R' indicated razvyedchik meaning reconnaissance in Russian). It was a modern design for the time. 493 R-10s were manufactured in the Kharkiv and Saratov aviation plants by early 1940. The first series showed some teething problems, which resulted in Iosif Nyeman being arrested by the NKVD on December 11, 1938 under the accusation of sabotage and espionage, a common accusation at the time. In 1938 a variant, the KhAI-5bis was tested with an M-25E engine, achieving a speed of . In 1938, the KhAI-52 ground attack aircraft, based on the R-10, was also developed. It was powered by a Shvetsov M-63 radial engine and armed with seven machine guns and bombs. A production run of an experimental series of 10 aircraft was prepared, but it was cancelled with Nyeman's arrest. Some production R-10s were fitted with more powerful Tumansky M-88, Shvetsov M-62 and M-63 engines. Over 60 aircraft, withdrawn from the Air Force, were used from 1940 as mail carriers by Aeroflot, under the designation PS-5 (Russian: –ü–°-5), with 3 passenger seats. Combat use The aircraft entered service in the Soviet Air Force in 1937, replacing some Polikarpov R-5s. R-10s were first used in combat in the 1939 Soviet-Japanese Battle of Khalkhin Gol. Then, they were used in the initial stage of World War II, starting with use in the invasion of Poland (without combat encounters) and against Finland in the Winter War (1939‚Äì1940). R-10s were next used in the first period of the German-Soviet war, following the German attack on June 22, 1941. By this time, they were outdated and suffered heavy losses, as did the rest of the Soviet Air Force. Many planes were destroyed on the ground. They were used as tactical reconnaissance aircraft, and, in need, also as light bombers. Later many were used as night bombers, to reduce losses from opposing fighters. The remaining R-10s were withdrawn from combat service in 1943 although two Finnish pilots claimed R-10s in 1944. Description The aircraft was conventional in layout, with a low mounted, plywood-covered wooden cantilever wing. The fuselage was of semi- monocoque construction. The undercarriage retracted into the wings. The crew consisted a pilot and an observer/rear gunner in a turret with a single machine gun. In the observer compartment's floor there was an AFA-13 camera for reconnaissance duties. Between the crew compartments there were fuel tanks and a vertical bomb bay. The maximum bomb load was (6 √ó or 10 √ó bombs). The plane was powered by various variants of the Shvetsov M-25 and related M-63 radial engines, a development of the Wright R-1820 built under licence, which spun an all-metal two-bladed Hamilton Standard variable-pitch propeller.

Stofflet established his headquarters in the Forest of Vezins. But his quarrels with another Vend√©an leader, Fran√ßois de Charette, and the defeats sustained by the Vend√©an troops, led him to give in his submission and to accept the terms of the Treaty of La Jaunaye with the National Convention (2 May 1795).

He is best known for his observations of the variable star Algol (Beta Persei) in 1782.  Life and work  John Goodricke, named after his great grandfather Sir John Goodricke 1617‚Äì1670 (see Goodricke baronets of Ribston Hall), was born in Groningen in the Netherlands, but lived most of his life in England. He became deaf in early childhood due to a severe illness. His parents sent him to Thomas Braidwood's Academy, a school for deaf pupils in Edinburgh, and in 1778 to the Warrington Academy. After leaving Warrington, Goodricke returned to live with his parents in York. There, he became friends with his neighbour Edward Pigott, whose father Nathaniel Pigott had built a sophisticated private observatory. Edward was already interested in variable stars, and he gave Goodricke a list of those that he thought were worthy of observation. Goodricke is credited with discovering the periodic variation of Œ≤ Lyrae and Œ¥ Cephei, the prototypical example of the Cepheid variable stars. Although several stars were already known to vary in apparent magnitude, Goodricke was the first to propose a mechanism to account for this. He suggested that Algol is what is now known as an eclipsing binary. He presented his findings to the Royal Society in May 1783, and for this work, the Society awarded him the Copley Medal for that year. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 16 April 1786. He never learned of this honour however, as he died four days later from pneumonia. He never married.

Goodricke was buried at Hunsingore Church in Yorkshire, along with many of his relatives. Today there is a marker in York near the site of John Goodricke's observatory. Between October 2005 and March 2006 Sean Ellingham and James Valner from the University of York undertook a project to find the position of Goodricke's observatory using the data he recorded. A 1949 study by Sidney Melmore had shown that Goodricke worked from the Treasurer's House (now owned by the National Trust) very near York Minster. By re-creating Goodricke's observations, the two York students were able to conclude that he had observed from the easternmost window of the second floor, looking south towards the Minster. However, records indicate that the Goodricke family had rented rooms from Edward Topham, the then owner of the northwest wing of the house. Goodricke College at the University of York is named after Goodricke. There is also a modern sculpture named Algol in the grounds. Honors Asteroid 3116 Goodricke is named for John Goodricke. The University of York has a Goodricke College named after John Goodricke. The Goodricke-Pigott Observatory is a private astronomical observatory in Tucson, Arizona, named after the two late-eighteenth century astronomers and friends who lived in York, England, John Goodricke and Edward Pigott. It was formally dedicated on 26 October 1996, and observations began that evening with imaging of Comet Hale‚ÄìBopp. In 2012 a non-profit organisation named after John Goodricke was established in Armenia by a group of amateur astronomers. In 1984 a planetarium show about John Goodricke was created specifically for deaf students by the HOSS Planetarium.

False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not ‚Äì in other words, a query returns either \\"possibly in set\\" or \\"definitely not in set\\". Elements can be added to the set, but not removed (though this can be addressed with the counting Bloom filter variant); the more items added, the larger the probability of false positives. Bloom proposed the technique for applications where the amount of source data would require an impractically large amount of memory if \\"conventional\\" error-free hashing techniques were applied. He gave the example of a hyphenation algorithm for a dictionary of 500,000 words, out of which 90% follow simple hyphenation rules, but the remaining 10% require expensive disk accesses to retrieve specific hyphenation patterns. With sufficient core memory, an error-free hash could be used to eliminate all unnecessary disk accesses; on the other hand, with limited core memory, Bloom's technique uses a smaller hash area but still eliminates most unnecessary accesses. For example, a hash area only 15% of the size needed by an ideal error-free hash still eliminates 85% of the disk accesses. More generally, fewer than 10 bits per element are required for a 1% false positive probability, independent of the size or number of elements in the set. Algorithm description {x, y, z} }}, because it hashes to one bit- array position containing 0. For this figure, and . An empty Bloom filter is a bit array of bits, all set to 0. There must also be different hash functions defined, each of which maps or hashes some set element to one of the array positions, generating a uniform random distribution. Typically, is a small constant which depends on the desired false error rate , while is proportional to and the number of elements to be added. To add an element, feed it to each of the hash functions to get array positions. Set the bits at all these positions to 1. To query for an element (test whether it is in the set), feed it to each of the hash functions to get array positions. If any of the bits at these positions is 0, the element is definitely not in the set; if it were, then all the bits would have been set to 1 when it was inserted. If all are 1, then either the element is in the set, or the bits have by chance been set to 1 during the insertion of other elements, resulting in a false positive. In a simple Bloom filter, there is no way to distinguish between the two cases, but more advanced techniques can address this problem. The requirement of designing different independent hash functions can be prohibitive for large . For a good hash function with a wide output, there should be little if any correlation between different bit-fields of such a hash, so this type of hash can be used to generate multiple \\"different\\" hash functions by slicing its output into multiple bit fields. Alternatively, one can pass different initial values (such as 0, 1, ..., ‚àí 1) to a hash function that takes an initial value; or add (or append) these values to the key. For larger and/or , independence among the hash functions can be relaxed with negligible increase in false positive rate.; . (Specifically, show the effectiveness of deriving the indices using enhanced double hashing or triple hashing, variants of double hashing that are effectively simple random number generators seeded with the two or three hash values.) Removing an element from this simple Bloom filter is impossible because there is no way to tell which of the bits it maps to should be cleared. Although setting any one of those bits to zero suffices to remove the element, it would also remove any other elements that happen to map onto that bit. Since the simple algorithm provides no way to determine whether any other elements have been added that affect the bits for the element to be removed, clearing any of the bits would introduce the possibility of false negatives. One-time removal of an element from a Bloom filter can be simulated by having a second Bloom filter that contains items that have been removed. However, false positives in the second filter become false negatives in the composite filter, which may be undesirable. In this approach re-adding a previously removed item is not possible, as one would have to remove it from the \\"removed\\" filter. It is often the case that all the keys are available but are expensive to enumerate (for example, requiring many disk reads). When the false positive rate gets too high, the filter can be regenerated; this should be a relatively rare event. Space and time advantages Bloom filter used to speed up answers in a key-value storage system. Values are stored on a disk which has slow access times. Bloom filter decisions are much faster. However some unnecessary disk accesses are made when the filter reports a positive (in order to weed out the false positives). Overall answer speed is better with the Bloom filter than without the Bloom filter. Use of a Bloom filter for this purpose, however, does increase memory usage. While risking false positives, Bloom filters have a substantial space advantage over other data structures for representing sets, such as self- balancing binary search trees, tries, hash tables, or simple arrays or linked lists of the entries. Most of these require storing at least the data items themselves, which can require anywhere from a small number of bits, for small integers, to an arbitrary number of bits, such as for strings ( are an exception since they can share storage between elements with equal prefixes). However, Bloom filters do not store the data items at all, and a separate solution must be provided for the actual storage. Linked structures incur an additional linear space overhead for pointers. A Bloom filter with a 1% error and an optimal value of , in contrast, requires only about 9.6 bits per element, regardless of the size of the elements. This advantage comes partly from its compactness, inherited from arrays, and partly from its probabilistic nature. The 1% false-positive rate can be reduced by a factor of ten by adding only about 4.8 bits per element. However, if the number of potential values is small and many of them can be in the set, the Bloom filter is easily surpassed by the deterministic bit array, which requires only one bit for each potential element. Hash tables gain a space and time advantage if they begin ignoring collisions and store only whether each bucket contains an entry; in this case, they have effectively become Bloom filters with = 1. Bloom filters also have the unusual property that the time needed either to add items or to check whether an item is in the set is a fixed constant, O(), completely independent of the number of items already in the set. No other constant-space set data structure has this property, but the average access time of sparse hash tables can make them faster in practice than some Bloom filters. In a hardware implementation, however, the Bloom filter shines because its lookups are independent and can be parallelized. To understand its space efficiency, it is instructive to compare the general Bloom filter with its special case when = 1. If = 1, then in order to keep the false positive rate sufficiently low, a small fraction of bits should be set, which means the array must be very large and contain long runs of zeros. The information content of the array relative to its size is low. The generalized Bloom filter ( greater than 1) allows many more bits to be set while still maintaining a low false positive rate; if the parameters ( and ) are chosen well, about half of the bits will be set,, pp. 21‚Äì22 and these will be apparently random, minimizing redundancy and maximizing information content. Probability of false positives The false positive probability p as a function of number of elements n in the filter and the filter size m. An optimal number of hash functions k= (m/n) \\\\ln 2 has been assumed. Assume that a hash function selects each array position with equal probability. If m is the number of bits in the array, the probability that a certain bit is not set to 1 by a certain hash function during the insertion of an element is :1-\\\\frac{1}{m}. If k is the number of hash functions and each has no significant correlation between each other, then the probability that the bit is not set to 1 by any of the hash functions is :\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\right)^k. We can use the well-known identity for e‚àí1 :\\\\lim_{m\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\right)^m = \\\\frac{1}{e} to conclude that, for large m, :\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\right)^k = \\\\left(\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\right)^m\\\\right)^{k/m} \\\\approx e^{-k/m}. If we have inserted n elements, the probability that a certain bit is still 0 is :\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\right)^{kn} \\\\approx e^{-kn/m}; the probability that it is 1 is therefore :1-\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\right)^{kn} \\\\approx 1 - e^{-kn/m}. Now test membership of an element that is not in the set. Each of the k array positions computed by the hash functions is 1 with a probability as above. The probability of all of them being 1, which would cause the algorithm to erroneously claim that the element is in the set, is often given as :\\\\varepsilon = \\\\left(1-\\\\left[1-\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\right]^{kn}\\\\right)^k \\\\approx \\\\left( 1-e^{-kn/m} \\\\right)^k. This is not strictly correct as it assumes independence for the probabilities of each bit being set. However, assuming it is a close approximation we have that the probability of false positives decreases as m (the number of bits in the array) increases, and increases as n (the number of inserted elements) increases. An alternative analysis arriving at the same approximation without the assumption of independence is given by Mitzenmacher and Upfal., pp. 109‚Äì111, 308. After all n items have been added to the Bloom filter, let q be the fraction of the m bits that are set to 0. (That is, the number of bits still set to 0 is qm.) Then, when testing membership of an element not in the set, for the array position given by any of the k hash functions, the probability that the bit is found set to 1 is 1-q. So the probability that all k hash functions find their bit set to 1 is (1 - q)^k. Further, the expected value of q is the probability that a given array position is left untouched by each of the k hash functions for each of the n items, which is (as above) : E[q] = \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\right)^{kn}. It is possible to prove, without the independence assumption, that q is very strongly concentrated around its expected value. In particular, from the Azuma‚ÄìHoeffding inequality, they prove that, p. 308. : \\\\Pr(\\\\leftq - E[q]\\\\right \\\\ge \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{m}) \\\\le 2\\\\exp(-2\\\\lambda^2/kn) Because of this, we can say that the exact probability of false positives is : \\\\sum_{t} \\\\Pr(q = t) (1 - t)^k \\\\approx (1 - E[q])^k = \\\\left(1-\\\\left[1-\\\\frac{1}{m}\\\\right]^{kn}\\\\right)^k \\\\approx \\\\left( 1-e^{-kn/m} \\\\right)^k as before. =Optimal number of hash functions= The number of hash functions, k, must be a positive integer. Putting this constraint aside, for a given m and n, the value of k that minimizes the false positive probability is :k = \\\\frac{m}{n} \\\\ln 2. The required number of bits, m, given n (the number of inserted elements) and a desired false positive probability Œµ (and assuming the optimal value of k is used) can be computed by substituting the optimal value of k in the probability expression above: :\\\\varepsilon = \\\\left( 1-e^{-(\\\\frac m n \\\\ln 2) \\\\frac n m} \\\\right)^{\\\\frac m n\\\\ln 2} which can be simplified to: :\\\\ln\\\\varepsilon = -\\\\frac{m}{n} \\\\left(\\\\ln 2\\\\right)^2. This results in: :m=-\\\\frac{n\\\\ln\\\\varepsilon}{(\\\\ln 2)^2} So the optimal number of bits per element is :\\\\frac{m}{n}=-\\\\frac{\\\\log_2\\\\varepsilon}{\\\\ln 2}\\\\approx-1.44\\\\log_2\\\\varepsilon with the corresponding number of hash functions k (ignoring integrality): :k=-\\\\frac{\\\\ln\\\\varepsilon}{\\\\ln 2}=-\\\\log_2\\\\varepsilon. This means that for a given false positive probability Œµ, the length of a Bloom filter m is proportionate to the number of elements being filtered n and the required number of hash functions only depends on the target false positive probability Œµ. The formula m=-\\\\frac{n\\\\ln\\\\varepsilon}{(\\\\ln 2)^2} is approximate for three reasons. First, and of least concern, it approximates 1 - \\\\frac{1}{m} as e^{-\\\\frac{1}{m}}, which is a good asymptotic approximation (i.e., which holds as m ‚Üí‚àû). Second, of more concern, it assumes that during the membership test the event that one tested bit is set to 1 is independent of the event that any other tested bit is set to 1. Third, of most concern, it assumes that k = \\\\frac{m}{n} \\\\ln 2 is fortuitously integral. Goel and Gupta, however, give a rigorous upper bound that makes no approximations and requires no assumptions. They show that the false positive probability for a finite Bloom filter with m bits ( m > 1), n elements, and k hash functions is at most :\\\\varepsilon \\\\leq \\\\left( 1-e^{-\\\\frac{k(n+0.5)}{m-1}} \\\\right)^k. This bound can be interpreted as saying that the approximate formula \\\\left( 1-e^{-\\\\frac{kn}m} \\\\right)^k can be applied at a penalty of at most half an extra element and at most one fewer bit. Approximating the number of items in a Bloom filter showed that the number of items in a Bloom filter can be approximated with the following formula, : n^* = -\\\\frac{m}{k} \\\\ln \\\\left[ 1 - \\\\frac{X}{m} \\\\right], where n^* is an estimate of the number of items in the filter, m is the length (size) of the filter, k is the number of hash functions, and X is the number of bits set to one. =The union and intersection of sets= Bloom filters are a way of compactly representing a set of items. It is common to try to compute the size of the intersection or union between two sets. Bloom filters can be used to approximate the size of the intersection and union of two sets. showed that for two Bloom filters of length , their counts, respectively can be estimated as : n(A^*) = -\\\\frac{m}{k} \\\\ln \\\\left[ 1 - \\\\frac{A} m \\\\right] and : n(B^*) = -\\\\frac{m}{k} \\\\ln \\\\left[ 1 - \\\\frac{B} m \\\\right]. The size of their union can be estimated as : n(A^*\\\\cup B^*) = -\\\\frac{m}{k} \\\\ln \\\\left[ 1 - \\\\frac{A \\\\cup B} m \\\\right], where n(A \\\\cup B) is the number of bits set to one in either of the two Bloom filters. Finally, the intersection can be estimated as : n(A^*\\\\cap B^*) = n(A^*) + n(B^*) - n(A^* \\\\cup B^*), using the three formulas together. Interesting properties * Unlike a standard hash table using open addressing for collision resolution, a Bloom filter of a fixed size can represent a set with an arbitrarily large number of elements; adding an element never fails due to the data structure \\"filling up\\". However, the false positive rate increases steadily as elements are added until all bits in the filter are set to 1, at which point all queries yield a positive result. With open addressing hashing, false positives are never produced, but performance steadily deteriorates until it approaches linear search. * Union and intersection of Bloom filters with the same size and set of hash functions can be implemented with bitwise OR and AND operations, respectively. The union operation on Bloom filters is lossless in the sense that the resulting Bloom filter is the same as the Bloom filter created from scratch using the union of the two sets. The intersect operation satisfies a weaker property: the false positive probability in the resulting Bloom filter is at most the false- positive probability in one of the constituent Bloom filters, but may be larger than the false positive probability in the Bloom filter created from scratch using the intersection of the two sets. * Some kinds of superimposed code can be seen as a Bloom filter implemented with physical edge-notched cards. An example is Zatocoding, invented by Calvin Mooers in 1947, in which the set of categories associated with a piece of information is represented by notches on a card, with a random pattern of four notches for each category. Examples *Fruit flies use a modified version of Bloom filters to detect novelty of odors, with additional features including similarity of novel odor to that of previously experienced examples, and time elapsed since previous experience of the same odor. *The servers of Akamai Technologies, a content delivery provider, use Bloom filters to prevent \\"one-hit-wonders\\" from being stored in its disk caches. One-hit-wonders are web objects requested by users just once, something that Akamai found applied to nearly three-quarters of their caching infrastructure. Using a Bloom filter to detect the second request for a web object and caching that object only on its second request prevents one-hit wonders from entering the disk cache, significantly reducing disk workload and increasing disk cache hit rates. * Google Bigtable, Apache HBase and Apache Cassandra and PostgreSQL use Bloom filters to reduce the disk lookups for non-existent rows or columns. Avoiding costly disk lookups considerably increases the performance of a database query operation.; . * The Google Chrome web browser used to use a Bloom filter to identify malicious URLs. Any URL was first checked against a local Bloom filter, and only if the Bloom filter returned a positive result was a full check of the URL performed (and the user warned, if that too returned a positive result). * Microsoft Bing (search engine) uses multi-level hierarchical Bloom filters for its search index, BitFunnel. Bloom filters provided lower cost than the previous Bing index, which was based on inverted files. * The Squid Web Proxy Cache uses Bloom filters for cache digests. * Bitcoin uses Bloom filters to speed up wallet synchronization. * The Venti archival storage system uses Bloom filters to detect previously stored data. * The SPIN model checker uses Bloom filters to track the reachable state space for large verification problems. * The Cascading analytics framework uses Bloom filters to speed up asymmetric joins, where one of the joined data sets is significantly larger than the other (often called Bloom join in the database literature). * The Exim mail transfer agent (MTA) uses Bloom filters in its rate-limit feature. * Medium uses Bloom filters to avoid recommending articles a user has previously read. * Ethereum uses Bloom filters for quickly finding logs on the Ethereum blockchain. Alternatives Classic Bloom filters use 1.44\\\\log_2(1/\\\\varepsilon) bits of space per inserted key, where \\\\varepsilon is the false positive rate of the Bloom filter. However, the space that is strictly necessary for any data structure playing the same role as a Bloom filter is only \\\\log_2(1/\\\\varepsilon) per key. Hence Bloom filters use 44% more space than an equivalent optimal data structure. Instead, Pagh et al. provide an optimal- space data structure. Moreover, their data structure has constant locality of reference independent of the false positive rate, unlike Bloom filters, where a lower false positive rate \\\\varepsilon leads to a greater number of memory accesses per query, \\\\log(1/\\\\varepsilon). Also, it allows elements to be deleted without a space penalty, unlike Bloom filters. The same improved properties of optimal space usage, constant locality of reference, and the ability to delete elements are also provided by the cuckoo filter of , an open source implementation of which is available. describe a probabilistic structure based on hash tables, hash compaction, which identify as significantly more accurate than a Bloom filter when each is configured optimally. Dillinger and Manolios, however, point out that the reasonable accuracy of any given Bloom filter over a wide range of numbers of additions makes it attractive for probabilistic enumeration of state spaces of unknown size. Hash compaction is, therefore, attractive when the number of additions can be predicted accurately; however, despite being very fast in software, hash compaction is poorly suited for hardware because of worst-case linear access time. have studied some variants of Bloom filters that are either faster or use less space than classic Bloom filters. The basic idea of the fast variant is to locate the k hash values associated with each key into one or two blocks having the same size as processor's memory cache blocks (usually 64 bytes). This will presumably improve performance by reducing the number of potential memory cache misses. The proposed variants have however the drawback of using about 32% more space than classic Bloom filters. The space efficient variant relies on using a single hash function that generates for each key a value in the range \\\\left[0,n/\\\\varepsilon\\\\right] where \\\\varepsilon is the requested false positive rate. The sequence of values is then sorted and compressed using Golomb coding (or some other compression technique) to occupy a space close to n\\\\log_2(1/\\\\varepsilon) bits. To query the Bloom filter for a given key, it will suffice to check if its corresponding value is stored in the Bloom filter. Decompressing the whole Bloom filter for each query would make this variant totally unusable. To overcome this problem the sequence of values is divided into small blocks of equal size that are compressed separately. At query time only half a block will need to be decompressed on average. Because of decompression overhead, this variant may be slower than classic Bloom filters but this may be compensated by the fact that a single hash function need to be computed. Another alternative to classic Bloom filter is the cuckoo filter, based on space-efficient variants of cuckoo hashing. In this case, a hash table is constructed, holding neither keys nor values, but short fingerprints (small hashes) of the keys. If looking up the key finds a matching fingerprint, then key is probably in the set. One useful property of cuckoo filters is that they are updatable; entries may be dynamically added (with a small probability of failure due to the hash table being full) and removed. describes an approach called an xor filter, where they store fingerprints in a particular type of perfect hash table, producing a filter which is more memory efficient (1.23\\\\log_2(1/\\\\varepsilon) bits per key) and faster than Bloom or cuckoo filters. (The time saving comes from the fact that a lookup requires exactly three memory accesses, which can all execute in parallel.) However, filter creation is more complex than Bloom and cuckoo filters, and it is not possible to modify the set after creation. Extensions and applications There are over 60 variants of Bloom filters, many surveys of the field, and a continuing churn of applications (see e.g., Luo, et al ). Some of the variants differ sufficiently from the original proposal to be breaches from or forks of the original data structure and its philosophy. A treatment which unifies Bloom filters with other work on random projections, compressive sensing, and locality sensitive hashing remains to be done (though see Dasgupta, et al for one attempt inspired by neuroscience). =Cache filtering= 360x360px Content delivery networks deploy web caches around the world to cache and serve web content to users with greater performance and reliability. A key application of Bloom filters is their use in efficiently determining which web objects to store in these web caches. Nearly three- quarters of the URLs accessed from a typical web cache are \\"one-hit-wonders\\" that are accessed by users only once and never again. It is clearly wasteful of disk resources to store one-hit-wonders in a web cache, since they will never be accessed again. To prevent caching one-hit-wonders, a Bloom filter is used to keep track of all URLs that are accessed by users. A web object is cached only when it has been accessed at least once before, i.e., the object is cached on its second request. The use of a Bloom filter in this fashion significantly reduces the disk write workload, since one-hit-wonders are never written to the disk cache. Further, filtering out the one-hit-wonders also saves cache space on disk, increasing the cache hit rates. =Avoiding false positives in a finite universe= Kiss et al described a new construction for the Bloom filter that avoids false positives in addition to the typical non- existence of false negatives. The construction applies to a finite universe from which set elements are taken. It relies on existing non-adaptive combinatorial group testing scheme by Eppstein, Goodrich and Hirschberg. Unlike the typical Bloom filter, elements are hashed to a bit array through deterministic, fast and simple-to-calculate functions. The maximal set size for which false positives are completely avoided is a function of the universe size and is controlled by the amount of allocated memory. =Counting Bloom filters= Counting filters provide a way to implement a delete operation on a Bloom filter without recreating the filter afresh. In a counting filter, the array positions (buckets) are extended from being a single bit to being an multibit counter. In fact, regular Bloom filters can be considered as counting filters with a bucket size of one bit. Counting filters were introduced by . The insert operation is extended to increment the value of the buckets, and the lookup operation checks that each of the required buckets is non-zero. The delete operation then consists of decrementing the value of each of the respective buckets. Arithmetic overflow of the buckets is a problem and the buckets should be sufficiently large to make this case rare. If it does occur then the increment and decrement operations must leave the bucket set to the maximum possible value in order to retain the properties of a Bloom filter. The size of counters is usually 3 or 4 bits. Hence counting Bloom filters use 3 to 4 times more space than static Bloom filters. In contrast, the data structures of and also allow deletions but use less space than a static Bloom filter. Another issue with counting filters is limited scalability. Because the counting Bloom filter table cannot be expanded, the maximal number of keys to be stored simultaneously in the filter must be known in advance. Once the designed capacity of the table is exceeded, the false positive rate will grow rapidly as more keys are inserted. introduced a data structure based on d-left hashing that is functionally equivalent but uses approximately half as much space as counting Bloom filters. The scalability issue does not occur in this data structure. Once the designed capacity is exceeded, the keys could be reinserted in a new hash table of double size. The space efficient variant by could also be used to implement counting filters by supporting insertions and deletions. introduced a new general method based on variable increments that significantly improves the false positive probability of counting Bloom filters and their variants, while still supporting deletions. Unlike counting Bloom filters, at each element insertion, the hashed counters are incremented by a hashed variable increment instead of a unit increment. To query an element, the exact values of the counters are considered and not just their positiveness. If a sum represented by a counter value cannot be composed of the corresponding variable increment for the queried element, a negative answer can be returned to the query. Kim et al. (2019) shows that false positive of Counting Bloom filter decreases from k=1 to a point defined k_{opt}, and increases from k_{opt}to positive infinity, and finds k_{opt}as a function of count threshold. =Decentralized aggregation= Bloom filters can be organized in distributed data structures to perform fully decentralized computations of aggregate functions. Decentralized aggregation makes collective measurements locally available in every node of a distributed network without involving a centralized computational entity for this purpose. =Distributed Bloom filters= Distributed Single Shot Bloom filter for duplicate detection with false positive rate: 6 elements are distributed over 3 PEs, each with a bit array of length 4. During the first communication step PE 1 receives the hash '2' twice and sends it back to either PE 2 or 3, depending on who sent it later. The PE that receives the hash '2' then searches for the element with that hash and marks it as possible duplicate. Parallel Bloom filters can be implemented to take advantage of the multiple processing elements (PEs) present in parallel shared-nothing machines. One of the main obstacles for a parallel Bloom filter is the organization and communication of the unordered data which is, in general, distributed evenly over all PEs at the initiation or at batch insertions. To order the data two approaches can be used, either resulting in a Bloom filter over all data being stored on each PE, called replicating bloom filter, or the Bloom filter over all data being split into equal parts, each PE storing one part of it. For both approaches a \\"Single Shot\\" Bloom filter is used which only calculates one hash, resulting in one flipped bit per element, to reduce the communication volume. Distributed Bloom filters are initiated by first hashing all elements on their local PE and then sorting them by their hashes locally. This can be done in linear time using e.g. Bucket sort and also allows local duplicate detection. The sorting is used to group the hashes with their assigned PE as separator to create a Bloom filter for each group. After encoding these Bloom filters using e.g. Golomb coding each bloom filter is send as packet to the PE responsible for the hash values that where inserted into it. A PE p is responsible for all hashes between the values p*(s/\\\\text{PE}) and (p+1)*(s/\\\\text{PE}), where s is the total size of the Bloom filter over all data. Because each element is only hashed once and therefore only a single bit is set, to check if an element was inserted into the Bloom filter only the PE responsible for the hash value of the element needs to be operated on. Single insertion operations can also be done efficiently because the Bloom filter of only one PE has to be changed, compared to Replicating Bloom filters where every PE would have to update its Bloom filter. By distributing the global Bloom filter over all PEs instead of storing it separately on each PE the Bloom filters size can be far larger, resulting in a larger capacity and lower false positive rate. Distributed Bloom filters can be used to improve duplicate detection algorithms by filtering out the most 'unique' elements. These can be calculated by communicating only the hashes of elements, not the elements themselves which are far larger in volume, and removing them from the set, reducing the workload for the duplicate detection algorithm used afterwards. During the communication of the hashes the PEs search for bits that are set in more than one of the receiving packets, as this would mean that two elements had the same hash and therefore could be duplicates. If this occurs a message containing the index of the bit, which is also the hash of the element that could be a duplicate, is send to the PEs which sent a packet with the set bit. If multiple indices are send to the same PE by one sender it can be advantageous to encode the indices as well. All elements that didn't have their hash sent back are now guaranteed to not be a duplicate and won't be evaluated further, for the remaining elements a Repartitioning algorithm can be used. First all the elements that had their hash value sent back are send to the PE that their hash is responsible for. Any element and its duplicate is now guaranteed to be on the same PE. In the second step each PE uses a sequential algorithm for duplicate detection on the receiving elements, which are only a fraction of the amount of starting elements. By allowing a false positive rate for the duplicates, the communication volume can be reduced further as the PEs don't have to send elements with duplicated hashes at all and instead any element with a duplicated hash can simply be marked as a duplicate. As a result, the false positive rate for duplicate detection is the same as the false positive rate of the used bloom filter. The process of filtering out the most 'unique' elements can also be repeated multiple times by changing the hash function in each filtering step. If only a single filtering step is used it has to archive a small false positive rate, however if the filtering step is repeated once the first step can allow a higher false positive rate while the latter one has a higher one but also works on less elements as many have already been removed by the earlier filtering step. While using more than two repetitions can reduce the communication volume further if the number of duplicates in a set is small, the payoff for the additional complications is low. Replicating Bloom filters organize their data by using a well known hypcercube algorithm for gossiping, e.g. First each PE calculates the Bloom filter over all local elements and stores it. By repeating a loop where in each step i the PEs send their local Bloom filter over dimension i and merge the Bloom filter they receive over the dimension with their local Bloom filter, it is possible to double the elements each Bloom filter contains in every iteration. After sending and receiving Bloom filters over all \\\\log \\\\text{PE} dimensions each PE contains the global Bloom filter over all elements. Replicating Bloom filters are more efficient when the number of queries is much larger than the number of elements that the Bloom filter contains, the break even point compared to Distributed Bloom filters is approximately after \\\\text{PE} * \\\\text{Elements} / \\\\log_{f^\\\\text{+}} \\\\text{PE} accesses, with f^\\\\text{+} as the false positive rate of the bloom filter. =Data synchronization= Bloom filters can be used for approximate data synchronization as in . Counting Bloom filters can be used to approximate the number of differences between two sets and this approach is described in . =Bloomier filters= designed a generalization of Bloom filters that could associate a value with each element that had been inserted, implementing an associative array. Like Bloom filters, these structures achieve a small space overhead by accepting a small probability of false positives. In the case of \\"Bloomier filters\\", a false positive is defined as returning a result when the key is not in the map. The map will never return the wrong value for a key that is in the map. =Compact approximators= proposed a lattice-based generalization of Bloom filters. A compact approximator associates to each key an element of a lattice (the standard Bloom filters being the case of the Boolean two-element lattice). Instead of a bit array, they have an array of lattice elements. When adding a new association between a key and an element of the lattice, they compute the maximum of the current contents of the k array locations associated to the key with the lattice element. When reading the value associated to a key, they compute the minimum of the values found in the k locations associated to the key. The resulting value approximates from above the original value. =Parallel Partitioned Bloom Filters= This implementation used a separate array for each hash function. This method allows for parallel hash calculations for both insertions and inquiries. =Stable Bloom filters= proposed Stable Bloom filters as a variant of Bloom filters for streaming data. The idea is that since there is no way to store the entire history of a stream (which can be infinite), Stable Bloom filters continuously evict stale information to make room for more recent elements. Since stale information is evicted, the Stable Bloom filter introduces false negatives, which do not appear in traditional Bloom filters. The authors show that a tight upper bound of false positive rates is guaranteed, and the method is superior to standard Bloom filters in terms of false positive rates and time efficiency when a small space and an acceptable false positive rate are given. =Scalable Bloom filters= proposed a variant of Bloom filters that can adapt dynamically to the number of elements stored, while assuring a minimum false positive probability. The technique is based on sequences of standard Bloom filters with increasing capacity and tighter false positive probabilities, so as to ensure that a maximum false positive probability can be set beforehand, regardless of the number of elements to be inserted. =Spatial Bloom filters= Spatial Bloom filters (SBF) were originally proposed by as a data structure designed to store location information, especially in the context of cryptographic protocols for location privacy. However, the main characteristic of SBFs is their ability to store multiple sets in a single data structure, which makes them suitable for a number of different application scenarios. Membership of an element to a specific set can be queried, and the false positive probability depends on the set: the first sets to be entered into the filter during construction have higher false positive probabilities than sets entered at the end. This property allows a prioritization of the sets, where sets containing more \\"important\\" elements can be preserved. =Layered Bloom filters= A layered Bloom filter consists of multiple Bloom filter layers. Layered Bloom filters allow keeping track of how many times an item was added to the Bloom filter by checking how many layers contain the item. With a layered Bloom filter a check operation will normally return the deepest layer number the item was found in. =Attenuated Bloom filters= Attenuated Bloom Filter Example: Search for pattern 11010, starting from node n1. An attenuated Bloom filter of depth D can be viewed as an array of D normal Bloom filters. In the context of service discovery in a network, each node stores regular and attenuated Bloom filters locally. The regular or local Bloom filter indicates which services are offered by the node itself. The attenuated filter of level i indicates which services can be found on nodes that are i-hops away from the current node. The i-th value is constructed by taking a union of local Bloom filters for nodes i-hops away from the node. Let's take a small network shown on the graph below as an example. Say we are searching for a service A whose id hashes to bits 0,1, and 3 (pattern 11010). Let n1 node to be the starting point. First, we check whether service A is offered by n1 by checking its local filter. Since the patterns don't match, we check the attenuated Bloom filter in order to determine which node should be the next hop. We see that n2 doesn't offer service A but lies on the path to nodes that do. Hence, we move to n2 and repeat the same procedure. We quickly find that n3 offers the service, and hence the destination is located. By using attenuated Bloom filters consisting of multiple layers, services at more than one hop distance can be discovered while avoiding saturation of the Bloom filter by attenuating (shifting out) bits set by sources further away. =Chemical structure searching= Bloom filters are often used to search large chemical structure databases (see chemical similarity). In the simplest case, the elements added to the filter (called a fingerprint in this field) are just the atomic numbers present in the molecule, or a hash based on the atomic number of each atom and the number and type of its bonds. This case is too simple to be useful. More advanced filters also encode atom counts, larger substructure features like carboxyl groups, and graph properties like the number of rings. In hash-based fingerprints, a hash function based on atom and bond properties is used to turn a subgraph into a PRNG seed, and the first output values used to set bits in the Bloom filter. Molecular fingerprints started in the late 1940s as way to search for chemical structures searched on punched cards. However, it wasn't until around 1990 that Daylight Chemical Information Systems, Inc. introduced a hash-based method to generate the bits, rather than use a precomputed table. Unlike the dictionary approach, the hash method can assign bits for substructures which hadn't previously been seen. In the early 1990s, the term \\"fingerprint\\" was considered different from \\"structural keys\\", but the term has since grown to encompass most molecular characteristics which can be used for a similarity comparison, including structural keys, sparse count fingerprints, and 3D fingerprints. Unlike Bloom filters, the Daylight hash method allows the number of bits assigned per feature to be a function of the feature size, but most implementations of Daylight-like fingerprints use a fixed number of bits per feature, which makes them a Bloom filter. The original Daylight fingerprints could be used for both similarity and screening purposes. Many other fingerprint types, like the popular ECFP2, can be used for similarity but not for screening because they include local environmental characteristics that introduce false negatives when used as a screen. Even if these are constructed with the same mechanism, these are not Bloom filters because they cannot be used to filter.

The birth date of 1640 seems unlikely. A more probable date of 1670 is given in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Biography Doggett was born in Dublin, and made his first stage appearance in London in 1691 as Nincompoop in Thomas D'Urfey's Love for Money. In this part, and as Solon in the same author's Marriage-Hater Matched, he became popular. He followed Betterton to Lincoln's Inn Fields, creating the part of Ben, specially written for him, in William Congreve's Love for Love, with which the theatre opened (1695); and the following year played Young Hobb in his own play, The Country Wake. He was associated with Colley Cibber and others in the management of the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, and Drury Lane, and he continued to play comedy parts at the former until his retirement in 1713. Doggett is highly spoken of by his contemporaries, both as an actor and as a man, and is frequently referred to in the Tatler and The Spectator. Thomas Doggett is buried in the churchyard of St Johns Church in Eltham High Street, SE9 and there is a plaque on the outside of the church in his memory, which states that Doggett died a \\"pauper\\". Doggett's Coat and Badge Prize In 1715 Doggett founded the prize of Doggett's Coat and Badge in honour of the House of Hanover, in commemoration of King George I of Great Britain's accession to the Throne on 1 August 1714. The winner's prize is a traditional watermen's orange coat with a silver badge added to the sleeve, displaying the white horse of the House of Hanover and Brunswick, with the word \\"Liberty\\". The race had to be rowed annually on August first on the River Thames, by six young watermen who were not to have exceeded the time of their apprenticeship by twelve months. By 1864 the race report comments: The race continues under modified conditions to this day, and is believed to be the oldest continuously contested sporting event. The executors of Doggett's will (Sir George Markham and Thomas Reynolds) along with Edward Burt, Chief Clerk at the Admiralty Office, entrusted the management of his prize to the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers, although reputed to be a liveryman, of the Fishmongers' Company, this has yet to be proved. The Company has carried out the instructions in his will to the present day.

Living statue performers can fool passersby, and a number of hidden camera shows on television have used living statues to startle people. As with all performing arts, living statue performers may perform as buskers.  History  Olga Desmond nude with drapery and pedestal The tableau vivant, or group of living statues, was a regular feature of medieval and Renaissance festivities and pageantry, such as royal entries by rulers into cities. Typically a group enacting a scene would be mounted on an elaborate stand decorated to look like a monument, placed on the route of the procession. A living statue appeared in a scene of the 1945 French masterpiece film Les enfants du paradis (Children of Paradise), and early living statue pioneers include the London-based artists Gilbert and George in the 1960s. In the early years of the 20th century, the German dancer Olga Desmond put on ‚ÄúEvenings of Beauty‚Äù (Sch√∂nheitsabende) in which she posed nude in imitation of classical works of art ('living pictures').  Events  Since 1996 the annual \\"World Statues Festival\\" is held in Arnhem, Netherlands, initially under the name \\"Rijnfestijn\\". The University of Business and Social Sciences in Buenos Aires, Argentina has hosted a National Contest of Living Statues since the year 2000. Since 2011, the International Festival of Living Statues has been hosted by Masca Theatre in Bucharest, Romania, where there is a focus on developing the form through artistic research.http://www.masca.ro/teatru/en/living-statues-international-festival/ Busking Performing as a living statue is a prevalent form of busking, especially in places with a high level of tourism. A living statue performer will strategically choose a spot, preferably one with a high level of foot traffic, and out of the way. The performer creates the illusion of complete stillness while standing. Sometimes, passers-by do not realize the performer is a real person, which often causes surprise when the 'statue' gives them a small gesture (such as a wink or nod). A busker's objective is to create moments of interaction that result in a tip. The amount of money a performer makes day to day depends on his or her ability to effectively interact with the crowd.

Mudd, co-founder & president, Cyprus Mines Corporation The Cyprus Mines Corporation was an early twentieth century American mining company based in Cyprus. In 1914, Charles G. Gunther began prospecting in the Skouriotissa area after reading in ancient books that the island was rich in copper and noticing promising ancient Roman slag heaps in the area. The company was established in 1916 by Colonel Seeley W. Mudd, his son, Harvey Seeley Mudd, and mining engineer/business partner, Philip Wiseman, whose family, along with the Mudds, were the primary owners of Cyprus Mines until the early 1970s when it was sold to Amoco. According to the Climate Accountability Institute, Cyprus Amax was responsible for 0.1% of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions up to 2017. History Initially the mine struggled, but eventually obstacles were overcome and the mine produced money. Turkish and Greek Cypriots were hired, and the town of Skouriotissa became a hub as many miners moved there. The corporation took an old-style, paternalistic attitude towards workers, building a company town around the mine. Harvey Seeley Mudd claimed his experience with the Cyprus Mines Corporation influenced him to push the study of humanities in the engineering college he started, Harvey Mudd College. The Cyprus Mines Corporation provided copper to Nazi Germany right up until the start of the World War II. Although the company knew that some of its copper sales to Germany would be used to produce weapons for the Nazi military, at a time before the war when Germany traded for resources with many countries, the owner of the mine argued that stopping those exports would have adversely affected Cyprus. They were, however, disturbed by Hitler's policy of Jewish persecution, and in late 1938, CMC established a relief fund along with their agent to help former business associates get out of Germany. Long strikes took place in 1948, organized by the Pancyprian Federation of Labour and the Turkish Cypriot trade unions. After extending the initial five- day strike, the union asked for government intervention. The government declared that they could not start an inquiry since wages were not substandard. As of 1955, the company's copper mines on Cyprus had become the island's largest industry, exporting nearly a million tons of copper a year. Mudd's copper mines on Cyprus supported 2,000 of the island's inhabitants and provided more than 25 percent of the island's entire annual revenue. Cyprus Mines paid its employees 15‚Äì20 percent above the island average. The company ran an up-to-date, 65-bed hospital for its employees, built scores of low-cost houses for them to live in, and helped to run schools, sports clubs, welfare centers, and summer camps for their families.\\"CYPRUS: Copper Island\\". Time, March 12, 1956. One of the operating mines and the company's processing plant fell north of the cease-fire line in Northern Cyprus following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, whilst the rest of the company's mines were the other side of the Green Line. Given this insurmountable problem, the Cyprus Mines Corporation pulled out of Cyprus and the Mavrovouni mine and processing plant remained in an area not controlled by the government of the Republic of Cyprus. Skouriotissa Copper Mine in Cyprus =List of Cyprus Mines= Over 30 copper deposits, ranging in size from 50,000 to over 20,000,000 tonnes, with grades from 0.3 to 4.5 percent copper have been discovered with most of the mining activity been centered on the following districts: * Skouriotissa (the oldest operating mine in the world) * Tamassos * Kambia * Kalavassos * Limni A few isolated deposits have also been found at Troulli Mine (Larnaca), Mangaleni (Limassol), Peravasa (Limassol) and Vretchia (Paphos). =Tailings= As in most mines, the tailings, waste left over from processing ore, are a problem, although in Cyprus' case they were also a boon. The discovery and analysis of copper tailings left on Cyprus by Romans had been important factors in the founding of the company and the modern economic development of Cyprus. As of 2006, there are no plans to clean up the tailings. As the company did while it operated, now Cyprus also prefers to retain the past economic benefits of mining without spending funds on environmental remediation, particularly with neither the income from the mines nor the use of the now polluted land surrounding those mines, asserting that modern Cyprus has no way to pay for the cleanup. Local farmers claim that citrus crop yields have been lowered by contaminated dust blowing in. Studies of local fruit have found high heavy metal levels and decreased fruit size and quality. The effect of the mine is a growing issue for Cypriot environmentalists and NGOs.Mergers and Acquisitions In 1979 Cyprus Mines Corporation was acquired by Amoco Corporation. Amoco expanded Cyprus into a diversified worldwide mining company. Amoco spun off Cyprus Minerals Company in 1985. In 1986, Cyprus acquired the Sierrita copper and molybdenum mine near Tucson, Arizona. In July 1988, Cyprus Minerals bought the Inspiration mine and smelting complex in Miami, Arizona.G W LaChapelle and J S Dyas, \\"Cyprus Miami property overview and mine modernization,\\" Mining Engineering, 45(4), April 1993, 344‚Äì346.

It is bordered by the City of Brussels, Anderlecht, Forest and Ixelles. Saint-Gilles has a multicultural identity stemming from its diverse population. For example, the central square (French: Place Van Meenen, Dutch: Van Meenenplein) hosts the annual festival of Brussels' Portuguese community. The housing stock varies from semi-derelict tenements near the Brussels-South railway station in the north, to elegant patrician houses on the southern borders with Uccle and Ixelles, to tourist hotels at the inner end of the Chauss√©e de Charleroi/Charleroisesteenweg. Saint-Gilles is also known as one of the centers of artistic and student life in Brussels . History =Beginnings as Obbrussel= The first houses of the hamlet of Obbrussel (meaning Upper-Brussels) were built between the 7th and the 11th century close to Altitude 100, one of the points of highest elevation in Brussels, now part of Forest. In 1216, following strong demographic growth in the area, the Forest Abbey allowed Obbrussel to become an independent parish. This independence, however, was to last only eighty years, after which the administration of the village was given to Brussels. By the 16th century, Obbrussel had grown to 41 houses. Saint-Gilles town hall In 1670, following orders from the Spanish government, the Count of Monterey built a fort in Obbrussel as part of the fortifications of Brussels to protect the city of Brussels against possible attacks. Erected in 1675, this fort was dismantled in the following century to give way to several important toll roads and urban development. The name of the Barri√®re de Saint-Gilles/Bareel van Sint-Gillis neighbourhood still commemorates those tolls to this day. =French Regime until today= During the French regime, on 31 August 1795, the village, by now called Saint-Gilles after its patron saint and main church, merged with neighbouring villages to form Uccle. Four years later, it gained its independence again, with its own mayor and municipal council. In 1830, Brussels became the capital of newly founded Belgium. As a result, the rural village of Saint-Gilles, known for centuries for its cabbage cultivation, went through an unprecedented construction spree. The population increased from 2,500 around 1800 to more than 33,000 in 1880 to a peak of 60,000 in 1910. The streets pattern was completely remodeled in the 1860s by architect and urbanist Victor Besme. These were the years when the Louise Avenue, the Brussels-South railway station, and the new Saint Giles church were built, to be followed soon after by the new jail and city hall. Today, Saint-Gilles is one of the densest municipalities of the Brussels agglomeration. Sights 250px *Particular architectural delights are found in the dozen or more Art Nouveau houses designed by masters such as Horta, Struyvens, and Hankar, dotted around the upper part of the municipality. The house that Horta designed for himself, now the Horta Museum, is located there, on Rue Americaine/Amerikaansestraat. Several of those houses have been recognized as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO in 2000.http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and- heritage/lists/enhanced-protection/belgium/ *The imposing town hall, built between 1900 and 1904, looks larger than it is, and bears a splendid resemblance to a French ch√¢teau with Venetian overtones. *The extant Gothic revival jail and the demolished Palais de la Monnaie/Munthof (mint) both date from the 1880s, while Saint Giles's church was built in 1867. *There is not a lot of open space in the municipality, although the Forest Park, Brussels/Park van Vorst abuts its western side. Statistics Source:Saint-Gilles en Chiffres/Sint-Gillis in Cijfers, Municipality of Saint-Gilles, 2017 Population: *Nationality: Saint-Gilles has the largest foreign population of any Brussels municipality. Of the 49,933 registered residents in April 2017, 24,046 (48.2%) were non-Belgian. The largest foreign communities are those from France (c. 5,000), Portugal (c. 2,700), Italy and Spain (c. 2,000), Morocco (c. 1,800), Poland (c. 2,600), Romania (c. 2,200), Greece and Germany (c. 500) and Brazil (c. 400). *Age: The population is relatively young ‚Äì the average age is 35.95 years ‚Äì with nearly 10,000 residents under 18 years old, and fewer than average over 65. *Sex: Saint-Gilles is rare in being home to more men (25,052, 50.2%) than women (24,881, 49.8%). *Income: Average income per inhabitant lies between ‚Ç¨9,000 and ‚Ç¨11,500 per year, making it the second- poorest municipality in Brussels (after only Saint Josse/Sint-Joost) Schooling: The municipality has 13 nursery and primary schools (10 French- speaking and 3 Dutch-speaking) and 7 secondary schools (6 French-speaking and 1 Dutch-speaking). Economy and labour market: *Businesses: In December 2014 the municipality was home to 4,452 VAT-registered businesses. *Employment: 34,050 employees and 4,220 self-employed people worked in there. Employment is comparatively fast-growing: it rose by 26% between 2006 and 2013, whereas for the Brussels region as whole it stood still. It has a high female labour market participation rate ‚Äì 59% as against 68% for men. The employment rate in 2015 was 49%. Unemployment stood at 24.2% in 2015, having fallen from 28.2% in 2005. *Tourism: Hotel-nights have risen by nearly 20% between 2007 and 2015. In that year, 754,429 hotel-nights were recorded, of which 584,889 (7%) were foreigners. *Property prices: Between 2010 and 2014, the average sale price of a flat in Saint-Gilles was ‚Ç¨191,381.

It is also supported by archaeological excavations of the barrows of Eadgils and Ohthere in Sweden. For a discussion, see e.g. Birger Nerman's Det svenska rikets uppkomst (1925) (in Swedish). For presentations of the archaeological findings, see e.g. Elisabeth Klingmark's Gamla Uppsala, Svenska kulturminnen 59, Riksantikvarie√§mbetet (in Swedish), or this English language presentation by the Swedish National Heritage Board Beowulf and Old Norse sources present him as the son of Ohthere and as belonging to the ruling Yngling (Scylfing) dynasty. These sources also deal with his war against Onela, which he won with foreign assistance: in Beowulf he gained the throne of Sweden by defeating his uncle Onela with Geatish help, and in two Scandinavian sources (Sk√°ldskaparm√°l and Skj√∂ldunga saga), he is also helped to defeat Onela in the Battle on the Ice of Lake V√§nern, but with Danish help. However, Scandinavian sources mostly deal with his interaction with the legendary Danish king Hr√≥lfr Kraki (Hro√∞ulf), and Eadgils is mostly presented in a negative light as a rich and greedy king. Snorri Sturluson, who documented many of the Scandinavian traditions, reported that the Swedes called him a \\"great king\\".  Name  The Norse forms are based an older (Proto-Norse) *A√æagƒ´slaz (where *a√æa is short for *a√æala meaning \\"noble, foremost\\" (German 'adel') and *gƒ´slaz means \\"arrow shaft\\"). However, the Anglo-Saxon form is not etymologically identical. The A-S form would have been *√Üdgils, but Eadgils (Proto-Norse *Au√∞a-gƒ´slaz, *au√∞a- meaning \\"wealth\\") was the only corresponding name used by the Anglo-Saxons.Nerman (1925:104) The name A√∞ils was so exceedingly rare even in Scandinavia that among almost 6000 Scandinavian runic inscriptions, it is only attested in three runestones (U 35, DR 221 and Br Olsen;215).Samnordisk runtextdatabas  Beowulf  The Anglo-Saxon epic poem Beowulf, composed sometime between the 8th century and the 11th century, is (beside the Norwegian skaldic poem Ynglingatal from the 9th century) the oldest source that mentions Eadgils. The text of Beowulf implies that the Swedish king Ohthere died and that his younger brother Onela succeeded him, because Ohthere's two sons, Eadgils and Eanmund had to seek refuge with Heardred, Hygelac's son and successor as king of the Geats.Lines 2380‚Äì2391 This caused Onela to attack the Geats, and Heardred was killed. Onela returned home and Beowulf succeeded Heardred as the king of Geatland. In the following lines, Onela is referred to as the Scylfings' helmet and the son of Ongen√æeow, whereas Eadgils and Eanmund are referred to as the sons of Ohtere: {  :...Hyne wr√¶c-m√¶cgas :ofer s√¶ sohtan, suna Ohteres: :h√¶fdon hy forhealden helm Scylfinga, :√æone selestan s√¶-cyninga, :√æara √æe in Swio-rice sinc brytnade, :m√¶rne √æeoden.

In the following lines, Eanmund also appears as the son of Ohtere and as a brother's child: {  :...hond rond gefeng, :geolwe linde, gomel swyrd geteah, :√æ√¶t w√¶s mid eldum Eanmundes laf, :suna Ohteres, √æam √¶t s√¶cce wear√∞ :wracu wine-leasum Weohstanes bana :meces ecgum, and his magum √¶tb√¶r :brun-fagne helm, hringde byrnan, :eald sweord eotonisc, √æ√¶t him Onela forgeaf, :his g√¶delinges gu√∞-gew√¶du, :fyrd-searo fuslic: no ymbe √æa f√¶h√∞e spr√¶c, :√æeah √æe he his bro√∞or bearn abredwade.Lines 2609‚Äì2619.  :...The linden yellow, :his shield, he seized; the old sword he drew: -- :as heirloom of Eanmund earth-dwellers knew it, :who was slain by the sword-edge, son of Ohtere, :friendless exile, erst in fray :killed by Weohstan, who won for his kin :brown-bright helmet, breastplate ringed, :old sword of Eotens, Onela's gift, :weeds of war of the warrior-thane, :battle- gear brave: though a brother's child :had been felled, the feud was unfelt by Onela.  } Eadgils, however, survived and later, Beowulf helped Eadgils with weapons and warriors. Eadgils won the war and killed his uncle Onela. In the following lines, Eadgils is mentioned by name and as the son of Ohtere, whereas Onela is referred to as the king: {  :Se √æ√¶s leod-hryres lean gemunde :uferan dogrum, Eadgilse wear√∞ :fea-sceaftum feond.

Icelandic sources  The allusive manner in which Eadgils and his relatives are referred to in Beowulf suggests that the scop expected his audience to have sufficient background knowledge about Eadgils, Ohthere and Eanmund to understand the references. Likewise, in the roughly contemporary Icelandic Ynglingatal, Eadgils (A√∞ils) is called Onela's enemy (√Åla√Åla is the genitive case of √Åli, the Old Norse form of the name Onela (see Peterson, Lena: Lexikon √∂ver urnordiska personnamn, PDF ) d√≥lgr), which likewise suggests that the conflict was familiar to the skald and his audience. The tradition of Eadgils and Onela resurfaces in several Old Norse works in prose and poetry, and another matter also appears: the animosity between Eadgils and Hr√≥lfr Kraki, who corresponds to Hro√∞ulf in Beowulf. = Ynglingatal = The skaldic poem Ynglingatal is a poetic recital of the line of the Yngling clan. They are also called Skilfingar in the poem (in stanza 19), a name that appears in its Anglo-Saxon form Scylfingas in Beowulf when referring to Eadgils' clan. It is presented as composed by √ûj√≥√∞√≥lfr of Hvinir by Snorri Sturluson in the Ynglinga saga. Although its age has been debated, most scholars hold to date from the 9th century.H√§gerdal, Hans: Ynglingatal. Nya perspektiv p√• en kanske gammal text It survives in two versions: one is found in the Norwegian historical work Historia Norvegi√¶ in Latin, and the other one in Snorri Sturluson's Ynglinga saga, a part of his Heimskringla. It presents A√∞ils (Eadgils) as the successor of √ìttarr (Ohthere) and the predecessor of Eysteinn. The stanza on A√∞ils refers to his accidental death when he fell from his horse: {  :√ûat fr√° ek enn, :at A√∞ils fj√∂rvi :vitta vettr :um vi√∞a skyldi, :ok d√°√∞gjarn :af drasils b√≥gum :Freys √°ttungr :falla skyldi. :Ok vi√∞ aur :≈ìgir hjarna :bragnings burs :um blandinn var√∞; :ok d√°√∞s√¶ll :deyja skyldi :√Åla d√≥lgr :at Upps√∂lum.The Ynglinga saga in Old Norse  :Witch-demons, I have heard men say, :Have taken Adils' life away. :The son of kings of Frey's great race, :First in the fray, the fight, the chase, :Fell from his steedhis clotted brains :Lie mixed with mire on Upsal's plains. :Such death (grim Fate has willed it so) :Has struck down Ole's [Onela's] deadly foe.Laing's translation  } Note that Eadgils' animosity with Onela also appears in Ynglingatal as A√∞ils is referred to as Ole's deadly foe (√Åla d√≥lgr). This animosity is treated in more detail in the Skj√∂ldunga saga and Sk√°ldskaparm√°l, which follow. The Historia Norwegi√¶, which is a terse summary in Latin of Ynglingatal, only states that Eadgils fell from his horse and died during the sacrifices. In this Latin translation, the D√≠sir are rendered as the Roman goddess Diana: {  Cujus filius Adils vel Athisl ante √¶dem Dian√¶, dum idolorum, sacrificia fugeret, equo lapsus exspiravit. Hic genuit Eustein, [ ... ]Storm, Gustav (editor) (1880). Monumenta historica Norwegi√¶: Latinske kildeskrifter til Norges historie i middelalderen, Monumenta Historica Norwegiae (Kristiania: Br√∏gger), p. 101.  His son Adils gave up the ghost after falling from his horse before the temple of Diana, while he was performing the sacrifices made to idols. He became sire to √òystein, [ ... ]Ekrem, Inger (editor), Lars Boje Mortensen (editor) and Peter Fisher (translator) (2003). Historia Norwegie. Museum Tusculanum Press. , pp. 77-79.  } The same information is found the Swedish Chronicle from the mid-15th century, which calls him Adhel. It is probably based on the Ynglingatal tradition and says that he fell from his horse and died while he worshipped his god. = √çslendingab√≥k = In √çslendingab√≥k from the early 12th century, Eadgils only appears as a name in the listing of the kings of the Yngling dynasty as A√∞√≠sl at Uppsala. The reason what that the author, Ari √ûorgilsson, traced his ancestry from Eadgils, and its line of succession is the same as that of Ynglingatal. :i Yngvi Tyrkjakonungr. ii Nj√∂r√∞r Sv√≠akonungr. iii Freyr. iiii Fj√∂lnir. s√° er d√≥ at Fri√∞fr√≥√∞a. v Sveg√∞ir. vi Vanlandi. vii Visburr. viii D√≥maldr. ix D√≥marr. x Dyggvi. xi Dagr. xii Alrekr. xiii Agni. xiiii Yngvi. xv J√∂rundr. xvi Aun inn gamli. xvii Egill Vendilkr√°ka. xviii √ìttarr. xix A√∞√≠sl at Upps√∂lum. xx Eysteinn. xxi Yngvarr. xxii Braut-√ñnundr. xxiii Ingjaldr inn illr√°√∞i. xxiiii √ìl√°fr tr√©telgja...Gu√∞ni J√≥nsson's edition of √çslendingab√≥k As can be seen it agrees with the earlier Ynglingatal and Beowulf in presenting Eadgils as the successor of √ìttarr (Ohthere). = Skj√∂ldunga saga = The Skj√∂ldunga saga was a Norse saga which is believed to have been written in the period 1180‚Äì1200. The original version is lost, but it survives in a Latin summary by Arngr√≠mur J√≥nsson. Arngr√≠mur's summary relates that Eadgils, called Adillus, married Yrsa with whom he had the daughter Scullda. Some years later, the Danish king Helgo (Halga) attacked Sweden and captured Yrsa, not knowing that she was his own daughter, the result of Helgo raping Olava, the queen of the Saxons. Helgo raped Yrsa as well and took her back to Denmark, where she bore the son Rolfo (Hro√∞ulf). After a few years, Yrsa's mother, queen Olava, came to visit her and told her that Helgo was her own father. In horror, Yrsa returned to Adillus, leaving her son behind. Helgo died when Rolfo was eight years old, and Rolfo succeeded him, and ruled together with his uncle Roas (Hro√∞gar). Not much later, Roas was killed by his half-brothers R√¶recus and Frodo, whereupon Rolfo became the sole king of Denmark. In Sweden, Yrsa and Adillus married Scullda to the king of √ñland, Hi√∏rvardus/Hiorvardus/Hevardus (Heoroweard). As her half-brother Rolfo was not consulted about this marriage, he was infuriated and he attacked √ñland and made Hi√∏rvardus and his kingdom tributary to Denmark. After some time, there was animosity between king Adillus of Sweden and the Norwegian king Ale of Oppland. They decided to fight on the ice of Lake V√§nern. Adillus won and took his helmet, chainmail and horse. Adillus won because he had requested Rolfo's aid against king Ale and Rolfo had sent him his berserkers. However, Adillus refused to pay the expected tribute for the help and so Rolfo came to Uppsala to claim his recompense. After surviving some traps, Rolfo fled with Adillus' gold, helped by his mother Yrsa. Seeing that the Swedish king and his men pursued him, Rolfo \\"sowed\\" the gold on the Fyrisvellir, so that the king's men would pick up the gold, instead of continuing the pursuit. As can be seen, the Skj√∂ldunga saga retells the story of Eadgils fighting his uncle Onela, but in this version Onela is no longer Eadgils' uncle, but a Norwegian king of Oppland. This change is generally considered to be a late confusion between the core province of the Swedes, Uppland, and its Norwegian namesake Oppland.Nerman 1925:103-104 Whereas, Beowulf leaves the Danish court with the suspicion that Hro√∞ulf (Rolfo Krage, Hr√≥lfr Kraki) might claim the Danish throne for himself at the death of Hro√∞gar (Roas, Hr√≥arr), it is exactly what he does in Scandinavian tradition. A notable difference is that, in Beowulf, Eadgils receives the help of the Geatish king Beowulf against Onela, whereas it is the Danish king Hro√∞ulf who provides help in Scandinavian tradition. = Sk√°ldskaparm√°l = Sk√°ldskaparm√°l was written by Snorri Sturluson, c. 1220, in order to teach the ancient art of kennings to aspiring skalds. It presents Eadgils, called A√∞ils, in two sections. The first section is the K√°lfsv√≠sa of which Snorri quotes small parts:Nerman 1925:102 {  :Ali Hrafni, :es til √≠ss ri√∞u, :en annarr austr :und A√∞ilsi :gr√°r hvarfa√∞i, :geiri unda√∞r.heimskringla.no ‚Äì Eddukv√¶√∞i : Eddubrot  :√Åli rode Hrafn, :They who rode onto the ice: :But another, southward, :Under Adils, :A gray one, wandered, :Wounded with the spear.  } This is a reference to the Battle on the Ice of Lake V√§nern, during which Eadgils slew Onela and which also appears in the Skj√∂ldunga saga. There is also second stanza, where Eadgils is riding his horse Sl√∂ngvir, apparently a combination famous enough to be mentioned. {  :Bj√∂rn rei√∞ Blakki, :en B√≠arr Kerti, :Atli Glaumi, :en A√∞ils Sl√∏ngvi, :H√∂gni H√∂lkvi, :en Haraldr F√∂lkvi, :Gunnarr Gota, :en Grana Sigur√∞r.  :Bj√∂rn rode Blakkr, :And Bj√°rr rode Kertr; :Atli rode Glaumr, :And Adils on Sl√∂ngvir; :H√∂gni on H√∂lvir, :And Haraldr on F√∂lkvir; :Gunnarr rode Goti, :And Sigurdr, Grani.  } Eadgils' horse Sl√∂ngvir also appears in Snorri's later work, the Ynglinga saga. Snorri also presents the story of A√∞ils and Hr√≥lfr Kraki (Hro√∞ulf) in order to explain why gold was known by the kenning Kraki's seed. Snorri relates that A√∞ils was in war with a Norwegian king named √Åli (Onela), and they fought in the Battle on the Ice of Lake V√§nern. A√∞ils was married to Yrsa, the mother of Hr√≥lfr and so sent an embassy to Hr√≥lfr asking him for help against √Åli. He would receive three valuable gifts in recompense. Hr√≥lfr was involved in a war against the Saxons and could not come in person but sent his twelve berserkers, including B√∂√∞varr Bjarki. √Åli died in the war, and A√∞ils took √Åli's helmet Battle-boar and his horse Raven. The berserkers demanded three pounds of gold each in pay, and they demanded to choose the gifts that A√∞ils had promised Hr√≥lfr, that is the two pieces of armour that nothing could pierce: the helmet battle-boar and the mailcoat Finn's heritage. They also wanted the famous ring Sv√≠agris. A√∞ils considered the pay outrageous and refused. When Hr√≥lfr heard that A√∞ils refused to pay, he set off to Uppsala. They brought the ships to the river Fyris and rode directly to the Swedish king's hall at Uppsala with his twelve berserkers. Yrsa welcomed them and led them to their lodgings. Fires were prepared for them and they were given drinks. However, so much wood was heaped on the fires that the clothes started to burn away from their clothes. Hr√≥lfr and his men had enough and threw the courtiers on the fire. Yrsa arrived and gave them a horn full of gold, the ring Sv√≠agris and asked them to flee. As they rode over the Fyrisvellir, they saw A√∞ils and his men pursuing them. The fleeing men threw the gold on the plain so that the pursuers would stop to collect it. A√∞ils, however, continued the chase on his horse Sl√∂ngvir. Hr√≥lfr then threw Sv√≠agris and saw how A√∞ils stooped down to pick up the ring with his spear. Hr√≥lfr exclaimed that he had seen the mightiest man in Sweden bend his back. = Ynglinga saga = The Ynglinga saga was written c. 1225 by Snorri Sturluson and he used Skj√∂ldunga saga as a source when he told the story of A√∞ils.Nerman (1925:103) Snorri relates that A√∞ils succeeded his father √ìttar (Ohthere) and betook himself to pillage the Saxons, whose king was Geir√æj√≥fr and queen Alof the Great. The king and consort were not at home, and so A√∞ils and his men plundered their residence at ease driving cattle and captives down to the ships. One of the captives was a remarkably beautiful girl named Yrsa, and Snorri writes that everyone was soon impressed with the well-mannered, pretty and intelligent girl. Most impressed was A√∞ils who made her his queen. Some years later, Helgi (Halga), who ruled in Lejre, attacked Sweden and captured Yrsa. As he did not know that Yrsa was his own daughter, he raped her, and took her back to Lejre, where she bore him the son Hr√≥lfr kraki. When the boy was three years of age, Yrsa's mother, queen Alof of Saxony, came to visit her and told her that her husband Helgi was her own father. Horrified, Yrsa returned to A√∞ils, leaving her son behind, and stayed in Sweden for the rest of her life. When Hr√≥lfr was eight years old, Helgi died during a war expedition and Hr√≥lfr was proclaimed king. A√∞ils waged a war against king √Åli (Onela of Oppland), and they fought in the Battle on the Ice of Lake V√§nern. √Åli died in this battle. Snorri writes that there was a long account of this battle in the Skj√∂ldunga Saga, which also contained an account of how Hr√≥lf came to Uppsala and sowed gold on the Fyrisvellir. The three large royal mounds at Gamla Uppsala. Snorri also relates that A√∞ils loved good horses and had the best horses in his days (the contemporary Gothic scholar Jordanes noted that the Swedes were famed for their good horses). One horse was named Sl√∂ngvi and another one Raven, which he had taken from √Åli. From this horse he had bred a horse also named Raven which he sent to king Godgest of H√•logaland, but Godgest could not manage it and fell from it and died, in Omd on the island of And√∏ya. A√∞ils himself died in a similar way at the D√≠sabl√≥t. A√∞ils was riding around the Disa shrine when Raven stumbled and fell, and the king was thrown forward and hit his skull on a stone. The Swedes called him a great king and buried him at Uppsala. He was succeeded by Eysteinn. = Hr√≥lfr Kraki's saga = Hr√≥lfr Kraki's saga is believed to have been written in the period c. 1230 ‚Äì c. 1450.Literary Encyclopedia entry Helgi and Yrsa lived happily together as husband and wife, not knowing that Yrsa was Helgi's daughter. Yrsa's mother queen Oluf travelled to Denmark to tell her daughter the truth. Yrsa was shocked and although Helgi wanted their relationship to remain as it was, Yrsa insisted on leaving him to live alone. She was later taken by the Swedish king A√∞ils as his queen, which made Helgi even more unhappy. Helgi went to Uppsala to fetch her, but was killed by A√∞ils in battle. In Lejre, he was succeeded by his son Hr√≥lfr Kraki. After some time, B√∂√∞varr Bjarki encouraged Hr√≥lfr to go Uppsala to claim the gold that A√∞ils had taken from Helgi after the battle. Hr√≥lfr departed with 120 men and his twelve berserkers and during a rest they were tested by a farmer called Hrani (Odin in disguise) who advised Hr√≥lfr to send back all his troops but his twelve berserkers, as numbers would not help him against A√∞ils. They were at first well received, but in his hall, A√∞ils did his best to stop Hr√≥lfr with pit traps and hidden warriors who attacked the Danes. Finally A√∞ils entertained them but put them to a test where they had to endure immense heat by a fire. Hr√≥lfr and his berserkers finally had enough and threw the courtiers, who were feeding the fire, into the fire and leapt at A√∞ils. The Swedish king disappeared through a hollow tree trunk that stood in his hall. Yrsa admonished A√∞ils for wanting to kill her son, and went to meet the Danes. She gave them a man named V√∂ggr to entertain them. This V√∂ggr remarked that Hr√≥lfr had the thin face of a pole ladder, a Kraki. Happy with his new cognomen Hr√≥lfr gave V√∂ggr a golden ring, and V√∂ggr swore to avenge Hr√≥lfr if anyone should kill him. Hr√≥lfr and his company were then attacked by a troll in the shape of a boar in the service of A√∞ils, but Hr√≥lfr's dog Gram killed it. They then found out that A√∞ils had set the hall on fire, and so they broke out of the hall, only to find themselves surrounded by heavily armed warriors in the street. After a fight, king A√∞ils retreated to summon reinforcements. Yrsa then provided her son with a silver drinking horn filled with gold and jewels and a famous ring, Sv√≠agris. Then she gave Hr√≥lf and his men twelve of the Swedish king's best horses, and all the armour and provisions they needed. Hr√≥lfr took a fond farewell of his mother and departed over the Fyrisvellir. When they saw A√∞ils and his warriors in pursuit, they spread the gold behind themselves. A√∞ils saw his precious Sv√≠agris on the ground and stooped to pick it up with his spear, whereupon Hr√≥lf cut his back with his sword and screamed in triumph that he had bent the back of the most powerful man in Sweden.  Danish sources  = Chronicon Lethrense and Annales Lundenses = The Chronicon Lethrense (and the included Annales Lundenses) tell that when the Danish kings Helghe (Halga) and Ro (Hro√∞gar) were dead, the Swedish king Hakon/AthislHakon according to Chronicon Lethrense proper, Athisl according to the included Annals of Lund forced the Daner to accept a dog as king. The dog king was succeeded by Rolf Krage (Hr√≥lfr Kraki). = Gesta Danorum = The Gesta Danorum (book 2), by Saxo Grammaticus, tells that Helgo (Halga) repelled a Swedish invasion, killed the Swedish king Hothbrodd, and made the Swedes pay tribute. However, he committed suicide due to shame for his incestuous relationship with Urse (Yrsa), and his son Roluo (Hr√≥lfr Kraki) succeeded him. The new king of Sweden, Athislus, thought that the tribute to the Daner might be smaller if he married the Danish king's mother and so took Urse for a queen. However, after some time, Urse was so upset with the Swedish king's greediness that she thought out a ruse to run away from the king and at the same time liberate him of his wealth. She incited Athislus to rebel against Roluo, and arranged so that Roluo would be invited and promised a wealth in gifts. At the banquet Roluo was at first not recognised by his mother, but when their fondness was commented on by Athisl, the Swedish king and Roluo made a wager where Roluo would prove his endurance. Roluo was placed in front of a fire that exposed him to such heat that finally a maiden could suffer the sight no more and extinguished the fire. Roluo was greatly recompensed by Athisl for his endurance. When the banquet had lasted for three days, Urse and Roluo escaped from Uppsala, early in the morning in carriages where they had put all the Swedish king's treasure. In order to lessen their burden, and to occupy any pursuing warriors they spread gold in their path (later in the work, this is referred to as \\"sowing the Fyrisvellir\\"), although there was a rumour that she only spread gilded copper. When Athislus, who was pursuing the escapers saw that a precious ring was lying on the ground, he bent down to pick it up. Roluo was pleased to see the king of Sweden bent down, and escaped in the ships with his mother. Roluo later defeated Athislus and gave Sweden to young man named Hiartuar (Heoroweard), who also married Roluo's sister Skulde. When Athislus learnt that Hiartuar and Skulde had killed Roluo, he celebrated the occasion, but he drank so much that he killed himself.  Archaeology  The mound to the left has been suggested to be the grave where Snorri Sturluson reported that Eadgils was buried. Archaeological finds are consistent with this identification. According to Snorri Sturluson, Eadgils was buried in one of the royal mounds of Gamla Uppsala. Birger Nerman suggested that he was buried in the Western mound (also known as Thor's mound) at Gamla Uppsala. An excavation in this mound showed that a man was buried there c. 575 on a bear skin with two dogs and rich grave offerings. There were luxurious weapons and other objects, both domestic and imported, show that the buried man was very powerful. These remains include a Frankish sword adorned with gold and garnets and a board game with Roman pawns of ivory. He was dressed in a costly suit made of Frankish cloth with golden threads, and he wore a belt with a costly buckle. There were four cameos from the Middle East which were probably part of a casket. The finds show the distant contacts of the House of Yngling in the 6th century. Snorri's account that Adils had the best horses of his days, and Jordanes' account that the Swedes of the 6th century were famed for their horses find support in archaeology. This time was the beginning of the Vendel Age, a time characterised by the appearance of stirrups and a powerful mounted warrior elite in Sweden, which rich graves in for instance Valsg√§rde and Vendel.

It is a widespread and frequently common resident breeder in much of west and central tropical Africa. It is a species associated with open forest, savannah and bush. This bird has a wide range and is a common species, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Description This bird is 22 cm in length. It is a typical woodpecker shape, and has green upper parts marked with fine pale spots, except on the rump and tail, which have pale bars instead. The underparts are whitish or yellowish with fine dark spots on breast, belly and flanks. The head is whitish with greyer cheeks and chin, again with tiny dark spots. The adult male fine-spotted woodpecker has a red crown and moustachial stripes. Females have a dark forecrown, with red on the rear half. They lack the red moustaches. Young birds are like the female, but the green of the plumage is darker.Like other woodpeckers, this species has a straight pointed bill, a stiff tail to provide support against tree trunks, and zygodactyl or ‚Äúyoked\\" feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backward. The long tongue can be darted forward to capture insects. The call of this vocal species is a loud kip-kip-kip-kiech-kiech-kiech. Distribution and habitat The fine-spotted woodpecker is native to tropical West and Central Africa. Its range includes Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gambia; Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan and Togo. Its habitat is typically wooded savannah, scrub and grassland with scattered Acacia and other trees. Ecology Like other woodpeckers, this species is insectivorous. It is a specialist termite feeder, and is frequently seen near termite mounds and picking insects off trees and the ground. It often forages in small family groups and may join mixed flocks of birds. The nest is built in a tree hole, often in an oil palm, and the clutch consists of two or three white eggs.

Hy-Vee was founded in 1930 by Charles Hyde and David Vredenburg in Beaconsfield, Iowa, in a small brick building known as the Beaconsfield Supply Store, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The largest Hy-Vee stores are full-service supermarkets with bakeries, delicatessens, floral departments, dine-in and carryout food service, wine and spirits, pharmacies, health clinics, HealthMarkets (natural and organic products) and coffee kiosks (Caribou Coffee and Starbucks). The company maintains fuel stations with convenience stores, fitness centers, and full-service restaurants at some of its properties. Hy-Vee's largest store opened March 10, 2015, in Bloomington, Illinois, with of retail space. Hy- Vee's longtime advertising slogan, \\"Where there's a helpful smile in every aisle,\\" was adopted for the chain's first television commercial in 1963. The slogan became a jingle in the 1990s with music by Annie Meacham and James Poulsen. History =Early years and General Supply Company= The Beaconsfield Supply Store Starting in 1917, Vredenburg & Lewis, David Vredenburg's previous partnership, operated stores as part of the General Supply Company, an RLDS Church-owned company based in Lamoni, Iowa. In 1921, Charles Hyde started working for the General Supply Company's store in Woodbine, Iowa, which was operated by Vredenburg & Lewis. In 1922, the General Supply Company was formally incorporated. Vredenburg was president and Hyde a member of the board of directors. In 1924, Hyde left the General Supply Company and started his own store in Cameron, Missouri. In 1927, Hyde purchased a half stake of a store in Kellerton, Iowa, the other half being owned by the General Supply Company. In 1930, Vredenburg and Hyde started a separate partnership from the General Supply Company, named Supply Stores, and opened their first store in Beaconsfield, Iowa. In 1932, The General Supply Company was dissolved because of effects of the Great Depression. Vredenburg purchased most of the former General Supply Company's remaining stores and mill. Both Hyde and Vredenburg owned and operated other stores outside of their partnership. Hyde and Vredenburg's partnership was dissolved for approximately six months in 1935 after Iowa enacted the Chain Tax Act of 1935, a heavy tax against chain stores that was later declared unconstitutional. In 1938, Hyde & Vredenburg, Inc. was officially incorporated, with 15 stores in Iowa and Missouri. The incorporation consolidated all of Hyde's and Vredenburg's independently owned stores with the stores they had in their partnership. The company was headquartered in Lamoni. The new company's management plan involved autonomy for store managers, setting the stage for its eventual employee ownership. In 1945, Hyde & Vredenburg moved its corporate headquarters from Lamoni to Chariton, Iowa, after acquiring the Chariton Wholesale Company. The Supply Store name, with each town's name preceding it, was still used on most stores until 1952. A few stores were named differently, with names such as Hyde's Service Store, Vredenburg's Grocery, and Hyde & Vredenburg, all of which were changed in 1952. =1950s and 1960s= The Hy-Vee name, a contraction of Hyde and Vredenburg, was adopted in 1952 as the winning entry of an employee contest, with three employees submitting the name. The first store with the name opened in Fairfield, Iowa, in 1953. In 1956, Hy-Vee introduced its first private label products, along with a new logo. In 1957, Hy-Vee opened its first in-store bakery at the Iowa City, Iowa, store. In 1960, the company became employee- owned by the Employees‚Äô Trust Fund. The slogan \\"Where There's a Helpful Smile in every Aisle\\" was first used in a TV commercial in 1963. The company's name was officially changed to Hy-Vee Food Stores, Inc., in 1963. In 1969, Hy-Vee expanded into Minnesota, after acquiring the Swanson Stores chain based in Cherokee, Iowa. In 1969, Hy-Vee opened its first Drug Town, a pharmacy separate from a regular store, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Hy-Vee had 66 stores at the end of 1969. =1970s, '80s, and '90s= A Hy-Vee Store in Dubuque, Iowa. Hy-Vee continued expanding during the 1970s and 1980s, opening stores in South Dakota (1975), Nebraska (1977), Illinois (1979), and Kansas (1988). In 1975, Hy-Vee's 100th store, which was also its first to use electronic cash registers, opened in Keokuk, Iowa. By the end of 1989 Hy-Vee had 172 stores in seven states. In 1994, Hy-Vee updated its logo to the one used today. In 1995 Hy-Vee moved its corporate headquarters from Chariton to West Des Moines, Iowa, while shortening its name to Hy-Vee, Inc. The company's primary distribution center is still in Chariton; a second one is in Cherokee, Iowa. Famous NFL Quarterback Kurt Warner worked at a store in Cedar Falls, Iowa from 1994 to 1995, before going to play in Arena Football for the Iowa Barnstormers. =2000s= At the turn of the century, Hy-Vee increased its focus on customers' healthy lifestyles. HealthMarket private-label products were introduced in 2001. The company also began its initiative to provide customers with the services of corporate and in-store dietitians. Stores began offering an expanded line of ethnic foods to the Midwest's increasingly diverse population. Online shopping capabilities expanded in 2005, with a redesigned Hy-Vee website offering online shopping for such items as holiday meals, floral arrangements and catering selections; gift cards were added in 2006. Hy-Vee was selected as Progressive Grocer's Retailer of the Year in 2003. Drug Town stores were renamed Hy-Vee Drugstores in 2005. Hy-Vee celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2005 with the publication of a second company history book (The History of Hy-Vee). In 2007, Hy-Vee's first store, in Beaconsfield, Iowa, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. In fiscal year 2009, Hy-Vee had sales exceeding $6.3 billion; at the time, it was the second-largest employee-owned company in the United States and ranked by Forbes magazine the 48th-largest privately owned company in the country. More than 55,000 employees worked in the Hy-Vee family in 2009. By the end of 2009, there were 228 stores. In 2009, Hy-Vee moved into its eighth state of operations when the store in Madison, Wisconsin opened. Hy-Vee's fourth president, Randy Edeker, was selected to lead the company in December 2009. Ric Jurgens retained the titles of chairman and chief executive officer until 2012, when Edeker assumed those roles. In 2003, Milan, Illinois based grocer Eagle Food Center went out of business, and a few of their stores, such as the John Deere Road store in Moline, Illinois became Hy-Vee stores in the late 2000's. =2010s= In 2012, Hy-Vee introduced its loyalty program, Hy-Vee Fuel Saver, which allows customers to earn discounts on fuel at Casey's General Stores; Shell; PDQ/Kwik Trip, as well as Hy-Vee's own gas stations, by purchasing select items. In 2015 the program's name was changed to Hy-Vee Fuel Saver + Perks. In 2012, Hy-Vee started to add full-service restaurants to some stores, named Hy-Vee Market Grille. In 2015, Hy-Vee brought online shopping to all stores with the introduction of their new website, Hy-Vee Aisles Online. In September 2015, Hy-Vee opened its first stores in the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul metropolitan area. In 2016, Hy-Vee began opening clothing boutiques featuring Tesco's F&F; brand in select larger locations. In 2017, Hy-Vee became the exclusive retailer in its service area for sports nutrition products marketed by Mark Wahlberg. This expanded into a deal making Hy-Vee a franchisee for Wahlburgers restaurants; the first location under the deal opened in May 2018 at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. Hy-Vee plans to operate 26 Wahlburgers locations, making it the largest franchisee of Wahlburgers. Hy-Vee's own restaurant, Market Grille, added Wahlburgers items to its menu.https://www.hy-vee.com/corporate/news-events/news-press- releases/hyvee--wahlburgers/ Hy-Vee has yet to comment on Mark Wahlberg's racially fueled assault of a middle-aged Vietnamese man, subsequent conviction, and 2016 pardon attempt.

The areas requested include Tulsa, Oklahoma, Fayetteville, Arkansas, and Jonesboro, Arkansas. The posts have gotten mixed replies from Hy-Vee with them saying it is too far outside their area, currently too far outside the area (this would indicate a second distribution center would be needed), or that they have no plans as of yet, but will keep the areas in mind.https://www.facebook.com/HyVee/posts/can-you- please-bring-a-hy-vee-to-fayetteville- ar/10150610422922797/https://www.facebook.com/HyVee/posts/we-need-one-in- jonesboro-ar/10153995916447797/https://www.facebook.com/HyVee/posts/when-i- lived-in-kansas-city-i-really-enjoyed-your-hyvee-stores-in-shawnee- missio/10153566958047797/ The closest Hy-Vee store to these areas would be the ones in Springfield, Missouri.

Yrsa, Yrse, Yrs or Urse (6th centuryThe dating has never been a matter of controversy. It is inferred from the internal chronology of the sources themselves and the dating of Hygelac's raid on Frisia to c. 516. It is also supported by archaeological excavations of the barrows of Eadgils and Ohthere in Sweden. For a discussion, see e.g. Birger Nerman's Det svenska rikets uppkomst (1925) (in Swedish). For presentations of the archaeological findings, see e.g. Elisabeth Klingmark's Gamla Uppsala, Svenska kulturminnen 59, Riksantikvarie√§mbetet (in Swedish), or this English language presentation by the Swedish National Heritage Board ) was a tragic heroine of early Scandinavian literature. She appears in several versions relating to her husband, the Swedish king Eadgils, and/or to her father and rapist/lover/husband Halga (the younger brother of king Hro√∞gar who received aid from Beowulf) and their son Hro√∞ulf. The common claim in Beowulf studies that Hro√∞ulf probably was the son of Halga is taken from the Yrsa tradition. Several translators (e.g. Burton Raffel) and scholars have emended her name from a corrupt line (62) in the manuscript of Beowulf, although this is guesswork. In the Ynglinga saga, Snorri Sturluson describes her personality as follows (Samuel Laing's translation): > Yrsa was not one of the slave girls, and it was soon observed that she was > intelligent, spoke well, and in all respects was well behaved. All people > thought well of her, and particularly the king; and at last it came to so > far that the king celebrated his wedding with her, and Yrsa became queen of > Svithiod, and was considered an excellent woman. In the Icelandic sagas =Hr√≥lfr Kraki's saga= In Hr√≥lfr Kraki's saga, Helgi (i.e. Halga) went to the Saxons wanting to woo their warlike queen Oluf. She was, however, not interested and humiliated Helgi by shaving his head and covering him with tar, while he was asleep, and sending him back to his ship. Some time later, Helgi returned and through a ruse, he kidnapped the queen for a while during which time he made her pregnant. Having returned to her kingdom, the queen bore a child, a girl which she named Yrsa after her dog. Yrsa was sent to live as a shepherd, until she was 12 years old, when she met her father Helgi who fell in love with her, not knowing it was his daughter. Oluf kept quiet about the parentage and saw it as her revenge that Helgi would wed his own daughter. Helgi and Yrsa had the son Hr√≥lfr Kraki (Hro√∞ulf). Learning that Helgi and Yrsa lived happily together, queen Oluf travelled to Denmark to tell her daughter the truth. Yrsa was shocked and although Helgi wanted their relationship to remain as it was, Yrsa insisted on leaving him to live alone. She was later taken by the Swedish king A√∞ils (Eadgils) as his queen, which made Helgi even unhappier. Missing Yrsa, Helgi went to Uppsala to fetch her, but was killed by A√∞ils in battle. Yrsa was naturally upset that the man who was closest to her was killed by her husband, and promised A√∞ils that his berserkers would all be slain if she could help it. She was no happier in the king's company and she was not interested in making up with him either. Later, when a young Swedish warrior named Svipdag arrived to test his skills, she greatly supported him in his fights with the berserkers who eventually were all slain. Svipdag chose not to remain with king A√∞ils and instead he sought service with Yrsa's son Hr√≥lfr who had succeeded Helgi as the king of Denmark. Hrolf Kraki fleeing the Swedish king Adils on the F√Ωrisvellir After some time, when A√∞ils owed Hr√≥lfr not only the gold he had taken from Helgi during the battle, but also tribute for his help fighting king √Åli (i.e. Onela of Beowulf) in the Battle on the Ice of Lake V√§nern, Hr√≥lfr arrived at Uppsala to gather his tribute. A√∞ils did his best to stop Hr√≥lfr through different ruses, but had to go away to gather reinforcements. While the Swedish king was gone, Yrsa provided her son with more gold than was due to him. Then she gave Hr√≥lfr and his men twelve of the Swedish king's best horses (A√∞ils was famous for his well-bred horses), and all the armour and provisions they needed. Hr√≥lfr took a fond farewell of his mother and departed over the Fyrisvellir. When they saw A√∞ils and his warriors in pursuit, they spread the gold behind themselves. A√∞ils saw his precious Sv√≠agris on the ground and stooped to pick it up with his spear, whereupon Hr√≥lfr cut his back with his sword and screamed in triumph that he had bent the back of the most powerful man in Sweden. Later, Hr√≥lfr was killed by his brother-in-law Hj√∂rvar√∞r (i.e. the Heoroweard of Beowulf) through treason and when the battle was over Hr√≥lfr's sister the half-elven Skuld ruled Denmark. Yrsa exacted revenge by sending a large Swedish army led by Vogg who captured Skuld before she could summon her army. Skuld was tortured to death and Hr√≥lfr's daughters took over the rule of Denmark. This account resembles that of the Gesta Danorum, but is more elaborate. A notable difference is that Yrsa is no longer Danish but Saxon, and that Yrsa stayed in Sweden, when her son Hro√∞ulf fled Eadgils with the gold. =Skj√∂ldunga saga= The Skj√∂ldunga sagaThe Relation of the Hrolfs Saga Kraka and the Bjarkarimur to Beowulf by Olson, 1916, at Project GutenbergNerman (1925:150) relates that Helgo (Halga) was the king of Denmark together with his brother Roas (Hro√∞gar). Helgo raped Olava, the queen of the Saxons, and she bore a daughter named Yrsa. The girl later married king Adillus (Eadgils), the king of Sweden. Yrsa and Adillus had the daughter Scullda. Some years later, Helgo attacked Sweden and captured Yrsa. He raped Yrsa, his own daughter, and took her back to Denmark, where she bore the son Rolfo (Hro√∞ulf). After a few years, Yrsa's mother, queen Olava, came to visit her and told her that Helgo was her own father. In horror, Yrsa returned to Adillus, leaving her son behind. Helgo died when Rolfo was eight years old, and Rolfo succeeded him, and ruled together with his uncle Roas. Not much later, Roas was killed by his half-brothers R√¶recus and Frodo (Froda), whereupon Rolfo became the sole king of Denmark. In Sweden, Yrsa and Adillus married their Scullda to the king of √ñland, Hi√∏rvardus (also called Hiorvardus and Hevardus, and who corresponds to Heoroweard in Beowulf). As her half- brother Rolfo was not consulted about this marriage, he was infuriated and he attacked √ñland and made Hi√∏rvardus and his kingdom tributary to Denmark. Adillus requested Rolfo's aid against the Norwegian king Ale (Onela). Rolfo sent his berserkers, but when the war had been won, Adillus refused to pay. Rolfo came to Uppsala and after some adventures he could flee with Adillus' gold, helped by his mother Yrsa, and he \\"sowed\\" it on the Fyrisvellir. This account differs from Hr√≥lf Kraki's saga in the respect that Yrsa was first peacefully married to Eadgils, and later captured by Halga, who raped her and made her pregnant with Hro√∞ulf. In Hr√≥lfr Kraki's saga, she was first captured by Halga who had Hro√∞ulf with him. Learning that Halga was her father, she returned to Saxland from where Eadgils kidnapped her. In Hr√≥lfr Kraki's saga, Helgi dies when more or less trying to save her from Eagdils, while the Skj√∂ldunga saga presents her marriage with Eadgils as a happier one, and Halga died in a different war expedition. =Ynglinga saga= The Skj√∂ldunga saga was used by Snorri Sturluson as a source when he told the story of A√∞ils (Eadgils) and Yrsa. What remains of the Skj√∂ldunga saga is a Latin summary by Arngr√≠mur J√≥nsson, and so the two versions are basically the same, the main difference being that Arngr√≠mur's version is more terse. Snorri relates that A√∞ils betook himself to pillage the Saxons, whose king was Geir√æj√≥fr and queen Alof the Great. The king and consort were not at home, and so A√∞ils and his men plundered their residence at ease driving cattle and captives down to the ships. One of the captives was a remarkably beautiful girl named Yrsa, and Snorri writes that everyone was soon impressed with the well-mannered, pretty and intelligent girl. Most impressed was A√∞ils who made her his queen. Some years later, Helgi (Halga), who ruled in Lejre, attacked Sweden and captured Yrsa. He raped Yrsa, his own daughter, and took her back to Lejre, where she bore him the son Hr√≥lfr (Hro√∞ulf). When the boy was three years of age, Yrsa's mother, queen Alof of Saxony, came to visit her and told her that her husband Helgi was her own father. Horrified, Yrsa returned to A√∞ils, leaving her son behind, and stayed in Sweden for the rest of her life. When Hr√≥lfr was eight years old, Helgi died during a war expedition and Hr√≥lfr was proclaimed king. Snorri finishes his account by briefly mentioning that the Skj√∂ldunga saga contained an extensive account of how Hr√≥lfr came to Uppsala and sowed gold on the Fyrisvellir. =Sk√°ldskaparm√°l= In the Sk√°ldskaparm√°l, Yrsa's husband king A√∞ils (Eadgils) requested Yrsa's son Hr√≥lfr's help against the Norwegian king √Åli (Onela). Hr√≥lfr was busy fighting the Saxons but sent his berserkers. When Hr√≥lfr heard that A√∞ils refused to pay, he set off to Uppsala. They brought the ships to the river Fyris and rode directly to the Swedish king's hall at Uppsala with his twelve berserkers. Yrsa welcomed them and led them to their lodgings. Fires were prepared for them and they were given drinks. However, so much wood was heaped on the fires that the clothes started to burn away from their bodies. Hr√≥lfr and his men had enough and threw the courtiers on the fire. Yrsa arrived and gave them a horn full of gold, the ring Sv√≠agris and asked them to flee. As they rode over the Fyrisvellir, they saw A√∞ils and his men pursuing them. The fleeing men threw their gold on the plain so that the pursuers would stop to collect the gold. A√∞ils, however, continued the chase on his horse Sl√∂ngvir. Hr√≥lfr then threw Sv√≠agris and saw how A√∞ils stooped down to pick up the ring with his spear. Hr√≥lfr exclaimed that he had seen the mightiest man in Sweden bend his back. =Gr√≥ttas√∂ngr= Fenja and Menja at the millThe Gr√≥ttas√∂ngr contains a stanza (nr 22) sung by the giantesses Fenja and Menja. It only names Yrsa and the situation that her son and brother (i.e. Hro√∞ulf) will avenge Fr√≥di (Froda): {  :M√∂lum enn framar. :Mun Yrsu sonr, :ni√∞r Halfdanar, :hefna Fr√≥√∞a; :s√° mun hennar :heitinn ver√∞a :burr ok br√≥√∞ir, :vitum b√°√∞ar √æat.  :Let us grind on! :Yrsa's son, :H√°lfdan's kinsman, :will avenge Fr√≥di: :he will of her :be called :son and brother: :we both know that.(Thorpe's translation) } This piece cannot refer to Hr√≥lfr Kraki's saga where Froda was the half-brother of Healfdene because this Froda was killed by Hro√∞gar. It can, however, be interpreted through the Skj√∂ldunga saga in which Hro√∞ulf's uncle Hro√∞gar was murdered by his half-brother Froda. In other pre-modern sources =Chronicon Lethrense and Annales Lundenses= The Chronicon Lethrense (and the included Annales Lundenses) tells that one day, the Danish king Helghe arrived in Halland/LollandHalland according to Chronicon Lethrense proper, Lolland according to the included Annals of Lund and slept with Thore, the daughter of one of Ro's farmers. This resulted in Yrse. Much later, he met Yrse, and without knowing that she was his daughter, he made her pregnant with Rolf Krage. Lastly, he found out that Yrse was his own daughter, went east and killed himself. Ro is the same personage as Hro√∞gar, who received Beowulf at Heorot. His co-king Helghe is the same as Hro√∞gar's brother Halga, and Rolf Krage is the same personage as Hro√∞gar's nephew Hro√∞ulf. However, in Beowulf, it is never explained in what way they were uncle and nephew. =Gesta Danorum= The Gesta Danorum (Book 2) reports that Helgo was the brother of the Danish King Ro, but whereas Ro was king of the Danish lands, Helgo had inherited the sea. One day during his sea roving, arrived at Thur√∏, where he found and raped the young girl Thora, who became pregnant with Urse. When Helgo, after many years, returned to Thur√∏, Thora avenged her lost virginity by sending Urse to Helgo who, unknowingly, raped his own daughter. This resulted in Roluo Kraki. During a Swedish invasion, Ro was killed by Hothbrodd, the King of Sweden. Helgo avenged his brother's death and made the Swedes pay tribute. However, he then chose to commit suicide due to his shame for his incestuous relationship with Urse, and their son Roluo Kraki succeeded him. Athislus, the new King of Sweden, thought that the tribute to the Daner might be smaller if he married the Danish king's mother, and so took Urse for his queen. However, after some time, Urse was so upset with the Swedish king's greediness that she thought out a ruse to run away from the king and at the same time liberate him of his wealth. She incited Athislus to rebel against Roluo, and arranged so that Roluo would be invited and promised a wealth in gifts. When the banquet had lasted for three days, Urse and Roluo escaped from Uppsala, early in the morning in carriages where they had put all the Swedish king's treasure. In order to lessen their burden, and to occupy any pursuing warriors they spread gold in their path, although there was a rumour that she only spread gilded copper. When Athislus, who was pursuing the escapers saw that a precious ring was lying on the ground, he bent down to pick it up. Roluo was pleased to see the King of Sweden bent down, and escaped in the ships with his mother. This account is more elaborate than that of Chronicon Lethrense and Annales Lundenses. Helgo is the same personage as Helghe/Halga. His brother the Danish King Ro is the same as Hro√∞gar, Roluo is the same as Hro√∞ulf/Rolf Krage, and the Swedish King Athislus is the same as Eadgils, the Swedish king of Beowulf. Yrse is here called Urse, and the story of her son fleeing the Swedish king with all his treasure is also found in the following accounts. It is noteworthy that all the Danish sources, Chronicon Lethrense, Annales Lundenses and Gesta Danorum differ on where Halga found Yrsa, but make her Danish. The Icelandic sources that follow make her a Saxon, on the other hand, and not Danish. =Beowulf= The poem Beowulf reads (lines 59‚Äì63): > > 59 √ê√¶m feower bearn for√∞gerimed > 60 in worold wocun weoroda r√¶swa > 61 heorogar. 7 hro√∞gar 7 halga til > 62 hyrde ic Íù• elan cwen > 63 hea√∞o-Scilfingas healsgebedda This appears in Gummere's translation as: > > 59 Then, one after one, there woke to him, > 60 to the chieftain of clansmen, children four: > 61 Heorogar, then Hrothgar, then Halga brave; > 62 and I heard that ‚Äì ela's queen, > 63 the Heathoscylfing‚Äôs helpmate dear. There is obviously something wrong with line 62. A name of a daughter has dropped out, a daughter who was the wife of someone whose name ends in -ela and who was Scylfing, i.e. belonging to the royal dynasty of Sweden. It is likely enough that at some time in copying the poem a scribe was unable to make out the exact spelling of these names and so left the text blank at that point to be fixed up later. It was never fixed up and so the names were lost in later copies. By Old English poetic rules of alliteration the name of the daughter must also begin with a vowel. The choice is usually the name Yrs or Yrse, since Scandinavian tradition speaks much of Yrsa the granddaughter of Healfdene and wife of King Eadgils of Sweden. This assumes great shifting of names and roles, since Eadgils is the enemy of Onela. Onela appears in Norse texts as √Åli. Accordingly, many editors and translators prefer to simply note that the line is corrupt. Others like Burton Raffel render the missing passage as Yrs (i.e. Yrsa), and modern commentary sometimes refers to the marriage of Onela and Yrsa without indicating that this exists only through somewhat dubious conjectural emendation. In film A personage named Yrsa is voiced by Leslie Harter Zemeckis (Robert Zemeckis' wife) in the 2007 animated version of Beowulf. Her only role in the movie is to be courted by the Geatish warrior Hondscio.

They were organized around John Pordage (1607‚Äì1681), an Anglican priest from Bradfield, Berkshire, who had been ejected from his parish in 1655 because of differing views, but then reinstated in 1660 during the English Restoration. Pordage was attracted to the ideas of Jakob B√∂hme, a Lutheran theosophist and Christian mystic. Origins A group of followers came to Pordage, including Ann Bathurst and led by Mrs. Jane Leade (1624‚Äì1704), who experienced a number of visions and later published them in her book A Fountain of Gardens. The group incorporated as The Philadelphian Society for the Advancement of Piety and Divine Philosophy in 1694 (their name was inspired by the Philadelphians mentioned in the Book of Revelation.) They rejected the idea of being a church, preferring the term society, and none of the members ceased their memberships in existing churches. Together, the group held views that were somewhat similar to Panentheism, regarding the belief in the presence of God in all things, and with a Nondualist component, in that they also believed the presence of the Holy Spirit exists in each and everyone's soul, and that one can become enlightened and illuminated by living a virtuous life and seeking truth through the wisdom of God. Basic beliefs Mrs. Leade's visions were a central part of the group. Around 1694, she became a Christian Universalist, rejecting the \\"Doctrine that hath been preached of an endless Misery and Torment\\" which had \\"wrought little effect in frightening or terrifying 'em from their evil Courses.\\" She believed that punishment after death was purgative, not punitive.Hirst, Julie. Jane Leade: Biography of a Seventeenth-Century Mystic. Aldershot: Ashgate, 2005. p. 27. The group's views were spread to continental Europe by Francis Lee, a non-juror at the accession of William III. The group drew up a formal confession of beliefs in 1703. However, after the death of Mrs. Leade in 1704, the group's numbers dwindled quickly. Influences In later years, although no longer officially a functioning group, many of the Philadelphian Society's views and writings, particularly those by Jane Leade, remained influential among certain groups of Behmenists, Pietists, Radical Pietists, Christian mystics, and Esoteric Christians, such as the Society of the Woman in the Wilderness (led by Johannes Kelpius), the Ephrata Cloister, and the Harmony Society, among others.

He was a delegate for New York to the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1776. Early life Alsop was born in 1724 in New Windsor, Orange County in the then British Province of New York. He was the son of John Alsop, Sr. and Abigail Sackett (1695‚Äì1752). His father was a lawyer in New Windsor, and later New York City, where he was largely interested in real estate. His parents married in 1718 and were the parents of four children, including his younger brother, Richard Alsop (1726‚Äì1776). His paternal grandparents were Capt. Richard Alsop and Hannah Underhill (1666‚Äì1757), who first settled in New York during the 1650s and served as a major in Oliver Cromwell's army, but after a disagreement with the Lord Protector, he fled to the obscurity of colonial life. His great-grandparents were Captain John Underhill (1597‚Äì1672) and Elizabeth Feake, who was the daughter of Lt. Robert Feake and Elizabeth Fones (1610‚Äìc. 1673), a descendant of Governor John Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. His maternal grandparents were Captain Joseph Sackett and Elizabeth Betts.Elizabeth Betts and Joseph Sackett left a large notable progeny. Two children married Alsops and a daughter married a Moore of Newtown. Joseph Sackett, Jr., and Hannah Alsop were great-grandparents of Hamilton Fish, Seward's successor as Secretary of State. Hamilton's son was railroad executive Stuyvesant Fish, whose wife \\"Mamie\\" was a leader of Newport society. Hamilton's sister, Susan Elizabeth Fish, married Daniel Le Roy, brother of Mrs. Daniel Webster, and left granddaughters who married George Washington Vanderbilt II of Biltmore and John Nicholas Brown of Providence, head of the family for whom Brown University is named and grandfather of J. Carter Brown, director of the National Gallery of Art. Anne Sackett and Benjamin Moore were the grandparents and great-grandparents of presidents of Columbia and great-grandparents also of Clement Clarke Moore, Hebrew scholar and author of \\"The Night Before Christmas.\\" Abigail Sackett and John Alsop were ancestors of political columnist Joseph and Stewart Alsop. His great- grandparents were Capt. Richard Betts and Joanna Chamberlayne.John Cameron Swayze and the actor Patrick Swayze were 6th cousins once removed. Both John and Patrick's father are descendants by 7 generations of Judge Samuel Swayze (March 20, 1688/1689 ‚Äì May 11, 1759) and his wife Penelope Horton (1689/1690‚Äì1746). Judge Swayze was the son of Joseph Swasey and his wife Mary Betts. Mary Betts was the daughter of Captain Richard Betts and his wife Joanna Chamberlayne. Other noteworthy relations descending from the Betts lines are actors William Holden and Tom Hulce, and Evgenia Citkowitz, wife of actor Julian Sands. Career As a young man he moved to New York City and entered the mercantile world with his brother Richard. The brothers became importers and merchants in cloth and dry goods. Their enterprise prospered, and the Alsops, for several generations, became one of the great merchant houses of the city. With the business secure, John became interested in civic and political activities. He was elected by New York County to serve in the Province of New York Assembly. He was one of the civic leaders that incorporated the New York Hospital Association, and served as its first governor from 1770 to 1784. In 1757, his brother Richard retired from business and removed to Middletown, Connecticut =American Revolution= During the first phases of the American Revolution, the Province of New York Assembly could not reach a conclusion about the Continental Congress. As a result, delegates were selected by the revolutionary committees in each county. In 1774, John Alsop, along with James Duane, John Jay, Philip Livingston, and Isaac Low were named by several counties, extending from Long Island to Albany. When the Congress convened on September 5, John Jay presented their credentials and the Congress accepted. Alsop didn't arrive in Philadelphia until September 14. As the revolution escalated in 1775, Alsop was one of the leaders of the Committee of Sixty which became the provisional government in New York City. He actively supported the non-importation agreements that he had signed the previous October in the Congress, despite the costs to his business. He was active in recruiting militia and in efforts to equip and arm them. As the Assembly continued to refuse to recognize the national Congress, he was elected to the alternative revolutionary New York Provincial Congress, and they in turn returned him to the second Continental Congress. Alsop favoured reconciliation with Great Britain and so resigned as a delegate to the Congress rather than sign the Declaration of Independence. 1776 was a critical year in the struggle for New York. Alsop began the year at Philadelphia, in a session of Congress. He made several trips between there and New York, acting as an agent of congress through his business to acquire supplies, and particularly powder for the Continental Army. After General Washington visited Congress in late May, Alsop returned with him to New York in early June. He added efforts to find housing for 8,000 Continental Army troops to his earlier and continuing work on the supply problems. When his home in Newtown was captured by the British in August, he kept working from Manhattan. By September the British had occupied Manhattan as well, ending his effective contributions to the revolution. He escaped to Middletown, Connecticut and remained until the British occupation ended in 1783. =Later years= After the war he worked to help rebuild the family business, and again became active as a civic leader. He was president of New York City's Chamber of Commerce in 1784 and 1785. Personal life Alsop's daughter, Mary Alsop who married Rufus King On June 6, 1766, he married Mary Frogat (1744‚Äì1772) in New York City. They were the parents of one daughter who was born in New York on October 17, 1769 and died in Jamaica, New York on June 5, 1819. * Mary Alsop (1769‚Äì1819), who married Rufus King (1755‚Äì1827) on March 30, 1786. They were the parents of John Alsop King (1788‚Äì1867), Charles King (1789‚Äì1867), James Gore King (1791‚Äì1853), Edward King (1795‚Äì1836) and Frederic Gore King (1802‚Äì1829). Alsop died at his home in Newtown, Queens County, New York on November 22, 1794 and is buried in Trinity Church Cemetery on Manhattan. His considerable fortune was passed to his daughter and son-in-law after his death. =Descendants= His nephew, Richard Alsop (1761‚Äì1815), was an author who wrote the National and Civil History of Chili, in two volumes, and was one of The Hartford Wits, also known as the Connecticut Wits, who were a group of American writers centered around Yale University and flourished in the 1780s and 1790s. In 1800, Alsop wrote a monody, in heroic verse, on the death of Washington. His son, also Richard Alsop (1790‚Äì1842), a partner of W. S. Wetmore, founded the house of Alsop & Co., in Valpara√≠so, Chile, and Lima, Peru. Another nephew, Joseph W. Alsop (1772‚Äì1844), had a daughter Lucy Alsop, who married Henry Chauncey, of the firm of Alsop & Chauncey, of New York City, who founded the Pacific Mail Steamship Company in 1848.

History of the people Oral history of the Ongota tells that they originated from a number of different populations from Dikinte, Maale and Arbore among others. During a stay in Maale territory, which today lies at their north, the collection of clans were chased south due to their hunting of Maale livestock. They followed the banks of the Weito River until they reached the Arbore, where they were turned away back north and settled where they are today.

Sav√† and Tosco (2003, 2007), themselves, believe it to be an East Cushitic language with a Nilo-Saharan substratum‚Äîthat is, that Ongota speakers shifted to East Cushitic from an earlier Nilo-Saharan language, traces of which still remain. Fleming (2006) considers it to be an independent branch of Afroasiatic. Bonny Sands (2009) believes Sav√† and Tosco's proposal to be the most convincing proposal. Sava & Tosco (2015) leave it unclassified, possibly an isolate but possibly so affected by superstrate influence that the original affiliation of the language has been obscured. Decline The main mechanism behind the decline of Ongota is marriage with other communities. In a brief expedition in the early 1990s, a number of researchers made the observation that many Ongota men married Tsamakko women. The child would grow up speaking only the mother's language, but not the father's. (Mikesh, P. et al., 1992‚Äì1993) This trend has continued through the recent years.

Ohthere (also Ohtere), Old Norse √ìttarr vendilkr√°ka (Vendelcrow; in Modern Swedish Ottar Vendelkr√•ka) was a semi-legendary king of Sweden of the house of Scylfings, who is said to have lived during the Germanic Heroic Age, possibly during the early 6th century (fl. c. 515 - c. 530\\"Ottar\\", Encyclopedia Nordisk familjebok). His name can be reconstructed as Proto-Norse *≈åhta-harjaz or *≈åhtu-harjaz. The harjaz element is common in Germanic names and has a meaning of \\"warrior, army\\" (whence English harry); by contrast, the oht element is less frequent, and has been tentatively interpreted as \\"fearsome, feared\\".Peterson, Lena. Lexikon √∂ver urnnordiska personnamn PDF A prince of the Swedes, Ohthere and his brother Onela conducted successful raids against the Geats after King Hrethel had died. In 515, their father Ongentheow was killed in battle by the Geats, and Ohthere succeeded his father as the king of Sweden. Ohthere led an army against the Geats, and besieged one of their armies. He nearly killed the Geatish king Hygelac but lost many of his forces in the conflict. Ohthere managed to get back to Sweden. In the 520s, Ohthere led a large raid to Denmark and plundered the Danish coast. A Danish army led by two Jarls, however, was waiting for him. Battle broke out. The Danish were reinforced, and Ohthere was killed in the battle. His corpse was taken back to Sweden and buried in an earthwork mound. Beowulf In the Old English poem Beowulf, the name of Ohthere appears only in constructions referring to his father Ongen√æeow (f√¶der Ohtheres),Line 2929. mother (Onelan modor and Ohtheres),Line 2933. and his sons Eadgils (suna Ohteres,Lines 2381, sunu OhteresLine 2395.) and Eanmund (suna Ohteres).Lines 2613. When Ohthere and his actions are concerned, he is referred to as Ongen√æeow's offspring, together with his brother Onela. The following section deals with Ohthere and Onela pillaging the Geats at the death of their king Hre√∞el, restarting the Swedish- Geatish wars: {  :√ûa w√¶s synn and sacu Sweona and Geata, :ofer wid w√¶ter wroht gem√¶ne, :here-ni√∞ hearda, sy√∞√∞an Hre√∞el swealt, :o√∞√∞e him Ongen√æeowes eaferan w√¶ran :frome fyrd-hwate, freode ne woldon :ofer heafo healdan, ac ymb Hreosna-beorh :eatolne inwit-scear oft gefremedon.Lines 2473-2480.  :There was strife and struggle 'twixt Swede and Geat :o'er the width of waters; war arose, :hard battle-horror, when Hrethel died, :and Ongentheow's offspring grew :strife-keen, bold, nor brooked o'er the seas :pact of peace, but pushed their hosts :to harass in hatred by Hreosnabeorh.Modern English translation by Francis Barton Gummere  } Later, it is implied in the poem that Ohthere has died, because his brother Onela is king. Ohthere's sons Eadgils and Eanmund fled to the Geats and the wars began anew.  Scandinavian sources  Ynglingatal, Ynglinga saga, √çslendingab√≥k, and Historia Norvegiae all present √ìttarr as the son of Egill (called Ongen√æeow in Beowulf) and as the father of A√∞√≠sl/A√∞ils/athils/Adils (Eadgils). According to the latest source, Ynglinga saga, √ìttarr refused to pay tribute to the Danish king Fr√≥√∞i for the help that his father had received. When Fr√≥√∞i sent two men to collect the tribute, √ìttarr answered that the Swedes had never paid tribute to the Danes and would not begin with him. Fr√≥√∞i gathered a vast host and looted in Sweden, but the next summer he pillaged in the east. When √ìttarr learnt that Fr√≥√∞i was gone, he sailed to Denmark to plunder in return and went into the Limfjord where he pillaged in Vendsyssel. Fr√≥√∞i's jarls Vott and Faste attacked √ìttarr in the fjord. The battle was even and many men fell, but the Danes were reinforced by the people in the neighbourhood and so the Swedes lost (a version apparently borrowed from the death of √ìttarr's predecessor Jorund). The Danes put √ìttarr's corpse on a mound to be devoured by wild beasts, and made a wooden crow that they sent to Sweden, with the message that the wooden crow was all that √ìttarr was worth. After this, √ìttarr was called Vendelcrow. It is only Snorri who uses the epithet Vendelcrow, whereas the older sources Historia Norvegiae and √çslendingab√≥k use it for his father Egill. Moreover, only Snorri's work tells the story of √ìttarr's death in Vendsyssel, and it is probably his own invention. Ynglingatal mentions only that √ìttarr was killed by the Danish jarls Vott and Faste in a place named Vendel (Laing has been influenced by Snorri's version in his translation): {  :F√©ll √ìttarr :und ara greipar :dugandligr :fyrir Dana v√°pnum, :√æann hergammr :hr√¶gum f≈ìti :viti borinn :√° Vendli sparn. :√ûau fr√° ek verk :V√∂tts ok Fasta :s≈ìnskri √æj√≥√∞ :at s√∂gum ver√∞a; :at eylands :jarlar Fr√≥√∞a :v√≠gframa√∞ :um veginn h√∂f√∞u.The original text at Heimskringla Norr√∏ne Tekster og Kvad  :By Danish arms the hero bold, :Ottar the Brave, lies stiff and cold. :To Vendel's plain the corpse was borne; :By eagles' claws the corpse is torn, :Spattered by ravens' bloody feet, :The wild bird's prey, the wild wolf's meat. :The Swedes have vowed revenge to take :On Frode's earls, for Ottar's sake; :Like dogs to kill them in their land, :In their own homes, by Swedish hand.Laing's translation at Sacred Texts  } The Historia Norwegi√¶ presents a Latin summary of Ynglingatal, older than Snorri's quotation (continuing after Egil): {  Cui successit in regnum filius suus Ottarus, qui a suo √¶quivoco Ottaro Danorum comite et fratre ejus Fasta in una provinciarum Dani√¶, scilicet Wendli, interemptus est.

His son Adils [...]Ekrem, Inger (editor), Lars Boje Mortensen (editor) and Peter Fisher (translator) (2003). Historia Norwegie.

Ohthere's Barrow Ohthere's barrow (Swedish: Ottarsh√∂gen) () is located in Vendel parish, Uppland, Sweden. The barrow is 5 metres high and 40 metres wide. In the 17th century, the barrow was known locally as Ottarsh√∂gen. The term H√∂g is derived from the Old Norse word haugr, meaning mound or barrow. The barrow was excavated in the period 1914‚Äì16. It showed the remains of both a man and a woman, and the finds were worthy of a king.A presentation by the Swedish National Heritage Board The Swedish archaeologist Sune LindqvistFornv√§nnen 1917, Sune Lindqvist, \\"Ottarsh√∂gen i Vendel\\", p. 142 reported that in its centre, there was a wooden vessel with ashes. There were few finds but they were well-preserved. There were some decorative panels similar to those found in the other Vendel era graves nearby. A comb with a case was found, as well as a golden Roman coin, a solidus, dated to be no later than 477. It had been perforated and was probably used as decoration, but it showed signs of wear and tear and had probably been worn for a longer time. Lindqvist stated that the identification of the barrow as that of Ohthere could not receive more archaeological confirmation than those provided by the excavation. Notes References *Nerman, B.

For his part in the Outer Mongolian revolution of 1921, he was enshrined as the \\"Father of Mongolia's Revolution\\".Paul Bacon - Escaping the Ice-Prison, p.4 Early life Monument marking S√ºkhbaatar's birthplace Yanjmaa S√ºkhbaatar (literally meaning \\"Axe Hero\\" in the Mongolian language) was born in present-day Ulaanbaatar, the Chinese trading settlement some kilometers east of Ikh Kh√ºree (later Niislel Kh√ºree, now Ulaanbaatar), as the third of four children. His parents had deserted their home banner in Setsen Khan aimag, and his father lived from odd jobs and as a day laborer. When S√ºkhbaatar was six, the family moved close to the Russian consulate. It was from playing with the Russian children that he learnt to speak some Russian. At the age of 14, S√ºkhbaatar had the opportunity to get an education, from Zaisan Jamyan. From the age of 16 onwards, he worked as a proxy rider (at that time, people who were obliged to render certain services to the authorities often employed other people to replace them) for several years. After Mongolia's first declaration of independence in 1911, S√ºkhbaatar was drafted into the new nation's army. In the Bogd Khan's army S√ºkhbaatar on horseback S√ºkhbaatar In 1912, Russian advisers to the Bogd Khan set up a military school at Khujirbulan, and S√ºkhbaatar was one of the soldiers transferred there. His talent for military tactics and his skills at riding and shooting earned him the respect of his comrades, and after the training he became a platoon leader of the machine gun company at Khujirbulan. In 1913, he set up his own household with his wife Yanjmaa. They had had their first son in 1911, but Yanjmaa's parents objected to the relationship on the grounds that S√ºkhbaatar was too poor. In late June 1914, S√ºkhbaatar was involved in a soldiers' riot against the bad living conditions and corruption in the army, but this episode seems to have had no negative repercussions for him. The so- called autonomous period was a rather unruly one, and in 1917 S√ºkhbaatar was deployed to Mongolia's eastern border, under the command of Khatanbaatar Magsarjav. In 1918, the Mongolian government set up a printing office for printing law codes and Buddhist texts, and S√ºkhbaatar was transferred there. The office was led by Jamyan, so one reason for this transfer may have been that S√ºkhbaatar's name had been forwarded by his old teacher. Another reason may have been that S√ºkhbaatar's superiors wanted to keep him apart from the other soldiers. Chinese occupation In 1918‚Äì1919, as Russia struggled with revolution and civil war in the aftermath of World War I, the Chinese moved to re exert their rule of Outer Mongolia. Some nobles began negotiations with the Chinese amban Chen Yi on the subject of abolishing Mongolia's autonomy, and in autumn 1919 General Xu Shuzheng occupied Niislel Kh√ºree and forced the Bogd Khan to sign an edict that incorporated Mongolia into the Republic of China. At about the same time, two secret groups that would later evolve into the Mongolian People's Party were founded, and S√ºkhbaatar was a member of one of them. After the Chinese takeover, the printing office was closed and the army dispersed, so S√ºkhbaatar became jobless. The two secret groups united in early 1920, and began putting up posters in which they criticized the new rulers. They began gathering intelligence on the Chinese forces in Kh√ºree, and on the attitudes of the Bogd Khan, other high lamas, and the upper nobles, towards the Chinese. Also, they established contacts with some revolutionaries among Kh√ºree's Russian community. In mid-1920, several Comintern agents convinced the secret group to send a delegation to Irkutsk. Consequently, the group was renamed the Mongolian People's Party on June 25, 1920, and lots were drawn to see who would travel to Russia to obtain Soviet support. Danzan and Choibalsan left in early July, Bodoo and Chagdarjav followed in mid-July. On July 25, the remaining group succeeded, via Da Lama Puntsagdorj, in obtaining a letter in which the Bogd Khan asked Soviet Russia for support against the Chinese.similar letters were, at the same time, sent to US and Japanese representatives. With this letter, S√ºkhbaatar, Darizavyn Losol and Dansranbilegiin Dogsom left for Russia in late July, 1921. S√ºkhbaatar was in charge of smuggling the Bogd Khan's letter through the Chinese checkpoints, and the hollowed handle of his whip he used for this purpose is today displayed in a museum in Ulaanbaatar.Charles R. Bawden, The Modern History of Mongolia, London 1968, p. 210f People's Revolution Back row from left:?,?, Rinchingiin Elbegdorj, Soliin Danzan, Damdin S√ºkhbaatar, Ajvaagiin Danzan, Shumyatskii, ?, Dogsomyn Bodoo By August 19, 1920, the Mongolian delegates had all reached Irkutsk and met with a representative of the Soviet Russian Government, named Gapon. Gapon relayed that Soviet Russia was ready to help Mongolia, but that the delegates should explain what kind of government they wanted to establish, how they would fight against the foreign enemy, and what their future policy would be like. In early September, Danzan, Losol and Chagdarjav were sent on to Moscow via Omsk, while S√ºkhbaatar and Choibalsan were to remain in Irkutsk for military training and to maintain contact between the delegation in Moscow and Mongolia. Bodoo and Dogsom were sent back to Kh√ºree. Painting of S√ºkhbaatar In the meantime, the Chinese had imprisoned a number of members and sympathizers of the secret group. In late 1920, White Russian forces under Lieutenant General Baron Ungern had entered Mongolia from the east, and in late February 1921 occupied Niislel Kh√ºree. Choibalsan and Chagdarjav were sent back into Mongolia to establish contacts with nationalist-minded nobles and other leaders. On February 9, S√ºkhbaatar was appointed commander-in-chief of the Mongolian People's Partisans. He began recruiting soldiers, and on February 20 the partisans had their first engagement with Chinese troops, followed by other encounters in the following days. At the founding congress of the Mongolian People's Party (MPP) at Kyakhta on March 1‚Äì13, 1921, S√ºkhbaatar was again appointed commander-in-chief and elected into the newly established provisional government. Painting depicting S√ºkhbaatar meeting Vladimir Lenin in Moscow Immediately after the congress, the provisional government and the MPP central committee decided to seize the Mongolian part of Khiagt from the Chinese troops, and on February 15 an ultimatum was sent to the Chinese military authorities in the town. The Chinese commanders refused to surrender, and on March 18, S√ºkhbaatar's troops succeeded in taking the town, despite being heavily outnumbered. This day is now the official holiday of Mongolia's army, and is usually celebrated as the equivalent of Defender of the Fatherland Day in Russia. The provisional government moved to the Mongolian part of Khiagt and began to establish Ministries of the Army, Finances and Foreign Affairs, but when a fire in the aftermath of the battle burnt down the greater part of the town, the government moved on to Altanbulag. At the end of May 1921, Khiagt came under pressure from Baron Ungern's forces, who moved towards Soviet Russia. This offensive was repulsed by mid-June, with the help of troops of the Far Eastern Republic. At the end of June, the People's Partisans and the Red Army decided to attack Kh√ºree. They reached the town on July 6, having destroyed smaller groups of Ungern's forces on the way. On July 11, a new government was proclaimed, with S√ºkhbaatar becoming Minister of the Army and the Bogd Khan's powers limited to those of a rather symbolic nature. Mongolian postage stamp of 1932 showing S√ºkhbaatar Death The new government was not in a secure position, and rumours of anti-communist plots increased. In 1922, Bodoo, Chagdarjav, Da Lama Puntsagdorj and others were executed on allegations that they had collaborated with internal and external enemies of the new state. In early 1923, amid official suspicions that a coup was planned for Tsagaan Sar, the state of alert became too exhausting for S√ºkhbaatar. He broke down on the night of February 14/15, and died on February 20. In the 1940s under Choibalsan's reign, it was alleged that S√ºkhbaatar had been poisoned, but later socialist publications did not explicitly discuss the cause of death. Nonetheless, this version is still somewhat popular in Mongolia. Some historians say that he died of pneumonia, because of cold rain. Neither version could be proved officially. Mongolia's capital was renamed Ulaanbaatar (\\"Red Hero\\") in 1924. The Order of Sukhbaatar became the highest decoration of the Mongolian state. In 1954, he was exhumed from his grave at Altan √ñlgii National Cemetery and reinterred in the newly built mausoleum at S√ºkhbaatar square. When the mausoleum was dismantled in 2005, he was cremated and his ashes buried in Altan √ñlgii again. His cremation was supervised by Buddhist monks. S√ºkhbaatar's widow Yanjmaa went on to serve in a number of senior positions in the Mongolian government, including acting president. A statue of S√ºkhbaatar stands at S√ºkhbaatar Square in front of the government building in Ulaanbaatar today. Other places named after S√ºkhbaatar include S√ºkhbaatar Province, the capital of Selenge Province, and a district of Ulaanbaatar. Mongolian bank notes between 5 and 100 t√∂gr√∂g (1993 series) feature an image of S√ºkhbaatar, with higher denomination notes bearing the portrait of Genghis Khan.

It was made by a company called Tribal Voice, Inc. Features Many of the features found in contemporary instant messaging programs were first introduced in PowWow. The program also had several innovative features such as allowing users to talk with each other using VoIP, a shared whiteboard, a built-in speech synthesizer, WAV sound file playing, offline transmittal of instant messages via POP/SMTP, and the ability for users to share their web surfing experience concurrently by redirecting either party to a new URL when another navigates elsewhere. It also had built-in file transfer with a simple drag-and-drop interface to make file sharing very easy. History The company was founded in Woodland Park, Colorado, United States, at the end of 1994, by the software millionaire John McAfee, founder of McAfee Associates (later called McAfee or Intel Security Group). At first, the company described itself, especially on its web site, as a 'Native American' company run by Native Americans. As the company grew, the Native American references gradually disappeared. The company eventually located its corporate headquarters in Scotts Valley, California. In the late 1990s, Tribal Voice began to OEM the PowWow software in order to increase market share. While most of these deals were insubstantial, several were with high-profile companies, including AT&T;'s WorldNet Internet service provider (ISP), search engine/portal AltaVista, and Freeserve, a United Kingdom-based ISP. PowWow was one of the first instant messaging programs to provide interoperability between multiple instant messaging clients, being compatible with both AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) and Microsoft's MSN Messenger. In the late 1990s AOL sued Tribal Voice for use of the phrase 'buddy list' and made repeated efforts to block interoperability between their instant messaging client and Tribal Voice's, as well as those of other companies. In 1998, original founder McAfee brought in Joseph Esposito, formerly the president and CEO of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, to run the company. In 1999, the company was acquired by dot-com incubator CMGI, who moved the company's development center from Woodland Park to Colorado Springs, Colorado, and closed the Scotts Valley office. In 2000, CMGI merged the company into CMGIon, a division of CMGI, founded with help from Sun Microsystems and Novell. In January 2001, CMGIon closed its Colorado Springs office, the former Tribal Voice.

Henson said he was the first of their party to reach the pole. Henson was born in Nanjemoy, Maryland, to sharecropper parents who were free Black Americans before the Civil War. He spent most of his early life in Washington, D.C., but left school at the age of twelve to work as a cabin boy. He later returned to Washington and worked as a salesclerk at a good department store. One of his customers was Robert Peary, who in 1887 hired him as a personal valet. At the time, Peary was working on the Nicaragua Canal. Their first Arctic expedition together was in 1891‚Äì92. Henson served as a navigator and craftsman, and was known as Peary's \\"first man\\". Like Peary, he studied Inuit survival techniques. During their 1908‚Äì09 expedition to Greenland, Henson was one of the six men ‚Äì including Peary and four Inuit assistants ‚Äì who claimed to have been the first to reach the geographic North Pole. In interviews, Henson identified as the first member of the party to reach what they believed was the pole. Their claim had gained widespread acceptance but in 1989, Wally Herbert published research that found that their expedition records were unreliable, indicated an implausibly high speed during their final rush for the pole, and that the men could have fallen short of the pole due to navigational errors. Henson achieved a degree of fame as a result of participating in the expedition, and in 1912 he published a memoir titled A Negro Explorer at the North Pole. As he approached old age, his exploits received renewed attention. In 1937 he was the first African American to be made a life member of The Explorers Club; in 1948 he was elevated to the club's highest level of membership. In 1944 Henson was awarded the Peary Polar Expedition Medal, and he was received at the White House by Presidents Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower. In 1988 he and his wife were re-interred at Arlington National Cemetery. In 2000 Henson was posthumously awarded the Hubbard Medal by the National Geographic Society. Early life and education Henson was born on August 8, 1866 on his parents' farm east of the Potomac River in Charles County, Maryland, to sharecroppers who had been free people of color before the American Civil War. Matthew's parents were subjected to attacks by the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups, who terrorized southern freedmen and former free people of color after the Civil War. To escape from racial violence in southern Maryland, in 1867 the Henson family sold the farm and moved to Georgetown, then still an independent town adjacent to the national capital. He had an older sister S., born in 1864, and two younger sisters Eliza and S.Bradley Robinson, \\"Matthew Henson genealogy\\", Matthew A. Henson website, 2012, accessed 2 October 2013 Matthew's mother died when Matthew was seven. His father Lemuel remarried to a woman named Caroline and had additional children with her, including daughters and a son. After his father died, Matthew was sent to live with his uncle, who lived in Washington, D.C. (Georgetown was made part of Washington, DC in 1871.) The uncle paid for a few years of education for Matthew but soon died. Henson attended a black public school for the next six years, during the last of which he took a summer job washing dishes in a restaurant. His early years were marked by one especially memorable event. When he was 10 years old, he went to a ceremony honoring Abraham Lincoln, the American president who had fought so hard to preserve the Union during the Civil War and had issued the proclamation that had freed slaves in the occupied Confederate states in 1863. At the ceremony, Matthew was greatly inspired by a speech given by Frederick Douglass, an escaped slave and renowned orator, the longtime leading figure in the American black community. Douglass called upon blacks to vigorously pursue educational opportunities and battle racial prejudice. At the age of twelve, the youth made his way to Baltimore, Maryland, a busy port. He went to sea as a cabin boy on the merchant ship Katie Hines, traveling to ports in China, Japan, Africa, and the Russian Arctic seas. The ship's leader, Captain Childs, took Henson under his wing and taught him to read and write. Exploration Henson in his Arctic furs While working at a Washington D.C. clothing store, B.H.Stinemetz and Sons, in November 1887, Henson met Commander Robert E. Peary. Learning of Henson's sea experience, Peary recruited him as an aide for his planned voyage and surveying expedition to Nicaragua, with four other men. Peary supervised 45 engineers on the canal survey in Nicaragua. Impressed with Henson's seamanship on that voyage, Peary recruited him as a colleague and he became \\"first man\\" in his expeditions. After that, for more than 20 years, their expeditions were to the Arctic. Henson traded with the Inuit and mastered ; they called him Mahri-Pahluk. He was remembered as the only non- Inuit who became skilled in driving the dog sleds and in training dog teams in the Inuit way. He was a skilled craftsman, often coming up with solutions for what the team needed in the harsh Arctic conditions; they learned to build igloos out of snow, for mobile housing as they traveled. His and Peary's teams covered thousands of miles in dog sleds and reached the \\"Farthest North\\" point of any Arctic expedition until 1909. =1908‚Äì09 expedition= Photograph of Henson and the four Inuit guides on the last stretch of their 1908‚Äì09 expedition, taken by Peary at what they believed to be the North Pole. In 1908‚Äì09, Peary mounted his eighth attempt to reach the North Pole. The expedition was large, as Peary planned to use his system of setting up cached supplies along the way. When he and Henson boarded his ship Roosevelt, leaving Greenland on August 18, 1909, they were accompanied by Peary selected Henson and four Inuit as part of the team of six men who would make the final run to the Pole. Before the goal was reached, Peary could no longer continue on foot and rode in a dog sled. Various accounts say he was ill, exhausted, or had frozen toes. He sent Henson ahead as a scout. In a newspaper interview, Henson later said: Henson proceeded to plant the American flag. The claim by Peary's team to have reached the North Pole was widely debated in newspapers at the time, as was the competing claim by Frederick Cook. The National Geographic Society, as well as, the Naval Affairs Subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives both credited Peary's team with having reached the North Pole. Others remained doubtful. A reassessment of Peary's notebook by British polar explorer Wally Herbert in 1988 found it \\"lacking in essential data\\", thus, renewing doubts about Peary's claim. Later life Photograph of Henson in civilian clothing, taken from his 1912 book A Negro Explorer at the North Pole. In 1912 Henson published a memoir about his arctic explorations, A Negro Explorer at the North Pole. In this, he describes himself as a \\"general assistant, skilled craftsperson, interpreter [he had learned an Inuit language], and laborer.\\" He later collaborated with author Bradley Robinson on his 1947 biography, Dark Companion, which told more about his life. During the following decades, Admiral Peary received many honors for leading the expedition to the Pole, but Henson's contributions were largely ignored. In 1909 he was honored at dinners within the black community. Henson spent most of the next 30 years working on staff in the U.S. Customs House in New York, at the suggestion of Theodore Roosevelt. He later gained renewed attention. In 1937 Henson was admitted as a member to the prestigious Explorers Club in New York City, and made an honorary member in 1948, of whom there are only 20 per year. In 1944 Congress awarded him and five other Peary aides duplicates of the Peary Polar Expedition Medal, a silver medal given to Peary.\\"Vote Grants Medals to Peary Aides\\", New York Times, 20 January 1944. Presidents Truman and Eisenhower both honored Henson before he died in 1955.\\"President Greets Last Survivor of Peary Arctic Dash\\", New York Times, 7 April 1954. Henson died in the Bronx on March 9, 1955, at the age of 88. He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery and survived by his wife Lucy. After her death in 1968, she was buried with him. In 1988, both their bodies were moved for reinterment at Arlington National Cemetery, accompanied by a commemoration ceremony. Family Henson married Eva Flint in 1891, but their marriage did not survive their long periods of separation and they divorced in 1897. He later married Lucy Ross in New York City on September 7, 1907.Marriage License for New York County number 22771 for the year 1907.

Allen, \\"The Henson Family\\", National Geographic, 174, September 1988, pp. 414‚Äì429. During the extended expeditions to Greenland, Henson and Peary both took Inuit women as \\"country wives\\" and fathered children with them. Henson's concubine, known as Akatingwah, fathered his only child, a son named Anauakaq, born in 1906. Anauakaq's children are Henson's only descendants. After 1909, Henson never saw Akatingwah or his son again; other explorers sometimes updated him about them. The existence of Henson's and Peary's descendants was first made public by French explorer and ethnologist Jean Malaurie who spent a year in Greenland in 1951-52. S. Allen Counter, a neuroscientist and director of the Harvard Foundation, had long been interested in Henson's story and traveled in Greenland for research related to it. Learning of possible descendants of the explorers, in 1986 he tracked down Henson's and Peary's sons, Anauakaq and Kali, respectively. By then the men were octogenarians.People: \\"Dr. S. Allen Counter\\" , Intercultural Issues, 2005‚Äì2009, Harvard Foundation, Harvard University, accessed 1 October 2013. He arranged a visit for them the following year to the United States, where they met American relatives from both families and visited their fathers' graves.Dr. S. Allen Counter, \\"North Pole Legacy: Black, White, and Eskimo\\" (1991; Invisible Cities Press, reprint 2001). Anauakaq died in 1987. He and his wife Aviaq had five sons and a daughter, who have children of their own. While some still reside in Greenland,\\"Ahnahkaq [sic] Henson, 80, Dies; A Son of Explorer With Peary\\", New York Times, 12 July 1987. others have moved to Sweden or the United States. Several Inuit family members returned to Washington, D.C., in 1988 for the ceremony of reinterment of Henson and his wife Lucy at Arlington National Cemetery. Counter had petitioned President Ronald Reagan for this honor to gain recognition of Henson's contributions to Arctic exploration. Counter wrote a book about his finding Anauakaq and Kali, his research on Henson's life and contributions, historical racial relations, and the Inuits' meeting with Henson and Peary relatives in the United States, entitled North Pole Legacy: Black, White and Eskimo (1991). The material was also adapted and produced as a film documentary by the same name. =Extended family= Matthew Henson's only direct descendants were the children of his Inuit son and their children. According to S. Allen Counter, in his lifetime Henson had identified families of two nieces as being part of his extended birth family. They were Virginia Carter Brannum, daughter of Henson's sister Eliza Henson Carter of Washington, D.C., and Olive Henson Fulton of Boston, daughter of his half-brother. In a 1988 article, Counter noted that these two women had letters and photographs certifying their kinship. They were the only family members to attend Henson's funeral in 1955, along with his widow Lucy Ross Henson. Counter later recommended to the United States Navy and the National Geographic Society that Audrey Mebane, daughter of Virginia Brannum, and Olive Henson Fulton be designated as family representatives for any ceremonies honoring Henson. Henson is believed to be a brother of the great- great-grandfather of actress Taraji P. Henson.Tucker, Neely (October 6, 2011). Henson, spent most of her summers as a child in Scotland Neck, North Carolina, a small town between Rocky Mount and Ronoake Rapids. It is about an hour and a half from Raleigh, NC and 45 mins from the Virginia state line. \\"The real Taraji Henson\\". The Washington Post. Representation in media *S.

History European-American settlement began in the mid-19th century, with most migrants coming from New England and New York. The township and community were named after the Iroquois nation of Onondaga, historically based in New York. A post office was first established at the place about 1844, with Perez Howland as the first postmaster. In 1847 Perez Howland built a grocery. A post office was operated from the grocery. Cyrus Baldwin subsequently purchased the building and converted it into the \\"Onondaga Hotel\\". The first store of any consequence in the place was established in 1867 by John Sherman. The European-American plat of the village of Onondaga was laid out by John Sherman and others, on July 13, 1870. Several buildings had previously been erected, but the place dates its permanent growth from this time. It was also about that date that the Grand River Valley division of the Michigan Central Railroad was built through the town, which brought more settlers and businesses. Sherman donated land for the depot. The first church, called the First Congregational Church of Onondaga, was built in 1877.

In modern England and Wales, it is recognised as a form of property, one of three elements of a manor that may exist separately or be combined, and may be held in moieties: #the title (deriving from the Roman concept of dignitas); #the manorial, comprising the manor and/or its land; and #the seignory, rights granted to the titular holder of the manor. A title similar to such a lordship is known in French as Sieur or , in German, (Kaleagasi) in Turkish, in Norwegian and Swedish, in Welsh, in Dutch, and or in Italian. Types Historically a lord of the manor could either be a tenant-in-chief if he held a capital manor directly from the Crown, or a mesne lord if he was the vassal of another lord. The origins of the lordship of manors arose in the Anglo-Saxon system of manorialism. Following the Norman conquest, land at the manorial level was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 (the Normans' registry in Sicily was called, in Latin, the Catalogus Baronum, compiled a few years later). The title cannot nowadays be subdivided. This has been prohibited since 1290 by the statute of Quia Emptores that prevents tenants from alienating their lands to others by subinfeudation, instead requiring all tenants wishing to alienate their land to do so by substitution. Lord Denning, in Corpus Christi College Oxford v Gloucestershire County Council [1983] QB 360, described the manor thus: Naming individuals The owner of a lordship of the manor can be described as [Personal Name], Lord/Lady of the Manor of [Placename], sometimes shortened to Lord or Lady of [Placename].Time Traveller's Handbook: A guide to the past published by Ontario Genealogical Society & Dundurn Press In modern times any person may choose to use a name that is not the property of another. Under English common law a person may choose to be known by any name he sees fit as long as it is not done to commit fraud or evade an obligation; such changes are often made by deed poll (a deed of declaration of change of name). A manorial lordship is not a noble title, but a semi-extinct form of landed property. Lordship in this sense is a synonym for ownership, although this ownership involved a historic legal jurisdiction in the form of the court baron.\\"Can I buy a British title?\\" (page from British embassy in US) The journal Justice of the Peace & Local Government Law advises that the position is unclear as to whether a lordship of a manor is a title of honour or a dignity, as this is yet to be tested by the courts.Justice of the Peace Local Government Law (legal journal) Technically, lords of manors are barons, or freemen; however, they do not use the term as a title. Unlike titled barons, they did not have a right to sit in the House of Lords, which was the case for all noble peers until the House of Lords Act 1999. John Selden in his esteemed work Titles of Honour (1672) writes, \\"The word Baro (Latin for Baron) hath been also so much communicated, that not only all Lords of Manors have been from ancient time, and are at this day called sometimes Barons (as in the stile of their Court Barons, which is Curia Baronis, &c.; And I have read hors de son Barony in a barr to an Avowry for hors de son fee) But also the Judges of the Exchequer have it from antient time fixed on them.\\" John Martin Robinson, Maltravers Herald Extraordinary and co-author of The Oxford Guide to Heraldry, gave his opinion that \\"Lordship of this or that manor is no more a title than Landlord of The Dog and Duck\\".Baronage FAQs\\"The Dog and Duck\\" is a common pub name in England. The owner of a pub is often referred to as the landlord. The style 'Lord of the Manor of X' or 'Lord of X' is, in this sense, more of a description than a title, somewhat similar to the term Laird in Scotland. King's College, Cambridge has given the view that the term 'indicated wealth and privilege, and it carried rights and responsibilities'.King's College Cambridge, Estates: Lord of the manors Manorial rights or incidents Since 1965 Lords of the Manor have been entitled to compensation in the event of compulsory purchase. Before the Land Registration Act 2002 it was possible for manors to be registered with HM Land Registry. Manorial incidents, which are the rights that a lord of the manor may exercise over other people's land, lapsed on 12 October 2013 if not registered by then with the Land Registry. This is a separate issue to the registration of lordships of manors, since both registered and unregistered lordships will continue to exist after that date. It is only their practical rights that will lose what is called 'overriding interest', or in other words the ability to affect land even if the interests or rights are not registered against that land, as of 12 October 2013. Manorial incidents can still be recorded for either registered or unregistered manors; however, proof of existence of the rights may need to be submitted to the Land Registry before they will be noted and they may not be registered at all after affected land is sold after 12 October 2013. This issue does not affect the existence of the title of lord of the manor. There have been cases where manors have been sold and the seller has unknowingly parted with rights to unregistered land in England and Wales. Tenancy In England in the Middle Ages, land was held of the English monarch or ruler by a powerful local supporter, who gave protection in return. The people who had sworn homage to the lord were known as vassals. Vassals were nobles who served loyalty for the king, in return for being given the use of land. After the Norman conquest of England, however, all land in England was owned by the monarch who then granted the use of it by means of a transaction known as enfeoffment, to earls, barons, and others, in return for military service. The person who held feudal land directly from the king was known as a tenant-in- chief (see also Land tenure). Sub-tenancy Military service was based upon units of ten knights (see Knight-service). An important tenant-in-chief might be expected to provide all ten knights, and lesser tenants-in-chief, half of one. Some tenants-in-chief 'sub-infeuded', that is, granted, some land to a sub-tenant. Further sub-infeudation could occur down to the level of a lord of a single manor, which in itself might represent only a fraction of a knight's fee. A mesne lord was the level of lord in the middle holding several manors, between the lords of a manor and the superior lord. The sub-tenant might have to provide knight-service, or finance just a portion of it, or pay something purely nominal. Any further sub-infeudation was prohibited by the Statute of in 1290. Knight-service was abolished by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660. Manorial courts Manors were defined as an area of land and became closely associated to the advowson of the church; often by default the advowson was appended to the rights of the Manor, sometimes separated into moieties.A digest of the laws of England respecting real property, Volume 5 page 3 item 8Lord and peasant in nineteenth century Britain, London : Croom Helm; Totowa, N.J. : Rowman and Littlefield, 1980. Chapter 1 from page 15 & 16 Many lords of the manor were known as squires, at a time when land ownership was the basis of power. While some inhabitants were serfs who were bound to the land, others were freeholders, often known as franklins, who were free from customary services. Periodically all the tenants met at a 'manorial court', with the lord of the manor (or squire), or a steward, as chairman. These courts, known as courts baron, dealt with the tenants' rights and duties, changes of occupancy, and disputes between tenants. Some manorial courts also had the status of a court leet, and so they elected constables and other officials and were effectively magistrates' courts for minor offences. Later history The tenure of the freeholders was protected by the royal courts. After the Black Death, labour was in demand and so it became difficult for the lords of manors to impose duties on serfs. However their customary tenure continued and in the 16th century the royal courts also began to protect these customary tenants, who became known as copyholders. The name arises because the tenant was given a copy of the court's record of the fact as a title deed. During the 19th century, traditional manor courts were phased out. This was largely due to the fact that by the mid 17th century, large English cities had leading residents such as John Harrison (died 1656) of Leeds who saw the possession of the manor by only one resident as \\"giving him too great a superiority over his fellow townsmen, and exposing him to considerable odium\\". Thus, the Manor of Leeds was divided between several people (shares). This situation could create legal problems. In January 1872, as a group, the \\"lords of the manor of Leeds\\" applied to the Law Courts to ascertain if they could \\"exercise acts of ownership\\" over land at a time when manorial rights were being sold to larger city corporations. In 1854, the lords of the manor of Leeds had \\"sold\\" these acts of ownership to the \\"corporation of Leeds\\" which would become the City of Leeds. By 1925, copyhold tenure had formally ended with the enactment of Law of Property Acts, Law of Property Act 1922 and Law of Property (Amendment) Act 1924, converting copyhold to fee simple. Although copyhold was abolished, the title of Lord of the Manor remains, and certain rights attached to it will also remain if registered under the Land Registration Act 2002, which Act ended manorial incidents unprotected by registration at HM Land Registry after October 2013. The Land Registration Act 2002 does not affect the existence of unregistered lordships after October 2013, only the rights that would have previously been attached to the same. During the latter part of the 20th century, many of these titles were sold to wealthy individuals seeking a distinction. However, certain purchasers, such as Mark Roberts, controversially exploited the right to claim unregistered land.Hansard, 3 February 2004 : Column 204WH, 3 February 2004 : Column 205WH A manorial title (i.e. Lord of the Manor) is not a title of nobility, as in a peerage title. Today Crofton, Yorks Feudal lordships of the manor exist today in English property law, being legal titles historically dating back to the Norman invasion of England in 1066. Being incorporated into property law (whether physical or non-physical) they can be bought and sold, as historic artifacts. The title itself as stated below can be separated from the physical property just as any other right can. Rights like the lordship, mineral and sporting can all be separate from the physical property. The title since 1290 cannot be sub-divided. Land, sporting rights, and mineral rights can be separated. Property lawyers usually handle such transactions. There are three elements to a manor (collectively called an honour): # the lordship or dignity ‚Äì this is the title granted by the manor, # the manorial ‚Äì this is the manor and its land, # the seignory ‚Äì these are the rights granted to the holder of the manor. These three elements may exist separately or be combined, the first element being the title may be held in moieties and may not be subdivided, this is prohibited by the statute of preventing subinfeudation whereas the second and third elements can be subdivided. The Historical Manuscripts Commission maintains two Manorial Document Registers that cover southern England. One register is arranged under parishes, the other is arranged under manors and shows the last-known whereabouts of the manorial records, the records are often very limited. The National Archives at Kew, London and county record offices maintain many documents that mention manors or manorial rights, in some cases manorial court rolls have survived, such documents are now protected by law. The issues of land claims were raised in the UK Parliament in 2004 and were debated with a reply on the subject from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs acknowledging 'need for reform of the remnants of feudal and manorial law' as a case was highlighted in Peterstone Wentloog, Wales, where villagers were being charged excessive fees to cross manorial land to access their homes. In 2007, a caution against first registration caused houses to stop selling in Alstonefield after Mark Roberts, a businessman from Wales also previously involved in the Peterstone Wentloog case, registered a caution against first registration for after purchasing the lordship of the manor of Alstonefield for ¬£10,000 in 1999. Judith Bray, land law expert from Buckingham University, speaking to BBC about the case, said that \\"the legal situation is very confusing because a piece of legislation in the 1920s separated manorial rights from the ownership of land.\\" In reports about the Alstonefield case, the BBC stated, \\"Scores of titles are bought and sold every year, some like the one Chris Eubank bought for fun, others seen as a business opportunity. It is entirely lawful, and there is no doubt the titles can be valuable. As well as rights to land like wastes and commons, they can also give the holder rights over land.\\" The report goes on to say that the Law Commission in England and Wales were considering a project to abolish feudal land law but would not review manorial rights. In many cases, a title of lord of the manor may not have any land or rights, and in such cases the title is known as an 'incorporeal hereditament'. Before the Land Registration Act 2002 it was possible to volunteer to register lordship titles with HM Land Registry; most did not seek to register. Dealings in previously registered Manors are subject to compulsory registration; however, lords of manors may opt to de-register their titles and they will continue to exist unregistered. Manorial rights such as mineral rights ceased to be registerable after midnight on 12 October 2013. A manorial lordship or ladyship is not connected to the British honours system, but rather the feudal system. Ownership of a manorial lordship can be noted on request in British passports through an official observation worded, 'The Holder is the Lord of the Manor of ................'. The feudal title of lord of the manor, unlike titles of peerage, can be inherited by females. In addition, it is the only title that can be purchased. Lordships of the manor are considered non-physical property in England and are fully enforceable in the English court system. Like their English counterparts, by 1600 manorial titles in the formerly Norman territories in France and Italy did not ennoble their holders in the same way as, for example, did a barony. The status of lord of the manor is associated with the rank of esquire by prescription. =Mineral ownership= There were fears in 2014 and earlier, that holders of the manorial rights would allow fracking under the homes and near local communities of people living within the manorial estate after a disclosure that 73,000 applications to assert manorial mineral rights had been received by the land registry. Many of the applications received were from the Duchy of Lancaster and the Duchy of Cornwall asserting their historic \\"manorial mineral ownership\\".
