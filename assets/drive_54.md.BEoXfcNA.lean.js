The film is the sequel to Shebib's 1970 film Goin' Down the Road. Plot Forty years after the events of Goin' Down the Road, Joey has died in Vancouver and Pete ‚Äî who left Toronto with Joey after a violent incident ‚Äî must return to the city to honour Joey's request that his ashes be taken back to Cape Breton Island. Betty-Jo, Joey and Betty's daughter, joins him in the journey, driving cross-Canada in the same 1960 Chevy Impala convertible that Joey and Pete used when they left home in 1970. Adding to the emotion of the trip, the Cape Breton homecoming turns out to be a surprising final gift to Pete from Joey. Pete reconnects with Betty, Selina, a special woman named Annie, and learns about Annie's son, Matt. Cast * Doug McGrath as Pete McGraw * Kathleen Robertson as Betty-Jo Mayle * Anthony Lemke as Matt Burns * Jayne Eastwood as Betty Mayle * Cayle Chernin as Selina * Tedde Moore as Annie Burns * Kristin Adams as Secretary * John Cleland as Sammy * Elva Mai Hoover as Housekeeper Production According to Donald Shebib, until 2007, he had been reluctant to do a sequel to Goin' Down the Road, despite people asking him about it for years. \\"Finally a producer, a different producer than I actually ended up with, offered to try and help put it together. So I thought that if somebody professional was going to try and do it, then let me sit down and try and find a story that makes some sense. And it came together surprisingly easily.\\" According to Jayne Eastwood, Cayle Chernin was a strong advocate convincing director Shebib to make this sequel to his 1970 film. When Chernin was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in June 2010, she chose to forgo standard cancer treatments to stay active enough to reprise her Selina character. Chernin did not tell anyone among the cast or crew that she knew she had terminal cancer when they were filming, though McGrath had his suspicions: \\"She was so thin. There was a frailty I hadn't seen before.\\" Chernin died on 18 February 2011, three months after the project wrapped up in October 2010. =Writing= Shebib considered the script better than the original's. Doug McGrath said that when he first read Shebib's script, \\"it was like reading my own history. I figured Pete had gone through a lot.\\" =Filming= Down the Road Again was shot with a \\"thirty or forty man crew\\". The film was shot in 18 days for \\"just $2 million\\", largely in Toronto, with Cherry Beach serving as the Atlantic Ocean as Joey's ashes are scattered. It was shot in 35mm (unlike the 16mm of the original) with a full crew and a more composed style than the original, which is seen in flashbacks. It was completed in October 2010. Critical response Greg Klymkiw called Down the Road Again \\"a deeply moving and funny sequel that works as a continuation to a movie beloved by so many Canadians, but also works if one has never seen the original.\\" Writing for the National Post, Chris Knight gave the film 3 stars: \\"Down the Road Again isn't all that good, but it is a charming little story provided you don't hold it up against its predecessor,\\" and, as a point of comparison, it \\"isn't on the same level as such where-are-they-nows as Before Sunrise/Before Sunset, but it is an effective story about loves lost, possibilities squandered, and the ability to look the past square in the face and live with it.\\" Stephen Cole gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4: \\"If Shebib's original seemed a draining neighbourhood experience, the 2011 follow-up comes off as canny entertainment. ... Robertson and McGrath enjoy a feisty comic rapport. And the film showcases Shebib's greatest storytelling talent ‚Äì a tender honesty that brings characters alive.\\" He finds some scenes not convincing, \\"including the feel-good ending.\\" Brian Johnson said that the \\"sequel does not recapture the magic\\" of the original, adding \\"How could it?\\", but, speaking of lead McGrath, admired how \\"the wry, wistful resignation of his performance‚Äîintercut with glimpses of the young Pete, dumb and wild with the wind in his hair‚Äîspeaks volumes.\\" Norman Wilner, giving the film the equivalent of 1 star out of 5, branded the film \\"a wheezy, flat and unnecessary follow-up that tries in the clumsiest way imaginable to slap a happy ending on the first film's downbeat story.\\" He thought Kathleen Robertson brought \\"some energy\\", but that \\"Shebib's script is only interested in her symbolic function\\", concluding: \\"it's all such a waste.\\" In a 2018 review, Shaun Lang disagrees that the sequel does not do justice to the original film: \\"Don Shebib and company are more than up to the task,\\" and the film \\"superbly meshes an older generation with a new one.\\" Assigning the film a 7.5/10, he says McGrath is in fine form, and \\"Kathleen Robertson commands her screen time well as McGrath's new onscreen partner\\", conceding \\"it may veer dangerously close to cookie cutter TV-movie territory at times\\".

The company was founded by Walter A. Sheaffer in Fort Madison, Iowa, and incorporated in 1913 State of Iowa, Secretary of State April 21, 1913 Book I-5 page 380 to exploit his invention of a lever-filling fountain pen. The brand was sold by French company Bic to A. T. Cross Company in August, 2014. History In 1912, Walter A. Sheaffer took his idea of a pen-filling apparatus that utilized a lever system and, with his life savings, founded the W.A. Sheaffer Pen Company in Fort Madison, Iowa. The company was established in the backroom of Mr. Sheaffer's jewelry store with seven employees, and was incorporated a year later, in 1913. By the 1930s, Sheaffer fountain pens were being advertised as the pen that \\"fills instantly from any ink-well, with one touch of a finger. Cleans automatically when filling.\\" Sheaffer has manufactured fountain pens down to the present day. The original lever-filler mechanism remained in use through the end of the 1940s, though a sacless plunger design was introduced in the early 1930s. In 1949 Sheaffer adopted the \\"Touchdown\\" pneumatic-filling mechanism for its top-line fountain pens. A development of the Touchdown design was the Snorkel, which added a small extendable tube underneath the nib to avoid the need to dip the nib into ink when operating the filler plunger. The last Snorkel pen was the oversize \\"Pen For Men (PFM),\\" a fat-bodied model introduced in 1959 with the then-new \\"Inlaid Nib\\" which has since featured on all Sheaffer's high-end pens. 1920 advertisement, painted by Coles Phillips All Sheaffer pens after 1959 (excluding the PFM) were designed to accept either ink cartridges or a converter to allow the use of bottled ink. The Targa was a popular high-end model which was introduced in 1976 and came in over 80 different finishes and two sizes (classic and slim). The still very popular Connaisseur pen was introduced in 1986 (using the idiosyncratic spelling as a marketing ploy) as an upgraded version of the low-cost No- Nonsense line that paid homage to earlier Sheaffer flat-tops, and included the high-end Grande series, and three series of Levenger Connoisseur's that were dual branded and sold by Levenger. Another popular Sheaffer fountain pen was the low-cost \\"School Pen\\". Current high-end pens in the range include the Valor and the Legacy series, all of which retain the inlaid nib. On July 31, 1997, Soci√©t√© Bic S.A., known for its Bic pens and lighters, agreed to buy Sheaffer for less than $50 million. Bic, of France, bought Sheaffer from Gefinor S.A., a Geneva-based investment bank, according to Thierry Michels, communications director at Bic. Michels said Bic paid less than the $50 million that Sheaffer had achieved in current annual sales. At the time of the Bic purchase, Sheaffer had 550 employees, 450 of whom were based in North America. In 2003, corporate officials announced their intention of closing Sheaffer's Fort Madison, Iowa, plant after nearly a century of making pens in the southeastern Iowa city. At its peak, the company employed more than 1,000 people in Fort Madison. The shutdown of the factory was completed by the end of March 2008, affecting about 40 workers. Sheaffer's fountain pen point assembly department was moved to a third-party manufacturer in China. Customer service, purchasing, information technology, warehousing and distribution operations, packaging, and quality control were relocated to Slovakia. Bought by BIC in 1997, Sheaffer was sold in August 2014 to the A. T. Cross Company for $15 million (US).Bic dit adieu aux stylos Sheaffer, Challenges, 21 ao√ªt 2014 Products Sheaffer currently manufactures thirteen models of luxury writing instruments, including: Taranis, Legacy Heritage, Prelude, Prelude Mini, Sagaris, Intensity, 500, 300, 200, 100, Stylus, Sentinel, and VFM.http://sheaffer.com/en/writing-instruments As well as writing instruments, Sheaffer also manufactures leather pen pouches and tablet holders, two calligraphy sets, three types of pencil erasers, ballpoint and rollerball refills, stylus refills, Sheaffer converters, eight colors of Skrip bottled ink, Sheaffer Skrip cartridges, and Skrip universal cartridges.http://sheaffer.com/images/warranty/Sheaffer_Refill_Guide2015.pdfhttp://sheaffer.com/en/leather In 2013, Sheaffer launched the Ferrari collection luxury writing instruments.

Accompanying himself on the guitar, Olf documented and preserved Yiddish and Hebrew folk songs, many of which he had heard as a child in Russia. Early years The son of Jacob Olf and Ida Krantz, Mark Olf was born in Bielsk, then a part of the Russian empire near Bialystok and the Belarus border. During the First World War, when Olf was in his early teens, he emigrated with his parents and his brothers, Abraham and Harold, to the United States, where they became naturalized citizens and settled on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Another brother, George, was born in 1922. As a youth, Olf enjoyed exercising police horses on the Coney Island beach, sparring with Golden Gloves boxers and acting in the 2nd Avenue Yiddish theater. He learned automotive trades in his late-teens and, from 1929 to 1937, was the proprietor of an automobile repair and service station at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge.Dates of proprietorship from copy of an application for a Teacher In Training License, Board of Education of the City of New York, December 27, 1937, in family papers. Also in the family papers there is a photograph of Olf standing in front of \\"Olf's Service Station\\" - and one of him exercising a police horse on the beach at Coney Island. When the United States entered the Second World War, Olf served as an instructor of automotive trades to U.S. servicemen. At the time he met his future wife, the pianist Rubia Goldman, he was studying the violin. His avowed artistic interest, however, was playing the guitar and singing Yiddish folk music. The two married in 1938, and Olf launched his career as a folksinger - largely supported by his wife who, after receiving a Graduate Degree in Music Education, taught music for the New York City Board of Education. Rubia Olf also wrote the translations and transliterations for liner notes that accompanied Olf's recordings. Later years and career In the late 1930s, the Olfs moved to Knickerbocker Village on New York City's Lower East Side and had two children, Julian (b. 1942) and Jonathan (b. 1944). Early in the 1950s the family moved to Queens (first Kew Gardens Hills, then Woodside). Olf recorded his first album on the Folkways Records label in 1951. Over the next decade he recorded three albums of Yiddish songs and one of Hebrew songs - in all, fifty-one songs, some of which had not previously been heard in the United States.Smithsonian Folkways Listing for Mark Olf. Folkways Library Journal described his 1960 recording of Yiddish songs for children as \\"warmly sung in the original language\\"; the recording was issued with a booklet of the lyrics, including phonetic renderings of the Yiddish words.Library Journal v. 86, p. 364, 1961 During summers in the 1950s, Olf was the sing leader at the Educational Alliance Surprise Lake Camp, in Cold Spring, New York.

SOIL's efforts have focused on the community-identified priority of increasing access to ecological sanitation, where human wastes are converted into compost. More than 20,000 Haitians are currently using SOIL ecological sanitation toilets.Christine Dell'Amore, \\"Human Waste to Revive Haitian Farmland?\\", The National Geographic, October 26, 2011 Programs Emptying buckets of waste at the SOIL composting facility in Cap-Haitien, January 2014 * EkoLakay.

The service includes toilet rental, the provision of at least one bucket of carbon-based cover material each week, as well as weekly pick up of buckets full of wastes. SOIL designs and builds low-cost ecological sanitation toilets made from locally available materials. The primary design that SOIL builds are called urine diversion, or dry toilets that separate the urine and the feces through the use of a specially designed toilet seat.Nicholas D.

Females are 16‚Äì22 mm in length while males are 11.6‚Äì18.5 mm. Biology Hunting females mainly use vision but antennal chemoreception plays some role. The prey in New Zealand is usually a spider from the family Pisauridae which the wasp pursues until it stops and cowers, when the wasp rushes at it, stinging it twice. When the spider collapses, it has its dorsum up and the wasp then slowly curves its abdomen beneath the spider's prosoma and carefully stabs the prosomal venter, examines the pedipalps, walks over the spider, then stings it a second time on the prosomal venter. After being stung so many times the paralysis is strong; stung spiders do not subsequently recover movement of their legs. The female wasp holds the prey spider by the chelicerae and walks backwards, dragging it dorsum uppermost. When a female carrying prey periodically leaves the spider to inspect its nest, the spider is left exposed, dorsum uppermost, and is temporarily hidden. Nests are made in pre-existing cavities under stones, in cracks in exposed compacted clay, in unmodified clay, and beside stumps, posts, etc. A complete cell and cell- passage is constructed before the female C. australis start to hunt. Paralysed spiders are placed in the cells facing away from the cell entrance. After the female has oviposted on the spider she fills a 20‚Äì27 mm length of the cell- passage with compacted earth. The main burrow of the nest and its external entrance are kept open for the duration the nesting cycle. The males emerge first, 3‚Äì8 days before the females and gather around the nests, often entering them and sometimes assisting the females to hatch before mating with the docile, newly emerged females. After around two days the females commence hunting and may re-use old nests but construct new cells. In New Zealand adults have been seen feeding on Leptospermum scoparium flowers but umbellifers are the favoured flowers for nectaring. Distribution Native to Tasmania and south-eastern Australia, introduced to New Zealand where they are now found from the North Cape to Auckland.

The battle was the third battle taking place between the Cao and Sun clan at Ruxu, but this particular conflict was the only of the three to take place actually during the Three Kingdoms period, as the other two took place in 213 and 217. Background Following the Shu Han defeat at the Battle of Xiaoting, the alliance between Cao Pi and Sun Quan was tested, because the protection the agreement held was no longer needed as the Shu forces reestablished their own relations with the Sun clan. After Sun Deng, the crown prince and eldest son of Sun Quan, was demanded by Cao Pi as hostage, Sun Quan's relations with Wei ultimately plummeted. However, Cao Pi was trying to sour diplomatic relations between the Liu clan and the Sun clan. In November 222, Sun Quan declared himself independent once again from Wei, and Cao Pi responded with force. The plan for Wei was to strike Wu in three different ways along the Yangtze River. Wei generals Xiahou Shang and Cao Zhen attacked Jiangling and Nan Commandery, Cao Xiu and Zang Ba attacked Dongkou, and Cao Ren attacked Ruxu. The battle Cao Ren led a large army against the position but first disseminated false information indicating that he was going to attack Xianxi. The general defending Ruxu, Zhu Huan, took the bait and sent much of his army to Xianxi. After the ploy succeeded, Cao Ren attacked Ruxu. Zhu Huan soon realized his mistake, but there was no time for him to recall his soldiers before Cao Ren attacked. Cao Ren‚Äôs army experienced great success initially and destroyed all of Zhu Huan‚Äôs armies in the field. Zhu Huan had a plan though. He decided to make his army look even smaller than it really was in order to lure Cao Ren out and ambush him. He hid his soldiers in the homes of civilians, struck his banners, and stilled his drums to make the city look almost deserted. Cao Ren believed that Zhu Huan sent nearly all of his men to Xianxi, so he had his son Cao Tai attack the city. He also sent a naval force under Chang Diao, Zhuge Qian, and Wang Shuang to capture a certain island in the river where the families of Zhu Huan‚Äôs officers stayed. Cao Ren himself remained at the rear to offer support. Cao Tai and the others fell right into Zhu Huan‚Äôs trap. Cao Tai attacked the city, thinking it was undefended, and Zhu Huan was able to ambush him with the hidden soldiers and force him to retreat. He also ambushed the naval force sent to the island, killing Chang Diao, capturing Wang Shuang and dealing heavy losses to the Wei army. This earned Zhu Huan a brief respite, during which time he was able to recall his soldiers. Cao Ren now personally took command of the siege and attacked Ruxu, but Zhu Huan was able to regroup his soldiers and defend the city. After several months of furious battle, disease and loss took enough of a toll on the Wei army that Cao Pi decided to order Cao Ren to retreat. Aftermath Cao Ren died after the battle ended in 223.

The ratio is that of the static permittivity \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{st}} to the permittivity for frequencies in the visible range \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\infty}. }{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\infty}} cellpadding border border colour = #50C878 background colour = #ECFCF4}} The Lyddane‚ÄìSachs‚ÄìTeller relation is named after the physicists R. H. Lyddane, Robert G. Sachs, and Edward Teller. Phonon band structure in GaAs. The separation between LO and TO phonon frequencies near the Œì-point (small wave vectors) is described by the LST relation. Note this plot shows much higher wavevectors than considered below, and the scale cannot not show the hybridization of the TO branch with light (which would be confined extremely close to Œì). Origin and limitations The Lyddane‚ÄìSachs‚ÄìTeller relation applies to optical lattice vibrations that have an associated net polarization density, so that they can produce long ranged electromagnetic fields (over ranges much longer than the inter-atom distances). The relation assumes an idealized polar (\\"infrared active\\") optical lattice vibration that gives a contribution to the frequency-dependent permittivity described by a lossless Lorentzian oscillator: : \\\\varepsilon(\\\\omega) = \\\\varepsilon(\\\\infty) + S \\\\frac{\\\\omega_\\\\text{TO}^2}{\\\\omega^2 - \\\\omega_\\\\text{TO}^2}, where \\\\varepsilon(\\\\infty) is the permittivity at high frequencies, S is the static polarizability of the optical lattice mode, and \\\\omega_\\\\text{TO} is the \\"natural\\" oscillation frequency of the lattice vibration taking into account only the short-ranged (microscopic) restoring forces. Dispersion relation of phonon polaritons in GaP. Red curves are the uncoupled phonon and photon dispersion relations, black curves are the result of coupling (from top to bottom: upper polariton, LO phonon, lower polariton). The LST relation relates the frequencies of the horizontal red curve (\\\\omega_\\\\text{TO}) and the black curve intercept at k=0 (\\\\omega_\\\\text{LO}). The above equation can be plugged into Maxwell's equations to find the complete set of normal modes including all restoring forces (short-ranged and long-ranged), which are sometimes called phonon polaritons. These modes are plotted in the figure. At every wavevector there are three distinct modes: * a longitudinal wave mode occurs with an essentially flat dispersion at frequency \\\\omega_\\\\text{LO}. :* In this mode, the electric field is parallel to the wavevector and produces no transverse currents, hence it is purely electric (there is no associated magnetic field). :* The longitudinal wave is basically dispersionless, and appears as a flat line in the plot at frequency \\\\omega_\\\\text{LO}. This remains 'split off' from the bare oscillation frequency even at high wave vectors, because the importance of electric restoring forces does not diminish at high wavevectors. * two transverse wave modes appear (actually, four modes, in pairs with identical dispersion), with complex dispersion behavior. :* In these modes, the electric field is perpendicular to the wavevector, producing transverse currents, which in turn generate magnetic fields. As light is also a transverse electromagnetic wave, the behaviour is described as a coupling of the transverse vibration modes with the light inside the material (in the figure, shown as red dashed lines). :* At high wavevectors, the lower mode is primarily vibrational. This mode approaches the 'bare' frequency \\\\omega_\\\\text{TO} because magnetic restoring forces can be neglected: the transverse currents produce a small magnetic field and the magnetically induced electric field is also very small. :* At zero, or low wavevector the _upper_ mode is primarily vibrational and its frequency instead coincides with the longitudinal mode, with frequency \\\\omega_\\\\text{LO}. This coincidence is required by symmetry considerations and occurs due to electrodynamic retardation effects that make the transverse magnetic back-action behave identically to the longitudinal electric back-action. The longitudinal mode appears at the frequency where the permittivity passes through zero, i.e. \\\\varepsilon(\\\\omega_\\\\text{LO}) = 0. Solving this for the Lorentzian resonance described above gives the Lyddane‚ÄìSachs‚ÄìTeller relation. Since the Lyddane‚ÄìSachs‚ÄìTeller relation is derived from the lossless Lorentzian oscillator, it may break down in realistic materials where the permittivity function is more complicated for various reasons: * Real phonons have losses (also known as damping or dissipation). * Materials may have multiple phonon resonances that add together to produce the permittivity. * There may be other electrically active degrees of freedom (notably, mobile electrons) and non- Lorentzian oscillators. In the case of multiple, lossy Lorentzian oscillators, there are generalized Lyddane‚ÄìSachs‚ÄìTeller relations available. Most generally, the permittivity cannot be described as a combination of Lorentizan oscillators, and the longitudinal mode frequency can only be found as a complex zero in the permittivity function. Non-polar crystals A corollary of the LST relation is that for non-polar crystals, the LO and TO phonon modes are degenerate, and thus \\\\varepsilon_\\\\text{st}=\\\\varepsilon_\\\\infty. This indeed holds for the purely covalent crystals of the group IV elements, such as for diamond (C), silicon, and germanium. Reststrahlen effect In the frequencies between \\\\omega_\\\\text{TO} and \\\\omega_\\\\text{LO} there is 100% reflectivity. This range of frequencies (band) is called the Reststrahl band. The name derives from the German reststrahl which means \\"residual ray\\". Example with NaCl The static and high-frequency dielectric constants of NaCl are \\\\varepsilon_\\\\text{st}=5.9 and \\\\varepsilon_\\\\infty=2.25, and the TO phonon frequency u_\\\\text{TO} is 4.9 THz. Using the LST relation, we are able to calculate that ::: u_\\\\text{LO}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\varepsilon_\\\\text{st}/\\\\varepsilon_\\\\infty}\\\\times u_\\\\text{TO}=7.9 THz Experimental methods =Raman spectroscopy= One of the ways to experimentally determine \\\\omega_\\\\text{TO} and \\\\omega_\\\\text{LO} is through Raman spectroscopy. As previously mentioned, the phonon frequencies used in the LST relation are those corresponding to the TO and LO branches evaluated at the gamma-point (k=0) of the Brillouin zone. This is also the point where the photon-phonon coupling most often occurs for the Stokes shift measured in Raman. Hence two peaks will be present in the Raman spectrum, each corresponding to the TO and LO phonon frequency.

The essay dissects the nature of the communist regime of the time, life within such a regime and how by their very nature such regimes can create dissidents of ordinary citizens. The essay goes on to discuss ideas and possible actions by loose communities of individuals linked by a common cause, such as Charter 77. Officially suppressed, the essay was circulated in samizdat form and translated into multiple languages. It became a manifesto for dissent in Czechoslovakia, Poland and other communist regimes. Background Under the communist regime in Czechoslovakia, there was an omnipresent pressure exerted by the political apparatus on culture. Various methods were utilized to pressure citizens into compliance. Havel's philosophical mentor, Jan Patoƒçka, who was also the co-spokesman of the human rights petition, Charter 77, died of a stroke in March 1977, after an eleven- hour interrogation by the Czechoslovak secret police regarding his involvement in the Charter. After the launch of Charter 77, which coincided with the release of The Power of the Powerless, Havel was put under continuous pressure by the secret police. He was under constant government surveillance and they interrogated him almost daily. When he didn't cave, Havel was imprisoned.Keane; p. 254. He was arrested in May 1979 and remained imprisoned until February 1983. Genesis and publication history The Power of the Powerless was originally written by Havel in October 1978. It had its genesis in a planned book of Polish and Czechoslovak essays on the nature of freedom. Each of the contributors was to have received a copy of Havel's essay and then to respond to it. However only the individual Czechoslovak essays were \\"published\\" and distributed in samizdat form in 1979 after Havel was arrested along with other members of the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted (V√Ωbor na obranu nespravedlivƒõ st√≠han√Ωch or VONS); an organization that Havel co-founded in 1979. An English translation by Paul Wilson was published in 1985 in a volume of essays edited by John Keane.(See ) Content The topic of how best to resist a totalitarian system occupied Havel's mind after the launch of Charter 77. This became the crux of his essay, which was one of the most \\"original and compelling pieces of political writing\\" to come out of the Eastern Bloc.Keane; p. 268. Dedicated to the memory of Jan Patoƒçka, the opening section of the essay sought to explain what Charter 77 signified to those living within Czechoslovakia, and \\"to give courage\\" to fellow opponents of the Soviet bloc elsewhere. = Life in a \\"post-totalitarian\\" system = Havel coined the term \\"post-totalitarian\\" for this essay, writing, \\"I do not wish to imply by the prefix \\"post-\\" that the system is no longer totalitarian; on the contrary, I mean that it is totalitarian in a way fundamentally different from classical dictatorships...\\" Havel biographer, John Keane, describes Havel's definition of a post- totalitarian world: \\"Within the system, every individual is trapped within a dense network of the state's governing instruments...themselves legitimated by a flexible but comprehensive ideology, a 'secularized religion'...it is therefore necessary to see, argued Havel, that power relations...are best described as a labyrinth of influence, repression, fear and self-censorship which swallows up everyone within it, at the very least by rendering them silent, stultified and marked by some undesirable prejudices of the powerful...\\"Keane; p. 273-274. = Havel's greengrocer = Havel uses the example of a greengrocer who displays in his shop the sign Workers of the world, unite!. Since failure to display the sign could be seen as disloyalty, he displays it and the sign becomes not a symbol of his enthusiasm for the regime, but a symbol of both his submission to it and humiliation by it. Havel returns repeatedly to this motif to show the contradictions between the \\"intentions of life\\" and the \\"intentions of systems\\", i.e. between the individual and the state, in a totalitarian society. An individual living within such a system must live a lie, to hide that which he truly believes and desires, and to do that which he must do to be left in peace and to survive. This is comparable to the classical tale of \\"The Emperor's New Clothes.\\" > ...they must live within a lie. They need not accept the lie. It is enough > for them to have accepted their life with it and in it. For by this very > fact, individuals confirm the system, fulfill the system, make the system, > are the system. Individuals at each level within the bureaucracy must display their own equivalent of the grocer's Workers of the world, unite! sign, oppressing those below them and in turn oppressed by those above. Against this public lie is contrasted a life lived in truth, a title suggested by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and his essay Live Not By Lies. Havel argued that the restoration of a free society could only be achieved through a paradigm based on the individual, \\"human existence,\\" and a fundamental reconstitution of one's \\"respect for self, for others and for the universe\\"; to refuse to give power to empty slogans and meaningless rituals, to refuse to allow the lie to oppress oneself, and to refuse to be part of the lie that oppresses others. By doing so individuals illuminate their surroundings revealing to others that they have power. = Overcoming powerlessness = Havel proposes that the oppressed always contain \\"within themselves the power to remedy their own powerlessness...\\"Keane; p. 269. Havel argued that by an individual \\"living in truth\\" in their daily life they automatically differentiate themselves from the officially mandated culture prescribed by the State; since power is only effective inasmuch as citizens are willing to submit to it.Keane; p. 270. Havel explained step-by-step that the powerlessness of the powerful is traceable to several factors: Those who rule at the top of the pyramid are fundamentally incapable of controlling every aspect of an individual citizen's life despite their best efforts to do so. And those in petty power positions all the way down the line perform the prescribed rituals mandated by the State yet it is this blind obedience which in turn tends to dull the perceptions of the leaders at the top ‚Äî inadvertently opening space for those who wish not to conform.Keane; p. 271-272. Official power is further eroded by the ideological rituals that the entire power structure depend on, and \\"that are ever less credible, exactly because they are untested by public discussion and controversy\\". Havel argued that the part of a human being that yearns for freedom, truth, and self-dignity can never be fully repressed.Keane; p. 272. Havel echoed Patoƒçka's sentiment that no matter what the situation, individuals carry responsibility with them. Therefore it is possible to not allow oneself to be humiliated by superiors anymore, or intimidated by the secret police. Havel argued that this oppression can never be universal even if a single person doesn't give it power over themself. Havel felt that all that is suffered over time under such systems often leads to deeper reflection: \\"There are times, when we must sink to the bottom of our misery to understand truth, just as we must descend to the bottom of a well to see the stars in broad daylight.\\" Havel wrote that \\"living in truth\\" meant rejecting the notion that power is something to be grasped or abolished. Havel instead argues that power is relational.Keane; p. 273. Havel said the written laws in the East and West are pretty similar. The difference is in their administration. \\"Demanding that the laws be upheld ... threatens the whole mendacious structure at its point of maximum mendacity.\\" People were \\"easily and inconspicuously locked up for copying banned books\\". However, \\"policemen, prosecutors, or judges ... exposed to public attention ... suddenly and anxiously begin to take particular care that no cracks appear in the [legal] ritual.\\"Havel et al. (1985, pp. 75-77) = Forms of opposition to the regime = In later sections, Havel writes of what form opposition in such regimes could take and the nature of being a dissident in the circumstances of the time, using the example of Charter 77. Havel's political program being a breaking with both the traditional forms of governing and opposition. He contrasts Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk's observation of the limits of grassroots organization, of so-called small works, with the example of the Polish Workers' Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Robotnik√≥w or 'KOR) and of what could be achieved through an independent social life and organization to achieve \\"social self-defense\\". Such a defense throughout the then Eastern Bloc having as its basis the defense of human and civil rights. Havel touches upon the concepts articulated by fellow dissident and Charter 77 signatory, V√°clav Benda, who had earlier described \\"parallel structures\\" of \\"parallel institutions\\" within a society more responsive to human needs. He points out that the first person in Czechoslovakia to formulate and put into practice a concept of a \\"second culture\\" was Ivan Martin Jirous; although Jirous was mainly referring to events such as rock music concerts. = Towards a \\"post- democratic\\" system = Havel concludes the essay with a discussion about democracy and the problems of technology. He rejects the view that the only answer to a post-totalitarian regime would be to establish parliamentary democracy. \\"To cling to the notion\\", he writes, \\"of traditional parliamentary democracy as one‚Äôs political ideal and to succumb to the illusion that only this tried and true form is capable of guaranteeing human beings enduring dignity and an independent role in society would, in my opinion, be at the very least shortsighted.\\"Keane; p. 285. He calls for an \\"existential revolution\\" that goes \\"significantly beyond the framework of classical parliamentary democracy\\" and that can thus be called post-democratic. \\"Having introduced the term 'posttotalitarian' for the purposes of this discussion, perhaps I should refer to the notion I have just outlined - purely for the moment - as the prospects for a 'post-democratic' system.\\" The post-democratic system he envisages should \\"provide hope of a moral reconstitution of society, which means a radical renewal of the relationship of human beings to what I have called the 'human order,' which no political order can replace. A new experience of being, a renewed rootedness in the universe, a newly grasped sense of higher responsibility, a newfound inner relationship to other people and to the human community-these factors clearly indicate the direction in which we must go.\\"Keane; p. 283. Impact After the fall of the communist regimes of central-eastern Europe in 1989, which included the Fall of the Berlin Wall and Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution, observers hearkened back to the writings of dissidents who had dissected the inherent weaknesses in the political regimes. Solidarity activist Zbigniew Bujak said of the essay, \\"When I look at the victories of Solidarity, and of Charter 77, I see in them an astonishing fulfillment of the prophecies and knowledge contained in Havel's essay.\\" And the author of this essay, V√°clav Havel, was elected as the first and only president of the post-Soviet Czechoslovakia and then the first president of the Czech Republic after dissolution.

History Reed's candy was produced in the United States for over 100 years. The Reed's Candy Company is an American producer of confectionery, which was started by William and Eugene Reed of Chicago. Together with their father, they founded the company in 1893 for the production and sale of butterscotch candies. Reed's candy ad from 1968 They expanded the candy line with their top selling product, the hard candy roll. The cooking process consisted of using copper kettles to boil butter, corn syrup and other ingredients to create an individually hard finished candy. Machinery was custom made to allow the product to go from the cooking phase directly into packaging. The pieces were packaged eight to a roll, with a cellophane button-wrapper to protect freshness. By 1921, the firm had become the largest manufacturer of butterscotch candy in the United States. Other flavors included peppermint, root beer, licorice, cinnamon, spearmint, butter rum, and teaberry. Lorillard Company purchased Reed's Candy in 1962, and operated it as a subsidiary. When Lorillard was bought by Loews Theatres, Inc several years later, Reed's Candy became a subsidiary of Loews. In February 1972, Loews Corporation decided to concentrate only in the entertainment industry, and sold Reed's to H.P. Hood, Inc. Reed's acquired Clark Gum in 1973.

Museus i Centres de Patrimoni Cultural a Catalunya. Barcelona: Departament de Cultura de la Generalitat de Catalunya, 2010, p. 28. . Created in 1932, this historic museum contains a rich and diverse collection of European decorative arts, from the Middle Ages to the Industrial Revolution. In 1995, the museum extended its boundaries with the incorporation of design, thus converting it into the first and only statewide museum concerned with the preservation and exhibition of Spanish industrial design. The collections of the Museu de les Arts Decoratives were created from an important resource of industrial design and decorative art objects, that included salvers, carriages, furniture, wallpaper, clocks, tapestries and glasswork. Together with Museu T√®xtil i d'Indument√†ria and the Gabinet de les Arts Gr√†fiques is part of the Disseny Hub Barcelona.  Palau Reial de Pedralbes  Palau Reial de Pedralbes The palace has its origins in the old Masia (mas or farmer's house) de Can Feliu, from the 17th century.Jardins del Palau de Pedralbes The corresponding land was acquired by the count Eusebi G√ºell, along with the neighbouring Can Cui√†s de la Riera. Together they formed the Finca G√ºell, an extensive parcel of land (30,000 m2). The Can Feliu building was remodeled by the architect Joan Martorell i Montells, who built a Caribbean-style small palace, together with a Gothic-style chapel and surrounded by magnificent gardens. Later the building remodeling was given to Antoni Gaud√≠, together with the construction of a surrounding perimeter wall and the side entry pavilions. Gaud√≠ also partially designed the gardens surrounding the palace, placing two fountains and a pergola and planted many Mediterranean plants like palm trees, cypress trees, magnolias, pine trees and eucalyptus. The Font d'H√©rcules (Hercules fountain) still exists today on site, restored in 1983;Font H√©rcules by Gaud√≠ it has a bust of Hercules on top of a pillar with Catalonia's shield and a spout in the shape of a Chinese dragon. In the Palau Reial de Pedralbes (Diagonal, 686) are placed the DHUB Museums, and you can visit the permanent exhibitions of Museu T√®xtil i d'Indument√†ria and a permanent exhibition of the Museu de les Arts DecorativesDHUB Museums which later will be passed to the building of Gl√≤ries.  History  The museum opened in 1932 at the Palau Reial de Pedralbes. Its origin, however, dates back to 1888, following the Exposition held in Barcelona. Upon completion of this event, the city council thought of bringing together different collections of cultural and museum open several centers.museos/museo-de-las- artes-decorativas DHUB, Museo de las Artes Decorativas Thus, in 1902 created the Museu d'Art Decoratiu i Arqueol√≤gic in the old arsenal of the Ciutadella, consisting of a set of heterogeneous collections. The Barcelona architect and councilor at the time, Josep Puig, designed and planned the museum at all levels, from assembly to the windows museofr√†fic containing objects.Garc√≠a i Sastre, Andrea.

Barcelona: Publications de l'Abadia de Montserrat, 1997, p. 418. .Museu T√®xtil i d'Indument√†ria at Disseny Hub Barcelona In 1932, the Museum of Decorative Art and Archaeological underwent a complete restructuring and was dismantled. The collections were moved to Montju√Øc to constitute, on the one hand, the National Art Museum of Catalonia and the other, the Museum of Archaeology of Catalonia. Objects not included either in the category of Fine Arts or the archaeological material, were taken to the Palace of Pedralbes by decision of the Junta de Museus, a board decision committee, thus forming the current Museum Decorative Arts. In 1936, with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the museum was closed and moved his background in Olot to ensure its protection during the conflict. After the war, the Pedralbes Palace became the residence of Barcelona's new head of state, Francisco Franco Bahamonde, so that the Museum of Decorative Arts lost his seat. In 1949, the museum reopened in a new location, the Palace Virreina, which organized the exhibition spaces in a similar way as they were in the previous location. During this period, the museum collection grew considerably with the addition of various collections, as the lot of furniture from the collection of Matias Muntadas, or furniture work of Francesc Vidal from the collection Bertrand i Mata. In 1985, however, it was decided a new municipal use for Virreina and the Museum of Decorative Arts had to shut the doors again. The collections were moved back to the Palace of Pedralbes and stored in this building reserves for a decade. In 1995, the museum reopened to the public, recovering the exhibition spaces of the Palace of Pedralbes and incorporating as an important new collection of industrial design Spanish. Currently, the Museum of Decorative Arts in Pedralbes share its location with Museu T√®xtil i d'Indument√†ria and the Gabinet de les Arts Gr√†fiques, an office of Graphic Arts, with which it forms part of the Disseny Hub Barcelona. These collections are expected to move to a new headquarters being built in the Pla√ßa de les Gl√≤ries of Barcelona.  Exhibits  ; From the One-off Object to Product Design The permanent exhibition of the Museu de les Arts Decoratives presents a chronological itinerary in two parts. The first part demonstrates the evolution of objets d'art from the Romanesque to Romanticism, and with an emphasis on Catalan production, it also shows the birth of product design during the Industrial Revolution in Occidental Europe. The majority of objects in the exhibition were designed for personal use and as such, have been presented in a way that illustrates everyday life and production processes (both artisanal and industrial), from the 19th century onward. At the museum, you will find furniture from wealthy, affluent homes, including wedding chests, beds, chairs and vanities, as well as a variety of common-use objects such as tableware, fans and watches. The second part of the exhibit focuses on the development of product design, with the presentation of 442 pieces that form a representative sample of industrial design in Spain. Conceptually the exhibition follows the journey of a designed product by socially contextualizing it in Barcelona, specifically and more generally throughout Spain.From the One-off Object to Product Design  References   Further reading  A Guide to the Museums of Catalonia.

It was formed on 12 March 1920, and included the clubs from the geographical territories of Vojvodina, Central Serbia, Old Serbia (Kosovo) and South Serbia (Macedonia). The increase of number of clubs made that progressively other subassociations become formed by separating them from Belgrade's one. By 1932 its territory included beside Belgrade metropolitan area only the districts of Kolubara, Braniƒçevo, Podunavlje and Jasenica-Kosmaj.Milorad Sijiƒá: \\"Football in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia\\" , pags. 135-140 Its main role was to organise and control the league competition which consisted in interconnected leagues in a hierarchical format with promotion and relegation between leagues at different levels. At the top of the hierarchy was the First Division of the BLP (1. razred BLP / 1. —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–µ–¥ –ë–ü–õ), often known simply as Belgrade Football Subassociation League and the winner had direct access to the Yugoslav Championship while the second placed had to play a qualifying round. The Second and Third Divisions were divided in groups.Monografija 85. godina SD ƒåukariƒçki pag. 46 History Before the formation of the BLP, football clubs in Serbia lacked an organised competition and limited to play friendly or exhibition matches. Occasionally, tournaments were organised in major urban centers. Football was characterised as an amateur leisure activity. The formation of BLP joined a number of willingfull and passionate people who will improve the management and organisation of football in Serbia, turning it into a more developed and professionalised activity. This greatly contributed for the mass popularisation of football and the quality gap that existed in comparison to other footballistically more developed countries started to be diminish. In a relatively brief period, football went from being a marginal students leisure activity to become the most popular sports activity in the country. The press passed from an attitude of total ignorance towards full coverage, and most important, it became subject of interest from the lowest working and peasantry classes, to the Belgrade high society, with the royal family itself frequently attending the most important matches. However at beginning it was the individuals with their own initiative and good-will that mostly contributed to the development of the clubs and the competition. The first president of the BLP was Dragutin Kostiƒá. In 1921 he is replaced by ≈Ωika Simonoviƒá.Sijiƒá, pag. 135 That year the subassociation counted with only 66 clubs, 19 of which in the city of Belgrade itself, 9 in the district (≈æupa - administrative unit) of Banat, 3 in Brƒçko, 4 in Bijeljina, 4 in Leskovac, 3 in Vranje, 2 in Skoplje, 3 in Zemun, 1 in ≈†abac, 2 in Sremska Mitrovica, 2 in U≈æice, 1 in Po≈æega, 1 in Jagodina, 2 in ƒåaƒçak, 1 in Ruma, 1 in Negotin, 1 in Kru≈°evac and 1 in Veles.Sijiƒá, pag. 136 In the third general assembly hold that year, it was decided that Politika would become the official media of the BLP.Sijiƒá, pag. 136 The conference from 15 January 1922 was marked by the decision to strengthen the relations with the peripheral provincial clubs, and the territory was divided among ≈Ωupa's, administrative units corresponding in English language to parishes or districts.Sijiƒá, pag. 136 In the general assembly held on 2 July 1922, a new administration was elected with Danilo Stojanoviƒá, popularly named as ƒåika Daƒça (Unckle Dacha) as its president.Sijiƒá, pag. 137 As one of the pioneers of football in Serbia and the founder of a number of clubs, he was highly regarded for that position. However, in the fourth general assembly held on 31 December 1922 the administration headed by Janko ≈†afarik is elected with him becoming the new president.Sijiƒá, pg. 137 The BLP was steadily growing and in 1923 it counted two main leagues, the First League of BLP (1. razred BLP) and Second League of BLP (2. razred BLP), and the leagues of the districts (≈æupa's) which were 12, some counting 2 levels, a and b: Belgrade, Banat (a and b), Posavina, Bosnia, Kolubara, ≈†umadija, Krajina, Jelica, Morava and Skoplje.Sijiƒá, pg. 138 In 1925, Mata Miodragoviƒá was elected president in a general assembly held on 17 August 1925. The assembly unilaterally declared the support for the seat of the Football Association of Yugoslavia to be moved from Zagreb to Belgrade. In 1926 Zarija Markoviƒá was elected president and will stay until 1929 when Svetislav ≈Ωivkoviƒá replaced him. Milan Bogdanoviƒá would be elected in 1931 and a year later Dimitrije Bojiƒá will take his place.Sijiƒá, pag. 139 In 1933 Milan Bogdanoviƒá retook his position, and in 1934 Bojiƒá succeeded him once again. This period was marked by the leadership of people well familiarised with the needs and problems of the organisation, so it is not unusual to see presidents being reelected or returning to the leadership position, as happened with Svetislav ≈Ωivkoviƒá who was president between 1929 and 1931 and was elected again in 1936. Jovan Spasojeviƒá, a physician by profession, took control in July 1937, and he was re-elected twice, in 1938 and 1940.Sijiƒá, pag. 140 Creation of further Subassociations With the development and expansion of football, its proliferation into provincial areas, the increase of competitions and the growing number of new clubs, a number of new subassociations was created within the initial territory of the Belgrade Football Subassociation. *The Skoplje Football Subassociation was formed on 18 December 1926 and included most of the territory which was by then known as the Southern and Old Serbia, namely the clubs from the districts of Skoplje, Bregalnica, Bitola, Kosovo and Vranje.Sijiƒá, pag. 142 *The Novi Sad Football Subassociation was formed on 13 April 1930 and included the clubs from the districts of Novi Sad, Sremska Mitrovica, Ruma and ≈†abac.Sijiƒá, pag. 142 *The Veliki Beƒçkerek Football Subassociation was formed on 11 May 1930 and included the clubs from the district of Banat including the municipalities of Veliki Beƒçkerek (city was renamed to Petrovgrad in 1935, known as Zrenjanin nowadays), Vr≈°ac, Kikinda, Novi Beƒçej and Panƒçevo.Sijiƒá, pag. 143 *The Ni≈° Football Subassociation was formed on 8 March 1931 and included much of the territory of the Morava district. Includes the clubs from the municipalities of Ni≈°, Kru≈°evac, Zajeƒçar, Negotin, Bor, Knja≈æevac and Leskovac, which was part of the Skoplje subassociation.Sijiƒá, pag. 142 *The Kragujevac Football Subassociation was formed on 20 December 1931 and included the clubs from the former province of ≈†umadija, which included the municipalities of Kragujevac, Kraljevo and Jagodina, and in 1933 they are joined by the clubs of the municipalities of ƒåaƒçak and U≈æice which were part of the Sarajevo Subassociation until then.Sijiƒá, pag. 146 BLP First Division The first edition was played in 1920 and the first two editions were colloquially known as the Serbian Championship's.Yugoslavia/Serbia (and Montenegro) - List of Champions at RSSSF Until 1927 the champion gets automatically qualified to the Yugoslav Championship, but since that year, the second placed teams of the leagues of Belgrade and Zagreb also get a chance to play on the national highest level by participating in one elimination round. By the mid 1930s the league system suffered numerous alterations, often on a year-to-year basis, however since then the subassociation leagues became a way for clubs to qualify to a group phase which was the intermediate level to reach the national top level, although the BLP and Zagreb champions still qualified directly. By the late 1930s the clubs playing in the Yugoslav Championship did not played any more in the Subassociation leagues. In 1939 the league system is modified in a way that it is introduced the Serbian League, an intermediate level between the BLP and the Yugoslav Championship. After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941 and the creation by the occupying German authorities of the puppet Serbian state the Serbian League will become the top-level league during the Second World War in Serbia, having its last edition in 1944. The Serbian League was organised by the Belgrade Football Subassociation. =Seasons and champions= *1920:Serbia 1919/20 at RSSSF 1st - BSK Belgrade *1921:Serbia 1920/21 at RSSSF 1st - BSK Belgrade *1923:Sijiƒá, pag. 50 1st - SK Jugoslavija *1924:Sijiƒá, pag. 51 1st - SK Jugoslavija *1925:Sijiƒá, pag. 52 1st - SK Jugoslavija *1926:Sijiƒá, pag. 54 1st - SK Jugoslavija *1927:Sijiƒá, pag. 55 1st - BSK Belgrade; 2nd - SK Jugoslavija *1928:Sijiƒá, pag. 57 1st - SK Jugoslavija; 2nd - BSK Belgrade *1929:Sijiƒá, pag. 60 1st - BSK Belgrade; 2nd - SK Jugoslavija *1930:Sijiƒá, pag. 65 1st - BSK Belgrade; 2nd - SK Jugoslavija *1931:Sijiƒá, pag. 68 The season was not finished as the entire league system modified.Monografija 85. godina SD ƒåukariƒçki pag. 47 *1932:Sijiƒá, pag. 74 1st - SK Jugoslavija; 2nd - BSK Belgrade; 3rd - BASK; Provincial champion: Sparta Zemun.

At the time the press referred to their matches as the Eternal derby. During most of the period when the football season was divided into two halves, the first one being played on subassociation level and the second half at the national one, the BLP League usually served for BSK and Jugoslavija to measure strength between them, although the derby matches would repeat themselves as both usually took place at the national level. There they would face another aspect of Yugoslav football of the era, the equally fierce rivalry between the Belgrade teams and those from Zagreb. Those were usually the championship deciding matches. Legacy and aftermath At the end of the Second World War the monarchy was abolished and the country became a federal people's republic, FPRY. The entire football system was restructured. The sub- associations ceased to exist and they gave place to the republics, one of six federal units, associations, although same as before, all of them were under the national Yugoslav Football Association (FSJ). Numerous clubs were disbanded, mostly the ones which had a monarchic or bourgeois connotations, among them Jugoslavija and BSK. SK Jugoslavija was completely disbanded with most of its property and players, including the field, handed over to the newly formed Red Star Belgrade, while BSK, although initially also disbanded, it ended being restored as OFK Beograd, a medium-small size club with obviously lower ambitions than BSK, and even so their right to assume and claim the continuity was only accepted after the socialist regime ended. The BSK vs Jugoslavija derby was succeeded by an equally intense Partizan vs Red Star Eternal derby.

Marve remained separate from the mainland Salsette till as late as 1808, while by the year 1882, access to the island was possible by merely walking across the tidal inlets during low tide. Rapid urbanisation on Salsette island has resulted in the formation of dry land between Marve and Salsette. Marve is now connected to the mainland by a causeway that is part of the Malad - Marve road and to Madh island via a small bridge over a creek at Marve's southern tip. The Manori Creek flows into the Arabian sea at the northern tip of Marve. Ferry services to Manori operate from Marve Beach. Further south along the western coast lies Aksa Beach. The beach though popular with tourists is not safe for swimming due to the swift currents caused by the creek flowing into the sea resulting in several cases of drownings. The Resort, a Five Star hotel, is located at Aksa on the Madh- Marve road. The Indian Navy operates a Logistics Training establishment called INS Hamla on Marve. Access to a section of beach adjoining the naval premises is restricted for civilians. The Defence School Kendriya Vidyalaya at INS Hamla, was established in August 1972.

It is known for its parasitic predation and damage to sheep, deer, goats and sometimes cattle. There have also been many records of horse, dog and human infestation. In some areas of the world it is a significant pest which affects the agricultural economy. Description The adult fly is a bee-like insect about 10 to 12 millimetres (3/8‚Äì¬Ω inches) long, slightly hairy with a banded, dark grey body and dull yellow head and legs. It is widely distributed across the world wherever sheep, deer and goats are found. This includes North America, Central America, the area round the Mediterranean Sea, The Middle East, Australia, Brazil and South Africa. Incidence of the fly in northern Europe has decreased in recent years. Life cycle Immature and mature larvae of the sheep bot fly Sheep bot flies commence life as eggs within the female which are fertilised and hatch to larvae of 1 mm within the body of the female. The female then deposits a few larvae, while on the wing, within a tiny mucous drop, directly into a nostril of the host animal. The larvae then make their way up the nasal passage in the mucosa and enter a nasal sinus. During this time it will develop, grow and moult into a second larval stage or instar. It then continues to develop up to 20mm (approximately 4/5 inch) in length with a dark stripe across each segment. When the larva is fully developed it moves down the nasal passage and drops to the ground where it buries itself and pupates. The length of time the larva takes to mature depends on the ambient temperature. This may be 25‚Äì35 days in warm weather but up to 10 months in colder climates. The pupa takes from 3‚Äì9 weeks to mature, again dependent on climatic conditions, after which the adult burrows up to the surface, takes to the wing and commences mating. The adults do not feed during their 2‚Äì4 weeks of adult life though they may take water. Effects on livestock Sheep are the principal hosts. The presence of the fly with its distinctive buzzing can alert mature animals who may attempt to run away, walk with their noses near the ground or have been recorded forming a circle with their noses in the middle and near the ground. If the fly successfully places eggs in the nostril of sheep the animal may feel the larvae after a few days and attempt to remove them by tapping their muzzles on the ground. They will also snort and stamp their front feet in annoyance. Once the larvae have infested the nasal passage and sinuses, usually up to 15 larvae but can be up to 80, they cause irritation to the mucosa, which causes mucous discharge, swelling of the internal membranes of the nose, possibly impairment of breathing but largely discomfort and distraction to the sheep who may reduce or stop grazing and subsequently lose weight and condition. This can in some cases lead to malnutrition and death Sometimes mature larvae are unable to escape from the nasal sinus and die. This may then lead to a septic sinusitis affecting the animal's condition. and the possibility of death from general septicaemia. Control of infestation In developed countries sheep and other domestic animals can be given preventative medication in the form of drenches. These have a variable effect because reinfestation from neighbouring territory is common. In isolated flocks of animals control can be more effective. Human infestation There have been widespread reports of human infestation going back over decades, and probably centuries. Most commonly they are shepherds living in close proximity to the sheep but there are records of hapless visitors being subject to infestation and carrying the parasites home to their native country. The effects can usually be treated easily with medical attention or medication.

It was established by the survivors of the wreck of the Captain Lincoln, a U.S. transport schooner, on January 3, 1852. The ship began taking on water during a storm while en route from San Francisco to Fort Orford at the town of Port Orford. To avoid sinking, the captain decided to beach the ship north of Cape Arago. All of the roughly 30 troops (U.S. 1st Dragoons, Company C, predecessors to the U.S. Cavalry) on board, and the ship's crew, survived the wreck and most of the cargo was salvaged. At the time no U.S. settlement was present at Coos Bay, so commanding officer Lt. Henry Stanton decided to establish the camp to protect the cargo until it could be transported to Fort Orford, some 50 miles south on the Oregon Coast. The troops and crew used spars, booms and sail cloth from the schooner to build tent structures for housing and for protecting the cargo from winter rains and blowing sand. They named the temporary post Camp Castaway. The camp endured for four months in the open dunes with help from Native Americans of the Coos tribe who traded fresh foods to the soldiers for silverware, biscuits and other nonlocal goods. The archaeological remains of Camp Castaway were located by archaeologist Scott Byram during a survey in March, 2010, using 150-year- old archival records and maps he studied at the U.S. Coast Survey archives in Maryland.http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6tt003pf R.

The site is located on land administered by the Bureau of Land Management, Coos Bay District. Following discovery of the site, BLM archaeologist Steve Samuels assembled a team from Southern Oregon University Laboratory of Anthropology, the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians, and the Coquille Indian Tribe to excavate the site.http://theworldlink.com/news/local/camp- castaway/article_522b222e-e343-5568-a827-ad0297cd6aa0.html Lead archaeologist Mark Tveskov of SOU concluded that the site was Camp Castaway based on the distinctive artifacts recovered.

The story was adapted as an episode of the series Tales of the Unexpected in 1980, featuring Timothy West and Susan George as the couple. Plot Albert and Mabel Taylor have a newborn baby daughter. Mabel is frightened because the child won't eat and has been losing weight since birth. Albert, a beekeeper, devises the novel solution of adding royal jelly, used to make bee larvae grow, to the baby's milk. The baby begins to drink ravenously, getting fatter. Albert admits to putting royal jelly in their daughter's milk, and Mabel asks him to stop. He tries to soothe his wife by explaining its nutritional value as stated in several magazines. Despite his wife's continued objections, Albert continues to add royal jelly to his daughter's milk, resulting in her growing larger. Finally Albert admits that he himself ate royal jelly in an effort to increase his fertility, which obviously worked as their daughter was conceived soon after. Mabel begins to realise how much her husband resembles a gigantic bee, and how their daughter looks like a large grub. At the end of the story, Albert says, \\"Why don't you cover her up, Mabel?

Described as \\"a gleefully morbid summing up of [Wainwright's] life in which he ponders childhood, family history, aging and death,\\" the album is produced by High Wide & Handsome: The Charlie Poole Project (2009) collaborator Dick Connette, and features contributions from each of Wainwright's children. The album's title alludes to Wainwright's father, Loudon Wainwright, Jr., who was aged sixty-three upon his death. Upon the album's release, Wainwright noted, \\"When you‚Äôre sixty-five, everything seems to be somewhat in the rear-view, or at least in the side-view. Well, not everything, and hopefully your windshield wipers are still working.\\" Writing and composition Regarding one of the album's most prominent themes, death, Wainwright noted, \\"I'm also old enough to have a lot of friends that have died already, people I knew and was close to. The mother of my first two kids, Kate McGarrigle, died a couple of years ago. Friends, parents. So it becomes a powerful part of your life as you get older.\\" Wainwright elaborated, \\"The whole album is about, in a sense, the handwriting on the wall for all of us, and that‚Äôs been the situation with the songs I've written throughout my career. Whether it‚Äôs declining powers or family skirmishes or too much hanging out in the bar, this is all material that I‚Äôm assuming my audience knows about, and is going through. Or if they‚Äôre not going through it at the time, they‚Äôll eventually get there.\\" Two of the songs from the album, \\"Older Than My Old Man Now\\" and \\"The Days That We Die\\", feature spoken word performances of prose written by Loudon Wainwright Jr. for Life magazine in the early 80s. Regarding his father's influence on Older Than My Old Man Now and the inclusion of his writing, Wainwright noted, \\"He died in 1988, and I have powerful memories of him. He was a huge presence in my life, and we had difficulties... very typical father-son oedipal clashes, but he was a remarkable guy, and a fine writer. And that‚Äôs why I was so excited to be able to include some of his writing on the record, to bring him into the record. Both of my parents are dead, and in a way they've become bigger than ever, more important than ever. I don‚Äôt know why that is; maybe because I‚Äôm headed down that road myself. There are lots of wonderful old folk songs about how you‚Äôre going to join your parents on the other side. That remains to be seen, of course. But yeah, I was very happy to have Loudon Wainwright Junior on my album.\\" Following the album's release, Wainwright subsequently added spoken word performances of his father's writing into his live shows. The track \\"Over the Hill\\" ‚Äì which previously appeared as a bonus track on the CD reissue of Wainwright's 1975 album, Unrequited ‚Äì was initially a duet between Wainwright and his then-wife Kate McGarrigle, and appears here as a duet between Wainwright and his daughter Martha Wainwright. Wainwright stated, \\"Kate, who was the mother of my two older kids, was a very important person in my life. We didn‚Äôt hang out much in the last thirty years, but that doesn't diminish the effect that she had on me. And certainly when she died two years ago it had a powerful effect on me. She was a big person in my life.\\" Reception Prior to the album's release, The New Yorker's Hendric Hertzberg stated, \\"Older Than My Old Man Now is uniformly excellent. It offers not only welcome consolation to those who (like me) are shocked to find ourselves in the relevant age cohort but also, I imagine, innocent amusement to those who ‚Äî eventually, inevitably ‚Äî will find themselves there one day, however improbable the prospect may seem at the moment.\\" Track listing # \\"The Here & the Now\\" # \\"In C\\" # \\"Older Than My Old Man Now\\" # \\"Double Lifetime\\" # \\"Date Line\\" # \\"All in a Family\\" # \\"My Meds\\" # \\"Interlude\\" # \\"Over the Hill\\" # \\"Ghost Blues\\" # \\"I Remember Sex\\" # \\"Somebody Else\\" # \\"The Days That We Die\\" # \\"10\\" # \\"Something's Out to Get Me\\" Personnel =Musicians= The following musicians are confirmed to appear on the album: * Loudon Wainwright III ‚Äì vocals, guitar * Ramblin‚Äô Jack Elliott * Dame Edna Everage * Chris Smither * Lucy Wainwright Roche * Suzzy Roche * Chaim Tannenbaum * Martha Wainwright * Rufus Wainwright * Rob Moose * John Scofield =Recording personnel= * Dick Connette ‚Äì producer * Alex Venguer ‚Äì recording engineer References Category:2012 albums Category:Loudon Wainwright III albums ","title":"Older Than My Old Man Now"},{"id":"35414524","text":"G.

Many varieties are mutually unintelligible and by that criterion separate languages. In the 16th century, Spanish authorities recognized half a dozen lenguas comprising the Mixtec lengua. (See #Classical Mixtec.) It is not clear to what extent these were distinct languages at the time. Regardless, the colonial disintegration of the Mixtec nation and resulting isolation of local communities led to the rapid diversification of local dialects into distinct languages. Below are some attempts at Mixtec classification by various scholars. Geographic divisions Josserand (1983:106) lists 5 major geographic (not linguistic) divisions of Mixtec, which together cover a total of about 25,000 square kilometers. Enclaves of Amuzgo, Trique, Cuicatec, Ixcatec, and Chocho speakers are scattered nearby. #Puebla Mixtec #Guerrero Mixtec #Mixteca Baja #Mixteca Alta #Mixteca de la Costa  Colonial divisions  De los Reyes, in his Arte de Lengua Mixteca (1593), spoke of half a dozen lenguas in the Mixtec lengua. To these, his contemporaries added the dialects of Guerrero:Jim√©nez-Moreno (1962), as cited in Josserand (1983:125), and Terraciano (2004). *the lengua of Teposcolula, including the major communities of Tamazulapan, Tilantongo, Texupa, and Mitlatongo (Jim√©nez-Moreno: Tepozcolula‚ÄìTilantongo; the prestige dialect chosen by de los Reyes) *the lengua of Yanhuitl√°n, incl. Coixtlahuaca, Xaltepec, and Nochixtl√°n (Jim√©nez-Moreno: Yuanhuitl√°n‚ÄìCuilapan) *the lengua of Tlaxiaco and Achiutla (the prestige dialect chosen by Hern√°ndez) *the lengua of the Mixteca Baja *the lengua of Cuilapa and Guaxolotitl√°n in the Valley of Oaxaca (Jim√©nez-Moreno: Cuauhxochpan‚ÄìCuyamecalco) *the lengua of the Mixteca de la Costa *the Mixtec of Guerrero Josserand found that native mundane writing of the colonial era corresponded well to de los Reyes; based on phonological and orthographic consistencies, she divides the dialects into five groups, as follows: *the Baja area around Huajuapan (though there were multiple varieties in Baja, more than de los Reyes recognized) *the Oaxaca Valley around Cuilapan, closely related to the next *the northeastern Alta around the Valley of Nochixtlan, including Yanhuitlan and Coixtlahuaca *the eastern Alta around the Valleys of Teposcolula and Tamasulapa *the western Alta around the Valley of Tlaxiaco, Achiutla, and Chalcatongo Holland (1959) The following classification is given by William R. Holland (1959), as cited in Josserand (1983:134-135). This preliminary classification is a glottochronological study of the dialects of 22 Mixtec and 4 Cuicatec towns. *Zone 1: Ixtayutla, Mechoac√°n, Jamiltepec, Huazolotitl√°n, Pinotepa Nacional *Zone 2: Ixtayutla, Mechoac√°n, Jamiltepec, Pinotepa de Don Luis, Pinotepa Nacional, Atoyac, TlacamamaZones 1 and 2 are not mutually exclusive, but are rather two nuclei of an extended dialect chain running along the coast. *Zone 3: Santo Tom√°s Ocotepec, Santa Luc√≠a Monte Verde, San Miguel el Grande, San Esteban Atatlahuca *Zone 4: San Rafael Guerrero *Zone 5: Juxtlahuaca *Zone 6: Santa Mar√≠a Pe√±oles, Huitepec *Zone 7: Pe√±oles *Zone 8: Jocoticpac / Jocotipac *Zone 9: Cuyamecalco *Zone 10: San Juan Coatzospan *Zone 11: Chigmecatitl√°n, Santa Catarina Tlaltempan Holland (1959) also gives 3 areal groupings for these zones. *Costa: Zones 1, 2 *Alta: Zones 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 *Baja: Zones 8, 9, 10, 11 However, Josserand (1983) states that these groupings are based on flawed methodologies, including a faulty conception of the geographical layout of the Mixteca. Many towns that Holland listed as Baja are in fact Alta, and vice versa. Arana (1960) The following classification is given by Evangelina Arana-Osnaya (1960:257), as cited in Josserand (1983:137). *Group 1: Chigmecatitl√°n, Tlaltempan *Group 2: Cuyamecalco, San Juan Coatzospan *Group 3a: Huitepec, Pe√±oles, Santa Mar√≠a Pe√±oles, San Juan Tamazola *Group 3b: Cuilapan; probably also Xoxocotla and other towns - where Mixtec is now no longer spoken *Group 4a: San Miguel el Grande, San Esteban Atatlahuca, Santo Tom√°s Ocotepec, Jocoticpac; San Rafael in Guerrero *Group 4b: Mechoac√°n, Jamiltepec, Pinotepa de Don Luis, Ixtayutla, Huazolotitl√°n, Tlacamama, Pinotepa Nacional, Atoyac Mak & Longacre (1960) Cornelia Mak and Robert Longacre (1960) is the first reconstruction of Proto-Mixtec, which is the ancestor of Mixtec proper as opposed to Mixtecan. Below is a classification inferred from Mak & Longacre (1960) by Josserand (1983:142). 9 groups and a total of 28 towns are given. *Central Mixteca Alta: San Miguel el Grande, San Esteban Atatlahuca *Southern Mixteca Alta: Santiago Yosond√∫a, Santa Cruz Itundujia, San Mateo Santigui,Josserand (1983) believes this town is in fact San Mateo Sindihui in Nochixtl√°n District, but was misnamed in Mak & Longacre (1960).

Henry Bradley (1970), as cited in Josserand (1983:132). A total of 11 dialects are given. His classification was most likely based on SIL International's mutual intelligibility surveys. *Northern: Xayacatl√°n, Huajuapan, Chigmecatitl√°n *Northeastern: Apoala, Coatzospan, Cuyamecalco *Eastern: Pe√±oles, Tilantongo, Huitepec *East-central: Amoltepec *Central: Yosond√∫a, San Miguel, Molinos, San Esteban (Atatlahuca), Santo Tom√°s (Ocotepec), Mixtepec *South-central: Nuyoo‚ÄìYucuite, Itundujia *West-central: Silacayoapan‚ÄìJuxtlahuaca *Western: Metlatonoc, Coicoy√°n *Southwestern: Ayutla *Southern: Jicaltepec, Chayuco, Zacatepec *Southeastern: Tututepec However, Bradley (1968) had given a different classification which included only 7 dialects. *Northeast: Apoala, Cuyamecalco *Northwest: Chigmecatitl√°n, Xayacatl√°n‚ÄìChazumba, Cacaloxtepec *Mixteca Baja: Mixtepec, Juxtlahuaca‚ÄìSilacayoapan, Coicoy√°n *Guerrero: Coatzingo, Malinaltepec, Yolosochitl, Ayutla *Mixteca de la Costa: Zacatepec, Pinotepa, Ixtayutla, Jamiltepec, Tututepec *Western Mixteca Alta: √ëum√≠, Chalcatongo, Yosond√∫a, Itundujia, Atatlahuca *Eastern Mixteca Alta: Pe√±oles, Tilantongo Egland & Bartholomew (1983) Egland & Bartholomew find 29 groups at a 70% mutual- intelligibility level.

Established in 1994, it earned a reputation in the 1990s as a \\"hotbed for New York's jazz talent\\" with a \\"well-deserved reputation as one of the best places in the city to see rising talent in the New York jazz scene\\". Its jazz musicians are noted for being \\"talented, though largely unknown\\" while its music is characterized as \\"modern versions of bebop and hard bop\\". The club's main room is in a basement with a capacity of 50 people that expanded to 60 people. Smalls Jazz Club should not be confused with Smalls Paradise in Harlem, which was founded in 1925 by Ed Smalls and closed in the 1950s. History Borden sits at the register in 1998. Smalls Jazz Club was established in 1993 by Mitchell \\"Mitch\\" Borden, a former submariner, nurse, and teacher. Its target audience was characterized as young, bohemian, and talkative. Music commenced every night at 10:30 and at times lasted until 6:00 the following morning. The entrance fee was US $10.00; no alcohol was served. Musicians who performed in the early years include Ehud Asherie, Omer Avital, Noah Becker, Peter Bernstein, Avishai Cohen, Ari Hoenig, Guillermo Klein, Jason Lindner, Charles Owens, Kurt Rosenwinkel, Grant Stewart, Mark Turner, Tommy Turrentine, Richie Vitale, Michael Weiss, and Myron Walden. The house pianist was Frank Hewitt. Financial difficulties led Borden to close Smalls on May 31, 2003. The closing was due to declining attendance after the September 11 attacks, rent increases in this neighborhood, and a smoking ban in indoor public places imposed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Concerts were moved into the Fat Cat Club next door, which was open four nights a week until 2:00 AM. In 2004, the Brooklyn Jazz Underground premiered with four shows at Smalls. In early 2006, Borden and musicians Michael \\"Spike\\" Wilner and Lee Kostrinsky reopened Smalls. The club was restored and the sound quality was improved. Chairs were bought at 17 stoop sales. A poster of Louis Armstrong from the original Smalls hangs on the wall. There is a full-service bar. Smalls continues to be recommended as a top jazz club. The entrance fee was raised to US$20. The first music set begins at 7:30 PM. Instead of all night jazz sessions, there are two or three sets per night. All concerts are broadcast live on the club's website and are available in replay to subscribers. The renovated club has featured Bruce Barth, Leon Parker, Steve Slagle, Peter Bernstein, Jimmy Cobb, Steve Davis, Joel Frahm, Kevin Hays, Ethan Iverson, Jazz Incorporated (Jeremy Pelt, Anthony Wonsey, Louis Hayes), David Kikoski, Ryan Kisor, Bill Mobley, Tim Ries, Jim Rotondi, and Neal Smith.

It is situated in Bela Gram Panchayat, Dariapur Block, Parsa in Saran district of Bihar. It was inaugurated in 2008 by the former Railway Minister of India, Laloo Prasad Yadav. It was built at a cost of . It is spread over a land area of 165 acres.  Construction  The Rail Wheel Plant's construction, which started in July 2008, was a step to revive industrialization in North Bihar. Indian Railways made history by awarding this project as an Engineering Procurement & Construction (EPC) contract to Larsen & Toubro Limited (L&T;). It was the first time in the history of Indian Railways that a highly sophisticated factory was set up without any foreign collaboration. It was possible because of the in-house capability of railway engineers and expertise of L&T.; The construction division of L&T; (ECC) was involved in civil & electrical works, whereas the Railway Business Unit (an initiative of L&T; in rolling stock projects) set up methods and procedures along with interfacing of equipment. Working in close coordination with contractors and sub-contractors, Indian Railways achieved completion of the project within the stipulated time-frame of 40 months (24 months of the original time schedule and additional extensions). It was a challenge for Indian Railways to start civil works in a difficult site which is surrounded by rivers on all sides. To add to complications, the elevation of the plant was lower than the river bed. Because the soil was loose, stone columns were constructed to increase the load-bearing capacity of the soil. Additionally, Bihara is a remote area so L&T; deployed 24-hour security because there was the constant fear of unlawful activities by locals and Maoist insurgents. One siding Railway line from the plant site to Nayagaon railway station is under construction. The plant dispatched its first consignment of about 250 broad gauge passenger coach wheels in October 2016.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/Execution-of-rail-projects- Sarans-biggest-gain-in-16/articleshow/56244188.cms Nearly 3000 workers were employed during peak construction period including 300 highly skilled engineers of various specialties.  Safety  The Rail Wheel Plant project was completed with a safety record of 1 million safe man hours. This admirable safety record was achieved through a daily morning pep-talk and vigilant site supervision by trained and qualified safety stewards.  Villages affected  The villages of Dariyapur Block specially Laloo Tola, Mushahari, Durbela, Babu Tola, and Kochwara were affected by the acquisition of land from farmers of these villages. Indian Railways compensated farmers for the acquired lands and promised them jobs in the plant.  Electricity  The State Government in collaboration with Power Grid Corporation of India founded the Sitalpur Power Grid in the year 2000 to provide electricity to the plant and neighboring villages in a radius of 25 km.  Education  The Rail Wheel Plant founded some institutions for its employee and members of neighboring villages, especially Bela Gram Panchayat and Dariyapur: * Kendriya Vidyalaya, Bela (affiliated from CBSE Delhi) * Yamunachari High School, Dariyapur (State Government School affiliated from BSEB Patna) * Government High School, Dariyapur (State Government School affiliated from BSEB Patna) See also * Diesel Locomotive Factory, Marhowra * Electric Locomotive Factory, Madhepura * Chittaranjan Locomotive Works, Asansol * Diesel Locomotive Works, Varanasi * Integral Coach Factory, Chennai * Modern Coach Factory, Raebareli * Rail Coach Factory, Kapurthala * Rail Wheel Factory, Yelehanka * Titagarh Wagons, Titagarh List of locomotive builders by countries  References   External links  * Rail wheel plant bela site * Tender notice of Rail wheel Factory Bela * Indian Railways, Workshop Projects, Patna * Lalu kicks off work at Chhapra wheel factory - Times Of India * INDIAN RAILWAYS WORKSHOP PROJECTS Office of the Chief ...!, Indian Railways Category:Coach and wagon manufacturers of India Category:Saran district Category:Factories in Bihar ","title":"Rail Wheel Plant, Bela"},{"id":"35415442","text":"\\"A di mi yere yu friyari\\" is a very popular birthday song in Suriname.

George Packer in The New Yorker called the book \\"the closest view of Obama we‚Äôre likely to get until he publishes his own memoir.\\" In the New York Times, Joe Klein wrote, \\"His achievement is rare for a political memoir: He has written a humane and honorable book.\\" Rhodes has written opinion articles for newspapers and magazines including the New York Times and The Atlantic. During the Obama administration, Rhodes led the secret negotiations with Cuba that resulted in the December 17, 2014, announcement by President Obama and Ra√∫l Castro that the two countries would normalize relations. Rhodes traveled to Canada and the Vatican for talks with Cuba about a prisoner exchange that led to the release of Alan Gross and a U.S. intelligence asset, along with the decision to re- establish diplomatic relations between Cuba and the U.S. In his book, Rhodes revealed that his negotiating counterpart was Alejandro Castro, the son of Ra√∫l. Rhodes was the U.S. government representative at the funeral for Fidel Castro in 2016. Rhodes has been critical of the Trump administration's approach to Cuba. Rhodes was featured in the HBO documentary The Final Year, along with John Kerry, Samantha Power and Susan Rice. The documentary portrays the events of Obama's final year in office, with a focus on his foreign policy team.  Early life and education  Rhodes was born on November 14, 1977, in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. He is the son of an Episcopal father from Texas and a Jewish mother from New York. He attended the Collegiate School, graduating in 1996. Rhodes then attended Rice University, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 2000 with majors in English and political science. He then moved back to New York, attending New York University and graduating in 2002 with an MFA in creative writing. His brother, David Rhodes, is a former President of CBS News.  Career  In the summer of 1997, Rhodes volunteered with the Rudy Giuliani mayoral campaign. In the summer of 2001, he worked on the New York City Council campaign of Diana Reyna. In 2002, James Gibney, editor of Foreign Policy, introduced Rhodes to Lee Hamilton, former member of the House of Representatives and director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, who was looking for a speechwriter. Rhodes then spent five years as an assistant to Hamilton, helping to draft the Iraq Study Group Report and the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. Ben Rhodes and Aung San Suu Kyi discussing U.S. support for NLD-led government in Myanmar, July 2016 In 2007, Rhodes began working as a speechwriter for the 2008 Obama presidential campaign. Rhodes wrote Obama's 2009 Cairo speech \\"A New Beginning\\". Rhodes was the adviser who counseled Obama to withdraw support from Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak, becoming a key adviser during the 2011 Arab Spring. Rhodes supported Israel in the 2012 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict. Rhodes was instrumental in the conversations that led to Obama reestablishing the United States' diplomatic relations with Cuba, which had been cut off since 1961. The New York Times reported that Rhodes spent \\"more than a year sneaking off to secret negotiations in Canada and finally at the Vatican\\" in advance of the official announcement in December 2014. After leaving the Obama administration, Rhodes began working as a commentator. He wrote The World as It Is and began contributing to Crooked Media, NBC News and MSNBC. In 2018, he co-founded National Security Action. In 2015-16, Rhodes defended U.S. political and military backing of Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. He later criticized Trump administration's involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. He wrote of the war in Yemen, \\"Looking back, I wonder what we might have done differently, particularly if we‚Äôd somehow known that Obama was going to be succeeded by a President Trump.\\" Rhodes said Obama's administration was too worried about offending Turkey. He said Obama should have recognized the Armenian Genocide.  Controversies  In a controversial profile in The New York Times Magazine, Rhodes was quoted \\"deriding the D.C. press corps and boasting of how he created an 'echo chamber' to market the administration's foreign policy\\", including the international nuclear agreement with Iran.Paul Farhi (May 6, 2016). \\"Obama official says he pushed a 'narrative' to media to sell the Iran nuclear deal\\". The Washington Post. Retrieved May 11, 2016. The piece was criticized by numerous journalism outlets for its lack of journalistic integrity and biases against the Iran deal. In 2017, it was alleged that Israeli private intelligence firm Black Cube attempted to manufacture incriminating or embarrassing information about Rhodes and his wife, as well as fellow former National Security Council staffer Colin Kahl, in an apparent effort to undermine supporters of the Iran nuclear deal. Rhodes said of the incident, \\"This just eviscerates any norm of how governments should operate or treat their predecessors and their families. It crosses a dangerous line.\\" The effort continued well after the Obama administration ended.  Awards and honors  In 2011, Rhodes was on Time magazine's \\"40 Under 40\\" list of powerful and prominent young professionals. Rhodes was number 13 on Fortune magazine's \\"40 Under 40\\" list of the most influential young people in business in 2014. In 2015, Rhodes was named one of Foreign Policy magazine's top 100 global thinkers.  Books  *Without Precedent: The Inside Story of the 9/11 Commission. (co-authored by Thomas H. Kean and Lee H.

It is now in Mount Desert, Maine. History Erhard Weyhe (1883‚Äì1972) established the Weyhe Gallery in 1919. He also operated a bookstore, the Weyhe bookstore, at the same location at 794 Lexington Avenue. Weyhe had immigrated to the United States from England just before the start of World War I. By 1923, he had bought the brownstone building on Lexington Avenue that would house the Gallery until 1994. The Weyhe Gallery published prints singly or in portfolios. It emphasized emerging artists, and it was a prominent institution in the American art world in the first half of the 20th century. Modernist artists were among its early popular exhibitors: In 1991, David Kiehl, associate curator of prints and photographs at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, called the building \\"a shrine for modern art,\\" describing \\"early exhibits of the German Expressionists, of Matisse, of Picasso, of Mexican and African art\\". Weyhe also published an art magazine, The Checkerboard. The gallery's first director was Carl Zigrosser, who continued in this role until 1940. Erhard Weyhe's daughter, Gertrude Dennis, operated the gallery and book store after his death in 1972 until her death in 2003. At that time, the New York City establishment closed its doors, and it was relocated to Mount Desert, Maine. Deborah Kiley, Weyhe's granddaughter, is the current owner of the Weyhe Gallery and the book store, Weyhe Art Books. The current incarnation of the Weyhe Gallery maintains collections in the following areas: 19th century European, American Pre-1950, Classic Modernism, and American Regionalism. Among the many artists represented in its collections are John James Audubon, George Grosz, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Kathe Kollwitz, Max Weber, Raoul Dufy, Diego Rivera, Levon West, Lovis Corinth and Angelo Pinto. The files of the Weyhe Gallery from 1919 to 1994 are part of the research collections of the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art.

Released for the GameCube video game console in 2002, it is a remake of the 1996 PlayStation game Resident Evil, the first installment in the Resident Evil video game series. The story takes place in 1998 near the fictional Midwestern town of Raccoon City where a series of bizarre murders have taken place. The player takes on the role of either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, S.T.A.R.S. agents sent in by the city to investigate the murders. Resident Evil was developed over the course of one year and two months as part of an exclusivity deal between Capcom and Nintendo. It was directed by Shinji Mikami, who also designed and directed the original Resident Evil. Mikami decided to produce a remake because he felt that the original had not aged well enough and that the GameCube's capabilities could bring it closer to his original vision. The game retains the same graphical presentation, with 3D models superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds. However, the quality of the graphics was vastly improved. The remake also features new gameplay mechanics, revised puzzles, additional explorable areas, a revised script, and new story details including an entire subplot cut from the original game. Upon release, Resident Evil received critical acclaim from video game journalists, who praised its graphics and improved gameplay over the original game. It is often described as one of the best, scariest, and most visually impressive entries in the Resident Evil series. However, the game sold worse than expected, leading Capcom to change the direction of the series to a more action-oriented approach. In 2008, the game was ported to the Wii, featuring a new control system. In 2015, a high- definition remastered version was released for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox 360, and Xbox One to critical and commercial success. Gameplay The player, controlling Chris Redfield, can use defensive weapons such as daggers when grabbed by zombies. The game features 3D models over pre- rendered backgrounds. Resident Evil is a survival horror game where the player controls the on-screen character from a third-person perspective to interact with the environment. To advance, the player must explore a mansion and its surrounding areas while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating monsters including zombies, undead dogs, and giant spiders. The player can open doors, push certain objects, climb obstacles, and pick up items. When an item is collected, it is stored in an inventory that the player can access at any time. Items in the inventory can be used, examined, and combined to solve puzzles and gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible. The inventory is limited to a certain number of slots, and the player must often move items from the inventory to storage boxes located in certain areas to manage space. Although the player can use firearms to kill monsters, Resident Evil emphasizes evasion over fast-paced combat by providing the player with limited ammunition. The player has a limited amount of health, which decreases when attacked by monsters. Players can regain health by collecting and using herbs, which can be mixed with other herbs to increase their healing effect. Some monsters can also infect the player with a poisoning effect, which gradually depletes the player's health over time until the poison is cured with serum or special herbs. Zombies that are defeated but not decapitated or burned eventually revive and mutate into deadlier forms. The player can control either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, each with advantages and disadvantages. For example, Chris can take and deal more damage than Jill, but Jill can carry more items and unlock certain doors with a lock pick. Both characters can equip defensive weapons that can save them from taking damage when seized by an enemy. These defensive weapons include a dagger and a unique special weapon: Jill can use a taser, while Chris can shove stun grenades into zombies' mouths and detonate them with a pistol shot. Defensive weapons are limited and can only be used when the player is grabbed by a monster. The game features an automap to help players navigate the different areas of the game. Additionally, the player can pick up maps of certain sections to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, players need to find ink ribbons and use them with a typewriter; the game features a limited supply of ink ribbons, so players cannot save their progress as many times as they want. The story is slightly altered by the character the player chooses to play as, and certain choices the player makes in the game can impact the direction of the game and its ending. Upon completing the game under a certain difficulty setting and time limit, the player may unlock secret costumes for the main characters, bonus weapons, and special difficulty modes. Plot On July 24, 1998, a series of bizarre murders occur on the outskirts of the Midwestern town of Raccoon City. The Raccoon City Police Department's Special Tactics And Rescue Service (STARS) are assigned to investigate. After contact with Bravo Team is lost, Alpha Team is sent to investigate their disappearance. Alpha Team locates Bravo Team's crashed helicopter and land at the site, where they are attacked by a pack of monstrous dogs, killing one of the team. After Alpha Team's helicopter pilot, Brad Vickers, panics and takes off alone, the remaining members (Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Albert Wesker and Barry Burton) seek refuge in an abandoned mansion, where they split up. The player character (Chris or Jill) finds several members of Bravo Team, including Kenneth J. Sullivan being eaten by a zombie; Richard Aiken, who is either killed by a giant venomous snake or eaten by a shark; Forest Speyer, who is found dead and revived as a zombie; and Bravo Team leader Enrico Marini, who reveals that one of Alpha Team's members is a traitor before being killed by an unseen shooter. Bravo Team survivor Rebecca Chambers joins Chris. The player character learns that a series of illegal experiments were undertaken by a clandestine research team under the authority of a biomedical company Umbrella Corporation. The creatures roaming the mansion and its surrounding areas are the results of these experiments, which have exposed the mansion's personnel and animals to a highly contagious and mutagenic biological agent known as the T-virus. The player character discovers a secret underground laboratory containing Umbrella's experiments. There, they find Jill or Chris in a cell and encounter Wesker programming a Tyrant, a humanoid supersoldier. Wesker reveals that he is a double agent working for Umbrella, and plans to use the Tyrant to kill the STARS members. In the ensuing confrontation, Wesker is apparently killed and the player character defeats the Tyrant. After activating the lab's self-destruct system, the player character reaches the heliport and contacts Brad for extraction. The ending changes depending on the player's actions at key points: in the best ending, the surviving team members escape by helicopter after defeating the Tyrant again; in the worst ending, the mansion remains intact and the player character is the sole survivor. Development Canadian model Julia Voth served as the basis for Jill Valentine's facial and physical appearance Resident Evil was developed by Capcom Production Studio 4 and directed by Shinji Mikami, who designed and directed the original Resident Evil for the PlayStation console. The game was part of an exclusivity agreement between Capcom and Nintendo to bring previous and new Resident Evil games to the GameCube. Unlike Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, and Resident Evil ‚Äì Code: Veronica, which were simply ported to the GameCube, Mikami decided to produce a remake of the original game because he felt its graphics had not aged well, making it hard for new players to appreciate it. Programmer Yasuhiro Anpo also cited the original game's poor localization as another reason for the remake. Mikami felt the GameCube would allow him to bring the game closer to the original vision he had for the series. As Capcom's marketing director Todd Thorson said, the main goal was to \\"achieve motion picture-quality visuals and create even more suspense and fear than the original\\". Production started at the beginning of 2001 with a team of only four programmers. Because Resident Evil was one of the first Capcom games developed for the GameCube, the development team had to study the system's performance during the first stages of development. Initially, the team considered creating the environments with computer graphic animation but then realized that this approach would require too much hardware capacity and processing to achieve realistic graphics. As a result, the graphical style of the remake features 3D models over pre-rendered backgrounds like the Resident Evil games. Despite this, the camera is more dynamic and can track the player at varying angles. The backgrounds also make use of particle effects and full motion video layers to simulate effects such as rushing water or swaying tree branches. Creating fear in players was a priority, and many of the game's backgrounds were designed to have a high contrast between dark and light so that enemies could appear unexpectedly. Originally, the developers planned to only upgrade the graphics and tweak the gameplay. However, as the game approached completion, Capcom started making more substantial changes. For example, the inventory was expanded so that players could carry a standard item like Jill's lockpick, while defense items, which were initially included in the main inventory, were introduced to make the game easier than the original. The developers originally planned to make all enemies invisible but the idea was discarded because it would have made the remake very different from the original game. However, they designed the zombies so that they could eventually come back to life after being killed. The developers added new areas for the player to explore, changed most of the puzzle designs, and included an additional control scheme whereby players move their characters by pressing the R button of the GameCube controller and steer them with the analog stick. Another addition is a subplot involving the character Lisa Trevor, which was cut from the original game. Instead of using adjectives to describe difficulty levels, Mikami decided to have unique questions so that the player would pick the hard one. Capcom auditioned actors to be used as references by the character designers. The faces of the protagonists were based on real people and motion capture was used to animate their models. About 60 percent of the character motions were animated based on the captured data, while the rest was created from scratch. The developers initially struggled to develop a system for computer graphic animation. However, Nintendo provided Capcom with assistance and the problems were eventually solved. Capcom also hired new voice actors and rewrote the game's script to make the plot more convincing. The game was developed over the course of one year and two months. Final development was very intense, as programmers had to work for two straight months with no days off to meet the deadline. Resident Evil was released in March 2002 in Japan, April 2002 in North America, and September 2002 in Europe. Reception Upon its release on the GameCube, Resident Evil received critical acclaim. IGN reviewer Matt Casamassina felt that the game is \\"a triumph as a stand-alone adventure and a major accomplishment as a remake\\", calling it \\"the prettiest, most atmospheric and all-around scariest game we've ever played.\\" Similarly, GameSpot reviewer Shane Satterfield described the remake as \\"one amazing game that clearly stands as the best the series has to offer\\", while Edge magazine remarked that the game's unforgiving gameplay and technical artistry improve the tension and anxiety that the original offered. The game was widely praised for its graphics. GameSpot credited the attention to detail, realistic gore, volumetric fog, and integration of real-time lighting and shadows with pre- rendered backgrounds, commenting that Capcom had \\"finally perfected the art of mixing prerendered scenery with ambient animations and polygonal objects, and the result is the most visually impressive video game ever released.\\" IGN highlighted the complex geometry of the character models, stating that \\"close shots of Chris or Jill look almost photo-realistic.\\" Writing for NGC Magazine, Jes Bickham remarked that, unlike in the original Resident Evil, the contrast between character models and backgrounds is seamless. He also noted that the game is \\"so visually rich that simply seeing the next area is an experience to be treasured.\\" The game's suspenseful and cinematic atmosphere received praise, with GameRevolution going so far as to say that the game makes the original Resident Evil look like Pong. Resident Evil was also praised for its realistic sound. AllGame reviewer Scott Alan Marriott felt that the game \\"[creates] a constant sense of dread without relying too much on obvious shock values\\", while GameSpot highlighted the quality and variety of sound effects, noting that \\"there seem to be dozens of sound effects for footsteps alone.\\" However, some publications considered the voice acting to be weak due to its exaggerated delivery. Although the game's limiting controls and inventory management was criticized, changes to many aspects of the gameplay were positively viewed. Mike Weigand of GamePro wrote, \\"It's like playing Resident Evil for the first time.\\" GameSpot remarked that the defensive weapons add a new layer of strategy to the game. However, the controls were criticized for their lack of analog precision, a feature that was previously available in the Nintendo 64 version of Resident Evil 2. Hector Guzman of GameSpy criticized the fact that the original game's \\"laborious\\" tank controls, whereby the analog stick moves the player character in the direction they are facing, was not changed, stating that it can cause unnecessary difficulties when players try to evade monsters. IGN's criticism was similar but considered the game's alternative control schemes a welcome addition. At the GameSpot's Best and Worst of 2002 awards, Resident Evil was nominated for Best Story on GameCube, Best Graphics (Technical) on GameCube, and Best Action Adventure Game on GameCube. As of January 2004, 445,176 copies of the game had been sold in the United States. In May 2008, Capcom revealed that a total of 1.35 million copies of the game were sold. Legacy Resident Evil is often regarded as one of the greatest and most visually impressive games in the series. According to IGN, the game's graphics \\"became the new standard by which all future installments in the series would be compared.\\" Digital Spy writer Liam Martin remarked that the game is \\"the definitive version of a true classic\\" and that it still looked \\"fantastic\\" nearly 13 years after it was first released. Although the game received critical acclaim, it sold worse than expected. As a result, Mikami and Capcom decided that subsequent games in the Resident Evil series would shift away from the survival horror genre and incorporate more action-based elements, starting with Resident Evil 4 in 2005. Before that happened, Capcom developed Resident Evil Zero, a direct prequel using the same graphics engine and released in late 2002. =Wii version= In December 2008, Resident Evil was ported to the GameCube's successor, the Wii, along with Resident Evil Zero. The port, Resident Evil Archives: Resident Evil, features a control system that supports both the Wii Remote and the GameCube controller. Although Capcom originally had no plans to release the Wii version outside of Japan, arguing that the game would not sell very well, the game was eventually released in North America and Europe in June 2009 due to the commercial success of Resident Evil 5. The Wii version received generally favorable reviews from critics, but some publications criticized it for its outdated controls, lack of new features, and lack of widescreen support. =HD Remaster= A high-definition (HD) version, Resident Evil HD Remaster, was released for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox 360, and Xbox One in January 2015. The HD version supports 5.1 surround sound as well as a resolution of 1080p and a widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9. Although the original pre-rendered backgrounds have a 4:3 format, the developers decided against re-rendering them in 16:9 because it would allow players to see more of the environment than intended, reducing the sense of immersion and danger. As a result, the developers added vertical scrolling to the backgrounds, which respond to the movement of the character, to fit the remaster's widescreen aspect ratio. A new control scheme was also included, allowing players to move their character in the direction of the analog stick. The remaster was a commercial success, breaking sales records. It became the PlayStation Network's biggest launch game and Capcom's fastest-selling digital game across North America and Europe. Capcom announced that the remaster exceeded sales of one million copies by April 2015. Its commercial success resulted in Capcom's announcement of a similar edition of Resident Evil Zero in 2015. Critical reception towards the remaster was mostly positive. Several critics noted that some features like the inventory system and the insistence on having to revisit previously explored areas have not aged very well, but generally agreed that the remaster was a solid revival of a classic. The new control scheme was also considered more intuitive and satisfying, especially for new players. As of June 2020, the remaster had sold 2.8 million copies worldwide across all platforms. A compilation, Resident Evil: Origins Collection, which includes both Resident Evil HD Remaster and Resident Evil Zero HD Remaster, was released on January 22, 2016. The game was released for the Nintendo Switch on May 21, 2019 along with Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil Zero.

Some of these are also known as alternative sanctions. Alternatives can take the form of fines, restorative justice, transformative justice or no punishment at all. Capital punishment, corporal punishment and electronic monitoring are also alternatives to imprisonment, but are not promoted by modern prison reform movements for decarceration. Reformers generally seek to reduce prison populations and make increased use of alternatives with a focus on rehabilitation. The main arguments for this are that these punishments reduce the chance of reoffending, reduce cost burdens on the state and reduce prison overcrowding. Arguments for alternatives Academic studies are inconclusive as to whether high imprisonment rates reduce crime rates in comparison to low imprisonment rates. While they at least remove offenders from the community,. there is little evidence that prisons can rehabilitate offenders or deter crime. Some inmates are at risk of being drawn further into crime. They may make friends with other criminals, have their medical or mental health needs neglected or endure further abuse from other prisoners and even staff. If the prisoner is a parent, the family will suffer from the parent's absence. Released prisoners commonly have difficulty finding work and earning a legal income. As a result, most countries have high recidivism rates. In the United States, 67.8% of released prisoners are rearrested within three years and 76.6% are rearrested within five years. Prison reformers argue in favor of reducing prison populations, mainly through reducing the number of those imprisoned for minor crimes. A key goal is to improve conditions by reducing overcrowding. Prison reformers also argue that alternative methods are often better at rehabilitating offenders and preventing crime in the long term. Alternative = Periodic detention = Periodic detention is a type of custodial sentence under which the offender is held in prison periodically, for example between Friday and Sunday evenings each week, but is at liberty at other times. Promoted by prison reformers as an alternative to imprisonment, periodic detention drew praise for allowing offenders to continue working, maintain family relationships, and avoid associating with more dangerous criminals in traditional prisons. It was also considerably less expensive to administer. =Addressing crimes involving sexual offenders= Although there have been changes in the way sex offenders are treated in the last twenty years, there is a need to differentiate between the different types rather than placing them in the same box. By using a compassionate approach, possible sex offenders (those addicted to pornographic images, for example) might seek help before they commit any kind of crime. Therefore, some argue that sex offending needs to be seen within a public health framework rather than a criminal justice one. =Alternatives for minors= It is crucial to understand how alternatives to incarceration or detention for minors are developed and implemented. Investigations show that incarceration and education are closely associated. Restorative justice in the forms of boot camps and military programs adopted into public education options is starting to be considered. A variety of programs for anger management, self-esteem, etc. have been developed and those working with academics are called upon to develop such alternatives. It is shown that people in society are willing to pay for rehabilitation for juvenile offenders as opposed to other forms of punishment. Kentucky has passed a bill in which the state encourages community-based treatment over detention for juveniles. Some of the measures introduced early intervention process, evidence-based tools for screening and assessing juveniles, or placed limits on the maximum out-of-home placement time. Nancy Stein emphasizes on deinstitutionalizing young people by creating community-based alternatives. Many of these alternative programs in which Stein suggests are ones that are started by the community as they want to reduce the percentage of adolescents being institutionalized. One of the community programs is the Omega Boys Club where their goal is to build relationships with young people and help them make wise decisions in life. As a result, the Omega Boys Club has contributed in decreasing the rate of juvenile crime. This article shows that there are many people committed in lowering crime rates within their communities and will do whatever they can to help keep the future leaders of our nation out of trouble. The constant involvement with youth in these not well off communities is what John Brown Childs believes as \\"youth who actively work for peace and against violence as the inspiration for strategic direction and community rebirth.\\" Thus more community based alternatives to incarceration can help to lower the number of people in prison. =Alternatives for drug users= Despite the efforts of organization groups, such as the American Bar Association, in promoting alternatives to imprisonment, they seem to be ignored when it comes to the federal government. Some alternatives introduced in this article include confinement, community service, tracking devices, and expanded terms in halfway houses. Some other ideas include an increase in supervision for a decrease in time as an alternative to long-term imprisonment. This technically wouldn't be an alternative to incarceration, but rather to full-term supervision. There are often cases such as with parents and drug abusers that need special attention and aren‚Äôt so easy to incarcerate. Some argue that for less dangerous criminals, treatment facilities should be the first option. The Residential Drug Abuse Program helps inmates addicted to drugs get released early through the overcoming of their own addictions. =Restorative justice= Native American communities, particularly reservations in the United States and Canada, have had a reputation for high crime rates. Restorative justice is an important alternative to the Prison Industrial Complex in these communities. Native Americans are largely overrepresented in Western penal systems, and are moving towards self-determination in administering restorative justice to their communities. Some alternatives that have been suggested are community-based programs, participation in Western sentencing circles, and re-institution of traditional corporal punishment. A successful example of this is the Miyo Wahkotowin Community Education Authority, which uses restorative techniques at the three Emineskin Cree nation schools it operates in Alberta, Canada. The Authority has a special Sohki program which has a coordinator work with students with \\"behavioral issues\\" rather than punish them and has had successful results. Alternative programs by location =Canada= In the Community Based Alternatives to Incarceration in Canada, Richard M. Zubrycki argues that by \\"the Canadian criminal justice system supporting the safe use of community alternatives (there would be a significant decrease) in the prison populations\\" (Zubrycki). He discusses mainly about community alternatives such as first time offenders receiving intervention that would help them not to commit the crime again. Another successful alternative is the Canadian government provides families with family group counseling; this is significant because it builds a stronger- closely connected support group that helps to decrease the chances of that person committing the crime again. Canada has also researched and tried to understand what Community Program works best for different types of crime offenders. From their research and perseverance \\"today their prison population is low and is dropping\\" (Zubrycki, Community Based Alternatives to incarceration in Canada). =New York= New York City, the largest city in the United States, has created important alternatives to incarceration (ATI) program for its prison system. Judges have the option of sending those with misdemeanors or felonies to this program instead of giving them a prison sentence. The program has four categories: general population, substance abusers, women, and youth. The program has a 60% success rate, which is relatively high. Offenders who fail the program receive a mandatory prison sentence, which gives them good incentive to succeed. Those who don't succeed tend to have a past with incarceration. As the biggest city in the United States, New York City is often a trendsetter for other cities. This program could be the first of many in the United States, which could help lower incarceration rates. =Maryland= Maryland started with the goal of reducing the state's prison population. They developed a legislative reform package that was projected to reduce the state's prison population by 14 percent and save $247 million over the next decade. The Justice Reinvestment Act signed into law by Maryland Governor Larry Hogan in May 2016 has advanced research- based sentencing guidelines and the policies that govern corrections in the state. By reducing the number of people in the state's prison population, they are also reducing the number of children in the state which have parents that are incarcerated. These policy changes have a direct effect on the lives of these children. The Justice Reinvestment Act made changes to mandatory minimum drug penalties and it put caps on the prison sentences that can be imposed for technical violations of supervision. Certain low-level offense are handled by an administrative parole process for nonviolent offenses. Maryland examined and researched why alternative sentencing is needed and one of the main reasons is because it discovered that nonviolent crimes accounted for most prison sentencing.

C. piggae is one of three extinct species placed in the Cornus subgenus Cornus based on fossil fruit morphology. The other two species, C. ettingshausenii and C. multilocularis are known from pyritized fruits found in sediments of the London Clay in England. C. piggae is the only North American fruit species yet described and is also the oldest described species in Cornus subgenus Cornus. History and classification Cornus piggae is represented by a group of fifteen specimens from the Tiffanian aged Sentinel Butte Formation which outcrops in near the town of Almont, North Dakota and the Beicegal Creek, North Dakota. The age of the formation is based on the recovery of late Tiffanian mammals in the upper section of the formation along with the floral and palynological assemblages of the formation. Thirteen of the fossils were recovered from the University of Florida location 15722 at Almont while the remaining two are from location 18907 near Beicegal Creek. The holotype specimen for Cornus piggae along with eight of the paratypes are currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois. Five of the Almont paratype specimens and one Beicegal Creek specimen are in the university of Florida Collections, with the remaining Almont specimen housed at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìStevens Point and the second Beicegal Creek specimen in the Arizona State University collections. The specimens were studied by paleobotanist Steven R. Manchester of the university of Florida, and botanists Xiao-Ping Xiang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Qiu-Yun (Jenny) Xiang of North Carolina State University. Manchester, Xiang, and Xiang published their 2010 type description for C. piggae in the International Journal of Plant Sciences. The etymology of the specific name piggae was derived from Professor Kathleen Pigg's name in honor of her contributions the field of paleobotany. Description Fossil specimens of Cornus piggae contain two to three locules and range from wide by in length. Both the apex and base are smooth with no apical depressions present and the smooth exterior of the fruits lacks ribbing. The apex hosts two to three germination valves which correspond to the elongate locules. The cell structure of the endocarp indicates placement into Cornus, while subglobose chambers in the walls of the locules are seen only in the Cornus subgenus Cornus. The overall size of Cornus piggae is noted as distinctly smaller than the fruits of other living and extinct members in the subgenus.

He drew on his wartime experiences, which included the medical care of Rudolf Hess, to develop views on authoritarian personality and the collective psychopathology of authoritarian regimes. Life Henry Dicks was born at Pernau, Estonia (then in Russia) in 1900. His father was an English exporter and shipowner who also acted as British Vice-Counsul, and his mother came from an academic Baltic German family. He was educated at Pernau, Riga and St Petersburg, and by the time the family returned to England after the Russian Revolution he was able to speak English, Russian, and German fluently, as well as speaking some French. After serving as an interpreter with Military Intelligence with the British Expeditionary Force in North Russia, and then with the British Military Mission in South Russia and the Caucasus, he studied natural sciences at St John's College, Cambridge and medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital. In 1928 he joined the recently founded Tavistock Clinic, rising to become Assistant Medical Director there from 1934 to 1946, and publishing a psychiatric textbook in 1939. In 1941 he joined the British Army as a Specialist Psychiatrist. Because of his ability to speak German, he was charged with medical care of Rudolf Hess in May to June 1941.Daniel Pick, The Pursuit of the Nazi Mind: Hitler, Hess, and the Analysts, Oxford University Press, 2012. From 1942 to 1944 he advised Military Intelligence on German morale, from 1944 to 1945 he advised SHAEF on psychological warfare and from 1945 to 1946 he advised the Control Commission for Germany on de-Nazification. His work in de-Nazification led to his writing a book entitled 'Licensed Mass Murder - a sociopsychological study of some SS killers'. This was contributed to the Centre for Research in Collective Psychopathology at Sussex University. In 1946 Dicks was appointed the first Nuffield Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Leeds, but returned to the Tavistock in 1948, and remained there until 1965 as Deputy Director and Consultant Psychiatrist in charge of the Marital Unit. From 1966 to 1970 he was a Senior Research Officer at the Centre for Research in Collective Psychopathology, University of Sussex. In the late 1970s, he was the chair of the Campaign Against Psychiatric Abuse. He participated, with fellow campaigners ,in a protest outside the Soviet Embassy in London following the arrest of Vladimir Borisov.

It has been written by Pradeep Dalvi (Mauli productions). It is based on the book May It Please You Honour written by Gopal Godse. According to Karline McLain the play \\"enacts Godse's defense plea\\" and thus \\"explores the assassination of Gandhi and the trial of Godse from Godse's point of view. Staging and controversies In 1989 Dalvi was denied permission by the Maharashtra government to stage the play. The play was first staged in 1997. It ran 13 successful shows but was banned thereafter, by the governments of Maharashtra and Kerala. The producer approached the high court in 1998, which permitted staging the play in 2001. The Supreme Court upheld the high court's ruling. It was staged in Thane's auditorium Gadkari Rangayatan in April 2001 facing opposition from parties like Indian National Congress and Nationalist Congress Party; it was not presented again in Thane until 2011. An Indian Express news story quotes director Vinay Apte regarding the intimidation that artists connected with the play faced, such as the incident when the bus used by the artists while touring was set on fire by Indian National Congress activists in Mulund a suburb of Mumbai. Despite this 627 shows were staged in other cities. In February 2011, the play re-opened to a packed house at the same Gadkari Rangayatan, in Thane. Two platoons of state reserve police and 350 regular policemen under the direction of senior officers provided security. According to Tushar Gandhi, Gandhi's great-grandson, the play creates martyrs of murderers who after \\"murdering him (Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi) are now trying to murder his memory\\". It starred Sharad Ponkshe as Nathuram Godse. Criticism Both the play and its ban have been criticized by Shriram Lagoo a view which was considered representative of the views of other theater workers such as Vijay Tendulkar, Satyadev Dubey and Amol Palekar by The Times of India in its article Banning a play is not the solution. Civil liberties activists have opposed the ban though they consider the play \\"vicious\\". =Nathuramayan= Yashawant Dinkar Phadke in his book Nathuramayan has criticised Dalvi's play as presenting \\"distorted and falsified facts\\". Political activists opposing the play have urged Dalvi to answer questions put forward by Phadke in Nathuramayan.

Paulsen had been named \\"amateur champion of the world\\" following a series of victories in the United States in 1883 and 1884, and he was challenged by Dutch skater van der Zee. The competition was met with huge interest from the local population. A crowd of between 20,000 and 30,000 spectators witnessed the duel. The newspaper Morgenbladet published a special edition on the event. The duel was fought over a length of 3 English miles (4,827 meter). Paulsen won the race, finishing about one minute ahead of van der Zee. The prize money was to the winner. The organizing committee was headed by consul general Peter J. K. Petersen.

LOA provides one of the many alternate methodologies that enable the further exposure of software through a service- oriented architecture. Library orientation dictates the ontological boundaries of a library that exposes business functionality through a set of public APIs. Library Oriented Architecture further promotes practices similar to Modular Programming, and encourages the maintenance of internal libraries and modules with independent internal open-source life-cycles. This approach promotes good software engineering principles and patterns such as separation of concerns and designing to interfaces as opposed to implementations. Principles Three principles rule Library Oriented Architecture frameworks: # A software library implementation and subject area expertise must be constrained to only one ontology domain. # A software library that needs to use concepts and artifacts from a different ontology domain than the one it belongs to, must interface and reuse the library corresponding to that specific ontology domain. # All domain specific software libraries must be maintained and supported with separate life-cycles. Benefits Library Oriented Architecture may provide different process improvements to existing software engineering practices and software development life-cycle. Some tangible benefits from its adoption are: # Simplify configuration management of distributed systems. # Build highly reliable software systems because of the inherent properties and constraints of the LOA principles. # Information Systems built using LOA are technology-independent. These systems can easily replace or swap entire libraries and domain implementations with localized impact and minimal upstream ripple effect. # Increase the Maintainability Index of your distributed systems and integration repositories. # Minimize the risk of high coupling, this can be more evident on large enterprise systems. # Bring developers up to speed orders of magnitude more quickly than a traditional system. Move developers and teams across libraries and domain ontologies and collaborate seamlessly. # Spot bugs and zero-in on the problem almost instantly. There is something to be said about the amount of time a developer spends debugging. # Maximization of the Bus Factor of the software engineering team.

They began playing taiko in 1969 when a few third-generation Japanese Americans gathered after an Obon festival and had an impromptu experimental session on an odaiko drum. Naming themselves after the celestial musicians of Buddhist mythology, the Kinnara, Kinnara Taiko became the first Japanese American Buddhist taiko group. As a Buddhist group, Kinnara places more emphasis on participation, self-awareness and discovering the joy in ‚Äújust playing‚Äù taiko rather than stressing perfection and professionalism as other performance-focused taiko groups do. They contributed largely to the development of kumi-daiko in North America with their innovation of wine barrel drums and their extensive outreach to other Japanese American Buddhist communities in helping start other temple- based taiko groups. History Kinnara Taiko officially began in 1969 at the Jodo Shinshu Senshin Buddhist Temple (a member of the Buddhist Churches of America) in Los Angeles. After playing on a drum for hours the night of an Obon festival when Rev. Masao ‚ÄúMas‚Äù Kodani, who had been recently schooled in Japan, brought up the drum‚Äôs use in Japan, he and six other temple members decided to start a formal group based loosely on the pictures and recordings they had seen and heard of Japanese taiko players. Having only a single taiko drum and not enough money to purchase new authentic drums for the other players, the members of Kinnara began experimenting with inexpensive versions for their own drums. At first they used nail keg wooden barrels and tried to stretch leather over them for the drumheads, but soon upgraded to oak wine barrels and rawhide with much more success. They practiced in Senshin Temple and performed at both temple functions and public events, where they drew considerable crowds due to their uniqueness as one of the first taiko groups in the country. Throughout the 1970s Kinnara performed at various Buddhist temples across the United States and helped start taiko groups at many of them to help attract younger generations to become involved in temple life. These included performances in Palo Alto, California, at the Ginza Festival in Chicago, and many other places. The group has performed widely in the United States at schools and universities, multi-cultural folk festivals, Buddhist Temples and for Japanese American and Asian Pacific American organizations. Performances in the past have included The Olympic Arts Festival, Los Angeles; Memphis in May, Memphis, Tennessee; an Obon Festival in Charlotte, North Carolina; a Japanese Festival Celebration at the Morikami Museum in Delray Beach, Florida; and for Delta Air Lines in Atlanta, Georgia. Membership Kinnara‚Äôs membership consists mostly of Japanese Americans, although there is no exclusion in membership. All who are willing to play are welcomed, and most members are either affiliated with Senshin Temple or collegiate taiko players looking for a group to join. The original members of Kinnara were: Rev. Masao Kodani, George Abe, Johnny Mori, Clark Nakashita, Wilbur Takashima, George Yamashita, and May Sugano. Notable members who have played with Kinnara over the years and have since started other prominent taiko groups include: -Kenny Endo ‚Äì Taiko Center of the Pacific, Kenny Endo Taiko Ensemble -Etsuo Hongo ‚Äì Los Angeles Matsuri Taiko, Mugen Taiko, Koshin Taiko -Rev. Tom Kurai ‚Äì Taiko Center of Los Angeles, Satori Daiko, Shizen Daiko -Bruce Arikawa ‚Äì Togen Daiko Style Kinnara‚Äôs sound is based in the tradition of Japanese and Japanese American festival drumming, but they also blend these traditional Japanese rhythms with American musical influences from rock to jazz to R&B; to reflect the experience and lifestyles of its members in Southern California. In the beginning their original compositions were vague copies of the Japanese recordings and pictures they were given, but other influences were drawn from African music as well. Two of their main original pieces include Samsara, written by Johnny Mori, and Ashura, written by Rev. Kodani. Kinnara has a very informal style of practice and performance in comparison to most other kumidaiko groups. Kinnara seeks to include all those who wish to join their group regardless of age or ability. They encourage participation by anybody interested in both taiko or Buddhism, and keep their practices very informal with no organized routines or schedules. They do not have a teacher, and encourage collaboration on original compositions. Their pieces are taught by kuchi shoga. Connections and influences Throughout its long history, Kinnara's influence has touched many groups stretching from California, Colorado, Utah, Hawaii as well as groups in Chicago, New York, Minneapolis and Seattle.

Gallagher has written on a variety of subjects, mainly contemporary war fiction and non-fiction. He first became known for his war memoir Kaboom (2010), which tells of his and his scout platoon's experiences during the Iraq War. He works as a writing instructor at Words After War, a literary nonprofit devoted to bringing veterans and civilians together to study conflict literature. In 2015, Gallagher was featured in Vanity Fair alongside Elliot Ackerman, Maurice Decaul, Phil Klay, Kevin Powers and Brandon Willitts, as the voices of a new generation of American war literature. Among other media, he's appeared on CBS News Sunday Morning, PBS NewsHour, BBC News and NPR's \\"The Diane Rehm Show.\\" Gallagher was interviewed in September 2016 at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan by General (Retired) David H. Petraeus.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWZQOGjWiDQ&t;=6s In January 2017, Senator Elizabeth Warren read his Boston Globe op-ed \\"Trump Rejects the Muslims Who Helped Us\\" on the U.S. Senate Floor. Gallagher's debut novel Youngblood was published in February 2016 by Atria Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster. Youngblood has been met with widespread critical acclaim, receiving positive reviews and features in The New York Times, The Washington Post, Esquire, The Wall Street Journal and Vogue, and others. It was selected as a finalist for the 2016 Dayton Literary Peace Prize for fiction.http://daytonliterarypeaceprize.org/2016-finalists.htm Background and education Gallagher was born in Reno, Nevada, to attorneys Deborah Scott Gallagher and Dennis Gallagher. He and his brother Luke attended Brookfield School and Bishop Manogue High School, where Matt edited the school newspaper and ran cross country and track. He graduated in 2001. Gallagher then attended Wake Forest University in North Carolina. He joined Army ROTC the week before 9/11, and decided to honor this commitment after the September 11 attacks. While at Wake Forest, Gallagher was a member of Theta Chi Fraternity and served as the sports editor of the Old Gold & Black. He graduated in 2005 with a Bachelor of Arts Degree, commissioning into the U.S. Army as a second lieutenant in the Armor Branch. Military service Gallagher trained at Fort Knox, Kentucky, where he attended and graduated the Armor Officer Basic Course and Army Reconnaissance Course. He was subsequently assigned to the 2nd Brigade, 25th Infantry Division at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. He deployed with this unit in 2007 as a scout platoon leader with 2‚Äì14 Cavalry to Saba al- Bor, a sectarian village northwest of Baghdad. He was promoted to the rank of captain in July 2008, and was then reassigned to 1‚Äì27 Infantry, part of the famed 27th Infantry Regiment, where he served as a targeting officer. He and his unit returned to Schofield Barracks in February 2009, and Gallagher left the Army later that year. He earned the Combat Action Badge during his deployment to Iraq. =Kaboom= While deployed to Iraq, Gallagher wrote about his experiences there on a military blog. Kaboom: A Soldier's War Journal was a popular blog from November 2007 to June 2008, before it was shut down by the writer's military chain-of-command. Gallagher went by the pseudonym of LT G, wrote about the front-line experiences in the Iraq War as a United States Army soldier. A scout platoon leader, LT G often incorporated the trials and tribulations of his platoon in his writings, offering a brash and brutally honest perspective of modern warfare.Kaboom goes kaboom  Jay Bookman  ajc.com Kaboom was shut down, and subsequently deleted, after Gallagher made a post detailing his turning down of a promotion in an effort to stay with his soldiers. Before Kaboom was shut down, it was one of the few military blogs to garner attention and press coverage from the print media. This can be attributed to LT G's literary writing style. In a nationally published story chronicling the rise and fall of Kaboom, LT G was revealed to be Gallagher, who had been promoted to captain soon after his blog was shut down. Writing career After leaving the Army, Gallagher moved to New York City and wrote his war memoir, Kaboom: Embracing the Suck in a Savage Little War, which was published in April 2010 by Da Capo Press. It received much critical acclaim. Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times praised Gallagher for \\"his love of language, acquired as an avid reader, and his elastic voice as a writer ‚Äì his ability to move effortlessly between the earnest and the irreverent, the thoughtful and the comic.\\" In The Wall Street Journal, Bing West wrote that \\"Understanding that comedy best captures the irony of the human condition, Mr. Gallagher pokes fun at himself, his soldiers and those above him ... Without a trace of sentimentality, Mr. Gallagher draws the reader into the everyday complexities of leading soldiers from every strata of American society ... Mr. Gallagher is too modest, and too ironic, to tout his own accomplishments, so I'll do it for him: He is a classic representative of the U.S. military, a force that imposed its will, both physical and moral, to shatter al Qaeda.\\" Post-Kaboom, Gallagher has written for a variety of magazines and publications, to include The Atlantic, Boston Review, The New York Times and Wired. He graduated from Columbia University with an MFA in fiction in 2013. Gallagher and Roy Scranton co-edited Fire and Forget: Short Stories from the Long War (Da Capo, 2013), an anthology of literary fiction by veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan. Fire and Forget featured an introduction by National Book Award Winner Colum McCann, and stories by Colby Buzzell, David Abrams, Phil Klay, Siobhan Fallon, Gavin Kovite, Jacob Siegel, and others. The New York Daily News wrote that \\"Some of America's greatest works of literature have come from its wars. Be it Stephen Crane, E.L. Doctorow, Ernest Hemingway, Norman Mailer, Joseph Heller, Thomas Pynchon, James Jones or Tim O'Brien, war has been memorialized, glorified, satirized and revealed in all its valor and depredation ... Now, as another comes to a close, a new generation of authors will come forward to define themselves through their own fictional narratives. Among the finest have been enlisted in Fire and Forget.\\" Gallagher will appear on an episode of the new Lit Hub/Podglomerate Storybound (podcast), accompanied by original musical composition from singer-songwriter Colin Hogan.  Youngblood  In September 2014, Atria/Simon & Schuster acquired Gallagher's first novel, Youngblood, from ICM Partners. Published February 2016, Youngblood received early endorsements from authors Richard Ford, Tim O'Brien, Ben Fountain, Claire Vaye Watkins and Phil Klay, among others, as well as starred reviews from trade publications Kirkus Reviews and Booklist. It was named an Amazon Best Book of the Month, selected to The Millions Most Anticipated of 2016, and chosen by iBooks as a \\"What We're Reading\\" selectee. Reviewing for The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote of Youngblood, \\"On one level, the novel is a parable ‚Äì with overtones of Graham Greene's The Quiet American ‚Äì about the United States and Iraq and the still unfurling consequences of the war ... Mr. Gallagher has a keen reportorial eye, a distinctive voice and an instinctive sympathy for the people he is writing about ... [This] is an urgent and deeply moving novel.\\" In The Washington Post, Roxana Robinson called the novel \\"\\"Layered and complex ... [this is ] smart, fierce and important writing. In Youngblood, Matt Gallagher shows again how war works in the human heart.\\" The Daily Beast described Youngblood as \\"America's first great work of reckoning.\\" And The Australian raved over the book, saying, \\"\\"Every so often a debut novel charges past the suburban stories tapped out in coffee shops and announces itself as a literary event. Matt Gallagher's Youngblood is one of these books ... [Gallagher's] descriptions of combat's aftermath ‚Äì quiet and taught with pathos ‚Äì remind me of Siegfried Sassoon. Violent, intelligent, and beautiful, Youngblood is one of the best novels to come out of America's 21st-century wars, with an authority that eclipses most debuts and a literary talent that announces a commanding writer.\\"' Youngblood has also received positive reviews or been featured in Esquire, The Wall Street Journal and Vogue, among others.Youngblood was selected as a finalist for the 2016 Dayton Literary Peace Prize for fiction.  Empire City  Gallager's second novel, Empire City, received mixed reviews. Publisher's Weekly called the book, which is set in an alternate present where the United States won the Vietnam War, \\"ambitious but flawed.\\" Kirkus Reviews was far more positive, calling it \\"a keen extrapolation of a country launched down a radically altered historical continuum\\" and cited Gallagher's evolved and \\"elaborate\\" prose as a strength of the book.https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/matt-gallagher/empire-city/ Marine veteran Peter Lucier of The Strategy Bridge called the novel \\"a triumph,\\" and argued it shouldn't be read as war literature but as part of a \\"much broader canon of American and [anti-]imperial literature ... a stunning, short-paragraphed powerhouse that is both eminently readable as a thriller but can also bear the weight of a deep, close reading of the symbolism, rich with interpretative possibility and bold style choices.\\"https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/6/30/reviewing-empire- city Select bibliography = Essays, reviews and stories = * \\"Pilgrim's Progress The New York Times, January 2011 * \\"The Hut Next Door,\\" The New York Times, May 2011 * \\"Where's the Great Novel About the War on Terror?\\" The Atlantic, June 2011 * \\"A Ghost on Tobacco Road,\\" The Classical, February 2012 * \\"After the Slaughter,\\" Boston Review, March 2012 * \\"A Night in the Divide,\\" The Daily Beast, April 2013 * \\"Transcending the Archetypes of War: an Interview with Phil Klay,\\" The Paris Review, March 2014 * \\"New York City Cop Cold War,\\" The Daily Beast, December 2014 * Forty Years After the Fall: Vietnam War Lit in 2015, Los Angeles Review of Books, April 2015 * \\"One Man's Mad Journey to the Big Buck Hunter Championship,\\" Wired, May 2015 * \\"Back Home Then, Back Home Now,\\" Boston Globe, January 2016 * \\"Welcome to the Age of the Commando,\\" New York Times, January 2016 * \\"Ernie and Me: Educations in Hemingway,\\" The Paris Review, February 2016 * \\"Michael Herr: 1940 ‚Äì 2016,\\" The Paris Review, June 2016 * \\"\\"Babylon\\",\\" Playboy, July 2016 * \\"Know Your Enemy,\\" Wired, December 2016 * \\"\\"Trump Rejects the Muslims who Helped Us\\",\\" Boston Globe, January 2017 = Books = * Kaboom: Embracing the Suck in a Savage Little War, Da Capo Press, March 2010. * Fire & Forget: Short Stories from the Long War [coeditor and contributor], Da Capo Press, February 2013. * Youngblood: A Novel, Atria/Simon & Schuster, February 2016. * Empire City, Atria, April 2020.

Written by Ross Maxwell and directed by Paris Barclay, the episode aired on Fox in the United States on April 24, 2012. It is a special tribute episode to Whitney Houston, who died ten weeks earlier (February 11), and features seven of her songs. Upon its initial airing, this episode attracted 6.90 million American viewers and received a 2.7/8 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, an increase of over 10% from the 2.4/7 rating/share and 6.23 million viewers of the previous episode, \\"Saturday Night Glee-ver\\", which was broadcast on April 17, 2012. Plot Will (Matthew Morrison) notices that several of the glee club members are still dejected two months after the death of Whitney Houston. School counselor Emma (Jayma Mays) explains that they are focusing on the pain of Whitney's death so that they do not have to think on the pain of leaving their friends after graduation. Will makes their assignment for the week a tribute to Houston. While shopping for sheet music in preparation for his performance, Kurt (Chris Colfer) meets Chandler (Justin Castor), a student from another school, who helps him choose a song. The two exchange telephone numbers, and later Chandler sends flirtatious text messages to Kurt, who responds to them positively. Kurt sees the exchanges as innocent, but his boyfriend Blaine (Darren Criss) sees it as cheating. The two get into an argument, and Blaine sings \\"It's Not Right but It's Okay\\" to express his feelings. Later, Kurt and his father Burt (Mike O'Malley) discuss Kurt's future in New York. Burt tells Kurt that he misses the boy that Kurt used to be. Kurt then sings \\"I Have Nothing\\" to express his regrets to Blaine. Following a counseling session with Emma, Blaine reveals that he has been distant because he's deeply distressed at the thought of Kurt moving to New York, and how it will affect their relationship. The two make up. Brittany (Heather Morris) and Santana (Naya Rivera) sing \\"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\\", inviting the rest of the club to dance with them during the performance. Quinn (Dianna Agron), still wheelchair-bound from her car accident, refuses to participate, and reveals to Joe (Samuel Larsen) that she is depressed because she has not been making progress in her physical therapy sessions; Joe responds by offering to accompany Quinn to her physical therapy. They then sing a duet of \\"Saving All My Love for You\\", but Quinn believes Joe is not interested in a relationship because she is disabled. At another physical therapy session, Joe and Quinn discuss their ambiguous relationship, and decide that it is \\"something new\\". Will hires a wedding planner (Joel McKinnon Miller) for his upcoming wedding with Emma. After some disagreement over the logistics behind planning a wedding a month away, Will fires the wedding planner and admits that he wants to get married before the glee club members go their separate ways; Emma assures him that no matter when they decide to get married, the glee club would be there. After performing \\"So Emotional\\" with Santana, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) realizes that she and Santana could have been friends instead of the enemies they were for most of their high school years; they agree to be friends. Puck (Mark Salling), meanwhile, thanks the male glee club members for always being his friend when he was not always a friend to them. New Directions then spontaneously gathers in the auditorium and sings \\"My Love Is Your Love\\". Production \\"Dance with Somebody\\" is the second episode in the third season to be directed by Paris Barclay, and the second to be written by Ross Maxwell. The episode began shooting on March 8, 2012, only 25 days after Whitney Houston's death, and concluded shooting a week later on March 15, 2012. The next episode began shooting in parallel on March 12, 2012. The same day that shooting began, it was reported that the episode would be a tribute to Whitney Houston and feature her songs, though \\"not be a typical tribute\\" as the show had previously done for artists but rather a \\"character piece\\". Recurring guest stars appearing in the episode include Kurt's father Burt Hummel (O'Malley) and glee club members Sam Evans (Overstreet) and Joe Hart (Larsen). Former glee club member Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton) is seen in a still photograph near the end of the episode. Seven of Houston's songs are featured in the episode, and all have been released as singles available for digital download. These songs are \\"How Will I Know\\" in an a cappella version sung by Riley, Rivera, Colfer and Michele, \\"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\\", \\"Saving All My Love for You\\", \\"So Emotional\\", \\"It's Not Right but It's Okay\\", \\"I Have Nothing\\" and \\"My Love Is Your Love\\".

A clitoral photoplethysmograph is a small clear acrylic device that contains a light source, and a light detector. The light source illuminates the capillary bed of the clitoral tissue and the blood circulating within it. As clitoral engorgement increases, more light is reflected into the photosensitive cell of the device. The clitoral photoplethysmograph is placed by the participant between the labia minora; the light detector is oriented toward the clitoris. It can be attached to a vaginal photoplethysmograph so that both CBV and vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) can be measured simultaneously.

In contrast to vaginal photoplethysmography, clitoral photoplethysmographs are sensitive to the inhibition of sexual response. The authors suggest that clitoral photoplethysmography is particularly informative for examining sexual inhibition. Some researchers have posited that the procedure might be a viable instrument for assessing female sex offenders.Schlank, Anita, Saprina Matheny, and Jessica Schilling. \\"Overview of Assessment of Sexual Offenders.\\" Sexual Offending.

Since 22 September 2015, she has been the Bishop of Newcastle. She was Archdeacon of Lewisham from 2001 to 2008, then Archdeacon of Lewisham & Greenwich from 2008 to 2012. Early life and education Hardman was educated at Queen Elizabeth's School for Girls, then an all-girls' grammar school in Barnet, London. She studied economics at Woolwich Polytechnic (now the University of Greenwich), and graduated from the University of London with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in 1973. After this, she worked as an articled clerk and with an estate agency. She later studied Applied Theology at Westminster College, Oxford, and graduated with a Master of Theology (MTh) degree in 1994. Hardman trained for ordained ministry on a part-time basis with the St Albans Ministry Course (this later merged to become the present day Eastern Region Ministry Course). She is the first Church of England diocesan bishop to have been trained on a part-time course rather than at a residential theological college. Ordained ministry Hardman was licensed as a deaconess at Michaelmas 1984 (30 September) by John Taylor, Bishop of St Albans, at St Albans Cathedral, and served at St John the Baptist, Markyate Street in the Diocese of St Albans from 1984 to 1987. She was made a deacon on 9 May 1987, by John Taylor, Bishop of St Albans, at St John's, Chipping Barnet. She then served as Parish Deacon of St John's for a year. From 1988 to 1991, she was a tutor on the St Albans Ministerial Training Scheme. She served as Course Director of the St Albans and Oxford Ministry Course from 1991 to 1996. She was ordained as a priest in 1994; the first year that the Church of England ordained women to the priesthood. She returned to St John the Baptist, Marykate Street to serve her curacy between 1994 and 1996. Hardman was then Vicar of Holy Trinity and Christ the King, Stevenage from 1996 to 2001, as well as Rural Dean of Stevenage from 1999 to 2001. She was then Archdeacon of LewishamSouthwark Anglican (the title of the post changed to Archdeacon of Lewisham & Greenwich in 2008) until her retirement from the post on 30 November 2012. She then became an assistant priest at Southwark Cathedral and held the title of archdeacon-emeritus. She has been a Member of the General Synod of the Church of England since 1998, with a brief break, and was the Prolocutor of the Lower House of the Convocation of Canterbury in the last synod 2010‚Äì2015; as a diocesan bishop she automatically became a member of the synod once again in the House of Bishops. On the synod, she has served on the following committees: Eucharistic Prayers Revision Committee, the Dioceses and Pastoral Measures Review Group, and the Ethical Investment Advisory Group. She was involved in the legislation which allowed women to become bishops in the Church of England. =Episcopal ministry= On 2 September 2015, it was announced that Hardman was to become the twelfth Bishop of NewcastleDiocese of Newcastle ‚Äî Christine Hardman to be Twelfth Bishop of Newcastle (Accessed 2 September 2015) ‚Äî the second woman to be a diocesan bishop in the Church of England and the first in the Province of York. She became the Bishop of Newcastle when her canonical election was confirmed on 22 September 2015 at York Minster. On 30 November 2015, she was consecrated a bishop by John Sentamu, Archbishop of York, during a service at York Minster. On 12 December, a service of inauguration was held at Newcastle Cathedral during which she was enthroned as Bishop of Newcastle. Upon the retirement on 30 September 2015 of Jonathan Gledhill, Bishop of Lichfield, a seat in the House of Lords became vacant. With the passing of the Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015, the vacancy had to be filled by a woman if one were eligible. As Hardman's confirmation of election had taken place eight days earlier, she became eligible. On 18 November 2015, she officially joined the House of Lords as a Lord Spiritual but tradition dictates that she would only take her place once she had participated in an introduction ceremony. She was introduced to the House of Lords on 26 January 2016, and made her maiden speech on 25 May 2016. Personal life In 1971, at the age of 19, she married Roger; they now have two adult daughters and four grandchildren.Thinking Anglicans blog.

In 1896, an anarchist attacked the Corpus Christi procession, which had left the Church of Santa Maria del Mar of Barcelona, killing twelve people and created panic in the city. The fact was part of the turbulent social landscape in the Catalonia of the early 20th century, dominated by anarchist bombings like this or that had taken place in Gran Teatre del Liceu four years earlier. Casas chooses to paint the time of departure of the procession from the church, before passing on the Canvis Nous street, where the attack took place.  Style  As in his work El garrot vil, the scene is framed from a perspective of height and the painter delights in the play of colors and festive banners, apricots hung from balconies and the veils of girls dressed in their first Communion gowns accompanying the procession, alluding elliptically shaped into chaos and despair that will occur soon after and what their characters are outsiders. The technique, very loose, rapid brushwork and lightly loaded material, is typical of small format paintings, but it is much more difficult to implement in a painting of this size. Casas applies, once again, with great daring, the resources of modern painting in a genre that seemed forbidden.  References  * Do√±ate, Merc√®; Mendoza, Cristina: Ramon Casas.

She became influential during the 1960s and 1970s with the youthful and psychedelic style of her illustrations. She was one of the first female commercial illustrator/designers in the United States. Her 1967 poster for the New York City club Electric Circus is considered a milestone of 20th century graphic design. Biography She studied at Pratt Institute, graduating with a BFA, and Hunter College, City University of New York, where she earned an MA degree. Morgan originally worked in textile design. She travelled to Europe, and returned to the United States after a year. She began working as a free- lance illustrator in New York City in 1963. Career In 1967, Morgan produced a poster for the New York City nightclub Electric Circus, which was part of the counter-culture scene in the East Village neighborhood in Manhattan. Electric Circus was frequented by Andy Warhol, The Velvet Underground, and was the home of the Exploding Plastic Inevitable. Morgan, working in concentrated watercolor, ink, and coloured pencil, had developed a style she would describe as \\"anthropomorphic double-images\\". Surreal juxtapositions, bright rainbow-like colour patterns, nude figures, and curved lines are characteristic of her works. She produced a poster for Electric Circus that became influential in the graphic design world, and Morgan became in high demand as an illustrator. Following the poster for Electric Circus, Morgan worked on commissions for clients as diverse as financial services firms and the United Nations. She created illustrations for newspaper and magazine advertising, posters, calendars, magazine covers, record album covers, books, book covers, and billboards. Morgan created the iconic poster for Year of the Woman 1971. Other iconic posters include the 1973 poster for the American Optometric Association, Purina, The Joy of Seeing which was copied on several occasions for clothing and a book cover. Billboards include Celanese, Thai Air, 7up, Swedish Tanning Secret, Exxon, and Ritz Disco. Calendars include those done for Nissan, has also done several Broadway show posters including Wine Spectator and Wines of Spain. Morgan became a prominent female illustrator/designer at a time when they were a rarity. For several years she was one of only three full-time female illustrators in the United States, along with Barbara Nessim and Lorraine Fox. In recent decades, she has produced a number of works in an exaggerated hyper realism using color to push volume and depth with her focus on figurative works done from life. With a partner, she launched a line of clothing, including T-shirts, jackets, and dresses incorporating silk-screen and airbrush designs under the name \\"Mag Jac\\". Morgan taught at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. Her watercolor classes drew students from a wide variety of backgrounds and ages. Her last personal work was painting the nude from life. Morgan also worked as a watercolour artist. In 1986, she published the book Watercolour for Illustration. She has also published Jacqui Morgan's Journey (2007); MOSTLY NUDE: Watercolors from Life (2010); and ALMOST NUDE: Watercolors from Life (2011). Death She died July 3, 2013 in her Queens, New York residence.

He joined Mellencamp's band in 1979 and toured with Mellencamp for over two years. He recorded with the band only on Mellencamp's 1980 album Nothin' Matters and What If It Did and on American Fool in 1982, before leaving the band. Rosser is infamous for being on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's \\"Ten Most Wanted Fugitives\\" list for his involvement in the production and distribution of child pornography in 2000. He had been living in Bangkok at the time and had been on the run due to a failure to appear. He was arrested in August 2001 for carrying false information, and was extradited back to the United States. Background Rosser was born in Syracuse, New York to Donna, a watercolor artist, and Richard Rosser, a retired Air Force Colonel and retired DePauw University president. He attended Air Academy High School in Colorado, and graduated from London Central High School, a USAF-run school located in Bushy, UK in 1970. Eric Rosser got his bachelor's degree in music from Oberlin in 1974, and a master's degree from Indiana University in 1979. Rosser lived in Bloomington, Indiana until the early 1990s, when he moved to Thailand and began giving piano lessons to students who would become among his victims. Between August 1995 and August 1997, Rosser frequently visited Bloomington from Thailand, and during these visits Rosser victimized three American girls, aged 9 to 11 years old. Conviction In April 2000, Rosser was indicted by a federal grand jury in Indianapolis and fled to Thailand. He was sentenced to over 16 years after an investigation revealed he had recorded himself sexually assaulting a young girl, and then traded it to an Indiana man for different pornographic material. As of 2012, Rosser was incarcerated at FCI Butner Low.\\"Eric Franklin Rosser.\\" (Archive). Federal Bureau of Prisons. Retrieved on May 18, 2012. He was released on January 13, 2017. Release and new charges In July 2017, Rosser was caught watching child pornography as he fled Washington state on a bus, with $10,000 strapped to each of his legs, a bag with $50,000, and $1000 worth of cannabis. He pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Missoula. He admitted that he was fleeing federal probation. Rosser pleaded guilty to accessing the internet with intent to view child pornography after signing a plea agreement with prosecutors in October 2018. According to court documents filed by federal prosecutors, Rosser was riding on a bus from Butte to Billings in July 2017 when another man noticed child pornography on his screen. When the man approached Rosser about it, he reportedly said, \\"Leave me alone. I know I have a problem\\", according to court documents. The fellow passenger called Billings police to the bus station, and when they arrived, Rosser admitted to looking at the images of young girls engaging in sexually explicit conduct. Police also found he had $10,000 in cash strapped to each leg, along with $50,000 in cash in his luggage and approximately $1,000 worth of marijuana, which he told police he purchased for personal use, according to court records. Rosser additionally admitted to violating his probation conditions and fleeing federal supervision in Washington state, court documents say. He said he had emptied his bank account and fled to avoid going back to prison. Rosser told U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeremiah Lynch he did not dispute any of the information brought forth by federal prosecutors. Lynch said he would be sentenced to a minimum of 10 years and may be on supervised release for the rest of his life following the prison term. His sentencing was set for January 17, 2019. On February 21, 2020, Rosser was sentenced to ten years in prison, and to permanent supervision if he is ever released. He's now at FCI Englewood in Colorado with BOP Number 07006-028.

The main goals are to glorify actions of the drug cartels and their lifestyle, gain control of the Mexican society to the highest extent possible, and to recruit new, educated, high class members to increase their power even further. These drug cartels use of propaganda and scare tactics are used in precise, complex and clever ways to get the most out of every action, resulting in their enormous power. The cartels have adopted the word \\"narco\\" to pertain to anything relating to the cartels, and it has spread to be a part of everyday Mexican slang. Narcocultura is the criminal culture of the drug cartels. There are music, television shows, literature, beverages, food, and architecture that all have been branded \\"narco\\". Narcorridos are Mexican country songs glorifying the lifestyles of drug lords. They are typically produced by artists working with or being paid by Mexican drug lords. Cartels hang narco-banners up around cities to advertise themselves and threaten rival cartels. They also distribute narco-flyers, used for the same purposes as the narco-banners, by handing them out to people, scattering and posting them around cities, and leaving them near the bodies of homicide victims. A brand of beer, Malverde Beer, was named after a Mexican folklore character revered by drug traffickers, and the patron saint of drug trafficking. The drug cartels' use of propaganda through new media has increased significantly as the primary source of connection with the people. It's seen as a war tactic against the Mexican government, taking its people and putting them against themselves. Many times cartels use bribery or threats against journalists and publications to report the cartels in a good light. They also bribe or threaten members of the local law enforcement to look the other way when drug trafficking crimes are committed. Blog Del Narco was a blog that reported the true violence and nature of the drug war and drug cartels. It would report news often censored from other publications. It was shut down by the government after threats were made by cartels in the form of a message left on the bodies of two unidentified homicide victims. There is activism against the influence of the drug cartels. Local police and the country's military work actively to prevent drug trafficking, discouraging recruits into drug cartels. Propaganda The drug war has become rich with examples of propaganda and other means of psychological warfare. Cartels use high impact, often dramatic communication methods to threaten opponents, announce new policies, and, most importantly, to seek grassroot support. Through fear mongering, they have established themselves as dangerous to those who speak out against them. They provide simple public services to citizens and act as protectors from the government while covering their true motives. Deceased drug gangsters have often been honored with tombs of ivory with elaborate paintings to illustrate their contribution and alliance to a particular cartel. Cartels have seeped into everyday life as civilians pass by walls of graffiti and road signs with digital media employing cartel public relations. There is now a ‚Äúnarco‚Äù vocabulary describing cartel related music, literature, and daily television shows. In addition, there are narcocastillos (castles) and even narcocerveza (beer). One particular brewery in Guadalajara created Malverde Beer, which was named after the patron saint of drug traffickers, Jesus Malverde. Smugglers (or mules) have been known to carry a picture of the saint with them during their operations. Although the Mexican brewery stated it was not meant to glamorize cartels, many have criticized it and Walmarts in Mexico refuse to distribute it.Hawley, Chris. ‚ÄúBeer‚Äôs Outlaw Image Leaves Bad Taste in Critics‚Äô Mouths.‚Äù USAtoday, September 3, 2008. https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-09-03-narcobeer_N.htm. Some of the narcoliterature include books such as \\"El Amante de Janis Joplin\\", and \\"Nostalgia de la Sobra.\\" Also, there are narcomantas (e.g. threats or explanations of criminal activity, left on a cloth banner), narcoblockades, narcomanifestaciones (demonstrations) and narcocorridos. =Music= Narcocorridos Narcocorridos are a type of music that glamourizes the lifestyle of drug lords. It is country style music usually including instruments such as tubas and accordions. The music and music videos are widely popular. The music video, El Movimiento alterado, describing the Sinaloa cartel's drug violence, received three million hits on YouTube. Sample lyrics: The group Los Tucanes de Tijuana has now been banned from the city of Tijuana for having a close relationship with a drug cartel. Their songs contain lyrics such as: In a song titled, \\"La Familia Michoacana\\" lyrics are as follows: Examples of narcocorridos from artist Mario \\"El Chachorro\\" Delgado include: The song titled, \\"El Mercenario\\", have the following lyrics: These are a few examples of the narco-corridos.  Narco Hip-Hop  A music scene, similar to the early underground gangsta-rap scene, has emerged in northeastern Mexico (Nuevo Le√≥n, Tamaulipas and Coahuila), where the musical phenomenon of hip-hop is being co-opted by the influence of organized crime and the drug war in the region. With lyrics similar to those of a narcocorrido (drug ballad), has appeared the Mexican Narco-rap. However, unlike the corridos, which relate to rural regions of the Mexican Pacific (and which are generally linked to the Sinaloa cartel) the narco-rap emerged in the urban area of Tamaulipas, in the border with Texas, a turf currently under armed dispute between the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel. Derived from the constant presence of \\"halcones\\" (\\"hawks\\", cartel spies) and cartel-convoys circulating the streets of the region, young people have been involved in the local narcoculture, and narco-raps express the reality of life on the streets, of those cities under the drug cartels rule. There are several notable cases, among them is a song called \\"The Song of Metro 3\\" that praises the life and exploits of drug lord Samuel Flores Borrego (alias Metro 3) for his \\"ferocity and loyalty\\". Some of the main exponents of the genre are Cano y Blunt, DemenT and Big Los. =Other Media= The drug cartels have been successful at influencing and manipulating the information environment by issuing their own press releases, controlling the content released about them and violence associated, and threatening journalists. They have managed to control who their audiences are, how they are perceived to them, and ultimately their actions or omission of actions. They have purchased several newspapers and recruited reporters within which they can control.Sullivan, John. \\"Cartel Info Ops: Power and Counter-power in Mexico‚Äôs Drug War\\". www.MountainRunner.us, November 15, 2010. http://mountainrunner.us/2010/11/cartel_info_ops_power_and_counter- power_in_mexico_drug_war/. In addition to influencing indigenous reporting, United States‚Äô reporters have stopped covering the drug war and cartel violence as well. U.S. news directors and editors discourage their reporters to cover certain drug related stories.Fleming, Gary \\"Rusty\\". Drug Wars: Narco Warfare in the 21st Century. BookSurge Publishing, 2008 In September 2011, at least sixty undocumented migrants, including children were kidnapped in Veracruz.Martinez-Amador, David. ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòZeta Killers‚Äô and the Rise of Narco- Horror.‚Äù Insightcrime.org, September 29, 2011. http://www.insightcrime.org/insight-latest-news/item/1641-the-zeta-killers- and-the-rise-of-narco-horror. The cartels have had to adjust to the challenges in dominating the information environment in a time when the internet and advanced computer networks have been used against them. Some cartels have ‚Äúhired operational security specialist (narcohackers) to cope with the enhanced digital surveillance of their activities.‚ÄùSullivan, John, and Adam Elkus. ‚ÄúMexican Drug Lords Vs. Cybervigilantes and the Social Media.‚Äù Mexidata.info, March 5, 2012. http://www.mexidata.info/id3288.html. As websites or social media have attempted to shine light on their activities, the cartels respond by threatening execution found on their social post or tweets. They also have been using websites to spread disinformation about their rivals and government officials. = Propaganda by cartel=  Ju√°rez Cartel  Narcomantas were placed attempting to antagonize U.S. government agencies around Juarez. The threats included using vehicle IEDs against the U.S. consulates which would be carried out by La Linea, Ju√°rez's cartel enforcer group. However, it is possible \\"that a rival group deliberately misattributed these threats to La Linea in an effort to incite U.S. reprisal\\".\\"Mexico Security Memo: A New Juarez Cartel\\". Stratfor, January 1, 2012. http://stratfor.com/analysis/mexico-security-memo-new-juarez-cartel. Knights Templar  The Knights Templar cartel cast themselves as defenders of the people,\\"Drug Gang Unveils Banners in Mexico Ahead of Pope Visit\\". Associated Press, February 7, 2012. http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/02/07/drug-gang-unveils-banners-in-mexico- ahead-pope-visit/. blaming federal and local authorities for drug violence casualties because of their lack of protection for the citizens especially from Knights Templar's rival, Los Zetas. They said \\"they would stand down its own operations if the government secured the state; so the government could no longer use it as a pretext for abusing residents\\". When the pope went to visit in 2011, the Knights Templar made hand painted, clothe narcobanners asking the violence to cease while he visited. Knights Templar propaganda maintains a soft tone to civilians, however when they murder gang rivals, they use a much more aggressive approach. Right before the Pope was scheduled his 2011 visit, eight people were found killed with narcomantas placed upon them warning rivals to stay out of their territory while the Pope was visiting.\\"Mexico Security Memo: Increased Violence Likely in Guanajuato\\". Stratfor, February 22, 2012. http://stratfor.com/analysis/mexico-security-memo-increased- violence-likely-guanajuato. Los Zetas  Los Zetas have used the Internet and media to spread most of their propaganda and to glorify their lifestyle. There have been numerous YouTube videos of assassinations, torture scenes, and interrogations. Although these posts are quickly taken down, most of them are likely to have been seen and reposted somewhere else. When they discover individuals, blogs, or media speaking out against them on the Internet, they retaliate with violence. In September 2011, two people were found hanging from a bridge with a huge narcomanta containing the words \\"Internet Snitches\\". The banner was addressed to two particular blog sites that were being used to report uncensored stories about cartel violence.Pachico, Elyssa. \\"Mexican Drug War Blog Hit by Govt Intervention\\" Insightcrime.org, October 21, 2011. http://insightcrime.org/insight-latest- news/item/1764-mexican-drug-war-blog-hit-by-govt-intervention. In addition, the administrator of the chat site, Nuevo Laredo en Vivo, which is used to share safety and security information, was killed and decapitated. The Zetas have launched public relations campaigns through local media outlets. They determine what stories are run and threaten those who do not comply. Many reporters have been murdered and threatened, as a result the Zetas threats are taken seriously. Members of the cartel also write their own stories which are published in the papers. Their stories of disinformation include ones that discredit the Mexican army, spreading rumors about human rights abuses and exaggerating any misdemeanors by the government forces.O'Connor, Mike. \\"Analysis: A PR Department for Mexico's Narcos\\". GlobalPost, November 5, 2010. http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/worldview/101026/mexico-drug-war-cartels- newspapers. \\"Demands to run propaganda will increase and content more extreme, and newspapers that run stories will go from being silent on the matter of organized crime control to being agents of disinformation helping organized crime strengthen its control over the reign.\\" They do, however, write positive stories about local police forces, most of which are working with the Zetas in some fashion. The Zetas have infiltrated local government by bribing officers, controlling how local authorities are perceived by civilians within Zeta territory. They keep the public ignorant therefore most people trust the officers who are actually working side-by-side with the cartel. =Recruitment strategies= Adding and maintaining membership is key to winning the drug war. As a result of this, cartels rely on propaganda and other psychological warfare tactics to gain support and recruit new members. Cartels are extremely good at targeting high-value individuals such as police officers and border agents. These recruits are important to narco operations for they provide knowledge on vulnerabilities within the system, personnel and they are usually well trained in weapons and some even trained in torture techniques. \\"They are the protective shields for drug lords and neutralizing any real government action.\\"Payan, Tony. The Three U.S.-Mexico Border Wars: Drugs, Immigration, and Homeland Security. Praeger, 2006, p. 40. Cartels benefit particularly from American recruits so they devote much of their resources to US officials. Americans blend in well, speak perfect English, and are familiar with the terrain, roads and local customs. One border agent that can turn away from an operation can have significant long-term effects. Cartels also recruit \\"straw buyers\\", individuals that do not have prior criminal records to buy weapons from licensed dealers. Some buyers are housewives, mothers, cousins, kids, elderly and any families that are less suspicious. They are usually paid $100 a weapon or more.\\"ATF Busts Real Housewives Buying Guns for Cartels\\". Fox News Latino, September 2, 2011. http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2012/02/09/atf-busts-gun-running-moms- in-texas/. As a new method of recruiting smugglers, cartels in Tijuana have been tricking citizens into working for them. They post \\"help wanted\\" posters throughout the city and ads in the classified section of newspapers asking for help with a small errand of driving a car to California to serve an important business organization. The drivers are usually unaware that they are smuggling drugs hidden in the car. Even if the job seems suspicious, the ad respondents follow simple instructions for a quick payment of about $500.Dibble, Sandra. \\"U.S. Says Beware of Ads Placed by Drug Traffickers\\". UT San Diego, April 9, 2012. http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/apr/09/us-agency-warns-against- tijuana-want-ads-placed-dr/. One of the cartels most pressed targets are the young; they can take a poor, undereducated kid and give them power and money. Cartels attack the education system and its inability to produce role models, idols, or opportunities for young adults. Cartels provide an alternative for the kids by joining the narcoculture and protracting it as life of money, power, respect, expensive cars, and exciting lifestyle.Beckhusen, Robert. \\"Que Malo, Narcos! Mexico Attacks Cartels With Comics\\". Wired, September 9, 2011. https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/09/mexico-attacks-cartels-with-comics/. They advertise entry-level positions, paying $500 a week. These positions are filled by people that are on average 16 years old. Kids are \\"cheap and expendable\\"\\"Children Hired to Work as 'Mules' by Mexican Drug Gangs\\".

They use them as \\"mules\\" to carry drugs over the border and act as look-outs during operations. If caught, minors who are detained receive significantly shorter sentences than adults and are likely to return to the cartels after being released. Los Zetas give kids an additional opportunity. Being a cartel with experience in paramilitary operations, they give young recruits the opportunity to join a training program much like a military boot camp. The recruits can start with operational training in surveillance and then can move up to an assassination training program. Kids that sign up are taught weaponry, martial arts, hand- to-hand combat techniques and precision targeting. They even encourage the trainees to enter paintballing contests and tournaments, asking them to report their scores. They are taught SERE (survival, evasion, resistance, and escape) methods, torture techniques and how to withstand torture, and aggressive vehicle driving skills including how to escape and drive while limiting collateral damage. In addition, cartels have offered college scholarships to students who wish to study criminal justice, law degrees, encouraging students to become judges and go into law enforcement. They also encourage computer science or other technological related disciplines. Because of this recruitment success, \\"cartels are now more professionalized, hiring highly educated individuals who serve as public relations officers that recruit help of other professionals, including accountants, businessmen to lend money, law enforcement officers, doctors, and lawyers\\". Counter propaganda Although journalists are being attacked and threatened for reporting, those that do report were asked to censor their stories so as to not popularize the cartel violence. Media outlets have agreed to follow measures to \\"avoid turning criminals into heroes or victims, as this helps build support with the populations\\".Stone, Hannah. \\"Mexico Media Pact Marks PR Battle in Drug War\\". Insightcrime.org, March 29, 2011. . Journalist were urged to do anything in their power to not become an avenue or an inadvertent spokesperson for the cartels. Because of this, violence and cartel activities were being ignored so independent sources took it upon themselves to report on the drug war. These \\"cybervigilantes\\" use online media such as Twitter, blogs, and YouTube which have become powerful tools to spread information about the narcoculture. In 2012 the Anonymous group starting unveiling names of cartel members and sympathizers but the effort quickly faded away. El Blog Del Narco and Mundo Narco were popular uncensored sites tracking cartel violence, gang uniforms, expansions and movements, tactics, and weapons of choice. Other sites include Diario del Narco and La Policiaca. In addition, officials have tried to eliminate the word \\"narco\\" and keep it out of everyday life. The government also came out with anti-narco comics and songs directed at kids. The Mexican government sponsored a ten episode comic series. They depicted teams of federal officers, military men, and government personnel bringing peace to Mexico by taking down the drug gangs. Each comic attempted to tackle a myth or disinformation spread about the federal government. One episode featured a father leaving the cartel and reuniting with his wife and son. They included themes to strengthen government authority by showing how government officials do not negotiate with criminals and murderers. The Mexican government uses these comics to send a message to the youths that \\"only through strong institutions will Mexico achieve a true and lasting security\\".Grayson, George W. Mexico: Narco-Violence and a Failed State? Transaction Publishers, 2009, p. 122. The Catholic Church, which is the majority religion in Mexico, also tried to help with the drug war by denouncing consumption and sale of drugs as a \\"capital sin\\". In March 2012, Pope Benedict, went to Mexico and spoke to crowds of people: > \\"It is the responsibility of the Church to educate consciences, to teach > moral responsibility and to unmask the evil, to unmask this idolatry of > money which enslaves man, to unmask the false promises, the lies, the fraud > that is behind drugs.\\"Pullella, Philip, and Mica Rosenberg. \\"Pope Visits > Mexico Pledging to Fight Drugs Evil\\". Reuters. LEON, Mexico, March 23, 2012. > https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/23/us-pope-mexico- > idUSBRE82M0RZ20120323 In response to the increase of newspaper job announcements and help wanted posters, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement bought up Mexican newspaper ad space to warn civilians about the announcements. The warnings appear in the classified sections and in block black letters say, \\"Warning! Drug traffickers are announcing jobs for drivers to go to the United States. Don't fall victim to this trap.\\"\\"US Counters Cartels By Buying Newspaper Ad Space\\". Fox News Latino, April 11, 2012. http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2012/04/11/us-counters-cartels-by- buying-newspaper-ad-space/. In addition to newspaper ads, border partrols stream radio announcements deterring smuggling. Other counter propaganda campaigns include public service announcements, anti-narcocorridos, and short documentaries about importance of rule of law and democracy. During the Mexican Drug War, the Mexican government did all they could to show what was happening by using Propaganda. One example of how they used propaganda was by using technology and the media and making online animated propaganda to reach to the people and help them understand the organized crimes. The comics are said to be \\"a new space for communication\\". The propaganda is a big success and it has a strong support from the public. It is a comprehensive strategy where they use the public force. Other means of psychological warfare Drug Cartels use of propaganda also takes a psychological toll on the people of Mexico, including the Mexican culture and their society as a whole. Fear has permeated into the daily life of an entire country through the use of scare tactics, murders, their symbolism, and bombings. Threats are one of the drug cartels' most effective tools and the credibility behind them. When they threaten someone, they usually carry it through. These threats are a form of psychological warfare because either through coercion or scare tactics they are influencing their targets perceptions, attitudes, and behavior. The violence includes everything from beheadings, kidnappings, assassinations, bombings, and grenades. Many of the dead found show signs of torture, such as their hands tied behind their back and being set on fire. Some individuals have been daubed with axle grease and stuffed into a tank or oil drum and then set to fire. Another popular tactic is dropping victims in homemade acid. Bodies are often found dumped along the road or in mass graves. Many killings and the use of dead bodies as symbols often happen during social events when the victim least expects it. Cartels use extreme violence on bodies to portray a certain message. For example, decapitations often are supposed to show that the victim did not fulfill their job or was part of two sides of the conflict. Some types of psychological warfare include closing of public establishments, roadblocks and threats to public officials. Society is always aware of the drug cartels presence, in places where many Americans may feel safe like in schools and medical clinics. Another way used to put fear into the Mexican people are unexpected roadblocks. It stops people like the military and the police from taking control of traffic that may as well be controlled by drug cartels. The fear that is put into the Mexican people leads to a decreased number of people putting effort into stopping the drug cartels, since most are too scared to do so. The people living through the Mexican drug war are living through constant insecurity, causing significant psychological toll on these individuals. Another part of the psychological toll on the people is the lack of freedom of speech. If an individual expresses themselves in a way that drug cartels would not appreciate, as for example writing about their secret actions, their life and the life of all their loved ones will be at risk. The ways of the Mexican people are extremely affected by this issue since its a big part of everyday life. The culture changes significantly as well since many Mexicans live in constant fear, unable to operate some customs that was previously the way of life. Maybe the actions that most damage the minds of the Mexican people are attacks on public properties with large human occupations. Other than the physical damage, even more people are frightened and damaged psychologically. The goal of these different types of psychological attacks, is to limit discussion of the drug cartels in mainstream society, make people fear them, and finally to decrease citizens time outside the home. Naturally, the cartels most targeted group - journalists, have been influenced by sheer fear. In 2008, 95 journalists were attacked, 28 killed, 8 missing, and dozens threatened.Grayson, George W. Mexico: Narco-Violence and a Failed State? Transaction Publishers, 2009, p.43. Cartels also use bribes and extortion as a means to keeping their business running. They use the motto \\"plata o plomo\\" meaning silver or lead. Give them money and protection or face death.Fleming, Gary \\"Rusty\\". Drug Wars: Narco Warfare in the 21st Century. BookSurge Publishing, 2008, p.106 Kidnappings have become an extortion scheme. Many cartels charge a war tax within their territory and if someone can't or won't pay the tax, they or a family member is kidnapped until they can pay.

On the night before, two men named William Evans and John Shaw robbed a saloon in Winslow and made off with at least $200 in coins. Two lawmen pursued the bandits and on the following day they encountered each other in Canyon Diablo. A three-second shootout ensued, which was described at the time as \\"one huge explosion\\" that resulted in the death of Shaw and the wounding and capture of Evans. Background Little is known about the lives of William Evans and John Shaw before they became bandits. The former was an ex-convict who also went by the name of William Smith, or Smythe. Both were in their early to mid twenties when they decided that banditry would be easier than being a cowboy. The robbery which ultimately led to the shooting in Canyon Diablo occurred on the night of April 7, 1905. Shortly before midnight, Evans and Shaw entered the Wigwam Saloon in Winslow, Arizona, dressed in their finest clothing. The two headed straight for the bar and ordered a couple shots of rot gut, a type of whiskey common at the time. They weren't interested in wasting time, though, and before drinking they turned around and pulled out their revolvers to hold up a group of seven men playing poker at one of the tables. At gunpoint, the two bandits relieved the gamblers of between $200 and $600 worth of silver coins and then fled out the front door without firing a shot. Pete Pemberton, the deputy sheriff of Navajo County, and owner of the saloon, was immediately notified and after examining the crime scene he informed his superior, Sheriff Chet Houck, who was the younger brother of Jim Houck. Shortly before, Pemberton and the city marshal, Bob Giles, found a trail of silver coins along the railroad tracks leading to Flagstaff so it was assumed that the bandits had jumped on board a moving train and that the coins must have fallen out of their pockets. From Holbrook, Sheriff Houck boarded a train to Flagstaff, where he met up with Pemberton and started an investigation. After finding neither the bandits or any relevant information, they reboarded the train for Winslow. However, on the ride back the lawmen just happened to receive word that two suspicious looking men had been seen hiding in the bushes along the railroad tracks, near the turn to Canyon Diablo. The town of Canyon Diablo was located about twenty-five miles west of Winslow, next to the gorge Canyon Diablo and the border of the Navajo Reservation. It was still a wild place in 1905, though by that time it was nearly a ghost town with only a small population. According to the Tombstone Epitaph, Canyon Diablo was described as being the \\"toughest Hellhole in the West,\\" which may have been at least part of the reason why Evans and Shaw chose to flee there instead of Flagstaff. The two lawmen followed their instincts and stopped the train a couple miles past the town and then got off to walk back on foot. By the time they had made it onto Hell Street, the main road through town, the sun was just beginning to set. Shootout Sheriff Houck and Pemberton first made contact with Fred Volz, who owned a small store in town since 1886, where he traded with the Navajo and the Hopi. After the usual questioning, Volz told the policemen that earlier in the day there had been two well-dressed men standing outside the trading post for a long time and acting suspiciously. Just then, Evans and Shaw came around the corner of the trading post and were spotted. The two bandits were walking the opposite way, towards the train depot, so the two lawmen went after them. When they were all about six to eight feet apart, Houck called out for them to submit to a search, to which one of them said: \\"No one searches us!\\" The two pairs briefly stood face-to-face when all of a sudden each man went for his sidearm. All four began shooting at point blank range, Houck advanced to within four feet of the bandits. Having failed to make any hits with his first five shots, Shaw looked down to reload his gun when he was struck in the head by one of Houck's bullets. Pemberton then wounded Evans in the leg and he fell to the ground shooting. With his last bullet, Evans aimed for Houck and fired, but Pemberton shot him again, this time in the shoulder, which knocked the weapon out of his hand. The bullet went through Houck's coat on the left side, grazed him across the stomach, and then exited through the right side. The wound was not considered serious though. In roughly three seconds, Shaw was dead and Evans was badly wounded. As was common in the Old West, most men filled their six-shooters with only five rounds so they could rest the firing pin on an empty slot and avoid accidents. Sheriff Houck, Shaw and Evans each fired all five of their bullets, but Pemberton had one extra, making for a total of twenty-one shots fired. Aftermath Immediately after the shootout, Sheriff Houck had the body of Shaw placed in a pine wood coffin, provided by Volz, and buried in a shallow grave because of the extremely rocky soil. Evans was taken to the hospital in Winslow, where he recovered, and later he was sent to Yuma Territorial Prison for nine years. $271 worth of silver coins was found in their possession. On the night after the shooting, a group of cowboys, once employed by the Aztec Land & Cattle Company, were having drinks at the Wigwam Saloon when they heard the news and how both Evans and Shaw failed to drink the shots they had paid for on the night before. One of them came up with the idea of going to Canyon Diablo to exhume Shaw's corpse for one final drink. Between fifteen and twenty men hastily volunteered for the journey and, as Sheriff Houck and Pemberton did, they hopped aboard a westbound train and made it to Canyon Diablo at about dawn on April 10, 1905. First they had a few more drinks at the train station and then went to borrow some shovels from Fred Volz to proceed with digging up Shaw's coffin. Volz was angry about what the drunken mob intended to do in the cemetery so at first he was reluctant in giving up his tools. However, he eventually gave in and provided not only the shovels, but a Kodak camera. According to differing accounts, Volz either wanted pictures to collect reward money, being that he was directly involved in the demise of the outlaws, or they were taken for posterity. A short time later, Shaw's coffin was open and two of the cowboys had his body lifted out of the box and leaned up against the picket fence surrounding another man's grave. Shaw appeared to be smiling, which made all of the men uncomfortable, some of whom began to cry. After giving Shaw \\"a plentiful gulp of whiskey\\", taking a few pictures, and saying some prayers, his body was replaced in the coffin with a half-empty bottle and put back into the grave. The pictures were displayed on the walls of the Wigwam Saloon in Winslow until the 1940s when the building was torn down. By that time, the ghost town of Canyon Diablo was reopened and renamed Two Guns. Just seven months after the shooting in Canyon Diablo, Deputy Pemberton drunkenly shot and killed Marshal Bob Giles during a dispute in the Wigwam Saloon. Pemberton was arrested and found guilty, but he was acquitted after serving only a small fraction of his twenty-five year sentence.

The Schaus and the Browns were driving on a two lane road approaching the Pit River Bridge north of the town of Redding, California behind a semitrailer from Portland, Oregon carrying fruits and vegetables. As the truck started over the bridge, the truck driver, Paul M. Overby, and his helper, Henry Baum, both of Portland, soon determined that something was wrong with the steering mechanism, but before they could stop, the steering failed. Overby lost control of the truck, which smashed through the bridge's steel railing.Colton, Sandy. \\"Amateur Photographers Win Professional Respect,\\" Associated Press, Greenwood (SC) Index-Press, March 16, 1989, 26 The cab, with Overby and Baum trapped inside, was hanging off the bridge, 40 feet above the Sacramento River. The rear wheels of the cab were jammed between the side of the bridge and the trailer, which had miraculously remained on the bridge. Walter Schau, and the driver behind him, J. D. McLaren of Concord, California, stopped traffic, found a length of rope and with the help of other motorists, attempted to rescue Overby and Baum from the dangling cab. While Schau, McLaren and the others were working to save the lives of the truckers, Virginia Schau went to her car and got the camera and \\"ran out to a knoll on the right which was directly opposite to where the cab of the truck dangled in the air.\\"White, Bill. \\"Hub Woman Wins Pulitzer Photo Prize.\\" San Rafael (CA) Daily Independent Journal, May 4, 1954, 1 Walter Schau, hanging by his ankles, was able to lower the rope to Overby, who grabbed on to it and was pulled up by Schau, McLaren and others.

While the rescue operations were going on, Virginia Schau, from her vantage point, was able to get off two pictures, using the last two exposures in her camera. Schau's father reminded his daughter of the Sacramento Bee's weekly photo contest. She submitted the photograph, won the contest‚Äîand ten dollars‚Äîand the photograph was picked up by the Associated Press and distributed globally.

A laser Doppler perfusion imager functions by projecting a visible-to-infrared laser beam onto the surface of a tissue. When light interacts with moving blood cells a small portion of it is shifted in frequency according to the Doppler effect, detected, and converted into an electrical signal.Wardell, K., Jakobsson, A., & Nilsson, G. [\\"Laser Doppler perfusion imaging by dynamic light scattering\\"] \\"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 40, 309-316\\", 1993 By digital holography Blood flow pulse wave in the central retinal artery (red) and vein (blue), measured by laser Doppler holography in the eye fundus of a healthy volunteer. The eye offers a unique opportunity for the non-invasive exploration of cardiovascular diseases. LDI by digital holography can measure blood flow in the retina and choroid.Puyo, L., M. Paques, M. Fink, J-A. Sahel, and M. Atlan. \\"In vivo laser Doppler holography of the human retina.\\" Biomedical optics express 9, no. 9 (2018): 4113-4129. In particular, the choroid is a highly vascularized tissue supplying the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. Yet investigating the anatomy and flow of the choroid remains challenging. LDI provides high- contrast visualization of local blood flow in choroidal vessels in humans, with a spatial resolution comparable to state-of-the-art indocyanine green angiography.Puyo, L√©o, Michel Paques, Mathias Fink, Jos√©-Alain Sahel, and Michael Atlan. \\"Choroidal vasculature imaging with laser Doppler holography.\\" Biomedical optics express 10, no. 2 (2019): 995-1012. Differences in blood pressure drive the flow of blood throughout the circulation. The rate of mean blood flow depends on both blood pressure and the hemodynamic resistance to flow presented by the blood vessels. LDI can enable mapping of the local arterial resistivity index, and the possibility to perform unambiguous identification of retinal arteries and veins on the basis of their systole- diastole variations, and reveal ocular hemodynamics in human eyes.Puyo, L√©o, Michel Paques, Mathias Fink, Jos√©-Alain Sahel, and Michael Atlan. \\"Waveform analysis of human retinal and choroidal blood flow with laser Doppler holography.\\" Biomedical Optics Express 10, no. 10 (2019): 4942-4963. The local velocity of blood flow measured by laser Doppler holography in the digit (photoplethysmography) and the eye fundus has a pulse-shaped profile with time. These remote pulse wave measurements can be done clinically to reveal hemodynamics in arteries and veins and can be readily measured non-invasively. Remote measurement of female sexual response LDI provides a direct measure of female sexual response that does not require genital contact; signals are gathered at a depth of two to three millimetres below the skin's surface.Waxman, S. E., & Pukall, C. F. [\\"Laser Doppler imaging of genital blood flow: A direct measure of female sexual arousal\\"], \\"The Journal of Sexual Medicine, 6(8), 2278-2285\\", 2009 Two studies have suggested that LDI is a valid measure of female sexual arousal.Stykes, S. J., MacLean, W. M. N., Sultana, S. R. [\\"Laser Doppler perfusion imaging: A method for measuring female sexual response\\"],\\"BJOG: International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, 113(5), 599‚Äì601\\", 2006 Waxman and Pukall showed that LDI has discriminant validity; that is, it can differentiate sexual response from neutral, positive, and negative mood induced states. Compared to vaginal photoplethysmography (VPG), LDI is advantageous because it does not require genital manipulation or contact. Also, LDI provides a direct measure of vasocongestion and has an absolute unit of measurement, consisting of flux or units of blood flow. The disadvantages of LDI are that it cannot provide a continuous measure of sexual response and the laser Doppler perfusion imager is much more costly that other methods of genital sexual arousal assessment, such as VPG.

Early years Mary Shaw was born on January 7, 1907, in Wahpeton, North Dakota, about forty miles south of Fargo. Her parents were Mary McKean and Ernest Shaw. The family moved to Caldwell, Idaho when Mary was three years old. She developed an early interest in biology through a neighbor and family friend, Dr. William Judson Boone. Founder and first President of the College of Idaho, Dr. Boone was a well- known botanist, and taught biology at the College.Richard A. Ahrens, \\"Mary Shaw Shorb (1907‚Äì1990),\\" The Journal of Nutrition, Vol. 123, American Institute Nutrition (1993) pp 791‚Äì796. During fishing trips that turned into \\"teaching moments,\\" he taught her about edible mushrooms and sparked a lifelong interest in native wildflowers. Shorb graduated from Caldwell High School and started classes at the College of Idaho in 1924. Outside of her college schoolwork, she served as Director of a Founders Day celebration and as Editor of the college yearbook, The Trail. She graduated in 1928 with a B. S. degree in biology and a minor in Home Economics. Mary's older brother was then attending medical school at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. She landed a job there as a dietitian, although she had to take a \\"crash course,\\" on the job, to adapt her background to the work. Dissatisfied with that direction, she looked for something else. Shorb discovered that the School of Hygiene was hiring under a new grant to study the common cold. She was quickly hired as a research technician. By the time the money ran out on the grant, Shorb had decided to pursue a doctorate in immunology. By then she was married to childhood sweetheart Doys Shorb. Doys entered the Johns Hopkins graduate program in parasitology. Shorb received her Sc.D. from Hopkins in 1933. Underemployment and family life The couple began looking for jobs, but right then was perhaps one of the toughest years of the Great Depression. Shorb tried for a position at Washington State College (now University), which would have put them closer to their families in Idaho. Unfortunately, few such jobs were going to women at that time, no matter how well-qualified they were. She finally found a job as a social worker in Baltimore. Strictly a New Deal expedience position, it was hardly what Shorb had in mind when she decided on a scientific career. Thus, when the couple's first child, Barbara, was born in 1936, she decided to stay home. Two years later, their son Alan was born. Then, in 1942 their daughter Carole Elizabeth (\\"Betsy\\") was born. By then, the manpower demands of World War II had opened up many technical positions. With a new baby to care for, Shorb wasn't sure she wanted to go back to work. However, an ex-classmate from Johns Hopkins asserted that \\"it was her patriotic duty\\" to use her education for the war effort. Although her job title was \\"bacteriologist,\\" she performed basically a technician's procedures. And the procedures were rather unpleasant ‚Äì grinding up rat carcasses among them. She soon found another job, this time with the Bureau of Dairy Industries in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. While still basically a technician's position, it at least involved biological microorganisms. Her job was to culture Lactobacillus lactis Dornier (LLD), which was used to make yogurt and other fermented dairy products. \\"Everyone knew\\" that the LLD growth media had to contain liver extract to work. Only Shorb took an active interest in why, but she was hamstrung by the rote nature of her position. Any remote chance for more in-depth study at the Dairy bureau ended in 1946. Shorb was bumped from her position by a returning veteran. Research contributions For her doctoral dissertation, Shorb had developed an antigen that turned out to be a worthwhile treatment for pneumonia. In fact, for a while before the development of sulfa drugs in the late 1930s, her antigen was widely used for such treatments. So she had already proven her abilities to improve human health. Shorb knew that the same liver extract required to culture LLD was also the only effective treatment for pernicious anemia. That disease earned the designation \\"pernicious\\" because it was almost invariably fatal, prior to the discovery of the raw liver treatment method in 1926. Even then, advanced cases might not respond. In fact, Mary's father-in- law had died from the disease. As with the yogurt culture media, no one knew what component of liver extract was the active ingredient. By the time Shorb took an interest, other researchers had only managed to separate the extract into active an inactive fractions. In theory, if you followed the prescribed procedure, the result would contain the active ingredient. That still did not tell you how much of the unknown substance you had. That could be determined only by treating a patient and observing how he or she responded. Shorb deduced that the LLD growth rate could be refined as an assay method for the active ingredient. Out of a job, she did manage to find some laboratory space at the University of Maryland. However, with few professional credentials, Shorb would need some luck to obtain funding for further research. Fortunately, a pernicious anemia researcher from Merck & Company, Dr. Karl August Folkers, visited the University to talk about collaborative projects. He saw merit in her idea and persuaded his management to fund a trial. Despite the paltry level of the initial grant ‚Äì $400 ‚Äì Shorb proved the efficacy of her bioassay method. Merck was so impressed that they kept sending funds \\"for the rest of Mary's professional life.\\" With the assay breakthrough, Folkers and his Merck team isolated crystals of the active ingredient ‚Äì Vitamin B12 ‚Äì from multiple sources within about three months. With the discovery and isolation of vitamin B12, pernicious anemia ceased to be the scourge that had persisted for centuries. In 1949, the University of Maryland made Shorb a full research professor. Standing less than five feet tall, Shorb did not like to lecture, although she apparently possessed considerable charisma on a person- to-person level. She chose to work on problems that required a multidisciplinary approach long before that was \\"fashionable\\" or common. Thus, she drew graduate students to work in her lab from a number of departments at the University. Before her retirement in 1972, Shorb and various co-authors published 58 papers in refereed journals as well as \\"numerous\\" popular articles. She and her students also presented papers at many, many professional society meetings and symposia. Later life Shorb and her husband loved to travel. During her tenure, she requested, and received, a ten-month contract so they could spend the summer traveling. (The fact that the University of Maryland acceded to her desire was just one other sign of the high value they attached to her presence on the faculty.) During their years of traveling, the Shorbs visited 94 countries, every U. S. state, and every Canadian province and territory. They celebrated her retirement by taking over a year to travel, making stops all the way around the world. She died in August 1990 from complications of pneumonia. Honors and awards Shorb received many awards and honors during career as well as afterwards.Maryland Women's Hall of Fame, online. In 1949, Shorb and Karl Folkers shared the Mead Johnson Research Award for their work on vitamin B12. That year, Shorb also received the Hematology Research Foundation Award and was recognized as a Distinguished Alumna by the College of Idaho. The College later recognized her as an Outstanding Graduate (1966) and with an Honorary Doctor of Science award in 1983. In 1951, Hood Colleges designated her as an Outstanding Woman of Maryland. In 1957, Shorb received the Sigma Xi Research Award. Thirty years later she was inducted into the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame. She also became a Fellow of the New York Academy of Science and was honored by the American Association of University Women. Upon her retirement, Merck and associated labs endowed the Shorb Lectureship at the University of Maryland.

It has been listed on the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites since 1964 and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. It is a contributing property in the Rock Creek Park Historic District. History Joshua Pierce built the house in 1823 and named it Linnaean Hill after Carl Linnaeus, the Swedish botanist. Pierce, himself a horticulturist, introduced the box garden to Washington and supplied the first ornamental plantings to the White House, United States Capitol and other government buildings. Notable members of Washington society, such as Senators Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, and Henry Clay were regular visitors to the house. Because Joshua Pierce died without any children his estate passed to his nephew, Joshua Pierce Klingle, who lived in the house with his wife until 1890. That year the house was bought by the United States Government as a part of Rock Creek Park. Public Works Administration funds were used to restore the house and grounds in 1937. It was leased by the government as a private residence until 1952. The Junior Nature Center leased the building from 1952 to 1959 when it was leased to the Junior League of Washington for its administrative offices. The National Park Service took over the residence in 1972 and used it to house the green scene programs. Architecture The Pierce-Klingle Mansion is a three-story, ten- room house built in the Pennsylvania Dutch farmhouse style. The exterior is composed of blue and grey granite. The walls are thick. An addition on the west side of the house was constructed in 1843. The poplar paneling in the stairwell and most of the mantelpiece are original to the house. A large fireplace that measures, long and high was uncovered during the 1937 renovation. A beehive oven was built into the wall beside it. A two-story stone and wood frame barn and carriage house are located to the east of the main house. It was built into the side of the hill permitting each floor to have its own entrance corresponding to its ground level. The two-story utility house is located behind and to the east of the main house. It is constructed of granite similar to that of the main house and is part of the design of the terrace wall. Like the barn and carriage house, it has entrances that correspond to their own ground level. The lower floor, however, cannot be accessed from the upper-floor because there is no interior stairway. A brick chimney was constructed when a modern furnace and water heater were installed. On the west end of the terrace is the potting shed, which is similar in design to the utility house.

The company was founded in 1939 by Gita Peller, a Jewish Hungarian refugee who settled in London, and Bertha Rigby, an English corseti√®re, with a shop in South Molton Street in London's West End. As of 2011, they had seven stores as well as a website.  History  In 1960, the company began providing bespoke undergarments to the Queen of the United Kingdom; they subsequently provided their products to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, Diana Princess of Wales, Princess Beatrice of York and Princess Eugenie of York, as well as other members of the extended royal family. In addition to the royal family, the company has also sold products to Hollywood actresses, such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson, and musicians, such as Lady Gaga. Another notable supporter of Rigby & Peller was magazine editor Isabella Blow, who would sometimes wear the company's brassieres as outerwear in public. As of 11 January 2018 they have lost their Royal warrant due to a autobiographical book written by June Kenton titled Storm in D-Cup and published in 2017 advising about her trips to Buckingham Palace.BBC News: Queen's bra fitter Rigby & Peller loses royal warrant In 1982, Rigby & Peller was purchased for ¬£20,000 by June Kenton and her husband Harold. They were assisted in the management of the company by their children, Jill Kenton and David Kenton. In 2011 Van de Velde N.V., a Belgian brassiere manufacturer, purchased a majority stake in Rigby & Peller. Van de Velde, which paid ¬£8 million for an 87 percent stake in the company, had previously supplied Rigby & Peller with some of their products. The cost of Rigby & Peller's brassieres ranges between ¬£50 and ¬£200 and they offer sizes up to a J cup. In the 21st century, the company has experienced some difficulty in competing with larger, better-known rivals and discount retailers. June Kenton has placed an emphasis on providing women with correctly fitting brassieres, and the company was once known for its unique bra-fitting. (Other lingerie retailers have adopted similar techniques). Although Kenton personally measured the royal family, she refuses to discuss the particular undergarments they wear.

His early childhood was spent moving around England with long holidays spent in the South West of Ireland where his mother came from. Throughout his childhood, he developed a fascination with drawing, often technical subjects such as aeroplanes and trains both of which remained a fascination throughout his life. His 'Machine Paintings' in the late 1970s and 1980s are a testament to this. In 1962 he entered Ealing College of Art where he took Roy Ascott's radical Groundcourse which had a major impact on his thinking.English, M. 1989, The Anatomy of Illusion, Dragon's World () His work included commissioned paintings for both private individuals and public organisations, advertising art for companies such as Porsche and stamp series for the Royal Mail such as the 'British Buses' or 'British Motorcycles'http://www.norphil.co.uk/2005/biker.htm He lived in London with his wife, Jaki, and continued to work right up until his death in 2009 following a long illness. Career English's career was launched in London during the 1966, when he began to work with Nigel Waymouth, who owned the shop Granny Takes a Trip in the King's Road, which was a burgeoning counter-culture and bohemian centre of Swinging London. English was hired by Waymouth to create a mural for the shop, which was rapidly gaining international cult status. English incorporated \\"fairground murals, vernacular imagery and hand- crafted Victorian letter forms\\" into the mural, and during the same period, he also completed a mural for the Cale Street shop Hung On You in the trendy Chelsea area, owned by Michael Rainey. During this period he produced what he considered his 'best poster'English, M. 1989, The Anatomy of Illusion, Dragon's World () p. 38 for the underground club UFO established by John Hopkins, co-founder of the International Times. English continued his business relationship with Waymouth when they established the graphic design company Hapshash and the Coloured Coat in 1967, producing poster art that had a strong influence on the youth counter-culture, similar to work being done in the United States by poster artists such as Jacqui Morgan. He contributed artwork, including two covers (issues 4 and 13) for the radical OZ magazine as part of Hapshash a collaboration which continued for two years. Throughout this time, English produced posters for leading performers such as Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix. He also created posters for the 1968 Liverpool Love Festival, and Love Me Film Productions. English has been credited with creating \\"an English form of psychedelic poster art\\". English's works used contemporary Op Art techniques to create a visually jarring effect for the viewer, and had a bold, carnivalesque style similar to Pop Art. He also used evocative references to the decadent spirit of the 1890s Art Nouveau influences, such as Alphonse Mucha's posters, and the works of Aubrey Beardsley (a popular 1966 exhibit of Beardsley's works was held at the Victoria and Albert Museum). Other influences were eclectic and culturally wide-ranging, such as William Blake, Max Ernst, Magritte, Disney animation, Hindu symbolism, Japanese and Middle Eastern decorative designs, engravings of indigenous Americans, and other cultural ephemera that George Melly described as \\"a visionary and hallucinatory bouillabaisse\\". In the 1970s, English moved away from psychedelic imagery towards Hyper Realist work, employing airbrush. He produced several different series of paintings, The Food Paintings (1969‚Äì70), including Fried Egg and Ketchup, The Rubbish Posters (1970), with the iconic 'Coke', an airbrush image of a used Coca-Cola bottle cap, and the Strikes Water Prints (1971) with images such as Ball Strikes Water. English's posters from this period sold in the millions. This shift towards a focus on concrete decadence perhaps prefigured punk rock in London. English also experimented with environmentalist happenings and oil lamp projections. In the mid to late 1970s and the 1980s he focused more keenly on two seemingly contrasting themes, the Machine Paintings, which are highly detailed sections of trains, planes and trucks and the Nature Paintings, which provided close-up fragments of nature images such as ivy leaves often juxtaposed with hard man-made surfaces. His interest in both these themes continued to play a major part in his subsequent career resulting in several large scale paintings.English, M. 1989, The Anatomy of Illusion, Dragon's World () See also *Printmaking *Swinging London References Category:1941 births Category:2009 deaths Category:British illustrators Category:British poster artists ","title":"Michael English (illustrator)"},{"id":"35418826","text":"David Jones (born 7 January 1932) is a Welsh former footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

The dorsal surface has a row of 31 thorns along the midline, and a parallel row of three on either side of the midline approximately mid-disc. It has additional thorns around the eyes and snout. The tail has an additional 29 thorns on the midline, and other thorns in regular and irregular rows. Biology and life history Information is very limited for this species. It likely lives in muddy bottoms, where it was collected, but the distribution and specifics of habitat preferences are unknown. The eggs of this species are unknown, but like other skates, it is likely oviparous, laying eggs in pairs in open waters, and not guarding the eggs. Okamejei pita was originally classified into the genus Raja and subgenus Raja (Okamejei). This subgenus was reclassified into genus in 1999. The taxonomic validity of this species was reconfirmed by Compangno in 2007. This species is placed as incertae sedis in the genus Raja.Weigmann, S., Stehmann, M.F.W. & Thiel, R. (2015): Okamejei ornata n. sp., a new deep-water skate (Elasmobranchii, Rajidae) from the northwestern Indian Ocean off Socotra Islands. Deep-Sea Research Part II, 115: 18-29. Status Despite being known from only one specimen, the species was initially classified critically endangered by the IUCN. However it was reevaluated and was reclassified as data deficient. It is not the target of any fishery, but it may be unrecognized bycatch in several other fisheries, including those using longlines, fish traps, stake nets, and trawls. Like other elasmobrachs, this species is not likely consumed by the Shia population who fish in the area. In addition to fishing threats, pollution and loss of water quality are possible concerns for this species. Threats include hydrocarbons and biotic threats. Multiple fisheries surveys of this region failed to find this species, which is taken to indicate this species is rare. No surveys were conducted after 1980, due to the start of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War and subsequent military conflicts.

This find has challenged previous thinking about patterns of human settlement in South America. Anna C. Roosevelt, an American archaeologist and primary researcher here since 1990, believes that findings from the cave show there were Paleoindians this far south and with an independent culture that existed at the same time as other early Native Americans were active on the Great Plains of North America. Formerly researchers believed that Amazonian settlements arose later than those in the Andes, and were developed by migrants from the highlands. Location Caverna da Pedra Pintada is located near the town of Monte Alegre, in the Amazon River Basin in Par√° state in northern Brazil. It is the main attraction of the Monte Alegre State Park, created in 2001. Rediscovery and excavations American archaeologist Anna C. Roosevelt rediscovered the cave and excavated it extensively from 1990 to 1992. The excavations were supported by the Field Museum and the University of Illinois, Chicago, with which she is affiliated. The lowest levels of the cave were radiocarbon dated and thermoluminescence dated to ca. 11,200 to 10,000 years ago. The early dates of these finds have affected the interpretation of human settlement in the Amazon Basin. Roosevelt believes that the cave's evidence supports a theory that the Amazon Basin was settled much earlier than formerly believed.\\"SCIENTIST AT WORK: Anna C. Roosevelt; Sharp and To the Point In Amazonia\\", New York Times, 23 April 1996, accessed 24 April 2016 Findings The early dates of human presence at the cave show that humans did not exclusively migrate from North America down to the Andes in South America, which some archaeologists had previously believed. > \\"We found strong evidence that a culture quite distinct from the North > American Paleoindian culture, but contemporary with it, existed more than > 5,000 miles to the south\\", Anna Roosevelt has said. \\"Paleoindians traveled > far and adapted to a diverse range of habitats. The existence of distinct > cultures east of the Andes suggests that North American big-game hunters > were not the sole source of migration into South America.\\" The lowest levels of the cave yield charred floral and faunal remains and stone tools, including spear points, suggesting that the earliest visitors were hunter-gatherers in the humid tropical environment. These Paleoindians used the cave frequently over a span of 1,200 years, leaving remains of fruits, and seeds, including Brazil nuts; as well as fish, birds, reptiles, shellfish, and amphibians. 30,000 lithic specimens have been excavated from the cave. =Paintings= Lumps of raw pigment and drops of paint from the cave paintings have been dated. The paintings are considered to be the earliest ones in South America and the earliest known cave paintings in the Americas as a whole. Images include a stick figure of a woman giving birth, geometric designs, and hand stencils in browns, reds, and yellows.

It was founded in 1926 with the purpose of acting as a legislative lobbying and policy advisory body.Galenson, 1960, p. 570.Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1972, p. 4. At times, it played a prominent role in setting rail transport policy in the U.S., and was party to six U.S. Supreme Court cases. It disbanded in January 1997, with representation, collective bargaining, and legislative lobbying assumed by the newly formed Rail Division of the AFL-CIO Transportation Trades Department.\\"BLE Leads Way Into 'National Movement' as RLEA Disbands and AFL- CIO Rail Division Begins.\\" BLE News Flash. January 20, 1997. The RLEA was distinct from the Cooperating Railway Labor Organizations (CRLO), a separate association organized in 1991 to serve as an oversight body for the health, welfare, and pension funds established under federal law for railway employees.\\"Fleming Re-elected to Third Term as Chairman of CRLO.\\" BMWE Journal. 107:1 (February 1998), p. 3. Accessed 2012-04-09. Early history The Railway Labor Executives' Association (RLEA) was formed August 16‚Äì18, 1926, in Washington, D.C.Rand School of Social Science, 1927, p. 86. The membership of the association was the president (or his or her representative) of each member union, and each union received a single vote in the organization's decision-making processes regardless of its size. The president of the Railway Employes' Department, a division of the American Federation of Labor (AFL; and later the AFL-CIO) was also a member and had a vote. The organization was voluntary, which meant that no member was bound by its decisions. However, members were required to submit (for informational purposes only) any federal legislative proposal which might significantly impact the other RLEA member unions. The organization's first chairman (also sometimes called its president) was David B. Robertson of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen & Enginemen. In 1932, Robertson stepped down to devote more time to his union, and Alexander F. Whitney, President of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, was elected his successor.\\"Robertson Quits Labor Post.\\" New York Times. September 1, 1932. Even though the RLEA did not bargain collectively itself, it played a major role in labor negotiations throughout the 1930s. During the decade, the association had about 21 institutional union members.Latham, 1959, p. 45. Its chief counsel was Donald Richberg, a noted attorney who helped write the Railway Labor Act of 1926.Latham, 1959, p. 45. In 1932, it acted as a coordinating body for unions engaged in national master contract negotiations, and helped the unions stave off major cuts.Galenson, 1960, p. 571. Over the next several years, it continued to coordinate collective bargaining strategy, and by 1935 the unions had restored the wage cuts incurred in 1932. No additional cuts were made throughout the remainder of the Great Depression. In 1933, the RLEA secured an amendment to the Emergency Railroad Transportation Act (ERTA) of 1933 which required national railroads to limit layoffs due to consolidation. When this amendment expired in June 1936, RLEA worked with its members to negotiate a five-year collective bargaining agreement (the so-called \\"Washington Job Protection Agreement\\") which inserted the ERTA labor provisions into the unions' contracts. In 1940, these contracts clauses were enacted into law as part of the Transportation Act of 1940. From 1935 to 1940, George Harrison, President of the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, served as the RLEA's chairman.\\"George Harrison, Union Head, Dies.\\" New York Times. December 3, 1968. The 1930s were also a time of legislative achievements for the association. The Railway Labor Executives' Association was the primary organization pushing for railroad retirement legislation, which was first enacted in 1934.Hidy, 2004, p. 231. In addition to the layoff provisions mentioned above, the Emergency Railroad Transportation Act of 1933 also contained provisions (again drafted by Richberg) which outlawed \\"yellow dog contracts\\" and guaranteed to railway workers the right to form unions.Arnesen, 2001, p. 94. War and post-war years James A. Phillips, President of the Order of Railway Conductors, was elected chairman of the RLEA in 1940. He replaced George Harrison, who resigned.\\"J.A. Phillips Chosen Chairman of Labor Executives.\\" New York Times. February 17, 1940. During World War II, the RLEA argued that its members were losing significant amounts of pay due to war-time inflation, and nearly went out on strike in the spring of 1942. But after negotiations with railroad management and President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a National Railway Labor Panel was created in May 1942 to adjudicate labor disputes between the railways and their unions. RLEA members had three of the nine seats on the panel.\\"New Rail Board Reported on Way.\\" New York Times. March 6, 1942; \\"Railway Disputes Put Up to a Board.\\" New York Times. May 23, 1942. Later in 1942, the federal Office of Price Administration created a labor policy advisory group on which a representative from the RLEA sat.\\"Forms OPA-Labor Group.\\" New York Times. June 27, 1942. After the war, the RLEA played a role in implementation of the Marshall Plan. The Economic Cooperation Administration wanted private groups to play a greater advisory role in the plan's implementation. The RLEA, along with the AFL and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), met with non- Communist leaders of European trade unions to create a Trade Union Advisory Committee that acted as a policy-making body on labor matters in Western Europe.Hogan, p. 146-147. The RLEA also had a post-war role in international labor union federation politics. The International Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU) had been formed in 1919 in the wake of World War I as a means of united European labor unions and providing them with a stronger voice in world affairs. The idea behind the international labor federation was that the unions would be able to play a stronger role in anti-war initiatives. Although national labor federations from around the world joined the IFTU, it was dominated by socialist-leaning federations in Europe. The AFL withdrew from the IFTU in 1929 due to the IFTU's left-leaning politics. The IFTU suffered from internal factionalization as trade unions from Nazi Germany came close to dominating it during the 1930s. As Nazi Germany conquered most of Europe in the 1930s, the IFTU's membership plummeted. The IFTU survived as a link to underground trade union freedom-fighter movements during World War II, but dissolved in 1945. The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) was formed in 1945 to replace it. But the WFTU was divided over support for the Marshall Plan. The Marshall Plan's goal was to undercut Communist influence in Western Europe, but many Western European trade unions were Communist-led. As these unions left the WFTU, unions from the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries came to dominate the WFTU. The AFL withdrew from the WFTU as well. The goal of the American government and the AFL did not change, however; both wanted to end communist dominance of international labor bodies. On February 27, 1947, the RLEA voted to affiliate with the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITWF), an independent global federation of national transport workers' unions.\\"Argeninte Leader of Labor Vanishes.\\" New York Times. February 28, 1947. The RLEA, with 1.2 million members, easily dominated the ITWF. In September 1947, the RLEA won a major battle within the ITWF when the ITWF executive committee declined to join the Soviet-dominated WFTU.Stark, Louis. \\"World Transport Workers Balk at Link to the WFTU.\\" New York Times. September 29, 1947. The ITWF decision was a major victory for the AFL and the Truman administration, for it prevented the WFTU from creating a critical mass of union membership and claiming a moral high ground vis-a-vis the AFL. Just 18 months later, the AFL and other non-communist national Western trade union federations formed the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).Stark, Louis. \\"AFL, CIO, Now Plan World Labor Body.\\" New York Times. January 21, 1949. Over time, the WFTU withered and the ICFTU was ascendant. At the time the RLEA was formed, none of its member unions admitted African Americans as members.Wilson, 1996, p. 133-134. In 1948, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters hired attorney Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. to help it win disputes with RLEA members over which union had jurisdiction over various types of work on the railroads. As the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters won more of these disputes, the RLEA was put in a position of either accepting the African American union into its ranks or losing its economic clout vis-a-vis the railroads. To put even more pressure on the RLEA, Rauh filed a complaint with the United States Department of Labor alleging that the RLEA discriminated against African American workers (which was illegal under federal law). In 1950, the RLEA capitulated and accepted the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters as a member union.Parish, p. 130-132; Anderson, p. 9-10. George E. Leighty, President of the Order of Railroad Telegraphers, was elected RLEA chairman in 1950, and remained president until 1960.\\"Businesslike Unionist: George Earle Leighty.\\" New York Times. June 5, 1962. On December 16, 1950, the RLEA joined with the AFL, CIO, International Association of Machinists to form the United Labor Policy Committee.\\"Labor Forms Committee On Mobilization Problems.\\" New York Times. December 16, 1950. The committee's goal was to monitor government policy-making to avoid what labor unions perceived was a pro-business policy bias in during World War II.Rayback, p. 423. During the economic crisis which occurred during the Korean War, the United Labor Policy Committee oversaw the labor representatives on the Wage Stabilization Board (WSB), which regulated wages in the defense industry in the United States. During the buildup to the 1952 steel strike, the WSB imposed nationwide wage controls on January 26, 1951. Labor representatives on the board, who opposed wholesale wage controls, were outvoted nine to three.Marcus, p. 13-14.Loftus, Joseph A. \\"Wage Board Votes 10% Rise Formula.\\" New York Times. February 14, 1951. On February 16, the Wage Stabilization Board issued Wage Regulation 6 which permitted a 10 percent increase in wages for those workers who had not negotiated a wage increase in the last six months. The regulation was based on the \\"Little Steel formula\\" of World War II.See Dubofsky and Van Tine, p. 418-420; Lichtenstein, p. 67-73. At the instruction of the RLEA and other members of the United Labor Policy Committee, the labor representatives on the WSB resigned in protest. Unwilling to alienate labor by imposing wage controls involuntarily, President Truman reconstituted the WSB with a greatly enlarged membership and powers and new authority to report directly to the president.Marcus, p. 23-24; Loftus, Joseph A. \\"Full Defense Role Labor's Aim In Rift With Wage Board.\\" New York Times. February 17, 1951. Late 20th century The RLEA's importance in national labor affairs fell along with the significant decline of the railway industry in the national economy. The organization was also roiled by internal dissent and disaffiliations. In the late 1940s, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, and the Order of Railway Conductors all quit the organization in disputes over various issues in collective bargaining and political action. In 1950, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen disaffiliated from the RLEA, and did not rejoin it until December 1954.\\"Union Rejoins Rail Unit.\\" New York Times. December 2, 1954. By the mid-1950s, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers had rejoined the RLEA, but disaffiliated again in November 1964.\\"Engineers Leave Rail Labor Group.\\" Associated Press. November 7, 1964. Just two months later, the International Association of Machinists quit as well.\\"Machinists Quit Rail Labor Group.\\" New York Times. January 9, 1965. Faced with rapidly declining membership and severe financial difficulties in the rail industry, the RLEA abandoned its 45-year-old policy opposing public ownership of rail transport companies. Government ownership of the railroads, the RLEA now said, was the only way to ensure that they would continue to exist.Pomfret, John D. \\"Union Men Urge U.S. Operate Rails.\\" New York Times. January 17, 1965. The RLEA's policy change helped lead to the creation of Amtrak in 1971 and Conrail in 1976. But membership changes continued to roil the RLEA. In 1969, the United Transportation Union (formerly the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen), the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, the Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks, the Hotel and Restaurant Employes Union, and the Seafarers International Union all disaffiliated from the RLEA and form the Congress of Railway Unions.\\"5 Dissident Unions Form New Railroad Federation.\\" New York Times. December 19, 1969. The Congress of Railway Unions had the same purpose as the RLEA, but generally attempted to be a leaner organization and pursued different policy and collective bargaining goals. In 1972, the RLEA had 20 member unions, including nine railway unions and 11 with other unions with small numbers of members working for railways or which were not affiliated with the AFL-CIO. Three years later, the Congress of Railway Unions dissolved and its member unions rejoined the RLEA.Stetson, Damon. \\"Federal Reserve Draws Labor's Ire.\\" New York Times. February 22, 1975. But the decline of the railroads left the RLEA's member unions with fewer and fewer members. The AFL- CIO disbanded its Railway Employes Department in October 1980.AFL-CIO. Proceedings of the 14th Constitutional Convention of the AFL-CIO. Washington, D.C.: 1981, p. 59. The RLEA began pursuing new tactics as a way of enhancing its collective bargaining and legislative power. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the RLEA sought to purchase a Class I or Class II railroad as a means of gaining entry into the decision-making bodies of the railroad industry and being taken seriously as a railroad industry player in Congress. In 1983, the RLEA made an offer to buy Conrail from the U.S. government.Hershey, Jr., Robert D. \\"Conrail Workers Offer to Buy Line From Government.\\" New York Times. June 15, 1983. The RLEA said it represented 36,000 Conrail workers who were members of 16 Conrail unions, and by July 1983 the RLEA's offer was the only one for the railroad.Salpukas, Agis. \\"Sale of Conrail Now Appears Attractive.\\" New York Times. July 4, 1983. The RLEA bid for Conrail generated intense public debate and discussion, even as other bidders for the railroad emerged.Salpukas, Agis. \\"Issue and Debate: The Employee Bid to Acquire Conrail.\\" New York Times. February 21, 1984; Salpukas, Agis. \\"Alleghany May Be Near Conrail Bid.\\" New York Times. April 10, 1984; Salpukas, Agis. \\"Alleghany Makes Bid for Conrail.\\" New York Times. April 11, 1984.

But in September 1983, the list of potential buyers was reduced to three, and the RLEA was not a finalist for the purchase of the railroad.\\"Bidders for Conrail Are Reduced to 3.\\" New York Times. September 12, 1984. The failure to purchase Conrail did not discourage the RLEA. In 1987, it made a bid for the Southern Pacific Railroad.Salpukas, Agis. \\"17 Unions Consider a Bid for Southern Pacific.\\" New York Times. August 28, 1987. The RLEA bid $750 million for the railroad.Eichenwald, Kurt. \\"Santa Fe Receives Bids for Southern Pacific Unit.\\" New York Times. October 16, 1987. But once again, the labor federation was unsuccessful. Rio Grande Industries, which owned the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, won the bidding. A year later, the RLEA made an unsuccessful $59 million bid for the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, a Class III railroad.\\"Company Briefs.\\" New York Times. May 27, 1988. In 1989, it made an unsuccessful bid worth more than $658 million for the Class I Chicago and North Western System.\\"Rail Unit Workers Are Seeking CNW.\\" Reuters. June 3, 1989. A nationwide rail strike occurred in April 1991. But Congress invoked the provisions of the Railway Labor Act and less than 24 hours into the strike passed legislation shutting the strike down.Yancey, Matt. \\"Congress Votes to End Rail Strike.\\" Associated Press. April 17, 1991. The handling of the strike led to widespread unrest among union members. Richard Kilroy, president of the RLEA and president of the Transportation Communications International Union (formerly the Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks) was defeated for re-election by Robert A. Scardelletti in mid-August 1991. Scardelletti immediately withdrew his union from membership in the RLEA.Kaufman, Lawrence H. \\"Communications Union Quits Rail Labor Executives Group.\\" Journal of Commerce. August 19, 1991. Kilroy was forced to step down as RLEA president due to his election loss, and Edward P. McEntee, President of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was elected the organization's new president.\\"Rail Labor Executives Elect New Officers.\\" Journal of Commerce. September 11, 1991. Less than a month later, Fred Hardin, President of the United Transportation Union (UTU; which had been ejected by the RLEA in 1989 for raiding other unions for membership) was defeated for re-election by G. Thomas DuBose.Brown, Geoffrey H. \\"Hardin's Loss at UTU Adds to Rail Ousters.\\" Journal of Commerce. September 11, 1991; Carey, Christopher. \\"Train Unions Derail Careers of Leaders.\\" St. Louis Post- Dispatch. October 9, 1991. DuBose led the UTU to rejoin the RLEA in April 1992.\\"President's Promise Reunites UTU, RLEA.\\" Journal of Commerce. April 7, 1992. RLEA won a major court victory in 1994, however. By that year, the RLEA represented 12 railway labor unions, but just 232,000 railroad employees.Watson, Rip. \\"Rail Unions Are Angry Over Grievance Move.\\" Journal of Commerce. April 16, 1993. The Railway Labor Act (as amended) established the National Mediation Board (NMB) to adjudicate collective bargaining disputes between unions and employers in the railroad industry. But in 1989, the NMB claimed authority over inter-union jurisdictional disputes as well, and began using this authority to reduce the number of unions each railroad was forced to deal with. One behalf of its member unions, the RLEA sued. In Railway Labor Executives' Association v. National Mediation Board, 29 F.3d 655 (1994, amend'd July 20, 1994), Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for a 2-to-1 majority of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, concluded that the NMB did have the legal authority to adjudicate jurisdictional disputes.Kaufman, Lawrence H. \\"NMB Merger Rules Invalid, Court Decides.\\" Journal of Commerce. March 16, 1993. The court victory did little to quell internal dissent in the RLEA. In May 1994, the UTU disaffiliated yet again.\\"Don't Blink: You Might Miss Changes in Umbrella Groups.\\" Journal of Commerce. May 12, 1994. The RLEA still represented the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, the American Train Dispatchers unit of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, the Sheet Metal Workers International Association, the United Association (which represented boilermakers), the International Association of Fire Fighters, and UNITE HERE (representing railroad restaurant employees).Watson, Rip. \\"Unions Take Withering Blast at Proposed UP-SP Merger.\\" Journal of Commerce. September 19, 1995. The RLEA disbanded in January 1997, with representation, collective bargaining, and legislative lobbying assumed by the newly formed Rail Division of the AFL-CIO Transportation Trades Department. Court cases The Railway Labor Executives' Association has been party to six cases which were decided by the Supreme Court of the United States. These are: * ICC v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 315 U.S. 373 (1942) - The Supreme Court upheld the RLEA's claim that the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) had the authority to impose conditions to benefit of employees who are harmed by a railroad's abandonment of track. * Railway Labor Executives' Association v. United States, 379 U.S. 199 (1964) - The Southern Railway had acquired the Central of Georgia Railway, and the RLEA argued that the ICC had failed to protect employee rights in approving the takeover. The Supreme Court held that the ICC's order was unclear, and remanded the case for further proceedings at the ICC. * Railway Labor Executives' Association v. Gibbons, 455 U.S. 457 (1982) - The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad was in bankruptcy, and had petitioned for liquidation. On May 31, 1980, the President of the United States signed Public Law 96-254 (94 Stat. 399, 45 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), which required the railroad to make payments to its employees under existing collective bargaining agreements. Two days later, a federal district court authorized the liquidation of the railroad, which would have triggered the legislation. The Supreme Court held that postponing the liquidation created an undue burden on the railroad, and allowed the liquidation to go forward without the provisions of P.L. 96-254. * Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Association, 489 US 602 (1989) - The Supreme Court held against the RLEA, and said that random drug testing is permissible for employees in safety sensitive positions. * Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Railway Labor Executives' Association, 491 U.S. 299 (1989) - Conrail sought to institute drug testing for all its employees. The RLEA asked that the Adjustment Board of the NMB adjudicate the matter, but Conrail said the dispute did not fall under the RLA's jurisdiction. The Supreme Court said it did. * Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Company v. Railway Labor Executives' Association, 491 U.S. 490 (1989) - The Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad sold its assets to CSX Transportation and refused to bargain with the RLEA's member unions over the sale. The Supreme Court held that there was a duty to bargain (but not over the sale itself), but that this duty to bargain ended when the sale was complete. Lower courts had enjoined the union from striking, but the Supreme Court said it was unclear if there were grounds to do so. It remanded the strike issue back to the lower courts.

H. Bovill, Henry Hamilton and P. G. Wodehouse, who wrote the lyrics to \\"Now That My Ship's Come Home\\" and \\"You, You, You\\". The title refers to both the Clan Gordon and the famed Scottish regiment the Gordon Highlanders as the plot involves the heir to the clan and a soldier from the regiment.The Gay Gordons in The Play Pictorial, No. 63, Vol. 10, October 1907 The original production was produced by Charles Frohman and opened at London's Aldwych Theatre on 11 September 1907. The piece starred Hicks as Angus Graeme, and his wife Ellaline Terriss as Peggy Quainton. William Lugg played Andrew Quainton. Zena Dare played Victoria Siddons, and when the show went on tour, she played Peggy Quainton.Terriss, Ellaline. Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920‚Äì2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 7 January 2012 (subscription required) Synopsis The castle of the Scottish Gordon clan has been leased to a wealthy American, Andrew Quainton, whose daughter is the charming Peggy. Unfortunately, the heir to the clan's chief has been lost, and the castle will eventually have to be ceded to the Crown. Peggy has no interest in joining the British aristocracy and has sworn not to marry a nobleman. She disguises herself as a strolling fortune teller and soon meets a young private in the Gordon Highlanders, Angus Graeme. Angus woos Peggy and gains her affection, and she is delighted to fall in love with the humble Scottish soldier lad. News arrives that the long-lost heir to the Gordon titles and fortune is Angus. He is worried that this might cause Peggy to leave him, so he continues to pretend to be plain Angus until he can figure out a way to tell her that he is really an Earl. Peggy's brother is expected to arrive soon, and Angus intends to involve him in the deception. The plan goes awry, as Peggy impersonates her brother, and Angus tells her the secret. Peggy is annoyed at having been misled, but she is a practical American and loves Angus, so all ends happily.

She is a recipient of the Strega Prize. Early life Fausta Cialente was born on 29 November 1898 in Cagliari, Sardinian. She was the second child of Alfredo Cialente, an army officer originally from the Abruzzo region in central Italy and Elsa Wieselberger who had trained as a soprano and came from a musical family in Trieste. Her elder brother Renato (1897‚Äì1943) became an actor and appeared in many films. Fausta's early life was marked by upheaval as the family followed the movements of her father. In 1921 she married Enrico Terni (1876-1960), a banker from a wealthy Jewish family of Italian origin who had settled in Alexandria, Egypt in the early nineteenth century. Enrico was a musician and a composer. Cialente's only daughter, Lionella (called Lili), was born in 1923. Although based in Alexandria the family would spend long holidays in Italy. Novels Cialente's first novel Natalia, completed in 1927, treated the lesbian relationship of an unhappily married woman. It was published in Rome in 1930 and won the Dieci Savi Prize. When the initial print run of 3000 copies had been sold, her publisher wanted to print more copies but the censors in the Fascist regime asked for two sections of the book to be revised. Cialente refused and the book was not reprinted but in 1932 a French translation was published in France. In 1930 her short story \\"Marianna\\" was published in the literary magazine L'Italia Letteraria which was edited by Giambattista Angioletti. Her first novel with an Egyptian setting, Cortile a Cleopatra, was completed in 1931. She tried unsuccessfully to persuade the prestigious publisher Mondadori to accept the work. It was serialized in L'Italia letteraria in 1935 and published as a book in 1936. From 1940 she wrote antifascist pamphlets and made daily broadcasts from Radio Cairo against the Fascist regime in Italy.

As many of the twenty-six letters of the basic Latin alphabet are visually very similar, the typeface emphasizes the parts of the letter that are different from each other. There is no evidence that the font aids reading, neither in those with, nor without, dyslexia. Creation The typeface was designed by Dutch graphic designer Christian Boer in 2008 while he was majoring in graphic design at the University of Twente. He had himself struggled with dyslexia for much of his life. In an interview, Boer stated that he came up with the typeface after a difficult final he was studying for. Its creation was an attempt to keep the characters from appearing to spin around, a symptom often reported in dyslexics. Boer related this to the way most people think in words: dyslexics cannot stop seeing letters differently just as non-dyslexic people cannot stop thinking in words. Font Dyslexie uses a heavier line thickness to emphasize the bottom of most characters. This is to try to 'anchor' the letters since some people with dyslexia may see letters either moving or in three dimensions. Since dyslexics tend to get b, d, p, and q mixed up, it also emphasizes a slight slant downwards on the curvature of the letters. Letters such as c or e may gape slightly more, or slump slightly in one direction. Also, in letters such as n or h, the font slightly elongates or diminishes the stem on the letters. So the letter h would have a longer line, and n would have a lower line. In addition, the font also thickens or bolds capital letters and punctuations, so that it is easier to identify when a sentence starts or ends. Research Research does not suggest that the font is beneficial in aiding reading. Neither children with or without dyslexia read faster or more accurately with the font. It was also not the preferred font of the children tested. Data suggested that the font a child prefers is probably the most effective for them. No research to date has found a statistically significant beneficial effect on reading for dyslexics from any font specifically designed for dyslexia.

P., Rose, L. M., Edwards, C., & Singer, L. M. (2008). An Investigation of the Relationships among Implicit Personal Theories of Communication, Social Support and Loneliness. Human Communication, 11(4), 445-461. Referred to as a ‚Äútheory of theories,‚Äù Message Design Logic offers three different fundamental premises in reasoning about communication.Hart, J. (2002). Cultural Assumptions Underlying Message Design Logic: Premises of Development, Preference, and Understanding. Intercultural Communication Studies, XI(4), 109-120. As author Barbara O‚ÄôKeefe describes, Message Design Logic is ‚Äúthe kind of communication-constituting belief system the message producer relies on in reasoning from the goals sought to the message design used.‚Äù O'Keefe, B. J. (1988). The Logic of Message Design: Individual Differences in Reasoning about Communication. Communication Monographs, 55(1), 80. These three premises ‚Äî Expressive Logic, Conventional Logic, and Rhetorical Logic ‚Äî are belief systems that communicators might utilize when designing messages. The message design logics, therefore, represent ‚Äúinternally consistent and developmentally ordered stages in the acquisition of working knowledge about the systematic properties of verbal messages.‚Äù As O‚ÄôKeefe describes further, each premise is ‚Äúassociated with a constellation of related beliefs: a communication-constituting concept, a conception of the functional possibilities of communication, unit formation procedures, and principles of coherence.‚Äù The underlying idea behind O‚ÄôKeefe's work is that ‚Äúcommunication is not necessarily a uniform process.‚Äù  Components  The three components of Message Design Logic are based on \\"individuals‚Äô levels of cognitive complexity,\\" and are expressed in messages that vary in organization, content, and effectiveness. Whether these components represent different levels of communication effectiveness is labeled as debatable by other communication scholars.Peterson, L., & Albrecht, T. L. (1996). Message design logic, social support, and mixed-status relationships. Western Journal of Communication, 60(4), 291-309. = Expressive design logic = Seen as the simplest form of message production, the fundamental premise of Expressive Design Logic is that ‚ÄúLanguage is a medium for expressing thoughts and feelings.‚Äù This premise is the simplest of the three logics and explains that someone says what they feel. As long as this feeling is conveyed in the message, the message is deemed successful. O‚ÄôKeefe gives two reasons why individuals who operate under this design logic are very literal when it comes to impression in message design and interpretation. ‚ÄúFirst, they fail to appreciate that in communication, the process of expression can be made to serve other goals, and second, they interpret messages as independent units rather than as threads in an interaction fabric.‚Äù Individuals that communicate expressively do not recognize the idea that messages might be designed to induce particular reactions by the receiver. They believe that messages are taken straightforwardly by a receiver who has thoughts, feelings, or reactions that are to be communicated back to the sender. Through this idea there are only two possible relationships that can be held between the speaker's intentions and messages; 1) To fully and honestly express the speaker's current mental state. 2) To convey a distorted version of the speaker's mental state though editing or lying. Due to the extreme straightforwardness of expressive messages they may contain multiple facets that can be viewed as negative when discussing communicative effectiveness, such as pointless content (excessive knowledge of what the speaker feels or wants), redundancies (due to a thought being recycled), noncontingent threats or insults (simple announcements of punishments), or inoffensive but inappropriate comments (complimentary personal remarks inappropriately delivered). Ultimately, individuals using Expressive Design Logic believe that the element that unites a speaker's messages is simply what is on the speaker's mind, whether they are items of information from one encounter or items from a complex chain of associations. = Conventional design logic = The fundamental premise of Conventional Design Logic is that ‚Äúcommunication is a game played cooperatively, according to socially conventional rules and procedures.‚Äù As opposed to the expressive design logic, the communicator using conventional design logic distinguishes between thought and expression. In this design logic, language is viewed as means of expressing propositions that are ‚Äúspecified by the social effect one wants to achieve.‚Äù O‚ÄôKeefe, B. J. (1991).

Those who practice conventional design logic consider various contexts as having fixed parameters and therefore design messages based upon what is most appropriate to the context. This message designing is done under the format of cooperation between the speaker and hearer. Using this logic is particularly valuable to achieve particular goals. Communication then is the means by which the goals are achieved. For example, someone constructing a conventional message would relate the message most to the context (the particular situation at hand) in order to achieve certain goals. = Rhetorical design logic = Seen as the most elaborate way of constructing messages, the fundamental premise of Rhetorical Design Logic is that ‚Äúcommunication is the creation and negotiation of social selves and situations.‚Äù For communicators using this logic, messages are designed to portray what the speaker wants reality to reflect. Under this belief system, O‚ÄôKeefe explains that ‚Äúall meaning is treated as a matter of dramaturgical enactment and social negotiation.‚Äù As opposed to the conventional design logic, which says to design messages relevant to the given context, rhetorical design logic seeks to create the context using the designed messages. This creating of the context is accomplished using coordination and negotiation. For coordination, rhetorical design seeks to repeatedly solve coordination problems in order to create the social reality. For negotiation, communication operates under the presumption that it can ‚Äústrategically exploit‚Äù meaning. Rhetorical message producers always ‚Äúseek to achieve consensus and social legitimation for the reality they speak,‚Äù thus having the possibility of negotiation always available. Their messages are proactive rather than reactive, so they are designed towards effects rather than in response to the actions of others. Rhetorical messages also normally contain ‚Äúelaborating and contextualizing clauses and phrases that provide explicit definitions of the context.‚Äù Lastly, O‚ÄôKeefe summarizes the internal coherence of rhetorical designed messages as deriving from ‚Äúthe elements being related by intersubjectively available, goal-oriented schemes.‚Äù  Verification and other uses  Many other scholars have verified and used O‚ÄôKeefe's work for their own research . For example, Peterson and Albrecht uses Message Design Logic to posit the relationship between superiors‚Äô and subordinates‚Äô message design logic types. Likewise, another study done explored the relationships among individuals‚Äô message design logics and their levels of social well-being. Dr. Gwen Hullman used Message Design Logic to help in the study of perceptions of communication competence. The conclusion of her research in relation to message design was that, ‚Äúspeakers of rhetorical regulative messages were perceived as more effective, more appropriate, and were rated as more competent.‚ÄùHullman, G. A. (2004). Interpersonal Communication Motives and Message Design Logic: Exploring Their Interaction on Perceptions of Competence. Communication Monographs, 71(2), 208-225. These findings reflect the ideas O‚ÄôKeefe stated in her original work in that rhetorical speakers can better align their goals with their partner's goals. O‚ÄôKeefe's Message Design Logic has also been used in a study done in 2005 by Carmen Cortes, Chad Larson, and Dale Hample. Their study was designed to see if the difference in interpersonal construct differentiation reflected the sophistication with which they designed their messages.Cortes, C., Larson, C., & Hample, D. (2005). Relations Among Message Design Logic, Interpersonal Construct Differentiation, and Sex for Mexican and US Nationals. Journal of Intercultural Communication Research, 34(1/2), 108-118. In addition to Dr. Hullman's study, this article resulted as O‚ÄôKeefe had predicted in her 1988 study, in which O‚ÄôKeefe said that people who are more differentiated also tend to employ more sophisticated logics in a challenging situation. What Cortes, Larson, and Hample found is that ‚Äúdifferentiation reflects the sophistication with which a person perceives others, and a Message Design Logic is a knowledge structure regarding communication.‚Äù = Criticism = While critics of this theory are hard to find, Joy Hart of Louisville University reviews and examines O‚ÄôKeefe's work, including a full critique of assumptions she believes are being made. Hart claims that O‚ÄôKeefe ‚Äúassumes a developmental continuum for communication skill.‚Äù She examines the assumption that individuals may progress to the rhetorical message design logic, which is the highest level of development. She critiques this assumption as it is seen through cultural and intercultural differences. A specific assumption which Hart criticizes is the proposition that if a person is surrounded by a social environment or culture in which negotiation is possible, then that person will proceed more quickly to the rhetorical message design logic.

In 2012, Hummelt was posthumously inducted into the WCF Hall of Fame. Career =Playing career= Hummelt first came out onto the world stage in the 1967 Scotch Cup as the third for the German team skipped by David Lampl. Germany finished tied for last after the round robin. Hummelt then participated in the 1984 Air Canada Silver Broom as the alternate for the Austrian team, which finished the round robin without a win. =Coaching career= Hummelt coached Austria at two events in the 2000s. He coached the Austrian junior men's team at the B tournament of the 2004 World Junior Curling Championships to a seventh-place finish, and coached the Austrian junior women's team at the 2005 European Junior Curling Challenge to a fifth-place finish. Contributions to curling =Curling in Germany and Austria= Hummelt became a founding member of several curling clubs in Austria, including his home club, the Kitzb√ºhel Curling Club in Kitzb√ºhel.

As of 1992, there were over 16,000 boxers on the island. Across Cuba today there are 494 boxing coaches and 185 facilities. Of the 99,000 athletes in Cuba currently, 19,000 are boxers, including 81 of Olympic competence, even though only 12 make the Olympic team.Pettavino (2003) p. 536. History of boxing in Cuba Boxing originally arrived in Cuba as a tourist attraction mainly as championship bouts between North American Boxers during the high tourist season.Sierra, J.A. (2010) ‚ÄùCuba the New Boxing Superpower.‚Äù History of Cuba. In 1909 Havana had its first professional fight. In 1910 a Chilean named John Budinich established the first boxing academy in Havana. Two years later government banned boxing due to the violence on the streets between blacks and whites. Boxing matches had to go behind closed doors as it grew popular throughout the island.Pettavino (2003) p. 535. Despite the banishment of the sport at the time, for the lower classes, boxing constituted a possible ticket out of poverty as well as steady and reliable entertainment.Pettavino (1994) p. 42. Recognizing this, on December 13, 1921 Cuba decided to give boxing another chance and legitimized boxing with the establishment of the National commission on boxing and Wrestling. The lift on the ban brought tourist dollars with the bouts. Years later a national boxing academy was established to train talented athletes. The next decade Golden Gloves amateur competition had also arrived.Gems, Gerald R. (2006) The Athletic crusade. Lincoln, Nebraska: The University of Nebraska press. . p. 95. By 1959, Cuba had six professional world champions who were considered to be the founding fathers of boxing as well national heroes of Cuba. These fighters included Gerardo ‚ÄúKid Gavil√°n‚Äù Gonz√°lez, Benny Paret, and Eligio ‚ÄúKid Chocolate‚Äù Sardinas. In spite of the sport's promise of prosperity, the Cuban boxers who earned a lot of money in the ring almost commonly died impecunious. Some boxers also had ties with the Mafia and other sources of corruption.Pettavino (1994) p. 43. Cuba's boxing reputation also drew foreign boxers as well, such as Jack Johnson, Jack Dempsey, Jess Willard, Joe Lois, Joe Brown, and Sugar Ray Robinson. Although Cuba had traditionally done well in professional boxing, it did not win an Olympic medal in boxing until after 1959 due to considerable resources being devoted to the development of athletes as a result of the Cuban revolution. In 1960, the professional boxer Benny Paret won the world welterweight title, and headed a strong contingent of professional Cuban boxers who followed up their fifth place at the 1954 games (two medals) with a first place, a position they have held in all subsequent Central American Games. In the Pan American games, where the competition was stronger, Cuban boxers also performed well, particularly from the late 1960s onward. The high international standard of Cuba's boxers was evident in the Olympic arena. In 1961, along with other sports, the Revolutionary government banned professional boxing. However, Cuba has built a reputation in amateur boxing. At the 1968 Summer Olympics, Cuba won two silver medals. At the largely boycotted 1980 Moscow Olympics, Cuban boxers swept the field, winning ten medals, six of them gold. At the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, the Cubans outdid themselves, with seven gold and two silver medals.Pettavino (1994) pp. 171‚Äì172. By the 1980s, Cuban boxers were dominant in all major international amateur competitions, including the Olympics. Throughout its Olympic history, Cuba won 37 gold medals (73 overall) in boxing, second place in the all-time medal table. Cuba is the only country that has two three-time Olympic Champions: Teofilo Stevenson and F√©lix Sav√≥n. Cuban amateur boxing system Foreign influence contributed to the development of Cuban amateur boxing. Before Fidel Castro took power in 1959, Cuba's achievements in amateur boxing were diminutive. Components of their boxing style were derived from American Professional Boxing. After the Revolution, Eastern European methodology replaced the American influences.Mollett, C. (2010) ‚ÄùCuban Boxers ‚Äì Their Secret To Their Success.‚Äù Eastside Boxing. Andrei Chervonenko of the Soviet Union has trained Teofilo Stevenson and Europe's Vasili Romanov has trained boxers as well.Pettavino (1994) p. 141. The Cuban government used sport as a means of exhibiting the success of the new socialist government, and winning medals in international competitions became a high-profile means of promoting the ideals of new Cuba. The Soviet Union sent experienced boxing coach Andrei Chervonenko to help develop Cuban fighters in order to assist its socialist brethren in their goals. Along with Cuba's own Alcides Sagarra, Chervonenko helped develop a comprehensive national recruiting and training program based on the Soviet model. Alcides Sagarra became Cuba's boxing head coach in 1960 and then later passed on his position to Sarbelio Fuentes in 2001. The Cuban amateur boxing system along with other sports programs start in grammar schools. Sports are considered a high priority in the Cuban education system and it's there a potential athlete can be recognized. From the age of 12, talented youths are sent to specialized schools where they can focus on enhancing their skills. From there the young boxers train throughout a very competitive youth program. The ones that graduate from the program are sent to the top school in Wajay, where they train advanced drills and exercises. The support that the state gives is crucial to the advancement of the highly technical boxing program. Amateur boxer Teofilo Stevenson who had won three Olympic gold medals in (1972, 1976, and 1980) has made many contributions to Cuba and Cuban boxing. He is equally known for his sportsmanship, receiving the UNESCO Pierre de Coubertin Fair Play prize in 1989. After retiring in boxing in 1986 he has served both in the Cuban parliament and as a vice president of the Cuban Boxing Federation.Sherrow, Victoria (2001). Cuba. Brookfield, Connecticut: Twenty First Century Books. p. 102. After a career of fighting for their country most Cubans continue to stay in the sport, many as administrators or trainers. Through this way the knowledge and experience is passed down to the next generation of athletes.

Summary  Friends Frog and Toad, who have quite different personalities, have adventures through the seasons, =Down the Hill= One winter day, Frog persuades a reluctant Toad to rise from his bed, and join him in downhill sledding. As they sled, Frog falls off partway downhill, leaving Toad to unknowingly fend for himself the remainder of the way. Although he initially manages well, he crashes upon realizing he's alone. Although Frog is impressed with Toad's efforts, Toad decides he still prefers to spend winter in bed. =The Corner= During a rainy Spring morning, Frog tells Toad a story about how, one grey morning, when he was very young, his father told him Spring was right around the corner, prompting the Young Frog to go searching around various corners. Young Frog eventually found Spring around the corner of his own house. After Frog finishes his story, the rain clears, and the two go around the corner of Frog's house to find that Spring again. =Ice Cream= One hot Summer day, Toad fetches two large chocolate ice cream cones for himself and Frog, but on his way back, it ends up melting all over him, blinding him, and making him appear monstrous. Frog hears about a scary brown creature approaching, but when he sees it, he realizes what's going on. Toad then falls into the pond which washes the ice cream off, and the two go for new ice cream cones. =The Surprise= After a blustery Autumn evening makes messes of leaves in both Frog's and Toad's yards, the two decide to surprise each other by unknowingly raking the other's leaves. After they do so, and start for home, another wind arrives, and undoes both of their efforts, prompting them both to decide to rake their own leaves the next day. However, they both sleep well that night pleased with their good deeds. =Christmas Eve= On Christmas Eve night, Toad, who's clock is broken, becomes worried when Frog does not arrive as scheduled, for their Christmas Eve together. After considering some horrific possibilities of why Frog is late, Toad starts to launch a rescue mission, only for Frog to arrive safe and sound. He had simply taken some extra time to wrap a Christmas present for Toad. Toad opens his present, a new clock, and the two have a wonderful Christmas Eve.  Adaptations  The book has been adapted as a musical, written by Willie and Robert Reale and entitled A Year with Frog and Toad, opened on Broadway, and was also performed by the Second Story Repertory, by Children's Theatre Company in Minneapolis, and by the Chicago Children's Theatre, among others. The stories have also been produced as an audio book.  Education  Educational materials have been developed to accompany Frog and Toad All Year.  Recognition  Frog and Toad All Year won a Christopher Award in 1977. It is listed in the New York Times Parent's Guide to the Best Books for Children.

The horse was owned by Lord Randolph Churchill and the Earl of Dunraven during her three-year racing career. She was nicknamed \\"Abscess on the Jaw\\" during her career due to the difficulty the public had pronouncing her name. A versatile racehorse, L'Abbesse was able to win major races at distances ranging from six furlongs to one-and-a-half miles. Retired from racing in 1891, she was the dam of the influential German broodmare Festa and the leading stallion Desmond. L'Abbesse de Jouarre died on 6 March 1897 during foaling. Background L'Abbesse de Jouarre was bred by James Snarry and was foaled in 1886 at Snarry's breeding and training facility at Musley Bank in Malton, North Yorkshire. James Snarry was the son of Sir Tatton Sykes's stud-groom. L'Abbesse's sire, Trappist, was sired by the 1867 Epsom Derby winner and leading stallion Hermit and was \\"one of a little company of exceptionally speedy horses.\\" L'Abbesse's dam, Festive, was sired by Carnival and produced four full-siblings to L'Abbesse, the colts L'Abb√© Morin and The Black Prince (who was gelded and sent to Germany) and the fillies Travesty and Musley Maid. Festive produced 14 foals between 1883 and her death in 1898. L'Abbesse de Jouarre was purchased in 1887 by Lord Randolph Churchill, the father of Winston Churchill, for ¬£300 (the least expensive of Snarry's yearlings) at the Doncaster sale. L'Abbesse de Jouarre was named, at Lady Randolph's suggestion, after a play of the same name by French historian Ernest Renan. Lady Randolph described L'Abbesse de Jouarre, nicknamed \\"Abscess on the Jaw\\" during her racing career, as a small, \\"beautiful black mare\\" with a \\"heart bigger than her body\\". Racing career Lord Randolph Churchill owned L'Abbesse de Jouarre in partnership with the Earl of Dunraven during her racing career. Lord Randolph and the Earl of Dunraven owned and raced L'Abbesse de Jouarre in partnership. Churchill's racing colours were a pink shirt with brown sleeves and cap. L'Abbesse de Jouarre earned the nickname \\"Abscess on the Jaw\\" during her racing career, owing to the difficulty the public and bookmakers had in pronouncing her name correctly, leading her to be associated with the phonetically similar phrase. Her trainer Robert Sherwood referred to the horse as L'Abbesse to avoid the pronunciation issue. =1888: two-year-old season= L'Abbesse de Jouarre ran eight times as a two-year-old, winning three races. In her first start at Croydon, L'Abbesse ran unplaced, losing to the colt Amphion. L'Abbesse won the May Plate Stakes at Newmarket and two other races. She finished second in the Fernhill Stakes at Ascot, losing to Hazlehatch. L'Abbesse won ¬£935 during her two-year-old season. =1889: three-year-old season= In her first start of the season, L'Abbesse, starting at 20-to-1 odds, won The Oaks by a neck against the betting favourite Minthe. The Churchills did not witness L'Abbesse win the race; Lord Randolph was fishing in Norway at the time, and his wife was boating on the Thames when she heard that the \\"Abscess on the Jaw\\" had won. Lord Dunraven was also absent, spending the day \\"sailing in his five-rater [yacht] at Calshot Castle\\". L'Abbesse started in four other races that year, but did not win again. On 19 June, she finished third to Whitelegs and Veracity in the mile long Royal Hunt Cup. L'Abbesse finished sixth in the St. Leger Stakes, won by Donovan. =1890 and 1891: four- and five-year-old seasons= On 23 May, L'Abbesse de Jouarre won the 2,000 sovereign Manchester Cup, beating 17 other horses and winning by three quarters of a length over the horse Father Confessor. L'Abbesse was second in the Gold Vase in June at Ascot, losing to Tyrant, a horse owned by A.M. Singer \\"of sewing machine notoriety\\". On 23 July, L'Abbesse was second in the Liverpool Cup, losing to the horse Father Confessor. At Sandown, L'Abbesse defeated \\"a big field of sprinters\\" to win the Princess of Wales's Stakes, and she also won the Portland Stakes. In 1891, L'Abbesse ran unplaced in the City and Suburban Handicap and won the Hardwicke Stakes. Breeding career Lord Randolph Churchill retained an interest in L'Abbesse until June 1894, when illness and strained finances forced him to sell his share to the Earl of Dunraven. L'Abbesse de Jouarre only produced three live foals during her breeding career; a colt and a filly to the cover of St. Simon, and a brown colt sired by Galopin named Cowl, which was destroyed at a young age due to lameness. L'Abbesse de Jouarre's 1893 filly foal, Festa, sired by St. Simon, was exported to Germany and became a broodmare in Baron Arthur von Weinberg's stud. Festa \\"became one of the most important mares in German breeding history\\", producing the good racehorses Festina, Fels, Fabula, Faust and Furor, whose combined race earnings were almost 1,500,000 marks. Her 1896 St. Simon colt, Desmond, was a successful racehorse as a two-year-old but did not succeed in the major three-year-old races. Desmond became one of the top ten leading sires in the United Kingdom and Ireland in the early 1900s, topping the list in 1913; he sired the 1913 Epsom Derby winner Aboyeur, and Grand Parade's dam. L'Abbesse de Jouarre died on 6 March 1897 while trying to deliver a stillborn foal sired by Isinglass.

Although the conflict was considered a naval battle, no fighting officially occurred. Background In 222, the Wei emperor Cao Pi demanded that Sun Quan, who in 220 became a vassal king paying nominal allegiance to Wei, send his son Sun Deng as a hostage to Wei to further secure Sun Quan's allegiance towards him. However, Sun Quan refused, broke ties with Wei, and became the independent ruler of his Wu kingdom. In retaliation, Cao Pi ordered a series of invasions of Wu between 222 and 224, but each invasion ultimately ended in failure. In late 224, Cao Pi mobilised over 100,000 troops from throughout Wei and ordered them to assemble at Guangling Commandery (Âª£ÈôµÈÉ°; around present-day Huai'an, Jiangsu) in preparation for a massive invasion of the Wu capital, Jianye (present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu). The advance Cao Pi knew that the invasion would fail if he launched attacks from upstream of the Yangtze, where the river was narrow. Therefore, he chose to stage the invasion from Guangling Commandery, where the river was wider. Earlier that year, the Wu general Xu Sheng had ordered the construction of a whole stash of dummy defence walls and turrets along the southern bank of the Yangtze from Jianye downstream to Jiangcheng in preparation for a naval attack by Wei forces. In the winter of 224‚Äì225, Cao Pi ordered his troops to destroy the blockading walls and personally led the 100,000 strong Wei fleet as they set sail on the Yangtze. In response to the impending Wei invasion, Sun Quan sent a large naval fleet to block the enemy. Despite the size of the Wu fleet, Cao Pi was actually more worried about the climate and its effects on the Wei fleet. It was a harsh winter so the Wei navy would have a hard time advancing. After seeing the Wu defences and the conditions of his fleet, Cao Pi sighed, \\"Alas! It is truly the will of Heaven which divides the south from the north.\\" He then ordered his troops to retreat from Guangling Commandery. When the Wu general Sun Shao heard about the Wei retreat, he ordered his subordinate Gao Shou (È´òÂ£Ω) to lead 500 men to launch a surprise night raid on the enemy. The retreating Wei forces were caught off guard by the raid; Gao Shou and his men even captured and made off with the parasol of Cao Pi's chariot. Aftermath Cao Pi died in 226 and was succeeded by his son, Cao Rui, as the new Wei emperor. In 228, Cao Rui ordered the general Cao Xiu to lead another invasion of Wu which led to the Battle of Shiting. Cao Xiu lost the battle after falling for a ruse by the Wu general Zhou Fang, who pretended to defect to Wei and lured the Wei forces into an ambush. In the subsequent 24 years, the Wei forces switched from their offensive approach to a defensive one, and succeeded in repelling a number of Wu invasions. After losing the Battle of Dongxing in 252, Wei never managed to make any territorial gains south of the Yangtze until its existence came to an end in 265, when the Jin dynasty replaced Wei. In 280, Jin forces launched a large-scale invasion of Wu and succeeded in eliminating Wu, thus unifying China under the Jin dynasty.  In fiction  The incident is included in the eighth instalment of the Dynasty Warriors franchise. However, the incident is foretold as a battle, which defies the fact no violence occurred during the historical incident.

The definition of martyrdom is expanded in Iran, where martyrs are greatly revered, including martyrs from the distant past as well as martyrs from the modern age. In Iran, Shia Islam is the majority religion, at 89% of the estimated 79 million inhabitants, and is a very important part of public and political life. The Shia concept of Martyrdom has been shaped by the deaths of the early martyrs of the Shia faith, Ali and Husayn ibn Ali, and Iranian society and government have further shaped the understanding of martyrdom in the modern age. The importance of Martyrdom in Shi'a Islam has brought about the existence of a type of \\"cult of martyrdom\\" in Iranian society.G√∂lz, \\"Martyrdom and Masculinity in Warring Iran. The Karbala Paradigm, the Heroic, and the Personal Dimensions of War.\\", Behemoth 12, no. 1 (2019): 35‚Äì51. Shi'a roots =Martyrdom of Ali and Husayn= The genesis of Shi‚Äôa Islam is rooted in the idea that the charismatic and politico- religious authority possessed by the prophet Muhammad was transferred to his biological descendants after his death in 632 CE. The resulting claim to the rightful leadership of the Muslim community (the ummah) was thus supposed to pass, in the form of the Imamate, to the descendants of Muhammad‚Äôs daughter Fatima (606‚Äì632) and her husband Ali b. Abi Talib (600‚Äì661). Yet the political reality in the decades after the Prophet‚Äôs death diverged from that vision.G√∂lz, \\"Martyrdom and Masculinity in Warring Iran. The Karbala Paradigm, the Heroic, and the Personal Dimensions of War.\\", Behemoth 12, no. 1 (2019): 35‚Äì51, 40. After the death of the prophet Mohammad in the year 632, a disagreement arose between the followers of Mohammad as to who should be appointed as the prophet's successor. The Muslims were split between two groups, those who supported Abu Bakr, a companion of the prophet, and those who supported Ali, the prophet's cousin and son-in law. Ultimately, Abu Bakr became the first caliph, and his followers are today known as Sunni Muslims. The followers of Ali are known as Shia Muslims. Abu Bakr served for two years, and appointed Umar as his successor in 634. Umar served as caliph for ten years, during which he was responsible for the rapid spread of Islam through military and territorial gains. Upon his death in 644, a council of Islamic leaders elected a new Caliph, Uthman ibn Affan, of the Umayyad family. However, in 656 supporters of Ali, who believed that a descendant of the prophet should lead the Muslim community, assassinated Uthman and installed Ali as the fourth caliph. Ali's reign was marred by numerous violent struggles between his supporters and the supporters of Muawiyah I, a relative of Uthman and the governor of Syria. When Ali was murdered in the year 661 by a supporter of Muawiyah, he became the first martyr of the Shia faith. Ali had two sons, Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn, who the Shia believe continued their father's struggle in different ways. Hasan renounced his right to the caliphate in a compromise with Mu'awiya, which the Shi'a view as Hasan's rational recognition of his own constraints at the time, but Husayn sought to restore the caliphate to the family of Ali by military means. When Muawiyah died in the 680 and his son Yazid I assumed the caliphate, Husayn renewed his efforts to regain the caliphate. On the advice of supporters in Kufa, a supposed stronghold of Shia support, Husayn and a small numbers of his family and supporters traveled to Kufa, camping out in nearby Karbala. However, the governor of Kufa was aware of Husayn's presence and sent close to 4000 troops to Karbala. After several days of failed negotiations, as Husayn refused to recognize Yazid as caliph, the governor's soldiers massacred Husayn and 72 of his men. This massacre, which occurred on the 10th day of the month of Muharram, elevated the martyrdom of Husayn to almost mythical levels in Shia belief.Halm, Heinz 1997 Shi'a Islam; from Religion to Revolution. Princeton, New Jersey. Markus Weiner Publishers. pg. 4-16 Cult of martyrdom in the public domain =Muharram and Ashura= Mourning of Muharram in Iran The Iranian concentration on the Martyrs of the past, especially the Imam Husayn, is evident during the Month of Muharram. The first ten days of this month are filled with public processions and demonstrations that recall the suffering of Husayn. These demonstrations have been occurring for hundreds of years. The explorer Thomas Herbert reported on his travels to the area now known as Iran in 1650, and gave this description of the events of Muharram: \\"I haue seene them nine seuer-all days in great multitudes, in the streets all together crying out Hussan Hussan.\\"Halm, Heinz 1997 Shi'a Islam; from Religion to Revolution. Princeton, New Jersey. Markus Weiner Publishers. pg. 45 During these ten days, mourners reenact the events at Karbala and pay respect to Husayn and several of his companions and family members who were also martyred.Halm, Heinz 1997 Shi'a Islam; from Religion to Revolution. Princeton, New Jersey. Markus Weiner Publishers. pg. 62 =Martyrs in the modern day= In Iran today, those who died in the revolution and the soldiers who died in the Iran/Iraq War are also considered martyrs. These modern-day martyrs are also treated with great respect after their deaths. The special treatment of martyrs begins during the burial, as martyrs have special burial ritesKamalkhani, Zahra 1998 Women's Islam. New York, NY. Columbia University Press. pg. 70 and the graves are well maintained, surrounded by Islamic flags, shady plants, framed pictures of the deceased, and beautiful carvings of Quranic verses.Kamalkhani, Zahra 1998 Women's Islam. New York, NY. Columbia University Press. Graveyards that hold the bodies of martyrs have taken on the characteristics of a public park, with families gathering to have picnics by the graves of their loved ones while listening to hired performers play music, recite poetry, or read verses from the Quran. The largest of these graveyards is the Behesht-e Zahra, where there is even a theater that plays dramatic reenactments of battles from the war.https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/tehran/inside/martyrs.html The state does a lot to remind the public of the sacrifices of the dead even beyond the graveyard. After the Iran/Iraq war, many street names and school names were changed to the names of martyrs, and these names remain even today.Kamalkhani, Zahra 1998 Women's Islam. New York, NY. Columbia University Press. pg. 81 Portraits of deceased soldiers are included in murals that line the streets, and pictures of martyrs hang from the walls in local mosques.Kamalkhani, Zahra 1998 Women's Islam. New York, NY. Columbia University Press. pg. 79 Martyrs museums can be found in most major Iranian cities,http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1906049,00.html and there are even some camps where children of martyrs from the Iran/Iraq war can go to learn about the sacrifices of their fathers and sing songs from the revolution.https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/tehran/inside/martyrs.html Additionally, the themes of martyrdom are evident in children's textbooks from a very young age, with as much as 10 percent of the texts depicting themes of death and martyrdom.Farsoun, Samih and Mehrdad Mashayekhi 1991 Political Culture in the Islamic Republic. London, UK. Routledge.pg. 172 =Social mobility= While the loss of a loved one is clearly a tragic and distressing event for a family, the families of martyrs in Iran were well taken care of. Having a martyr in the family meant immediate and permanent social mobility for many families. It was a mark of respect to have lost a son in the war, and the public displays honoring martyrs kept the memory of a family's loss alive in the community.Kamalkhani, Zahra 1998 Women's Islam. New York, NY. Columbia University Press. pg. 71 Even beyond the social support of the community, the families of martyrs received certain tangible benefits. A large percentage of spots in many schools were reserved for the children of martyrs and having a martyr in the family gave a job applicant an edge against other applicants.Kamalkhani, Zahra 1998 Women's Islam. New York, NY. Columbia University Press. pg. 79 Families of war martyrs were given certificates of martyrdom at the event of their child's death which gave them discounts for groceries and clothes.Reuter, Christoph 2004 My Life is a Weapon. Princeton, NJ. Princeton University Press. pg. 45 Societies were set up for the sole purpose of helping the families martyrs or the \\"living martyrs\\" who were injured during the Iran/Iraq War. However, some families complained, especially later in the Iran/Iraq War, that their sacrifices were being increasingly ignored, and donations meant for martyrs' families were decreasing.Reuter, Christoph 2004 My Life is a Weapon. Princeton, NJ. Princeton University Press. pg. 50 Politicization of martyrdom =Revolution= Protesters carrying the body of one of the victims The concept of martyrdom in Iranian society has played an important role in the major political conflicts of the past century. During the Iranian Revolution of 1979, revolutionary leaders such as Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini reinterpreted the events of Karbala as a stand against oppression,G√∂lz, \\"Martyrdom and Masculinity in Warring Iran. The Karbala Paradigm, the Heroic, and the Personal Dimensions of War.\\", Behemoth 12, no. 1 (2019): 35‚Äì51, 43-46. using this narrative to strengthen the resolve of the people against Iran's leader at the time, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Ayatollah Khomeini referred to Karbala and martyrdom many times in his speeches, most notably in the speech given on the eve of the Shah's departure from Iran \\"[Husayn] taught us that if a tyrant rules despotically over the Muslims in any age, we must rise up against him.\\"Ram, Haggay 1994 Myth and Mobilization in Revolutionary Iran: The Use of the Friday Congregational Sermon. Washington, D.C. The American University Press. pg. 68 Khomeini labeled the Shah as \\"the Yazid of our time,\\"Reuter, Christoph 2004 My Life is a Weapon. Princeton, NJ. Princeton University Press. pg. 43 referring to the caliph of Husayn's time whose soldiers were responsible for the Karbala massacre. Popular slogans also reflected the importance of symbols of martyrdom, such as the slogan often seen on banners: \\"every land is Karbala, every month is Muharram, every day is Ashura.\\"Reuter, pg. 42 The revolutionaries therefore considered those who died at the hands of the Shah's secret police to be martyrs, especially those killed during the Black Friday Massacre (link), a clash between government troops and peaceful protestors that led to the deaths of around 100 people. The willingness of the revolutionaries to die for their cause in the name of martyrdom was a powerful tool in overthrowing the Shah. Major clashes with police would often occur in a 40-day cycle, as Iranian tradition demanded 40 days of mourning ending with public memorial processions for the deceased. The memorial processions of the martyrs of the revolution would thus turn into protest marches that led to more clashes with police and more deaths, starting the cycle over again and increasing the number of participants and therefore the strength of the revolution.Reuter, pg. 39 Additionally, individuals participating in these protest marches would sometimes wear white burial cloths during the march to signify their willingness to die as martyrs for the cause. The symbolism of martyrdom provided a rallying point for the revolution and connected the events of the time with one of the most important historical narratives in Iranian culture, the massacre of Karbala and the martyrdom of Husayn. =Iran‚ÄìIraq War= Iranian soldier killed during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War with Rouhollah Khomeini's photo on his uniform The definition of a martyr broadened further during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War from 1980 to 1988.G√∂lz, \\"Martyrdom and Masculinity in Warring Iran. The Karbala Paradigm, the Heroic, and the Personal Dimensions of War.\\", Behemoth 12, no. 1 (2019): 35‚Äì51, 35. The extremely costly and destructive war between a Sunni-controlled country (Iraq) and a Shi'a-controlled country (Iran) had several parallels with the events at Karbala, which led to further exploitation of the Iranian reverence for martyrdom. Saddam Hussein's Iraq was seen as the Sunni aggressor against the Shia people and therefore took on the role of the new Yazid in Iranian political discourse. Iranian leaders strongly emphasized the similarities between Karbala and the war with Iraq in order to retain public support for the war and keep the flow of volunteer soldiers steady. The death toll was extraordinarily high, with over a half a million dead on the Iranian side alone. To encourage volunteers, religious leaders broadened the definition of a martyr, announcing that all fatalities of the war were to be considered martyrs for the country, and therefore for Islam. Even Non-Muslim Iranian soldiers who sacrificed themselves in the line of duty were celebrated by the clerical regime. For example, Mehrdad Nahravand, a Zoroastrian Air Force pilot from the city of Gorgan, who deliberately crashed his F-4 jet into a column of Iraqi Tanks after being shot down, was lauded as a 'martyr' despite his religion and statues of him were erected in his hometown. Similar was the case of Ardeshir Esfandpour, a Zoroastrian Helicopter pilot from the city of Mianeh who after being shot down behind enemy lines in a battle near Ilam, deliberately called in an airstrike on his position, which was being captured by the Iraqis. Or Hoshang Nowshirwanian, a poor Zoroastrian carpenter from the city of Yazd, who was conscripted into a Sapper battalion and single-handedly attacked an Iraqi Tank in order to save his commanding officer, for which the city council of Yazd commissioned a street name for himRam, pg. 70 Even those who did not die in battle but were wounded were called living martyrs- however this position did not bring as much social mobility as the families of those who died.Reuter, pg. 47 Additionally, Iranian leaders would manufacture parallels between the war and the events at Karbala. In one memorable example, Iranian state television reported seventy-two deaths in a particularly bloody bombing in Iran. While in reality the death toll was higher, this fabricated number matched the number of Husayn's followers who were martyred in Karbala.Ram, pg. 72 Battles were named Karbala Two, Three, and so on. Actors were hired to play the role of the Hidden Imam before dangerous battles, calling out to the soldiers to participate in suicide missions.Taheri, Amir 2009 The Persian Night: Iran under the Khomeinist Revolution. New York, NY. Encounter Books. pg. 87 The promise of immediate entrance to heaven for martyrs was a key point of emphasis for Iranian leaders. In speeches, religious officials often repeated the promise of seventy-two virgins, and young men were given keys to wear around their necks that supposedly granted them instant access to heaven upon death.Lankford, Adam 2009 Human Killing Machines. Lanham, MD. Lexington Books. pg. 105 Slogans on the soldiers' shirts read \\"Imam Khomeini has given me special permission to enter Heaven.\\"Reuter, pg. 47 47 For those martyred in the war who were unmarried, wedding tables were set up above their graves, a tradition that came from the death of Qassim, a companion of Husayn at Karbala who was killed just before his wedding and whose body was placed in the tent where he was intended to be married.Reuter, pg. 48 This emphasis on life after death and the comparisons to Hussein's martyrdom, one of the most important figures in Shi'a Islam, provided the Iranian state with volunteers for their human wave attacks, where young men would attack the fronts with little or no protection. Often martyrdom meant suicide missions on the battlefield, such as the famous example of the 13-year-old boy Mohammed Hossein Fahmideh who strapped explosives to his body and ran under an Iraqi tank. Such actions were widely publicized and praised as martyrdom. =Iranian green movement= Protesters in Tehran carrying a long green textile as a sign of Iranian Green Movement, 16 June Following the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009, protests concerning the validity of the vote and the possibility of voter- fraud broke out that led to thousands of arrests and close to a hundred deaths. During these protests, which became known as the Iranian Green Movement, the theme of martyrdom was reclaimed by anti-government protestors as a form of \\"secular martyrdom.\\" Activists in the 2009 green revolution began calling those killed during protests \\"martyrs.\\" One important example is Neda Agha-Soltan a young student who was shot to death during a protest. A video of her death spread throughout the world, and her image became a symbol of resistance used to gain international political support. The fact that her name, Neda, means voice or calling in Persian, was also important, because it represented a call to martyrdom for the cause.http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1906049,00.html =The Heroization of Qassem Soleimani= Already shortly after his killing on January 03, 2020, the General of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Coprs (IRCP) Qassem Soleimani was called a martyr. Since then he has been added to the canon of martyrs of the revolutionary period and the Iran-Iraq war. The heroisation of Soleimani as a martyr is of particular importance because he appeared immediately on numerous posters and murals and thus reached a large public. On the notorious 'Vali Asr' billboard in central Teheran \\"the depiction of Suleimani‚Äôs martyrdom was encoded in such a way as to downplay his association with the regime, promote Iranian national unity, and present him as a hero of and for the people. In this way, his exceptionality as a general of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps is reduced: he is a hero among the living and made accessible to all. He may appear distant due to his martyred status, but is also made to feel close by implying his heroism is imitable and achievable by everyday, ordinary citizens. It is a myth of the martyr rebranded, rendered sleek and subtle, further blurring the line between hard and soft propaganda and between regime ideology and everyday nationalism.\\"Schwartz, Kevin and Olmo G√∂lz Mural Merry-Go-Round: The Vali Asr Billboard and Propaganda in Iran.\\" jadaliyya.com May 2020.

Umbrellas used for advertising Many parents do not have permission from their child to go to this event. It has been described as \\"match.com meets farmers' market\\" with a low success rate. In many parents' eyes, parent matchmaking gatherings such as the Shanghai Marriage Market are the only way to uphold a traditional dating style for their children in modern China. China's long idealized tradition of continuing their family lineage is very important within Chinese culture. As the children of the One Child Policy start to become of typical marriage age, the so-called marriage \\"market\\" of China has wavered in stability, particularly for males in China. The University of Kent predicts that by the year 2020, 24 million men will be unmarried and unable to find a wife. The marriage market at People's Square has existed since 2004. As of April, 2013, it costs approximately $3.20 USD for an advertisement that is displayed for five months, and marriage brokers provide full access to phone numbers for a $16.00 registration fee. Changes in marriage patterns Recently, well-educated women in China with established careers are in less of a hurry to get married.The decline of Asian marriage: Asia's lonely hearts, The Economist. They have more options than women in past generations and are not afraid to put their career first. This change in marriage ideology puts the women in a higher position of power within a traditionally male-dominated society. Now more women seek to find a responsible man with personal integrity instead of just a high paying job. Many men's standards have changed with the progression of women's status in the work industry as well, they expect a woman that has been educated and well on her way to a career path. But what has drastically changed is the older generations viewpoint on the subject‚Äîthey agree with the younger generation, with the two most important qualities in a wife being \\"elegance and a decent career path,\\" quite a change from \\"diligence and the willingness to suffer the burden of life\\".

Biography Arisman was born in Jamestown, New York, on December 21, 1937, where he grew up on a dairy farm. He studied advertising art at the Pratt Institute, graduating in 1960. He received an Ida Gaskell Grant to travel and study in Europe after graduating. He completed military service, then began his career as a graphic designer, working for General Motors. Career While working as a graphic designer for General Motors, Arisman took evening courses in figure drawing. He went on to produce illustrations for major American periodicals including The New York Times, Mother Jones, The Nation, OMNI, Time, and Penthouse. He has also illustrated books, including Fitcher's Bird (1983), and Frozen Images (1974), published by Visual Arts Press. Arisman created a multimedia installation work titled The Last Tribe (2009). An exploration of the theme of nuclear annihilation, the work incorporates painting, sculpture, and video. The video can be viewed online. Arisman's paintings have been exhibited in a number of one-man shows in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Permanent collections that include Arisman's paintings include the Brooklyn Museum, the Smithsonian, and the Museum of American Art. His show Sacred Monkeys was the first American exhibit to be shown in Mainland China, and his work is included in a permanent collection in China. More recently, he has exhibited the Ayahuasca Series, a series of oil paintings, which is in part based on the religious rituals of the Quechua people. His Ayahuasca Series was on exhibit at the Zadok Gallery in Miami, Florida, from January 1 to May 1, 2012. Arisman released an album of his own stories, Cobalt Blue, in 2008. He is chair of the degree program \\"Illustration as Visual Essay\\" at the School of Visual Arts in New York City. Themes and influences Violence and predation are central themes in many of Arisman's works. His early work, Frozen Images (1974), was a reflection on \\"personal, environmental, and media-driven\\" violence. Arisman's illustrations and paintings are characteristically dark, expressionistic depictions of figures in tortured postures; torn flesh, blood, and violent force recur throughout his works, depicted with smeared brush strokes against black shadowy backgrounds. Other works, such as Charging Buffalo (2008), while remaining expressionistic in style, are less menacing, and may be interpreted as reflections on primal connections with the environment and with a regenerative life force. As influences, he has cited Andr√© Fran√ßois, Goya, Vel√°zquez, Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud, and primitive art. In his illustration work, Arisman approaches each piece without making a distinction between commercial or fine art. The barrier is one that he has been confronted with throughout his career: \\"the fine art world stigmatizes people for illustrating [...] Every gallery tells me to quit illustration\\". Publications Arisman's has published several books, including: * Frozen Images (1973) * Art of the Times * Artists' Christmas Cards * Images of Labor * Fitcher's Bird * The Wolf Who Loved Music (2003) * Heaven Departed * The Cat Who Invented Bebop (2009) * Divine Elvis * A Postcard from Lilydale Arisman has also co-authored Inside the Business of Illustration and co-edited The Education of an Illustrator, Teaching Illustration.

He is the author of the \\"Art in the Factory\\", with art that led to productive work spaces. He is the author of the idea of installing two figures of Evita in the north and south facades of former Public Works building actual building of the Ministry of Health and Social Development at the intersection of 9 de Julio Avenue and Belgrano Avenue. Two figures of steel 31x24 meters totaling 14 tons. The south face was inaugurated by President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner commemorating the 59th anniversary of the death of Eva Per√≥n. Biographical He was born on February 19, 1971, in a family of immigrants made up her Italian father and Greek mother, a descendant of Armenians. In his early years in the smithy of his father was growing taste for art and continuously develop a self-taught from age 20. Concept Alejandro Marmo installed the concept of integration through art as a metaphor of cultural and industrial development. For this, it works with workers and excluded sectors of society. In the mid-90 created the \\"Art in the Factory\\" with the intention of rescuing the industrial backwardness abandoned factories of Buenos Aires. With these materials and with the collaboration of workers dismissed from the production system led to the creation and placement of artworks in public spaces. Evita's murals are the ultimate expression of this project, realized with the industry as emblematic of what is weathering steel and constructed with the participation of workers. Throughout his career, he worked with residents of Villa 31 and the Ej√©rcito de los Andes Fuerte Apache area, with low-income children in the Chaco Province and the Tigre district, among other places.

There he worked with Rome (Italy) in the construction of a piece to be located in that community. He also worked on building a theme park in Vienna (Austria) insects The works resulting from these experiences are deployed in public spaces, precisely because the artist is where they take full extent, while the creators and reinforce the sense of belonging to the artistic work. This understanding and develop the art aims to evaluate the imaginary world of the common man. This means that those involved in the project believe in themselves to see that what is projected from the imagination can be realized. The transformation of what beauty is negligible in another concept that governs the work of Alejandro Marmo. The artist has a successful production of sculptures and paintings from waste, industrial backwardness or scrap. Such is the case of the \\"Bee of R√≠o Tercero\\" built in 2001 by Marmo with debris from the explosion of military factory in 1995 in collaboration with students in the career of Fine Arts. Art in the Factory The project \\"Art in the Factory\\" aims to articulate the most diverse workspaces, through art. To do so, produce works for public spaces in factories, self-managed and private sources with the participation of workers, professional workers and people with integration difficulties. The project set out to express the language of the excluded during the crisis of industrial recession and leave in the public testimony of that event.

During the 1920s the First Division of the Skoplje Subassociation would be ranked as the second national tier, just as all the other First Divisions of all Subassociations, as the champion of the First Division would have access to the national top-flight league, the Yugoslav Championship. Although only the winners of Belgrade and Zagreb Subassociations would have direct access to the national championship, all the other subassociation champions, including Skopje one, would have to play a qualifying round. Later during the 1930s the national league was expanded, and an intermediate stage was set where the best qualified teams from all the subassociations would play a group stage in order to qualify for the Yugoslav Championship. =Seasons and champions= This is the list of seasons indicating the league champions.

Kobayashi was blind, and had been since the age of three months. She started goze training at age five and started her career at age eight. She continued until 1978, traveling throughout most of Niigata Prefecture as well as through parts of the Yamagata and the Fukushima Prefectures.Sakuma[1983:125] In 1978, she was named as one of the Living National Treasures of Japan, as a key figure of the traditional goze art form.Honma[2001:11] In 1979, she was awarded the Medal of Honor with Yellow Ribbon. Childhood Kobayashi was born on January 24, 1900, the last daughter of four siblings in what is known today as Sanjo city, Niigata Prefecture. She was born to a relatively wealthy farming family of the Shoya class, or \\"top of the village.\\" At three months of age, she lost her eyesight in both eyes due to cataracts;Kobayashi[2005:16-17] her family was told that there was no hope of recovery. In 1902, her father died; at that time, her mother had asthma. Kobayashi was brought up by her great-uncle, the younger brother of her grandfather. Her foster family feared the stigma of discrimination, so Kobayashi was made to live in her bedroom. She had to eat meals there, and her water intake was limited to minimize her need to use the toilet, as each trip would have necessitated the assistance of family members and exposed her to passersby, as toilets were commonly in outhouses at the time. She was told not to say anything except when she was called. She was even told that she should eat less, because she was being cared for. She was not called by her name; only \\"mekurakko\\" (blind woman) or \\"tochi\\" (the short form of tochi-mekura, a slang term). Her brother, who was sixteen years older than her, teased her and told her he could not marry because of her. She could not remember her exact date of birth. A fortune- teller foretold that she would live a long life, and her family considered how she might make a living.Shimoju[2003:37] At that time, blind persons had limited means to earn a living. Careers open to them included acupuncture, massage, and playing music on the koto or the shamisen. Acupuncture was selected for her, but when she first met the acupuncturist, he was drunk and told her that he would perform acupuncture on her if she did not study hard. She was scared by the encounter and abandoned acupuncture. Training and apprenticeship Subsequently, goze was decided upon, and Fuji Higuchi became her tutor.Kobayashi[2005:22] At the request of her teacher, Haru's mother taught her daughter womanly disciplines very strictly, including sewing, how to dress by herself, and how to pack and carry her things by herself. If she failed, she could not eat meals. In March 1905, she formally began as a goze, as her family agreed to a 21-year-long contract with Fuji for taking Haru in apprenticeship. Her family paid the expenses of education and other costs in advance, and if she discontinued the apprenticeship, a breach-of-contract fee would have to be paid to Fuji. Haru was given the goze name \\"Sumi\\" and was subsequently home taught, but also travelled with her teacher. In the summer of 1907, Haru first started playing and singing the song Mishima geisha girls are excellent girls. Haru was very small and the shamisen was for little girls so her fingers on her left hand bled. Her mother scared her by saying she would drown Haru if she said the word \\"painful\\". She began to practice Kangoe, a vocal style specific to goze. This could be achieved through rigorous hard practice, ideally in a cold environment. Haru practiced on the banks of the Shinano River, even as it led to bleeding of her thorax. She was forced to practice in thin clothing, without tabi socks. This special training lasted for one month every winter for 14 years. Her goze technique progressed until she could play in the local shrine of her village. In the spring of 1908, she was allowed to go out, at the order of Fuji Higuchi, her teacher, who wanted her to be accustomed to walking. Then, Haru for the first time met friends of her age. She had never played with girls before and for the first time, she was made aware that she was blind. While they were playing outside, Haru picked flowers of various colors, while her friends picked only red flowers. She had no concept of color, because she was blind. Her mother cried and taught the idea of colors to Haru.Shimoju[2003:52]Kiryu[2000:36] Haru was taught that there was no other way of living other than as a goze. In 1908, Fuji, Haru, and two other older apprentices went on a journey, working as goze. Haru's uncle, virtually her father, declared that Haru should not return home if she failed, this would be a breach of contract and money would be owed. Haru endured hardship and cruel treatment by her teacher during the journey, unlike the two elder apprentices. Transition and proficiency At age twelve, she was given a shamisen sized for adults. At age thirteen, she was allowed to play duets (nichoushamisen); this meant that she was a full- fledged goze. However, Fuji did not value Haru highly, because Haru's family were hunters, so Haru was thought to be cursed with ill fortune. In 1915, her apprenticeship was discontinued without the fee, since Haru was not allowed to follow on a goze journey. Fuji probably disliked Haru's comparatively deep voice. Medical examinations revealed many fissures along Haru's leg bones, due to Fuji's habitual abuse. In the same year, Haru entered into an apprenticeship with Sawa Hatsuji of Nagaoka, with the approval of Goi Yamamoto, the boss of the goze organization of Nagaoka. She praised Haru's technique, and Haru was allowed to wear the under-garment with red han-eri, which was a sign of a fully-fledged goze. The new teacher was just and fair, unlike Fuji. Haru could eat anything, and then, could perform her skill beautifully. Career At age eighteen, Haru went on a journey with a goze with normal vision named Sayo. Sayo was a quick-tempered girl, and once Haru accidentally fell into a small moat. Somebody suggested Sayo should attend Haru more carefully. Angered, Sayo injured Haru in her genitalia with a stick, which resulted in lasting pain.Shimoju[2003:123-125]Kobayashi[2005:178-179] In 1921, her teacher Sawa Hatsuji died, and Haru decided to study under Tsuru Sakai. Haru herself taught her lower apprentices kindheartedly. Tsuru allowed Haru to use a leather shamisen and a tortoiseshell bachi; these also symbolised the fact that she was a full-fledged goze. Tsuru retired and Haru began to lead her goze group. In 1933, Haru became independent but continued to help her teacher. In 1935, Misu Tsuchida, one of Haru's apprentices, was going to marry a masseur and suggested that Haru adopt her, so they could live in one house. Haru accepted, but the masseur already had a wife. The newly constructed house that Haru had paid for was taken over by the wife, and the three persons moved to Takase Hot Spring. Misu's lover was a bad man that took the money earned by Haru. In 1934, Haru went back to Nagaoka, but there was nowhere available to live. She moved to a Tenrikyo church, where two handicapped gozes lived. On August 1, 1945, the goze house was destroyed during an air raid. Fortunately, their party was on a journey. On August 15, she played the famous story of 'Ogurihangan and Teruhime' (Â∞èÊ†óÂà§ÂÆòÁÖßÊâãÂß´), and of 'Kushimoto Bushi(‰∏≤Êú¨ÁØÄ) and Ohryokkobushi(È¥®Á∑ëÊ±üÁØÄ)'. Haru's party returned to Nagaoka and fortunately, the Tenrikyo church had not been destroyed by the raids. For several years after World War II, Japanese people tried to obtain food and their struggles were much the same. Around this time, Haru was determined to leave her family where she was born, in spite of the fields she had bought in her family's name. However, she had some form of dermatitis, and she frequently met with discrimination. In March 1982, she was living in the special home for the blind and elderly called Tainai Yasuragino Ie. Later she visited her birthplace Haruvpaid, visited the grave of her mother, and performed an address to a kami called Matsuzaka. Although her family asked her to come back home, she refused. She even refused the idea that her bones should be buried in the family grave. Her dermatitis had cleared within two months of the hot spring treatment. Retirement The interference by the bad man still continued since he had asked Haru to educate a girl named Kimi as a goze. The girl had clear eyesight, and the bad man wanted to sell her somewhere. She decided to educate her; in return, the man haunted her presence for seven years. Haru left the Takase hot spring and went to Agano hot spring where she succeeded in leaving the bad man, who had become sick, in 1960, and therefore Haru adopted the girl as her daughter. Television had now started to become popular, and unfortunately goze jobs went into decline. She lived as a masseuse, although she was sometimes asked to play as a goze. Kimi was described as having 'loose morals' and after the wedding, gave birth to three children. Later, one of them, namely a grandson of Haru said a cruel thing to Haru; that her father put meat in his bowl, while her grandma (Haru) had only soup. Haru decided to leave them and entered a special home for the aged. Even so, they sometimes visited Haru for money. On May 28, 1973 Haru declared her retirement as a goze and gave her shamisen to an acquaintance. This was the last day of the activities of gozes in Nagaoka. She visited a temple every day but television reporters were waiting there for her. Revival Haru decided to discontinue all goze activities, but she attracted the attention of the public when she performed before the scholars of folk arts at Kokugakuin University. The education committee of Shibata city decided to record the goze performances, and she began to perform again. In July 1977 she went into the Tainai Yasuragino Ie, a special home for the aged, and was united with former gozes. In the 1980s, the previous gozes who had worked in the region lived in the same home for the aged. The project of the education committee continued between 1973 and 1975, recording 40 tapes of 120 minutes each. Parts of them were broadcast through NHK, the public television and broadcasting network of Japan. Reiko Takeshita (Á´π‰∏ãÁé≤Â≠ê) was accepted as a new student of goze, and Naoko Kayamori (Ëê±Ê£ÆÁõ¥Â≠ê) became the last student. On March 25, 1977, Haru was credited as the retainer of the goze art form and showed her skill at the National Theater of Tokyo. On April 29, 1979 she was given the Medal of Honor with Yellow Ribbon. Age 100 In 2000, Haru was 100 years old, and she was awarded a special award by Sanjo city. In 2001, she was made a special citizen of Sanjo city. In 2002, she was awarded the 36th Eiji Yoshikawa award. On April 25, 2005, she died of old age. Recitation Shizuko Yamada attended Haru, and in her later years, assisted Haru in her daily life. Shizuko said that Haru's voice was low and resounding.Shimoju[2003:161] Painter Susumu Kinoshita started painting after he met Haru. Kinoshita said that her voice was not so loud, but the voice struck him since it vibrated a shoji nearby.Kobayashi[2005:250] Shimoju pointed out that Haru's recitation was not in order, but was strong and powerful with some pressure.Shimoju[2003:32] \\"The voice does not bend at any place, but comes directly from the front.\\" \\"The voice comes straight into the eardrum. She wrote that the voice of Haru was unique, unlike any other reciting gozes.Shimoju[2003:32] Kawano heard her voice in 1995 at Sanjo, and wrote that although Haru did not use a microphone, her voice struck the audience pleasantly with a certain rhythm, and the voice was heard penetrating the audience. It was not the so-called beautiful voice. Every word could be understood by the audience, and her intonation was that of a person trained for a long time. Kobayashi[2005:11] Jun-ichi Sakuma commented that her voice was once crushed, and was coming from the intestine. It was completely different from the voice of those who were trained in favourable conditions. Reiko Takeshita, her student, commented that her singing might be that of Bel canto.Shimoju [2003:24,25,47] According to her, three experienced singers sang at the same time, but only the voice of Haru could be heard.Shimoju[2003:25-26] Haru's tone was constant, and there was no rising or falling.Shimoju[25-26] Masako Shirasu commented that Haru's voice was more or less monotonous and progressed innocently and this struck the audience greatly. Usually, blind persons have peculiar tones but Haru's voice was without any worried concern. With the monotone, she sang chilly stories. Haru's voice was not demanding sympathy. She should be called a master.Shimoju[2003:231] Reiko Takeshita once asked Haru whether sentiment should be included in the song or not. Her answer was no.Shimoji[2003:33] Naoko Kayamori, another student, wrote that Haru could sing three different ways, probably because of her three different teachers.Kobayashi[2005:261-262] According to Haru, she had difficulties adapting herself to new circumstances. Haru had a brilliant memory, possibly because she could not see.Shimoju[2003:48] Jun-ichi Sakuma wrote that the education committee of Shibata city was surprised that Haru remembered several hundred goze songs, and she memorized every song when she heard it only once. Gerald Groemer, a scholar of music, compared her performances Awatokushimajuurobee and Kuzunoha no Kowakare(ÈòøÊ≥¢Âæ≥Â≥∂ÂçÅÈÉéÂÖµË°õ and Ëëõ„ÅÆËëâÂ≠êÂà•„Çå) played 20 years apart, and found practically no difference between them.Groemer[2007:369-370,360-361] Haru said that any songs she remembered were neither what she wanted to master, nor what she mastered with pleasure. She thought it was her job.Shimoju[2003:239] Especially during her apprenticeship, there had been no pleasure. However, Haru wanted to learn more if there was a good singer. Haru's repertoire included a wide range of music; popular music such as Saimonmatsuzaka, tokiwazu, shinnai, kiyomoto, gidayu, nagauta, hauta, Mikawa manzai, wasan and dodoitsu.Groemer[2007:42-43] In the house of the aged, Haru belonged to a music club, but commented that folk songs and popular songs were difficult.Shimoju[2003:251] Character Haru's mother told her that Haru should answer,\\"yes\\", to any request and Haru should not express her opinions, since Haru could not see, and had to be cared for throughout her life.Shimoju[2003:298] Haru should not bother anyone, and do anything by herself, and she should not do anything which would bring hatred to herself.Shimoju[2003:42] Shomoju pointed out that these rules of Haru's mother governed her behaviour throughout her life.Shimoju[2003:42-43] She remained good-natured, and accepted her destiny impressively. But at the same time, her convictions made her life full of difficulties.Shimoju[2003:179] Haru accepted anything which occurred to her as a festival if she walked with good people, and if she walked with bad people, she accepted it as 'training'.Shimoju[2003:122] Sakuma wrote that Haru was a rare good-natured person, while other gozes thought that Haru was an exceptionally unlucky person.Shimoju[2003:241] Haru had a number of unfortunate events occur throughout her life, but her character remained solid. Being a goze made her face anyone with the same sentiment as those with eyesight.Shimoju[2003:90](298). Good nature and sincerity might be of her own character, but the education by Haru's mother was great.Shimoju[2003:89] Shizuko Yamada referred to the severe circumstances of Haru. However arduously she might have been educated, there was nothing humble in her mind.Shimoju[2003:90] To the contrary, Haru was too kind to other people, and this nature brought her considerable difficulties.Shimoju[2003:223] Haru kept the advice of her mother even when she was in the home for the aged and she had tried not to do anything which might be noticed by other people.Shimoju[2003:251] She never spoke ill of others.Shimoju[2003:216] Shimoju commented on the behavior of Haru at the Yasuragi no Ie (home for the aged). Even when other people were in high spirits, she remained calm and solitary.Shimoju[2003:59] It was thought that this must have been her nature since childhood. Tomoko Matsui, a cameraman who took pictures of Haru, said that Haru never expressed anything which would make others look upon her with scrutiny.Shimoju[2003:175] Painter Susumu Kinoshita drew pictures of Haru for 20 years, starting in 1982. According to Kinoshita, Haru's face differed every time he drew, absent-minded at some time, with wrinkles making his pictures worthwhile.Kobayashi[2005:249] He used a 9B black pencil (very soft and dark pencil) to depict the darkness of her heart.Kobayashi[2005:251] Shimoju wrote that usually Haru appeared dignified, but while she was alone, she sometimes showed an expression of the darkness of her life.Shimoju[2003:174] Philosophy On her personal philosophy, Haru said Kobayashi[2005:60-61] Kusumi Kawano wrote that Kobayashi[2005:61] Kiryu [2000:378] A monk who gave Haru a Dharma name said that Kobayashi[2005:278-279] References *Osamu Akiya, Ë™¨ÁµåÁØÄ„ÅÆ‰ºùÁµ± Ë™¨ÁµåÁ•≠Êñá„Å®Ë∂äÂæåÁûΩÂ•≥(Tradition of Saimon and Niigata Goze)1987, Hitotsubashi Souron, 97, 3, pp304‚Äì326 *Seiji Kiryu, ÊúÄÂæå„ÅÆÁûΩÂ•≥ Â∞èÊûó„Éè„É´„ÅÆ‰∫∫Áîü,(The life of Kobayashi Haru, the last Goze) 2000, Bungeisha, *Groemer, Gerald.

After its failed Siege of Burgos, the 35,000-man Allied army withdrew to the west, pursued by Souham's 53,000 French soldiers. On 23 October, French cavalry attacked the Allied rear guard in the inconclusive Battle of Venta del Pozo. The Allies pulled back behind the Pisuerga and Carri√≥n Rivers and took up a defensive position. Beginning on the 25th there were clashes at Palencia and Villamuriel de Cerrato as Souham sought to turn the Allied north flank. Wellington then adopted an unorthodox defensive position, prompting Souham to pause for two days. The stalemate was broken on 29 October when a party of naked French soldiers swam the Duero River at Tordesillas with their weapons on a raft. Upon reaching the far bank, they took up their guns and routed the Brunswick defenders of a key bridge. With an intact bridge in French hands, Wellington was forced to continue his retreat toward Portugal. Meanwhile, Wellington's subordinate Rowland Hill withdrew from Madrid. The two British commanders united their armies near Alba de Tormes on 8 November. By this time the combined French armies were led by Nicolas Soult. Though 80,000 French faced 65,000 Allies on the old Salamanca battlefield neither commander initiated a battle, whereupon Wellington began a withdrawal. After a retreat in miserable conditions during which hundreds of soldiers were captured or died of hunger and exposure, the Allied army went into winter quarters. The actions were fought during the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic Wars. Background On 22 July 1812, General Arthur Wellesley, Marquess Wellington's won a great victory over Marshal Auguste Marmont's Army of Portugal at the Battle of Salamanca. Marmont was badly wounded, two of his division commanders were killed, and his army severely mauled with 10,000 killed and wounded. An additional 4,000 soldiers, 20 cannons, two eagles, and six colors were captured for Allied losses of 4,762 men.Smith (1998), 380-381 King Joseph Bonaparte evacuated Madrid and its forts surrendered to the Allies on 13 August.Smith (1998), 385-386 One major consequence of Salamanca was that Marshal Nicolas Soult raised the two and one-half year Siege of Cadiz on 25 August 1812 and abandoned the province of Andalusia.Smith (1998), 389 General Joseph Souham Hoping to exploit the summer's successes, Wellington began the Siege of Burgos on 19 September 1812. Burgos' 2,000-man garrison was led by General of Brigade Jean-Louis Dubreton who supervised a very able and aggressive defense. During their futile siege, the Allies suffered 2,100 casualties before withdrawing on 21 October.Smith (1998), 397 While Wellington was attempting to reduce Burgos, the French reacted promptly to the crisis. To oppose his 35,000-man army, General of Division Joseph Souham assembled 53,000 men in the north of Spain. This force included 41,000 men of the reconstituted Army of Portugal, 6,500 infantry and 2,300 cavalry from the Army of the North, and a 3,400-man brigade from Bayonne.Glover (2001), 213 In the south, Soult and Joseph advanced on Madrid with 61,000 soldiers and 84 guns. To oppose these masses, Lieutenant General Rowland Hill had 31,000 Anglo-Portuguese and 12,000 Spaniards.Glover (2001), 211-212 Wellington's host included 24,000 Anglo-Portuguese and 12,000 Spanish troops under General Jos√© Mar√≠a Santocildes.Gates (2002), 371 Wellington stole a march on Souham and the Frenchman did not discover the Allied retreat until late on 22 October. Souham immediately launched almost 6,000 cavalry in pursuit of his enemies. On the 23rd, the Allied main body crossed the Pisuerga River at Torquemada and spread out to defend the west bank. The same day, the French cavalry fought Wellington's rear guardGlover (2001), 214 in the drawn Battle of Venta del Pozo. The Allies counted 230 casualties while the French lost about 200 men. Battle Stone bridge at Palencia On 25 October, Souham advanced on Wellington's center and left flank which were posted along the Pisuerga and Carri√≥n Rivers with his right flank at Valladolid. A French probe of his center was repulsed by the 5th Division, but on the left a Spanish division was driven from Palencia on the east bank of the Carri√≥n. The Spanish were pursued so closely that the French got across the Carri√≥n bridge before it could be blown upGlover (2001), 215 and General of Division Maximilien Sebastien Foy's division secured a bridgehead. General of Division Antoine Louis Popon de Maucune's division crossed the Carri√≥n farther south at Villamuriel de Cerrato. Since, Foy's and Maucune's thrusts threatened to cut off a portion of his army, Wellington committed four brigades to drive Maucune back. After a tough fight the French were ejected from Villamuriel. In these operations, the French inflicted 800 casualties on the Allies while losing only 350 men. With his river defenses outflanked by Foy, Wellington ingeniously shifted his army to the east bank of the Pisuerga.Gates (2002), 372-373 While on the 23rd he held the west bank of the Pisuerga, on the 25th he defended the east bank. Planting his left flank (formerly his right) at Valladolid and securing his right flank on a tributary river upstream, the British army commander held a strong position. The baffled Souham ordered a reconnaissance as he pondered the situation for two days, then Foy scored another coup.Gates (2002), 373 On 29 October, Captain Guingret led 54 men of the 6th Light Infantry Regiment across the Duero River at Tordesillas. The soldiers stripped naked and silently swam across the river, towing a raft with their weapons. Taking up their muskets, they attacked the bridge guard which consisted of a half-company of the Brunswick Oels J√§gers. Surprised and attacked from an unexpected direction, the Brunswick officer and his men fled, allowing the French to capture the bridge along with nine prisoners, while suffering no losses. The seizure of a bridge to the west compromised Wellington's defensive line.Smith (1998), 398 Though Wellington managed to contain the French bridgehead, he was forced to order a retreat.Glover (2001), 216 Retreat Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Wellington Soon afterward, Souham's pursuit slackened when General of Division Marie-Fran√ßois Auguste de Caffarelli du Falga reclaimed 12,000 Army of the North troops and returned to the Bay of Biscay coast to deal with a new outbreak of Spanish guerilla attacks. Following instructions from Wellington, Hill evacuated Madrid on 31 October 1812. Hill's 4,000-man rear guard held off Soult's advance guard at the Aranjuez bridge on the 30th. A week later, he linked up with Wellington near Alba de Tormes. Meanwhile, Souham joined Soult on 8 November.Gates (2002), 274 On 10 and 11 November the two armies sparred along the Tormes River near Alba. Twelve voltiguer (light infantry) companies and the 45th Line Infantry Regiment of the French 5th Division were repelled by Brigadier General Kenneth Howard's brigade of the 2nd Division. This unit included the 1st Battalions of the 50th Foot, 71st Foot, and 92nd Foot and was supported by 2nd and 14th Portuguese Line Infantry Regiments. Casualties amounted to 158 French, 69 British, and 44 Portuguese. Disappointed here, Soult's army crossed the Tormes farther south and Wellington fell back.Smith (1998), 400 Marshal Nicolas Soult On 15 November, 80,000 French troops faced 65,000 Allied soldiers on the old Salamanca battlefield. To the fury of the French soldiers and officers, Soult failed to order an attack. Instead, Wellington began retreating that afternoon. As the Allies marched away, rain began to fall continuously.Glover (2001), 218 As the supplies in the Salamanca depots were feverishly packed up and sent away, Wellington's logistical arrangements collapsed completely. Fortunately for the Allies, Joseph had forbidden all but his cavalry to pursue.Gates (2002), 374 On 16 November at Matilla de los Ca√±os del R√≠o, Brigadier General Victor Alten with 1,300 men clashed with 2,000 French cavalry consisting of the 2nd Hussar, 5th and 27th Chasseurs √† Cheval and 7th Lancer Regiments. Alten had the 1st and 2nd Hussars of the King's German Legion and the 14th Light Dragoons, as well as two cannons and the light company of the 1st Battalion of the 28th Foot. The French lost 50 men, almost all of whom were wounded and captured, while Alten's command suffered 34 casualties.Smith (1998), 403 Already demoralized by having to retreat, the Allied soldiers were soon forced to survive on acorns when the inept Quartermaster General James Willoughby Gordon directed the supply trains onto the wrong road. On 17 November, Gordon sent the cavalry rear guard off to a flank and for a time the retreating infantry were directly exposed to the attentions of the French cavalry. On this day, Wellington's second-in-command Edward Paget was made a prisoner by the French horsemen. The misery of the hungry foot soldiers was intense as they struggled to march on muddy roads in the cold weather.Glover (2001), 219-220 During the retreat three of Wellington's division commanders took matters into their own hands. Lieutenant General William Stewart and two others decided to disobey the army commander's direct order to retreat by a certain road. Stewart was joined by Lieutenant General James Broun-Ramsay, Lord Dalhousie and either Major General John Oswald or Lieutenant General Henry Clinton. When Wellington found them in the morning, the three divisions were in complete confusion. Later the army commander was asked what he said in the situation and he replied, \\"Oh, by God, it was too serious to say anything.\\"Glover (2001), 219 On 16 November, the French cavalry rounded up 600 stragglers and the following day, they captured even more. The Allies staggered into their base at Ciudad Rodrigo on 19 November. Two-fifths of the army's soldiers were either ill or missing. The humor of the rank and file was not improved when Wellington issued a nasty letter to his division and brigade commanders and it was leaked to the press.Glover (2001), 221 A total of 5,000 men were missing. While many of the missing were on the way to French prison camps, the majority had died from starvation or hypothermia. Though the Allied army had apparently been defeated, in fact much had been accomplished in 1812. The French had been ejected from the cities of Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Seville, and Astorga, and the provinces of Andalusia, Extremadura, and Asturias.Gates (2002), 375 Notes References  Category:Battles of the Peninsular War Category:Battles of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Conflicts in 1812 Category:Sieges involving the United Kingdom Category:Sieges involving France Category:Sieges involving Spain Category:Sieges involving Portugal Category:1812 in Spain Category:October 1812 events ","title":"Battle of Tordesillas (1812)"},{"id":"35422516","text":"Adolf Gottstein Adolf Gottstein (2 November 1857 in Breslau ‚Äì 3 March 1941) was a German social hygienist and epidemiologist.

This was, in part a result of the City Council, in May of that year, directing the Planning Commission to study zoning for \\"Student Living Groups\\" (i.e. fraternities and sororities, etc.). The group prepared a Constitution for the neighborhood association, and an outline for a neighborhood plan; both of which were presented at a neighborhood meeting in March 1997. The association has successfully lobbied the city for increased lighting, infrastructure repairs (such as sidewalks), increased community involvement in police strategies, and amendments to the city's noise ordinance. The neighborhood association requested that the city consider creating a Special Events Permit, so as to address some of the issues arising from the youth of its residents. Although the city, did not establish such a permit, the proposed zone which was to be associated with this permit eventually was approved by the council as a unique Fraternity/Sorority Overlay Zone.

East of here, the byway transitions from FFH 3150 to follow FFH 42 easterly. FFH 42 runs along the shoreline providing access to two campgrounds at Monocle Lake and Bay View as well as picnic areas. The road also provides access to the Point Iroquois Lighthouse which is open for tours. The lighthouse was built in 1870 and offers visitors a view of the Canadian shore at the top of its spiral staircase. After passing through the Point Iroquois area, FFH 42 turns southward to follow the shore line on Iroquois Road, terminating at the national forest boundary west of Brimley. The FFH 42 number is not signed along the roadway. History Entrance at Lake Superior Shoreline Road and M-123 The roadway is part of the Forest Highway System that is funded and administered by the USFS and the Federal Highway Administration; the system was created by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921. An earthen roadway was present through the area by 1936. In the beginning of 1937, the easternmost section around Point Iroquois was improved to a gravel road. Two years later, the westernmost section from Naomikong Point to the junction with M-123 was improved to gravel. The entire road surface was improved to gravel by 1945. Paving started on the road in the mid-1950s on the eastern end. The section through the Naomikong Point area was built starting in 1967 by the Michigan State Highway Department under contract to the USFS. The road, at the time, was intended to be part of a longer scenic highway that would connect a proposed lakeshore road through the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore with roads running along Whitefish Bay and the St. Marys River south of Sault Ste. Marie. The western end was realigned and paved in the late 1970s, moving the roadway closer to Tahquamenon Bay west of Naomikong Point. The former roadway was removed in the process. The last section was paved in 1987 between the two paved sections at Naomikong and Iroquois points. The National Forest Scenic Byway designation was granted on February 8, 1989. The roadway is maintained by the CCRC along with the USFS.

The John McDonnell has been used by the military as primary a scientific ship. Its role has varied but is mostly dominated with the task of surveying the world's underwater geological features using side scan radar. This information provides valuable navigation information and charts for both military and civilian ships to navigate unfamiliar territory. These ships were built to fill in the holes in the navigation charts. The John McDonnell has even aided in the location of two downed F-16s in the Northern Persian Gulf in 1993 and the wreckage of a Navy helicopter in the Strait of Hormuz in 1994. Two years later, it located a crashed F-14 in the Central Persian Gulf. In 2008, it helped locate a crashed Philippine C-130 Hercules in the Davao Gulf. The Navy deactivated the ship on 25 August 2010 and as of August 2013, the General Services Administration was offering the ship at auction.

The Princess and The Butterfly: or, The Fantastics is a comedy in five acts by Arthur Wing Pinero first produced at London‚Äôs St. James's Theatre on March 25, 1897 and in New York at the Lyceum Theatre on November 23, 1897. The New York version of The Princess and the Butterfly was somewhat abbreviated from the four-hour production that originally played in London.

After her husband dies, the princess returns to London where she > falls in love with Sir George Lamorant, an old friend once known as \\"the > butterfly.\\" Their plans to marry though are soon complicated by a shared > fear of approaching middle age. Dramatic Technique, By George Pierce Baker, 1919 > In The Princess and the Butterfly, Act I not only disposes of preliminary > necessary exposition, but depicts different kinds of restlessness in a group > of women at or nearing middle age. Act II does the same for a group of men, > and in the proposed duel provides what later may be made to reveal to Sir > George how much Fay Zuliani cares for him. Act III complicates the story by > showing that Fay is not the niece of Sir George, and illustrates the growing > affection between the Princess and Edward Oriel. Act IV reveals to Sir > George and Fay how much each cares for the other. The fifth act shows how > Sir George and the Princess, who have tried to be wise and restrained, > impulsively and instinctively, choose the path of seeming unwisdom but > immediate happiness. Reception The Opera Glass, 1897 > Daniel Frohman's stock company returned to the Lyceum, opening in Pinero's, > The Princess and the Butterfly. You all know what a Pinero play is; well, > this one is just like the others. It tells an impossible story but gives > ample opportunity for the men and women to exhibit themselves.

The Kurds are the largest ethnic minority in Iraq, comprising between 15% and 20% of the country's population according to the CIA World Factbook. Most of them live in Iraqi Kurdistan. The Kurdish people within Iraq have grappled with various political statuses over their history. Once assumed to receive full independence via the Treaty of S√®vres, Iraqi Kurds have experienced a recent and troubled history of betrayal, oppression, and genocide. After the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003, Iraqi Kurds, now governed by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), face a crossroads in the political trajectory of Iraqi Kurdistan. Kurdish diversity and factions, the KRG relationship with the United States, Iraq's central government, and neighboring countries, previous political agreements, disputed territories, and Kurdish ethnonationalism all affect Iraqi Kurds. Background The Kurdish people are an ethnic group whose origins are in the Middle East. They are one of the largest ethnic groups in the world that do not have a state of their own. This geo-cultural region means \\"Land of the Kurds\\". Iraqi Kurdistan is an autonomous region in northern Iraq, covering and has a population of approximately 5.8 million people. Kurdish populations occupy the territory in and around the Zagros mountains. These arid unwelcoming mountains have been a geographic buffer to cultural and political dominance from neighboring empires. Persians, Arabs, and Ottomans were kept away, and a space was carved out to develop Kurdish culture, language, and identity. =Pre-1991= According to Michael M. Gunter, the Kurds are thought by some scholars to be the descendants of various Indo-European tribes that arrived in the region about 4,000 years ago. Arabs applied the name \\"Kurds\\" to the people of the mountains after they had conquered and Islamicized the region. In the 1500s most Kurds fell under Ottoman Rule. Iraqi Kurds developed as a subgroup of the Kurdish peoples when Great Britain created the state of Iraq out of the Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement of World War I. The Kurdish people were expecting to soon gain independence from what they were promised in the Treaty of S√®vres in 1920, but this was quickly overturned in 1923, when the Treaty of Lausanne established the Republic of Turkey over Kurdistan's borders. In 1946 the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) was founded by Mulla Mustafa Barzani which pushed for Kurdish autonomy under the Iraqi government. In the year 1958 Abdul Karim Qasim made a coup against the British and the Republic of Iraq was established. The Kurds had hoped that now they would receive their promised rights, but the political environment was not favorable. So the KDP began an insurgency against the Government in Baghdad in 1961. Their insurgency was in part successful as in 1966 official Kurdish groups gained some rights with the Bazzaz Declaration and with the 1970 Peace Accord a principle of Kurdish autonomy was reached. In the 1970 Peace Accord, Kurdish cultural, social and political rights were recognised within fifteen points. But these rights were not implemented due to the willingness of the Arabs but rather because of political developments. Nevertheless, the Kurds had a period of greater liberty from 1970 to 1974. But in March 1975 the Iraq and Iran reached an agreement and within a few hours after the agreement, Iran stopped all support to the KDP, whose members and their families had the choice between go to exile to Iran or surrender to the Iraqi authority. Most KDP members chose to live in exile and the KDP declared the end of their insurgency. Therefore, in 1975, another political party emerged in Iraqi Kurdistan, led by Jalal Talabani‚Äîthe Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). Since the PUK was established, it lacked cooperation and engaged in violent conflict with the KDP over differing philosophies, demographics, and goals. From March 1987 until 1989 the Anfal campaign lasted, with which the Kurds were supposed to be arabized. During the Anfal campaign the Iraqi military attacked about 250 Kurdish villages with chemical weapons and destroyed Kurdish 4500 villages and evicted its inhabitants. The campaign culminated in the Halabja massacre in March 1988. =1991‚Äìpresent= After the Gulf War and an unsuccessful Kurdish uprising in 1991, Kurds fled back to the mountains to seek refuge from the Hussein regime. The United States established a safe-haven and no fly zone initiative in Iraqi Kurdistan for the Kurds in order for them to develop an asylum away from the Hussein regime. United Nations Security Council Resolution 688 in 1991 condemned and forbade \\"the repression of the Iraqi civilian population... in Kurdish populated areas.\\" After many bloody encounters, an uneasy balance of power was reached between the Iraqi forces and Kurdish troops, ultimately allowing Iraqi Kurdistan to function independently. The region continued to be ruled by the KDP and PUK and began to establish a stable economy and national identity. Iraqi Kurdistan built a socioeconomic infrastructure from scratch, completely independent from the centralized framework for the Baath regime. Though civil war broke out in the north between Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party and Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan from 1994 to 1998, Kurds were still able to maintain a democratic and prosperous foundation for their region. When the US invaded to oust the Hussein regime in 2003, the northern Kurdish border with Iraqi central state was moved considerably southward. This gave Kurds more access to water and oil resources, therefore increasing priorities within the region to establish steady relations with the Kurds. This new access also encouraged more investment within the region, softening political tensions and polarization. The US invaded Iraq in order to take down Saddam Hussein's regime and dissolve any threats of weapons of mass destruction. After the invasion, however, no evidence of mass destruction weapons was found to prove the US claim. After the fall of the regime, the United States government, with the help of ethnic leaders had to confront three issues: the nature of the future Iraqi government, how Shia representation was to be achieved in the government, and how Sunni re-enfranchisement was to be managed. Different opinions emerged on whether the Iraqi government should be centralized or not, how the US should respond to civil conflict between the Arabs and Kurds, and how previous promises to the Kurdish and Iraqi people would be achieved in a future state. Flickr ‚Äì The U.S. Army ‚Äì 1st 'Panthers' Battalion prepares to replace 'Warriors,' assume mission in east Rashid Kurdish people have played an important role in Iraqi state-building since the United States invaded in 2003. Many Kurds seek to build an autonomous federal state in the post-Hussein era, however, a solution for Kurdish problems in Iraq was not even mentioned in the 2004 UN resolution that established Iraq's interim government. = Article 140 = Article 140 of the 2005 Iraqi constitution vowed to place disputed areas under the jurisdiction of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) by the end of 2007. The three phases that were going to aid this process were normalization, census, and referendum. The normalization phase was supposed to undo the 'Arabization' policies Kurds faced from 1968 to 2003 that were designed to alter the demographic in the city of Kirkuk and other disputed areas to favor the Arab population. These policies included deportation, displacement, house demolition, and property confiscation. Institutionalized boundaries as a result of past gerrymandering were also to be reversed. After this normalization process, a census would talk place and the populous would choose to be governed by either the KRG or Baghdad. Article 140 was not implemented by 2007. At this time the Presidency Council also recommended to reattach all previously detached districts of Kirkuk. The Chemchamal and Kalar districts that were allocated to Sulaymaniyah Governorate in 1976 were to be returned to Kirkuk. Kifri, annexed to the Diyala governorate in 1976 was to be reattached, although it had been under Kurdish control since 1991. Lastly, the Tuz district would be reattached from the Salah ad-Din district. In 2008, the 140 Committee announced inaction on these initiatives. In 2008, the Iraqi, Kurdish and US governments came to the consensus that these types of reparations to the Kurdish people would not be able to be carried out without further negotiations and political agreements on boundaries. The US government faced many problems trying to implement Article 140. This was not an ideal form of reparation for many Kurds. After being displaced, many formerly Kurdish regions lacked in development and agricultural upkeep. Educational and economic opportunities were often greater for Kurds outside of these disputed territories, so many people did not want to be forced to return. =Disputed territories= Pro-independence rally in Erbil in September 2017 Disputed internal boundaries have been a core concern for Arabs and Kurds, especially since US invasion and political restructuring in 2003. Kurds gained territory to the south of Iraqi Kurdistan after the US- led invasion in 2003 to regain what land they considered historically theirs. One of the major problems in trying to implement Article 140 was a discrepancy in the definition of 'disputed area'. The article only refers to regions that would go through this normalization process as \\"Kirkuk and other disputed area\\". In 2003 Kurdish negotiator Mahmud Othman suggested that Kurdish majority areas below the Green line be attached to the KRG immediately, and 'mixed areas' should be questioned on a case-by-case basis. Sunnis felt as if Kurds should gain no additional land as a result of the US invasion. Reattaching Kirkuk districts to reflect the 1975 boundaries posed many problems to Iraqis and brought along unintended consequences. =2014 Northern Iraq offensive= thumbDisputed areas in Iraq prior to the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive. During the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, Iraqi Kurdistan seized the city of Kirkuk and the surrounding area, as well as most of the disputed territories in Northern Iraq. Culture and diversity =Religion= Yezidi Temple Before the spread of Islam, many Kurds were followers of Zoroastrianism, Mithraism, or local pagan beliefs. Kurds were assimilating these religious practices into their cultural domain as early as 800 BCE. Arab conquests, however, began in the seventh century AD, eventually overpowering Kurdish resistance. Over time, Sunni Islam became the dominant religion of the Kurdish people, following the Shafi school. There is a minority Shia population, 99% of the Fayli Kurds and 99% of shabak Kurds Muslim is shia, who live in central and south-eastern Iraq. Though Islam is thought to be a religion of governance as well as spirituality, Kurds made sure to keep spiritual identity separate from national identity. Today, many Muslim Kurds do not consider themselves particularly religious when it comes to adhering to the call to prayer five times a day, but secondary practices of Islam have a stronghold in Kurdish culture. Following Islamic food restrictions, refraining from the consumption of alcohol, circumcising male newborns, and wearing a veil are all very popular customs among Kurds. A minority of Kurds, primarily in the Nineveh Governorate of Iraq, follow the Yazidism. Yazidism combines complex Kurdish cultural beliefs with Zoroastrianism and Islamic Sufi doctrine. It applies traditions of the Abrahamic religions such as the story of Adam and Eve, the importance of pilgrimage, and daily prayer ritual, to more mystical elements, focusing on the importance of ancestry and the four elements on the Earth. The religion is practiced in the Kurdish dialect of northern Iraqi Kurdistan, Kirmaji. Most Yazidi traditions are transmitted orally rather than through written text, making it difficult to source many Yazidi origins. =Language= In May 1931 the Kingdom of Iraq, still a part of the British Empire, issued a Language Law declaring Kurdish language of instruction in elementary and primary schools and the official language in several Qadhas in the Liwas Mosul, Arbil, Kirkuk and Suleimanya But the Language Law was not fully implemented, in the Governmental Offices in the Liwas of Kirkuk and Mosul the law has never been applied and following the release in independence of the Kingdom of Iraq by the British Empire in 1932, schools and Governmental Administration were arabized in the Qadhas of Kirkuk and Mosul. In Arbil of the 15 issues of the official gazette eight issues were in Arabic, six in Turkish and only one in Kurdish. By 1943 protests broke out either demanding the acknowledging of Kurdish as an official language or the independence of Kurdistan. Language has been foundational to the building of a national identity in Iraqi Kurdistan, for the vast majority of Kurdish peoples speak Kurdish. Kurdish belongs to the Iranian language group and is rooted in the Indo-European family of languages. Sorani and Kirmanji are the main two Kurdish dialects, so internal language factions are not common. Kirmanji was the favored dialect up until the World Wars, but by the 1960s Sorani became the dominant dialect among Iranian and Iraqi Kurds. A problem among Kurdish people is that they do not have a unified script for their language. Iranian and Iraqi Kurds have modified the Perso-Arabic alphabet, and Turkish Kurds use a Latinized alphabet. This creates unity within modern political borders but strains relations and effective communications transnationally. This lack of unity in scripture parallels Kurdish cultural history, for isolated Kurdish mountain tribes were often nomadic and therefore had a very limited written tradition. After political changes in Iraq in the 1990s, however, Kurdish was increasingly used in the regional administration and education system, given their greater autonomy. =Political parties= PDK Kurdistan KDP and PUK- controlled areas of Kurdistan A major weakness of Kurdish national cohesiveness has been the strength of tribal and regional factions, often resulting in strong breaks between political parties. The Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), founded by Masoud Barzani, leans toward conservative nationalism and has a strong presence in the north. Given their geographic location, they have historically relied on Turkey for international leverage. Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) has aligned itself with Marxist ideals during their liberation struggle and has a stronghold in the southern Iraqi Kurdistan. They have tended to seek support from Iran and Syria. Throughout the 1990s a continuous power struggle ensued over political representation in parliament and oil revenues, resulting in an armed conflict in 1994. Fighting again broke out in 1996, the KDP looked for assistance from the central Iraqi government and the PUK sought out support for the United States. This clash divided the two rival zones into \\"Barzanistan\\" and \\"Talabanistan\\", establishing two administrations, cabinets, parliaments, and state flags. Political party infighting ruined a chance for the Kurdish peoples to unify and establish an autonomous state, completely separate from the Iraqi central government. Within a factionalized atmosphere, other groups established a presence, such as the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), radical Islamist groups, and other Turkish political groups. The PKK has been a major party seeking state autonomy and cultural, linguistic, and ethnic rights for Kurds in Turkey. Kurdish leaders in Iraq have pushed for the prosperity of divided local governments rather than an independent state; this is because leadership is derived from tribal legitimacy, rather than political institutions. Talabani and Barzani, for instance, did not come from the most populous Kurdish tribe, but rather from well-organized tribes. This could be an inhibitor to democracy in the region since those trying to preserve the status quo hold power but do not represent the majority. From 1986 to the present, Turkey has held different alliances with the KDP and PUK parties of Iraqi Kurdistan. Turkey has protected the KDP from the PKK and PUK. Turkey has also attacked the political parties PUK and PKK, while keeping good relations with the KDP, partially for access to cheap Iraqi oil. The KDP holds the representation of tribes along the Turkish border, so favorable relations with them ensures trading for Iraqi goods. Turkey then shifted its relationships to favor the PUK party. Since this party sat in the southern region of northern Iraq, it had stronger relations with the central Iraqi government. After the independence referendum of 2017 the relations between Turkey and political parties in the KRG cooled down. National identity Throughout the 1990s, when Kurds were given regional control after the Gulf War and a no-fly zone was established, a stronger Kurdish identity began to form. This has stemmed from increased international support and the pull-out of the Iraqi central government from Iraqi Kurdistan. The Kurdish language crossed over into the public sphere, taught and spoken in schools, universities, the administration, and the media. There has also been an influx of national symbols, including the Kurdish flag, a Kurdish hymn, and public recognition of the Kurdish people. Development of Kurdish infrastructure has also become an integral aspect of their successful autonomy. Previously dependent on the socioeconomic infrastructure of Baghdad, Kurds were able to efficiently build up their region, physically and politically, from scratch. They built a fully functioning independent government autonomous from the Baath regime. They were able to manage local governments, establish free and active Kurdish political parties, and institutionalize a Kurdish parliament. With these developments, the de facto Kurdish government gained recognition for the first time in the international sphere. They have quasi-official representation in Turkey, Iran, France, Britain, and the United States. Though Kurdish people had some success in forming a national identity, there have been factors that have stunted its growth. Under the state of Iraq, Kurds were subjugated to the nationalism process for all Iraqis, given the arbitrary state lines. Kurds were starting to think of themselves as Iraqis, rather than focus on their collective development as Kurds. Nationalism was also hindered by divisions of tribes, languages, and geography that prevented the Kurdish people from identifying completely as one unit. No leader has yet to rise above this tribal status and the infighting hurts those fighting for Kurdish autonomy because they are divided by other factions or political boundaries. For example, during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, from 1980 to 1988, Turkey supported one Iraqi Kurdish group over another in order to play the Iraqi Kurds off against Turkey's own rebellious Kurds. Technology and telecommunications have helped Kurds to establish an ethno-national group, or self-defined national identity. Though this has developed a sense of pride and definition across political boundaries, it reveals a less promising scenario of Kurdish statehood. It has disclosed disparities across countries about which Kurdish populations are gaining international support and relief. For Iraqi Kurds, this international network was established after the Gulf War of 1991. They had new forms of financial and political support as well as the resources and the legal geographic space to advance their nationalist agenda. This access allowed Kurdish language publications, texts, educational programs, and cultural organizations to flourish‚Äîbenefits that Kurds only were experiencing within the state of Iraq and in European academic institutions. Transnational social and cultural networks for Kurds were still tied to characteristics of certain states. Autonomy With a Kurdish diaspora, legitimizing a Kurdish state is even more unlikely. Many Turkish Kurds have migrated outside of their historic homeland in the southeast of Turkey, westward for more prosperous lives. Turkish Kurds have also come to an agreement with the Turkish government. Since the capture of their leader Abdullah Ocalan in 1999, Kurds have limited their activism to fighting for cultural, social and educational rights within the state of Turkey. Due to Turkey's pending EU application, Turkey has been moving to grant these rights. With this improved relationship, Turkish Kurds have accepted their place within the Turkish state. This is just one instance of how Kurds are focusing on improving their livelihood within already established state lines rather than pushing for a restructuring of political borders in the Middle East. Though Iraqi Kurds have the greatest opportunity to push for autonomy because of the Iraqi state's government restructuring, Kurds in neighboring countries do not have the leverage to push for the independence that would threaten pre-existing states. Even at a crossroads for the political future of Iraqi Kurds, Barzani and Talabani have both opted for establishing a federalist system within post-Saddam Iraq in order to ensure the future wellbeing of the Kurdish people. On 1 July 2014, Massud Barzani announced that \\"Iraq's Kurds will hold an independence referendum within months.\\" After previously opposing the independence for Iraqi Kurdistan, Turkey has later given signs that it could recognize an independent Kurdish state. On 11 July 2014 KRG forces seized control of the Bai Hassan and Kirkuk oilfields, prompting a condemnation from Baghdad and a threat of \\"dire consequences,\\" if the oilfields were not relinquished back to Iraq's control.

Originally established as a small retail drug store in 1900, the company was incorporated in 1919 and became one of the largest commercial firms in the city. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. History Standard Drug Company was originally named \\"Hopkins and Bethea\\" after W.E. Hopkins and Oscar Bethea, who founded the company in January 1900 on 22nd Avenue next to Weidmann's Restaurant. The company moved to a three-story building at 2408 5th Street in 1906. That building was included as a contributing property to the Meridian Urban Center Historic District in 1979, known as the \\"Hopkins and Bethea Building\\". The building had been demolished by the time the Meridian Downtown Historic District (which combined two smaller districts in Meridian, one of which was Urban Center) was listed in 2007. As the city grew, so did Hopkins and Bethea. The business was incorporated in 1911, with W.E. Hopkins as president, and the name was changed to Standard Drug Company. \\"Kimborough's Antiseptic\\" was a popular product among locals. The product was meant to treat minor cuts and scratches, but most of its popularity was linked to the fact that in included alcohol. Another product branded by Standard Drug‚ÄìJamica ginger‚Äìwas also popular for its alcoholic content during prohibition. The latter, however, left some over- users paralyzed for life with what was dubbed \\"Jake leg.\\" When Bethea left the company to enroll in Tulane Medical School, a bookkeeper named Ernest A. Morrison bought into the partnership with Hopkins. The company continued to grow, and by 1919, the company was large enough to warrant a new building. The Meridian Medical College property at 25th Avenue and 6th Street was purchased and demolished, making way for a new three-story building with over of floor space. In the early 1910s, the company began diversifying and added other products such as cosmetics, school supplies, and children's toys to their profit margin. During World War I, when the rest of the country was experiencing a shortage of quinine (used to treat malaria), Standard Drug was able to keep a steady supply, which allowed them to remain in business and make a great deal of money. When Hopkins died in 1941, Morrison took over as president of the company, appointing J.L. Hopkins (W.E. Hopkins's son) as vice president and his own son, Edgar H. Morrison, secretary and treasurer. When Morrison died in 1959, J.L. Hopkins took over, and when Hopkins died, Edgar Morrison took over. Edgar Morrison was the final president of the company, presiding over its sell and transfer to Durr-Fillauer Medical out of Montgomery, Alabama. Standard Drug Company building The building at 601 25th Avenue, built in 1919, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. The building has a utilitarian design, simple and rectangular, a style common to commercial and industrial buildings of its construction era. The southeast corner of the building, which faces the intersection of 6th Street and 25th Avenue, is constructed of yellow-brown brick with a decorative cornice while the \\"rear\\" (north and west sides) of the building is constructed of lower grade red brick. A parking lot is located on the rear side. One loading dock is located on the south side of the building, and another (added in the 1970s) is located on the northeast side of the building. The first floor contains three rooms, and all of the walls are stuccoed. From east to west, the rooms were used for office space and product display, shipping and receiving, and storage. The office room was originally floored with linoleum, although carpet was added later. The room was originally only split into two areas, the office area having a pressed tin ceiling, but a vault was added in the 1920s, and a private office was partitioned off in 1941. A computer room was later built in the southeast corner. The shipping and receiving room contains an elevator in the center of the room which leads to the upper floors. Loading docks are located on either side of the room. The storage room is empty except for staircases leading to the upper floors. The second floor was only partitioned into two rooms. Milk of magnesia, iodine, merthiolate, mercurochrome, and other drugs were manufactured in the east room while the west room was used mainly for storage. A small corner of the west room was known as the \\"acid room\\"; the floor was covered with sand to prevent damage. The third floor was primarily used for storage.

Player characters can roll and take cover to avoid attacks. This ability was described by a Visceral Games developer as essential, as it \\"felt dumb/terrible not to have it\\" and that they have been \\"making Isaac more responsive\\", as they \\"want the horror to come from the terrible things that happen in the game; not from the horror that something is moving slowly towards you and you can't shoot it because the game controls like a piece of crap.\\" The cover system is also described as \\"organic\\" in nature; for example, the player does not need to \\"walk up to certain tagged things and press the cover button; Clarke ... just does the action that is appropriate for the given situation.\\" Aside from the returning Necromorphs, Dead Space 3 features a large cast of new enemies. One example is the Fodder, whose attacks change depending on how it is dismembered; while another is the Nexus, an insect-like giant that can crush or swallow people whole. Other obstacles in Dead Space 3 include a new human enemy, Unitologist soldiers; and environmental hazards like falling machinery and a giant mining drill. The Bench weapon upgrade system from Dead Space and Dead Space 2 has been redesigned as a new upgrading system called the \\"Weapon Bench\\". Here, players are able to construct new weapons from parts gathered throughout the game. The bench provides two main frames to start with‚Äîa light one-hand frame and a heavy two-hand frame‚Äîand players can build new weapons and put two weapons together (for example, a plasma cutter and a flamethrower). Examples of weapon functions include an electric rivet gun and an incendiary buzzsaw launcher. If a player does not want to build a weapon from scratch, they can choose from ready-made blueprints, including classic Dead Space and Dead Space 2 weapons. Built weapons can also be shared in co-op mode.Dead Space 3: Your Questions Answered =Co-operative mode= Dead Space 3 has a drop-in/drop-out online co-op mode for its campaign, which was announced at Electronic Arts's E3 2012 press conference, stating that it will unlock \\"additional story details and gameplay mechanics only found when playing as the co-op character, EarthGov Sergeant John Carver.\\" When a second player joins the hosting player via Xbox Live, they step into Carver's shoes. To facilitate this, the game is written in such a fashion that Carver can either accompany Clarke or stay with the other non- player characters, and seamlessly transition from one role to the other, without having any effect on the plot. Carver's presence unlocks three co-op- only side missions, mostly concerning Carver's past as an EarthGov soldier, his troubled relationship with his wife and child, and his guilt over their deaths in a Necromorph outbreak. Additionally, each player has alternate experiences as a result of their characters' dementia. For example, the player controlling Carver will find toy soldiers in a biology facility, while the player controlling Clarke will not see them. Co-op also puts the players in separate situations: when Carver tries to open a certain door, he suddenly becomes trapped in his own mind (echoing a similar situation in Dead Space 2). Clarke must protect him from a sudden surge of Necromorphs until Carver can free himself. A Visceral Games employee has confirmed it was \\"always intended to have co-op in Dead Space\\", citing co-op supporting game System Shock 2 as a source of inspiration for the Dead Space series. He also pointed out that if the player chooses to play alone, Carver \\"may appear at some points (as do other non-player characters) but for the most part he is not there.\\" Plot =Setting and characters= Like the other titles in the Dead Space franchise, Dead Space 3 takes place in the 26th century. Mankind has colonized the stars but is in desperate search of new energy sources. One potential method was found in the Chixulub crater on Earth: an extraterrestrial artifact, dubbed the \\"Black Marker\\", which produces a constant electromagnetic field in defiance of the law of conservation of energy. Though human scientists hoped to harness the Black Marker for its unlimited energy potential, they soon discovered that the purpose of its field is to re-animate and mutate dead flesh, resulting in outbreaks of \\"Necromorphs\\". EarthGov immediately shut down the project, but a number of Red Markers, reverse- engineered copies of the Black Marker, had already been created and needed to be hidden; even worse, one of the project's lead researchers, Michael Altman, went public with it, promising that the Markers were sent to \\"make us whole\\" through a process called \\"Convergence\\". A religious movement, Unitology, seeks the Markers in the hopes of unlocking salvation. Isaac Clarke (Gunner Wright), the protagonist of the franchise, has already survived two outbreaks of Necromorphs, as chronicled in the first two installments of the series. He is joined in this game by Ellie Langford (Sonita Henry), who also survived the second game, as well as two EarthGov soldiers, Capt. Robert Norton (Robert Gant) and Sgt. John Carver (Ricardo Chavira), in an attempt to end the Necromorph threat once and for all. =Story= The game opens in 2314, on Tau Volantis, an ice-covered planet with an irregularly-shaped moon, where Sovereign Colonies Armed Forces (S.C.A.F.) Privates Tim Kaufman (Scott DeFalco) and Sam Ackerman (Brad Raider) are attempting to retrieve a mysterious object called the Codex for Dr. Earl Serrano. After fleeing Necromorphs and finding the codex, Ackerman dies in an avalanche, forcing Kaufman to report alone to his commanding officer, General Mahad. Mahad, being the only other survivor, executes Kaufman, purges the Codex data, and commits suicide. The main cast of Dead Space 3. From left: Isaac Clarke, Jennifer Santos, Austin Buckell, Ellie Langford, Cpt. Robert Norton, and Sgt. John Carver. 200 years later, Isaac Clarke and Ellie Langford became a couple following the incident on Sprawl, but had broken up prior to the events of Dead Space 3 due to Isaac's trauma-induced emotional distance. Taking Isaac from his apartment located on the Moon, Captain Robert Norton and Sergeant John Carver of EarthGov explain that they require Isaac's help to find Ellie and her missing team. Fleeing, the trio is attacked by Unitologist soldiers, who see Isaac as a threat, due to his destroying two Markers in the previous games. During the escape, a Unitologist contingent led by Jacob Danik (Simon Templeman) activates a Marker near the colony, causing yet another Necromorph outbreak. Isaac, Carver, and Norton use this outbreak to their advantage, managing to escape aboard the USM Eudora. Norton traces Ellie's last transmission to Tau Volantis and the 200-year-old ruins of its colony. The group tries to reach Ellie's SOS signal; however, the Eudora breaks apart due to mines left in orbit of the planet. Norton, Carver, and Isaac manage to escape the exploding Eudora, reaching the derelict CMS Roanoke, which is infested with Necromorphs. They succeed in rescuing the \\"Marker Team\\", consisting of Ellie, Jennifer Santos (Michelle Anne Johnson), and Austin Buckell (Frank Ashmore), and Isaac learns about Ellie and Norton's new relationship. Isaac soon discovers that Tau Volantis is the Marker Home World, and that the expedition 200 years ago involved a Machine and the phrase \\"turn it off\\". Despite Norton's protests that any such attempt would be a suicide mission, the team attempts to land on Tau Volantis; however, mines and debris tear the shuttle apart and separate Isaac and Carver from the rest of the crew. Discovering Buckell, who helps them before dying from hypothermia, Isaac and Carver are able to locate the others, and plan to track down the Machine. Finding a recording from General Mahad, it's discovered that 200 years ago SCAF had discovered Necromorphs buried beneath the planet and experimented on them, only for an outbreak to occur; as a result, Mahad's team murdered all survivors and destroyed all evidence to prevent further outbreaks. Isaac frequently finds himself clashing with Norton, who sees Isaac as competition for Ellie's love; it's soon discovered that the Unitologists inexplicably followed them to Tau Volantis, before Norton explains he betrayed Isaac and plans to exchange him to Danik for a ship to return home. Danik, going against his deal, attempts to murder Norton along with Isaac and Carver; after the trio escapes following Necromorph interference, Norton attempts to murder Isaac, forcing him to kill Norton in self-defense. Isaac, Carver, Ellie, and Santos go to an abandoned science facility on the side of a mountain. Santos has found records of a Codex located there, created by someone named Rosetta. After Santos dies during the ascent, the team manages to reassemble a frozen Rosetta, who is found to be an alien. Experiencing a vision, Isaac discovers Tau Volantis is not the Marker homeworld, but a homeworld of aliens who, like humanity, discovered the Markers and were consumed by them. The planet's moon is actually a Necromorph, and is the result of the Convergence event foretold by Unitology; before it could complete and consume all life on the planet, a Machine was built to freeze it and Tau Volantis and force the \\"Brother Moon\\" into a state of dormancy. The command to \\"turn it off\\" is actually a command transmitted from the Markers themselves, who wish the Machine disabled to reawaken the Brother Moon so that it can summon more of its kind and consume the universe. Isaac, acquiring the Codex, discovers Danik is holding Ellie and Carver hostage. Ellie, confessing her love for Isaac, sacrifices herself to allow Isaac and Carver to escape, and the two pursue Danik down into the planet to the Machine. Isaac and Carver find a video log from Serrano, who explains that with Codex, the Machine can either free the moon or destroy it. They regain control of the Codex, but Danik reveals Ellie is still alive and he is holding her hostage. Danik threatens to kill Ellie unless he is given the Codex. Carver, believing in redemption, suddenly grabs the Codex from Isaac and throws it to Danik, who lets go of Ellie to catch it. Danik immediately uses it to turn off the Machine, resuming the Convergence Event. The incomplete Necromorph Moon, free of the Machine's control, descends towards Tau Volantis, instantly stripping away the surface layers of the planet under which the city and the Machine are buried. The ancient alien necropolis‚Äîa tomb, warning, and protective seal created by the aliens against the Necromorphs‚Äîbegins to disintegrate as it ascends to be consumed. One of the first casualties is Danik himself, impaled by a piece of falling debris. Realizing that there is no way to stop such an overwhelming force and escape safely, Isaac kisses Ellie goodbye, and she escapes on a shuttle. Isaac and Carver then work together to fight their way through the crumbling flying city to the Codex. Being pulled up into the planet-sized organism, they reactivate the Machine and set it to reject Convergence, which stops the Event and causes the moon to crash into Tau Volantis along with the remains of the alien city. Ellie grieves for Isaac, but takes solace in realizing her ship's instruments no longer detect the Marker signal. The Necromorph Moon is now falling apart as it descends into and merges with the planet. Ellie sets a course for Earth and leaves the orbit of Tau Volantis. In a post-credits scene, a static-filled audio log briefly plays, with Isaac calling out to Ellie. =Awakened= After the battle with the Brethren Moon over Tau Volantis, Isaac Clarke and John Carver wake up on the surface of Tau Volantis, shocked to find that after falling to their near deaths, they are still alive. They then make their way across the surface of the frozen planet, finding memories of the horror they had faced, and in the process learning that the Marker's effects are still present and Necromorphs are still spawning. Issac realizes that the Moon they defeated must have been able to awaken the other Moons scattered throughout space before it died. They then find out about a Unitologist ship that can take them back to Earth so they can warn the population. After witnessing many ships lift off, they manage to find a ship only to find out that the ShockPoint Drive in the ship is missing. It can only take them to the CMS Terra Nova wreck in orbit. Once aboard the Terra Nova, Isaac and Carver must find a way to restore power to the derelict ship and find a new Shockpoint Drive in order to return to Earth. However, within the halls of the old Sovereign Colonies ship, they encounter the remnants of The Circle who've taken refuge inside and begun a new following in the name of the Necromorphs. After dealing with members of the Circle, as well as their own insanity, Isaac and Carver find a new ShockPoint Drive, but Isaac is now losing his mind. He protests installing the ShockPoint Drive into the ship, because he thinks that if they install it, the Brethren Moons will follow them to Earth, and kill everyone living there. After Isaac and Carver have a hallucination of fighting each other, the hallucination is interrupted by another hallucination, in which the Brethren Moons reveal that they were only slowing Isaac and Carver down, and that they have known where Earth was all along. After regaining his sanity, Isaac admits that Carver was right all along. He agrees to install the Shockpoint Drive into the Terra Nova. Carver recalls that the Audio Logs hinted that the reactor could power up enough energy in the engine to go into shockspace and return to Earth. They connect the ShockPoint Drive to the reactor and overload the reactor by dumping plutonium cores into it, generating enough power to enter shockspace. They manage to activate the ship and return to Earth. After attempting to communicate with Earth, they hear the sounds of static and transmissions of people being slaughtered by Necromorphs. When they look out of the cockpit of the Terra Nova, they see that the Brethren Moons have already arrived and are attacking Earth. One of the Moons comes up in front of the Terra Nova, crashing into the ship and knocking Isaac and Carver unconscious. Development In September 2011, a video was posted via IGN suggesting that Dead Space 3 was in production, showing art in development for the game. Visceral Games had leaked some information about the game including the setting and story. On May 7, 2012, it was announced that a new Dead Space title was being developed for release by March 2013. Game Informer unveiled an image from Dead Space 3 showing Isaac wearing a fur- covered snow suit somewhere on Tau Volantis. The game was shown at E3 2012 in June 2012. That same month, Electronic Arts president Frank Gibeau stated \\"we definitely do not want to piss off our fans\\" by toning down the horror content in Dead Space 3. \\"We tried to open up the accessibility of the [franchise] a little bit by adding a little bit more action, but not undermining the horror.\\" Producer John Calhoun has stated that the game was designed from the ground up to support drop-in, drop-out cooperative play. However, according to producer Chuck Beaver co-op mode was introduced in the middle of production. According to executive producer Steve Papoutsis a cooperative mode was considered late in the development of the first game in the series, but the idea dropped due to insufficient time to implement it and incompatibility with the game's story. Marketing and release The limited edition of Dead Space 3 came with two bonus suits and weapons. GameStop pre-orders included the EG-900 SMG, a compact Earthgov submachine gun sporting an internal hyper- accelerator. The PC edition of the game will only be available through EA's Origin service ‚Äì it can still be purchased at retail, but must be linked to an Origin account. A playable demo was released on January 22, 2013, on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network. Xbox 360 owners who signed up on the official Dead Space website were able to access the demo one week early. =Launch event= The official launch event for Dead Space 3 in the UK took place at Game in Swansea Morfa Retail Park, the winning branch of the Electronic Arts competition between all Game stores in the UK asking how would they launch Dead Space 3. The launch event was held there on 7 February at 10:00PM, the night before the release. =Downloadable content= The first story downloadable content (DLC) Dead Space 3: Awakened was released on March 12, 2013 on all platforms and an official launch event was held on the day of its release. The story of the DLC takes place immediately after the ending of Dead Space 3. There is also the Tau Volantis Survival Kit (DLC) which is a compilation of individual item packs. The item packs contained in the Survival Kit are the following: the Bot Accelerator Pack, Sharpshooter Pack, Marauder Pack, and the Tundra Pack. Reception =Critical response= Dead Space 3 received generally positive reviews from critics upon release. Game Informer gave the game 9.75/10 saying, \\"Dead Space 3 evolves the winning formula into a title not only befitting of the fantastic series, but also one of the best games of this generation.\\" Polygon gave the game 9.5/10 saying, \\"Visceral hasn't just avoided screwing up its game with co-op ‚Äî it has made it feel natural and at home, and has done it without impacting the single-player experience in any negative way. That alone would be enough to make Dead Space 3 an achievement. But the new crafting system and bigger, more open level structure join co-op to make Dead Space 3 one of the best action games in years.\\" GameSpot gave the game 8/10 saying, \\"This is a game rife with options and flexibility, building on the strengths of the franchise with clever new ideas that let you tailor the experience to your liking. It hits a few sour notes in its story and struggles at times when it steps away from the core combat, but Dead Space 3 is a thrilling and worthwhile sequel.\\" Hardcore Gamer gave it 4/5 saying, \\"Sure, it has a larger scope and a more intriguing storyline, but there are some questionable design choices mixed in with the thought of d√©j√† vu. Regardless, Dead Space 3 retains its horror brilliance in offering a moody, atmospheric adventure full of exciting events.\\" Destructoid gave the game 8/10, stating \\"Dead Space 3 could have been the best entry in the series, and in many ways, it still does provide some of the franchise's most energetic, thrilling, entertaining moments. The changes thrown into the game inevitably damage its charm, though, and make this a step down from its prequels.\\" GamesTM had a list of pros and cons, summing up with \\"boss fights in Dead Space 3 are particularly forgettable, while the narrative occasionally lacks the courage of its convictions and the end-game reveal is a little too ludicrous to take seriously...where the new concepts work, they add to the solid core and are enhanced by Visceral's excellent pacing and its impeccable audio and visual design work, not to mention what remains the best HUD design in all of video games.\\" Official Xbox Magazine (UK) gave the game 7/10, \\"Most of the things fans loved about the original are here, and the new features are cleverly mixed with the existing ones, but in terms of the structure, Visceral is treading water. Dead Space isn't dead by any means, but the spark isn't quite there.\\" Eurogamer gave the game 7/10, saying \\"Dead Space 3 is a contradiction. Gorgeous but scruffy; tightly packed yet stretched too thin; often frustrating, frequently thrilling and bursting at the seams with stuff, not all of which fits comfortably inside the boundaries the series has set for itself. It's certainly not a great game, except perhaps as a poster child for the kitchen-sink development mentality of a console generation in its twilight months.\\" Edge gave Dead Space 3 a 7/10, saying \\"The sense of immersion is about as unparalleled as you can get... But the campaign feels overlong and stretch marks begin to appear towards the end of the roughly 20-hour adventure. This game could have benefited from some strategic dismemberment of its own, performed by a shrewd editor who knows how to sever redundant limbs.\\" VideoGamer gave the game a 5/10, \\"Dead Space 3 is a let down because it's not a very good action game, and a really substandard horror game. It is devoid of ideas, hung up on laborious combat and obsessed with making even the exciting seem boring. In truth, it's a bit of a shocker.\\" =Sales= In the United States and the United Kingdom, Dead Space 3 was the top-selling game in February 2013. It sold 605,000 copies in North America during its debut month. The title, along with Crysis 3, another EA title that was released in the same month, failed to meet the company's sales expectations. =Awards= Dead Space 3 was nominated for two awards from the NAVGTR Awards for Sound Effects, and Use of Sound. Cancelled sequel VideoGamer.com reported information from a confidential source concerning the cancellation of Dead Space 4 following \\"lower than anticipated\\" sales of Dead Space 3, having fallen 26.6%. This information tallied with EA Labels president Frank Gibeau's comment that \\"In general we're thinking about how we make this a more broadly appealing franchise, because ultimately you need to get to audience sizes of around five million to really continue to invest in an IP like Dead Space.\\" EA's Peter Moore wrote of the story on GamesIndustry.biz forum, \\"Standard, shoddy website journalism recipe.\\" EA described the report as \\"patently false.\\" In June 2013, EA Games boss Patrick Soderlund stated that although the franchise had not been cancelled and remained an important brand for the company, developer Visceral Games had not been asked to start work on a sequel and were instead involved in a new project, which was later confirmed to be Battlefield Hardline.http://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-series-not- killed/1100-6410351/ On October 17, 2017, Visceral Games was shutdown by EA, officially leaving the future of the series uncertain.

The first island chain refers to the first chain of major archipelagos out from the East Asian continental mainland coast. Principally composed of the Kuril Islands, Japanese Archipelago, Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan (Formosa), the northern Philippines, and Borneo; from the Kamchatka Peninsula to the Malay Peninsula. Some definitions of the first island chain anchor the northern end on the Russian Far East coast north of Sakhalin Island, with Sakhalin Island being the first link in the chain.Wiktionary: first island chain However, others consider the Aleutians as the farthest north-eastern first link in the chain. The first island chain forms one of three island chain doctrines within the Island Chain Strategy. First and second island chains The first island chain has its purpose in Chinese military doctrine. The People's Republic of China views the first island chain as the area it must secure and disable from American bases, aircraft and aircraft-carrier groups, if in defending itself it must tactically unleash a pre-emptive attack against an enemy. The aim of the doctrine is to seal off the Yellow Sea, South China Sea and East China Sea inside an arc running from the Aleutians in the north to Borneo in the south.‚ÄúAsia's balance of power: China‚Äôs military rise: There are ways to reduce the threat to stability that an emerging superpower poses‚Äù, The Economist, dated 7 April 2012. According to reports by American think tanks CSBA and RAND, by 2020, China will be well on its way to having the means to achieve its first island chain policy.‚ÄúChina‚Äôs military rise: The dragon‚Äôs new teeth: A rare look inside the world‚Äôs biggest military expansion‚Äù, The Economist, dated 7 April 2012.  Geographic location  The first island chain is roughly situated in waters claimed and controlled by the PRC. These include the South China Sea, within the Nine-Dash Line, the East China Sea within the Okinawa Trough. The boundary between Okinawa and China lies between Japan and Taiwan.  Strategic value  US General Douglas MacArthur pointed out that before World War II, the US protected its western shores with a line of defense from Hawaii, Guam, to the Philippines. However this line of defense was attacked by Japan with the Pearl Harbor bombing of 1941, thereby drawing the US into the war. The US subsequently launched the air Raid on Taipei (Taiwan at the time part of Japan's empire) and launched the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The WW2 victory allowed the US to expand its line of defense further east to the coast of Asia, and thus the US controlled the first island chain. Between the end of WW2 and the Korean War, MacArthur praised Taiwan, located at the midpoint of the first island chain, as an 'unsinkable aircraft carrier'. Meanwhile Mao Zedong launched a series of invasions of Taiwan but failed. In 1950 the PRC attempted to break through the US line of defense, but failed due to the naval superiority of the US Seventh Fleet. For 30 years, PRC ships were unable to pass between north and south mainland ports. In 1968 the PRC made a detour through the Pacific Ocean by the Opening of the South-North route. By 1979 shipping resumed across the Taiwan strait. During the Cold War and after the Korean war, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the 'Taiwan-US mutual defense pact' with the ROC (now terminated). It officially included Taiwan within the first island chain. For the purpose of containing the PRC, the US provided assistance (economic and other) to anti-communist regimes in East Asian islands. Taiwan and the Philippines are the weakest links in the chain; Taiwan lacking international status and the Philippines lacking sufficient military strength. Coupled with a string of political, economic, and diplomatic factors; the weak defense in the past 20 years; as well as the growing economic dependence of other Southeast Asian neighbors on mainland China; the PRC has been able to penetrate through this weak point. This has worried the US, Japan, South Korea, Australia, etc. Hence the US and China maintain a 'frightful balance' (ÊÅêÊÄñÂπ≥Ë°°) along the chain. In 2014 April, the United States Naval Academy assessed that the first island chain is the most effective point to counter any PLA invasion. The US can cut off the PLA Navy from entering the western Pacific, but also through the defense of other first chain countries predict the movements of the PLA. The US and first chain countries are able to coordinate because of the US military's freedom of navigation in the first chain block. US troops can effectively defend and counterattacks by the PLA. Especially if other first chain countries deploy their own underwater mines, submarine, and high-speed warships, the PLA stands little chance. According to the PLA, to dealing with these countermeasures requires greater naval technology and saving manpower costs. In 2016 December 9, Sina news detailed the US military force configuration in the first chain, including # naval bases and reconnaissance aircraft docked at Japan's aircraft carrier fleet # the US military's most advanced F-35, F-22, F-15, and F-16 fighter jets totalling 110 bases # South Korea entering a state of war and deploying THAAD, with a detection range of 3500 km, in response to North Korean missile threats # annual military exercises cooperation between the US, Philippines, and Thailand # THAAD and a growing bomber fleet in Guam's second island chain, which supports the first. = Taiwan = In the 'blockade chain' of the first island chain, Taiwan is the most critical. It is located at the midpoint of the first chain and occupies a strategic position. Controlling Taiwan can effectively cut off the strategic chokepoint between the East and South seas. It also provides a convenient channel to the second island chain, as well as to the rest of the Pacific. = Chinese mainland = Given that Japan is wary of China breaking through the first chain, Professor Meng Xiangqing of the PLA National Defence University Research Institute interviewed with the Global Times. Meng said there is a misconception that Japan is traditionally a sea- based country whereas China is land-based country. He said this view is false and that to the contrary, Zheng He sailed to the west, and for at least 2500 years, Chinese fishermen have been sailing around the South sea, so China has historically been both a naval and continental power. Gao Hong, an expert on Japan, said that the first island chain is a scheme by the US-Japan alliance to encircle and trap China. The first chain is to prevent China from accessing deep waters. Gao says this is a classic security consideration, which has given Japan some confidence. However, China has every right and reason to pass through the first chain, in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which guarantees freedom of passage without harm. But the biggest threat to the PLA would be land-based missiles and increased aircraft carriers and naval fleets. According to a 2018 report to the US Congress: * In 2013 September the PLA conducted a sea bomber training session, first launching a 6G bomber equipped with short-range anti-warship missiles across the Bashi channel on the first chain. That same year, the PLA Air Force began to switch to longer-range missiles, that is a 6K bomber equipped with long- range missiles. * Starting 2015, 6K bombers crossed the Bashi channel and Miyako strait of the first chain, reaching the western Pacific. * In 2016, the 6K bomber acquired defense capabilities from early warning aircraft systems (AWACS) and accompanying fighter jets. * Also in 2017 the PLA increased the number of 'circumnavigation missions' (i.e. circling above Taiwan). The PLAAF bombers already have the capacity to lock in on Taiwan and break through the first chain to carry operations, threatening the security of US bases in Guam and US-friendly countries in the Pacific. = Japan = The Cabinet of Japan passed a defense white paper emphasizing the 'threat of the Chinese navy'. In Japan's report on the frequent PLAN activities, there were many mentions of the first and second island chains. The movements of the PLAN are often linked to breaking through the island chains.Âú®Êó•Êú¨ËëóÂêçÈõúË™å„Ää‰∏ñÁïåÁöÑËâ¶Ëàπ„Äã‰∏≠ÔºåÊØèÊúüÈÉΩÂàäÁôªÁ∂ìÈÅéÊó•Êú¨Êµ∑ÂüüÂà∞Á¨¨‰∫åÂ≥∂Èèà‰ª•Â§ñÊ¥ªÂãïÁöÑ‰∏≠ÂúãËàπÈöªÁÖßÁâá„ÄÇÂú®Êó•Êú¨Èò≤ÂãôË´ñÂ£áÁöÑËÆÄËÄÖÁïôË®Ä‰∏≠ÔºåÂ§ßÈáèÊó•Êú¨ËÆÄËÄÖË°®ÈÅîËá™Â∑±ÁöÑ‰∏çÊªø„ÄÇ‰∏ÄÂÄãÂè´„ÄåÂúãÊîøÈ≥•Áû∞ÊâÄ„ÄçÁöÑÂçöÂÆ¢‰∏äÂØ´ÈÅìÔºö„Äå‰∏çÁÆ°ÊÄéÈ∫ºÁúã‰∏≠ÂúãÈÉΩÊòØ‰∏ÄÂÄãÂ§ßÈô∏ÂúãÂÆ∂ÔºåÈùûË¶ÅËá™Â∑±ÂÆöÁæ©ÊàêÊµ∑Ê¥ãÂúãÂÆ∂ÔºåÈÄô‰∏çÊòØÈñãÁé©Á¨ëÂêß„ÄÇÂ∞çÊñºÊù±‰∫ûÂ±ÄÂã¢ÁöÑÁ∑äËø´ÔºåÊó•Êú¨ÂúãÂÆ∂ÁöÑË°åÂãïÁ∑©ÊÖ¢ÔºåÈÄôÁúüËÆì‰∫∫ÊÑüÂà∞ÁÖ©Ë∫Å‰∏çÂÆâ„ÄÇ„Äç In 2009 July, Hong Kong's Asia Weekly published an article saying that Japan pushed 500 km towards China by stationing troops on the island of Yonaguni.

The current PLAN strategy imitates the defensive thinking of the Soviet navy during the Cold war. During the cold war, the Soviet navy drew the Sea of Okhotsk red line to warn periphery countries not to enter. Likewise the PLAN strategy imitates these methods to control the South, East, Yellow seas, etc. in the areas associated with the first and second island chains. As a result, the PLA is using many of the Soviet-era Cold war equipment and weapons. Japan's self defense force mainly plays the role of protecting US military bases and preserving military strength in the face of China. As for Japan's Territorial Protection Self- Defense Forces, which mainly rely on islands in southern Japan adjacent to the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, Japan has strong military advantages in anti-submarine, air defense and sea mine technologies. Previous experience in competing with the Soviet Union has given Japan a clearer direction to cooperate with the US military in confronting the PLA's naval and air forces.  Entities along the chain  According to a former director of the US Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, the most important entities on the chain are (in decreasing order of importance): Japan, Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. An extra fifth is added: India. Even though India is not part of the chain, it is part of the US‚ÄìIndia Pacific strategy.

Pdf. According to the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, human trafficking is defined as follows: ‚ÄúTrafficking in persons shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs.‚Äù Pdf. Prevalence According to Kapstein in the journal of Foreign Affairs, the industrial states have failed to put in much effort to alleviate the issue. He believes that the problem is not one of political capability, but political will. A challenge in combating human trafficking in Middle Eastern countries is that the governments deny there is a problem. The lack of political will is partially the result of empty threats from the international community, but most of it can be attributed to deeper economic forces and sociological factors at play. In her article in \\"Global Tides,\\" Stephanie Doe states that sex trafficking is a sensitive topic in the Middle East for various reasons. On one level, it suggests moral corruption, which implies the waning influence of Islamic values in society. On a more significant level, in most Middle Eastern countries, because the governments are responsible for preserving tradition and upholding Islamic authority, it challenges their ability to retain a nation unified by Islam. Consequently, if the government was to acknowledge sex trafficking as a problem, it could be interpreted as alluding to the state‚Äôs diminishing power. It is difficult to quantify how large the problem of human trafficking is because trafficked persons are usually kept out of sight and in inaccessible locations. Human trafficking is an underground activity and the victims are referred to as a ‚Äúhidden population.‚Äù The profits from this industry often go through a process of money laundering, making it difficult to trace the activities of traffickers. Girls and women who are sexually exploited by rape, forced prostitution, or sexual slavery are tainted with social stigmas for the rest of their lives. The link to sexual immorality further exacerbates this stigma. Once that link is created, the damage to the woman's reputation can never be undone. In 2003, a study published in the Journal of Trauma Practice found that 89 percent of women in prostitution wanted to escape. Additionally, 60-75 percent of women in prostitution had been raped and 70-95 percent had been physically assaulted. Types of trafficking in the Middle East For the majority of the 1990s, human trafficking was incorrectly defined as illegal migration, smuggling, or sex work. The UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons defines trafficking comprehensively: its focus is on coercion for the purpose of exploitation, and it precludes the possibility of legal consent by the victims of traffickers. In the Middle East, some of the most prevalent forms of human trafficking are forced labor of migrant workers, sexual enslavement and forced prostitution and camel jockeying of young boys. =Forced labor= Today slavery typically involves women and children being sold into involuntary servitude by the means of violence and deprivation. There is a clear lack of labor protection laws for domestic workers in the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries. The international community recognizes the trafficking of women and children as a modern form of slavery. Many migrant people, mainly from Asian states, are tricked into coming to the Middle East, where they find themselves in a forced labor situation or working for very low wages. Traffickers trap their victims by coercion, force, or fraud. The forced labor of migrant workers is especially prevalent in the oil-rich Persian Gulf states of Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The workers are frequently held to pay off the debt they have accumulated from the costs of travel and housing. Pdf. Trafficking from South Asia to the Middle East is a serious problem, with about 200,000 persons trafficked over 20 years, and 3,400 children over the last 10 years. The International Labor Organization estimates the minimum number of persons in forced labor in the Middle East and North Africa is around 230,000. A paper prepared for the Policy Analysis and Research Programme of the Global Commission on International Migration, gcim.org. =Sexual enslavement= Most commonly, but not exclusively, human trafficking is exploitation in the form of forced prostitution or sexual enslavement. Pdf. State authorities have typically confused sex trafficking with prostitution. Some young impoverished women are attracted to the sex industry because it appears to offer quick and easy money. Traffickers often lure desperate young women with the promise of a better paying job or higher education into a destination country where their documentation and passports are forcibly taken from them as soon as they arrive. These women often find themselves in slave-like situations. Once trafficked into the sex industry, traffickers control the women through physical and psychological means. Prostitution in the Middle East is strictly illegal, along with all sexual activity outside lawful marriage. The religious outlawing of extramarital sex reinforces this trade and consequently further bolsters the demand for prostitution. The issue is exacerbated by the lack of legislative actions taken by states to control prostitution and trafficking. =Camel jockeying= Even though the most common forms of human trafficking are sexual enslavement and forced labor, these are not the only cases. The type of trafficking that is quite unique to the Middle East is the forced camel jockeying of young boys. Camel racing is a particularly dangerous and violent practice that young boys are forced into against their will. Boys from Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are recruited around five years of age to be camel jockeys in Middle Eastern countries such as the United Arab Emirates. Their parents normally sell them to agents who go around poor districts in these countries and offer to take male children away to the UAE to work. These agents tell parents that the children will earn large sums of money that will be sent home to the families. The parents are typically deceived about the conditions of work. They are led to believe that the children are going to obtain good jobs and will have a better future than if they remain at home. Usually the boys do not know who is taking them abroad or for what purpose. Most of the boys are not aware they will become camel jockeys against their will. When they arrive in the UAE, the children are transferred to azbas, which are camel training complexes in the desert. The children are subject to several forms of abuse during their stay, including punishments such as a lack of food and electric shocks. Lack of food is a common practice because their owners try to maintain their weight at less than 20 kg (44 lbs) for racing purposes. Deaths and injuries of children during racing is another major concern. If children accidentally die during a race they are buried straight away to avoid police investigations of the death. The conditions in the azbas are very restricting. Children are not allowed to leave the camel training complex. They sleep on cardboard boxes, making them very prone to scorpion bites. The children rise at 4:00am to begin exercising the camels. Every day they take the camels for rides until 11:00am. Then they are allowed to rest for two hours before feeding and cleaning the camels. Then they exercise the camels again until nightfall. The children are supposed to be paid for their work but that is almost never the case. The agent usually takes the salary and keeps it without allocating any to the child or his family. Running away is a virtual impossibility for children deployed as camel jockeys since the azbas are usually in remote desert locations. Usually children leave when they become too old or heavy and are no longer considered suitable for camel racing. Other children are sent home because they become seriously injured from racing. Police or immigration rescues are virtually unknown in the azbas. Driving forces behind trafficking =Foreign migration= One of the major forces driving human trafficking in the Middle East is the large influx of foreign migration. Research conducted in 1996 on the routes of illegal migration, smuggling and trafficking concluded that over the period 1992-97, the majority of illegal migrants to Europe had originated from Iraq, China, Pakistan, India or Africa. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) notes trafficking of women from Ghana to Lebanon, Libya and EU countries, women for domestic service from Central and West Africa to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and even voluntary migrations of women from Ethiopia to the Middle East, where working conditions are considered to be virtual slavery. The Middle East is a destination region for men and women trafficked for the purpose of commercial and sexual exploitation. Wealthy Arab men from the Persian Gulf area have been known to rent flats that are ‚Äòfurnished with housemaids‚Äô for anywhere from a few hours to a few months. Most of the prostitutes and human trafficking victims tend to be from Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Pakistan. Very few countries in the Middle East are devoid of the commercial sex industry. =Poverty= Of the many locations where human trafficking is prevalent in the Middle East, most are characterized by poverty. Human trafficking is a market fueled by principles of supply and demand. Therefore, where there is poverty, there is a likely supply to meet the growing demand for sexual entertainment. Economic vulnerability increases the likelihood of women becoming sexual commodities for wealthy Arabs in the Persian Gulf area. Although there are overwhelming social implications, there also seem to be regional financial patterns that perpetuate this trend. Fewer work opportunities for women have led to prostitution as an alternative. For example, in Egypt, women from lower-class backgrounds see that a few nights in prostitution generates more money than one month‚Äôs work in the public sector. This makes Egypt a popular location for international sex tourism. Despite sex tourism being illegal, Egyptians find it hard to turn away Gulf hard currency due to their crumbling economy. The proliferation of prostitution, sex tourism, and misyar marriages can be understood as the consequence of uneven economic development, further exacerbated by principles of supply and demand. Persian Gulf nationals have the will and the means to pursue sexual entertainment, and poorer Muslim communities can supply services in return for financial security. Misyar marriages To avoid the repercussions of sex outside marriage, Middle Eastern men and women in certain countries engage in a common practice by the name of \\"misyar marriage\\", also called Nikah Misyar. This type of marriage was born for the sole purpose of physical pleasure. It can be defined as a ‚Äútemporary marriage,‚Äù or its literal translation, ‚Äútraveling marriage.‚Äù Pdf. Misyar marriages do not require cohabitation of the husband and wife, long-term commitment, welfare provisions to the wife, or the intention of procreating, which are all the elements of a traditional Islamic marriage. While misyar marriages do have a technical contract, the duration of the marriage is not explicitly stated in the contract but instead implied. Misyar marriages have been commonly referred to as ‚Äúlegal prostitution,‚Äù A marriage of this kind is not an option for a woman who wants to be viewed as respectable because it compromises many of her rights and basic values. Despite its controversial nature, misyar marriages are both religiously and legally accepted as valid marriages. According to Syed Ahmad, misyar marriages are popular in Islamic countries because it legitimizes sexual relations outside conventional marriages. Sheikh Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, a leading authority and one of the few remaining figures of Islamic scholarship, states that the misyar marriage is religiously legitimate. Al-Qaradawi adds that ‚Äúthere is no doubt that such marriage may be somehow socially unacceptable, but there is a big difference between what is Islamically valid and what is socially acceptable.‚Äù He is indicating that as long as both parties accept the terms of the marriage contract, they are legally married in the eyes of Allah. Misyar marriages purportedly prevent unmarried youth and widows from fulfilling their sexual desires outside marriage, which would traditionally be considered sinful. Misyar legitimizes these acts that would otherwise be seen as unlawful. The Middle East is well known for its strict observation of moral codes and sensitivity to the taboo subject of sex. In most societies of the Middle East where Islam is the dominant religion, premarital and extramarital sex is considered fornication. In a few countries, fornicators receive one hundred lashes of a whip with a crowd of witnesses for sins such as premarital sex. Zina is the word in many Middle Eastern countries for the concept of sexual misconduct by men and women. Despite all of these repercussions for extramarital sex, media coverage and human rights groups are revealing that prostitution is present and thriving in the Middle East. Misyar marriages also tend to exploit the economic vulnerability of women in poverty.

Celebrities such as Mick Jagger, Elton John and Peter Sellers wore designs from the shop which was at 430 King's Road in Chelsea from 1969‚Äì70 and then at 20 Kensington Church Street in Kensington 1970-72. History Mr Freedom was part of the counter-culture \\"Swinging London\\" scene around King's Road in 1960s' London. It followed the cult success of Roberts' earlier boutique, Kleptomania, which he had opened in 1965. Roberts bought the lease to the King's Road boutique, at number 430, in 1969 from Michael Rainey, who had owned another boutique with a cult following at that location, Hung On You. At Myles' suggestion, Roberts named the shop after the 1969 William Klein film Mr. Freedom, which was a spoof of the anti-war movement. Roberts' designs featured styles now considered typical of the era: broad-brimmed hats, close- fitting maxi dresses, silk-screened cartoon character images on jersey tops, and winged shoes. Bright colours were also characteristic of the clothing. Rather than continuing with the homespun hippie style popular among the youth during the 1960s, Roberts veered away from nostalgia. Mr Freedom carried styles that were \\"brash, pop art fashion\\", such as satin ties for men, satin jackets, T-shirt dresses with appliqued \\"satin stars, thunderbolts, and ice- cream cones\\". A dose of 1950s retro was added to the mix of influences by 1972. Roberts produced clothes for the boutique in collaboration with a number of other young avant-garde designers, \\"many of them gathered in from outside the pale of the fashion trade\\". The shop was described as having an \\"unquenchable enthusiasm for all things bright and in outrageously bad taste\\". In 1970, Elton John hired Roberts to design several concert outfits before he set out on an American tour. Roberts designed a \\"yellow boiler suit\\" with a piano appliqu√© on the back, and \\"white boots with green wings\\". The shop was known for kitschy design as much as the clothes themselves. An inflatable sex doll was used as a mannequin. Roberts operated Mr Freedom at the location at 430 King's Road until December 1970. In May 1971, the lease was taken by Myles and became Paradise Garage, selling Americana, with Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood selling 1950s rock and roll records from a backroom, before McLaren took over the shop in November 1971 and renamed it Let it Rock. Roberts moved Mr Freedom to a new location, at Kensington Church Street. The store sold Pop art furniture in addition to clothes, by designer Jon Weallans, who designed such items as a chair in the form of a pair of false teeth. Mr Freedom added a small restaurant to its basement in 1971, called Mr Feed'em. The interior design was noted in the media as a fascinating draw for the public: \\"Stylistically, it defies analysis. It is almost impossible to detect at what point the patient, period reconstructions shade into pastiche\\". It was noted at that time, that the restaurant was relatively expensive. Roberts closed the Mr Freedom boutique in 1972. In 1973, he opened the shop City Lights as a high-end tailor, and pursued other design projects during the 1970s. The kitsch and irony apparent in Mr Freedom's fashions had a lasting impact, not only on street fashion but even on Parisian couture designers.

Greene planned to organize a demonstration against the cr√®che but rescinded, citing medical reasons. The former and current activist received monetary donations from the Baptist church which had erected the display, in order to assist in Greene's surgery. Two months later, Greene announced his conversion to Christianity, a faith he left again one month later. Activism Greene is a former taxicab driver from San Antonio, Texas. He had history of atheist activism going back to 1998 when he challenged the way the city of Ontario, California stored and cared for nativity scenes.

From 2006 to 2015 he was president of the Akademie der K√ºnste at Berlin.  Life  Klaus Staeck grew up in the East German city of Bitterfeld.If not noted otherwise, all biographical information is taken from the entry \\"Staeck, Klaus\\". Munzinger Online/Personen ‚Äì Internationales Biographisches Archiv 31/2006. 5 August 2006 (accessed 10 April 2012), or from Klaus Staeck's biography on his personal website (accessed 10 April 2012). After passing the abitur in 1956 he moved to the West German city of Heidelberg where he lives down to the present day. From 1957 until 1962 Mr Staeck studied law at Heidelberg, Hamburg, and Berlin before taking both state exams. He was admitted to the German bar in 1969. Klaus Staeck is probably best known for his political poster art. He began to teach himself how to work as a graphic designer while pursuing his legal studies, creating posters, postcards, and flyers. In 1960, Mr Staeck became a member of Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). In the late 1960s he took part in local politics in Heidelberg. Over the years he created three hundred different motifs, drawing from current political discussions. He took sides for the poor, the environment, and for peace, urging his countrymen to join him and to interfere in political affairs. In his campaigns he employed claims such as, e.g., Deutsche Arbeiter ‚Äì die SPD will euch eure Villen im Tessin wegnehmen (\\"German workers: the SPD seeks to take away your villas in Tessin from you\\"), or Die Reichen m√ºssen noch reicher werden ‚Äì deshalb CDU (\\"The rich must become richer yet, therefore vote CDU\\"). First he made woodcut prints, while from 1967 onward he changed to screen printing. Mr Staeck managed to finance his political actions by selling his artwork in Edition Tangente publishing house which later came to be known as Edition Staeck. He worked together with other political artists and writers, most notably Joseph Beuys, Panamarenko, Dieter Roth, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell, Daniel Spoerri, G√ºnter Grass, Walter Jens, and Heinrich B√∂ll who publicly spoke out in his favour. At the beginning of the 1970¬¥s Staeck began his long time collaboration with Gerhard Steidl. So far, Klaus Staeck was sued in 41 cases for his artwork to be banned from public, to no avail.Klaus Staeck: Biografie . In: klausstaeck.de. 2004‚Äì2008. Accessed on 14 April 2012 (from his personal biography). Since 1986 Mr Staeck has been visiting professor at Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf. In April 2006 he was elected president of Berlin Akademie der K√ºnste, succeeding to Adolf Muschg who had stepped down from this position late in 2005. Klaus Staeck was awarded the first Zille prize for political graphic design in 1970, and the Gro√ües Bundesverdienstkreuz in 2007.

Numerical experiments show that the BPM has spectral convergence. Its interpolation matrix can be symmetric.  History and recent developments  In recent decades, the dual reciprocity method (DRM)Partridge PW, Brebbia CA, Wrobel LC, The dual reciprocity boundary element method. Computational Mechanics Publications, 1992 and multiple reciprocity method (MRM)Nowak AJ, Neves AC, The multiple reciprocity boundary element method. Computational Mechanics Publication, 1994 have been emerging as promising techniques to evaluate the particular solution of nonhomogeneous partial differential equations in conjunction with the boundary discretization techniques, such as boundary element method (BEM). For instance, the so-called DR-BEM and MR-BEM are popular BEM techniques in the numerical solution of nonhomogeneous problems. The DRM has become a common method to evaluate the particular solution. However, the DRM requires inner nodes to guarantee the convergence and stability. The MRM has an advantage over the DRM in that it does not require using inner nodes for nonhomogeneous problems. Compared with the DRM, the MRM is computationally more expensive in the construction of the interpolation matrices and has limited applicability to general nonhomogeneous problems due to its conventional use of high-order Laplacian operators in the annihilation process. The recursive composite multiple reciprocity method (RC- MRM),Chen W, \\"Meshfree boundary particle method applied to Helmholtz problems\\". Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements 2002,26(7): 577‚Äì581Chen W, Fu ZJ, Jin BT, \\"A truly boundary-only meshfree method for inhomogeneous problems based on recursive composite multiple reciprocity technique\\". Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements 2010,34(3): 196‚Äì205 was proposed to overcome the above-mentioned problems. The key idea of the RC-MRM is to employ high-order composite differential operators instead of high-order Laplacian operators to eliminate a number of nonhomogeneous terms in the governing equation. The RC-MRM uses the recursive structures of the MRM interpolation matrix to reduce computational costs. The boundary particle method (BPM) is a boundary-only discretization of an inhomogeneous partial differential equation by combining the RC-MRM with strong-form meshless boundary collocation discretization schemes, such as the method of fundamental solution (MFS), boundary knot method (BKM), regularized meshless method (RMM), singular boundary method (SBM), and Trefftz method (TM). The BPM has been applied to problems such as nonhomogeneous Helmholtz equation and convection‚Äìdiffusion equation. The BPM interpolation representation is of a wavelet series.

The solution of such problems involves: (1) The complex functions or a set of discrete measured data can be interpolated by a sum of polynomial or trigonometric function series. Then, the RC-MRM can reduce the nonhomogeneous equation to a high-order homogeneous equation, and the BPM can be implemented to solve these problems with boundary-only discretization. (2) The domain decomposition may be used to in the BPM boundary-only solution of large-gradient source functions problems.

It originally aired on April 5, 2012, on NBC. Plot Presented in the style of Ken Burns' documentary, The Civil War, what started as a casual disagreement about blankets and pillows blossoms into all-out war on the Greendale campus. After Star-Burns (Dino Stamatopoulos), a member of Abed's (Danny Pudi) team, Pillowtown, throws a pillow at one of Troy's (Donald Glover) team's (Blanketsburg) forts, it collapses, causing a pillow fight in the study hall. Dean Pelton (Jim Rash) convinces Jeff (Joel McHale) to organize a meeting to get Troy and Abed back together and build a blanket-pillow fort worthy of a Guinness world record. At the meeting, Troy gives Abed an \\"all-tomato\\", demanding that Abed demolish his pillow fort to make way for Troy's blanket fort, or else. Abed declines the ultimatum, and at midnight, members of Blanketsburg attack a fort made by Pillowtown. Troy then declares war on Pillowtown. Jeff wants the war to continue so that he will not have to go to classes, so he gives both teams an inspirational speech which keeps the war going. After Annie (Alison Brie) hears about this while treating injured players, she refuses to send text messages to Jeff or respond to his, and forcefully tells him to his face that Troy and Abed's friendship is at stake. After a humiliating injury from one of the members of Pillowtown, Pierce (Chevy Chase) gives Abed the blueprints to a doomsday device he concocted. After Troy finds out about his plan, he gets Ben Chang (Ken Jeong) to bring in his security force consisting of teenagers he hired in the episode \\"Contemporary Impressionists\\" to take down Pillowtown. After Chang's force starts winning the battle, Abed unleashes the doomsday device: Pierce attacking the teens in a full body pillow suit. Abed then sends an email to members of Pillowtown outlining Troy's lame tendencies, including distraction via shiny stuff and sudden inexplicable bouts of crying. When Troy receives the intercepted message from a hacker working for Blanketsburg, he sends a text message to Abed saying \\"You may be my best friend, but I'll be your LAST friend\\" and notes that no one else will have the patience to deal with Abed's issues. Once Jeff hears about the arguing, he sets up another meeting, hoping to gain peace. Abed and Troy then decide whoever wins the war gets to stay in the apartment, and the loser has to move out. The next morning, a great battle occurs in the cafeteria. The battle concludes after Dean Pelton announces the representative for Guinness was fired, and the war ends on a weary, inconclusive note when everyone promptly walks away. After everyone leaves, Abed and Troy continue pillow fighting, telling Jeff it will be the last thing they will ever do together. Jeff then tells them that signals that they like each other so much, they are willing to beat each other with pillows forever. Jeff then gives Abed and Troy \\"imaginary friend hats\\" he gave to them in the dean's office which they threw away. They become friends again. Jeff then reveals that he actually went to the Dean's office and \\"searched\\" for the friend hats, showing that he does take what's happening amongst his friends seriously even if he's not entirely sure why. During the war, Britta (Gillian Jacobs) tries to get photographs of the events that occurred, only to mess up every photo, except for the final one with Abed and Troy becoming friends again. In very Britta style, the narrator, played by Keith David who is later introduced as Elroy Patashnik in Season 6, reveals she was trying to get an image of light reflecting off a plate of waffles, and took her lone great picture by accident. Reception The episode was watched by 3.00 million American viewers and gained a 1.3 18-49 rating. This was a series low in viewers for the show, although it was NBC's highest rated program of the night. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 10 out of 10, calling it a \\"stellar episode, twisting a pop culture reference in a way that not only provided laughs but a well-told story with heart.\\" Barry Hertz of the National Post said \\"in a triumph of editing and plotting, we‚Äôre treated to not just a stellar parody of the oft-mocked documentary form, but a revealing and satisfying episode of Community itself, complete with strong characterization, story closure and wild, GIF-ready visuals to keep the Internet masses satiated.\\" Tim Surette of TV.com applauded the characters' roles in the episode, saying \\"There was enough attention to make sure that every character had a great role in the war even though the bulk of the episode was just presentation. And at the heart of it all, we all wanted Troy and Abed to eventually make amends.\\" Jenn Lee of BuddyTV said \\"While it wasn't an entirely dramatic episode (the mimicry took care of that), \\"Pillows and Blankets\\" didn't carry the same light-hearted tone as a typical Community storyline, which I appreciated, given the subject matter.\\" Pete Vonder Haar of the Houston Press gave the episode a more mixed review, saying \\"there were some really great touches this week: 'Nurse' Annie using a lint brush to clean feathers from the 'wounded' and administering IV Gatorade; the use of text messages as a substitute for soldiers' letters home; invisible friendship hats...but every time they returned to the documentary motif, I groaned. And the extensive battle scenes felt like filler more than anything else. There's plenty of fuel for further episodes, but I wasn't as taken with 'Pillows and Blankets' as Harmon and company intended.\\" References External links * \\"Pillows and Blankets\\" at NBC.com \\"Pillows and Blankets\\" at TV.com Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Community (season 3) episodes Category:Pillow fight ","title":"Pillows and Blankets"},{"id":"35425151","title":"Coco Jones"},{"id":"35425174","title":"Pietro Torri"},{"id":"35425195","text":"Aslan Ahmad Aslanov Aslan Ahmad Aslanov (Azerbaijani: Aslanov Aslan ∆èhm…ôd oƒülu) is a famous Azerbaijani journalist, Chairman of the Board of Azerbaijan State News Agency (AZERTAC), Honorary Culture Worker of the Azerbaijan Republic (2000), the holder of Tereggi medal (2005), Order for the Services to the Motherland (2010), Shohrat Order (2011), 20th Anniversary Medal of TURKSOY (2014), ‚ÄúHasan bey Zardabi‚Äù, ‚ÄúGolden Pen‚Äù and ‚ÄúSupreme Media‚Äù, Jubilee Silver Medal of the Commonwealth of Independent States awards.

According to the 1874 census, Ngati Te Wehi were registered as an iwi. They are the principle iwi of the Aotea Harbour iwi, with close ties and connections with Ngati Reko, Ngati Mahuta, Ngati Whawhakia], Ngati Patupo, Ngati Te Uru and Ngati Mahanga. NgƒÅti Te Wehi also have historical connections with NgƒÅti HauƒÅ, Ngati Whatua, Ngati Koata, Ngati Toa Rangatira, Ngati Mutunga, Ngati Ruanui, Ngati Tahinga, Ngati Paipai, Ngati Paiaka, Ngati Rangitauwwaro, Ngati Whare, Ngati Koura, Ngati Hourua, Te Wehiwhakaruru and Ngati Peehi. The Aotea Moana iwi all consider Mt Karioi and her Husband Karewa or Gannet Island to be sacred. NgƒÅti Te Wehi have tribal holdings in Te Taitokerau, Ngati Maniapoto and Aotea. History Te Tokanganui-a-noho originally stood at Motakotako, Aotea Harbour, and was built and carved by Te Whanake for the Ngati Te Wehi tribe. Te Wehi is the founding ancestor of the NgƒÅti Te Wehi iwi. Achieving this by securing back a sacred dog skin war cloak or Kahu Kuri (dog-skin korowai were the most prestigious of Maori cloaks) also a war club or pounamu mere, items that no other local chief could obtain but by the mana(prestige) of his father Pakaue, who got killed for them anyway by the son of the local Kawhia Chief who was jealous as he was refused the High Chiefly and sacred items. Te Wehi or Te Wehi Te Kihi parents are father Pakaue & mother Koata of NgƒÅti Koata, Pakaue is of NgƒÅti T≈´- irirangi/NgƒÅti Wairere. There are a few versions to the whakapapa of who were the parents of Pakaue according to NgƒÅti Te Wehi KƒÅumatua and K≈´ia during the Waitangi hearings held at NgƒÅruawƒÅhia in 1908-09 both Kauki Tauira of Ngaati Te Wehi and Te Kamanomano of Ngati Reko state the whakapapa of Pakaue and reference to Tuhorotini a son of Tuirirangi and Koura Tuwhea of NgƒÅti Wairere to be Pakaue's parents. Te Wehi's mum Koata according to Tainui is of the NgƒÅti Mahanga, NgƒÅti Mahuta & NgƒÅti Mango people. According to research Te Wehi is said to have been a very swift runner and a fierce warrior, so too his older half brother Kawharu the Giant was 9 ft tall , both living prosperous but then separate lives after a small brotherly scuffle at Kawhia, in which Kawharu went to live with his father Ngaere and his people the NgƒÅti Tamainupo at Wai-keria. Te Wehi Te Kihi was born in Kawhia at a pah site known as Karere-atua and spent his young adolescence in Kawhia, after their little scuffle older brother Kawharu left Kawhia but eventually came back after helping in battles against Te Arawa with NgƒÅti Raukawa chief Ngatokowaru. Te Wehi moved to the Aotea Harbour after Pakaue his father was murdered for items only he could obtain, a very famous Dogskin Korowai cloak named Pƒ´pƒ´tewai & equally famous sacred war club named Karioi-mutu was given to Pakaue by an inland chief named Te Rau who lived over the ranges in the Waipa Valley. Te Rau had completed this very beautiful kahu kuri (dogskin) cloak and was coveted by many local Chiefs. Pakaue's cousin T≈´ahu-mƒÅhina a son of T≈´- irirangi & chief of that tribe, lived at Motu-ngaio pa not far from Karere- atua, His failed attempt to obtain these coveted items & remarks from the great Maniapoto chief Te Kanawa ‚ÄúO T≈´ahu-mƒÅhina, your prestige has been lowered by your younger relative Pakaue, because he has been able to obtain that which has been denied to you.‚Äù The thought of this made T≈´ahu-mƒÅhina very angry. Te Kanawa went on to Kawhia to see Pakaue and his warrior sons and started an argument with Kawharu, which incensed Te Kanawa enough to complain to T≈´ahu-mƒÅhina who attacked with the NgƒÅti Ariari, Pakaue & his family escaping but Pakaue taking a different route was found by Tautini-moko son of Tuahu-mƒÅhina and killed elderly Pakaue for the cloak & sacred war patu. Now Toa-Rangatira(NgƒÅti Mango) is an uncle to Te Wehi as he married Pakaue's sister Mananaki. Half brother Kawharu married Toa-Rangatira's daughter Waikauri, the tupuna of Te Rauparaha. Giant Kawharu not satisfied with his one revenge upon T≈´ahu-mƒÅhina's warriors, decided to enlist the help of his father-in-law Toarangatira, whose first joint battle with Kawharu beat Te Kanawa after he attacked them, but ToaRangatira let Te Kanawa go, to spread their fame as great warriors, the pair with their tribes then won a battle against T≈´ahu-mƒÅhina at Te Maika, the latter running to the safety of his Motu-ngaio Pa but then surrounded was ambushed & killed by Toa-Rangatira as he then tried to escaped Motu-ngaio, the names of the battles fought have been handed down to us. They were Te Moana-waipu, Pohoetangehe, and Te Keukeukeua. After these battles about 1675, Kawharu & Toa-Rangatira from Marokopa had Kawhia district in their undisputed possession. Older brother Kawharu now satisfied with the revenge he had obtained, desired to make peace with the survivors. Te Wehi would not agree, & Kawharu, not wishing to be further involved, collected his people & moved to the shores of Aotea harbour & occupied Raorao-kauere & Manuaiti Pa, while Te Wehi went to live at Matakowhai and the NgƒÅti Toa-Rangatira retained Motu Ngaio Pa until the 1820s before migrating south with Te Rauparaha & NgƒÅti Koata. News of the death of T≈´ahu- mƒÅhina spread & reached the ears of Tautini-moko, who had fled to Whanganui, and hearing that peace had been made, he returned with the sacred Patu & dogskin Korowai cloak & occupied the pa Te Rau-o-te-huia, not far distant from Raorao-kauere. When Tautini-moko returned, Te Wehi was living at Te Maari Aotea Harbour, & when the news reached him that his father's slayer was across the harbour, he decided to kill him. When he announced his intentions however, he received no support, it being contended that peace had been made; but Te Wehi was not to be cheated of his revenge, & set out to Waikato to obtain assistant from that tribe. According to ancestor's, NgƒÅti Te Wehi became an iwi after he had regained his father's Mana and made connections to his granduncles Wharetiipeti and Tapaue of Ngaati Mahuta. Mahuta begat Uerata who married Puakirangi, Koata's Auntie. Uerata & Puakirangi had Rangihoto, Wharetiipeti, Hourua & Tapaue. After the support from Wharetiipeti & Tapaue to attack Te Rau-o-te-huia pa, Te Wehi, a very fast runner, chased down his father's assailant off the Aotea harbour peninsula killing him and sercuring Karioi Mutu & Pƒ´pƒ´ Te Wai. Te Wehi gave the Scared Patu & Korowai to the NgƒÅti Mahuta Chiefs as they had their hand out for them, he also gave his daughter Reko to marry Tapaue's son Tahau. The then named Tokoreko & her husband Tahau became the Great Grand Parents of Whakaawi, mother of King Tawhiao. Decades later the korowai cloak & Mere were secured in a round-a-bout way by the rightful owners and placed in Ruakuri, one of three famous caves at Waitomo, but when this cave became known to Europeans they were both removed by Te Moerua Natanahira and placed in a vault at Te Kotahitanga, Otorohanga.http://ruht.co.nz/documents/publications/archive/Ruakuri_cave_wahi_tapu.pdf Ngati Whatua had heard of Kawharu's bravery and strength in battle, and in 1680, asked him north to Kaipara to help fight Te Kawerau. He led a series of raids ‚Äî known as Te Raupatu Tihore, \\"The Stripping Conquest\\" ‚Äî across the Tamaki isthmus, before being killed at a pa at Waiherunga in South Kaipara. Te Wehi had many small pa sites located around Aotea but his most beautiful was at the peak tops of Matakowhai. Upon his death, his people, known as \\"NgƒÅti Te Wehi\\", moved South West of Aotea Harbour, some stayed at Makomako, Te Papatapu and Motakotako. Te Wehi has been known to have had 3 wives, but his principle wife was Mariu who bore Te Hauwhangairua, Te Paipai, Tokoreko, Paiaka, Te Whakamaui, Hineketu and Te Rangitauwawaro. Each of these Children lived at Mowhiti (PƒÅkoka), Te Papatapu, Te Maari, Makomako, Te Urewera, Waiteika, Kaiariki, Paataka, Patumarama, Ruakotare, Wairoa, Maungaroa and so too did their descendants. Later most of the descendants headed to Waitetuna district as part of the conquested lands claimed by Te Wehi with the overthrow of the giant tyrant Toa-angiangi, these lands that the fastest runner in Aotearoa claimed were from Pukekohe to Otorohanga and the West Coast, so these Children of Te Wehi and Mariu are of importance as they are founders of many iwi and hapu today. This brings us to Rangitaupopoki the son of Waenganui II who is the son of Paiaka & Rangihora, Rangihora being the daughter of the giant Ngaati Koura warloard Hotumauea & Paiaka being the son of the great Te Wehi & his princess wife Mariu, daughter of Hape & Te Angaangawaero who is the daughter of the great chief Wahiao of Te Arawa descendant of Tuhourangi-NgƒÅti Wahiao, Tuhourangi was 9 ft tall. Rangitaupopoki married two NgƒÅti Maniapoto descendants named Parehikitanga & Waimahanga who were sisters. Parehikitanga & husband had three children, Te Urumahue a daughter, T≈´temahurangi & Te Moke. T≈´temahurangi begat three known sons, and he married Metiria Waikato a Daughter to Te Riria Whareherehere, one of his sons was Pita Waikato later known as Pita Mahu Waikato of NgƒÅti Te Wehi. Pita Mahu married Tirimata Karuwhero a Chieftess who occupied Maukutea before her marriage to him. Tirimata was given the Chieftess title after the death of her father Mohi Karuwhero a great grandchild of Tahuariki and Tokoreko. One of Pita and Tirimata sons was Te Mahara Pita Mahu who was very active in claimant for Ngati Te Wehi. The other known sons of T≈´temahurangi were Matiu and Te Aot≈´roa a.k.a. H≈çne Waitere, sons born to Marutehiakina II. Matiu was taken as hostage in 1822, in which after Nga Puhi took him back to Whangarei and he was raised my a Chief there as his own son. Te Wehi's great grandson Rangitaupopoki of Ngati Paiaka/Ngapuhi and his NgƒÅti Maniapoto princess had 2 warrior sons, Te Moke and a Tutemahurangi, whose sons Pita Mahu Waikato and Te Aot≈´roa H≈çne Waitere who were in their 20s at the time, would have helped their dad and uncle Te Moke with the battles against Te Rauparaha as he killed Te Uira and a battle to fight for a NgƒÅti Te Wehi chief Te AomƒÅrama at Makomako, Aotea harbour. Soon after with the NgƒÅti Mahanga & NgƒÅti Maniapoto Te Moke rounded up 5000 with P≈çtatau Te Wherowhero of NgƒÅti Mahuta plus the NgƒÅti Hourua and together the NgƒÅti Koata(Aotea) and NgƒÅti Toa of Kawhia harbour were cleared out and everlasting peace ensued and all the tangata whenua(people of the land) worked their lands and sold their produce to Auckland pakeha until 1863 when the government wanted the fertile Waikato Basin for themselves so the battles against the British army started. After the 1821 warfare NgƒÅti Mahanga/NgƒÅti Te Wehi chief Te Aoturoa Hone Waitere and his NgƒÅti Mahanga/Koura princess Pirihiri moved to Te Waihi on the Aotea peninsular when in 1822 his younger brother was taken by Nga Puhi. H≈çne Waitere is then remembered living at Te Pahi where their children were born in the late 1830s and 1842, they all lived in peace at their dads residences and his burial place Te Pahi, Aotea Harbour. Te Aot≈´roa took the name Te Aot≈´roa H≈çne Waitere when the Wesleyan Mission was set up in area mid 1830s by John Whiteley. John convinced Te Aoturoa in 1840 to sign the Treaty of Waitangi but could not convince Te Wherowhero. Te Aot≈´roa H≈çne Waitere sold land at Te Kopua in the Waipa for the Wesleyan's to teach their people to read and grow new food from countries afar. Shortly after singing the Treaty of Waitangi he got his uncle Te Moke to sell land at Raoraokaurere to the Wesleyan's so they had their own mission station and using old planting grounds at Raoraokauere were growing wheat and barley so NgƒÅti Te Wehi had the first water powered water mills in the area. Te Aot≈´roa H≈çne Waitere was a NgƒÅti Te Wehi/NgƒÅti Mahanga chief who signed the Manukau-Kawhia copy of the Treaty of Waitangi 15 June 1840. This Manukau-Kawhia Maori-language copy of the Treaty of Waitangi, with 13 signatures, & is the only surviving copy with the signature of Colonial Secretary Willoughby Shortland. It was also the last copy to be returned, in 1841. Shortland sent it to Captain William Symonds on 13 March 1840 to gather signatures from chiefs around and to the south of the Manukau Harbour. Symonds was working in the area on behalf of a proposed Scottish land company settlement. He and James Hamlin of the Church Missionary Society assembled several chiefs, probably at Awhitu, but failed to get their agreement. Many Waikato chiefs, including Te Wherowhero, attended a second meeting on 20 March. Three NgƒÅti Whatua chiefs signed then (Kawau, Tinana and Reweti) but none of the Waikato chiefs. Wesleyan missionaries James Wallis and John Whiteley(Hone Waitere to Kawhia Maori) gathered 10 more signatures at Kawhia between April and September 1840. Each name has the prefix 'Ko', which is not part of the name and has 'his mark' following the moko or mark. Signed Treaty on 15 June 1840, witnessed by John Whiteley. Born in Aotea Harbor approx.1799 Te Aot≈´roa(a.k.a. H≈çne Waitere) before signing the Treaty of Waitangi was also signatory to 35 acres of land sold at ¬£4 for the Wesleyan mission at Te Kopua on 5 May 1840, & Sold 10,000 aces with other chiefs to the crown on 2nd Dec 1857 called Te Wharauroa Block, ¬£410 was paid by John Rogan on behalf of Queen Victoria over 4 years. The last of land transactions with the crown before the Waikato Wars until 1911 when 17,000 acres of Moerangi Block was sold to the government. =Aotea Wesleyan Mission School and farm= Wesleyan Mission- Premises at Kawhia By 1840 here were now 3 Wesleyan Missions in the area, Waiharakeke the site of the first Wesleyan Mission Station established by John Whiteley in April 1835.(Te Waitere) Kawhia, Raglan 1839 and now Te Kopua 1840 but not one with the NgƒÅti Te Wehi at Aotea Harbor. So at around the time of signing the Treaty Kawhia H≈çne Waitere Te Aot≈´roa Rangatira of NgƒÅti Te Wehi, Hapu NgƒÅti Paiaka of Aotea Harbor lovingly persuaded Rev. John Bumby the Superintendent of the Wesleyan Church to set up a mission in Aotea Harbour, site of the landing of the Aotea Canoe and of an ancient Pa. On the northern side 844 acres were gifted to the Wesleyanshttp://www.methodist.org.nz/files/docs/waikato%20waiariki/kawhia%20pilgrimage.pdf for a boys‚Äô school and mission station & the non-maori speaking Rev H.Hansen.Turton was re-appointed to that area.http://www.aoteaharbour.co.nz/wesleyan_mission_2.html Mission buildings and church at Raorao, about 1850 Plaque on the site of Raoraokauere mission station In 1843 Rev. Gideon Smales was appointed to replace Rev Turton. Smales raised funding for the mission station, travelling extensively to do so & 95% of contributions were from maori. On 29 January 1844 Gideon Smales landed at Raoraokauere on the northern side of the Aotea Harbour and proceeded to build his mission ‚Äì which he called BEECHAMDALE. So a farm & school had been established growing wheat \\"In 1844, they reaped throughout the Circuit not more than twenty acres of wheat...in 1845, about eighty...in 1846, one hundred and fifty...and this year they will reap about two hundred acres of wheat besides a small patch of oats, and another of barley. A good portion of their wheat has been sold to traders for calico, and print, and sent to Auckland, and other Anglo-New Zealand towns by small vessels. They have used what they retained for their own consumption, in some cases, by simply boiling the wheat; in others, as kororirori, or boiled flour and water; (with sugar, when it could be obtained) and very often in the form of bread. The school opened in 1898 and appears to have closed by July 1904, due to sickness of its teachers, though a replacement was appointed in April that year. =Water flour mill= To grind their wheat, the labour and expense of hand-mills was found to be too heavy; and during last year, we managed to erect an excellent little water flour-mill. This is the first thing of.the kind that has been erected for the natives of New Zealand; and I am glad to learn that other three parties are now arranging to follow this praiseworthy example of our people. The expense of the labour of the mill-wright alone was eighty pounds, which amount they paid with an ox and pigs; a large sum for so poor a people. Many of them have had to shiver out the whole winter in their tattered blankets, in consequence of this, to them, extraordinary effort. But the result is interesting.. It is extremely gratifying to see two or three old veterans in barbarous life sitting for hours near the water-wheel; its brisk, rattling noise seems to impart a new life into their warrior hardened souls. And as if just awakened from the long sleep of barbarism, the sudden turn of civilization appears to impart a vivacity, and cheerfulness to which they have hitherto, been strangers. They chat with a new interest and vigor around the machinery, whilst the water dashes and foams beneath their feet. Enumerable are the advantages resulting from the progress of Christianity here, as in other parts. I am not aware that there has been a single case either of infanticide or murder, as the consequence of witchcraft, in the circuit, since the beginning of 1844.\\"http://www.aoteaharbour.co.nz/wesleyan_mission_4.html Te Aot≈´roa took the name Hone Waitere in honor of John Whitley (or Hone Waitere to Kawhia Maori) as they were friends but also around New Zealand other Wesleyan Maori were naming themselves or their sons after John Whiteley(Hone Waitere) Te Aot≈´roa H≈çne Waitere married Pirihira (NgƒÅti Te Wehi/Koura) and raised their daughter Meri and 2 sons Te Moke II and Ngatokorua Hone Waitere (b.1842) at Aotea Harbor. Ngatokorua Hone Waitere & Wife Hingaia Mahara (Ngati Horokatere) left Aotea Harbor during the 1863/64 Land Grab Wars and rode on horses to Thames therefore not fighting with the pakeha and retaining their mana whenua on return and built a whare at Kaitenaki then later at Te Maari. Large tracts of confiscated land owned by other NgƒÅti Te Wehi descendants are still to be addressed with the crown as the Great Te Wehi coveted more land with the killing of Toa-angiangi and added it to his huge holding. Ngatokorua Hone Waitere is shown in this picture taken Feb 1934 at 92 years old with his son Wiri Toko Waitere & grandsons (waka carver)Tutemahurangi(Ned) & Hone Joe Waitere.

Despite its subtitle (\\"Gothic - romantic - industrial - electro\\") and its web tagline (\\"Das Magazin fur Dark Rock-Electro-Gothic Rock-Dark Metal & More\\"), it includes all popular music genres including metal, medieval rock, Neue Deutsche H√§rte, alternative rock, electro and futurepop. The gothic rock, dark wave and industrial music genres have had only a minor presence since the late 1990s.  History  The magazine was established in 1995 by Claus M√ºller and was released for free in A5 format. The focus was initially on new wave, gothic rock, electro, and industrial music. With the third edition in May 1996, the magazine was published for a fee and in A4 format. Since 1997, the focus has shifted increasingly to heavy metal. However, other genres such as Goa trance, intelligent dance music, ambient, drum and bass, and techno, are represented in the magazine. Each month has a goth-related cover, often featuring a semi-nude female model. It is generally considered one of the top three music magazines in Germany, along with Zillo and Sonic Seducer. Orkus is the official sponsor of the Amphi Festival and releases DVDs of the event in their issues at the end of the year. Content In addition to interviews, concert reports, short portraits, and reviews, particularly from death metal, dark metal, and black metal, there are articles unrelated to music, such as illustrated reports on cemeteries and a series on mysticism in everyday life. There are also columns by musicians (Oswald Henke, Alexander Kaschte) and pages with poems from readers. Each issue comes with a CD with new tracks and remixes from the bands featured in the magazine. Its compilation CD Orkus Collection 2 made it to #1 on the 2002 Deutsche Alternative Charts.

A ceasefire (accorded to be in effect from 6 September 1991) had been agreed between the parts on July.El Frente Polisario denuncia un ataque de la aviaci√≥n marroqu√≠ ABC, 5 August 1991 During August and the first days of September 1991, the Royal Moroccan Army (RMA) conducted offensive operations in the areas of Mehaires, Tifariti, Bir Lahlou, Mijek and Agwanit, resulting in multiple Sahrawi civilian casualties, the destruction of Tifariti and Bir Lahlou, poisoning of the wells and subsequently depopulation of the area. Operation Rattle Between 4‚Äì5 August, Moroccan troops and aviation attacked the towns of Tifariti, Mehaires and Mijek, destroying infrastructure that had been built for the nomad population of the area and the outcome of the referendum, and while a United Nations military experts mission was in the zone. POLISARIO sources stated that they had no military casualties, and on 13 August declared that one Sahrawi had been killed and another wounded during the attacks on Tifariti and Miyek. Sahrawi sources from Tindouf mentioned that three civilians were wounded during the attacks. On 4 August, a Moroccan Northrop F-5 was shot down by Sahrawi fighters near Tifariti, and his pilot Captain Youssef Megzari captured (he escaped from Tindouf prison in February 2005 along with another POW).https://www.yabiladi.com/article- politique-310.html While the POLISARIO saw the attacks as a Moroccan attempt to sabotage the peace plan, the Moroccan official news agency defined the attacks as a \\"cleansing operation in no-man's land\\" to avoid the \\"infiltration of elements armed and trained to make terrorist attacks on the Moroccan Sahara\\"Western Sahara war 1975‚Äì1991. List of Royal Moroccan Air Force losses during operations against Sahrawi rebel national liberation movements (POLISARIO). From 22 August, a second wave of attacks by the Moroccan forces took part on Tifariti, Bir Lehlou, Mijek and Agwanit. While Polisario Front sources defined the attacks as a \\"massive terrestrial offensive\\" and denounced the \\"systematic destruction of the water wells\\", MAP stated that since early August there had been \\"political operations of cleaning and searching in the no man's land\\", but denying that there were on a \\"greater scale\\". On 25 August, POLISARIO officials announced that Moroccan forces had reached the town of Bir Lehlou, the temporary capital of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, making hundreds of Sahrawi civilians flee into the desert. These sources stated that the Sahrawi forces were not opposing resistance to the Moroccan offensive, due to \\"respect to the date of September 6 marked by the UN peace plan for the ceasefire\\", but also adverted that if after the ceasefire date the attacks continued, \\"Sahrawis will be legitimated to exercise their self-defense right\\". Finally, they affirmed that at least twenty Sahrawi nomad civilians had died, most of them of thirst, during the Moroccan offensive. On 27 August, then UN Secretary General Javier P√©rez de Cuellar expressed his confidence on the maintenance of the ceasefire date, while dismissing POLISARIO reports about the attacks. Moroccan press attacked P√©rez de Cuellar, accusing him of not being neutral and creating confusion. Meanwhile, the Royal Moroccan Air Force bombed Tifariti again, killing at least five civilians, wounding 20 and destroying the infrastructure of the town, according to Hash Ahmed, then POLISARIO representative in Madrid, who added that ten thousand refugees on the Tifariti region were fleeing, and a hundred had disappeared. On 29 August Bachir Mustapha Sayed, POLISARIO representative for relations with the MINURSO, declared that the Moroccan troops were retreating into the Moroccan Wall. Cease fire A cease-fire between the Polisario Front and Morocco, monitored by MINURSO (UN) has been in effect since 6 September 1991, with the promise of a referendum on independence the following year.

The species is endemic to Australia. Description Plants grow to between 0.5 and 1 metre high with a similar spread. The small, grey green, obovate (or narrow obovate) leaves are lighter coloured beneath and have an acute tip. The single pea flowers have orange-yellow keels, yellow wings and a yellow standard that may have red markings. These are produced between August and October in the species' native range and are followed in November by ellipsoid fruits that are around 5.5 mm long and 4 mm wide. Taxonomic history Eutaxia diffusa was named by Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1858, when his original description was published in the first volume of his Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. The specific epithet derives from the Latin word diffusa, meaning spreading widely or loosely. It is thought to be a reference to either its spreading habit or relatively uncrowded leaves. The species was reclassified as a subspecies of Eutaxia microphylla in 1957 before Mueller's original name was reinstated in 2010. Distribution Eutaxia diffusa has a range that extends from Inglewood in Queensland southwards through New South Wales, where it is recorded in mallee communities, and in to south-western Victoria and westward across to South Australia. Associated tree species include Eucalyptus behriana, Acacia trineura and Melaleuca lanceolata. Ecology Caterpillars of the Fringed Blue butterfly feed on this species.

It was published by Jean d‚ÄôHalluin's √âditions du Scorpion in 1947 with a second edition (revised by the author) at √âditions de Minuit in 1956 which had a drawing by Mose on the cover. It was reissued in 1963 and reprinted a number of times. The French critic Bruno Maill√© has described it as a surrealist novel, something the surrealists themselves refuted, however Alistair Rolls in his study of intertextuality in four novels of Boris Vian argues the novel contains many surrealist elements and techniques. The Peking (or Beijing) of the title is not literal; if anywhere the location of the novel's main action is a ‚Äúdream-desert‚Äù allowing Vian to play with visual extremes of searing light and heat as well as intense blackness and night. It takes place in an imaginary desert called Exopotamie where a train station and a railway line are under construction. Pestereaux argued that Peking was simply slang for Paris; an allegory of Paris post WW2 reconstruction and the insanity of its beureaucracy. Autumn in Peking was written in 1946, a prolific year for Vian, in which he wrote three novels, L‚Äôecume des jours (Froth on the Daydream), J'irai cracher sur vos tombes (I Spit on Your Graves) and L'Automne √† P√©kin (Autumn in Peking) J. K. L. Scott describes this novel as a narrative of disillusion set in the adult world, rooted in the absurdities of industrial society, and a story of hopeless love (much like Vian's preceding novel L‚Äôecume des jours). Scott says it is connected with L‚Äôecume des jours and indeed it shares some characters with that novel. It was the only one of Vian's serious novels to be republished in his lifetime. Its second publication by J√©rome Lindon's √âditions de Minuit was on the recommendation of Alain Robbe-Grillet. \\"L'Automne √† P√©kin could well become one of the classics of a literature which, after having exhausted with a uniformly accelerated movement all the nuances of the sinister, from Romanticism to Naturalism and from Socialism to Mysticism, notes all of a sudden that it winds up in the desert of Exopotamie; a literature where one is finally permitted to laugh!\\" - Alain Robbe-Grillet. The novel's leading characters are Anne and Angel (both men) who are best friends. Angel, the central figure of the Autumn in Beijing, is also the husband and father of Clementine's children in L'Arrache-c≈ìur. Rochelle is in love with and sleeps with Anne, while Angel is madly in love with her, a love sadly unreciprocated. James Sallis in his review in the Boston Globe describes a novel about an \\"expedition to build a railway in the desert of Exopotamie, populated with engineers, randy priests and hermits, lovelorn couples, and a physician obsessed with model airplanes, as well as by buses that feed on catfish bones, typewriters that shiver when uncovered, and bedclothes that climb affectionately back into place when thrown back, even a chair that falls ill and must be hospitalized.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 6, 2012. In this episode, Meg travels to Paris with her friend Ruth after being treated badly in school, but her exciting adventure comes to a halt when she gets kidnapped. Brian and Stewie embark on an action-packed mission to find her before it is too late. This plot is a parody of the film Taken. This episode was written by Brian Scully and directed by John Holmquist. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and cultural references. It was viewed by 5.64 million U.S. viewers in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode's guest stars were Omid Abtahi, Bill English, Ralph Garman, Mark Hentemann, Jerry Lambert, Rachael MacFarlane, Natasha Melnick, Kim Parks, Julius Sharpe, Danny Smith, Alec Sulkin, Fred Tatasciore, John Viener, and Lisa Wilhoit. Plot After being assaulted with dodgeballs by Connie D'Amico and other girls during gym class, Meg talks to her friend Ruth about how much she hates being at school and wonders if she can tolerate the rest of the semester. She then learns that Ruth is going to spend a semester in Paris and is invited to join her in the program. Using the money she has saved from part-time jobs, Meg is able to enroll in the program. The family sees her leave as she enters the airport. Once she and Ruth land in Paris, they meet a man who offers to share a cab with them as they go to their apartment. When the two of them arrive at the apartment, a group of men arrive and kidnap Ruth while Meg is talking to Peter on the phone. When she tells Peter what she witnessed, he tells her to hide under the bed. She complies, but the men find and take her anyway. After Peter talks to the kidnappers, offering them a pittance to save Meg, one of them tells him \\"Drakkar Noir\\" before hanging up. After that, Peter calls \\"Lois, Meg's dead!\\" The Griffins call the FBI to hopefully get Meg back, but the FBI say that a person must be missing for 96 hours before they could take action (they add that after 96 hours it's almost certain Meg will be lost forever). Concerned by the idiocy of the family and the government, Brian and Stewie get to Paris themselves to take matters into their own hands and save Meg. They find out where the men took Meg, who is about to be sold as a sex slave. At the auction, Stewie dresses up as a slave and Brian dresses as an Arab to get in, and Stewie is sold to Brian (for $500,000). However, Brian cannot afford to pay for Stewie, and the guard uncovers their disguises. They are chained to a pipe downstairs, but Brian breaks free and overpowers the guard. They then follow Meg and her captors to a yacht traveling down the River Seine. On board, Meg is delivered to an Arab emir waiting in the master stateroom. After Meg refuses to be his sex slave, the emir reveals he bought her not to be a sex slave but to be his son's wife. The king introduces his teenage son, the young prince of the kingdom, who calls Meg a \\"goddess\\" and asks her to marry him or if she declines he will have her flown back to America on their private jet. Meg agrees to marry him, but Stewie then kills the prince, unsure of his real intentions, uses a neuralizer on Meg, knocking her out, and takes her to a French hospital for treatment before taking her home safely. Back at home, the family is happy to see Meg, who admits remembering nothing between the proposal and being in a French hospital. Lois tells Meg that they found Ruth with her tongue ripped out. Peter states that he has saved Meg's mail then reveals that to be a joke as Meg had not received any mail. Ralph Garman guest starred in this episode as Meg's gym teacher.

The MENA region covers roughly 11.1 million square km. There are three major deserts in the MENA region: * The Sahara Desert, comprising large sections of Libya and Egypt. * Rub' al Khali, in the southern Arabian Peninsula. * Baidat El-Sham, in the northern Arabian Peninsula. Additionally, much of Iran is covered in desert. Average annual rainfall is less than 100 mm in 65% of the region, between 100 and 300 mm in 15% of the region, and more than 300mm in the remaining region. The conditions that create conflict only expected to get worse and more complicated, as the full impacts of climate change on the Middle East and North Africa develop over the course of the 21st century. Jordan River Basin =Water resources= Satellite map of the Middle East. The three headwaters of the Jordan River ‚Äì the Hasbani River (annual stable flow of 250 Mm3), the Banias River (annual stable flow of 125 Mm3), and the Dan River (annual stable flow of 250 Mm3) originate in Lebanon, Syria, and Israel, respectively. They merge in Lake Huleh and then flow south as the Jordan River. Just south of Tiberias, the Yarmuk River joins the Jordan River. In total, the Jordan River flows for roughly 350 km, starting in the foothills of Mount Hermon in the north and ending in the Dead Sea to the south. The River has an estimated flow of 1880 MCM/Y, 73 percent of which originates in Arab countries and 27 percent of which originates in Israel. According to a September 2000 USAF study, over 90% of Syria‚Äôs water is shared with neighboring Iraq, Turkey, Israel, Lebanon, and Jordan. Approximately 36 percent of Jordan‚Äôs water sources are shared with Syria, the West Bank, and Israel, and more than half of Israel‚Äôs waters is shared with Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the West Bank. Further north, the Litani River and Orontes River comprise the northern Levant watershed. Although their headwaters are geographically close, the Litani flows south then west to the Mediterranean near Tyre, crossing through Lebanon alone, while the Orontes flows north into Syria, entering the Mediterranean around the city of Antioch. The Litani's estimated annual flow of 410 MCM/Y has been the target of proposed Syrian, Jordanian, and Israeli water solutions. Syria, Lebanon, and Israel all have indigenous underground fresh water aquifers. There are two main underground aquifers that provide fresh water to modern day Israel. The Mountain Aquifer is underneath the West Bank. It recharges 679 Mm3 of water annually, of which 78 Mm3 are brackish. The Mountain Aquifer‚Äôs three main basins are the Eastern Basin, the Western Basin, and the Northeastern Basin. The Eastern Basin is the smallest in terms of fresh water quantities, but largest in terms of area. It covers roughly 3260 km^2. The Western Basin is the largest of the three in terms of fresh water content. It covers roughly 1780 km2. Finally, the Northeastern Basin has an area of roughly 610 km2. The Coastal Aquifer located along the Mediterranean Coast has a total annual recharge of 330 Mm3. The area around the Jordan River Basin is one of the driest in the world. Israel and northwestern Jordan receive an average of 110 cm of rainfall per year. Little of this water can be exploited. Only Kuwait, Libya, Oman, and Singapore receive less rain annually than Jordan or Israel. Syria and Lebanon, in contrast, receive enough rainfall to support agriculture and recharge underground aquifers. As stated earlier, while northern parts of Jordan and Israel receive 110 cm of annual rainfall, central Jordan and the West Bank receive 20 mcm/y. Only 3 mcm/y of this water is usable, however. =Water consumption= Israel uses roughly 850 MCM/Y of groundwater, 400 MCM/Y of which come from the Mountain Aquifer. In 1964, Israel began to withdraw 320 MCM/Y from the Jordan River for the National Water Carrier. By 1967, Israel‚Äôs National Water Carrier was extracting almost 70 percent of the Jordan River before it reached the Palestinians in the West Bank. In the 1980s, Israeli settlers consumed seven times more water than Arab farmers. Other sources show a smaller, yet still sizeable difference. Per a September 2000 study, Israel uses 1180 MCM/Y, or 62 percent of its total annual water supply on agriculture. In comparison, Jordan uses 67 MCM/Y, or 74 percent of its total water supply on agriculture. Roughly 48 percent of Israel‚Äôs average annual water usage of 1,950 MCM/Y comes from territory captured in 1967. 400 MCM/Y of this comes from ground water in the West Bank, while 450 MCM/Y comes from the upper Jordan River and the Golan Heights. As early as 1981, however, Israel was exploiting 99 percent of its available water resources. =Water Supply Systems= British Mandate Period (1917‚Äì1948) At the time of the British Mandate of Palestine (1913‚Äì148), three irrigation systems existed along the eastern slopes of the Judaean Mountains. The Wadi Qelt aqueduct provided 3 MCM/Y of fresh water to Jericho from the Ein Fara, Ein Fawar, and Ein Qelt springs. Additionally, the Wadi Uja aqueduct supplied the Uja Valley with 7 MCM/Y of fresh water from the Ein Uja spring and the Wadi Faria aqueduct transported 5 MCM/Y of water from the Ein Shibli, Ein Isca, and Ein Baidan springs to the Giftlik. Under Roman rule, the Nablus and Jerusalem aqueducts were also active in the Judea and Samaria Mountains. These aqueducts brought a combined additional 3 MCM/Y to Sabastia and Jerusalem. During the Mandate, another 200 small groundwater springs were used and rainwater was collected from cisterns, yielding an additional 5 MCM/Y of fresh water during rainy years. With the addition of two electric power plants supplying an addition 2 MCM/Y to Jerusalem and Ramallah, the maximum water capacity in the Judea and Samaria Mountains was 25 MCM/Y. Lake Tiberias Several plans attempted to allocate the water resources of the region during the British Mandate. The Ionides Plan of 1939 made three recommendations. First, it proposed to store the floodwaters of the Yarmouk River in Lake Tiberias (Sea of Galilea). Second, it set and amount of the water in the lake to be diverted through the East Ghor Canal and used for irrigation east of the Jordan River. Third, it limited the use of Jordan River Basin water to the Jordan River Valley. This was rejected by Zionist advocates who envisioned using waters from the Jordan River Basin to settle the Negev Desert in the south of the country. In contrast, the Lowdermilk Plan, commissioned by the United States Department of Agriculture, proposed irrigating the Jordan River Valley and diverting the Jordan and Yarmouk Rivers for hydroelectric power. In 1948, James B. Hays used the findings in Lowdermilk as a basis for the Hays Plan in which the Yarmouk River was to be diverted into Lake Tiberias to compensate for the waters lost in the diversion of the Jordan River for agricultural purposes. Jordanian Rule (1948‚Äì1967) In 1948 Israel officially became a state. The Kingdom of Jordan assumed control of the water resources of the Judea and Samaria Mountains. They retained control over the region until the Six-Day War in 1967. Additional wells drilled during this period and the maximum water supply in the region reached 66 MCM/Y. Only four of 708 Palestinian towns, however, were connected to the water supply at the time. In 1965 an additional 350 wells were drilled, supplying a total of 41 MCM/Y. In the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war ( the Jewish Army destroyed the Rutenburg electric plant in trying to prevent the exclusive Arab control of both the Jordan and Yarmouk Rivers. As a direct result the Jordanian Government and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency commission the MacDonald Plan, which resembled the Ionides Plan (1939) in limiting the waters of the Jordan River Basin to the Jordan River Valley. It also called for a diversion of the Yarmouk River for storage in Lake Tiberias to be used to support agricultural developments on both sides of the Jordan River. Jordan and Syria backed the Bunger Plan, which proposed a dam of the Yarmouk River and the creation of two hydroelectric power plants to supply electricity to Jordan and Syria. In 1953, shortly after construction had started, increased pressure from the U.S. forced Jordan and Syria to abandon their plans. The Eisenhower Administration sent Eric Johnston as a special envoy. The Johnston Plan implemented the policies of a Tennessee Valley Authority study conducted by Chales Main ‚Äì the Main Plan ‚Äì that included water distribution quotas of the Jordan River Basin. Although neither side accepted the plan, it has been used as the basis for many subsequent water conflict negotiations. Israeli Administration (1967‚Äìpresent) When Israel occupied the West Bank in the Six-Day-War 1967, the water resources of the region were declared as state property. The occupation has huge impacts on the daily lives of the Palestinian people and their water supply: In many aspects the occupation implicates breaches of international law, such as the international human rights law or the international humanitarian law. Especially the land confiscations and property demolitions by the Israeli military as well as the restrictions on the movement of people and goods are criticized. Since 1967, most water sources are controlled by the Israeli military. Moreover, water resources are diverted and the Palestinian population is denied access to most water resources. In the same time, Israel claims that the Palestinians drill unauthorized wells. Large parts of the Palestinian water infrastructure, including cisterns, wells, and irrigation systems, are declared as illegal and systematically demolished. As the development of new Palestinian water infrastructures is mostly prohibited, the Palestinian water supply systems are in a very poor condition. In that way, they are reflecting the weak and ambiguous political status of Palestine. As most people in the West Bank depend on agriculture, the Palestinian water deficit is also weakening the local economy. Thereby it is strongly contributing to poverty and unemployment. The unbalanced water allocation in the Palestinian territories shaped the term of \\"water apartheid\\". Even though it is difficult to get accurate data, the average Israeli water consumption in the West Bank is about 6 times higher than the average Palestinian water consumption of approximately 50 liters/person/day, what is about the half of the World Health Organization minimum recommended level. However, there are other data showing a different picture. By excluding treated sewage and desalinated water and using a different type of demographic data, Gvirtzman (2012) for instance argues that the average Israeli and the average Palestinian water consumption is nowadays almost the same. The huge differences in the Israeli and Palestinian water data illustrate how contested and urgent the question of water allocation still is. Until today, there is no final agreement granting water rights to the Palestinian population. Although water questions were a topic in the Oslo Peace Process, the water dispute was not solved through the negotiations. Indeed, Article 40 of the \\"Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip\\" (1995) deals with the Palestinian water rights, but it states that \\"these will be negotiated in the permanent status negotiations and settled in the Permanent Status Agreement relating to the various water resources\\". In the meantime, \\"during the interim period a total quantity of 28.6 mcm/year\\" will be allocated to the Palestinian population \\"in order to meet the immediate needs [..] in fresh water for domestic use\\". In reality, due to the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian tensions, a Permanent Status Agreement was never negotiated. Therefore, the agreement indirectly maintained Israeli domination over water resources and handled the issue of water deficit in the occupied Palestinian territories as a matter of humanitarian need rather than a right. Moreover, the Israeli-Palestinian Joint Water Commission (JWC) was established to implement the agreement in a collaborative way. The Hydrological, Engineering, Sewage, and Pricing Committees of the JWC meet on a regular basis to approve the construction of water supply systems or sewage installations. As a part of that agreement, Israel transferred the control of the water supply in the Palestinian territories to the Palestinian Authority. Nevertheless, the Palestinian Authority is hardly able to fulfill its responsibilities, as Israeli members of the Joint Water Commission are able to veto any Palestinian project. Furthermore, the members of the Palestinian Authority are unable to access most areas as they are denied access by the military. The result is, that more than 33% of the water supplied to the Palestinian territories \\"leaks from internal pipelines\\". Both sides contest that the laws established in Oslo are no longer being followed. As the Palestinian population is not allocated enough water, the work of the Joint Water Commission can be considered as insufficient. Nile River Basin =Water resources= Nile River in Egypt The Nile River is an international water basin, running through 10 different sovereign nations. The Nile runs through Sudan, South Sudan, Burundi, Rwanda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Egypt and is considered to be the longest river in the world. The Nile is the only significant source of water in North Africa and 40% of Africa‚Äôs population lives in the Nile River Basin. The Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile is the longer of the two, rising in the Great Lakes Region of central Africa. Its most distant source is unknown, located in either Burundi or Rwanda. From there, it flows through Tanzania, Lake Victoria, Uganda, and South Sudan. The Blue Nile originates from Ethiopia‚Äôs Lake Tana, flowing into Sudan from the southeast. In total, Ethiopian headwaters provides 86% of Nile River waters. The two major tributaries meet near the Sudanese capital of Khartoum and flow north through Egypt and into the Mediterranean Sea. =Sudanese Civil War= Access to key resources, mainly water, is a primary source of the Civil War in Sudan. Ecologically, Sudan is divided into a northern and southern region. The North is densely populated with Arab Muslims. Although the Nile flows through the northern part of Sudan, it is largely beyond the drainage basins of the feeder streams and rivers that consolidate themselves into the White and Blue Niles further to the south. The South is lightly populated, but much more fertile. It receives adequate rainfall and benefits from many feeder streams and springs scattered throughout the area. Persistent drought and desertification, population expansion, and the need to increase food output have forced many northern Arabs to look south for lands and resources. The introduction by the North of mechanized farming equipment continues to threaten southern subsistence farming. Organized as the Sudan People‚Äôs Liberation Army (SPLA), southerners have fought back against northern intrusion for the better part of three decades. Water conflict in Sudan typically concerns canal building or farming projects. One of the more notable sources of conflict has been the Jonglei Canal project, begun in 1978. The project was started for two primary reasons: to drain the Sudd Swamps to create additional farmland and to conserve the water being evaporated as it sat idle in the swamps. The amount lost through evaporation was estimated at 4000 mcm/y. Both the Sudanese and Egyptian governments supported the project as both would share in the benefits of additional water. The Jonglei Canal is massive enough to be seen from space. It averages 210 feet in width and 16 feet in depth. Drainage of the wetlands threatened the roughly 1.7 million local tribesmen that depended on the swamps for survival and in November 1974, locals rioted in the southern city of Juba. Southerners began to flock to the SPLA, which led violent attacks on construction sites along the Jonglei Canal. They eventually forced the suspension of the project in 1984. 250 of 360 km of canal had been built. The incursion of northern mechanized farming in southern Sudan has also caused conflict. The Arab-dominated government envisioned agricultural development in the South and northern farmers continually encroached upon the fertile southern plains. Such encroachment threatened the Nilotic tribes, who ran the cattle economies of the south. Southerners responded to northern incursion with hostility and violence. Conflict again broke out between the northern government and the Sudanese people concerning the government‚Äôs decision to build the Kajbar Dam on the Nile. The resulting reservoir would have forced the relocation of the last remaining Nubian tribes in the Sudan. Much of the Nubian homeland had already been flooded after the Aswan High Dam was built by Egypt in the 1950s. Many Sudanese protested the building of the Kajbar, with members of the Nubain Alliance even threatening mass suicide in protest. They have declined offers of compensation from the Sudanese government. =Regional conflicts= Aside from a source of internal conflict within nations, water has caused external tension between sovereign states. While Egypt consumes 99% of the Nile‚Äôs water supply, little water originates within Egypt‚Äôs sovereign borders. High water demands of a lower riparian have often fueled regional conflict. Such is the case in North Africa. Northeast Africa, the Red Sea, the Arabian Peninsula and the Sinai Peninsula In the early 1900s, a world cotton shortage put pressure on Egypt and Sudan to use arable lands to increase cotton production. Cotton, however, requires extensive irrigation and is less suitable to Egyptian and Sudanese climate than are other more traditional crops. The need for water and flood control precipitated water development projects along the Nile, which often led to clashes between the British foreign office ‚Äì Sudan was a British-Egyptian condominium at the time ‚Äì and local Egyptians and Sudans. After World War I it became apparent that a formal allocations treaty would need to be signed to regulate water usage of the Nile. In 1920, the Nile Projects Commission was formed. Led by representatives from India, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the commission estimated water usage based on the water usage needs of each country. Based on an average flow rate of 84 bcm/y the commission estimated necessary Egyptian consumption to be 58 bcm/y, while Sudan was believed to be able to meet its irrigation needs using only the waters of the Blue Nile. The commission also proposed dividing any deviations from the annual average water flow equally between Egypt and Sudan. The findings of the commission, however, were never acted upon. Also in 1920, the British proposed the Century Storage Scheme, the most comprehensive plan for water development along the Nile. The plan called for a water storage facility to be built on the Uganda-Sudan border, a dam to be built at Sennar, Sudan, to irrigate the regions south of Sudan, and a dam along the White Nile to hold summer floodwaters for Egyptian dry-season consumption. The British scheme worried many Egyptians, as most of the major water structures were to be built outside of Egyptian territory. On May 7, 1929, Egypt and Sudan signed the Nile Waters Agreement. Based largely on findings from the 1920 commission, the treaty allocated 4 bcm/y to Sudan, and 48 bcm/y to Egypt. In between January 20 and July 15, however, the entire flow of the Nile was allocated for Egyptian consumption. In the 1950s, Egypt unilaterally pursued construction of the Aswan High Dam until 1954, when the Sudanese was brought in on the negotiations. The first round of negotiations between Egypt and Sudan took place in December 1954, but was called off before a consensus could be reached. The two governments met again in April 1955, again failing to reach a compromise. Tensions mounted in 1958 after a failed Egyptian expedition into disputed territory along the Sudanese border. In response, Sudan raised the Sennar Dam in the summer of 1959, effectively repudiating the 1929 agreement signed with Egypt. The two countries signed the Agreement for the Full Utilization of the Nile Waters (Nile Waters Treaty) on November 8, 1959. The Nile Waters Treaty, based on an average annual water flow of 84 bcm/y provided the following: * 55.5 bcm/y to Egypt, 18.5 bcm/y to Sudan. * Any derivations from the average annual water flow were to be divided equally between Egypt and Sudan. * Until 1977, Sudan would \\"loan\\" Egypt an additional 1.5 bcm/y. * Any future developments that led to an increase in Nile water flow would be paid for equally between the two nations. Any resulting water was also to be split evenly between them. * Egypt would repay Sudan 15 million British Pounds in compensation for past flooding that resulted from Egyptian water development projects. Additionally, the 1959 treaty established a Permanent Joint Technical Committee to resolve any future conflicts. Both Sudan and Egypt agreed that the water needs of the other eight riparians would not exceed 1 to 2 bcm/y and further agreed to meet any threat to Nile resources with a unified Egyptian-Sudanese response. The building of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s was contentious as it flooded areas of southern Sudan near Wadi Halfa and displaced Sudanese residents living along the Egyptian-Sudanese border. The Merowe Dam, as seen from space. In the mid 1990s Egypt began a massive project just south of the Aswan. The New Delta Project in southern Egypt and the Salaam Canal in the Sinai Peninsula were both initiatives undertaken by former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak to increase water supply for the expanding Egyptian population, which has dispersed further and further from the Nile. Increasing Egyptian water consumption is a source of conflict in the region as upstream riparians ‚Äì Sudan and Ethiopia ‚Äì have begun to assert their own rights to dam the river for hydroelectric development. Sudanese plans to build the Kajbar Dam near Khartoum at the confluence of the White and Blue Niles has caused much international tension. Sudan is also planning on building the Merowe Dam south of the Kajbar and enlarging the Roseires Dam, located 300 miles southeast of Khartoum on the Blue Nile. It is estimated that the building of these projects would likely lead to Sudan exceeding its water allotments from the 1959 treaty. Ethiopia has also emerged as a major player in Nile River development. In 1957 they announced their intentions to pursue unilaterally the development of Nile River headwaters within Ethiopian territory. By the year 2000, more than 200 small dams had been constructed along Nile headwaters. Collectively, the dams will use nearly 500 million mcm/y of the Nile‚Äôs annual flow. Ethiopia is the only Nile River riparian to make a legal claim to Nile waters other than Egypt or Sudan since the Nile Waters Treaty was signed in 1959. Like in Egypt, population growth in Ethiopia has led to an increase in water consumption. Ethiopian population growth exceeds that of Egypt, and with populations of roughly equal size, Ethiopia‚Äôs water demands may soon exceed Egypt‚Äôs. Irrigating only half of Ethiopia‚Äôs arable lands would reduce water flow to downstream Sudan and Egypt by 15%. Tigris-Euphrates River Basin =Water resources= The Euphrates River in Syria.The Tigris-Euphrates River Basin consists of its two primary rivers ‚Äì The Tigris River and the Euphrates River ‚Äì and their minor tributaries. Both the Tigris and the Euphrates originate in southeastern Turkey. The Tigris flows from Turkey, tracing the border between Turkey and Syria for 32 km before flowing south through Iraq. From its origin in Turkey, the Euphrates flows into Syria from the north, before continuing on through Iraq. The two rivers meet in Iraq to form the Shatt Al-Arab, which flows south into the Persian Gulf. =Regional conflict= Although hydropolitical tensions in the region have existed for centuries, population pressures in the 1960s led each country to pursue unilateral development of water resources. The Keban Dam was built in southern Anatolia from 1965 to 1973 and Syria built its Tabqa Dam between 1965 and 1973. Despite bilateral and sometimes tripartite (including the Soviet Union) negotiations, no formal agreements were in place when the two dams became operational in 1973. As the dams began to fill, downstream water flow decreased significantly. In 1974, Syria granted an Iraqi request and allowed an additional 200 mcm/year to flow from the Tabqa Dam. The following year, however, Iraq asked for Arab League intervention, citing that the flow of water reaching Iraq had fallen from the normal 920 m¬≥/s to an \\"intolerable\\" 197 m¬≥/s. The Syrian government responded by claiming that water flow into Syria had been reduced by more than 50%. The Atat√ºrk Dam along the Euphrates River After trading mutually hostile statements, Syria withdrew from an Arab League committee tasked with resolving the dispute. Tension increased in May 1975 as Syria closed its airspace to Iraqi flights and both countries amassed troops on their borders. Saudi Arabian intervention, however, defused the situation with both sides arriving at an agreement that averted the impending violence. The terms of the agreement were never made public, but Iraqi sources have privately said that Syria was permitted to keep 40% of the water in the Euphrates flowing through its country, while 60% of the water was to be allowed to flow south through Iraq. The Southeastern Anatolia Project (Turkish acronym: GAP) continues to be a source of tension in the region. GAP is a massive hydroelectric project, consisting of 21 dams and 19 hydroelectric facilities. The water will be used to generate 26 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity with an installed capacity of 7,500 megawatts and irrigate 1.65 million hectares of land. In 1987, Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal reportedly signed an agreement guaranteeing a minimum flow of 500 mcm/y into Syria. Talks between Turkey, Syria, and Iraq were held again in January 1990 when Turkey shut off the flow of the Euphrates for 30 days by closing the gates of the Atat√ºrk Dam. Iraq insisted that Turkey allow a minimum of 500 mcm/y to pass into Syria, but negotiations were suspended due to the outbreak of the first Gulf War. Negotiations after the war in September 1992 failed to reach an agreement. In 2020, Iraqi authorities complained that the Ilƒ±su Dam had decreased the Tigris river inflows and caused water shortages in Iraqi plains. In addition, Kurdish farmers in northern Iraq warned of a \\"catastrophe\\", after Iran deliberately cut off the flow of water from Sirwan and Lower Zab to Dukan and Darbandikhan dams. However, Syrian villagers also accused Turkey of cutting water access which decreased the Euphrates' water levels to 200 m¬≥/s, which is 300 m¬≥/s less than the already agreed amount between the two countries. Moreover, Turkish-backed Syrian rebels blocked the supply of water from Alok pumping station near Ras al-Ain which caused shortages in drinking water in Al-Hasakah Governorate. Blue Peace The conflict regarding water in the Middle East could flare up in the coming days due to disputes over availability, use and management of water. The intense competition for water could even lead to regional war. That is why, cooperation is necessary to prevent conflicts and wars. The Blue Peace method, which seeks to transforms trans-boundary water issues into instruments for cooperation, has proven to be effective in places like the Middle East and the Nile basin. This unique approach to turn tensions around water into opportunities for socio-economic development was developed by Strategic Foresight Group in partnership with the Governments of Switzerland and Sweden. A recent report \\"Water Cooperation for a Secure World\\" published by Strategic Foresight Group shows that active water cooperation between countries reduces the risk of war. This conclusion is reached after examining trans-boundary water relations in over 200 shared river basins in 148 countries. Countries in the Middle East face the risk of war as they have avoided regional cooperation for too long. The report provides examples of successful cooperation, which can be used by countries in the Middle East.
