Biography Benita's father was a farmer from the village of Annenieki in Dobele Municipality, where the family owned a farm called \\"Tƒìrces\\". Benita was raised on this farm with her older brother and sister. Her mother was a school teacher from Jelgava. On 25 March 1949 Benita Plezere and her family were deported to the village of Odesskoye, in the Omsk Region of the USSR, as they were classified as a Kulak family for owning more than of land before the Second World War. The family lived in Siberia for seven years before they were finally given permission to leave in October 1956. The family returned to Latvia in 1956 where they found their farm had been destroyed; all the wood from the house had been removed and used as firewood, leaving only the foundations, and all the farmland had been made part of the local kolkhoz.Ar bƒìrna acƒ´m, Latvijas 50 gadu okupƒÅcijas muzeja fonds, Rƒ´ga, 1996 Drawings Benita Plezere is known for the drawings she made whilst living as a deportee in Siberia, which she then sent to her godmother back home in Latvia. The drawings depict her family's arrest, the journey to Siberia and their everyday lives in Omsk. Once the family returned, in 1956, Benita's mother hid the drawings as she was afraid of what could happen if they were found by the Soviet authorities. However, in 1989, the pictures were taken out from their hiding place when the family thought it was safer because Latvia was in breaking away from the Soviet Union. Once the independence of Latvia was restored the drawings were donated to the Museum of the Occupation of Latvia and in 1996 a selection of the drawings were published in the book \\"Through the Eyes of a Child\\". In 2016 a temporary exhibition of the same name was also displayed in the museum, and a short sand cinema film was made based on the life of Benita Plezere.

They were joined by Guneet Kaur a few months later and by Devesh Agnihotri in 2016. In mid-2015 Guneet Kaur, Parijata Bharadwaj and Rupesh Kumar left the group.. In mid-2016 Devesh Agnihotri left the group. Nikita Agarwal and Priyanka Shukla joined the group towards the end of 2016. Shalini Gera moved out in September 2017. Priyanka Shukla left the group in August, 2018. The group is presently hosting Shikha Pandey, a David Leebron Human Rights Fellow for a year.  Work  The group began by filing requests for information under the Right to Information Act. They found that jails in Bastar District were severely overcrowded, that most inmates were awaiting trial ('under-trials' rather than convicts), and that when these cases finally reached the courts many ended in acquittals. Since then, JagLAG have focused primarily on providing legal aid to villagers who they believe have been falsely accused in Naxalism-related cases. The group's most high-profile case is that of Soni Sori, who has been charged, along with her nephew Linga Ram Kodopi, with extortion and unlawful activities for allegedly accepting money from the multinational corporation Essar, in return from protecting the company‚Äôs operations in the state from the Maoist groups.  Disbarment and eviction  On 6 October 2015, the Bastar Bar Association passed a resolution prohibiting any lawyer who is not registered with the local Bar Council from practising in the Jagdalpur courts. The resolution prevented JagLAG lawyers Shalini Gera and Isha Khandelwal, both registered with the Delhi State Bar Council, from representing clients in Jagdalpur. Under Section 30 of the Advocates Act of India, a local bar association has no authority to prevent a lawyer from practicing in any court in the country. Gera and Khandelwal have responded by transferring their registration from the Delhi State Bar Council to the State Bar Council of Chattisgargh. In February 2016, the Bastar District Bar Association passed a resolution that any local lawyer who co-signed a memo of appearance with JagLAG would have to sever ties within ten days or be debarred. In the same month, JagLAG's landlord was called to the City Kotwali Police station and pressured to evict his tenants. Gera and Khandelwal were forced to relocate to Bhilaspur.

Singapore's oldest reservoir Macritchie Reservoir was named after him in 1922. Early life and career in Scotland and Calcutta MacRitchie was born in Southampton on 26 September 1847, the son of the P&O; superintendent engineer. Educated in the Dollar Academy, formerly the Dollar Institution, Scotland and at the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, MacRitchie worked as a civil engineer on bridges and docks in Scotland, including the Albert Bridge, Glasgow where he gained experience on the use of concrete foundations encased in iron caissons. MacRitchie went to Calcutta in 1867 to work as an assistant engineer on the Calcutta water project, possibly the Palta Water Works which was built between 1865 and 1868 and is reported to be 'the first modern waterworks in Asia'. Since renamed the Indira Gandhi Water Treatment Works, it had a capacity of 6 million gallons per day in 1865 but has since been expanded significantly. MacRitchie married Miss Cameron, daughter of the editor of The Straits Times, in 1883. Work on Japanese lighthouses Upon completion of the Calcutta water project, MacRitchie spent seven years working for the Japan government as Lighthouse Engineer. According to his obituary, published in Singapore, he was responsible for designing and building lighthouses around the coast of Japan and is said to have been the last foreigner to have held this position. MacRitchie worked as an assistant to Richard Henry Brunton the so-called 'father of Japanese lighthouses'. See also 'Building Japan 1868-1876' by Richard Henry Brunton. After Japan, he moved to Brazil where he worked on water works, gas works and tramways before arriving in Singapore in 1883. Singapore Municipal Engineer MacRitchie took over as Municipal Engineer from Thomas Cargill in 1883. His report to the Municipal Commission in 1884 demonstrates the wide range of duties he had to undertake in Singapore as well as his diligence. During his career he was responsible for numerous works and immense improvements in the streets, bridges, public markets, abattoirs and other infrastructure in Singapore. MacRitiche was the architect for the new cast-iron octagonal-shaped Lau Pa Sat market (now a national monument) which was relocated to its present position in 1894. MacRitchie followed the original style of George Drumgoole Coleman's 1838 market. Lau Pa Sat from above His first major Singapore project was the iron Coleman Street Bridge which replaced a rickety wooden bridge; over the 12 years of his career as Municipal Engineer he caused 'innumerable' bridges in Singapore to be replaced with iron bridges he designed. His design of small iron bridges first used in Singapore was soon being used throughout Malaya. MacRitchie applied himself to the problem of night soil and studied various alternatives for Singapore including a pneumatic system and conversion to 'poudrette'. The Municipal Commission sent him on a 3-month fact finding trip to India in 1893 to inspect sanitation, night soil and water supply systems and to bring best practices back to Singapore. The report he prepared had 'all the data and, in many cases, the worked out detail for dealing with the sewage and refuse of Singapore' and was described as 'a valuable contribution to municipal engineering in the East'. Water supply was a priority for MacRitchie. He replaced water mains and introduced a water filtration plant after which the water supply was said to be second to none in the region. He drew on best practice from England and experimented with a new 'Polarite' filtration material for Singapore. His experience was called upon in Penang where he was asked to advise the Municipal Commission on a new reservoir in 1890 It may have been on one of these visits that he worked on the design of the reservoir of the Penang Botanic Gardens waterfall completed in 1892. He is best remembered for the Thomson Road or the Impounding Reservoir which is known today as the MacRitchie Reservoir. Construction proved a challenge and was delayed when the works were flooded four times during the 1891-94 construction period. When completed, the 'magnificent waterworks', one and a half miles in length and five and a half miles in circumference, provided the city with 650 million gallons of storage. MacRitchie calculated that this gave Singapore 130 days storage and supply based on daily consumption of 3.2 million gallons of water per day in 1895. MacRitchie noted that the demand for water had more than doubled from 1.4 million gallons per day in 1885 which explains the enormous value and importance of the Impounding Reservoir. Plaque of MacRitchie Reservoir The historic timeline of the MacRitchie Reservoir Park is shown in the footnote Three Reservoirs in Singapore are named after influential Municipal Engineers: James MacRitchie, Robert Peirce (engineer) and David J. Murnane. Electrification of Singapore in 1892 MacRitchie became embroiled in a public debate about the use of electricity for public lighting in Singapore with the Colonial Engineer, Major Henry McCallum, who was in favour of electric light. MacRitchie held that 'the extra light [from the electric lamps] was uncalled for' and the Municipality could not afford the cost of electric light. One commentator at the time was concerned that Singapore might fall behind other 'Eastern Towns', including Rangoon, which had introduced electricity. Although MacRitchie was an expert in water works, he had less experience with electricity. Many of the assumptions in his 1892 report on the use of electric light, as an alternative to gas, were subject to extensively-reported criticism by the electrical engineer O. V. Thomas. However, Thomas had an obvious commercial interest as he was a tenderer to supply the power plant, lights and overhead cables. Another commentator defended MacRitchie as 'a competent civil engineer, an excellent judge of costs and estimates and [knowledgeable about] the difficulties of labour in the East' Death and successor Bronze memorial panel of James MacRitchie MacRitchie died 26 April 1895, aged 47, at his home 'Woodside', Grange Road, Singapore. The esteem in which MacRitchie was held, and the shock of his untimely death, resulted in a memorial panel being commissioned in 1896 to be installed in the Town Hall (part of the modern day Victoria Concert Hall). It measured some 8 feet by 9 feet and had a bronze image of Macritchie in the middle with four of his major works in each corner: the Bukit Timah Filters and the Impounding Reservoir representing the waterworks achievements and the Read Bridge and Kim Seng Bridge representing his bridge building The selection of his replacement was done by a vote of the Municipal Commission: Mr Tomlinson, who was the municipal engineer in Bombay, received 7 votes whereas the acting Municipal Engineer in Singapore, and MacRitchie's loyal assistant, Mr Howard Newton, received 2 votes.

Career Commander William Goate commissioned Derwent in June 1807 for the Channel. Commander Frederick Parker replaced Goate in November. Parker sailed for the west coast of Africa on 17 November in company with the fifth-rate frigate and , the transport , the colonial schooner George, and some merchant vessels, all bound for Sierra Leone. Commodore Edward Columbine, the governor of Sierra Leone, raised his pennant in Solebay. The warships were the first ships in the West Africa Squadron that the British government had established to interdict the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade. When the vessels arrived at Gor√©e, Columbine and Major Charles William Maxwell, the commander of the British garrison there, decided to make an attack on Senegal to prevent French privateers from continuing to use it as a base. Major Maxwell and some 160 men of the Royal African Corps embarked on Agincourt. Then she, Solebay, Derwent, Tigress, and some other vessels sailed on 4 July and arrived off the bar across the river on 10 July. As the expedition landed its troops across the surf, Captain Parker of Derwent, one of his midshipmen, and six seamen drowned. The troops, together with 120 seamen and 50 marines moved up the river. The French force of 160 regulars and 240 militia retreated and on 13 July Saint Louis surrendered. The French prisoners of war were repatriated to France under parole. On 11 July Solebay grounded trying to come up the river. All her crew and most of her stores were saved. Captain Columbine appointed his First Lieutenant, Joseph Swabey Tetley, to the command of Derwent in Parker's place. 22 Aug 1809 Derwent arrived at Spithead on 22 August, carrying Solebays captain and crew. Four days later Derwent came into Portsmouth. On 31 August Tetley received promotion to the rank of Commander and was confirmed in command of Derwent. Between January and October 1810 Derwent underwent fitting at Portsmouth. Commander George Sutton assumed command in May 1810. On 30 July 1811 Derwent captured the French privateer Rafleur. Rafleur, of Granville, carried 20 men armed with small arms.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 26, p.168. Freundshaft, Bull. master, arrived at Ramsgate on 18 November, having lost her fore mast.

He wrote that after the riots each Canadian camp had anti-riot squads, of which he was in one, while in Aldershot \\"where two roads cross there were sixteen policemen, four on each corner they worked in groups of four but by then they moved a few thousand of the worst ones out things were kind of quiet.\\" Aftermath Cleaning up Union Street in Aldershot after the riot A Cabinet meeting held on 6 July discussed the riots of the previous two days, with Prime Minister Winston Churchill demanding to know \\"Why could we not keep better order? Had we no British troops to call in to restore order? Where was our military police? Were we going to let these wild Canadians break up the homes of these poor innocent shopkeepers?\\" Churchill's military adviser Field Marshal Lord Alanbrooke replied that it would have been \\"only as a very last resort that I should order British troops to rough handle Canadians who are giving trouble... In such cases Canadians must deal with their own nationals. Even British Red Cap police must be kept out of it.\\"Field Marshal Lord Alan brooke, War Diaries 1939-1945 University of California Press (2001) - Google Books pg 703 One hundred Canadian soldiers were tried by courts-martial, and five received sentences ranging from two years with hard labour to seven years penal servitude.Anthony Stokes, Pit of Shame: The Real Ballad of Reading Gaol, Waterside Press (2007) - Google Books pg 142 By 31 March 1946 the Canadian government had paid $41,541 to meet the costs of repairing the damage in Aldershot. Lieutenant-General John Percival \\"Price\\" Montague (1882-1966) of the Canadian Army Overseas believed that the riot's ringleaders were men who had volunteered for the Pacific Force in the expectation of being repatriated quickly calling these men \\"...I cannot describe otherwise than as racketeers\\".

It was written by John Cameron who had written Outpost (1959) which had screened on American television. It was shot in Melbourne and set in Africa and concerns local politics. Plot In a new African republic, Zambotu, a United Nations force holds the elected president and vice president in protective custody under the responsibility of an Australian officer Frank Andrews, who is leading a United Nations Command. The officer romances Dr Pearson, makes friends with some people experienced with Africa (Kurt Ludescher and Mary Ward), and meets President Ngimba (Keith Eden). Ngimba is English educated and was voted into power by a large majority. The colonists favor the vice president, Kurobe. Ngimba and Kurobe are held in protective custody following clashes between supporters of both. Andrews hears arguments from his friends, Peter and Mary Vender, experienced in Africa. He also hears from Peter Vender ia mining tycoon opposed to local independence who is a supporter of Kurobe. A doctor, Pearson, makes Andrews realise that the people support Zambotu. The UN releases Kurobe but Andrews has to keep Nigmba in custody. Andrews grows more sympathetic to Ngimba. Ngimba's supporters march on the presidental palace to release him and Frank Andrews considers ordering his troops to open fire. He decides to lay down his arms and the locals take charge. The weapons are used to kill some women.

The others were: *Boy Round the Corner *The House of Mancello *Funnel Web *The Hobby Horse *Jenny The play was John Cameron's follow up to his successful Outpost. It was based on the experience of Dr Ivan Smith, an Australian who worked as Chief United Nations representative during the Congo Crisis in November 1961. He had been attacked by mobs and had to be rescued. Cameron said, \\"the play attempts to explore the problem in human terms rather than the stark black and white of an ideological or racial clash. It examines the tragedy of people caught up in this conflict, each conscious of his own rights, each resentful of the claimed conflicting rights of others.\\" Cameron said \\"the play is essentially about people forced into an environment of crisis rather than the stark blac and white issue of a racial clash. I looked for the sort of tough military situation in which a certain decision cold result in a court martial, but with circumstances that could win sympathy for the officer. The Congo was very much in the news at the time I wrote the play. So The Teeth of the Wind is set \\"somewhere in Africa\\" and deals with conflicting interests between two cultures.\\" Reception The Bulletin gave the play a harsh review saying \\"the net result was neither drama nor documentary.

Players take the role of a man who wakes up from a drunken one-night stand beside a stranger and must piece together the events of the previous night. It was based on a free game Kinmoku wrote for a game jam at itch.io. One Night Stand was released for PC in 2016, and Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2019.  Gameplay  Players take the role of a man who has just woken up beside a woman in her apartment. Despite not remembering the events of the previous night, the player learns their character has had sex with the woman. When the woman leaves the room, the player has the opportunity to look around, then question the woman about the various objects found. Based on the player's actions and dialogue choices, they can unlock many different endings, ranging from being angrily kicked out to the possibility of friendship. In the most recent update, there is an ending of her playing the guitar and becoming more than friends with the character.  Development  One Night Stand is independent video game developer Lucy Blundell's first game. It is based on a free game that Blundell designed with a friend for a game jam at itch.io. The inspiration came from a young man she saw on public transportation. While trying to guess at reasons for his miserable-looking state, she found the idea that he was recovering from a drunken one-night stand interesting. The game is rotoscoped based on footage that Blundell shot of herself via a cell phone. One Night Stand was developed using the free Ren'Py visual novel software, and Blundell credited its community with supporting her. The free version of One Night Stand was released on March 24, 2016. The commercial version was released on October 20 on itch.io and November 7 on Steam. Blundell credited the free version as making the Steam greenlight process easier. The free version also acted as a demo, which she said helped to dispel players' fears that the game would be outside their demographic, though she said the free version's popularity eclipsed that of the commercial version. Ports for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were released in October 2019 by Ratalaika Games.  Reception  Emad Ahmed of the New Statesman wrote that One Night Stand takes a more realistic approach than similar games. Comparing it to other games that feature physical relationships, Ahmed cited it as an example of using dialogue to tell a story rather than as a gameplay mechanic used to reach a desired conclusion. Kill Screen wrote that the initial mystery ‚Äì what happened the previous night ‚Äì becomes less interesting than learning about the woman and trying to find a happy ending. At Hardcore Gamer, Derrick Bettis wrote, \\"One Night Stand feels more like a think piece than a proper game\\", as it does not introduce any unique insights but allows gamers to discuss their views on the topic. Johnny Chiodini of Eurogamer wrote that the game captures the feelings of awkwardness and vulnerability following a one- night stand well.

Bac. at Adelaide University. Fred was chairman of directors of Advertiser Newspapers Limited and a close personal friend of Keith Murdoch and editor Lloyd Dumas. Sidney was one of only two of their offspring to survive to adulthood; his talented sister Alleyne was to become the dearly loved wife of Henry Rymill.Alick Downer, The Downers of South Australia Wakefield Press, Adelaide (2012) Downer's parents were in London from 1915 to 1919, during which time he attended Berkhamstead Grammar School, then returned to the family home \\"Glenalta\\" in Stirling West, South Australia. He followed his father and grandfather as a student at St Peter's College, expecting to follow his father into Law. He managed well enough academically, but excelled at games, particularly cricket, serving for several years as captain of the school's first eleven. In October 1928 he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he failed his first year's examinations, and was recalled to Adelaide by his father. It was then he decided on a career in journalism, and in 1930 began working at the Melbourne Herald. It was there he met Melbe Roark (c. 1906‚Äì ), whom he married in 1932 and were to have two children together. He returned to Adelaide in 1933 to work at The Advertiser. In 1934 he was the recipient of a notorious newspaper story when stage personality Patricia Hackett took out her displeasure at a \\"mixed review\\" by slinging the contents of a bottle of ink over him. With the outbreak of World War II Downer was posted to the Australian Associated Press office in London. In 1940 Sidney enlisted in England with the Royal Air Force, and was posted as a publicity officer with the rank of Flight Lieutenant in 1941 to Singapore. He escaped with others to Malaya following the fall of Singapore but was captured in Java and interned in Formosa (now Taiwan), followed by Manchuria. He was repatriated to England at war's end, then returned to Adelaide late in 1946, where he resumed working with The Advertiser as a sports writer, but his marriage to Melbe was over, to be replaced by the widow Margaret Dutton, daughter of Victor Marra Newland of Adelaide's prominent Newland family. Marital happiness was not to last however, and a few years later they separated, and Sidney took up with Dorothy \\"Doss\\" Anderson, n√©e Clampett, whom he married in 1964. He died in hospital, where he had been admitted suffering from pneumonia, a few days after his sixtieth birthday.

Her research also indicated that in the late eighteenth century, the gravamen of these lawsuits shifted from claims of economic loss to claims of psychological or emotional harm, though she also rejected the characterization of breach of promise lawsuits as purely contractual disputes.

Debuting in 2010 with the black-and- white graphic novel Set to Sea, Weing went on to create the webcomic The Creepy Case Files of Margo Maloo. Together with his wife Eleanor Davis, Weing has taught cartooning classes at the University of Georgia. Weing is large fan of the serialized aspect of webcomics. Career Drew Weing debuted in 2010 with the black-and-white graphic novel Set to Sea. The book, containing very little dialogue, features Popeye-like character designs combined with highly detailed backgrounds. Set to Sea presents one large panel on each of the graphic novel's 140 pages. The story of Set to Sea parodies Boys' Own tales such as Treasure Island and Captains Courageous, as it \\"[follows] the transition from innocence to experience for an aspiring poet kidnapped and forced into sailor life.\\" Set to Sea was intended only as a small and experimental side project, with Weing initially drawing a single panel every day. However, as the single panels started to take him multiple days to complete, Weing realized that the comic had turned into a worthwhile story. Since 2009, Weing and his wife Eleanor Davis have been teaching cartooning at the University of Georgia as part of its \\"Summer Academy\\" program. Their students, 11- to 17-year-old children, were taught various aspects of comics, though Weing noted that the best things for them to do was to \\"basically to keep out of the kids‚Äô way and let them have fun,\\" in order to keep the children from getting self-conscious. In August 2015, Weing co-published a comic book with his wife titled Flop to the Top!. Published through Toon Books, the book is intended for first- and second-grade children and features a \\"silly and amiable fable of viral fame.\\" Since February 2014, Drew Weing has been running the webcomic The Creepy Case Files of Margo Maloo, about a boy named Charles Thompson who moves to a monster-ridden apartment building. The title character Margo Maloo is a \\"monster mediator\\" who helps sort out the situation. A print version of Margo Maloo was published by First Second in September 2016. The webcomic started out as a collaboration between Weing and his wife as they were trying to come up with a pitch for a one-page serial comic for Nickelodeon Magazine. The character Margo was created by passing a sketchbook back and forth, \\"tweaking her design and adding details.\\" Though the serial never happened, Weing kept the idea in mind for years. Eventually, he realized the character need a sidekick: Weing described early designs for Charles as a \\"shrimpy, nervous little kid,\\" but the more assertive Charles formed shortly after. Though Weing has an ending for the story planned, he is planning to continue the story indefinitely as \\"there are an infinite amount of monster misunderstandings in Echo City\\" and he wants to chronicle as many of Margo's adventures as he can. The Los Angeles Times described the first book as \\"just the beginning of [the characters'] adventures.\\" On webcomics Weing created the infinite canvas webcomic Pup, which he initially made available solely on Serializer. In an interview with Paste Magazine, Weing stated that the entirety of his comics career has involved the World Wide Web in some form, with Set to Sea being serialized online before print publication as well. When asked by the Los Angeles Times what he thinks of the format, Weing stated that \\"there are many webcomics that are dear to my heart\\". In particular, Weing has frequently praised how serialized comics force a reader to read slowly: as someone reads a couple pages a week rather than binge reading the entire comic directly, their \\"life [gets wrapped] up with the characters.\\" He described this as \\"getting a little check-in from a friend every day\\" and considers this an entirely different experience from that which one gets with comic books and graphic novels. Personal life Drew Weing is married to cartoonist Eleanor Davis, who he has described as his \\"primary editor and audience, and vice versa.\\" Though the two keep separate work spaces - Davis working in the corner room in their house and Weing doing his work in the studio across the street - the two meet back up for dinner and discuss what progress they have made that day. Though Davis goes to bed early in the evening and wakes up early as well, Weing tends to stay up late doing computer work. Weing and Davis moved to Athens, Georgia \\"kind of on a whim\\", after having visited the town for its Fluke minicomic festival. In an interview, Weing stated that his \\"dream\\" is for the local comics scene to gradually overshadow the Athens music scene.

Abbotts said of him: \\"I couldn't believe the strength in him, even at that age.\\" As a teenager, Gordon drifted from judo into powerlifting, and came 2nd in the under-19 national powerlifting championships at age 15. Later life After retiring from competitive sport, Gordon was employed as the caretaker at Moseley Park School in Bilston, West Midlands, where he also provided judo coaching. In 2010, he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and died in May 2011. Following Gordon's death, students at his place of work chose to name the school's new gymnasium after him. Nick Elwiss, the head teacher, said: \\"He was held in extremely high regard by staff and pupils and is fondly remembered by us all.\\" See also * Judo in the United Kingdom References External links 1958 births 2011 deaths Black English sportspeople English male judoka Commonwealth Games gold medallists for England Commonwealth Games medallists in judo English sumo wrestlers Olympic judoka of Great Britain People from Hanover Parish Sportspeople from Wolverhampton Judoka at the 1984 Summer Olympics Judoka at the 1988 Summer Olympics Judoka at the 1992 Summer Olympics Jamaican emigrants to the United Kingdom English people of Jamaican descent Judoka at the 1990 Commonwealth Games ","title":"Elvis Gordon"},{"id":"52543560","text":"Pierre L√©na, born on 22 November 1937 in Paris, is a French astrophysicist.

It is notable for the fact that it essentially predicted the separation of Pakistan and Bangladesh and by coincidence its title contained the year in which the separation actually happened, almost 20 years later. The military cable was directed through the Naval Intelligence and Military Intelligence to ISI sent to its headquarter and came in the wake of reactionary of Basic Principles Committee's first report towards the writing of the first set of the Constitution of Pakistan. The cable was sent by then-Commodore S.M. Ahsan to DG ISI Major-General R. Cawthome on a file coincidentally numbered 1971. The cable discussed the implication of One Unit, religious fanaticism, and the economic parity between the West and East Pakistan that will ultimately result in the division of Pakistan into two different groups. The Cable's message read as: * The creation of Committee of Ulema to veto the decisions taken in the House of People on religious matters, gives excess of powers to Ulema over the rights of elected representatives of the people. This gives an impression of Pakistan as being a Theocratic State. * To recommend that the head of the state should be a Muslim will unnecessarily create suspicions in minds of the minorities in Pakistan. The choice to select the head of the state should be left entirely to the people, to select without prejudice to caste, colour and creed. * It is maintained by same officers that a single House elected on population basis should have been envisaged, and we should cease to think in terms of Bengalis and Punjabis etc. The parity between West & East Pakistan will ultimately result in the division of Pakistan into two different groups, therefore, it is the very negation of one people, one country and one culture. The cable's message was further extended and discussed at the Army GHQ by MI's officer Major KM Arif when he compiled an \\"Intelligence Report No. 7894 of the Office of Intelligence Research and Analysis\\" in December 1970. The cable is notable for its highlighted title and many historians found strange that the cable was coincidentally numbered: Cable/File 1971.

Chronicles of Stephen Foster's family Vol. 2 Stephen Collins Foster Memorial (University of Pittsburgh), Pittsburgh]: Published for the Foster Hall Collection by the University of Pittsburgh Press, 1944 She taught the piano and occasionally composed music. Early life Marion Foster Welch outside the Foster home museum with W.D. Armstrong, a visiting composer on the left and the pianist Mrs. A.D. Mitchell on the right.In 1914, the Pittsburgh City Council began their funding support of the museum and appointed Marion and Jessie Rose as caretakers Welch was born on April 18, 1851 in the home of her uncle William Barclay Foster Jr. Her parents, Stephen Collins Foster and Jane Foster, then moved with her to her paternal grandfather's home, and a few months later they moved back to her grandparent's home. In 1861, Jane and Welch moved to Lewistown, Pennsylvania where Welch began attending school. In 1864, she was joined by five cousins whose father had died in an accident, who subsequently moved in with her and her mother. Her grandmother also moved in at this time. Around 1870, Welch married Walter Welsh, with whom she had three children. Welch did not raise her first child, Jessie, who was raised to adulthood by her grandmother. Cultural contributions In 1879, Welch and her mother secured the copyright for \\"I Would Not Die in the Summertime.\\" When the copyright expired on \\"Old Folks at Home,\\" they renewed it for a fourteen year period. In 1893, she and her mother filed a suit alleging copyright violation of Stephen Foster's song, \\"Old Folks at Home\\". In 1895, Welch was living in Chicago. In 1900, she unveiled the Stephen Foster Memorial in Highland Park. In 1906, Welch unveiled a model of the statue then being built in Frankfort, in honour of Stephen Foster and his song \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\". In a ceremony in Louisville, Kentucky; a chorus of 1,000 children sang some of her father's works. In 1913, citizens in Pittsburgh initiated fundraising to preserve Stephen Foster's place of birth in the city as a memorial to him. The philanthropist James H. Park bought the property outright the following year and asked Welch and Jessie Rose to become the live-in caretakers of the house. The city of Pittsburgh assumed financial responsibility for the property, helping to upkeep and preserve it. Park gave the house at 3600 Penn Avenue, known as the Stephen S. Foster Memorial Home, to the city of Pittsburgh in July 1916. In 1926, Welch visited Canonsburg, where the community celebrated Foster's music and shared reminiscences about her father. In 1929, she was Canonsburg's guest of honor in a celebration of her father's work, where she played both her own music and her father's. She was described by the local paper as having a youthful outlook on life, despite being more than seventy- seven years old. After Josiah Lilly built the Stephen Foster Memorial in 1937, staff from the memorial spoke to Welch about her family's genealogy. Fletcher Hodges, Jr., who was the first curator of the Foster Hall Collection at the memorial, noted in 1948 that Marion Welch had \\"provided a link between her father and the present\\". In her later years she spent her time with her daughter and granddaughter. Music Welch taught music and piano. Fletcher Hodges noted that Foster Welch was \\"long known as a piano teacher\\" in Pittsburgh, and that \\"many Pittsburghers have received their first instruction in the art of music\\" from her. She occasionally composed music of her own. Welch and Frank S.

Some say that she was \\"not able to attain fame of a like order\\" when compared to her father. Legal disputes Welch twice attempted to force the US government to honor the contract that was established years before in court. The basis of the legal action was that the US military did not pay for their use of Foster property during the War of 1812.Emerson, Ken.

Accident At 05:37 local time (03:37 UTC) on 10 December 2016, a Bulmarket freight train travelling from Burgas to Ruse derailed in Hitrino, Shumen Province, Bulgaria. The company specialises in transport of fuels over rail and road. Two of the waggons, which were carrying propane-butane and propylene, struck a power line pole, exploded and caught fire, engulfing at least fifty buildings, one of which collapsed, trapping several children. The three train drivers (two in the lead and the third driver in the second electric locomotive) survived the accident. Seven people were killed and 29 injured. An evacuation of the village was ordered as 150 firefighters fought the blaze; it was extinguished by midday. The injured were taken to hospitals in Shumen and Varna; some of them had sustained burns to 90% of their bodies. It was reported that sparks had been seen coming from the locomotive of the train immediately before the accident, possibly indicative of heavy braking. Background The incident occurred on the oldest railway line in Bulgaria, connecting the country's main riverine port on the Danube in the city of Ruse and the main port on the Black Sea in Varna. The line was built during Ottoman rule by British private investors in the 1860s. The railway station in Hitrino was also the site of the first railway accident in Bulgaria in 1866. The train operator Bulmarket Rail Cargo was founded in 2004 and in the same year acquired a license for railway operations. It operates second-hand Danish (Class 86) and British (Class 87) electric locomotives like those involved in the incident (lead locomotive nr.86.003 and second locomotive nr.87.025), as its mainline motive rolling stock, as well as diesel-hydraulic locomotives for shunting duties. Bulmarket DM, the mother corporation of Bulmarket Rail Cargo, has its headquarters and main base of operations, with its own railway yard, Bulmarket Port and fuel storage facilities, in the city of Ruse. Investigation Bulgaria's Chief Prosecutor opened an investigation into the accident. The owner of Bulmarket DM, Stanko Stankov, expressed his intention to involve an international team of railway incident experts from France, Germany and the Czech Republic to execute an independent investigation into the case. This was rebutted by the Attorney General's Office; it issued a statement that according to Bulgarian law such an investigation has absolutely no legal basis and justification, because the Attorney General's Office (–ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω–∞ –ü—Ä–æ–∫—É—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞) and its special division for investigation of severe crimes and incidents ‚Äî the National Inquiry Service (–ù–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª–Ω–∞ –°–ª–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–∞ –°–ª—É–∂–±–∞) ‚Äî are the only legal bodies authorized by the country's laws to execute such investigations. On that basis, the police authorities guarding the perimeter denied access to the crash site to technical experts involved by the train operator. Residents were not allowed into their homes as a state of emergency was declared, but volunteers were allowed to be in Hitrino. Bullmarket DM also had to remove cisterns within 15 days. According to the State Agency for National Security (semi-autonomous agency within the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior, tasked with counter- terrorism, counter-espionage and high-profile corruption cases) the probable trigger for the incident was a railroad switch that had not been properly secured.https://www.24chasa.bg/novini/article/5952587 The investigators from the National Inquiry Service of the Attorney General's Office found that upon derailment at the railroad switch a crash between the fifth and sixth tank wagons led to the towing hook of one of them causing a rupture in the lower frontal part of the gas tank of the other. The discharged gas fumes from the liquid gas reached a bakery located in immediate proximity to the railway station, and its furnaces ignited them, causing the violent explosion.http://www.dnes.bg/stranata/2016/12/11/skysana-vryzka-mejdu-dve- cisterni-dovela-do-ada-v-hitrino.325181 According to ammunition experts, the chain of events led to an equivalent of an oversized thermobaric weapon with blasting energy four to five times greater than the TNT- equivalent.http://www.168chasa.bg/article/5935704 Reactions Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov visited the scene. He called for people to donate blood as there was a shortage in the local hospitals. Local response alleviated the shortages. Bulgarian Transport Minister Ivaylo Moskovski also visited the site, along with top rail officials. A national day of mourning was declared for 12 December 2016. The Bulgarian Government announced that a fund of 10 million leva (‚Ç¨5.1 million) was to be made available following a special Cabinet meeting on 12 December. The money would be distributed in two ways: 5 million leva (‚Ç¨2.55 million) would go to the Hitrino Municipality, and the other 5 million leva (‚Ç¨2.55 million) would go to the Labour and Social Policy Ministry. The Interior Ministry stated that people who had lost identity documents, passports and driving licences in the fire would have them replaced free of charge.

The original 1936-neon sign \\"Hostrups Have\\" above the main entrance to the gardens. Hostrups Have (lit. \\"Hostrup's Garden\\") is a famous functionalist housing estate and associated green space located at the corner of Falkoner All√© and Rolighedsvej in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen, Denmark. Designed by Danish architect Hans Dahlerup Berthelsen in 1935-36. Hostrups Have is named after the playwright Jens Christian Hostrup. It has its own post code (1954 Frederiksberg C). History The housing development is located at the site of the old Rubens Kl√¶defabrik, a textile factory which opened at the site in 1857. It closed and was demolished in 1927. Hostrups Have was built by the developer Harald Simonsen. The development was designed by the architect Hans Dahlerup Berthelsen. The foundation stone was set by prime minister Thorvald Stauning on 20 June 1935. The housing estate was inaugurated in 1936. It was named after the author Jens Christian Hostrup who used to live at nearby villa \\"Rolighed\\". In 2007, Hostrups Have was converted into an andelsforening. In 2017 sold to Heimstaden. Architecture Hostrups Have is a typical example of the Danish Functionalist style which became popular in the 1930s. The three winged complex is built over five storeys in brick with granite and travertine detailing at the entrances. All apartments have balconies. A neon sign from 1937 with the name of the complex is located above the main gate on Rolighedsvej. A glass clock located at the top of the north wing is illuminated at night. The complex originally integrated the 45-metre tall chimney from the former factory but it was removed in July 2014. Hostrups Have consists of 680 apartments and have a total area of 60,000 square metres. It originally also comprised 30 commercial tenancies. The garden The garden space in the centre of Hostrups Have consists of lawns, old solitaire trees and perennial flower beds. Artworks include the sculpture \\"Hvilende Kvinde\\" (Resting Woman) from 1937 by danish artist Gunnar Hammerich. Another sculpture depicts the danish actor Poul Reumert as \\"lieutenant von Buddinge\\" in Hostrup's play Genboerne. The sculpture was created by Henning Koppel and is from the late 1970s.

Chrysis viridula is included in the genus Chrysis, and the family Chrysididae (the cuckoo wasps). It is a parasitoid of a number of species of eumenid wasp, mainly thse in the genus Odynerus. Distribution It is found throughout southern England and the Channel Islands, and north to northeast Yorkshire. In Wales, it is restricted to coastal areas only and has not been found in Scotland or Ireland. It is also found in many parts of mainland Europe (Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, The Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Poland, Hungary and Romania) and extending eastwards to the Caucasus, and southwards to North Africa. Appearance Chrysis virdula has a total length of about 6 to 9 millimeters. The color of the head ranges from green to turquoise, and the thorax has a flame-like color. The main body of the insect has also been described to be colorful. Genetics In Hymenoptera, the super-families of Ichnuemonidae and Chrysididae have the greatest number of chromosomes, each corresponding to about n=21. Thus, Chrysis virdula has a chromosome count which is equal to about 42 in its karyotype. Biology In Britain Chrysis viridula is a parasitoid of the eumenids Odynerus spinipes and Odynerus melanocephalus, it has a flight period of June to August but has been recorded a month either side of this. The adults feed on a variety of flowers but mainly on umbellifers. It is normally found in the vicinity of the host wasps' nest tunnels on hard banks of sand, earth or clay, and once on the wall of a church. The females lay eggs in the brood cells of the host wasps as the host larva is preparing to pupate and is creating its cocoon, or just after the cocoon has been completed. The female C. viridula can open the host cocoons to oviposit within them. When the larval C. viridula hatches its eats the host larva. On the mainland of Europe other known hosts include Odynerus reniformis, Ancistrocerus parietum and Odynerus alpinus and in Italy its distribution extends to an altitude of . This species has a thick exoskeleton which protects it from the defensive stinging attacks of the host females, to enhance this defence the female C. viridula has a concave underside and it can curl itself into a defensive ball. If she finds an undefended nest she will reverse down the nest chimney to lay her egg on the host wasp's egg. The host wasp does not normally detect the cuckoo wasp egg and seals the nest up for the winter for the new adult parasitoid to emerge in the following summer.

With his rich intellect and irony, in his short but very prolific and expressive lifetime, the artist pulled the suggestive power of his agony out of his internal depths, transforming it into rich coloring and wide and energetic strokes of his paintbrush. His in-satiate fascination with life in all aspects elevated the conflicts and passion to the level of universally human, thus creating the inner tension of form. Expressive and distorted figures in his paintings point to human faults, and fights between the good and the evil. Metaphor of human weakness is expressed in the presentations of animals which, like in fables, reveal the identity of human characters. He pulled out the monsters of his life abyss and placed them on the canvas raw. This contour of his soul in the claws of absurd is created in pain, momentarily and expressively. He embodied all his conflicts in united forces which emerge from the abyss of wandering souls. With his infantile lust for power over his surroundings, Barbarian gets rid of the feeling of inferiority in the very creative act. It was only then that he domineered and achieved intellectual balance, and belonged to himself. Thanks to characteristic pictorial language of expressive and raw artistic articulation he introduced a wealth of inventiveness in art brut, i.e. outsider art in Serbia. Besides Vojislav Jakic, Sava Sekuliƒá and Ilija Bosilj Ba≈°iƒçevic, he can be considered a worldly classic.  Exhibitions and awards  Among the most significant world exhibitions where he participated were certainly those in Paris and Bratislava, among which the Triennials and Biennials in Slovakia and Serbia were most noteworthy. He received many awards and recognition, the most remarkable being Grand Prix for painting at the Thirteenth Biennial of Na√Øve and Marginal Art in Jagodina, Serbia in 2007. The greatest collection of his paintings is at Museum of Na√Øve and Marginal Art (MNMA), Jagodina, Serbia.

It was formed mainly by lower caste (middle and lower class) peasantry and landless labourers. It existed during 1974‚Äì1976.  Background  In 1960s, when the Naxalite movement started under the leadership of Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist), the poor peasantry and agricultural labourers who belonged mainly to the lower castes started taking side with the communists in central Bihar across the districts of Bhojpur, Gaya, Chhapra, Siwan, Patna and Aurangabad. Several violent armed clashes occurred between the landlords and poor/landless peasantry. In 1970s, CPI (ML) faced hard offence from central and state governments throughout India and splintered into several ML factions. In 1974, one of the ML factions was able to hold on to the grounds and reorganised itself into the CPI(ML) Liberation political party. Meanwhile, the landlords/landowners most of whom economically were from upper class peasantry (mainly upper caste ) organised themselves based on caste lines into several landlord gentries. In retaliation Lal Sena guerrilla armed squads, were organised by then underground CPI (ML) Liberation.  After 2005  Since the late 2000s, Lal Sena's squad activity has been curtailed.

The unit and its successors defended Plymouth Dockyard and the Devon coast (and, briefly, Iceland) from 1861 to 1961. Origin The 2nd Administrative Brigade, Devonshire Artillery Volunteers was formed at Devonport, Plymouth on 3 January 1861 as a headquarters for a number of Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVCs) that had been raised in Devonshire in response to the invasion scare of 1859. A 1st Administrative Brigade had been formed the previous year, but the number of units in the county had continued to grow and they were split between the two headquarters. The 2nd Admin Brigade took the units in the western part of the county and was based at Devonport, Plymouth, with the following composition:Beckett, Appendix VIII.2nd Devonshire Volunteer Artillery at Regiments.orgLitchfield & Westlake, pp. 52‚Äì3. * 6th (Dartmouth) Devonshire AVC, raised 25 January 1860; transferred from 1st to 2nd Administrative Brigade in January 1861 * 10th (Salcombe) Devonshire AVC, raised 7 July 1860; transferred from 1st to 2nd Administrative Brigade in January 1861 * 12th (Devonport Dockyard) Devonshire AVC, raised 20 December 1860; transferred from 1st to 2nd Administrative Brigade in February 1862 * 13th (Keyham, Devon) Devonshire AVC, raised 7 December 1860; the nucleus came from the Keyham Steam FactoryBeckett, p. 58.Keyham Dockyard at Grace's Guides. The unit's HQ moved from Devonport to Dartmouth in 1874 before returning three years later. The commanding officer from 1864 was Lieutenant- Colonel Charles Hayne, who was also a Captain in the South Devon Militia. He was succeeded by Lt-Col Alex Ridgway, a former captain in the 1st Devon Militia (appointed 1873). By 1866 the 12th AVC had four companies and the 13th had two. A cadet corps was attached to the unit from 1871 to 1879.Army Lists. In February 1880, the AVCs were consolidated, and the 2nd Devonshire Administrative Brigade became the 6th (soon changed to 2nd) Devonshire AVC with the following composition: * No 1 Battery at Dartmouth, former 6th Corps * No 2 Battery at Salcombe, former 10th Corps * Nos 3, 4, 5 & 6 Batteries at Devonport, former 12th Corps * Nos 7 & 8 Batteries at Keyham, former 13th Corps In 1893 the HQ and Nos 1 and 3‚Äì9 Companies were based at 14 Paradise Place at Stoke in Devonport,Devonport at Drill Hall Project. and No 2 Company was at Ridge Park Road, Plympton,Plympton at Drill Hall Project. and Fore Street, Salcombe at Fore Street, Salcombe.Salcombe at Drill Hall Project. In the same year the War Office Mobilisation Scheme had allocated the 2nd Devonshire Artillery Volunteers to the Plymouth fixed defences.Mobilization Tables for Home Defence, List of Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteer Units, HMSO, London, 1893 The corps was attached to the Western Division of the Royal Artillery (RA) in April 1882 and changed its name to 2nd Devonshire Volunteer Artillery in November 1891. In January 1902 it was attached to the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA) and became the 2nd Devonshire RGA (Volunteers). A new cadet corps was formed at Plymouth and Mannamead College in 1900, but was transferred to the 2nd (Prince of Wales's) Volunteer Battalion, Devonshire Regiment in 1907. Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908, the 2nd Devonshire RGA became simply the Devonshire RGA as a Defended Ports unit with the following composition:Litchfield, pp. 42‚Äì8.London Gazette 20 March 1908. * HQ at Lambhay Hill, PlymouthPlymouth at Drill Hall Project. * No 1 Heavy Battery at Drill Hall, Avenue Road, Ilfracombe,Ilfracombe at Drill Hall Project. with Left Section detached at LynmouthLynmouth at Drill Hall Project. * No 2 Heavy Battery at Devonport, with detachments at Plympton and Salcombe * Nos 3 & 4 Companies at Plymouth * Nos 5 & 6 Companies at Devonport Until 1908, the battery at Ilfracombe (two new 6-inch breechloading guns were installed at Beacon Point in 1905) had been the responsibility of No 10 Battery of the 1st Devonshire RGA (V), which was converted into a field artillery unit under the Haldane Reforms.Artillery Volunteer Battery at John Moore's History of Hele. World War I and after The unit was mobilised in the South Western Coast Defences on the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, and raised two additional companies, Nos 1 & 2\\\\. Although the unit did not serve overseas, it is probable that volunteers did serve with other RGA units, and there is a memorial to men of the unit who died during the war.RGA (TF) at Regimental Warpath.Coast Defences at British Army 1914.IWM WMR ref 25636. The Devon RGA was reconstituted in 1920, and became the Devonshire Coast Brigade, RGA in the new Territorial Army (TA) in 1921, with the following composition: * 157 Battery at Lambhay Hill * 158 Battery at Plympton When the RGA was merged back into the RA in 1924, the unit was redesignated as the Devonshire Heavy Brigade, RA. In 1932 it was amalgamated with the Cornwall Heavy Brigade to form the Devonshire and Cornwall Heavy Brigade, with the following composition:Titles and Designations 1927.Litchfield, p. 34. * 157 (Devon) Battery at Artillery Drill Hall, Lambhay Hill * 158 Battery at Drill Hall, Plympton * 164 (Cornwall) Battery moved from Redruth to new Drill Hall, Ker Street, Devonport, opened in 1938. In 1936 'Cornwall' was dropped from the title, and when the RA replaced its unit designation of 'brigade' by the more normal 'regiment' in November 1938, the unit became the Devonshire Heavy Regiment, RA. World War II As the TA expanded in the months leading up to the outbreak of World War II, a new 193 Heavy Battery at Falmouth, Cornwall was added to the regiment in August 1939. With the threat of invasion after the Dunkirk evacuation, the coastal artillery defending the United Kingdom was greatly increased.Farndale, Annex B. In 1940 the Cornish element of the regiment regained its independence as the Cornwall Heavy Regiment, later 523rd (Cornwall) Coast Regiment.Farndale, Annex M. Then in April 1941, the Devonshire Heavy Regiment was reorganised to form three Coast Regiments: * 566 (Devon) Coast Regiment, RA ** 159 Bty at Drake's Island, Plymouth SoundDrake's Island at Victorian Forts ** 160 Bty at Drake's Island; moved to Mount Batten, Plymouth Sound, 10 April 1942; to Newhaven, East Sussex by 1 June 1945 ** 161 Bty at Western Kings Redoubt, PlymouthWestern Kings Redoubt at Victorian Forts. * 567 (Devon) Coast Regiment, RA * 568 (Devon) Coast Regiment, RA All three regiments served in the defences in the Plymouth area, but 566th Coast Regiment was sent for a spell in 1941 to garrison Iceland as part of Alabaster Force.Farndale, Annex H. 567th and 568th Coast Regiments were placed in 'suspended animation' in 1944 and 1943 respectively, and their batteries posted to the 566th, after which it was renamed 566th (Devon and Cornwall) Coast Regiment. The regiment was placed in suspended animation in 1946. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the 566th and 567th Regiments were reformed as 407th/408th (Devon) Coast Regiment, separating into two regiments the following year; 568th was not reformed. Both 407th and 408th were part of the 102nd Coast Artillery Brigade. In 1948 the 408th was redesignated 408th (Devon) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, but was placed in suspended animation in 1949 and subsequently disbanded.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947.372‚Äì413 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.Coast Artillery Brigades at British Army 1945 on. 407th (Devon) Coast Regiment continued at Plymouth until 31 October 1956, when it was absorbed by 256th (Wessex) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA (which had originally been the 1st Admin Brigade of Devonshire Artillery Volunteers, see above).235‚Äì265 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.

He is closely associated with the Hittite god Tar·∏´unna and the Hurrian god Teshub.  Name  The name of the Proto-Anatolian weather god can be reconstructed as *T·πõ·∏´u-ent- (\\"conquering\\"), a participle form of the Proto-Indo-European root *terh2, \\"to cross over, pass through, overcome\\". It has cognates in Hittite tar·∏´u-, Latin trans-, Dutch door, German durch, and English through. The same name was used in almost all Anatolian languages: Hittite Tar·∏´unna-; Carian TrquŒ¥-; Milyan Trqq√±t-, and Lycian: Trqqas (A), Trqqiz (B), who has been identified with Zeus. Norbert Oettinger has argued that the functions of the Anatolian weather god ultimately come from the Proto-Indo-European god Perkwunos, but that they did not preserve the old name to coin instead the new epithet T·πõ·∏´u-ent- (\\"conquering\\"), which sounded close to the name of the Hattian Storm-god Taru. In Luwian cuneiform of the Bronze Age, his name appears as Tar·∏´unt- (Tar·∏´uwant- in the oldest texts). He is also named using the Sumerograms dU (\\"God 10\\") or dIM (\\"God Wind\\"). In hieroglyphic Luwian, his name was written as Tarhunza- and Tarhunta- or with the ideograms (DEUS) TONITRUS (\\"God Thunder\\"). The god's name often appears in personal names. The oldest example is \\"Tar·∏´uan\\", known from a 19th-century BC Hittite text from K√ºltepe. Among the Luwians, it was customary for people to bear a simple god's name, but names were often combined. In the Bronze Age and Early Iron Age, these names are very common. The latest examples derive from Hellenistic southern Anatolia, like Tarkumbios (Œ§Œ±œÅŒ∫œÖŒºŒ≤ŒØŒøœÇ, luw. *Tarhun-piya- \\"Tarhun- Gift‚Äú) or Trokombigremis (Œ§œÅŒøŒ∫ŒøŒºŒ≤ŒØŒ≥œÅŒµŒºŒπœÇ; *Tarhun-pihra-mi- \\"Shining Tarhun\\") which are attested in Cilicia. Additionally, the Hittite city of Tarhuntassa was named after the Luwian weather god.  Description  Tarhunza of the vineyard; ƒ∞vriz relief The Luwian weather god retained his Indo-European roots more clearly than the Hittite weather god Tar·∏´unna. Thus, he was less closely linked with the bull, which was common in Anatolia, than with the horse. According to the ritual against horse-plague of U·∏´·∏´amuwa in Arzawa, the horses of the weather god were fed and his chariot was oiled with sheep fat.HT 1 ii 34ff. The various Luwian epithets of Tarhunz indicate his functions. He was 'powerful' (cuneiform: dU muwatalla/i-; hieroglyphic: muwatalis Tarhunz) and 'helpful' (cuneiform: dU warra·∏´ita≈°≈°a≈°; \\"Tarhunz the Helper\\"), but also 'stern' (cuneiform: tapattana≈°≈°i- dU). Thus, in Iron Age depictions, Tarhunz is shown slaying enemies with his axe. In battle he rushed ahead of the king, ensuring victory, and he could therefore be referred to as \\"Tarhunz of the (battle)field\\" (cuneiform: immara≈°≈°a- dIM) or \\"Tarhunz of the commander\\" (hieroglyphic: kuwalanassis Tarhunz). The weather god is also connected with mountains (cuneiform: ariyattali≈° dIM-anz; hieroglyphic: aritalasis Tarhunz; \\"Mountain-Tarhunz\\"). In Iron Age Carchemish, there was a cult of Tarhunz of Mount Arputa (Arputawanis Tarhunz). As a sky god, he was referred to as Tarhunz of the Heavens. As a shining or lightning-wielding god he bore the epithets pi·∏´aimi≈° (\\"flashing, shining\\") and pi·∏´a≈°≈°a≈°≈°i≈° (\\"of the thunderbolt, of the flash\\"). The name of the winged horse Pegasus in Greek mythology is derived from this last epithet. = Personal god of Muwatalli II = The Hittite Great King Muwatalli II named the weather god of the thunderbolt (dU pi·∏´a≈°≈°a≈°≈°i≈°) as his protective deity, calling him \\"weather god of the thunderbolt, my lord, king of heaven.\\" By his account, the god raised him and installed him as king of the Hittite realm. His prayer to the god shows Luwian characteristics: :\\"Weather god of the thunderbolt, glow on me like the moonlight, shine over me like the son god of heaven!\\" :(KUB 6.45 iii 68-70) = Tarhunz of the vineyard = A Luwian innovation is the idea of the weather god of the vineyard. He is first attested in a southern Anatolian vineyard ritual from the 16th century BC, in which he is called upon to make the royal vineyard thrive, along with the goddess Mamma and other divine couples, like Runtiya and Ala or Telipinu and Maliya. During the Iron Age, Tarhunz of the vineyard (turwarasina Tarhunza) was worshipped with particular intensity in Tabal. King Warpalawas II of Tuwana (2nd half of the 8th century BC) had an imposing rock relief with a depiction of this aspect of the god erected near a productive spring at ƒ∞vriz. Tarhunz is depicted as a bearded god with curly hair and a helmet. He wears a knee-length skirt and a belt, but no sword. In his left hand he holds a bunch of grapes and ears of corn in his right hand. Animals were offered to him and in return \\"Plenty came down from the heavens and plenty came up from the earth.\\" In Sam'al he appears in an Aramaic version as Hadad of the vineyard (hdd krmn 'Hadad Karm√Æn').  Cult sites Already in the early Bronze Age, Aleppo (Halpa) was a major city of the weather god. With the conquest of Syria by Suppiluliuma I (1355-1325 BC), this city was incorporated into the Hittite realm and Suppiluliuma installed his son Telipinu as priest-king of Aleppo. The temple of the weather god of Aleppo was adjusted to conform to Hittite cult. During the Iron Age, a new temple was dedicated to Tarhunz of Halpa.  Dragon slayer  Late Luwian relief from Arslantepe with the weather god and a companion battling a serpent monster In a relief from Arslantepe, the weather god and a companion are shown battling against a snake-like water creature. This depiction recalls the Hittite Illuyanka and Hurrian ·∏™edammu, a myth which is widespread in Proto-Indo- European religion and in the Near East. The Anatolian myth was taken over into Greek mythology, in which Zeus battles with the dragon-like Typhon. It has been suggested that the myth was taken over from Cilicia in particular, since there was intensive contact between Greeks and Anatolians there from a very early date. The key locations of the myth also point in this direction: Mount Kasios in northwestern Syria and the area around Corycus in Rough Cilicia, where Luwian religion endured into the Roman period.  Depiction Jupiter Dolichenus of Heddernheim There are no depictions from the Bronze Age that can be identified as the Luwian weather god. However, over sixty reliefs and statues of the weather god are known from the Iron Age. These can be divided into three types. In the first type of depiction, he is shown as a bearded god with a horned helmet, short skirt, and a sword hanging from his belt. In the rear hand he holds an axe and in the front hand he holds a thunderbolt. A winged sun may be depicted above his head, indicating his divine authority. The second type depicts him similarly, but standing atop a bull. This image was used for the weather god of Aleppo, which exercised a strong influence over perceptions of Tarhunz in Syria. This depiction disappeared in the 7th century BC, but reappeared in Northern Syrian at the beginning of the Roman Imperial period and was brought to central Europe as Jupiter Dolichenus, whose cult centre lay in Doliche, northwest of Carchemish. The , in particular, shows obvious similarities to the Luwian depiction of Tarhunz in Northern Syria. The third type shows the weather god with ears of corn and bunches of grapes. This type is common in Tabal (Anatolia). The aforementioned ƒ∞vriz relief is the best known example. This version of Tarhunz may be depicted unarmed or shown with an axe or thunderbolt. = Depictions of Tarhunz = * : inscription, probably of * : inscription of Lakawani * √áinek√∂y inscription: inscription of Awariku * G√∂kbez relief: no inscription * ƒ∞vriz relief: inscription of Warpalawas II * Ke≈ülik Stele: illegible inscription * : inscription of La * Niƒüde Stele: inscription of Muwaharani II  References   Bibliography    Further reading  * Weeden, Mark. \\"The Good God, the Wine-god and the Storm-god of the Vineyard.\\" Die Welt Des Orients 48, no. 2 (2018): 330-56. doi:10.2307/26606982. * Zolotnikova, Olga. \\"The Storm-God with a Battle-Axe on the Early 1st Millennium BC Reliefs from Eastern Anatolia/Northern Syria.\\" In Proceedings of the 9th International Congress on the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East: June 9-13, 2014, University of Basel.

He was bred in France, sired by an American stallion out of a German mare and was trained in Britain and the United Arab Emirates. As a two-year-old he won once from four starts and was gelded at the end of the year. In 2011 he showed steady improvement when moved up to longer distances, winning three minor races and finishing third in both the Cesarewitch Handicap and the British Champions Long Distance Cup. He reached his peak as a four-year-old in the first half of 2012 when he won the Sagaro Stakes in track record time before taking the Gold Cup. He went on to finish third in the Goodwood Cup and the Prix du Cadran and was voted the Cartier Champion Stayer of 2012. Colour Vision failed to reproduce his best form in 2013, but ran well to finish fourth behind Estimate in the Gold Cup. He was retired from racing at the end of the year. Background Colour Vision is a grey gelding bred in France by the Capricorn Stud. As a yearling he was consigned to the Tattersalls yearling sale in October 2009 and was bought for 100,000 guineas by the trainer Mark Johnston. The colt entered the ownership of Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum the Crown Prince of Dubai, and was taken into training by Johnston at Middleham Moor in North Yorkshire. Colour Vision was sired by Rainbow Quest who won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe before becoming a very successful breeding stallion. Rainbow Quest's other progeny included Quest for Fame, Saumarez, Raintrap, Nedawi, Armiger, Spectrum and Millenary. His dam Give Me Five, from whom he inherited his grey colour, was a successful racehorse in Germany, winning the Group Three Frankfurter Stutenpreis as a three-year-old in 2004. She was descended from the German broodmare Grolldochnicht (foaled 1952) who was the female line ancestor of Gaia (Irish Oaks) and Authaal (Irish St Leger). Racing career =2010: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut Colour Vision started a 25/1 outsider for a maiden race over one mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 13 August and finished eleventh of the twelve runners. Viewed retrospectively, the race was one of the strongest maidens ever staged at the course as Frankel finished first ahead of Nathaniel and Genius Beast (Sandown Classic Trial). Two weeks later he contested a less competitive maiden over the same distance at Thirsk Racecourse and recorded his first success as he stayed on in the closing stages to win by half a length at odds of 18/1. In his two remaining races Colour Vision ran very poorly as he finished last in \\"nurseries\\" (handicap races for two-year-olds) at Doncaster in September and Epsom in October. =2011: three-year-old season= Colour Vision began his second season promisingly as he finished a close third to Brown Panther in a handicap over one and a half miles at Chester Racecourse on 4 May but then finished unplaced in handicaps over the same distance at Musselburgh and Salisbury in June. When he was stepped up in distance for a two-mile handicap at Chester in July he showed much better form and won by four and a half lengths from the four-year- old filly Never Can Tell. Six days later Colour Vision was assigned a weight of 139 pounds for a handicap over one and three quarter miles at Haydock Park and improved again. Starting the 13/8 favourite he took the lead three furlongs from the finish and drew away in the straight to win by ten and a half lengths despite being eased down in the final strides. In a handicap at Ascot Racecourse a week later he finished second to the four-year-old Keys after repeatedly veering to the left and swishing his tail in the closing stages. With his weights in handicap races rising, Colour Vision was switched to compete in weight-for-age races starting with a trip to France for the Listed Prix Michel Houyvet at Deauville Racecourse on 15 August. He finished fourth of the seven runners behind Gaily Game after again failing to keep a straight course in the closing stages. Two poor performances followed in September as he ran unplaced in a minor race at Salisbury and the Listed Stand Cup at Chester. On 3 October the colt started 11/8 second favourite for the Phil Bull Trophy, a minor weight-for-age event over at Pontefract Racecourse. Ridden by Silvestre de Sousa, who had partnered the colt in his win at Haydock, he took the lead three furlongs out and won \\"readily\\" by two and three quarter lengths from Fire Fighter. Five days after his Pontefract win, Colour Vision carried a weight of 127 pounds in the Cesarewitch, one of Britain's biggest staying handicaps, over two and a quarter miles at Newmarket and finished third of the thirty-three runners behind Never Can Tell. Colour Vision was back on the track a week later and moved up to Group Three class for the British Champions Long Distance Cup over two miles at Ascot. With de Sousa in the saddle he was restrained in the early stages before producing a strong late run on the outside to take third place behind Fame and Glory and the favourite Opinion Poll. At the end of 2011 Colour Vision was transferred to the ownership of Godolphin Racing, the racing operation of Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum's father Sheikh Mohammed. He joined the training stable of Saeed bin Suroor and spent the winter in Dubai. =2012: four-year-old season= On his first appearance as a four-year-old Colour Vision contested the Group Three Sagaro Stakes on 2 May. The race was run that year on the Polytrack surface at Kempton Park Racecourse after the meeting at Ascot was abandoned owing to waterlogging. Ridden for the first time by Frankie Dettori he started the 9/2 fourth choice in a six runner field with the John Gosden- trained Thimaar starting favourite ahead of Barbican and Red Cadeaux. After being restrained at the rear of the six-runner field he produced a strong run in the straight to take the lead inside the furlong. He stayed on well to win by one and a half lengths from Red Cadeaux with a gap of nine lengths back to Thimaar in third. The winning time of 3:21.50 broke the previous track record by almost three seconds. Godolphin's racing manager Simon Crisford said \\"He won well, travelled well and showed a good turn of foot in the straight. He definitely goes for the Gold Cup, as he stays all day... In fact, the further he goes, the better he is\\". In the Ascot Gold Cup on 21 June Dettori opted to ride Colour Vision in preference to Godolphin's other runner Opinion Poll who was trained by Mahmood Al Zarooni and ridden by Mickael Barzalona. In the build up to the race there had been speculation that Dettori's position as Godolphin's top jockey was under threat from Baralona, who was regarded as the team's rising star. Fame and Glory started 4/5 favourite to repeat his 2011 win in the race with the next three in the betting being the Doncaster Cup winner Saddler's Rock (9/2), Opinion Poll (5/1) and Colour Vision (6/1). The other five runners were outsiders, starting at odds of 25/1 or more. Dettori settled the gelding just behind the leaders as Gulf of Naples set a steady pace but then made a forward move in the straight. He took the lead approaching the final furlong and rallied after being headed by Opinion Poll to regain the advantage and win by half a length. Saddler's Rock was a neck away in third ahead of Gulf of Naples with Fame and Glory running poorly to finish seventh. The racecourse stewards held an inquiry into possible interference between the first two finishers but left the result unaltered. After the race Dettori, who had celebrated with his customary flying dismount, commented ‚ÄúI am delighted for the team and myself, as it has been a very hard week, so I‚Äôm glad this one came up. We have a great team and it‚Äôs a brilliant result for us. It‚Äôs a joy to win. Me and Mickael are great friends, but you are by yourself when you are out there and you want to win for yourself. It doesn‚Äôt matter who is in the finish as you always try to win.\\" After a six- week absence, Colour Vision started second favourite when carrying top weight of 137 pounds for the Goodwood Cup on 2 August. After racing prominently he took second place behind Saddler's Rock in the straight but could make no further progress and lost the runner-up spot in the final strides to Askar Tau. In the Doncaster Cup on 14 September he took the lead three furlongs out but faded in the closing stages and finished seventh of the nine finishers behind Times Up. In the Prix du Cadran over 4000 metres on heavy ground at Longchamp Racecourse on 7 October he finished third behind Molly Malone and Hi Jinx with Saddler's Rock in fourth place. Two weeks later he ran for the second time in the British Champions Long Distance Cup but after racing in third place he dropped from contention and finished tailed-off last of the nine runners. =2013: five-year-old season= Colour Vision remained in training as a five-year-old but finished no better than fourth in his five starts. After finishing seventh behind the French filly Gloomy Sunday in the Henry II Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse on 30 May he attempted to repeat his 2012 success in the Ascot Gold Cup. Starting at odds of 12/1 he took the lead approaching the last quarter mile but was overtaken a furlong out and finished fourth behind Estimate. In his three remaining raceshe finished seventh behind Brown Panther in the Goodwood Cup, sixth in the Lonsdale Cup at York Racecourse in August, and fifth to Times Up in the Doncaster Cup on 13 September. Assessment and awards In November 2012 at the Cartier Racing Award Colour Vision was voted the year's Champion Stayer. In the 2012 World Thoroughbred Rankings Colour Vision's rating of 117 made him only the 123rd best horse in the world but the fourth best over Extended distances behind Encke, Green Moon and Orfevre.

The other side picture presents Italia. The fresco transferred to canvas measures 285 by 192 cm and is exhibited in the St√§delsches Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt am Main. Veit belonged to the artistic circle of the catholic and conservative Nazarener. They were impressed by the German Middle Ages.

Location The street is located on the edge of downtown Bydgoszcz. It starts on the northern side of Brda river, and stretches northbound to reach Jagiello≈Ñska street. History The street appears on the maps of the area only during the second half of the 19th century, at the same time as happened Bromberg's main expansion, thanks to the development of the Prussian Eastern Railway. City population grew from 12,900 inhabitants in 1852 to 57,700 inhabitants in 1910. Krakowska Street, then Bollmann Stra√üe during Prussian period, was located on the territory of a neighbouring suburb, Schr√∂ttersdorf. It almost marked during those years (1870s to 1920) the border with Bromberg area, stretching from the Brahe river to Promenaden stra√üe (now Jagiello≈Ñska street). The western side of the street witnessed in the 1860s the inception and expansion of the Bydgoszcz District Gas Plant: the complex initially covered an area of 0.8 ha, but soon grew up to 7.4 ha after World War I. In 1920, after Bydgoszcz reintegrated Polish territory, this suburban district, including Krakowska Street, has been subsumed to be part of Bydgoszcz city area. The street was finally entirely organized and inhabited only in the late 1900s (1911). =Naming= Through history, the street bore the following names: * 1870s‚Äì1920, Bollmann Stra√üe,Plan der Stadt Bromberg, 1914 from Hemann Bollmann, an industrial pioneer; * 1920‚Äì1939, Ulica KrakowskaPlan Miasta Bydgoszczy, 1933 * 1939‚Äì1945, Bollmann Stra√üeStadtplan Bromberg, 1941 * Since 1945, Ulica Krakowska (Krakowska Street).

Harty is a co-founder of the \\"Animal Art in the Park\\" exhibition, which is a wildlife art exhibition held annually in Algonquin Park Harty continues to teacher newer artists in the fall at the tanamakoon fall art program. Early life Harty was born in the small prairie town of Shaunavon, Saskatchewan in 1957. Harty first started drawing wildlife on the prairies at the age of 3 years old. His family moved to Regina, Saskatchewan by the time he entered kindergarten. In his teens, Dwayne attended Campion High School.  Training  By 18 years old Harty was committed to developing his skill as an artists. To achieve this goal he began working with Clarence Tillenius at the Okanagan Summer School of the Arts during his summers. The rest of his year was spent in Santa Fe, New Mexico working with Robert Lougheed. With the exception of the 2 years Dwayne spent in New York, he maintained this training for eight years. At the age of 20 Harty moved to New York City to study at the Art Students League of New York. Harty's teachers at the Art Students League of New York included; Steven Kidd, David Leffel, Thomas Fogarty Jr., Robert Beverly Hale and Terence Coyle. While in New York, Dwayne had the chance to met the then Dean of the American animal artists, Paul Bransom. At age 27, Harty attended a Bob Kuhn Workshop in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which would become Harty's home about 20 years later. Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative In 2012, Harty was commissioned to join the \\"Yellowstone to Yukon: the Journey of Wildlife and Art\\" exhibition by the Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative. As part of this exhibition, Harty spent 3 years exploring some of the most remote parts of North America by horseback, truck, raft, and helicopter. Throughout this journey, Harty was able to produce a wealth of paintings, some of which were later displayed as part of the exhibit, while at least one painting was not seen publicly but was added to the private collection of Ted Turner.

According to U.S. intelligence agencies, the operation was ordered directly by Putin. The Internet Research Agency (IRA), based in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and described as a troll farm, created thousands of social media accounts that purported to be Americans supporting radical political groups, and planned or promoted events in support of Trump and against Clinton; they reached millions of social media users between 2013 and 2017. Fabricated articles and disinformation were spread from Russian government-controlled media, and promoted on social media. Additionally, computer hackers affiliated with the Russian military intelligence service (GRU) infiltrated information systems of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), and Clinton campaign officials, notably chairman John Podesta, and publicly released stolen files and emails through DCLeaks, Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks during the election campaign. Several individuals connected to Russia contacted various Trump campaign associates, offering business opportunities to the Trump Organization and damaging information on Clinton. Russian government officials have denied involvement in any of the hacks or leaks. Russian interference activities triggered strong statements from American intelligence agencies, a direct warning by then-U.S. President Barack Obama to Russian President Vladimir Putin, renewed economic sanctions against Russia, closures of Russian diplomatic facilities and expulsion of their staff. The Senate and House Intelligence Committees conducted their own investigations into the matter. Trump denied the interference had occurred, contending that it was a \\"hoax\\" perpetrated by Democrats to explain Clinton's loss. Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey in part over his investigation of Russian meddling. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) opened the Crossfire Hurricane investigation of Russian interference on July 31, 2016, including a special focus on links between Trump associates and Russian officials and suspected coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Russian attempts to interfere in the election were first disclosed publicly by members of the United States Congress on September 22, 2016, confirmed by United States intelligence agencies on October 7, 2016, and further detailed by the Director of National Intelligence office in January 2017. The FBI's work was taken over in May 2017 by former FBI director Robert Mueller, who led a Special Counsel investigation until March 2019. Mueller concluded that Russian interference was \\"sweeping and systematic\\" and \\"violated U.S. criminal law\\", and he indicted twenty-six Russian citizens and three Russian organizations. The investigation also led to indictments and convictions of Trump campaign officials and associated Americans, on unrelated charges. The Special Counsel's report, made public on April 18, 2019, examined numerous contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials but concluded that, though the Trump campaign welcomed the Russian activities and expected to benefit from them, there was insufficient evidence to bring any conspiracy or coordination charges against Trump or his associates. The Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee submitted the first in their five-volume 1,313-page report in July 2019 in which they concluded that the January 2017 intelligence community assessment alleging Russian interference was \\"coherent and well-constructed\\". The first volume also concluded that the assessment was \\"proper\\", learning from analysts that there was \\"no politically motivated pressure to reach specific conclusions\\". The final and fifth volume, which was the result of three years of investigations, was released on August 18, 2020, ending one of the United States \\"highest-profile congressional inquiries.\\" The Committee report found that the Russian government had engaged in an \\"extensive campaign\\" to sabotage the election in favor of Trump, which included assistance from some members of Trump's own advisers.  Background and Russian actors  = Prior Russian election interference in Ukraine = The May 2014 Ukrainian presidential election was disrupted by cyberattacks over several days, including the release of hacked emails, attempted alteration of vote tallies, and distributed denial-of-service attacks to delay the final result. They were found to have been launched by Pro-Russian hackers. Malware that would have displayed a graphic declaring far-right candidate Dmytro Yarosh the electoral winner was removed from Ukraine's Central Election Commission less than an hour before polls closed. Despite this, Channel One Russia falsely reported that Mr. Yarosh had won, fabricating a fake graphic from the election commission's website. Political scientist Peter Ordeshook said in 2017, \\"These faked results were geared for a specific audience in order to feed the Russian narrative that has claimed from the start that ultra-nationalists and Nazis were behind the revolution in Ukraine.\\" The same Sofacy malware used in the Central Election Commission hack was later found on the servers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Around the same time as Russia's attempt to hack the 2014 elections, the Obama administration received a report suggesting that the Kremlin was building a disinformation program which could be used to interfere in Western politics. = Vladimir Putin = American intelligence agencies concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered the covert operation, while Putin denied the allegations. At the 2018 Helsinki summit, Putin said that he wanted Trump to win because he talked about normalizing the U.S.‚ÄìRussia relationship. In December 2016, two senior intelligence officials told several U.S. news media outlets that they were highly confident that the operation to interfere in the 2016 presidential election was personally directed by Vladimir Putin. Under Putin's direction, the goals of the operation evolved from first undermining American's trust in their democracy to undermining Clinton's campaign, and by the fall of 2016 to directly helping Trump's campaign, because Putin thought Trump would ease economic sanctions. The officials believe Putin became personally involved after Russia accessed the DNC computers, because such an operation would require high-level government approval. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest and Obama foreign policy advisor and speechwriter Ben Rhodes agreed with this assessment, with Rhodes saying operations of this magnitude required Putin's consent. In January 2017, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, delivered a declassified report, (representing the work of the FBI, the CIA and the NSA) with a similar conclusion: > President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the > U.S. presidential election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in > the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her > electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the > Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. > We have high confidence in these judgments. Putin blamed Clinton for the 2011‚Äì2012 mass protests in Russia against his rule, according to the report (Clinton was U.S. Secretary of State at the time).\\"The top four reasons Vladimir Putin might have a grudge against Hillary Clinton\\". National Post. December 16, 2016. FBI Director James Comey also has testified that Putin disliked Clinton and preferred her opponent, and Clinton herself has accused Putin of having a grudge against her. Michael McFaul, who was U.S. ambassador to Russia, said the operation could be a retaliation by Putin against Clinton.\\"Why Putin hates Hillary\\". Politico. July 26, 2016. Russian security expert Andrei Soldatov has said, \\"[The Kremlin] believes that with Clinton in the White House it will be almost impossible to lift sanctions against Russia. So it is a very important question for Putin personally. This is a question of national security.\\" Russian officials have denied the allegations multiple times. In June 2016, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied any connection of Russia to the DNC hacks. In December 2016, when U.S. intelligence officials publicly accused Putin of being directly involved in the covert operation, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he was \\"astonished\\" by this \\"nonsense\\". Putin also has denied any Kremlin involvement in the election campaign, though in June 2017 he told journalists that \\"patriotically minded\\" Russian hackers may have been responsible for the campaign cyberattacks against the U.S., and in 2018 he stated that he had wanted Trump to win the election \\"because he talked about bringing the U.S.-Russia relationship back to normal.\\" = U.S. counter-disinformation team = The United States Department of State planned to use a unit formed with the intention of combating disinformation from the Russian government, but it was disbanded in September 2015 after department heads missed the scope of propaganda before the 2016 U.S. election. The unit had been in development for eight months prior to being scrapped. Titled the Counter-Disinformation Team, it would have been a reboot of the Active Measures Working Group set up by the Reagan Administration. It was created under the Bureau of International Information Programs. Work began in 2014, with the intention of countering propaganda from Russian sources such as TV network RT (formerly called Russia Today). A beta website was ready, and staff were hired by the U.S. State Department for the unit prior to its cancellation. U.S. Intelligence officials explained to former National Security Agency analyst and counterintelligence officer John R. Schindler writing in The New York Observer (published at the time by Jared Kushner) that the Obama Administration decided to cancel the unit, as they were afraid of antagonizing Russia. A State Department representative told the International Business Times after being contacted regarding the closure of the unit, that the U.S. was disturbed by propaganda from Russia, and the strongest defense was sincere communication. U.S. Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy Richard Stengel was the point person for the unit before it was canceled. Stengel had written in 2014 that RT was engaged in a disinformation campaign about Ukraine. = Russian Institute for Strategic Studies = The Russian Institute for Strategic Studies began working for the Russian presidency after 2009. In April 2017, Reuters cited several unnamed U.S. officials as having stated that the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies (RISS) had developed a strategy to sway the U.S. election to Donald Trump and, failing that, to disillusion voters. The development of strategy was allegedly ordered by Putin and directed by former officers of Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), retired SVR general Leonid Petrovich Reshetnikov being head of the RISS at the time. The Institute had been a part of the SVR until 2009, whereafter it has worked for the Russian Presidential Administration. The U.S. officials said the propaganda efforts began in March 2016. The first set of recommendations, issued in June 2016, proposed that Russia support a candidate for U.S. president more favorable to Russia than Obama had been, via Russia-backed news outlets and a social media campaign. It supported Trump until October, when another conclusion was made that Hillary Clinton was likely to win, and the strategy should be modified to work to undermine U.S. voters‚Ä≤ faith in their electoral system and a Clinton presidency by alleging voter fraud in the election. RISS director Mikhail Fradkov and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied the allegations. = Preparation = According to a February 2018 criminal indictment, more than two years before the election, two Russian women obtained visas for what the indictment alleged was a three-week reconnaissance tour of the United States, including battleground states such as Colorado, Michigan, Nevada and New Mexico, to gather intelligence on American politics. The 2018 indictment alleged that another Russian operative visited Atlanta in November 2014 on a similar mission. In order to establish American identities for individuals and groups within specific social media communities, hundreds of email, PayPal and bank accounts and fraudulent driver's licenses were created for fictitious Americans‚Äîand sometimes real Americans whose Social Security numbers had been stolen.  Social media and Internet trolls  According to the special counsel investigation's Mueller Report (officially named \\"Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election\\"), the first method of Russian interference used the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Kremlin-linked troll farm, to wage \\"a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\\". The Internet Research Agency also sought to \\"provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States\\". By February 2016, internal IRA documents showed an order to support the candidacies of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, while IRA members were to \\"use any opportunity to criticize\\" Hillary Clinton and the rest of the candidates. From June 2016, the IRA organized election rallies in the U.S. \\"often promoting\\" Trump's campaign while \\"opposing\\" Clinton's campaign. The IRA posed as Americans, hiding their Russian background, while asking Trump campaign members for campaign buttons, flyers, and posters for the rallies. Initially in 2016 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, \\"I think the idea that fake news on Facebook influenced the election in any way, I think is a pretty crazy idea.\\" Russian use of social media to disseminate propaganda content was very broad. Facebook and Twitter were used, but also Reddit, Tumblr, Pinterest, Medium, YouTube, Vine, and Google+ (among other sites). Instagram was by far the most used platform, and one that largely remained out of the public eye until late 2018. The Mueller report lists IRA-created groups on Facebook including \\"purported conservative groups\\" (e.g. 'Tea Party News'), \\"purported Black social justice groups\\" (e.g. 'Blacktivist') \\"LGBTQ groups\\" ('LGBT United'), and \\"religious groups\\" ('United Muslims of America'). The IRA Twitter accounts included @TEN_GOP (claiming to be related to the Tennessee Republican Party), @jenn_abrams and @Pamela_Moore13; both claimed to be Trump supporters and both had 70,000 followers. Several Trump campaign members (Donald J. Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Kellyanne Conway, Brad Parscale and Michael T. Flynn) linked or reposted material from the IRA's @TEN_GOP Twitter account listed above. Other people who responded to IRA social media accounts include Michael McFaul, Sean Hannity, Roger Stone and Michael Flynn Jr. Advertisements bought by Russian operatives for the Facebook social media site are estimated to have reached 10 million users. But many more Facebook users were contacted by accounts created by Russian actors. 470 Facebook accounts are known to have been created by Russians during the 2016 campaign. Of those accounts six generated content that was shared at least 340 million times, according to research done by Jonathan Albright, research director for Columbia University's Tow Center for Digital Journalism. The most strident Internet promoters of Trump were paid Russian propagandists/trolls, who were estimated by The Guardian to number several thousand. (By 2017 the U.S. news media was focusing on the Russian operations on Facebook and Twitter and Russian operatives moved on to Instagram.) The Mueller Report found the IRA spent $100,000 for more than 3,500 Facebook advertisements from June 2015 to May 2017, which included anti-Clinton and pro-Trump advertisements. In comparison, Clinton and Trump campaigns spent $81 million on Facebook ads. Fabricated articles and disinformation were spread from Russian government-controlled outlets, RT and Sputnik to be popularized on pro-Russian accounts on Twitter and other social media. Researchers have compared Russian tactics during the 2016 U.S. election to the \\"active measures\\" of the Soviet Union during the Cold War, but made easier by the use of social media. Monitoring 7,000 pro- Trump social media accounts over a -year period, researchers J. M. Berger, Andrew Weisburd and Clint Watts found the accounts denigrated critics of Russian activities in Syria and propagated falsehoods about Clinton's health. Watts found Russian propaganda to be aimed at fomenting \\"dissent or conspiracies against the U.S. government and its institutions\\", and by autumn of 2016 amplifying attacks on Clinton and support for Trump, via social media, Internet trolls, botnets, and websites. Former site of the Internet Research Agency in Saint Petersburg, Russia Monitoring news on Twitter directed at one state (Michigan) prior to the election, Philip N. Howard found about half of it fabricated or untrue; the other half came from real news sources. Facebook originally denied that fake news on their platform had influenced the election and had insisted it was unaware of any Russian-financed advertisements but later admitted that about 126 million Americans may have seen posts published by Russia-based operatives. Criticized for failing to stop fake news from spreading on its platform during the 2016 election, Facebook originally thought that the fake-news problem could be solved by engineering, but in May 2017 it announced plans to hire 3,000 content reviewers. According to an analysis by Buzzfeed, the \\"20 top-performing false election stories from hoax sites and hyperpartisan blogs generated 8,711,000 shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook.\\" In September 2017, Facebook told congressional investigators it had discovered that hundreds of fake accounts linked to a Russian troll farm had bought $100,000 in advertisements targeting the 2016 U.S. election audience. The ads, which ran between June 2015 and May 2017, primarily focused on divisive social issues; roughly 25% were geographically targeted. Facebook has also turned over information about the Russian-related ad buys to Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Approximately 3,000 adverts were involved, and these were viewed by between four and five million Facebook users prior to the election. On November 1, 2017, the House Intelligence Committee released a sample of Facebook ads and pages that had been financially linked to the Internet Research Agency.  Cyberattack on Democrats  Hillary Clinton at the 2016 Democratic National Convention According to the Mueller Report, the second method of Russian interference saw the Russian intelligence service, the GRU, hacking into email accounts owned by volunteers and employees of the Clinton presidential campaign, including that of campaign chairman John Podesta, and also hacking into \\"the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC)\\". As a result, the GRU obtained hundreds of thousands of hacked documents, and the GRU proceeded by arranging releases of damaging hacked material via the WikiLeaks organization and also GRU's personas \\"DCLeaks\\" and \\"Guccifer 2.0\\".Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 4: \\"At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas 'DCLeaks' and 'Guccifer 2.0'. The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.\\" Starting in March 2016, the Russian military intelligence agency GRU sent \\"spearphishing\\" emails targeted more than 300 individuals affiliated with the Democratic Party or the Clinton campaign, according to the Special Counsel's July 13, 2018 Indictment. Using malware to explore the computer networks of the DNC and DCCC, they harvested tens of thousands of emails and attachments and deleted computer logs and files to obscure evidence of their activities. These were saved and released in stages to the public during the three months before the 2016 election. Some were released strategically to distract the public from media events that were either beneficial to the Clinton campaign or harmful to Trump's. The first tranche of 19,000 emails and 8,000 attachments was released on July 22, 2016, three days before the Democratic convention. The resulting news coverage created the impression that the Democratic National Committee was biased against Clinton's Democratic primary challenger Bernie Sanders (who received 43% of votes cast in the Democratic presidential primaries) and forced DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz to resign, disrupting the plans of the Clinton campaign. A second tranche was released on October 7, a few hours after the Obama Administration released a statement by the Department of Homeland Security and the director of National Intelligence accusing the Russian government of interfering in the election through hacking, and just 29 minutes after The Washington Post reported on the Access Hollywood videotape where Trump boasted about grabbing women \\"by the pussy\\". The stolen documents effectively distracted media and voter attention from both stories.\\"18 revelations from Wikileaks' hacked Clinton emails\\". BBC News. October 27, 2016. Stolen emails and documents were given both to platforms created by hackers‚Äîa website called DCLeaks and a persona called Guccifer 2.0 claiming to be a lone hacker‚Äîand to an unidentified organization believed to be WikiLeaks. (The Russians registered the domain dcleaks.com, using principally Bitcoin to pay for the domain and the hosting.) = Podesta hack = John Podesta, Chairman of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, received a phishing email on March 19, 2016, sent by Russian operatives purporting to alert him of a \\"compromise in the system\\", and urging him to change his password \\"immediately\\" by clicking on a link. This allowed Russian hackers to access around 60,000 emails from Podesta's private account. John Podesta, later told Meet the Press that the FBI spoke to him only once regarding his hacked emails and that he had not been sure what had been taken until a month before the election on October7 \\"when [WikiLeaks' Julian] Assange... started dumping them out and said they would all dump out, that's when I knew that they had the contents of my email account.\\" The WikiLeaks October 7 dump started less than an hour after The Washington Post released the Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording Access Hollywood tape, WikiLeaks announced on Twitter that it was in possession of 50,000 of Podesta's emails, and a few hours after the Obama Administration released a statement by the Department of Homeland Security and the director of National Intelligence stating \\"The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations.\\" It initially released 2,050 of these. The cache included emails containing transcripts of Clinton's paid speeches to Wall Street banks, controversial comments from staffers about Catholic voters, infighting among employees of the Clinton campaign, as well as potential Vice- Presidential picks for Clinton. The Clinton campaign did not confirm or deny the authenticity of the emails but emphasized they were stolen and distributed by parties hostile to Clinton and that \\"top national security officials\\" had stated \\"that documents can be faked as part of a sophisticated Russian misinformation campaign.\\" Podesta's e-mails, once released by WikiLeaks, formed the basis for Pizzagate, a debunked conspiracy theory that falsely posited that Podesta and other Democratic Party officials were involved in a child trafficking ring based out of pizzerias in Washington, D.C. = DNC hack = Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned her position as chairperson of the DNC. The GRU (using the names Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear) gained access to the computer network of the Democratic National Committee (DNC)‚Äîthe formal governing body of the Democratic Party‚Äîin July 2015 and maintained it until at least June 2016, when they began leaking the stolen information via the Guccifer 2.0 online persona. Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned as DNC chairwoman following the release of e-mails by WikiLeaks that showed DNC officials discussing Bernie Sanders and his presidential campaign in a derisive and derogatory manner.\\"Leaked DNC emails reveal details of anti- Sanders sentiment\\". The Guardian. July 24, 2016. Emails leaked included personal information about Democratic Party donors, with credit card and Social Security numbers,Andrea Peterson, Snowden and WikiLeaks clash over leaked Democratic Party emails, Washington Post (July 28, 2016). emails by Wasserman Schultz calling a Sanders campaign official a \\"damn liar\\". Following the July 22 publication of a large number of hacked emails by WikiLeaks, the FBI announced that it would investigate the theft of DNC emails.  Intelligence analysis of attack  In June and July 2016, cybersecurity experts and firms, including CrowdStrike, Fidelis, FireEye, Mandiant, SecureWorks, Symantec and ThreatConnect, stated the DNC email leaks were part of a series of cyberattacks on the DNC committed by two Russian intelligence groups, called Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear, also known respectively as APT28 and APT29 / The Dukes. ThreatConnect also noted possible links between the DC Leaks project and Russian intelligence operations because of a similarity with Fancy Bear attack patterns. SecureWorks added that the actor group was operating from Russia on behalf of the Russian government. de Volkskrant later reported that Dutch intelligence agency AIVD had penetrated the Russian hacking group Cozy Bear in 2014, and observed them in 2015 hack the State Department in real time, while capturing pictures of the hackers via a security camera in their workspace. American, British, and Dutch intelligence services had also observed stolen DNC emails on Russian military intelligence networks.  Intelligence reaction and indictment  On October 7, 2016, Secretary Johnson and Director Clapper issued a joint statement that the intelligence community is confident the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations, and that the disclosures of hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks are consistent with the Russian-directed efforts. In the July 2018 indictment by the Justice Department of twelve Russian GRU intelligence officials posing as \\"a Guccifer 2.0 persona\\" for conspiring to interfere in the 2016 elections was for hacking into computers of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee, state election boards, and secretaries of several states. The indictment describes \\"a sprawling and sustained cyberattack on at least three hundred people connected to the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign\\". The leaked stolen files were released \\"in stages,\\" a tactic wreaking \\"havoc on the Democratic Party throughout much of the election season.\\" One collection of data that hackers obtained and that may have become a \\"devastating weapon\\" against the Clinton campaign was the campaign's data analytics and voter-turnout models, extremely useful in targeting messages to \\"key constituencies\\" that Clinton needed to mobilize. These voters were later bombarded by Russian operatives with negative information about Clinton on social media.  WikiLeaks  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange In April 2017, CIA Director Mike Pompeo said WikiLeaks was a hostile intelligence agency aided by foreign states including Russia, and that the U.S. Intelligence Community concluded that Russia's \\"propaganda outlet,\\" RT, had conspired with WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks and its founder Julian AssangeAlex Johnson, \\"WikiLeaks' Julian Assange: 'No Proof' Hacked DNC Emails Came From Russia\\", NBC News (July 25, 2016). have made a number of statements denying that the Russian government was the source of the material. However, an anonymous CIA official said that Russian officials transferred the hacked e-mails to WikiLeaks using \\"a circuitous route\\" from Russia's military intelligence services (GRU) to WikiLeaks via third parties. In a leaked private message on Twitter, Assange wrote that in the 2016 election \\"it would be much better for GOP to win,\\" and that Hillary Clinton was a \\"sadistic sociopath\\".  Hacking of Congressional candidates  Hillary Clinton was not the only Democrat attacked. Caches of Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee documents stolen by \\"Guccifer 2.0\\" were also released to reporters and bloggers around the U.S. As one Democratic candidate put it, \\"Our entire internal strategy plan was made public, and suddenly all this material was out there and could be used against me.\\" The New York Times noted, \\"The seats that Guccifer 2.0 targeted in the document dumps were hardly random: They were some of the most competitive House races in the country.\\" = Hacking of Republicans = On January 10, 2017, FBI Director James Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee that Russia succeeded in \\"collecting some information from Republican-affiliated targets but did not leak it to the public\\". In earlier statements, an FBI official stated Russian attempts to access the RNC server were unsuccessful, or had reportedly told the RNC chair that their servers were secure, but that email accounts of individual Republicans (including Colin Powell) were breached. (Over 200 emails from Colin Powell were posted on the website DC Leaks.)cf. One state Republican Party (Illinois) may have had some of its email accounts hacked. = Civil DNC lawsuit against Russian Federation = On April 20, 2018, the Democratic National Committee filed a civil lawsuit in federal court in New York, accusing the Russian Government, the Trump campaign, WikiLeaks, and others of conspiracy to alter the course of the 2016 presidential election and asking for monetary damages and a declaration admitting guilt. The lawsuit was dismissed by the judge, because New York \\"does not recognize the specific tort claims pressed in the suit\\"; the judge did not make a finding on whether there was or was not \\"collusion between defendants and Russia during the 2016 presidential election\\". = Calls by Trump for Russians to hack Clinton's deleted emails = At a news conference on July 27, 2016, Trump publicly called on Russia to hack and release Hillary Clinton's deleted emails from her private server during her tenure in the State Department. Trump's comment was condemned by the press and political figures, including some Republicans; he replied that he had been speaking sarcastically. Several Democratic Senators said Trump's comments appeared to violate the Logan Act, and Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe added that Trump's call could be treasonous. The July 2018 federal indictment of Russian GRU agents said that the first attempt by Russian hackers to infiltrate the computer servers inside Clinton's offices took place on the same day (July 27, 2016) Trump made his \\"Russia if you're listening\\" appeal. While no direct link with Trump's remark was alleged in the indictment, journalist Jane Mayer called the timing \\"striking\\". Trump asserted in March 2019 that he had been joking when he made the remark. Katy Tur of NBC News had interviewed Trump immediately after the 2016 remark, noting she gave him an opportunity to characterize it as a joke, but he did not.  Targeting of important voting blocs and institutions  In her analysis of the Russian influence on the 2016 election, Kathleen Hall Jamieson argues that Russians aligned themselves with the \\"geographic and demographic objectives\\" of the Trump campaign, using trolls, social media and hacked information to target certain important constituencies. = Attempts to suppress African American votes and spread alienation = According to Vox, the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) focused on the culture of Muslims, Christians, Texas, and LGBTQ people, to engage those communities as part of a broader strategy to deepen social and political divisions within the U.S., but no other group received as much attention as Black Americans, whose voter turnout has been historically crucial to the election of Democrats. Russia's influence campaign used an array of tactics aiming to reduce their vote for Hillary Clinton, according to a December 2018 report (The Tactics & Tropes of the Internet Research Agency)The Tactics & Tropes of the Internet Research Agency. Ren√©e DiResta, Dr. Kris Shaffer, Becky Ruppel, David Sullivan, Robert Matney, Ryan Fox (New Knowledge); Dr. Jonathan Albright (Tow Center for Digital Journalism, Columbia University); Ben Johnson (Canfield Research, LLC commissioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee. A total 30 Facebook pages targeting Black Americans and 10 YouTube channels that posted 571 videos related to police violence against African-Americans. The covertly Russian Instagram account @blackstagram had more than 300,000 followers. A variety of Facebook pages targeting African Americans and later determined to be Russian amassed a total of 1.2 million individual followers, the report found. The Facebook page for (the Russian) Blacktivist, garnered more hits than Black Lives Matter's (non-Russian) Facebook page. Influence operations included recruiting typically unknowing assets who would stage events and spread content from Russian influencers, spreading videos of police abuse and spreading misleading information about how to vote and whom to vote for. = Arousing conservative voters = At least 25 social media pages drawing 1.4 million followers were created by Russian agents to target the American political right and promote the Trump candidacy. An example of the targeting was the adding of Blue Lives Matter material to social media platforms by Russian operatives after the Black Lives Matter movement moved to the center of public attention in the America and sparked a pro-police reaction. Jamieson noted there was reason to believe Donald Trump would under-perform among two normally dependable conservative Republican voting blocs‚Äîchurchgoing Christians and military service members and their families. It was thought pious Christians were put off by Trump's lifestyle as a Manhattan socialite, known for his three marriages and many affairs but not for any religious beliefs, who had boasted of groping women. Military personnel might lack enthusiasm for a candidate who avoided service in Vietnam but who described himself as a \\"brave soldier\\" in having to face his \\"personal Vietnam\\" of the threat of sexually transmitted diseases, and who mocked Gold Star parents and former prisoner of war John McCain. To overcome Trump's possible poor reputation among evangelicals and veterans, Russian trolls created memes that exploited typical conservative social attitudes about people of color, Muslims, and immigrants. One such meme juxtaposed photographs of a homeless veteran and an undocumented immigrant, alluding to the belief that undocumented immigrants receive special treatment. CNN exit polls showed that Trump led Clinton among veterans by 26 percentage points and won a higher percentage of the evangelical vote than either of the two previous Republican presidential nominees, indicating that this tactic may have succeeded.  Intrusions into state election systems  A 2019 report by the Senate Intelligence Committee found \\"an unprecedented level of activity against state election infrastructure\\" by Russian intelligence in 2016. The activity occurred in \\"all 50 states\\" and is thought by \\"many officials and experts\\" to have been \\"a trial run... to probe American defenses and identify weaknesses in the vast back-end apparatus‚Äîvoter-registration operations, state and local election databases, electronic poll books and other equipment\\" of state election systems. The report warned that the United States \\"remains vulnerable\\" in the 2020 election. Of \\"particular concern\\" to the committee report was the Russians' hacking of three companies \\"that provide states with the back-end systems that have increasingly replaced the thick binders of paper used to verify voters' identities and registration status.\\" = Intrusions into state voter-registration systems = During the summer and fall of 2016, Russian hackers intruded into voter databases and software systems in 39 different states, alarming Obama administration officials to the point that they took the unprecedented step of contacting Moscow directly via the Moscow‚ÄìWashington hotline and warning that the attacks risked setting off a broader conflict. As early as June 2016, the FBI sent a warning to states about \\"bad actors\\" probing state-elections systems to seek vulnerabilities.Tal Kopan, FBI director: Hackers 'poking around' voter systems, CNN (September 28, 2016). In September 2016, FBI Director James Comey testified before the House Judiciary Committee that the FBI was investigating Russian hackers attempting to disrupt the 2016 election and that federal investigators had detected hacker-related activities in state voter-registration databases,U.S. official: Hackers targeted voter registration systems of 20 states, Associated Press (September 30, 2016). which independent assessments determined were soft targets for hackers.Robert Windrem, William M. Arkin, and Ken Dilanian, Russians Hacked Two U.S. Voter Databases, Officials Say, NBC News (August 30, 2016). Comey stated there were multiple attempts to hack voter database registrations. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper attributed Russian hacking attempts to Vladimir Putin.Mike Levine & Pierre Thomas, Russian Hackers Targeted Nearly Half of States' Voter Registration Systems, Successfully Infiltrated 4, ABC News (September 29, 2016). In August 2016, the FBI issued a nationwide \\"flash alert\\" warning state election officials about hacking attempts. In September 2016, U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials and the National Association of Secretaries of State announced that hackers had penetrated, or sought to penetrate, the voter-registration systems in more than 20 states over the previous few months. Federal investigators attributed these attempts to Russian government-sponsored hackers, and specifically to Russian intelligence agencies. Four of the intrusions into voter registration databases were successful, including intrusions into the Illinois and Arizona databases. Although the hackers did not appear to change or manipulate data, Illinois officials said information on up to 200,000 registered voters was stolen. The FBI and DHS increased their election- security coordination efforts with state officials as a result. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson reported that 18 states had requested voting- system security assistance from DHS. The department also offered risk assessments to the states, but just four states expressed interest, as the election was rapidly approaching. The reports of the database intrusions prompted alarm from Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, who wrote to the FBI saying foreign attempts to cast doubt on free and fair elections was a danger to democracy not seen since the Cold War. On September 22, 2017, federal authorities notified the election officials of 21 states that their election systems had been targeted. \\"In most cases, states said they were told the systems were not breached.\\" Over a year after the initial warnings, this was the first official confirmation many state governments received that their states specifically had been targeted. Moreover, top elections officials of the states of Wisconsin and California have denied the federal claim. California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said, \\"California voters can further rest assured that the California Secretary of State elections infrastructure and websites were not hacked or breached by Russian cyber actors... Our notification from DHS last Friday was not only a year late, it also turned out to be bad information.\\" In May 2018, the Senate Intelligence Committee released its interim report on election security.Karoun Demirjian, Senate Intelligence Committee releases interim report on election security, Washington Post (May 8, 2018). The committee concluded, on a bipartisan basis, that the response of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to Russian government-sponsored efforts to undermine confidence in the U.S. voting process was \\"inadequate\\". The committee reported that the Russian government was able to penetrate election systems in at least 18, and possibly up to 21, states, and that in a smaller subset of states, infiltrators \\"could have altered or deleted voter registration data,\\" although they lacked the ability to manipulate individual votes or vote tallies. The committee wrote that the infiltrators' failure to exploit vulnerabilities in election systems could have been because they \\"decided against taking action\\" or because \\"they were merely gathering information and testing capabilities for a future attack\\". To prevent future infiltrations, the committee made a number of recommendations, including that \\"at a minimum, any machine purchased going forward should have a voter-verified paper trail and no WiFi capability\\".Russian Targeting of Election Infrastructure During the 2016 Election: Summary of Initial Findings and Recommendations, Senate Intelligence Committee, May 8, 2018.  Investigation into financial flows  By January 2017, a multi-agency investigation, conducted by the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, the Justice Department, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and representatives of the DNI, was underway looking into how the Russian government may have secretly financed efforts to help Trump win the election had been conducted over several months by six federal agencies. Investigations into Carter Page, Paul Manafort and Roger Stone were underway on January 19, the eve of the presidential inauguration. = Money funneled through the NRA = By January 2018, the FBI was investigating the possible funneling of illegal money by Aleksandr Torshin, a deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia, through the National Rifle Association, which was then used to help Donald Trump win the presidency. Torshin is known to have close connections both to Russia's president Vladimir Putin and to the NRA, and he has been charged with money laundering in other countries. The NRA reported spending $30 million to support the 2016 Trump campaign, three times what it spent on Mitt Romney in 2012, and spent more than any other independent group including the leading Trump superPAC. Sources with connections to the NRA have stated that the actual amount spent was much higher than $30 million. The subunits within the organization which made the donations are not generally required to disclose their donors. Spanish special prosecutor Jos√© Grinda Gonzalez has said that in early 2018 the Spanish police gave wiretapped audio to the FBI of telephone discussions between Torshin, and convicted money launderer and mafia boss Alexander Romanov. Torshin met with Donald Trump Jr. at an NRA event in May 2016 while attempting to broker a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. Maria Butina, a Russian anti-gun control activist who has served as a special assistant to Torshin and came to the U.S. on a student visa to attend university classes in Washington, claimed both before and after the election that she was part of the Trump campaign's communications with Russia. Like Torshin, she cultivated a close relationship with the NRA. In February 2016, Butina started a consulting business called Bridges LLC with Republican political operative Paul Erickson. During Trump's presidential campaign Erickson contacted Rick Dearborn, one of Trump's advisors, writing in an email that he had close ties both to the NRA and to Russia, and asking how a back-channel meeting between Trump and Putin could be set up. The email was later turned over to federal investigators as part of the inquiry into Russia's meddling in the presidential election. On July 15, 2018, Butina was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and charged with conspiring to act as an unregistered Russian agent who had attempted to create a backchannel of communications between American Republicans/conservatives and Russian officials by infiltrating the National Rifle Association, the National Prayer Breakfast, and conservative religious organizations. = Money from Russian oligarchs = As of April 2018, Mueller's investigators were examining whether Russian oligarchs directly or indirectly provided illegal cash donations to the Trump campaign and inauguration. Investigators were examining whether oligarchs invested in American companies or think tanks having political action committees connected to the campaign, as well as money funneled through American straw donors to the Trump campaign and inaugural fund. At least one oligarch, Viktor Vekselberg, was detained and his electronic devices searched as he arrived at a New York area airport on his private jet in early 2018. Vekselberg was questioned about hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments made to Michael Cohen after the election, through Columbus Nova, the American affiliate of Vekselberg's Renova Group. Another oligarch was also detained on a recent trip to the United States, but it is unclear if he was searched. Investigators have also asked a third oligarch who has not traveled to the United States to voluntarily provide documents and an interview.  Intelligence analysis and reports  = Non-U.S. intelligence = John O. Brennan, Assistant to the President for Counterterrorism and Homeland Security, in the Oval Office, January 4, 2010 In part because U.S. agencies cannot surveil U.S. citizens without a warrant, the U.S. was slow to recognize a pattern itself. From late 2015 until the summer of 2016, during routine surveillance of Russians, several countries discovered interactions between the Trump campaign and Moscow. The UK, Germany, Estonia, Poland, and Australia (and possibly the Netherlands and France) relayed their discoveries to the U.S. Because the materials were highly sensitive, GCHQ director Robert Hannigan contacted CIA director John O. Brennan directly to give him information. Concerned, Brennan gave classified briefings to U.S. Congress' \\"Gang of Eight\\" during late August and September 2016. Referring only to intelligence allies and not to specific sources, Brennan told the Gang of Eight he had received evidence that Russia might be trying to help Trump win the U.S. election. It was later revealed that the CIA had obtained intelligence from \\"sources inside the Russian government\\" that stated that Putin gave direct orders to disparage Clinton and help Trump. On May 23, 2017, Brennan stated to the House Intelligence Committee that Russia \\"brazenly interfered\\" in the 2016 U.S. elections. He said he first picked up on Russia's active meddling \\"last summer\\", and that he had on August 4, 2016, warned his counterpart at Russia's FSB intelligence agency, Alexander Bortnikov, against further interference. The first public U.S. government assertion of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election came in a joint statement on September 22, 2016, by Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrats on the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, respectively. = October 2016 ODNI / DHS joint statement = James R. Clapper At the Aspen security conference in summer 2016, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Vladimir Putin wanted to retaliate against perceived U.S. intervention in Russian affairs with the 2011‚Äì13 Russian protests and the ousting of Viktor Yanukovych in the 2014 Ukraine crisis. In July 2016, consensus grew within the CIA that Russia had hacked the DNC. In a joint statement on October 7, 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence expressed confidence that Russia had interfered in the presidential election by stealing emails from politicians and U.S. groups and publicizing the information. On December 2, intelligence sources told CNN they had gained confidence that Russia's efforts were aimed at helping Trump win the election. On October 7, the U.S. government formally accused Russia of hacking the DNC's computer networks to interfere in the 2016 presidential election with the help of organizations like WikiLeaks. The Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security claimed in their joint statement, \\"The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts.\\" This was corroborated by a report released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), in conjunction with the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA on January 6, 2017. = December 2016 CIA report = On December 9, the CIA told U.S. legislators the U.S. Intelligence Community had concluded, in a consensus view, that Russia conducted operations to assist Donald Trump in winning the presidency, stating that \\"individuals with connections to the Russian government\\", previously known to the intelligence community, had given WikiLeaks hacked emails from the DNC and John Podesta. The agencies further stated that Russia had hacked the RNC as well, but did not leak information obtained from there. These assessments were based on evidence obtained before the election. = FBI inquiries = FBI has been investigating the Russian government's attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election‚Äîincluding whether campaign associates of Donald Trump's were involved in Russia's efforts‚Äîsince July 31, 2016. Following the July 22 publication of a large number of emails by WikiLeaks, the FBI announced that it would investigate the theft of DNC emails. An earlier event investigated by the FBI was a May 2016 meeting between the Donald Trump campaign foreign policy advisor, George Papadopoulos, and Alexander Downer in a London wine bar, where Papadopoulos disclosed his inside knowledge of a large trove of Hillary Clinton emails that could potentially damage her campaign. Papadopoulos had gained this knowledge on March 14, 2016, when he held a meeting with Joseph Mifsud, who told Papadopoulos the Russians had \\"dirt\\" on Clinton in the form of thousands of stolen emails. This occurred before the hacking of the DNC computers had become public knowledge, and Papadopoulos later bragged \\"that the Trump campaign was aware the Russian government had dirt on Hillary Clinton\\". In February 2019, Michael Cohen implicated Trump before the U.S. Congress, writing that Trump had knowledge that Roger Stone was communicating with WikiLeaks about releasing emails stolen from the DNC in 2016. John Podesta later testified before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that in April 2016, the DNC did not know their computers had been hacked, leading Adam Schiff to state: \\"So if the campaign wasn't aware in April that the hacking had even occurred, the first campaign to be notified the Russians were in possession of stolen emails would have been the Trump campaign through Mr. Papadopoulos.\\" In June 2016, the FBI notified the Illinois Republican Party that some of its email accounts may have been hacked. In December 2016, an FBI official stated that Russian attempts to access the RNC server were unsuccessful. In an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News, RNC chair Reince Priebus stated they communicated with the FBI when they learned about the DNC hacks, and a review determined their servers were secure. On January 10, 2017, FBI Director James Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee that Russia succeeded in \\"collecting some information from Republican-affiliated targets but did not leak it to the public\\". On October 31, 2016, The New York Times said the FBI had been examining possible connections between the Trump campaign and Russia, but did not find any clear links. At the time, FBI officials thought Russia was motivated to undermine confidence in the U.S. political process rather than specifically support Trump. During a House Intelligence Committee hearing in early December, the CIA said it was certain of Russia's intent to help Trump. On December 16, 2016, CIA Director John O. Brennan sent a message to his staff saying he had spoken with FBI Director James Comey and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and that all agreed with the CIA's conclusion that Russia interfered in the presidential election with the motive of supporting Donald Trump's candidacy. On December 29, 2016, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released an unclassified report that gave new technical details regarding methods used by Russian intelligence services for affecting the U.S. election, government, political organizations and private sector.\\"Joint DHS, ODNI, FBI Statement on Russian Malicious Cyber Activity\\", FBI National Press Office (December 29, 2016). The report included malware samples and other technical details as evidence that the Russian government had hacked the Democratic National Committee. Alongside the report, DHS published Internet Protocol addresses, malware, and files used by Russian hackers. An article in the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung discussed the difficulty of proof in matters of cybersecurity. One analyst told the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung that U.S. intelligence services could be keeping some information secret to protect their sources and analysis methods. Clapper later said the classified version contained \\"a lot of the substantiation that could not be put in the [public] report\\". On March 20, 2017, during public testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, FBI director James Comey confirmed the existence of an FBI investigation into Russian interference and Russian links to the Trump campaign, including the question of whether there had been any coordination between the campaign and the Russians. He said the investigation began in July 2016. Comey made the unusual decision to reveal the ongoing investigation to Congress, citing benefit to the public good. On October 7, 2016, Secretary Johnson and Director Clapper issued a joint statement that the intelligence community is confident the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations, and that the disclosures of hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks are consistent with the Russian-directed efforts. The statement also noted that the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia to influence public opinion there. On December 29, 2016, DHS and FBI released a Joint Analysis Report (JAR) which further expands on that statement by providing details of the tools and infrastructure used by Russian intelligence services to compromise and exploit networks and infrastructure associated with the recent U.S. election, as well as a range of U.S. government, political and private sector entities. = January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment = On January 6, 2017, after briefing the president, the president-elect, and members of the Senate and House, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) released a de-classified version of the report on Russian activities. The intelligence community assessment (ICA), produced by the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, and the ODNI, asserted that Russia had carried out a massive cyber operation ordered by Russian President Putin with the goal to sabotage the 2016 U.S. elections. The agencies concluded that Putin and the Russian government tried to help Trump win the election by discrediting Hillary Clinton and portraying her negatively relative to Trump, and that Russia had conducted a multipronged cyber campaign consisting of hacking and the extensive use of social media and trolls, as well as open propaganda on Russian-controlled news platforms. The ICA contained no information about how the data was collected and provided no evidence underlying its conclusions. Clapper said the classified version contained substantiation that could not be made public. A large part of the ICA was dedicated to criticizing Russian TV channel RT America, which it described as a \\"messaging tool\\" for a \\"Kremlin-directed campaign to undermine faith in the U.S. Government and fuel political protest.\\" On March 5, 2017, James Clapper said, in an interview with Chuck Todd on Meet the Press that the January 2017 ICA did not have evidence of collusion, but that it might have become available after he left the government. He agreed with Todd that the \\"idea of collusion\\" was not proven at that time. On May 14, 2017, in an interview with George Stephanopoulos, Clapper explained more about the state of evidence for or against any collusion at the time of the January IC assessment, saying \\"there was no evidence of any collusion included in that report, that's not to say there wasn't evidence\\". He also stated he was also unaware of the existence of the formal investigation at that time. In November 2017, Clapper explained that at the time of the Stephanopoulos interview, he did not know about the efforts of George Papadopoulos to set up meetings between Trump associates and Kremlin officials, nor about the meeting at Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort and a Russian lawyer. In June 2017, E. W. Priestap, the assistant director of the FBI Counterintelligence Division, told the PBS Newshour program that Russian intelligence \\"used fake news and propaganda and they also used online amplifiers to spread the information to as many people as possible\\" during the election. = James Comey testimony = In testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8, former FBI Director James Comey said he had \\"no doubt\\" Russia interfered in the 2016 election and that the interference was a hostile act. Concerning the motives of his dismissal, Comey said, \\"I take the president at his word that I was fired because of the Russia investigation. Something about the way I was conducting it, the president felt, created pressure on him he wanted to relieve.\\" He also said that, while he was director, Trump was not under investigation.  U.S. government response  At least 17 distinct investigations were started to examine aspects of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. = U.S. Senate = Members of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee traveled to Ukraine and Poland in 2016 and learned about Russian operations to influence their elections. Senator McCain called for a special select committee of the U.S. Senate to investigate Russian meddling in the election, and called election meddling an \\"act of war\\". The Senate Intelligence Committee began work on its bipartisan inquiry in January 2017. In May, the committee voted unanimously to give both Chairmen solo subpoena power. Soon after, the committee issued a subpoena to the Trump campaign for all Russia-related documents, emails, and telephone records. In December, it was also looking at the presidential campaign of Green Party's Jill Stein for potential \\"collusion with the Russians\\". In May 2018, the Senate Intelligence Committee released the interim findings of their bipartisan investigation, finding that Russia interfered in the 2016 election with the goal of helping Trump gain the presidency, stating: \\"Our staff concluded that the [intelligence community's] conclusions were accurate and on point. The Russian effort was extensive, sophisticated, and ordered by President Putin himself for the purpose of helping Donald Trump and hurting Hillary Clinton.\\"Karoun Demirjian, Russia favored Trump in 2016, Senate panel says, breaking with House GOP, Washington Post (May 16, 2018). On January 10, 2018, Senator Ben Cardin of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee released, \\"Putin's Asymmetric Assault on Democracy in Russia and Europe: Implications for U.S. National Security.\\" The report said the interference in the 2016 United States elections was a part of Putin's \\"asymmetric assault on democracy\\" worldwide, including targeting elections in a number of countries, such as Britain, France and Germany, by \\"Moscow-sponsored hacking, internet trolling and financing for extremist political groups\\". 2018 committee reports The Senate Intelligence Committee commissioned two reports that extensively described the Russian campaign to influence social media during the 2016 election. Both were based largely on data provided by involved social media companies like Facebook and Twitter. One report (The Tactics & Tropes of the Internet Research Agency) was produced by the New Knowledge cybersecurity company aided by researchers at Columbia University and Canfield Research LLC. Another (The IRA, Social Media and Political Polarization in the United States, 2012-2018) by the Computational Propaganda Project of Oxford University along with the social media analysis company Graphika. The New Knowledge report highlighted \\"the energy and imagination\\" of the Russian effort to \\"sway American opinion and divide the country\\", and their focus on African-Americans. The report identified more than 263 million \\"engagements\\" (likes, comments, shares, etc.) with Internet Research Agency content and faulted U.S. social media companies for allowing their platforms to be co- opted for foreign propaganda\\".  2020 committee report  On April 21, 2020, the Senate Intelligence Committee released a unanimous, heavily redacted report reviewing the January 2017 intelligence community assessment on Russian interference. The committee felt that the assessment brought a \\"coherent and well-constructed intelligence basis for the case of unprecedented Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election\\", specifically that the interference was unprecedented in its \\"manner and aggressiveness\\". The Senate committee heard \\"specific intelligence reporting to support the assessment that Putin and the Russian Government demonstrated a preference for candidate Trump\\", and that Putin \\"approved and directed\\" the interference. The committee praised the assessment as an \\"impressive accomplishment\\", noting that the assessment \\"reflects proper analytic tradecraft\\" despite a limited timeframe. The committee also stated that \\"interviews with those who drafted and prepared the ICA affirmed that analysts were under no political pressure to reach specific conclusions.\\" A disagreement between the CIA and the NSA of the agencies' confidence level of Russia's preference for Trump \\"was reasonable, transparent, and openly debated among the agencies and analysts.\\" Additionally, the committee found that the Steele dossier was not used by the assessment to \\"support any of its analytic judgments\\". On August 17, 2020 the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee released the fifth and final volume of their 996-page report, ending one of the United States \\"highest-profile congressional inquiries.\\" The Committee report, which was based on three years of investigations, found that the Russian government had engaged in an \\"extensive campaign\\" to sabotage the election in favor of Trump, which included assistance from some members of Trump's own advisers. Volume 5 said the Trump administration had used \\"novel claims\\" of executive privilege to obstruct the inquiry. The report said that Trump's 2016 campaign staff were eager to accept Russia's help, however after the release of the report, acting Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Marco Rubio issued a statement stating the committee \\"found absolutely no evidence that then-candidate Donald Trump or his campaign colluded with the Russian government to meddle in the 2016 election.\\"https://www.newsweek.com/democratic-senator-says-he-fears-americans- are-unwittingly-spreading-russia- disinformation-1527012https://www.axios.com/warner-senate-intel-committee- russia-report-c0019f7a-bfe6-49b6-8889-8cdfea7086b0.html = U.S. House of Representatives = After bipartisan calls to action in December 2016, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence launched an investigation in January 2017 about Russian election meddling, including possible ties between Trump's campaign and Russia. The Senate Intelligence Committee launched its own parallel probe in January as well. Fifteen months later, in April 2018, the House Intelligence Committee's Republican majority released its final report, amid harsh criticism from Democratic members of the committee. The report found \\"no evidence\\" of collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. On February 24, 2017, Republican Congressman Darrell Issa called for a special prosecutor to investigate whether Russia meddled with the U.S. election and was in contact with Trump's team during the presidential campaign, saying it would be improper for Trump's appointee, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, to lead the investigation. In March 2017, Democratic ranking committee member Adam Schiff said there was sufficient evidence to warrant further investigation, and claimed to have seen \\"more than circumstantial evidence\\" of collusion. On April 6, 2017, Republican committee chairman Devin Nunes temporarily recused himself from the investigation after the House Ethics Committee announced that it would investigate accusations that he had disclosed classified information without authorization. He was replaced by Representative Mike Conaway. Nunes was cleared of wrongdoing on December 8, 2017 The committee's probe was shut down on March 12, 2018, acknowledging that Russians interfered in the 2016 elections through an active measures campaign promoting propaganda and fake news, but rejecting the conclusion of intelligence agencies that Russia had favored Trump in the election (although some Republican committee members distanced themselves from this assertion).Karoun Demirjian, Intel panel Republicans seem to back away from finding that Russia was not trying to help Trump, Washington Post (March 13, 2018). The committee's report did not find any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government's efforts; Conaway said they had uncovered only \\"perhaps some bad judgment, inappropriate meetings\\". Democrats on the committee objected to the Republicans' closure of the investigation and their refusal to press key witnesses for further testimony or documentation which might have further established complicity of the Trump campaign with Russia. Schiff issued a 21-page \\"status report\\" outlining plans to continue the investigation, including a list of additional witnesses to interview and documents to request. = Obama administration = President Obama ordered the United States Intelligence Community to investigate election hacking attempts since 2008. U.S. President Obama and Vladimir Putin had a discussion about computer security issues in September 2016, which took place over the course of an hour and a half. During the discussion, which took place as a side segment during the then-ongoing G20 summit in China, Obama made his views known on cyber security matters between the U.S. and Russia. Obama said Russian hacking stopped after his warning to Putin. One month after that discussion the email leaks from the DNC cyber attack had not ceased, and President Obama decided to contact Putin via the Moscow‚ÄìWashington hotline, commonly known as the red phone, on October 31, 2016. Obama emphasized the gravity of the situation by telling Putin: \\"International law, including the law for armed conflict, applies to actions in cyberspace.\\" On December 9, 2016, Obama ordered the U.S. Intelligence Community to investigate Russian interference in the election and report before he left office on January 20, 2017. U.S. Homeland Security Advisor and chief counterterrorism advisor to the president Lisa Monaco announced the study, and said foreign intrusion into a U.S. election was unprecedented and would necessitate investigation by subsequent administrations. The intelligence analysis would cover malicious cyberwarfare occurring between the 2008 and 2016 elections. A senior administration official said the White House was confident Russia interfered in the election.Elise Labott, \\"Official: Probe 'solely about lessons learned' on foreign hacking\\", CNN (December 10, 2016). The official said the order by President Obama would be a lessons learned report, with options including sanctions and covert cyber response against Russia. On December 12, 2016, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was critical of Trump's rejection of the conclusions of the U.S. Intelligence Community that Russia used cyberattacks to influence the election. United States Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on December 15, 2016, about President Obama's decision to approve the October 2016 joint statement by the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Obama said the U.S. government would respond to Russia via overt and covert methods, in order to send an unambiguous symbol to the world that any such interference would have harsh consequences in a December 15, 2016, interview by NPR journalist Steve Inskeep. He added that a motive behind the Russian operation could better be determined after completion of the intelligence report he ordered. Obama emphasized that Russian efforts caused more harm to Clinton than to Trump during the campaign. At a press conference the following day, he highlighted his September 2016 admonition to Putin to cease engaging in cyberwarfare against the U.S. Obama explained that the U.S. did not publicly reciprocate against Russia's actions due to a fear such choices would appear partisan. President Obama stressed cyber warfare against the U.S. should be a bipartisan issue. In the last days of the Obama administration, officials pushed as much raw intelligence as possible into analyses and attempted to keep reports at relatively low classification levels as part of an effort to widen their visibility across the federal government. The information was filed in many locations within federal agencies as a precaution against future concealment or destruction of evidence in the event of any investigation. = Punitive measures imposed on Russia = On December 29, 2016, the U.S. government announced a series of punitive measures against Russia. The Obama administration imposed sanctions on four top officials of the GRU and declared persona non grata 35 Russian diplomats suspected of spying; they were ordered to leave the country within 72 hours. On December 30, two waterfront compounds used as retreats by families of Russian embassy personnel were shut down on orders of the U.S. government, citing spying activities: one in Upper Brookville, New York, on Long Island, and the other in Centreville, Maryland, on the Eastern Shore.Mark Mazzetti & Michael S. Schmidt, \\"Two Russian Compounds, Caught Up in History's Echoes\\", The New York Times (December 29, 2016).Ian Duncan, \\"Shut down Russian Eastern Shore retreat offers glimpse at spy battles\\", The Baltimore Sun (December 30, 2016). Further sanctions against Russia were undertaken, both overt and covert. A White House statement said that cyberwarfare by Russia was geared to undermine U.S. trust in democracy and impact the election. President Obama said his decision was taken after previous warnings to Russia. In mid-July 2017, the Russian foreign ministry said the U.S. was refusing to issue visas to Russian diplomats to allow Moscow to replace the expelled personnel and get its embassy back up to full strength.Russia, mulling expulsions, says too many U.S. spies work in Moscow Reuters, June 14, 2017. Initially Putin refrained from retaliatory measures to the December 29 sanctions and invited all the children of the U.S. diplomats accredited in Russia to New Year's and Christmas celebrations at the Kremlin. He also said that steps for restoring Russian-American relations would be built on the basis of the policies developed by the Trump administration.\\"Plane with Russian diplomats expelled from US lands in Moscow\\". Russian News Agency TASS. January 2, 2017. Later in May 2017, Russian banker Andrey Kostin, an associate of President Vladimir Putin, accused \\"the Washington elite\\" of purposefully disrupting the presidency of Donald Trump.  Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act  German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized the CAATSA sanctions against Russia, targeting EU‚ÄìRussia energy projects. In June 2017, the Senate voted 98 to2 for a bill that had been initially drafted in January by a bipartisan group of senators over Russia's continued involvement in the wars in Ukraine and Syria and its meddling in the 2016 election that envisaged sanctions on Russia as well as Iran, and North Korea; the bill would expand the punitive measures previously imposed by executive orders and convert them into law.Senate overwhelmingly passes new Russia and Iran sanctions WP, June 15, 2017.Senate GOP, Dems agree on new sanctions on Russia AP, June 13, 2017. An identical bill, introduced by Democrats in the House in July,Democrats introduce new bill on Russia and Iran sanctions Reuters, July 12, 2017. passed 419 to3. The law forbids the president from lifting earlier sanctions without first consulting Congress, giving them time to reverse such a move. It targets Russia's defense industry by harming Russia's ability to export weapons, and allows the U.S. to sanction international companies that work to develop Russian energy resources. The proposed sanctions also caused harsh criticism and threats of retaliatory measure on the part of the European Union, Germany and France.\\"Germany's Angela Merkel slams planned US sanctions on Russia\\". Deutsche Welle. June 16, 2017.Europe 'stands ready to act' if US sanctions on Russia affect its oil and gas supplies The Independent, July 26, 2017. On January 29, 2018, the Trump administration notified Congress that it would not impose additional sanctions on Russia under 2017 legislation designed to punish Moscow's meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. The administration insisted that the mere threat of the sanctions outlined in the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act would serve as a deterrent, and that implementing the sanctions would therefore be unnecessary.  Counter- sanctions by Russia  On July 27, as the sanctions bill was being passed by the Senate, Putin pledged a response to \\"this kind of insolence towards our country\\".Putin: Russia promises retaliation as Senate passes sanctions bill The Guardian, July 28, 2017. Shortly thereafter, Russia's foreign ministry Sergey Lavrov demanded that the U.S. reduce its diplomatic and technical personnel in the Moscow embassy and its consulates in St Petersburg, Ekaterinburg and Vladivostok to 455 persons‚Äîthe same as the number of Russian diplomats posted in the U.S, and suspended the use of a retreat compound and a storage facility in Moscow. Putin said he had made this decision personally, and confirmed that 755 employees of the U.S. diplomatic mission must leave Russia.Putin confirms 755 US diplomatic staff must leave BBC, July 30, 2017.  Impact on election result  As of October 2018, the question of whether Donald Trump won the 2016 election because of the Russian interference had not been given much focus‚Äîbeing declared impossible to determine, or ignored in favor of other factors that led to Trump's victory. Joel Benenson, the Clinton campaign's pollster, said we probably will never know, while Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said \\"we cannot calculate the impact that foreign meddling and social media had on this election\\". Michael V. Hayden, a former director of the CIA and the NSA, believes that although the Russian attacks were \\"the most successful covert influence operation in history,\\" what impact they had is \\"not just unknown, it's unknowable.\\" Statistician Nate Silver, writing in February 2018, described himself as \\"fairly agnostic\\" on the question, but notes \\"thematically, the Russian interference tactics were consistent with the reasons Clinton lost.\\" Clinton supporters have been more likely to blame her defeat on campaign mistakes, Comey's reopening of the criminal investigation into her emails, or to direct attention to whether Trump colluded with Russia. Several high-level Republicans believe Russian interference did not determine the election's outcome, including those who would have benefited from Russia's efforts. President Trump has asserted that \\"the Russians had no impact on our votes whatsoever\\", and Vice President Pence has claimed \\"it is the universal conclusion of our intelligence communities that none of those efforts had any impact on the outcome of the 2016 election.\\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also said \\"the intelligence community's assessment is that the Russian meddling that took place did not affect the outcome of the election\\". In fact, the official intelligence assessment of January 2017 did not evaluate whether Russian activities had any impact on the election's outcome, and CIA spokesman Dean Boyd said Pompeo's remark was erroneous. Paul Ryan also claimed it is \\"clear\\" that the Russian interference \\"didn't have a material effect on our elections.\\" On the other hand, a number of former intelligence and law enforcement officials, at least one political scientist and one former U.S. president argue that Russian interference was decisive because of the sophistication of the Russian propaganda on social media, the hacking of Democratic Party emails and the timing of their public release, the small shift in voter support needed to achieve victory in the electoral college, and the relatively high number of undecided voters (who may be more readily influenced). James Clapper, the former director of National Intelligence, told Jane Mayer, \\"it stretches credulity to think the Russians didn't turn the election... I think the Russians had more to do with making Clinton lose than Trump did.\\" Ex-FBI agent, Clint Watts, writes that \\"without the Russian influence... I believe Trump would not have even been within striking distance of Clinton on Election Day.\\" Former president Jimmy Carter has publicly said he believes Trump would not have gotten elected without the Russian interference. Carter believes \\"that Trump didn't actually win the election in 2016. He lost the election, and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf.\\" When questioned, he agreed that Trump is an \\"illegitimate president\\". Three states where Trump won by very close margins‚Äîmargins significantly less than the number of votes cast for third party candidates in those states‚Äîgave him an electoral college majority. Mayer writes that if only 12% of these third-party voters \\"were persuaded by Russian propaganda‚Äîbased on hacked Clinton-campaign analytics‚Äînot to vote for Clinton\\", this would have been enough to win the election for Trump. Political scientist Kathleen Hall Jamieson, in a detailed forensic analysis concludes that Russian trolls and hackers persuaded enough Americans \\"to either vote a certain way or not vote at all\\", thus impacting election results. Specifically, Jamieson argues that two events that caused a drop in intention to vote for Clinton reported to pollsters can be traced to Russian work: the publicizing of excerpts of speeches by Clinton made to investment banks for high fees stolen from campaign emails during the presidential debates, and the effect of Russian disinformation on FBI head Comey's public denunciation of Clinton's actions as \\"extremely careless\\" (see above).  2017 developments  = Dismissal of FBI Director James Comey = On May 9, 2017, Trump dismissed Comey, attributing his action to recommendations from United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Trump had been talking to aides about firing Comey for at least a week before acting, and had asked Justice Department officials to come up with a rationale for dismissing him. After he learned that Trump was about to fire Comey, Rosenstein submitted to Trump a memo critical of Comey's conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton's emails. Trump later confirmed that he had intended to fire Comey regardless of any Justice Department recommendation. Trump himself also tied the firing to the Russia investigation in a televised interview, stating, \\"When I decided to [fire Comey], I said to myself, I said, 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won. The dismissal came as a surprise to Comey and most of Washington, and was described as immediately controversial and having \\"vast political ramifications\\" because of the Bureau's ongoing investigation into Russian activities in the 2016 election. It was compared to the Saturday Night Massacre, President Richard Nixon's termination of special prosecutor Archibald Cox, who had been investigating the Watergate scandal, and to the dismissal of Sally Yates in January 2017. Comey himself stated \\"It's my judgment that I was fired because of the Russia investigation. I was fired in some way to change, or the endeavor was to change, the way the Russia investigation was being conducted.\\" During a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on May 10, 2017, in the Oval Office, Trump told the Russian officials that firing the F.B.I. director, James Comey, had relieved \\"great pressure\\" on him, according to a White House document. Trump stated, \\"I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job... I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off.\\" In 2019, The Washington Post revealed that Trump also told Lavrov and Kislyak during this meeting that he wasn't concerned about Russia interfering in American elections. = Investigation by special counsel = Special counsel Robert Mueller directed the FBI from 2001 to 2013. On May 17, 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to direct FBI agents and Department of Justice prosecutors investigating election interference by Russia and related matters. As special counsel, Mueller has the power to issue subpoenas, hire staff members, request funding, and prosecute federal crimes in connection with his investigation. Mueller assembled a legal team. Trump engaged several attorneys to represent and advise him, including his longtime personal attorney Marc Kasowitz as well as Jay Sekulow, Michael Bowe, and John M. Dowd. All but Sekulow have since resigned. In August 2017 Mueller was using a grand jury. = 2017 charges = In October 2017 Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty earlier in the month to making a false statement to FBI investigators about his connections to Russia. In the first guilty plea of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, George Papadopoulos admitted lying to the FBI about contact with Russian agents who offered the campaign \\"thousands\\" of damaging emails about Clinton months before then candidate Donald Trump asked Russia to \\"find\\" Hillary Clinton's missing emails. His plea agreement said a Russian operative had told a campaign aide \\"the Russians had emails of Clinton\\". Papadopoulos agreed to cooperate with prosecutors as part of the plea bargain. Later that month, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort surrendered to the FBI after being indicted on multiple charges. His business associate Rick Gates was also indicted and surrendered to the FBI. The pair were indicted on one count of conspiracy against the United States, one count of conspiracy to launder money, one count of being an unregistered agent of a foreign principal, one count of making false and misleading FARA statements, and one count of making false statements. Manafort was charged with four counts of failing to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts while Gates was charged with three. All charges arise from their consulting work for a pro- Russian government in Ukraine and are unrelated to the campaign. It was widely believed that the charges against Manafort are intended to pressure him into becoming a cooperating witness about Russian interference in the 2016 election. In February 2018, Gates pleaded guilty to fraud-related charges and agreed to testify against Manafort. In April 2018, when Manafort's lawyers filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the July 26 raid on Manafort's home, the warrants for the search were revealed and indicated that, in addition to seeking evidence related to Manafort's work in Ukraine, Mueller's investigation also concerned Manafort's actions during the Trump campaign including the meeting with a Russian lawyer and a counterintelligence officer at the Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016. In March 2018 the investigation revealed that the prosecutors have established links between Rick Gates and an individual with ties to Russian intelligence which occurred while Gates worked on Trump's campaign. A report filed by prosecutors, concerning the sentencing of Gates and Manafort associate Alex van der Zwaan who lied to Mueller's investigators, alleges that Gates knew the individual he was in contact with had these connections.  2018 developments  = 2018 indictments = On February 16, 2018, a Federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities on charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, and fraud with identification documents, in connection with the 2016 United States national elections. The 37-page indictment cites the illegal use of social media \\"to sow political discord, including actions that supported the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump and disparaged his opponent, Hillary Clinton.\\"Indictment, United States v.

Retrieved March 19, 2020. Twelve Russians were indicted for hacking. Press conference, July 13, 2018. On July 13, 2018, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein released indictments returned by a grand jury charging twelve Russian intelligence officials, who work for the Russian intelligence agency GRU, with conspiring to interfere in the 2016 elections. The individuals, posing as \\"a Guccifer 2.0 persona\\" are accused of hacking into computers of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, as well as state election boards and secretaries of several states. In one unidentified state, the Russians stole information on half a million voters. The indictment also said a Republican congressional candidate, also unidentified, had been sent campaign documents stolen by the group, and that a reporter was in contact with the Russian operatives and offered to write an article to coincide with the release of the stolen documents. = Claims by Anastasia Vashukevich = In March 2018, Anastasia Vashukevich, a Belarusian national arrested in Thailand, said she had over 16 hours of audio recordings that could shed light on possible Russian interference in American elections. She offered the recordings to American authorities in exchange for asylum, to avoid being extradited to Belarus. Vashukevich said she was close to Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch with ties to Putin and business links to Paul Manafort, and asserted the recordings included Deripaska discussing the 2016 presidential election. She said some of the recorded conversations, which she asserted were made in August 2016, included three individuals who spoke fluent English and who she believed were Americans. Vashukevich's claims appeared to be consistent with a video published in February 2018 by Alexei Navalny, about a meeting between Deripaska and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Eduardovich Prikhodko. In the video, Navalny claims Deripaska served as a liaison between the Russian government and Paul Manafort in connection with Russian interference efforts. In August 2018, Vashukevich said she no longer has any evidence having sent the recordings to Deripaska without having made them public, hoping he would be able to gain her release from prison, and has promised Deripaska not to make any further comment on the recordings' contents.  2019 developments  The Mueller Report (redacted) On March 24, Attorney General Barr sent a four-page letter to Congress regarding the Special Counsel's findings regarding Russian interference and obstruction of justice. Barr said that on the question of Russian interference in the election, Mueller detailed two ways in which Russia attempted to influence the election in Trump's favor, but \\"did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\\" On the question of obstruction of justice, Barr said that Mueller wrote \\"while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\\" \\"The Special Counsel's decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it 'to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime... Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufÔ¨Åcient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\\"The Attorney General Office letter to the House Judiciary Committee on March 24, 2019. https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/AG%20March%2024%202019%20Letter%20to%20House%20and%20Senate%20Judiciary%20Committees.pdf On April 18, 2019, a redacted version of the final Mueller Report was released to the public. The Mueller Report found that the Russian government interfered in the election in \\"sweeping and systematic fashion\\" and violated U.S. criminal laws. On May 29, 2019, Mueller announced that he was retiring as special counsel and the office would be shut down, and he spoke publicly about the report for the first time. He reiterated that his report did not exonerate the president and that legal guidelines prevented the indictment of a sitting president, stating that \\"the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.\\" Saying, \\"The report is my testimony,\\" he indicated he would have nothing to say that was not already in the report. He emphasized that the central conclusion of his investigation was \\"that there were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election. That allegation deserves the attention of every American.\\" Soon after the release of the Mueller Report, Trump began urging an investigation into the origins of the Russian investigation, wanting to \\"investigate the investigators\\". In April 2019, Attorney General William Barr announced that he had launched a review of the origins of the FBI's investigation. The origins of the probe were already being investigated by the Justice Department's inspector general and by U.S. attorney John Huber, who was appointed in 2018 by Jeff Sessions. He assigned U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead it. Durham was given the authority \\"to broadly examin[e] the government's collection of intelligence involving the Trump campaign's interactions with Russians,\\" reviewing government documents and requesting voluntary witness statements. Trump directed the American intelligence community to \\"promptly provide assistance and information\\" to Barr, and delegated to him the \\"full and complete authority\\" to declassify any documents related to his probe. In September 2019, it was reported that Barr has been contacting foreign governments to ask for help in this mission. He personally traveled to the United Kingdom and Italy to seek information, and at Barr's request Trump phoned the prime minister of Australia about the subject.  Links between Trump associates and Russian officials  During the course of the 2016 presidential campaign and up to his inauguration, Donald J. Trump and at least 17 campaign officials and advisers had numerous contacts with Russian nationals, with WikiLeaks, or with intermediaries between the two. As of January 28, The New York Times had tallied more than a hundred in-person meetings, phone calls, text messages, emails and private messages on Twitter between the Trump Campaign and Russians or WikiLeaks. In spring of 2015, U.S. intelligence agencies started overhearing conversations in which Russian government officials discussed associates of Donald Trump. British and the Dutch intelligence have given information to United States intelligence about meetings in European cities between Russian officials, associates of Putin, and associates of then-President-elect Trump. American intelligence agencies also intercepted communications of Russian officials, some of them within the Kremlin, discussing contacts with Trump associates. Multiple Trump associates were reported to have had contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials during 2016, although in February 2017 U.S. officials said they did not have evidence that Trump's campaign had co-operated with the Russians to influence the election. , the FBI was investigating Russian involvement in the election, including alleged links between Trump's associates and the Russian government. Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak met with a number of U.S. officials. In particular, Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak has met several Trump campaign members and administration nominees; the people involved have dismissed those meetings as routine conversations in preparation for assuming the presidency. Trump's team has issued at least twenty denials concerning communications between his campaign and Russian officials; several of these denials turned out to be false. In the early months of 2017, Trump and other senior White House officials asked the Director of National Intelligence, the NSA director, the FBI director, and two chairs of congressional committees to publicly dispute the news reports about contacts between Trump associates and Russia. = Paul Manafort = Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort had several contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials during 2016, which he denied. Intercepted communications during the campaign show that Russian officials believed they could use Manafort to influence Trump. The Mueller investigation and the Senate Intelligence Committee found that, as Trump's campaign manager in August 2016, Manafort shared Trump campaign internal polling data with Ukrainian political consultant Konstantin Kilimnik, whom the Mueller Report linked to Russian intelligence, while the Intelligence Committee characterized him as a \\"Russian intelligence officer.\\" Manafort gave Kilimnik data for Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, states the Russian Internet Research Agency specifically targeted for social media and ad campaigns. Trump won those three states by narrow margins and they were key to his election. In 2017 Manafort was indicted in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on various charges arising from his consulting work for the pro-Russian government of Viktor Yanukovych in Ukraine before Yanukovych's overthrow in 2014, as well as in the Eastern District of Virginia for eight charges of tax and bank fraud. He was convicted of the fraud charges in August 2019 and sentenced to 47 months in prison by Judge T.S. Ellis. Although all the 2017 charges arose from the Special Counsel investigation, none of them were for any alleged collusion to interfere with U.S. elections. = Michael Flynn = In December 2015, retired Army general Michael Flynn was photographed at a dinner seated next to Vladimir Putin. He was in Moscow to give a paid speech which he failed to disclose as is required of former high- ranking military officers. Also seated at the head table are Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein and members of Putin's inner circle, including Sergei Ivanov, Dmitry Peskov, Vekselberg, and Alexey Gromov. In February 2016, Flynn was named as an advisor to Trump's presidential campaign. Later that year, in phone calls intercepted by U.S. intelligence, Russian officials were overheard claiming they had formed a strong relationship with Trump advisor Flynn and believed they would be able to use him to influence Trump and his team. In December 2016 Flynn, then Trump's designated choice to be National Security Advisor, and Jared Kushner met with Russian ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak and requested him to set up a direct, encrypted line of communication so they could communicate directly with the Kremlin without the knowledge of American intelligence agencies. Three anonymous sources claimed that no such channel was actually set up. On December 29, 2016, the day President Obama announced sanctions against Russia, Flynn discussed the sanctions with Kislyak, urging that Russia not retaliate. Flynn initially denied speaking to Kislyak, then acknowledged the conversation but denied discussing the sanctions. When it was revealed in February 2017 that U.S. intelligence agencies had evidence, through monitoring of the ambassador's communications, that he actually had discussed the sanctions, Flynn said he couldn't remember if he did or not. Upon Trump's inauguration on January 20, 2017, he appointed Flynn his National Security Advisor. On January 24, Flynn was interviewed by the FBI. Two days later, acting Attorney General Sally Yates informed the White House that Flynn was \\"compromised\\" by the Russians and possibly open to blackmail. Flynn was forced to resign as national security advisor on February 13, 2017. On December 1, 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to a single felony count of making \\"false, fictitious and fraudulent statements\\" to the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak. His plea was part of a plea bargain with special counsel Robert Mueller, under which Flynn also agreed to cooperate with Mueller's investigation. On January 31, 2018, Mueller filed for and was granted a delay in Flynn's sentencing due to the status of the Russia investigation. On May 1, 2018, Mueller asked for a second delay in sentencing, requesting at least another two months. On July 10, Flynn's sentencing was again delayed, until at least late October. = George Papadopoulos = In March 2016 Donald Trump named George Papadopoulos, an oil, gas, and policy consultant, as an unpaid foreign policy advisor to his campaign. Shortly thereafter Papadopoulos was approached by Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor with connections to high-ranking Russian officials. Mifsud told him the Russians had \\"dirt\\" on Hillary Clinton in the form of \\"thousands of emails\\" \\"apparently stolen in an effort to try to damage her campaign\\". The two met several times in March 2016. In May 2016 at a London wine bar, Papadopoulos told the top Australian diplomat to the United Kingdom, Alexander Downer, that Russia \\"had a dirt file on rival candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of hacked Democratic Party emails\\". After the DNC emails were published by WikiLeaks in July, the Australian government told the FBI about Papadopoulos' revelation, leading the FBI to launch a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign, known by its code name: Crossfire Hurricane, which has been criticized by Trump as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Papadopoulos' main activity during the campaign was attempting, unsuccessfully, to set up meetings between Russian officials (including Vladimir Putin) and Trump campaign officials (including Trump himself). In pursuit of this goal he communicated with multiple Trump campaign officials including Sam Clovis, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, and Corey Lewandowski. On January 27, 2017, Papadopoulos was interviewed by FBI agents. On July 27, he was arrested at Washington-Dulles International Airport, and he has since been cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation. On October 5, 2017, he pleaded guilty to one felony count of making false statements to FBI agents relating to contacts he had with agents of the Russian government while working for the Trump campaign. Papadopoulos's arrest and guilty plea became public on October 30, 2017, when court documents showing the guilty plea were unsealed. Papadopoulos was sentenced to 14 days in prison, 12 months supervised release, 200 hours of community service and was fined $9,500, on September 7, 2018. = Veselnitskaya meeting = In June 2016, Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner met with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, who was accompanied by some others, including Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, after Trump Jr. was informed that Veselnitskaya could supply the Trump campaign with incriminating information about Hillary Clinton such as her dealings with the Russians. The meeting was arranged following an email from British music publicist Rob Goldstone who was the manager of Emin Agalarov, son of Russian tycoon Aras Agalarov. In the email, Goldstone said the information had come from the Russian government and \\"was part of a Russian government effort to help Donald Trump's presidential campaign\\". Trump Jr. replied with an e-mail saying \\"If it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer\\" and arranged the meeting. Trump Jr. went to the meeting expecting to receive information harmful to the Clinton campaign, but he said none was forthcoming, and instead the conversation then turned to the Magnitsky Act and the adoption of Russian children. The meeting was disclosed by The New York Times on July 8, 2017. On the same day, Donald Trump Jr. released a statement saying it had been a short introductory meeting focused on adoption of Russian children by Americans and \\"not a campaign issue\\". Later that month The Washington Post revealed that Trump Jr.'s statement had been dictated by President Donald Trump, who had overruled his staff's recommendation that the statement be transparent about the actual motivation for the meeting: the Russian government's wish to help Trump's campaign. = Other Trump associates = Attorney General Jeff Sessions talked with the Russian ambassador during the Trump campaign and recused himself from the investigation. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, an early and prominent supporter of Trump's campaign, spoke twice with Russian ambassador Kislyak before the election‚Äîonce in July 2016 at the Republican convention and once in September 2016 in Sessions' Senate office. In his confirmation hearings, Sessions testified that he \\"did not have communications with the Russians\\". On March 2, 2017, after this denial was revealed to have been false, Sessions recused himself from matters relating to Russia's election interference and deferred to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Roger Stone, a former adviser to Donald Trump and business partner of Paul Manafort, said he had been in contact with Guccifer 2.0, a hacker persona believed to be a front for Russian intelligence operations, who had publicly claimed responsibility for at least one hack of the DNC. During the campaign, Stone had stated repeatedly and publicly that he had \\"actually communicated with Julian Assange\\"; he later denied having done so. In August 2016, Stone had cryptically tweeted \\"Trust me, it will soon the Podesta's time in the barrel\\" shortly after claiming to have been in contact with WikiLeaks and before WikiLeaks' release of the Podesta emails. Stone has denied having any advance knowledge of the Podesta e-mail hack or any connection to Russian intelligence, stating that his earlier tweet was actually referring to reports of the Podesta Group's own ties to Russia. Stone ultimately named Randy Credico, who had interviewed both Assange and Stone for a radio show, as his intermediary with Assange. In June 2018 Stone disclosed that he had met with a Russian individual during the campaign, who wanted Trump to pay two million dollars for \\"dirt on Hillary Clinton\\". This disclosure contradicted Stone's earlier claims that he had not met with any Russians during the campaign. The meeting Stone attended was set up by Donald Trump's campaign aide, Michael Caputo and is a subject of Robert Mueller's investigation. Oil industry consultant Carter Page had his communications monitored by the FBI under a FISA warrant beginning in 2014, and again beginning in October 2016, after he was suspected of acting as an agent for Russia. Page told The Washington Post he considered that to be \\"unjustified, politically motivated government surveillance\\". Page spoke with Kislyak during the 2016 Republican National Convention, acting as a foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump. In 2013 he had met with Viktor Podobnyy, then a junior attach√© at the Russian Permanent Mission to the United Nations, at an energy conference, and provided him with documents on the U.S. energy industry. Podobnyy was later charged with spying, but was protected from prosecution by diplomatic immunity.Adam Goldman, \\"Russian Spies Tried to Recruit Carter Page Before He Advised Trump\\", The New York Times (April 4, 2017). The FBI interviewed Page in 2013 as part of an investigation into Podonyy's spy ring, but never accused Page of wrongdoing. The Mueller Report also found that Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (MbZ) approached Richard Gerson, a financier and Jared Kushner's friend, to arrange his meetings with Trump. A Russian businessman Kirill Dmitriev, who was close to Vladimir Putin and Blackwater founder Erik Prince, discussed a \\"reconciliation plan\\" with Gerson for the U.S. and Russia, which was later shared with Kushner. MbZ also advised Trump on the dangers of Iran and about Palestinian peace talks. On January 11, 2017, UAE officials organized a meeting in the Seychelles between Prince and Dmitriev. They discussed a back channel between Trump and Putin along with Middle East policy, notably about Syria and Iran. U.S. officials said the FBI was investigating the meeting.Adam Entous, Greg Miller, Kevin Sieff & Karen DeYoung, \\"Blackwater founder held secret Seychelles meeting to establish Trump-Putin back channel\\", The Washington Post (April 3, 2016). Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor, failed to disclose meetings with Russian officials. Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor, Jared Kushner, on his application for top secret security clearance, failed to disclose numerous meetings with foreign officials, including Ambassador Kislyak and Sergei Gorkov, the head of the Russian state-owned bank Vnesheconombank. Kushner's lawyers called the omissions \\"an error\\". Vnesheconombank has said the meeting was business-related, in connection with Kushner's management of Kushner Companies. However, the Trump administration provided a different explanation, saying it was a diplomatic meeting. On May 30, 2017, the House and Senate congressional panels both asked President Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen to \\"provide information and testimony\\" about any communications Cohen had with people connected to the Kremlin. Cohen had attempted to contact Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov during the 2016 campaign, asking for help in advancing plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow. In May 2017 longtime Republican operative Peter W. Smith confirmed to The Wall Street Journal that during the 2016 campaign he had been actively involved in trying to obtain emails he believed had been hacked from Hillary Clinton's computer server. In that quest he contacted several known hacker groups, including some Russian groups. He claimed he was working on behalf of Trump campaign advisor (later national security advisor) Michael Flynn and Flynn's son. At around the same time, there were intelligence reports that Russian hackers were trying to obtain Clinton's emails to pass to Flynn through an unnamed intermediary. Five of the hacker groups Smith contacted, including at least two Russian groups, claimed to have Clinton's emails. He was shown some information but was not convinced it was genuine, and suggested the hackers give it to WikiLeaks instead. A document describing Smith's plans claimed that Flynn, Kellyanne Conway, Steve Bannon, and other campaign advisors were coordinating with him \\"to the extent permitted as an independent expenditure\\". The White House, a campaign official, Conway, and Bannon all denied any connection with Smith's effort. British blogger Matt Tait said Smith had contacted him‚Äîcuriously, around the same time Trump called for the Russians to get Hillary Clinton's missing emails‚Äîto ask him to help authenticate any materials that might be forthcoming. Ten days after his interview with The Wall Street Journal, Smith committed suicide in a Minnesota hotel room, citing declining health.  Steele dossier  In June 2016, Christopher Steele, a former MI6 agent, was hired by Fusion GPS to produce opposition research on Donald Trump. In October 2015, before Steele was hired, Trump's republican political opponents had hired Fusion GPS to do opposition research on Trump. When they stopped their funding, Fusion GPS hired Steele to continue that research, but with more focus on Trump's Russian connections. In the beginning, he did not know the identities of Fusion GPS's ultimate clients, which were the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign. His reports, based on information provided by his witting and unwitting Russian sources and sources close to the Trump campaign, included alleged kompromat that may make Trump vulnerable to blackmail from Russia. In October 2016, a 33-page compilation was shared with Mother Jones magazine, which described some of its contents, but other mainstream media would not report on it because they could not confirm the material's credibility. In December 2016, two more pages were added alleging efforts by Trump's lawyer to pay those who had hacked the DNC and arranging to cover up any evidence of their deeds. On January 5, 2017, U.S. intelligence agencies briefed President Obama and President-elect Trump on the existence of these documents. Eventually, the dossier was published in full by BuzzFeed on January 10. In October 2016, the FBI used the dossier as part of its justification to obtain a FISA warrant to resume monitoring of former Trump foreign policy advisor Carter Page. However, officials would not say exactly what or how much of the dossier was actually corroborated.  Commentary and reactions  = Public opinion = Polls conducted in early January 2017 showed that 55% of respondents believed Russia interfered in the election; 51% believed Russia intervened through hacking. public-opinion polls showed a partisan split on the importance of Russia's involvement in the 2016 election. At that time, however, the broader issue of the Trump administration's relationship with Russia didn't even register among the most important problems facing the U.S. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 53 percent wanted a Congressional inquiry into communications in 2016 between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Quinnipiac University found that 47 percent thought it was very important. A March 2017 poll conducted by the Associated Press and NORC found about 62% of respondents say they are at least moderately concerned about the possibility that Trump or his campaign had inappropriate contacts with Russia during the 2016 campaign. A January 2017 poll conducted by the Levada Center, Russia's largest independent polling organization, showed that only 12% of Russian respondents believed Russia \\"definitely\\" or \\"probably\\" interfered in the U.S. election. A December 2017 survey conducted by the Levada Center found that 31% of Russian respondents thought their government tried to influence U.S. domestic affairs in a significant way.\\"More Russians are sure of the U.S. meddling in their politics than the other way around, poll finds\\". The Washington Post. February 7, 2018. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in late March and early April 2017 found that 68% of voters supported \\"an independent commission investigating the potential links between some of Donald Trump's campaign advisors and the Russian government\\". An April 2017 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that respondents had little confidence in Congress's investigation into the Russian interference in the election. The poll found that approximately 73% supported a \\"nonpartisan, independent commission\\" to look into Russia's involvement in the election. An ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted in April 2017 found that 56 percent of respondents thought Russia tried to influence the election. A May 2017 Monmouth University poll, conducted after the dismissal of James Comey, found that \\"nearly 6-in-10 Americans thought it was either very (40%) or somewhat (19%) likely that Comey was fired in order to slow down or stop the FBI investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible links with the Trump campaign.\\" Like other recent opinion polls, a majority, 73%, said that the FBI investigation should continue. A June 2017 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that respondents were more likely to believe James Comey over Trump when it came to their differing accounts behind the reasons for Comey's dismissal. The survey found that 45% of respondents were more likely to believe Comey than Trump. The poll also found that the number of respondents disapproving of Trump's decision to fire Comey- 46%- was higher than when the same question was asked in May of the same year. 53% of respondents said that they believed that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election, however the number changes by party affiliation. 78% of Democrats said that they believed there was interference, versus 26% of Republicans who agreed. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College poll conducted in late June 2017 found that 54% of respondents believed that Trump either did \\"something illegal\\" or \\"something unethical, but not illegal\\" in his dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The poll found that 73% of Republicans said Trump himself has done \\"nothing wrong\\" while 41% of Democrats believed that Trump did something that was illegal. In addition, 47% said that they thought Russia was a major threat to future U.S. elections, while 13% of respondents said that Russia posed no threat at all. A July 2017 ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 63% of respondents said that it \\"was inappropriate for Trump's son, son-in-law and campaign manager to have met with a Russian lawyer during the campaign.\\" The poll also found that six in ten overall who think that Russia tried to influence the election, with 72% saying that they thought that Trump benefited and that \\"67 percent thought that members of his campaign intentionally helped those efforts.\\" Polls conducted in August 2017 found widespread disapproval and distrust of Trump's handling of the investigation. A CNN/SSRS poll conducted in early August found that only 31% of respondents approved of Trump's handling of the matter. The poll also noted that 60% of adults \\"thought that it was a serious matter that should be fully investigated.\\" On party lines, the poll found that 15% of Democrats and 56% of Republicans approved of Trump's handling of the matter. A Gallup poll from the same month found similar trends. The poll found that 25% of respondents said Trump acted illegally in dealings with the Russians. The poll found that 6% of Republicans and Republican-leaners thought Trump did something illegal in his dealings with the Russians. A poll conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 58% of respondents expressed a negative view of Russia, while 25% had a favorable view of the country. The poll also found that 48% believed \\"there is clear evidence that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help the Trump campaign.\\" The broader issue of the Trump administration's relationship with Russia, however, was not identified by more than one percent of respondents in Gallup tracking of 'Most Important Problem' at any point since February 2017. (As of July 2018, it was less than half a percent.) = Hillary Clinton = Hillary Clinton said Vladimir Putin held a grudge against her due to her criticism of the 2011 Russian legislative election. On December 15, 2016, Hillary Clinton said she partially attributed her loss in the 2016 election to Russian meddling organized by Putin. Clinton said Putin had a personal grudge against her, and linked his feelings to her criticism of the 2011 Russian legislative election, adding that he felt she was responsible for fomenting the 2011‚Äì13 Russian protests. She drew a specific connection from her 2011 assertions as U.S. Secretary of State that Putin rigged the elections that year, to his actions in the 2016 U.S. elections. During the third debate, Clinton stated that Putin favored Trump, \\"because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States\\". Clinton said that by personally attacking her through meddling in the election, Putin additionally took a strike at the American democratic system. She said the cyber attacks were a larger issue than the effect on her own candidacy and called them an attempt to attack the national security of the United States. Clinton noted she was unsuccessful in sufficiently publicizing to the media the cyber attacks against her campaign in the months leading up to the election. She voiced her support for a proposal put forth by Senators from both parties, to set up an investigative panel to look into the matter akin to the 9/11 Commission. = Republican National Committee = Chief of staff-designate for Trump and outgoing RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in December 2016 that he still didn't know who hacked the DNC's computer servers. The RNC said there was no intrusion into its servers, while acknowledging email accounts of individual Republicans (including Colin Powell) were breached. More than 200 emails from Colin Powell were posted on the website DC Leaks. Priebus appeared on Meet the Press on December 11, 2016, and discounted the CIA conclusions. Priebus said the FBI had investigated and found that RNC servers had not been hacked. = Donald Trump = transition team dismissed the U.S. Intelligence community conclusions. Trump and Putin answer questions from journalists on July 16, 2018. Video from the White House. Prior to his presidential run, Donald Trump made statements to Fox News in 2014 in which he agreed with an assessment by then FBI director James Comey about hacking against the U.S. by Russia and China. Trump was played a clip of Comey from 60 Minutes discussing the dangers of cyber attacks. Trump stated he agreed with the problem of cyber threats posed by China, and went on to emphasize there was a similar problem towards the U.S. posed by Russia. In September 2016, during the first presidential debate, Trump said he doubted whether anyone knew who hacked the DNC, and disputed Russian interference. During the second debate, Trump said there might not have been hacking at all, and questioned why accountability was placed on Russia. During the third debate, Trump rejected Clinton's claim that Putin favored Trump. Trump's words \\"our country has no idea\\" and \\"I doubt it\\" were deeply shocking to the British because \\"all NATO allies\\" and \\"all of America's intelligence agencies\\" were \\"sure Russia was behind the hacking\\". Trump denied these conclusions \\"based on absolutely nothing.... That he would so aggressively fight to clear Putin and cast aspersions on all Western intelligence agencies, left the British officials slack-jawed.\\" After the election, Trump rejected the CIA analysis and asserted that the reports were politically motivated to deflect from the Democrats' electoral defeat. Trump's transition team said in a brief statement: \\"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\\" However, the intelligence analysts involved in monitoring Russian activities are different from those who assessed that Iraq had stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, while post-Iraq War reforms have made it less likely for similar errors to reach the highest levels of the U.S. intelligence community. Trump dismissed reports of Russia's interference, calling them \\"ridiculous\\"; he placed blame on Democrats upset over election results for publicizing these reports, and cited Julian Assange's statement that \\"a 14-year-old kid could have hacked Podesta\\". After Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats and announced further sanctions on Russia, Trump commended Putin for refraining from retaliatory measures against the United States until the Trump administration would lay out its policy towards Russia. Excerpt of Trump press conference on January 11, 2017 On January 6, 2017, after meeting with members of U.S. intelligence agencies, Trump released a statement saying: cyberwarfare had no impact on the election and did not harm voting machines. In the same statement, he vowed to form a national cybersecurity task force to prepare an anti-hacking plan within 90 days of taking office. Referring to the Office of Personnel Management data breach in 2015, Trump said he was under a \\"political witch hunt\\" and wondered why there was no focus on China. Two days later, Reince Priebus said Trump had begun to acknowledge that \\"entities in Russia\\" were involved in the DNC leaks. On January 11, 2017, Trump conceded that Russia was probably the source of the leaks, although he also said it could have been another country. On November 11, 2017, after meeting Vladimir Putin at a summit in Vietnam, Trump said, \\"I just asked him again. He said he absolutely did not meddle in our election.... Every time he sees me he says: 'I didn't do that,' and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.\\" Trump went on to contrast Putin's \\"very strongly, vehemently\\" spoken denials with the word of former intelligence officials who he termed as \\"political hacks\\": John Brennan, James Clapper, and the \\"liar\\" and \\"leaker\\" James Comey. A day later, when asked to clarify his comments, Trump said, \\"As to whether I believe it or not, I'm with our [intelligence] agencies, especially as currently constituted.\\" Brennan and Clapper, appearing on CNN, expressed concern that Trump was \\"giving Putin a pass\\" and showing the Russian leader that \\"Donald Trump can be played by foreign leaders who are going to appeal to his ego and try to play upon his insecurities.\\" In 2019, The Washington Post revealed that in May 2017 Trump had privately told Russian officials Sergey Lavrov and Sergey Kislyak he wasn't concerned about Russia interfering in American elections.  Trump viewed as under Putin's influence  The Steele dossier alleges that the Russians have kompromat on Trump which could be used to blackmail him, and that the Kremlin promised the kompromat will not be used as long as he continues his cooperation with them. Trump's actions at the Helsinki summit in 2018 \\"led many to conclude that Steele's report was more accurate than not.... Trump sided with the Russians over the U.S. intelligence community's assessment that Moscow had waged an all-out attack on the 2016 election... The joint news conference... cemented fears among some that Trump was in Putin's pocket and prompted bipartisan backlash.\\" At the joint news conference, when asked directly about the subject, Putin denied that he had any kompromat on Trump. Even though Trump was reportedly given a \\"gift from Putin\\" the weekend of the pageant, Putin argued \\"that he did not even know Trump was in Russia for the Miss Universe pageant in 2013 when, according to the Steele dossier, video of Trump was secretly recorded to blackmail him.\\" In reaction to Trump's actions at the summit, Senator Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) spoke in the Senate: Several operatives and lawyers in the U.S. intelligence community reacted strongly to Trump's performance at the summit. They described it as \\"subservien[ce] to Putin\\" and a \\"fervent defense of Russia's military and cyber aggression around the world, and its violation of international law in Ukraine\\" which they saw as \\"harmful to U.S. interests\\". They also suggested that he was either a \\"Russian asset\\" or a \\"useful idiot\\" for Putin, and that he looked like \\"Putin's puppet\\". Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper wondered \\"if Russians have something on Trump\\", and former CIA director John O. Brennan, who has accused Trump of \\"treason\\", tweeted: \\"He is wholly in the pocket of Putin.\\" Former acting CIA director Michael Morell has called Trump \\"an unwitting agent of the Russian federation\\", and former CIA director Michael V. Hayden said Trump was a \\"useful fool\\" who is \\"manipulated by Moscow\\". House Speaker Nancy Pelosi questioned Trump's loyalty when she asked him: \\"[Why do] all roads lead to Putin?\\" Ynet, an Israeli online news site, reported on January 12, 2017, that U.S. intelligence had advised Israeli intelligence officers to be cautious about sharing information with the incoming Trump administration, until the possibility of Russian influence over Trump, suggested by Steele's report, has been fully investigated. = Mike Pence = In an interview on February 14, 2018, Pence said, \\"Irrespective of efforts that were made in 2016 by foreign powers, it is the universal conclusion of our intelligence communities that none of those efforts had any impact on the outcome of the 2016 election.\\" Actually, in January 2017 the intelligence community had published a statement saying, \\"We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election.\\" Pence added, \\"It doesn't mean that there weren't efforts, and we do know there were‚Äîthere were efforts by Russia and likely by other countries. We take that very seriously.\\" = Intelligence community = The CIA assessment, and Trump's dismissal of it, created an unprecedented rupture between the president-elect and the intelligence community. On December 11, 2016, U.S. intelligence officials responded to Trump's denunciation of their findings in a written statement, and expressed dismay that Trump disputed their conclusions as politically motivated or inaccurate. They wrote that intelligence officials were motivated to defend U.S. national security. Members of the intelligence community feared reprisals from Donald Trump once he took office. Former CIA Director Michael Morell said foreign interference in U.S. elections was an existential threat. Former CIA spokesman George E. Little condemned Trump for dismissing the CIA assessment, saying the president-elect's atypical response was disgraceful and denigrated the courage of those who serve in the CIA at risk to their own lives.Rebecca Savransky, \\"Former CIA spokesman: Trump's disrespect for intelligence community is 'shameful'\\", The Hill (December 12, 2016). Former NSA director and CIA director Michael V. Hayden posited that Trump's antagonizing the Intelligence Community signaled the administration would rely less on intelligence for policy-making.Michael V. Hayden, \\"Trump is already antagonizing the intelligence community, and that's a problem\\", The Washington Post (December 12, 2016). Independent presidential candidate and former CIA intelligence officer Evan McMullin criticized the Republican leadership for failing to respond adequately to Russia's meddling in the election process. McMullin said Republican politicians were aware that publicly revealed information about Russia's interference was likely the tip of the iceberg relative to the actual threat. Former NSA director Michael V. Hayden has stated that Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election is the \\"most successful covert influence operation in history\\". Hayden went further saying that Trump was a \\"useful fool... manipulated by Moscow\\". A January 2017 report by the Director of National Intelligence said that the intelligence community did \\"not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election\\". Despite this, CIA Director Mike Pompeo claimed that \\"the Russian meddling that took place did not affect the outcome of the election\\" at an event hosted by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies on October 19, 2017. CIA agency spokesman Dean Boyd withdrew his remarks the next day saying they had been made in error. = Electoral College = On December 10, 2016, ten electors, headed by Christine Pelosi, daughter of former United States Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), wrote an open letter to the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper demanding an intelligence briefing on investigations into foreign intervention in the presidential election. Fifty-eight additional electors subsequently added their names to the letter, bringing the total to 68 electors from 17 different states.Pete Williams, \\"Coming Soon: The 'Real' Presidential Election\\", NBC News (December 15, 2016). The Clinton campaign supported the call for a classified briefing for electors.* Gabriel Debenedetti & Kyle Cheney, \\"Clinton campaign backs call for intelligence briefing before Electoral College vote\\", Politico (December 12, 2016). * Dan Merica, \\"Clinton campaign backs intelligence briefing for Electoral College electors\\", CNN (December 13, 2016). On December 16, 2016, the briefing request was denied. = Russia = Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called American accusations \\"nonsense\\". The Russian government initially issued categorical denials of any involvement in the U.S. presidential election.Andrew Higgins, Putin Hints at U.S. Election Meddling by 'Patriotically Minded' Russians, The New York Times (June 1, 2017). By June 2016, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied any connection of Russian government to the DNC hacks that had been blamed on Russia. At the Valdai Discussion Club forum in October 2016, Putin denounced American \\"hysteria\\" over alleged Russian interference. When a new intelligence report surfaced in December 2016, Sergey Lavrov, Foreign Minister of Russia, rejected the accusations again. During a press conference, Putin deflected questions on the issue by accusing the U.S. Democratic Party of scapegoating Russia after losing the presidential election. When ABC News wrote that Russian President Vladimir Putin was directly involved in the covert operation, Peskov called the report \\"rubbish\\" and called on the U.S. government to cease discussion of the topic unless they provided evidence to back up their assertions. In June 2017, Putin said that \\"patriotically minded\\" Russian hackers could have been responsible for the cyberattacks against the U.S. during the 2016 campaign, while continuing to deny government involvement. Putin's comments echoed similar remarks that he had made earlier the same week to the French newspaper Le Figaro. A few days later he said, \\"Presidents come and go, and even the parties in power change, but the main political direction does not change. That's why, in the grand scheme of things, we don't care who's the head of the United States. We know more or less what is going to happen. And so in this regard, even if we wanted to, it wouldn't make sense for us to interfere.\\"\\"Megyn Kelly Drills Vladimir Putin on Presidential Election Hack, Russia's Ties With Trump (Video)\\". Yahoo News. June 5, 2017. Putin also invoked whataboutism and criticized U.S. foreign policy, saying, \\"Put your finger anywhere on a map of the world, and everywhere you will hear complaints that American officials are interfering in internal electoral processes.\\" In March 2018 Putin suggested that \\"Ukrainians, Tatars, Jews, just with Russian citizenship\\" might have been to blame for interfering with U.S. elections, and suggested that \\"maybe it was the Americans who paid them for this work\\".Alexander Smith, Alexan Putin on U.S. election interference: 'I couldn't care less', NBC News (March 10, 2018).Putin says Jews, Ukrainians, Tatars could be behind U.S. election meddling, Associated Press (March 10, 2018). Putin's statement was criticized by the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee; both likened his comments to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an antisemitic hoax first published in Russia in the early 20th century.Alana Abramson, Putin Criticized for Remarks Insinuating Jews and Other Minority Groups Could Be Behind U.S. Election Interference, Time (March 11, 2018).Avi Selk, Putin condemned for saying Jews may have manipulated U.S. election, Washington Post (March 11, 2018). Boruch Gorin, a prominent rabbi in Moscow, said that the translation of Putin's comment into English lacked critical nuance and that Russian Jews were largely indifferent to it.

The green took shape in 1801, and has been a central element of the campus since then. It is flanked by some of the university's oldest and most architecturally important buildings, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history The University Green at UVM is a long and roughly rectangular park, bounded on the north by Colchester Street, the south by Main Street, the east by University Place, and the west by South Prospect Street. It is roughly three blocks long in the north-south direction, and its terrain slopes, rising to east. It is criss-crossed by paved walkways, and has a fountain at the center, from which some of the walkways radiate. Trees, benches, and public artwork and memorials dot the landscape. with \\"Old Mill\\" building The architecture lining the green is divided roughly into three groups. On the east side of the green are some of the university's finest buildings, including the Ira Allen Chapel (1926, McKim, Meade & White), the Billings Memorial Library (1883, H.H. Richardson), Williams Hall (1884, Wilson Brothers), the Old Mill (1825), the university's oldest surviving building, and Morrill Hall (1907, C.W. Buckham). The short southern side of the green is lined by a series of four 19th-century houses, all now in university ownership and housing some of its facilities. The green's west side is dominated by Waterman Hall (1941, McKim, Meade & White), the university's main administration building, and a cluster of buildings at the northern end that are part of the University of Vermont Medical Center. The northern flank of the park is dominated by Grasse Mount, an architecturally eclectic mansion house built in 1803. The land that makes up the green was part of a gift to the university made by Ira Allen, and was originally intended by Allen as an open space. This was reinforced in 1801, when Allen complained of plans by the university trustees to build on it; those plans were later altered, securing its status as a park. It has acted as such to both the university community and the larger Burlington populace for over two centuries.

On the occasion of Hugh's creation as a count in the spring of 1167, the chronicler pseudo- Falcandus notes that he was \\"a man expert in every virtue who had recently arrived from France\\". He mentions that he was a cousin (or relative) of the queen-mother Margaret, then acting as regent for her son, William II, and of the chancellor, Stephen du Perche. Either shortly before or after he was invested with Catanzaro, Hugh married Clementia, the heiress of the last count, Raymond. The couple had twin sons: Hugh the Younger and Jordan. In 1169, Hugh was with his cousin Stephen when the group was violently attacked and forced to take refuge in a church in Palermo. Stephen negotiated his release by resigning his chancellorship and going into exile, while the rebels allowed Hugh to stay on in Sicily. It was thought that Hugh would not pose a danger to the rebels‚Äîdescribed by pseudo-Falcandus as \\"the great men of the court\\"‚Äîand would ease the queen's anger. By February 1168 at the latest, Hugh had been appointed master justiciar and master constable of all Calabria, the Val di Crati, Valsinni and the Valle del Mercure. It is not known how long he held this office, because there is no surviving source mentioning it between 1168 and December 1194. In February 1177, Hugh was one of the barons, churchmen and high officials present as witnesses when William II granted a dower to his queen, Joanna of England. Hugh was still living in November 1190, but he had died by April 1195. He was succeeded in Catanzaro by his eldest son Hugh.

(pdf; 132 kB)  Description  The fortification lies on the southeastern edge of a broad, east-west oriented hill ridge in the forested area of Altenburg.Location of the site at Bayern Atlas (here described as a prehistorical site) The east and south sides of the site drop fairly steeply to the valley floor of the Hirtenbach stream which lies at around 80 metres above sea level. To the west of the fortifications is a terrain saddle. The north side transitions almost on the level into the hill ridge. The two vulnerable sides, in the west and north, were protected by what is now a very low semi-circular rampart guarded by a ditch. The western end of the rampart transitions into a step in the terrain on the hillside. The rampart still has a height of up to 1.3 metres and a width of five metres; the ditch is the same width. The height difference between the floor of the ditch and crest of the rampart is 1.7 metres. About 25 metres behind the rampart, a second parallel stone rampart was built; it too is very low today. The inner rampart has no visible link to the outer one at the edge of the defensive position. In the west and north there are gaps in the rampart; the ditch has also been levelled at these points. These entry points have probably been created relatively recently. The interior of the 170 by 150 metre site descends towards the south and is interrupted by sandpits in places. In the east and south, low terrain steps or terraces can be made out.

Etymologically, the species epithet \\"guarroi\\" honours Professor Josep Guarro in recognition of his extensive mycological work including on the genus Chrysosporium. Skin samples taken from pet green iguanas suffering from dermatomycosis were sent to a laboratory for analysis. Five species were isolated and morphologic studies identified the fungus causing the mycoses as a member of the anamorphic species of Chrysosporium. Further investigation of these species using a combination of morphological, cultural and molecular studies showed that they were not identical to any previously described species within the genus Chrysosporium so they were classified as a new species Chrysosporium guarroisp. nov. The delineation of species in the genus Chrysosporium and their assignment to higher taxonomic levels can be challenging due to the marked morphological simplicity of these fungi. Increased scrutiny of strains of these fungi using molecular genetic tools has revealed numerous hidden species and unexpected relationships. In 2013, Stchigel et al. conducted phenotypic and phylogenetic studies on a set of veterinary fungi identified in GenBank including the five strains which were previously isolated from iguanas (Spain) and described as Chrysosporium guarroi, one isolated from a snake (US), one from a lizard (US), two from bearded dragons (US) and one from a human (US). It was found that these species as well as others previously classified as members of the genus Chrysosporium in the family Onygenaceae formed a distinct lineage. This finding lead to the proposal of a new family Nannizziopsiaceae in the order of Onygenales. Members of this family are known to cause skin mycoses in reptiles with isolated colonies that have a pungent skunk-like odors. Other special features of the family Nannizziopsiaceae is their ability to grow at temperature from 15‚Äì37 ¬∞C, forming small, hyaline, conidia called arthroconidia and aleurioconidia. Their aleurioconidia and arthroconidia are usually 1-celled however rarely the latter might be 2‚Äì5 celled and are borne at the ends of smooth-walled long narrow stalked conidiophores. Additionally, it was thought that each species of Nannizziopsis was associated with specific hosts but that was not proven to be true according to Stchigel since N. guarroi infected lizards, snakes and even immunocompromised humans. Taxonomy Early morphological studies of the fungi strains isolated from pet green iguanas from various geographical locations of Spain provided compelling evidence that they were members of the anamorphic genus Chrysosporium belonging to the family Onygenaceae. In fact, using the maximum- likelihood tree method, the Chrysosporium species to which the five isolates showed the greatest similarity was the Chrysosporium anamorph of Nannizziopsis vriesii (CANV). CANV was first described as Rollinda vriesii in 1970 and later named \\"CANV\\" by Currah in 1985 and has also been known historically to causes cutaneous mycosis and systematic infections in several species of reptiles such as lizards, chameleons, bearded dragons and snakes. The five strains identified using the GenBank strains were: *CH10 [CBS 124553]T (Barcelona, Spain 2006) *CH11 (Barcelona, Spain 2007) *CH14 (Barcelona, Spain 2008) *CH15 (Valladolid, Spain 2008) *CH16 (Madrid, Spain 2009) Studies in 2010 of the molecular structure and phenotype of these strains showed that while they were morphologically very similar to the anamorphic genus Chrysosporium, they were actually very different. They were classified as a new species Chrysosporium guarroi sp.nov. in the family Onygenaceae and the order of Onygenales. Further phylogenetic studies of the five isolates and strains of CANV by Stchigel and colleagues in 2010 using MEGA 5.05 with maximum likelihood algorithm and bootstrap analysis demonstrated that CANV and its relative species were within an order characterized by a unique lineage. This led to them being classified as a new family Nannizziopsiaceae in the order of Onygenales resulting in the previously described Chrysosporium guarroi being named Nannizziopsis guarroi. Growth and morphology Nannizziopsis guarroi produces slow-growing white to yellowish powdery dense colonies of diameter 17‚Äì22 mm with raised centers and reverse side cream to yellow orange when grown in cultures for 14 days. Its optimal growth temperature was observed to be 30‚Äì35 ¬∞C producing conidia which were indistinguishable under a microscope. These were mostly 1-celled condia borne at the ends of long narrow stalks which are thin- and smooth-walled. These conidia were classified into two distinct categories, namely the aleurioconidia which were not abundant and the arthroconidia which were formed from the fragmentation of hyphae and was the dominant strain produced under certain conditions. Telemorphs of this species are not easily formed. Physiology Growth of N. guarroi was observed at temperatures ranging from 15‚Äì37 ¬∞C with optimal growth noted at 30‚Äì35 ¬∞C. On bromocresol purple-milk solids-glucose (BCP-MS-G) agar no hydrolysis was observed for all species with the exception of N. guarroi UTHSC R-4317 (the species affecting humans).On BCP-MS-G agar alkalisation was observed for all strains whereas acidification was not. All strains produced hemolysis on blood agar and showed lipolytic activity, the four strains associated with reptile dermatomycosis showed no growth on sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) with 3% NaCl and on SDA with 5% NaCl growth was scarce. All strains showed good tolerance towards cycloheximide and growth at 15 ¬∞C but growth was scarce at 40 ¬∞C for four strains. Habitat and ecology Nannizziopsis guarroi has been found in various geographic locations in Spain and the US. These fungi has been found to be the etiologic agents in several cases of reported dermatomycosis in mostly reptiles and isolated cases of immunocompromised humans. These fungi were first recognized as causative agents of reptile disease in the early 2000s. It is therefore unclear as to what could have caused their presumed recent growth and affinity for zoological and human hosts. Climate change has been suggested as one possible contributor to the emergence of disease; however the it is likely that historical infections existed but were ignored or misidentified. Pathogenicity in reptiles Nannizziopsis guarroi causes a skin infection mostly in reptiles which can progress to the subcutaneous layers and deeper tissues resulting in the death if not quickly identified and treated.

He produced numerous paintings and drawings of London's topography during the first half of the 19th century. He was born in Canterbury in 1781 as the second son of Jacob Schnebbelie, a confectioner who later became a noted antiquarian draughtsman employed by the Society of Antiquaries of London. When Jacob died at age 31, leaving his family in poverty, Robert took up his father's profession and continued his work drawing old buildings in London. He displayed artistic talent from an early age; in 1795 his mother Caroline wrote to John Bowyer Nichols, one of the editors of the Gentleman's Magazine and a benefactor of the family following Jacob's untimely death, to say that she was \\"taking the liberty of sending you my son, Robert with a few Sketches of his own performance for your inspection\\". She asked Nichols to consider employing her son \\"if you think him Capable of copying any little matter for the Mag[azine]\\". The adult Schnebbelie occasionally exhibited works at the Royal Academy of Arts between 1803 and 1821. Engravings based on his drawings were widely published; he made the drawings for many of the plates in Robert Wilkinson's Londina Illustrata (1808‚Äì1825), David Hughson's Description of London and the Gentleman's Magazine, among others. Schnebbelie was described posthumously by John Bowyer Nichols as being \\"of rather weak intellect, and very capricious in the employment of his time.\\" The death of his mother was said to have affected him to the point that he was \\"scarcely able to take care of himself.\\" He died in a state of acute poverty in Camden Town in 1847. Nichols wrote that \\"to the horror of his few friends, his body was found in a lodging, almost destitute of furniture, after having been some days dead; and it was too evident that his death was hastened by privation.\\" According to Samuel Redgrave, Schnebbelie died of starvation. Views of Schnebbelie's artistic merit vary; he has been described by the Canadian art historian Robert R. Wark as \\"gifted\\", and by Redgrave as \\"a good draftsman\\", though Martin Hardie is less generous, describing both Schnebbelies as \\"painstaking but niggling in their draughtsmanship\\" and their work as \\"not often ris[ing] above a level of good hack work.\\" A number of his works are on display as part of the collections of the Museum of London, the City of London Corporation's Guildhall Art Gallery and the Huntington Museum of Art, among other institutions.

It is located on the site of what was once Camp Pangatian, a military training camp which operated for twenty years until it was converted into an internment camp for Allied prisoners of war during the Japanese occupation. The memorial was dedicated on 12 April 1982 by the survivors of the Bataan Death March and the prisoner-of- war camp in Cabanatuan during World War II. The memorial has been maintained by the American Battle Grounds Commission since 1989. Prior to this, it was maintained by the American Battle Monuments Commission. The memorial is located along the Cabanatuan-Palayan road in Barangay Pangatian, eight kilometers north of the city proper.  History  Route of the Bataan Death March After the surrender of 75,000 Americans by General Edward King Jr. to the Japanese forces during World War II, the American troops were forced to march 65 miles from Mariveles to San Fernando, with the march ending in Capas. This is now known as the Bataan Death March. Camp Pangatian was then used as a P.O.W. camp for the soldiers who survived the death march. Although this event occurred in 1942, no memorial was erected until 1982. The Camp Pangatian P.O.W. camp was liberated in 1945 in an operation known as the most successful tactical rescue mission ever executed by the American military, the raid at Cabanatuan. They were aided by Filipino guerrillas who were fighting the Japanese. This tactical operation was depicted in the 2005 film The Great Raid. Although the Bataan Death March was a significant historical event, the establishment of its memorial in Cabanatuan was not mentioned in any major U.S. news outlet. In 1982, the American Battle Monuments Commission wanted to honor those who died in the Bataan Death March. Because of good relationship with the Philippines, the Filipino government allowed construction to begin. President Ronald Reagan signed a joint resolution on 6 April 1982, which declared that April 12 be officially celebrated as, \\"American Salute to Cabanatuan Prisoner of War Memorial Day.\\" The unveiling of the Cabanatuan memorial, however, was not of much significance to the Filipino people, as no major newspaper on the Philippines printed any information about the memorial or its dedication. = Memorial Wall = Although more than 20,000 U.S. and Allied servicemen and civilians were held in the Japanese internment camp, only 2,656 American names are inscribed on the wall. The names and ranks of the servicemen held in the camp are listed on the memorial walls with horizontal rows with regular Typeface and spacing, similar to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. A marble altar rests in the center of its concrete base. A large mural of Filipino and American soldiers carrying each other in battle is present on the roof deck of the memorial. This elevated circular platform is the only place in Nueva Ecija where the American flag stands beside the Filipino flag. The dedication, which is located on the back of the Cabanatuan sign, describes the memorial. It reads, = Addition = On 6 April 2003, the provincial government of Nueva Ecija inaugurated a second memorial on a piece of land adjacent to the U.S.-maintained memorial. The original monument honors the heroism of the American prisoners of war in Pangatian. The second memorial, however, pays tribute to the Filipino guerrillas who helped in the liberation of Camp Pangatian. The addition features a circular platform with two tablets from the National Historical Institute. One of these tablets is in Filipino while the other is in English.

Like her siblings, Sherwood originally pursued a career in education, teaching chemistry, however, she shifted her interest to medicine. She attended the University of Zurich, and in 1890, obtained her medical degree. A year later, she applied but was turned down, from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. Equipped with recommendation letters from a prominent medical practitioner and educator she studied under at Zurich, she applied to Johns Hopkins Hospital and was offered a spot in Dr. William H. Welch's laboratory, and in Dr. William Osler and Dr. Howard Kelly‚Äôs hospital wards. She was not able to hold her residency there, and a few years later, in 1892, she opened her own practice with her close friend Lilian Welsh. The medical practice did not flourish, but the pair decided to stay in Baltimore anyway and eventually took over the Evening Dispensary for Working Women and Children.

History and profile The weekly magazine was founded in Rome by Oberdan Catone and Vito De Bellis in 1931. It was the first satirical magazine to be started in Italy following the forced closure of other satirical magazines by the Fascist regime, particularly Il Becco Giallo, of which it inheredit many collaborators. It immediately distinguished itself for its original humour, often abstract and surreal.Gianni Bono. \\"Marc'Aurelio\\". Guida al fumetto italiano. Epierre, 2003. pp. 1251‚Äì2. Initially polemic and courageous, after several judicial seizures it gradually ignored political themes and focusing in a humour which was an end in itself, eventually getting a large success and selling over 300,000 copies a week. In 1952 it was launched a Ligurian edition of the magazine, directed by Enzo La Rosa. In 1954 the magazine became fortnightly, and shortly later monthly. In 1955 Marc'Aurelio was acquired by the publisher Corrado Tedeschi who moved the editorial staff in Florence, and the magazine reprised its weekly basis. It eventually ceased its publications in 1958. Many young collaborators of the magazine including Federico Fellini, Steno, Vittorio Metz, Ettore Scola, Cesare Zavattini, Age & Scarpelli, Ruggero Maccari, after the World War II started successful careers in the Italian film industry. In 1973 Delfina Metz (the daughter of Vittorio), with the artistic supervision of Enrico De Seta, shortly relaunched the magazine, which definitively closed the same year after 26 issues.

Like other cultural identities, it relies on a common culture, a traditional lineage, the common land in history, shared experiences including underlying conflicts and confrontations. These commonalities are regional and in historical contexts, tribal. Arab identity is defined independently of religious identity, and pre-dates the spread of Islam, with historically attested Arab Christian tribes and Arab Jewish tribes. Arabs are a diverse group in terms of religious affiliations and practices. Most Arabs are Muslim, with a minority adhering to other faiths, largely Christianity, but also Druze and Baha'i. Arab identity can also be seen through a lens of national, regional or local identity. Throughout Arab history, there have been three major national trends in the Arab world. Pan- Arabism rejects the individual Arab states' existing sovereignty as artificial creations and calls for full Arab unity. History Near East in 565, showing the Ghassanids, Lakhmids, Kindah and Hejaz. The Arabs are first mentioned in the mid-ninth century BCE as a people living in eastern and southern Syria, and the north of the Arabian Peninsula. Expansion of the Caliphate. 220x220px The Arabs appear to have been under the vassalage of the Neo- Assyrian Empire (911‚Äì605 BCE), and the succeeding Neo-Babylonian Empire (605‚Äì539 BCE), Persian Achaemenid Empire (539‚Äì332 BCE), Greek Macedonian/Seleucid Empire and Parthian Empire. Arab tribes, most notably the Ghassanids and Lakhmids begin to appear in the southern Syrian deserts and southern Jordan from the mid 3rd century CE onwards, during the mid to later stages of the Roman Empire and Sasanian Empire. The relation of ' and ' is complicated further by the notion of \\"lost Arabs\\" ' mentioned in the Qur'an as punished for their disbelief. All contemporary Arabs were considered as descended from two ancestors, Qahtan and Adnan. During the early Muslim conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries, the Arabs forged the Rashidun and then Umayyad Caliphate, and later the Abbasid Caliphate, whose borders touched southern France in the west, China in the east, Anatolia in the north, and the Sudan in the south. This was one of the largest land empires in history. Ideology =Arab nationalism= Gamal Abdel Nasser was a symbol and significant player in the rise of Arab nationalism Arab nationalism is a nationalist ideology that asserts the Arabs are a nation and promotes the unity of Arab people. In its contemporary conception, it is the belief that the Arab people are a people united by language, culture, ethnicity, history, geography and interests, and that one Arab nation will assemble the Arabs within its borders from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arabian Sea. Many Arabs believe that they are an old nation, exhibiting pride, for example, based on Arabic poetry and other forms of Arabic literature. In the era of the spread of Islam, nationalism was manifested by the identification of Arabs as a distinct nation within Islamic countries. In the modern era, this idea was embodied by ideologies such as Nasserism and Ba'athism, which were common forms of nationalism in the Arab world, especially in the mid-twentieth century. Perhaps the most important form of creating such an Arab state was the establishment of the United Arab Republic between Egypt and Syria, although it was short-lived. To some extent, Arab nationalism gained a new popular appeal as a result of the Arab Spring of the 2010s, calling for Arab social unity, led by the people on the streets, not the authoritarian regimes that had installed the historic forms of nationalism. =Arab socialism= Arab socialism is a political ideology based on an amalgamation between Arab nationalism and socialism. Arab socialism differs from other socialist ideas prevalent in the Arab world. For many, including Michel Aflaq, one of its founders, Arab socialism was a necessary step towards the consolidation of Arab unity and freedoms, since the socialist system of ownership and development alone could overcome the remnants of colonialism in the Arab world. Unity =Pan-Arabism= Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser signing unity pact with Syrian president Shukri al-Quwatli, forming the United Arab Republic, February 1958. Pan-Arabism is an ideology espousing the unification of the countries of North Africa and Middle East from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arabian Sea, often referred to as the Arab world. The idea is based on the integration of some or all of the Arab countries into a single political and economic framework that removes the borders between the Arab states and establishes a strong economic, cultural and military state. Arab unity is an ideology that Arab nationalists see as a solution to the backwardness, occupation and oppression that the Arab citizens in all the individual states are suffering from. =Arab League= The Arab League, formally the League of Arab States is a regional organization of Arab countries in and around North Africa, the Middle East, the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It was formed in Cairo on 22 March 1945 with six members: Kingdom of Egypt, Kingdom of Iraq, Transjordan (renamed Jordan in 1949), Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Syria. Its charter provides for coordination among member states in economic matters, including trade relations, communications, cultural relations, travel documents and permits, social relations and health. Definition A depiction of Hagar and Ishmael in the Arabian Desert by Fran√ßois-Joseph Navez. An Arab can be defined as a member of a Semitic people, inhabiting much of the Middle East and North Africa. The ties that bind Arabs are ethnic, linguistic, cultural, historical, nationalist, geographical, political, often also relating to religion and to cultural identity.* *3 *War of Visions: Conflict of Identities in the Sudan. p 405. By Francis Mading Deng In their long history and with many local variations, Arabs have developed their distinct customs, language, architecture, fine art, literature, music, cinema, dance, media, cuisine, dress, societies, and mythology.  According to both Judaism and Islam, Ishmael was the ancestor of the Ishmaelites and of the Arabs. Ishmael was the elder son of Abraham and the forefather of bunch of prominent Arab tribes. *Both Judaism and Islam see him as the ancestor of Arab peoples. *Ishmael is recognized by Muslims as the ancestor of several prominent Arab tribes and being the forefather of Muhammad. A‚ÄìZ of Prophets in Islam and Judaism, Wheeler, Ishmael Muslims also believe that Muhammad was the descendant of Ishmael that would establish a great nation, as promised by God in the Old Testament.* *Ishmael was considered the ancestor of the Northern Arabs and Muhammad was linked to him through the lineage of the patriarch Adnan. Ishmael may also have been the ancestor of the Southern Arabs through his descendant Qahtan. *\\"Zayd ibn Amr\\" was another Pre-Islamic figure who refused idolatry and preached monotheism, claiming it was the original belief of their [Arabs] father Ishmael. *The Beginning and the End by Ibn Kathir ‚Äì Vol. 3, p. 323 The History by Ibn Khaldun, Vol, 2, p. 4 *The tribes of Central West Arabia called themselves the \\"people of Abraham and the offspring of Ishmael\\". The Signs of Prophethood, Section 18, page 215. *Gibb, Hamilton A.R. and Kramers, J.H. (1965) Shorter Encyclopedia of Islam. Ithaca:Cornell University Press. pp. 191‚Äì98 Homeland The Arab world, formally the Arab homeland, also known as the Arab nation or the Arab states, currently consists of the 22 Arab countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. They occupy an area stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Arabian Sea in the east, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the north to the Horn of Africa and the Indian Ocean in the southeast. In 2019, the combined population of the Arab world was estimated at 423 million inhabitants.  Categories  Arab identity can be described as consisting of many interconnected parts: = Racial identity = Traditional Qahtanite genealogy. Based on analysis of the DNA of Semitic-speaking peoples, some recent genetic studies have found Y-chromosomal links between modern Semitic-speaking peoples of the Middle East like Arabs, Hebrews, Mandaeans, Samaritans, and Assyrians. Medieval Arab genealogists divided Arabs into three groups: * \\"Ancient Arabs\\" tribes that had vanished or been destroyed. * \\"Pure Arabs\\" descending from the Qahtan tribe, who existed before Abraham and Ishmael. * The \\"Arabized Arabs\\" descending from Ishmael, the elder son of Abraham through his marriage to Rala bint Mudad ibn Amr ibn Jurhum, an Arab Qahtani woman. Tribes descending from this alliance are also referred to as Adnani tribes. Centuries later, the \\"Arabized Arabs\\" assumed the name \\"Pure Arabs\\" and the \\"Arabized Arabs\\" description was attributed to other peoples that joined Islam and created alliances with the Arab tribes. = Ethnic identity = Arab tribes before the spread of Islam Concentrating on ethnic identity is another way of defining Arab identity, which can be subdivided in linguistic, cultural, social, historical, political, national or genealogical terms. In this approach, \\"being Arab\\" is based on one or several of the following criteria: * Genealogy: Someone who can trace his or her ancestry to the Arab tribes, from the Arabian Desert, Syrian Desert and neighboring areas.(Regueiro et al.) 2006; found agreement by (Battaglia et al.) 2008 * Ancestry: belonging to Arab people, inherited from grandparents, or denoting an ancestor or ancestors. * Self-concept: a person who defines himself as \\"Arab\\" *Attribution of identity: Someone, who is seen by others as an Arab, based on their notions of ethnicity (for example, people of northern Sudan, who can be seen both as African and/or Arab) *Linguistic: Someone whose first language, and, by extension, cultural expression, is Arabic.Jankowski, James. \\"Egypt and Early Arab Nationalism\\" in Rashid Kakhlidi, ed., Origins of Arab Nationalism, pp. 244‚Äì245Quoted in Dawisha, Adeed. Arab Nationalism in the Twentieth Century. Princeton University Press. 2003, , p. 99 * Culture: someone who was brought up with Arab culture *Political: Someone, whose country is a member of the League of Arab States and who shares political associations with the Arab countries. (for example, Somalis and Djiboutians) * Societal: Someone who lives in or identifies with an Arab society * Nationality: one who is a national of an Arab state = National identity = flag of the Arab Revolt, its design and colors are the basis of many of the Arab states' flags. National identity is one's identity or sense of belonging to one state or to one nation. It is the sense of a nation as a cohesive whole, as represented by distinctive traditions, culture, language and politics. Arab nationalism is a nationalist ideology celebrating the glories of Arab civilization, the language and literature of the Arabs, calling for rejuvenation and political union in the Arab world. The premise of Arab nationalism is the need for an ethnic, political, cultural and historical unity among the Arab peoples of the Arab countries. The main objective of Arab nationalism was to achieve the independence of Western influence of all Arab countries. Arab political strategies with the nation in order to determine the struggle of the Arab nation with the state system (nation-state) and the struggle of the Arab nation for unity. The concepts of new nationalism and old nationalism are used in analysis to expose the conflict between nationalism, national ethnic nationalism, and new national political nationalism. These two aspects of national conflicts highlight the crisis known as the Arab Spring, which affects the Arab world today. Suppressing the political struggle to assert the identity of the new civil state is said to clash with the original ethnic identity. = Religious identity = Pre-Islamic Arabian goddess AllƒÅt from the Ba‚Äòalsham√Æn temple in Palmyra, first century AD Until about the fourth century, almost all Arabs practised polytheistic religions. Although significant Jewish and Christian minorities developed, polytheism remained the dominant belief system in pre-Islamic, most Arabs followed a pagan religion with a number of deities, including Hubal, Wadd, AllƒÅt, Manat, and Uzza. A few individuals, the hanifs, had apparently rejected polytheism in favor of monotheism unaffiliated with any particular religion. Different theories have been proposed regarding the role of Allah in Meccan religion. Today the majority of Arabs are Muslims, identities are often seen as inseparable. The \\"Verse of brotherhood\\" is the tenth verse of the Quranic chapter \\"Al-Hujurat\\", is about brotherhood of believers with each other.Brotherhood in the Quran and Sunnah  Faith in Allah ÿßŸÑÿ•ŸäŸÖÿßŸÜ ÿ®ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá However, there were divergent currents in Arabism - one religious and secular one - throughout Arab history. After the collapse of the Ottoman Islamic caliphate in the 20th century, Arab nationalism emerged on the religious front. These two trends have continued to overcome each other to this day. Now, religious fundamentalism offers an alternative to secular nationalism. There are also different religious denominations within Islam and are often valuable to religion as a whole, leading to sectarian conflict and conflict. In fact, the social and psychological distances between Sunni and Shia Muslims may be greater than the perceived distance between different religions. Because of this, Islam can be seen both as a unification and as a force of division in Arab identity. = Cultural Identity = Elegant Arab Ladies on a Terrace at Sunset Arab cultural identity is characterized by complete uniformity. Arab cultural space are historically so tightly interwoven. Arab cultural identity has been assessed through four measures that measure the basic characteristics of Arab culture: religiosity, grouping, belief in gender hierarchy and attitudes toward sexual behavior. The results indicate the predominance of the professional strategies that Arab social workers have learned in their training in social work, while indicating the willingness of social workers to benefit from established strategies in their culture and society, either separately or in combination with the professional. There are different aspects of Arab identity, whether ethnic, religious, national, linguistic or cultural - of different fields and analytical angles. = Linguistic identity = Imru' al-Qays, son of 'Amr, king of all the Arabs\\", inscribed in Nabataean script. Basalt, dated in 7 Kislul, 223, viz. December 7, 328 AD. Found at Nemara in the Hauran (Southern Syria). For some Arabs, beyond language, race, religion, tribe or region. Arabic; hence, can be considered as a common factor among all Arabs. Since the Arabic language also exceeds the country's border, the Arabic language helps to create a sense of Arab nationalism. According to the Iraqi world exclusive Cece, \\"it must be people who speak one language one heart and one soul, so should form one nation and thus one country.\\" There are two sides to the coin, argumentative. While the Arabic language as one language can be a unifying factor, the language is often not unique at all. Accents vary from region to region, there are wide differences between written and spoken versions, many countries host bilingual citizens, many Arabs are illiterate. This leads us to examine other identifying aspects of Arabic identity. Arabic, a Semitic language from the Afroasiatic language family. Modern Standard Arabic serves as the standardized and literary variety of Arabic used in writing, as well as in most formal speech, although it is not used in daily speech by the overwhelming majority of Arabs. Most Arabs who are functional in Modern Standard Arabic acquire it through education and use it solely for writing and formal settings. = Political identity = A map of the Arab world. Arab political identity characterized by restraint, compassion, hospitality, generosity, and proper conduct. Arab countries to redefine politics are linked to the fact that the political culture behind the Arabs has been overrun for centuries by successive political. The vast majority of the citizens of the Arab countries view themselves and are seen by outsiders as \\"Arabs\\". Their sense of the Arab nation is based on their common denominators: language, culture, ethnicity, social and political experiences, economic interests and the collective memory of their place and role in history. The relative importance of these factors is estimated differently by different groups and frequently disputed. Some combine aspects of each definition, as done by Palestinian Habib Hassan Touma:1996, p.xviii The Arab League, a regional organization of countries intended to encompass the Arab world, defines an Arab as: See also References Arab culture Arab society Arab nationalism National identity Identity politics ","title":"Arab identity"},{"id":"52548190","text":"Campbell Township is an inactive township in Polk County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.

Most notable in the media are the many websites that made completely false claims about political candidates such as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, as part of a larger campaign to gain viewers and ad revenue or spread disinformation. Additionally, satire websites have received criticism for not properly notifying readers that they are publishing false or satirical content, since many readers have been duped by seemingly legitimate articles.  Definition  Fake news websites deliberately publish hoaxes, propaganda, and disinformation to drive web traffic inflamed by social media. These sites are distinguished from news satire as fake news articles are usually fabricated to deliberately mislead readers, either for profit or more ambiguous reasons, such as disinformation campaigns. Many sites originate in or are promoted by Russia, North Macedonia, Romania, and the United States. Many sites directly targeted the United States both because the U.S. is a high-value ad consumer and extraordinary claims to be more likely to be believed during a political crisis. The New York Times noted in a December 2016 article that fake news had previously maintained a presence on the Internet and within tabloid journalism in years prior to the 2016 U.S. election. However, prior to the election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, fake news had not impacted the election process to such a high degree. Subsequent to that election, the issue of fake news turned into a political weapon between supporters of Clinton and Trump; due to these back- and-forth complaints, the definition of fake news as used for such argumentation became vaguer.  Methods  Fake news websites use a variety of methods to fool their readers into believing their content, either by attempting to persuade the readers that they are legitimate or by distracting readers with incredible news. = Clickbait = Fictional examples of clickbait adverts Fake news websites often have article titles that are incredible, prompting the user to click on it and read more. This method of enticing readers to view content on their website often leads to exaggerated or even fake titles. When linked to from other sites, usually social media, having an extraordinary story title played a large part in tricking users who cannot tell if the article is real or not. This became especially relevant in the 2016 election. Additionally, out-of-context or manipulated images can cause readers to incorrectly assume an article's legitimacy, often due to their inflammatory image choice. Facebook's Vice President of News Feed says the social media giant defines clickbait \\"as headlines that withhold significant amounts of information and mislead the user\\". Because it is difficult to determine what content exactly is fake news, the website uses a data set to calculate the likelihood of a headline being clickbait. = Impersonation = Another method of gaining readers is impersonating a legitimate news organization. This can come in two forms, either by copying a popular news organization's website formatting and pretending to be a lesser known publication or by completely copying an existing website down to its name and authors. Exact copies can trick viewers into believing the website is an official organization such as the Bloomberg.ma or cnn-trending.com. ABCnews.com.co was a fake news website that \\"crudely\\" spoofed legitimate journalistic organization ABC News, but was in reality completely unrelated. The site published only fake stories, usually with a realistic clickbait headline, albeit with story-details containing enough flaws that the \\"discerning reader would likely notice\\" it was false. The Denver Guardian was a blog site registered in 2016 that claimed to be a legitimate newspaper in Denver, but only ran a single fabricated story that went viral. = Typosquatting = Typosquatting, a form of cybersquatting, is based on Internet users mistyping the name of a popular Web site. A typosquatter will monitor how many clicks a \\"typo\\" domain name receives and use the information to sell advertising for the sites that receive a high volume of \\"accidental\\" traffic. Many popular fake news websites like ABCnews.com.co attempted to impersonate a legitimate U.S. news publication, relying on readers not actually checking the address they typed or clicked on. They exploited common misspellings, slight misphrasings and abuse of top-level domains such as .com.co as opposed to .com. Many social media users were duped, believing they were going to an actual news publication's website. = Obscurity = Since the authors of these websites are not actual reporters, many fake news sites either pretend to have the identity of a reporter or simply do not include an 'About Us' page. These websites almost never have any other publications that reference them or information about themselves on tertiary sources like Wikipedia. When these sites are publicized by actual organizations, they receive a bit of legitimacy along with more viewers.  Fake news campaigns  Fake news campaigns are when multiple fake news websites are published with similar topics in hopes of convincing a broader audience, either by quantity or by reference. = 2020 election cycle = An article in the San Diego Union-Tribune states that Facebook decided to accept political ads from candidates that make false claims and it has the potential to damage American democracy at a time when social media can be more easily manipulated than ever. The Bangor Daily News suggests Facebook and Google to do what broadcast and cable TV networks have done for decades: have politically neutral fact- checkers vet every single political ad. This approach has not prevented past campaigns from running powerful, hard-hitting ads. What it does prevent, or at least limit, is the rapid spread of disinformation. This year's election will have more money spent than any other election in United States history. According to Will Robinson, a Democratic consultant and a founding partner of New Media Firm, \\"This is the first post-mass media election in which, for the first time in U.S. history, more significant amounts of money will be spent on social media and digital than on broadcast.\\" Glen Bolger, a partner at Public Opinion Strategies, a leading Republican polling firm, predicted that \\"If you like clean, positive, issue-oriented campaigns, you're going to be disappointed. It's going to be rough and tumble.\\" Keeping Facebook free of fake news is more manageable now, but still difficult to do. In December Facebook and Twitter disabled a global network of 900 pages, groups and accounts sending pro-Trump messages. The fake news accounts managed to avoid detection as being inauthentic. And they used photos generated with the aid of artificial intelligence. The campaign was based in the U.S. and Vietnam. \\"There's no question that social media has really changed the way that we talk about politics,\\" said Deen Freelon, a media professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \\"The No. 1 example is our president who, whether you like him or not, uses social media in ways that are unprecedented for a president and I would say any politician.\\" In the 2020 election there are so many people running for president and so many bad actors trying to spread disinformation about them, it will be difficult to determine what is \\"fake news\\" and who created it. The question is not if or when there will be disinformation campaigns, because they have already started.  Major sites involved  * Metric Media Foundation websites ‚Äì pro-right = 2016 election cycle = Fake news websites played a large part in the online news community during the election, reinforced by extreme exposure on Facebook and Google. Approximately 115 pro-Trump fake stories were shared on Facebook a total of 30 million times, and 41 pro-Clinton fake stories shared a total of 7.6 million times. There were two main reasons for creating fake news, economical and ideological. The teenagers in Veles, for example, produced stories favoring both Trump and Clinton that earned them tens of thousands of dollars. Some fake news providers seek to advance candidates they favor. The Romanian man who ran endingthefed.com, for example, claims that he started the site mainly to help Donald Trump's campaign.  Major sites involved  * ABCnews.com.co ‚Äì pro-right * Conservative Daily Post ‚Äì both anti-left and anti-right * Denver Guardian ‚Äì known for anti-Hillary Clinton articles * Disinfomedia ‚Äì anti-right articles that aimed to trick alt-rights * News Examiner ‚Äì anti-left articles * SubjectPolitics.com ‚Äì known for anti-Hillary Clinton articles * YourNewsWire.com ‚Äì inflammatory for both sides as well as conspiratorial  Social media  Professor Philip N. Howard of the University of Oxford found that about one half of all news on Twitter directed at Michigan prior to the election was junk or fake. The other half came from real news sources. Criticized for failing to stop fake news from spreading on its platform during the 2016 election, Facebook thought that the problem could be solved by engineering, until May 2017 when it announced plans to hire 3,000 content reviewers. Fraudulent stories during the 2016 U.S. presidential election popularized on Facebook included a viral post that Pope Francis and actor Denzel Washington had endorsed Donald Trump. Alternet reported that Trump himself had been the source of some of the related misinformation. BuzzFeed News found that on Facebook during the last three months of the election, fake news stories received more attention than real news stories. It was discovered that the top twenty fake news stories had 8,711,000 shares, reactions, and comments, while the top twenty real news stories were only shared, commented on, and reacted to 7,367,000 times. One prominent fraudulent news story released after the election‚Äîthat protesters at anti-Trump rallies in Austin, Texas, were \\"bused in\\"‚Äîstarted as a tweet by one individual with 40 Twitter followers. Over the next three days, the tweet was shared at least 16,000 times on Twitter and 350,000 times on Facebook, and promoted in the conservative blogosphere, before the individual stated that he had fabricated his assertions. President Barack Obama commented on the significant problem of fraudulent information on social networks impacting elections in a speech the day before Election Day in 2016, saying lies repeated on social media created a \\"dust cloud of nonsense\\". Shortly after the election, Obama again commented on the problem, saying in an appearance with German Chancellor Angela Merkel: \\"if we can't discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems\\". President Trump has also commented significantly on fake news, creating the Fake News Awards to highlight real news outlets that publicly \\"misrepresented\\" him. = \\"Pizzagate\\" = In early November 2016, fake news sites and Internet forums falsely implicated the restaurant Comet Ping Pong and Democratic Party figures as part of a fictitious child trafficking ring, which was dubbed \\"Pizzagate\\". The conspiracy theory was debunked by the fact- checking website Snopes.com, The New York Times, and Fox News. The restaurant's owners and staff were harassed and threatened on social media. After threats, Comet Ping Pong increased security for concerts held inside its premises. Days after the attack, Hillary Clinton spoke out on the dangers of fake news in a tribute speech to retiring Senator Harry Reid at the U.S. Capitol. Clinton called the spread of fraudulent news and fabricated propaganda an epidemic that flowed through social media. She said it posed a danger to citizens of the U.S. and to the country's political process. Clinton said in her speech she supported bills before the U.S. Congress to deal with fake news.  Notable examples of fake news websites  Many of these websites are categorized as fake news because they have a satirical take on the news, but ultimately fail to convince their readers that their content is actually fake. = RealTrueNews = RealTrueNews.com was created as a hoax that the author believed would teach his alt-right friends about reader gullibility. The \\"everything was a lie\\" strapline was added later. Marco Chacon created the fake news site RealTrueNews to show his alt-right friends their alleged gullibility. Chacon wrote a fake transcript for Clinton's leaked speeches in which Clinton explains bronies to Goldman Sachs bankers. Chacon was shocked when his fiction was reported as factual by Fox News and he heard his writings on Megyn Kelly's The Kelly File. Trace Gallagher repeated Chacon's fiction and falsely reported Clinton had called Bernie Sanders supporters a \\"bucket of losers\\"‚Äîa phrase made up by Chacon. After denials from Clinton staff, Megyn Kelly apologized with a public retraction. Chacon later told Brent Bambury of CBC Radio One program Day 6 that he was so shocked at readers' ignorance he felt it was like an episode from The Twilight Zone. In an interview with ABC News, Chacon defended his site, saying it was an over-the-top parody of fake sites to teach his friends how ridiculous they were. The Daily Beast reported on the popularity of Chacon's fictions being reported as if it were factual and noted pro-Trump message boards and YouTube videos routinely believed them. In a follow-up piece Chacon wrote as a contributor for The Daily Beast after the 2016 U.S. election, he concluded those most susceptible to fake news were consumers who limited themselves to partisan media outlets. = Global Associated News (MediaFetcher.com) = MediaFetcher.com is a fake news website generator. It has various templates for creating false articles about celebrities of a user's choice. Often users miss the disclaimer at the bottom of the page, before re-sharing. The website has prompted many readers to speculate about the deaths of various celebrities. = Huzlers = Similar to Global Associated News, many readers have been tricked into believing the satire website Huzlers. Snopes has over 30 separate fact checks on their articles, each one correcting the fake news from Huzlers. According to owner Pablo Reyes Jr, the website does not \\"try to trick people intentionally.\\" = 70news = 70news was a WordPress-based blog site, which produced fake news during 2016; in particular, one story falsely stated that Donald Trump had won the popular vote in the 2016 election, fooled search engine algorithms and ranked very highly in results the day after the election. When googling \\"final election vote count,\\" the website 70News was the top one to come up. It truthfully stated that Trump had won the electoral college but falsely stated that Trump was ahead of Hillary Clinton in the popular vote. By the next day, the story had dropped one spot to number two on the search list. Google commented that its software algorithms use hundreds of factors to determine the ranking. = Disinfomedia = In addition to disconnected sites that run on an inadequate budget, there are sites with many connections behind them: from Los Angeles founded Disinfomedia, a company that owns many fake news sites. He gave interviews under a pseudonym, Allen Montgomery. With the help of tech-company engineer John Jansen, journalists from NPR found Coler's identity. Coler explained how his intent for his project backfired; he wanted to expose alt-right echo chambers, and point out their gullibility. He stated his company wrote fake articles for the left wing that were not shared as much as those from a right-wing point of view. = National Report and News Examiner = Both of these fake news websites heavily profited through the use of clickbait headlines, which were usually false. Paul Horner, a lead writer at both of these websites, focused significantly on the election, since it drew strong ad revenue. He told The Washington Post he made $10,000 per month through ads linked to fake news. After the election, Horner said that he felt his efforts helped Trump. In a follow-up interview with Rolling Stone, Horner revealed The Washington Post profile piece on him spurred increased interest with over 60 interview requests from media including ABC News, CBS News, and CBS's Inside Edition. Horner explained his writing style: articles that appeared legitimate at the top and became increasingly absurd as the reader progressed. These two websites often referenced each other. = Christian Times Newspaper = In an interview with The New York Times, Cameron Harris of Annapolis, Maryland, explains how he profited from creating fake news on his website, ChristianTimesNewspaper.com, that included a false story claiming that premarked ballots for Mrs. Clinton were being held in boxes at a warehouse in Ohio. Within a few days, the story had earned him around $5,000. = KMT 11 News = During the summer of 2016, KMT 11 News published a series of fake news stories regarding celebrity appearances and filming locations in random local towns. These towns included Brentwood, Tennessee, Chandler, Arizona, and Atlantic City, New Jersey.  Spread and identification of fake news  44 percent of all US adults get news from Facebook. Investigations conducted in 2017 showed nearly 40 percent of content by far-right Facebook pages and 19 percent of extreme left-leaning pages were false or misleading. In the 10 months leading up to the 2016 presidential election, 20 fake news articles shared on Facebook dramatically increased from 3 million shares, reactions, and comments to nearly 9 million. Mainstream media articles, on the other hand, declined from 12 million shares, reactions, and comments in February to only 7.3 million by Election Day. A study conducted by the Stanford Graduate School of Education from January 2015 revealed difficulties that middle, high school, and college students experienced in differentiating between advertisements and news articles, or identifying where information originated. One concern noted by researchers of the study is that democracy is at risk of devolving due to the ways in which falsehoods about civic issues can quickly spread with a growing ease of access. In one assessment, high school students were asked to evaluate two Facebook posts mentioning Donald Trump's candidacy for president; one was from an actual Fox News account and the other was from a fake account. Over 30 percent of students stated that the fake account was more reliable because of its graphic elements and only a quarter recognized the significance of the blue checkmark on Twitter and Facebook, which indicates that an account was marked as legitimate.  U.S. response  = Educational = Elementary school teachers have decided to challenge results from the Stanford study by showing children the importance of not being deceived by what is fake. Fifth grade teacher Scott Bedley in California created his own version of \\"Simon Says\\", in which students are given three minutes to read an article and decide whether a news story is true or false. Bedley worked with another teacher in Kansas, Todd Flory, to devise a \\"fake news challenge\\" via Skype whereby Flory's class picked two real articles and wrote a fake one, to be presented to Bedley's class in California. Teachers are promoting these learning techniques with the hope that such strategies and skills will stay with their students' for the rest of their adolescent and adult lives. Andreas Schleicher, the lead of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, announced in 2017 that his organization was initiating \\"global competencies\\" tests that will be taken by 15-year-olds around the world alongside the OECD's current reading, maths and science assessments, which are conducted every three years. This will test how well students can discern fake news outside of their sociopolitical bubble. Jennifer Coogan, editor in chief of education startup Newsela, has partnered with the American Press Institute to help combat fake news consumption in addition to its regular literacy classes. She believes it is now the teacher's responsibility to help teach their students about which media to believe since it is near impossible for a parent to monitor every source that a child will read. = Commercial =  Facebook  After receiving heavy criticism for not stopping the extreme number of fake news articles on its platform, Facebook announced in December 2016 that it would begin to flag fake news. If enough users flagged a story, the story would be sent to a third-party organization to check its veracity. If it failed, it would lose news feed priority as well as have \\"disputed by 3rd party fact-checkers\\" as a caption. Facebook is also attempting to reduce their financial incentives in an attempt to decrease the amount of fake news. The fact checking organizations involved are ABC News, Associated Press, FactCheck.org, PolitiFact and Snopes. In 2018, Facebook has admitted that it \\"fell short\\" in stopping outside meddling in the U.S. presidential election. This admission comes after increased scrutiny from lawmakers in a broader backlash against Silicon Valley as well as a Senate hearing for social media company executives. In today's world young people rely heavily on social media to access information that is broadcast on the news. Many teens described traditional news as \\"boring\\" and \\"the same\\", implying that it was predictable and devoid of any questioning of power. In contrast, they felt that Facebook postings, YouTube videos, blogs, opinionated talk shows and fake news provided background information and perspectives that enabled them to understand the larger meanings of political events and develop their own opinions. For them, this was a more truthful and authentic rendition of news.  Fact-checking organizations  In the aftermath of the election, many fact-checking websites teamed up with Facebook in order to check on the veracity of linked articles. Many of these organizations have also posted lists of fake news websites and guides on how to identify them. = Governmental =  Legislative  Members of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee traveled to Ukraine and Poland in March 2016 and heard from officials in both countries on Russian operations to influence their affairs. U.S. Senator Angus King told the Portland Press Herald that tactics used by Russia during the 2016 U.S. election were analogous to those used against other countries. King recalled the legislators were informed by officials from both Ukraine and Poland about Russian tactics of \\"planting fake news stories\\" during elections. On November 20, 2016, King joined a letter in which seven members of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee asked President Obama to publicize more information from the intelligence community on Russia's role in the U.S. election. In an interview with CNN, Senator King warned against ignoring the problem, saying it was a bipartisan issue. Amid worries about fake news and disinformation being spread by Russia, representatives in the U.S. Congress called for more action to track and counter alleged propaganda emanating from overseas. On November 20, 2016, legislators approved a measure within the National Defense Authorization Act to ask the U.S. State Department act against propaganda with an inter-agency panel. The legislation authorized funding of $160 million over a two-year- period. The initiative was developed through a bipartisan bill, the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act, written by U.S. Senators Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Chris Murphy. Portman urged more U.S. government action to counter propaganda. Murphy said after the election it was apparent the U.S. needed additional tactics to fight Russian propaganda. U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee member Ron Wyden said frustration over covert Russian propaganda was bipartisan. Republican U.S. Senators stated they planned to hold hearings and investigate Russian influence on the 2016 U.S. elections. By doing so they went against the preference of incoming Republican President- elect Donald Trump, who downplayed any potential Russian meddling in the election. U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain and U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr discussed plans for collaboration on investigations of Russian cyberwarfare during the election. U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker planned a 2017 investigation. Senator Lindsey Graham indicated he would conduct a sweeping investigation in the 115th U.S. Congress session.  FTC  In 2013, the Federal Trade Commission, as part of a campaign to crack down on bogus health claims, charged over $1.6 million to Beony International, owner Mario Milanovic, and Beony International employee Cody Adams. They conspired to promote their own weight loss products with fake news websites. These websites pretended to be legitimate news organizations and heavily promoted their acai berry weight-loss products.  Counter-Disinformation Team  The United States Department of State planned to use a unit called the Counter- Disinformation Team, formed with the intention of combating disinformation from the Russian government; it was disbanded in September 2015 after department heads missed the scope of propaganda before the 2016 U.S. election. The U.S. State Department put eight months into developing the unit before scrapping it. It would have been a reboot of the Active Measures Working Group set up by President Reagan. The Counter-Disinformation Team was set up under the Bureau of International Information Programs. Work began in 2014, with the intention to combat propaganda from Russian sources such as Russia Today. U.S. Intelligence officials explained to former National Security Agency analyst and counterintelligence officer John R. Schindler that the Obama Administration decided to cancel the unit as they were afraid of antagonizing Russia. U.S. Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy Richard Stengel was point person for the unit before it was canceled. Stengel previously wrote about disinformation by Russia Today.

Bill Oates wrote, in his biography of Meredith Willson, that the program was \\"one of the most popular West Coast originated radio shows in the early 1930s.\\" Format Radio historian John Dunning wrote that the program was \\"known in the West as 'the daddy of all variety shows.'\\" Blue Monday Jamboree \\"contained music, comedy and a dramatic sketch (a detective story).\\"Sies, Luther F.

The Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (TAK) assumed responsibility, claiming that their members killed more than 100 police officers.  Background  Earlier in 2016, Turkey had been hit by a number of bombings carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (TAK). The deadliest of these had been the Gaziantep bombing, killing over 50 people. According to Turkish T24 newspaper, this was the seventh terrorist attack in Istanbul in 2016. The Atat√ºrk Airport attack was the deadliest attack to have occurred in Istanbul in 2016. On 10 December 2016, the TAK took responsibility and claimed to have killed 100 police officers. In their statement, the group stated that Turkish people are not their direct target and their \\"Team Martyr Tirej\\" carried out the action with \\"utmost attention\\", but that no \\"comfortable life\\" should be expected in Turkey while the imprisonment of their leader Abdullah √ñcalan continued. They accused the Turkish state of committing abuses in Kurdish regions, and attributed the chaos to the Turkish ruling-party AKP.  Bombings  The first explosion was a car bombing in front of the Vodafone Arena. About of explosives with iron pellets were used in the attack. It was aimed at a group of riot police which had overseen the spectators of a match leaving the station; the attack took place after the spectators had left. It was reported by NTV that the bombing targeted a police vehicle leaving the stadium. A football match of the 2016‚Äì17 S√ºper Lig between Be≈üikta≈ü JK and Bursaspor had taken place around one and a half hours before the explosion and the bombings occurred in the exit for Bursaspor supporters. Bursaspor released a statement from its official Twitter account, saying that none of its supporters had been injured. The second explosion was a suicide bombing at the nearby Ma√ßka Park. This took place 45 seconds after the first one and was followed by police gunshots. It occurred as a person wearing a coat and carrying a backpack was ordered to stop by the police at the entrance of the park, but blew themselves up before they could be apprehended, killing four police officers and one civilian on the spot. The sounds of the bombing could be heard from as far away as √úsk√ºdar on the Asian side. Be≈üikta≈ü JK released statements identifying two of the people that were killed: Vefa Karakurdu, the head of security of Vodafone Arena and a BJK congress member and Tun√ß Uncu, an employee of the local BJK shop. Another of the victims was Berkay Akba≈ü, a medical student studying in Ankara who had been visiting Istanbul and happened to be passing in front of the stadium in a car during the attack. Police victims include Adem Oguz, Adem Serin, Ali Aksoy, Durmus Ocal, Hasan Bilgin, Ilker Uylas, Kadir Yildirim, Mehmet Atici, Metin Duzgun, Mustafa Ozturk, Yasin Ike, Suleyman Sorkut, Okan Dogan, Soner Idil, Mehmet Zengin, Oguzhan Duyar and Hamdi Dikmen.  Aftermath  Memorial point after December 2016 Istanbul bombings RT√úK, the Turkish broadcast regulatory authority, imposed a temporary broadcast ban on the bombing except for officially released information. Six prosecutors were immediately tasked with investigating the attack. 13 people were arrested in the following hours in relation to the attack. Major roads in the city were closed after the attack; these included roads linking Ortak√∂y to Be≈üikta≈ü, Karak√∂y to Dolmabah√ße and G√ºm√º≈üsuyu to Dolmabah√ße. President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan released a statement on 11 December 2016 at around 01:30 local time, officially confirming deaths for the first time but not specifying a number. He also added that the aim of the attack was to maximize the death toll. In his statement, Erdoƒüan wrote that the organization that perpetrated the attack was not important as \\"all terrorist organizations, including PKK, DAESH or FET√ñ strike Turkey with the same goals\\". He also criticized unspecified Western countries by accusing them of \\"supporting terror\\". According to Mark Lowen, the BBC's correspondent in Turkey, Kurdish militant groups were implicated by the fact that the police were targeted. Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmu≈ü said that signs were suggesting that the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) might have carried out the attack. Later, the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (TAK) claimed responsibility for the bombings. By December 12, 235 were detained in an anti-terror raid, in which 200 of those detained were members of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP). They were charged on 11 counts of terrorism and spreading terrorist propaganda on social media. The attack was condemned by ruling AKP and 2 opposition parties in the parliament, the Republican People's Party (CHP) and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), in a mutual declaration. Renaming of the location  The location where the bombing occurred was known as Free Hill (). Situated northwest of the stadium, the hill allowed people to freely watch the football matches in the stadium before the new stadium was built. Two days after the bombing, the council of Be≈üikta≈ü municipality decided to rename the location Martyrs' Hill () in honor of the people died there.

Donors can also visit blood banks in hospitals to donate blood or directly to a receiver. Despite the shortage of donated blood, efforts by the government and various organizations have led to a decrease in the demand and supply gap over the years. The number of voluntary blood donors increased from 54.4% in 2006‚Äì2007 to 83.1% in 2011‚Äì2012, with the number of blood units increasing from 4.4 million units in 2006‚Äì2007 to 9.3 million units in 2012‚Äì2013. In 2016, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare reported a donation of 10.9 million units against a requirement of 12 million units. Blood donors in India donate around 350 millilitres of blood. After a donation, the donors are provided with refreshments, which usually include a glucose drink, biscuits and fruits. Some organizations offer transportation facilities, apart from providing certificates or badges as a gratitude. History of blood donation in India The history of voluntary blood donation in India dates back to 1942 during the second world war when blood donors were required to help the wounded soldiers. The first blood bank was established in Kolkata, West Bengal in March 1942 at the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health and was managed by the Red Cross. The donors were mostly government employees and people from the Anglo-Indian community who donated blood for a humanitarian cause. The number of voluntary donors declined after the war and donors had to be paid for the blood. Leela Moolgaonkar, a social reformer, initiated voluntary blood donation camps in Mumbai from 1954. The 1960s saw many blood banks open in different cities. Under his stewardship in 1975, J. G. Jolly, the president of the Indian Society of Blood Transfusion and Immunohaematology declared 1 October as the National Voluntary Blood Donation Day, which has been observed throughout the country ever since. The HIV pandemic in the 1980s led to the government setting up the National AIDS Control Organisation in 1992 to oversee the policies in preventing the spread of AIDS. Subsequently, the National AIDS Control Programme was launched which led to drastic improvements in patient screening and hygienic transfusion procedures. A public interest litigation was filed in the Supreme court in 1996 to abolish the practice of selling blood which became effective on 1 January 1998. Selling or donating blood in exchange of money is illegal under the National Blood Transfusion Services Act 2007 and those found convicted may face a prison sentence of up to three months with fine. Criteria to donate blood There are several parameters that determine the eligibility of an individual to donate blood. Guidelines laid down by the Ministry of Health, Government of India have to be followed by blood banks and organizations conducting blood donation camps. * Overall health- The donor must be fit and healthy, and should not be suffering from transmittable diseases. * Age and weight- The donor must be 18‚Äì65 years old and should weigh a minimum of 50 kg. * Pulse rate- Between 50 and 100 without irregularities. * Hemoglobin level- A minimum of 12.5 g/dL. * Blood pressure- Diastolic: 50‚Äì100 mm Hg, Systolic: 100‚Äì180 mm Hg. * Body temperature- Should be normal, with an oral temperature not exceeding 37.5 ¬∞C. * The time period between successive blood donations should be more than 3 months. Individuals under certain conditions are deemed ineligible to donate blood: * A person who has been tested HIV positive. * Individuals suffering from ailments like cardiac arrest, hypertension, blood pressure, cancer, epilepsy, kidney ailments and diabetes. * A person who has undergone ear/body piercing or tattoo in the past 6 months. * Individuals who have undergone immunization in the past 1 month. * Individuals treated for rabies or received Hepatitis B vaccine in the past 6 months. * A person who has consumed alcohol in the past 24 hours. * Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. * Individuals who have undergone major dental procedures or general surgeries in the past 1 month. * Women who have had miscarriage in the past 6 months. * Individuals who have had fits, tuberculosis,allergic disorders in the past. * Individuals who currently have asthma with active symptoms, and severe asthma patients. Regulatory mechanisms Human blood is covered under the definition of drug under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. Blood bank activities are regulated under this act and they are required to obtain timely renewal of the license from Drug Controller General for operation and have to comply with the terms presented in the license. It specifies about accommodation, manpower, equipment, supplies and reagents, good manufacturing practices, and process control to be followed in Indian blood transfusion services. The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) was formed in 1992 following the outbreak of AIDS. Following a public interest litigation, a verdict by the supreme court in the case of Common Cause vs. the Union of India in January 1992 led to the establishment of National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) at the federal level and State Blood Transfusion Councils (SBTC) for all the states to review the status of blood transfusion services in the country and conduct annual monitoring visits to blood banks. While the regulatory authority is entrusted with the task of drug regulation, NACO and NBTC are the main technical bodies that frame guidelines for the practice of transfusion medicine. The Government of India in 2002 published the National Blood Policy (NBP) to reiterate the commitment to safe blood and blood components. It documents the strategies for making available adequate resources, technology, and training for improving transfusion services apart from outlining methods for donor motivation and appropriate clinical use of blood by clinicians. It has also taken steps for research and development in transfusion medicine. Organizations India has several blood donation organizations, both governmental and non-governmental. Some major organizations operate in many regions throughout the country while others are regional and operate with local support. Along with conducting blood donation camps, these organizations also raise awareness on voluntary blood donation and public health. Most of the organizations have an online portal where donors can register their details and get updates when camps are organized. Some of the major organizations that conduct blood donation camps are enlisted below. =Federation of Indian Blood Donors Organisations - FIBDO= www.fibdo.org Life Savers Association The Life Savers Association was founded in 2019 and is based in Kolar Gold Fields it is one of the largest blood donation organizations and operates camps throughout Karnataka =Rotary Blood Bank= The Rotary Blood Bank was founded in 2002 and is based in New Delhi.

It conducts blood donation camps and Emergency Blood donation =Other Blood Donor Networks= Apart from governmental and non-governmental organizations, major hospitals in the country have their own blood banks where blood donation is conducted within the facility. Organizations such as BloodConnect, Indian Blood Donors and Friends2support maintain a database of blood donors which facilitate a network between blood donors and organizations/hospitals. National Thalassemia Welfare Society established in 1991 for care and control of Thalassemia is organizing more than 60 camps every year and collecting over 4000 unit per annum. Issues in blood donation Despite a huge population, the demand-supply gap for blood units persists in many healthcare facilities in the country. According to a 2012 report by the World Health Organization, only 9 million blood units are available annually, whereas the demand is 12 million units. Disparities in access of donors in different areas have led to wastage of blood stock in some parts of the country, while at the same time creating a shortage of blood in some other parts. Due to substandard medical facilities and practices in many parts of the country, there have been cases of transmission of infective diseases like AIDS. A study conducted between 2009 and 2013 concluded a high rate of non-compliance on the part of blood banks on the quality and safety of transfusion services. Voluntary blood donation comprises about 70% of the blood demand, with the rest coming from replacement donors, whereas 62 nations in the world fulfill their blood demands through voluntary donations. A study conducted in 2011 reports that a mere 6% of women donate blood, mostly due to physiological problems and low hemoglobin count. Other hurdles in increasing voluntary blood donation include the fear of pain and weakness after the procedure, and illiteracy. = Forced donation = Documented instances of forced blood extraction have occurred in India, among other countries, owing to its disproportionate ratio of available supply of blood and high poverty rate. One such ring gained national attention in 2008 when an emaciated man escaped from his captors near the city of Gorakhpur, in Uttar Pradesh. Blood donation camp in New Delhi Initiatives to encourage blood donation October 1 is celebrated as the national voluntary blood donation day. Blood donation agencies often organize workshops to educate people about the benefits of donating blood. With a huge population of youth, blood donation camps are regularly organized by hospitals and organizations at college campuses. Blood donors and their family members are often given priority in case of emergency or accidents. In 2016, the government launched an initiative called E-RaktKosh, a web-based mechanism that integrates all blood banks in the state into a single network, providing information about blood camps and the availability of blood in hospitals throughout the country.

While Gu was in medical school, he founded a company called Ganogen to develop methods to use fetal tissue implants in organ transplantation. Work at Ganogen had ceased when he started his residency in 2015, but in 2016 he was subpoenaed as CEO of the company by the United States House Select Investigative Panel on Planned Parenthood following the Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy. Gu was one of a group of Twitter users blocked by Donald Trump who sued the President for violating their first amendment rights in Knight First Amendment Institute v. Trump, and won a declaratory judgment on May 2018. Education and training Gu earned his undergraduate degree from Stanford University in 2008 in biology, then earned his M.D. from Duke University School of Medicine in 2015. He started a surgical residency at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in 2015. Vanderbilt put Gu on administrative leave for two weeks in November 2017, and placed him on probation until March 2018. Gu said this was due to his tweets opposing white supremacy; Vanderbilt was unable to comment on personnel matters but stated that the leave was based on Vanderbilt's policies, including those concerning use of social media. Gu received notice from Vanderbilt in May 2018 confirming that his residency contract would not be renewed after the third year of what is usually a five-year residency; the fourth year would have started on July 1, 2018. In a letter addressed to Gu, VUMC cited performance issues‚Äîas it did when he was placed on leave. A May 17 letter to Gu from VUMC General Counsel Michael Regier, which was obtained by the Duke Chronicle, cited \\"lack of sufficient improvement in performance and conduct in key areas.\\" Career While he was in medical school, Gu was awarded a Howard Hughes Medical Institute fellowship to perform research at the Stanford University School of Medicine. He wanted to see if organs from a fetus might be able to adapt to the immune system of a host into which it was transplanted; as a first step he transplanted human fetal hearts and kidneys into immunocompromised rats. In 2012 Gu and Nick K. Chang, who had also gone to Stanford and was a Duke medical student, founded Ganogen, Inc., as a vehicle to further develop these methods. Gu put the work on hold when he started his residency, and took down the company's website after he was harassed in the wake of the Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy. He had decided in early 2016 to convert the company to nonprofit. He put the company's website back up when he learned he had been subpoenaed by Congress in March 2016. As of May 24, 2020, Gu is CEO of Cool Quit,https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugene-gu-md-926560aa a company based in California.

Trump. On May 23, 2018, federal judge Naomi Buchwald ruled that President Trump cannot block his critics on Twitter in violation of the First Amendment. In March 2016, Gu, in his role as CEO of Ganogen, was subpoenaed by the United States House Select Investigative Panel on Planned Parenthood that was created in response to the Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy, to testify about his research involving human fetal tissue. Gu has since spoken out about what he perceives to be the unfair treatment and intimidation of researchers and physicians by the panel, which included the panel releasing the names, addresses, and contact information of people who work with fetal tissue. Gu was recognized by the Union of Concerned Scientists for his response to the panel investigation and criticism from anti-abortion protestors. Controversies In a series of viral tweets, Gu was accused of using a fake Twitter account under the name of Mary Laury to harass her and others. Gu and his wife divorced in October 2015. His wife requested a one- month restraining order against him which was granted in February 2015, based on four allegations of domestic violence dating back to 2013, the last of which involved the police being called and Gu being arrested in February 2015. His ex-wife allowed the restraining order to lapse and the court records were eventually expunged. Responding to Gu's activism against his father, Donald Trump Jr. alleged Gu was a \\"wife beater.\\" Gu denied all allegations of domestic violence.

The work describes the constitution of Classical Athens, commonly called the Areopagite constitution. It was preserved on two leaves of a papyrus codex discovered at Oxyrhynchus, Egypt in 1879. Discovery The Aristotelian text is unique because it is not a part of the Corpus Aristotelicum. It was lost until two leaves of a papyrus codex carrying part of the text were discovered in Oxyrhynchus, Egypt in 1879 and published in 1880.F. Blass, in Hermes 15 (1880:366-82); the text was identified as Aristotle's Athenaion Politeia by T. Bergk in 1881. A second, more extensive papyrus text was purchased in Egypt by an American missionary in 1890. E. A. Wallis Budge of the British Museum acquired it later that year, and the first edition of it by Frederic G. Kenyon was published in January, 1891.Peter John Rhodes. A Commentary on the Aristotelian Athenaion Politeia (Oxford University Press), 1981, 1993: introduction, pp. 2‚Äì5. The editions of the Greek text in widest use today are Kenyon's Oxford Classical Text of 1920 and the Teubner edition by Mortimer H. Chambers (1986, second edition 1994). The papyrus text is now held in the British Library. Ancient accounts of Aristotle credit him with 170 Constitutions of various states; it is widely assumed that these were research for the Politics, and that many of them were written or drafted by his students. Athens, however, was a particularly important state, and where Aristotle was living at the time, therefore it is plausible that, even if students composed the others, Aristotle composed that one himself as a model for the rest. On the other hand, a number of prominent scholars doubt that it was written by Aristotle.e.g., Rhodes, A Commentary on the Aristotelian Athenaion Politeia. If it is a genuine writing of Aristotle, then it is of particular significance, because it is the only one of his extant writings that was actually intended for publication. Because it purports to supply so much contemporary information previously unknown or unreliable, modern historians have claimed that \\"the discovery of this treatise constitutes almost a new epoch in Greek historical study.\\"J. Mitchell and M. Caspari (eds.), p. xxvii, A History of Greece: From the Time of Solon to 403 B.C.\\", George Grote, Routledge 2001. In particular, 21‚Äì22, 26.2‚Äì4, and 39‚Äì40 of the work contain factual information not found in any other extant ancient text.Rhodes, 1981, pp. 29‚Äì30. Synopsis The Constitution of the Athenians (in ancient Greek , Athenaion Politeia) describes the political system of ancient Athens. Some ancient authors, such as Diogenes La√´rtius, state that Aristotle assigned his pupils to prepare a monograph of 158 constitutions of Greek cities (see Loeb Classical Library Vol. 184, p. 474-475), including a constitution of Athens. The work consists of two parts. The first part, from Chapter 1 to Chapter 41, deals with the different forms of the constitution, from the trial of the Alcmaeonidae until 403 BC. The second part describes the city's institutions, including the terms of access to citizenship, magistrates, and the courts. The text was published in 1891 by Frederic George Kenyon. Shortly after, a controversy arose over the authorship of the work that continues today.Michel S√®ve, introduction √† la Constitution d'Ath√®nes, Le Livre de Poche, n¬∞4688, p. 14 et seq.. Composition date In chapter 54, Aristotle relates that the Festival of Hephaestus was \\"instituted during the archonship of Cephisophon\\", which corresponds to 329 BC. In Chapter 62, Aristotle indicates that, at the time he was writing, Athens was still sending officials to Samos. After 322 BC, Samos was no longer under Athenian control. Based on this internal evidence, scholars conclude that the Athenian Constitution was written no earlier than 328 BC and no later than 322 BC. Furthermore, that Aristotle does not mention quinqueremes despite mentioning triremes and quadriremes suggests that it was written no later than 325 BC, when quinqueremes are first recorded in the Athenian Navy.

It was preserved amongst the minor works of Xenophon, though the scholarly consensus is that he did not write it. Its date and authorship have been the subject of much dispute. Authorship Though the treatise was once attributed to Xenophon, amongst whose works it was preserved, it is now taken not to have been his work. The author of the work is sometimes referred to as the Old Oligarch - a name first used by Gilbert Murray. Scholars disagree on the author's political views. Though most see the work as sincere and the author as genuinely oligarchic, some have seen the work as an intellectual exercise by an author who does not sincerely believe the arguments that he advances. Many scholars have tried to identify Pseudo- Xenophon with a known historical figure, though these attempts ‚Äúhave not yielded good results‚Äù. One possible author who has been frequently proposed is Critias, who would become one of the Thirty Tyrants in 404. However, there is little evidence to support this position, and Critias‚Äô philosophy does not seem to match that of the Old Oligarch: for instance, the concept of justice proposed at Constitution 1.2 differs from Critias‚Äô ideas on the subject. Date Dates suggested for the Constitution of the Athenians range from as early as 443 to as late as 406 BC. Most scholars favour a date sometime during the Archidamian War. A frequently cited terminus ante quem for the work is Brasidas‚Äô expedition in 424; this was suggested by Roscher as having disproved the assertion at ¬ß2.5 that land powers could not send expeditionary forces far from home. However, Harold Mattingly argues that the work could in fact postdate this, as Brasidas' expedition was a drastic exception to the rule that land powers did not mount distant expeditions. In fact, Mattingly argues, there is evidence that the work was composed later than is usually thought: he argues that the festival of the Hephaistia, mentioned at ¬ß3.4, was instituted in 421/0 BC, puts the Constitution after Brasidas' expedition. Content After an introduction in which the author lays out his thesis that, though he may dislike the Athenian system of government, he acknowledges that it is well-designed for its own purposes, the Old Oligarch begins to discuss specific aspects of the Athenian system and how they work to advance Athenian democratic interests. The Constitution of the Athenians focuses on the interdependency between Athens‚Äô naval supremacy and its democracy. The author discusses three features he considered characteristic of the Athenian democratic system. These were that the system benefited the common people, that it allowed social vices to be common, and that it was not interested in the pursuit of eunomia (‚Äúgood order‚Äù).

In 1998, Murdock was convicted of three mob hits, sentenced to life imprisonment, but later released on parole in 2011 after he served 13 years in prison. Early life In the 1970s, Murdock's stepfather John Akister had relations with Musitano family boss Dominic Musitano. By the 1980s, Murdock worked as a bouncer at Hamilton strip clubs and also earned money through extortion and armed robbery. In 1984, Murdock built a relationship with Tony Musitano, brother of Dominic, while in jail for armed robbery; Murdock was later paroled in October of that year. Three mob hits Murdock's first mob hit for the family, for $3,000, was on November 21, 1985 on Stelco janitor Salvatore Alaimo who owed gambling money to Dominic Musitano. He used a submachine gun and later told the Star that he had planned only to frighten Alaimo. \\"I actually wasn‚Äôt trying to shoot him. I was trying to shoot all around him...When the thing goes off, it has a mind of its own.\\" On May 31, 1997, Murdock shot mob boss Johnny Papalia in the head in the parking lot of 20 Railway Street outside his vending machine business in Hamilton; he later testified that he had been hired to do so by Angelo and Pat Musitano of the Musitano crime family, who owed Papalia some $250,000. The cost of the hit was substantially less ‚Äî depending on the source, the payment received by Murdock was either $2,000 or $3,000; some reports indicate that Murdock received $2,000 plus 40 grams of cocaine. On July 23, 1997, he shot Carmen Barillaro, the right-hand man of Papalia and a previously convicted drug trafficker, with a 9mm handgun after making the comment, \\"This is a message from Pat\\". The murder occurred in Barillaro's Niagara Falls home after the victim's wife and children had left. Murdock said that Angelo Musitano was waiting in the vehicle outside during this time. The two then left the scene. The motive for the \\"hit\\" was self- protection. Pat was convinced that Barillaro would target him in retribution for the Papalia killing, so he and Murdock acted first. According to Murdock, the Musitano brothers had also been fed up with being a satellite (crew) of the Buffalo crime family and having to pay tribute money to the family. Murdock also claimed that he was waiting for Pat Musitano to approve the murders of four Luppino crime family members Natale Luppino and Vincenzo Luppino (the two sons of Giacomo Luppino) and Domenic Violi and Giuseppe Violi (the two sons of Paolo Violi). In a later interview with journalist Peter Edwards, Murdock claimed that Pat Musitano actually \\"ordered\\" him to enter a coffee house with a machine gun to shoot all of the leaders of the Luppino- Violi group. Musitano's goal was to become the \\"godfather\\" in the Hamilton area, according to Murdock, who said that he did not refuse but never did proceed with the plan. Also revealed by Murdock was that Pat Musitano had discussed with Montreal mob boss Vito Rizzuto and Gaetano Panepinto about Rizzuto investing in Ontario. Eventually, the Canadian intelligence agencies were convinced that the Musitano brothers did not act alone in the murders of Johnny Papalia and Carmen Barillaro. In an interview, Murdock revealed cocaine helped him cope with job stress, but consoles himself with thoughts of the half-dozen killings he was ordered to do, but did not go through with such as sparring professional wrestler and Satan's Choice biker gang member Ion Croitoru and key members of the Luppino crime family.https://books.google.com/books?id=zBbTCwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA105&dq;=pasquale+musitano&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwilufGGj_DUAhUB7oMKHSFCDKYQ6AEIRzAG#v=onepage&q;=pasquale%20musitano&f;=false, p=105 Prison and later life In November 1998, Murdock pleaded guilty to three counts of second degree murder and named Pat and Angelo as the men who had ordered the hits; Murdock was sentenced to life imprisonment. The Musitanos pleaded guilty to conspiracy in Barillaro's death, but no action was taken against them for the murders of Alaimo and Papalia. They received a 10-year sentence in February 2000, but were released in October 2006 on parole. Murdock was unimpressed with the level of justice. > \\"They ordered the killing, and they get just 10 years. They‚Äôll be back on > the streets in less than four. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.\\" In an interview with journalist Peter Edwards, Murdock explained the rationale for his involvement with Angelo and Pat Musitano. He had worked for their father, Domenic Musitano and said that \\"I promised to take care of his kids\\" ... that was the dumbest mistake I ever made\\". Domenic died in 1995. After Murdock had served 13 years in prison, he was granted day parole in December 2011, before full parole in 2014. After release from prison, he relocated to British Columbia and works as a truck driver under his changed surname, Bishop. Further reading *Humphreys, Adrian.

Her 1978 bequest to the British Museum comprised some of the finest netsuke and European decorative arts received by that museum. Early life Anne Ullmann was born in Nuremberg, Germany in 1926 in a Jewish banking family. Forced to emigrate following the advent of the Nazis, her family settled in Northampton. Her father Philipp Ullmann's company Mettoy became famous for its metal toys, including the Corgi line of cars. Collections 19th-century memorial jewellery made from human hair in a case, from the Hull Grundy collection, now in Harrogate Museum. She had family wealth as well as income from the Keyser-Ullmann bank and this enabled Ulmann to collect art from the age of 11, especially ivory, ceramics, metalwork and jewellery. She married John Hull Grundy (1926-1984), an entomologist and artist, in 1949. Shortly thereafter, she was debilitated by a chronic respiratory illness. Her purchases of fine art continued, with trusted dealers bringing the works to her sickbed. In many cases, she bought works via mail. Her focus of collecting became European jewellery and Japanese ivory. A 1976 catalogue of an exhibition of decorative arts at the British Museum (Jewellery through 7000 years) made Grundy realise that the museum's collection ended in the 1700s. She resolved to update their holdings by acquiring 18th and 19th century objects. In 1978 she donated a large part of her collection to the British Museum. This possibly comprised the best of her collections as she had separately donated fine pieces to other museums in the UK, including the Fitzwilliam in Cambridge, Manchester and Glasgow. Some of the major pieces included a 1559 silver roundel by Lambert Suavius commemorating the Peace of Cateau-Cambresis, and silver portrait medallions of Elizabeth I and James I by Simon de Passe. There were also cameos by Italian masters Pistrucci, Berini and Girometti. The value of her donation stemmed from the good documentation of the art works, especially those from European and American engravers and designers. From her Japanese collections were jizai okimono, articulated iron animals, as well as netsuke. Another recipient of Grundy's gift was the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow, which obtained nearly a thousand pieces of jewellery tracing the history of European jewellery over a period of two centuries. This included an Italian miniature Aladdin's lamp brooch from 1860 and English fuchsia gold and ivory drop earrings from 1835. Later life Grundy wrote articles on the decorative arts both for the specialist and the popular press. Between 1958 and 1961 she contributed a 'collectors' column for The Times. Grundy's husband died in 1984. She died the same year.

While resting, Claire meets Luke, a single father and former Canadian hockey player. Forced to retire early from the game due to an injury, Luke now spends his time raising his daughter while running the local ice fishing and tackle shop. This unlikely duo locks horns only to discover they have more in common than they thought. A true man of the Canadian north, Luke teaches Claire all the activities that personify a Canadian winter - from snowmobiling and ice fishing to chopping down a real Christmas tree for the holidays. On her part, Claire encourages Luke - who has not played a game of hockey since being forced to retire - back onto the ice. Together with his former hockey teammates, Luke rouses the town's Christmas spirit when, on Christmas Eve, they engage in a truly Canadian tradition of playing a game of hockey on the ice covered lake.

It is keratinophilic but not known to cause any human disease. It has been isolated from animal dungs, soil, and keratinous surfaces of live or deceased animals. History and taxonomy A. kuehnii was originally discovered and described by Dr. Harold H. Kuehn in 1957. The specimen was obtained from bat dung collected in Georgia, the United States. It was first assigned Arachnoitus reticulatus given its reticulate ascospores that distinguished it from other species in genus Arachniotus. In 1971, after examining different species from Arachniotus and related genera of Gymnoascaceae on laboratory cultures, Arx separated the genus Amauroascus from Arachniotus due to its spherical and ornamental ascospores, and reclassified Arachniotus reticulatus under genus Amauroascus. Since the epithet reticulatus was already occupied in Amauroascus, this species was named A. kuehnii after its discoverer Dr. H Kuehn. This re-classification was accepted in Currah's review of the order Onygenales, but he also noted the similar morphological characteristics of Amauroascus and Auxarthron. A molecular phylogenetic study conducted in 2002 suggested that Amauroascus kuehnii is likely a species complex, and proposed that it be recombined with Auxarthron pseudoreticulatum as Auxarthron kuehnii. The taxonomy issue is controversial because the species' ascospore phenotype is intermediate between Auxarthron and Amauroascus. The consensus remains that the species belongs under Amauroascus without further studies. Growth and morphology =Teleomorph= The sexual form of this fungus produces white spherical dispersed ascomata (cleistothecia), which turn brown as the ascocarps (126-883 ¬µm in diameter) mature. The ascii containing 8 ascospores are oval, and around 10-12√ó7-8 ¬µm in dimension. The spherical, white spores have web-like texture on the surface and are 4-5 ¬µm in diameter. Compared to Amauroascus pseudoreticulatus-patellis which is closely related and has a similar appearance, A. kuehnii has shallower pits on the surface of the spores. Surrounding the ascomata are the peridial hyphae, which appear thin-walled, yellow to pale brown, and septate. In occasion, pigment granules cause the presence of Brown spots. =Anamorph= In the asexual state, A. kuehnii colonies first appear white, with a raised bump in the centre. Arthroconidia formed from smooth, straight, branched pale white hyphae, are around 2.8-8.4√ó2-4 ¬µm in dimension. The fungus grows rapidly in culture. On PDA, colonies are white, sparse and delicate. Reverse of the colonies appears pink with occasional black patches. Cleistothecia appear as white tufts at the periphery of the colony and form a yellow crust, which soon spread throughout the colony. On Sabouraud agar, colonies also appears white, sparse and delicate, whereas reverse appears dull red. Cleistothecia change from white to yellow to light brown over time. On CER under 21-25 ¬∞C, white or pale yellow cottony colonies form and turn granular in older portions. Reverse of the colonies appears uncoloured. On dilute salt acidic medium (DSA) under 25-28 ¬∞C, colonies appear yellow to brown with brown spots adjacent to the hairs. On peptone yeast extract agar (PYE) under 25-35 ¬∞C, colonies are yellow, dense and filamentous with a purplish brown centre and white periphery. Physiology This species has been recorded to possess a distinctive earthy odour. It secretes extracellular keratinase and is a saprotroph on keratinous debris and soil. The fungus also produces a tube precipitin (TP) antigen which is a glycoprotein shared by the pathogenic fungus Coccidioides immitis. Habitat and ecology A. kuehnii is a rare fungus found in North America and Mexico, with a few reports from Europe. Due to the limited available isolates, conclusion of its habitat cannot be drawn. Although it was mostly discovered in lizard or bat dung and keratinous soil, strains have been isolated from keratinous surfaces of animals such as fowl and deer horns. None of the species in Amauroascus is known to be a pathogen of animals, and no strains have been isolated from humans.

The basis of the geological structure of the area is complex Jurassic Lower Cretaceous flysch formation and a late sedimentary- volcanic complex. These rocks are intruded by Late Cretaceous acidic and intermediate intrusions including quartz dioritic porphyrites. Tectonic structures are widely developed on a N-S axis with subsidiary, NW, and WNW faults. Practically all are mineralized, with economic mineralization controlled by NW and N-S structures. The Leningradskaya zone is confined to a 45-50 ¬∞ NE orientation thrust. Explored resources are confined to the Leningradskaya, Sobolinaya and Nezhdannaya zones (82.6%). Six large and medium scale and numerous small ore bodies were identified. These are cassiterite-silicate ore units of cassiterite-tourmaline mineral type, similar to other deposits in the district. Morphologically they are quartz-tourmaline impregnated vein bodies dipping 60-48¬∞ except for the Leningradskaya zone and a part of the Nezhdannaya zone. The degree of metasomatic alteration of rocks increases closer to the Leningradskaya area to the west. Host rocks for the upper parts of the ore zones are the Upper Cretaceous sediments and the volcanic rocks in the richer lower Jurassic terrigenous deposit. Mineralisation along strike and dip ranges from tens to several hundreds of meters. Thickness from 0.2 ‚Äì 18.0m, average: 4.4m. Ore zones are similar in material composition and represented by the same mineral assemblages: quartz-tourmaline, quartz-cassiterite, quartz- sulphide, and supergene assemblages. Mineralisation is very similar to other regional tin deposits. 40 minerals were studied for tin associated components- 1323 integrated, 18 group and 143 mono-mineral samples. Oxidized ores 9.4% (in C1+C2 resources) Minerals: cassiterite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, wolframite, pyrite, cellular-pyrite Non-metallics: quartz-tourmaline, carbonates, chlorite, sericite. 85-90% of tin is presented by cassiterite, mainly quartz associated and is concentrated in lower structural floor ‚Äì Jurassic sandstone and shale: Cassiterite in developed sulphide mineralization in upper floor of cretaceous volcanites is corroded by sulphides forming stannite and hydro-stannite. - showing vertical zonation in the distribution of mineral assemblages that form ore bodies.  Resources  10.461 million tonnes of ore were registered with the State Reserves Commission (GKZ) in 1987 of which 4.366 million tonnes were categorised as C1 (Measured) and 6.098 as C2 (Indicated). The C1 resources has grades of 1.07% Sn and 0.62% Cu, while C2 resources have grades of 0.74% Sn and 0.43% Cu. (Average grades are 0.88% Sn and 0.53% Cu). Associated minerals are Tungsten at 0.065%, Bismuth, Indium, Silver.  Ownership  In late 2012 a Moscow-based company, Zaibaikalskaya Gornorundnaya Kompaniya, using a commercial trading name \\"Sable Tin Resources\\", acquired the Sobolinoye License at a State Auction. The License is a mining license valid until the end of 2032.

He started the first radio program that broadcast live sports events in 1958 on Radio Televizioni Shqiptar, the Rubrika Sportive, a show that continues to this day, and later did the same on the Albanian television. He has been a successful screenwriter with movies such as Pas gjurm√´ve (), winner of the international Giffoni Film Festival, Italy, in 1979. Life and work Skifter K√´lli√ßi was born on January 17, 1938 in Tirana, Albania, where he finished his secondary studies in 1955. In 1959, he graduated from the University of Tirana in Albanian Language and Literature, and started working as a journalist and a sports' commentator at the Radio Televizioni Shqiptar, where he had already interned, starting from 1958. He pioneered a very well known radio show, called Rubrika sportive, which would comment on the sports events of the weekend. Later, K√´lli√ßi would start the same show in the Albanian Television, thus becoming the first anchorman of this show, which still continues today. Because of a long political persecution during the years 1975-1985, K√´lli√ßi could no longer host the Rubrika sportive show in the Albanian television. He returned as an anchorman in 1985, but was again politically persecuted in 1986, and disappeared once more from the screens. Along with Anton Mazreku, and Ismet Bellova, K√´lli√ßi is considered one of the most renowned sports commentators in the Albanian speaking world. K√´lli√ßi has also been successful in creative and nonfiction writing, a field in which he has published more than 20 books, consisting of short stories, novels, as well as screenplays. Among them are children's novels like 'Kujtimet e m√´hall√´s s√´ vjet√´r' (), (1967), and 'Pas gjurm√´ve' (), (1972). The later was the basis for K√´lli√ßi's screenplay of the movie with the same title, which won the Prize of the President of the Italian Republic at the International Giffoni Film Festival, Italy in 1979, and 'Shp√´rthimi' () (1983), on whose motives he also wrote the screenplay of the movie 'Fush√´ e blert√´, fush√´ e kuqe' ()(1985). Among his novels the most successful ones have been those with historical motives such as 'Atentat ne Paris' (), 1978 (which was republished with significant changes me 2011), 'Vras√´s me duar te bardha (), 1991, 'Dashuri e gdhendur ne shkemb\\" () (2004), where he represents Illyria of year 9 A.D. in its revolt against Roman Empire, led by Tiberius, the son of Octavian, Roman Emperor. According to critics, the book has a well framed Albanian national vision. In 2010 K√´lli√ßi published the novel \\"Shtatori i gj√´m√´s s√´ madhe\\" (), (2010), dedicated to the September 11 attacks on the Twin Towers in New York City, which, among its 3,000 victims, included three Albanian-Americans, personified in the novel. A year later he published \\"Politikan√´t m√´katar√´ fluturojn√´ n√´ Mars\\" ()), (2011), a sarcastic novel with characters that are not difficult to spot from the Albanian political scene, where they are shown to be utterly corrupted. Among his work as a publicist a special mention is deserved by 'Futbolli Shqiptar' (), (1988), which he co-authored with Belgian sports journalist, Serge Van Hoof, \\"Nga 2-3-5, n√´ 4-4-2,v√´shtrim historik mbi evoluimin e sistemeve taktike t√´ futbollit shqiptar, (1930-1987)\\", ()(1987) and 'Historia e Radiotelevizionit Shqiptar,(1930-1990)', ()(2003).

Through the past centuries the caves have been used by Icelandic farmers as sheep sheds, barns and, food storage. Nobody knows for certain who made them and for what purpose. However, throughout the centuries the people of √Ügiss√≠√∞a have said the caves were built before the Viking settlement. Most likely by Celtic monks.  General  The first written source about a man-made sand cave can be found in Jarteinab√¶kur √ûorl√°ks helga that was written in 1199.Jarteinab√≥k √ûorl√°ks biskups 1199,4. kafli The story is about bulls inside a cave that collapses. The story focuses on the bulls and not the cave, which indicates that at that time it was not unusual to use man-made caves to store animals as early as the 12 century. Before the 19th century Icelanders used to live in turf houses. These houses only lasted a century and had to be rebuilt after that. Therefore it was convenient to use the caves. This also means that the caves are, by far, the oldest standing ‚Äúbuildings‚Äù in Iceland. Entrance to Cow Shed Cave According to Landn√°mab√≥k and √çslendingab√≥k, Celtic monks from Ireland known as papar lived in Iceland before Scandinavian vikings settled in Iceland. Many Icelandic scholars have pointed out that the caves might have been built before the Viking settlement. Other scholars have denied these theories on the grounds that no archaeological remains have been found that proof that the papar were in Iceland before the island was settled around 874. The caves are protected by law, as national heritage.  The Caves of Hella or √Ügiss√≠√∞a  The first written sources of the caves in √Ügiss√≠√∞a are in a poem from the late 18th century, where the author names eighteen caves at √Ügiss√≠√∞a. In 1818 a priest in Oddi writes about the caves at √Ügiss√≠√∞a and emphasis in his writings that the caves are very old. Although over 200 man-made caves can be found in the southern part of Iceland, it is unheard of to find as many caves together as at √Ügiss√≠√∞a. Twelve caves have been found at √Ügiss√≠√∞a. The most recent one found in 2016. The most famous cave is Fj√≥shellir or Cow Shed Cave as it is one of the biggest man-made sand caves that has been found in Iceland. Furthermore, a cross can be found embossed in one of the walls at Fj√≥shellir. Nobody knows who made the cross and what for. Another cave bears the interesting name ‚Äòthe Church‚Äô. It used to have a beautifully rounded ceiling before water damaged demolished it. Also, an unusual 25 meter long tunnel can be found between two of the largest caves Barn Cave and Lamb Shed Cave. The caves are all beautifully handmade and their original structure is clearly visible where water damage has not taken its toll. The descendants of √Ügiss√≠√∞a have always believed that the caves date back to the settlement and believe they are the handy work of Celts.  The name, √Ügiss√≠√∞a  The name of the farm can be found in written source from 1270.  Modern interest  Cow Shed Cave For centuries the caves have been a source of interest for many people both foreign and Icelandic and many found their mystery interesting. Many school trips stopped at √Ügiss√≠√∞a and, well known historians, writers and poets wrote about the caves. In the 1970s and early 1980s, The caves were a common very popular tourist attraction and could be found in most almost all tourist books. The Icelandic poet and lawyer Einar Benediktsson was very interested in the caves and was one of the key figures in exploiting the theories about the Irish monks building them. Later on the Icelandic writer √û√≥rbergur √û√≥r√∞arson investigated the caves. He disagreed with Einar Benediktsson about the origin of the caves. Matth√≠as √û√≥r√∞arson, the director of the National museum of Iceland came to the conclusion that the caves were ancient but nothing suggested they were made before Iceland was settled. Einar Benediktsson had his friend and painter J√≥hannes Kjarval sketch the cave murals. The Icelandic poet and priest, Matth√≠as Jochumsson held a mass in one of the caves known as Kirkjuhellir or Church-cave (named for his similarity to an old church). The caves at √Ügiss√≠√∞a are a part of Yrsa Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir's first crime novel, Last Rituals, and the sand caves are also mentioned in Bl√≥√∞ug j√∂r√∞ by Vilborg Dav√≠√∞sd√≥ttir. But interest in the caves is not only found with Icelanders. In 1936 the Ahnenerbe (a Nazi institute that investigated the history of the Aryan race) organised an expedition to Iceland to investigate ancient temples. When they arrived they got thrilled by the man-made caves and assumed that they might have been an ancient Hof. All investigations were drawn to a halt because of World War II. However, farmers stopped utilizing the caves and repairing their entrances, when it came cheeper and easier to build concrete houses to store animals and food. In the past five decades many cave have stood open to winds, rain and snow damage. The caves were closed to the public until recently. In 2016 descendants of √Ügiss√≠√∞a gathered all know information, written and oral stories, about the caves. The farmers also restoring the caves in order to protect them from weather damage and make them accessible to tourists. Interestingly, in 2017, they discovered a new 25 meter long cave and a new 6 meter long side cave while digging out a part of cave which has not been full of mold for centuries.

Neoclassical architecture developed in many Russian cities, first of all St. Petersburg, which was undergoing its transformation into a modern capital throughout the reign of Catherine II.

Quarenghi Origin of the style = Background = Belonging to the European cosmopolitan class of the 18th century, Catherine had set the tone of Russian social and intellectual life during her long reign.Lionel Kochan, The Making of Modern Russia, London, 1962, p.145 The Catherinian Era was a turning point in terms of the education of nobility, particularly in the fields of art and literature. French became the court language, and along with the language came the ideas of Enlightenment as well.L. Kochan, p. 147 Her embrace of the neo- classicism current linked her capital to ancient Rome, and this phenomenon was particularly encouraged by poetic allusions to St. Petersburg as similar to the ancient city, and the empress as the goddess Minerva. These Roman references must have galvanized her ideas, finally declaring in a letter to Frau Johanna Dorothea Bielcke (1770): > '' Augustus said that he found Rome built of brick and would leave it built > of marble; I say that I found Petersburg virtually wooden and will leave its > buildings dressed in marble. Scholars recognize that, regardless of the motivation, Catherine found in architecture an embodiment for her aspirations, particularly the so-called Greek Project, which aimed to take Istanbul to recreate a new \\"Christian Byzantium\\". According to William Brumfield, the neoclassical revival in Russian architecture was an \\"expression of nostalgia for bygone cultural values, and a reformulated sense of imperial monumentality.\\" = The beginnings = In 1762, the Empress had ordered the construction of the palace of Oranienbaum, and on that occasion Antonio Rinaldi had built the Chinese Palace (1762‚Äì1768) (which presented a mixture of elements of Baroque architecture, of classicism and of traditional Chinese architecture), and the pavilion Katalnaya Gorka (or \\"rollercoaster\\") (1762‚Äì1774). In this cylindrical pavilion, which had 3 branching wings, a dome and a triumphal arch with a tower ending in a spire, the search for new compositional schemes can be observed.Emil Kaufmann, Architecture in the Age of Reason ‚Äì Baroque and Postbaroque in England, Italy, and France, 1955, Harvard University Press, p. 142 In 1763 Catherine commissioned the French architect Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe and the Russian Alexander Kokorinov for the construction of the new headquarters of the Academy of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg. In 1766, De La Mothe became the official court architect. From 1764, the Academy was directed by the philanthropist and councilor for education of Catherine Ivan Betskoy. In those years, the empress and Betskoy, who had been a regular patron of a public education system in Russia, had conceived the ambitious project to build an orphanage in Moscow. This idealistic experiment, inspired by the Enlightenment movement, was aimed at creating the \\"ideal citizen\\" through the recovery of thousands of orphans who were to receive an adequate education. The project of the orphanage was given to Karl Blank who, trained at the school of Bartolomeo Rastrelli, was the architect who had built the first neoclassical buildings in Moscow, including said orphanage.  The 1770s: new impulses  In 1773, the Empress wrote a letter to the Academy of France, announcing a contest which asked the architects to design a house in which they were present, at the same time, forms of both Greek and Roman antiquities.Dmitry Shvidkovsky, Russian Architecture and the West, New Haven (Connecticut), Yale University Press, 2007, Two French academics, Charles de Wailly and Charles-Louis Cl√©risseau, sent their drawings, but these were not welcomed positively. Hence, in 1778, Catherine said she wanted to hire two Italian architects, since \\"the Frenchmen we have here know too much and build dreadful houses ‚Äì because they know too much.\\"D. Shvidkovsky, cit., p.254 In 1779, she commissioned her ministers, Baron Friedrich Melchior and Johann Friedrich Reiffenstein, who at that time were representatives of the Russian Academy of Arts of St. Petersburg in Rome, to find the two architects. The same year, two Italians architects, and Giacomo Quarenghi, arrived at the court of Catherine.Christoph Frank,Appendice documentaria sul viaggio in Russia di Giacomo Quarenghi e Giacomo Trombara nell'anno 1779, in Nicola Navone e Letizia Tedeschi (a cura di), Dal mito al progetto. La cultura architettonica dei maestri italiani e ticinesi nella Russia neoclassica, vol. 1, Mendrisio, Edizioni dell‚ÄôAccademia di architettura, 2004, Within a few years, neoclassicism in Russia, which in its first phase had drawn ideas from the French architecture of the mid-eighteenth century, turned its attention to the interpretive experiences of the Palladian architecture, especially of England and Italy.D. Shvidkovsky, p. 289.  The 1780s: Giacomo Quarenghi  At the invitation of Catherine's agents in 1779, Giacomo Quarenghi arrived in St. Petersburg along with the Scottish architect Charles Cameron.Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600‚Äì1840, IV edition, Yale University Press, 2008, p.212 He was a renowned neoclassical architect, having studied in Rome with Anton Raphael Mengs, among other artists and architects who helped shape his interest and expertise in Palladian architecture. Together with Cameron, he first worked on the Catherine Palace located in the Tsarskoye Selo. Specifically, this entailed the construction of a two-story gallery (Cameron's Gallery). Between 1781 and 1796, it was the turn of the palace of Paul I in Pavlovsk which, in its original version, became one of the first examples of Palladian villa built in Russia.D. Shvidkovsky, p. 260. But if Cameron had been successful for the display of his fanciful polychrome, the heirs of Catherine Paul and Maria Feodorovna forced him to absolute sobriety, so at Pavlovsk became prominent the use of white and gold. However, Cameron could not comply to the impositions of the new taste. Between 1786 and 1789 Cameron's duties in Pavlovsk passed to the Italian Vincenzo Brenna, hired by Paul in 1782.D. Shvidkovsky, p. 284 In the meantime Quarenghi became the official architect of Catherine II, and between the 1780 and 1785 transformed St. Petersburg into a classical city.Mario Praz, Gusto neoclassico, Rizzoli, Milano, 1974, p. 208. As first assignment, in 1779 Catherine commissioned architect of Bergamo the task of introducing the neoclassical style in the Peterhof Palace. The intervention was performed in the southwest of the Top Park , where he was made the English Park and in its interior the English Palace ,The palace was destroyed by the Germans during the World War II which became the model to which inspire in Russia up to the beginning of 19th century for the villas in the countryside. Between 1782 and 1785 he built the Hermitage Theatre whose interior is inspired by the Teatro Olimpico of Vicenza and for the decorations and the capitals by the ruins of the Theatre of Pompey. Later, between 1787 and 1792, in the Winter Palace Quarenghi had designed and built a place that was the exact replica of the Raphael's Loggia located in the Apostolic Palace in Vatican City,Antonio Paolucci, Raffaello Sanzio a San Pietroburgo per ordine della zarina, L'Osservatore Romano, 18 maggio 2009 here were then inserted the copies of the drawings of the ceilings. Copies of which were commissioned in 1778 by the Empress to von Grimm who, through Reiffenstein, did reproduce in Rome copies of life-sized vault; the encaustic paintings were made by Christoforo Unterperger. In 1783, Quarenghi designed the Palace of the State Bank on the Griboyedov Canal, given the importance of the building, the author gives the monument a majestic appearance. Different was the architect's attitude in the most sober Academy of Sciences (1783‚Äì1789) where the outside, unadorned, is marked by a heavy porch in Ionic order and in the inside the elegant proportions and the solemnity of the spaces remind the taste of ancient Rome.D. Shvidkovsky, p. 262 In those years Quarenghi was also busy, after the interventions of the Russian architect Karl Blank and Francesco Camporesi, to complete the Catherine Palace in Moscow (1790‚Äì1797). Quarenghi had built numerous palaces and brought into vogue an original monumental style, of Palladian inspiration, which was a reference for many architects who worked in Russia, among them Ivan Starov that, for the Prince Potemkin, created the Tauride Palace. The building, consisting of a main building and two adjoining wings complemented by side pavilions, in perfect adherence to the Palladian villa type, served as a model for innumerable manors scattered across the Russian Empire. Nikolay Lvov's architecture represented the second, \\"strict\\" generation of neoclassicism stylistically close to Giacomo Quarenghi.V. K. Shuisky, Zolotoy vek barocco i classicizma v Sankt-Peterburge (–ó–æ–ª–æ—Ç–æ–π –≤–µ–∫ –±–∞—Ä–æ–∫–∫–æ –∏ –∫–ª–∞—Å—Å–∏—Ü–∏–∑–º–∞ –≤ –°–∞–Ω–∫—Ç-–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥—É), 2008 , p. 128 The polymath architect, among other things, had translated into Russian the treatise I quattro libri dell'architettura by Palladio.  The period of Paul I (1796‚Äì1801) Catherine the Great died in 1796, and her son Paul became Emperor; but he had shown signs of mental instability, and it did not last long. His reforms had limited the rights of the nobility, and in 1801 he was assassinated by a group of conspirators, including his son Crown Prince Alexander.L. Kochan, p. 151-152 The most significant innovation was the change of taste of which the best example has been reflected in the care of the interior of the Pavlovsk Palace, that the sovereign had chosen as a dwelling. The emperor's wife Maria Feodorovna had tried to introduce into his home the refinements she had known in her visit to France in 1782.M.

It was produced by Almost Red Productions (company owned by the directors in China) in association with the Spanish company Arkadin Ediciones. Scene of Floating Melon (Fu Guo) in Chengdu, with Vincent Chen Xi and Wen Sirui. According to the directors, the main difficulty in the production was the casting. \\"It was complicated to find a group of suitable actor that were interested in play gay characters and also were not scared of play some explicit scenes. Finally we collaborate with non professional actors. Also the production maintained a low profile to avoid the strong censhorship laws in China.\\" The directors comment about the film in these terms: Floating Melon is a fiction film, but inspired by characters that are present in the Chinese contemporary society. It reflects, with a film ‚Äúnoir genre‚Äù perspective in stylistic and narrative terms, the story of a young guy that cannot react in a situation that is beyond his imaginations. He needs to take a decision that will risk his future, consequence of the strict rules of the society, since he is surrounded by the confusion present on some of members of the young gay Chinese community, with no moral referents apart from the official doctrine. Picture of Floating Melon (Fu Guo) with Vincent Chen Xi, Cinematography Guo Yong. The representation of the characters is very close to reality and their reactions towards the situations reflect the Chinese society of these days. Also it represents this invisible community, the LGBT, that it is not as persecuted as in other countries, but for family pressures and the lack of protective laws, it need to be self protected. This lack of referents make for some people to take unusual and in occasions dangerous routes to build their relationships. Music Floating Melon original soundtrack is composed by Andrea Centazzo.

The music guides the emotional journey of the character through the film, following the first moments of horror and confusion, until the last part, where bring us a more nostalgic atmosphere. Centazzo composed some experimental tracks for the beginning sequences, mixing sound effects, electronic music and real instruments.

This was the only castle in Normandy that William did not succeed in taking. Hubert was moved to action by the cause of Fulk IV, Count of Anjou, and Hugh V, Count of Maine. He was supported by Robert of Nevers, Baron of Craon, son of Renauld I, Count of Nevers, and uncle of Hubert's wife Ermengarde de Nevers. During the siege, William built a huge military camp known as Beugy on the outskirts of the town, taking advantage of Roman earthworks. William's garrison was under the command of Alan Rufus from 1083 to 1085. William, Count of √âvreux, participated in the siege and was taken captive in 1085. It is not clear under what terms he was released, but somewhat later he forfeited significant holdings. Richer d'Aigle, son-in-law of Richard le Goz, Viscount of Avranches, died in the siege, mortally wounded by an arrow to the eye, and was buried at the monastery of Saint-Sulpice. Orderic Vitalis records that in January 1086, William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey, wanting to avenge Richer's death, unsuccessfully attacked the castle. He was accompanied by Richer's brother Gilbert l'Aigle and Baudry II de Guitry. Robert de Vieux-Pont was also killed in the siege but it is unclear which side he supported. With the siege faltering as the castle turned out to be exceptionally well-defended, Alan Rufus eventually turned over command to another Breton who was later killed. With many knights killed or captured, William eventually came to terms with the rebels, with Hubert being restored to favor.

After 1880, his Lilliputian Opera Company included other juvenile performers and developed an extensive and highly successful program of performances of comic opera and musical items, travelling throughout Australia and New Zealand. Gillian Arrighi and Victor Emeljanow suggest that the genesis of the juvenile performance of opera, of which the Pollard troupe was but one manifestation, can be found in Richard D'Oyly Carte's experiment with a children's performance of HMS Pinafore over the London Christmas season of 1879‚Äì1880. The novelty of talented youngsters performing theatre and variety \\"transmitted ...ideas about youth and empire, cleverness and the future\\" and made this form of theatre extremely popular.G. Arrighi & V. Emeljanow (Eds) (2014) Entertaining Children: The Participation of Youth in the Entertainment Industry, Chapter 3, Palgrave MacMillan US, Dr Clay Djubal suggests it was a Melbourne juvenile performance of HMS Pinafore that influenced Pollard. Years later, Daphne Trott (who like many of the performers adopted the surname Pollard as a stage name) recalled; \\"As a child actress... I had to know thirty six operas by heart. Once I played the part of an old sheriff with side-whiskers, although I was only twelve at the time.

Pollard's Juvenile Opera Company operated in Australian and New Zealand, run by Tom O'Sullivan, who changed his surname to Pollard after marrying Emily Pollard. In 1909, another member of the family, Arthur Hayden Pollard, raised a juvenile company to tour India via Ceylon and Malaya. However, following complaints about Arthur's treatment of the children and allegations of an inappropriately close association with one young performer, an Indian court withdrew his custody and the tour ended in confusion and chaos.\\"THE POLLARD OPERA COMPANY\\" Truth (Brisbane) Sunday 8 May 1910, Page 10, Retrieved 10 December 2016\\"THE POLLARD LILLIPUTIAN CO\\" The Daily News (Perth) Wed 9 Mar 1910, Page 7, Retrieved 10 December 2016 In November 1910, the Australian Government passed legislation that required all children travelling outside the Commonwealth to hold a permit to do so.

Stevenson (born 1956 or 1957) is an American sports marketing executive. A graduate of Duke University and George Washington University, he helped start The Golf Channel, developed the business plan for the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), and launched Pac-12 Networks. He built a consulting firm, OnSport, that crafted the Wachovia Championship and put together the NASCAR Nationwide Series. After 10 years, he sold OnSport to Wasserman Media Group for a reported $25 million. Since 2013, he has been president and managing director of MLS Business Ventures, a division of Major League Soccer. Stevenson has also served as an independent director for Kilroy Realty Corporation, a publicly traded real estate investment trust, since 2014. Background and education Gary Stevenson, the youngest of Robert and Eleanor Stevenson's four children, grew up in Elyria, Ohio, a bedroom community of Cleveland. He graduated from Elyria High School, where he was a two-sport athlete in football and basketball, in 1974; Stevenson was inducted into the Elyria Sports Hall of Fame in 1996. He earned his BA from Duke University and completed an MBA from George Washington University in 1982. Career Stevenson started his sports marketing career in Houston in 1980 at ProServ, one of the earliest sports management firms. When two partners in the company, Frank Craighill and Lee Fentress, left in 1983 to form competitor Advantage International, taking about 50 clients with them, Stevenson followed. As vice president in charge of marketing at Advantage International, he developed business opportunities for clients John Elway, John McEnroe, Moses Malone, Hana Mandl√≠kov√°, and Dan Marino, among others. =Golf and basketball= Stevenson left Advantage International in 1987 for his first in- house role with a sports league, the PGA Tour. There he eventually became executive vice president of business affairs. At the end of 1994, Stevenson moved to The Golf Channel as executive vice president and chief operating officer, responsible for overseeing day-to-day operations. The channel debuted in January 1995, but struggled to get cable systems to carry it. In August it abandoned its original $6.95-a-month subscriber fee for a price structure that allowed cable operators to sell it bundled with basic cable, as part of a tier, or as premium channel at a cost of $3.95 to $6.95 a month. In September, with the channel forecasting a $40 million loss for the year, and its long- term future uncertain, Stevenson resigned to pursue other business opportunities. In February 1996, David Stern, the commissioner of the National Basketball Association (NBA), brought Stevenson in as a consultant on two projects, a summer league and a women's league. Stevenson co-drafted the original business plan for the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), pitched the projects to owners, and, said Stern, was \\"instrumental in getting the WNBA off the ground\\". In August, NBA Properties, the marketing arm of the NBA, tapped Stevenson for president of its marketing and media group, located in New York City. For the next year he oversaw marketing, sponsorship, and media sales for the NBA, WNBA, and USA Basketball. =OnSport= Raleigh, North Carolina businessman Frank Daniels III, a friend of Stevenson since their Duke University undergraduate days, was forming Total Sports, an online sports information venture. He persuaded Stevenson to join its board of directors in May 1997. In August, Stevenson left NBA Properties. He moved his family to Raleigh and parlayed his industry knowledge, experience, and contacts into his own media and sponsorship consultancy. Stevenson and his agency, which eventually settled on the name OnSport, had a reputation for forthrightness. Rick Welts, a colleague of his at the NBA and a partner in the agency before he left to be president and chief operating officer of the Phoenix Suns, said \\"He's never shy about offering an opinion, even if it's not politically correct\\". This assessment was echoed by Frank Daniels III, who said, \\"His great talent is that he is very direct ... He gives recommendations based on what he feels, not what he thinks clients want to hear.\\" Total Sports, with flat revenues and heavy startup costs, foundered as the dot-com bubble collapsed, but OnSport continued to grow. Casey Wasserman joined as a partner in 2001, then left a year later to found Wasserman Media Group. OnSport's employee count rose to 18 and revenue approached the mid-seven figures in 2004. OnSport specialized in strategic planning around TV sports rights and sponsorship packages. It worked with Stevenson's former employers, the PGA Tour and the NBA, as well as with other sports properties such as Major League Soccer (MLS), the Pac-10 conference, and the U.S. Tennis Association. Among its corporate clients were American Express, Coke, Nationwide, and Wachovia. For the latter, OnSport built a PGA Tour event, the Wachovia Championship, from the ground up. OnSport also put together the NASCAR Nationwide Series. In June 2007, Stevenson sold OnSport to his former partner's company, Wasserman Media Group, reportedly for $25 million. He remained with the combined company until September 2010. At the same time as running OnSport, Stevenson taught a course on the business of sport at his alma mater, Duke University. =Collegiate sports and soccer= The collegiate Pac-10 added two schools to become the Pac-12 Conference in July 2011. Later the same month they announced plans to launch a national TV network and six regional cable networks. Commissioner Larry Scott, impressed with what Stevenson had done with OnSport, turned to him in August to head a new subsidiary, Pac-12 Enterprises. It would oversee three companies: Pac-12 Networks, which would be responsible for the national TV network, six regional cable networks, and relationships with existing network partners ESPN and Fox Sports; Pac-12 Digital Network, which would cover streaming, mobile, and internet presence; and Pac-12 Properties, which would handle all sponsorship, licensing and event management. Stevenson moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to be near Pac-12 headquarters in Walnut Creek. The first employee of Pac-12 Enterprises, he assembled a staff of 130. They found 70,000 square feet of space in San Francisco, and by August 2012 built a network studio and offices there (using over 100 different contractors), developed broadcasting infrastructure on 12 campuses, scheduled up to 850 broadcasts for the first year, and negotiated carriage agreements with cable providers that made the content available to 48 million homes at launch. In April 2013, eight months after the successful launch of Pac-12's seven networks, Stevenson stepped down. In June, he was named president and managing director of MLS's new business unit, New York-based MLS Business Ventures. There he \\"oversees the domestic and international commercial business of MLS which includes Soccer United Marketing (SUM), media and broadcasting, digital, club services, marketing, consumer products, special events and content creation and distribution.\\" References Further reading * American sports businesspeople American chief operating officers Major League Soccer executives National Basketball Association league office executives Duke University alumni George Washington University School of Business alumni People from Elyria, Ohio 1957 births Living people ","title":"Gary R.

It is a small, erect, twiggy shrub with leaves composed of three leaflets, and clusters of small white flowers with four petals and four stamens. It usually grows as an understorey shrub in eucalypt woodland. Description Zieria minutiflora is an erect, twiggy shrub which grows to a height of about . The branches are hairy at first but become glabrous with age. Its leaves are composed of three leaflets with the middle leaflet long and wide. The leaf stalk is long. The upper surface of the leaves has scattered hairs and the lower surface is covered with soft hairs. The leaflets have a rounded or sometimes a notched end . The flowers are white to pale pink or cream-coloured and are arranged singly or in groups of up to three in leaf axils. The groups are shorter than the leaves. The four sepal lobes are about long and the four petals are long and covered with short, branched hairs. In common with other zierias there are only four stamens. Flowering occurs from November to May and is followed by fruit which is a glabrous follicle composed of up to four sections joined at the base and which burst open to release their seeds when ripe. Taxonomy and naming Zieria minutiflora was first formally described in 1926 by Karel Domin from a specimen collected near the Glasshouse Mountains. (The species was first described by Ferdinand von Mueller as Boronia minutiflora but the name was not validly published.) The specific epithet (minutiflora) is derived from the Latin words minutus meaning \\"little\\" or \\"small\\" and flora meaning \\"flowers\\". Two subspecies have been described: *Zieria minutiflora Dominsubsp. minutiflora which has a glabrous ovary and fruit; *Zieria minutiflora subsp. trichocarpa J.A.Armstr. which has a hairy ovary and fruit and only occurs in Queensland. Distribution and habitat Twiggy zieria mainly occurs north from Coffs Harbour in New South Wales and as far north in Queensland as Danbulla National Park and State Forest on the Atherton Tableland. It usually grows in eucalypt forest and woodland but also occurs in rocky coastal areas.

After being reelected in 2018, he resigned in March 2019 after refusing to cooperate with an ethics investigation into 1983 charges against him for sexually molesting two boys. A member of the Republican Party, Stringer has been co-chair of the GOP finance committee for Yavapai County, in addition to a Republican precinct committeeman and state committeeman. Education Stringer is a graduate of George Washington University and the University of Baltimore School of Law. He earned an MA in curriculum and instruction from Arizona State University in 2018. Political career Prior to running for state office, Stringer was elected as a Republican precinct committeeman and state committeeman for Yavapai County, and had been co-chair of the county's GOP finance committee. In 2016, Stringer and incumbent Noel W. Campbell won the two seats in the Republican primary for district 1 of the Arizona House of Representatives, defeating Yavapai County Supervisor Chip Davis. They went on to defeat Democratic candidate Peter Pierson and Green candidate Haryaksha Gregor Knauer in the general election. =Allegations and Resignation= In early 2018, Stringer had been recorded as saying that sex trafficking was not a concern and that, \\"I don't like to demonize it.\\" In June 2018, during a livestreamed speech at the Yavapai County Republican Men's Forum, Stringer commented that \\"there aren't enough white kids to go around\\", in reference to public school integration. He went on to say that illegal immigration is \\"politically destabilizing\\" and is \\"an existential threat to the United States\\". Stringer's comments were derided as racist by the Anti- Defamation League and ProgressNow Arizona, while the Arizona Republican Party and denounced his comments. Stringer defended his statements by saying he \\"wasn't making a value judgement\\" and \\"wasn't denigrating anybody\\", while apologizing to anyone he offended. In November 2018, Stringer was pressured to resign from leadership positions in House committees due to remarks made to Arizona State University students following a presentation at a political history and leadership club. Stringer stated that when European immigrants come to the United States that \\"After the second or third generation, everybody looks the same, everybody talks the same. But that's not the case with African Americans and other racial groups, because they don't melt in, they don't blend in.\\" Stringer subsequently resigned from his position as chair of the House Sentencing and Recidivism Reform Committee. On December 4, the Prescott City Council voted six to one to pass a resolution \\"that demands Stringer step down immediately so that a replacement can be named before the legislative session begins in 2019\\", which was supported by the mayor. However, he ran to keep his seat and was reelected in the general election, coming in second after fellow incumbent Noel Campbell and defeating Democrats Jan Manolis and Ed Gogek. On January 25, 2019, the Phoenix New Times reported that Stringer had been charged in 1983 with five sex offenses, including two child pornography charges, while he was living in Baltimore. He had accepted a plea bargain on charges of paying two boys for sex, one of whom was developmentally disabled, and was sentenced to five years' probation. In 1990, he had the charges expunged from his record. In response to calls for his resignation, Stringer confirmed that he had been arrested and charged with the offenses but stated that he would not be resigning from the Arizona House. On March 27, 2019, facing a deadline to hand over documents regarding his 2018 comments and the 1983 sex offenses, he abruptly resigned from the Arizona House.

Richardson was born to Issac E. and Susan M. B. Richardson about 1854 in Hartford, Maine, where he grew up. He attended the nearby Colby College in Waterville, Maine where he graduated in 1883; whereupon he took the job of organizing the newly created Madison Normal School in South Dakota. He was president of the school from 1883 to 1887. In 1884 he married Edith May Adams. Richardson was succeeded as president by William F. Gorrie of Watertown, South Dakota, who assumed office in September 1887. After leaving Madison, Richardson took graduate course work at Harvard in chemistry and mineralogy, followed by accepting appointment at Olivet College in Olivet, Michigan where he briefly was a professor of mathematics and physics. In 1891 he moved to Salt Lake City due to his interest in mining. He became involved with a number of mines in the Bingham Canyon mining district, notably the Old Jordan and South Galena mines. In 1895, he moved to Anaconda, Montana where with a Mr. Olson, Richardson together with his brother-in-law, Charles Francis Adams, ran a merchantile, supplying clothes and other dry goods to the miners. In 1899, he and his brother-in-law returned to Salt Lake City and opened the firm of Richardson & Adams. Richardson & Adams primarily ran an upscale clothing store (clothier) in downtown Salt Lake City, but it still also held a number of mining claims. The Richardson Hall dorm at Dakota State was named after him in 1970. He died on June 24, 1904 in Omaha, Nebraska, and was buried in the Mount Olivet Cemetery, in Salt Lake City, Utah.

History The hospital was designed by Edward Banks in the classical style and built between 1846 and 1849 on land acquired from the Henry Vane, 2nd Duke of Cleveland. It was opened as the South Staffordshire Hospital but became the Wolverhampton and Staffordshire General Hospital in the second half of the 19th century. The internal layout rapidly became outdated when the pavilion system, where patients were separated by type of illness, was introduced at new hospitals in 1852. Additions included a new wing for in-patients as well as a new block for out- patients in 1872, a fever ward in 1873, a medical library in 1877, an additional two-storey in-patient wing in 1912 and the vast King Edward VII Memorial Wing in 1923. It was renamed the Royal Hospital, Wolverhampton in December 1928. A further block of in-patient wards was completed in the late 1930s. The hospital closed in June 1997 with services being transferred to New Cross Hospital; the site was acquired for retail development by Tesco in 2001 but, after that development stalled in January 2015, the site was sold on to the Homes and Communities Agency for residential development in March 2016.

Proponents of tax exemption argue that tampons, sanitary napkins, menstrual cups and comparable products constitute basic, unavoidable necessities for women and thus should be made tax exempt. Proponents argue that feminine hygiene products serving the basic menstrual cycle should be classified alongside other unavoidable, tax exempt necessities, such as groceries and personal medical items. The BBC estimates that women need to use feminine hygiene products for about a week each month for about 30 years. While sales tax policy varies across jurisdictions, these products were typically taxed at the same rate as non-essential goods, such as in the United States, while other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Ireland, reduced or eliminated their general consumption tax on sanitary products. When asked about equivalent exemptions for men, proponents argue that no male products, condoms included, are comparable to feminine hygiene products, since menstruation is biological and \\"feminine hygiene is not a choice\\". As the vast majority of consumers of feminine hygiene products are women, the increased cost has been criticized as being discriminatory against women. The tampon tax is not a special tax levied directly on feminine hygiene products. Since about 2004, many countries have abolished or reduced sales taxes for tampons and pads, including Kenya, Canada, India, Colombia, Australia, Germany and Rwanda.  Tax law by jurisdiction  Country examples (ordered by most recent changes to the country's tax system first): * In Germany, the amount of tax on sanitary items will be cut from 19% (the basic rate) to 7% (the reduced rate) as of 1 January 2020. This is said to be a step toward a tax system that does not discriminate against women. Other European countries France, Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands either plan to, or have already, slashed their taxes in recent years. * Rwanda removed their VAT on all sanitary products on 10th December 2019. The change was made in response to school absence and dropouts caused by 18% of Rwandan women and girls being unable to attend school or work due to not being able to afford feminine hygiene products. *Australia repealed the 10% tax on tampons and pads on 1 January 2019 after an 18-year campaign, after all states and territories agreed to make sanitary products explicitly exempt from the GST. * In Colombia, on 14 November 2018, the Constitutional Court unanimously ruled to strike down a 5 per cent tax on tampons and pads on gender equality grounds. * India eliminated its 12% tax on feminine hygiene products in 2018. This was after a year of lobbying by advocacy groups and even celebrities. Superstar Akshlay Kumar featured as the lead male actor in Pad Man and raised awareness about the Niine Movement to fight the taboo on menstruation. * Ireland levies no value-added tax on tampons, panty liners, and sanitary towels. Ireland is the only EU country to have a zero tax rate on sanitary goods. While other European Union countries are barred from creating zero-rated value added taxes, Ireland's exemptions are grandfathered. * Canada removed its tampon tax in mid-2015 following an online petition signed by thousands. * In 2004, Kenya was the first country to abolish sales tax for menstrual products. = United Kingdom = The United Kingdom has levied a value-added tax on sanitary products since it joined the European Economic Community in 1973. This rate was reduced to 5% specifically for sanitary products in 2000 with lobbying from Member of Parliament Dawn Primarolo saying that this reduction was \\"about fairness, and doing what we can to lower the cost of a necessity.\\" This is the lowest rate possible under the European Union's value added tax law, which as of 2015 does not allow zero rates. The UK Independence Party raised the issue in the 2015 general election with promises to withdraw from the European Union and allow the zero rate. Prime Minister David Cameron commented, when prompted, that the tampon tax campaign was \\"long-standing\\" and a complicated issue within the European Union. In England, one in ten women between 14 and 21 cannot afford menstrual management products. Laura Coryton led a \\"Stop taxing periods, period\\" campaign with an online petition to have the European Union remove the value-added tax for sanitary products. George Osborne mentioned the petition by name in his 2015 Autumn Statement pledge to end the tampon tax at the European Union level. The petition platform's CEO cited the campaign as an example of successful clicktivism, with over 320,000 signatures. In March 2016, Parliament created legislation to eliminate the tampon VAT, following a budget amendment by Labour MP Paula Sherriff.. It was expected to go into effect by April 2018 but did not do so; several British women protested for it publicly while displaying blood stains from their periods. On 3 October 2018, new EU VAT rules that will allow the UK to stop taxing sanitary products were proposed by the European Parliament. However they would not go into effect until January 2022 at the earliest, and no timeline for implementation has been tabled. As of March 2020, the tampon tax is considered likely to finally be abolished when the transition period for Britain leaving the EU ends in December 2020. Scotland In July 2017, a pilot programme began in Scotland to have free sanitary products available at schools and food banks for women who cannot afford them. The pilot scheme was launched for six months in Aberdeen, with ¬£42,500 of funding from the devolved Scottish Government in order to address the growing scandal of \\"period poverty\\". It was believed 1,000 girls would benefit from the scheme, as there were reports of teenage girls using tissues, toilet roll, torn T-shirts and even newspaper as makeshift sanitary products, with some girls even skipping school altogether. It was decided to launch the scheme to improve attainment and school attendance, as well as improve confidence amongst teenage girls during their period; Scotland is believed to be the first country in the world to give out free sanitary products as part of a government-sponsored initiative. Further to this half- year pilot programme, Scotland's opposition Labour Party intends to introduce a bill to make this permanent. A study by the WHO and UNICEF showed that one out of five women in Scotland have been forced to improvise with items including toilet paper and old clothes due to the high cost of commercial products. A bill to make period products available for free to everyone who needs them received preliminary approval in the Scottish Parliament in February 2020.Scotland Poised To Become 1st Country To Make Period Products Free = United States = thumbrightUS states taxing tampons as of June 2019 In the United States, almost all states tax \\"tangible individual property\\" but exempt non-luxury \\"necessities\\": groceries, prescriptions, prosthetics, agriculture supplies, and sometimes clothes‚Äîthe exemptions vary between states. Most states charge sales tax for women's pads and tampons. Five states do not have a state sales tax (Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon), and , thirteen US states specifically exempted essential hygiene products: Utah, Ohio, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. California repealed the tax in its 2019 state budget, but only for the two-year duration of the budget. Seven other states have introduced such legislation, most recently Nebraska, Virginia, and Arizona. Many federal assistance programs such as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and WIC (Women, Infants and Children) do not allow the use of those funds for products such as pads or tampons despite the products' classification as medical devices. The IRS does not classify female products as medical devices, thus blocking women from buying them with pre-tax dollars in both flexible spending accounts and health savings accounts. There have been some changes to the tampon taxes, but most of these changes are at the state or city level. On a smaller scale, individual cities have also changed their laws in favor of eliminating the tampon tax (e.g. Denver, Colorado).  California  California Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia reported that California women each pay roughly US$7 per month over 40 years, constituting US$20 million in annual taxes. Garcia and Ling Ling Chang proposed a bill to remove the tampon tax in early 2016. At this time, only a handful of the country's states exempted tampons, and several others had no state sales tax. Garcia held that women were taxed \\"for being women\\" and bore an economic burden for having no other choice but to buy these products. Garcia and Chang added that the tax was \\"regulatory discrimination\\" that disproportionately affected poor women and women of color, and that it likely persisted due to social taboos against discussing menstruation. Both houses of the California State Legislature voted to exempt tampons from taxation in June 2016, but the bill was vetoed by the state's governor, Jerry Brown, three months later. California Governor Jerry Brown vetoed AB-1561 due to the potential loss of money in taxing feminine hygiene products. In response, Cristina Garcia co- authored AB-0479: Common Cents Tax Reform Act with Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher, which is a new measure outlining a solution to offset the feminine product and diaper tax exemption by increasing the tax on hard liquor. This bill was ultimately gutted and amended with provisions on workers' compensation. In 2017, California State Legislature passed AB 10 (Ch. 687) requiring public middle schools and high schools where at least 40% of students meet the federal poverty level to stock half of the restrooms with free tampons and sanitary napkins. The law was passed in an effort to eliminate the cost burden and keep low-income students in schools during their menstrual cycle. Companies involved in supplying the necessary feminine hygiene products (tampons and pads) for complete menstrual care in the restrooms of schools include WAXIE and Hospeco. They also supply various options for menstrual product dispensers that have a time delay mechanism to prevent products from being overused and/or abused. In June 2019, menstrual products were exempted from the sales tax in the state budget, but only for the two-year duration of the budget. The exemption will be revisited in future budgets.  New York  In July 2016, New York State exempted feminine hygiene products from taxation, reducing the state's tax revenue by an estimated US$10 million annually. In the court case of the \\"Tampon Tax\\", attorney Zoe Salzman defended the movement of repealing the taxes on feminine menstrual products. Part of the case was also a plea for refunding the women for all of the taxes that they had to pay on feminine menstrual products in the past. Ultimately the case ruled to repeal the taxes on feminine menstrual products, but not to refund the women of New York the previous taxes. Connecticut and Illinois also removed their tax in 2016, with Florida following suit in 2017.  New Jersey  A 2018 empirical study on New Jersey's 2005 tax break on menstrual products found that \\"repealing tampon taxes removes an unequal tax burden and could make menstrual hygiene products more accessible for low-income consumers\\". The study utilized data from more than 16,000 purchases in 2004‚Äì2006 made in New Jersey, Delaware, Connecticut, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, using these latter nearby states as the control group. Through a differences-in-differences approach, they found that after the repeal, consumer prices on menstrual products decreased by 7.3%, relative to the control states. This was greater than the 6.9% sales tax, suggesting that the consumers benefitted from the tax break. Upon further analysis, the study also found that the decrease in consumer prices was greater for low-income consumers than high-income consumers (3.9% decrease versus 12.4% decrease). This suggests that low-income consumers received the most benefit from the tax break, while high-income consumers shared the benefit with producers of menstrual products.  Washington  On July 1st, 2020, Washington became the 20th state to remove tax from menstrual products. Other states Many states that have tampon taxes have tried to repeal or eliminate the tax via legislation and have been denied. US states such as Tennessee, Arizona, and Virginia have introduced legislation. In Utah, Representative Susan Duckworth introduced a bill that would have exempted menstrual hygiene products from sales tax, titled \\"Hygiene Tax Act\\". Products exempted included such items as tampons and disposable diapers. Legal scholars point out that when the bill was sent to the Utah taxation committee to be voted on, eight of the eleven men voted against the bill. In November 2019, during a ‚Äúspecial legislative session‚Äù and a Governor signature, Utah became the thirteenth US state to abolish the tampon tax. Effective from January 1, 2020. In November 2019, Ohio became the 12th US state to repeal the pink or tampon tax. Both Representatives Greta Johnson and Brigid Kelly introduced the bills for years and finally became law in November 2019 ‚Äì that would exempt feminine menstrual products from the state's sales tax. Legal scholars note that Ohio women still have to pay around four million dollars each year due to taxes on these items as they are not exempt from local taxes. In Tennessee, the same bill was sent to the Senate and House to reduce the 7% sales tax on feminine products, defined as \\"any product to be used by women with respect to menstruation ... [including] tampons, pads, liners, [and] cups\\". Both the Senate and the House did not pass the bill. In Virginia, a delegate named Mark Keam introduced House Bill 952. The bill wanted to exempt the same products as Ohio and Utah from the 5.3% sales tax. Like the other two states, the bill was not passed. = Canada = In January 2015 the Canadian government recognised sanitary products as an essential item, ending the GST tax on all sanitary products. The Canadian government is currently debating whether to make menstrual products free in the workplace. The Government of Canada has published a Notice of Intent to the Canadian Gazette seeking feedback on providing free products in federally regulated workplaces; stakeholders and Canadians were able to feedback until July 2, 2019. Providing free menstrual products in workplaces is expected to bring better health and workplace productivity and reduced stigma around the conversation of menstruation. Under Part II of the Canada labour Code, employers are already required to provide toilet paper, soap, warm water, and a way to dry hands. Women or gender non-conforming persons who require menstrual products make up 40% of the federal workforce, and the financial burden of sanitary products rests entirely on them, burdening or severely negatively impacting those who need them, adding required sanitation products will allow for greater equality in the workplace and more opportunity for people with lower income. On May 28, 2015 the Canadian Federal Government voted in favour of lifting the tampon tax federally. The tax was ultimately repealed July 1, 2015. This was inspired by an online petition organized by Canadian Menstruators, an online advocacy group, which thousands of Canadians signed and presented to the Federal Government of Canada in Ottawa. Critics have pointed out that sanitary products are still taxed under tariffs under Canadian tariff laws. =China= In China, menstrual products are subject to a 13% sales tax, the same as for most consumer items.  Activism  Supporters of the exemption of said taxes are calling their efforts \\"menstrual equity\\", explaining it as a social movement that strives for feminine products like tampons to be considered necessities. Things that are considered necessities, for example toilet paper, are not taxed. Activists are often being led by members of government. Councilwomen Julissa Ferreras-Copeland led a movement with a tampon tax pilot project ultimately providing free pads and tampons at a local high school in Queens, New York. Ferreras-Copeland's effort has now been expanded into 25 different schools around New York City. Other democrats including Ydanis Rodriguez and council speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito are advocating for state legislature to stop taxing sanitary products. Free the Tampon, an advocate for free menstrual products estimates that it would cost less than $5 a year per user to provide tampons and pads in restrooms at schools and businesses. Activists with United for Access, organized a petition and march to put pressure on the US Department of Education to eradicate period poverty in the US. They called on the government to treat period products as health necessities, support policies that protect students who menstruate, and fund period products in school bathrooms. Slovakia levies a 20% tax on sanitary products‚Äîthe basic goods rate. A Slovakian film director commented that there are no plans to change the law and that east Europe missed elements of feminist change while living under communist government. Other campaigns have emerged such as #Freeperiods encouraging state policies to provide menstrual products. #Freeperiods is a campaign started by Amika George who started a petition aimed at encouraging the UK government to provide low-income families with subsidised menstrual products. This campaign since then has grown exponentially. The Free periods initiative has recently paired up with The Red Box Project, which is a community-based initiative that provides free menstrual products and underwear to young women who struggle financially. The Red Box Projects notes the importance of their initiative as according to #Freeperiods one out of 10 girls can‚Äôt afford to purchase menstrual products and over 137,000 girls have missed school due to period poverty. Within the Global North tampon activism has been strong and well supported. Countries are moving forward and either removing tampon taxes or providing free menstrual products. In 2018 the Scottish Government moved forward and became the first country to provide free menstrual products for students at schools and universities.Additionally, other countries have moved forward in implementing policies around providing sanitary products and abolishing taxes on menstrual products. Kenya and Uganda moved forward and removed taxes on these products. Furthermore, the Kenyan government also provides funding to schools who provide pads.

After many years as the radiology chief at the Carle Clinic in Illinois and a faculty member at the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago, Gianturco moved to Houston, where he conducted research at MD Anderson Hospital. Several medical innovations bear his name, including an early coronary stent, a wool coil that could be deployed inside blood vessels to stop bleeding, and a filter to trap blood clots in the venous system before they reached the heart. Early life Gianturco was born in Naples, the youngest of eight children in his family. He attended college and medical school in Naples. He studied radiology in Rome, then went to Berlin for a year of training in pathology. In 1930, he came to the U.S. to continue his medical education by completing a residency at the Mayo Clinic. Gianturco had come to the Mayo Clinic to train in surgery, hoping to eventually join his brother in a surgical practice in Italy. However, shortly after Gianturco arrived in Minnesota, his brother died, so Gianturco decided to pursue a career in radiology. Mayo Clinic physiologist Walter C. Alvarez exerted an early influence on Gianturco. Alvarez and Gianturco studied hunger contractions in the stomachs of cats using cineradiography. He also worked on some devices with radiologist John D. Camp on imaging technology, including techniques that would allow for visualization of the optic canal and hypoglossal canal. Early career in Illinois At the invitation of a friend, physician Vito Witting, Gianturco moved to Illinois to join the medical group at the Carle Clinic in Urbana. Witting had been ill around that time, and he died of acute leukemia on the day that Gianturco arrived in Urbana. Gianturco became a U.S. citizen shortly after his arrival. In 1934, he was in the first group of physicians to achieve board certification from the fledgling American Board of Radiology. He soon became the chief of radiology at the Carle Clinic, a position he held for more than 30 years. Gianturco's service at the Carle Clinic was interrupted only by a stint as a lieutenant colonel with the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World War II. While he was in active practice at the Carle Clinic, Gianturco was a clinical faculty member at the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago. Move to Texas Unsatisfied by a brief period of retirement in 1967, Gianturco sought to return to work as a radiologist. Through Robert Moreton, a radiologist in Houston who had become an administrator at MD Anderson Hospital, Gianturco secured a position at MD Anderson as a professor of experimental radiology and the radiology residency director. By 1969, Gianturco had given up his teaching responsibilities and focused on research. With radiologists Sidney Wallace and Gerald D. Dodd, Gianturco helped to establish the John S. Dunn Sr. Foundation Center for Research in Radiological Sciences. Retaining a senior consultant position at the Carle Clinic even during his years at MD Anderson, he spent summers in Illinois for most of his later career, but he always returned to Texas before the cold weather hit Illinois. Innovations The holder of ten patents, Gianturco may have been best known for introducing the Gianturco-Roubin coronary stent used in angioplasty. However, he invented or improved upon several other devices. While in France during World War II, he had devised three-dimensional X-ray techniques that helped surgeons locate shell casings in the eyes of wounded soldiers. He introduced the Gianturco coil, a tiny piece of wool that could be deployed from a catheter into a blood vessel to stop bleeding or to treat a tumor. He also invented a type of inferior vena cava filter known colloquially as a \\"bird's nest\\" filter. Cook Medical marketed the device as the Gianturco-Roehm Bird's Nest Filter. Gianturco was honored with the Gold Medal Awards from the Radiological Society of North America and the Italian Radiological Society. He became known for creating simple and inexpensive solutions to difficult problems. One day, a radiologist had come from another country to demonstrate an expensive solenoid device for regulating the flow of barium during a barium enema. Gianturco showed the radiologist how the same purpose could be achieved with a piece of string, an IV pole and a test tube clamp. Later life Though his activity at MD Anderson slowed over the years and he spent more time in Illinois with his family, he continued to visit his laboratory in Houston periodically until he was 88 years old.

After earning her M.D. at New York University School of Medicine in 1952, she undertook her residency at Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Jerusalem the following year. Choosing to specialize in the field of pediatric neurology, which at the time was new to Israel, she established the first pediatric neurology clinic in Israel in 1968 at Bikur Holim Hospital. She later expanded this clinic into a full-service diagnostic, evaluation, and intervention center. In 1990 she and her team moved to Shaare Zedek Medical Center. She is credited as \\"the founder of modern child neurology in Israel\\". Early life and education Naomi Kassan was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Shalom Kassan, a Jewish Palestinian √©migr√©, and Eva Dushkin, a first-generation American child of Eastern European immigrants. She had one older sibling. When she was four, her family moved to Palestine, where her father was a judge in the Mandatory Palestine legal service. Eighteen months later her mother took the children back to the United States for a year, returning to Palestine in 1937. The following year her mother returned to New York City permanently with the children. Naomi graduated from The Bronx High School of Science. She earned her B.A. from New York University and her medical degree from the New York University School of Medicine in 1952. Desiring to live in Israel, she undertook her residency at the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Jerusalem beginning in 1953. She completed her second M.D. at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1957. Career When Amir chose to specialize in pediatric neurology, this field was not yet recognized in Israel, and women represented a small minority of physicians in the country. Amir was mentored by Dr. Helena Kagan, founder and head of the department of pediatrics at Bikur Holim Hospital in Jerusalem. Kagan offered her a small room separate from the pediatrics ward to use as a neurological clinic. Before establishing her practice, Amir returned to New York for two years to take a clinical fellowship at the Neurological Institute of Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. She returned to Israel in 1968 to establish the first pediatric neurology rehabilitation daycare center in the country at Bikur Holim Hospital. This center offered both inpatient and outpatient services, and included a rehabilitation kindergarten in which Amir and her team could evaluate interventions over the long-term. In 1979 Amir expanded the center into a full-service diagnostic, evaluation, and intervention day hospital. In its first six years, the day-hospital screened more than 1,000 children. A sleep clinic for children was installed in 1984. In 1990 Amir and her team of seven specialists moved to Shaare Zedek Medical Center, which provided an entire wing for her day-hospital. In 2009 the rehabilitation kindergarten moved into its own facility adjacent to the medical center. Approximately 70 children ages 3 to 7 are enrolled in the kindergarten, half of whom will eventually enter regular schools. Amir also practiced at the Spafford Clinic in the Old City of Jerusalem, treating Muslim children, and the Mukassed Hospital on the Mount of Olives. She set up a number of satellite neurology clinics in Arab villages. Research interests Amir co-edited two books and co-authored numerous peer-reviewed articles. Her research interests included cognitive development, epilepsy, neurometabolic disorders, aphasia, and developmental disorders. Amir joined the staff of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1974 as a lecturer. She became a clinical senior lecturer in 1983 and a clinical associate professor in 1993. Honors She received the Israeli Women of Achievement Award in 1989. Personal life Naomi married Shlomo Amir in March 1955. They had two sons and one daughter. Naomi died of cancer on January 4, 1995.

Taxonomy  The specific name semotus is Latin for \\"distant\\" or \\"remote\\", in reference to this species being isolated from its closest relatives by several hundred kilometres as it only occurs on Mussau Island. It is a member of the V. doreanus species complex (V. doreanus, V. finschi, V. semotus, V. yuwonoi).  Distribution  It is endemic to the island of Mussau in Papua New Guinea. Although once likely common throughout Mussau, it is now restricted to a small coastal area of the island due to logging. It is however still common in its current range, where it can be found on palm trees, shrubs, and other dry coastal vegetation. There are unconfirmed reports of this species also occurring on Emirau Island.  Description  upright=1.5 The Mussau Island blue-tailed monitor reaches just over 1 metre in length. It has a pale yellow tongue, which is a shared characteristic of the V. doreanus species complex. It has a marbled black and cream coloured throat and a banded tail with varying levels of blue colouration. Juveniles are black and more strikingly patterned, with white spots on the head, orange spots on the back, and pale green to cream coloured bands on the tail.  Diet  Like other monitors of the V. doreanus species complex, the Mussau Island blue-tailed monitor feeds on a relatively high amount of vertebrate prey, especially when compared to other monitors of the subgenus Euprepriosaurus. It has been reported to feed on skinks, birds, eggs, and crabs. It is the only large terrestrial generalist predator and scavenger on Mussau Island.

A plaque on the facade commemorates that Hans Christian Andersen lived in the building when he had his first fairytale published. History =18th century= Giertrud Birgitte Bodenhoff Nyhavn 20 was built in 1778‚Äì68 for Andreas Bodenhoff. He lived at Nyhavn 31 on the other side of the canal and had previously also built Nyhavn 12. The building was probably constructed by master timber Samuel Blichfeldt (1749-1787). After Bodenhoff's death in 1894, his son Andreas Bodenhoff Jr. took over the building as well as his father's timber business. When his brother, Rasmus Bodenhoff died in 1795, he also took over the family's shipyard in Christianshavn. He married the daughter of his mother's sister, Hjertrud Birgitte Rosted. Just five months after the wedding, Andreas Bodenhoof Jr. fell ill and died. Gjertrud Bodenhoff, who just 19 years old had become the richest widow in the city, lived in the building. She was popular among the poor for her philanthropic work among them. In 1698, she died under suspicious circumstances. It is believed that she was buried alive and subsequently woken up and murdered by tomb raiders. =19th century= Drawing by Hans Christian Andersen of \\"Nyhavn from my window\\", 1834 From 1 September 1834, Hans Christian Andersen was a lodger on the second floor, renting two rooms from Karen Sophie Larsen who was the widow of a skipper. Andersen's sleaping room faced the courtyard and the Botanical Garden which was then located in Vharlottenborg's garden, while his combined living room and study faced the canal. In a letter to Henriette Hanck from 1 January 1835, on her request, Andersen made a detailed description of his home at Nyhavn 20. Andersen wrote his first fairytales while living in the building. They were published in May 1835. The small booklet contained the stories The Tinderbox, Little Claus and Big Claus, The Princess and the Pea and Little Idas Flowers. He published a total of six booklets with Fairy Tales Told for Children in the period 1835-1842, followed by New Fairytales published in the period 1843-1848. Andersen also wrote the novels O.T. and Kun en Spillemand (1837) and completed The Improvisatore while he lived at Nyhavn 20. In his diary, he describes an episode where he suddenly felt cold while working on The Improvisator. When he opened the door to the neighbouring room, he found out that his land lady and the maid had opened the windows and poured water on the floor, so that her four children could slide on it when the water froze. On 1 December 1838, Andersen had grown so tired of the conditions that he moved to Hotel du Nord wgich was located at the site where the Magasin du Nord department store lies today. The painter Wilhelm Marstrand was a resident in the building in 1843‚Äì44. His next home was located at Frederiksholms Kanal 12. The medical doctor C. E. Fenger lived in the building right after he had become a professor in Chinese medicine at the University of Copenhagen. = 20th century = The building was listed by the Danish Heritage Agency in the Danish national registry of protected buildings in 1918. Holger Prior, a coffee wholesaler, was based in the building until the 1950s. The company Boels Food purchased the building in 1960. The company had been founded by Esper Boel when he purchased Lundby Dairy on the island of Falster in 1941. Nyhavn 20 became the new headquarters of his company. In 1967, he also acquired the manor house Kj√¶rstrup at Holeby on the island of Lolland. Architecture The building is ten bays wide and has two three-bay wall dormers.

It is endemic to the Solomon Islands archipelago and is also known from Santa Isabel Island, San Jorge Island (Solomon Islands) and Bourgainville Island (Papua New Guinea).  Taxonomy  Varanus spinulosus was first described by Robert Mertens in 1941 from a singe male specimen, and named Varanus indicus spinulosus as a subspecies of the mangrove monitor. This species was known only by the holotype until 1989, when 5 female specimens were collected. In 1994, the taxon was elevated to specific status as Varanus spinulosus, but remained a member of the subgenus Euprepriosaurus and the V. indicus species complex until it was declared incertae sedis in 2010, when it was concluded that the species likely represented a new subgenus due to its genital morphology. In 2016, the monotypic subgenus Solomonsaurus was coined for this species based on its unique scale structure, the latter which is reflected by this taxon's specific epithet spinulosus, meaning \\"spiny\\". A 2020 phylogenetic analysis suggests that this species is the most basal species in the genus Varanus, having dispersed to the Solomon Islands shortly after they formed 30 million years ago. Description This species is in many respects similar to the mangrove monitors of the V. indicus species complex, but has a number of unique morphological characteristics. It has a spiny scale texture as each of the small body scales are strongly keeled and conical in shape, which is a feature unique amongst all monitor lizards. It has 3-4 rows of bright yellow spots running across its back, and has relatively large eyes. Diet They feed on megapode eggs and on fish, often emerging from the bush. In the intertidal zone at low tide, it is possible that they would search for dead fish. Relationship with Humans During the 1990s, many V. spinulosus were imported under the common name ‚Äúmangrove monitor‚Äù due to increased desirability in the pet trade.

The species is endemic to Australia. Etymology The specific name, storri, is in honor of Australian herpetologist Glen Milton Storr.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Varanus storri, p. 256). Subspecies *Varanus storri ocreatus *Varanus storri storri Geographic range and habitat V. storri is found in the seasonal tropical regions of Australia, specifically in rocky environments.James, Craig D.; Losos, Jonathan B.; King, Dennis R. (1992). \\"Reproductive Biology and Diets of Goannas (Reptilia: Varanidae) from Australia\\". Journal of Herpetology 26: 128‚Äì136. V. storri storri is found in eastern Australia, from Charters Tower to the Queensland, whereas V. storri ocreatus is predominantly located in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Thus, both subspecies are found in the same climate and alike habitats.Christian KA, Bedford GS, Shannahan ST (1996). \\"Solar Absorptance of Some Australian Lizards and Its Relationship to Temperature\\". Australian Journal of Zoology 44: 59‚Äì67. They can be found in open woodland, grasslands, spinifex, and rocky areas. Description The species V. storri is smaller and duller colored than the similar looking spiny-tailed monitor (V. acanthurus). V. storri grows up to just over in total length. V. s. ocreatus has a longer tail and limbs than V. s. storri; the former's tail is 1.6 times longer than its snout to vent length while the latter has a tail that is only 1.4 times longer. V. s. ocreatus also has enlarged scales on the bottom of the end of its hindlegs. The species does not display sexual dimorphism, and even the cluster of spiny scales on either sides of the male's vent in many other Odatria species is present in both sexes of Storr's monitor. Behavior The species V. storri is terrestrial, and is even less arboreal than the related spiny-tailed monitor. The species lives in colonies in the wild, and as many as 50 animals may live together in a 0.75 km2 area, although each individual inhabits its own U-shaped burrow under a large rock or spinifex. Individuals sometimes wave their tails at each other. V. storri is most active between February and March, and between July and November, during mornings and late afternoons, retreating to its burrow during the hottest time of the day; unlike larger monitors, it remains active during cooler parts of the day with exception of the cold winter months. Although previously reported to change color with increasing temperature,Sprackland RG (1980). \\"Some notes on Storr's dwarf spiny-tailed monitor\\". Kansas Herpetological Society Newsletter 40: 7‚Äì9. the subspecies of V. storri were found to neither change color nor absorb solar radiation between 15‚Äì35¬∞C (59‚Äì95¬∞F) in later studies. Reproduction In V. storri sexual maturity is attained by the time it is long in snout-to- vent length (SVL). Enlarged testes chiefly occur in November, the late dry and early wet season, but do occur throughout the year. Similarly, breeding takes place throughout the year as well. Up to 6 eggs are laid, which are incubated at 27‚Äì29¬∞C (81‚Äì84¬∞F) for 100‚Äì129 days. Sexual maturity can be attained 18 months later. Diet V. storri preys on invertebrates especially orthopterans, but also ants, beetles and spiders. It also feeds on lizards such as skinks and geckos. Its diet is seasonal, and large fat reserves are built up through most of the year in order to last through the winter months when it becomes inactive.

Glass Buttes were formed approximately 5 to 5.8 million years ago during the late Miocene and Pliocene epochs. The mountains are remnants of ancient silicic volcanoes that have been worn down by erosion. They were formed during three lava flow periods. The foundation flows were basalt. They were followed by rhyolitic lava flows which were in turn covered by a second series of basalt flows from local vents. The primary rock that makes up the mountains is rhyolite which in some areas has been mineralized by geothermal forces. Deposits of cinnabar, alunite, hematite, hyalite, and pyrite are also found in certain areas.Johnson, Michael James, \\"Geology, Alteration and Mineralization of a Silicic Volcanic Center, Glass Buttes, Oregon\\", dissertations and theses, Portland State University, Portland, Oregon, 17 May 1984.Waters, Aaron, \\"A Structural and Petrographic Study of the Glass Buttes, Lake County, Oregon\\", Journal of Geology (Volume 35, Number 5), University of Chicago Press, July‚ÄìAugust 1927, pp. 441‚Äì452.Anderson, John Gottberg, \\"Highway 20 revisited ‚Äì The road to Burns offers more to see than most drivers realize\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 24 October 2010.  Environment and ecology  Glass Buttes are part of Oregon's high desert environment. The area around the buttes is extremely arid with little or no natural surface water most of the year. In fact, Glass Buttes are a major landmark in the middle of what was once known as Oregon's Great Sandy Desert.Russell, Israel C., \\"Great Sandy Desert\\", Preliminary Report on the Geology and Water Resources of Central Oregon, United States Geological Survey, United States Department of Interior, Government Printing Office, Washington, District of Columbia, 1905, p. 13.Hatton, Raymond R., High Desert of Central Oregon, Binfords and Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1977, p. 2 & 73‚Äì74. The ground cover on the mountain slopes is primarily sagebrush, green rabbitbrush, mountain mahogany, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass. However, on the north and west facing slopes and in some canyon areas there are dispersed western juniper trees and some pine groves with an understory dominated by sagebrush and mountain mahogany. There are also willows in some seasonal drainage areas.\\"Rockhounding and Other Recreational or Hobby Collecting, Glass Butte (Obsidian)\\", Oregon State Office, Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Portland, Oregon, accessed 19 November 2016.Hatton, Raymond R., High Desert of Central Oregon, Binfords and Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1977, p. 7-9 & 71. Glass Buttes and the surrounding area host a variety of wildlife. Larger mammals found in the area include pronghorn, mule deer, elk, coyotes, bobcats, and cougars. Smaller mammals include American badgers, striped skunks, black-tailed jackrabbits, white-tailed jackrabbits, pygmy rabbits, Belding's ground squirrels, golden- mantled ground squirrels, least chipmunks, Ord's kangaroo rats, canyon mice, deer mice, and northern grasshopper mice. Rattlesnakes and several lizard species are also common in the area around Glass Buttes.Jackman, E.R. and R.A.

Birds common to the area around Glass Buttes include sagebrush sparrow, lark sparrow, Brewer's sparrow, mountain bluebird, green-tailed towhee, sage thrasher, Brewer's blackbird, and black-billed magpie. The Glass Buttes area is also prime habitat for greater sage-grouse. Larger birds found in the area include barn owls, great horned owls, prairie falcons, red-tailed hawks, turkey vultures, and golden eagles.  History  For thousands of years, Native Americans used obsidian for making cutting tools, arrowheads, and spear points. Obsidian was also an important trade good for Native Americans. Glass Buttes obsidian was used for these purposes at least 9000 years ago. Clovis people may have also collected obsidian at Glass Buttes up to 13,000 years ago.Frahm, Ellery and Joshua M. Feinberg \\"Reassessing Obsidian Field Relationships at Glass Buttes, Oregon\\", Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, December 2014, pp. 1‚Äì12.Jasper, David, \\"Glass Buttes yield obsidian, Lake County landmark offers rockhounds a chance to collect glass\\", The Bulletin, Bend Oregon, 23 February 2012.Brogan, Phil F., East of the Cascades, Binfords and Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1965, p. 24.Helfrich, Prince E., \\"Indians Valued Obxidian\\", Eugene Guard, Eugene, Oregon, 7 December 1962, p. 20. Glass Buttes obsidian has been found at sites throughout the Pacific Northwest, from British Columbia in the north to California in the south and as far east as Idaho.Brogan, Phil F., East of the Cascades, Binfords and Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1965, p. 169. Some reports place Glass Buttes obsidian artifacts at archeological sites as far east as Ohio.Carmichael, Suzanne, \\"Oregon's High Desert\\", New York Times, New York, New York, 12 June 1994. In the early twentieth century, American homesteaders began to settle in scattered sites around Glass Buttes. Most of the homesteaders arrived between 1910 and 1913. The only community in the area was Stauffer. It was located in the Lost Creek Valley, just south of Glass Buttes. The Stauffer post office was opened in 1913, but the community was never incorporated. Many of the settlers in Stauffer used logs from juniper trees cut on Glass Buttes to build their home. They also decorated their homes with obsidian gathers from sites around the buttes. By 1918, homesteads around Glass Buttes were being abandoned due to the lack of water for livestock. However, a small post office was maintained at Stauffer until 1950.Hatton, Raymond R., High Desert of Central Oregon, Binfords and Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1977, p. 78-81.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \\"Stauffer\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 910. In the 1930s, Percy L. Forbes, a local rancher and self-taught geologist, began surveying the obsidian and mineral deposits in the Glass Buttes area. In 1934, the Bend Bulletin reported that Forbes had found numerous obsidian sites and had identified seven specific varieties of natural glass around Glass Buttes. His discoveries included an iridescent rainbow-colored variety with bands of blue, green, red, pink, and gold that was unique to the Glass Buttes area.\\"Stauffer School Opens First Time in 4 Years\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 25 September 1933, p. 5.\\"Imprisoned Sunsets\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 10 February 1934, p. 4.\\"Missionary of the Desert\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 28 December 1955, p. 4.Brogan, Phil F., \\"Area Boasts Among Finest U.S. Gem Areas\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 18 March 1964. Mercury was mined in the Glass Buttes mountain complex from the mid-1940s to the early 1960s. The mercury deposits were first identified by P. L. Forbes in 1933. By 1957, there were 25 mining claims in the Glass Buttes area. At that time, the largest mine was producing 65 to 70 flasks of mercury per month. While the mercury was present in commercially valuable quantities, to cover production costs a relatively high market price was required. As a result, all the mines were closed by 1961 because the market price for mercury no longer covered the cost of production.\\"Glass Buttes Mercury Deposit In Oregon, The United States\\", The Diggings, Chattanooga, Tennessee, accessed 21 November 2016.\\"Another Tunnel Dug to Mine Mercury at Glass Butte Site\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 13 September 1957, p. 5.\\"Pulling the Rug\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 5 November 1957, p. 4. In 2009, a private company leased around Glass Buttes from the Bureau of Land Management for geothermal exploration. The company's geologists believed they could find water about below the ground surface. The project involved construction and maintenance of several access roads as well as drilling, testing, and monitoring of up to 13 geothermal wells on public lands. The project also includes three exploratory wells on private land near Glass Buttes. An environmental assessment study was completed in 2013. Based on study, the Bureau of Land Management approved seven geothermal test wells. If the test wells find hot enough water, the company will use it to drive steam turbines to generate electricity.\\"Geothermal drilling proposed Hide Details\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 16 May 2013.Glass Buttes Geothermal Exploration Environmental Assessment (DOI-BLM-OR-P040-2011-0021-EA), Burns District, Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Burns, Oregon, 10 July 2013.Glucklich, Elon, \\"Tapping Geothermal's Potential\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 8 November 2013. Today, there is a rough road that goes to the top of Glass Butte, the highest point in the mountain complex. The road services several communication towers located at the summit. In 2015, the Oregon Department of Transportation began a project to repair or replace on-sites components of the state's radio network used by the department of transportation and the Oregon State Police.

Recreation  Examples of Glass Buttes obsidian The Glass Buttes area offers a number of recreational opportunities including rock collecting, hiking, camping, hunting, and nature study. Of these activities, rock collecting is the most popular. The buttes have one of the largest and most diverse deposits of obsidian in the world. In fact, the mountains are named for the numerous deposits of obsidian found on their slopes. There is a wide variety of high-quality obsidian found in the area including jet black, brown, green, red fire, pumpkin, mahogany, midnight lace, rainbow, gold sheen, silver sheen, and snowflake as well as several double flow varieties. While some rockhounds dig for preferred obsidian specimens, there are large fields of colorful obsidian readily available on the ground for easy collection.Miller, Jim, \\"Obsidian is Hot Stuff\\", Volcano World, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, October 2016. Today, most of the land on and around Glass Buttes is owned by the United States Government. Those Federal lands are administered by the Department of Interior's Bureau of Land Management. Because the Glass Buttes complex has abundant, high-quality obsidian, the Bureau of Land Management has reserved as a free-use area where the public can gather obsidian for private use. No permits are required; however, individuals can only remove of obsidian per year. There is also some state-owned land and a few private obsidian claims in the Glass Buttes area that are not generally open to the public. The Glass Buttes area is very remote and extremely rugged. The access roads are not maintained so four-wheel drive vehicles are recommended. Also, the widely dispersed natural glass (obsidian) increases the chances of a flat tire on the roads. It is normally quite dry in the Glass Buttes areas; however, when it rains the road can quickly become impassable even for four-wheel drive vehicles. There are no developed campsites or other facilities in the area; however, dispersed camping is permitted. During the summer, it is recommended that visitors check with the Prineville Bureau of Land Management District regarding fire restrictions before traveling to the area.

To be eligible, candidates must have # already raised between $1,500 and $6,000 from a minimum number of donors; # agreed to campaign finance restrictions, including accepting no more than $250 of non-voucher funds from any individual contributor (or $500 for candidates standing for the office of mayor), and # agreed to cap campaign spending to a determined limit. In addition, participating candidates must not have received any contributions from a person or organization with more than $250,000 in service contracts with the city. People who are not eligible to vote, such as permanent residents, were also eligible. The program was funded by a $3 million citywide increase in the real estate tax. The system was \\"first come, first served\\", with just 47,000 vouchers honored. A similar plan was put forward by 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang. \\"Democracy Dollars\\" as the plan was called would give each registered voter $100 to put towards the political campaign of their choice annually. Pro and con Supporters said the program would increase the involvement of voters in election campaigns by increasing the percent of money given to political campaigns from less than 2 percent to between 10 and 15 percent, as well as limit the influence of special interests. Opponents claimed that, because the vouchers would be distributed ten months before the general election and were assigned on a \\"first come, first served\\" basis, the program would largely benefit incumbent political candidates rather than challengers, because the latter typically launch their campaigns at a later date than incumbents. As a result, incumbents might receive all funds from the program, with available money completely depleted by the time challengers were able to organize campaigns.

Candidates are nominated by the President and must have a law degree, at least fifteen years experience in a legal profession and must at least forty years old. A group of at least one third of all deputies may formally propose candidates to the President. Composition The law on the Constitutional Court prescribed that it would have five judges, that it would start operating when at least three judges had been sworn in and that this had to happen by 1 January 2017. In November 2016, President Raul Khajimba nominated five candidates: former Justice Minister Liudmila Khojashvili, former Central Election Chairman Sergei Smir, two time Presidential candidate Iakub Lakoba, as well as Tamaz Ketsba and Raul Pant. On 22 November, the People's Assembly elected Khojashvili and Pant with 26 and 25 votes respectively, while Smyr, Ketsba and Lakoba received only 20, 17 and 12 votes out of 35 total. Parliament's failure to approve three out of five candidates was criticised by Khajimba, claiming that the procedure obliged deputies to vote for or against, while many had in fact abstained, and pointing out that Ketsba's candidacy in particular had been proposed by a group of Parliament members. On 29 November, Khojashvili and Pant were formally sworn in. Following opposition protests against the government of Khajimba, the opposition and the government reached an agreement whereby the opposition could nominate a new Prosecutor General and two members of the Constitutional Court. It selected the lawyer Roza Zantaria and Sukhumi City Court judge Rustam Chagava. In addition, incumbent Prosecutor General Nuri Tania was nominated as Constitutional Court judge. However, on 29 December, the People's Assembly postponed the vote stating that it rejected Chagava as too inexperienced and that Zantaria had refused the nomination. Because the deadline on the formation of the Constitutional Court had been missed, on 18 January 2017 the People's Assembly adopted a bill formally postponing the deadline to 1 June 2017. It also elected Tania with the support of 24 of the 27 deputies present.

From Georgia, he came to Boston for law school and stayed. For over fifty years, he worked to combat racial discrimination in Massachusetts. He was one of the first African-American members of the American Bar Association. Wilson was a founding member and president of the Boston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).  Early life  Butler Roland Wilson was born in Greensboro, Georgia, on July 11, 1861, to Dr. John R. and Mary Jackson Wilson, free people of color. His father was a well-known physician and civic leader in the Atlanta area. Wilson attended Atlanta University, a historically black college, where he was captain of the varsity baseball team and was voted class orator. He received his B.A. degree in 1881 and M.A. in 1884. Against the wishes of his parents, who wanted him to become a minister, Wilson traveled to Boston to earn his LL.B. at the Boston University School of Law. There he befriended the attorney and civil rights activist Archibald H. Grimk√©, and began writing for Grimk√©'s Republican newspaper, The Hub. He graduated with honors in 1884, and was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar Association the same year.  Marriage and family  On June 27, 1894, Wilson and Mary P. Evans were married by Archibald Grimk√©'s brother, the Reverend Francis James Grimk√©. The couple moved to 13 Rutland Square in Boston's South End, where they raised their six children. Mary Wilson became a well-known activist in her own right; she was a founding member of the Women's Service Club, NAACP Boston branch.  Career  Soon after his admission to the bar, Wilson briefly partnered with Archibald Grimk√©. He also worked for several years with Judge George Lewis Ruffin, the first black judge in the United States, and his son, Hubert S. Ruffin. In 1887, after both George L. Ruffin and his son died, Wilson opened his own criminal law practice at 34 School Street. He placed advertisements in The Woman's Era. an African-American woman's newspaper edited by Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin. He built a successful practice serving clients of all races, and became one of the most respected attorneys in New England. One of his early clients was Moorfield Storey, a white Boston attorney. He later was elected as president of the American Bar Association (ABA) and founding president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In 1898, Massachusetts Governor Roger Wolcott appointed Wilson as a master of chancery. = ABA membership = In 1911, the American Bar Association (ABA) admitted three African Americans to its membership: Butler Wilson, William Henry Lewis, a U.S. Assistant Attorney General, who were both of Boston; and William R. Morris of Minneapolis. At the time, the executive committee did not know that these candidates were \\"colored men.\\" In January 1912, upon learning that Lewis was black, the ABA's executive committee voted to rescind his membership. That August, they rescinded the memberships of Wilson and Morris as well. Members of the Boston NAACP and the Massachusetts Bar Association mounted a vigorous defense of the two Boston attorneys. U.S. Attorney General George W. Wickersham sent a letter to all 4,700 members of the ABA in support of Lewis; Moorfield Storey circulated a similar letter on Wilson's behalf that was signed by leading members of the Massachusetts Bar. Without the support of a powerful defender, Morris, the Minnesotan, was forced to resign. Soon afterward, the ABA ruled that applicants for membership must declare their race. Former Massachusetts Attorney General Albert E. Pillsbury, who was opposed to racial restrictions, resigned in protest over the issue in 1913. The ABA continued to discriminate against other applicants of color for several decades. = NAACP leadership = Wilson and his wife were among the organizers of the Boston branch of the NAACP, the organization's first local branch. The Wilsons were the most prominent African-American leaders of the organization at a time when its leadership was dominated by whites. The Boston branch was formally founded on February 8, 1912, with Francis Jackson Garrison, son of the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, as its first president. Wilson was the branch's first secretary, and joined the national board in 1913.Schneider (1997), p. 136. In the early 1920s he became branch president and held that post until 1936.Sources differ as to the official start and end dates of Wilson's presidency. His obituary in The Crisis (1939) states simply that he was branch president for \\"more than a dozen years\\". According to Clarence G. Contee's biography of Wilson in The Crisis (1974), he was branch secretary from 1926 to 1939 and joined the national board of directors in the 1920s. In African-Americans in Boston: More Than 350 Years (1991), Robert C. Hayden writes that Wilson presided over the Boston NAACP from 1916 to 1936, \\"the longest presidential tenure in its history.\\" Under Wilson's leadership, the Boston NAACP strove to improve educational opportunities for black children in Boston, protested against offensive books and films, opposed legislation banning interracial marriage, and fought segregation in housing, hospitals, and the YMCA.Carle (2013), pp. 269-270. = Civil rights work = One of Wilson's first cases was a discrimination lawsuit against a skating rink in Boston. He and Grimk√© won the suit in the Municipal Court, but the Superior Court dismissed it on appeal. In 1893, Wilson aided William H. Lewis, who was studying law at Harvard, in his suit against a white barber shop in Harvard Square that refused to serve him. Lewis and Wilson successfully lobbied the state legislature for an amendment expanding the reach of existing anti-discrimination law to include barber shops and other public places. In 1913, acting on behalf of the NAACP, Wilson and fellow attorney Clement G. Morgan persuaded the directors of Boston's YMCA to change its discriminatory swimming pool policy. The following year, he led a successful campaign to remove a songbook containing racial epithets from Boston's public schools. In several cases he opposed the extradition of black defendants to Southern states, arguing that they were likely to be lynched. Wilson was one of the main leaders of a spirited but unsuccessful effort to ban the race-baiting film The Birth of a Nation from Boston theaters. He led a delegation of NAACP members to Mayor James Curley's office in 1915, and urged state legislators to support the ban. Other local leaders of the campaign included William Monroe Trotter, Lewis, and Morgan. In 1921, Trotter succeeded in having the film banned in Boston by making an alliance with the Catholic Church. During World War I, Wilson opposed the creation of segregated training camps for black officers.Wilson devoted much of his career to fighting racial segregation. According to the Boston Globe, however, citing poor treatment of black soldiers by white officers, he called for the War Department to create a division \\"composed entirely of colored troops, and officered from top to bottom by colored officers.\\" See In the 1920s Wilson worked to defeat bills banning interracial marriage in Massachusetts. Similar bills were passed in some Southern states, considered then part of the eugenics movement as a progressive effort to improve ethnic stock. = Other memberships = Wilson was a member of many charitable and civic associations. He was a director of the Boston Home for Aged Colored Women; board secretary of the Harriet Tubman House, a settlement house in the South End; and a member of the American Red Cross. He served on the Speakers Committee of the Ford Hall Forum and the executive committee of the South End Improvement Association, and was a charter member and third president of the Boston Literary and Historical Association. He belonged to the Order of Odd Fellows, the Knights of Pythias, and the Masons. A lifelong Republican, he organized and was a charter member of the Republican Club of Massachusetts. In 1917 he was appointed by Republican Governor Samuel W. McCall to the board of appeals on fire insurance rates, a post he held for the rest of his life.  Political views  Wilson was a vocal supporter of the Republican party and often urged Boston's black men to support Republican candidates. In 1892, speaking at a political rally, he declared that \\"The negro who votes the Democratic ticket is either a fool or a knave.\\" In the South, white Democrats in control of state legislatures had begun to disenfranchise most blacks and many poor whites by creating barriers to voter registration. This exclusion of blacks from the political process crippled the Republican Party in the South. Later Wilson aligned with activists such as William H. Lewis, Archibald Grimk√©, William Monroe Trotter, George Washington Forbes, Clement G. Morgan, and others who were critical of Booker T. Washington's accommodationist approach. He supported the views of Trotter and Forbes in their newspaper, the Boston Guardian. When W. E. B. Du Bois organized the Niagara Movement in 1905, Wilson was one of the original signers. He also served on the organization's Legal Committee.Carle (2013), p. 186. A firm believer in the power of education, Wilson said it was America's duty to give \\"every citizen an education commensurate with his character and ability\\" and \\"a fair field in which to use it.\\" He supported voting rights for women, and was a member of the Massachusetts Men's League for Women's Suffrage. In 1915 he addressed a meeting of the Boston Equal Suffrage Association for Good Government; the other speakers were Julia Lathrop, director of the U.S. Children's Bureau, and playwright Marion Craig Wentworth.  Death and legacy  Wilson died of pneumonia in Boston on October 31, 1939, aged 79. His home at 13 Rutland Square is marked with a Heritage Guild plaque. Early in his career, Wilson was instrumental in getting the city to erect a monument to Crispus Attucks and the other victims of the Boston Massacre. The bronze and granite monument stands on Boston Common, near Tremont Street between Avery Street and West Street.

It protects a small area of forest in the town of Chapada dos Guimar√£es, and the forest in turn protects the town's main water supply. Location The Quineira State Park is in the municipality of Chapada dos Guimar√£es, Mato Grosso. It has an area of . The park is in the Paran√° Sedimentary Basin in the Guimar√£es Plateau region. The park contains the main water catchment of the town of Chapada dos Guimar√£es. The C√≥rrego do Quineira (Quineira Stream) rises in the south of the park. It has a length of , and drains part of the urban area. Its microbasin is in the Cachoeirinha River sub-basin of the Cuiab√° River basin. A study of water quality in 2013 found the presence of coliform bacteria throughout the stream, with higher levels downstream from the park. Escherichia coli was present in relatively low levels near the stream's sources within the park, probably coming from wild animals. Lower down the Escherichia coli levels rose significantly, indicating sewage discharge. The study concluded that the park was relatively uncontaminated, but access to the park should be limited to students and researchers. History The area was a permanent preservation area that was converted to a municipal park in 2002 and to a state park in 2006. The Quineira State Park was created by law 8.615 of 26 December 2006. The objective was to guarantee protection of natural resources, preserve significant samples of existing ecosystems in the area, and support public use, education and scientific research without harm to the environment. The state could make ecological trails, and could build a dam after due study of the environmental impact. In May 2014 it was reported that the municipality had approved construction of a luxury hostel within of the park, contravening the Brazilian Forestry Code, which says there must be a protected zone of around springs and water sources. The project did not have an environmental permit from SEMA, the state environment agency. The owner claimed that he was working within the law, replacing an old building and doing nothing to harm the environment since the hostel was to have a green seal. On 11 November 2015 demonstrators in Chapada dos Guimar√£es demanded action to restore the park. The municipality was responsible for supervising the park, but had failed to do so. Irregular housing had been built within the park, garbage dumped in it, and sewage had flowed into the park from houses and shops around it.

It is dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary (and to Saint Vitus). The church was formerly, from 1586, the episcopal seat of the Diocese of Montalto. When the diocese was subsumed into the present Diocese of San Benedetto del Tronto‚ÄìRipatransone‚ÄìMontalto in 1986, Montalto Cathedral became a co-cathedral in the new diocese. It was created a basilica minor by Pope Paul VI in 1965.Catholic.org Basilicas in Italy History The diocese of Montalto was founded in 1586 by Pope Sixtus V, who erected the present crypt of the church. The pope had received his religious training in the convent of San Francesco in the town. Some authors state the Pope intended to create a pilgrimage route starting with the Basilica of Loreto, which contained the putative site of the Incarnation of Jesus, and add to this church of Montalto the structures from the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, the putative site of the Burial of Jesus, purchased via a new crusade, and arcing west to Rome, where Christ's posthumous vicars reign. However, no such crusade ever materialized.Opere sistine nel Piceno, by Gianluigi Lerza, page 24.Montalto delle Marche website, The crypt was completed early and intended to house the structures from the Holy Sepulchre. It now houses a sculptural group of the Deposition by Giorgio Paci. Construction of the church continued for centuries. Mass was only carried out by the end of the 17th century. The final Neoclassical style portico-facade and the octagonal bell tower at the rear of the church were designed by Luigi Poletti in the 19th century. It was made a minor basilica in 1965, with a baptistry in 1967, and had stained glass added in 1990s. In front of the church is a small piazza with two hemicircle fountain pools and to the side a column topped by a winged figure, dedicated to the fallen in the wars. The episcopal palace across the street also holds a diocesan museum. The painting called the Madonna di Montalto was commissioned by Cardinal Alessandro Peretti from the painter Annibale Carracci but the painting never was reached the town and remains in Bologna. The baptismal font was sculpted in 1652. The tall brick fa√ßade has an eclectic Neoclassical design with three round arches almost suggesting a triumphal arch, flanked by pilasters with Corinthian capitals, but for the small triangular tympanum, nestled underneath a balustrade. The interior reflects the fa√ßade with a taller barrel vaulted central nave and two lower aisles separated by heavy columns and a total of 12 lateral chapels. The vault of the nave was frescoed in panels by the 19th- century painter Luigi Fontana. To the right of the entrance, the first chapel serves as the baptistry. It has a canvas depicting the Baptism of Christ (1967) painted by Michelangelo Bedini in baroque fashion. The chapel closest to the altar on the left has an canvas depicting the Virgin with the Town of Montalto and Saints Vito and Venanzo (1691) by Pietro Lucatelli.

The site is a natural ford created by an island in the middle of the river with a firm river bottom on either side. The location was used as a ford by Native Americans before the arrival of Europeans in the West. The first Europeans to use the site were members of the William Henry Ashley fur-trading expedition of 1825, followed by John C. Fr√©mont in 1843. In 1850, Howard Stansbury camped at the site, noting the presence of remnant Native American encampments around the site. By the time the Overland Stage Line was established in 1861, the crossing had been used by emigrants for several years. In later years, a ferry was operated at the site by Ed Bennett, leading to the site becoming known as Bennett's Crossing. When the Union Pacific Railway laid tracks through the region in 1868, the crossing fell out of use.

The film stars Jason Kulas and Peggy McClellan as medical students who use experimental neural microchips to discover the identity of a killer who has been murdering their classmates during the fall of Yugoslavia. The film received negative reviews, with criticism being aimed at its acting, visuals, animations, and the perceived convolution of its plot. The film grossed so little in the few theatres it was shown at, the film's reels were destroyed, as this was cheaper than returning them. Premise Matthew Andrews and Sarah Austin are medical interns studying neurology at the Prorolis Corporation. When a serial killer begins murdering their fellow students, they use experimental chips to visualize the events of the crimes. They conclude through these visualizations that they may be able to see, and therefore prevent, the next murder before it occurs, and learn that the killer is a ghost. It is revealed at the end of the film that the events were all a dream. Cast * Jason Kulas as Matthew Andrews * Peggy McClellan as Sarah Austin * Scott Winters as Dr. John Marlen * Casey McDougal as Anne Plaven * Joan-Marie Dewsnap as Haley Marley Production Director Mark Region has cited The Sixth Sense and The Exorcist as inspirations for After Last Season. The film was shot on 35mm film, and principal photography took place over five or six days in one house with fake medical equipment made from cardboard. According to Region, the film had a budget of $5 million, with $30,000 to $40,000 spent on filming and the majority of the remaining amount spent on the film's computer animated neural visualization sequences. Release and reception The trailer for After Last Season was released in March 2009, and rumors began to circulate on the Internet that the trailer was part of a viral marketing campaign by director Spike Jonze, in promotion of his then-upcoming film Where the Wild Things Are. Several websites even called into question whether or not director Mark Region is actually a real person. Lindsay Robertson of Stereogum wrote that the trailer \\"seems like it could only have been made in a parallel universe that irony forgot. Or written and directed by a small child.\\" The film premiered on June 5, 2009, receiving a limited release in Lancaster, California, Austin, Texas, North Aurora, Illinois, and Rochester, New York. Among the audience members who attended these screenings, a viewer in Rochester called the film \\"amazingly bad\\", while a viewer in Austin stated: \\"it was a total mindfuck. It can really only be described as a lesson in self control because at first, I wanted to leave, then I wanted to scream at the movie, then it became funny, and then it reached that level where it crawls under your skin and agitates you with the questions that rise from having been witness to it.\\" Film critic Scott Von Doviak wrote that the film is \\"intensely boring, thoroughly disorienting and so technically incompetent it achieves several deeply unnerving effects entirely by accident.\\" References External links * *After Last Season at Rotten Tomatoes 2009 films American films ","title":"After Last Season"},{"id":"52550717","text":"The 1901‚Äì02 Penn State Nittany Lions basketball team represented Penn State University during the 1901‚Äì02 college men's basketball season.

Aftermath In March 1993, an IRA unit from Ardoyne shot dead UDA member Norman Truesdale in his shop at the junction of the Oldpark Road and Century Street in the lower Oldpark area. At the time of the attack his family claimed he had no paramilitary connections, but his brother has since stated his belief in an article to the Sunday Life that he was involved in the shooting at James Murray's bookmakers, and a UDA mural was erected in the area in his memory. He was also named by Lister and Jordan as team commander of C9 and an active gunman. IRA efforts to assassinate Johnny Adair also intensified, culminating in the Shankill Road bombing when an attempt by the IRA to wipe out the UDA leadership, including Adair, resulted in the deaths of 9 innocent Protestant civilians, and one of the IRA bombers, as the bomb exploded prematurely or so they said.

During the band's existence, they recorded two singles and an album's worth of unreleased material before disbanding. In 2009, the Numero Group released the album A Lovely Sight, which compiles Pisces' songs from the original studio sessions. Highlighted by the singing of vocalist Linda Bruner, the record label distributed a follow-up EP focused exclusively on her previously-unreleased studio work.  History  A loose affiliation of musicians, Pisces' core members were Paul DiVenti (keyboards, vocals) and Jim Krein (lead guitar), who both originally partnered together to record a promo single in 1967. Krein visited San Francisco in the same year, becoming immersed in the city's psychedelic music scene, and returned to form the band Pisces with DiVenti, as well as Dale Taylor (rhythm guitar, vocals), Carl Van Laningham (drums), and Red Balderama (banjo, bass guitar). More of a recording project than a live act, Diverti and Klein constructed a studio in the back of Nielsen's Music Store to experiment with their self-penned material. In the studio, the duo constantly utilized backwards guitar techniques, phased drums, distorted vocals, and unusual sound effects heavily inspired by the Beatles' studio albums Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and The White Album. Pisces was signed by Vincent Chiarelli, a tailor in Rockford, to his newly established Vincent Records, and released the two singles \\"Motley Mary Ann\\" and \\"A Homesick Feelin'\\" in 1968. Later recording by the group were accompanied by 17 year-old vocalist Linda Bruner who had initially gone to Krein for guitar lessons. Bruner sang lead on the four tracks \\"Dear One\\", \\"Say Goodbye to John\\", \\"Sam\\", and \\"Are You Changing in Your Time\\". The group released their third and final single, \\"Sam\\", in 1969 under the name Bruner. In the following year, Bruner, with acoustic accompaniment provided by Klein, recorded six songs, five of which were cover versions, on a borrowed half- track, but after their studio was destroyed by fire Pisces disbanded. Not much else is known about Bruner, who was disillusioned with the music industry, although most reports state she was on the run following a check fraud scheme. Even though much of their equipment was damaged by the fire, Diverti preserved the band's master tapes in a storage locker. On June 2, 2009, the Numero Group released the material on the eponymous studio album A Lovely Sight. It was generally met with positive reception, with music critics often highlighting Bruner's melancholy vocal delivery. In his evaluation of the album, critic Douglas Wolk applauded Pisces for \\"mightily impressive studio technique for a couple of guys who were basically doing everything on their own. Every song here has a distinctive and freaky sonic identity that makes a lot out of their limited resources\\". Rob Hatch-Miller of Dusted magazine wrote there was \\"something truly special in the musical chemistry\\" of the band. He also stated \\"The Bruner tracks are without a doubt the deepest and most memorable moments\\" on A Lovely Sight. In 2010, the Numero Group released the EP Songs for a Friend, which features Bruner's collaborative work with Klein. Drastically stripped-down in comparison to the psychedelic arrangements on A Lovely Sight, the EP focuses on Bruner's somber covers of popular songs and her one original composition, \\"Songs Linda Wrote Herself\\".

Sport Rosario was founded on October 4, 1965. The team plays its home games at Rosas Pampa stadium. History =Foundation and Notorious Copa Per√∫ Campaigns= Sport Rosario was founded on October 4, 1965 in Nicrupampa which is part of the Independencia District of the city of Huaraz, Ancash by the Mautino √Ångeles Family. The club's name makes reference to Our Lady of the Rosary who is the patron saint of Nicrupampa. In 1995 it adopted the colors of the Argentine club Rosario Central. The club played at the local level for many years. Its first notorious campaign happened in the 2002 Copa Per√∫ where it reached the departamental stage where it lost the final against the Chimbote side Jos√© G√°lvez. In 2004 it would once again reach the departamental stage where they would lose in the semi-finals against that year's eventual champions Sport Ancash. In 2007 Sport Rosario reached the Regional Stage as departamental runner-up where it was seeded in Group B against Uni√≥n Tarapoto, Deportivo Davy and Carlos A. Mannucci. Unfortunately the club finished last in its group with two victories and four loses. =Rise to the First Division= The club would not reach the final stages of the Copa Per√∫ until 2014 where it would reach the National Stage for the first time in its history as the regional runner-up with financial help of Gelacio Mautino. They were eliminated in the round of 16 by Defensor La Bocana. Because of their great campaign and financial stability they were invited to participate in the Peruvian Segunda Divisi√≥n for 2015. The Peruvian Football Federation did not allow Sport Rosario to participate in the tournament. Because of that the club did not participate in any competition in 2015 and presented a case against the Peruvian Football Federation at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In 2016 Sport Rosario started its campaign from the Liga distrital de Huaraz. It won its group with 12 points as well as the final group stage to become the district champion. It also won the Provincial Stage and Departamental Stage in Ancash. In April, the club president and primary financial supporter Gelacio Mautino, died in a car accident. The team reached the first stage of the National Stage of the 2016 Copa Per√∫ where it finished 6th of 50 teams by defeating different teams from around Peru. Sport Rosario defeated Deportivo Venus by a global score of 8-3 in the round of 16. It would also defeat Kola San Mart√≠n in the quarter-finals by a global score of 5-3 to reach the final group stage or Final√≠sima at the Estadio Nacional in Lima. In the Final√≠sima Sport Rosario tied against Deportivo Hualgayoc 1-1, defeated Escuela Municipal Binacional 3-2 and Racing de Huamanchuco 2-1 to finish the group with 7 points and therefore winning a place in the 2017 Torneo Descentralizado. =Torneo Descentralizado Debut= The Mautino Family reinforced the team for its debut in the highest flight of Peruvian soccer by hiring Argentine coach Gerardo Ameli. Other mediatic signs were Uruguayian forward Pablo Lavandeira, who missed the 2017 Copa Libertadores by moving from Deportivo Municipal, and goalkeeper Salom√≥n Libman, Peruvian international with 6 caps who was part of the 2011 and 2015 Copa America third place squads. Sport Rosario finished second in group A during Torneo de Verano behind FBC Melgar with 24 points. The highlight of the tournament was that the team went undefeated at home including a victory against the previous year champion Sporting Cristal. Ameli left the club to sign as coach of Deportivo Municipal and took Pablo Lavandeira with him after the Torneo Apertura. Sport Rosario suffered to balance the team after Lavandeira's leave. Even though it was not able to fight for either the Apertura or Clausura championship it finished 7th in the over-all table with 65 points and thus gain a slot in the 2018 Copa Sudamericana. logo used until 2015 Honours =National= *Copa Per√∫: ::Winners (1): 2016 =Regional= *Liga Departamental de Ancash: ::Winners (2): 2014, 2016 ::Runner-up (2): 2002, 2007 *Liga Provincial de Huaraz: ::Winners (5): 2002, 2007, 2012, 2014, 2016 ::Runner-up (1): 2013 *Liga Distrital de Huaraz: ::Winners (4): 2002, 2012, 2014, 2016 ::Runner-up (1): 2013 Current squad See also *List of football clubs in Peru *Peruvian football league system References External links Football clubs in Peru Association football clubs established in 1965 1965 establishments in Peru ","title":"Sport Rosario"},{"id":"52551269","text":"Colin M. Snedeker (January 5, 1936 ‚Äì October 22, 2016) was a British-born American chemist best known as the inventor of the first washable crayons. Snedeker developed the washable crayon while working as a chemist for Binney & Smith, which was the parent company of Crayola crayons at the time, in response to complaints from parents and consumers. He won the patent for the washable solid marking composition utilized in the crayons in 1990. He also developed products for Kiwi shoe polish and DuPont. Biography Snedeker was born in Newcastle upon Tyne in North East England on January 5, 1936. His grandfather had been killed in a fire before he was born and an English couple had adopted Snedeker's father when he was 13-years old. Colin Snedeker and his sister, Ann, were raised in England. They discovered letters from their father's birth family, who lived in Pennsylvania, in 1948, and soon were invited to visit them in the United States. Colin Snedeker entered high school at age 13 and graduated when he was just 15-years old. He studied metallurgy after high school. Snedeker was hired by Kiwi shoe polish for one of his earliest jobs. There he developed a new, white shoe polish that did not stain clothing. He later moved to Pennsylvania where he was employed as a chemist by Binney & Smith, the then-parent company of Crayola crayons. While working Binney & Smith, Snedeker ran out of ideas as to which projects to pursue. He visited the Crayola complaint department to gain an insight into consumer problems with their products. According to his sister, \\"One of the women [in the mail room] said they received the most mail from mothers wanting to know how to wash out crayons from fabrics, car seats and walls. He got to thinking, and that‚Äôs when he came up with washable crayons.\\" Snedeker successfully developed the first washable crayon available on the market for Crayola. He was awarded the patent for the washable solid marking composition used in his washable crayons in 1990. During the later 1990s, Snedecker also won patents for fluorescent and phosphorescent marking compositions utilized in new lines of Crayolas, as well as a color-changing marking composition system for Crayola. In 2004, Snedeker, who was divorced and had no children, relocated from Pennsylvania to Wichita, Kansas, to be closer to his relatives. Colin Snedeker died in Wichita, Kansas, on October 22, 2016, at the age of 80. He was survived by his sister, Ann Strickland.

Biography  The oldest of six children, Louise Mae Stokes was born in Malden, Massachusetts on October 27, 1913, to William, a gardener, and Mary Wesley Stokes, a domestic. She started running while a student at Beebe Junior High, where she was a center for the basketball team. In 1930, one of her basketball teammates, Kathryn Robley, impressed by her speed, suggested Stokes to join her in the Onteora Track Club, whose sponsor, Malden park commissioner William H. Quaine, knew of Stokes' reputation. Soon, Stokes started winning the sprints and jumping events. While a junior in Malden High School in 1931, Stokes won the James Michael Curley Cup for the best women's performance at the Mayor's Day track meet, including a New England record 12.6 seconds in the 100-meter dash. In December of that year, she tied the world record for women's standing broad jump at 8 feet 5 3/4 inches. At the 1932 United States Olympic Trials, competed in the 100 meters, where she placed third, earning her a spot in the 4 √ó 100 meter relay pool, making her and Tidye Pickett the first African-American Women to be selected for the Olympics, although coach George Vreeland left them out at the final relay lineup. In Los Angeles, Stokes was given a compact by film star Janet Gaynor. Stokes continued running, and at the 1936 United States Olympic Trials, she again competed in the 100 meters, winning both her heat and her semi-final. She was leading the final until a costly error pushed her back to fifth. Still, it was good enough for her to become a part of the 4 x 100 meter relay pool. Stokes' hometown of Malden raised $680 in order that she may compete in Berlin. Although she did not compete at the Olympics, she was still given a hero's welcome in Malden. Stokes was considering to compete at the 1940 Olympics before its cancellation due to World War II. In 1941, she founded the Colored Women's Bowling League, and for the next three decades won many awards. In 1944, she married Caribbean cricketer Wilfred Fraser and had a son, Wilfred, Jr., as well as a stepdaughter, Shirley. From 1957 to 1975, she worked as a clerk for the Massachusetts Department of Corporations and Taxation. She died on March 25, 1978.

It is a small, densely- branched shrub with small leaves and whitish, bell-shaped flowers. The entire plant, apart from the petals, is densely covered with small, circular scales. Description Pityrodia lepidota is a dense, multi-stemmed shrub which usually grows to a height of and which has its branches and leaves densely covered with ash coloured, circular scales. The leaves are stalkless, egg- shaped to lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and wide. The flowers are solitary or in groups of two or three on short, scaly stalks in upper leaf axils. The flowers are surrounded by scaly, linear to lance- shaped bracts and tiny bracteoles. Single flowers are surrounded by leafy bracts long and the groups by scaly bracts about long. The five sepals are long, densely covered with scales on the outside and joined for about half their length to form a tube with five blunt lobes. The five petals are long, whitish, pale pink or pale lilac coloured and joined to form a bell-shaped tube with five lobes on the end. The tube is mostly glabrous except for a densely hairy ring around the ovary and a few hairs on the lowest petal lobe. The lowest, central lobe is oblong to egg-shaped, long, wide and the other lobes are slightly smaller. Flowering occurs from June to December, sometimes as late as March and is followed by hairy, oval-shaped fruit with the sepals still attached. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1883 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Chloanthes lepidota and published the description in Southern Science Record. In 1904 Georg Pritzel changed the name to Pityrodia lepidota. The specific epithet (lepidota) is derived from the Latin word lepidotus, a latinization of the ancient Greek word lepid≈çtos (ŒªŒµœÄŒπŒ¥œâœÑœåœÇ), meaning \\"scaled\\", itself derived from the ancient Greek word lepis, genitive lepidos (ŒªŒµœÄŒØœÇ, genitive ŒªŒµœÄŒØŒ¥ŒøœÇ), meaning \\"scale\\".Backer, C.A.

The land surrounding Kƒ´holo Bay is under the authority of Hawai‚Äòi State Parks. Approximately 2 miles long (3.2 km), it is one of the island's largest bays. Kƒ´holo Bay is now a popular site for tourists and nature enthusiasts. History Originating in 1820, Kƒ´holo Bay was created as a man-made fishing pond for King Kamehameha the Great. The recreational area was bordered by rock walls 6 feet tall and 20 feet wide. These walls were destroyed in 1859 when an eruption from Mauna Loa, located 48 km away, caused the pond to be submerged in a flow of lava. The hardened lava from the eruption created the characteristic black pebble beaches of Kƒ´holo Bay. The large stones that surround the tide pools are remnants of the walls built by Kamehameha. This historic area is now under government regulation and protection as the Kƒ´holo State Park Reserve. = 2006 earthquake = On Sunday, October 15, 2006, Kƒ´holo Bay was struck by a 6.7 magnitude earthquake followed by a 6.0 magnitude earthquake seven minutes after the first. While no fatalities occurred due to the incident, over 60 residential buildings were red tagged by officials. The entire island suffered over $100 million worth of damage as a result of the earthquake. Queen's Bath Kƒ´holo Bay was also home to \\"Queen's Bath\\" a large tide pool on the Kona Coast. The original Queen's Bath, located in Kalapana, was formed by a collapsed lava tube that filled with fresh water from a nearby natural spring. Appropriately named, only ancient Hawaiian royalty, also known as the Ali'i, were allowed to enter the pool which was used as a place for bathing and relaxation. The original pool was destroyed in 1987 by a volcanic eruption from Kilauea. After this site was destroyed, another pool located on the island of Kauai became the new \\"Queen's Bath\\". Sea turtle basking on the rocks of Wainanali'i Pond  Wainanali'i Pond  The northern end of the bay encompasses Wainanali ªi Pond ‚Äì a unique body of water wedged between the hardened lava of the Mauna Loa eruption and a coconut grove. Also known as Hawaii's Blue Lagoon, the pond is an oasis for green sea turtles who visit the site daily to feed and bask on the rocks. While the turtles are a popular attraction for tourists visiting the Bay, they are protected under Hawaiian state law and may not be disturbed. Conservation Efforts = International Efforts = Although the majority of Kƒ´holo Bay is public property, some residential areas of the bay are privately owned and unavailable for research or conservation efforts. In 2011, a large portion of the privately owned property in Kƒ´holo Bay was donated to the Nature Conservancy by Angus Mitchell. Mitchell had inherited $6.5 million worth of property in Kƒ´holo Bay from his father, Paul Mitchell. According to the Nature Conservancy, up to five million gallons of submarine groundwater move from Kƒ´holo Bay to coastal waters each day supporting marine wildlife and coral reef habitats. In an effort to conserve the natural state of the bay, the organization is focused on removing invasive vegetation and existing sediment currently in the water. To determine how these efforts are affecting the overall condition of the area, the conservatory records data on water quality and abundance of wildlife in the bay. Sea turtles are a primary concern of species protection within Kiholo Bay. Another initiative involved in the protection of Kƒ´holo Bay is Conservation International, an organization dedicated to improving ocean health. Conservation International is primarily concerned with providing seafood to local communities while maintaining sustainable fishing efforts. A study done on seafood security in Kƒ´holo Bay determined that the coral reef habitat provided upwards of 30,000 meals per year. While only 8.5% of these meals are part of commercial harvest (the majority of food generated by Kƒ´holo Bay is consumed by herbivores and planktivores living in and around the bay), Kƒ´holo Bay's annual market value was determined to be $78,432. In order to maintain these numbers, the organization aims to improve small-scale fisheries management by restoring marine habitats and promoting sustainable, local seafood. = Ulupono Initiative = The Nature Conservancy and Conservation International work together to protect the Kiholo Marine Area and are supported by the Ulupono Initiative. The Ulupono Initiative raises donations through the Hawaii Community Foundation. These funds are used to support the rehabilitation of fisheries on the island and conduct studies to determine how community efforts to restore protected areas can be maximized. = The State of Hawaii = Kƒ´holo Bay is also protected under the State of Hawaii's Division of Aquatic Resources and Division of State Parks. Under the Division of Aquatic Resources, Hawaiian law states that it is permitted for individuals with aquarium fish permits to use small-meshed nets only if these nets are monitored at all times. It is prohibited for any individual to use gill nets or attempt to feed fish within the fisheries management area. The fisheries management area extends from NƒÅwaik≈´lua Point to Hou Point and includes Wainanali'i Pond. The Division of State Parks outlines that while camping is permitted on weekends many activities including driving motorized vehicles, smoking, littering and consuming alcoholic beverages are prohibited within the bay. Permitted activities include swimming, snorkeling, hiking and beachgoing.
