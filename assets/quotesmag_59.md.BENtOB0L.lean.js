It released on 25 August 2012 in Japan and was originally based upon a short film that Takekiyo had made for a musical channel. The producers of After School Midnighters submitted the film for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, but it was not selected for the final round. The film did go on to gain some attention at the 2013 Fantasia International Film Festival earned a special mention for the Audience Award for Best Animation Feature, but did not win. The movie was released in the United States on September 2, 2016, dubbed in English, on the television channel Toku, along with the short series based on the movie. Plot Three elementary school girls, Mako (Haruka Tomatsu/Caroline Combes), Miko (Sakiko Uran/Lucille Boudonnat), and Mutsuko (Minako Kotobuki/Lucille Boudonnat), decide to investigate the legends behind their school, St. Claire Elementary. As a lark they decide to vandalize the science room's human anatomy model Kunstrijk (Kouichi Yamadera/Bruno Meyere), who decides to take his own personal revenge on the three girls. He invites them to return to the school at midnight for a party, intending to scare them. Instead the three girls end up joining Kunstrijk and the skeleton model Goth (Hiromasa Taguchi/Christophe Seugnet) on a quest to gain a wish. The girls must find three medallions that are spread out over the school's enormous grounds. Kunstrijk directs them to go to three rooms: the Pool Room, the Digital Room, and the Music Room. Each room has their own guardian that fits each area's themes, as the Pool Room is guarded by a merman, the Digital Room's guardians are two all-knowing beings, and the Music Room's guardian is Mozart himself (Hiroshi Yanaka/Jean-Pierre Leblan). However the quest is made even more difficult as not everyone wants the girls to succeed and Kunstrijk is hiding his own secret reason for wanting the girls to succeed: the quest is actually to help ensure that he and Goth will remain in their living state forever rather than returning to inanimate objects.

Producer friends of Takekiyo convinced him to work on a feature-length film instead, which necessitated the creation of a script and the addition of various characters. The film quality also improved from the level seen in the short and Takekiyo stated that he found that \\"Getting the characters to really perform like actors was both the hardest part and the most important.\\" Reception Dread Central gave the film 3 1/2 out of 5 blades, remarking that the \\"animation seems almost too two-dimensional at times, but it‚Äôs so colorful and dynamic that by the halfway point I was too wrapped up in the unfolding storyline to care\\" and that they saw the movie as a good introduction to the horror genre as a whole.

It was held at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri. The show featured five professional wrestling matches, a wedding ceremony and appearances from past WWE performers. The wedding between AJ Lee and Daniel Bryan ended with AJ leaving Bryan after being announced as the new General Manager of Raw by WWE chairman Vince McMahon. The Miz defeated Christian to become the WWE Intercontinental Champion. In the main event, John Cena won by disqualification in a WWE Championship match against defending champion CM Punk after cashing in his Money in the Bank contract, who proceeded to turn heel (villainous) by attacking The Rock. The episode averaged 6 million viewers, Raw's highest viewership since June 2009. The episode also started the program's permanent three-hour format, which had been previously reserved for special episodes.  Production  = Background = Raw first aired on January 11, 1993, and since became the longest-running weekly episodic program in television history with no reruns. On May 17, 2012, WWE announced that Raw would expand from its two-hour format to three hours beginning with the 1000th episode on July 23, 2012. The event took place at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri, and was broadcast on the USA Network in the United States. Actor Charlie Sheen served as the social media ambassador for the event and appeared throughout the show via Skype. = Storylines = Raw 1000 featured professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre- determined by the hosting promotion, WWE. On November 20, 2011, at Survivor Series, CM Punk defeated Alberto Del Rio to win the WWE Championship. On July 15, 2012, at Money in the Bank, John Cena won the Money in the Bank ladder match to earn a contract for a WWE Championship match. The next night on Raw, Cena announced his intention to cash-in his contract for a championship match against Punk on Raw 1000. In November 2011, AJ Lee and Daniel Bryan were placed in an on-screen romance. The next month, Bryan won the World Heavyweight Championship and developed heel (villainous) traits. By March 2012, Bryan started acting verbally abusive towards AJ but she stood by him. At WrestleMania XXVIII on April 1, after AJ and Bryan shared a \\"good luck kiss\\", he was surprised by Sheamus and defeated in 18 seconds. Bryan blamed AJ for his loss of the World Heavyweight Championship and ended their relationship. AJ made multiple attempts to mend their relationship but Bryan spurned her and left her distraught. As a result, AJ's character transitioned to \\"mentally unstable\\". AJ turned her affections to Bryan's rival, WWE Champion CM Punk, and WWE title contender Kane. As Bryan and Punk's feud progressed, AJ was announced as the special guest referee for their title match at Money in the Bank. Bryan made advances on AJ in an attempt to influence her, however, she focused her attention on Punk. On July 9, she proposed to Punk but Bryan countered with a proposal of his own; Punk rejected her offer and she slapped both men. At Money in the Bank on July 15, as referee, AJ counted Punk's pinfall on Bryan, resulting in a successful title defense for Punk; as Punk celebrated over a fallen Bryan, AJ was left alone. The next night, Bryan proposed to her again and she accepted. Beginning on June 11, 2012, Heath Slater was involved in weekly segments where he would insult the celebration of past WWE wrestlers. Each week he was interrupted by a returning WWE veteran, who would either attack him or quickly defeat him in a match. This included Vader, Roddy Piper, Psycho Sid, Bob Backlund, Rikishi, and Road Warrior Animal. On July 2, Slater won his only match during this period, against Doink the Clown, but was attacked by Diamond Dallas Page afterward.  Event  Triple H hitting the Pedigree on Damien Sandow after Sandow's interruption of the DX reunion The show opened with a video package showcasing the history of the show. WWE chairman and chief executive officer Vince McMahon thanked the audience both live in the arena and watching at home for making the 1000th episode of Raw possible before introducing Triple H and Shawn Michaels. The two revealed the other members of D-Generation X, X-Pac, Road Dogg and Billy Gunn, aboard an army jeep. The reunited group was interrupted by Damien Sandow, who objected to the group's crass antics. DX then attacked him with a Sweet Chin Music from Michaels, followed by a Pedigree from Triple H, and the group stripping him down to his trunks. The group then performed some of their signature taunts. Jim Ross came out to call the opening match of the night which was a six-man tag team match pitting World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus, Rey Mysterio, and Sin Cara against Alberto Del Rio, Dolph Ziggler, and Chris Jericho. Ziggler attacked his own partner, Jericho, leading to a Brogue Kick from Sheamus for the win. Afterwards, a backstage segment showed AJ Lee and Layla prepare for AJ's wedding. They were interrupted by Jim Duggan, Roddy Piper, R-Truth, and Mae Young and her son, the Hand. In the next match Brodus Clay quickly defeated Jack Swagger. Afterwards, Dude Love performed his signature Mr. Socko on Swagger and danced with Clay and The Funkadactyls (Cameron and Naomi). Backstage, DX interrupted a yoga session between Trish Stratus and Triple H. The Rock hitting Daniel Bryan with a Rock Bottom Next Jerry Lawler introduced Reverend Slick as the minister for the wedding of AJ Lee and Daniel Bryan. Before the vows could be completed, AJ revealed that her \\"yes\\" was not directed at Bryan but at a business proposal by Vince McMahon, who made her the General Manager of Raw. Bryan stayed in the ring, venting his frustration out by destroying the wedding props and throwing them out of the ring. CM Punk came out to confront him and Bryan stated that he was the \\"greatest wrestler of all time\\" since Punk was \\"The Best in the World\\". The Rock returned to Raw, insulted Bryan and revealed that he would fight for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble against whomever the WWE Champion would be at that time. He then hit Bryan with a Rock Bottom. Bret Hart came out next as guest ring announcer for an Intercontinental Championship match between champion Christian and The Miz. The Miz defeated Christian after hitting the Skull Crushing Finale. With the win, The Miz was recognized as a WWE Triple Crown winner. Triple H returned to call out Brock Lesnar (who had attacked Triple H and broke his arm with the Kimura lock on the April 30, 2012 episode of Raw). Instead, Lesnar's advocate, Paul Heyman, confronted Triple H and refused the challenge for a match SummerSlam. However, after threats by Triple H and taunting by Triple H's wife Stephanie McMahon, Heyman accepted the match on behalf of Lesnar. After Heyman repeatedly made remarks about her kids, Stephanie physically attacked him. Lesnar came out and attacked Triple H and both men engaged in a brief fight before Triple H clotheslined Lesnar out of the ring. WWE's returning legends standing over Heath Slater Santino Marella and Hornswoggle made brief appearances to hand out collectibles to young fans before Howard Finkel made a special appearance to introduce Heath Slater, who challenged any WWE legend backstage to a no-disqualification, no countout match. Lita answered the challenge and hired The APA for protection. As Slater tried to escape, all the veterans he had previously faced (Bob Backlund, Diamond Dallas Page, Doink the Clown, Rikishi, Road Warrior Animal, Roddy Piper, Sgt. Slaughter, Sycho Sid, and Vader) chased him back into the ring, where he was hit with a Twist of Fate from Lita, setting up a Clothesline From Hell from Bradshaw and a Litasault from Lita for the pinfall. The Brothers of Destruction deliver simultaneous Tombstone Piledrivers to Curt Hawkins and Hunico Kane was then scheduled to face Jinder Mahal in a match, but Curt Hawkins, Tyler Reks, Hunico, Camacho, and Drew McIntyre came out and tried to attack him to vent out their anger at being overlooked by WWE. The Undertaker then made his first appearance since WrestleMania XXVIII and, alongside Kane, fended off Mahal and his cohorts, punctuated with double Chokeslams and Tombstones. The main event featured John Cena against CM Punk, with Cena cashing in his Money in the Bank contract for a shot at Punk's WWE Championship. After what had been an even match up, Punk and the referee collided, knocking the referee unconscious to the ground. Big Show came down to the ring and hit Cena with the Knockout Punch. Punk helped the referee back into the ring and ‚Äì after a moment's hesitation ‚Äì pinned a seemingly knocked out Cena, but Cena kicked out. Cena then reversed Punk's attempted Go to Sleep into the STF submission. Big Show again interfered and attacked Cena, resulting in a disqualification victory for Cena (Punk retained the title as the championship could only change hands by pinfall or submission). The Rock ran down to save Cena and attacked Big Show; while setting up his signature People's Elbow maneuver, Punk re-entered the ring and attacked The Rock. Punk then performed the Go to Sleep move on The Rock, turning him heel (villainous).  Reception  The episode received a 3.9 Nielsen rating and averaged 6 million viewers, up 18% from the previous week's 4.9 million viewers. It was the first time Raw had surpassed the six million viewer mark since June 2009. It also became the most watched three- hour Raw in history and was the most watched program on cable television that night.  Aftermath  AJ Lee's role as the on-screen General Manager of Raw began the next week, on July 30. She alleged that Daniel Bryan only wanted the legal leverage to have her committed and forced him to undergo his own psychological evaluation. AJ continued to exact revenge on both Bryan and CM Punk throughout her tenure, denying their requests and booking them in matches against their wishes. AJ stepped down from her General Manager duties on October 22, when she became embroiled in a scandal storyline with John Cena. CM Punk's reign as WWE Champion continued for the remainder of the year. He allied with Paul Heyman and defended his championship against John Cena and Big Show at SummerSlam, Cena at Night of Champions, Ryback at Hell in a Cell, and Cena and Ryback at Survivor Series. On December 5, Punk became the longest-reigning WWE Champion in the past 25 years, surpassing John Cena's 380-day reign. In January 2013, Punk and The Rock continued their rivalry after their confrontation at Raw 1000. At the Royal Rumble on January 27, 2013, The Rock defeated Punk for the WWE Championship, ending Punk's reign at 434 days.

It is a spin-off of the hit television series Kath & Kim, created by Gina Riley and Jane Turner. It is written by and stars Riley, Turner, and Magda Szubanski. The film was released theatrically in Australia in September 2012, and on Blu-ray and DVD on 23 May 2013. It premiered on Australian television five days later, on the Seven Network. Plot Kath Day-Knight (Jane Turner) is still living in Fountain Lakes, Melbourne, however Kel (Glenn Robbins) has become a bore after their honeymoon period, and Kim (Gina Riley) has moved back in after a divorce with Brett (Peter Rowsthorn), despite receiving marriage counselling from Marion (Marg Downey). While visiting the local pharmacy for wart remover, Kath fills out a form for a chance to win a holiday to the (fictional) \\"Kingdom of Papilloma\\", on the heel of Italy (with the real scenes being filmed in Positano). Initially asking Kel, who refuses to travel because of his fear of flying and his dedication to watching the finals of MasterChef, Kath reluctantly decides to take Kim and Sharon (Magda Szubanski) along on the trip. Coincidentally, Prue (Jane Turner) and Trude (Gina Riley) are clandestinely embarking on a holiday to Italy at the same time. After a 50-plus hour flight, the three arrive in Italy exhausted. Becoming energised again following a stop at a cheap knock-off fashion shop, they arrive in Papilloma to find that their accommodation has closed down. Deciding to take their complimentary trip to the castle which sits atop the hill, they meet page Alain (Richard E. Grant), who Sharon takes a liking to, and King Javier (Rob Sitch), who takes a liking to Kath, and allows all three to stay in the castle, under the impression the three are rich from their imitation-brand clothing and can save him from bankruptcy. Meanwhile, a strange noise can be heard echoing throughout the castle, eyes watch from holes in pictures, and a masked figure, revealed to be the son of Javier, Prince Julio (Erin Mullally), becomes attracted to Kim (thinking that she is royalty from her top bearing the title \\"Princess\\"). Javier shows Kath through the town, where it becomes apparent that he is not liked by the poor townspeople, being spat at and having a tomato thrown at him. He later invites the three to a '80s-esque club, where they dance to \\"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\\" before Javier arrests a gay couple who were dancing, informing Kath that homosexuality is illegal in Papilloma. At a later date, the three are invited to a royal ball, to which Kim wears a large gypsy-inspired pink dress. The masked figure approaches and proposes to Kim, who initially refuses because she thinks his mask is hiding a disfigurement. Disregarding Javier's protests, Julio unmasks himself, revealing a handsome face, blond hair hidden by a wig and his crooked teeth to be fake. The invited townspeople gasp as it becomes apparent from his appearance he is not the queen's son. Kim then accepts (stating that she's \\"done worse\\"), and the imminent royal wedding makes worldwide news. The same night, a fire is noticed on one of the castle's turrets. Rushing inside, the royals, along with Kath, Kim and Sharon, discover that the queen has appeared and set the castle on fire from Kim and Sharon's bedroom using Kim's hair straightener. However, the queen is suddenly killed by a falling chandelier and the fire is put out; Javier puts the girls' minds at ease when he explains that the queen was locked up because she was \\"crazy\\", jealous of his attraction to Kath and the source of the noises made around the castle. Back in Australia, Kel is watching MasterChef with Brett when a news update from Papilloma about the royal wedding interrupts the show, and Brett realises it is Kim getting hitched. Javier is then shown grabbing Kath's backside, and Kel thinks she is having an affair. The pair decide to fly to Papilloma, but not before Kel receives hypnosis therapy from Marion to combat his fear of flying, which turns strangely sexual and programs him with the phrase \\"Tray tables up\\". While on the flight with Brett and Epponnee-Rae (Morghyne de Vries), now a spoiled brat who participates in child beauty pageants, Kel hears the phrase during the announcement that the flight will soon be touching down. In a trance, he makes his way to the toilet, where he undresses before later collecting his luggage, opens the sealed door (with the plane having just pulled into the airport), triggering the evacuation slide and leaves. In Papilloma, Kath confronts Javier about being a despot, who rules Papilloma as an absolute monarch. Kel interrupts Javier attempting to put the moves on Kim, and the two engage in a sword duel for her affections; Kel wins and Javier flees. Kim and Sharon become lost before the wedding after exploring their shared bedroom's closet, with Kim having been sabotaged and attempted to be killed by maid Isabella (Jessica De Gouw), who loves Julio and earlier had been teased by Kim. After Kim and Sharon come across a disco-like chamber, it is revealed that Alain has kept all of the imprisoned townspeople and homosexuals there, and they are soon freed, as Kath and Kel, making their way to the wedding, discover the lost Kim and Sharon. Kim laments her messy hair, however Kath, in a fantasy moment, practices her amateur TAFE-learnt \\"wicca\\" on Kim, giving her a makeover (but not before turning her into Dame Edna). With the four finally arriving at the wedding, Epponnee-Rae and Brett (who made their way to Papilloma with Prue and Trude, who are also in attendance) interrupt Kim and Julio's vows, and set off a heated argument in which it is revealed that Kim is not actually royalty, and that Julio (who had earlier revealed that his mother is Elle Macpherson) is not Javier's son, as he fathered no children. Gary Poole (Mick Molloy, who earlier appeared in a flashback), Kath's ex-husband and Kim's father, is revealed to be an extradited royal descendant, therefore making Kath a queen and Kim a princess. Alain also confesses he was \\"forced\\" to make love to the queen, and fathered a daughter, the maid Isabella, who professes her love for Prince Julio. Following the unsuccessful wedding, the royals (including Kath and Kim) along with Kel and Brett appear on a balcony above the town square, where the townspeople chant for food. Javier decides to relinquish some of his power (allowing Papilloma to become a democracy), and a party with plentiful food is later thrown, which the townspeople attend. At the party, Sharon passionately kisses Alain, who tells her he can't return her affections because she's gay (which had been hinted at throughout the film, referencing Szubanski's real- life coming out), leaving her confused and disheartened before she meets Stephanie (Tasneem Roc), who shares her interest in golf and netball. Kath and Kim later discuss returning to Australia after their eventful, fairy tale-like holiday.

He turned professional in July 2006 and was the first wrestler born in the Heisei era to become a sekitori when he was promoted to the j≈´ry≈ç division in November 2010, alongside Takayasu. He reached the top makuuchi division in September 2011. He was injured in his top division debut and fell back to j≈´ry≈ç, but he returned in July 2012 and scored eleven wins, winning the Fighting Spirit Award. A serious knee injury sustained in 2015 has meant he has fallen greatly in rank. Early life and sumo background He was born in Iloilo City in the Philippines to a Filipino mother and a Japanese father. His family moved to Japan when he was about one month old. His parents had always been fans of sumo and from a very young age he had aspired to be a sumo wrestler. He was a member of the sumo club at his primary school, and when his junior high school did not have a sumo club he decided to attend practice at an area high school and other locations so he could continue doing sumo. He participated and did very well in children's sumo and also in national amateur sumo tournaments. However, in his third year of junior high school his parents divorced and he moved back with his mother to her native Philippines. He graduated from junior high school there and in May 2006 returned to Japan. Still interested in sumo, he decided to join Chiganoura stable. The stable already had their foreigner slot filled by the Hungarian Masutoo, but as Masunoyama listed Chiba Prefecture as his place of birth on the banzuke ranking sheets, he is not regarded as a foreigner by the Japan Sumo Association. Career He first stepped on the pro sumo dohy≈ç in July 2006. Being a diligent trainer, and managing to avoid injury, he rose through the ranks and in a little over a year and half achieved his first championship at the rank of sandanme 46 with a 7‚Äì0 perfect record. It would take him another two and half years of mostly winning records to reach the second division j≈´ry≈ç in November 2010. He entered j≈´ry≈ç at the same time as Takayasu. Both had the distinction of being half Filipino as well as simultaneously being the first two wrestlers to enter j≈´ry≈ç that were born in the Heisei Era. Masunoyama only managed a 6‚Äì9 score in his first j≈´ry≈ç tournament but as he had debuted at the relatively high rank of j≈´ry≈ç 11, he was spared relegation. In the January 2011 tournament, he won his first five bouts in a row, but on the sixth day in morning practice he injured a ligament in his right leg. He made the decision to continue competing, and managed to beat Kakizoe on that day. However, two days later he aggravated the injury in a bout against Daid≈ç and was obliged to miss the next day and take a fusenpai. He then returned for two more days, both wins against veteran wrestlers Tamanoshima and Chiyohakuh≈ç before losing again and re- aggravating his injury to miss the final two days. Through all this he still managed an 8‚Äì5 record with two absences. Three tournaments later (with one being missed due to the sumo match-fixing scandal), at the rank of j≈´ry≈ç 1 he came just short of a championship, but lost in a playoff to My≈çgiry≈´ who was in his j≈´ry≈ç debut. This record allowed Masunoyama to be promoted to the top- tier makuuchi for the following September tournament. On the fourth day of his makuuchi debut in a bout against Tochinowaka Masunoyama injured the same ligament in his left leg that he had previously injured in his right leg. He was forced to bow out of the tournament with only a 2‚Äì3 record, and was demoted back to j≈´ry≈ç. Though advised by his doctor not to enter the next tournament in order to let his injury heal, he insisted on fighting on. However, unable to do much training and hobbled by his injury he had losing records in the following two tournaments. He returned to form in the next tournament in March 2012 and posted strong winning records in this and the following tournament. He re-entered makuuchi in July 2012, marking it with an 11‚Äì4 win and the Fighting Spirit prize. However he had two losing records to only one winning one for the remainder of the year. In 2013, he had a lackluster performance, recording mostly losing tournaments, but mostly records of 7‚Äì8 which kept him from falling too far down the ranks. This continued in 2014, and his unimpressive 4‚Äì11 score at maegashira 13 led to his relegation to the j≈´ry≈ç division in July. His downward slide continued in 2015 and absence from the dohy≈ç meant he had fallen to the bottom of the makushita division by September. After having surgery on his right knee for a dislocation and meniscus damage, he declared that he would enter the March 2016 tournament after a five basho absence. He was ranked in the jonidan division for this tournament and came through with a 6‚Äì1 record. He was promoted to the sandanme division for May 2016 but withdrew from that tournament after losing his first match. He sat out the July tournament with injury and was therefore demoted to jonokuchi, the lowest division. He is only the second wrestler with top division experience to fall to jonokuchi since the beginning of the Sh≈çwa era ‚Äì the other being Ry≈´h≈ç in 2012. Finally back on the active list for the September 2016 tournament, easily took a 7‚Äì0 perfect record and the jonokuchi championship and secured a second successive promotion with a 6‚Äì1 in jonidan in November. He missed the January and March 2017 tournaments through injury, but entered the May tournament on Day 7 at jonidan 81 and secured a 4‚Äì0‚Äì3 winning record. In July he won all seven of his matches in the jonidan division, although he was defeated in a playoff for the championship. That month he changed the spelling of his shikona surname from to its current spelling. He was ranked at sandanme 49 in September 2017, his highest rank for two years, but turned in a make-koshi 3‚Äì4 record. He was promoted back to the makushita division for the March 2018 tournament, his first time in the third highest division since September 2015, only to see him injured again in May, causing him to also miss the July 2018 tournament and sending him back down the rankings. Family In July 2006, Masunoyama was the sole new recruit into professional sumo, and this garnered him a lot of attention with the press. The press has continued to be enamored with him because of his friendly character, diligence, and ability to cope with adversity. He has also appeared on various television programs to be interviewed and has proven himself to have a remarkable singing voice on these programs. He has said in interviews that he feels indebted to his mother for raising him on her own, and he sends money to her in the Philippines. He expressed hope to one day buy her a house. Earlier in his sumo career, Masunoyama had initially been advised by a doctor that he had heart disease and should be careful not to overstrain himself; this also appeared to reflect in his sumo, where after an initial spurt of energy at the tachi-ai he would collapse after around 20 seconds from exhaustion. Eventually however, the coach at his stable insisted on a second opinion and a thorough heart examination was conducted which found no evidence of a heart condition. Masunoyama's brother works in Chiganoura stable as a tokoyama or hairdresser. Fighting style Masunoyama goes on the offensive right from the tachi‚Äìai or initial charge, using pushing and thrusting techniques (tsuki/oshi). Nearly half of all his victories are by either yorikiri, the force out, or oshi dashi, the push out.

Built during the reign of Dutthagamani of Anuradhapura, the temple is considered as the place where the silver ore, which provided silver to complete Ruwanwelisaya; one of the largest stupa in Sri Lanka, was discovered. According to the chronicles Mahavamsa and Thupavamsa, the Ridi Viharaya complex was built in gratitude for helping him cherish his dream of completing Ruwanwelisaya. Location Approximately 18 kilometres northeast of Kurunegala, Ridi Viharaya is located in the city of Ridigama. Kurunegala is located 94 kilometres northeast of Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. The temple is approximately 10 kilometres from Ibbagamuwa, in the A6 highway, which connects Kurunegala and Dambulla. History Uda Viharaya and adjacent stupa. Dutthagamani of Anuradhapura, a Sinhalese king of ancient Sri Lanka, known for his campaign that defeated and overthrowed the usurping Tamil prince Ellalan of Chola Kingdom, reigned from 161 BCE to 137 BCE in the Anuradhapura Kingdom. Upon his victory over Elara, he initiated construction of Ruwanwelisaya, also known as the \\"Great Stupa\\", one of the tallest monuments built before the 20th century. Among other materials, silver was required for the basement of the stupa. In the meantime, some merchants were travelling from the central highlands of Sri Lanka, to the then capital of the country; Anuradhapura. According to the chronicles, they saw some ripe jackfruit in the Ridigama area; cut it and thought of offering the first half to Buddhist monks as a ritual. Four Arhat monks appeared according to their wish and accepted the DƒÅna. Then four more monks came and accepted the DƒÅna. The last monk, known as Arhat Indragupta, after partaking the jackfruit, directed the merchants to a path which led to a cave with a silver ore. They informed the monach of their finding after arriving in Anuradhapura. He was much elated upon hearing the news. The ore provided the required amount of silver for the construction work. In gratitude, he built a temple complex on the silver ore, employing 300 masons and 700 others including his chief artisan Vishwakarma Prathiraja. There are approximately twenty-five caves around the temple, which are considered to be inhabited by Arhat monks, since the arrival of Arhat Mahinda in 3rd century BCE. The temple was revived in the 18th century CE, during the reign of Kirti Sri Rajasinha of Kandy (1746-1778 CE). Uda Viharaya was added to the complex during this period. Several affiliated devalas: Kumara Bandara Devalaya and Paththini Devalaya were also established. Ridi Viharaya now falls under the Malwatte chapter of Buddhist temples in Sri Lanka. Associated buildings, structures and locations =Serasum Gala= A rock to the right of the entrance, which is believed to be the place where the initial temple was built. It is also considered that this was the place where king Dutthagamani dressed prior to worshipping the temple. A small stupa is located on top of this rock. =Waraka Welandu Viharaya= Waraka Welandu Viharaya at Ridi Viharaya. Waraka Welandu Viharaya is a Polonnaruwa era building, considered as the place where the Arhat monks accepted jackfruit from the merchants. The name \\"Waraka Welandu Viharaya\\" (temple which the jackfruit was consumed) implies this notion. This small Gedige-type building of the size of a room, is built in stone and contains a number of Kandyan era paintings. Its stone roof rests on eight stone pillars, which are decorated on all four sides. Hindu influence can be observed in the carvings of female dancers, which are usually not found in Buddhist temples. =Hevisi Mandapaya= Located in front of the Maha Viharaya, the Hevisi Mandapaya (or the drummers' pavilion) contains a rice bowl and other objects of historical value. A centuries-old Pallakkiya, which was used to carry elderly monks, can also be seen hung on its roof. =Maha Viharaya= Statues of Gautama Buddha at Maha Viharaya. Maha Viharaya, or the main temple, is located inside the Rajatha lena (or the silver cave); a massive rock which takes the shape of a cobra head. This cave is considered as the place where the original silver ore was found. Various monarchs, including Amandagamani Abhaya (21-31 CE) and Parakramabahu I of Polonnaruwa (1153-1186 CE) have sponsored the reconstruction and expansion of this temple, which is the oldest of all buildings in the complex. Sandakada pahana, at the entrance of Uda Viharaya. It contains a number of Buddharupa in various gestures. This include a 9-metre recumbent Buddha statue and an Anuradhapura era-gold plated Buddha statue. According to Ridi vihara asna, a chronicle, the latter was brought down from India. Other statues: including an ancient statue which is believed to be of king Dutthagamani, eight standing Buddha statues, an Avalokite≈õvara statue and a reclining Buddha statue donated by Burma can also be seen inside this building. The floor in which recumbent Buddha statue is placed, is decorated with Dutch era porcelain floor tiles: popularly known as \\"Bible tiles\\". These blue-and-white tiles portray various biblical figures and stories such as expulsion from the Garden of Eden, dove of peace, prophets of yore, the last supper, burning bush and the creation of man. These tiles were gifted to king Kirti Sri Rajasinha by a Dutch envoy. All rooves and walls of Maha Viharaya are decorated with paintings. =Uda Viharaya= Uda Viharaya, or the upper temple belongs to the Kandyan era, and contains a seated Buddha statue with Makara Thorana and a Sandakada pahana (moonstone). This Sandakada pahana is a unique design, as it takes a semi-circular shape instead of a triangular shape, which is more common in similar designs of Kandy era. There are also sculptures of Hindu deities around the main statue. The chamber contains paintings of mythological animals and Ravana: a main character of the legend, the Ramayana. A stupa is located by the right side of this temple. At the entrance, is a Hindu devalaya, which is dedicated to the protector god of the area. Paintings and sculpture The Pancha Nari Ghataya, carved out of ivory. The cave walls of the Rajatha lena are painted with images that relate to incidents of Gautama Buddha's life. Some of these frescos were never completed, but early sketches can still be seen. The cave walls contain small carved out drains known as \\"Kataram\\", to drain rain water away from the paintings. The Maha Viharaya houses a special kind of sculpture: Pancha Nari Ghataya. It appears as a vase at a distance, but five entwined maiden figures are revealed when observed closely. The sculpture is carved entirely out of ivory. Two lion carvings done in ivory can also be seen on either sides of the main carving. The roof of the Maha Viharaya is rested on wooden pillars decorated with flower designs. On the sides of the seated Buddha statue at Uda Viharaya, drawings of Sath Sathiya (the way Gautama Buddha spent his first seven weeks after enlightenment) and Kandyan era symbols such as Nawanari Kunjaraya (nine entwined maiden figures in the shape of an elephant), Thri Sinha Rupaya (three seated lion figures with one head), Vrushba Kunjaraya (heads of a bull and an elephant entwined) and Sarpenda can be seen. Initial paintings of Uda Viharaya were done by an acclaimed artist of Kandyan era, Devaragampala Silvath Thena. Rest of the paintings were completed by artists of the Nilagama generation.

The company has been located in the Philadelphia area since its inception in 1968, and has occupied its present location in Chester, Pennsylvania since 1981.  Background  Bruce Howze founded the company in 1968, which was first named Community Light and Sound. The company originally started in the Philadelphia area, and now occupies a 100,000 square foot space in Chester, Pennsylvania. Community established itself as the first company to utilize fiberglass to create large yet lightweight loudspeaker horns and enclosures. In 1970, it introduced its first notable live sound reinforcement loudspeaker product, the LMF, a fiberglass midrange horn. The company next developed the Leviathan fiberglass composite bass horn, which Elvis Presley used in his 1971 tour. Several top musical groups from that era used Leviathans as well, such as the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, and Earth, Wind & Fire. In the mid-1970s, Community became one of the first companies to meticulously test and document the performance of both its own loudspeakers and competitors‚Äô loudspeakers. Community based its test measurement philosophy on the underlying principles of ‚Äúfree field‚Äù and ‚Äúfar field,‚Äù believing that far more dependable and relevant data can be obtained by testing loudspeakers at measurement distances that correspond to actual listening distances. Since its founding, Community has pursued pioneering loudspeaker technologies. In 2010, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted the company a patent for Carbon Ring Cone Technology. In 2014, Community was acquired by Audio Prof, which also owns Apart Audio. Bruce W. Howze is still active with the company today, as is Christine Howze. Steve Johnson joined Community in 2013 as president. The Community brand has a global presence with its products being for live performance and permanent installation in houses of worship, schools, and other venues. Community Professional is also well known for its weather-resistant loudspeaker designs, which are installed in major sports stadia and arenas throughout the world. This same quality makes the company‚Äôs loudspeakers a valuable component in emergency notification systems, such as the one used by the Tidal Information System in Venice, Italy.

Since 2003 Gioni has been directing the Nicola Trussardi Foundation, a nomadic museum which organizes exhibitions by contemporary artists in forgotten buildings, public monuments and abandoned palazzos in the city of Milan. Exhibitions Gioni has worked on numerous exhibitions including: Uniform. Order and Disorder (PS1, New York, 2001); The Fourth Sex.

He was part of the curatorial team for the presentation of acquisitions of the Dakis Joannou Collection (Athens, 2004). While associate director at the New Museum, Gioni curated the signature group exhibitions Younger Than Jesus and Ostalgia. Art critic Jerry Saltz wrote this about Ostalgia in his review of the top ten art events in 2011: \\"curator Massimiliano Gioni is now master of his own form of large-scale exhibition as narrative, time machine, pleasurable pedagogy, historical potboiler come to life, and insight.\\" As the curator of the 8th Gwangju Biennale (2010), in Gwangju, South Korea, Gioni created a sprawling investigation of the relationships that bind people to images and images to people. Titled 10,000 Lives and including works by more than 100 artists, realized between 1901 and 2010, as well as several new commissions, the exhibition was configured as a temporary museum in which both artworks and cultural artifacts are brought together to compose an idiosyncratic catalogue of figures and icons, faces and masks, idols and dolls. Gioni drew the exhibition title from Maninbo (10,000 Lives), a thirty-volume epic poem conceived by Korean author Ko Un while imprisoned in 1980 for his participation in the South Korean democratic movement. The 3,800 poems that compose Ko Un's magnum opus Maninbo (10,000 Lives) reads as a personal encyclopedia of humanity. Unfolding as a family album, the 8th Gwangju Biennale looked at images as sites of affection and means of survival. The exhibition also examined how images are fabricated, circulated, stolen and exchanged - interrogating their power, while trying to capture their many lives. Over 500,000 visitors attended.

Location  The Wormsgraben is located 1 to 3 km west of Drei Annen Hohne and 1 km south of the Hohneklippen rocks. The River Wormke, which empties into the Kalte Bode near (a part of Elend), is in its upper reaches fed through a weir into the Wormsgraben. Initially most of the river's waters were diverted into the Wormsgraben channel, today all the water flows this way. After the Wormsgraben is crossed by the Glash√ºtten Way (Glash√ºttenweg i.e. Glassworks Way) at the Sandgrube, it discharges into the Zillierbach near the forest lodge of Hohne. The artificial ditch drains the water of the Bode and leads it to the catchment area of the Zillierbach- Holtemme, in order to transfer it after 48 km to the Bode in the northern Harz Foreland. Due to a steep gradient and high rate of flow a high (up to 1 m) and wide embankment is needed on the downhill side of the channel.

The foreign contact and international trade with foreign counterparts had also shaped and sealed the fate of Indonesian archipelago, as Indians, Chinese, Arabs, and eventually European traders reached the archipelago during the Age of Exploration and participated in the spice trade, war and conquest. By the early 17th century, the Dutch East India Company (VOC), one of the world's earliest multinational companies, had established their base in the archipelago as they monopolised the spice trade. By 1800, the Dutch East Indies colonial state had emerged and benefited from cash crop trades of coffee, tea, quinine, rubber and palm oil from the colony, also from the mining sector: oil, coal, tin and copper. The colonial state would be succeeded by the Indonesian Republic after World War II. By the early 21st century, Indonesia rose to be the largest economy in Southeast Asia, as one of the emerging market economies of the world, a member of G-20 major economies and classified as a newly industrialised country.  Pre-modern Indonesia  = Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms period = The economy of most of villages and polities in the archipelago initially relied heavily on rice agriculture, as well as the trading of forests products such as tropical fruits, hunted animals, plant resins, rattan and hardwood. Ancient kingdoms such as the Tarumanagara and Mataram were dependent on rice yields and tax. For a long time, the archipelago was known for its abundance of natural resources. Spices such as nutmeg and cloves from Maluku Islands, pepper and cubeb from southern Sumatra and western Java, rice from Java, gold, copper and tin from Sumatra, Borneo and the islands in between, camphor resin from port of Barus, sappan and sandalwood from the Lesser Sunda Islands, hardwoods from Borneo, ivory and rhino's horn from Sumatra and exotic bird feathers from the Western New Guinea are among a few products sought by traders worldwide. This foreign contact was started by small Indianised trading kingdoms in the early 4th century that nurtured contacts with other major civilisations in the Asian mainland, India and China. Benefited by its strategic location on a thriving maritime trade route between India and China, polities in Indonesian archipelago soon would grow into a thriving, healthy, and cosmopolitan trading empire such as Srivijaya that rose in the 7th century. Srivijaya In the world of commerce, Srivijaya rose rapidly to be a far-flung empire controlling the two passages between India and China, namely the Sunda Strait from Palembang and the Malacca Strait from Kedah. Arab accounts stated that the empire of the maharaja was so vast that in two years the swiftest vessel could not travel round all its islands, which produced camphor, aloes, cloves, sandalwood, nutmegs, cardamom and cubebs, ivory, gold and tin, making the maharaja as rich as any king in India.Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro, Nugroho Notosusanto, (1992), Sejarah nasional Indonesia: Jaman kuna, PT Balai Pustaka, Other than fostering the lucrative trade relations with India and China, Srivijaya also established commerce link with the Arabian Peninsula. A messenger sent by Maharaja Sri Indravarman delivered his letter for Caliph Umar ibn AbdulAziz of Ummayad in 718 and was returned to Srivijaya with Zanji (black female slave from Zanj), the Caliph's present for maharaja. The Chinese chronicle later mentioned about Che-li-t'o-lo-pa-mo (Sri Indravarman), Maharaja of Shih-li-fo- shih in 724 had sent the emperor a ts'engchi (Chinese spelling of Arabic Zanji) as a gift. Srivijaya would continue to dominate the economy of the archipelago until its decline in the 13th century. Majapahit Majapahit Terracotta Piggy Bank, 14th‚Äì15th century Trowulan, East Java. (Collection of National Museum of Indonesia, Jakarta) In the 14th century Java, the Majapahit kingdom would grow into a maritime empire that would control the trade and economy of the archipelago for another century. According to a Chinese source from Ming Dynasty, Yingya Shenglan, Ma Huan reported on the Javanese economy and market. Rice is harvested twice a year, and its grain is small. They also harvest white sesame and lentils, but there is no wheat. This land produces sapan wood (useful to produce red dye), diamond, sandalwood, incense, puyang pepper, cantharides (green beetles used for medicine), steel, turtles, tortoise shell, strange and rare birds; such as a large parrot as big as a hen, red and green parrots, five-coloured parrots that can imitate the human voice, also guinea fowl, peacock, 'betel tree bird', pearl bird, and green pigeons. The beasts here are strange: there are white deer, white monkey, and various other animals. Pigs, goats, cattle, horses, poultries, and there are all types of ducks. For the fruits, there are all kinds of bananas, coconut, sugarcane, pomegranate, lotus, mang-chi-shi (mangosteen), watermelon and lang Ch'a (langsat or lanzones). In addition, all types of squash and vegetables are present. Taxes and fines were paid in cash. The Javanese economy had been partly monetised since the late 8th century by using gold and silver coins. Previously, the 9th-century Wonoboyo hoard discovered in Central Java shows that ancient Javan gold coins were seed-shaped similar to corn, while the silver coins were similar to buttons. Around 1300, during the reign of Majapahit's first king, an important change took place: the indigenous coinage was replaced entirely by imported Chinese copper cash. About 10,388 ancient Chinese coins weighing about 40 kg were unearthed from the backyard of a local resident in Sidoarjo in November 2008. Indonesian Ancient Relics Conservation Bureau (BP3) of East Java verified that the coins dated as early as the Majapahit era. The reason for the use of foreign currency is not given in any source, but most scholars assume it was due to the increasing complexity of Javanese economy and a desire for a currency system that used much smaller denominations suitable for use in everyday market transactions. This was a role for which gold and silver are not well suited. These kepeng Chinese coins were thin rounded copper coins with a square hole in the centre of it, meant to tie together the money in a string of coins. These small changes‚Äîthe imported Chinese copper coins‚Äîenabled Majapahit further invention, a method of savings by using a slitted earthenware coin containers. These are commonly found in Majapahit ruins; the slit is the small opening to put the coins in. The most popular shape is boar-shaped celengan (piggy bank). Some ideas for the scale of the internal economy can be gathered from scattered data in inscriptions. The Canggu inscriptions dated 1358 mentions 78 ferry crossings in the country (mandala Java). Majapahit inscriptions mention a large number of occupational specialities, ranging from gold and silver smiths to drink vendors and butchers. Although many of these occupations had existed in earlier times, the proportion of the population earning an income from non- agrarian pursuits seems to have become even more significant during the Majapahit era. The great prosperity of Majapahit was probably due to two factors. First, the northeast lowlands of Java were suitable for rice cultivation, and during Majapahit's prime, numerous irrigation projects were undertaken, some with government assistance. Second, Majapahit's ports on the north coast were probably significant stations along the route to obtain the spices of Maluku, and as the spices passed through Java, they would have provided an essential source of income for Majapahit. The Nagarakertagama states that the fame of the ruler of Majapahit attracted foreign merchants from afar, including Indians, Khmers, Siamese, and Chinese, among others. While in a later period, Yingya Shenglan mentioned that large numbers of Chinese traders and Muslim merchants from the west (from Arab and India, but mostly from Muslim states in Sumatra and Malay peninsula) are settling in Majapahit port cities, such as Tuban, Gresik and Hujung Galuh (Surabaya). A special tax was levied against some foreigners, possibly those who had taken up semi-permanent residence in Java and conducted some type of enterprise other than foreign trade. The Majapahit Empire had trading links with Chinese Ming dynasty, Annam and Champa in present-day Vietnam, Cambodia, Siamese Ayutthayan, Burmese Martaban and the south Indian Vijayanagara Empire. =Spread of Islam and Muslim trading network= Arabian dhow modelled after 9th century Belitung shipwreck. The Muslim traders had spread the Islamic faith across the trade routes that connect to the Islamic World. The routes spanned from the Mediterranean, the Middle East, India, Maritime Southeast Asia to China. Muslim traders from the Arabian peninsula and the Persian Gulf have sailed the Indonesian archipelago on their way to China since at least the 9th century, as testified through the discovery of Belitung shipwreck that contains cargoes from China, discovered offshore of Belitung island. The Muslim traders and proselytiser had encouraged the rise of Islamic states in the archipelago. By the 13th century, Islam had gained its foothold in the archipelago through the establishment of Samudra Pasai in Aceh and Ternate Sultanate in the Maluku Islands. The spice-producing Maluku islands gained its name from Arabic \\"Jazirat al Muluk\\" which means \\"the peninsula or islands of kings\\". By the 14th century, these Muslim ports began to thrive as they welcome Muslim traders from India and the Middle East. Among the most notable Muslim kingdoms are the Malacca Sultanate that control the strategic Malacca Strait and the Demak Sultanate that replaced Majapahit as the regional power in Java. Both were also active in spreading Islam in the archipelago, and by the late 15th century, Islam has supplanted Hinduism and Buddhism in Java and Sumatra, and Sulawesi and northern Maluku as well. The Islamic polities in the archipelago formed parts of the more extensive Islamic trading networks that spanned from Al-Andalus in the West to Muslim trading colonies in Chinese ports of the East, as spices from Indonesia like cloves, nutmeg and pepper could reach spice markets in Canton, Damascus and Cairo.  Colonial era  =The arrival of Europeans and the spice and cash-crop trade= The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia's Banda Islands. Once one of the world's most valuable commodities, it drew the first European colonial powers to Indonesia. The Portuguese were the first Europeans to reach the Indonesian archipelago. Their quest to dominate the source of the lucrative spice trade in the early 16th century, and their simultaneous Roman Catholic missionary efforts, saw the establishment of trading posts and forts, and a strong Portuguese cultural element that remains substantial in modern Indonesia. Starting with the first exploratory expeditions sent from the newly-conquered Malacca in 1512, the Portuguese fleet began to explore much of archipelago and sought to dominate the sources of valuable spices. However, the Portuguese presence was later reduced to Solor, Flores and Timor (see Portuguese Timor) in modern-day Nusa Tenggara, due to their 1575 defeat at Ternate at the hands of indigenous Ternateans, and its defeat to the Dutch. In the early 17th century, the VOC was founded. Its main business was profiting in intra-Asian trade and establishing direct spice trade between the archipelago and Europe. One by one, the Dutch began to wrestle Portuguese possessions that started with Dutch conquests in Ambon, northern Maluku and Banda, and a general Portuguese failure for sustained control of trade in the region. Statistically, the VOC eclipsed all of its rivals in the Asian trade. Between 1602 and 1796, the VOC sent almost a million Europeans to work in the Asiaan trade on 4,785 ships and netted for their efforts more than 2.5 million tons of Asian trade goods. The VOC enjoyed huge profits from its spice monopoly through most of the 17th century. VOC took huge profit from monopolising the Maluku spice trade, and in 1619 the VOC established a capital in the port city of Jacatra and changed the city name into Batavia (present-day Jakarta). Over the next two centuries, the VOC acquired additional ports as trading bases and safeguarded their interests by taking over surrounding territory.Vickers (2005), p. 10 It remained a paramount trading concern and paid an 18% annual dividend for almost 200 years. =Dutch East Indies= Workers pose at the site of a railway tunnel under construction in the mountains, 1910. The Dutch East Indies was formed from the nationalised colonies of the VOC, which came under the administration of the Dutch government in 1800. The economic history of the colony was closely related to the economic health of the Netherlands.Dick, et al. (2002) Despite increasing returns from the Dutch system of land tax, Dutch finances had been severely affected by the cost of the Java War and the Padri War, and the loss of Belgium in 1830 brought the Netherlands to the brink of bankruptcy. In 1830, a new Governor-General, Johannes van den Bosch, was appointed to make the Indies pay their way through the Dutch exploitation of its resources. With the Dutch achieving political domination throughout Java for the first time in 1830,Ricklefs (1991), p 119 it was possible to introduce an agricultural policy of government-controlled forced cultivation. Termed cultuurstelsel (cultivation system) in Dutch and tanam paksa (forced plantation) in Indonesian, farmers were required to deliver fixed amounts of specified crops such as sugar or coffee as a form of tax.Taylor (2003), p. 240 Much of Java eventually became a Dutch plantation and revenue rose continually through the 19th century which were reinvested into the Netherlands to save it from bankruptcy.* Between 1830 and 1870, one billion guilders were taken from the archipelago, which on average, making 25% of the annual Dutch government budget. The Cultivation System, however, brought much economic hardship to the Javanese peasants who suffered famine and epidemics in the 1840s. Map of the Dutch East Indies in 1818 Critical public opinion in the Netherlands led to much of the Cultivation System's excesses being eliminated under the agrarian reforms of the \\"Liberal Period.\\" Dutch private capital flowed in after 1850, especially in tin mining and plantation estate agriculture. The Billiton Company's tin mines off the eastern Sumatra coast was financed by a syndicate of Dutch entrepreneurs, including the younger brother of King William III. Mining began in 1860. In 1863, Jacob Nienhuys obtained a concession from the Sultanate of Deli for a large tobacco estate.Dick, et al. (2002), p. 95 The Dutch East Indies were opened up to private enterprise, and Dutch business people set up large, profitable plantations. Sugar production doubled between 1870 and 1885. New crops such as tea and cinchona flourished, and rubber was introduced, leading to dramatic increases in Dutch profits. Changes were not limited to Java or agriculture; oil from Sumatra and Borneo became a valuable resource for industrialising Europe. Dutch commercial interests expanded off Java to the outer islands with increasingly more territory coming under direct Dutch control or dominance in the latter half of the 19th century. However, the resulting scarcity of land for rice production, combined with dramatically increasing populations, especially in Java, led to further hardships. The colonial exploitation of the archipelago's wealth contributed to the industrialisation of the Netherlands, while simultaneously laying the foundation for the industrialisation of Indonesia. The Dutch introduced coffee, tea, cacao, tobacco and rubber and large expanses of Java became plantations cultivated by Javanese peasants, collected by Chinese intermediaries, and sold on overseas markets by European merchants. In the late 19th century, economic growth was based on substantial world demand for tea, coffee, and cinchona. The government invested heavily in a railroad network (150 miles long in 1873, 1,200 in 1900), as well as telegraph lines, and entrepreneurs opened banks, shops and newspapers. The Dutch East Indies produced most of the world's supply of quinine and pepper, over a third of its rubber, a quarter of its coconut products, and a fifth of its tea, sugar, coffee, and oil. The profit from the Dutch East Indies made the Netherlands one of the world's most significant colonial powers. The Royal Packet Navigation Company shipping line supported the unification of the colonial economy and brought inter-island shipping through to Batavia, rather than through Singapore, thus focusing more economic activity on Java.Vickers (2005), p. 20 The worldwide recession of the late 1880s and early 1890s saw the commodity prices on which the colony depended collapse. Journalists and civil servants observed that the majority of the Indies population were no better off than under the previous regulated Cultivation System economy and tens of thousands starved.Vickers (2005), p. 16 Commodity prices recovered from the recession, leading to increased investment in the colony. The sugar, tin, copra and coffee trade on which the colony had been built thrived, and rubber, tobacco, tea and oil also became principal exports.Vickers (2005), p. 18 Political reform increased the autonomy of the local colonial administration, moving away from central control from the Netherlands, while power was also diverged from the central Batavia government to more localised governing units. The world economy recovered in the late 1890s and prosperity returned. Foreign investment, especially by the British, were encouraged. By 1900, foreign-held assets in the Dutch East Indies totalled about 750 million guilders ($300 million), mostly in Java.Dick, et al. (2002), p. 97 After 1900, upgrading the infrastructure of ports and roads was a high priority for the Dutch, with the goal of modernising the economy, facilitating commerce, and speeding up military movements. By 1950, Dutch engineers had built and upgraded a road network with 12,000 km of asphalted surface, 41,000 km of metalled road area and 16,000 km of gravel surfaces.Marie-Louise ten Horn-van Nispen and Wim Ravesteijn, \\"The road to an empire: Organisation and technology of road construction in the Dutch East Indies, 1800-1940,\\" Journal of Transport History (2009) 10#1 pp 40-57 In addition, the Dutch built of railways, bridges, irrigation systems covering 1.4 million hectares (5,400 sq mi) of rice fields, several harbours, and 140 public drinking water systems. Wim Ravesteijn has said that \\"With these public works, Dutch engineers constructed the material base of the colonial and postcolonial Indonesian state.\\"Wim Ravesteijn, \\"Between Globalization and Localization: The Case of Dutch Civil Engineering in Indonesia, 1800‚Äì1950,\\" Comparative Technology Transfer and Society, 5#1 (2007) pp. 32‚Äì64, quote p 32 = The Japanese occupation = The Dutch East Indies fell to invading forces of the Japanese Empire in 1942. During World War II, the economy of Dutch East Indies was more or less crumbled, as every resource was directed toward war efforts of the empire, as the Japanese occupation forces applied strict martial policies. Many basic necessities such as food, clothing and medicine are scarce, and some regions even suffered famine. By early 1945, Japanese forces began to lose the war, culminating in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. During the Japanese occupation, the average height of the Indonesian population has decreased. As the change of a population's average height can be interpreted as a sign of economic development, Baten, Stegl and van der Eng found out that the people in Indonesia were able to grow on average after the occupation since the establishment of food or medical supply and a reduction of diseases was reassured. Thus, due to enhanced nutrition and medical supply (therefore an increase of the average height), the Indonesian economy was able to improve after the Japanese occupation. Baten, J√∂rg; Stegl, Mojgan; van der Eng, Pierre: ‚ÄúLong-Term Economic Growth and the Standard of Living in Indonesia  Modern era  =Sukarno presidency= Early Indonesian 1 rupiah banknote, issued in 1945, shortly after Indonesian National Revolution started. On 17 August 1945, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta proclaimed the independence of Indonesia. Amid the turmoil, Indonesia issued its first rupiah banknotes in 1945. Between 1945 and 1949, Indonesia was embroiled in a war of independence against Dutch re-colonisation efforts. The economic conditions were plunged into chaos, especially in Java and Sumatra, as people struggled to survive the war. In the 1960s, the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability. They had a young and inexperienced government, which resulted in severe poverty and hunger. By the time of Sukarno's downfall in the mid-1960s, the economy was in chaos with 1,000% annual inflation, shrinking export revenues, crumbling infrastructure, factories operating at minimal capacity, and negligible investment. =Suharto presidency= Under Suharto's New Order administration, Indonesia enjoyed sustained economic development (1970s to 1996). Following President Sukarno's downfall, the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down, stabilised the currency, rescheduled foreign debt, and attracted foreign aid and investment. (See Berkeley Mafia). Indonesia was until recently Southeast Asia's only member of OPEC, and the 1970s oil price hike provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates, averaging over 7% from 1968 to 1981.Schwarz (1994), pp. 52‚Äì7. GDP per capita grew 545% from 1970 to 1980 as a result of the sudden increase in oil export revenues from 1973 to 1979. Due to high levels of regulation and dependence on declining oil prices, the growth slowed to an average of 4.3% per annum between 1981 and 1988. Subsequently, a range of economic reforms were introduced in the late 1980s including a managed devaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness, and deregulation of the financial sector.(Schwarz (1994), pages 52‚Äì57) Foreign investment flowed into Indonesia, particularly into the rapidly developing export-oriented manufacturing sector. As a result, the economy grew by an average of over 7% from 1989 to 1997.Schwarz (1994), pages 52‚Äì57. Such high growth, however, masked several structural weaknesses in the economy. Growth came at a high cost in terms of weak and corrupt institutions, severe public indebtedness through mismanagement of the financial sector, the rapid depletion of Indonesia's natural resources, and culture of favours and corruption in the business elite. Corruption particularly gained momentum in the 1990s, reaching to the highest levels of the political hierarchy. As a result, the legal system was fragile, and there was no effective way to enforce contracts, collect debts, or sue for bankruptcy. Banking practices were very unsophisticated, with collateral-based lending the norm and widespread violation of prudential regulations, including limits on connected lending. Non-tariff barriers, rent-seeking by state-owned enterprises, domestic subsidies, barriers to domestic trade and export restrictions all contributed to economic distortions. 1997 Asian financial crisis Indonesia followed Thailand in abandoning the fixed exchange rate of its currency on 14 August 1997. The rupiah further devalued to its lowest point following the signing of the second IMF letter of intent on 15 January 1998. The 1997 Asian financial crisis that began to affect Indonesia mid-year became an economic and political crisis. Indonesia's initial response was to float the rupiah, raise key domestic interest rates, and tighten fiscal policy. In October 1997, Indonesia and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reached agreement on an economic reform program aimed at macroeconomic stabilisation and elimination of some of the country's most damaging economic policies, such as the National Car Program and the clove monopoly, both involving family members of President Suharto. The rupiah remained weak, however, and President Suharto was forced to resign in May 1998. In August 1998, Indonesia and the IMF agreed on an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) under President B. J. Habibie that included significant structural reform targets. Abdurrahman Wahid took office as president in October 1999, and Indonesia and the IMF signed another EFF in January 2000. The new program also has a range of economic, structural reform and governance targets. The effects of the financial and economic crisis were severe. By November 1997, rapid currency depreciation had seen public debt reach US$60 billion, imposing severe strains on the government's budget. In 1998, real GDP contracted by 13.1%. The economy reached its low point in mid-1999, and real GDP growth for the year was 0.8%. Inflation reached 72% in 1998 but slowed to 2% in 1999. The rupiah, which had been in the Rp 2,600/USD1 range at the start of August 1997 fell to 11,000/USD1 by January 1998, with spot rates around 15,000 for brief periods during the first half of 1998. It returned to 8,000/USD1 range at the end of 1998 and has generally traded in the Rp 8,000‚Äì10,000/USD1 range ever since, with fluctuations that are relatively predictable and gradual. =Post-Suharto era= Indonesian rupiah banknotes. In late 2004, Indonesia faced a 'mini- crisis' due to international oil prices rises and imports. The currency reached Rp 12,000/USD1 before stabilising. The government was forced to cut its massive fuel subsidies in October, which were planned to cost $14 billion for 2005. This led to a more than doubling in the price of consumer fuels, resulting in double-digit inflation. The situation eventually stabilised, but the economy continued to struggle with inflation at 17% in 2005. Economic growth accelerated to 5.1% in 2004 and reached 5.6% in 2005. For 2006, Indonesia's economic outlook was more positive. Real per capita income has reached fiscal year of 1996/1997 levels. Growth was driven primarily by domestic consumption, which accounts for roughly three-fourths of Indonesia's gross domestic product. The Jakarta Stock Exchange was the best performing market in Asia in 2004 up by 42%. Problems that continue to put a drag on growth include low foreign investment levels, bureaucratic red tape, and pervasive corruption which causes 51.43 trillion rupiah or (US$5.6 billion) or approximately 1.4% of GDP to be lost annually. However, there was unyielding optimism with the conclusion of peaceful elections during 2004 and the election of the reformist president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. The unemployment rate in February 2007 was 9.75%. Despite a slowing global economy, Indonesia's economic growth accelerated to a ten-year high of 6.3% in 2007. This growth rate was sufficient to reduce poverty from 17.8% to 16.6% based on the government's poverty line and reversed the recent trend towards jobless growth, with unemployment falling to 8.46% in February 2008. Unlike many of its more export-dependent neighbours, Indonesia managed to skirt the Great Recession, helped by strong domestic demand (which makes up about two-thirds of the economy) and a government fiscal stimulus package of about 1.4% of GDP. After India and China, Indonesia became the third-fastest growing economy in the G20. The $512-billion-economy expanded 4.4% in the first quarter from a year earlier, and in the previous month, the IMF revised its 2009 forecast for the country to 3-4% from 2.5%. Indonesia enjoyed stronger fundamentals with the implementation of wide-ranging economic and financial reforms, including a rapid reduction in public and external debt, strengthening of corporate and banking sector balance sheets and reduction of bank vulnerabilities through higher capitalisation and better supervision. The unemployment rate of Indonesia for 2012 is at 6% as per Vice-President of Indonesia Dr. Boediono.

It is at the highest point in the city, atop Well's Hill. It is today (2019) part of a memorial to Southern soldiers who died during the Civil War. It is adjacent to Blandford Cemetery, which is much more important historically than the church. The Blandford Cemetery did not exist until after the church building had been abandoned, in the early 1800s, and the land purchased by the city to use as a cemetery. The Blandford Church, also known as St. Paul's Church or simply \\"The Brick Church\\", was erected in 1736 on Well's Hill, the highest point in Petersburg. In 1781, during the American Revolution, the Battle of Blandford, also known as the Battle of Petersburg, was fought nearby. Following the battle Major General William Phillips was ordered back to Petersburg to meet Lord Cornwallis who was moving north From Wilmington, North Carolina. While in Petersburg awaiting the arrival of Cornwallis, Phillips fell ill and died on 13 May 1781. He was secretly buried somewhere in the churchyard. The church building was abandoned in 1806 after the construction of another Episcopal church in Petersburg when the Town of Blandford in Prince George County was absorbed by Petersburg. It became \\"an ivy-clad picturesque shell.\\" During the Civil War the church served as a major telegraph station. It was used as a field hospital, most notably after the Battle of the Crater on July 30, 1864. Necessary repairs for its preservation were made by the City of Petersburg in 1882. A Ladies' Memorial Association of Petersburg was founded in 1866 and took on preserving the former church as a memorial to the large number of Confederate soldiers buried in the adjacent cemetery. (Some 30,000 were buried unidentified in mass graves.) It is one of the oldest non-religious women's organizations in the country. Between 1889 and 1905, the Ladies Memorial Association paid for a pulpit and 34 pews. The windows were restored temporarilily with clear glass. The Ladies Memorial Association requested from the eleven Confederate states, plus the slave states of Maryland and Missouri, funds to commission stained-glass windows. (Only Kentucky declined.) Between 1904 and 1912, windows were created and installed by Louis Comfort Tiffany. Each of the large windows contains the image of a Saint, and symbols associated with that Saint. In addition to the thirteen state windows, Tiffany donated one, as did the Ladies Memorial Association. The stained glass half-round window over the church door contains the name Ladies Memorial Association of Petersburgh, VA, the dates 1866‚Äì1909, and in the center, the only Confederate flag Tiffany is known to have made, together with the dates 1861‚Äî1865. As the city's Web site puts it, it is a shrine to its 'Lost Cause.'\\"  History  At their meeting on November 18, 1900, the Ladies' Memorial Association decided to ask permission to make \\"Old Blandford Church\\" into a \\"mortuary and memorial chapel. \\"Minutes, LMA meetings of May 1, 1899 and Nov. 18, 1900 Fifteen windows were installed between 1904 and 1912. Most display a state seal, the figure of a saint, and an inscription. Eleven were donated by each of the former Confederate states: North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Arkansas. Two were donated by Missouri and Maryland. Kentucky, another border state, was the only state that refused to participate. In addition, there is a window of a Christian cross of jewels donated by Louis Comfort Tiffany.Peters, John. Blandford Cemetery: Death and Life at Petersburg, Virginia. Petersburg, VA.

R. sirensis is known as the Sira poison frog. R. sirensis is kept as a pet by herpetoculturists and is considered to be one of the more difficult poison dart frogs to keep due to its relative rarity and the delicate nature of its tadpoles.  Poison  Like most Ranitomeya species, R. sirensis is a mildly toxic poison dart frog.http://www.dendrobase.de/index.php?gattung=Ranitomeya&art;=sirensis&id;=12220 Its skin secretes small amounts of pumiliotoxins which coat the frog and cause pain and mild muscle spasms if the frog is handled carelessly. The symptoms may be more severe if the frog is ingested, but unlike the Phyllobates and Oophaga species, R. sirensis secretes the comparatively mild pumiliotoxin C in very small quantities due to its tiny size. As a result, sirensis mostly rely on their agility, speed, and ability to take shelter in the leaf litter or in dense foliage for protection. R. sirensis, as with all dendrobatid frogs, loses its poison in captivity. The reason for the loss of its toxicity is thought to be the removal of a toxic insect or other invertebrate from the diet. Scientists have determined that members of the genus Phyllobates derive their dangerously potent toxins from local melyrid beetles.Most poisonous creature update: mystery solved As R. sirensis is much less toxic than the Phyllobates species, the source of its toxin is not thought to be melyrid beetles; instead, it is likely an invertebrate that remains undiscovered. Habitat and conservation R. sirensis inhabits premontane, montane and lowland moist secondary tropical forests. It tolerates some degree of habitat modification. It is collected for illegal pet trade, which is a threat particularly to isolated subpopulations with extreme colour morphs.

She earned a B.A. degree in Classics from Hunter College and an M.A. degree in literature from Columbia University. Tehilla originally ran the religious school of the Society of Jewish Science in New York, where she also taught Hebrew and Bible. She became the spiritual leader of the Society of Jewish Science when her husband Morris, who had been its leader, died in 1938. Morris's will had declared that the position should go to one of their sons, or to Tehilla if neither of their sons was willing, which as it turned out they were not. Thus Tehilla became the first Jewish American woman with a pulpit (although she never sought or received rabbinic ordination) and the first to serve as the spiritual leader of an ongoing Jewish congregation. On December 4, 1938, Tehilla gave her first sermon as the new leader of the Society of Jewish Science. It was entitled ‚ÄúThe Power of Thought.‚Äù According to the New York Times, which gave a brief notice to the event, over five hundred people attended this sermon. She continued to preach from the pulpit until 1972. She gave over five hundred sermons in all.

The seat of the Viceroyalty was located in Pskov. Both the predecessor and the successor of the viceroyalty was Pskov Governorate. In terms of modern administrative division of Russia, the area of the viceroyalty is currently split between Pskov, Leningrad, Tver, and Novgorod Oblasts. History Pskov Governorate with the seat in the town of Opochka was established in 1772 to accommodate vast areas transferred to the Russian Empire as the result of the First Partition of Poland. The governorate was too big for practical governance, and in 1776, it was divided into Pskov (with the seat in Pskov) and Polotsk Governorates. According to the general line of the administrative reforms by Catherine the Great, on 23 August 1777 the governorate was transformed into viceroyalty. Simultaneously, Luga (newly founded), Kholm, and Novorzhev (formerly Arshansky Stan) obtained the town status, and Izborsk, though retained the town status, ceased to be the center of an uyezd. The vice-royalty was subdivided into ten uyezds, *Pskovsky Uyezd (with the administrative center located in Pskov); *Gdovsky Uyezd (Gdov); *Kholmsky Uyezd (Kholm); *Luzhsky Uyezd (Luga); *Novorzhevsky Uyezd (Novorzhev); *Opochetsky Uyezd (Opochka); *Ostrovsky Uyezd (Ostrov); *Porkhovsky Uyezd (Porkhov); *Toropetsky Uyezd (Toropets); *Velikoluksky Uyezd (Velikiye Luki). On 11 November 1777 Gdovsky and Luzhsky Uyezds were transferred to Saint Petersburg Governorate, and on 7 June 1782 Pechorsky Uyezd, with the administrative center in Pechory, was established by splitting Pskovsky Uyezd. In 1796, Paul I performed a new administrative reform. Kholmsky, Novorzhevsky, and Pechorsky Uyezds were abolished, and the viceroyalty was transformed into Pskov Governorate in the same borders. Governors The administration of the viceroyalty was performed by a namestnik (vice-roy) and controlled by a governor general. The governors of Pskov Viceroyalty were * 1777 Khristophor Romanovich Nolken; * 1778-1781 Pavel Dmitriyevich Mansurov; * 1781-1785 Alexey Nikitovich Kozhin; * 1785-1788 Ivan Alfyorovich Pol; * 1788-1796 Khariton Lukich Zuyev.

Career  Born in Paris into a musical family of art historians and conservators, she was the seventh of ten children, and in 1957, gained admission to the Conservatoire de Paris, studying piano and harpsichord. Having decided on her specialty, she studied harpsichord with Huguette Dreyfus in Paris, Ruggero Gerlin in Siena and with Ralph Kirkpatrick at Yale University. A significant competition prize in Paris in 1963 led to engagements in Italy and Germany. Verlet was widely praised for her recordings of Bach's music, including the Goldberg Variations. She is perhaps best known for having played the music of her compatriot Fran√ßois Couperin, displaying exceptional sensitivity and imagination. Verlet recorded Couperin's complete works in the 1970s and 80s, and in late 2011 she returned to re-record five 'ordres' on the period Henri Hemsch harpsichord. Verlet wrote a poem in celebration of Couperin which accompanied the release, the closing lines of which exemplify her great imaginative empathy with this key French composer: Verlet died at the age of 76.Mort de la claveciniste Blandine Verlet, exceptionnelle interpr√®te de Fran√ßois Couperin on Le Figaro (31 12 2018)  Personal Life  Blandine Verlet's father, Pierre Verlet, was the head of the decorative arts department of the Louvre from 1933 to 1972; her mother, Nicole Verlet-R√©aubourg, was an art historian; and her sister, Colombe Samoyault-Verlet, was also a historian and conservator.

He was born in 1903, in a cottage on the Fyvie Castle Estate in Aberdeenshire, where his father was head gardener and piper to Lord Leith. The family was musical - Peter, his father, was a good fiddler as well as a piper and Hector's brother Pat was also a fine, prize-winning piper. No surprise, then, that he began playing very early in life. As a young man he received some classical training in Edinburgh, which may help to account for the full and generous sound he made, particularly in slow airs; but valuable as this experience was, it never blurred or diluted his awareness of the aural tradition going back to the Gows which he venerated and came to embody. Like his father, he became an estate gardener, eventually at Keithhall House, Inverurie, the residence of the Earl of Kintore. By this time (1933) he was much in demand as a player at social occasions and eventually on Radio Aberdeen. During the War he served in the Royal Artillery and was with the Eighth Army from El Alamein to Trieste when the War ended. He talked little of his wartime experiences, but was at this time that he determined that, should he survive, he would devote himself as far as possible to keeping the tradition of Scottish fiddle playing alive. Home again, he began to make recordings on the Parlophone label, for the School of Scottish Studies and the BBC. His small cottage in Cults became the centre for visits from many enthusiasts of Scottish fiddling. He judged many fiddle competitions, and it was at one of these, in the City Hall in Perth, that he met Yehudi Menuhin for the first time. Menuhin was greatly impressed by his playing and his knowledge of the ins and outs of traditional Scottish fiddling and in 1974 they made a television programme (Mr. Menuhin's Welcome to Blair Castle) on Scots Fiddle Music in Blair Castle, where Niel Gow, the doyen of Scots fiddlers, had played regularly 200 years before. Of MacAndrew, Menuhin wrote, \\"What he knew could only be learned from people with a great musical tradition, and I have a kind of reverence, almost awe, for someone who represents a tradition as exciting as that. .... ... to me, of course, he was the voice of Scotland. When I met this man and heard him play, I knew I was in the presence of Scottish history.\\" He died six years later on 5 April 1980, following a stroke, acknowledged by such as Ron Gonnella, Ian Powrie and Willie Hunter as the greatest Scots fiddler of his generation. Hector MacAndrew was an expert in the playing of pipe music on the fiddle. He had many friends among the piping community, men who admired his approach to \\"their\\" tunes. Of contemporary pipers he particularly admired G. S. McLennan, Angus Mackay and William Lawrie. Yet to him the strathspey was the soul of Scots fiddling. He never played for dancing, and his approach to these tunes, which was personal, led him to use whichever tempo he felt suited to a particular melody. A favourite strathspey was \\"Craigellachie Bridge\\" by William Marshall (1748-1833), and indeed he also liked Marshall's inventive reels and, perhaps, the technical challenge that some of Marshall's music offered - once, when asked why he wrote music that was so difficult to play, Marshall answered (uncompromisingly) that he \\"did not write for bunglers\\"; MacAndrew enjoyed and admired this challenging music, and of all fiddle composers, it was Marshall he regarded most highly (though he also had a soft spot for Peter Milne). MacAndrew was himself a considerable composer of fiddle tunes, and a book of his tunes, 97 of them, The MacAndrew Collection, was published in 2002. His air, \\"Gight Castle\\", is particularly haunting. He was, however, dismissive of his efforts in this field, too much so friends, colleagues and pupils believed, and his aim, he said, was never for publication; but there is no doubt that the eventual book added a valuable addition to the library available to Scots fiddlers. He used traditional techniques to inform his playing: the up-driven bow, 4th. finger unisons, double stopping, bowed, slurred and syncopated triplets and octaves. Of all of these he was an absolute master. His intonation was impeccable and his skill in varying tone quality and colour added much to everything he played, particularly the airs. He had complete technical control - you only need to hear his introduction to \\"Auld Robin Gray\\" with its elaborate double stopping, stopped trills, use of position work and rapid semi-quavers to be aware of that. One of his pupils, Douglas Lawrence, describes how MacAndrew played the final movement of the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto from memory sitting cross-legged on the arm of the settee in the Lawrence cottage on the Black Isle. He did not use microphones; unlike some even quite famous players, he respected the fine Pietro Guarneri violin he used, dusting excess rosin away and keeping it always in good order.

The name started out as a simple continuation of the previous A-, B-, and C-series trucks. It was largely a rebodied version of its predecessors, with a square-rigged look very similar to the period Scout utility vehicle. The Travelall underwent parallel changes to the Light Line trucks. The light line of trucks was marked by a larger range of transmission and wheelbase options than any of its competitors, and in general the lineup aimed to maximize adaptability. The Light Line was also available as a bare chassis, for special purpose applications.Lamm (1971), p. 188. Production ended without replacement in late April 1975, as a hard-pressed International chose to focus on the Scout and on heavier machinery. 1000D-Series International 1100D (1970) Sold as the 1000 through 1500 D-series, the Light Line pickup was originally offered with four of International Harvester's own V8s, with displacements of 266, 304, 345 or 392 cubic inches. AMC's 232 ci inline-six engine had also been available, since the 1968 C-Series. Several different wheelbases (115, 119, 131, 132, 149, 156, or 164 inches) were also offered. The 119 inch version (as used for the Travelall) was only available as a bare chassis. In addition to the regular cab pickup, station wagon \\"Travelall\\" bodywork was also available, as was a four-door panel van version of the wagon and a four-door pickup called the \\"Travelette\\" (only on the 149 or 164 inch wheelbase). The standard transmission was a three-speed manual with a column shift, but there were also four- and five-speed manuals and a three-speed automatics, with floor-mounted shifters optional.International 1200D 4X4 Folder, p. 11-4 The automatic transmission was not available in heavier duty models such as the 1300D and the rare 1500D. Several models were also available as a cab on a bare frame for construction of stake-bed or other applications, some with an optional dual-wheel rear end, with available load ratings up to seven tons. These larger models were not popular, with most buyers opting instead for the Loadstar models. 1010-Series 1971 International 1010-series pickup, with plastic grille For 1971 the Light Line underwent a slight styling change, now with a plastic grille. The naming system also changed, with the \\"D\\" being dropped and with a \\"10\\" being added in the series number. Thus, the new trucks were labelled 1010 through 1510, depending on weight ratings. The engine range was the same as for the earlier pickups, although AMC's 258 six was added later in 1971. The smaller 232 was dropped for 1972, as was the 266 V8 which had still been available in early 1971. From that year on a metal grille with five horizontal bars and a slim central vertical opening was installed instead of the previous plastic unit. As IH's own engines were temporarily in short supply due to the success of the Loadstar medium-duty truck, some 1973 and 1974 pickup trucks received AMC's 401 ci V8 engine instead (called the V-400 on International's option list). The crew cab Travelette was only available on the 1210 series. 1973 International 1210, facelift version with metal grille The 1010 and 1110 have the same weight rating, the difference being in the front suspension: independent, by torsion-bars, for the 1010, and of a solid I-beam construction for the 1110 (and all heavier versions). A first for the segment was the option of a Bendix anti-lock brake system called Adaptive Braking System by International. Operating only on the rear wheels, it was made available the pickups (and Travelalls) in late 1971. Due to the expense of this novel system, it was a rarely selected option. 100-series 1975 International 200-based ambulance in New Zealand For 1974 the naming changed yet again: the trucks were now called 100, 150, 200, or 500 depending on the weight rating. External changes were minimal, consisting mainly of a new five- bar metal grille without the vertical dividers, nicknamed the \\"electric razor grille\\". The two wheel drive chassis received a revised double wishbone independent front suspension and disc brakes replacing the previous torsion bar front end. The engine and transmission was also repositioned lower and further behind the front axle centerline (in preparation for the new MV-series gas and diesel V8 engines that never actually made it into series production). The heavy duty one-ton 500 was only available as a single-cab chassis, and the ¬æ ton 150 was only available with IHC's own line of V8 engines. The program was gradually whittled away. The Travelette crew cab was no longer available with four-wheel drive. Only the 150, 200, and 500-Series remained by the time the 1975s were introduced. By then, only IHC's own V8s were still available, with the claimed outputs down to SAE net. There were two wheelbases available for the regular cab (115 or 132 inches), and two for the Travelette (149 or 166 inches). The beds were either a standard unit or the \\"Bonus Load\\" bed.  End of Production  Pickup (and Travelall) production ended on 28 April 1975, with only about 6,000 made. The last one built was an all-wheel drive IH 200HD cab and chassis, built in IHC's Springfield factory. The Light Line was unable to compete with the Big Three in the light truck market; IHC's market share in this segment had never been higher than 9.5% and had dropped to 4.1% by 1969. Corporate infighting and the 1973-1974 oil crisis served to further undermine International's market, meaning that the Light Line had to be discontinued in spite of the marketing efforts of recently added executive Keith Mazurek (previously of Chrysler Canada). The oil crisis particularly affected International's working trucks, which were the heaviest and least fuel efficient in the market. Another issue of concern was the truck-centered nature of International's dealers, while most competing light trucks were beginning to be sold to suburban buyers in more alluring and better located auto show rooms. International Harvester instead chose to focus on heavier trucks and the popular Scout, which continued to be built until 1980.

Biography Paul S√©journ√© graduated from the √âcole polytechnique in 1873 and the civil engineering grande √©cole √âcole nationale des Ponts et Chauss√©es (ENPC) in 1876, he was appointed Ing√©nieur des ponts et chauss√©es in Mende in 1877, then in Toulouse in 1890. In these two positions, S√©journ√© was responsible for the planning and construction of several railway lines. He made his reputation with innovative methods, and 1886 was decorated with the L√©gion d'honneur, with the citation 'has designed and built on several railway lines in planning or under construction long span bridges which should be considered as a basis for design'. Between 1890 and 1893, S√©journ√© took time off from public service to work for the Fives-Lille company in Spain. In 1896 he left the civil service and joined the Chemins de fer de Paris √† Lyon et √† la M√©diterran√©e (PLM) as chief engineer based in Dijon, all the while continuing to lead other important projects such as the Adolphe Bridge in Luxembourg. He became chief of the construction department of the PLM in 1909. In 1916, Marshal Lyautey named him director of the Moroccan railways. He then returned to the PLM as vice-director in 1919 before retiring at 76 with the title of honorary director. Between 1901 and 1922, S√©journ√© taught the construction of large masonry bridges at the ENPC and published a 6 volume manual Grandes Vo√ªtes ('Great Arches) which brought together all his knowledge on the subject. After winning the Cam√©r√© prize in 1918, he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 1924. In 1926 he was promoted to 'grand officer of the L√©gion d'honneur'. A street of the 6th arrondissement of Paris where Paul S√©journ√© once lived is named in his honor. Technical Contributions Paul S√©journ√© developed some technical innovations : Design and calculation of Centring : S√©journ√© demonstrated the value of constructing arches by parallel sections, so that the centering only had to support the weight of the section under construction. When a section was complete it bore its own weight and the centering could then support the weight of the next section. The Romans used this technique to limit the cost of the centring but since the Renaissance period it had become standard to make centring that could support the full load of the arch and construct the arch in one go. S√©journ√© showed that the older technique was perfectly viable and could lower the weight and cost of the centering by up to 70%. He then introduced twin arches to support a single deck on the Adolph bridge. The weight of the arches is significantly lower, thus reducing the force on the buttresses. He repeated the technique on the Pont des Amidonniers in Toulouse. This technique became widely adopted outside France and was known as the 'S√©journ√© design'. While his contemporaries such as Gustav Eiffel resorted systematically to metalwork, S√©journ√© continued to design and build large span arch bridges in masonry until the end of the 1920s. Thereafter it became cheaper to build with concrete. Works Paul S√©journ√© participated in the following works as: =Designer= 1884 : Pont Antoinette (known as pont de l‚ÄôAiguillou) in S√©malens, Lavaur railway bridge, pont de Saint-Waast at Couffouleux, all three on the Montauban-Ville-Bourbon to La Cr√©made line. 1884 : Pont de Castelet (Ari√®ge), on the Portet-Saint- Simon to Puigcerda line. 1904 : Pont Adolphe in Luxembourg (road bridge over the P√©trusse, with an 84m centre span). 1907 : Pont S√©journ√© carrying the Avenue S√©journ√© over the canal de Brienne in Toulouse. 1908 : Pont de Fontp√©drouse (known as the pont S√©journ√©) and viaduc de la Cabanasse (1910) on the Cerdagne line. 1909 : Viaduc de Chanteloube on the Ubaye line from Chorges to Barcelonette.

It is best known for the opening short story named El emigrante (The Emigrant), a flash fiction story which consist only of the four words \\"¬øOlvida usted algo? -¬°Ojal√°! \\" (\\"Forget something? -If only!\\"). Themes The book opens with El emigrante, one of the most celebrated and frequently cited of microfictions. It is considered the shortest story in the Spanish language. The story may be seen as a summary of the feelings of the characters in the other twelve stories in the book, whether they have left behind love, loneliness or violence. The subject matter of these stories range from romantic love encounters to adultery, with lovers looking to expand their sexuality in random encounters, to relationships with hopelessness and violence, such as a police officer brutally beating his wife after suppressing a demonstration against the military dictatorship of Chile, a mother who abuses her son etc. The stories are set in a range of places from New York City to Valpara√≠so. One of the most important themes of the book is that violent society overshadows our love lives. Reception The book was well received. In addition to the interest aroused by El emigrante, the story El cielo de Neuqu√©n (The Neuqu√©n Sky) won the Edmundo Valad√©s Latin American Short Story Prize. Apart from the recognition, the Edmundo Valad√©s award is worth $50,000 and a trip to the city of Puebla. The book won the prestigious San Luis Potos√≠ national short story award. El Emigrante inspired the installation work ¬øOlvida usted algo? ‚Äì ¬°Ojal√°! by artist Susana Rodr√≠guez, which explores the dialectic between construction and destruction as an event that helps us understand and accept the transformation of life as inevitable. Discussing the title, the artist observed that the four words in Lomel√≠'s story generate many ideas, including ones on subjects you would not normally think about. The story is a perfect title for the project, since one of the most important factors in evolution is learning, which is based on memory.

A. 1924. \\"Australopithecus africanus: The man-ape of South Africa\\". Nature 115: 195-199. which detailed the predatory habits of Australopith species in South Africa involving the manufacture and use of osseous implements. Dart envisaged Australopithecus africanus, known from Taung and Sterkfontein caves, and Australopithecus prometheus (now classified as Au. africanus) from Makapansgat, as carnivorous, cannibalistic predators who utilized bone and horn implements to hunt various animals, such as antelopes and primates, as well as other Australopiths. History In 1947, Wilfred Eitzman, a local schoolteacher, visited the Makapansgat Limeworks in Limpopo, South Africa, where he collected a number of fossil remains, including those of extinct baboon species, which originated from the Australopith-bearing, Member 3 Grey breccia layers. Eitzman promptly sent some of this fossil material to Prof. Raymond Dart at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg for thorough inspection. Dart examined 58 baboon skulls from Eitzman's collections, and recognized a repeated pattern of depressed fractures on the cranial vaults of a number these specimens. Consistent with this pattern, he also found that 4 out of the 6 known Australopith skulls from the Member 3 layers showed similar cranial fractures, although Dart struggled to find an adequate explanation that would account for the frequency of this damage. Eventually Dart concluded that this pattern could have only resulted from ‚Äúpurposeful violence‚Ä¶inflicted by implements held in the hands,‚Äù suggesting that southern African Australopiths used long bones (e.g. femurs and humeri), mandibles, horn cores, etc. as hunting weaponry to satisfy their hyper-carnivorous diets (1949).Dart, R. A. 1949. The predatory implement technique of the Australopithecines. American Journal of Physical Anthropology 7: 1-16. Thus, the ODK hypothesis implied that the rise of the genus Australopithecus from 'hominoid' to 'hominin,' meaning from an ‚Äòape-adaptive grade‚Äô to a more ‚Äòhuman-adaptive grade,‚Äô was borne from the ability of early hominin species to use tools, more specifically weapons. Dart published numerous journal articles on the subject of the ODK hypothesis, which received considerable backlash from his contemporaries. In 1957, he released a comprehensive volume entitled, The Osteodontokeratic Culture of Australopithecus prometheusDart, R. A. 1957. The Osteodontokeratic Culture of Australopithecus prometheus. Transvaal Museum Memoir No. 10. which outlined his arguments for the validity of the \\"predatory transition from Ape to Man\\" (see Dart 1953).Dart, R. A. 1953. The predatory transition from Ape to Man. International Anthropological and Linguistic Review 1: 201-219. To justify his arguments, Dart relied on critical lines of evidence that substantiated the validity of ODK culture, although his critics would eventually turn his evidence against him to refute the hypothesis altogether (see below). Dart suggested that the breakage patterns of the so-called bone implements from the Member 3 Grey breccia layers from Makapansgat displayed evidence of being purposefully broken by the early Australopiths, through cracking and twisting, while fresh. Dart's opinion was that this damage was in no way characteristic of predatory or scavenging animals (e.g. hyenas), and so must have been the result of early hominin dietary activities, mostly likely to access marrow. Furthermore, after the analysis of over 7,000 faunal remains from the Member 3 Grey breccia material, Dart found a statistical over-representation of certain skeletal elements, such as distal humeri, metapodial bones and mandibles. He concluded that such skewed representational patterns could have only resulted from the selection and transportation of fleshy carcass parts of animals into the Makapansgat cave system by Australopiths. Lastly, Dart assigned specific tool uses to different bones elements, e.g. a 'mace' for antelope humeri, etc., similar to the manner in which Mary Leakey created tool types to account for various core morphologies in the Oldowan assemblages at Olduvai Gorge. Initial criticisms & Dart's rebuttal Immediately after the initial publication of Dart‚Äôs ODK hypothesis in 1949, a number of his colleagues refuted the idea as an example of interpretation beyond the limits of scientific evidence. Dr. Wilfrid Le Gros Clark (1957)Clark, W. Le Gros. 1957. Humans and hominids. Review of: The Osteodontokeratic Culture of Australopithecus prometheus, by R. A. Dart. Nature 180: 156. criticized Dart's \\"over-emphatic\\" writing style, and suggested that his hypothesis relied mainly on the fact that no other feasible hypothesis could make sense of the evidence Dart had complied, rather than on the meticulousness of the scientific methods that Dart used to corroborate the existence of the ODK culture. Dr. Sherwood Washburn conducted field research in the Wankie Game Reserve in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where he observed lion kills that were subsequently scavenged by smaller carnivores (e.g. hyenas, jackals and wild dogs). Washburn noted that the process of prey dis-articulation, and in some cases transport, by carnivores was a highly selective process, which produced similar skeletal part representation patterns to those that Dart found in the Member 3 bone assemblages from Makapansgat (cf. Maguire et al. 1980).Maguire, J.; Pemberton, D. & Collett, M. 1980. \\"The Makapansgat Limeworks Grey breccia: hominids, hyaenas, hystricids or hillwash?\\" Palaeontologia africana 23: 75-98. He published the now well-known article \\"Australopithecus: The Hunters or the Hunted?\\" (1957)Washburn, S. 1957. \\"Australopithecus: hunters of the hunted?\\" American Anthropologist 59: 612-614. based upon this research, in which Washburn suggested that southern African Australopiths did not actually hunt other animal species, but rather were hunted and accumulated by cave-dwelling carnivores, most likely by hyenas. This was supported by the presence of two extinct hyenid species found in the Member 3 Grey breccia material, Pachycrocuta brevirostris and Hyaena makapani, as well as the abundance of hyena coprolites within these layers (which had been well-known at the time). Thus, Washburn refuted Dart's ODK hypothesis based upon the same lines of evidence used to support it, and suggested that various hyena species were more likely responsible for the accumulation of bone material in the Australopith-bearing layers at Makapansgat. Despite such refutations, Dart defended the ODK hypothesis for some time relying upon fieldwork conducted by some of his colleagues that seemed to dismiss the claims of Washburn and others, most notably the hyena bone-collector hypothesis. For example, Alun Hughes (1954),Hughes, A. 1954. \\"Hyenas vs. australopithecines as agents of bone accumulation\\". American Journal of Physical Anthropology 12: 476-86. then Dart's assistant, undertook research in the Kruger National Park, South Africa to investigate the bone accumulation habits of hyenid species, reporting that hyenas did not seem to amass bone material inside their dens, and instead consumed prey directly after the kill or in open-air scavenging sites with little evidence of transport behavior (see Dart 1965).Dart, R. A. 1956. \\"The myth of the bone-accumulating hyena\\". American Anthropologist 58: 40-62. Thus, Dart rebutted Washburn's criticisms in arguing that the early Australopiths must have been responsible for the bone accumulations at Makapansgat due to the abundant amount of faunal material found within the cave system, as well as the nature of the breakage patterns. Coupled with the discovery of stone tool assemblages thought to be associated with the robust Australopith species (Zinjanthropus boisei, now classified under the genus Paranthropus) from Olduvai Gorge by Mary and Louis Leakey, this amounting evidence seemed to sway the argument in Dart‚Äôs favor. Furthermore, Dr. John T. Robinson (1959)Robinson, J. T. 1959. \\"A bone implement from Sterkfontein\\". Nature 184: 583-585. (a colleague of Dr. Robert Broom at the Transvaal Museum, and a co- founder of the famous adult Au. africanus skull Sts 5, known as Mrs. Ples), had found a bone tool at Sterkfontein he believed to be used by Au. africanus, which also seemed to corroborate the ODK hypothesis. However, Dart's refutation of the bone-collecting habits of hyenas was short-lived as an overwhelming body of research has found that hyenas do, in fact, accumulate bone material inside caves used as dens. Before Hughes's work in the Kruger National Park, modern zoological research focusing upon hyenas had never been correlated with palaeontological or palaeoanthropological studies of this nature. Due to the inception and on-going significance of taphonomic and palaeozoological research within these fields, it is now well-known and widely accepted that hyenid species transport and accumulate bone material within cave systems used as dens, which can ultimately result in fossil assemblages (see Maguire et al. 1980 and Kuhn et al. 2010).Kuhn, B. F.; Berger, L. R. & Skinner, J. D. 2010. \\"Examining criteria for identifying and differentiating fossil faunal assemblages accumulated by hyenas and hominins using extant hyenid accumulations\\". International Journal of Osteoarchaeology 20: 15-35. The birth of African cave taphonomy Amidst the growing contention surrounding the validity of the ODK hypothesis, a young Southern Rhodesian (now Zimbabwe) researcher, Dr. Charles Kimberlin Brain (\\"Bob\\" Brain) became fascinated with Dart's work describing prehistory's \\"predatory ape-men\\", and conducted research upon the bone breakage and skeletal element representation patterns expounded in Dart's writings (see above). Brain (1967)Brain. C. K. 1967. \\"Bone weathering and the problem of pseudo-bone tools\\". South African Journal of Science 63: 97-99. examined the remains of goat bones within Hottentot villages in Namibia, finding that the skeletal element representation patterns, which formed the crux of Dart's support for the ODK culture, were more simply explained by the durability and resistance of certain bone elements to soil-chemical weathering and the consumption habits of carnivores. This stimulated Brain's interest in how such patterns within cave systems might be affected by the weight, density, cortical thickness and size of bones in relation to weathering and erosion processes. In 1965, Brain took over the directorship of Swartkrans cave (next to Sterkfontein caves) and found a very similar skeletal element representation pattern of fossil faunal remains (including ungulates, primates, large carnivores and hominins) to that of the Makapansgat Member 3 Grey breccia assemblages. This confirmed Brain‚Äôs earlier work that skeletal element representation patterns were more likely generated from factors relating to the resilience of bone to weathering, carnivore damage and diagenesis. Further, he found that the breakage patterns from faunal remains at Swartkrans were consistent with large carnivore damage upon bone, such as leopards and hyenas. During Brain's excavations, he found a partial skull-cap of a juvenile Paranthropus robustus (SK 54) bearing two puncture marks (1970).Brain, C. K. 1970. \\"New finds at the Swartkrans Australopithecine site\\". Nature 225: 1112-1119. Brain found that these punctures aligned perfectly with the spacing of the canines in a leopard mandible. He then summarized the findings of his research spanning nearly 20 years in the authoritative volume entitled, The Hunters or the Hunted?: An Introduction to African Cave Taphonomy (1981)Brain, C. K. 1981. Hunters or the Hunted?: An Introduction to African Cave Taphonomy. University of Chicago Press: Chicago & London. (named after Washburn's famous article, see above), which corroborated Washburn's hypothesis that early Australopiths were not, in fact, responsible for associated fossil accumulations found throughout southern Africa. It instead demonstrated the fact that large carnivore species had played a much more important role in the origination of fossil deposit (especially in the Sterkfontein Valley) bearing Plio-Pleistocene hominin remains, and further that early Australopiths, as Washburn proposed many years ago, were preyed upon by large carnivores and were not actually predators themselves. Subsequently, Brain's work has engendered a body of on-going research critical to our understanding of early hominin species and the ecosystems in which they lived. Brain‚Äôs volume contains an excellent summary of Dart's development of the ODK hypothesis, as well as his detailed refutation to it, which is now recognized as disproving Dart's ideas of the \\"predatory transition from Ape to Man.\\" Popular references Robert Ardrey's African Genesis (1961),Ardrey, R. 1961. African Genesis. Collins: London. which popularized concurrent viewpoints on the evolution of modern humans, contains numerous references to Dart‚Äôs ODK hypothesis. He detailed Dart's evidence for the predatory rise of Australopiths from \\"Ape to Man\\" as the major factor from which modern behavior emerged. One of the most well-known popular references to Dart‚Äôs ODK hypothesis was captured in Stanley Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey (an adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke's short story \\"The Sentinel\\", who also co-authored the screenplay with Kubrick) in which the first part of the film depicts early hominin \\"ape-men\\" as herbivorous animals being preyed upon by leopards (note the possible reference to Brain's work, see above). Then a black monolithic structure descends from the sky, which is inspected and touched by the ape-men who start shrieking and are thrown into a frenzy. One 'ape-man' spontaneously starts to use a bone as a tool, more specifically a weapon, which they use to retake a waterhole, suggesting the ‚Äòdawn of human culture‚Äô began from an extraterrestrial source. Masaaki Hatsumi, founder of the Bujinkan Organization and the current Togakure-ry≈´ Soke (Grandmaster), briefly discussed Dart's ODK hypothesis as a possible scientific explanation for the continuity of the use of weapons throughout human history (2005).Hatsumi, M. 2005.

His flying experience ranged from man carrying kites before the First World War to early jet fighters and helicopters. He designed, built and flew his own glider in the 1930s, designed 36 boats and yachts, and wrote many books describing his flying career and the history of British aviation.  Early life  Harald James Penrose was born at 103 Park Street Hereford on 12 April 1904, the son of James Penrose, an Inland Revenue clerk and his wife, Elizabeth Alice. His fascination with manned flight started at an early age when his father showed him pictures of Bleriot's monoplane. He first flew aged 7 in a man-lifting kite at the dizzying height of 10 ft. His first powered flight was in 1919, in a modified three seat Avro 504K, piloted by Alan Cobham. When he left school in 1920 he was unable to find an apprenticeship in the aircraft industry, so on the advice of Frederick Handley Page he attended the aeronautical engineering course at Northampton Engineering College, London University. During a visit to de Havilland he flew in the prototype Moth as a passenger, piloted by Hubert Broad. As part of his course he undertook industrial placements working for Handley Page Ltd and Westland Aircraft Ltd.  Aviation career  After graduation in 1926 Penrose was employed by Westland Aircraft Ltd He started work on the shop floor, later working as an observer for the test pilot Lawrence Openshaw, then as assistant to Capt. Geoffrey Hill supervising the construction of the Widgeon III prototype. In 1927 he took 3 months unpaid leave and learned to fly with Reserve of Air-Force Officers (RAFO) at Filton. There he first flew Bristol PTMs and later a Bristol Jupiter Fighter. During this training he met Cyril Uwins after the latter's encounter with control reversal in a Bristol Bagshot. Later, Uwins would mentor Penrose in the science of flight testing and they would become good friends. On returning to Westlands he was employed working between the Works and the Design Office. Under the guidance of Westland's new test pilot, Louis Paget, Penrose became involved in test flying.Major Laurence P. Openshaw MA was killed after a mid- air collision on 6 June 1927 while racing the Widgeon I at the Whitsun Air Meeting at Bournemouth He gained his A-licence which allowed him to fly as a private pilot and he flew Widgeons at weekend air displays, eventually becoming responsible for all Widgeon testing. In 1928 he was appointed manager for civil aircraft and the managing director's (Robert Bruce) principal assistant at a salary of ¬£400 per annum. While his main duty was the production of civil aircraft such as the Wessex he was later involved in test flying experimental Wapitis. In 1931 he was sent to Argentina to demonstrate the Wapiti float plane but failed to secure any sales. He returned to England, took ten days leave but was recalled to Westlands after Paget was injured while performing low altitude aerobatics. This accident finished Paget's career but resulted in Penrose being promoted to chief test pilot.  Test pilot  As Westland's chief test pilot, Harald Penrose established a number of unusual aviation records in the 1930s. He made one of the longest emergency glides in 1933, when the Westland Wallace, being prepared for the Huston Everest flight, suffered a fuel pump failure at 37,500 ft. He made the first parachute escape from an aircraft with an enclosed canopy in 1934 when the Westland PV.7 suffered a structural failure during diving trials. This was his first and only descent by parachute. And in the 1930s he accumulated the most flying hours in tailless aircraft, with the Pterodactyl IV and V. Sir Ernest Petter (gunner's cockpit) Geoffrey T.R. Hill (pterodactyl designer) Mr Mettam, Capt. Stuart Keep (Pilot of the ill-fated Westland Dreadnought)(far right) In amongst the test flying he found the time to design and construct (with the aid of his wife, who stitched the fabric covering) the Penrose Pegasus glider. To get a performance comparison, he flew at the August 1935 BGA competition at Sutton Bank, accumulating a total of 6 hours 25 minutes. Up to the outbreak of war, the Pegasus was flown at Kimmeridge when the weather was not compatible with sailing. In the late 1930s, Westlands developed the Lysander and the Whirlwind. Penrose's first flight in the Lysander was in June 1936. This and subsequent flights identified problems that required modification to the tail, The problems with the tailplane incidence were not solved to Harald's satisfaction and may have led to a number of fatal accidents. Prior to flying the Whirlwind, to get experience of aircraft with high wing loadings and retractable undercarriages, Harald flew the Spitfire prototype K5054, the Fairey Battle prototype and a Bristol Blenheim. The first flight in the Whirlwind (October 1936) was unintentional when he became airborne during a straight high speed run, The early test flights were uneventful but in early 1939 a fractured exhaust burnt through the right aileron push rod at 200 ft, requiring instinctive action. This incident caused Teddy Petter to design a less aerodynamic but safer exhaust system.  Second world war  As a reserve officer in the RAF, Penrose expected to be called up at the start of the war. However, at 36 and with valuable experience of test flying he was turned down by the RAF's personnel department. Instead, he returned to Lysander and Whirlwind development. There were plans to use the Lysander for ground strafing during an invasion or as a night fighter. He tested various modified Lysanders fitted with gun turrets, including the tandem wing Lysander fitted with a tail gun turret. In January 1942 he tested the last production Whirlwind, by then the main work at Westland was manufacturing Spitfires and Penrose was responsible for their production test flying. During the war, Penrose had three encounters with the Messerschmitt 109. In first occasion he was testing a production Whirlwind, when emerging from cloud, he realised he was on a collision course with a Messerschmitt and slammed the Whirlwind nose back into the cloud. On the second, he was with his family sailing their dingies 'Tittermouse' and 'Tiddlywinks', when they were buzzed by a low flying German. However, in 1943 he flew a captured aircraft being tested by Rolls Royce. In his memoir he described how he 'froze on the controls and flew very, very straight' when he was intercepted by a RAF Spitfire. Harald Penrose in the Welkin cockpit. Note the automatically inflating peripheral hood seal Basing their design on the Whirlwind, Westland developed the Welkin high altitude interceptor, Penrose flying the prototype in November 1942. He described how the cabin was 'like sitting in an oven' due to the unshielded cabin pressurisation blowers. He developed pneumonia in early 1943 which he attributed to the extreme changes in temperature on leaving the Welkins cabin drenched in sweat and the bitter wind across the airfield. He survived thanks to the recently discovered M&B; drug. As a result of this illness Petter devised a better method for cooling the cabin. Penrose contrasted the arctic conditions in the open cockpits of the PV.3/Wallace during the high altitude flights with the 'delightfully warm' cabin of the Welkin, describing these flights as the 'peak of experience'. In the summer of 1945, he flew a Gloster Meteor as a guest of 616 Squadron. He described it as 'far easier and safer machine than that superb fighter the Spitfire'. But the experience was marred during landing by uncertainty that the undercarriage had locked down while simultaneously running low on fuel.  Post war  = Wyvern = After the war, Penrose led the flight testing of the Westland Wyvern. No other contemporary aircraft proved so lethal as the Wyvern. He attributed its problems to underdeveloped power plants in conjunction with a high wing loading and would later describe it as \\"one of those very nearly very good machines\\". On 12 December 1946, he made the first flight in the Eagle engined prototype . This flight was uneventful, but early in 1947 he was forced to land it at grass airstrip at RAF Warmwell after an engine failure, narrowly missing a hidden concrete block. Other Westland test pilots were not so lucky. Sqn. Ldr. Peter Garner was killed on 15 October 1947 after the failure of the contra-rotating propeller bearing and Sqn. Ldr. Mike Graves was killed on 31 October 1949 after an engine failure in the Python powered prototype. Extraordinarily, Penrose's luck held out and he survived three further emergency landings, one in the summer of 1947 due to an aileron push rod failure, one in October 1951 due to hydraulic failure, the third in February 1952 after an engine failure. It was probably attention to detail (such as wire locking the harness release lock) rather than luck that allowed Harald Penrose to pursue 25 years of test flying in reasonable safety. = Rotorcraft = Under the encouragement of Arthur Davenport and Teddy Petter, Westland's had a long history with rotorcraft starting with the Cierva C.29. In preparation for this work Penrose took an autogyro conversion course at Cierva's Hanworth Air park in 1933, during which he added 10 hours of autogyro flying to his commercial licence. However, neither the Cierva C.29 or its successor the C.30 were successful and Penrose did not fly either of them. In 1944 when Westlands were considering post war business opportunities, Penrose suggested to Davenport that they cash in on their earlier experience of rotorcraft and investigate helicopters. Subsequently, he flew the Sikorsky S-51 under the supervision of Charles 'Sox' Hosegood. While he believed that he could assimilate the piloting techniques because of his earlier experience with autogyros he thought it was wise to get tuition from more experienced pilots, hence Westlands employed Alan Bristow to train Penrose and Peter Garner. Penrose went solo in the Sikorsky S-51 in 1947. In comparison with the Wyvern his flights in helicopters were infrequent, far less arduous and far less risky. In 1953 after 25 years of test Harald retired from the role of chief test pilot to take over Westland's helicopter sales.  Writing career  Harald demonstrated a talent for writing at an early age, winning his school's premier prize for literature. His early books drew on personal experiences, such as I Flew with the Birds (1949), No Echo in the Sky (1958), and Airymouse (1967), In his later works he wrote about the history of the British aircraft industry: Architect of Wings (1985), a biography of the Avro designer Roy Chadwick, Wings across the World (1980), a history of British Airways, and a five-volume history of British aviation.

The scheme gained media attention after Fishwick's early efforts were captured in a series for Channel 4 in 2012, including his call for parliament to reform the banking system. In 2017, BSAL applied to become a UK regulated bank, 'The Bank of Dave', offering an expanded range of products to an expanded audience. History During the financial crisis, Fishwick felt that the current banking system needed change as he felt that traditional high street banks weren't lending enough money to people or small businesses. He also recognised the negative view of larger banks held by the wider population, particularly the 'bonus culture' that these banks' employees were benefiting from. In response to this, he assembled a small team and began lending through BSAL by personally underwriting all loans and assessing the risk of each loan by studying the business models and repayment plans of his customers. Since opening, the scheme has lent to thousands of customers, mainly centred around Lancashire and the North. After six months of trading BSAL had returned a profit, and passed it on to various charities including local food banks and community centres. Media coverage BSAL has received much media attention since it first opened its doors in 2011. The Channel 4 series Bank of Dave, was broadcast in the UK in July 2012, and was later aired around the world by various broadcasters. It followed the creation of the scheme as it opened its doors to the public. A follow-up Scottish BAFTA winning episode named Bank of Dave: Fighting the Fat Cats was shown in February 2013, with Dave's Sunday Times bestselling book of the same title, describing what the venture had entailed, being released later that year. Since then, the UK and international media has maintained its interest in the charismatic entrepreneur behind BSAL, with regular column inches in the mainstream UK and worldwide press, and many TV programmes broadcast on Channel 4 and CNBC on the theme of consumer interest. Lobbying After the first series aired in 2012, Fishwick has continued to lobby parliament to reform the UK's banking system, which has received support from former Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna MP, who supported the idea of a bank looking to \\"serve and grow the local economy rather than just for profit and serving the shareholders\\".

The centre is seen as the main repository for archives and modern records for the whole of North Lanarkshire. History Originally known as Motherwell Heritage Centre, the centre was opened in 1996, and was known as that until April 2012, when all archive and modern records were transferred to Motherwell from its previous location in Cumbernauld. As of April 2013 ownership was transferred from North Lanarkshire Council to CultureNL. Features One of the features at the centre used to include Technopolis where people were allowed to feel part of Lanarkshire's past, by re-creating scenes of eras including heavy industry and steel production. Domestic life of the area is re-created through various talking figures and interactive interpretation. However this part of the Heritage Centre was closed in 2011 and turned over to the storage of paper archives. There is also a gallery room, located at the ground floor, showing exhibitions provided by North Lanarkshire Council and also exhibitions outwith the local council area. Some international exhibitions are also on display there, and exhibitions are updated regularly. The local studies and family research room is where reference media such as PC's and Microfilm are based, that allow visitors to browse through local and personal records, usually to search for family ties or former occupations. Also, based within the heritage centre, is the viewing tower, located on the fifth floor of the building, giving an excellent view of the Clyde Valley region, the Campsie Fells, and of mountains from Tinto Hill to as far back as Ben Lomond, usually only viewable in sunny conditions. As well as those features, there is a gift shop that sells a range of books about local heritage, and also items typical of a museum/heritage centre gift shop (postcards, toys, sweets etc.). The centre is also wheelchair accessible, with lifts in operation inside the centre.

He composed it in Leipzig for the eighth Sunday after Trinity and first performed it on 30 July 1724. It is a chorale cantata from his second annual cycle, based on the hymn \\"\\" (1524) by Justus Jonas, a paraphrase of Psalm 124.  History and words  Bach composed the cantata in his second year in Leipzig for the Eighth Sunday after Trinity. The prescribed readings for the Sunday are from the Epistle to the Romans, \\"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God\\" (), and from the Gospel of Matthew, the warning of false prophets from the Sermon on the Mount (). The cantata text is based on the hymn \\"\\", published in 1524 by the Lutheran reformer Justus Jonas as a paraphrase of Psalm 124. The theme of the psalm, the need of help against raging enemies, corresponds to the Gospel. Compared to Bach's other chorale cantatas of the period, the unknown poet kept much of the original text, six of the eight stanzas, expanding two of them by recitative, to connect even closer to the Gospel. He paraphrased only stanzas 3 and 6 to an aria each. In the last aria, in a statement of opposition to rationalism‚Äîthe \\"weasel words of rationalists, who would bring down the whole Lutheran theological edifice\\" in the words of John Eliot Gardiner‚Äîthe poet expands the words of the reformers' hymn, \\"\\" (reason cannot grasp it), appealing to reason, described as unstable and frenzied, to be silent. Bach first performed the cantata on 30 July 1724, as the eighth chorale cantata of his second annual cycle. Johann Nikolaus Forkel borrowed the manuscripts of Bach's chorale cantatas from Bach's son Friedemann and copied two of the cantatas, , and this cantata.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in seven movements is scored for three vocal soloists‚Äîalto, tenor and bass‚Äîa four-part choir, horn, two oboes, two oboes d'amore, two violins, viola and basso continuo. # Chorale: # Recitative and chorale (alto): # Aria (bass): # Chorale (tenor): # Chorale and recitative (alto, tenor, bass): # Aria (tenor): # Chorale:  Music  As in most of Bach's chorale cantatas, the opening chorus is a chorale fantasia. The chorale tune was published in 1529 by an anonymous author in Wittenberg. The soprano sings this chorale melody line by line, doubled by the horn, as a cantus firmus to the independent concerto of the orchestra. The strings play \\"agitated dotted rhythms\\", the oboes \\"agitated semiquaver cascades\\" throughout the movement, supplying a sense of unity. The lower voices sing partly in homophony, partly in independent movement similar to the instruments. Bach uses the contrast to illustrate the text in the first lines, with no regard to its negation. \\"\\" is set in homophony and the last word \\"\\" (literally: \\"holds\\") is held as a long note, whereas in \\"\\" the raging of the enemies is shown in dotted rhythm and fast runs. When the bar form's is repeated in the following lines, Bach repeats the music also, although it doesn't reflect the text. In the following chorale and recitative, Bach distinguishes the chorale lines from the secco recitative by a continuo line on a repeated motif that is derived from the beginning of the respective melody line, termed \\"in rhythmically compressed form ... four times as fast\\". The first aria shows the image of \\"wild sea surf\\" in undulating movements in the voice, in the obbligato part of the violins in unison, and in the continuo. The bass voice has to sing challenging coloraturas on the words \\"\\" and especially \\"\\" (be wrecked). The center of the cantata is an unchanged stanza of the chorale, the alto's unadorned melody accompanied by the oboes d'amore and the continuo as equal partners. In movement 5, Bach differentiates chorale and recitative differently from the second. The chorale lines are four-part settings, the recitatives are given to individual different singers in the sequence bass, tenor, alto, bass. The continuo unifies the movement by a constant independent regular motion in motifs based on triads. In the last aria Bach invents a setting for strings that illustrates the instability of \\"frenzied reason\\" in syncopated rhythm, interrupted by chords on the repeated appeal \\"\\" (be silent). The drama of the aria rests only at the end of the middle section, when the words \\"\\" (they will be revived with solace) are given by a fermata and the marking adagio. The cantata is closed by two stanzas of the chorale in a four-part setting.

It was designed by architect Milton Caughey (1911-1958) and completed in 1951. In 2007, the building was listed as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument,(Historical Cultural Monument #887), making it one of the few mid-century modern commercial buildings to gain such status.http://www.downsizegreenhollowsquare.org/GreenHollowSquareFEIR- CHCLetter.pdf It was identified by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission as being a well-preserved and notable example of the California- style modern design. The building's best-known feature is an unusual open courtyard which once housed Dutton's bookstore. The building may soon be demolished as a part of the proposed Green Hollow Square development. History  The Barry Building was commissioned by its owner David Barry and completed in 1951 as postwar development was beginning to redefine Brentwood's San Vicente Boulevard's commercial corridor. It is one of Milton Caughey's few commercial buildings. The building's most famous tenant was the Dutton's Bookstore where for more than two decades authors such as Kurt Vonnegut and Isabel Allende held readings and signings. Dutton's Bookstore closed in 2008. It is now home to the Caffe Luxxe. In 2006, ownership of the building turned over to investor Charlie Munger, Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Corporation, the diversified investment corporation chaired by Warren Buffett. Design Architect Milton Caughey graduated from the Yale School of Architecture in 1938 and moved to Los Angeles where, after serving in the navy, he joined architect Gordon Kaufmann. Caughey later opened his own practice designing private residences as well as institutions and school buildings. Caughey was the winner of four Merit Awards by the Southern California Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. Caughey was an early adopter of the use of indoor and outdoor space that is now associated with mid-20th century modern architecture in Southern California. The building features a set of outdoor cantilevered stairs which curve down to a central, two-story courtyard. The flat roof and simple style are emblematic of Caughey's work, which was influenced by Corbusier and the International Style. Architecture The Barry Building's use of simple lines and outdoor space exemplifies mid-20th century modern architecture in Southern California; its open plan shows the influence of Corbusier and the International Style. The building features two cantilevered sets of stairs which sweep down to a central, open two-story courtyard. The interplay of indoor and outdoor space is emblematic of Caughey's work. According to the recommendation report by the Los Angeles Department of City Planning, \\"The Barry Building embodies the aesthetics and stylistic features typical of the experimentation with new ideas that gave such vitality to the architecture of the period...[it] is one of the rare commercial buildings left in West Los Angeles that exemplifies the period of great inspiration and ingenuity in California architecture.\\" Preservation In 2007, the owners started plans to develop the site along with the surrounding property and moved to evict Dutton's Bookstore. At the same time, preservationists requested a review of the building by the Cultural Heritage Commission for potential landmark status, a designation that does not require consent of an owner. In 2007, with the support of Councilman Bill Rosendahl, the Barry Building was declared Historic-Cultural Monument # 887 by the Cultural Heritage Commission. Nonetheless, landmark status does not protect a building from demolition.California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and Historical Resources Under the California Environmental Quality Act, however, the preparation of an environmental impact report (EIR) is required before the granting of a demolition permit for a historic landmark. In 2007, Charles Munger submitted a draft EIR to develop the site, which included numerous surrounding properties.Draft EIR Called Green Hollow Square, the project was initially a 49,300 square-foot commercial center but was redrafted in 2011 and is now a proposed 73,000 square foot commercial space in three new, two-story buildings.http://greenhollowsquare.com/ The final EIR was released in January 2012 in which the developers preference is an option with a retail and restaurant complex that would require the demolition of the Barry Building. In addition, the FEIR includes a preservation alternative which would incorporate the Barry Building.

The experiment was forcefully closed down by the authorities. Origins Before the 1848 Revolutions, Teodor Diamant, a member of the lower nobility, together with other Wallachian intellectuals learnt about the ideas of Charles Fourier, an early French utopian socialist, during Diamant's studies in Paris in the 1830s.Keith Hitchins, Rumania, 1866-1947. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994. , p. 127 He presented his social and economic views in three articles that were published in June 1834 in Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu's Curierul Rom√¢nesc magazine.Dic»õionar Politic: Teodor Diamant at Marxists Internet ArchiveDohotaru, p.132 Foundation In 1835, a year after Diamant returned to Wallachia, he established a phalanstery (an agricultural- industrial community based on Fourier's principles) at the estate in ScƒÉieni owned by boyar Emanoil BƒÉlƒÉceanu. The estate, ridden with debts, had already been put under sequester and the ongoing debt problem prevented the society from acquiring better equipment.Dohotaru, p.133 The first attestation of the society was on March 10, 1835, when BƒÉlƒÉceanu leased the estate to the society, the date being mentioned by BƒÉlƒÉceanu as the start of the phalanstery. The preparations took the rest of the year 1836 and the society began functioning in early 1836. The community The earliest members of the phalanstery were Roma people liberated from slavery by the boyar,Marushiakova, Elena and Vesselin Popov. 2009. \\"Gypsy Slavery in Wallachia and Moldavia\\" In: Kamusella, Tomasz and Krzysztof Jaskulowski, eds. Nationalisms Today. Oxford: Peter Lang, p.22 but the first recruits moved to ScƒÉieni in January 1836. Another group of ten young people who joined the phalanstery on August 18, 1836. It produced both agricultural and handicraft goods, the workday was of only 8 hours, at a time when many peasants worked up to 14‚Äì16 hours a day, however there were no days of rest. The produce of the commune was distributed according to the amount of work performed and the level of skill, assessed through vote by the members of the community and according to the quantity of capital contributed.Ioncioaia, \\"Les promesses de l‚ÄôHarmonie...\\"Dohotaru, p.137-138 Ending The community came into the eyes of the authorities in August 1836 and one of their representatives visited the phalanstery in ScƒÉieni. The report discusses a group of 24 people, wearing odd clothing and who were not very willing to talk about their community. The fact that so many men and women lived in a common household made the authorities presume that it was a brothel. The authorities desired a more thoroughly visit to the community, but BƒÉlƒÉceanu refused. The Phalanstery was terminated in 1836 by the authorities which feared that this kind of experiments would encourage communist beliefs in the country, although the official reason was that the community was not registered properly with the authorities. Although the era's documents say that there was no violence at the disbanding of the phalanstery, some romanticized accounts talk about an exile of the founders (according to Ion Ghica)Ion Ghica, Scrisori cƒÉtre Vasile Alecsandri : Teodor Diamant or clashes between the phalanstery members and the authorities (according to ≈ûtefan Greceanu).Dohotaru, p.133-134 Nevertheless, Emanoil BƒÉlƒÉceanu was arrested at the order of Hospodar Alexandru Ghica, but it seems that the reason was that he refused to change the name of the Agricultural and Manufactural Society, which sounded too similar to an Agricultural Society of the Hospodar. Another reason was the insolence of asking the Hospodar in a petition dated November 1, 1836 for a modern plough. Following the disbanding of the phalanstery, 14 of the former members of the phalanstery filed a complaint at the judicial divan against Manolache BƒÉlƒÉceanu, accusing him of breach of contract and requesting back the money invested, complaining about the living conditions in the phalanstery.Dohotaru, p.134 After that, Teodor Diamant continued envisioning the creation of new phalansteries (\\"agricultural-industrial colonies\\") for the newly liberated slaves in Moldavia in 1841, for this purpose preparing a memorandum to the Administrative Consul of Moldavia, but this was not accepted.

At the European Championships in that year, she won the gold medal in the individual 10 m event, the first individual European gold medal for a British woman in 87 years (1927), and first individual medal of any colour since 1958. She and Couch were split up by British coaches in the synchro event in early 2016, after Barrow had struggled with shin injuries and a non-cancerous tumour. This was despite the fact that Barrow and Couch had been the pair who secured GB's Olympic place in the 10 m synchro event.

He was signed by manager Alan Dicksas a professional in April 1978 for Bristol City. Stevens made his debut for Bristol City in the First Division deputising at right back for Gerry Sweeney in a 0‚Äì2 defeat at Middlesbrough on 8 April 1978, his only appearance in the 1977‚Äì78 season. In 1978‚Äì79 with Sweeney ever present at right back, Stevens did not have the opportunity to appear in the first team as Bristol City finished 13th in the First Division. The following season 1979‚Äì80 Bristol City finished 20th and were relegated to the Second Division. Stevens played in only one game scoring in a 1‚Äì3 defeat in the second leg of the Anglo Scottish Cup at St Mirren on 16 April 1980. In the Second Division the \\"Robins\\" fared badly being in 21st position for most of the season. After a run of only one win in 12 league matches and going six matches without scoring Stevens was introduced at right back when Alan Hay was missing and Sweeney switched to left back. The result was a 1‚Äì0 win v Sheffield Wednesday and Stevens retained his place for the remainder of the season although the \\"Robins\\" only won two more league games and were relegated to the Third Division. Stevens made 14 appearances in 1980‚Äì81. Stevens was the only ever present player in the tumultuous 1981‚Äì82 season when City were relegated for the third successive season this time to the Fourth Division. Stevens made 46 appearances in 1981‚Äì82 scoring one goal. The next highest number of appearances was 33 in this worst of all seasons for the \\"Robins\\". The one redeeming feature was reaching the FA Cup 4th round where City lost 0‚Äì1 to Aston Villa. Stevens began the first ever campaign in the Fourth Division at right back but after an early run of seven games without a win left Bristol City in 23rd place Stevens was replaced when Rob Newman moved across from left back. Stevens made 10 appearances in 1982‚Äì83 as City eventually recovered to a mid table 14th place.

The film is the final chapter in the Girolami's trilogy about Commissioner Betti, after Violent Rome and Violent Naples. The main theme of the film was used in the soundtrack of Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof.  Plot  A crime syndicate starts a crime wave in Turin, they rob a bank, taking a hostage to get away from Police Inspector Betti and Ferrari, his partner. However, the hostage turned out to be their accomplice in disguise. Later, they hijack a school bus full of children to use as ransom. Betti and Ferrari sees through the syndicate's scheme and ambushes them on their next robbery attempt, arresting all but one armed criminal. The remaining criminal takes one of their unarmed mules as hostage, trying the trick they used last time. However Betti sees it through and closes in on them, refusing their demands for a getaway. The armed bandit gambles by releasing all other individuals in the bank to appear genuine, however, the \\"customer\\" taken hostage was a career criminal known to the police and Betti. The police close in on them, forcing the crooks to give up. The remaining criminals hide the schoolchildren in a nearby farm and lay low, but their cover is blown when one of the criminals try to rape a female cyclist nearby, leading Betti and the police close to in on them. They demand a large sum of cash and a getaway car, executing one child in the process. The child's mother, Anna, confronts Betti and blames him for her son's death. All other kids are released except the last one, Betti then offers to take the child's place to secure her release. The criminals agree and blindfolds him and take him away in the getaway car instead. Betti is dumped on the highway and sustained injuries, impressed by his bravery, Anna visits him in the hospital and apologizes for her earlier comments. Betti then begins to round up the syndicate members, first chasing two of them through a wet market. The two crooks flee, but Betti hijacks a car and goes after them. After a lengthy chase, Betti destroys their car and arrests them. Another crook was chased by Betti across the rooftops, the crook panics and shoots him, nearly making Betti fall off the building. They then climb down the scaffolding, the crook tries to hijack a nearby car but was T-boned by a speeding truck, killing him. Betti then goes to the syndicate headquarters, the local sailors' club in Turin. The criminals there set him up by having one of them shoot him. When Betti retaliates in self-defense, the criminals coming to aid the dead crook kicks away his gun and plays the victim card, framing Betti. Betti is then placed under arrest and is awaiting trial. Anna visits Betti in detention and gives him courage. During a pre-engineered prison riot, the arrested syndicate members also in detention climbs over the wall to solitary confinement and tries to kill Betti, but was beaten down. With enough evidence against the syndicates, Betti had his charges dropped and was reinstated. Betti and the police plan a major assault on the sailors' club. Leading to the death of many crooks, one of them escapes in a detective car, running over Ferrari in the process. Betti gives chase but was blocked by a piece of damaged scaffolding. The boss of the syndicate prepares a meeting to consider the situation, but was run over by a biker gang as he prepares to board his limo. He was taken to a private hospital. Upon hearing the police are on their way, he escapes through a broken window and hails a taxi, with Betti following him. Being stalked at every turn and their arrests imminent, the remaining criminals gathers at the airport and prepares to flee Italy, with Betti watching their every move in a nearby car. As revenge for taking down their operations, the syndicate orders a hit on Betti. While on a date with Anna, Betti was gunned down in a hail of bullets from a drive-by thus ending the trilogy story of Commissar Betti. However his death was not present in all versions of the film, leaving doubts on which ending is canon.

Polychrome brickwork is a style of architectural brickwork wherein bricks of different colours are used to create decorative patterns or highlight architectural features in the walls of a building. Historically it was used in the late Gothic period in Europe, and the Tudor period in England, and was revived in Britain in the 1850s as a feature of Gothic Revival architecture. Later in the 19th century and into the early 20th century it was adopted in various forms in Europe for all manner of buildings such as French eclectic villas, Dutch row houses, and German railway stations, and as far away as Melbourne, Australia, where the technique reached heights of popularity and elaboration in the 1880s. Beginnings in the British Gothic Revival  Porch of All Saints, Margaret Street, 1850-59, William Butterfield The revival of polychrome brickwork is generally thought to have been instigated by British critic and architectural theorist John Ruskin, in his 1849 book The Seven Lamps of Architecture, where he lauded not only Medieval and Gothic architecture as 'truer' than the Classical, but also the ‚Äòhonest‚Äô medieval use of materials as both structure and decoration, above the use of applied colours or veneered materials. He gave as examples Tuscan and Venetian Romanesque and Gothic buildings such as the Doge's Palace in Venice, which has a facade of white stone and pink marble in a diaper pattern (which is in fact a veneer). Other theorists and architects at the same time were also exploring the medieval use of materials in this way, later described as ‚Äòconstructional polychromy‚Äô. While some designers had already used more than one colour of brick, William Butterfield made lavish use of the technique in his All Saints Margaret Street, built between 1850-59, with an exterior of banded and diaper patterned brickwork in black and cream on a red brick background. Butterfield went on to use polychrome brick in more projects, and other architects also adopted the new technique. For example George Edmund Street used black bricks on a red background in his 1858‚Äì61 St James the Less in Pimlico, considered one of his finest designs, and George Gilbert Scott used black brick stripes on a red background on the Sandbach Literary Institution in 1857. The use of coloured brick effects became quite popular in Gothic Revival across the United Kingdom, often in combination with stone, usually with far less elaboration that Butterfield. Some architects in the 1870s-80s were more enthusiastic, such as in the work of Watson Fothergill in Nottingham, and in Bristol in the 1860s-80s it was often used is what is now known as 'Bristol Byzantine' style, for instance the 1869 Welsh Back Granary.  Use in Europe  Polychrome brickwork also became popular in Europe in the later 19th century as part of the various medieval and Romanesque revivals. In France the Menier Chocolate Factory in Noisiel, designed by Jules Saulnier and completed in 1872, is an early and very elaborate example, which is also noted for its early use of iron structure. Later the use of two tone brickwork was popular in eclectic picturesque villas, as well as other building types. Examples, again usually restrained use of two colours, can also be found in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany 'Gr√ºnderzeit' style buildings sometimes employed decorative brick. Use in Australasia St Michaels Church, Collins Street, 1866, the first example of elaborate polychrome brick in Australia In Australia, the first use of polychrome brickwork is generally attributed to architect Joseph Reed's Independent Church (now St Michaels) in Melbourne's Collins Street, completed in 1866, closely followed by St Jude's in Carlton. Architects such as Crouch & Wilson and Percy Oakden soon also employed it on church design, while Reed also applied it on houses, notably the Rippon Lea Estate. Most of the State Schools built in the 1870s-80s were in a brick Gothic style with at least two colours. Rare examples of its use can be found in Sydney and Brisbane, however it is most prevalent in Melbourne, where it began, and where it became increasingly popular, reaching a peak in the boom years of the 1880s when it was used extensively on all manner of buildings from terrace houses to villas, from shops to factories. Early New Zealand examples are All Saints' Church, Dunedin and Lisburn House Dunedin, New Zealand both designed by Mason and Wales architects.

Early life, education, and early career  Howard was born in Austin, Texas. She graduated from Reagan High School in Austin before moving on to the University of Texas at Austin, where she earned a B.A in Nursing in 1974 and an M.A. in Health Administration in 1977. Howard worked as a critical-care nurse at Brackenrige Hospital and Seton Hospital in Austin. While at Seton, she helped start the Good Health program and served as District 5 President of the Texas Nurse's Association. Howard also served on the University of Texas faculty as a Health Education instructor.  Political career  From 1996-1999, Howard served on the Eanes Independent School District school board. On February 14, 2006, Howard defeated Republican Ben Bentzin in a special election runoff to replace Todd Baxter. In the 2006 general election, Howard was again to face Bentzin, but Bentzin ultimately withdrew from the race, which Howard won by a wide margin. Howard retained her seat in 2008, defeating Republican Pamela Waggoner. In 2009, the Texas Association of Deans and Directors of Professional Nursing Programs honored Howard with its Champion for Nursing Education Award. In 2010, Howard narrowly defeated former Texas Longhorn and Denver Broncos player Dan Neil. On election day, the Secretary of State of Texas certified Howard as the winner by 16 votes. Following a recount requested by Neil, the Secretary of State found Howard to still be the winner, though by only 12 votes. Neil then requested that the election be investigated by the House of Representatives. After a four-day hearing headed up by Representative Will Hartnett, Howard was found to have won the election by 4 votes and Neil ultimately dropped the contest.The Secretary of State still reports an official margin of 12 votes. In 2011, Howard was the recipient of the 2011 Dr. Dorothy J.

March 1922 The Disconto-Gesellschaft (full name: Direktion der Disconto-Gesellschaft), with headquarters in Berlin, was founded in 1851. It was, until its 1929 merger into Deutsche Bank, one of the largest German banking organizations. History It was founded in 1851 as a ‚Äúcredit partnership,‚Äù and in 1856 was changed into a limited liability, joint-stock company under the name of ‚ÄúDirektion der Disconto-Gesellschaft,‚Äù with a capital of 30,000,000 marks. Its founder was David Hansemann, later Prussian Minister of Finance. Since 1857 also his son Adolph von Hansemann worked in the bank of his father. Its purpose and earliest activities were in the fostering of current account business and the underwriting of German state and local loans and railway shares. In 1890, a branch was opened in London, from which time dated the institution's activities in overseas matters. In 1901, on the liquidation of the house of M. A. Rothschild & Sons of Frankfurt am Main, a branch was established in that city, connection being made with the Rothschild Syndicate, with which it has since been largely identified. The interests formed with this group made the Disconto-Gesellschaft a prominent factor in the underwriting of many important national and railway loans, notably the state loans of Russia, Romania, China and Japan. In addition, in connection with other interests, it was instrumental in the financing of the Kamerun Railroad Company and the Great Venezuela Railway, both speculative enterprises, and the latter eventually of great financial annoyance. As a national factor, the Disconto-Gesellschaft lent its greatest support to industry through the promotion and financing of enterprises for the development of Germany's natural resources: the mining of coal and metals, smelting, iron and steel, potash, shipbuilding, electrical development, railways, fire and life insurance, etc. It assisted in the underwriting of the 10,000,000 thaler (30,000,000 marks) 5 per cent loan for the Krupp Works, in 1874 ‚Äî the first instance in Germany of the issue of fractional form bonds secured by blanket mortgage and providing for common representation of the holders of these bonds. Beginning in 1881, Disconto-Gesellschaft established or participated in the establishment of 15 important banking institutions, having 87 branches, scattered throughout Europe, Asia, South Pacific, South America and Africa; and through communities of interest, it had banking connections in Hamburg, Leipzig, Bremen, Mannheim and Geestmunde, these latter having 51 branches and numerous other agencies throughout the German Empire. In 1914 it absorbed the A. Schaaffhausen'scher Bankverein, this latter still retaining its name and clientele. Close relations were established with other important financial and industrial institutions, its directorate having (1908) representation on the boards of 92 corporations. The capital for the same year was 170,000,000 marks; surplus, 57,592,611 marks; and annual dividend, 8 per cent. The total capital power of the Disconto-Gesellschaft group amounted to 564,747,329 marks, of which 437,786,200 marks represented capital and 126,981,129 marks surplus.

It may relate to elements such as amplitude (volume), filters (frequencies) or pitch. For example, a piano key, when struck and held, creates a near- immediate initial sound which gradually decreases in volume to zero. Envelope generators, which allow users to control the different stages of a sound, are common features of synthesizers, samplers, and other electronic musical instruments. The most common form of envelope generator is controlled with four parameters: attack, decay, sustain and release (ADSR).  Development  The Hammond Novachord in 1938 used an early implementation of an ADSR envelope. A seven-position rotary knob set preset ADS parameter for all 72 notes; a pedal controls the release. The envelope generator was created by the American engineer Robert Moog in the 1960s. While experimenting with the first Moog synthesizers, composer Herbert Deutsch suggested Moog find a way to articulate the instrument so notes did not simply trigger on and off. Moog wired a doorbell button to the synthesizer and used a capacitor to store and slowly release voltage produced from hitting a key. He refined the design to remove the need to push a separate button with every keypress, with two switches on every key: one to produce the control voltage determining pitch and the other to trigger the envelope generator. The envelope generator became a standard feature of synthesizers. Following discussions with engineer and composer Vladimir Ussachevsky (then head of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center) in 1965, Moog developed a new envelope module whose functions were described in f T1 (attack time), T2 (initial decay time), ESUS (sustain level), and T3 (final decay time). These were later simplified to the modern ADSR form (Attack time, Decay time, Sustain level, Release time) by ARP.  ADSR  Schematic of ADSRThe most common kind of envelope generator has four stages: attack, decay, sustain, and release (ADSR). *Attack is the time taken for initial run-up of level from nil to peak, beginning when the key is pressed. *Decay is the time taken for the subsequent run down from the attack level to the designated sustain level. *Sustain is the level during the main sequence of the sound's duration, until the key is released. *Release is the time taken for the level to decay from the sustain level to zero after the key is released. While, attack, decay, and release refer to time, sustain refers to level.  Other envelopes  Some electronic musical instruments can invert the ADSR envelope, reversing the behavior of the normal ADSR envelope. During the attack phase, the modulated sound parameter fades from the maximum amplitude to zero then, during the decay phase, rises to the value specified by the sustain parameter. After the key has been released the sound parameter rises from sustain amplitude back to maximum amplitude. Some envelopes, such as that of the Korg MS-20, have an extra parameter, hold. This holds notes at the sustain level for a fixed length of time before decaying. The General Instruments AY-3-8912 sound chip includes only a hold time parameter; the sustain level is not programmable. Another common variation in the same vein is the AHDSR (attack, hold, decay, sustain, release) envelope, in which the \\"hold\\" parameter controls how long the envelope stays at full volume before entering the decay phase. Multiple attack, decay and release settings may be found on more sophisticated models. Certain synthesizers also allow for a delay parameter before the attack. Modern synthesizers, such as the Prophet '08, have DADSR (delay, attack, decay, sustain, release) envelopes. The delay setting determines the length of silence between hitting a note and the attack. Some software synthesizers, such as Image-Line's 3xOSC (included with their DAW FL Studio) have DAHDSR (delay, attack, hold, decay, sustain, release) envelopes. A common feature on many synthesizers is an AD envelope (attack and decay only). This can be used to control e.g. the pitch of one oscillator, which in turn may be synchronized with another oscillator by oscillator sync.

Views  Simon believes that the platform represents a fundamentally new business model‚Äîthe most important one of the 21st century. Specifically, APIs and SDKs are enabling developers to build mobile apps and web services faster and on a much greater scale than ever. The most successful companies of the day‚Äîe.g., Amazon.com, Apple Inc., Facebook, and Google‚Äîno longer focus on one line of business. Rather, they quickly and frequently add adjacent offerings, products, and services‚Äîi.e., planks. Through increasingly powerful ecosystems, companies today are externalizing a great deal of their innovation. What's more, they are evolving at increasingly rapid speeds. Emerging platforms such as Twitter, Kickstarter, Force.com, WordPress, Udemy, and scores of others are redefining business in tectonic ways that we have only begun to understand.

The character was created by Doug Moench, Bill Sienkiewicz, and Jim Shooter. Publication history Scarlet made her debut in December 1981 in Moon Knight #14. She appeared in Marc Spector: Moon Knight #26 (May 1991), Marc Spector: Moon Knight #30 (September 1991), All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #10 (October 2006), and Civil War Battle Damage Report #1 (March 2007). She also appeared in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #11 (January 2010). Fictional character biography Stained Glass Scarlet is an ex-nun who became a vigilante after being forced to kill her criminal son. Scarlet was trained in combat when she became a prison guard in a women's prison. Abused by her father, Scarlet had an unhappy childhood. One evening when she had had enough of it, she killed her father, by lighting his bed with a cigarette. His death was considered an accident and she was sent to live with her uncle and aunt, where her living conditions were improved. Later in life, she met and married Vince Fasinera, a small-time criminal, believing that she could save him from himself. She was wrong, and he simply mistreated her, much like her father had. Despite this, they had a child together, Joseph, though Vince wanted nothing to do with him. Vince later died, gunned down on the steps of a church, and their son turned to a life of crime himself. He was later called Joseph \\"Mad Dog\\" Fasinera. When he escaped prison, Scarlet took it upon herself to save her son from his life of crime, but in the end she was forced to kill him. Scarlet turned into a vigilante and started hunting down all the criminals who had ever had a hand to play in her son's turning to crime. Moon Knight tried to stop her, but ended up letting her escape.Moon Knight #14 (December 1981) =Scarlet Redemption= Scarlet returns and haunts the streets of Brooklyn armed with her crossbow. She finds Bertrand Crawley and, recognizing him as a friend of Marc Spector (or Jake Lockley), fires a crossbow bolt into his shoulder. Crawley runs off and falls through the glass front door of Gena's Diner. Scarlet follows after him, firing several more shots into the diner. She pitches Gena Landers through a window then fires a shot into the oven's gas lines, causing the entire building to explode. Scarlet returns to the church where she lives, confident that her \\"sweet angel\\" will come for her. That evening, Marc stands before the Statue of Khonshu. He suddenly sees an image of Scarlet flash before his eyes. He knows that Scarlet is destined to come back into his life. He soon learns about the incident at Gena's Diner. He visits Gena and Crawley in the hospital and promises Gena that he will rebuild the diner. When he leaves the hospital and goes to the Bronx Memorial Cemetery, a group of nuns, all answering to Scarlet, emerge from the shadows and attack him. Scarlet appears and fires a crossbow bolt that tears a hole through Moon Knight's mask. As quickly as she came, she disappears again.Marc Spector: Moon Knight #26 (May 1991) Scarlet later returned, having somehow formed a psychic link to Moon Knight. She was fighting inner demons, and began fire-bombing New York. Moon Knight caught up with her atop a bridge, but she jumped, and he was unable to find her in the waters below. At the time it was unknown whether she survived or not, but .Marc Spector: Moon Knight #30 (September 1991) =The Resurrection War= Scarlet aids the apparently-resurrected Moon Knight in fighting an alliance of some of his oldest foes: Raoul Bushman, Black Spectre and Morpheus, although her willingness to kill continues to put her at odds with Moon Knight. After preventing her from killing a defeated Black Spectre and before his final showdown with Bushman and Morpheus, Moon Knight urges her to flee the scene before the police arrive and she is last seen returning to her church, her escape aided by Ray and Ricky Landers: Gena's children and allies of Moon Knight. Moon Knight: Resurrection War (1998) =Civil War= In the aftermath of the superhero Civil War, Scarlet is among the names listed as a potential recruit for the 50-States Initiative in the appendix of Tony Stark's battle damage report. Civil War Battle Damage Report (2007) Powers and abilities While Scarlet does not have any apparent powers, she possesses a mysterious psychic bond with Moon Knight. This psychic bond is not systematic. It appears when Stained Glass Scarlet concentrates on Moon Knight, and can manifest in the form of dreams during which their thoughts intermingle and allow them to briefly communicate. This bond between Stained Glass Scarlet and Moon Knight could be due to an entity close to the Egyptian god of the moon, Khonshu, and reincarnated as Stained Glass Scarlet. Scarlet is an expert in martial arts. She is able to wield bayonets, guns, and crossbows with precision.

He has been portrayed by Robert Swenson in Batman & Robin, Tom Hardy in The Dark Knight Rises, and Shane West in Gotham. Henry Silva, Joaquim de Almeida, Ron Perlman, Clancy Brown, Michael Dorn, Danny Trejo, H√©ctor Elizondo, Carlos Alazraqui, Fred Tatasciore, Jason Liebrecht, Steve Blum, JB Blanc, Doug Benson, and James Adomian have all provided voice work for the character. Peter Marinker voices Bane in the radio adaption of Batman: Knightfall. Television =Live-action= Shane West as Bane in Gotham. * While Bane doesn't appear in the live-action series Arrow, his birthplace, Santa Prisca, is mentioned by John Diggle (David Ramsey) in \\"The Secret Origin of Felicity Smoak\\" when his wife Lyla Michaels (Audrey Marie Anderson) goes on an A.R.G.U.S. mission in that location. * In the second part of the fifth annual Arrowverse crossover event \\"Elseworlds\\", Bane's mask from The Dark Knight Rises (as well as other villains' belongings) can be seen inside the storage room at Arkham Asylum. * Bane appears in the fifth and final season of Gotham, portrayed by Shane West. This version of the character is Eduardo Dorrance, Jim Gordon's (Ben McKenzie) former army buddy, who leads the military group \\"Delta Force\\" seemingly to help Gordon and the GCPD in their war against Gotham City's criminal element after the city is rendered a \\"No Man's Land\\". In the past after Gordon's line of duty was over, Dorrance and his men became prisoners of war and were incarcerated at Pena Duro. He was later freed by Nyssa al Ghul (Jaime Murray), who enlists him to help in her plan to kill Bruce Wayne (David Mazouz) to avenge her father Ra's al Ghul (Alexander Siddig), and to destroy Gotham. When confronting Gordon at the ruins of Haven, Dorrance fights Gordon until he is impaled onto a pipe. Nyssa finds him and rehabilitates his body with armor and a respirator, with help from Hugo Strange (B.D. Wong). Reborn as Bane, he leads a mission to capture Gordon, Bruce, and Barbara Kean (Erin Richards). Bane later takes control of the military and battles the GCPD, who are joined by Oswald Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) and Edward Nygma (Cory Michael Smith). When Gordon and the others talk the military out of not following Bane's orders, Bane and Delta Force are arrested by the military. =Animation= DC Animated Universe Bane, as he is depicted in Batman: The Animated Series (left) and subsequent appearances (right). Even though the producers were reluctant to use the character as they felt his comic incarnation was too gimmicky, Bane still appeared in the DC Animated Universe, voiced primarily by Henry Silva. * Bane made his animated debut in Batman: The Animated Series, voiced by Henry Silva with a strong Latin American accent. This version is a former inmate of a Cuban prison containing the most dangerous convicts ever captured. While imprisoned, Bane was chosen as a test subject for the government project \\"Gilgamesh\\" to create super-soldiers with the drug Venom. Although the experiment was a success, Bane used his newfound superhuman abilities to escape and become a professional assassin. In his self-titled episode, Bane is hired by crime boss Rupert Thorne to kill the vigilante Batman. However, the Dark Knight ultimately defeats Bane by causing his Venom pump module to malfunction, by stabbing the switch with a batarang. * Bane returns in The New Batman Adventures, voiced again by Henry Silva but now with an American accent. His redesigned outfit is now completely black while his traditional luchador mask has been traded for a black gimp mask. In the episode \\"Over the Edge,\\" Batgirl's death at the Scarecrow's hands eventually leads to Commissioner James Gordon granting Bane an early release from Stonegate Penitentiarin exchange for assistance in the Dark Knight's apprehension. However, Bane betrays Gordon and prepares to both kill him and Batman. It is then revealed that the entire episode was merely Barbara Gordon's fear-induced nightmare caused by the Scarecrow's toxin. * Bane later appears in Superman: The Animated Series, with Henry Silva reprising the role. During Batman's mysterious disappearance in the episode \\"Knight Time\\", Bane conspires with the Riddler and the Mad Hatter to take over Gotham during the Dark Knight's absence. The three are intercepted by Superman and Robin, the former disguised as Batman. Using a stronger version of his venom drug, Bane engages Superman in a fistfight and manages to land a few blows, but Superman ultimately pummels Bane into submission, knocking him out and pulling the tube out of his head. * Bane appears as one of the antagonists in the 2003 direct- to-video animated movie Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman, now voiced by H√©ctor Elizondo. He is hired by the Penguin and Rupert Thorne to provide security for an arms deal with the Kaznian military, as their former \\"muscle\\" Carlton Duquesne has been unable to do so ever since the Batwoman's emergence. After capturing Batwoman aboard Penguin's yacht, Bane reveals to his employers that the vigilante's apparent secret identity is Carlton's daughter's Kathy. When Batman frees Kathy, Bane uses Carlton as a hostage to lure the pair to him. While Kathy rescues Carlton, Bane fights Batman aboard the burning yacht where the villain severely injures the Dark Knight after a long and brutal battle. However, the Caped Crusader manages to cut Bane's Venom supply with Rocky Ballantine's advanced alloy, and Bane then falls into a pit of fire to his presumed death (although Batman Beyond makes it clear that he survived). * Bane makes a cameo appearance in Batman Beyond. In the episode \\"The Winning Edge\\" it is revealed that despite of Bruce Wayne's retirement from his role as Batman, he has been keeping track of Bane's whereabouts for twenty years after their final confrontation. His Venom formula is delivered in patch form as an influx called 'slappers' and distributed on the future version of Gotham's streets and even given to teenagers. The new Batman learns that a lifetime of Venom abuse has taken its toll on Bane and that he is now a frail, comatose old man reliant on an oxygen tank and the support of a medical caretaker Jackson Chappell who is revealed to be the one supplying the Venom \\"slappers\\". Other series * After the release of The Dark Knight Rises, Bane was parodied in Comedy Central's sitcom South Park in the episode \\"Insecurity\\" where several of the characters disguise themselves (such as Eric Cartman and Randy Marsh) as Bane to mob the UPS man. The mask itself was altered before the episode premiered. * Bane appears in The Batman animated series, voiced by Joaquim de Almeida (in \\"Traction\\"), Ron Perlman (in \\"Team Penguin\\"), and Clancy Brown (in \\"The Batman/Superman Story (Part 1)\\"). Debuting in the episode \\"Traction\\", this version is depicted as a cunning South American mercenary who wears a bodysuit who can transform into a hulking monster with red skin when he pumps the yellow drug, Venom, into his system. After fighting Batman, the dark knight develops mechanical armor to defeat him. In \\"Team Penguin\\", Bane is seen robbing a bank before being defeated by Batman, Robin, and Batgirl. In \\"Rumors\\", he is seen as one of the many villains captured by the eponymous vigilante. In \\"The Batman/Superman Story (Part 1)\\", Bane, Black Mask, Mr. Freeze, and Clayface are hired by Lex Luthor to kidnap Lois Lane to lure out Superman. * Bane appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Michael Dorn. This version is extremely frail before injecting himself with Venom. He is featured in the episode \\"Menace of the Conqueror Caveman\\", where he fights Batman and Wildcat. Bane also appears \\"Sidekicks Assemble!\\" and \\"Night of the Batmen!\\". * Bane appears in Young Justice, voiced by Danny Trejo. In the episode \\"Drop Zone\\", Bane is engaged in a war against the cult Kobra over the production of his drug, Venom, on the island of Santa Prisca. In \\"Usual Suspects\\", Bane allows Lex Luthor and Queen Bee to use Santa Prisca as a meeting venue for The Light's agents. In the third season, it is revealed that Bane broke his addiction to Venom, and allied himself with Deathstroke, Lady Shiva, and the League of Shadows to run a metahuman trafficking ring on Santa Prisca. * In the Justice League Action episode, \\"System Failure\\", a robotic duplicate of Bane was seen assisting robotic duplicates of several other villains in taking down Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg, and Booster Gold. * Bane is a recurring character in Harley Quinn, voiced by James Adomian. While his appearance is based on the comics, his voice is a direct parody of Tom Hardy's portrayal in The Dark Knight Rises. Moreover, he is depicted as more dimwitted compared to other incarnations and obsessed with blowing up anyone or anything that antagonizes him for any reason, such as a juice bar clerk who got his name wrong on his orders. Like some of the other characters, he uses profanity when he's enraged or annoyed. He makes scattered minor appearances throughout the series, usually alongside other villains and members of the Legion of Doom. In season two, following the Legion of Doom and Gotham's destruction, Bane became a member of the Injustice League alongside Riddler, Penguin, Two-Face, and Mr. Freeze to take advantage of the chaos and divide what's left of Gotham between them. Despite being a member however, the others often treat Bane like a flunky. In \\"Batman's Back Man\\", he and Two-Face try to consolidate their power after Harley takes out most of the Injustice League, though the latter attempts to ensure only he succeeds. When Bane learns of this and nearly kills him, Two-Face gives him a pit in a desert to appease him. In the episode, \\"There's No Place to Go But Down\\", Bane converted the pit into a rehabilitation center and became its warden. When Harley and Ivy were transferred to his custody, they caused a riot in order to escape. Bane pursued the two only to fall to his apparent death. In \\"Lovers' Quarrel\\" however, Bane is shown to have survived, albeit stranded in the Pit. In \\"The Runaway Bridesmaid\\", Bane escaped from the Pit and attended Ivy and Kite Man's wedding before taking part in a fight between the other attending supervillains and the GCPD. Film =Live-action= Batman & Robin (1997) Robert Swenson as Bane in Batman & Robin (1997). A different version of Bane appears in Batman & Robin (1997), portrayed by former WCW wrestler Robert \\"Jeep\\" Swenson in one of his last film roles before his death. Antonio Diego (portrayed by Michael Reid MacKay) is an incarcerated serial killer who is transformed into \\"Bane\\" with an experimental drug called \\"Venom\\" by mad scientist Dr. Jason Woodrue (John Glover). In this interpretation, Bane is an inarticulate thug who serves as the bodyguard/henchman of Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) and is barely capable of speech, communicating mostly with growls and roars. Bane is defeated when Robin (Chris O'Donnell) and Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone) disconnect the Venom tube in the back of his head, which changes him back to his frail self. This character was one of many aspects of the film which received criticism from fans and critics alike. The Dark Knight Rises (2012) Tom Hardy's portrayal in The Dark Knight Rises (2012) depicts Bane as intelligent and resourceful. The mask he wears provides him with a drug that dulls the pain caused by injuries he suffered in prison. Bane appears in The Dark Knight Rises, portrayed by Tom Hardy, serving as the film's main antagonist (alongside Talia al Ghul). Intending to portray the character as \\"more menacing\\" than the Batman & Robin incarnation, Hardy gained of muscle for the role, increasing his weight to . Prior to the film's release, Bane's voice received some criticism for being unintelligible due to his mask. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, Christopher Nolan said \\"I think when people see the film, things will come into focus. Bane is very complex and very interesting and when people see the finished film people will be very entertained by him.\\" \\"We wanted a very physical monster. We wanted more of the Darth Vader, if you like, and that was very important in the story dynamics.\\" Hardy himself also commented on the voice in another interview with Entertainment Weekly, saying \\"It‚Äôs a risk, because we could be laughed at‚Äîor it could be very fresh and exciting,\\" and that \\"The audience mustn‚Äôt be too concerned about the mumbly voice... As the film progresses, I think you‚Äôll be able to tune to its setting.\\" Hardy says the voice he developed had several influences, including Bane's intellect, Caribbean heritage, and in particular, bare-knuckle fighter Bartley Gorman. Bane has been described as having \\"the physicality of a silverback gorilla\\"https://www.empireonline.com/features/bane-dark-knight-rises-costume and is shown to have superhuman levels of strength in certain instances throughout the film, such as punching holes in limestone pillars, ripping his wrists out of handcuffs, easily breaking a soldier's neck with one hand, lifting Batman's armored body by the throat with a single outstretched arm, and cracking his impact-resistant cowl. Hardy describes Bane's fighting style as \\"Brutal. He's a big dude who's incredibly clinical, in the fact that he has a result-based and oriented fighting style. It's not about fighting. It's about carnage. The style is heavy-handed, heavy-footed, it's nasty. Anything from small-joint manipulation to crushing skulls, crushing rib cages, stamping on shins and knees and necks.\\" Bane is the self-proclaimed leader of a revolution against the rich and the corrupt, who he contends are oppressing \\"the people\\", and keeping them subservient with \\"myths of opportunity\\". Political theorist and cultural critic Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek sees Bane as fighting \\"structural injustice\\", while likening him to a modern-day Che Guevara who is counter-intuitively driven to violence out of a sense of love.Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek: The Politics of Batman by Slavoj Zizek, New Statesman, August 23, 2012 Others have compared Bane to a \\"high-tech Robespierre on steroids\\", a melded triad of Lenin, bin Laden and Steve Austin set on fomenting \\"proletarian retribution\\", and \\"the one thing that's worse than the second film's raving anarchist: a demagogue.\\"The Specter of Revolution in \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" by Alex Sayf Cummings and Ryan Reft, Tropics of Meta, July 23, 2012 For his part, Nolan has said that his draft for the script was inspired by Charles Dickens' 1859 classic novel A Tale of Two Cities, centered around the French Revolution.One Thing You Didn't Notice About Bane In \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" by Bill Bradley, The Huffington Post, April 11, 2015 This homage to Dickens' story is briefly illustrated by having Bane inconspicuously finger knit paracord (incidentally a real-life habit of Hardy's) in one scene of the film, symbolizing his Reign of Terror-based character Madame Defarge from the book. While little information is given about Bane's backstory, he is said to have been born and raised in a centuries-old foreign penitentiary known as \\"the Pit\\",The Dark Knight Rises (2012): Quotes.

Although the viewer is led to believe he had escaped the prison as a child, it is later revealed that he was the friend of Talia al Ghul (Joey King), a young girl whose mother, the daughter of a local warlord, gave birth to in the Pit after being banished there by her father. After the mother was killed by the prison's inmates, Bane protected the girl until the latter finally escaped.McWeeny, Drew (2012-08-27). \\"Our second look at 'The Dark Knight Rises' digs into the bad and the ugly\\". Hitfix. Retrieved 2012-12-19. \\"The Joker tells constant lies about himself and his backstory, and Nolan tells one big lie about the origin of Bane. That lie is designed to hide the film's biggest reveal, and we do eventually learn the truth about Bane. It seems fitting that in the one flashback where Nolan tells the full truth about Bane's identity, we finally catch that single glimpse of Tom Hardy's face.\\" However, Bane was attacked by the other inmates, which left him in \\"perpetual agony\\" as a result of his injuries and the prison doctor's inept attempts to treat them; in lieu of his addiction to Venom in the comics, he instead wears a mask that provides him with a constant stream of analgesic gas that keeps his pain just below the threshold.The Dark Knight Rises Quotes (Page 3) \\"Many years ago, it was a time of plague. Some of the other prisoners attacked Bane and the doctor's fumbling attempts to repair the damage left him in perpetual agony. The mask holds the pain at bay.\\" Bane was then rescued and recruited by Talia's father, Ra's al Ghul (Liam Neeson), into the League of Shadows, though Ra's eventually excommunicated him for being a reminder of the prison that Talia's mother was left to die in. After Ra's' death during the events of Batman Begins, however, Bane rejoined the League as its new leader alongside Talia. Six months before the main plot begins, Bane poses as one of his own mercenaries to infiltrate a meeting between a CIA agent named Bill Wilson (Aiden Gillen) and nuclear physicist Dr. Leonid Pavel (Alon Abutbul). After he and his men destroy CIA's plane, Bane kidnaps Dr. Pavel and forces him to convert a stolen Wayne Enterprises fusion reactor into an atomic bomb, which Bane intends to use to destroy Gotham City. In the present day narrative, Bane sets up his base in the city's tunnels, where he captures Gotham Police Commissioner James Gordon (Gary Oldman), who escapes shortly afterwards. Masquerading as an enforcer of John Daggett (Ben Mendelsohn), Bane bankrupts Dagget's business rival Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) by orchestrating a raid at the Gotham Stock Exchange and using Wayne's fingerprints to verify fraudulent futures exchange trades. After killing Daggett, Bane forces cat- burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) to lure Batman to his lair. Bane subsequently breaks Batman's back and condemns him to the Pit where he reveals his plan: to fulfill Ra's al Ghul's destiny, he will psychologically torture Batman and Gotham for several months before detonating the bomb, destroying the city in an atomic blast. To this effect, Bane lures Gotham's police underground and uses explosives to trap them and destroy the bridges surrounding the city. Bane then kills Mayor Anthony Garcia (Nestor Carbonell) by detonating his viewing box and then kills Dr. Pavel in front of the football spectators before reading Gordon's resignation speech to the public. Bane then exposing the crimes of district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and their subsequent cover-up. Broadcasting that he wants to liberate Gotham from the corrupt and wealthy elite after reading the information, Bane releases the prisoners of Blackgate Prison, initiating anarchy while holding the city hostage and isolated with the bomb. Months later, Bane discovers that Batman has escaped from the Pit, returned to Gotham, and freed the trapped GCPD from the sewers. The police then clash with Bane's army in the streets outside the Gotham City Hall. Batman battles Bane in the midst of the chaos and damages his mask, cutting off his supply of painkillers and rendering him helpless. Talia ‚Äî who was masquerading as Wayne Enterprises CEO Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) ‚Äî intervenes by stabbing Batman. She fixes Bane's mask and activates the detonator, but Gordon blocks her signal. Talia leaves to detonate the bomb while Bane prepares to execute Batman, but Selina appears and fires the Batpod's cannons at Bane, killing him. =Animation= * Bane appears in the animated movie Superman/Batman: Public Enemies but has no dialogue and merely grunts. Along with several supervillains, Bane tried to collect the billion-dollar bounty on Superman. He briefly fights Batman but was defeated when Batman used his batarang to cut his Venom tube and knock him out with a single kick. * Bane appears in Justice League: Doom, voiced by Carlos Alazraqui. He is the first member of the Legion of Doom to be introduced, trekking through Slaughter Swamp to the Hall of Doom before being attacked by a giant alligator. He is dragged underwater, but manages to free himself and break the beast's neck. He meets Cheetah, Star Sapphire, Metallo and Ma'alefa'ak J'onzz/Ma'alefa'ak on his way to The Hall of Doom before they are invited in. Bane is chosen by Vandal Savage to kill Batman. He does so by stealing Batman's parents' graves and informing Bruce Wayne as Batman of their disappearance, disguising himself as a worker at the graveyard. He then knocks out Batman before putting Wayne in one of his parents' coffins and burying his nemesis alive but Batman manages to dig himself out and is the first League member to escape his death trap and manages to save his fellow League members. Bane stays with Savage after Vandal revealed his true plans and faces off against Batman when the Justice League storms the Hall of Doom. Despite overpowering Batman early on, the Dark Knight manages to defeat Bane by cutting his Venom tube. * Bane appears in Lego Batman: The Movie - DC Super Heroes Unite, an adaptation of the video game of the same name, with Steve Blum reprising his role. * Bane appears in Batman: Assault on Arkham. At the end of the film, the Joker releases Bane and several other inmates from Arkham Asylum to distract Batman while he sets off a bomb that could destroy half of Gotham. During the riot, Bane attacks Killer Frost while trying to escape from Arkham by throwing the police car Killer Frost was trying to escape in, causing it to explode. Later, Bane is attempts to escape Arkham Island via the Gotham bridge, where he prepares to attack Commissioner Gordon. However, Batman defeats Bane by cutting his venom supply and causing him to fall into Gotham river. * While Bane doesn't appear in Justice League vs. Teen Titans, he is briefly mentioned when Batman injects himself with a nerve toxin to prevent Trigon from possessing him, as the toxin was meant for Bane. * Bane is featured in Batman Unlimited: Mechs vs. Mutants voiced again by Carlos Alazraqui. He is one of the convicts freed from Arkham Asylum by the Penguin and Mr. Freeze, and his Venom-infused blood is used to create Freeze's growth concoction. He later injects himself with the substance and grows to enormous size, which allows him to fight his nemesis Killer Croc. He is later defeated by Batman and shrunk back to normal size. * Bane appears in Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League: Gotham City Breakout voiced by Eric Bauza. He takes over a kingdom of humanoids known as the Trogowogs with help from Deathstroke, but is defeated by Batman, Batgirl, and Nightwing. * Bane appears in The Lego Batman Movie voiced by Doug Benson. His appearance is a hybrid of the comic version and Tom Hardy's portrayal in The Dark Knight Rises with his voice bing that. * A Feudal Japan sumo wrestler version of Bane appears in Batman Ninja, is voiced by Kenta Miyake. * Bane appears in Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, voiced again by Carlos Alazraqui.

He is later overwhelmed and eaten alive by a swarm of them. Video games =Lego Batman= * Bane appears in Lego Batman: The Videogame, with vocal effects by Fred Tatasciore. He is an enemy of Batman and a follower of the Penguin. He is the only one of the Penguin's followers that's not based on a type of animal, and the one story villain that doesn't serve as a boss.Game Informer features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph. See \\"LEGO Batman: Character Gallery\\", Game Informer 186 (October 2008): 93. Ben of Game Informer writes that \\"this game is filled with cool playable characters... Nightwing, Joker, Killer Croc, Bane, Catwoman, and Man-Bat only scratch the surface of the game's catalog of great characters.\\"Ben, \\"LEGO Batman: Time to build something new\\", Game Informer 187 (November 2008): 116. He is a playable character and has super strength, toxic immunity, and a special \\"back breaker\\" move. The Penguin assigns him to go to the docks and steal a satellite dish needed to control the former's penguin bombs. In the ending, he is seen in Arkham Asylum trying to break down his cell but knocks himself down in the process. When seeing this for the first time, people wondered how he ended up in Arkham Asylum, but in the villain story, it's revealed that after he helped the Penguin get the satellite dish, he gets cornered by Commissioner Gordon and his police force and the Penguin takes off in his sub without him. Enraged, Bane smashes things up and threatens the police by throwing a police car, but it ends up conking him on the head and knocking him out. The police tries to lift him into the police car, but he turns out to be too heavy (probably because of the Venom). The police end up using a police car as a tow-truck and pull him away. He is 1 of 2 villains whose final capture is in the villain story, the other being Scarecrow. Catwoman can also be seen captured in the villain story, but she later gets rescued. The player can gain an achievement on the Xbox 360 version of the game if the player, as Bane, uses the back breaker move on Batman, the player's human- or computer-controlled partner (a reference to the Knightfall story arc). * Bane appears in Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes, voiced by Steve Blum. In the level \\"Arkham Asylum Antics,\\" he drives his Mole Machine around the maze with Poison Ivy and Penguin riding with him. Bane appears on Gotham Beach as an optional boss. His opening catchphrase is \\"Whatever you build, I will break.\\" * Bane appears as a playable character in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, voiced by JB Blanc. In the game, he is manually able to change from a normal-sized mini-figure to a Venom-powered big-figure. However, Bane is unplayable in story mode and has no part in the story. His The Dark Knight Rises version is also playable via DLC. * Bane is a playable character in Lego Dimensions with Steve Blum reprising his role once more. Bane also appears stealing kryptonite to defeat Superman. Batman and Robin give chase, but a dimensional vortex sucks in Robin (who obtained the Kryptonite that Bane stole), who Batman goes after. Bane also makes a cameo as one of the villains working for Lord Vortech and is one of the final bosses. * Bane appears as a playable character in Lego DC Super-Villains, voiced again by JB Blanc. =Batman: Arkham= Bane appears in the Batman: Arkham series, where he is voiced by Fred Tatasciore in Arkham Asylum & Arkham City, and by JB Blanc in Arkham Origins. * In Batman: Arkham Asylum, the first game of the Arkham series, Batman seems horrified to find that Bane is being used as a human test subject in the Asylum's Medical Facility by Dr. Penelope Young, called ‚ÄúBruja‚Äù (meaning ‚ÄúWitch‚Äù in Spanish) by Bane, and that the Venom has been drained from his system leaving him weak and emaciated. After Batman rescues a captive Commissioner Gordon and advises Gordon to get away as quickly as he can, the Joker appears on a security monitor and remotely pumps the Venom into Bane's body while promising that Dr. Young will be eliminated by someone else. Enraged, Bane attacks Batman, but is defeated after Batman tears the Venom pumps from Bane's body. He is seemingly crushed by the collapsing roof, but almost immediately charges out from the rubble in a frenzy, grabbing Batman and threatening to \\"break him\\" once more. Before he has the chance, Batman remotely calls the Batmobile to his location, which strikes Bane and sends both he and the car into the adjoining river. In one of the possible post- credits sequences after completion, a floating tank of Titan formula in the river sees Bane's hand quickly rise from the water and grab it. Bane's character biography is unlocked by examining his teddy bear located in a room before the player enters the chamber where Bane is being held in order to rescue Gordon from Harley Quinn. Bane's attack allows Harley to evade capture for the time being. His presence is explained with the discovery that Dr. Young was using Venom to develop the Titan formula (an enhanced version of Venom that triggers a Bane-like transformation without the need for the tank that Bane requires for the same purpose) when she worked for \\"Jack White\\" (one of Joker's aliases). * In Batman: Arkham City, roughly a year after the events of the first game inside the walled off prison in Gotham known as Arkham City, Bane forges a fragile alliance with Batman to destroy the remnants of canisters of Dr. Young's Titan formula that are stored in different areas of the prison. The two initially work together in fighting off Hugo Strange's private Tyger security force (or the Joker's thugs if the side mission is attempted after completing the main story), but Bane reveals shortly thereafter that he was only using Batman as a tool to gather as much of the Titan formula as possible for his own use. Predicting this, Batman traps Bane in a defunct elevator so he can destroy the gathered Titan tanks without interference and is left locked there for the duration of the game's campaign. * In Batman: Arkham Origins, the prequel game taking place eight years before the events of Arkham Asylum, Bane's character design resembles something of a composite between his traditional appearances in the comics and the more militaristic and \\"revolutionary\\" garb he wore in The Dark Knight Rises. Unlike the first two entries in the series, the story of Arkham Origins showcases more of Bane's character staples from the comics, particularly his intelligence, as well as his addiction to the Venom formula. His role in Origins is also comparatively larger than it is in any other Arkham game, and he is the game's final boss. While no details are given in regards to the exact details of his origin, Batman at first seems surprised that Bane has turned up in Gotham in the first place, implying that the character was already well-established in criminal circles by the time Origins takes place, which is during Batman's second year as a crimefighter. First appearing in the story as one of the eight assassins hired to kill Batman by Black Mask. he is present at the meeting in the Gotham Royal Hotel between Electrocutioner and Firefly with Black Mask, who quickly reveals himself to be a new criminal: the Joker. After Joker kills Electrocutioner, Bane chooses to remain behind in the hotel after the meeting in anticipation of his first confrontation with Batman. With Batman besting him in their first encounter, Bane flees. Batman incapacitates Joker and leaves him for the police before tracking Bane to his hideout with a tracer, finding evidence of a new strain of Venom called TN-1, which would provide a permanent effect and lack the addictive properties of the original version. While in his hideout, Batman also discovers that Bane has deduced that Bruce Wayne and Batman are actually the same person. Batman destroys this evidence, but is delayed in returning to the Batcave when Firefly attempts to destroy Gotham Pioneer's Bridge. This gives Bane time to invade the cave, destroy Batman's equipment, and attack Alfred Pennyworth leaving him for dead. Bane is next seen with the Joker during his riot at Blackgate Penitentiary, facing off against Batman a second time. Batman is told that if he does not kill Bane, the beating of his heart will power an electric chair that will kill both Joker and Gotham City Police Captain James Gordon. Though Batman uses the Electrocutioner's gloves to stop Bane's heart, he quickly revives him once the heart monitor is removed. In retaliation, Bane injects himself with an imperfect Titan prototype, turning him into the same kind of hulking monster Batman will go onto face in the future. Batman electrocutes Bane again to defeat him, and the brain damage he suffers due to his abuse of the Titan formula robs him of the knowledge of Batman's identity. He's then apprehended by the Gotham PD. Bane is playable in the Batman: Arkham Origins multiplayer. If a player controlling a Bane Elite gets to the entrance door first, the Elite is replaced with Bane. Bane is equipped with a powerful rocket launcher, and is capable of performing devastating melee attacks, including a shock wave that knocks down enemies, and instant kills that vary based on the enemy's position (thrown across the room if standing, picked up and slammed down if prone, and slammed into a wall if near one). If Bane initiates an instant kill on Batman or Robin, he performs his signature backbreaker. * Bane appears in a limited capacity at the end of the handheld game Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate. Taking place three months after the events of Arkham Origins, Bane has been incarcerated in the eponymous prison for that entire time. Because of the ravages the Titan formula made on his body, Bane grew substantially weaker, making his body look emaciated and pale. After Batman manages to defeat Joker, Penguin and Black Mask inside Blackgate Prison, he proceeds to the recently established \\"Arkham Wing\\" where he finds Bane sealed in a container. Marking her first chronological appearance in the timeline of the series, Catwoman reveals to Batman that she was hired to break Bane out of prison. After a failed attempt to divert Batman away from she and Bane, Batman finally catches up to Catwoman and defeats her. At the same time, a SWAT team led by Captain Rick Flag arrives and detains Catwoman. Batman intends to go after Bane next, but Flag stops him, saying that they had already captured him before he could escape. Later, it is revealed that Amanda Waller was the one who hired Catwoman to break Bane out. * Though Bane doesn't appear in Batman: Arkham Knight, his teddy bear and Titan canister appear in the Gotham City Police Department's archived evidence room, along with artifacts from criminals appearing in prior games like Anarky, Black Mask, Mr. Freeze, Ra's al Ghul, and Joker. GCPD officer Aaron Cash said that Bane had to be released from custody after the shutdown of Arkham City, and that he was suffering from severe Titan withdrawal at the time of his release. While exploring the city, Batman can discover some of his belongings in a shipping container, which reveals that he has returned to Santa Prisca and launched a campaign against the drug lords who run the island. =Injustice= * Fred Tatasciore reprises his role as Bane in Injustice: Gods Among Us. His \\"Prime\\" universe incarnation is first seen with Lex Luthor, Catwoman and Solomon Grundy fighting Nightwing, Cyborg and Raven aboard the Watchtower until he is defeated by Batman. Later on, his One-Earth dimension incarnation is seen as one of the Regime forces in the assault on the Insurgency headquarters that fights Wonder Woman until the latter is teleported to Themyscira by Ares and is later knocked out by the \\"Prime\\" Batman and Insurgency Batman. In the tie- in comics, it is revealed that Bane was the first super-villain Superman recruited into the Regime. In Bane's single-player ending after defeating the High Counciler Superman, Bane recruits Sinestro and Black Adam to assume control over Earth alongside him. However, this ruling triad would only continue until the next phase of Bane's plan. * Bane returns as a playable fighter in Injustice 2, voiced again by Fred Tatasciore. He joined the Society after the Regime's fall and battles Green Arrow, Black Canary, Green Lantern, Catwoman and Cyborg in the story. He is suspicious of Catwoman whom he suspects to be a mole in The Society though his attempts to warn Gorilla Grodd go unheeded. He considers Cyborg to be his old comrade from their time in the Regime, though Victor admits he never agreed with Superman's choice to recruit criminals like Bane. Bane then notes the irony that Cyborg is now considered criminal along with Bane now that the Regime has fallen, before stating that Cyborg must ask himself what is the difference between them now. In his single-player ending after defeating Brainiac, Bane takes advantage of his newfound reputation as Earth's savior and releases a number of prisoners to overthrow the government after Brainiac's defeat, but quickly grows bored when he realizes there is no one left to fight. =Other games= * Bane is a boss character in the Batman & Robin video game adaptation (1997), and Batman: Chaos in Gotham (2001). * H√©ctor Elizondo reprised his role as Bane in Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu. * Bane appears as a first boss in London in the DS version of Batman: The Brave and the Bold ‚Äì The Videogame. * Bane is featured in DC Universe Online, voiced by E. Jason Liebrecht. He has been supplying a new type of Venom throughout Gotham City with his hideout being the Cape Carmine Lighthouse. If the player takes the hero campaign, he/she will be assisted by Nightwing. If the player takes the villain campaign, he/she will be assisted by Killer Croc. Bane's henchmen consist of Hoppers, Juicers, Lieutenants, Muscles, Razors, Retaliators, Splints, Street Soldiers, Strongmen, Venomized Dogs, Envenomed Hoppers, Envenomed Guard Dogs, Envenomed Juicers, Envenomed Lieutenants, Envenomed Retaliators, Envenomed Street Soldiers, Envenomed Strongmen, and Venom Supplier Diego. In the Last Laugh DLC pack, Hero players may encounter Bane once again in the Shady Nightclub duo, an instance that generates three random Villains (others being the Ultra Humanite, Killer Croc, Killer Frost or Parasite). In this instance, his voice acting receives a little addition: he speaks in Spanish when the players attack him, saying \\"Madre de Dios\\" (mother of God) and \\"Basta!\\" (enough!). Bane can also be unlocked to use in Player Versus Player Legends matches, using a strong Brawling fight style. If a player using Bane defeats an enemy player using Batman, the player will get a feat called Breaking the Bat. * Bane appears as a boss for Young Justice: Legacy, voiced by Eric Lopez. During the Team's mission in Santa Prisca, he aids Lex Luthor and Black Manta in containing a piece of an ancient statue. Bane confronts the Team, taunting Aqualad about his mentor's possible death before fighting him. * Bane makes several appearances in the iPad and iPhone game app released to coincide with The Dark Knight Rises. In this version, Bane has a shaved head instead of being completely bald and wields a shoulder-holstered handgun. Bane confronts Batman in the armory instead of the sewers, and beats him nearly to death, but does not break his back. Bane and his mercenaries attack civilians and set bombs on buildings on Bane's orders. * In Batman, Bane breaks out of Arkham Asylum, and begins taking control of Gotham. Batman thwarts this, and Bane, in a last stand, attacks Batman with a helicopter. Batman destroys the helicopter by ramming it with the Batmobile, taking Bane into custody. In his cell in Arkham, Bane swears vengeance on Batman. * Bane appears in the second season of Telltale's Batman series, Batman: The Enemy Within, with JB Blanc once again voicing the character after Batman: Arkham Origins. This version of the character has tattoos, facial hair and initially didn't use the tube system. Instead, Venom was inserted into his body through injections from his syringe gun which he uses on himself from time to time. Bane is a member of the Pact alongside Riddler, \\"John Doe,\\" Harley Quinn, and Mr. Freeze. Bane joined the group to gain access to the LOTUS virus to cure his addiction to Venom and being convinced by Riddler, who was his closest friend. He is the second member of the group encountered by Batman and nearly kills the vigilante during an assault on the GCPD's weapons storage. When Bruce Wayne joins the group, Bane remains cautious of him and his motives, eventually deducing he is an Agency mole. In one of the earlier missions with the Pact should Bruce interact with Amanda Waller, he will be given a fake Venom formula to slip on Bane. He is later captured during an assault on the SANCTUS lab, being knocked out by either the Agency operatives or Batman. If the Joker becomes a vigilante, Bane, now with a new version of Venom and tube system to take the steroid, is deployed by the Agency to subdue him and Batman, believing the new vigilante to be responsible for Riddler's death. Bane is also part of Waller's group of supervillains that engage Batman and Joker on the rooftops of the GCPD. After Batman saves Waller from the Joker, he can negotiate for Bane's release so he can stand trial.

He was the first serial killer to be captured in Mexico, although he was not the country's first recorded serial killer. Guerrero killed approximately twenty female prostitutes in Mexico City between 1880 and 1888. He also killed one woman whose status as a prostitute has been inconsistently reported. Guerrero and Jack the Ripper were contemporaries and their modus operandi were similar‚Äîsome authors compare the two men. He was also known as \\"El Chalequero\\", \\"The Mexican Bluebeard\\", \\"The Consulado River Strangler\\", \\"The Consulado River Ripper\\", or \\"The Mexican Ripper\\". He was an organized, sedentary, and missionary killer who was motivated by hatred. Early life Francisco Guerrero P√©rez was born in 1840 in the Baj√≠o region of Mexico to an impoverished family. He was an eleventh child whose childhood was marked by poverty, maternal abuse and paternal absence. In 1862, the twenty-two-year-old migrated to Mexico City, where he worked for a shoemaker. Guerrero dressed extravagantly but elegantly, with cashmere pants, a charro vest and a charro jacket. He was described by an anonymous source as a \\"...handsome, elegant, flirtatious and quarrelsome man\\". There are two theories on the origin of the nickname \\"Chalequero\\". One says that it was simply because he always used vests, and the other postulates it was because the name \\"Chalequero\\" alludes to the Spanish expression \\"... a puro chaleco\\". This expression means that he made a sexual victim of any woman that he felt attracted to, whether they liked him or not. Psychiatric profile Francisco Guerrero\`s picture in 1888 Guerrero was psychopathic; he did not feel empathy or guilt and he had a parasitic lifestyle. He saw other persons as objects, had inflated self-esteem, suffered sudden anger attacks, was manipulative and promiscuous. However, he was charismatic. In the prison, he was described by the other prisoners as: \\"a silent and quiet person, he cares about his appearance\\". On one occasion, he wrote a letter to the prison director asking permission for his family to bring him a new pair of pants so that he could, in his words, \\"dress according to his education\\". He saw the female sex as nothing more than a disposable conduit to sexual gratification. His crimes involved hate, showed extreme cruelty and were marked by perversions such as sexual mutilation. He violated his victims to show the superiority and power that, according to him, he held over the women. Almost all of his victims were prostitutes, but he did not kill them because of their work; he killed them because they were vulnerable. According to him, \\"...women had a duty to be faithful to their men, and female adultery should be punished with the death penalty.\\" Carlos Roumagnac, one of the first Mexican criminologists, concluded that Consulado River's Ripper was a born criminal:  References in pop culture  His crimes have since been dramatized in Bernardo Esquinca's novel Carne de Ataud.

Plot summary  While on vacation, Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson walk by the sea. Hoping to ask for directions back to their inn, they call upon a house but discover three dead people seated at a table and with no signs of violence. Initially, the victims' brother Tregennis is suspected, but when he is killed in a similar way, then the explorer Dr. Sterndale becomes a suspect. Sterndale shows Holmes and Watson a note where Tregennis confesses to the murder of his siblings to acquire their property.

History  The Rite of Braga belongs to the Roman family of liturgical rites and took shape within the Archdiocese of Braga between the 11th and 13th centuries. The Missal of Mateus, which dates to the second quarter of the twelfth century, is the oldest known source for this Rite.Missal De Mateus, (Lisbon: Funda√ß√£o Calouste Gulbenkain, 1975), x and xvi. It was more than 200 years old at the time of Pope Pius V's papal bulls Quod a nobis of 9 July 1568 and Quo primum of 14 July 1570. The rite was unaffected by the imposition of the Roman Rite throughout the Latin Church. This was due to the exception made for regions where another rite had been in use for at least two centuries. However, the Roman Rite was increasingly adopted within the archdiocese and non-traditional elements were admitted into celebrations of the archdiocese's rite. In the 20th century an attempt was made by Archbishop Manuel Vieira de Matos, with the approval of Pope Pius XI, to expunge these accretions, to revise the texts and to make the rite obligatory within the archdiocese.Reid (2005), p. 129 After the Second Vatican Council the priests of the archdiocese, while authorized to use the Rite of Braga, have in general opted to use the Roman Rite.  Rite  A peculiarity of the Rite of Braga is the recitation of the Ave Maria at the start of Mass and of the Sub tuum praesidium at the end. In a talk on 24 October 1998, Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger cited the Rite of Braga as one of the liturgical rites whose variety within the Latin Church demonstrated that unity does not require liturgical uniformity.Address on 24 October 1998 for the tenth anniversary of the motu proprio Ecclesia Dei  References  Latin liturgical rites Roman Catholic Ecclesiastical Province of Braga ","title":"Rite of Braga"},{"id":"36526279","text":"Major Edward Thomas Major Edward Thomas MC (15 April 1915 - 1999) was awarded a Military Cross in May 1941 for his actions at Halfaya Pass. Early life Edward Thomas went to school at Emanuel School in London, England, after which he became a surveyor. He joined the Territorial Army and became an officer in the Norfolk Yeomanry. World War II In May 1941, Halfaya Pass (\\"Hellfire Pass\\"), Egypt was in British hands under a battalion of infantry and tanks. The Germans attacked on 26 May in great numbers, but the order to retreat was delayed. Thomas was ordered to the head of the pass with one gun and upon finding 260 Battery without officers he took command and arranged the evacuation of the wounded. He then encountered a further 100 men with no leaders from the Royal Indian Army Service Corps; he commandeered their trucks and drove the remaining survivors through a recently established German camp to safety. Upon reaching safety, he was summoned to appear before General Erskine. Thomas had not thought his actions to be out of the ordinary, and so he feared a Court Martial for an accidental misdemeanour. The award of his Military Cross was therefore a great surprise. He was later seconded to the Sudan Defence Force and remained in the Sudan and Abyssinia for the remainder of the war, rising to the temporary rank of Khamakam (Brigadier). His merit led to him administering large areas of Libya from Kufra Oasis, in which his fluency in Arabic came in useful. Post war As the war drew to a close he was asked to stay on by both Emperor Haile Selassie and the King of Libya, but elected to return home to England and continue the development of the family property business which he did so successfully. Later life Thomas later became a popular joint master of the Hampshire Hunt and a keen rider. The onset of bronchitis at the age of 60 encouraged him to settle in Spain with his wife, Ruth. He died in 1999 in France. Family Thomas had two sons, David and Hugh Thomas, a former British olympian and now Badminton Horse Trials director and course designer.

In 1894, the cannery was completely rebuilt after being burned to the ground. Five years later Kinney became part of the Columbia River Packers Association, joining several other canneries and packing companies. By 1904, the complex supported three production lines; Kinney continued cannery operations until the 1920s when it was primarily used as a central machine shop and warehouse for the Columbia River Packers Association. In 1954, a cargo ship ran into the complex, part of which was lost. Intact portions were used for storage until 1980 and today house shops and small businesses. The cannery was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 30, 1989, but was delisted on September 8, 1997. History Kinney Cannery, located in Uniontown between Fifth and Seventh streets, was constructed in 1879. The cannery was run by the Astoria Packing Company, of which Marshall J. Kinney, son of Robert C. Kinney, was president. During 1881 the complex, then referred to as the \\"largest and most extensive salmon-packing establishment on the Pacific Coast\\", reportedly packed 26,000 cases of salmon. According to the Chief of Engineers of the United States Army, as printed in the Annual Report of the Secretary of War (1890), the cannery packed 7,500 cases of salmon worth nearly $40,000 during the season of 1887. In 1894, the complex burned to the ground and was completely rebuilt. In 1899, the cannery became part of the Columbia River Packers Association, joining the Samuel Elmore Cannery, Fisherman's Packing Co., J.O. Hanthorn & Co., J.W. Seaborg and Scandinavian Packing Co., among others. Note: Thesis presented to the Interdisciplinary Studies Program: Historic Preservation and the Graduate School of the University of Oregon. Kinney buildings at the river end were used for warehouse space; the older ones along the shore continued cannery operations. The former location of the cannery By 1904, the Kinney complex supported three production lines. It was divided into two sections separated by a \\"planked extension\\" of Sixth Street. On the west side stood a 200' x 170' wood frame warehouse which, after 1910, housed the machine shop and stored cannery equipment, cans and labels, and marine engines. This section later housed offices for Alaskan production. On the east side of Sixth Street stood an 80' x 150' \\"two-story, semi-mill constructed\\" can factory building. The complex continued cannery operations until the 1920s when it was primarily used as a central machine shop and warehouse for the Columbia River Packers Association. Nothing remains of Gunderson's Cannery Cafe after a 2010 fire By the 1940s, the Kinney complex had expanded \\"significantly\\". In 1954, an outbound cargo ship carrying 8,000 tons of grain ran into the complex, part of which was lost. Remaining buildings were used for storage until 1980 and have since been converted to shops. Part of the complex was restored and a lookout was built on its wharf to encourage business; however, other parts of the Kinney complex remained in ruins. The cannery was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 30, 1989. However, the complex was delisted from the Register on September 8, 1997.

It was originally broadcast in the United States on ABC on May 10, 2011. The episode was directed by David Platt and written by Sunil Nayar and series creator Christopher Murphey. In this episode, Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) investigates when Joe Salerno (Derek Russo), a friend of Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn), is found dead, after being run over. However, Megan concludes that he was dead before the car hit him. Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) finds out that Joe was doing freelance work on a cold case involving Lizzy Adler (Rebecca Blumhagen), a student athlete who was murdered. After getting Lizzy's body exhumed, Megan realizes the same person killed Joe and Lizzy. Meanwhile, Megan asks her mother Joan (Joanna Cassidy) to help with the case. The episode received positive reviews, and was watched by 10.11 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, on the Tuesday night it aired in the United States. Critic Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic praised the scenes between Samantha and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) calling them \\"sweet\\", as well as praising the scenes between Megan and Joan, adding that Joan was \\"a real piece of work\\" in this episode. Plot Detective Joe Salerno (Derek Russo), a very dear friend of Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn), is found dead, after being run over by Sara Gonzales (Diane Guerrero). When Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) arrives on scene, she concludes that he was dead before the car hit him, having been thrown off the bridge above the road. A distraught Samantha and Megan visit Joe's wife Helen (Kathryn Meisle) and their daughter Becky (F√°tima Ptacek). Helen says that Joe had been distant before he died, after he was under review for assaulting Chuck Foster (John Magaro). Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) discovers Joe was doing freelance work on a cold case involving Lizzy Adler (Rebecca Blumhagen), a student athlete who was murdered, with Chuck being the prime suspect. Megan, Bud, Samantha and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) talk to Lizzy's lacrosse coach, Hal Davis, who states that Joe had been visiting the team recently. Megan exhumes Lizzy's body, without her boss, Kate Murphy's (Jeri Ryan), permission. Megan gets her judge mother, Joan (Joanna Cassidy) to sign the request, who tells Megan that Lizzy is buried in the same graveyard as Megan's father David, who committed suicide when Megan was twelve. Megan and Peter later visit David's grave. Megan receives backlash from Kate for not following procedure, but clay found in both Lizzy and Joe's pockets match. Samantha realizes that Joe found the crime scene of Lizzy's murder; the tennis courts at her school. Kate and Megan study her body and find a hand impression on her back, which matches one of her friends Heather Clayton (Meg Chambers Steedle). Heather killed Lizzy after she broke her finger during a lacrosse game. Lizzy's body was found elsewhere, meaning Heather had help moving the body, so Megan finds out that Lou helped Heather.

Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic said of the episode: \\"Buried Secrets\\" left me wondering if there was even more to Megan's father's death than a simple suicide. There must be a story there and I hope we get to hear more of it. It would be nice to see Megan get her answers, no matter what they may be\\". Orlando called Joan \\"a real piece of work\\" saying that she could not understand why Joan would not allow Megan to exhume her father's body. She added that Joan was \\"cold\\" saying this adding, \\"I suddenly understood why Megan avoids Mom like the plague\\". Of the conversation between Samantha and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) she said, \\"Ethan's story about losing his guinea pig as a child was sad and sweet. In his own strange way he was trying to relate to Samantha and the death of her friend. Plus, it painted a heart- breaking picture of a sad, lonely boy\\". She added that the death of the episode \\"caused a ripple effect, touching everyone who came near it\\", including Kate, who she said that she admired Megan for exhuming the body, as \\"she's not allowed to flaunt [sic] the rules the way Megan is prone to do.

In 1911, the United States Congress created a single code encompassing all statutes related to the judiciary and took the opportunity to revise and unify existing laws. At the same time, Congress abolished the U.S. circuit courts as of January 1, 1912, the effective date of the statute. Established by the Judiciary Act of 1789, the circuit courts served as the most important trial courts of the federal judiciary for over a century. The circuit courts lost their limited appellate jurisdiction in the Judiciary Act of 1891, which created the U.S. courts of appeals, but as part of the political compromise behind the 1891 Act, the circuit courts continued to serve as trial courts alongside the district courts for the next 20 years. By abolishing the circuit courts and transferring their jurisdiction and pending business to the district courts, Congress instituted a judicial system with a single type of trial court and eliminated the inefficiencies associated with administering two types of court that were often presided over by the same judge. The remainder of the Judicial Code of 1911 was not so much a reorganization of the structure or procedures of the federal courts as it was a standardization of law governing the judiciary. Over more than 120 years, many contradictory statutes had accumulated through legislation approved for the purpose of organizing individual courts. Congress had first gathered the statutes related to the judiciary into a single code in the Revised Statutes adopted in 1874, but the resulting Title XIII preserved all of the legislation then in effect without reconciling the varying rules and court structures that often applied to the same types of courts in different parts of the country. In 1899, Congress appointed a commission to recommend revisions in the judicial code, and the subsequent report became the basis of the proposed revision submitted to Congress in March 1910. The broad reconsideration of judicial statutes encouraged some members of Congress to use the proposed code as a means to enact a substantial reorganization of the courts or to win approval for major legislation indirectly related to the judicial function. Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives offered amendments to restrict the issuance of injunctions in labor disputes, and House members revived the debate over the monetary value required to establish diversity jurisdiction in cases involving parties from different states. They hoped that a $5000 limit, up from $2000, would restrict the ability of corporations to remove cases from the state courts. The House narrowly defeated an amendment that would have sharply limited the ability of a corporation to remove a case regardless of the amount involved. The approved code increased the jurisdictional amount to $3000, but for the most part Congress resisted the suggestions to enact major new legislation through the revised code. The abolition of the circuit courts prompted numerous lesser changes, the most significant of which was the provision authorizing a senior circuit judge or circuit justice to assign a circuit judge to hold a district court \\"whenever ‚Ä¶ the public interest shall require.\\" External links * Judicial Code of 1911: statute text (limited excerpts) * The Judicial Code of 1911 and the abolition of the U.S. Circuit Courts: \\"An Act to codify, revise, and amend the laws relating to the judiciary.\\"; Landmark Judicial Legislation at the Federal Judicial Center * The Judicial code : being the Judiciary Act of the Congress of the United States, approved March 3, A.D. 1911, with an introduction and annotations by James Love Hopkins. https://archive.org/details/cu31924020607259 1911 in American law 1911 History of the United States government 61st United States Congress United States civil procedure ","title":"Judicial Code of 1911"},{"id":"36526632","title":"1942 Uruguayan general election"},{"id":"36526646","text":"Clyde Raymond Miller (July 7, 1888 ‚Äì August 29, 1977) was an associate professor of education at Teachers College, Columbia University who co-founded the Institute for Propaganda Analysis with Edward A.

In the 1930s Miller was a director of educational services and later an associate professor in the Columbia University Teachers' College. In 1937 he co-founded the Institute for Propaganda Analysis, and wrote extensively about the subject of propaganda techniques and how to detect them. Miller's propaganda analysis techniques were significantly incorporated into the progressive curriculum policies of The Springfield Plan in the mid-1940s. The Springfield Plan was a widely lauded and emulated curriculum for intercultural education that was implemented in the public school system of Springfield, Massachusetts. The plan was the subject of several books, numerous academic journal articles, and it was the subject of a 1945 Warner Bros. short film, It Happened in Springfield, starring Andrea King. Miller is the author of several books. His articles, speeches and essays were published in a number of journals, essay collections and magazines. In 1946 he published The Process of Persuation.

Wide span vehicles can measure up to wide or wider. The impetus behind wide span vehicles in farming is to reduce the amount of soil that becomes damaged (e.g., from compaction) from farm vehicles. Controlled traffic farming (CTF) is also aimed at solving this problem and both CTF and wide span vehicles can be used together to further improve land use. The many benefits of using wide span vehicles in farming include improved soil quality, less land lost to wheelways, increase in farm profits, less fuel use, reduced chemical use from more precise application, and increased types of land available for organic farming. History David Dowler was a pioneer of wide span vehicle farming and created a first prototype gantry, called P1, in January 1978. Dowler went on to build and apply for patents on many wide span- related machines.

Also known as the Gibraltar \\"E\\" Head Lighthouse, its tower is painted grey. The active lighthouse is west of the Rock of Gibraltar and positioned at the elbow of the North Mole at Gibraltar Harbour. The lighthouse is operated by the Gibraltar Port Authority. History Gibraltar Harbour (shown on map), also referred to as the Port of Gibraltar, is on the west side of Gibraltar, at latitude 36¬∞09'N and longitude 05¬∞20'W. In addition to the protection provided by the Rock, the harbour now has a system of man-made defences. These include three breakwaters: the North Mole (formerly the Commercial Mole) with its Western Arm, the Detached Mole (in the middle), and the South Mole. The mole was defended by the North Mole Elbow Battery, which operated until as late as the end of the Second World War, with another gun mounted at the end of the mole. In May 2011, the North Mole was the site of an explosion of an oil storage tank. The South Mole has an extension, and was formerly known as the New Mole and New Mole Extension (to distinguish it from the Old Mole at the northeastern corner of the harbour). Gibraltar Harbour has north and south entrances. The northern entry is between the Western Arm of the North Mole and the Detached Mole. The southern is bordered by the Detached Mole and the South Mole. Description The Gibraltar North Mole Elbow Lighthouse (shown on map and pictured in links below) is located at the elbow of the L-shaped North Mole of Gibraltar Harbour. It is positioned at the \\"E\\" head of the North Mole, from which the lighthouse derives its alternate name. The lighthouse and harbour are west of the Rock of Gibraltar, and north of the east end of the Strait of Gibraltar, which serves as access to the Mediterranean. The Gibraltar North Mole Elbow Lighthouse is a grey, square, skeletal tower, with a height of 25 metres (82 feet). The skeletal tower has a round harbour control room, watch room, and gallery platform. The light is emitted from a skeletal extension of the main tower which has been installed adjacent to the control room. The lighthouse is operational and is utilised as an aid to navigation, in and near the port. The light characteristic is a fixed red light, with a range of five nautical miles. The active lighthouse has a focal plane of 28 metres (92 feet). The lighthouse tower is closed to the public. Opinions differ as to whether the site is open to the public. The lighthouse is operated by the Gibraltar Port Authority. The United Kingdom Hydrographic Office Admiralty List of Lights and Fog Signals number for the Gibraltar North Mole Elbow Lighthouse is D 2449.2.

Jefford was a violinist who became a co- founder of the Anchorage Symphony Orchestra. During World War II, she entertained at the United Service Organizations in Alaska and transported medical supplies for the Red Cross Motor Corp. She was the first woman in Alaska to receive the Wright Brothers Master Pilot Award. She was inducted into the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame in 2009. Early life Ruth Martin was born July 16, 1914 in Des Moines, Iowa. Her mother arranged flying lessons for the 16-year-old Ruth when they lived in Lincoln, Nebraska, where she learned to solo in instructor Jim Hurst's Arrow Sport airplane. Fellow pilot Jack Jefford recruited Hurst for a job with the Civil Aeronautics Authority. Jack Jefford moved to Alaska in 1937. Ruth married Hurst, and in 1941 the couple moved to Alaska, where he continued with the CAA. Alaska When they moved to Alaska, the December 7, 1941 Attack on Pearl Harbor had just happened, and the United States had entered World War II. Early on, she met Lorene Harrison, at the time a choir director for a local church. Harrison, learning that Ruth was a violinist, involved her in the local United Service Organizations (USO) efforts to entertain the military. Harrison would go on to serve on many cultural boards in the state and have a room at the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts named after her. Ruth became part of the Red Cross Motor Corps during the war, delivering medical supplies. Ruth and Jim Hurst bought a 1941 Taylorcraft airplane and began International Air Taxi Service out of Merrill Field. In addition to carrying mail deliveries and transporting people, Ruth became the first female licensed flight instructor operating out of Merrill Field. The couple continued to be business partners, even after they divorced in 1961. In 1971, Ruth married Jack Jefford, and they formed the Valley Air Transport. In the 1940s, Ruth was one of seven musicians who formed the Anchorage Symphony Orchestra. She spent the next 38 years as the symphony's concert master. Death Ruth M. Jefford died on January 9, 2007, and was buried at Anchorage Memorial Park. Jack Jefford died in 1979. Awards Ruth Jefford received the Federal Aviation Administration's Wright Brothers Master Pilot Award in 2006, the first woman in Alaska to receive it. The award is granted to certified pilots in the United States who have been deemed to have practiced safe flight operations for 50 years or more. As of July 2012, there were 38 male Alaskan pilots who received the award, but Jefford has remained the only woman in Alaska so honored. She was inducted into the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame in 2009.

Literally translated, \\"yamabiko\\" means \\"echo\\". It is the y≈çkai responsible for the natural phenomenon in mountains or canyons. Living deep in the mountains, direct encounters with the yamabiko are rare. Often they are heard, but never seen. The small and elusive yokai wasn't officially classified until the Edo period in Japan. Instead the bizarre noises coming from the mountain were attributed to a natural phenomenon, like birds, and not given any spiritual significance. It is usually depicted with gray fur, peach-colored belly, floppy ears, large grin, and arms outstretched as though it is caught mid- shrug. Mythology The yamabiko is a small creature that resembles a cross between a dog and a monkey. The term \\"yamabiko\\" is also used to describe the phenomenon of a delayed echo in mountains and valleys, and is thought to be the spirit answering. In this case, it is written as ÂπΩË∞∑Èüø. This anomaly is also sometimes called \\"kodama\\", when it is thought to be the answering voice of a tree spirit (Êú®Èúä or Êú®È≠Ç). Legends by area In Tottori, Tottori Prefecture, a or a that lives in the mountain is thought to give out the yamabiko's voice. In Kusuyama of Hashikami village, Hata District, K≈çchi Prefecture (now Sukumo), regardless of whether it was day or night, when a sudden dreadful voice is heard deep in the mountains, this strange phenomenon is called \\"yamahiko\\". They are sometimes seen to be the same as the yamawaro, spoken of in Western Japan, as well as the yamako in the Wakan Sansai Zue, and as it is thought that tree spirits would cause yamabiko to occur, they are also seen to be the same as the y≈çkai penghou that lives in trees. In collections of y≈çkai depictions like the Hyakkai Zukan and the Gazu Hyakki Yagy≈ç, the yamabiko that looks like a dog is thought to be based on the yamako or the penghou. The aforementioned yobukodori of Tottori is said to take on the appearance of a bird, and other than that, there is also a small rock mountain in Kitaazumi District, Nagano Prefecture called the \\"yamabiko rock\\" that return people's words, among other appearances of the word \\"yamabiko\\", and thus it can be seen that the yamabiko as y≈çkai are not uniform in either origin or what kind of y≈çkai they are.

The initial announcement stated that the band would be playing a special anniversary gig at the O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire in London on December 15, 2012, consisting of two sets: the first being made up of greatest hits and the second being the album Fire, performed in its entirety. Plans to film the performance fell through, but, otherwise, the gig went ahead as planned. In addition to the two sets, Dick Valentine opened the show with a small solo set and the band performed an encore. In 2013, the band resurrected the project, raising production funds via a Kickstarter campaign. The show was performed at St. Andrews Hall in Detroit, Michigan on September 7, 2013. Among other fundraising perks, the band offered five opportunities for people to choose a song of their choice for the band to record a cover version of. The songs selected were \\"Gary's In the Park\\" by Gary Wilson, \\"Maneater\\" by Hall & Oates, \\"Pok√©mon Theme\\" by Jason Paige, \\"Rock DJ\\" by Robbie Williams, \\"She Drives Me Crazy\\" by Fine Young Cannibals and \\"2112: Overture/The Temple of Syrinx\\" by Rush.

The organisation was established on 1 January 1875. History =Beginnings= In May 1874, the Reverend Thomas Vincent Fosbery (chaplain to Bishop Samuel Wilberforce), together with Mary Elizabeth Townsend (1841-1918),See her biography at Townsend [n√©e Butler], Mary Elizabeth (1841-1918) in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Catharine Tait (1819-1878), Elizabeth Browne (wife of the bishop of Winchester), and Jane Senior (1828-1877), met at Lambeth Palace and agreed on the basis for establishing the Girls' Friendly Society, which officially began its work on 1 January 1875. \\"The original rough plan of the Society's work and aim was written down in pencil in a tiny notebook in 1872,\\" Mary Elizabeth Townsend wrote in 1882 recalling her original concept. She shared her concept with Fosbery who had encouraged her in her previous charitable work with working-class women. Fosbery introduced her to the older women with whom they formed the original steering committee. Mary Elizabeth Townsend was the first president of the GFS and served as such through 1882. She was succeeded by Lady Grey who served from 1883 through 1889, when Townsend again resumed the presidency from 1890 through 1892.Barbarina Charlotte Sullivan Grey, wife of Admiral Sir Frederick Grey Mary Sidgwick Benson, wife of the Archbishop of Canterbury, was president from 1893 through 1895. The GFS was set up to be non-sectarian; however, it utilised the infrastructure of the Church of England with parish, deanery, and diocesan groups. Its central office was in London, as befits a national organisation. Originally it was open to unmarried girls fourteen and older, but by 1879 it began to admit girls as young as eight years old. The core values of the GFS aimed at high moral standards for its members; they attempted to supply \\"for every working girl of unblemished character a friend in a class above her own.\\" This insistence that the girls must be of unblemished character, which was usually interpreted as meaning virginity, was highly contentious, although it is unclear how far it was tested in practice. Certainly some girls were asked to return their membership cards when they were suspected of having engaged in immoral conduct, and one girl sued for libel after the GFS expelled her as a member on the grounds that she was suspected of having an affair with a married man. Some clergy were in favour of the rule whilst others argued it was against the Christian ideal of forgiveness. This contention was partly the reason why the GFS never became an official CofE organisation, and this, in turn, meant it remained entirely female-managed although hugely influential, particularly as a bridge between the official Sunday Schools and Mothers‚Äô Unions. There were two classes of membership: the working-class girls, known as members, and the ladies, called associates. As it mimicked the founders‚Äô own relationships with their servants, so it naturally attracted the huge domestic servant class, girls who often led a tough and lonely existence as maids-of-all-work in households with only one or two staff. It was less popular with shopgirls, who saw themselves as a cut above, and Northern millgirls, who were, according to a GFS report, \\"undisciplined, impatient of reproof and entirely wanting in self-control\\". Both members and associates paid annual subscription fees tailored for their class, half of which went to the local group and half to the central office. Associates provided \\"recreation rooms\\" often in parish facilities, although sometimes in their own homes, where working-class girls could meet with associates and each other, read, sew, sing, and enjoy simple refreshments. Later \\"houses of rest\\" were established for these purposes. The local groups were called \\"branches\\" and the whole organisation was conceived of as a large tree with the central office as the trunk, and the members as leaves. The central office of the GFS established a wide range of departments: one for their shop and factory workers programmes, one for publications, one for their \\"houses of rest\\" and one to deal with affiliated societies. GFS services included a circulating library and an employment exchange. The GFS published various journals including Friendly Leaves, Friendly Work and The Associates Journal. Publicity was also provided by Charlotte Mary Yonge, who featured the GFS in such novels as her The Two Sides of the Shield (1885). They also produced many plays and pageants, often celebrating women of achievement while promoting the GFS ideals. Typical of these is the event produced by the Chelmsford Branch celebrating the achievements of Essex women. This opens with the arrival of a young country girl at a London railway station. She is frightened and alone, having been stood up by the young man who arranged to meet her. Luckily, she is befriended by a GFS associate, who takes her to a cafe and inspires her by telling her of the many great Essex women who have brought fame to their county. Another typical production was by the pageant master Louis N Parker, \\"The Quest\\", first produced at the Albert Hall in 1925, in which a girl has to choose between the \\"tinselled\\" low way or the high way. By 1878, the GFS had a presence in 19 dioceses in the United Kingdom and Gibraltar, as well as the first branches of the Girls' Friendly Society in America and Ireland. It had 10,678 members and 4,442 associates. As the GFS expanded so did their concerns and the scope of their work. New departments established in the late 1800s included one dealing with the special needs of sick and blind members, and one dealing with the safety of emigrating girls and women had been established. During the 1880s and 1890s, the GFS increased their offerings of training courses and workshops. Beginning in 1880, Queen Victoria bestowed her royal patronage on the society and the queen herself acted as an associate and admitted servant girls at Balmoral to membership. page 8 =1900s= In 1901 Her Majesty Queen Alexandra consented to become Patron of GFS. In 1902 H.R.H. the Princess of Wales consented to be Vice-Patron of GFS. On St David's Day in 1910 a great gathering of GFS was held in the Queen's Hall, when the Princess of Wales consented to receive purses and present certificates on behalf of the Lodges and Homes of Rest Fund. Later in the same year the Princess of Wales became Her Majesty Queen Mary and consented to become Patron of GFS. GFS is not a political organisation and was not a participant in the women's suffrage movement in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. The GFS quickly spread across the Atlantic and around the Commonwealth. A number of Holiday Houses (retreat centers) as well as summer camp facilities were established in the United States, and many remain in operation. Constance Adelaide Smith and Ellen Porter of the Girls Friendly Society lodge led a campaign to promote Mothering Sunday following a decline in its popularity. Smith was inspired by the work carried out in the US by Anna Jarvis. Jarvis fought for a national calendar date honoring the sacrifices Mother's make for their children amidst a background of national holidays favoring male achievements. = 2000s = In 2003, the chief executive of GFS described teenage pregnancy, low income, housing, as well as low confidence and self esteem among teenage girls as serious issues. She described the work of GFS as including supported housing for homeless young women and teenage mothers. In 2006, HRH The Duchess of Cornwall became the patron of GFS. Her work with GFS included visiting a housing project in Bromley. At the time, the work of GFS included providing services to girls and young women through 40 youth work branches and four community projects that worked with socially excluded women under the age of 25. In 2016, the Small Charities Coalition matched the Unicef UK digital engagement team with GFS to review and develop GFS's digital strategy. Unicef UK consulted with key stakeholders within GFS and subsequently designed a digital strategy, which was presented to GFS staff. In 2019, a Girls Friendly Society group was launched in Leytonstone with the support of the Head of Waltham Forest Council. The group provides a safe, female-only space for play, socialising and activities. Planned activities include local trips out, creative sessions and skills building. Programme The contemporary Girls Friendly Society programme is informed by issues facing girls and young women. Topics cover issues such as friendship, bullying, healthy relationships and modern women. The weekly group meetings are intended to be a safe space for girls and young women to make friends, have fun and develop skills. GFS groups meet weekly for about an hour and a half. Activities in the groups are based around the programme themes of Happy to Be Me, My Community, Be Creative, Get Active, Have Fun, and Skills for Life. Girls Friendly Society Worldwide GFS Worldwide provides support for GFS programmes and projects around the world, seeking to transform unjust structures of society, particularly for women and children. GFS Worldwide is governed by a set of guidelines and each GFS country operates under its own constitution and rules.https://www.gfsworld.org/, retrieved 18 December 2018 =Australia= GFS Australia began as a local branch of the Girls‚Äô Friendly Society.

He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 31 October 1989. The character was initially played by Benjamin Mitchell, before Scott Michaelson took over the role two years later. Brad was re- introduced alongside his sister, Gaby (Rachel Blakely), during a period of roller coaster ratings for the show. Michaelson revealed that as soon as he learnt he had won the role of Brad, he went surfing five days in a row, as he knew he was going to be busy over the upcoming months. Michaelson signed a new twelve-month contract with Neighbours in October 1992 and a year later, he announced he would be leaving the soap. Michaelson filmed his final scenes in November and departed on 15 December 1993. Before the character returned to Neighbours, he was said to be living in America after gaining a basketball scholarship. The scriptwriters had wanted Brad to become a professional player, but after Michaelson told them he was a surfer, Brad became a \\"surf bum\\" instead. Brad was described as being a \\"friend to all\\" and a \\"nice, lovable fool\\". He had a caring attitude and a love for family. The character's storylines often revolved around his relationships. He dated his neighbour, Lucy Robinson (Melissa Bell), and then fell in love with Beth Brennan (Natalie Imbruglia). The couple became engaged, but Beth learned Brad was having an affair with Lauren Carpenter (Sarah Vandenbergh) on their wedding day. After dating different people for a while, Brad and Beth got back together and married. In August 1992, Brad was shot after trying to save his mother from a hostage situation involving Bob Landers (Bruce Kilpatrick). Michaelson stated that Brad's actions might not have been sensible, but he acted instinctively and the actor thought that others would have reacted the same way. A writer from BBC Online named the storyline as Brad's most notable moment throughout his duration on the show. While a reporter for the Herald Sun called Brad \\"one of the show's most popular characters\\" and commented that Michaelson had a huge following because of his good looks. For his portrayal of Brad, Michaelson earned a nomination for Most Popular Actor at the 1993 Logie Awards. He also received a nomination for Hottest Man in Soap at the Inside Soap TV Awards, while Brad was nominated for Best Male Character. The character was reintroduced in early 2013, with Kip Gamblin taking over the role. Brad displayed a more mature attitude, but still retained his relaxed outlook. He returned with a new wife Terese (Rebekah Elmaloglou) and their twins, Josh (Harley Bonner) and Imogen (Ariel Kaplan). His other three children Paige (Olympia Valance), Piper (Mavournee Hazel) and Ned (Ben Hall), were also introduced. Brad later marries Lauren (now Kate Kendall). On 7 April 2017, both characters departed the show. Casting Benjamin Mitchell made a brief appearance as Brad in October 1989, before going on to play the character's cousin, Cameron Hudson.Johnston 2005, p.220. Scott Michaelson then took over the role and he made his debut appearance in August 1991, alongside Rachel Blakely who played Brad's sister, Gaby. The characters were introduced to the show during a period of roller coaster ratings. Of the castings, James Cockington of The Sydney Morning Herald said \\"Ten still believes there is life in Ramsay Street and is introducing some new, young residents this week. Rachel Blakely, 23, and Scott Michaelson, 20, conform to the teen hunk/spunk category that has made E Street such a fun place to visit.\\" Cockington opined that Michaelson looked like he had been taken from a surfboard at the Beach by a Grundy's talent scout. He quipped \\"Scott's panel-van accent, by the way, is genuine.\\" Michaelson revealed to a writer from Inside Soap that as soon as he learnt he had won the role of Brad, he went surfing five days a week as he knew he was going to be busy over the upcoming months. He added that he intended to stay with the soap for a quite a while, though he would not stay for longer than four years. Development =Characterisation= Before he made his first appearance in Neighbours, Brad was said to be living in America after gaining a basketball scholarship.Monroe 1996, p.55. On his way to Australia, Brad stopped off in the fictional country of Bahgee and was arrested for drug trafficking. His parents, Doug (Terence Donovan) and Pam (Sue Jones), flew out to help him and Brad returned with them to Ramsay Street, where he was reunited with his elder sister, Gaby. The scriptwriters had wanted Brad to be a professional basketball player, but when Michaelson was offered the role, he told them he was a surfer and the character became a \\"surf bum\\" instead. On his first day in Erinsborough, Brad went to the beach to catch the waves and Josephine Monroe, author of Neighbours: The First 10 Years, commented that it was clear Brad was not going to be a high achiever like his siblings. In his book, Neighbours: 20 years of Ramsay Street, Tony Johnston described Brad as a blond, tanned surfer, who matched his brawn with a caring attitude and a love for family.Johnston 2005, p.63. Johnston branded Brad \\"a hunk\\" and a \\"friend to all.\\" A writer for Inside Soap described Brad as a \\"nice, lovable fool\\", while a TV Times journalist stated that \\"no one would put money on him winning a prize for original thinking.\\" Brad's love for surfing eventually led him to find employment at a surfboard shop, where he designed boards for a while. However, when he realised his designs were being ripped off, he took a job at The Waterhole alongside his sister, Gaby.Monroe 1996, p.57. The siblings ended up competing for the manager's job and a writer for Inside Soap stated that both Brad and Gaby were convinced they were the right person for the position. They try to prove their worth to Philip Martin (Ian Rawlings), however when Gaby issues an ultimatum to him to choose between her and Brad, Philip fires her and promotes Brad. Following his reintroduction in 2013, Brad had matured, but still maintained his \\"relaxed attitude to life\\" and friendly demeanour. He had become a PE teacher during his time away from Erinsborough, as it allowed him to spend time outside. He also became a swimming coach to his son Josh. A writer for the show's official website stated, \\"while he doesn't dwell on the past, he finds it difficult to escape at times.\\" =Relationships= While he is in Surfers Paradise with Lucy Robinson (Melissa Bell) and Josh Anderson (Jeremy Angerson), Brad realised he was attracted to Lucy. However, upon meeting Beth Brennan (Natalie Imbruglia) at the resort, he realised he fancied her too. Brad and Josh competed with each other to win her over, but Brad eventually chose to date Lucy. Of his character's attraction to her, Michaelson said \\"Whenever Brad sees Lucy there's this real tension, there's a really long lead up, but they finally get together.\\" Beth later followed the group back to Erinsborough and continued her quest for Brad. Monroe said Lucy and Brad were \\"a pretty solid item though\\" and Beth did not get a look in. Michaelson branded the storyline \\"just your typical soap opera love triangle\\", but agreed that it was gripping. Brad and Lucy's relationship ended when Lucy decided to pursue her modelling career in Singapore. Natalie Imbruglia portrayed Beth Brennan, Brad's love interest and eventual wife. Just one week after Lucy's departure, Beth came to Brad and asked him to have sex with her. She was fed up of being teased by Annalise Hartman (Kimberley Davies) for being a virgin. However, Brad turned Beth down, telling her to wait until she was in love. While discussing the scene, Michaelson became worried that some viewers thought Brad might be gay. He commented \\"After all, not many guys would say 'no' to Beth Brennan.\\" Michaelson also thought Beth was unreal when she came straight out and asked Brad to have sex with her. Despite his initial rejection of Beth's advances, Brad succumbs to them a few weeks later. A columnist for Inside Soap commented that it did not take him long to get over Lucy. After a siege in which Brad is shot, Beth admitted her love for him.Mercado 2004, p.218. The couple became engaged, after Beth mistakes Brad's present of a friendship ring for an engagement ring. Because she was so excited with the idea of being engaged, Brad did not have the heart to tell her his real intentions, despite knowing it was not a good basis for a successful marriage. Michaelson later revealed that Brad would turn into \\"a creep\\" when he starts dating two girls at once. Brad catches the eye of Lauren Carpenter (Sarah Vandenbergh) while she is riding her horse along the beach and Monroe stated that there was an \\"instant attraction\\" between them.Monroe 1996, p.34. She later said the chemistry between Brad and Lauren was set to blow his romance with Beth apart. Lauren befriended Beth and realised what was going on between herself and Brad could make things tricky. Brad and Lauren began an affair, after they had sex on the beach. Despite being unsure about marriage, Brad still intended to go through with his wedding to Beth. On the day of the ceremony, Beth finally learnt what had been happening between her fianc√© and her friend. Imbruglia explained \\"They walk down the aisle together, but Beth is a bit unsure because that morning she sees Lauren and Brad together. And then she notices that Brad is just constantly looking at Lauren, and she just says 'Wait a minute, I don't think I can go through with this.\\" The wedding was filmed outside at a boat yard and Imbruglia revealed that there were twenty-four shots in the scene, which had to be filmed twenty different ways. Beth jilted Brad at the altar and left to stay with her mother, while he continued his relationship with Lauren. Brad and Lauren eventually broke up and Brad and Beth began dating other people, mostly so they could make each other jealous. Brad became \\"disastrously involved\\" with a 14-year-old schoolgirl called Ally Slater (Bryony Price), while Beth was wooed by Wayne Duncan (Jonathan Sammy-Lee). Imbruglia told Kelly Beswick of Inside Soap that going out with Wayne helped Beth repair her self-confidence, but at the end of the day he was just a distraction. Brad struggled to hide his feelings for Beth and he proposed to her at the same time Wayne did. Beth then revealed that she still loved Brad and accepted his proposal. Because of what happened during their first wedding, the couple decided to elope. However, their family and friends realised what was going on and tracked them down. Imbruglia revealed \\"They finally find us after the ceremony's actually taken place, but we decide not to tell them that we're actually married. So we're dragged back to Erinsborough for a second wedding and this time it's with all the trimmings.\\" After marrying for a second time, Brad and Beth then decided to move to Perth to start a new life together. =Shooting= In August 1992, Bob Landers (Bruce Kilpatrick) escaped from prison and held Phoebe Bright (Simone Robertson) hostage at gunpoint in Number 30. Pam unwittingly walked into the house and Bob took her hostage too. When Brad found out his mother was inside and her life was at risk, he immediately rushed to her rescue. As he leapt to Pam's defence, a shot was fired and Brad fell to the ground unconscious. Pam was then left fearing for her son's life. When asked by a TV Times reporter if Brad was being \\"foolhardy\\" with his actions, Michaelson replied \\"It may not have been the most sensible thing to do, but I reckon anyone would react like that if their mum was in danger. He acted instinctively, but I certainly hope I'd behave like that if anyone in my own family was being threatened by a gunman.\\" The actor stated that in a case like that, you would act first and worry about it later. He added that he would have been disappointed in Brad if he had not tried to help his mother and Phoebe. Brad's gunshot wound was not serious and after being treated at the hospital, he returned home. Bob was later arrested. =Departure= Michaelson signed a new twelve-month contract with the show in October 1992. However, when he took a four-week break in July 1993, David Brown of TV Week revealed that Michaelson was expected to announce his departure from Neighbours shortly after. Three months later, it was announced Michaelson was to leave the show. Brown reported the actor had entered contract negotiations with the network, but it soon became evident that he could not give them the long term commitment they wanted. Michaelson's management told Brown \\"Grundy also have plans to take the show in a new direction and I don't think Scott would fit in with those plans too well. Scott has work lined up in the UK next April and he wants to be free to do it.\\" The show's producers decided to marry Brad and Beth off and move them to Perth. Michaelson filmed his final scenes in November alongside Blakely and Imbruglia, who departed the show around the same time. =Reintroduction= On 7 February 2013, it was announced that the character would be returning to Neighbours, with actor Kip Gamblin taking over the role from Michaelson. In an interview with Erin McWhirter from TV Week, executive producer Richard Jasek revealed that he considered approaching Michaelson to play the role of Brad again, but learned that he was not acting anymore and believed that there was no point in reaching out to him. Of the recast, Gamblin told McWhirter \\"I'm sure there are going to be certain fans of the show who'll have an opinion about me as Brad, but that's out of my control. Richard says he doesn't hold any fears that long-time viewers will reject Kip as Brad, believing that enough time has passed for the show to pull of a successful recast. Brad, the character, has grown up and changed, so we're sure the recasting will be fine.\\" Gamblin relocated to Melbourne for the role, while his family stayed in Sydney. The actor started filming his scenes, alongside Rebekah Elmaloglou, from 18 February and he was first seen on-screen as Brad on 20 May 2013. Brad returned with his new wife, Terese (played by Elmaloglou), and their teenage children, Josh (Harley Bonner) and Imogen (Ariel Kaplan). Jasek commented that the Willis family would have a compelling and \\"unique backstory\\". Upon moving into Ramsay Street, Brad learns that Lauren (now played by Kate Kendall) also lives there with her family. Gamblin believed that Brad's feelings for Lauren were in the past and he is settled with Terese. He continued \\"However, I think Lauren may be struggling with his reappearance and, at first, she doesn't even tell her husband, Matt, that this new neighbour is her ex-boyfriend.\\" Gamblin explained that Terese has more of a problem with Brad's ex-wife Beth, than Lauren, as the end of the marriage was \\"very messy.\\" Brad and Terese met and were married quickly, making things awkward. =Departure (2017)= On 27 March 2017, it was confirmed that Gamblin would be leaving the show, along with Kendall. They filmed their final scenes in late 2016 before the annual production break. Gamblin then joined the cast of The Bodyguard in January 2017. On-screen, Brad and Lauren decide to leave Erinsborough for the Gold Coast. They departed on 7 April. Storylines =1989‚Äì1993= Brad meets Sharon Davies (Jessica Muschamp) and they go out on several dates together, the first is ruined when Brad takes Sharon to a basketball game he is playing in and on the second, Brad falls asleep during a movie much to Sharon's annoyance. A couple of years later, Brad returns to Erinsborough after his parents bail him out of an Asian jail. Brad befriends Guy Carpenter (Andrew Williams) and they start training for a cross-country race together. Brad is shocked when he discovers Guy has been using steroids to enhance his performance and he tries to talk him out of using them. Guy tells Brad to stay out of business, but Brad seeks advice from his mother, who tells Guy's aunt, Brenda Riley (Genevieve Lemon), what he has been doing. Brad begins working for Paige Sneddon (Tracy Callender) at a surf shop and he designs surfboards for her. They also begin dating. When Brad's boards are stolen from his garage, Guy becomes a suspect because a pendant found at the scene matches his one. Brad's sister, Gaby, confronts Guy and he explains a woman he previously dated gave him half of the pendant and he kept the other half. Guy realises that the woman was Paige, but his plan to get the truth out of her is ruined when Brad walks in on him asking her out on a date. Brad eventually discovers the stolen boards in Paige's garage and he breaks up with her. Brad spends Christmas in Surfer's Paradise with Lucy Robinson and Josh Anderson. The group meet David Brennan (Simon Stokes), who has been hiding out in their beach house, and his sister, Beth. Despite competing with Josh for Beth's affections, Brad realises he likes Lucy too.

When Lucy takes a modelling assignment overseas, she and Brad break up. Beth comes to Brad and asks him to have sex with her, but he turns her down. However, he changes his mind a week later and they start dating. Brad risks his life to save his mother from Bob Landers, when he begins an armed siege at Number 30. Brad is shot in the shoulder, but his injury is not serious and he does not spend long at the hospital. After the incident, Beth admits she loves Brad. While surfing one day, Brad is attacked by a shark. He escapes with minor injuries and suggests that the attack could be a marketing gimmick for the local coffee shop. His surfboard, which has a bite mark in it, is hung above the counter and the shop is renamed The Hungry Bite. Brad risks his life again to save Beth and Hannah Martin (Rebecca Ritters) from a burning cottage. Brad goes to give Beth a friendship ring, but she believes he is proposing to her and Brad does not correct her. Brad meets Lauren Carpenter on the beach and he begins an affair with her. Lauren suffers a pregnancy scare, but it emerges she has contracted chlamydia. On the day of their wedding, Beth notices Brad looking at Lauren and the affair is exposed. Beth jilts Brad and leaves Erinsborough. Brad continues seeing Lauren, but their relationship faces opposition from Pam. Brad leaves to work on a cruise ship for several months and he returns with Lucy in tow. Lauren becomes jealous of them and she and Brad later break up. Brad tries to win back Beth, but she is dating Wayne Duncan. Brad proposes to Beth only to learn that Wayne has also proposed. However, Beth chooses Brad. After their parents meddle in the planning of their wedding, Brad and Beth decide to elope and they marry in a registry office. However, their family and friends track them down and host a wedding for them back in Erinsborough. Brad and Beth then move to Perth and Beth gives birth to their son, Ned (Ben Hall). =2013‚Äì2017= Twenty years later, Brad returns to Erinsborough with his wife Terese and their twins Imogen and Josh. Brad soon learns Lauren also lives in Ramsay Street with her family, and he accidentally tells her husband, Matt (Josef Brown), about their past relationship. Matt struggles to accept Brad dated Lauren, but they begin an uneasy friendship. Brad coaches Josh, an aspiring swimmer, but he is devastated when Josh begins training with rival coach, Don Cotter (John Adam). Brad accuses Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) of making advances towards Terese. He admits that he is still jealous about Terese's troubled relationship with her ex-boss, who had feelings for her. Brad realises Don is sabotaging Josh's swimming career to help his rival Hudson Walsh (Remy Hii) and Josh terminates his contract with Don. Brad agrees to coach Hudson and he also becomes the manager of the local gym. Brad finds Imogen coughing up blood in the garden and she is rushed to hospital. Brad and Terese learn that she has an eating disorder and they get her help from a counsellor. Brad finds out Don gave Hudson a false alibi for the night of Robbo Slade's (Aaron Jakubenko) hit-and-run and Hudson confesses to hitting Robbo with Imogen's car. The Willises and Turners learn their children have covered up various incidents linked to Robbo's accident. They ban Josh and Amber (Jenna Rosenow) from seeing each other, but Brad and Lauren lift the ban, causing an argument with Terese.

Brad tells Terese about Tracey and she persuades him to tell Lauren. Brad and Lauren fly to Adelaide, and they share a kiss while they are there. Lauren leaves, but Brad stays to follow up on the address Tracey gave him. Brad is disappointed when he does not find his daughter and returns to Erinsborough. Brad is fired from his job at the gym, when his boss learns about the yoga classes he has been running on the side. Terese pushes Brad to accept a P.E. teaching position at Erinsborough High, but he confides in Lauren that teaching is not where his heart lies. However, when Terese administers tough love to the family, he accepts the position, even though it annoys Imogen and Josh. Paige Smith (Olympia Valance) befriends Brad and Josh, but clashes with Terese and Imogen. A couple of months later Paige is revealed to be Brad and Lauren's long lost daughter. She explains that she kept her identity a secret while she determined whether they and their families would accept her. Although initially welcoming her, Brad is put under pressure by Terese to do a DNA test. Terese exposes Paige as having trashed Harold's Store and has Matt arrest her, which offends Lauren and Brad. He refuses to forgive Terese when Matt reveals that she has been scheming to drive Paige out of Erinsborough. Terese later drops the charges against Paige. Brad admits that he and Lauren kissed while they were in Adelaide. Terese struggles with Brad's betrayal and becomes jealous when he spends time with Lauren and Paige. After Josh punches Chris Pappas (James Mason), Brad considers stealing evidence from Josh's case file, almost costing Imogen her job.

After Ezra is assaulted, Brad becomes the prime suspect and is arrested, but the charges are dropped when Gary Canning (Damien Richardson) confesses. Brad makes a surfboard in the Men's Shed, and Terese and Paige urge him to make it a full- time business. Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) accidentally drinks the chemical catalyst that Brad was using, and he suffers bad burns to the throat, leading to tension between Brad and Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne).

He also decides to become Doug's carer when Pam cannot look after him any longer. Brad is nominated for Erinsborough Citizen of the Year for his outreach program, but the venue, Lassiter's Hotel, explodes before the ceremony. Josh dies after he is pinned beneath a support column, devastating Brad. Hours later Brad is reunited with his eldest son, Ned, before Doug collapses and dies. Brad wins Citizen of the Year, but at the presentation the drone footage of him kissing Lauren is played, embarrassing Brad. Ned later admits he submitted the footage. Ned develops feelings for Lauren and kisses her, though regrets it and convinces her to keep quiet. When Piper finds out, she forces them to confess to Brad, who is devastated. Ned leaves, and Brad and Lauren's relationship is strained for a while.

Brad asks Father Jack Callahan (Andrew Morley) to help out after learning that Jack once ran a similar program in Queensland. They move Blaze Outreach into the empty Off Air bar. Brad and Terese hold a divorce party, where he proposes to Lauren. She turns down his first proposal, but accepts the second. Ned returns, but assures Brad that he is over Lauren. He gives Brad a tattooed wedding ring. The Blaze Outreach program loses sponsors and Aaron suggests that Brad introduce vocational training to the program. Ned tells Brad that he burnt down Maxine Cowper's (Kate Hood) house, so he begins paying her rent. Brad collapses and is hospitalised. His condition deteriorates and he fears for his life, so he asks Terese to take over Maxine's payments. Karl discovers Brad has been poisoned with arsenic, which was added to Ned's tattoo ink. Maxine asks for more money and threatens to tell everyone the truth, but Brad refuses to pay. Brad and Lauren marry. Immediately afterwards Lauren learns of Brad's secret payments to Maxine. Following Ned's arrest for arson, Brad and Lauren cancel their honeymoon to stay around to support Ned. After Ned completes his community service, he moves to the Gold Coast for a new job and Brad is saddened to lose him again. He goes with Ned to help him settle in, returning a few weeks later. Brad and Lauren then learn that their granddaughter Matilda is ill and her mother, Lauren's daughter Amber (Jenna Rosenow), had to quit her job to look after her. Lauren and Brad decide to sell up and move to the Gold Coast to join them and to be closer to Ned. After a farewell barbecue, they drive out of Ramsay Street with their family and friends wishing them luck.

University of Florida, IFAS. The genus includes several species that are among the most important economic pests in the flat mite family.Childers, C. C. and J. C. Rodrigues. (2011). An overview of Brevipalpus mites (Acari: Tenuipalpidae) and the plant viruses they transmit. Zoosymposia 6, 180-92. Some Brevipalpus species are made up mostly of female individuals that reproduce via thelytoky, producing offspring without fertilization. Male individuals occur but often become feminized by Cardinium bacteria that colonize their bodies. Between each developmental stage, the juvenile rests as a chrysalis on a plant. Brevipalpus mites damage their host plants by inserting their relatively long mouthparts into the plant tissue and injecting saliva during feeding. The saliva is toxic to the plant. Damage on grapefruit, for example, takes the form of circular, discolored lesions on the fruit which darken as they become necrotic. On pistachio, Brevipalpus damage appears as scabby blotches on the leaf petioles, stems, and nuts. Furthermore, several of these mites are vectors for a variety of serious plant viruses. Familiar species include: *Brevipalpus californicus, a mite known as a vector for the orchid fleck virus, which causes spots and rings on orchid leaves. The mite has a wide range of host plants. It has been known to form galls on bitter orange. *Brevipalpus chilensis, which is native to Chile, but has the potential to invade other regions as an agricultural pest of several crops, including grapes and citrus. *Brevipalpus lewisi, which is known from the Palearctic realm, Australia, and the southwestern United States. It is a pest on pistachio, citrus, pomegranate, walnuts, grapes, and ornamental plants. *Brevipalpus obovatus, which is a pest of many plants, including the ornamentals Hibiscus rosa-sinensis and Brunfelsia uniflora.Miranda, L. C., et al. (2007). Brevipalpus mites Donnadieu (Prostigmata: Tenuipalpidae) associated with ornamental plants in Distrito Federal, Brazil. Neotropical Entomology 36(4), 587-92. *Brevipalpus phoenicis, a pest of the tea plant, especially in Indonesia. It feeds on the leaves and in large numbers can reduce yields. It has also been observed on tangerine. This mite is a vector for Cilevirus, a plant virus that causes the disease citrus leprosis. Manifestations of the disease on a citrus tree include chlorotic lesions, girdling, fruit drop, defoliation, and the death of the tree. Of the major types of citrus, the orange is most vulnerable to the virus. The mite is also a vector of passion fruit green spot virus and coffee ringspot virus, and ringspots of Cestrum and Solanum plants.

The scandal involved 43 female trainees allegedly victimized by their instructors during and after basic military training beginning in 2009. Seventeen male instructors were accused of offenses ranging from the solicitation of improper relationships to rape, and 35 instructors were removed from their posts pending an investigation. Nine of the accused instructors belonged to the 331st Training Squadron, and squadron commander Lt. Col. Mike Paquette was removed from command in June 2012 because of the problems in his unit. In August 2012 Col. Glenn Palmer, commander of the 737th Training Group, was also relieved from his position due to the scandal. Events Investigation of the scandal began in June 2011, when a trainee reported suspected sexual misconduct. In November 2011, three instructors reported possible misconduct after overhearing fellow Military Training Instructors (MTIs) discussing something \\"completely unacceptable\\". In June 2012 Staff Sgt. Peter Vega- Maldonado made a plea deal, admitting an improper relationship and the violation of a no-contact order. Vega-Maldonado was sentenced to ninety days in jail, thirty days of hard labor, and his rank and pay were reduced.Lawrence, C., 31 victims identified in widening Air Force sex scandal, CNN, 2012 He agreed to testify against other accused MTIs in exchange for immunity from prosecution for other related crimes, and it was later learned that Vega-Maldonado had sex with nine other trainees. The second case, which yielded the longest sentence (20 years), proceeded to court martial for Staff Sgt. Luis Walker of the 326th Training Squadron on 28 counts which included rape, aggravated sexual contact and aggravated sexual assault. Ten former trainees testified against Walker in his week-long trial, and he was accused of having sexual intercourse with four recruits. Walker was convicted on all 28 counts, sentenced to 20 years in jail and was required to register as a sex offender. In 2014 (two years after his conviction) Walker was found dead in his cell, an apparent suicide. He was married and had two children. Tech. Sgt. Christopher Smith was charged with an improper relationship with one trainee, seeking an improper, personal and intimate relationship with another trainee and obstruction of justice. The charges stemmed from an incident in spring 2011 when Smith drove two trainees off the base to meet fellow instructor Master Sgt. Jamey Crawford. Smith was convicted and sentenced to 30 days' confinement and a reduction in rank to Airman First Class. Crawford was accused of an improper sexual relationship, providing alcohol to a trainee and adultery. Staff Sgt. Kwinton Estacio was charged with sexual misconduct with a basic-training student, abusing his authority and obstructing justice. Although Estacio faced a maximum sentence of 43 years' confinement, he was sentenced to one year. Staff Sgt. Craig LeBlanc was charged with sexual misconduct, obstructing justice and making a false official statement. He was accused of using his post as military instructor to sexually assault and pursue a sexual relationship with a female trainee, and having a wrongful sexual relationship with another. LeBlanc faced up to 22 years in prison, and was sentenced to two-and-a-half years.

The origins of the family come from a commune of people known as the Sz√©kely people or colloquially as the Gyergy√≥sz√°rhegys which were living in Transylvania within the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. The family was a subgroup of the Hungarian people that marked their roots in the Sz√©kely Land, with the foundation of the village named LƒÉzarea (Gyergy√≥sz√°rhegy) and the Lazar Castle.*Magyarorsz√°g csal√°dai, vol. VII-VIII, Par Iv√°n Nagy, Pest 1857-1868 Coat of arms  History  The first recorded member of the family, was mentioned in a written letter in 1482 when a certain Erzs√©bet B√≠r√≥ of Kide warned a Sz√©kely named L√°z√°r of Zarhegh to beware of disposing of the estate of Kide to which she was entitled under the title of bride price and dower. The royal revenues of the family, were at the top ranks of the lesser groups of Hungarian nobility. Family members, were implicated in many political affairs in the province, and considered ranked far below the great magnates who formed the king's council that exercised real power in the Kingdom. Moreover, the family also held membership in the Order of the Dragon (Latin: Societas Draconistrarum, lit. \\"Society of the Dragonists\\") which was a monarchical chivalric order for selected nobility, founded in 1408 by Sigismund. The family lost its prestige in the year 1707, when the imperial colonel, Akton, set the palace of the Lazars and the adjacent cloister on fire, after ransacking it. This was done out of revenge to the Lazar family, who sympathized with the revolution of R√°k√≥czy Ferenc II. Two years later another fire was set and had destroyed all the remaining building parts. The family then abandoned their possessions and was spread throughout the kingdom. The official coat of arms of the family represents: the castle (fortified wall on top), the orthodox faith (double cross on the left), the order of dragon (dragon), the nobility (crown), the men in the family (sun), the women in the family (moon) and the Hungarian heraldry (star). The Sun and Moon are also the symbols of the Sz√©kely, and are used in the coat of arms of Transylvania and on the Romanian national coat of arms. The Sun and the Moon, the symbols of the cosmic word, are known from Hungarian grave findings from the period of the Hungarian conquest. After the Hungarians became Christians in the 11th century, the importance of these icons became purely visual and symbolic. The Sz√©kelys have succeeded in preserving traditions to an extent unusual even in Central and Eastern Europe.  L√°z√°r Castle  L√°z√°r Castle was built between 1450 and 1532 in several stages. In the late 16th century, Druzsina, daughter of Istvan Lazar married Farkas Bethlen of Ikt√°r, and to this marriage was born the future prince of Transylvania Gabriel Bethlen. He was brought up in the castle and his upstairs room in the gate tower can still be seen unto this day. In 1631, the castle was expanded and altered into a magnificent Renaissance manor house, towers and curtain walls were also built. It became one of the important military and administrative centers of the Sz√©kely Land. On September 6, 1658, a team of Szeklers led by a student named G√°bor Sz√©kely defeated the invading Tatars and Moldovans. The dead were buried on a hill below the village which is called until today Tatarhill. A plaque was put up in 1908 in memory of the battle. The Szekely Land was often hit by Ottoman invasions and on one occasion, the castle was seriously damaged. During the Hungarian war of independence of Ferenc II R√°k√≥czi, Ferenc L√°z√°r supported the operations of the kuruc troops. In 1707, when the imperial army marched into Transylvania, Ferenc Lazar had to flee to Cs√°ng√≥s to Moldova. Imperial general Acton set fire to the castle and only a bastion remained intact. After the Peace of Szatm√°r, Ferenc Lazar pledged allegiance to the Habsburg Emperor and thus was able to keep his estates. When the castle was burned down again in 1748, the family, was not able any more to restore all parts of it, and what was restored was made partly from donations of the villagers. Finally in 1842, it was almost completely destroyed by another fire. In the 19th century, the financial status of the Lazar family started to deteriorate and only the gate tower remained suitable for habitation. After last Lazar heir, Zsigmond and his wife, left the castle in 1853, it fell even further into decay. Nowadays, much of the castle has been renovated. Renovation of the renaissance murals started in 1987 with the help of UNESCO.

Born in the Netherlands, he began a career in film journalism in the Dutch East Indies. A self-taught filmmaker, in the mid-1930s, he released a documentary and two feature films, before immigrating to the United States and resuming his journalistic career. Biography Balink was born in 's-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands. In the 1920s and early 1930s he was a reporter with De Locomotief, a newspaper based in Semarang, Dutch East Indies, and the Soematra Post, based in Medan. He wrote extensively about film while working at these papers. In 1934, Balink established the Java Pacific Film production company with the Wong brothers, headquartered in an old Bandoeng tapioca flour factory. Inexperienced with film, Balink had attained only theoretical knowledge gained from self- instruction. The company's first production was a documentary film, De Merapi Dreigt (Mount Merapi Looms), released in 1934. Advertised as the first documentary film with sound in the Dutch East Indies, it was a critical success. However, Balink's main interest lay in feature films, intending to reach an upper-class audience in contrast to the feature films of The Teng Chun, traditionally based on Chinese mythology or martial arts, and targeted at lower-class audiences, generally ethnic Chinese. The studio, working with director Mannus Franken, then produced Pareh (Rice; 1936), an ethnographic film considered a forerunner to the Indonesia Indah films. Balink had brought Franken to the country to ensure the film's quality. As well as writing the screenplay, Franken co-directed and co-produced the film with Balink, who worked to secure funding from various sponsors and was in charge of casting, searching the country extensively for appropriate actors. Ultimately the film was a flop and bankrupted the company, including Balink, having cost 75,000 gulden to produce. Despite this, it was well received in the Netherlands. Balink established renewed financial backing to found the Dutch Indies Film Syndicate (, or ANIF), which produced its first newsreel on 22 December 1936, featuring the Gambir Market, and festivities at the palace of the Governor- General, including the inauguration of the last Dutch East Indies Governor- General, Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer. In 1937, Balink directed Terang Boelan (Full Moon), described as the first full-length Indonesian film in Malay. The story, following a young couple who have not received their parents' blessings, was written by the reporter Saeroen. Terang Boelan proved to be the most commercially successful Indonesian production until the 1953 film, Krisis (Crisis), released after the country's independence. Despite his success, the studio's backers disapproved of Balink's interest in feature films. He left the country for the United States, attempting a career as a Hollywood director, which was unsuccessful. Reviewing early Indonesian cinema, in 1991 the American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider wrote that Pareh and Terang Boelan were the two most important cinematic works from the Dutch East Indies during the 1930s. In March 1938 Balink immigrated to the United States, became a citizen, and worked as a correspondent for Dutch daily newspaper, de Volkskrant. The 1940 United States Census indicates that he was living in Queens, New York, with his wife, Lydia. From New Jersey and twelve years his junior, Lydia worked with Balink as his secretary. In 1948, he published a socioeconomic study of the Caribbean, My Paradise is Hell. In the 1950s he founded and edited a magazine, The Knickerbocker, a publication aimed at Dutch Americans. The magazine was instrumental in allowing Dutch baseball player, Han Urbanus to train with the New York Giants. Urbanus used this experience to further develop baseball in the Netherlands. Also in the 1950s, Balink chaired the committee for the William the Silent Award for Journalism. In early 1953 he served as executive of Holland Flood Relief Inc., which helped coordinate relief efforts during the North Sea flood of 1953. Balink was an active amateur tennis player. Albert Balink died in Pensacola, Florida, on 8 February 1976.

The adults eat young plant shoots for the nutrient solution within, which retards bud growth and causes yellow-green bud curling. The leaf margins turn brown and eventually fall off. Use in tea production Jacobiasca formosana is important in the production of Taiwan's dongfang meiren tea. The tea, which is an oolong tea with a flavor likened to ripened fruit and honey, is made from leaves partially eaten by these insects. The insects, which thrive in warmer, pollution-free environments, suck the phloem juices of the tea stems, leaves, and buds, producing monoterpene diol and hotrienol which give the tea its unique flavor. This process has inspired makers of other types of tea such as dongding oolong tea and the east coast black teas of Hualien and Taitung to withhold pesticide use in order to replicate this process in other teas.Stephane Erler. \\"A Study of Oriental Beauty\\".

As an admiral, he was commander of the Free French naval forces in the Pacific and the Mediterranean during the Second World War. He was awarded the Ordre de la Lib√©ration for his service to the country.http://www.ordredelaliberation.fr/fr_compagnon/41.html Life =Pre-war= Auboyneau was born in Constantinople, where his father was director of the Ottoman Bank. He entered the √âcole navale in 1917 at age 17. From March to November 1918 he took part in patrols along the English Channel as an ensign on board the torpedo boat Typhon. He then served in the Middle East and the Far East for ten years, commanding the hydrographic vessel Alidade, then the gunboat Doudart de Lagr√©e on the Yangtze. After some time in France in the Naval Ministry, he entered the √âcole de guerre navale, leaving it as deputy chief of staff for France's Atlantic torpedo-boat fleet. As a captain, he was then made deputy chief of staff to France's Far East naval forces at Saigon, where he found himself on the declaration of war in 1939. He was then charged with several liaison missions to the Royal Navy. = Second World War = At the time of the Armistice, he was a liaison officer on board HMS Warspite and played an important role in the delicate negotiations between Admiral Andrew Cunningham and Admiral Ren√©-√âmile Godfroy for the fate of the Force X, becoming the main architect of compromise signed between the two admirals, which decided on the status of the French squadron in Alexandria. He then traveled to London to join the forces of Free France, arriving on 20 July 1940. He was sent to command the , which he re-armed. After several missions in the Atlantic, he was promoted to capitaine de vaisseau and made commander of Free France's naval forces in the Pacific, with his flag on Triomphant. He was in Australia at the time of Japan's entry into the war and took part in several operations in the South Pacific with the Australian fleet, most notably a raid near a Japanese naval base to evacuate the garrisons of the Nauru Island and Ocean Island. Returning to London in April 1942, he was made commander of all Free France's naval forces and national commissioner for the navy. He inspected French naval units in Equatorial Africa, the Levant, Madagascar and Djibouti. At the start of the campaign in North Africa, he was made chief of the naval staff, then major general within General Henri Giraud's supreme civil and military command. This made him one of the main architects of the merger of Free France's naval forces and Vichy France's North African fleet. He then left that role to command the 3rd Cruiser Division, heading it for Operation Dragoon in August 1944. In 1945, he became a vice admiral and was put in command of France's naval forces in the Far East, where he transported and supported General Leclerc's troops in South Annam and led the landings at Tonkin. =Post-war= He was a member of the superior counsel for national defence and a member of the superior counsel for the Navy. He was then made inspector general of naval forces and naval aviation. From 1952 to 1955, he commanded France's naval forces in the Far East and from 1955 to 1960 its naval forces in Algeria. Auboyneau's chauffeur Vincent Fusco saved him from an assassination attempt on rue Dupuch in Algiers in 1957. Auboyneau was one of those who on 13 May 1958 led to Charles de Gaulle's return during the May 1958 crisis. In 1960, he joined the Conseil d‚Äô√âtat as an extraordinary counsellor.

Due to Sri Lanka's close proximity to Southern India, Dravidian influence on Sri Lanka has been very active since the early iron age or megalithic period.Indrapala, K. (2005). The Evolution of an Ethnic Identity - The Tamils of Sri Lanka 300 B.C.E to 1200 C.E. . During the protohistoric period (1000-500 B.C.) Sri Lanka was culturally united with southern India, and shared the same megalithic burials, pottery, iron technology, farming techniques and megalithic graffiti. This cultural complex spread from southern India along with Dravidian clans such as the Velir, prior to the migration of Prakrit speakers.Robin Conningham - Anuradhapura - The British-Sri Lankan Excavations at Anuradhapura Salgaha Watta Volumes 1 and 2 (1999/2006)Sudharshan Seneviratne (1989) - Pre-State Chieftains And Servants of the State: A Case Study of Parumaka -http://dlib.pdn.ac.lk/handle/123456789/2078 Once Prakrit speakers had attained dominance on the island, the Mahavamsa further recounts the later migration of royal brides and service castes from the Tamil Pandya Kingdom to the Anuradhapura Kingdom in the early historic period. Trade relations between the Anuradhapura Kingdom and southern India existed, very probably from an early time. Very early in its recorded history Sri Lanka has seen groups of Southern Indians enter the island as traders, mercenaries and occasionally as invaders, but their significance to the wider Prakrit speaking demographics of the island was only peripheral in these stages. From the third century BC Dravidian intrusions into the affairs of Sri Lanka became more pronounced. These attempts at usurping power of the Anuradhapura Kingdom appears to have been at least motivated by the prospect of influencing its external trade. From about the fifth century AD onwards, Tamil mercenaries were brought to the island, this became more common from the seventh century. It is from the 10th century that more permanent settlements of Middle Tamil speakers begin in Sri Lanka. These were not extensive settlements, but they would be important in the fact that they formed the nucleus for later settlements in Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka. Following the invasion of Kalinga Magha in 1215 AD, and the subsequent establishment of the Jaffna Kingdom and Vannimai chieftaincies in the east, Tamil settlements became widespread in these regions.Indrapala, K. (1965). Dravidian settlements in Ceylon and the beginnings of the kingdom of Jaffna. During the Crisis of the Sixteenth Century up until the end of the British colonial period many Southern Indian and Tamil speaking groups were transported or migrated to Sri Lanka. Today the two major Tamil communities are the Sri Lankan Tamils, who have settled in Sri Lanka for many centuries, and the more recent Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka, who were brought as indentured labourers by the British during the colonial period. History =Anuradhapura period= Sri Lankan monarchs have intermarried with south Indian royalty and used the services of South Indian labor for millennia. According to the Mahavamsa, noblewomen and service groups from the Pandyan kingdom accompanied the settlement of Anuradhapura by Prakrit speakers. Epigraphic evidence describes traders and others self identifying as Damelas or Damedas (Sinhala and Sinhala prakrit for Tamils) in Anuradhapura and other areas of Sri Lanka as early as 2nd century BCE. The idea of looking upon the Damelas as aliens was not prevalent in the early historical period. Tamil mercenaries were brought to Anuradhapura by the Sinhalese rulers from the 5th century, and in ever larger numbers during the 7th-10th centuries CE. In the early stages they were brought for short periods and served political purposes, fighting on behalf of rulers whose positions were insecure or those who had aspirations of taking the throne. =Polonnaruwa period= Rajaraja I created a town called Jananathamangalam (present day Polonnaruwa), near Anuradhapura and settled Velakkara (Maravar) and Agampadi (Agampu+adi) soldiers (Agammudayar), These two Castes were subdivisions of the Tamil Mukkulathor caste). They eventually assimilated to Sinhalese society. The Sinhalese family name Palihakkara (Palaikkarar) originated from the Velakkara soldiers and the suffix Agampadi in front of some names of the Salagama sub caste \\"Hewapanne\\"(militia) originated from the Agampadi soldiers, who married Salagama Hewapanne women, Large scale mercantile activity from peninsular India primarily came from the Coromandel Coast. =Transitional period= The majority Sinhalese caste structure, which has no religious sanctions attached to it, has accommodated recent Dravidian Hindu immigrants from South India leading to the emergence of three new Sinhalese caste groups-the Salagama, the Durava and the Karava. This migration and assimilation happened until the eighteenth century. Salagamas, whose caste legends allude to South India, came as weavers from Kerala. Many also worked as mercenary soldiers (Agampadi soldiers). Agampadi soldiers (mercenaries who were deployed in the army and as coast guards from Dambeniya rule onwards) came from Tamil Nadu. Some were punished by the King of Kotte, who imposed a tax on cinnamon. Eventually some became cinnamon peelers. According to some historians this was begun in 1406 by the King of Kotte. Another section is called \\"Hewapanne\\" or soldiers. =Crisis of the Sixteenth Century= During the period of the Crisis of the Sixteenth Century and the arrival of the Portuguese to Sri Lanka also saw the migration of various Southern Indian and Tamil speaking groups. The Bharatha people are descendants of Tamil speaking Paravar of Southern India who migrated to Sri Lanka under Portuguese rule during that time. Several hundreds of converted Christian Bharathas were brought from the Indian mainland to the western shores of Sri Lanka by the Portuguese to wrest control on the pearl trade. Sri Lankan Chetties, Formerly considered a Sri Lankan Tamil caste, were also a class of Tamil speaking traders, who migrated from South India under Portuguese rule, and continued to during Dutch presence on the island. They settled mostly in western Sri Lanka, especially in the ports of Colombo and Galle from the 16th century to mid 17th century. Some of the Chetties in Northern Sri Lanka were absorbed into other communities, mainly in the Sri Lankan Vellalar community, considered a subcaste known as Chetty Vellalar. The Chetties of Western Sri Lanka converted to Roman Catholicism under Portuguese rule while others converted to Anglicanism or Protestantism under Dutch rule and British rule. Intermarriage and alliances between Sinhalese and Chetties were not uncommon thus many also got Sinhalised. =British Ceylon period= Like the Portuguese and Dutch, the British colonial period saw the transportation and migration of Tamils to Sri Lanka, but on a much larger scale. Indian Tamils were brought to Sri Lanka as indentured labourers during the 19th and 20th centuries to work on coffee, tea and rubber plantations owned by the British. Workers were recruited from around the Tamil Nadu cities of Tirunelveli, Tiruchirappalli, Madurai and Thanjavur in 1827 by Governor Edward Barnes on the request of George Bird, a pioneering planter. Many died during their first few months of employment. They were instrumental in the establishment of tea, rubber, coffee and coconut plantations and formed the bulk of the labour force of the plantation sector. These Indian Tamils were separate from an already existing trading community of Indian Tamils who were not part of the plantation economy. Indian Tamils had been lumped together with Sri Lankan Tamils for the Sri Lankan Census from 1871 to 1901. Since 1911, Indian Tamils have been shown as a separate group, and revealed Indian Tamils constituting 12.9% of the total population, whereas Sri Lankan Tamils, who had lived in the country for centuries prior had a lesser population of 12.8%. Indian Tamils had formed the majority Tamil population in the country until the 1950s and 1960s when the Indian population was repatriated back to India. Many Indian Tamils, after acquiring Sri Lankan citizenship, also declared themselves as Sri Lankan Tamils. Indian Moors were a grouping of people during the colonial period distinguished by their Muslim faith and whose origins traced back to the British Raj. Therefore, Indian Moors refer to a number of ethnic groups such as Memons, Bohra and Khoja. These groups tended to retain their own ancestral practices and language. However the largest specific group were Tamils from South India. Indian Moors shared a similar history to Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka, however due to their decline and smaller numbers the Indian Moors have either returned to India or have declared themselves as being classified as Sri Lankan Moors.

Together with his mother and younger sister, Slavica, young ƒêorƒëe lived in Inƒëija until 1964. Then family moved to Belgrade, settling in the Vo≈ædovac neighbourhood. His arrival to Vo≈ædovac at age eight shaped the rest of ƒêorƒëe's life. Growing up in a neighbourhood full of poor working-class families like his own, he often found himself a target of taunting and bullying by older kids. He fought back, earning respect and street credibility. He became lifelong friends with Branislav \\"Beli\\" Matiƒá who got him into boxing at Radniƒçki boxing club. Proficient at street fighting, preteen ƒêorƒëe already had run-ins with the police. Growing up, his nickname around the neighbourhood was Debeli (Fatso) due to his chubby frame. He got his famous nickname Gi≈°ka apparently due to resemblance to a bear of the same name at the Belgrade Zoo. At age thirteen, he illegally crossed the border into Italy just to show that he can circumvent SFR Yugoslavia's strict exit rules. Upon coming back, he befriended Boris Petkov a.k.a \\"Bugarin (The Bulgarian)\\" and Ranko Rube≈æiƒá. Together with Beli, the foursome formed a basis for the mafia clan originating in the neighbourhood. Criminal career Gi≈°ka had close ties to the Serbian mafia (he was friends with Ljubomir Maga≈°, whose respect he earned when he crossed illegally to Italy for the second time when he was 17 years old, to match Maga≈° in a fist fight) and Montenegrin mafia in his youth where he reached the rank of Boss. Gi≈°ka's relationship with other prominent members of the Belgrade underworld was marked by alternating periods of close friendship and vicious feuding, often with deadly consequences. In the late 1980s, together with gangster ≈Ωeljko \\"Arkan\\" Ra≈ænatoviƒá and painter Dragan \\"Tapi\\" Male≈°eviƒá, Gi≈°ka ran a nightclub called Amadeus located in the Belgrade neighbourhood of Ta≈°majdan. According to security operative Bo≈æa Spasiƒá, they were allowed to open the club with the blessing of Yugoslav State Security (UDBA) as a reward of sorts for Gi≈°ka's and Arkan's service to UDBA over the years. However, after discovering that in addition to regular activities the club was also being used for drug running, UDBA shut it down.ORGANIZOVNI KRIMINAL I DR≈ΩAVA (3) Kriminalci u obraƒçunu sa politiƒçkim emigrantima i ≈°pijunima;Blic, 28 November 2003.

He was often marked as the Mastermind behind the ƒêurekoviƒá operation, although these rumors were never confirmed. One of his famous actions involves planting a remotely controlled exploding phone at the door of the certain Albanian emigree in Switzerland as the warning sign. Bo≈æoviƒá apparently had a change of heart in 1986, when he was sent to Australia to assassinate Momƒçilo ƒêujiƒá, a controversial WWII military leader and an influential figure among the Serbian emigration.

Gi≈°ka often acted as a negotiator, settling feuds between his own and other gangs. He held passionate speeches at gangsters' funerals, warning them that a bloody war in Yugoslavia is coming and that they have to stick together. He became highly involved in politics, admiring the then informal leader of the opposition Vuk Dra≈°koviƒá. Bo≈æoviƒá, with his gang, actively participated in the 1991 riots in Belgrade. He is widely remembered for preventing the crowd to enter People's Republic Assembly saying, 'We will not allow for the loss of any Serb life'.

State Security obstructed it from the very beginning, preventing its financing and pressuring its members to join the rival state-controlled Tigers. The Tigers were led by Arkan, with whom Gi≈°ka parted in the mid '80s. Mutual friend, Serbian rock star Bora ƒåorba, in an interview in 2013 stated that he tried to consolidate the two, claiming Arkan was willing to do so, while Gi≈°ka refused.

On July 21, Manuel Diaz was shot and killed by Anaheim Police officer Nick Bennallack after he ran from the officers. Protests ensued after the shooting. On July 22, Joel Acevedo was shot and killed by Anaheim police in an alleged exchange of gunfire, making the seventh fatal officer-involved shooting in Anaheim in twelve months. Both shootings were ruled justified by the Orange County District Attorney's Office, but a federal jury later ruled Officer Bennallack guilty of excessive force. First shooting On July 21, 2012, 25-year-old Manuel Diaz was shot and killed by Anaheim Police officer Nick Bennallack in Anaheim, California. According to police officials, officers were responding to a call about men congregating in an alley when they saw Diaz leaning into a car speaking to the driver. When approached, Diaz ran. The police pursued and shot him in front of a nearby apartment complex. Police stated that Diaz was known to be a gang member \\\\- but not known to Bennallack - and claimed at one point to have seen him throw an object onto a roof. The police's story changed over time, and no item was ever found. Eventually, Diaz was transported to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead around 7:00 p.m., about three hours after the shooting occurred. Protests and second shooting After the shooting, a crowd of local residents gathered around the crime scene. According to the police, the crowd began to throw objects at the police officers. Police then fired non-lethal munitions at the crowd. At one point, a police dog attacked several individuals. Junior Lagunas, 19, suffered puncture wounds from the police dog attack. The Anaheim police chief stated that the dog accidentally got free from a police car and apologized for the attack.http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2012/07/22/protest- erupts-after-anaheim-shooting/ Witnesses at the scene told a local journalist that the police were offering to buy cell phone videos. Further protests occurred in Anaheim, including protests at the police station and in the neighborhood where the shooting occurred. The protests escalated the next day after police shot and killed another man, Joel Acevedo, during another foot chase, this one in the Guinida neighborhood of Anaheim. Officer Kelly Phillips, who killed Acevedo (and was previously one of the shooters of Caesar Cruz in 2009) claimed that Acevedo was shooting at him first, but Acevedo's family and witnesses claim he was unarmed and had a gun planted on him. On July 29, two hundred protesters walked from the Anaheim police headquarters toward Disneyland. They were stopped at the intersection of Harbor Boulevard and Ball Road by a line of riot police and officers on horseback.Christopher Hawthorne, \\"On Harbor Boulevard, a pretense of business as usual\\", Los Angeles Times, November 24, 2012. Two reporters from The Orange County Register were injured ‚Äî one was hit in the head with a rock, and the other was hit in the foot with a projectile. Background Weekly protests outside the Anaheim Police Department had been occurring since early 2010, led by Placentia resident Theresa Smith. Smith's 35-year-old son, Caesar Cruz, was shot fatally by five Anaheim policemen on December 9, 2009. The number of participants in Smith's protests was typically small until early 2012, when she was joined by Orange County residents who had been protesting in Fullerton after the 2011 killing of Kelly Thomas, a 37-year-old homeless schizophrenic who was fatally beaten and suffocated by Fullerton policemen Manuel Ramos, Jay Cicinelli, and Joseph Wolfe. After the March 2012 fatal shooting of Martin Hernandez, Hernandez' friends and family also joined in the weekly Anaheim protests. Tony Rackauckas, the district attorney for Fullerton, confirmed in an interview for PBS that during his term in office no police officers had been prosecuted for any of the shooting deaths that they were involved in. The fatal shooting of Joel Acevedo on Sunday night, July 22, 2012, was the seventh fatal officer- involved shooting in twelve months by the Anaheim Police Department. First, on August 16, 2011, fleeing unarmed David Raya was shot fatally, also in the Guinida neighborhood, by police investigator Bruce Linn, who was also one of the shooters of Caesar Cruz in 2009. Second, on November 4, 2011, fleeing Marcel Ceja was shot fatally on Ball Road by Officer David Garcia; Garcia claimed that Ceja had \\"ditched a pistol.\\" Third, on January 7, 2012, Bernie \\"Chino\\" Villegas was shot fatally in the back as he sat in his parking lot shooting bottles with a B-B gun, by Officer Nick Bennallack, who would go on be charged with excessive force for killing Manuel Diaz six months later. Fourth, on January 19, 2012, Roscoe Cambridge approached Sergeant Michael Bustamante while carrying a knife and a Bible, as Bustamante sat in his parked police car at the Anaheim Hills APD East Substation; Bustamante shot Cambridge fatally. Bustamante later left the police force. Fifth, on March 6, 2012, Martin Hernandez was shot fatally by APD Officer Dan Hurtado after a pursuit in the Ponderosa neighborhood. This fifth fatal shooting in seven months led to 100 residents of the Ponderosa community confronting Police Chief John Welter. Anaheim Mayor Tom Tait, City Council members Lorri Galloway and Kris Murray were in attendance as residents complained angrily of police harassment and intimidation in their neighborhood. The killings of Manuel Diaz and Joel Acevedo on July 21 and 22 were the sixth and seventh fatal APD shootings in a twelve-month period. On July 24, Anaheim Mayor Tom Tait announced that he had arranged for the U.S. Attorney's Office to review the shootings, and that he would meet with representatives from that office, as well as with FBI agents, on Friday, July 27. Also on July 24, peaceful protests were led by Anaheim residents at Anaheim city hall at 4pm. By 6pm, the crowd started becoming unruly and Anaheim police called for riot gear and backup from surrounding cities. Many residents and police cite people from outside the city who turned the protest into a riot later in the day. Rioters were seen breaking windows of local businesses. Although there were no reports of major violence, some property damage was reported. Fifty to a hundred protesters roamed the streets, throwing rocks and bottles, causing damage to over twenty businesses, as well as the police headquarters and City Hall. A Starbucks store was attacked late in the night by a group of young men who used metal chairs and skateboards to break the windows. The mayor of Anaheim called for outside investigations of the shooting by state and federal agencies, and the two officers involved in the shooting of Diaz were placed on paid leave. According to the Diaz family lawyer, they have not been arrested. After Acevedo was shot by Anaheim police the day after the Diaz shooting, the city's police chief, John Welter, stated that he was \\"very concerned\\" about both the number of fatal shootings by Anaheim officers during the previous year and the controversy these shootings had caused. Aftermath On March 21, 2013, Rackauckas' office announced no charges would be filed against Bennallack in Diaz' death. On July 16, 2013, Rackauckas' office announced no charges would be filed against Phillips in Acevedo's death. On March 6, 2014, a federal civil jury found the officers that killed Diaz not guilty of excessive force. On August 24, 2016, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overruled the 2014 decision, finding that the court had allowed the City of Anaheim irrelevant negative information, unknown to Bennallack at the time of the shooting, about Diaz, and ordered a new trial. The City of Anaheim appealed to the Supreme Court. On May 2, 2017, the United States Supreme Court, in a decision with wide ramifications in all such future trials, let the Ninth Circuit's decision stand, and a new civil rights trial was scheduled for October. And on November 2, 2017, a new federal jury determined that Bennallack did indeed use excessive force in killing Diaz, and awarded his mother $200,000 plus legal fees. Bennallack however remains on the Anaheim Police Force.

A lookout tree is a simple fire lookout tower created by attaching a ladder or a series of spikes to a tall straight tree with a view of the surrounding lands, allowing rangers or fire crews to conveniently climb the tree to survey their surroundings. The simplest kind consist only of a ladder to a suitable height: this kind was called a \\"ladder tree.\\" Some ladder trees had platforms on the ground next to them for maps and a fire finder. A more elaborate version often created a platform on top of the tree trunk by cutting off approximately the last of the treetop and building a railed wooden platform on the resulting stump. These \\"platform trees\\" were often equipped with telephones, fire finder tables, seats and guy wires. Accommodation for the watcher was provided by a tent or shelter at the bottom of the tree. Lookout trees were widely used in the Kaibab National Forest of northern Arizona, and Washington, USA as well as in Australia. The Dave Evans Bicentennial Tree in Western Australia reaches 75m, while the tallest lookout in the United States was the Cook Creek Spar Tree near Lake Quinault, Washington, USA, at high from 1927 to 1955. Australia Eight karri trees were adapted as lookout trees in Western Australia in the 1930s and 1940s. The Gloucester Tree features a cabin in its top and may be climbed by visitors, as can the even taller Dave Evans Bicentennial Tree. The Diamond Tree continues in occasional use as a fire lookout. United States Lookout trees were used as ad hoc towers throughout the American West in the early 20th century. The most significant concentrations were in northern Arizona and the Coast Range of Washington and Oregon. =Arizona= Many of the surviving lookout trees in Arizona have been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Lookout trees in Kaibab National Forest were used from about 1916 until the 1960s. Some of the early trees were replaced by towers built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. =Arkansas= The Look See Tree in Coleman, Arkansas was used as a fire lookout for roughly ten to fifteen years from c. 1930 to c. 1940. =Washington= Although the Cook Creek Spar Tree was cut down in 1955 due to rot, another lookout tree remains, constructed in 1918 near Darrington, Washington.

The HRP is an applied research and technology program that investigates and mitigates risks to astronaut health and performance in support of exploration missions and provides countermeasures and technologies for human space exploration. Goals The goal of the HRP is to provide human health and performance countermeasures, knowledge, technologies and tools to enable safe, reliable and productive human space exploration. The Human Research Program also aims to educate the public on the challenges of human space flight. Human Research Roadmap The Human Research Roadmap (HRR) is a web-based tool that is used to communicate the content of the Integrated Research Plan (IRP). The IRP is utilized to identify the approach and research activities planned to address risks to human health and performance in space which are assigned to specific Elements within the program. With this tool, users can search for items as gaps associated with a risk, the tasks associated with a given gap, the cross-integration of a task across multiple gaps or risks and deliverables associated with a gap or risk. =Evidence= Reviews of the accumulated evidence from medical records, space flight operations and research findings are compiled into Evidence Reports. This evidence provides the basis for identifying the highest priority human risks in space exploration, which comprise the risk portfolio within the HRP. It also provides the basis for identifying gaps and tasks in the research plan. =Risks= Risks include physiological effects of radiation, low gravity, terrestrial environments as well as unique challenges in medical support, human factors and behavioral health support. Risks are identified in the Program Requirements Document (PRD) and assigned to an Element within HRP to quantify, mitigate or monitor. A current list of risks being evaluated can be found at the Human Health and Performance in Space portal as well as at the HRR website. =Gaps= For each risk, the HRP Element identifies gaps in knowledge about the risk and the ability to mitigate the risk. The degree of uncertainty in understanding the likelihood, consequence and/or time-frame of a particular risk are the major factors that drive the gaps. Knowledge or mitigation gaps often appear in multiple risks, and many of the specific research tasks address multiple gaps. =Tasks= Tasks partially or completely close a gap by better defining a risk or developing mitigation strategies to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. In some cases, a task can address multiple gaps across multiple risks. =Deliverables= Each task culminates in a deliverable or other agreed upon end-product such as recommended standards, flight rules, processes, countermeasures and new technology.

Located near the small city of Jordan Valley in Malheur County, it is about west of Oregon's border with Idaho. Although the lake is formed by a dam across Jack Creek, most of the water enters the reservoir via the Antelope Feeder Canal. It diverts water to the reservoir from nearby Jordan Creek at a point near the Idaho border. Jack Creek, which carries minor outflows from the reservoir, empties into Jordan Creek further downstream. History The lake was originally formed by a high dam, built in 1913-14, on Jack Creek. At that time, the water in the reservoir came from intermittent surface streams. The dam, managed by the Jordan Valley Irrigation District, was raised to in 1933, and in addition to the intermittent flows the higher dam impounds water from Jordan Creek. The water is used to irrigate about of farmland downstream of the lake. Recreation The Bureau of Land Management, which administers much of the grazing land in the Antelope Reservoir basin, maintains a public campground and boat ramp at the lake. Anglers can fish for stocked trout, and wild Columbia River redband trout from Jordan Creek sometimes enter the reservoir. However, the Oregon Health Authority has issued warnings about very high levels of methylmercury contamination that makes fish caught from the lake dangerous to eat. The contamination stems from past mining activity along the headwaters of Jordan Creek, near Silver City, Idaho, where large quantities of mercury were used to separate gold and silver from other materials.

He also met the Governor's daughter, Elizabeth, who married Lord Augustus in March 1734. Despite being married, he was still apparently of a \\"very amorous disposition\\", as his biographer, John Charnock wrote. He had earlier contracted a marriage at the age of 17, which his father, the Duke, had refused to recognize. Acknowledging him as a \\"brave and gallant young man\\", Charnock nonetheless admitted that FitzRoy had apparently told his wife \\"the night before he left her to go to sea that he had received with much transport a letter\\" from Sir William Morice's wife \\"that she would lie with him the following night and go to sea with him\\". This the couple apparently did, as they were discovered in flagrante delicto at an inn on the road to the harbour where FitzRoy's ship was anchored. Lady Morice was apprehended but escaped to France, while Sir William sued FitzRoy, obtaining ¬£5,000 in damages and a divorce. FitzRoy's father, the Duke, shocked by his son's actions, promised his daughter-in-law \\"that he would be kind to her and never let her want while he lived.\\" FitzRoy's first command was the 40-gun fifth-rate .British Warships in the Age of Sail 1714‚Äì1792, Rif Winfield, as quoted in http://threedecks.org/index.php?display_type=show_ship&id;=4082 He was appointed captain of the Eltham on 2 November 1736, and held this command until November 1739. Eltham was a part of George Clinton's squadron in the Mediterranean as part of the buildup of forces during the War of Jenkins' Ear. Due to increased hostilities, Nicholas Haddock was appointed Commander-in- Chief of the Mediterranean squadron, reinforcing it with more ships. Lord Augustus FitzRoy was, in September 1739, sent by Haddock to > reconnoitre Carthagena and Barcelona the latter being the port at which any > troops destined for the enterprise would collect as they had on previous > occasions with orders to bring back a report as to the possibility of > executing an attack upon either the squadron or the shipping by means of > fireships and bomb-vessels. Lord Augustus, who returned in the middle of > October, reported that the enterprise was impracticable in view of the > strong defences of the harbours.The Navy in the War of 1739‚Äì48, H. W. > Richmond, Cambridge University Press, 1920 Political life FitzRoy became Member of Parliament for Thetford on 10 February 1739 in a by-election. The constituency was one of those largely controlled by his father. His naval duties sometimes kept him away from parliament, such as during the division on the Spanish convention in March 1739, but voted with the Government against the place bill in January 1740. Command of Orford In October/November 1739, Lord Augustus FitzRoy was appointed captain of the 70-gun third-rate . On 26 October 1740, a fleet of some 30 ships sailed from England under Admiral Sir Chaloner Ogle to support Admiral Edward Vernon in the West Indies against Spain. HMS Orford, commanded by Captain Lord Augustus FitzRoy, was a part of this fleet. There were three notable incidents on this journey and subsequent patrols involving FitzRoy: the capture of a French prize, the attack on a French convoy, and the capture of the Spanish warship . On the first instance \\"On Saturday the 8th [November], the Orford gave chase to a vessel plying to the eastward, and brought her into the fleet under French colours.\\" The second > ...the admiral proceeded on his voyage, with fair weather ... till the > afternoon of Wednesday, January the 7th, when they descried five large ships > towards the shore. The admiral immediately made signal for the Orford, the > Prince Frederick, the Weymouth, the Dunkirk, and the York, to give chase, > while he and the fleet continued their course for Jamaica. They accordingly > came up with the five ships, which were French men of war; and Lord Augustus > FitzRoy, who commanded the Orford, ordered their commodore to hoist out his > boat and come aboard. This order the French captain refusing to obey, his > lordship gave him a broadside, and a very obstinate engagement ensued. The engagement ended in the morning, when the English pretended they had mistaken the French for Spanish. Both forces sailed on their way. The third incident involving Fitzroy was the capture of the Spanish ship, Princesa. =Capture of Princesa= On 18 April 1740, Orford, and were sailing off the coast of Cape Finisterre. They encountered the Spanish ship Princesa. The three English ships were all 70-gun third-rate ships of the line, and the Princesa was a 74-gun third rate, but according to the sources, only carried 64 guns. Princesa was very strongly built and withstood much of the attack for several hours. After about five or six hours, and considerable damage, the Spanish commander, Don Parlo Augustino de Gera, surrendered. As Orford was the closest English ship, FitzRoy was the first captain to reach the prize, and so accepted the surrender. This caused some consternation, particularly with Mayne, the commander of Lenox, as Lenox had been heavily involved in the fighting.The Royal Navy: a history from the earliest times to the present, Vol III, by Wiliam Laid Clowes, as quoted in http://threedecks.org/index.php?display_type=show_battle&id;=342The Naval History of Great Britain, Book VI, Chap II, p.115, by Frederic Hervey, as quoted in The Navy in the War of 1739‚Äì48, H. W. Richmond, Cambridge University Press, 1920, page 78 \\"The prize, rated as a 70, continued for some years as one of the best two-deckers in the British Navy\\" =Siege of Cartagena= Orford, under FitzRoy, sailed to Cartagena as part of the fleet under Admiral Vernon. Orford had only a minor recorded role, in helping blockade the inner harbour of Surgidero. FitzRoy wrote a letter to the Duke of Richmond, dated 25 April 1741, regarding the failed attack on Fort San Lazare. Marriage and family Captain Lord Augustus FitzRoy met Elizabeth Cosby in 1733, when he visited New York. Her father, William Cosby, was the Governor of New York, and had welcomed Augustus to the city. They were married in March 1734. They had two children: * Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton (28 September 1735 ‚Äì 14 March 1811) * Lt.-Gen. Charles FitzRoy, 1st Baron Southampton (25 June 1737 ‚Äì 21 March 1797) Death Lord Augustus FitzRoy, like many officers serving in the West Indies at the time, suffered from the tropical fevers and diseases brought on by the poor living conditions and low health standards. The much- reduced fleet returned from Cartagena to Jamaica on 19 May 1741, and FitzRoy died several days later, on 24 May 1741.Modern History, Or The Present State of All Nations by Thomas Salmon (1755), Volume II, page 765 Notes References * 1716 births 1741 deaths Royal Navy officers Augustus Younger sons of dukes Royal Navy personnel of the War of the Austrian Succession British MPs 1734‚Äì1741 Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies People educated at Eton College Parents of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom ","title":"Lord Augustus FitzRoy"},{"id":"36529154","title":"Miss Willie Brown"},{"id":"36529173","text":"The 2010 Penn Quakers football team represented the University of Pennsylvania in the 2010 NCAA Division I FCS football season.

Modern view of Smithfield, now the Fredericksburg Country Club Smithfield Plantation is a former historic plantation house and estate in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, four miles south of the city of Fredericksburg, that is now a country club. Early history That bit of land that is now the Fredericksburg Country Club is rich in both history and people. Prior to the arrival of the first white settlers, Native Americans of the Algonquin tribes hunted and fished on the grounds and waters bounding the Club property. In 1671, Charles II of England granted about 5,000 acres to a Major Lawrence Smith of Gloucester County, Virginia. In 1676, the early settlers built a fort in the vicinity of the club's 10th tee, to protect themselves from these same Indians. After an abortive effort to establish a settlement here, Smith broke the grant into parcels, one of which was sold in 1730 to Francis Taliaferro. In the mid-eighteenth century the property was inherited by a relative in the then prominent Brooke family, who built a home thereon and named it Smithfield in honor of the original owner of the land. Richard Brooke raised four sons who all fought in the War of Independence and later gained prominence in the new nation. Laurence Brooke, the eldest, sailed with our nation's first naval hero, John Paul Jones. Captain Jones, a citizen of Fredericksburg, appointed Laurence surgeon of the Bon Homme Richard and both participated in the famous engagement with the Serapis. After the Revolution Laurence became one of the most respected doctors of our new nation. Robert Brooke, the second son, was captured by the British and sent to England by Lord Howe. He escaped via Scotland and France, returned to Virginia, joined a volunteer troop of cavalry and was captured again at Westham, seven miles above Richmond. In 1794 Robert was elected Governor of Virginia, and later served as Attorney General for the state. Francis and John Brooke were twins and the youngest of the family. Both served as officers at the age of sixteen for Generals Lafayette, Harrison and Spotswood. John later served in the House of Delegates from Stafford for many years. Francis served in the House of Delegates until he became a Judge in 1804 and served until 1849. The Smithfield property was purchased by John Pratt of Caroline County in 1814. Shortly thereafter, the original dwelling burned down, and by 1822 the present mansion house was built.  The Battle of Fredericksburg  In December 1862, Union troops crossed the Rappahannock near what is now the Spotsylvania County Industrial Park, and marched down the Richmond Stage Road (now State Route 2) toward what is now the Country Club. From here, they were to make a right flank movement, and attack the Confederate forces on the high ground about a mile to the west of the Club. A young Alabamian, Major John Pelham, CSA, in a daring and unorthodox move, brought a battery of artillery down from Hamilton's Crossing to a point near the intersection of what is now Tidewater Trail and Benchmark Road, just south of the clubhouse. The National Park Service has a marker in this location. From here he fired on the Union troops, resisting efforts of his senior officers to withdraw until his casualties were such that the battery was no longer effective. During this same December, the present clubhouse became a Union hospital. With the Confederate artillery on the high ground to the west, and the Union artillery on the east bank of the river, cannon balls undoubtedly crossed the property concurrently from both directions. Many who fought over this ground, including Lee, Jackson, Longstreet, Burnside, Hooker, and Sumner, had a clear view of the mansion that is now the clubhouse. The Pratt family retained ownership of the property up to the beginning of the 20th century.  The Vance Era  In 1905, Captain Reginald Henley Conroy Vance, of New York, purchased Smithfield and added the current wings and white columns to the house. These were the work of architects William Penn Cresson and Nathan C. Wyeth. Wyeth would later design the Oval Office at the White House for William Howard Taft. In 1907, Captain Vance purchased a portion of the adjoining Mannsfield estate and renamed the current clubhouse, Mannsfield Hall. The historic Mannsfield mansion, located on the current North Club subdivision, had burned to the ground January 1863, when southern troops mistakenly built their fire on a hardwood floor. Captain Vance and his wife Clarissa died in the collapse of the Knickerbocker Theater in Washington in 1922.  Formation of the Country Club  In 1925, after Captain Vance's death, the property was purchased by a group of Fredericksburg area citizens, who incorporated it as the Mannsfield Hall Country Club. The dwelling that had been built in 1819 now became their clubhouse, and a nine-hole golf course, tennis courts, and a swimming pool were added. Mannsfield Hall soon became one of the social centers in the Fredericksburg area, and the host to many parties, weddings, balls, and meetings. Unfortunately, with the advent of World War II, gasoline rationing, the shortage of supplies, and the departure of many young men and women to the military, circumstances required the corporation to be dissolved and the property sold at a public auction. It was purchased by Colonel Richard F. Riddell of Washington for $39,000. In 1946, after the war, a group of citizens, many of whom were former club stockholders, purchased the property again for $60,000, and incorporated under its present name, The Fredericksburg Country Club. Since its repurchase, a host of changes and improvements have been made. In 1961, another nine holes were added to the course, several greens relocated, new bunkers built, approaches contoured, and extensive landscaping enhancements undertaken. Of historic note to golfers: The small pond to the right front of the 9th tee covers up what used to be the old 8th green. The original swim facility was replaced with an Olympic style pool, and a wading pool for the youngsters. The outdoor tennis courts were relocated and a new building, housing two indoor courts, was constructed. The clubhouse itself has undergone several major changes. In 1973, a large ballroom and several ancillary facilities were added to the east side of the building. In 1988, further major modifications were made to include increasing the dining area, adding a new kitchen, locker rooms, showers and storage areas. In 1990, a new building was erected to house the golf carts and grounds maintenance equipment. A new pump house was installed in 1993, making it possible to double the amount of acreage that could be served by the water sprinkling system. The Club underwent major construction changes in 1998, necessitated in part by the increase in membership, as well as adding new physical plant amenities. The former kitchen area was remodeled, and has become an employee lounge and storage area. The Rappahannock dining room was enlarged, and the former Hunt and Mannsfield rooms joined and remodeled for gourmet dining and small parties. Added construction provided space for a new bar and bar room; an enlarged new modern kitchen; and a Great Room under the new kitchen. This room provides space for youngsters to come in from the sun or rain, play or watch television, and to get a snack. This Great Room is also used for meetings, banquets, and is adjacent to an area built for al fresco dining. Improvements were made to enhance the play on an already fine golf course, and two new clay courts built for tennis playing members. A fully equipped new exercise room was also added during 1998.  Looking ahead  Over 300 years after the first buildings were erected on the property; 190 years after the present clubhouse was built, 150 years after the last cannon was fired in anger across its boundaries; and 65 years after it was repurchased for $60,000, the Fredericksburg Country Club is now a family oriented, nonprofit social club. The golf, tennis and pool facilities are in fine condition and in active use. The original charm of the ca. 1822 mansion has been preserved, with later additions adapted to contemporary styles and customs. It is a place of luncheons, meetings, youth activities, parties, bridge, banquets, weddings, dances, dinners, and conversation. Its historic setting, architecture, grounds, and landscaping are amongst the finest in Virginia. On August 23, 2011, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake hit the central Virginia region damaging the 4 main chimneys of the original plantation house. The Historic Smithfied-Brooke Foundation, Inc., a 501(c)3 charitable organization which had a mission to preserve the historic plantation structure, is currently raising funds to repair the earthquake damage.

The film depicts a painful day in the life of a teenaged girl who is raising her two younger sisters in their mother's whorehouse. The story is based on Petty's own early life during the mid-1970s. Plot The film focuses on one single day in the life of three abused and neglected sisters, 14-year-old Agnes (Jennifer Lawrence), 12-year-old Bee (Sophi Bairley), and 8-year-old Cammie (Chlo√´ Grace Moretz). Their mother, Sarah (Selma Blair), addicted to alcohol and drugs, has been coerced into prostitution to support her pimp, Duval (Bokeem Woodbine). Sarah is unable to care for the girls, forcing Agnes to take responsibility for her two younger sisters. Sarah's house has become known as the Poker House, where neighborhood pimps and criminals gather to play poker, as well as buying sex. Agnes believes Duval loves her, as a boyfriend would, despite his abuse towards her mother. Agnes arrives home very early one morning to tidy the house and wakes Bee, after preparing her paper route for her. As Bee gets ready to leave they reveal that Cammie often stays the night at her friend Sheila's house, and before they left their father, who was a preacher, he used to beat Sarah and the girls. The four fled, and Sarah, struggling to take care of the girls on her own, became a prostitute after meeting Duval. The day shifts from girl to girl. Little interaction occurs among the three. Bee speaks of moving into a foster home, hoping to be adopted. Cammie spends the day at a bar, making friends with Dolly (Natalie West), the bar owner, and Stymie (David Alan Grier), an alcoholic. Agnes rides through town, talking with a few friends, playing a game of basketball, and picking up a couple of paychecks from her part-time jobs. Towards the end of the day, Agnes climbs through Bee's window, avoiding the living room, which is full of gamblers, pimps, and drunks. Bee has locked herself in her room, and like Agnes, avoids the downstairs chaos. Agnes makes Bee leave the house, telling her not to come back for a while. She then makes her way into the living room, and a stranger begins to talk to her. He asks her why she is there, and she responds by telling him that this is where she lives and that Sarah is her mother. When the man finds out that Agnes is a star basketball player for her high school team, with an important game that night, the man gives her a sympathetic look and tells her to get out of the house and go to the game, but she ignores him. Later that evening, Duval and Agnes begin kissing again, Agnes narrates over the entire scene, after a few minutes, Duval then rapes Agnes. As Duval releases her, she runs to the bathroom to clean herself, horrified by the thoughts of the violence and possibility of pregnancy. She is completely traumatized. Her mother enters the bathroom, and as Agnes reaches for her in utter distress, Sarah refuses to touch her, and instead tells Agnes to go to the store to pick up alcohol after reminiscing on Agnes being a handful as a young child, showing intelligence even when she was a one-year-old. Soon after, Agnes overhears Duval telling Sarah that he will begin pimping and selling Agnes, as well. Agnes threatens to shoot Duval, firing a couple of shots to prevent Duval from leaving, screaming to her mother that he raped her and deserves to be shot for what he does to Sarah, too. Sarah only tells Agnes that she will defend him. Agnes leaves for her basketball game. Agnes scores 27 points in the second half alone, a record that lasts for years to come. However, she falls when she scores the last goal, limps to the car, and has a meltdown. She then wipes her tears and puts the horrific events of the night in the back of her mind. She drives off and finds Bee and Cammie at a nearby bridge. The two get in the car, with Agnes not telling her young sisters of events that took place that evening, and instead takes them to get dinner. Bee reveals that she went to the bar after she went to a friend's house and that she found Cammie. Cammie then plays \\"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\\", and the movie closes as the three girls sing together. At the start of the film credits, Agnes is revealed to have left Iowa to go to New York and become an actress and artist. Some 20 years later, she is shown to have directed the movie, and the movie is the true story of director and actress Lori Petty's childhood.

While Malnovitzer's work is inspired by the prolific portraits of Rembrandt van Rijn (1606‚Äì1669) and the Romanticism of Francisco de Goya (1746‚Äì1828), his style is unique in that it combines European Expressionism with traditional and religious themes. The way he paints is reflective of the way he lives his life - by embracing modern ideas while continuing to preserve his religious traditions. The subjects in his paintings are diverse, ranging from rabbis, to Holocaust survivors, to patrons at coffee shops. The one characteristic that all his works share is that his subjects‚Äô faces, especially their eyes, speak volumes about their life story. The humanity and the universality of his art has made him known throughout the world ‚Äì in Tel Aviv, Tokyo, Paris, New York City, Los Angeles, London, Amsterdam, Sydney, Berlin, and many other cities where his paintings have appeared in auctions, at galleries, and in exhibitions.Ibid  Early life  Out of the Synagogue (2007) by Zvi Malnovitzer. Malnovitzer was born in 1945 as the only son of a Gur Hasidic family. His father was Polish and his mother German. For his early schooling, his parents sent him to cheder (, meaning \\"room\\"), a traditional elementary school that taught the basics of Judaism and the Hebrew language. During his religious studies, Malnovitzer began to paint, using old bed sheets and scraps of wood to create his first oil on canvas work. Young Zvi's talents were soon recognized by his neighbor in Bnei Brak and accomplished Israeli artist, Yehuda Wallersteiner, who agreed to be his teacher at age 13. Wallensteiner taught the young artist the fundamentals of painting in the heart of the ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak, a society that observes Jewish law so strictly that art is rare. \\"I would return to Wallensteiner until I felt that I made paintings that were up to his caliber\\", Malnvoitzer said. Other artists began to notice the boy's talent. For instance, the sculptor Ellul Kussov gave him a recommendation, expressing enthusiasm for his gift for painting.Zvi Malnovitzer. Personal Interview, 12 July 2012 The tragic history of his family and of the Jewish people cast a shadow over his entire life and career. Since his childhood, it was his noble mission to struggle with memories of the Holocaust and of exile through painting. At age 12, Malnotivzer sketched a black ink drawing of figures emerging from a cave, with Nazi soldiers perched on a balcony above. He wrote the word \\"Galut\\", meaning \\"exile\\", at the edge of the drawing. He was thinking of his family who perished in the Holocaust and the injustice that his grandfather endured by the Nazis, including an attempt to set fire to his beard. For young Zvi, born the year that World War II ended, exile became both a traumatic memory and an artistic inspiration. His commitment to energizing the Jewish cultural scene through painting was matched only by his pride to serve the recently established State of Israel. In 1963, Malnovizter was drafted into the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). After his service, he was on reserve duty in the Burial Division.Zvi Malnovitzer, Personal Interview  Career beginnings  In 1966, Malnovitzer married his wife Bilha and began working in a carpentry workshop in south Tel Aviv. In this capacity, he befriended the locals of the neighborhood‚Äîincluding vendors, beggars, and drug addicts‚Äîwho became the subjects of his work.Ibid  Education  In 1977, Malnovizer studied briefly at the Avni Institute in Tel Aviv. He continued his training in Europe, where he was introduced to the works of Rembrandt van Rijn at the Rijksmuseum (Dutch pronunciation: [r…õiÃØks myÀàze èm]) (English: State Museum), a Dutch national museum in Amsterdam, Francisco de Goya at the Museo del Prado, the main Spanish national art museum, located in central Madrid. Tvila at the MIkve (1978) by Zvi Malnovitzer. The mainstay of his European training took place in Reichenau, near Vienna, where he attended seminars with the artist Ernst Fuchs, one of the founders and the most prominent member of the Vienna School of \\"Fantastic Realism.\\" Malnvoitzer studied the art of the Flemish and Venetian masters under Fuchs. The renowned Viennese painter later wrote the following testament of his student‚Äôs talent before the opening of Malnovitzer‚Äôs first major exhibition: :\\"Born in Israel, Zvi is nevertheless at home in the European traditions of painting [‚Ä¶] He is moved to painting by a humble piety and this is where his strength lies [‚Ä¶] His talent enabled him to quickly grasp the new possibilities opening before him, and I feel sure that friends and admirers of his art ‚Äì amongst whom I am proud to count myself ‚Äì will not be disappointed with his artistic achievement. It is in this sense that I wish his first major exhibition every success.\\" ‚Äî Ernst Fuchs, Reichenau/Rax, Austria, August 9, 1979 Malnovitzer returned to Israel in 1978, during which time he painted works such as Tvila at the Mikveh. Full of passion from his experiences with and exposure to European Masters of painting, he sold his house and car to support his full-time vocation as an artist. After formally establishing his art career, he left Israel once again to study and work in Paris (1979).  Art  = Style = Reading Man (2007) Malnovitzer's style is an Expressionism inspired by the dark tonalities and fluid brush strokes of Spanish romantic artist Francisco de Goya and by the monumental portraits of Rembrandt van Rijn. He is known for painting people up-close baring facial expressions that seem simple but convey a dramatic life narrative and depth of emotion.Zvi Malnovitzer, Personal Interview = Themes =  Ultra-orthodox Judaism Although Malnovitzer currently practices Modern Orthodox Judaism, a movement that attempts to synthesize religious values and the observance of Jewish law with the modern world, he continues to identify himself as a spiritual member of the Haredi community in which he was raised and educated. His spiritual ties to this community inspire scenes in his art of Hasidic figures \\"serving God through the worldly\\". Malnovitzer abides by the Hasidic belief that the physical world is only an extension of the spiritual ‚Äì accordingly, his paintings seek to bring out the presence of the spiritual through the material. In Cry (1984), Malnvotizer painted a Hasidic Jew spreading his arms in alarm, his mouth ajar and his awestruck eyes in terror. The figure directs his agony skyward in a gesture that connects the material to the spiritual world of faith. His Bull Dance (1985) addresses this connection in the opposite way ‚Äì by revealing the living presence of the divine with earthly, bestial, and corruptible mankind. In this painting, former Hasidic Jews perform the dance of the bull, a symbol of the material world and of the golden calf, synonymous with decadence, materialism, and idol worship in the Jewish tradition.  Holocaust and Exile  Refugees (1987) by Zvi Malnovitzer Malnovitzer's art is inseparable from the history of his family and people. His notion of peoplehood reflects the idea that Jews are family, distant cousins of common ancestors who have ties to their ancient, Biblical homeland and now the modern State of Israel In Refugees (1987), Malnovitzer painted figures whose faces were undefined, but whose features, including head coverings, beads, and long clothing, made them readily identifiable as Jewish. Their dehumanized and indistinct faces convey the pain of repeated exiles throughout Jewish history. In this particular work, he alluded to a modern-day exile ‚Äì a sequel to the Exodus from Egypt, the Babylonian exile, or expulsion from Spain ‚Äì by portraying an uprooted Jewish settlement from hills of Samaria. It is the only painting ever produced on the subject. The following year, Malnovitzer painted Exodus (2007), depicting the disengagement from the Gaza Strip, the unilateral evacuation of 21 civilian Jewish settlements. Although the work refers to a specific political event, he linked this modern day \\"exile\\" with ones that Jews have endured since Biblical times. This link is reinforced by the title ‚Äì a direct reference to the Exodus from Egypt ‚Äì and by his choice of portraying elderly figures, which make them more universal refugees, not exclusively those evicted from Gaza or Jews in general. They represent a condition of the loss of hope and of unanswered pleas from God.  Scenes from Daily Life  Soup Kitchen (2001) by Zvi Malnovitzer The first painting that Malnovitzer sold in his exhibition in Japan was a portrait of a rabbi smoking a cigar. \\"At first, I didn't understand why the Japanese man identified with the rabbi\\". He proceeded to ask the patron what he saw in the face of the figure, and he replied, \\"there is something universal about the face, and about the human experience in general\\".Zvi Malnovitzer, Personal Interview Malnovitzer often paints scenes from daily life ‚Äì both Jewish and gentile. The places and characters of his paintings seem ordinary ‚Äì strangers at coffee shops, homeless men at soup kitchens, and drunks at bars. The expression on their faces, however, hold back extraordinary stories that are more than what meets the eye.Zvi Malnovitzer, Personal Interview  Exhibitions and Galleries  * 1977 ‚Äì Sarah Kishon Gallery, Tel Aviv (group exhibition) * 1977 ‚Äì Herzl Street Bakery, Tel Aviv (solo exhibition) * 1978 ‚Äì Bental Gallery, Tel Aviv (solo exhibition) * 1979 ‚Äì affiliated with the Hadassah Klatchkin Gallery, Tel Aviv * 1979 ‚Äì Schoninger Gallery, Munich (solo exhibition) * 1980 ‚Äì Hadassah Klatchkin Gallery, Tel Aviv (solo exhibition) * 1982 ‚Äì Philadelphia (group exhibition) * 1983 ‚Äì Lillian Heidenberg Gallery, New York * 1983 ‚Äì Urbach Gallery, Vienna (group exhibition) * 1983 ‚Äì Yeshiva University Museum, New York (solo exhibition) * 1986 ‚Äì Marunouchi Gallery, Tokyo (solo exhibition) * 1988 ‚Äì affiliated with Mayanot Gallery, Jerusalem * 1992 ‚Äì Marunouchi Gallery, Tokyo (solo exhibition) * 1996‚Äì2012 ‚Äì represented by the Mayanot Gallery, Jerusalem * 2000 ‚Äì publication of an important catalog by Mayanot Gallery, Jerusalem * 2002 ‚Äì Waldorf Astoria, New York (solo exhibition) * 2002 ‚Äì Artist Reception and Sale, Gala Dinner for the Rabin Medical Center, New York City.

The owners of Stone Mountain agreed to transfer title on condition the work was completed within 12 years. Borglum, who was, like others involved, a Ku Klux Klan member, was engaged to design the memorial, and proposed expanding it to include a colossal monument depicting Confederate warriors, with Lee, Jackson, and Confederate President Jefferson Davis leading them. The work proved expensive, and the Association advocated the issuance of a commemorative half dollar as a fundraiser for the memorial. Congress approved it, though to appease Northerners, the coin was also made in honor of Harding, under whose administration work had commenced. Borglum designed the coin, which was repeatedly rejected by the Commission of Fine Arts. All reference to Harding was removed from the design by order of President Calvin Coolidge. The Association sponsored extensive sales efforts for the coin throughout the South, though these were hurt by the firing of Borglum in 1925, which alienated many of his supporters, including the United Daughters of the Confederacy. A 1928 audit of the fundraising showed excessive expenses and misuse of money, and construction halted the same year; a scaled- down sculpture was eventually completed in 1970. Because of the large quantities issued‚Äîover a million remain extant‚Äîthe Stone Mountain Memorial half dollar remains inexpensive compared with other U.S. commemoratives.  Background  The first European-descended settlers inhabited the land around Stone Mountain, Georgia, today in the east Atlanta suburbs, around 1790. They called the large outcropping, about long and high, \\"Rock Mountain\\". Rev. Adrel Sherwood of Macon, Georgia, first named it Stone Mountain in 1825. The town of New Gibraltar was founded nearby in 1839; its name would be changed to Stone Mountain by the Georgia Legislature in 1947. From about the time of the American Civil War, the mountain was used as a quarry; this would not entirely cease until the 1970s. John Gutzon de la mothe Borglum (usually called Gutzon Borglum) was born in Idaho Territory in 1867, to one of several wives of a Dane who had converted to Mormonism. As a boy, Borglum lived in various places in the Far West. Turning to art as a career, he attended the San Francisco Art Academy, the Acad√©mie Julian, and the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. Greatly influenced by Rodin, whom he met, Borglum switched from painting to sculpture in 1901. His Mares of Diomedes won a gold medal at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, and became the first work of sculpture to be purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Inception  Stone Mountain In 1914, editor John Temple Graves wrote in the Atlanta Georgian, suggesting the establishment of a memorial to Confederate General Robert E. Lee on Stone Mountain, \\"from this godlike eminence let our Confederate hero calmly look history and the future in the face!\\" Others who called for the establishment of a Confederate memorial there included William H. Terrell, an Atlanta attorney who believed that while the North had spent millions of dollars on monuments to the Union, the South had not sufficiently honored Confederate heroes. Also active in the early days of the Stone Mountain proposal was Helen Plane (1829‚Äì1925), who had been a belle from Atlanta before the war, and whose husband had given his life at the Battle of Antietam in 1862. She devoted the remainder of her life to preserving the memory of the Southern cause. The release of the film The Birth of a Nation in 1915 sparked increased interest in the Confederate cause in the South. Plane, who was lifetime honorary president of the Georgia organization of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC), asked Borglum to carve the image of General Lee on the mountain. The Stone Mountain project was initially a UDC endeavor. Officials originally contemplated a monument of perhaps by . Putting that on Stone Mountain, Borglum supposedly stated, would be like putting a postage stamp on a barn. He proposed a much larger sculpture, high and long, and drew up plans in his Stamford, Connecticut, studio. He envisioned a huge depiction of the Confederate army, including artillery and infantry, as well as 65 Confederate generals, five to be nominated by the governor of each Southern state. In 1917, the Stone Mountain Confederate Monumental Association (the Association) was founded to publicize and raise funds for a colossal sculpture at Stone Mountain. Samuel H. Venable and his family, owners of the land, agreed to deed it over for a monument, on condition that if the project was not completed in 12 years, title would revert to them. A formal dedication took place in May 1916; the preliminary work was interrupted by the US entry into World War I in 1917. Another organization which took an interest in the Stone Mountain work was the recently revived Ku Klux Klan, of which both Venable and Borglum were members. The Klan, through much of the 20th century, held regular encampments on or near Stone Mountain. Plane, in a 1915 letter to Borglum, stated that the original Klan had saved the South from \\"Negro domination\\" in the Reconstruction era, and suggested that the design include a small group of Klansmen in robes, seen in the distance, approaching. Beginning in 1920, the project slowly came under the control of Atlanta businessmen, brought in to aid with the massive fundraising, and the UDC became marginalized. The work on the sculpture resumed on June 18, 1923, when Borglum began carving Lee's figure into the mountainside; he planned for General Stonewall Jackson and Confederate President Jefferson Davis to be close by Lee. Borglum's plans were for a huge sculpture depicting the Confederates, a memorial hall hewn from the granite at the base of the mountain in which artworks and artifacts could be displayed (as well as rolls of honor listing the contributors) and a giant amphitheater nearby. He estimated the total cost at $3.5 million. Instead, the scope of the project was scaled back, though different sources give varying cost estimates and dimensions. Borglum signed a contract to complete the group of Lee, Jackson, and Davis within three years for a cost of $250,000. The work was expensive and by November 1923, the Association decided to advocate for a commemorative coin which it could buy from the government at face value and sell at a premium as a fundraiser. Two men each sought credit for coming up with the idea for a coin. Daniel W. Webb, executive secretary of the Association, said he had thought of it after finding an Alabama centennial half dollar at home; journalist Harry Stillwell Edwards made a similar claim and apparently collected a reward from the Association. Borglum's design for Stone Mountain On November 16, 1923, Edwards wrote to Bascom Slemp, secretary to President Calvin Coolidge (the previous president, Warren G. Harding, had recently died). Edwards arranged a meeting between the President and himself, association president Hollins N. Randolph (an Atlanta lawyer and direct descendant of early president Thomas Jefferson), and Borglum. President Coolidge agreed to support authorizing legislation for a Stone Mountain coin. Borglum later stated that the Association asked him to write to people in Washington because of his contacts in the Republican Coolidge administration. He wrote to the powerful Republican Massachusetts senator, Henry Cabot Lodge, urging him to support legislation for a Stone Mountain commemorative coin; the appeal apparently worked, as late in 1923 the committee chairmen having jurisdiction over coinage, Reed Smoot in the Senate and Louis Thomas McFadden in the House of Representatives, introduced legislation for a Stone Mountain Memorial half dollar. McFadden later wrote that he sponsored the legislation because of his friendship with Borglum. With the threat of sectional opposition if the coin only honored the South, the bill's sponsors included language making the new half dollar also in memory of the recently deceased Harding (an Ohioan), during whose presidency the renewed work had begun. The bill passed by unanimous consent in the House on March 6, 1924, and in the Senate five days later; Coolidge signed it on March 17. The bill authorizing the coin read:  Preparation and design  The Children's Founders Roll medal Borglum was busy between the passage of the bill and the end of May 1924, first working on the Children's Founders Roll medal, and then the half dollar. The Children's Founders Roll was open to white children up to the age of 18 who contributed one dollar to the building of the monument. Borglum must still have been fine-tuning the monument's design; Jackson's posture on the medal differs from that on the coin. Unlike the issued coin, Borglum's models showed the front part of Davis's horse, although the Confederate president is unseen, and marching soldiers appear in the background. Borglum met with Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon who questioned first why \\"In God We Trust\\" appeared directly over Lee's head; Borglum responded that it was to pay tribute to the Confederates' faith. Mellon then asked what the thirteen stars on the obverse represented; Borglum replied that those on the north side of the Mason‚ÄìDixon line could consider them to represent the thirteen original colonies (those south of it, the implication was, could consider them to be a tribute to the Southern states). Mellon laughed and gave preliminary approval. On July 2, Mellon showed the designs to President Coolidge; they were then sent to the Commission of Fine Arts for its members' opinions. Borglum's original models for the half dollar According to numismatists William D. Hyder and R.W. Colbert, \\"Borglum, to put it mildly, was a temperamental artist who managed to offend most everyone with whom he worked\\". They note that \\"Borglum's past insolence had not left him in the good graces of the art community\\" and his designs met a hostile reception at the commission. Sculptor member James Earle Fraser, designer of the Buffalo nickel, rejected Borglum's initial design on July 22, eight days after they were received. The inscription on the reverse included a tribute to Harding; Fraser deemed it inartistic. Borglum submitted a second set on August 14, this was again rejected; the commission criticized the design, which seemed to be only a segment of a larger one, rather than specifically designed to fit a half dollar. Borglum wanted to ignore what he deemed \\"damn fool suggestions\\", but the Association threatened to fire him if he did not complete the coin. Borglum was concerned the reverse was still too crowded, and proposed leaving off the eagle, but space was saved when Coolidge did not like the reference to Harding, and it was omitted. With the eagle still in place on the reverse, Fraser finally approved the designs on October 10, 1924. In all, Borglum made nine plaster models for the design. Even though all necessary approvals had been received, the Philadelphia Mint refused to proceed with preparations because of the lack of the mention of Harding, which it believed was congressionally mandated. Borglum wired Coolidge on October 31, notifying him of the problem; the President confirmed his approval of the design the following day. Despite the support of the federal government for the coin, the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), an organization of Union Civil War veterans, tried to prevent the issuance of a coin they believed honored treason by lobbying in late 1924 and early 1925. Work on the sculpture slowed (the head of Jackson was then being carved) because of the sculptor being distracted by designing the coin, flaws in the rock on Stone Mountain, and the fact that the Association had ceased fundraising efforts in anticipation of a campaign to sell the coin. Revenues from the medal were not sufficient to meet expenses. The obverse of the half dollar depicts Confederate generals Lee and Jackson, the latter with head bare, mounted on horseback. Although both Lee and Jackson were respected in the North, Davis would not have been acceptable on a federal coin, and he was omitted, although he appears on the Children's Founders Roll medal which Borglum adapted for the obverse of the half dollar. There are thirteen stars in the upper field of the obverse; they represent the thirteen states which either joined the Confederacy or had Confederate factions. Borglum's initials, \\"GB\\", are found on the extreme right of the piece, near the horses' tails. The reverse depicts an eagle with wings stretched, representative of liberty, perched upon a mountaintop. There are 35 stars in the field, supposedly to represent the number of states at the start of the Civil War, although there were in fact 34 in 1861, and there were 35 states only from 1863 to 1864, between the admissions of West Virginia and Nevada. Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, writing in 1971, noted that the half dollar represents an unusual circumstance in American art, where a designer uses a coin as a bozzetto or small-scale model of a work to be completed. Vermeule considered the children's medal a better work of art, due to the inclusion of Davis. He believed that Borglum's original design, before its rejection by the Commission of Fine Arts, was superior, as it included a sense of motion through the depiction of marching soldiers in the background, balanced by the inclusion of the head of Davis's horse, though the Confederate president himself is unseen. According to Vermeule, the original design \\"would have made a magnificent coin, an unusual compression of monumentality and power into a limited and unorthodox historical space\\".  Production and conflict  Borglum at the White House, 1924 The Medallic Art Company of New York converted Borglum's models to coinage dies. The first 1,000 Stone Mountain Memorial half dollars were struck on a medal press at the Philadelphia Mint on January 21, 1925, the 101st anniversary of General Jackson's birth; Borglum and officials of the Association were present. The first piece struck was mounted on a plate made of gold mined in Georgia for presentation to President Coolidge. The second was mounted on a silver plaque, and presented to Secretary Mellon. The remainder of the first thousand were placed in numbered envelopes; some were presented to officials or those involved in the Stone Mountain project. Between January and March 1925, that mint struck 2,310,000 of the authorized mintage of 5,000,000, plus 4,709 pieces reserved for inspection by the 1926 Assay Commission. Except for the first thousand, for which Randolph paid in gold, the pieces were sent to the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta, which advanced the funds to purchase them from the government. Although the Association unveiled the completed head of Lee on January 19, 1924 (the general's birthday), within months, its relations with Borglum had become strained. Technical problems over the medal and the work on the mountain caused tensions, and political differences between Borglum, a Republican, and Randolph, an active Democrat, led to poor relations between the two. Borglum, Venable, and Randolph backed different KKK members for national leadership. Both Borglum and the Association accused each other of graft; the sculptor proposed that he form a syndicate to purchase the half dollars from the Mint and sell them with the profits to be applied directly to construction costs. Randolph ridiculed the suggestion, stating that it would allow Borglum to carve \\"whatever he pleased on the mountain\\". Borglum accused Randolph of using donations for his own benefit, and spending freely on an expense account. These dissensions became public, and in February 1925, the Association fired Borglum. Randolph stated, as one reason for dismissing the sculptor, that Borglum had taken seven months to design the coin, when, he said, any competent artist could have done it in three weeks. He accused Borglum of delaying so that the Association would be embarrassed. According to Freeman, \\"despite all the points of conflict between Borglum and the committee, it was actually the commemorative coin that ended his career at Stone Mountain.\\" Upon being dismissed, Borglum wrecked his models for the monument; the Association sought to have him jailed for destruction of property. Borglum was addressing the ladies of the Atlanta chapter of the UDC when his assistant, Jesse Tucker, burst in and hurried him out the door with a minimum of explanation, only moments before a sheriff's deputy arrived to serve the warrant. He left the state, but was arrested in Greensboro, North Carolina, though quickly allowed bail, and the Association abandoned extradition proceedings.(subscription required) Freed, the sculptor soon took up a project in South Dakota, Mount Rushmore. The publicity surrounding these events hurt the Association's fundraising, as did allegations that the Association had misused hundreds of thousands of dollars put aside for the project.  Marketing and distribution  The Association hired Augustus H. Lukeman as replacement sculptor; all of Borglum's work was eventually blasted away. Despite the dispute with Borglum, the Association proceeded to market the half dollars; it hired New York publicist Harvey Hill to run the campaign. The Association hoped for the opportunity to present the first coin to President Coolidge in person as a means of overcoming the bad publicity; White House officials warily declined, writing that \\"no good purpose would be served by a formal presentation\\". The half dollars were officially released on July 3, 1925 (though some were displayed as early as May); they were sold at a price of one dollar. They were sent to 3,000 banks by the Federal Reserve, with the proceeds from sales credited to the Association. White Southerners applauded the piece as symbolizing sectional reconciliation, the federal government paying homage to the South's Confederate heritage. The coins were to be distributed through banks, and the Federal Reserve System cooperated by moving coins as needed, though at the Association's expense. The Association set up local affiliates, with organizations throughout the South, as well as Oklahoma and the District of Columbia. Each state's governor served as nominal head of the organization within his jurisdiction; on July 20, 1925, at a meeting of the Conference of Southern Governors called for the purpose, they (or their representatives) resolved that the Association allocate sales quotas among the states on the \\"basis of white population and bank deposits\\". The pieces were to be sold at the price of one dollar, and local organizations were to generate promotions for selling them. The overall drive to sell half dollars was dubbed the \\"Harvest Campaign\\" and began with the governors' meeting in July 1925. Georgia Governor Clifford Walker told his colleagues that the \\"South would be eternally disgraced if it failed to accept the challenge\\" of meeting the sales goal of 2,500,000 coins; nevertheless, the governors devoted little time to the campaign. Although volunteer enthusiasm was essential to the Association's plans in the Harvest Campaign, it did not rely on it at the higher levels; the state chairs were compensated, both by salary and commission. J.W. Gibbes, clerk of the South Carolina House of Representatives, was hired as that state's executive director; he undertook to sell 100,000 coins and received just under $3,500 in salary and commissions, all paid in 1926. Local volunteers organized Chamber of Commerce luncheons to sell coins throughout the South; chapters of the UDC purchased pieces to present to surviving Civil War veterans. The quota for Florida was 175,000 coins, with each town and city apportioned its share. Often, Kiwanis or Rotary groups underwrote local quotas. Mrs. N. Burton Bass of Atlanta was reported to be the leading seller, once disposing of 233 coins in an afternoon. A series of dance balls honored the UDC members who sold large numbers of pieces. Nevertheless, Hyder and Colbert suggested that there was \\"a general lack of more ladies such as Mrs. Bass\\"; many municipalities had trouble finding local chairs. Outside the South, sales were promoted by three professional publicists hired by the Association. To keep public interest high, the Association released Lukeman's conceptions for Stone Mountain, which were on a smaller scale than Borglum's. Lukeman conceived a scaled-down concept, of the three Confederate leaders on horseback. Despite the campaign, sales were slower than expected. In late 1925, the Association offered Northern banks a commission of seven cents a coin; it is uncertain if any took up the offer. The continuing opposition of the GAR to the coins dampened sales in the North, and there was considerable criticism of the coin issue in newspapers. Counterstamped Stone Mountain Memorial half dollar One means of fundraising that Harvest Campaign administrators decided on was to counterstamp some of the coins for sale at premium prices. The letters and numbers are believed to have been punched by the Association, as they are almost entirely uniform. Some were given a state abbreviation and a number, and were sent to be auctioned in various towns. Gibbes reported that the counterstamped pieces sent to South Carolina sold for an average of $23, ranging from $10 to $110, and recommended that the auctions be preceded with the account of the sale of one in Bradenton, Florida, for $1,300. Which town got which number was the luck of the draw. Others were marked with \\"U.D.C.\\" and a state abbreviation, together with a number which probably represents a membership or chapter number. These were intended for presentation to members deserving of special honor, such as an outgoing president. They did not sell well, as the Association had alienated many UDC members over the firing of Borglum. The Association also announced a program for sale to the Sons of Confederate Veterans, although whether any coins were sold under this program is unclear, as none have been identified. Pieces marked \\"G.L.\\" and \\"S.L.\\" were puzzled over by collectors for many years; A. Steve Deitert in the January 2011 edition of The Numismatist identified the markings as \\"Gold Lavalier\\" and \\"Silver Lavalier\\". These coins were given to county winners and runners-up in a selling competition for young women. The Association sold coins through other means. They asked companies to purchase them: the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad [B&O;], the Southern Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, the Coca-Cola Company, and a number of banks, purchased thousands of pieces, many of which were given away as promotions. Those outside the South could obtain coins by orders passed through local banks. A bank in St. Louis gave away the half dollars to those who opened an account with at least $5; the B&O; used them in making change. The Association called an end to the Harvest Campaign as of March 31, 1926, most likely because the sales did not justify the continued salary expenses. Coins remaining at banks were to be sent to the Federal Reserve, and any credit balances remitted to the Association. Thereafter, coins were available either through the Association or the Federal Reserve at an increased price of $2. With a price increase and the end to the campaign, sales plummeted. Total sales from the Harvest Campaign were about 430,000 pieces. One exception to the drop in sales was a drive in New York under the sponsorship of Mayor Jimmy Walker, which succeeded in selling 250,000 coins in 1926, though at the original price of one dollar. Bernard Baruch, then a prominent investor and later a counselor of presidents, was honorary chairman of the organizing committee, and personally subscribed for some of the pieces.  Aftermath  Stone Mountain in 2007 Card accompanying half dollars formerly owned by Bernard Baruch The Atlanta chapter of the UDC in 1927 published a brochure accusing the Association of wrongfully firing Borglum and wasting between a quarter and a half million dollars. An audit of the Association's books was performed in 1928; the examiners found its records in good order, excepting those regarding the Harvest Campaign, which were inadequate. The audit found that for every three dollars of revenue brought in from the half dollars, two were paid out in expenses, a ratio Hyder and Colbert called \\"incredible\\". Of the total sum raised by the Association, only 27 cents of each dollar went to the carving. Venable stated that the Stone Mountain monument had \\"developed into the most colossal failure in history\\". The Association was discredited by the results of the audit; the Georgia Senate voted to accuse it of gross mismanagement of funds. Randolph resigned when Venable made it clear he would not negotiate an extension of the twelve-year deadline unless he did. The Atlanta lawyer had begun a political career; the scandal finished it. With funds drying up, the Association stopped work on Stone Mountain on May 31, 1928, and when negotiations failed, the Venable family successfully sued to regain the property. Borglum was now a folk hero in Atlanta; he was called upon to return to Stone Mountain in the early 1930s, but busy with Mount Rushmore, he did not. At the time of Borglum's death in 1941, no work was being done on Stone Mountain. The State of Georgia voted funds to purchase Stone Mountain in 1958 and five years later selected Walker Kirkland Hancock as architect. The sculpture, which depicts Lee, Jackson and Davis, and bears only a resemblance to Borglum's original design, was dedicated in 1970. At by , it is the largest relief sculpture in the world. In 1930, Secretary Mellon reported that although no Stone Mountain Memorial half dollars were held by the Mint, it was his understanding that large quantities of the piece were in the possession of banks. Eventually, arrangements were made to return a million half dollars to the Mint for melting. In spite of this, the State of Georgia still had Stone Mountain half dollars for sale at its exhibit at the 1933 Century of Progress Exposition. Many more were dumped into circulation in the 1930s. A quantity of half dollars once owned by Baruch were sold for $3.25 each through a Georgia bank in the 1950s to finance a building in honor of Baruch's mother, a Southerner, in Richmond, Virginia. A total of 1,314,709 Stone Mountain Memorial half dollars were distributed, after deducting those pieces melted. Due to the large quantities extant, Stone Mountain Memorial half dollars remain inexpensive in comparison with other commemoratives. The 2014 edition of A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the piece at $65 in Almost Uncirculated condition (AU-50) with pieces in near- pristine MS-66 at $335.

He also reported that his ship was lucky and injuries very minor during the action.

Escalera also runs the 60 yard dash in 6.2 seconds making him a valuable base runner. Escalera's skills were nationally ranked and evaluated by Perfect Game, Baseball Factory and Prospect Wire; he was considered to be one of the most consistent and reliable baseball players of the 2012 rookie crop. alt=A man in a blue uniform walking toward the outfield in a baseball field. Offensively, Escalera can produce real power out of his thin frame. However, in addition to his offensive skills ‚Äì bat speed, quick hands, low- tension swing ‚Äì the general consensus is that on defense Escalera has a smooth easy action to the ball, remarkably quick feet and soft hands. His solid arm strength (91 MPH) supports his fielding skills. Perfect Game Scouting Report described Escalera as having a very smooth action, lots of arm strength, on line accurate throws, sound fundamentals and long infield actions that may lead to the third baseman position in the future but he has the tools to play any of the outfield positions. :Draft During his high school senior year Escalera was scouted by eighteen Major League Baseball (MLB) organizations. He caught the attention of the professional southeast scouting staff who were regulars in Escalera's high school baseball games and workouts. \\"Escalera is one of the most interesting prospects to watch leading up to the draft\\" stated the sports expert Mack Ade. Kansas City Royals scout Alex Mesa, comprehensively evaluated Escalera's performance prior to the 2012 draft and developed a close relation with Escalera and his family. Mesa lobbied the Royals‚Äô management team and later got support from Paul Gibson and Lonnie Goldberg, National Cross-Checker and Director of Scouting respectively. The Royals consistent draft philosophy has been to get the best talent available on the board. Mesa successfully argued that Escalera's ability and work ethic fit that philosophy perfectly. Escalera with the Burlington Royals On draft day, Escalera was selected as the Kansas City Royals 8th pick, becoming the youngest player to be drafted since the inception of the drafthttp://www.i70baseball.com/2012/06/07/royals-draft-the-youngest-player- in-baseball-history/ in 1965. After negotiating the terms of his contract and signing an agreement, Escalera was sent to the AZL Royals in Surprise, Arizona. :Rookie, AZL Royals, Arizona League After a month with the AZL Royals Escalera was able to adjust and contribute to his team's success. Escalera's participation in the AZL League has generated enthusiastic responses from his teammates, fans and coaches. \\"Combine Escalera's youth, glimpse of hitting talent, arm and speed and the Royals could have a true diamond in the rough\\" stated sports analyst Zach Mortimer. :Advanced Rookie, Burlington Royals, Appalachian League Escalera was assigned by the Kansas City Royals to join the affiliate Burlington Royals in North Carolina during the 2013 baseball season after having a strong spring training showing. During the season, Escalera endured some minor challenges including a left thigh muscle strain. Despite this, Escalera ended his 2013 season as the Burlington Royals Team's leader in hits, doubles and batting average among the players in the team's final roster with more than 150 season's at bats. Escalera made the Top 20 2013 Appalachian League's batting average list. :Class A, Lexington Legends, South Atlantic League Escalera (left) during spring training with the Royals After the 2014 Spring Training session, the Royals organization assigned Escalera to the Kansas City Royals affiliate Lexington Legends in Kentucky. Philanthropic activities Escalera has shown a commitment with participating and supporting altruistic events organized to improve the quality of live of the homeless population as well as underprivileged kids. During his recurrent outings to the Royals‚Äô training camp in Surprise Arizona, Escalera has gotten involved in many humanitarian activities mostly related with assisting kids to get motivated to succeed in life. In October 2012, the Extra Innings Foundation awarded Escalera with the Player of the Month Award,http://www.extrainningsfoundation.org/index.html for his continued support to the development of young children in the Arizona underprivileged communities. Later that year, Escalera headed an activity to raise funds for UNICEF's United States Fund to promote world access to clean water. He turned over a $25,000 check to the Puerto Rico Secretary of State Kenneth McClintock, in the presence of Secretary of State-designate David Bernier and Secretary- designate of Sports and Recreation Ram√≥n Orta. In April 2013, during the National Volunteer Week, President Obama's Administration awarded Escalera with the President's Volunteer Service Award the nation's most distinguished service awards in the United States.

He began his police career at an early age, and rose rapidly through the ranks. After nearly three decades of service with the City of London Police Essex Police and Scotland Yard, in 2005 he moved to Jamaica to take up a new position as Deputy Police Commissioner of the Jamaica Constabulary Force. In that capacity, he came to worldwide attention as he led the investigation into the death of Pakistan's cricket coach Bob Woolmer in the run-up to the 2007 Cricket World Cup finals. The Guardian credits him as \\"the British officer who changed policing in Jamaica\\". Early career Shields began his law enforcement career in 1976 at the age of 17. He served as the head of the City of London Police's special branch from 1987 to 1990. He also spent time as a member of the National Criminal Intelligence Service posted to Frankfurt, Germany as a drugs and organised crime liaison officer, in which capacity he frequently travelled throughout Eastern European countries, including Belarus, Ukraine, and Poland. Shields later moved on to the Metropolitan Police Service, where he rose to the rank of Detective Chief Superintendent. He once investigated a kidnapping plot against Victoria Beckham. He also led investigations which resulted in the 2002 discovery of a large weapons cache in Hillingdon believed to have been stored by a criminal gang or professional contract killer. He was the project manager on the strengthening of the \\"Ring of Steel\\" anti-terrorism cordon around the City of London. Shields' work at Scotland Yard also included investigations into organized crime and as a kidnap senior investigating officer. He gained a reputation for expertise in this area, and later began playing a more international role as a result. Shields first came to Jamaica at the request of Allan Brown of London's Metropolitan Police Service to aid in the investigation of Reneto Adams and four other policemen charged with 7 May 2003 murder of four civilians at Kraal, Clarendon Parish. Shields was successful in breaking a wall of silence from the Jamaican police, persuading four officers to testify against their colleagues; however, the prosecutor was unable to secure a conviction, in an acquittal widely viewed as corrupt by the Jamaican public. As Deputy Commissioner in Jamaica =Assignment= On the basis of his earlier role in bringing the Adams case to trial, Shields was assigned on secondment to the Jamaica Constabulary Force in 2005. He was one of a number of foreign police officers recruited for the JCF in those years, the others being fellow Britons Les Green and Justice Felice, and Canadian Paul Martin. Among the aims of the recruitment exercise were to augment the force's capabilities for intelligence activities and investigation. With his appointment, the Jamaican and British police would better co-ordinate their efforts over the gang- and drug-related violence affecting both countries. Shields introduced a number of procedural and technological reforms in the JCF which were credited with increasing the arrest and conviction rate, including systematic digitisation of fingerprints taken from arrested suspects, increased introduction of closed-circuit television cameras, and further use of DNA evidence. From 2005 to 2006, the number of murders in Jamaica fell by 20 percent, from 1,680 to 1,340. He also stressed getting the community involved through neighbourhood watch programs and independent advisory groups who would liaise with the police and build trust between the two groups. There was some concern over whether British policing methods would be effective in the different culture and situation of Jamaica. Shields described Jamaica as presenting different challenges than his native Britain, noting that while the crime rate was higher in Jamaica, there were far fewer people committing those crimes; in simple words, his solution was \\"to target the gunmen\\". He also sought to fight corruption in the JCF. Shields earned respect for the personal risk he took in combating deep-set corruption and violence, and for his perceived honesty. He had initially been worried that he would be seen as a \\"colonialist\\" as a white man going into a black community in an authority position, but his fears about public perceptions of his role turned out to be unfounded. As for his relations with the rest of the JCF, his position was newly created for his arrival, meaning that he was not blocking anyone else's chances for promotion. However, there was some resentment among JCF personnel over Shields' high salary, which was thirty times that of the average constable. Local colleagues complained that Shields often took the lead in high-profile investigations as a means of garnering media attention. His tenure was also marked by conflict with then-Leader of the Opposition Bruce Golding over policing in Tivoli Gardens, Kingston. =Woolmer case= Shields was brought into the international spotlight by his investigation into the March 2007 death of the Pakistan Cricket Coach, Bob Woolmer. At the time, hundreds of journalists were in the West Indies to cover the Cricket World Cup, making the media response to the murder immediate and intense. Their interest increased once Shields announced a pathologist's findings that Woolmer's death was caused by manual strangulation. Shields held frequent updates in the lobby of Jamaica Pegasus Hotel where Woolmer's body was found, and himself became the focus of media attention ‚Äì too much, his detractors claimed. Shields also expressed frustration with the media's pressure for immediate answers and a rapid arrest, and their insinuations that the death was an inside job by someone from the Pakistani team, speculation which Shields rejected. Shields turned to his old Scotland Yard colleagues to review the investigation as he was not convinced of Dr Ere Seshiah, the pathologist's determination that Woolmer had been strangled. Shields ordered a re- examination of Woolmer's body and the recovery of the hyoid bone, which Seshiah believed was broken, indicating that Woolmer had been strangled. Shields engaged the services of three internationally recognised forensic pathologists, Professor Lorna Martin Cape Town, South Africa, Michael Pollanen in Canada and top Home Office pathologist, Nat Carey in the UK. They independently agreed that Wooler had died of natural causes, completely discrediting the claims made by Seshiah. Based on this work and with the full support of the Woolmer family, their investigation reached a startlingly different result: they stated that Woolmer had died of a heart attack. In late November, after 26 days of testimony from 57 witnesses, the 11-member jury convened to conduct the inquest into Woolmer's death concluded that there was insufficient evidence to return a verdict on its cause. Shields then announced that the JCF did not intend to pursue further investigation. Exit from JCF and subsequent work In November 2008, the Ministry of National Security announced that Shields had declined an extension of his contract, and subsequently would be leaving the JCF. Investigations into Christopher \\"Dudus\\" Coke and his Tivoli Gardens stronghold began under Shields' watch, but it would not be until a year after his departure from the JCF that they would come to fruition with Coke's arrest. After the end of his contract, Shields announced that he would establish his own company, Shields Crime and Security Consultants. He supported Owen Ellington's bid to succeed his former boss Rear Admiral Hardley Lewin as Police Commissioner. Through his consultancy work, he would encourage Caribbean law enforcement agencies to adopt advanced technology and forensic techniques such as DNA profiling and telephone tapping on mobile phones. However, he acknowledged that there were significant barriers to implementing these techniques, such as the atmosphere of mistrust between the policing and the telecommunications sectors in Jamaica. Personal life Shields was born in London, the son of a nurse and a civil servant in the Ministry of Defence. Shields married his first wife in 1987, and had two children with her. He attended the University of Essex on a police scholarship, where he studied government and politics. In Jamaica, outside of his work hours he enjoyed a bon vivant lifestyle, and was described as \\"one of Jamaica's 30 most eligible men\\" by the Jamaica Gleaner. In 2007, he was reported to have been in a serious relationship for two years with a 24-year- old local fashion designer, but they separated soon after. During his time in Jamaica, he also became a fan of the Jamaica national football team, the \\"Reggae Boyz\\". He lives in the upscale Norbrook neighbourhood of the Kingston Metropolitan Area. On one occasion police showed up with a warrant to search his house, but it turned out they were actually looking for the house of his neighbour Vybz Kartel; Shields' boss Lewin later apologised to him over the incident. Shields married Emily Crooks an attorney at law and broadcast journalist. They have a daughter, Zuri born in 2009.

Plot  Commissioner Jacovella is a hasty and decisive but fundamentally honest police officer, and sometimes indulges in unorthodox methods to carry out his job as Head of the City Mobile Squad. For this reason he is disliked by the journalists of the city and reciprocates the same sentiment towards them. Jacovella's wife is a witness in a trial against the brother of the local boss of the Sacra Corona Unita Dante Ragusa and is threatened by his henchmen so as not to let her testify. The trial ends with the acquittal of the accused and with the commissioner who publicly takes it out on the journalists present. The situation in the city is tense. Antonio Blasi, a young boy without a job, needs money to be able to go to live with his girlfriend Nadia and marry her, so he decides to participate in a robbery of a security van. But something goes wrong, the robbery is foiled, the driver of the gang killed and the rest of the robbers engage in a shooting with the police officer on guard outside the Bank. Blasi, who has never shot a man, is forced by the other robbers to kill the policeman who was trying to stop them. Confused and stunned by the shock of killing the young agent, he escapes on foot. While the other two robbers manage to steal a car and escape making another victim (the woman who owns the car), Blasi still runs scared and in a crisis of conscience through the streets of the city, until he stops a car and forces the driver to get off. Unfortunately, the car belongs to Pasquale Ragusa, brother of a respected mafia boss and blind person in the area, who was transporting some burning documents back from Rome, including a letter from a corrupt Minister in exchange for easy building permits in the city. . Blasi thus, in addition to being wanted by the police for murder, has wronged the boss Dante Ragusa who obviously wants him dead and orders his men to capture him, who in looking for him will kill his father by throwing him into a millstone. The boy escapes with his girlfriend to a country farm that belonged to his grandfather and now uninhabited, chased by the killers of the Ragusa boss, who intercept him near Castel del Monte and where they try to kill him. Blasi in the clash with the killers has the upper hand and gets rid of them by killing one. The escape continues. Meanwhile Giacomo Maselli, director of the local newspaper La Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno, is one of the journalists who cannot stand the violent methods of the police, especially Commissioner Jacovella, discovers the identity of the policeman's killer in the robbery, collects his confession and understands his repentance and try to help him. Commissioner Jacovella, having read the news with the revelations on Blasi's identity in the newspaper, pawns Maselli and saves him from an attack that Pasquale Ragusa was preparing for the journalist, one of the agents shoots and kills Pasquale Ragusa and saves Maselli. The investigation continues and the commissioner shows up at the funeral of the Boss's brother, making him go into a rage for the gesture, considered of little respect. Maselli and Antonio Blasi's girlfriend, who did not abandon him despite knowing about the murder, manage to convince the boy to turn himself in, since at this point he has only one way out, also because he found and read the letter from the Corrupt minister to boss Ragusa and they know he wouldn't have a long life around the city. Maselli informs the commissioner that the boy will deliver himself to the newspaper office that same evening. At the moment of delivery in front of the gates of the Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno, a sniper of the Ragusa boss shoots Blasi with a sniper rifle. The boy dies in the arms of his girlfriend and under the eyes of Maselli and Jacovella but not before they have come into possession of the letter that reveals the contact between the corrupt Minister and Ragusa, a document that will allow the official to go and arrest the boss.

The film grossed a total of 654,940,070 Italian lire domestically on its theatrical release. Reception From contemporary reviews, Martyn Auty reviewed a 95-minute English-dubbed version of the film in the Monthly Film Bulletin. Auty found the film to be \\"cheap propaganda for the law-and-order lobby.

Meghavahana was 80th ruler of the Gonanda line of rulers, he was followed by 81st ruler Pravarasena (also known as Sresthasena and Tuneena). Personal life Meghavahana, the first prince of the restored dynasty, is said to have been the son of Gopaditya, a great grandson of Yudhishthira, living in exile at the court of the king of Gandhara. Meghavahana, who is supposed to have taken possession of the throne of his forefathers at the invitation of the Kashmirian ministers, is described as a strong but pious ruler. He married Amritaprabha, daughter of the king Bala Varman of Kamarupa. His son and successor is S'resthasena. Tenure Various acts attributed to him, like the prohibition of the killing of animals, even in sacrifices and the building of numerous Viharas by his court seem to show Meghavahana in the light of a patron of Buddhism. Apart from several legendary anecdotes which are intended to illustrate the spiritual greatness of the king and his command of supernatural powers acquired thereby, Kalhana relates of him a digvijaya or conquest of the world. Meghavahana is supposed to have undertaken it in order to impose his prohibition of slaughter on the whole earth. It needs scarcely to be demonstrated that no historical value can attach to the record of such fabulous conquests. The report of Meghavahana having come from Gandhara acquires significance in view of the unmistakable numismatic evidence which points to Kashmir having been founded by Amritaprabha, Meghavahana's queen, was known already to On-kong. The attribution of a Stupa known by a Tibetan designation (Loh-Stoupa) to the Guru of this foreign queen, seems also to rest on genuine tradition. Of Meghavahana 's son and successor S'resthasena, who is said to have borne also the names of Pravarasena and Tunjina, built various sacred structures at Puranadhisthana, the old capital, the site of which is marked by the modern Pandrethan. S'resthasena is said to have two sons, of which the elder, Hiranya, succeeded him, while the other, Toramana, acted as Yuvaraja. Toramana strike large number of coins in his name.

In Soviet times notary was a state official. Since 1996 based on the Georgian Law, \\"About Notary\\" the legal status of notary as of the representative of liberal profession has been determined. Notary is an impartial and trusty advisor of its client. A document attested by the notary has indisputable probative force. Notary is responsible for the damage caused by its official activity. Along with legislation, insuring of notary's professional responsibility, operating since 2010, also provides a guarantee of citizen's immunity. Damage caused by culpable or careless acts of notaries is remunerated by the insurance company. Notary shall keep secrecy of information having become known to it in association with its profession. This obligation also survives after notary is released from the position. Since 2009 notary has to register any notary act in electronic registry. As a result of creation of electronic base of notary acts, getting of notary services significantly simplified and accelerated; one may get notary service in single space; one may get inheritance certificate with any notary; the practice of on-line notarization has been introduced; one may check whether any notary deed is registered or not and be ascertained in its trustworthiness without going out, at the web-site of the Notary Chamber. There are 224 practicing notaries in Georgia. Based on the Order of the Minister of Justice the number of notaries should not exceed 300. Requirements Notary's position may be occupied by a capable Georgian citizen with higher legal education, having passed relevant traineeship or at least one year length of service as a notary or at least 5 years length of service in public bodies, also having successfully passed qualification examination of notaries and won contest according to the Order No. 3 of the Minister of Justice, \\"About the rule of conducting a contest for selection the notary candidates\\", approved on January 10, 2012. All practicing notaries in Georgia are associated in the Notary Chamber of Georgia. Control over official activities of notaries is performed by the Ministry of Justice (Georgia).

It is located in the south-east corner of the site and consists of three main structures: the Temple of the Cross, Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Foliated Cross. The Temple of the Cross is the largest and most significant. The temple is a step pyramid containing bas-relief carvings inside. The temple was constructed to commemorate the rise of Chan Bahlum II to the throne after the death of Pacal the Great. The bas-relief carvings reveal Chan Bahlum receiving the great gift from his predecessor. The cross motif found at the complex allude to the names given to the temples, but in reality the cross is a representation to the World Tree that can be found in the center of the world according to Mayan mythology. History Temple of the Cross during the primary stages of excavation. Temple of the Cross The Temple of the Cross complex was built by Kan-Bahlum who reigned between 684 AD and 702 AD. One purpose of the temple was to house the panels that recorded Kan-Bahlum's ancestral history, his accession and the divine origin of his lineage. In the sanctuaries in the temples there are carved stone tablets to be found, one tablet for each tower containing hieroglyphic information about the purpose of each temple. They also contain information about the Palenque triad of gods (GI, GII, and GIII) and their right to leadership.Houston 1996, p.132-151. Temple of the Cross The pyramids in the Cross Complex were built in the Late Classic period of the Mesoamerican chronology, constructed according to the general Mesoamerican architectural traditions. They relied on intricate carved stone to make the spectacular stairstep design. These three temples are the only structures in the Maya realm that play the role of a Maya codex (bark paper book) in three parts. Within the temples there is both real and mythical history recorded. The recorded history is cohesive; as you move from temple to temple, you can read the history as if it were a book.Lounsbury 1976, p.211-224. Archaeologist have evidence that the site was attacked by Calakmul in 599 and 611. The attacks may have inspired the building tradition initiated by Pacal and continued by his son, K'inich Kan Bahlam, and grandson, Akul Mo' Naab. After the site was attacked by Tonin√° the construction of elaborate and complex buildings stopped around 800, and the population of the site decreased.Lounsbury 1980, p.99-115.Lounsbury 1985, p.45-58. Temple of the Sun When the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, Palenque had been abandoned and forgotten by the Maya in the region. In 1567 Father Pedro Lorenzo de la Nada was the first European to study and publish a description of the ruins which he named Palenque. Father Pedro Lorenze de la Nada was exploring near the Usumacinta River where he stumbled upon its stone temples and plazas. Excavation, maintenance, and restoration of the Cross Complex was not initiated until 1940. More funding for maintenance came after Mexican archaeologist Alberto Ruz Lhuillier in 1952 discovered the burial tomb of Pacal the Great in the Temple of Inscriptions. Since the discovery of Pacal's tomb, the site has become one of the most extensively studied archaeological sites in the Americas. Archeologist Jorge Acosta expanded excavation and conservation of the Cross Complex from 1967 to 1974. The Palenque Project led by archeologist Arnoldo Gonz√°lez Cruz in 1989 initiated extensive research, restoration, and conservation projects on the Cross Complex. In 1993 archaeologists found an offering containing more than 100 incense burners within the Temple of the Cross. Structure Temple of the Cross Layout:C-Cross, F-Foliated Cross, S-Sun The Cross Complex site is located at the bottom of the mountain Yehmal K'uk' Lakam Witz, The Great Mountain of the Descending Quetzal. Yehmal K'uk' Lakam Witz was considered a sacred mountain by the Maya because of the many natural springs that supply fresh water to Otulum River. The Otulum River was the principal water source for the city. Temple of the Sun (left), Temple XIV (center), and Temple of the Cross (right) The Cross Complex structures are built from limestone which is widely available throughout the region. According to accounts from the 16th century, the stone temples were covered in stucco and decorated with blue and red paint. The three main temples that comprise the Cross Complex are aligned to form a cross. The Temple of the Foliated Cross is directly across the courtyard from the Temple of the Sun, and both are adjacent to the Temple of the Cross. Temple XIV and Temple XV are two smaller temples are found between the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Cross. The picture to the left is a reconstruction as seen from the Temple of the Foliated Cross, although Temple XV is missing from the illustration. Bas-reliefs Temple of the Foliated Cross Temple of the Cross.Miller 1999, p. 9. Bas-relief carvings in the Temple of the Cross describe the accession of K'inich Kan Balam to the throne of Palenque. Within the inner chamber of these temples bas-relief carvings are found, depicting two figures. At first scientists thought that the smaller figure was K'inich Janaab' Pakal, Kan Bahlum's father, and that the bigger figure was K'inich Kan B'ahlam himself. Now, with a greater knowledge of iconography and epigraphy, it is believed that both figurines represent Kan Bahlum: one in his youth at the ritual of passage, and the other at adulthood representing his accession to the throne. Between these figures is the Ceiba, also known as the World Tree.S√°enz 1956 Representing paths to the Otherworld, each one of the three temples is also dedicated to a certain god in the Palenque triad. These paths to the Otherworld were crucial for the reigning king, since he must take them in order to bring back gifts of life and prosperity to his people. In this group of temples, the most significant is the Temple of the Cross which is associated with the God GI, the first born in the triad, also known as Hunahpu. Human by aspect, he is fable than his brothers because he has a shell earflare, a square-eye and a fish fin on his cheek. He is known to wear the quadripartite Monster as a headdress and he is also associated with the so-called Waterbird. What should be remembered is that Kan-bahlum lived and reigned before any of the triad Gods and that he constructed and built these temples so that the triad gods could put their mark on them.Miller & Taube 2003, p.157 Notes References   External links *www.mayaruins.com *www.head-over-heels.net *palenquepark.com *mayaruins.com Palenque Buildings and structures in Mesoamerica ","title":"Temple of the Cross Complex"},{"id":"36530753","text":"Colin John Huxford (born 26 May 1944) is an English former footballer who played in the Football League for Swindon Town.

In the early 13th century, the church included a nave with north and south aisles extending as far west as the present east arch of the tower, and a chancel of the present size. In the late 14th century, the rector and 6th Earl of Arundel carried out considerable alterations. The nave and aisles were extended west, the old west wall being penetrated by three arches, new windows were inserted in the aisles and the chancel and the tower in the south-west corner was potentially erected; following these changes, the church reached its current size. In the early 16th century, the 11th Earl of Arundel refashioned the nave in the existing Gothic perpendicular style, replacing thick pillars and round arches with tall slender pillars and three centered flat arches. The chancel was raised and widened, and the north porch was built ‚Äì at the same time, the present west tower was built and its predecessor was taken down (the remains of a pier is still visible inside the church on the south wall of the south aisle) In 1545, the Avenue of Yew Trees was planted: it is believed that it is the oldest in the United Kingdom. In 1598, the north and south galleries were erected over the aisles, dormer windows were added, a flat ceiling was added to the nave and the singing gallery was erected under the tower. In 1770, the then-Lord of the Manor the 2nd Earl of Halifax added a spire to the tower. The spire originally had an external gallery and an ornament. In 1797, the church was re-floored partly with Purbeck stone and brick, new pews were installed, old choir stalls in the chancel were cleared and painted glass was taken out of the chancel windows. In 1860, the gallery and ornament were removed from the spire and pinnacles were removed from the tower. In 1865, extensive restoration was carried out. boxed pews, galleries and flat ceilings were cleared away, dormer windows were removed, new pine pews were placed in the church and the south porch was built. The original stone north porch was dismantled and rebuilt in oak. These changes were described by architectural scholar Nikolaus Pevsner as being \\"really unpleasant\\". In 1876, the organ chamber was built and new choir seating was installed, and Philip Mainwaring Johnston undertook further work in 1932‚Äì33. In 1957, the spire was re-shingled and the weather vane that had been blown away in 1894 was re-erected. In 1978, the vestry was extended and in 1981 the church was re-floored in stone. All of the stained glass present today was placed in the windows between 1865 and 1912, with the exception of the west window to the south aisle that was made from a collection of older glass and placed in the window in 1840. The church graveyard was closed to new burials in 1859 and is still lined by a fine wall. In 1892, a tin church was built in the nearby village of Woodmancote and was incorporated into the benefice of Westbourne. Worship Each Sunday, Parish Communion and Evensong take place in the morning and evening respectively; on Wednesday, a service of Holy Communion also takes place. St John the Baptist uses the Book of Common Prayer and Common Worship and also offers services directed at families and children - including a cr√®che, Sunday school and various youth groups. Like many other English churches, music is an important part of worship as there is a strong choral foundation that is responsible for providing choral music. Organ The first record of an organ at the church was made in 1819, although little is known about the instrument. In 1862, a one manual organ constructed by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd was installed - it was enlarged fourteen years later to include a second manual (Swell division) In 1890, W. J. Haywood of London carried out additions to the organ, including an 8' reed to the swell and 16' Open Wood to the pedals. Hele & Co of Plymouth rebuilt the organ in 1967, and notably replaced the mechanical action with electro-pneumatic action. In 2001, Kenneth Tickell & Co built a new organ that remains in use today. *The organ, on the church website *Details of the Kenneth Tickell organ from the National Pipe Register Bells Originally the church had four bells, as recorded in 1724, but the number has risen to six in 1770 and then to eight in 1933. At present the church uses full-circle ringing and the bells are rung for each of the Sunday services. The heaviest bell, a tenor bell, weighs almost half a ton and forms an octave with the other bells.

Filmed in 1969, it was first screened the following year. The work was commissioned by Westdeutscher Rundfunk for the bicentennial celebrations of the birth of Ludwig van Beethoven in 1970. The film examines the reception of the composer and his works and how he has become a consumer product of the culture industry. The soundtrack is an arrangement of fragments of Beethoven's works, modified as if heard by the deaf composer himself; it is distinct from Kagel's 1970 composition Ludwig van. Prominent contemporary artists including Dieter Roth, Stefan Wewerka (de), Robert Filliou, and Joseph Beuys were involved in the design. According to Gramophone, \\"at first it‚Äôs a laugh a minute ... then Kagel's film turns dark\\". Summary In the first part of the film, Beethoven visits Bonn of the late 1960s, stopping off at a record shop before embarking upon a tour of the Beethoven-Haus in which he was born; there is a deluge of busts, in the music room every surface is covered in sheet music, and in the final scene his works are hung out to dry in the laundry. There ensues a bridge passage in which he strolls along the Rhine and boards the Cecilie, where he tries to find the source of music but ends up chasing shadows. The second part of the film, a more explicit parody of art films and commentary on the composer's reception, begins with a talk-show in which Karajan is criticised for creating beautiful sound at the expense of revolutionary edge and for conducting the orchestra rather than the music; there follows an encounter with a madman who claims to be Beethoven's true descendant; a sequence set to In questa tomba oscura (\\"In this dark tomb let me rest\\"); a scene with a pianist in a lab; and a recital of the Waldstein sonata by a thinly-disguised and super-annuated Elly Ney, where she ends up smoking and the percussive sound morphs into the beating of the heart; the film ends with a scene in a zoo with an owl, tortoise, boar, defecating elephant, and \\"many ruminants, predominantly ears and paws\\", accompanied by fragments of the \\"Prisoners' chorus\\" from Fidelio and of the Ode to Joy from the Ninth Symphony. Analysis A deconstructive analysis of the film investigated Beethoven as a cultural icon, revered yet exploited; the use and misuse of his works, including their appropriation to advance nationalist agendas; the difficulties and anxieties of influence performers face; Beethoven scholarship and attempts to \\"tame\\" the composer to accord with bourgeois ideals; and the difficulties of peering through the myths to catch a glimpse of the \\"real\\" Beethoven. Kagel uses the term Musealisierung or \\"musealisation\\" in speaking of the Beethoven cult, the term used by Theodor W. Adorno to indicate that \\"museums are the family sepulchres of works of art\\".

It stars Ettore Petrolini as the main actor. It has been described as a \\"Roman farce\\", a genre which was popular in Italy at the time. It is a parody of the Roman Empire and of the notorious Roman emperor, Nero. It was shot at the Cines Studios in Rome. According to some critics, this parody was actually a satire against the fascist dictatorship and Benito Mussolini. A full copy of the film no longer exists; there are only several excerpts that were included in the documentary Antologia Petrolini that was edited by the National Film Library and was shown at the 1952 Venice Film Festival.  Synopsis  The film features some unforgettable characters (more precisely in Italian: macchiette) created by Ettore Petrolini: Gastone, Fortunello and Nero. Nero, who rides a bicycle, which burns Rome with a match, then calls the fire department by phone from the imperial palace. There is also Petrolini in his dressing room surrounded by admirers, including a young girl who returns to the theater the next day, between the two was born a flirt, but the actor will not leave the theater to go out with her.Luca Verdone, I film di Alessandro Blasetti, pp. 65-66, Rome, 1989.

The finalists were announced on 4 June 2014 and were: ‚Ä¢ Barton Willmore, led by James Gross. Barton Willmore is the UK‚Äôs largest independent planning led town-planning and design consultancy. Barton Willmore's entry sets out a ten-point plan for the delivery of a new garden city, arguing for the development of a cross-party consensus and the production of a National Spatial Plan to identify suitable locations for new garden cities. Garden City Mayors, heading up Garden City Commissions, would be appointed to champion garden cities and find specific locations for development. ‚Ä¢ Chris Blundell FRICS FCIH, Director of Development & Regeneration at Golding Homes. Chris is a development professional with over 30 years‚Äô experience and has entered in a personal capacity with the support of Golding Homes. His entry argues that a garden city should accommodate between 30,000 and 40,000 people (about the size of Letchworth) and that its delivery should be led by Garden City Development Corporations. ‚Ä¢ David Rudlin of URBED, with Nicholas Falk (also URBED) and input from Jon Rowland (John Rowland Urban Design), Joe Ravetz (Manchester University) and Peter Redman (Managing Director, Policy and Research at TradeRisks Ltd). URBED is an urban design and research practice. David‚Äôs entry argues for the near-doubling of an existing large town in line with garden city principles, to provide new housing for 150,000 people (about the size of Oxford or Canterbury). The entry offers a proof of this ‚Äòurban extension‚Äô concept based on a fictional town called Uxcester. ‚Ä¢ Shelter, the leading housing and homelessness charity, led by their Head of Policy Toby Lloyd. This entry proposes a new garden city on the Hoo Peninsula (Medway, Kent) commencing with a settlement of up to 48,000 people (about the size of Welwyn Garden City) at Stoke Harbour as part of a larger cluster of settlements eventually totaling 150,000 people.) The entry proposes a model designed to attract massive private investment into the provision of high quality homes, jobs, services and infrastructure. The delivery model prioritises speed and volume over profit margins, aims to acquire land at low cost and transfer valuable assets to a Community Trust for the long term. Local people would be offered unique opportunities to invest in the city, including through buying shares. ‚Ä¢ Wei Yang & Partners in collaboration with Buro Happold Consulting Engineers, led by Pat Willoughby. Wei Yang & Partners is a London-based practice with an international portfolio of master planning, town planning, urban design and architectural projects. Dr Yang is also advising the Chinese Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development on its urbanization programme. Their entry argues that an ‚Äòarc‚Äô beyond the London Green Belt (stretching from Portsmouth to Oxford to Cambridge to Felixstowe) is the best location for the development of new garden cities; and that the Government should publish a New Garden Cities Strategy identifying broad ‚Äòareas of search‚Äô for suitable locations, with a 30-year timescale. =Winning Entry= The 2014 prize was announced on September 3, 2014, at an awards ceremony in London.

Fekete, 5 January 2012 In his Daily Telegraph column, business journalist Jeremy Warner suggested that \\"there is no need for an award\\", since he has a \\"very simple plan\\": In any country that decided to leave the Eurozone, each euro would be swapped for one \\"new euro\\" plus units in the country's new currency in proportion to the country's share of eurozone GDP. For instance, if Greece were to leave, the euro would be split 97.5 percent \\"new euro\\" and 2.5 percent \\"new drachmas\\". Capital Economics, in their entry, stated that a country contemplating leaving the euro would have to \\"keep its plans secret until the last minute,\\" introduce capital controls, start \\"printing\\" a new currency only after formal exit, seek a large depreciation, default on its debts, recapitalise busted banks and seek close co-operation with remaining eurozone members. \\"Such a rebalancing of the economy away from reliance on net exports would be in the interests of the whole of the current membership of the eurozone, as well as countries outside it‚Äù. The short list of finalists\\"Eurozone exit plan wins Wolfson Economics Prize\\", The Independent, 5 July 2012 was: *Roger Bootle leading the team from Capital Economics *Jens Nordvig and Nick Firoozye from Nomura Securities *Neil Record from Record Currency Management *Jonathan Tepper from Variant Perception *Cathy Dobbs, a private investor =Winning Entry= On 5 July 2012, Policy Exchange announced\\"Roger Bootle named winner of the Wolfson Economics Prize\\", Policy Exchange press release, 5 July 2012 that the winning entry was submitted by the team led by Roger Bootle from Macroeconomics research consultancy firm Capital Economics, titled Leaving the Euro: A Practical Guide. The proposal recommended that member-states who want to exit should introduce a new currency and default on a large part of their debts. The net effect, the proposal claimed, would be \\"positive for growth and prosperity\\". It called for keeping the euro for small transactions and for a short period of time after the exit from the Eurozone, along with a strict regime of inflation-targeting and tough fiscal rules monitored by \\"independent experts\\". The Roger Bootle/Capital Economics plan also suggested that \\"key officials\\" should meet \\"in secret\\" one month before the exit is publicly announced, and that Eurozone partners and international organisations should be informed \\"three days before\\". Roger Bootle said, after the announcement, \\"if executed correctly, the pain of exit would relatively soon be replaced by a return to growth,\\" something that would encourage other distressed states still in the currency zone to exit as well, adding > \\"The biggest danger of contagion will be if Greece makes a success of > leaving the monetary union\\".

It is also known as site \\"Test Site B6\\". Overview The U.S. Army Ranger facility Camp Rudder is located here. It is designated Site B-6. The airfield remains under the ownership of the United States Air Force, and is under the jurisdiction of the 96th Air Base Wing (96 ABW) at Eglin AFB. History Auxiliary Field 6 is named Biancur Field for 1st Lieutenant Andrew Biancur, a test pilot of the Medium Bombardment Section of the 1st Proving Ground Group, killed 8 January 1944 in the crash of a prototypeYP-61-NO Black Widow night fighter aircraft, AAF Ser. No. 41-18883, c/n 711, at Eglin Field. The history of Biancur Field is largely unknown, and the exact date of construction of Biancur Field is undetermined. It was opened in 1943 and was constructed in a similar manner to a fully equipped base with three 4,000-foot runways, a large parking ramp, at least one hangar and numerous support buildings. The airfield was expanded sometime after the war, with an 8,000-foot jet-capable runway laid down over the north/south runway, Runway 18/36. The airfield was incorporated into Eglin AFB on 9 October 1959 and was subsequently inactivated. During the early-60s (and specifically October 1962, the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis), Field 6 was used for \\"touch & goes\\" by the Navy's VT-4 out of Sherman Field, NAS Pensacola. As there was no mess hall, food was brought in from the Army Ranger's at nearby Field 7. Biancur was reactivated in 1970 as an Army Special Forces group facility, led by COL Arthur D. \\"Bull\\" Simons, USA, for training select Army Special Forces USAF Air Commando forces before deploying to Thailand for the attempted rescue on 20-21 Nov 1970 of US prisoners of war at the Son Tay prison camp in North Vietnam (Operation Ivory Coast). Afterwards, the United States Army Ranger training camp at Epler Field (Eglin AFB Auxiliary Field #7) moved to Biancur Field to provide realistic jungle/swamp training. Today the ground station has numerous modern buildings and the north-south airfield runway has been updated for use by helicopters with several hangars. Several UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters are parked on the ramp in recent aerial imagery of the airfield. The airfield also supports other USAF, DoD and other U.S. government agency requirements as necessary, one example being the NASA X-43 low-speed demonstrator that underwent testing out of Auxiliary Field 6 in November 2003.NASA.gov.

It was moved to a compound at Auxiliary Field 6 in November 1969, and served as a minimum security facility for non-violent offenders where it would gain the nickname \\"Club Fed\\". The facility was closed in 2006 as a cost-cutting measure, with most of the prisoners transferred to the Pensacola Federal Prison Camp at the former NAS Saufley Field, now part of the greater NAS Pensacola complex, in December 2005.

It is one of 17 medical schools in Canada and the only one in the province of British Columbia. It has Canada's second-largest undergraduate medical education program and the fifth-largest in the U.S. and Canada. It is ranked as the 2nd best medical program in Canada by Maclean's, and 27th in the world by the 2017 QS World University Rankings. History and educational programs The Faculty of Medicine was established in 1950 in Vancouver, taking in 60 medical students under the leadership of its first dean, Myron Weaver. The size of its incoming medical classes was increased to 80 students in 1974, 120 students in 1980, and 128 students in 2000. Starting in 2004, the medical program began a gradual expansion that more than doubled enrollment and distributed medical education and training at campuses, hospitals and clinics throughout the province. The size of incoming medical classes grew to 288, with one-third of those students spending most of their four years at one of three distributed sites in northern British Columbia, the B.C. Interior or Vancouver Island. The size and geographic scope of the Faculty of Medicine's 71 medical residency programs also grew correspondingly. Since its founding, the Faculty has added other educational programs, including physical therapy, occupational science and occupational therapy, audiology and speech sciences, midwifery, and population and public health.  Research  Most research by the UBC Faculty of Medicine is conducted under the auspices of six institutes and 15 centres that are part of UBC or affiliated with it. Some researchers are based at UBC's Vancouver campus, though many work in the Faculty of Medicine's affiliated hospitals, especially in Vancouver: Vancouver General Hospital, the BC Cancer Agency, St. Paul's Hospital, BC Women's Hospital + Health Centre and BC Children's Hospital. In the 2015-16 fiscal year, the Faculty of Medicine took in $353 million in research funding, from government, industry, foundations and non-profit organizations and other sources. Members of the Faculty of Medicine are responsible for 132 patents issued or filed, and the creation of six spin-off companies. The Faculty of Medicine has more than 300 postdoctoral fellows and almost 600 PhD students. The Faculty of Medicine had one Nobel laureate, Professor of Biochemistry Michael Smith, who received the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in developing site- directed mutagenesis. Smith also received the Canada Gairdner International Award in 1986. Two members of the Faculty have received the Canada Gairdner Wightman Award: James C. Hogg (2013) and Michael Hayden (2011). Julio Montaner has received several awards for demonstrating the effectiveness of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) in the treatment of HIV infection, and championing the \\"Treatment as Prevention\\" strategy for controlling the spread of the disease.

He was the son of Willam Stanger and Mary Dent. He studied medicine and natural science at Edinburgh University, and after returning from a trip to Australia and New Zealand, ran a practice in London for some time. William Stanger took part as geologist and doctor in the ill- fated 1841 British expedition to the Niger. Three vessels steamed about 320 miles up the Niger and Chadda. Treaties were signed with the two black Princes of Eboe and Iddah, agreeing to the abolition of the slave trade and of human sacrifices, and the signatories were then left to resume their normal practices. An extract from a letter written on board the \\"√Üthiope\\" on 21 October 1841 - \\"We entered the Nun on the 10th inst., and proceeded up the river the next morning, and fell in with the \\"Albert\\" on the evening of the 13th inst. at Stirling Island, about 24 miles below Eboe. We found her in a worse state than the \\"Wilberforce\\"; all hands down with fever but for Drs M'William, Stanger, a scientific gentleman, a marine, the boatswain's mate, and a servant. Captain Trotter very weak, Captain Bird Allen (who is since dead) very low; no engineers; Dr. Stanger was endeavouring to work the engine the best way he could. We sent our head engineer on board, and the \\"Albert\\" followed the \\"√Üthiope\\" to the coast. Captain Becroft then went on board the \\"Albert\\", and took her to Fernando Po.\\" - The Times, 27 January 1842 And from the report of Captain Trotter: \\"From want of engineers we should have had to drop down the whole length of the river without steam, had not Dr. Stanger, the geologist, in the most spirited manner, after consulting Tredgold's work on steam, and getting some little instruction from the convalescent engineer, undertaken to work the engine himself. The heat of the engine-room affected the engineer so much as to throw him back in his convalescence, and prevent him rendering any further assistance, but Dr. Stanger took the vessel safely below Eboe, without anything going wrong with the machinery.\\" The Times, 27 January 1842 Stanger arrived in poor health in the Cape in 1843. He came highly commended by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and immediately started on surveying the route for the proposed road joining Cape Town to Grahamstown. In 1845 he was appointed surveyor-general in Natal. One of Stanger's first tasks was fixing Natal's exact boundary and mapping its main geographical features, publishing a topographical map in 1848. Following on this he carried out a survey of Durban, Pietermaritzburg and smaller villages, and planned the route of the main road between Durban and Pietermaritzburg. Stanger erected the small building which later housed the Natal Training College in Pietermaritzburg, and which became Government House in 1850, having been acquired by Sir Benjamin Pine, Lieutenant Governor of Natal (1850-1855).Standard Encyclopaedia of Southern Africa According to an obituary in The Lancet, Stanger suffered a premature death as a consequence of the so- called hydropathic treatment. A horseback ride from Pietermaritzburg to Port Natal (Durban) had exhausted him, and he was persuaded to 'submit to the application of the \\"wet shed\\". The next day inflammation of the lungs took place, which carried him off in one week'. Botany was one of Stanger's enduring interests and the genus Stangeria was named in his honour, as was the small town of Stanger in Natal, laid out in March 1873 by the incumbent surveyor-general Dr. P.C. Sutherland and named after his late predecessor. The town of Stanger, now known as KwaDukuza on the north coast of Kwazulu-Natal was named after him. William Stanger is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of lizard, Chioninia stangeri.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles.

The first started during midday; it has affected 13,800 hectares (included in this are some 3,000 hectares of crops that have not burned) 19 municipalities and caused two deaths. The fire of Portbou, moreover, began at 19:00 and was controlled in a few hours, burning 50 hectares and killing two people trying to flee the encroaching flames by jumping from the cliffs into the sea. In total, 3,200 residents were left without electricity and 1,700 without phone. Precedents This was the largest fire in the area since 1986. Between July 17‚Äì24 of 1986 a serious fire burned out of control, devastating 26,000 hectares and killing the four man crew of a French seaplane. On August 7, 2000 a fire began in Cap de Creus that burned 6,513 hectares; much of the Parc Natural. Context Both fires occurred during a summer very conducive to fires as Catalonia has suffered major droughts in the past 40 years. In addition, many forests were in poor condition after the snowstorm of 2010. In February, 2012 the Fire Department had reported to Parliament that the cuts would undermine their work, \\"reducing their capacity by 378,000 working hours of what the country will need for summer.\\" La Jonquera fire Area affected by the fires of la Jonquera The first of two fires that affected the region was declared a little before noon on July 2, 2012 at the edges of the 779th kilometer N-II (in parking lot of trucks about 500 meters from the border crossing with France). Of the two fires, this was the most devastating in terms of the amount of land affected (about 14,000 hectares). =Causes= The disaster was caused by negligence, as noted by the President of the Generalitat of Catalonia, Artur Mas, from the fire station in Figueres. The Minister of Interior, Felip Puig said that the fire‚Äîjust like what happened to Portbou‚Äîbegan on the shoulder of the road; later the forest rangers found hundreds of cigarette butts in the area where the fire originated, which gave further strength to the hypothesis that the fire had been caused by human negligence. =Path of the fire= La Jonquera fire seen from the road of Puig de Fontreda, Ceret to Puig de les Pedrisses (Morell√†s i les Illes) on Jul 23, 2012 The fire spread very quickly, fueled by the strong tramuntana winds and affecting almost 14,000 hectares, from Albera National Park down, nearly to the town of Figueres. This composition of the area was 51% were trees, 22% crops, and 19% brush. Of the 14,000 hectares, 3,000 (containing agricultural crops) were not burned. The fire threatened the towns of Llers and Capmany reaching homes and burning some in Jonquera and Agullana. At points, the flames reached five meters in height. The increasingly strong southwest and eastern winds created fears that fire would enter into the Garrotxa region and affect the Garrotxa Volcanic Natural Park, thus making it more difficult to combat the fire on land due to the dense forest and the topography of the land. According to Felip Puig, Minister of Interior of the Generalitat of Catalonia they are currently working to protect the most sensitive points around Terrades, southern Boadella, Darnius and Agullana, and the northern regions of el Pert√∫s and Cantallops. =Consequences= The la Jonquera fire left two people dead: the first, suffered a heart attack in the town of Llers, after being trapped by flames in the garden of his home and the second died after suffering burns to 80% of the body in an explosion of fuel tanks in Agullana. Eight people were hospitalized, six of them serious injuries. Furthermore, several sections of the northern part of la Jonquera were evacuated along with some farms and residential areas that were far removed from urban centers of the Alt Empord√†. As soon as the fire was declared, they AP-7 and N-II were closed to traffic along with several county roads and the AVE line to la Jonquera. Due to the fire, the electricity company, Endesa estimated that more than 3,000 people in 21 towns remained without power. The authorities required a curfew for the entire population of Alt Empord√† from the afternoon of 22nd which was slowly revoked in later days. Some 1,300 people spent the nights of 22nd and 23rd in emergency shelters in the region. The 19 municipalities affected were as follows: la Jonquera, Agullana, Darnius, Boadella i les Escaules, Terrades, Vilarnadal, Avinyonet de Puigvent√≥s, Vilafant, Figueres, Llers, Pont de Molins, Biure, Masarac, Cabanes, Sant Climent Sescebes, Capmany, Cantallops, Vilanant i Cistella. The smoke and smell of the fire was encountered in Barcelona as well as further south. Smoke was also seen around C√©ret, France. The region is a well known grower of wine grapes and olives which form a large portion of income for the region. Overall, most of the vineyards were not affected by the fire as they acted as a natural firebreak due to how they are cultivated. Some were immersed in a considerable amount of smoke, but did not burn. =Aftermath= The fire left many trees and shrubs burnt around La Jonquera, although little of the town's structures were burnt. The final death toll was four. Fire damage near Pont de Molnis Portbou fire Alongside the fire started in la Jonquera, another started in the municipality of Portbou, in the northeast area of Alt Empord√†, near the border with France. It started on Sunday, the 22nd July at 19:00 and three hours later, at 22:00, it was already under control. =Causes= The mayor of Portbou, Jos√© Luis Salas, said that the fire could have been caused by a cigarette thrown from the road, just like the fire started in the Jonquera. Some sources suggest that the fire started near the gas station in the town.

Conditions  A concrete composition not composed by the standard EN 206‚Äì1, can be acknowledged, only if the new concrete shows a performance equal to the standardized concrete concerning environmental classes. Cement content and water-cement ratio are important elements hereby. The comparison with standardized concrete is tested according to the following properties: *Compressive strength *Resistance to carbonatation *Chloride migration *Freeze-thaw resistance *Other possible requirements When the new concrete scores equally or better, a certificate of utilization can be obtained from certificating organizations.  Standardization  The valid standards concerning concrete are: * EN 206-1: determines minimum requirements of concrete composition for different environmental classes. * NBN B15-100: Belgian annex * CUR recommendation 48: Dutch annex These national annexes serve to elaborate the functional description of the Equivalent Concrete Performance Concept.  Concrete composition  Standardized concrete is a highly durable material, predominantly thanks to the increasing amount of cement at stricter environmental classes. But cement is a costly component and has a relatively powerful impact on the environment. Partly because of this, alternative binders such as fly ashes and slags are applied in the concrete sector. As a result, the content of Portland cement can be reduced in many cases. Other recycled raw materials can also contribute to a more economic or less environmental polluting concrete composition. 1\\\\.

UCSB's earliest predecessor was the Anna S. C. Blake Manual Training School, named after Anna S.C. Blake, a sloyd-school which was established in 1891. From there, the school underwent several transformations, most notably its takeover by the University of California system in 1944.  Early years  Anna S. C. Blake founded the Anna S. C. Blake Manual Training School in 1891 and offered courses in home economics and industrial arts. Blake, who modeled her curriculum after the sloyd method, would ultimately rely on her neighbor, Ednah Rich, to run the school after sending Rich to study the sloyd method in Boston, Sweden, and Germany. Rich would become principal of the school in 1896. In May 1898, Blake, nearing the end of her life, deeded the school to the city of Santa Barbara, California as part of the Santa Barbara public schooling system. The deed was officially transferred on July 1, 1899, just months after Blake's death. The Anna Blake School was taken over by the state in 1909 and became the Santa Barbara State Normal School of Manual Art and Home Economics. The campus was on the Riviera in Santa Barbara, portions of which house today's Riviera Theatre. By 1913, the Riviera neighborhood was established and housing for up to 40 faculty and students built. (This housing is today's El Encanto Hotel.)Baker, Gayle, Santa Barbara, HarborTown Histories, Santa Barbara, CA, 2003, p.82-83, (print) 9780987903815 (on-line) In 1921, it was renamed Santa Barbara State Teachers College. It began to expand its curriculum to become a more liberal arts college, and it became authorized to grant four-year degrees. Then, in 1935 the college changed its name once again and became known as the Santa Barbara State College, offering broader curricula in both teaching and the liberal arts. Growth was so rapid that a new campus was needed. When the 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake destroyed Dibblee's imposing stone mansion, Punta Del Castillo, on the cliff overlooking the harbor, land was available, and, by 1932, it had been purchased for the college. Remains of the mansion were cleared and the stone was used to build the retaining wall on Cliff Drive. The first building was completed in 1941.Baker, Gayle, p. 83. Takeover by the University of California Intense lobbying by an interest group in the City of Santa Barbara, led by Thomas Storke and Pearl Chase, persuaded the State Legislature, Governor Earl Warren, and the Regents of the University of California to move the State College over to the more research-oriented University of California system in 1944. The State College system sued to stop the takeover, but the Governor did not support the suit. A state initiative was passed, however, to stop subsequent conversions of State Colleges to University of California campuses. From 1944 to 1958 the school was known as Santa Barbara College of the University of California, before taking on its current name. MCAS Santa Barbara munitions bunker currently being used as storage by UCSB Originally, the Regents envisioned a small, several thousand-student liberal arts college, a so-called \\"Williams College of the West\\", at Santa Barbara. Chronologically, UCSB is the third general-education campus of the University of California, after Berkeley and UCLA (the only other state campus to have been acquired by the UC system). The original campus the Regents acquired in Santa Barbara was located on only of largely unusable land on a seaside mesa. The availability of a portion of the land used as Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara until 1946 on another seaside mesa in Goleta, which the Regents could acquire for free from the federal government, led to that site becoming the Santa Barbara campus in 1949. Unstable campus leadership During UCSB's first 50 years after joining UC, a recurring theme in its history was a pronounced lack of stability in campus leadership. The Board of Regents were originally reluctant to accept Santa Barbara into the University of California. The existing UC faculty looked down upon the State College faculty and recommended to the Regents that Santa Barbara could only join UC under harsh conditions: Santa Barbara was to remain a small \\"regional college\\" with a separate and lower salary scale for its faculty, who would not be allowed to join the Academic Senate. Clarence L. Phelps, the president of the state college, stayed on as the first provost of the new Santa Barbara campus. Unfortunately, Phelps was badly hampered by the change in management and the Regents' desire to keep Santa Barbara small, as well as World War II and its attendant constraints on construction. He retired in 1946. The Regents allowed the new campus to languish for almost a decade under its second provost, J. Harold Williams, who enraged the faculty at Santa Barbara by refusing to actually move to the campus he was supposed to be managing. Williams continued to maintain his home in Los Angeles and stayed in an apartment in Santa Barbara on weekdays. In 1955, Williams was succeeded as provost by Clark G. Kuebler, but Kuebler resigned after only nine months, when he was accused of propositioning a male detective he had just met while visiting New York City to recruit faculty members. Kuebler maintained his innocence and the charges were later dropped, but his UC career was over. The campus then cycled through two acting provosts. The combination of Phelps's lame-duck wartime management, followed by Williams's indifferent long-distance management from Los Angeles, and then rapid local turnover meant there was no stable leader in residence at Santa Barbara from 1944 to 1959. One positive development during these dark years was that the Academic Senate finally allowed the Santa Barbara faculty to join in 1956. None of these issues went unnoticed by Storke, the publisher of the local newspaper, who was appointed to the Board of Regents in 1955 and was finally in a position to do something about them. In October 1957, Clark Kerr was selected by the Regents as the next UC President, and after that fateful board meeting, Storke said twice to Kerr for emphasis: \\"Don‚Äôt forget Santa Barbara.\\" Kerr replied, \\"Tom, I can't forget Santa Barbara and I won't. The university needs Santa Barbara now.\\" At that time, Santa Barbara was primarily known for being a \\"party school\\" with its \\"ocean beach and surfing.\\" There was little research output, there were no doctorate programs, the campus library only had 101,000 volumes, and admissions requirements were not as stringent as other UC campuses (an issue belatedly fixed in 1959). On September 17, 1958, the Board of Regents voted to accept Kerr's recommendation: \\"The Santa Barbara campus will become a general campus of the university ... with graduate programs leading to the highest degrees.\\" The campus name was changed to the \\"University of California, Santa Barbara\\" (UCSB). As of 1958, the campus's strongest and most famous program was its Department of Industrial Arts. The Regents saw \\"shop work\\" as beneath the dignity of a research university and made sure it was eliminated, despite protests from its counterparts at other colleges and universities as well as California high schools (who considered it an excellent source of industrial arts teachers). The UCSB College of Letters and Science was created in 1961. From state college to research university Samuel B. Gould was appointed as UCSB's first chancellor in 1959, but lasted only until 1962. Although Gould was gregarious and had excellent public relations skills, the faculty was greatly disappointed to not get an academic superstar of the caliber of Nobel laureate Glenn T. Seaborg (then serving as chancellor at Berkeley), and Gould was disappointed when he realized he would not be immediately promoted to lead a more prestigious campus like Berkeley or UCLA. In 1959, UCSB Professor Douwe Stuurman hosted the English writer Aldous Huxley as the University's first visiting professor. Huxley delivered a lecture series called \\"The Human Situation\\".https://www.amazon.com/Human-Situation-Lectures-Given- Barbara/dp/0701121432 Vernon Cheadle served as UCSB's second chancellor from 1962 to 1977. He initially provided needed stability and able leadership, and gave Storke and other Santa Barbara boosters what they had desired for so long: the transformation of the state college into a research university. However, during the late 1960s and early 1970s, UCSB became nationally known as a hotbed of anti-Vietnam War activity as well as radical activity in general. On April 11, 1969, a bombing at the school's faculty club killed the caretaker, Dover Sharp. In 1970, the campus and surrounding community were ravaged by protests and associated violence and arson. On February 25, William Kunstler spoke to an audience of several thousand students in Harder Stadium about his defense of the Chicago Seven at their recent trial (in which the verdicts had just come in a week earlier), and finished by calling upon the students: \\"Fill the streets so they can see you! Power to the People!\\" During the ensuing unrest that afternoon and evening, the Bank of America branch building in the student community of Isla Vista was burned down on the third attempt.http://www.ucsbalum.com/Coastlines/2010/Winter/bank.html accessed May 17, 2015. In response, Governor Ronald Reagan flew to Santa Barbara the next day and declared a state of emergency. He imposed a curfew and ordered the National Guard to enforce it. Weapon-carrying guardsmen were a common sight on campus and in Isla Vista during this tense period. Bank of America refused to leave Isla Vista and established a temporary branch in a trailer, which became the site of further demonstrations. At one of those, on April 17, 1970, a male student, Kevin Moran, was shot and killed by a deputy sheriff. The burning of Bank of America was a watershed moment in UCSB history that changed the university's public image forever. From 1969 to 1972, enrollment dropped from 13,254 to 11,828, and the political alignment of UCSB's student body rapidly shifted from the right to the left. After Bank of America belatedly departed Isla Vista in 1981, UCSB later bought its former building and renovated it into a state-of-the-art lecture venue now known as Embarcadero Hall. According to future UC President David P. Gardner (who was working at UCSB at the time), Cheadle had started off as a strong and decisive leader, but was severely traumatized by these developments and became much more passive in the later years of his chancellorship. From 1972 to 1977, the campus was actually administered by Vice Chancellor Alec Alexander. Alexander, an economist, reallocated faculty appointments from departments in decline to up-and-coming departments, which helped lay the foundation for UCSB's long-term success. With time, other flaws in Cheadle's chancellorship became clear. Incompetent long-range planning both on- and off-campus squandered the magnificent architectural possibilities afforded by the only UC beachfront campus location, which is why today, both the campus and Isla Vista are notorious for a hodgepodge of architectural styles and disorganized layouts. UCSB's \\"party school\\" image was magnified by the excessive proportion of undergraduates, which in turn arose from Cheadle's failure to establish graduate schools in law, business, and medicine during the 1960s when it would have been most financially feasible to do so. The 1980s and 1990s Chancellors Robert Huttenback (1978-1986) and Barbara Uehling (1987-1994) both lost the confidence of the UCSB faculty and did not leave office at times of their choosing. Huttenback came to UCSB from Caltech and was credited with recruiting high-quality faculty in engineering and physical sciences. One such recruit later recalled that Huttenback insisted on personally picking him up at Los Angeles International Airport, in order to personally deliver the hard sell while driving back to Santa Barbara along the picturesque Pacific Coast Highway. Ironically, Huttenback was a specialist on the history of British imperialism who alienated the faculty, the student body, and much of the community with his imperial arrogance. Huttenback's downfall occurred when he was accused in April 1986 of embezzlement of university funds for remodeling his off-campus residence the year before. UC Presidents Gardner and David S. Saxon both testified at Huttenback's trial that he did not have their authorization to spend university funds on such a personal expense, and as a result, Huttenback and his wife Freda were both convicted by a Santa Maria jury in July 1988. Uehling's reputation was damaged when she was arrested for driving under the influence the week before she was to become chancellor (although the criminal charge was later reduced to reckless driving). Unlike Huttenback, she was able to maintain good community relations, but ended up resigning in order to avoid an impending vote of no confidence by the UCSB Academic Senate. Recent history =Academic Excellence Recognized= In 1995, UCSB was elected to the Association of American Universities, an organization of leading research universities, with a membership consisting of 59 universities in the United States (both public and private) and two universities in Canada. Since 2000, UCSB faculty have won five Nobel Prizes, significantly strengthening the academic profile and image of the University. = Abortion protest incident = In March 2014, an associate professor of feminist studies, Mireille Miller-Young, was charged with battery, theft and vandalism after she allegedly stole and destroyed a sign from a Pro-life demonstrator, who was protesting in an area of the UCSB campus designated as a ‚Äúfree speech zone.‚Äù The sign depicted graphic imagery of aborted fetuses, and Professor Miller-Young responded by allegedly stealing the sign from one of the demonstrators, a 16-year-old girl who was identified as a member of the group Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust, and when the girl tried to take the sign back, the professor allegedly pushed and scratched her. The University initially stated that it would not publicly comment on personnel matters. However, UCSB's Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs, Michael D. Young, issued a statement supporting free speech on campus, while also accusing outside groups of trying to create divisions in the campus community. Although Miller-Young initially pleaded not guilty, she changed her plea to no contest in July 2014, and was sentenced to three years probation; 108 hours of community service; and 10 hours of anger management classes. In November 2014, the anti-abortion group involved in the incident filed a civil lawsuit against the University of California Santa Barbara and against Mireille Miller-Young. The complaint reportedly was filed to ‚Äúvindicate [the plaintiff‚Äôs] own rights and rights of others‚Äù with the anti-abortion group claiming that the University failed to discipline Professor Miler-Young, who as of the filing of the civil lawsuit remains employed by UCSB. =2014 Isla Vista killings= On May 23, 2014, six students were killed after an attacker, later identified as 22-year-old Elliot Rodger, embarked on a killing spree in Isla Vista, a community located near the UCSB campus. The first three students, 20-year-old Cheng Yuan \\"James\\" Hong, 19-year-old George Chen, and 20-year-old Weihan Wang, were all stabbed to death in an apartment they shared with Rodger. The remaining three students were all shot and killed during a series of drive-by shootings; these victims were identified as 22-year-old Katherine Cooper, 19-year-old Veronika Weiss, and 20-year-old Christopher Michael-Martinez. Cooper and Weiss, both members of the Delta Delta Delta sorority, were killed in front of an Alpha Phi sorority house, while Michael-Martinez was killed in front of the Isla Vista Deli Mart.\\"Thwarted in his plan, California gunman improvised\\"\\"Police identify Calif. shooting suspect as Elliot Rodger\\"Leopold, Todd.

The campus has expanded by purchasing property in the surrounding area, in particular a large portion of a ranch owned by the Powys Campbell family. The University's West Campus includes the Orfalea Family Child Care Center, university stables, and West Campus Point faculty housing.http://www.westcampuspoint.net accessed 16 May 2015 The University purchased 221.5 acres of land owned by the Devereux Foundation in 1967 and the right of first refusal on the remaining 33 acres, which it bought in 2007.\\"Chancellor: University Plans to Purchase Devereux School Parcel; Foundation to lease back land.\\" 93106 News for the Faculty and Staff of UCSB. vol. 17, no. 13, March 19, 2007.http://www.ia.ucsb.edu/93106_archived/2007/October8/escrow.html accessed May 17, 2015. Land was placed permanently in nature preserve at Coal Oil Point, along the bluffs by the ocean, and the open field between the bluffs and West Campus Point faculty housing units. The Campbell ranch was purchased and developed starting in 1919 by Colonel Powys Campbell and his wife Nancy Leiter Campbell, who bought the property when they arrived from England. It had been part of Rancho Dos Pueblos, a Mexican land grant from the 1840s. The 500 acre Campbell Ranch was a significant property in its heyday, one of the largest in Santa Barbara County. The property remained in the family's hands until after World War II, with a large portion bought by Helena T. Devereux in 1945 for $100,000. She built a second facility for mentally disabled individuals, which operated until the early 2000s. The University of California bought the last 33 acres in 2007. Remnants of the Campbell family's ownership are seen in the Celtic cross at Cliff House, which marks the family's former burial site. The now-unused historic redwood barn still stands by the University stables. It was designed by architect Mary Craig.Anita Guerrini, ‚ÄúThe Story of the Campbells: From Montecito to Goleta and Back.‚Äù Montecito Magazine, Spring-Summer 2010. The University purchased privately owned dormitories at the corner of Storke Road and El Colegio in 2003. The University had attempted to buy the 19-acre property previously. Renamed the Santa Catalina Residence Halls, the property has housed UCSB students.http://www.ia.ucsb.edu/93106_archived/2003/January6/ucsb.html accessed May 17, 2015. In early 2015, the University has begun an expansion of the residence halls. Affordable housing for faculty was a priority in order to recruit and retain faculty. In December 1986, 65 two- and three-bedroom faculty housing units at West Campus Point were completed. For this and subsequent planned unit developments, the University selects qualified buyers who are offered a unit at a price the University determines. The buyer must sell the unit back to the University at a price it sets and it is then offered for sale to another university-determined qualified buyer.http://www.westcampuspoint.net accessed 18 May 2015 The University planned to build more faculty housing at its North Campus. Originally planned in 2004 to be 236 units of faculty and 151 units of family student housing, the California Coastal Commission required modifications reducing the number of faculty housing to 172 units. A 70-acre parcel of the North Campus land was to be placed in a conservation easement with public access.\\"Regents Approve North Campus Housing Projects\\". 93106, vol. 17, no. 9 January 22, 2007. In an effort to protect the environment, the University has teamed up with the Trust for Public Land (TPL) to restore the Ocean Meadows Golf Course to wetlands. The property around the Devereux Slough had been partially filled in. Seventy acres of land was added to the over 500 acres already put in nature protected status. The 70 acres was purchased by the TPL for $7 million in March 2013. The University will manage the property as steward; the land will be accessible to the public for recreation. Restoration of the land will need further funds, estimated at $10 million, which the TPL has begun raising.https://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2013/05/local-golf-course-to-be- returned-to-natural-state-ucsb-and-tpl-join-forces accessed May 17, 2015.

Bernstein argues that in order to prosper, a country must possess four main attributes: property rights, the scientific rationalism, capital markets and an effective means of transportation and communications. After establishing these as the basic requirements for economic success, the book examines the historical progress of a number of countries both with and without these attributes. Bernstein further argues that the four attributes are a necessary precursor to democracy.

Epler, deputy commander (Technical) of the Air Proving Ground Command, Eglin Field, Florida, killed 28 January 1944 in the crash of A-20G-10-DO Havoc, 42-54016, one mile (1.6 km) NE of Crestview, Florida. History The history of Epler Field is largely unknown, and the exact date of construction of Epler Field is undetermined. It was opened in 1942 and was constructed in a similar manner to a fully equipped base with three 4,000-foot runways, a large parking ramp, at least one hangar and numerous support buildings. At Ranger School in 1955, we were told that Eglin #7 was the training field for the Doolittle Raiders. We were also told that the yellow lines representing the aircraft carrier deck were still on the runway. On 20 November 1951 The Army located its United States Army Ranger training camp at Epler Field to provide realistic jungle/swamp training. In January 1970, the camp moved to its present location at Biancur Field (Auxiliary Field #6). The movement of the Ranger training camp was apparently the last active use of the field. All structures have been removed from the station area and the runways are shown as inactive. However, Epler is still an operating airfield that is used to support special operation activity within the Eglin complex. It is also known as Test Area B-12. Aerial imagery shows several F-4 Phantom II airframes on the parking ramp, along with an F-4 on the northwest runway end. There are also many stored shipping containers on the southwest runway end.

He made his feature directorial debut in horror film Memento Mori (1999), followed by romantic comedies All for Love (2005) and All About My Wife (2012), queer films Antique (2008) and In My End Is My Beginning (2013), melodrama The Last Blossom (2011), and period drama The Treacherous (2015). Career Min Kyu-dong studied Economics at Seoul National University, and upon graduation, he entered the Korean Academy of Film Arts (KAFA). In 1999 Min made his first feature Memento Mori, alongside KAFA classmate and co-director Kim Tae-yong. Considered the most influential Korean horror film of the 2000s, Memento Mori has attained a modern-day classic status among Korean cinephiles. After pursuing further film studies in France, Min returned in 2005 with his sophomore effort and solo directorial debut All for Love. Similar to Robert Altman's Short Cuts and Richard Curtis's Love Actually, Min utilized a large ensemble cast to weave a multitude of stories into a single narrative. About a diverse group of couples and singles who experience love or tragedy in the span of one week in Seoul (the Korean title translates to \\"The Most Beautiful Week of My Life\\"), the film was a box office success. In 2008, Min explored homosexual eroticism in Antique, a screen adaptation of the popular Japanese manga Antique Bakery by Fumi Yoshinaga. The film, about four pretty boys with hidden pasts working in a French pastry shop, was invited to the Berlin International Film Festival. For his segment in the 2009 omnibus film Five Senses of Eros, Min continued his fascination with queer cinema. Using illusive and phantasmal cinematography, he brought a more experimental and dramatically edgy take on two women involved in a mild S&M; relationship after the death of the man they both loved. A feature-length director's cut of In My End Is My Beginning was later screened at the 2009 Busan International Film Festival, then released in theaters in 2013. Based on the semi-autobiographical TV series by writer Noh Hee-kyung (previously adapted into a novel and a stage play, the Korean title translates to \\"The Most Beautiful Goodbye/Farewell in the World\\"), Min confessed that he \\"cried a lot while writing the screenplay\\" of The Last Blossom. A moving story of a devoted mother diagnosed with a terminal illness whose family comes together for the first time to give her the support they‚Äôve always denied her, the film received rave reviews from moviegoers and critics for its delicate depiction of family love. In 2012, Min wrote and directed a remake of the Argentinean film Un novio para mi mujer (\\"A Boyfriend for My Wife\\"), which centers on a timid husband who hires a professional Casanova to seduce his seemingly perfect but fearsome wife. The romantic comedy All About My Wife became Min's biggest commercial hit yet. Inspired by the Arabian Nights, Min directed the wrap-around sequences that \\"introduce\\" each segment by bridging the four short films of omnibus Horror Stories with a tale about a kidnapper who can go to sleep only when he listens to scary stories from his young female victim. Horror Stories was the opening film of the 2012 Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival. For the sequel Horror Stories 2, Min again directed the wrap-around sequences, this time structured around three mysterious insurance claim cases. In 2015, Min directed the period drama The Treacherous (2015), set during the reign of Joseon king Yeonsan, considered the cruelest tyrant in Korean history. Min said he had always been interested in historical events, and that he wanted to talk about current social issues through them; he also said he wanted to feature Yeonsan from a new perspective by focusing on the relationship between the king and \\"treacherous subjects who wear the mask of faithfulness.\\" In 2020, he created the anthology science fiction project SF8.

Functional Ecology 20 252-60. Urera baccifera, inflorescence This plant grows in moist tropical forests. It is not very tolerant of shade, so it dies back when the overstory closes. It can be found in forests recently disturbed by fire. In some areas, this plant is one of the first to bear fruit after the damage of a hurricane, and then it becomes an important food source for birds. The fruits also provide food for many species of ant. The ants also collect pearl bodies which form on the leaves, stems, and stalks of the plant. Ants performing this activity include species in genera such as Camponotus, Pheidole, Crematogaster, and Pseudomyrmex. When ants are present on a plant, they rid it of lepidopteran larvae which would feed upon it, such as Smyrna blomfildia, Urbanus esmeraldus, and Pleuroptya silicalis. This provides a benefit for both plant and ant in a mutualistic relationship.

Qandil was appointed as Prime Minister by President Mohamed Morsi on 24 July 2012 and sworn in on 2 August 2012. Qandil previously served as Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation from 2011 to 2012. Reuters reported that Qandil was a politically independent senior public servant in the Morsi administration, but was not popularly considered to be a likely candidate for the position of prime minister. Qandil was Egypt's youngest prime minister since Gamal Abdel Nasser's appointment in 1954. When Morsi was overthrown in a coup d'√©tat by the military, Qandil after initially continuing in his role as prime minister until the formation of a new government, resigned from office on 8 July 2013 in protest over the killing of 61 protestors by the military at the Republican Guard headquarters. He was arrested on 24 December 2013 and released seven months later on 15 July 2014 after he was acquitted by the Court of Cassation, which accepted his appeal and annulled the one-year sentence against him. Early life and education Qandil was born in 1962. He holds a bachelor's degree in engineering, which he obtained from Cairo University in 1984. Then he received a master's degree in irrigation and drainage engineering from Utah State University in 1988 and a Ph.D. in biological and agricultural engineering with a minor in water resources from North Carolina State University in 1993. Career After graduation, Qandil joined the Egyptian civil service in the water resources department in 1985. He was granted a presidential award in 1995 for services to irrigation, and was promoted to office director for the minister of water resources from 1999 to 2005. He participated in the work of the Nile Basin Initiative, was an observer member of the Joint Egyptian-Sudanese Water Authority, and helped launch the African Water Council. He was also Chief of Water Resources at the African Development Bank, a position he held for approximately six years, from 2004 to early 2011. He returned to Egypt following the revolution to help rebuild the country. In 2011, he was appointed Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation as part of Prime Minister Essam Sharaf's second cabinet. Prime Minister of Egypt On 24 July 2012, Qandil was appointed as Prime Minister by President Mohamed Morsi. His appointment was seen as unexpected by the Arab media, including The Majalla. On 2 August 2012, the newly formed Egyptian cabinet was sworn in consisting of a technocrat-dominated government, with a few political parties (the Freedom and Justice Party, the Al-Wasat Party, and the Renaissance Party). =First Qandil Cabinet= Qandil's first cabinet consisted of 35 ministers, including technocrats, the Freedom and Justice Party members, the Al-Wasat Party members, and the Renaissance Party members. =Second Qandil Cabinet= On 6 January 2013, ten ministers in the first cabinet of Qandil were changed. The reshuffle included ministry of finance, ministry of local development, ministry of transportation, ministry of legal affairs and parliamentary councils, ministry of electricity, ministry of interior, ministry of supply and social affairs, ministry of environment, ministry of communications and ministry of civil aviation. Following the reshuffle, the number of the ministers who were the members of the Freedom and Justice Party increased to eight in the cabinet. =Cabinet Resignations= On 1 July 2013, five cabinet members resigned together; they were Hisham Zazou, the tourism minister, Atef Helmi, the communications and IT minister, Hatem Bagato, the state minister for legal and parliamentary affairs, Abdel Qawi Khalifa, the irrigation minister, and Khaled Abdel Aal, the environment minister.Egypt ministers resign amid unrest Al Jazeera July 2013 Mohamed Kamel Amr, the foreign minister, resigned as well.Mohamed Kamel Amr, Egypt Foreign Minister, Reportedly Resign The Huffington Post 1 July 2013 The sports minister, El Amry Farouk, resigned on 2 July 2013. =Resignation= On 3 July 2013, an Egyptian appeals court upheld a verdict dismissing Qandil of his duties and sentenced him to one year in prison for not executing a court ruling to re-nationalize the Tanta Flax and Oil Company. Subsequently, on the same day, Morsi was removed from office in a coup d'√©tat by the military. On 8 July 2013, Prime Minister Qandil resigned over the killing of 61 protestors by the military at the Republican Guard headquarters.

The University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) campus is located around 10 miles west of downtown Santa Barbara in Santa Barbara County, California. Overview A view over the school's lagoon to one of the Channel Islands Henley Gate (eastern entrance) at dawn The University of California, Santa Barbara is located on cliffs directly above the Pacific Ocean. UCSB's campus is completely autonomous from local government and has not been annexed by the city of Santa Barbara and thus is not part of the city. While it appears closer to the recently formed city of Goleta, a parcel of the City of Santa Barbara that forms a strip of \\"city\\" through the ocean to the Santa Barbara airport, runs through the west entrance to the university campus. Although UCSB has a Santa Barbara mailing address, as do other unincorporated areas around the city, only this entry parcel is in the Santa Barbara city limits. Like all other UC and CSU campuses, it is self-governing and cannot be incorporated into either city. The campus is divided into four parts: the Main (East) Campus of , which houses all academic units plus the majority of undergraduate housing, Storke Campus, West Campus and North Campus. The campuses surround the community of Isla Vista. UCSB is one of a few universities in the United States with its own beach. The campus, bordered on three sides by the Pacific Ocean, has miles of coastline as well as its own lagoon. Goleta Point, also known as Campus Point, is a rocky extension into the ocean. The campus has numerous walking and bicycle paths across campus, around the lagoon and along the beach. Much of the campus's early architecture was designed by famed architect William Pereira and his partner Charles Luckman, and made heavy use of custom tinted and patterned concrete block. This design element was carried over into many of the school's subsequent buildings. Many of the older campus buildings are being replaced with newer, more modern facilities. The lagoon is a large body of water adjacent to the coastline, between San Rafael and San Miguel Residence Halls. It was created from a former tidal salt marsh flat and is fed by a combination of run-off and ocean water used by the Marine Science Building's aquatic life tanks; thus, it is a unique combination of fresh and salt water. The UCSB Libraries, consisting of the Davidson Library and the Arts Library, hold more than 3 million bound volumes and millions of microforms, government documents, manuscripts, maps, satellite and aerial images, sound recordings, and other materials. The 24 Hour Study Room, formerly known as the RBR (Reserved Book Room), is adjacent to the Davidson Library, which is located in the middle of the UCSB campus. Campbell Hall is the university's largest lecture hall with 862 seats. It is also the main venue for the UCSB Arts and Lectures series, which presents special performances, films, and lectures for the UCSB campus and Santa Barbara community. The UCSB Family Vacation Center founded in 1969, is a summer family camp located on campus that draws over 2,000 guests each summer. The staff of over 50 includes many UCSB students who have been extensively trained as camp counselors. =Layout= The university (itself termed a \\"campus\\" of the University of California) is divided into two physical campuses, a West Campus and East Campus. The vast majority of university facilities, including all lecture halls and laboratories, are in the East Campus. The two campuses are connected by a large strip (known as the North and Storke Campuses) to the north which contain university housing and athletic fields. Thus, the university surrounds Isla Vista on three sides. West Campus, aside from a few buildings dedicated to faculty housing, has largely been leased out to private organizations, and includes a school for the mentally disabled and a large nature preserve. The largest sand dunes on the south-facing coast of the Santa Barbara Channel are located here. The East Campus centers around two quadrangles, separated from each other by the main library and bus circle, and the life sciences buildings. Along the western quad are Storke Plaza and buildings housing the various arts, social sciences, and humanities departments. The Student Resource Building and the Events Center are also located along this quad. Surrounding the wider, park-like eastern quad are buildings housing the physical sciences departments and the College of Engineering. Directly to the south of, but not adjacent to, the eastern quad are the life sciences and psychology departments, as well as most of the on-campus housing. The southernmost section of the campus is dominated by the lagoon. The peninsula extending from the beach into the lagoon contains an elaborate labyrinth. =Bicycles= UCSB is known for its extensive biking system. Bicycles have exclusive right of way on paths throughout East Campus. Bicycle stands and lockers are ubiquitous.http://www.as.ucsb.edu/bikes/AS_BIKESMap_2010.pdf UCSB is unique among bicycle-heavy areas in that most travel is done within a small radius.http://police.ucsb.edu/Web/CSO/BicycleProgram.html Buildings and structures =Davidson Library= The Donald C. Davidson Library is named in honor of Donald C. Davidson, who served as University Librarian from 1947 to 1977. It is UCSB's main library, holding the general collection and several special collections: The Sciences and Engineering Library, the Map and Imagery Laboratory, the Curriculum Laboratory, the East Asian Library and the Ethnic and Gender Studies Library. The university's Department of Special Collections are also part of the Davidson Library. The Special Collections hold rare books and manuscripts and several collections, which include the Performing Arts Collection, the Wyles Collection on the American West, the Skofield Printers' Collection, and the California Ethnic and Multicultural Archives. =Storke Tower= Storke Tower Storke Tower is a landmark campanile (bell and clock tower) located in the centre of the UCSB campus. It can be seen from most places on campus, and it overlooks Storke Plaza. Dedicated for use on September 28, 1969, the 61-bell carillon tower stands tall. The bells range in size from 13 to 4,793 pounds, with the largest bell carrying the university seal and university motto. Storke Tower is the tallest steel/cement structure in Santa Barbara County.\\"CARPING ABOUT VENOCO\\", Santa Barbara Independent, April 27, 2006 =Ocean Science Education building= The new Ocean Science Education building will house the Outreach Center for Teaching Ocean Science (OCTOS) and incorporate the educational outreach program of UCSB's Marine Science Institute (MS) and the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (CSMS) OCTOS is designed to expand science education for kindergarten through 12th graders. It will also provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, who will be voluntary guides, to learn about teaching science. The project will cost an estimated $20 million, $8 million of which has already been provided by the federal government. The remaining $12 million will reportedly be made available through private funds raised by the university. The building was supposed to be completed in August 2011 but the university terminated their contract with their contractor because he was many months behind schedule and did not complete the building by the projected date. So at this time, the project remains unfinished.
